 Uh, mouse pad now. You saw these shirts, Earl, didn't you? Oh, God, it's so old. It's a colonoscopy shot of a rhettan. Yeah, it's a huge colon on a t-shirt, and people are buying them. I had to sign this guy's colon. Come on, Gelman, I'm signing colon, Gelman. Give me a break here. Hey, you guys have a good new year. Get your ass in here. You got it. All right, man. Robert Kuhl, take care. Later. Bye-bye. I'm gonna play some tunes or something. Yeah, we're gonna play, uh, play some Skinnerd by request. I know, a guy called in, he's like, man, play Simple Man. I wanna hear some Skinnerd, man. Why not? It's Leonard Skinnerd on 1027 W-A-W, 212-757-1027. Keep the requests coming. Ed, you gonna stick around? Sure. Cool. Here's some Skinnerd. Yes, Ed. I'm singing out here! Hey, it sounds like you're getting some tonight, Joey. Most definitely, bro. She sounds easy. She sounds drunk. I'm a-leckin', my friend. Drunk equals easy. I think there's people getting laid by the boatload tonight. Oh my God, you ain't kidding, bro. I think Katie Couric's drunk enough to get laid tonight. I might have to do it. I got her in the trunk. We gotta have a threesome tonight. Did you see her on TV? It was hysterical. I have never seen Katie Couric. She's looking pretty good. I don't know. Like, I'm not gonna say she was drunk, because I don't know. But she was playing the part? But I have seen drunk people in my life. And looking at her on TV, and I have seen her before, I've seen her on her show, she looked snotted. She's thanking people she don't even know. She's thanking people on other networks. Oh, who the hell's she? She seemed drunk. But Joey, it sounds like you got a, what they call, free meat over there. Free meat? Yeah, drunk off her ass. What is in the bread line on Russia? Go for it. Unfortunately, Joey also sounds like he probably can't get it up. No way, bro. Are you kidding me? I have so much champagne. All right, man. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, guys. Happy New Year! There she is. Joey getting some tonight, baby. Oh, yeah. Her pants will be coming down like that big crystal ball. Oh, jeez. I'm playing the bell. Why, come on. Wasn't bad. Oh my, the only person I saw drunk was the guy in the car. I was like, oh, my God. I'm so drunk. I'm so drunk. I'm so drunk. I'm so drunk. I'm so drunk. The only person I saw drunk on the air was Kurt Loder. Yeah, really? Video Music Awards. One year he was blasted. Oh, I thought you meant tonight. MTV was so lame tonight. Oh, God. They had that chick. What was her name? Was it Mandy Moore? The chick singer there with the leopard stripe. What? Oh, Christine Aguilera. Christine Aguilera. I was like, what's up with the hair? Yeah, she had some zebra stripe hair. She had little black streaks in her hair. She's blonde. Yeah. And had these little, they looked like. And she's blonde. Yeah. And she's blonde. And she's blonde. And she's blonde. And she's blonde. And she's blonde. And she's dancing around. It looked like lip syncing and everything. All these little teeny boppers cheering her and everything. It's like take your pants off and shut up. Pull those down. Well, she's got them down there. She's wearing these hip huggers on MTV. And she's showing her belly. And she's gyrating and thrusting her pelvis. Well, what do you mean, pull your pants down. No, we were talking about this this week. This past week about. We want to start a poll, which of the teenage stars is going to go naked first? My money is on Britney Spears. And everyone else, Christina Aguilera is going to be the first one to go whore. I see both of them like Tiffany. Just gone. A couple of tunes, gone. But the MTV thing was lame. A lot of the network coverage was lame. I didn't see, who used to do Channel 7? Dick Clark. Where was Dick Clark? Was he on? They had Peter Jennings this year. Yeah. They did it like a real news story this year. It was like the whole Millennium thing. They kept checking in on Washington to see if there were terrorists. And then they had this woman from the FAA or something flying around the country to make sure there wasn't any Y2K problems. It would have been a good goof if she would have said, we're here, everything's fine. Oh my God, we're going down. We're going down. But everything was fine. There was no Y2K problem. I heard the best explanation about why Y2K was such a big much ado about nothing. Apparently all the grids are on UK time. Greenwich Mean Time. Yes, Greenwich Mean Time. Yes. So if it would have happened, it would have happened five hours ago. Yeah, like seven o'clock or something they said. So it was kind of a big. It was a big. Everyone was hoping something would happen. I was hoping. I want anarchy. You wanted blood and carnage. Right before midnight when I saw the helicopters circling Times Square, crowds of people, you couldn't imagine looking down on the crowds of people. It was amazing. Huge. Just wanted to open fire. Anarchy. I wanted a scene out of the game Half Life. I wanted people with chain guns. I wanted the copters. Just all of a sudden the navigation equipment failed. The gyros failed. They spun out of control into the crowd. That's what I wanted. Some excitement. What did we get? What did we get? Tom Brokaw going, well, there is a CG. Unbelievable. And a drunk Katie Couric. Thank you. And a drunk Katie Couric, which is kind of worth the price of admission. She's got to get laid. She does. She lost her hubby a couple of years ago. Anthony. You a cop, man? Yeah, unfortunately we're still up here. You know something? Let me say this and I'm not kidding. You guys did a great job tonight. I came into Manhattan and I had to get to a hotel and you guys had the streets closed off. But I just said where I was going and I got a police escort. I didn't say who I was or anything like that would make a difference. You'd probably arrest me. I got a little police escort to the hotel making sure that I had reservations there. You guys were keeping things in control but you weren't being bad about it. And a lot of people thought there was going to be some problems with the cops. But it was amazing. Yeah, we tried to do the right thing but you know, Rudy's going to take full credit for it. I'll say the cops did a bang up job tonight, man. Did a great job. We've got to say let Lord Komova tell us to let the troops go home and tell all these foreigners to go home. Nobody's fucking York. Well people come into Times Square for New Year's from all over. You know how that is. Is there still a lot of people there? Yeah, they're all over the place. Really? How do you get them out of here? Nobody's from New York though. No, they're all tourists. No one from New York goes to Times Square on New Year's Eve. You've got to be a mad person. You've got to be crazy. Well, Anthony, you win. I watched it out of a window from this building. We crashed a party on the 35th floor of this building. Earl, I swear to God, we don't have a view from the 10th floor of the building we're at because this building's in the way. So we went up in the elevator, went to the top floor. I was looking for maybe a cubicle that was under construction so I could look out a window. Nothing. floor, I saw a poster that said, Party 2000. That's for me. We're going to a party. Are you just strolling? I was strolling. Some guy comes walking to me and I'm like, Hey, Happy New Year. What are you doing? Oh, from the 10th floor. Well, I guess a lot of his guests were having a problem getting through the police barricades. I was like, You're more than welcome to stay. They'll find. So, uh, no, me, Earl and my new chippy over here, we figured we'd hang out and watch New Year's Eve from the 35th floor of this fine building. Had a great time, but you cops did a bang up job. Gotta say, very courteous, very cordial, respectful, and I didn't see any problems. You only hit the blacks once. Well, you know, I didn't see any blacks. I think the cops kept the blacks out of Times Square. I'm outraged. Just do us a favor and tell all these people just go home already so we can go home and get some sleep. Everybody go home. I'm sure they all have Walkmans on their head tuned to this very station at 430 in the morning. Take care, man. Take care. Oh, Patty. Patty, Patty? Hey, Patty. Hey, hello, you're happy new year. What are you doing up at this hour? I'm going to work in Pennsylvania. I'm the opening manager in the store. I work in the New Jersey. So I got to be there. I mean, not New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Oh, my God. What are you? I got to be on a New Jersey transfer. There's two separate trains. Patty, are you on some kind of speed? No. You're talking a lot faster. It's called lack of sleep. Lack of sleep. What are you doing up at this hour? My God. It takes about six hours to get to Pennsylvania where I have to get to. But I'm there over the weekend. I'm very sorry to say Opie isn't here tonight. Oh, I know. I know. I'm very surprised you are. Yet you called? Yeah. I just say happy new year on my way to work. Very funny, Anthony. You are always the comedian. Is there a message maybe you want me to give Opie? Tell him and Sandy I send them the best and happy new year to them too. Oh, and Sandy. Yeah. Who I will soon put a knife through. Oh, stop it. Like the name that cuts there of George Harrison. Oh, no. Oh, no. Not me. Oh, well. Patty? Yes? Patty? Yes? What, do you have a call waiting? No, I'm on a pay phone. I'll feed another quarter. Here you go. Okay. Oh, my God. Is that the train? What did you do? No, you're not getting trained. Believe me. That was David Letterman's stalker. In real life. What did you do on New Year's Eve? I think everyone wants to know what Patty did. Well, I went to my friend's house. Your friend? Yeah, Carol Dean's family. I hung out with them. My friend, George Glass. Yeah. We all rang in the New Year. The kids ran out with the pots and pans and all that stuff. Oh, the pots and pans and the pans and some people. That's what you do with six-year-olds. Oh, six-year-olds. Yeah, and then we all party for better now, but I had to leave at once to go home and sleep for like 90 minutes to get up and come here. Security, 10th floor security. Oh, stop. Oh, come on. Well, Patty, you have yourself a great New Year. Thank you. And what will the new millennium bring you? Maybe new high-powered rifles? Oh, stop, Anthony. I'm the most nonviolent person I know. I don't even approve of guns as toys because they're not. They're not toys. They're for serious things like shooting open. Oh, stop. I would never do that. No, stop. I love him too much and if I can't have him, no one will. Oh, no, no. I'm not like, that's not me. Oh, no. That's only in the movies. I'm amazed you're still awake, Patty. I am. I'm sleeping on the New Jersey transit because I get off at the last stop so I don't have to worry about missing my stop. The men in the white coats take you right off the train. Oh, you're funny. All right, dear. Well, you have a great holiday and I hope you get everything you want for the New Year. Oh, I already have it, Patty. It's a call from you. Yeah, but I mean things like I hope you get your syndication dearly and I hope you get your CD release. That's good. And with that I also hope I see Santa and the Easter Bunny because that will be happening too. Oh, well, you never know what could happen. All right, there, Patricia. Let me get going. I've got to get to the train now. You have a great day. Hey, Patty, fries are up. What? I'm kidding. Have fun. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
