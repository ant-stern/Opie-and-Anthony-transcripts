 We are here, we are live. Believe it or not, it's Ope and Anthony. Wow, what the hell time is it? I just woke up. We put down the remote control, we got off the computer, we turned off the porno. We are live for this fine Thursday, December 16, 1999. Anthony, a very exciting day for the Ope and Anthony show. Yes. Today, as you know, is the big day. We are sending a busload of homeless people to one of the fine malls in Jersey to do some Christmas shopping, Anthony. Each one of our homeless people will receive $102 to spend any way they like at this fine mall in Jersey. Oh, there's the mall. We know for sure now. Very good, very good. When are we going to tell people what mall it is? When we get real close? I figure we are about 15-20 minutes away. We have to give our faithful listeners a chance to join us at the mall to have some fun. Right. They have 102 minutes to spend the $102, Anthony. Man, we are excited. We have the bus outside, the homeless people are gathering outside our studio as we speak. I have to say, they are better dressed than you and I. I know. How did that happen? The finest bunch of homeless people I have ever seen. I think the shelter kind of made sure they dressed up for today. Really? Yes. I am embarrassed because they look better than we do. I saw like suits and stuff out there. You have to mess them up a little bit. Really? I am going to roll around in the park or something. Get some charcoal and get their faces all messed up. You want them in blackface though? Not necessarily blackface, just grime up a little bit. We want them all scabby and stuff. Jeez, man. But we do, right? Yes. Their hot sandwiches just arrived too. We have the homeless people from the shelter. Ben, as we speak, is on a bus gathering up the rest of them, the ones that sleep on the street around Washington Square Park and stuff. Supposedly those guys are the real treats. Those are like the cuckoo cuckoo. Oh really? Oh yes. We are just waiting for Ben to come back with the other homeless people and we are going to start the festivities. Joey! Joey from Paisano in the studio. What do you got me here, Joe? You didn't get me any food because I haven't seen you lately? You don't come in and see me. He doesn't. This is okay, right? Come on. Oh, a big can of fried ravioli. What about me? I see who else is around here. You don't come by and see him kiss the ring every so often? You don't get squashed? Did I disrespect you, Joey? I don't know. Ah, he's serious. A little bit. A little bit. Sauce. Oh, Joey, you rule, man. Hey, Ann, are you going to share some of that fine Paisano food or what? Hell no. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Mmm. Can I have some? Ravioli. I always knew that Anthony was your favorite, you bastard. He's a stallion. I understand that. I understand that. I wasn't going to try to attempt to compete for your friendship. You've got to stop by more often, man. Come in, show your face. This will fix you. Come on, you really didn't bring me any food? Now I'm hurt. I mean, it's all fun and games, but now I'm deeply hurt. Oh, these things are great. This is awesome. Wow. It's like Spicoli when everyone's eating his pizza. Yeah, yeah. Spicoli just kind of looks over. Come on, man. What's wrong with that? Mmm, you'll get nothing unlike it. It's all right. It's not our time. Where was I? Oh, so Ben's getting the rest of the homeless people. They're eating as we speak outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. They're eating outside. So, they're eating as we speak outside, right, outside the studio? Yeah. God, put down the Pizano food for a minute. Also, the fried ravioli is like the best-wrigging thing. It's like crack, I swear to God. Oh, man. All right, so also the homeless people get a homeless prize package, courtesy of us at FM Talk, Anthony. Their prizes include a wool blanket, a wool hat, a pair of socks, a hot sandwich, a pair of gloves, Anthony. If you're warm. Some of the prizes that were not approved by the fine management of FM Talk, tickets for the Rosie O'Donnell Show, a brick, a cardboard box, half a bologna sandwich, bottle of Mad Dog 2020, a bag of cans, and a shopping cart. Wow. We were not allowed to put those in the prize package. I can definitely see why. The Rosie Show wouldn't give us tickets. Oh, really? But we're ready to go. That bitch. We are just about ready to go. I think we're going to talk to some of the homeless people before we go, right? Yeah. Yeah. Look, everyone's on the phone lines begging to find out what mall we're going to. Seth, what's going on? Yeah, what's going on? I listen to you guys all the time. I'm here in Jersey. I actually have a Christmas present for you, too. Oh, cool. Britney Spears related. And I have a little appointment to go to today, but I definitely need to know. Maybe when you take me off the air, one of the more you guys are going to be at. I can't listen for the next hour, but I want to do a little shopping, and I'm here in Jersey. And I want to see some homeless people, because of the mayhem. I think if everything goes as planned, we'll tell everyone the mall by 4 o'clock. Oh, 4 o'clock? Yeah, by 4 o'clock. It might be soon. It just depends when they're close, if they don't hit traffic and all that. I recommend Garden State Plaza. It's right off of the bridge. You can take roof four right there. It's 17. Garden State Plaza is going to be a lot of people at a night. And you can get a lot of the rich upper class to scare the crap out of them. All right, Seth. All right, Seth. Well, I got the name of the mall in front of me, and I can't tell you which one at this time. Thank you. All right. Bye. Ant is not even in on the show today because of Joey. Thanks, Joey. Jay, one. How's it going, Owen? What's up, guys? Marzol just handed him a crack pipe. Rick wants one more. Here's another one more. Jay, what's up? Hey, guys. Listen, I heard you guys mention Washington Square Park over there? Yeah. Hey, back in my day, I used to go there and get my mescaline, you know what I'm saying? All I know is that my first trip over, I seen those bums out there and I was scared to death of them. I was saying, man, these guys are going to kill me. Well, a few of those guys are coming with us today. You know what? On the homeless shopping spree. The funny thing, I was just telling the staffs on hold. I said, man, when I was coming out all tripping and bugging, they were looking like Barney. They were looking like Ronald McDonald. Man, they actually look better. I wanted to go dance with those guys. There you go. It's going to be a lot of fun today. Awesome, guys. I wish you guys all the luck in the world. I'm going to go with the Jersey Troopers, you know. All right, thank you. Get the show going, guys. All right. I have an announcement to make. First restaurant to bring me food becomes my favorite restaurant in New York. First restaurant to bring the oasters of food becomes his favorite restaurant. Is that it? It's come down to that, Anthony. That's terrible, though. Yeah, it's terrible. Joey's right here. It's terrible as you stuff your face. You son of a bitch. I'm going to bring him another wet tuna sandwich. All right. Ah, yeah. Tony, what's going on? Hey, how's it going? All right. Listen, I've got about eight cars ready to go and I want to know what time the homeless caravan is leaving. Where's your caravan right now? We are just about to go into the Midtown Tunnel. Are you really? Yeah. Didn't we tell people that they could follow our bus if they get to 57th and 7th? All right, we're going to leave by three o'clock. By three o'clock. By three o'clock. All right. And also I wanted to know, is there any way you guys can make a stop off and drop these guys off at my ex-wife's house for a little while? How much money you got? We'll do that. I got plenty. All right, man. Thank you. Also on the bus, we're going to have the homeless people singing Christmas carols and stuff. Yeah. Some of the songs we picked out are just brutal, though. Who picked out All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth? I mean, that's me. That's a little harsh. That's a little harsh. I can't wait to hear their rendition of Feliz Navidad. All right. Well, Steve from the Unofficial website is here. He's going to be documenting the whole thing on video. Yes, he's got his camera with him. So we can get some clips on the Unofficial website. Sickboy is here from XWrestling.com to help out Steve, and it's going to be a lot of fun. He's going to assist. Channel 7 at a mall in Jersey. Eric, what's going on? Hey, you got the news crew out here, man. At what mall? Bridgewater Commons. All right. Channel 7 is here. I heard, Kale, that there was Channel 2 and another one. No, it's funny. No one knows exactly what mall we're going to yet. Oh, of course not. They're all just sent out all over the place, assuming they know where we're going. Honestly, there's only five people that know what mall we're going to. And three of them are in this studio right now. All right. Thank you, Eric. All right. Bye. Too funny. All right. We got to take a quick break, and then we'll talk to some of the homeless people that are very excited to go on the homeless shopping spree. All right, Anthony? We have a bunch of our homeless people getting filled up on some fine food, Anthony. Yes. Thanks to Joey from Pizano for helping us out with food today. And everyone is trying to figure out what mall we're going to. I know. The bus is going to leave by 3 o'clock, I believe. And we're going to start the festivities. But let's go to the phones. Everyone's freaking out. Bobby, what's up? We're next at FM's Arch. Yeah, guys, you got a lot of cops over here at Mumble Park Mall in Jersey waiting for you guys. Oh, yeah? You guys are going to be raising a lot of hell if you guys come here. The mall is... Huh? They don't know what to do if you guys come here. Why are the cops all over the place? We're trying to do a nice thing this holiday season. Yeah, we know. I know you guys are trying to do a good thing for these guys, but these cops don't want... They don't want to see you guys anywhere near here. It's going to make for some great radio today, but the fact is we're doing something very, very nice for a bunch of people this holiday season. I know you guys are doing that, but... Giving them a bunch of money and a bunch of stuff that they desperately need. All right, Bobby, thank you. No problem, guys. All right, bye. Bye. John, what's going on? John? Yeah, what's going on, fellas? What's up? We're at the Short Hills Mall. It's like a trooper jamboree on Route 24. There had to be six, seven troopers on Route 24 and about 10 police guards in the parking lot. We're circling around right by North St. right now. You're a cop? No, no, no. I'm just down here doing some Christmas shopping and hopefully running into some cops. I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I'm homeless. Well, you'll have to wait and see. No, no. We can't tell people where we're going yet. I understand, but drive slow, man. You can't believe the amount of cops. All right, thank you. Be good, fellas. Bye. All right, we got a couple of our guys in the studio. What's up, man? What's your name? Tom. Hey, Tom, and who else we got? Jose. Jose, what's going on? Hey, how you doing? You guys are both homeless? Yes, sir. Living in a shelter? Yes, shelter program. How long have you been homeless? I've been in this program about 80 days now. 80 days? Yeah, I've been homeless for about a year. What happened to you? That you ended up in a shelter? Were you living on the street for a while? No, I was living with friends back and forth, and usually I was using too much cocaine, so I had problems with my chocolate candy. You still using now? No. No? Trying to clean up and get your life together? I am cleaning up again now. All right, and Jose, what's your deal? I'm living in the street, too. You're sleeping in the street? Yeah, because I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. I'm homeless. You're still in the street? Yeah, two years and a half. Two and a half years, and now you're in the shelter? Yeah. Trying to get something going? Yeah, I got to finish my school and get back to my life. Now, what happened to you that you ended up on the street? Drinks. A lot of tequila? Look at it. He said tequila. Looks like they feed you pretty good in the shelter, huh? They're taking care of you guys in the shelter though? Yeah, great program, right? They do everything over there. Alright, so we got a guy that used to do a lot of coke and another guy that likes to kill it. Are you guys excited for your homeless shopping sprint? Sure. Alright, you enjoying the food out there? Yeah, good food. We got free food for you and we're going to give you guys some stuff that you desperately need and of course the 102 bucks that you can spend any way you want when you get to that mall. What could you get? Like a half gram for that? How much? $2. Nah, I probably got about $8,400 for a hundred and two dollars. Really? Wow, how times have changed. Well alright, we might want some drug dealers to show up at the mall that we're going to. You might be able to make some quick cash before they get into the mall, Anthony. And then a little Jose Cuervo. Man, get the guy some tequila. Aw man, come on. We can't put him out there like selfie. Come on, get him some tequila. When was the last time you had a drink, Jose? I got 16 days in the program. 16 something days. Yeah, 16 something days. You can't be blowing that. Are you guys pals? I met him in the program and we became kind of tight. Everybody becomes kind of tight, you know what I'm saying? Right. Alright, well we want you guys to have fun today without a doubt. Oh my god, look at something. Oh my god, look at that. You guys are normal compared to what I just saw out the door. This guy abuses cocaine. Security? Building security? Security? Security? You guys think your lives are bad. Check out what's going on outside the door. Alright man. Alright man. Oh my god. Alright. Well Rick, why don't we get these guys out. I'm going to bring a couple more guys. You guys will be on the radio all day. We're going to be broadcasting from the bus and everything. So enjoy yourselves today, okay? Go get some more food. Thank you. I'm going to try to get you some tequila, bro. No, no, no. Okay. You don't need tequila. You're terrible. I'm just trying to knock him off the wagon. This guy's trying to overcome his problem that he has. Get his life back together. You're offering him the demon that brought him down to where he is. I hope these guys don't have weapons, man. I swear to god. Did you see what walked in there? No, I wasn't able to see that. Alright, let's bring a couple more guys in here. Rick is trying to figure out who's safe to bring into the studio. Oh my god. Oh boy. Denise is pissed at you, Joey. Denise? Yes? What's up? I'm calling with some sympathy for Opie. Yeah? Yeah, I'm a friend of Joey's, so I feel bad that he didn't bring him any food and I want to know why. He's making a statement. I haven't been there in three months, so he's making a statement. You gotta tell Joey that his wife is on the phone. Who's on the phone? His wife is on the phone and she says that you gotta bring Opie food. He usually does, but... Yeah, who's Spiff? Who's Spiff or Stiff? Denise? Yes? Who's the Spiff or Stiff guy? Spiff, with a P. He's my husband. You know what Spiff is, Joey? No. Joey says he doesn't know any Spiffs. It's Tom Tommy. He knows a bunch of Spiffs, but... Okay. Oh, come on. Oh, that's terrible. What's up? How are you? Now he knows you. How's the baby? She's good, she's good. I'm telling you, you can't bring Opie food. His laugh makes me die. He used to be my friend. He used to see me and now he doesn't come back. Oh, come on. Give poor Opie a break. He's in the big time now. Denise, it's because I'm not Italian. I always knew it. Come on, I was going to do it. You just dump him down and say hi. I've got to go find a corned beef restaurant. No, you guys have to come down to my husband's bar. He'll feed you. All right, Denise. Thank you for calling and sticking up for me. Take care, guys. It's very rare when someone sticks up for me. Thank you. Sean, what's going on? What's up, guys? I'm taking off for work to see these guys running around the mall. All right. And I had a question. You gotta booze these boys up before they get there or what? They do that themselves. I take the fifth. I take the fifth. I take the fifth. I take the fifth. All right. I think the one guy who abuses cocaine, he's not going to be doing any lines today, but I'm sure he's dying for a drink. Well, I'm going to bring him a bottle of Sambuca for whoever wants it. All right. Thank you, Sean. All right, bro. Rick, let's bring in a couple more. Bring in a couple of guys that Ben just found because this is all he got. Ben has been spending weeks trying to find the best homeless people. Ben, come on in here, man. What's up, man? Hey, what's your name? My name is Gray Wolf. Gray Wolf? I like that name. Where did you get that name from? It's from the Indian Community House. It's an Indian name. Right on. Now what? From the Chiyokawa Apaches. Now where do you live? Right now I was living in New York here with my own ex-elite and my child. Right. I found out that she was cheating on me so I put myself on the street. And I left. Where does he live? In like Washington Square Park area? I'm living here in the area of 14th Street and Avenue A. Between 14th Street and 40th Street? Anywhere in there? No, 14th and 8th. All right. Between there and 7th Avenue and Christopher Street. Do you know what's going on today? He's making a program about homeless people, isn't it? We're taking care of you. We're going to give you $102 to spend at a mall today. A fine mall in Jersey. We're feeding you guys. But I prefer to use that instead of going to Jersey and doing this. I prefer to just try to get something of $5 a night right for me. For Christmas, right? Well, that's why we're bringing you to the mall so you can get that Christmas gift. Okay. All right. It's going to be a great day. It's like a field trip. All right. We're going to have fun on the bus. We're giving you a hat, a blanket. What else? Socks, feeding you, gloves, and $102 spending money. Go and grab some presents or something. Well, Gray Wolf, welcome to FM Talk. We're going to be loading the bus very soon. Who's this guy? Is that the Peace Pipe? What do you got there? This is a flute. He's got a flute. Could you play the flute for us? Native American Indian music? Yeah, you can lower the mic. Maybe someone lower the mic for Gray Wolf there. Wow. Must be like in the desert. Okay, so Serena asked you if you could send us a promo love and班. Excuse me. them so I can perform. You are going to get some close-ups. Very nice. Great walker everyone. You don't have any tomahawk in there or anything. Do you play that on the street for some change or what? This is how I make a living on the street. I worked one year with Native Spirit on the subway. I worked also with Hope Time and Hope Time. Do you know any Christmas songs on that thing? Yeah, I could do maybe a year or so. Alright. We're trying to get to know our new friends, Anthony, before they board the bus for the mall in Jersey. Alright, I think that one needs a little work, but not bad. A little bit. I'm a little shy. Thomas? Get closer to the mic. What's your deal, Thomas? Well, I just catch work wherever I can, anytime I can. And I also do recycling things. You know, redeemables, stuff. I run up to the redemption setup on 11th Avenue, West 52nd Street. We also have a nice shift up there as well, running from 5 to 10 PM to 5 AM. So you collect the cans and get over there with your stuff? What do you mean by the... Well, that's one thing I do. Anything I catch, it's also work off the books. I don't have the world's easiest time at that when I do catch something. What do you usually catch? As far as work goes, what do you usually catch? Well, it had been at the flea market on 6th Avenue. Harder than the David Pella interview the other day. I went to 26th Street recently. I was there. Okay. Now how long have you been homeless? Let's say too long. Like how long? Seriously? Longer than you can remember? Let's say about the better part of seven years or so. Wow. Where'd it go wrong for you? A lack of work. A lack of work? Any boozing or anything like that? In your past? More like my self esteem fell off a lot. I just gave up. Just didn't care too tough. So, thanks to a couple of people here and there, I'm trying to get myself back on track again. Right on. Well, we have a fun day for you planned here. A little field trip. We're going to give you $102 to spend anyway you want in the mall. We're feeding you guys and giving you like a prize package. Are you going to stay awake? You look a little tired. You all right? Let's put it like this. For me it's an adventure living out of a locker. I understand. And if I had my way about it, some of that money would go up on January's rent where I got to pay my storage. All right. And Manhattan many stores, they're good. They're real good. I'm grateful for it. All right. Cool. Thomas and then Gray Wolf, right? Yes. All right. We got to take a quick break, Anthony. All right. The bus is leaving in about 20 minutes to that fine mall in Jersey so these guys can spend $102 anyway they like for this holiday season. Absolutely. We're going to talk to a few more of the guys in just a bit. Stay right there. All right. This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk. You can't ignore it. Sophie and Anthony. The homeless shopping spree about ready to take off, Anthony. I'm just glad we got a guy named Gray Wolf. Gray Wolf. Yeah. Gray Wolf. He'll be playing the flute on the bus. Yeah. Joey is like stupefied over there. Little background music. All right. All right. Hold on a minute. Okay. All right. Hold on. John, what's up? Oh, guys. This is like a big cop out. What do you mean? Jersey City is like the armpit of the East Coast. Jersey? It's not a nice mall. There's a bunch of nice malls in Jersey. Trust me. Yeah, I know. But you're going to Jersey City, aren't you? Who told you that? Everyone thinks they know what mall we're going to. Everyone thinks they know. Everyone thinks. Because these guys fit right in in Jersey City. We made sure we found a very nice mall. See, we need the contrast. Open some of those weighty toyy joints. This is how this bit works. I've been to a bunch of malls where these guys would fit in perfectly. All right. We need the contrast and we will have the contrast. And we're going to announce the mall in about an hour or so. Because I know you guys too well to think that you would bring them to Jersey City. No, no, no. You're going to do what you do stuff right. You'll see. You'll be proud of us. Okay. Thank you, John. All right, guys. Bye. Got to say hi to Keith the cop. Keith helps us a lot on the radio show, Anthony. Oh, yeah. And Keith is one of the guys that has been rounding up some of the homeless people, right, for us? Yeah, we found a few guys that were looking to... What is he looking for on the floor, that guy? He dropped a couple of tables. Okay. A couple of the people that could use the $102 out on the street. He's not taking a leak, is he? Ben, are you to thank for this? Are you to thank for this? I'm partially responsible. Where did you find this? Read through old copy. From downtown. Yeah. What is that guy doing? What's his name? Get him on mic. He's reading the rock faxes and all the like industry insider things. What's your name, bro? Ziggy. Hey, Ziggy, what's happening? I love your comic strip. It's funny. Hey, Ziggy, you've ever been to Paisano? That's where I was a kid. I used to read comic books. Oh, yeah. That's where that guy caught in the hallway. What did he do, Ed? I got caught in the hallway, carrying a bottle of Gavol up the steps. Whoa. It broke on the steps and I got two cuts on it. Right. And all the barking. I had my mother put my hand underneath the faucet. Yeah. You could still see them. Really? Sure. Then after that, I went to a glass window. Yeah. I got two glasses of things stuck in my hand. It's impossible how it didn't go through the rest of the body. The police got me to the hospital and they were trying to take this thing out, but I couldn't take it out. Ziggy, watch out. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy, watch out. Ziggy. Ziggy. Oh, that hurts. Wow. Oh, that one hurts. Whoa, that's a lot of blood. This guy from our... Take a train. This guy fall on a thing that's fighting, fighting on a gun. I know this guy on the floor. All right, Ziggy. But he wants to fight. But I want to go. Right. He wants to fight, but I want to go. Come on, come on. Come on. I want to fight, but I want to go. Because I'm fighting over a girl. He wanted to fight and I wanted to go. Right. I'll tell you, Ziggy makes the cocaine look really normal at this point. It's a good way to get an addict. It's got to be him. And then I fell down with a big bottle of Coca-Cola. Yeah. Right. And I scratched my fingers. I went to the hospital and the guy stuck a paper clip to his thumb. To get the blood out. Yeah. Just give Ziggy two bottles. She won't know the difference. All right. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. Ziggy. All right. We can save a hundred for dinner later on. Ziggy, where do you live? In the beginning I broke my leg. I thought maybe a direct question might help. No, there's no... Ziggy, where do you live? Anyplace. Anyplace? Anyplace. You got a place for me to live? Are you looking forward to spending a hundred and two bucks today? Looking forward to spending? Yeah. What are you going to spend your money on today? Well, Ziggy told me to come here. Right. Yeah. Because this is... What is it? Christmas. Yeah. Christmas. And you get a hundred out of it. A hundred and two bucks a bed. See, that's nice. I'll never forget to write you a letter when I get a cent. We're going to Jersey, going to a nice mall, and you'll be able to buy some Christmas presents and stuff or some warm clothes, whatever you need. All right? Anything you... I got an announcement to... What a big video tape. I got an announcement to all our homeless friends. We're not arresting anyone today. A lot of people are very paranoid that they came here to get arrested. That's not the truth. No. We are definitely taking care of you guys today. Going to a mall. Going to a mall. Take a little bus ride. Have some fun. Well, Keith, what is this guy's deal? You found him. Keith, the cop. I'm a little rock and roll, sorry. I think you see the radio station in Covies. I think this guy used to work here at any company. Hey, it's Scotchow. But it wasn't as big as... Yeah. All right. It's just a plain station. It's a plain station. It's a plain station. It's a plain station. It's a plain station. It's a plain station. It's a plain station. It's just a plain station with no equipment. All right. Well, thank you, Ziggy. To counter Keith. Yeah. What does Ziggy's deal? Ziggy's just a guy, a local guy from downtown that's part of his luck, so we figured we'd bring him up. Do the locals take care of him down there, hopefully? Yeah, he gets a lot of beer. Yeah. You like drinking the beers there, Ziggy? As they say, everybody's weak. That's all, you know. Would you be a stay out of everyone's way? What the hell? Budweiser, the king of beers. Budweiser, king of beer. We got something in common. There you go. I'm sure our sponsors will love that. That endorsement. They could be the voice of Budweiser or something. You know, would you like a beer, Ziggy? It's a nice matter here. Everyone will be willing to voice. Yeah, that's true. You know, he probably read the memo that no alcohol is allowed in the studio. All right. Well, let's hear it for Ziggy. Ziggy, Merry Christmas. Enjoy your little trip. Probably don't get out of Manhattan much, I guess. This is like a star. Is this recorded? Now, this is live. Is there anyone you want to say hi to, Ziggy? Wow, this is amazing. Somebody must have heard of it. A lot of people have heard. A couple of people. Just a couple. You're going to find that you have a lot of fans when when you reach that mall today. And we're encouraging our faithful listeners to take care of some of our new friends. All right. When you make new friends on the street, just tell them you come up to the radio station any time. It's Wilton Darvus at K-Rock. Send them all up there. If you're looking for free food, go to the Pizano's of Mopar's. No wonder Joey didn't bring anything. He is done, Joey. All it would have taken was a plate of food, Jon. You're done. Oh, man, I'm totally sticking with Joey on this one. Hey, Joey, how you doing? How you doing? There you go. How you doing? All right. Very good. Is there anyone else we want to talk to before the bus takes off, Rick? I think we're ready to rock. You're ready to rock? All right. I think you can take the manuscript. Yeah, you can take the manuscript. Take one piece of paper. That's all right. We got plenty of paper. You could have all the you could have all the paper you want. Take as much paper as you want. I'll take what it takes. There you go. Hey, Ziggy, take that with you, Ziggy. Steve Ziggy knows a Christmas Christmas a quick Christmas song as we go to break. Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs? Yeah, I know a Christmas song. I like all of them. You want to sing one real fast for us? It seems like a genius. All right. Let's go. Silent night All right. Holy night Always come Always come I didn't even peg this announcement. All yon virgin, mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild Keep in heavenly peace Keep in heavenly peace All right. I think we just found a new star in the next homeless commercial. Yeah. You know how they show that? Yeah, you could sing that song and put it on TV. There you go. Let's hear it for Ziggy. Rick, what do you got? Yeah, next week, Ziggy's IPO hits the market. Ziggy.com There you go. All right. We're going to take a quick break and round everybody up outside. We're going to take them downstairs to the bus. All right. Rick got the cell phone. We'll check in with you outside as everyone loads the bus and we'll talk to a few more guys. Okay. What happened? What happened? My eyes are tearing. Oh really? All right, fellas, let's rock. All right. Come on, Zig. All right. Have fun, Ziggy. You could take that pickle with you. I'd like to just take it with me. Yeah, you take it with you, man. You can have that. Ziggy rocks, man. Yeah, thanks. That's not nice. At least no one saw it. Psycho Mark is fraying down the area Ziggy just took over. Lysol. Wow. Lysol. There is a little bit of a wasp coming off of Ziggy. Okay. You might want to bring that up to the bus with you. All right. Why don't you guys go down to the bus and we'll check in with you down there. You know the funniest thing is I turn to my right. I see Joey from Paisano sitting here. It's like there have been days I've seen a smile pasted across his face and we've had naked girls dancing and lesbian dancing and stuff. Today he's just sitting here. He just looks pissed. He's like, why you put Ziggy right next to me? Ziggy was like three feet from Joey from Paisano. Ziggy is going to get the best table in the house. All right, Larry, what's going on? That's the same smell you know when you're talking is going bad, right, Joey? That's the another throw down. Holy cow. Hey, Larry, you're next on FM Talk. Am I? Yeah, what's up? Okay, I want to know if you guys are taking me to Paramus or something. If you're taking the Riverside Square Mall, which is like high class beyond all belief, or Garden State, which is like the ultimate mall in North Jersey, what you got to do is ditch these homeless people in Hackensack. No one will be worth full aware. You won't even notice that they're around. We're going to announce the mall. We're going to 20 minutes before we get there. Okay? Oh man, because I want to get there with my camera. I got to get pictures of you guys going to Paramus. Right on. Well, hang tight to the radio. You'll find out soon enough. I'm holding on. All right, man. Thank you. That's why. Who are these guys, Rick? They don't look homeless. These are the Opie and Anthony Security. Oh, my God. All right. What do we got? Chuck. Hey, Chuck. What's up? Romano, PJ Hooker. PJ Hooker. PJ Hooker. Are you guys excited to help us out today? We got a hell of a crew out there, huh? Yes, Commissioner C.P. Yeah, you met the Viggy? Viggy? Yeah. We got some kind of Indians. All right. Hey, they don't want to shop, though. They want a bucket of money. Oh, no, they're shopping. They have to shop. Got to shop. I think what's going to happen, they'll shop. And then if some of our faithful listeners, you know, show up at the mall, maybe they can help us out and give the homeless people some money they could take with them would be a very nice gesture today. Just so we're going to let you know that in case anybody tries to boot our shoppers, we got the harassment and trespassing statutes with us. Awesome. All right. We got a mess. We got a with us. We got we have cops, Anthony. We got a lawyer on the bus. Yeah, going to happen. I got to hook up with the lawyer. He's out there. All right, guys. Thank you. We'll talk to you guys on the bus. Nice meeting you. Godspeed. We're going to have to have a beer together after this. All right. Hell, yeah. All right. All right. Security detail. Wow. Let me tell you something. Studio rigs and smell that. Yeah, it's really bad. It was OK until the big my turkey. Oh, I bet I bet he hasn't seen a shower and God probably been a long time. We're going to get a whiff of it. It's more of a small to the heart of my man. I swear to God. I'm going to get Ron on line 11. Hey, Ron, you're next to the FM talk. What's up? Hey, ONA, what's up? All right. Come on. That wasn't a homeless guy named Ziggy. That was Jim Brewer doing another voice. No, I got him. It was like Brewer, wasn't it? It was, man. We got some fine pictures of Ziggy. We're going to put it on the unofficial website. You're not going to believe it. All right, cool. That's when I thought our homeless people were too normal looking. Ziggy walked in and the Indian guy walked in. We're set and ready to go now, man. I don't know who was scarier, man. The Indian dude or Ziggy. I don't know, man. Ziggy. Ziggy picked up a pile of papers that he thought it was a manuscript for some kind of movie. Yeah. And he wanted to read through it. It was like old, like, copy from old commercials and rock fact and stuff. And he took it with him. So, all right, Ron. Okay. Reading material. All right, guys. All right, bye. Probably good insulation. All right. That was so stupid. Things are really, uh... I think that was a Paisano read in there. All right, things are starting to cook now, Anthony. Oh, yeah. Next time we talk, hopefully we'll be on the street with Rick outside the bus that the homeless people will be boarding. I can't even believe these morons. He's a disgusting little man. I'm dead. What a douchebag. Clean rat, clean rat. Stand over. This is sicker than faces of death. Ignore it, Topee and Anthony. Hey, man. They are spraying down the studio as we speak. Oh, my God. My eyes are tearing. Yeah, it's a little, uh... Hmm. A little thick. Out there. All right, let's go to the phone. Kenny, what's going on? Hey, O&A. Hey. Hey, you know, just a comment about having Ziggy in there just a minute ago. Yeah. You know, it's kind of special. Like, you know, it's almost Christmas and here's a guy, he doesn't know where he's going to sleep tonight, let alone Christmas Eve. He's got nothing, no child to go home to see a smile when he gives him a present or something. Yet he can belt out a Christmas carol like that to be as happy as the next guy, you know. Well, you sound like you're getting a little choked up. No, it's just kind of weird. This is my first Christmas with a new child, Mom. Well, I just, you know, I think of it like, but what I think, you know. Hey, we are, I mean, we are definitely having fun today and we're going to, you know, we're going to stick it to some snooty people. But the fact is, we're definitely helping a bunch of people this holiday season. You got to see that part of this, man. Ziggy's singing Silent Night, that'll be with me forever. Yeah, that was something, huh? All right, that's it. Just an observation. All right, thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Donna, what's going on? Hi, how you doing? Real good. I just want to tell you that lady that called earlier that you hit with the train. Yeah. I have to agree with her, but in the same sense, you're doing something really great for these people. Something that like nobody else is going to do for them. Let me tell you something. They're laughing and having a great old time, you know, outside the studio eating and getting ready for this big day. Well, I'm coming here cooking for a party, a Christmas party, and I'm thinking about these people. And I'll tell you, no matter what anybody says, wherever you go, I don't, you can come to my living room and have dinner. I don't care. All right. I mean, these people need you and you're doing good and God bless you all. Have a great holiday. God bless us, everyone. Donna, I think you would want Ziggy to shower about ten times though before dinner. Probably. Probably. Probably. I'll let you do that. I'm not going to lie to you. I've never smelled anything so unbelievable in my life. Yeah. Well, you know, some are unfortunate and some, you know, we have showers, they don't. All right. Good. Okay, have a great one. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Brian, what's up? Hey, how you doing? Good. You guys have no, any kind of medical support, do you? Could you use a volunteer ambulance person, a medic? I think at this point, Aunt and I need shots. A little spray of Lysol. I'm not kidding, man. Yeah. We went through two cans of Lysol. Try for breeze. All right. Okay, but you don't need no help then, huh? No. Oh. Thank you, Brian. Okay, bye. Bye. We'll go to Rick's on the line. We'll go to him in a second, but first, Wally. Wally, what's up? Yeah, ONA, what's going on, guys? All right. Listen, I just wanted to warn you. I'm over at the Bridgewater Commons, and I want to tell you, I don't know if you guys are coming here or not, but the cops are everywhere. Well, we have our own cops, we have a lawyer on the bus, you know. This is going to happen today. All right, I understand, but I'm just, I'm just, I'm just letting you know, man. They got Sadie's, and they also have the Bridgewater Police and the Somerville Police, and they're just combing every entrance. I don't know what's going to happen, but I figured I'd let you guys know. You know what I mean? Thank you. All right, guys, have a great day. Everyone thinks they know what mall we're going to. Only five people know at this point. And I... I didn't know who we were going to. No, I know. I'm not... I just want to give you a heads-up and let you know what's going to happen. We're going to announce the mall soon, though. Thank you. All right, guys. We got cops at just about all the nice malls in Jersey. We have two news crews at the malls they assume we're going to, and they don't know where we're going. No one knows at this point. Rick! Guy! All right, Rick's downstairs with the homeless people. How are you doing, Rick? We're doing good. We're on 57th just in front of the Hard Rock. Okay. Any of the listeners that are going to be caravanning with us. We're just getting set. We almost have one guy already get hit by a freaking taxi. That wasn't Ziggy, was it? No, hold each other's hands. We got to do like the school trip thing where everybody's got to have a party. All right? But as soon as we get rolling, when I tell you exactly what, you know, when we get to the certain area, I'll give you a call back. You know what I'm talking about. I got fucking code for now, as you know. Okay, but you guys are loading the bus as we speak. Yeah, we're loading the bus now. God damn this place is, look, I must be downwind from these guys. Holy crap. Take extra care of Ziggy for us, okay? Yeah, definitely. Ziggy almost ran off. We had to make sure we showed him the money again. He almost ran off. All right, and Rick, next time we talk to you, have everyone singing a Christmas carol on the bus, all right? You got it, dude. All right, there goes Rick, everyone. He's outside the building as they board the bus for Jersey. And there they go. Look at that on their little Christmas field trip. Special day. Joe, what's up? You're next on FM Talk. Oh, and hey, what's up? Yeah, I'm listening. Why don't you give us a hint? Like, play a game, like Simon says, or what highway they're taking, or something. Well, uh... What's the other direction? Hints? Honestly, we have a couple decoys out there. Really? Yeah, because we want this to happen. We want them to get to the mall. Okay. The next obstacle is, will we get the bus, you know, to the mall? Because a bunch of cops called and said they're going to, you know, stop the bus. And find a reason to, like, impound the bus. So now, I guess the next thing we got to hope for, everyone has to keep their fingers crossed, we got to hope that the homeless bus makes it to this fine mall in Jersey. All right. All right, we have to go in stages. When it gets to the point of no return, that's when we'll tell everyone what mall it is. All right, because they got like a 45-minute ride to certain places, so... I understand. All right, thanks, bro. All right, if you run into the homeless people, though, please take care of them. They're going to need some extra money after this is over, okay? You got it. All right, man, give them some change or anything. All right. Thank you, Joe. Bye-bye. Bye. How's the S&P back yet? People loving it. Cool. Frank. All of them wondering where the hell they're going. Frank, you're next on FM Talk. What's up, guys? All right. Great show, man. Thanks. What's cool? I think this is a great thing you're doing. You know, the, what's it called? I think it's, uh, I think it's pretty historical, and people that get mad about it, they have no sense of humor. I'll tell you one thing, they're having a lot of fun. I was kind of bummed, because we saw the first few homeless guys, and they looked, uh, better dressed than Aunt Nye. Yeah. And, uh, well, that's not the case anymore. I think it's great. They're having fun. It's funny for us, and, uh... The people that ban and keep the cop guys from Washington Square Park are priceless. Absolutely priceless. All right, Frank. All right, guys, take it easy. You guys suck. Thank you. I can't wait till, uh, this really exclusive mall gets the likes of, uh, Grey Wolf. Grey Wolf and Ziggy. And Ziggy. Grey Wolf with his little flute. Gotta play a little tune for the mall patrons. Why not? I think Ziggy ought to go and, uh, try on some clothes. I want Ziggy in one of the, uh, exclusive clothing stores trying on some pants and... Yeah, he wants a job, so maybe he needs a nice business. Yeah, maybe they should try on a nice business suit. Uh, Mike. Yeah, two things, guys. Yeah. If you don't go to the Short Hills Mall, you're dropping the ball, because that's the snobbiest frickin' mall in the Tri-State area. All right. All right. Two. I love everybody calling in congratulating you guys. Let me tell you something. I'm a big fan, but you guys aren't doing this for any other reason, but it's Ray Radio. Give me a frickin' break. We're helping these guys out. You know, we're giving them something that they haven't had in years. Hey, Mike. Mike, keep to yourself. I definitely will. Guys, good luck today. All right. I'm waiting to hear which mall you're going to. All right. Thank you. Mike. I think, uh, yeah, Ziggy needs to go into Saks Fifth Avenue. And then maybe, uh, play with some toys or the FAO Schwartz or something. Oh, why not? All right. Well, the phones are just going nuts. Wow. I think we need to play a couple tunes. All right. Yeah, we can do that. Spaz is, uh, running in like crazy. I mean, the media is calling. Oh, everyone is trying to figure out where we're going. We'll play a couple songs before we break. What the hell? Yeah. We'll start with some Zeppelin. It's going to be a special day on the Opie and Anthony show today. Oh, yeah. More to come. And, uh, just a bit. We'll check in with Rick again very soon. All right. It's, uh, one oh two seven. It's Opie and Anthony. It's FM Talk one oh two seven. And, uh, we got Rick back on the phone. We're doing our homeless shopping today. Everyone is coming into the studio, shaking their heads. What's wrong, Char? We lost one. We lost one. We lost a homeless person already? Wait, get on mic. We lost one? But we didn't lose one. He just decided he didn't want to do it. He thought we were ripping him off. He didn't want the money. He wanted the money just to leave. He didn't want to. It wasn't Grey Wolf or Ziggy, was it? No, Ziggy. Oh, okay, good. Ziggy's still good. Ah, okay. Thank God. But they're on the bus jet in like any minute right now. All right, cool. Thank you. What's up, Earl? Rudy and I, we were, we were setting up the, uh, the bus. Yeah. And all the truckers were like beeping their horns saying, Oh, pay an Anthony. And one guy screaming at the top of his lungs, speech are homeless. Speech are homeless. Well, they are. They are getting fed. Did you see, uh, Grey Wolf couldn't even wait. He had a sandwich and he's, uh, on the air over here. He stopped unwrapping it and eating it. He thought it was on the air. He thought it was bison. Mmm. Keep him in good grub. Me get into trouble. Years ago with fire water. White men's fire water. Uh, Rick, what's up? Guys, what's happening? All right. Rick's on the homeless bus right now as we speak. Yeah. I heard you guys are a little concerned that we may have lost Ziggy or Grey Wolf. No, those guys are still here. All right. Good. Ziggy's actually like setting up camp in the backseat. The only way I rousted him from his map is when I asked him if he wanted a ginger ale. He came running down my alley. Ah, yeah. But he's, but he's in good shape and, uh, he's in a good spirit. All right. Everyone's in a good mood right now. Rick. Yeah, it looks like. Hey, you guys in a good mood ready to spend some cash? All right. A fun-fuller homeless lunatic. There you have it. The cold of the water. Very good. All right. We're about to be moving away from 57th Street heading to a certain bridge of unnamed, uh... Oh, yeah. Jeez. Can't figure that one out. Shut up, man. But, uh, yeah, we're about to pull out any second here and, uh, we'll, we'll call you guys back in about 15, 20 minutes. All right. Get Psycho Mark to organize these guys to sing one of the, uh, Christmas carols that we have for them, okay? All right. Now? In a little while. I, I... In a little while, we'll do a Christmas carol. I think Texas Halls would be good. That's an easy one. Okay. There's not many words in that one. Yeah, that's true. All right. We'll talk to you in a few minutes, Rick. All right, dude. Thank you. Peace. God, Julianne, he should just be indebted to us right now. We're helping the homeless problem. We're shipping him to Jersey right now. We're doing our part this holiday season, Anthony. Because of Opie and Anthony, there will be less homeless in New York. You ought to adopt our plan. Uh, Brendan. What's going on, guys? All right. Yeah, I gotta warn you guys. Yeah. There are cops. I live around the corner from the Bridgewater Mall. Yeah. I've been driving around all day. There are cops all over Jersey. Well, yeah, there's Jersey cops. No, yeah. There's jobs. Besides that, they're out for today. All right. Yeah, that's not naked though. No one knows what mall we're going to yet. Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying watch it because they're looking for you. All right. Thank you. You got it. All right. Bye. Later, guys. Instant feedback. We got, uh, Rocco and Clifton. Bring them all into KB Toys. It would be hysterical to watch the kids scatter. That would be pretty funny. Patrick, what's going on? Hey, nothing much. All right. I just want to congratulate you guys on what you're doing. Oh, thank you. Thank you. And it's about time someone figures out what we're doing here. Yeah. And people are calling whining about it and saying that you're doing it for radio. But you guys deserve the credit. Oh, thanks. And you're the ones who are doing it. So the ones who should take credit for it. Okay. We are doing this for no other reason than to help the homeless on the holiday season. And if anyone gets credit for it, you guys deserve it. Come on. Hope you'd Anthony advocates for the homeless. All right. Thank you, Patrick. All right. My God. I don't see anyone else doing anything. Joy. Yeah, what's going on? How are you guys? All right. I work at North St. Jom at the Grand St. Plaza. Okay. And I feel any homeless women coming to be honest with you. I think it's all guys because we didn't want any rape charges. I believe I believe there's no women. Well, if you go to North St. Jom, it doesn't matter. We really can't confirm that because they are wearing so many clothes. That's really tough to tell. Make sure they go to the perfume counters and they have to get all free samples. Okay. They're going to have to fumigate them at the perfume counter. Use a super silker full of Old Spice. And I also want to ask why are you all afraid of the cops? Because I don't think there's nothing illegal about it. No, there isn't. We're not afraid of the cops. We have our own cops and we have a lawyer on the bus. So what's why are these people calling up and giving you problems? Well, I don't know. They seem to think there'll be a problem. I'm working here at the Orange Land and you guys were here. Cycle Mark was here last week. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm waitressing and actually the bartender Christy wants to talk to you back because she has an opposite opinion of me. Well, we got to move on though. Tell her to shove it up her butt. Wait, hold on. Christy, come here. Shove it up her butt. There you go. He's been ranting and raving all day about this. Hold on one second. What's her problem? Here she is. Hello? Hey, what's your problem? I think that it's pretty frigging rude that you're bringing them here and just leaving them. Well, they're allowed to stay if they want. It's a free country. Well, why are you bringing them here instead of taking them shopping in New York? I'd be proud to have Ziggy in my neighborhood. You would? I'm not proud to have him here. Well, too bad. I don't like them that they're going to be here and just stay here and just, you know. Have an open mind, you twat. Hey! You cheeky cheeky. I want to go see them. I'll go to New York again. That's where they are. That's where they live. That's where I live here. All right. All little handful is now coming to Jersey. Fries are up. Go get back to work. I don't waste your... All right, bye. Goodbye. Putting a damper on our little party today. Please. Like a little little handful of homeless being shipped over to Jersey today. All right, George, what's going on? Yeah, I just want to say like you always have these Hollywood types that claim to advocate certain cause. Rippin' and they think they're doing something. Here we have Opie and Anthony. Yes. They... They do what... What nobody else could do. They're... They're actually doing something. I know it's in a small way, but you're helping out a bunch of guys. All right. Thank you, George. And you should be praised and lauded. And the whole city of New York should thank you. We should... We should all rent our own buses. All right. We should all follow your lead. And then we would solve a problem. Yeah, we wouldn't be wearing ribbons or anything. You know? All right. You guys are doing a good thing. More power to you. Thank you. See that? Look at the adulation we're getting. Oh, doesn't it feel good? I got to tell you, one of the homeless guys. Yeah. He's really happy because we saved him bus fare because he wanted to go to Jersey. Oh, really? He's definitely going to stay today. Look at that. See? So not only is he getting 102 bucks to spend today at one of those fine malls, he's actually saving bus fare as well. He's getting a bus fare to Jersey, his new home, the place he will now call home. Heyman. Oh, it's Heyman. Heyman, what's up? You know, uh, Gray Wolf? Yeah, I know Gray Wolf. Is Zicky a little guy who looks like his face was used like a punching bag for a long time? Uh, yeah. Oh, right. Yeah. Don't make fun of our Zick. Oh, I love the guy. Actually, both of those guys sang in key. Well, Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey. The most beautiful thing about Zicky is the cops know him and they ask him to get up off the street. He lives in front of this place called Stromboli. It's a pizza joint on Avenue, uh, First Avenue. Okay. On the ground. He lives on top of a garbage bag. Well, now he's got a blanket, courtesy of the Open Anthony Show, a wool blanket. I'm serious. That's great. All right. That's great. All right, cool. Beautiful thing. Thank you. Let's do beautiful things for people. All right. Thank you, Sam. Have you been to the airport from Jersey? Yeah. Oh, thank you for coming in every Friday and Saturday and polluting my neighborhood. All right, cool. Good night. Good night. All right, Anthony. Hmm. Yeah, this is just nuts. Danny, what's going on? All right. Good. Hey. I'm going, uh, to Open Anthony. Yeah, you're on the air. Danny. I just dropped work coming down the park. How's it going? Well, they'll know soon enough, man. Yeah. How much longer? Uh, I got to check. All right. All right, cool. Good day. All right. Thank you, guys. Bye. Bye. And we'll do that. We'll check in with Rick on the homeless bus next. This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk. You can't ignore it. It's Open Anthony. Today is the big day. We're doing the homeless shopping free, Anthony. Yes, we are. Very excited. As we speak, the homeless bus is on its way to Jersey. To a very nice mall. Oh, yes. Uh, Junior from Jersey. On the instant feedback. Just want to say that for the first time ever, I am afraid to shut the radio off. Quick question. When the S hits the fan, will you guys make a statement to the press? Because you know this will be all over the news tonight. Be good guys. Talk hard. Junior. Well, we do have some news crews there. They're at a couple malls in Jersey, assuming they know which mall we're going to Anthony. We didn't tell anyone which mall. Yes. Because we didn't want anyone tipped off. So pretty much there's a panic all over Jersey as we speak. Um, I got a little description of the mall that they're going to. Okay. Very luxurious. Let me take a look with you. Our homeless. I don't know if we should even name some of the stores in. No, I think you can just say the, uh, maybe their little, uh, motto that they have, whatever it is. They're a little slug line. Yeah. An oasis of luxury minutes from Manhattan. That's where our own homeless will be shopping. They actually plug them all as being an oasis of luxury. So we're not, we're not putting out on this one. People believe me. They are going to look like the proverbial square pegs in the round hole. I know waste is the blog. Here we go. And they better not mess with our homeless. They are people too. I'm looking at the list of stores and it. All right. Let's talk. One, two, three, go. Yeah. Good job guys. All right. All right. Right. Oh my, we almost took out a homeless guy in the street. Holy crap. Yeah. The homeless guys in the bus looking out and going, oh, he's frigging homeless. We got the key from still playing. I, we hear gray wall. Yeah. Oh, they're breaking out into a rap. Let's hear a homeless rap. You're going to do a rap. You're going to rap. You're going to beat me. I can't rap. I'm not concerned myself. Put something together. I'm going to be on the bus. Oh, one guy's falling asleep. Well, wake him up. Oh, hey, wake him up. He's going to leave it on. I'm Jesus Christ. How you doing, man? Okay. I'm big. Biggie's jamming man. All right. We're just about ready to cross the T.W. All right. The unnamed bridge. Okay. You guys figured that one out. What? Why don't you talk to a few of the other guys we haven't talked to yet. All right. Anyone else? I want to say hi on the radio there. What's your name, dude? What's your name? Keith. Keith. You want to talk to the guys real quick? Keith? I'm cooling. I'm listening to my music now, man. You're you're listening to music. The guy had a rock band. Oh, yeah. So he's not even listening to us. No, he's not even listening to the station. I think he's trying to win money on a hot 93 or something. All right. All right. Let me talk to Ben real fast. All right. Ben's in the van actually. Oh, Ben's following you guys, huh? Yeah, he's in the van following. What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? I think Ziggy dropped a bomb. They're all laughing. Oh my goodness. Oh, Ziggy, huh? What did that light fall? Oh my God. Did you guys bring Lysol on the bus? Yeah, one of the guys is spraying right now. All right. Very good. Oh, combat safety. The LA security for the combat day. And can people tell what bus is what bus you're on? No, I don't think all the 1027 FM talk stickers we put all across the sides of the bus is going to tip anybody off. I think we're pretty well camouflaged. Oh, very nice. All right, Rick. Anything else to report at this time? I got to go because we're going to start breaking up as we get ready to cross the bridge here. So we're going to lose the signal. Great move there. I don't know if you're familiar with the steel girders on the bridge. Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Rick. All right, guys. I'll check in when we get closer to the mall. Okay. And we got to give away the mall very soon because a bunch of listeners want to join you guys. Yeah, I can't wait to see the Oasis that they have. All right. Thank you. All right. Later. Bye. Let's say goodbye. There they go. The bus full of homeless on their way to an exclusive mall. Doggy doggy dancing for more money. All right. Thank you. All right. Later, guys. Let's check in with Ben who's following the bus as we speak. All right. Hey, Ben. Yeah, what's going on? What's happening? You aren't stupid enough to get on that bus, huh? No, I'm in the nice smell free van. All right. Are you in the FM Talk van? I am in the FM Talk van. All right. And you're following the bus? Actually right now. We're right in front of them. Any cops following the bus at this time? I don't see any cops at the moment. Okay. A lot of people cheering us on as we drive down the street. Oh my God. It's going to be like Patton rolling into a nice European city. Look at you. Well, there's a lot of stages to this homeless shopping spree. The next stage we got to worry about. We got to make sure we get to the mall without the cops stopping us. So we're all keeping our fingers crossed. But Ben. Yeah. You did a great job finding these people, man. Thank you very much. I knew that you'd like Ziggy the best. Ziggy is a classic. Oh, they're going to love him. He might be a regular member on the radio show after today. They're going to love him at that mall. I'll tell you that. All right, Ben. We'll check in with you soon. All right. Okay, guys. All right. Bye. Later. Bye. Jim, you're next at FM Talk. What's going on? Yeah. I just wanted to call and say hi. And I think it's hilarious. I live in Jersey. Yeah. And this is the funniest thing. You have all these homeless people coming in and pissing off all these white people. Well, there's some white homeless on our bus. No, I know that. But I think it's even funnier that all these rich white people that you're bringing them into their neighborhood. Yeah. They're throwing a fit. Cool. Screw them. It's hilarious. You got to see some of the stores they're going to be shopping in. You're not going to believe it. Oh my God. Really? Yeah. The list of names. We won't go into them right now. But any exclusive store you could think of they are in this mall. Oh, man. It is amazing. That's great. I don't know what 102 bucks is going to get you at this mall. Oh, I don't know. I think they're going to be able to buy a pretzel. Yeah, I'm looking at the other stuff. This mall offers. I'm hoping they have a Santa Claus because we want a few of the homeless guys to get the you know, a picture with Santa. Oh, yeah. I haven't been on his lap without a doubt. All right. Thank you, Jim. All righty. Bye. Oh, we got to check in with Jay more our buddy our pal. He's back in town. Hey, Jay. Hi, gentlemen. How are you buddy? Last time I checked I was in that studio when you guys said come back anytime. Yeah. Well, I called Rick the producer. He said today's not a good time. No, you can come down. He told me no. Shut screw Rick. Rick told me no. Well, you know, he still hates you from the last time you were here. I'm a shoe like a little geisha girl. He was like your little little bitch. I only have about 20 minutes on the homeless. You know, I only have about 20 minutes of homeless material. Yeah, really? I could have absolutely just launched scuds for about 20 minutes. Jay, come down. I'm cleaning my apartment now. Oh, come on. Don't blame me. Blame your producers. Today's not a good time. He said you got to call us personally. You don't even have to ask him. I know he's in the studio. Yeah, I'm going up. I said, you know what? I'd love to go up because I want to go up there and pitch and nothing to sell. I want to go up there just because I like those guys. Hey, Jay, don't you guys do next time you're in here? You definitely got to fight Rick because there's too many things going on between you guys. What's going on? You guys got arms like a train truck. Who cares? You can take him down. You're a rascal. I think I'm down. I just don't want to get hit. Now, Jay, I have a very marketable face. Let's put it on the table right now. You don't have to ask anyone. You just show up whenever you want. Yeah, Rick and everyone else. You're going to call me at home and said today's not good. Oh, you come by tomorrow. I said tomorrow. I'm going back to LA. I'm here for a day. One day. I'm here. I want to do all the work. Tell me no. Wait, so you're not even coming tomorrow. I can go back to get in here right now. I got a home. I got a wife. I got a job. Just get your ass in here. OK, I don't have a job. But. You jump in a cab and come down. I can't. I got stuff to do, man. You son of a bitch. No, no. Redirect that. You son of a gun. Look at Rick and say that. I can't believe. I didn't know. Dude, if I knew, I would have said Rick, what are you doing? I said today is not good. We got so much comedy today. We don't even have room. We have a guy. We have a guy that has limo that'll pick you up right now. He's on line five. A guy that drives all our people around. I really can today. I was gonna I made it a whole thing today. I was going to go up. I had nothing to promote. I didn't go just for the fun. And then I found out about the homeless thing. I got like 20 minutes on the whole. Yeah, I hate the home. Hey, Jay, how funny is this though? We're going to the sickest mall in Jersey. Which mall? Short Hill? We're not saying at this moment in time. Everyone is guessing. Short Hill. The Paramus Park. Look at you shut up. I'm not Willowbrook because that's the homeless people anyway. When are you back in New York? I don't know. I don't know. Hey, put Rick on. Why did he say today was no good? He's on the bus with the homeless people. It's not even here right now. What the hell was he talking about? Jay, next time you just show please. Don't even call. Yeah, you have like that. Tomorrow you want to do tomorrow because there's strippers. I said I'm flying back to LA tomorrow. Dude, we have I mean today's a great show. But tomorrow we got the whole lesbian for a day thing again. We got a 73. Lesbian what? We do the I want to be a lesbian for a day. We have a lot you kind of started with the kissing cousins. That was pretty amazing. I think Brewer took a lot of flack that day. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you got the problem you and Brewer. No, he got mad at me. Someone over my time at comics come home. Oh really? In Boston. I went like 10 minutes over my time and he he was on after me. Yeah, because it was like anybody that brought up your name. He was just kind of like, oh, Jay, more. I love Brewer. There's nothing he could do that could ever turn me against him. Call because we like both you guys. He's hilarious. Yeah, but it really pissed him off that I went over because I think you had a hard time his first couple of jokes because the crowd was still like going retarded over like. And Brewer believe me, anybody who's anybody that's ever seen a Jim Brewer show knows that it's not to be taken lightly. That guy comes with the full barrel gun. Oh, yeah. He got Jim Brewer is one of the funniest guys alive. Hey, when does this comics come home happening because I think it's Sunday night. It sounds like a good one. It's on Comedy Central, right? Yeah. Hey, Rick's on the line. You want to yell at him? Yeah. All right. He's on the bus with the homeless people. So be kind. He's going to be homeless. All right. Hold on. Hey, Rick. Yo, Jay Moore's on the line. Yeah. He told me today not to come by. Hey, Rick, turn your radio down. All right. Hold on. Is Rick the one with the loud radio playing in the background? He should be smacked. All right. Try it again. There we go. Hey, Rick. Yo, Jay, you told me today not to come by. It wasn't a good day, right? No, I said today is not going to be as good a day as tomorrow. Well, you said today is not good. Because I understood your request through Joey that you were looking to see certain types of guests. So believe me, tomorrow's a gash fest. Yeah, but first and foremost, I just wanted to hang with the guys to prove to them that I was down with nothing to promote, with nothing to. Yeah, we believe you. Well, I wanted to come up and hang out. Anytime, man. Well, you know, today's not a good day. Instead of spending another 40 minutes on the phone with us, get your ass down here. I can. I can. I get stuff to do. Even Joey's getting pissed. Come on, Jay. You promised. Jay, I called you at 11 o'clock this morning. Joey, you called me for dinner last night, by the way. Did he? Oh, man. That's not right. You charged the Hollywood star? You got all that money. I don't know. Hey, Jay, I called you this morning at 11 o'clock and told you if you want to come down, just page me. But I told you that tomorrow wouldn't be a better day. So that was at the tail end of the message. The first part of the message was, Jay, it's Rick. Look, today's not good. Tomorrow, we got like Bedlam going on, et cetera, et cetera. But today's not a really good day. No. The last one's in the studio. Opie said come back any time. That's it. Yeah. But Rick took executive powers, Opie, and said any time except today, the only day you're available to come in just to have fun with the guys because you're a fan of the show. I had no idea today was your only day. I'm living in LA. I'm trying to get a movie deal. I'm trying to get movies here. I'm going to be the next movie dealer. Hello. I don't know you got homeless stuff. I'm a comic. We're going to bust with those stinky bastards right now. You don't know anything about homeless people. You want to bust with those stinky bastards right now? Yeah, yeah. Ask them why they wear 15 winter coats in the summertime. What is that? A test of strength. I don't know, man. Some of them are sleeping. Like Siddhartha. They're all like, I'm going to see how much heat I can withstand. Some of them are sleeping. Don't they do enough at night during the day? Biggie's crashed out in the back. Who, Biggie? I think he's taken food. Biggie. Yeah, Biggie was going pretty bad. What does that fuck smell like right now? But Jay, I was also trying to get your head for you today. Hey, Rick. We've got that all set up. Rick, what smells worse? What smell is winning, the homeless or your Jocard Noir clone? I can't afford Jocard. Oh, yeah, you can't. It's a Guido Cologne of choice. Yeah, but I'm a spiky rat. I'm a spiky rat. You guys definitely got to fight next time you're together. I think so, Fight Club. Fight Club? Yeah. Jay, if you start losing, trust me. There's a bunch of guys around here that'll jump in and help you out. I'll just bring some brothers down with me. If the Puerto Rican gets on top of me, just, you know. Hey, that ain't bad, man. He pulled my man's hair. Jay, they killed you off in the last episode of your show. How brilliant was that? Time attack, 9th, Saturday, Thursday. Dead. The stroke of brilliance. And that bitch, Jennifer Love Hewitt, they signed her up and keep her show going. Her show got worse ratings than mine, man. I know. What a wreck. Yeah, that's what it is. Cans won out, man. I am so happy to not be on TV. You got to get, really? You got to get Preston plants. I've got a few more to get. Why you happy? Because I didn't realize how hard I worked until I had time off. And today I slipped a poo. I slipped a poo? Fuck! That's what I got. I got two pornos. I got a couple Buttman videos. I'm just like spraying the infield. That's all. I just sit around. You know when those guys come out like the 6th inning and they just hose down the infield? Right, right. And it starts to blow away. That's all you're doing. That's all I do. Uh-oh. You didn't dump that. They just... No, not at all. I just spray the infield. Hold on. Let me, Jay, let me get rid of Rick. Rick, what's the... Get rid of Rick. Why don't you fire him? Hey, Rick. Rick. Yeah, what? What's wrong? I think we got a caravan of listeners following us right now. Oh, awesome. Alright, very good. Hey, all you listeners out there. We're in the garage. If you're gonna hold a Rick, kick the crap out of him. Wouldn't you rather be listening to me right now than Rick with a bunch of stinky people at Lodge in their underwear? Everyone, dick, slash your high beams. Rick. Rick looks like the Italian guy at the mall. He looks like he should be working at a merry-go-round. Kick his ass. Hey, Jay, love you. Wanna be Italian? I got your butt all set, yeah. Talk your horns if you can hear me. Alright, hey, Rick, hang up. Goodbye. God damn it. We'll talk to you soon. Come in. Sorry. I have a $10 reward for anybody that kicks Rick in the nuts, but no death, please, no death. No killing. There will be no killing of Rick. Nah. Jay, you're funny, man. It's a nice kick in his donkey balls. You know he's got like a four-foot drop on those things. It's like a Crown Royal bag with stones inside. A Crown Royal bag? Can't believe I'm not sitting up there with my whole board. I know. What are you doing? That jackass. Jay, if you really liked us, you'd be here, man. No. I'm gonna go with you right now, which is what I'm doing. Alright. I got a doctor's appointment now. I gotta go get my happy pills. Get your happy pills. There you go. Anthony is no stranger to the happy pills. Hey, come on. Anthony takes his happy pill eight ounces at a time in those little red bottles of... That's right. Anthony drinks wine out of a box. In his refrigerator, he's got the box of wine. Yeah, I heard you guys had quite a night at the Paisanos. That was fun, man. It was a lot of fun. We had a lot of stories. Yeah. Laughed my ass off. We were talking about your days in Boston and... Yeah. About how the mayor died. Yeah. Yeah, that was a good one. And by coincidence, one of my best friends was the mayor's assistant at that time. In Boston? Yeah. No. Kevin Chapman. Oh, very good. Oops. So, what's going to happen if Rick... Am I like an accessory to murder if somebody like puts a bullet in Rick's head right now? Probably. You know how lawyers are these days. You could be tied to it. Yeah. So, what are you guys doing tonight? You just talking over there and going back to Rick's remote? Yeah, it's great actually. I mean, we got news crews all over the malls. They're all... Everyone's freaking out. You guys should have your own TV show. I don't know what the problem is. We're getting there. We gotta have Jennifer Love Hewitt on it. We gotta get those big jugs. We need breast implants. Jennifer Aniston's got big jugs too. But now she lost them. She lost all that weight. But when I worked with her, she had jugs and a big fat ass that you want to put your face in. Oh God, I hated her. But I still went to my car and washed off every night. Goddamn, that's beautiful. She hated me. Bitching? She said to Ileana Douglas, they screen tested six guys and the one guy I hate they hire. Wow. What's the problem? I don't know, but I thought the movie turned out very well. Yeah, she didn't like it. It was very hot, but she had the extra like 30, 20 pounds on her. And saw that big fat ass. Queen of starfish. When's Marco gonna call back? My gay friend. Your butt buddy, yeah. I heard everyone... People in LA are downloading that on the internet. It's coming up to me. Let me tell you. You know what? As we go to break, I gotta replay it. Because I mean, we've had so many requests for your gay sex phone call, man. Gay phone sex. Gay phone sex. What floor are you guys on? Oh, you're coming. Come on, man. What floor are you? We're on 10th floor, man. What? 10th floor. And? We got happy pills. I was talking about... Okay. Alright, cool. I'll be over there in about 20 minutes. Alright, awesome. We talked to a man. J. Moore, our pal, coming back today. Got to show up, man. Come on. Alright, now we need to get him some girls. He likes looking at girls. Any chicks that want to come down. Any fine-looking women. Just come show off for J. Moore. Come to the studio. Big Hollywood star. We'll let you in. Alright, and we gotta play the gay sex phone call that J. Moore did last time he was in the studio with us, okay? Oh, yeah. And we'll check in with Rick and the homeless boss in just a few minutes. Stay right there. This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk. You can't ignore it. Don't be an Anthony. Having a lot of fun today. And just when we thought it couldn't get any better, J. Moore, our buddy, our pal, our only Hollywood friend, I believe, Anthony. Uh, yes. Is on his way down to join the festivities. Yeah. We talked him into it. He should be here in about 15, 20 minutes. Cool. Let's check in with Rick. We're doing the homeless shopping spree today. I think everyone knows what's going on with that, right, Ant? Yeah, we got a busload of homeless headed for a very exclusive mall in New Jersey. It's been $102 that we gave them. Uh-huh. And we also gave them a homeless prize package. That includes, gotta get my list out here, a wool blanket, a wool hat, pair of socks, we gave him some hot food, pair of gloves, and other things. Yeah. And these guys are very, very happy and motivated today and they can't wait to do some shopping. So let's go back on the bus with Rick to find out what's going on. Rick? Yeah, guys, what's happening? All right. Woo! Yay! Woo! No, no, we're waving to people outside. We got a caravan following the van. Oh, nice. And this one guy's just like, oh my God. People are gonna ask, like, I knew it was they were coming this way. Oh, really? Yeah, we're about 15 minutes away from the unnamed mall. Okay. So do you guys want to reveal that this time, give our faithful the chance to get there and welcome us? Yeah, we should. Yeah, let's do it. I think we should, too. Let's pop it right now. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is none other than the Short Hills Mall. Woo! Short Hills Mall! What the hell do you think? Are we gonna pussy out, go to, like, the second most exclusive mall in Jersey? No. And someone on the Instant Feedback thinks this is a scam, like War of the Worlds. Oh, really? And, uh, is that, wait, War of the... Yeah, War of the Worlds. Okay, and it's not a scam, it's really happening. They're, like, 15 minutes away from Short Hills Mall to do some shopping with some homeless people, right, Rick? I'm looking at the pictures off of their website. Oh my God, look at this stuffy lady in front of Tiffany and company. With her little suit and bag. And there's a lovely couple ready to shop at Creighton Barrel. Yeah. But, uh, some of the stores, Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany, Gucci, FAO Schwartz, Brooks Brothers... Armani. Armani Exchange. Armani, I think Ziggy needs to try on some Armani suits. Don't you, Rick? I think so. I think he's got to at least try on a two-piece suit. Oh, classic. I mean, you're talking top-of-the-line stores here. He doesn't look like a best guy, so we'll just keep it a two-piece suit. Oh, sure. I think he needs an Armani. Right now, believe it or not, it's nap time. What do you mean, what do you mean it's nap time? Yeah, the guys are all kind of sacked out. Wait, they're asleep? Yeah. What the hell did they do so that they're so tired? Well, we were singing for a little while. Oh, that constitutes work. And I think it kind of tired them out because they're all pretty much sleeping, except for one guy who just kind of cracked his eyes open. All right, I'll... Ziggy doesn't even know he left New York. Ziggy doesn't realize he even left New York. He's not going to know. He doesn't know we're taking him across eight lines. Oh, classic. All right. But yeah, he's sleeping. We got Snoop Doggy Dog is hanging over the seat. The Chief is sleeping. The Chief? That's Gray Wolf. Yeah, Gray Wolf. Gray Wolf. Everybody's sleeping. They're all sleeping, catching a nap. We need them to go to Cootsie. Oh, the T-shirts are classic. Yeah, but you gotta let Ziggy keep all those coats on, man. Oh, yeah, we're just going to have them put it on over what they're wearing. All right. Yeah, but make sure they keep their coats on and stuff. Them walking through the small... Unbelievable. If they want to put the shirts on, that's cool, but make sure they also have the coats on and whatever else. Picture Ziggy running into... look at this brush. Like, picture running into him. Hi, I'm Ziggy. I can't wait to take a little makeup counter. Macy's. Yeah, the makeup counter. Ziggy makeover. So everyone's asleep? We can't even talk to any of them? Let me see if any of them woke up. Let me see. Oh, hit me. Wait, we had a dump out. What happened? We dumped out. What happened? I stepped on one of the guy's legs. And what happened? I tripped. They were laying across the seats. I just heard, ow, S. What's your name, Don? Don, yeah. All right, Don, how you doing, man? I'm doing all right. How you doing? Pretty good. Talk to the guy here. Hey, uh... Hey, Don? Uh-oh, the phone just crapped out. We're losing the phone. Guys... Hey, all right, we're losing his connection. We'll get back to Rick in just a second here. We can go to Cheryl, who's in the limo following the homeless bus. Cheryl! Hey, Cheryl! Did we lose Cheryl? All right. Yeah, we lost Cheryl. What we have is a homeless bus. Yeah. Then we have the FM Talk van. And then we have Cheryl and the gang in the limo. Oh, really? Yes. Taking the nice vehicle. Yes. So, uh, there you have it. We are going to Short Hills Mall. We'll be there in about 10 minutes, Anthony. We get him Gucci skull. Eddie, what's going on? Not much. All right. Listen, man, I got a friend that works in Aveda. He has like a... Like a cream store, like massage creams and all this crazy stuff. And I want you guys to go in there. You think they'll give one of the homeless guys a free massage? Absolutely. All right, cool. Have one of the homeless guys ask for a massage. All right. You gotta go in Nordstrom. All right. All right, so that's great. Thank you, Eddie. Rick's back on the line. Let's see if he has a better connection. Rick? Yeah. All right, what's up? What's happening, guys? One of our less fortunate guys is going to be shopping today. Don, you want to talk to the guys real quick? Hey, Don. Yeah, what's up, guys? Are you in a good mood today, Don? Yeah, you know, except for this blindfold, man. They put... I'm blindfolded. I can't see where I'm going. They put blindfolds on you guys? Yeah. Come on. That is... Yeah, man, I got my hands tied, too, man. He's holding the phone in my ear. Okay, thank you, Don. I know where I'm going, you know. You guys could be taking me to Cuba for all I know. No, it's what it is. We're going to give you $102 to spend any way you want in that fine mall. Really? Yeah, Short Hills Mall. And a bunch of our faithful listeners are going to join you guys there, and I believe they're going to give you change and stuff, too, all right? Okay, man. Well, have fun, Don. All right, I will. Thanks. All right, buddy. All right, guys, that's Don. Okay. And yeah, the other guys are pretty much sacking out. Ziggy is sacked out in the back there. I think he's like, claiming the back quarter of the bus room. Holy crap! What? Did you see that? That guy almost hit a parked car. One of the guys in a blue pickup was waving to us, waving his arm out the window. He almost hit a parked car. Oh, man. Holy crap. You guys got to hold caravans. Yeah, we got to hold freaking caravans. It's like celebrities driving down the road. I think it could be the music from the cheese pipe or something that's... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rick, how long before you get to Short Hills Mall? I guess about 10, 12 minutes until we get to Short Hills Mall. Okay. The oasis of luxury. All right, we'll check in with you soon, all right? All right, you got it, guys. All right, man. I want to go to Ben, who's in the FM Talk van, who's right behind the homeless bus. What's up, Ben? We got a huge caravan following us. We got a bunch of guys in a black pickup that are right behind us, and we are on the way to the Short Hills Mall. Everybody's waving to us. Huge crowd behind us. Oh, cool. All right. Everybody meet them there at Short Hills, and you can watch the homeless shop. Yeah, we want to welcome committee at the Short Hills Mall, so when you see the bus start beeping and waving, then welcome our homeless people to the fine mall of Short Hills, okay? Anything else, Ben? That's about it. We're having fun. Big crew behind us. We're ready to get to the mall and go shopping. All right, cool. Thank you. Okay. All right, there goes Ben. I want to see a gray wolf go into glamour shots and have a little glamour shot taken. Wouldn't that be neat? That would be funny. Come on. All right, Ed. Things are shaping up. Piece of pipe. Piece of pipe. Now this is critical time here. Now that we have announced that it is Short Hills Mall, let's see if we'll make it into the mall, Anthony. Yeah. Going to have to cross battle lines, I think. Yes, and we'll check in with Rick right after these. Stay there. Dudes. We're dudes. I think every time we open our mouths, we'll fit someone off. Both of you and Anthony. We're out of control. We're so wacky. All right, knock it off. 1027. Anthony, we're in the middle of commercials, but we've got to break in. Yeah. Because the homeless bus has arrived. All right. At Short Hills Mall for the homeless shopping spree. An oasis of luxury minutes from Manhattan, the Short Hills Mall. And a ton of our faithful listeners are making their way to the mall as we speak. There's a welcoming committee there, I'm hearing. So let's go to the phone now and talk to Rick, who's on the homeless bus. All right. Guys, we are here. And we are on location at the Short Hills Mall, right in front of Houla Hands near Neiman Marcus. The staff of Houla Hands just came running out to greet us. Oh, really? We got a bunch of listeners with stamp out racism signs, help ONA stamp out hunger. I mean, people are just here supporting this in grand scale. We have more people pulling up. Oh, look, security guards are running over. All right. That's why we have the ONA security detail talking to those guys right now. Okay. Are you ready for the guys to come off the bus? They didn't even make it on the bus. What security guys? Hey, Rick, are they ready to leave the bus? Yeah, in just about a moment, we're going to be bringing everybody off the bus. All right. And introduce them to the wonderful world of shopping here at the Short Hills Mall. Why don't you have each guy maybe say, you know, hi, you know, through the phone as they're walking off the bus, you know, what their name is and that, okay? All right. You can introduce them to the whole radio audience. Ask what they think maybe they want to be buying in some of these stores. Yeah. All right. All right. Hold on a second. Okay. Here we go with the first guy. What's your name again, sir? Neil Armstrong. Thomas, what do you think you're going to buy today when you get into the mall? Usually, throats. What is that? All right. Thomas isn't sure exactly. He knows there's a lot of different stores to pick from. I think he sees hooligans and realizes they're all going to stop there. They're not going any further than hooligans. Did you have to park them in front of a bar? Oh, he did. It was the best place. They had a welcoming committee. What's your name again? Gray Wolf. It's Gray Wolf. Oh, Gray Wolf. What are you going to buy when you get in there? Toys for my little girl and a present for my wife. All right. There you go. Gray Wolf. He's going to be buying some stuff for his kids and his wife. All right. Skilps. What's your name? Frankie. Frankie, what are you buying? I'm going to Tiffany's. All right. He heard it. He's going to Tiffany's. He's going to go buy himself some nice jewelry. That's okay. What's your name, dude? My name is Cory. Cory, where are you going to go shopping first?

People not really know it. You know how hard it is to get a cab in Manhattan at 4.30? I stole a bike to get here. Well, we appreciate that, Jay. I stole a bike with one of them old-like fashion chains at the combination lock. I was like, I can fix it. The Asian bicycle delivery guy. I went to junior high. So I got some Chinese food here. I heard the sass on the front. You kicked the Chinese guy off his bike to get here. I like these cabs. They got bulletproof glass between you and the driver. Glass that'll stop a bullet, but somehow it doesn't stop that smell from making it. You guys are like, where do you want to go? I'm like, upwind. Why don't you take me to the river and you can swim to Giant Stadium in the back? It's nice that you got the heat on in a wool suit. What do you like, dressing up for your job? All I see is the back of your head and your right arm. We're bathing suit and some speed sticks. Stinky bastards. If anybody's out there going to see comedy, make sure you go see Jim Brewer. Look at you plugging Jim. I feel bad that Jim's mad at me because of that show in Boston. That's what it was, though. It's nothing from SNL or anything. All right. Hold that thought, Jay. Rick, what's up? We're bringing the guys off the bus. They're chanting for Ziggy. Ziggy is the little fat homeless guy who smells so bad. Standing at five feet four, Ziggy! The most pathetic of the homeless. They couldn't broadcast. I wish we were. They didn't have any broadcast facilities for us at the short Hilton Mall. All right. Coming up now, here we go. Our next guy is Frankie number...what number are you? Number one! Oh, we put numbers on him. They all have their homeless shirts on. 00000. All right. Up next, number two is Jose. Jose is hooked on tequila, we find out. Loves his tequila. That's what he's homeless. All right, everybody. Here's ten, number eight. Who's cheering, the fans? Yeah, a bunch of our listeners are down there. You guys should have hired Bob Shepard from the Yankee band. Number seven, Bob. We got Keith, number four. Wow. And finally, we got Snoop with no number. He's just running on out of... They love Snoop. Look at the picture of this chick. Libby Dolph. Libby Dolph. Rick, very good, Rick. All right, guys. We are just about ready to jump in here. We got to get in the mall now because they're going to arrest us. We're causing too many problems here. Hurry up, get in there. How many people are around? It's probably about 150, close to 200 now. There's people coming out of the mall to greet us. We got like five security guards now with their trucks. We would like to rent a homeless person. We got guys wanting to rent homeless people. They help them chaperone and get them shopping. Hey, Rick, make sure Ziggy tries on some shoes as well with that nice suit. Oh, my God. Hey, Ziggy, Nordstrom is good for shoes. You want to try there? Nordstrom shoes. Good? I don't know. I got shoes on. All right. He's got shoes on. That's all he needs. He's had the same shoes since 75. Why does he care? The traffic's all the way back to the highway. What's the browns? What's wrong, Rick? We got the state police to move it up because we're back in the area. Get in the mall. Get in the mall. Run. Yeah, get in the mall. Get in the mall. We're getting in the mall, guys. We'll talk to you in a minute. All right, cool. Bye. Bye. There they go. Really, they'll be turned away. Oh, my God. It's Bedlam. We have a few listeners, Jay. All right. Oh, my God. The homeless shopping spree is off to a fine start, Anthony. That is fantastic. And you know what's great? It's a write-off for you guys. You can talk about it. You guys can get some nice leather jackets and stuff. You can write it off. You can get it on the show. I'm talking about my act. I'm talking about my Rolex for 10 minutes. You can write it off. Let me tell you something about the people at Rolex. It's professional. I have to do it. Oh, we're very excited. The phones are just going nuts. Man, also the listeners that are going to be following them through the mall. Yeah. That's just going to be like... I wonder if Rick got kicked in the nuts at all. Somebody will do it. Hey, look, for Jay Moore. Let's talk to Mush real fast. Mush, you work at Short Hills Mall? No, I don't work at Short Hills Mall, but I do some services once in a while. I'm not saying exactly what I do for the sake of my job, but they are the most stuck-up people in the world. That's why we picked Short Hills Mall. I had a call up there one day to see what their problem was. They just had the name of the business. It didn't say they were in the Short Hills Mall or anything like that. So I call them up and I'm talking to them. And they're like, yeah, just to make sure before I get out there, you're in the Short Hills Mall, right? He goes, no, sir, we're in the mall at Short Hills. I was like, well, have a good day because I'm not coming out. All right, we picked the perfect mall then. I hope they have a good day. Hey, I have a few friends that work there as well. So have them stop at Bloomingdale in the perfume department. Well, these guys need to be sprayed down, so that's not a bad idea. All right, thank you. They should bottle that homeless smell and sell that. Uh-oh, I'd sample that. What chair are you sitting on, Jay? I don't really swear to God. Is that the chair Ziggy was sitting in? Is that the chair over there? Oh, good. We sprayed it down a light bulb. I like you. That's why. Is it just going on you that I might be sitting in a chair that is like a... You don't understand what was sitting in that chair. Ziggy Cyril is so friggin' bad. Like we're taking that chair out of the building with us tonight. We haven't laminated. Hey, I listened. I was driving from upstate New York, Delhi, all the way down here. And I listened when you guys had those two chick cops in. And that was some of the best radio. Oh, it beat the crap out of us, man. Yeah, but Anthony was an animal. The wrist... I was trying. The resisting arrest show. Yeah, I was a puss. I was really trying. What would happen if you just turned around and punched them in the face? You know what? They would beat the living crap out of you. They stepped on you. I was hurting, man. Yeah. They get that one pump on you and then twist it. So it's working like a ratchet on your wrist. I was in pain. Finally you just say, all right, I give. I give. Enough. Rick had a bloody nose. I heard Rick was a pit bull. Yeah, Rick was really tearing him up. Then the one chick grabbed his sack and started squeezing and put her knee right in his face. And he started bleeding. It was great, man. He had a bloody nose from having his balls grabbed? What kind of wiring does he have? That's a weird wiring job, man. I can understand it running a little. It was a wild show, though. Grab my balls. Watch my nose bleed. I'm a weirdo. Jim, real fast, what do you have, man? Yeah, I left work early today because I knew you guys were going by the Short Hills Mall and I got to go by there on my commute. And you could just see the cars backing up into the entrance of the mall. The bus was there. And I called my wife and said, I'm coming home early because I'm not getting stuck in that crap. But I'll tell you, the one guy who called up was all because I live in a town next to the mall. And the guy said, we thought it was so great, these guys coming out to the rich suburban territory. Tomorrow they're going home. Tomorrow we're still rich. And that guy's face. Whatever. Yeah, way to scoreboard for you. You're homeless and I'm rich. Right. What a nice guy. What a jacket. What a dad. Yeah, well tomorrow I'll still be rich and white and afraid of blacks in Puerto Rico. And I'll live in my little gated community and you'll still be homeless. Joke's on you, homeless guy. You showed him. Scoreboard, rich guy one, homeless guy nothing. You have the homeless guys on the radio. All right, hold on. I'm not going there. Marco's on the line. Oh, look at that. Let me talk to Mike real fast. Mike, what's up? Real fast. What's up, fellas? All right. My wife and I, we make about $150,000. We went to the short hills with my son. Yeah. And they were looking at us like we were trash. Oh, really? Screw them all. What color are you, Mike? I'm white. Oh, you sound like a black guy. All right. All right, that's a point, Jim. All right, man. Thank you. All right, you guys rock. All right. He's kind of like a brother, isn't he? Mark. Yeah. He went down to short hills mall. Right. Young man, red man, flavoring you with a few pounds, you know what I'm saying? Let's check in with Psycho Mark who's at short hills mall as well. Psycho Mark. Hey, what's up, guys? What's up?

So what are you guys looking for? Anything in particular? Not really. Just to see what the best value is around here. Value? I don't know who he's going to get for it. Is it DK? Value. Best value. You want to supersize that for 33 cents extra? The crowd was unbelievable outside. Yeah. Did they not follow you around in the mall right now? Yeah, we've got a small crowd following us around. There's mostly people staring at us. Yeah. None of the salespeople have come to help us. Yeah, none of the salespeople. None of the salespeople. They don't want to help? I don't understand what might be. Well, Psycho Mark, who are you with right now? What you guys again? Okay. I got Jose. I'm Tony. And I got Kent with me. Well, have them just start trying on jackets and stuff. Yeah, why don't you guys start trying on some nice stuff? Do you just want to try on a nice shirt? Oh, no. That looks awful. We've got some Tommy Bahama shirts over here that look really nice. I think you guys would look good. Yeah, definitely try something on because I think there's not enough people staring at us. I think they need to stare at us some more. Oh, here's a salesperson over here. We have some great shirts, you said? And what's your name? Simon. We've got Simon here. Simon. He's kind enough to help us out. My name is Simon. And yeah, if you wouldn't mind coming and helping some of these salesmen, that'd be great. That's what I'm asking, man. Simon.

Mark, make sure they remove the... Hold on. Hey, Mark. Yeah? Jay has something for you. Jay Moore. This is just a technicality. Did you say Jay? This is a technicality. Make sure they remove the clothing they have on before they try on the new clothes. Don't just layer them up. Don't make them dress in layers. Get them naked. I want to see homeless titties. You said Jose's fat. That's something I don't understand. How could homeless people be fat? Freaking homeless. Ever see the homeless guys in the park with muscles? How do they get muscles if they're homeless? I go to the gym every day. I can never break 160. I'm 160. I'm 160 pounds my whole life. I see a homeless guy who's all ripped up. How much does that cardboard box weigh? He's working it, man. He's shopping. What's the problem? Over 3500 dollars. He's looking for another store. I think Neiman Marcus is a little too snooty for his taste. Well, one of the homeless guys walked out of Neiman Marcus? I've had it. With six Donna Caron suits under his jacket. I can't shop here again. We are getting stared at. You would not believe the stares we are getting. Hey, Mark, why don't you talk to one of the snooty people and ask them what they're staring at? Yeah, exactly. Excuse me, ma'am, have you ever seen any homeless people like this shopping in a mall before? No. Never? Are you from New Jersey? Yeah. You are from New Jersey. What do you think about homeless people shopping in Neiman Marcus? It's good for them. It's good for them? She likes it. So there you go. She's very happy. She's happy, all right.

Here at George Hill, the guys, people are offering to buy themselves so they can save some cash and buy some other stuff later. Hey Rick, it's Jay. How much money did you pocket so far? I'll give it to him. Give it to me. I'll give it to him. You jerk-off. I can't wait for the Fight Club between Jay Moore and Rick. It'll happen. It'll happen. Okay, Frank's got a pair here. All right. He's got a pair of running shoes. He's got a pair of running shoes. Yeah, the socks have to come off. It's been a long time since I've been shopping, too. Yeah, I can imagine. He's got to lift it. I don't even know what's up there. But he's running down the street with a TV. He's going to have to be... Is he going to try the shoes on or what? Yeah, he's going to try the shoes on, right? But the socks have to come off. He's got a box in hand. He's going to try them on right now. The socks have to come off. Yeah, I'm going to take the socks off. Yeah, I'm going to get a pair of sneakers. They're still there. All right, guys. You heard it. We're here at Foot Locker. We're at the Short Hills Mall. We've got about 300 people outside the store. All right, you've got to find Santa, man. All right, we're going to go to Santa. Plus, we've got an offer for Mrs. Field Cookies. They're going to give us like 25% off all their cookies. Very nice. Cool. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up. Pop her up.

It's going quite well, our homeless shopping spree, Anthony. I love the generosity just pouring out from the people. At the Short Hills Mall. I think Spaz farted behind you because he's waving it off. What the hell, Spaz? It stinks enough in here. Ah, Spaz, man, in the office after the show yesterday. He's sitting there. He's just blasting farts out. What do you think? People enjoy the smell of your ass? Dude, come on. Speaking of enjoying the smell of an ass, let's talk to Marco. All right. Man, man. We have time. Yeah, we have time. Screw it. Marco. Hold on. Marco. Jay. Hi, baby. He doesn't even want to address you or I. Hi, baby. Hello? Yeah, Marco. It's Jay. How you been, baby? Are you sure your show hasn't canceled? It's been canceled, honey. That's it? I'm nervous talking to you again. You're nervous? Where are you now? I'm just sitting in a car. I'm late for work, actually. They put me at home for a while. You're going to be a little later when you pull over to the side of the road and take your hog out. I already took it out. You already took it out? Yeah. What's it look like? Are you circumcised? Yeah, I'm circumcised. How long? How big is it? It's good, six inches. What do you measure from the asshole? Jay. Last time was amazing. It was amazing. Do it to me again. No, you do it to me, honey. Do you want me to do it to you? I watched a porn the other night and I think his name was like Phil Penton or something like that. Yeah, that's my porn name. And you made it pretend it was me? Yeah. How's it look after that? Easy, Marco. Keep me out of this one. Marco, why are you going there? I'm going to make a nice pork sirloin open. Okay. That's one way to get off the air, Marco. Marco, if you want to stay in the air, I don't want you floating around with eyes for other men. I want eyes only for my ass. The air man. Come on. Did you say Marco? I knew it wasn't Marco. It sounded like an Italian guy. It didn't sound like the same love. It sounded like a little bitch. I know. It sounded like a little bitch. Come on. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Come on. It sounded like the same love. That's all right, though. The real Marco we'll call it. All right, we got to take a quick break. That was disappointing. It was. I was getting excited. You could tell right from the beginning, though, he didn't sound like the same guy. Well, at first he sounded scared, like, oh my God. I got through. And then I got to like the Italian accent coming through. Marco was like Puerto Rican or something. Look at this pack guy from Brooklyn. That isn't Marco. He knew right away. Yeah. You know, that's Marco's lover. Let's just preoccupy it. I'm with Marco now. I'll take it off. I got it sped. We're back at the short milk mall. Psycho Mark. Yeah, what's up, guys? What's up? We're in here shopping for shoes and Ziggy is just causing a major disturbance in here. He's got a coat on. He's got a brand new hat and he's trying on some shoes. It's just an absolute scream. There's got to be a hundred and fifty, two hundred people jammed in this door here. At least. I just got chipped off. There's a candy store right across from the shoe store. The girl said if we walk over there, she's going to physically throw us all out. Oh, really? Yeah. So I'm trying to run up a couple of them so I can go for candy. Hey, Mark. Hey, Mark. Yeah. This is Jay. You have a constitutional right to walk wherever you damn well please. Absolutely. What did you say? You have a constitutional right to walk wherever you damn well please. I have a constitutional right to go buy candy if we want to. So why don't you buy the candy right now while we're on the air, man? Alright, hold on. Hey guys, let's go candy shopping. There it is. Come on. Who's the best radio show in the world? Grab Ziggy. Ziggy's still shopping. Ziggy needs some kind of mint candy under his armpit. Pepper mint daddy, I mean. Pepper mint daddy. Come on, let's go eat our candy. We got candy in the candy store. My diabetes is dead. There's thousands of people here. Hey, you guys listen up. It's an opiate thing. It's an absolutely madness. Absolutely mad. Hey, Mark. Mark. On your way to the candy store, get everybody candy. Candy. All right, we're all started yelling candy. Candy. Candy. Candy. Candy. Candy. Candy! Candy! Candy! Oh, I'm having a look from the lady with the candy stuff. Good! She is not happy. Well, get her... Hey, hey... Can we come over and shop in here? Yeah! Oh, wait a minute. He's not very happy. Here comes the voice. I'm buying some candy. Hey, Mark, get the candy lady on the phone. Give it up. All right, hold on a second. Oh, there she goes. We've got to get them chanting candy. Hey, can we talk to you for a second? Yeah. All right, hold on. Here she is. What's your name? Peter. Now, what do you think about the homeless people shopping in the store here? Nothing wrong with it. No problem. Good answer. There's been a rumor that they didn't want us in the candy store, but that's not true? No, that's not true at all. Hey, Mark. More than welcome to come in. They're people. Everybody's a person. Hey, Mark. Well, there you go. What's that, guys? Mark, let Jay Moore talk to the fine candy lady. All right, hold on. Do you want to speak to Jay Moore? He's a famous man. Hello. What's your name, miss? Amy. Amy, we heard that you were going to physically throw out everybody from the candy store if they went over there. Not the people involved, but if 500 people come in here, we don't have the capacity for 500 people to come in this store. Are you a sumo wrestler? How are you going to throw out 500 people? That's not the point. No, the point is 500 people, you should be happy for the baby. They will not fit in my store. Well? They will not fit in my store. Hey, this is Opie and Anthony, baby. You watch. They'll fit themselves in that store. Don't get on the wrong side of Opie and Anthony. They'll wedge themselves in there like those kids in the phone booths in the 50s. Amy, you sound like a sensible gal. I say you just start... I try. You got candy canes, right? Yes. Just start throwing them out to the masses. Throw them out to the masses? Amy, how old are you? 28. Do you have a triangle or a mohawk? Oh, my God. Come on, answer the question. Triangle, mohawk, or Abraham? Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle. Triangle, mohawk, or Abraham Lincoln? Oh, my God. Come on, honey. Oh, my God. Come on, baby. I can't believe you just said that. I can't believe I'm attracted to you and I never even saw you before. No, you wouldn't be, trust me. Oh, yes, I would be. You'd be surprised, Amy. No, you wouldn't be. You worked at a candy store. I should probably dip you into the process, you know what I mean? No, no. I'm skipping into the image story. No, not quite. Triangular, mohawk. Well, then maybe you got to get a little triangle going and that'll help your... Ha, ha, ha. Triangular, mohawk. Hey, don't get high on your own supply. Are you overweight? Is that what you're talking about? I don't want to talk to you anymore. Ha, ha, ha. She probably is. Hey, Mark. Yeah? Is he a heifer? Yes. He has a mustache. All right, Mark. We'll check in with you soon, all right? All right, guys. Triangle, mohawk, or mustache? I think you're going to get your mustache on out. Let's check it out. All right. I think you're going to get your mustache on out. I think you're going to get your mustache on out. Yeah. What's your favorite thing? I mean, you know, you're going to get your mustache on out. I'm not going to get my mustache on out. I'm not going to get my mustache on out. We'll check in with you soon, all right? All right, guys. Triangle, mohawk, or mustache? I think you're going to get your mustache on out. Let's check in with Ben real fast. He's at another section of the mall. Ben, what's going on? We have like three cell phones going on. Team reporting. Ben, oh, now he's on this line. You got to get guys in the hell. I'm outside Chardios Mall. Where? I'm looking down on the parking lot. There's a huge crowd of about 500 people. Oh, we're going down. Hey, Ben. Yeah, what's up? We got you on the air, man. What's going on? I'm here with Thomas. We just got some candy out of the candy shop. And so... We're looking to get a Walkman here. But none of our listeners come through the mall, so nobody knows when we can get a Walkman. Oh, really? When are we going to Macy's to get the perfume? Yeah, we need you guys to go to Macy's to get the perfume, man. Macy's? Okay, we'll go to Macy's. To get the free perfume and stuff, you know? Yeah, we did that in Versace. We went into Versace and got some cologne on us. And so we'll make our way to Macy's and we'll give you a call. Ben, how crazy is that? Is it at that mall? It's a big mall. It's a big mall. It's a big mall. It's a big mall. It's a big mall. It's a big mall. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's. We're going to Macy's.

Hey, how you doing? I'm out of here with LB and Anthony. Yeah, I'm here real fast. Yeah, listen fellas, I've got to applaud you. I teach consumer behavior and marketing at a northern New Jersey upper-crust college and I've got students in my class that walk around with their pinkies extended all the time. This is the best thing I have ever seen done to support what Thomas Jefferson said that we're all created equal. All right. I've got to compliment you guys and I'm going to drill it into my people in class and let them know that you guys have done a real public service for society. All right, thank you, Dennis. Applaud it. Thomas Jefferson said that all people are created equal and go to the barn and have sex with the slaves. That was the second half of that quote. And let me get some of that black tail. The black man will ring the bell. There you go, Zerl. All right, you guys want to check in with the Justice Department. Make sure everything's on the up and up. Juliana. Hello. What's up? I am quite teed off actually. Why? Just because I think it is so unfair that there's actually troopers out there looking for you guys to stop this. They've been pretty cool. Well, and at any time. Wait, wait, wait. I do have to stop you. I got to tell you, man, all the cops and the troopers have been nothing but cool so far. Yeah. If you guys go in any store and they ask you to leave, I am fully prepared to back you guys up. Look at these people. Am I wrong or right? You have a constitutional right. It's peaceful assembly. It is the Civil Rights Act of 1973 and they have to serve you no matter race, color, religion. I hate that act. Why do you hate that act? I don't know. There are some places I want to go and not be bothered by certain types. I want to be there when you guys do your remote from Harlem. We are going to do that. I'll be there. All right, Juliana. We'll keep close to the show. We might need you from time to time, all right? I am because it's, you know, it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, I mean, just because people are doctors, attorneys or whatever, doesn't mean we don't have a sense of humor. All right, good. And just because everybody exploits somebody. I mean, if you watch a talk show or whatever, there's people who exploit it on that. And you guys are doing a good thing, personally, I think. All right, thank you, Juliana. Okay, take care. We'll talk to you soon. Okay, bye. Thanks a lot. Let's check in with Psycho Mark one more time here. Psycho Mark. Yeah, I'm in Macy's right now. Really? Really pissed off ladies to see at the makeup counter. Oh, really? She's not happy. Let me talk to her. Let's talk to her. Let's Jay Moore talk to her. Tell her Jay Moore. Hold on, hold on. Let me try and. Jay Moore is really good at smoothing things over. Jay Moore. Smoothing things over. Jay's great at smoothing things over. We're just trying to find, guys, this is unbelievable. People are just absolutely amazed. We are at Short Hills Mall, just in case you're to it again. That's where the homeless bus stopped today. And you should stop by. That's right. It's not too late. We'll be there for at least another hour. Say hello. Help the homeless shop. There is plenty of room. I'm going to have to call you guys back. I can't seem to find her. All right. I'll call you right back. All right. Thanks. We're going to the makeup counter having one of the guys try on lipstick. Yeah, like one of those makeovers that they do. A quick little makeover. Brian is somewhere at Short Hills Mall. Brian? Hey, what's up? What's going on? Oh man, this is nuts out here, dude. Really? Yeah, I wanted to call up, see if you can get Rick to take him into Louis Vuitton. The woman just walked up the stairs past me and my buddy Anthony. Yeah. And she's pissed. She's screaming and yelling. She's like, I don't want these f'ing people up here. There's like a hundred people outside. I don't want it. This is nuts. You know, it's funny. They're all mouthing off like that. They don't want the people here and f' them. And if they come in here, I'll throw them out. And then when you confront them and talk to them, oh no, they are all welcome. They read off the same script. Everyone is welcome. We are fine with anyone you want to bring in. When we walked in, this woman was like, what's going on? What's going on? And my buddy Anthony goes, oh, it's from a radio show. They're bringing homeless people in. They gave them a hundred bucks to shop. The woman looks them dead in the face and goes, and they brought them here? I think it's hilarious that all our listeners are in the mall with just cell phones all over the damn place. Meme coverage. Meme coverage on the Open Anthony show. Everyone's family with you guys. Hell yeah. This is great. This is the best show I've ever heard of in my life. Thank you. Thank you, Jay. Jay Moore, our only Hollywood friend. I know. I have nothing to plug. I got no dates. That's good. Next time we're in LA, would you like to show us around? Absolutely. Are we on that level yet? Oh, absolutely. Yeah? You guys, we'll do a remote from my house. Live broadcast. Have some of my wife's hot friends come by. That could be cool. Yeah. We could actually make that happen. That would be funny. Can we bring some of our homeless friends? No. State your house. I don't believe in that amendment that lady brought in. I don't want a bunch of freaky people in my house. I got a Rottweiler, so she'll sniff him out for me. I won't even have to get off the couch. The dog will be like, you're out, you're out. She'll sniff Anthony. Anthony might not make it in. I might not make it in. Anthony might have a weird smell to him. The dog might get rid of Anthony. Oh, man. I want to keep taking breaks, but these guys are checking in like crazy. Psycho Mark, you got anything else to report? Yeah, I'm right. You know, it's really funny, but cell phones seem to work perfectly inside this mall, but anywhere else you go on the goddamn state, they don't work. Yeah. But anyhow, I have a woman here at the... Man, what do you think about what's going on outside? Would you like to speak to Jay Moore on the phone? He wants to talk to you. You don't want to talk at all? I have no comment. No comment? No comment whatsoever. You snooty bitch, you're a snooty bitch. You haven't had an orgasm since the 80s at Ed Woodson. You better use it. Jay Moore wants to speak to you. You don't want to talk to him? No. All right. All right. Well, I... I'll tell him he wants to talk to Tom Cruise in a movie. I'm sure he'll scream. Ask her when was your last orgasm. Jay Moore wants to know when was your last orgasm. Jay Moore wants to know when was your last orgasm. Oh, I'm not getting a good look. This is not a good look. She's having one right now. There's an alarm going off right now. We've got an alarm going off. Yes, there's an alarm. Oh, no. Everybody chanting alarm, alarm, alarm, alarm. I am going to do what I did at the hospital. I'm going to disappear. All right. We'll check in with you soon, man. All right. There's an alarm going off. There's an alarm going off? Oh, brother. I don't have enough hands to high-five as many people as I want to high-five her. Why can't we just shop without alarms going off? All right. We are so late. We've got to take a quick break and we'll be back. Stay there. Whee! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! The O.B. and Anthony homeless shopping spree was like the day.

Jay Moore is sitting in once again today. Helping us out. Whee! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Homeless, homeless, homeless! You've got to love setting the homeless loose in an exclusive mall. New York is the best homeless. LA has the worst homeless people. First of all, they're tan. I don't like any homeless guy that's got a better tan than me. If they were like, would you have a homeless Olympics? New York would send over the cream team. You could have a whole decathlon. The box lift, the cart push, the ticket dump in your pants, the nap. The nap. The squeegee relay. How many winter coats you can put on your back in the summertime. Then you just have diving for fun. The nap should be in freezing conditions where the temperature slowly goes down and you check to see if the homeless are still having rapid eye movement. Yeah, no, it's a nap slash nod. You guys have a fat homeless guy. I don't get it. We had a bunch of fat homeless guys. But how can you be fat and homeless? I know. Where do you get your food? Come on, you're homeless. We bought a few chips and grapes. We met them all before they got on the bus. That must have been great. The first few that came in were better dressed than Aunt and I. And we started getting bummed. Yeah, I understand. But you're like, right. I'm dressed better than Oprah. Yes, you are. I have a cute little sweater on. And then the ringers arrived. The ringers? Oh, man. These guys were half the Ziggy and the Indian guy. Let's check in with Rick. He's in the middle of the mall. Short Hills Mall. It's the homeless shopping spree. What's going on, Rick? Come on, dude. Open. Some guy just closed his shop. This WAP store saw us coming and he closed his gate. He won't let us in. What kind of store is it, Rick? It's a store that's closed. It's a store that's closed.

Hey, but Rick... He's got a teddy. It's teddy time! It's teddy time! Little uncontrollable of it. There are so many people in the mall, it's getting hard to hear these guys now. They can't hear us. Yeah, what's up Rick? Yeah, we're heading over to Victoria's Secret. I think they're thinking of trying something in a flashless number. Oh, look at the women. They're looking at us. Horrified. Hi ladies, do you work here? Do you want to help Ziggy and some of our guys find some laundry for the women in their lives? What do you need? Sir, what do you need? What's up, where's Ziggy?

I'm going to yell at her. Let me talk to the manager. We're not going to take photographs. We just want to help our guys shop. Is the manager a guy or a girl? And I think one of the sales girls wants to wow Ziggy. Yeah. We've got to get some wowing going in the middle of Shore Hills Mall. What's wowing going? Mount Wednesday. Hey, are there any ladies that want to wow the guys in our group here? Very calm. Mount Wednesday. Yeah. This is in the middle of a frigging mall. Yeah. Not any mall. Yeah. Shore Hills Mall. You're the guy. He goes, nothing. I think Ziggy is going to see some boobies today. Oh, yeah. Is the manager a man or a woman? It's a woman, if he's hot. Let me talk to her. Tell her, J-More, if for some reason, he's not happy. He's not happy. He's just angry that I'm not happy with the way he is. He's just angry about it. He's just angry that I'm not happy. He's just angry about it. He's just angry that I'm not happy. He's just angry about it. I think she ran when they started screaming. Knock on the door. Let me find her. Hey where is your manager? Tracy? Jay Moore wants to talk to her. Okay where is Tracy? Jay Moore wants to talk to her. Oh look Snoop is buying some fragrance products for the woman in his life. Hey there you go. For the woman in his life. They are scratchy down in the park. Every David Tells joke he goes I just went to this after hours club called the Port Authority. It was urine night. See he is funny doing David Tells material. Do you want to talk to Jay Moore from action? The big Hollywood star? The big Hollywood star. Oh she is not very happy. Hand her the phone. She doesn't even want to take the phone. She is calling security now. We are going to get some panties on her head. Alright Jiggy put some panties on your head. No no no put them on his crotch. You can try them on right there in the store town. Alright guys put on some panties here. Hey Chief don't light anything on fire dude. I need Chief to try on a nice blanno pajama set. You want to try on some pajama set Chief? Me try on pajama. How about the panties for the white? Hey Chief ask him if he wants to try on the sales girl. He is picking up some large breasted woman right next to him. I think he was doing a breast dance or something because those things are growing. Holy Christ. Get Jiggy a banana hammer. Sorry Jiggy. I didn't know you took a napozoa. Oh God. I think we got Bush. Sounds like we got Bush. As you can tell the Chief has gotten wild. Oh you think he got wild. Hey hey hey hey. It is glorious day for the Indians. We have a bonus. He was doing the breast dance and it worked. Hey Rick you are the best. I am not even mad at Rick anymore. How could you be after that? It is just a zoo at the Short Hills Mall. This is the best show I have ever seen. Every time I come on it is better. The first time I came a girl had a vagina pierced right in front of my face. The second time I came I got cousins tongue kissing and bumping donuts right in front of me. Now you have a Chief getting boobs whipped out at him. I haven't even had that. In the middle of Short Hills Mall. Let's check in with Psycho Mark. He is at another part of the mall. Oh my God. They are spiraling downwards very quickly. Why? What is the problem? We were just all in Victoria's Secret. There had to be 150 guys in there screaming whip it out. We heard that because we had Rick on the phone for that. Rick was beautiful. The manager of the store ran to the phone to call security. It was just outrageous. Guys were grabbing panties left and right. It was unbelievable. Of course his dick comes in to try to show us their cans and that just destroyed everything. People just don't know what to do here. There is an absolutely amazing crowd. It is a lot of fun we are having here at the mall. Is anybody asking any of the homeless guys to maybe sign up for a credit card for a discount before they buy their tickets? I guess not. Are you on our mailing list? What is your address? 5th Street. Is that an apartment or a residence? It is not a 5th Street baby. Hey Mark is the crowd growing? What? Is the crowd growing? It has been growing like every minute. I told you. I said it was going to double. There are about 120 people showing up. There are people holding up signs across the way here. Homeless celebrate Christmas too. This guy says, The guy says, He says, And it is just a real scream. We have a lot of fans here. It is just unbelievable. Alright Mark hold on the line because this is just in. The state troopers are on the way to the mall. Hold on. I am going to go back to you in a sec. Matt your next on FM Talk. What's going on? This is a pisser guys come on. I am on route 24 just outside of Short Hills Mall. and I just started going the other way about four trooper cars with their lights on screaming towards the mall. I could see the riot gear rolling out already. Oh no. There's no illegal activity going on. No, it's just a smelly ziggy and they're just having fun. The panties over the head, you know, that's what did it I think. Alright man. Maybe nudity, they got arrested. Good luck guys. Thank you. They should arrest a girl that took out her can. Right. I'm well within my rights to be here, Cam. Uh oh, she's shooting me in the eye. Hey Mark. Yeah. Alright, it's getting crazy, huh? Oh, it's absolutely mayhem. It is complete mayhem. It's just, you've never, I've never seen anything like it in my life. The best was the guy who closed his door and wouldn't let us in. So we all started screaming, asshole. It sounded like the Yankee game, yeah. It was rare. Hey, I got an idea. There's got to be a sporting goods store there, right? Yeah. Why don't you guys buy a soccer ball and get a little game going? Yeah, let's go buy a soccer ball everybody and play a game downstairs. Uh oh, the security's coming over to grab me. To grab you. Excuse me. Hey, what's that guy's problem? Hold on, hold on. The manager said Joe said if you guys go in there they'll buy everything. What's that? Joe's the restaurant that said they'll buy everything. Joe's in Joe's restaurant said they'll buy everybody's food. Joe's Bar and Grill said they'd buy everybody's food. Hey, look at that. So how about that? Hey everybody, Joe's coming through. Everybody, Joe's for some free food. Go, go, go, go, go, go. I love a mom. Don't you just love a mom? It's insanity. It's just insanity. Oh, awesome. Hopefully the state troopers won't be here shortly. We'll check back in with you. Check in soon, man. See if you can get everybody to chant bring back action. Bring back action. Mike, what's up? What's going on, pal? I tell you what, I've been listening to you guys since Boston. I went to school up there. I have not heard of Funny U Show. Oh, cool. And I think that Jay's just adding that little fine. Oh, yeah. Without a doubt. And Rick's even wanted to be here today. Hey, I just wanted to say, you kick ass. Sorry, pal. I've been watching you since Saturday Night Live, too. And who thought Rick called him like a big dick and said, stay away forever. Hey, Jay, I think you should kick Rick's ass anyway. I'm playing club. I think you could take him. You know, I think I could take him, too. But when he had that funny look in his eye when we brought up the idea of the fight, I went, uh-oh. He got that Hispanic evil eye, right? Yeah, but he's got like some cancer. It's not going to be like a one to like William Shatner Star Trek fight. I'm going to have to like get in the trenches. Like, I'm actually going to have to get hit with him. Yeah, you might. You will. So I'm going to actually have to take a couple shots. I don't think you're quite smart, though. I just wanted to let you guys know that this show really kicks ass today. You guys are the best. Thank you, Mike. I'll be at Caroline's in February. I got a plug in two months. I'll be at Caroline's in February. Actually, what Jay Moore's plugging today is Jim Brewer's appearance at Rascals tonight. Is it Rascals? I think so. I'm telling everybody listening right now, when you're done with Short Hills Mall, you've got to see Jim Brewer, one of the funniest men alive, who's mad at me right now. Jim, if you're listening, come on. Can't we all get along? I'm sorry I went over my time at the Orpheum Theater in Boston. I wish I saw that live. Comics Come Home happening Sunday on Comedy Central. It was amazing. I went out and they had a band and they started playing Hoodie Love to bring me out. And I just didn't remember my first joke because it was like 3,000 people in the room. It was like 3,000 people and they were going bananas. So I just started singing Hoodie Love. I had never sung before in front of a crowd like, Who do you love? Who do you love? It was in the Hank Williams Senior version. And then I was supposed to go on first and they had a problem. Their audio didn't match. I don't understand this business. Their audio didn't match their video. Something was wrong in their control truck. But Dennis Leary is the host and he doesn't know it. They have no way of telling him. So he goes, Please welcome Jay Moore. And then he gets up and goes crazy. And they tell me, Don't go out. Don't go out because we can't use it. Unless you want to go out and come back. I go, No, no, no. So then Dennis is standing there like a schmuck like Jay Moore. Jay Moore. Jay the Fabulous Jay. And then he comes back and he goes, What's going on? And then tell them. It takes them an hour to fix the truck. So they're just parading out all the comics that they don't intend to put on the TV show. So I go on like seventh. And the crowd is mad. Because it's about 40 minutes before even a comic came out. And Dennis goes, All right, how's everybody doing? Still in a good mood? No! Actually in the Orpheum Theater, like the Carnegie Hall of Horses. They're like, No, no! And I'm like, Oh my God. So they send out like five people. And then when it came my turn, I was like, 10 minutes my ass. And then I started cursing and just going nuts. I was doing Al Green, Eddie Vedder. I was doing walking. And then Brewer had to follow me. And I guess his first couple of jokes, they were still kind of talking and acting like idiots. But Brewer, anybody can pull it together. It's Brewer. And I'm not kissing his ass. Look at that. We know how funny Brewer is. Yeah, he is. Jim, you're next on FM Talk. What's up? Hey, they're carrying around signs now that say, Let the Homeless Shop and the Homeless Celebrate Christmas Too. And they misspelled your name, Opie. What is it? Hoppy? They spelled it Hoppy. That's okay. Two P's? That's the common misspelling, Opie. Thank you. We have a US Marshal on line three. Oh. Rob, what's up? Hi, yes. I'm calling from the United States Marshal Service in New York, New Jersey. Yeah. And I just have to give you guys a message from them. You guys suck. All right. No, I'm just, I also live in that area and they can't close the doors on you. All right. Now, they've been cool so far. No, but on the bottom of the doors in the Short Hills Mall, there are signs that say these doors must remain open and unlocked during business hours. Okay. So, just let you guys know they can't close any doors on you. All right. Thank you, Rob. All right. Bye. We needed a Marshal to tell us that, I guess. I'm hoping that Christopher Walken is going to, you know. Oh, gee, make the guy a big Hollywood star now. Stop by the show today, you know. Look, maybe everybody Victoria's Secret. My friends, they want to shop. Buy underpants for them and theirs. Look at Ziggy. Four feet tall laying down. Let the man buy crassus panties. Maybe a nice flannel and some. Look, your manager's uptight. There's nothing you can do to stop us. Look, we're a mess. Opie and Anthony, 102.7 Talk Radio. Forget it. Why listen to music? You own the album. What are you going to listen to? Rock and roll. You own that record. Put it on 102.7. Listen to the homeless. It's a riot, baby. It's a riot. En masse. A peaceful assemblage of people. Smelly. White. Black. But they all smell. White, black. Puerto Rican. No Chinese. They could care on. They take care of their own. They don't let them get homeless. When was the last time you saw a Chinese homeless man? Never. Never. Never. Never. They invite them in with open arms. Not like the whites and the blacks. They say, don't come home. You can go to Chinatown. If you're Chinese, down on your luck. You can wash dishes. Go to a cock fight. You're never on the outs as a Chinaman. Too bad. Unless you have red hair. If you're 300 pounds and have red hair, then they don't like you. You're not like a 300 pound redheaded Chinese man. It's strange. Really. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. It's strange. Really. Go to Short Hills Mall. I command you. No one will know. No one will know. Opie, Anthony, 1027. Bravo. Christopher Walken, everyone. Stop and ride. If you're in your car in a 50 mile radius of Short Hills Mall, get there. Oh my God. Rise up. I want Opie and Anthony to be more famous than me. All right, Psycho Mark back on the phone. What's up, Psycho Mark? Hi, guys. We're just about starting to wrap things up. We're standing outside of FAO Schwartz. We're going to sing a Christmas carol for you guys. We're going to have everybody start singing. We're going to sing Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Anybody? Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. What about Santa? Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Somebody does the acapella. Louder. Louder. Hey, Mark Yes? He can get an Opie and Anthony chant going. Opie and Anthony chant? Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. We have a state trooper on the line. Hold on. Joe. Yes. Are you a state trooper? Yes I am. Really? Listen, I just want to warn you guys. I actually heard they're putting out a SWAT team. Yes, yes. Okay. I'm not kidding. It's coming out of Troop A of the Garden State Park. Okay, sure thing. Oh, are you joking? I'm not kidding. A SWAT team. What do you need a SWAT team for? They're not going in rides. They're going in to take them all in. They have two school bus size buses. What law have they broken? Yes, what law has been broken? I don't know. I'm trying to figure out. You're a lieutenant with the state police and you don't know what law they've broken. Because there isn't any law. You're so full of crap. You aren't even with us. That's the law being broken. You aren't a trooper. Where are you a trooper out of, Joe? Excuse me? Where are you a trooper out of? Springfield. And what barracks is that? L. Yes, sure. Alright. I believe them. But I want to know why. That's a lot of lawsuits. You start arresting people for no reason. That's a lot of bad press. You've got a lot of people out there chanting Opi and Anthony. Truthfully, guys, I'm all for it. It's not like a Farrakhan thing where they start beating up cops and taking their lives. Maybe they'll fart or stink the place up. They're shopping for crying out loud. If they're in there, the only way I can see is if they're in there without a license. It's kind of like a protest. No, it's not. They're in there with signs and they're screaming and yelling. But that's the general public. That's not the Opi and Anthony sponsored homeless excursion. The Opi and Anthony sponsored group, they are shopping. That is a right you have to shop. It's a mall. Where else are they supposed to go? People need Christmas gifts. These people are shopping. People holding up signs and taking their breasts out. We have no control over that. Absolutely. That has nothing to do with the Opi and Anthony program. Guys, I don't think you're doing anything wrong. Why don't you go down there and stand up? I don't know how to call and warn you. That's all. Thank you, Joe. I think you should go down there and stand up to your brethren. You tell those troopers to bring gas masks. Not for tear gas or anything because Vicky really stinks. I know. You guys are starting to play NWA. We're being told to move by the head of the wall here. Why? On the wet ground? Because we're disrupting traffic. Traffic of what? You are the traffic. I know, but what am I going to do? Sit in space? Let me talk to them. They should all sit down and hold hands. Let me see if I can find him. He disappeared. He was all... Where are you guys right now? We are standing outside of the EFNAO Schwartz, right here in the mall, right outside of Brookstone. They want us to keep moving because we're causing too much of a ruckus. Pretty much everyone went home at this point, right? Everyone was just chanting, Spaz is gay! Spaz is gay! Spaz is a homeless guy? Oh my God! This place is nuts. Well, how are the homeless people doing? We haven't talked to them in a while. They're doing great. All of them have some great presence. They've all done some great stuff. Guy's got shoes. Guy's got some coats. Other guy's got some stuff for their lady friends. Cool. It's actually turned out to be a real big success. Hey Mark, it's Jay Moore. Listen to me very carefully. I'm listening. You are not breaking any laws. We just talked to a state trooper at a barracks L, Springfield, New Jersey, on the phone. They're sending a SWAT team to round you guys up into school buses, he told us. Jay Moore wants to talk to you on the phone. Would you like to talk to him? He doesn't want to talk to you, Jay. Tell him he has to. I have a constitutional right to know what's happening. Jay has a constitutional right to know what's happening. You want to talk to him real quick? He refuses to speak to you. He's a coward and he knows you guys are not breaking any laws. It's a piece. Maybe we should have a thousand people moon him. Now I'm getting pushed. Now you're being assaulted. Is this America or is this Russia? We're going back to the bus. No, no, no you're not. No you're not. Listen to me very carefully. I know the law. If he pushed you and you feel threatened, that is assault. That man's got the soul to you. I'm not joking. Jay knows he does it to the paparazzi all the time. You were not battered but if you felt threatened you were assaulted. That man cannot put his hands on you for standing in the mall. He told me to go the other way and you know what am I going to do? I have a great idea. Opie and Anthony, we're going to call the cops on him. There you go. Hey Mark, just go to another part of the mall at this point. We're heading out towards the other end of the mall right now. Bring them to the shop. Alright call back Mark. Go check that kid. Alright bye. We're so late we've got to take a break. Alright we're back. This is FM Talk at 1027. Talk you can't ignore. Opie and Anthony and Jay Moore everyone. Man. Who the hell is turning off their radio today man? What a day this has been huh? Our homeless to the mall excursion has been a huge success. Huge. People are pissed at us now because they can't even get in the parking lot of the Short Hills Mall. Yeah. We have taken over the mall basically. Wine checking with Rick? Hell yeah. Alright let's go back to the mall. Hey Rick. I haven't tried on Michael Jordan. Jordan smells good. Snoop, Snoop try on some of that Michael Jordan stuff. The new Michael Jordan stuff. They're trying on the cologne at Macy's I believe. Rick? Yeah. Yeah we're at Macy's we're trying on some men's fragrances. Alright. We're checking out some Hugo Boss and some Michael Jordan. Snoop smells like Michael Jordan after a double overtime loss. I think I get to keep the devil behind some Hugo Boss. And god damn it Ziggy's just running around. Where'd he go? Ziggy! They all point over there. It's so easy to keep track of you know. And that was the blind people. Hey Ziggy come here. Ziggy come here man. I've never caught something before. Alright. We had one of the guys here who was online and thought he wanted to buy the chief. The chief his cologne. Oh very nice. What's that guy on? A little Christmas present. That's nice. Hey come here. Ziggy come here man. How you feeling? You look a little tired. You look a little worn out. I'm tired of all the other mumbles. I'm pretty sluggish. Are they drinking the cologne? As you can tell the marble is very sluggish. Look at these slippery. Are they drinking the cologne? As you can tell the marble floors are slippery. Either that or the marble doors are muddily. I don't know what. It's one of the two. And believe me some of the Macy's people here are horrified. Oh I bet yeah. We got some flame flow security guys talking to us. Talking to what chief? Where's the guy that bought cologne for the chief? Huh? Where's the guy that bought cologne for the chief? Is he still around? Oh yeah what's your name dude? Jario. Jario. That's my brother. Oh okay Richard's his brother. Here he is. What's up O.O.N.X. Hey what's up? Jay Morris in the studio too. Good. That's good my brother just bought one of your buddies a chief from cologne. Here you go boy. Thank you very much. That's very nice. Christmas spirit. You're a good person. We got a lot of fans driving home. Let's keep the Christ in Christmas. Everyone working from the ledger driving home listening to us buy you people drinks. Over there. Thank you. Thanks for helping us out today. Alright no problem guys enjoy your holiday. Alright you too. You know one of the main ingredients in cologne Opie. Alcohol. Is alcohol. Once again the white man buying the Indian alcohol to try to keep him down. My wife Kitty. My wife Kitty drank an alcohoge. Kitty do cockus. Kitty do cockus man. Kitty do cockus cologne it comes with a bendy straw. Kitty do cocktail. Hey Rick. Yeah. We're back to you sorry what's up? You had a CFAO Schwartz. The women were gathering up their little white children and running for cover. As we came into the freaking store. We're buying some toys for the chief's kid. Chief's kid just in case you don't like it. Alright we're heading out now. Wouldn't that be cute to see little Ziggy doing the thing like in Big. Playing the piano thing. Jumping around. Playing a little tune on the piano thing. Probably lay down on it and take a nap. He could be Tom Stanks. He was exhausted. Alright Rick. What's going on? We're heading over to the fountain here. I think they're going to toss some change in the fountain. Toss Ziggy in. Toss Ziggy in. Let him get a little bath. I'm going to swim man. Let Ziggy get a little bath. Ziggy wants a bend in?

He reached it and he ran a quarter. Alright, very good. Wow. He's got a dime in. What is he? Zappy Duck? He's a happy miser. Alright. I tell you mine. How big is the crowd right now? It looks like a criminal for Christ sakes. I think the crowd died down. Has the crowd died down, Rick? The crowd is, well our crowd is a little quiet, but they're following in unison. Okay. They're following, we're making our way back to Houlihan's. Houlihan's is giving us some free food as we exit the mall in about 15 minutes. Alright. And we're going to be hitting the bus at 6 o'clock. Oh, very good. Alright. Alright, check in with us in a few minutes, alright? Guys, we'll talk to you later. Alright. Oh man. They're having fun. I'm so surprised they haven't been kicked out yet. I just had a great idea, because you've got to outdo yourself now. But that's always our problem. I got the next one. Alright. Ten different homeless people. Yeah. $200 a pop, you know, Atlantic City. Oh, nice. Can you see the look on a homeless guy's face when he pisses away $200? Or one guy just blows up all of it black. All of it on black. Letter Rye. One guy comes home with a grand apartment in Brooklyn Heights. You see a homeless guy at a blackjack table, losing money. Oh man. Rob, what's up? Double down. Come on, double down. Hey Rob. How you doing? Alright, what's going on? Not much. Good. I don't know if I would say personal friend, but I have many photos with Ziggy, whose real name is supposedly Bobby. Okay. Yeah, he hangs out on Bleaker Street. I forget what street that's between, but if you're familiar with the club Life, he hangs out across from there. It's Sullivan and McDougal. Yeah, right in between there. Right around the corner from the Boston Comedy Club. He's a great guy. The first time I met him, he was sleeping in front of the pizza place there in a box. He was sitting in the box using a lounge chair. One of his favorite things, he loves chess and he likes looking at chess pieces. If you can get him somewhere where you can see some chess pieces, he'll probably get a real good kick out of that. Alright, cool. One more thing real quick. The last rumor had is that a lot of people in that area, even he'll say that he was the actual writer of the song Mr. Sandman. So you might want to ask him about that. Alright, we'll ask him. I'm sure we'll get a good answer on that one. Alright, great show. Hey, thank you. Have a good one. Alright, bye. Jason, you're next at FM Talk. What's going on? Hello. What's up, Jason? You're next. Hey, what's going on, guys? I want you to know, 12 years ago I was working down at Short Hills Mall through a temporary agency. They see a black man coming in, like 20 to 30 vets mixed in with Latinos. The first thing they say is, oh wow, it's getting dark in here. The way they treat us during the whole holiday season, working there, they treat us like we are garbage. There you go. Yeah, and they were looking down at homeless people going around in there just asking for something, you know, spare change, food, something to eat. And they would turn their backs on you like you were the worst piece of crap in the world. But you were there working though, right? Yeah, I was working through a temporary agency. So you were there making a living? Yeah, but even though I was making a living, you still were treated like you were garbage. Oh man. Yeah, like you were garbage. They were going to hide you in such a race thing also as well. They just saw you as a black person and they treated you like you were garbage. You know what, when you work there, just don't pay your taxes. They don't like you so much. You're such garbage, you don't have to pay garbage taxes. Yeah, you know what you guys should do to get even is you have them all break wind at once. Break wind? Yeah, all at once. They don't need to break wind, trust me. No, they stink anyway. Yeah, but they're for the store. That will teach them all in the store to have to deal with it. All right, Jason, I got to cut you off. Psycho Mark's back on the line. All right, you guys are best. All right, thank you. All right, Pat from Oakdale with an instant feedback real quick. Jay is cracking me up. Anyone on the phone, bitches, anyone want to talk to him? Rick, there's a cop here and Jay, let me talk to him. Mark, there's a trooper here and Jay, let me talk to him. All right, um, Christ is here and he'd like to say, Jay, let me talk to him. That's right. Where's Yahweh? Put Yahweh on. I've waited 2,000 years to talk to the guy. Psycho Mark, what's going on? They just moved the bus on us. A bunch of troopers and cops just pulled up and they told us, they told the bus to move so the bus just drove off. We're all standing here. You're going to be homeless. Hey, I read something in the instant feedback. The guy said he was listening to the scanner and they said that they were going to make the bus move because it was in a fire lane. Yeah. They just did that. The bus just disappeared and we have no idea where it went. Ah. So what are you, outside the mall right now? Yeah, we're outside the mall. There's got to be about 30 or 40 people just out here. Rick's still inside with Ben and they're working their way out. And as a matter of fact, a bunch of people here have bought some stuff and some gifts just for the homeless people. This guy, one guy, bought a jacket for Ziggy. Ah, very cool. So, there's some nice, you know, some nice feelings here before Christmas and people are very nice, you know, except for the police. All right. Well, let us know when you find the bus, okay? Yeah, that'd be a great thing. I'd like to come back to the city. Okay. All right, man. See you guys. Bye. How could that be your undoing? A celebration like that and someone parks the bus in a freaking fire lane. And when we got there, there was plenty of parking. Eric, what's up? Oh, Nick. Yeah. What's going on? I'm outside the mall. It's crazy, man. I'm trying to get in here. Yeah. There's people all over the place and everybody seems to be listening to you because everybody is dying in their car trying to get in here. Oh, my God. It is crazy. Right on. You know what exit they're going to be at? Ah, I don't know. I don't know what's happening now. Just keep listening to the radio. Oh, my God. It is hilarious. You guys rule, man. I've been listening to the show all day. The best show you've ever done. All right. Thank you. All right. All right. Bye. My phone's actually, Marco, just got blown past. I know. Rocket ship. It sounds like McGuire passing Maris. Boom. God. Roger Hood. They got a Bruno Mali store over there? Someone said tell them to go to Bruno Mali and try on the shoes just like OJ. Hey, Rick. Yo. What's up? What's happening, guys? I have bad news for you. The bus has been moved. They can't find it. They can't find it. Yeah, it was in a fire lane. Oh, jeez. They better not have. The bus driver is listening, you know, to go back. Oh, look at this. We're at Bloomingdale. Yeah. Bloomingdale and the fine people of Bloomingdale have already packed bags for our group. Oh, very nice. T-shirts, hats, and cookies. Really? We have Norma, the general manager. Yep. And the entire staff here at Bloomingdale. Come on up, guys. Come get your stuff. That's fantastic. It's like they're in the Bloomingdale. It's like Halloween and Christmas at the same time. I think they're just paying them off. Give it to them at the door and then it's like, okay, move on. Move along. You don't have to come in. How about we do a little jingle bells for the people at the... Yeah. Here we go. And now for the voiceover. You guys ready? Ready? One, two, three. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. All that fun is to ride a one horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. All that fun is to ride a one horse open sleigh. There's one chick there. She's gotta shut up. Hey Rick. Yeah. Park Avenue Chiropractic. They're somewhere in the mall. They want to give some of the homeless guys free massages. Alright, we'll try and find them. Oh my god, come on. I swear to god, they sent us a fax. We are offering the bums free massages and spinal adjustments at our office. Alright, we're heading there now. We'll talk to you guys later. Alright, thank you. Bye. Bye. This is the funniest radio I've ever heard. Hey Chuck. Yo, what's up man? Chuck was supposed to be on the trip with the guys, but his wife wouldn't let him go. I'm so pissed man. Your show has changed my life. For the first time I have realized that I'm really married. And not only that, I'm definitely pussy with man. My wife wouldn't let me go. I can't believe I'm uttering these words. My wife would not let me go. We had to go buy a Christmas tree instead. The Vortabix. Hey. You're out man. Hey, hey, hey, hey, you got Marco's number? I knew I should have gone gay. I'm telling you right now. You should have man. You know what you're missing. What's that? You know what? I mean nothing. You know the funny thing is, I'm Jewish. Oh yeah, I'm a black Jewish guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very nice. And now I have a dead goyum tree in my living room. How hilarious is that man? Oh my god, this is great man. You know what the second thing is? Yeah. You know, I tell her, look, let's go. We can go together. Right. And she's like, well where are they? I'm like the Short Hills Mall. She's like, you know damn well we can't afford to shop at the Short Hills Mall. So here's my life. I'm pussy whipped and homeless guys shop at better retail outlets than I am. Chuck, with that I gotta let you go. The guys are checking in again. Alright guys. Alright man. Later. Rick, what's going on? Guys, we have Santa Claus from the North Side. Oh, we're here guys. You're with Santa? Okay, how you doing pal? Hey Santa. Yes, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you Santa. Thank you. Hello. Hey, are you taking pictures with the homeless guys? We're having a ball here. We're having a ball here. It's great. You're going to be taking pictures with some of our homeless friends? We're going to have to take some pictures if we can, you know. He's loaded. It's possible. I think it would be great. We're going to take some pictures. Okay. I've been drinking Biggie's cologne. This is a great treat for all these guys. A great treat. Jesus man. Hey, get some pictures. We're going to take some pictures of Santa and the guys and then head back over to Whoahead. I cannot wait to see these pictures man. I've got to see them. The Chief is running for Santa. Oh cool. Rick, I'm going to check in with Ben and I'm going right back to you. Stay right there, alright? Alright, you got it Ben. I'm going to make good white scalp. Alright, Ben's at another part of the mall. Ben, what's going on? Hey Ben. Uh oh, it's phone scrapping. It's coming better now. We're at Whoahead. The lovely staff of Whoahead has provided us with some nice chicken wings as we get ready to exit the mall. My God, that's insulting. Keep the bows and make a hat. They moved the bus. They're trying to get us out. They're trying to kick us out of the mall. They made us move the bus but we don't know where the bus is so we're getting ready to exit. Alright, you can't tell the cops you can't exit if you don't have a ride home. You don't want the homeless people to catch a cold. What is it with homeless people and their immune system? They sleep on the sidewalk with their underpants. If I don't get eight hours of sleep I've got a sore throat. These guys are like living, they sleep on a rock in their underpants wearing an eye patch and a diaper. It's snowing out. The guy's got ripped muscles. I'm going to be homeless. Alright, feds. You all got old ladies. They're all buying gifts for their old ladies. How's the homeless guy, hey, how do you like my dumpster? Exactly. They're buying little gifts for their ladies. You want to go back to my bag? You're brutal, man. It's so freaking large. Atlantic City, homeless. You've got to be real quiet if you hit the casino. They'll break some arms. Alright, Rick, what's up? Rick. Hey Rick. Alright, there he goes. Who's next? Where's Snoke? Oh, they're getting on Santa's lap. Oh. Chief's getting on Santa's lap. Chief. Actually, his name's Gray Wolf. Yeah, Gray Wolf. Gray Wolf. I bet the cop wouldn't have handcuffed him, boy. Right. He would have had some like, okie-ponokie move on him. Hey Rick. Alright guys, you ready? One, two, three. Ah. What is this? Just smiling. I think that was a homeless version of cheese. I believe they're getting a group picture, Anthony. Yeah. So they can cherish this day at the Short Hills Mall. I just picture a guy laying underneath a pile of papers, winter wind blowing, with a little Polaroid picture of him and Santa flopping in the cold breeze. That's the outro. Remembering his little face. Huh? He's taking pictures of him. Oh, ok. The sad thing is these guys, after this day of lunch, they gotta go back to like a stoop house. Yeah. Man, I remember one day I went shopping. That was the best day of my life. You should have seen me. Michael Jordan Cologne, Nike sneakers, hula hand chicken wings. Man, I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. I was living high in the hog. Them little Dames. I was at the Sandman. Yeah, Rick? What's up? The White Man. Stolen from it. All right. We just got Snow, Ziggy, and Keith to get pictures with Santa Claus. Bravo. Hey, Rick. Some guy called and said that Ziggy is actually Jackie Wilson. Well, that was a rumor. But I don't know if it's true. All right. We saw it with Mickey Rooney for a second. Mickey Rooney in Bill. No, he's an off street. Well that was a rumor but I don't know if that's true. We saw it with Mickey Rooney for a second. Mickey Rooney and Bill. No he's an Australian. Wow he does look like Mickey Rooney from Bill. I look like Bill, I got good teeth and regular good hair. Bill, then he started kicking me in the gut. I have Bill's coffee shop now. Kick me in the gut. I don't want to go back to that place no more. I got bad chicken in the gut. Oh boy chicken, oh boy. Hey Bill, you're awesome. Alright Rick we're going to let you go. Check in, we've got to take a quick break. Alright guys. You know the funniest part of that movie was when he was trying to call Barry, his friend, and the operator was asking for a number and he kept giving too many numbers. I need Barrymore 350-725-607-35. 35-18-9. He got confused with his lotto numbers. He looks like Mickey Rooney from Bill. Yes he does. He's like a little fat white guy. A weeble. But he does fall down. I'm actually going to roll out of here you guys. Really? I have like three things to do and then I blow them all off. You know what I can't imagine? I can't imagine that there's human beings in the Tristed area listening to something else right now. Like that boggles the mind. There's a 92 minute rock block you can listen to. Girl, the meaty cheesy boys are on right now on a station that ends in hundreds. Alright if you're leaving what do you want to plug? Aren't you playing a reindeer or something to play on TV? I want it known for the record. I came here to plug nothing. I know that. There's a friend of the show and one of the emails said why doesn't Jay plug all of the other reindeer. It's a Christmas special with Drew Barrymore produced it and she plays the reindeer and I play her owner. It's a really sweet cartoon. It's really funny. Mac Raining from The Simpsons. Let's not plug. Everyone is going to watch it anyway because Christmas Carol and Drew Barrymore. More importantly let's give it up for Opie and Anthony helping the homeless. Yes thank you Jay. And Jay you're welcome anytime. Don't let this little mix up with Rick earlier. Look how much fun we had. Today is not good. You know why? Because today was like Rick's day in the sun. He doesn't want any Jay Moore or Mr. Hollywood effing it up. He doesn't want to get blown up by the security guard and then have the security guard talk to me. I like the fat girl but the candy store is like no you wouldn't like this. I'm like I'll get in there and she's like oh no you wouldn't. I'm ugly. Man I could haunt a house. Let me lift up my gut and see what you can do. That's beautiful. Sorry Marco is in and cold. Well next time Jay. Next time. I love you guys. You're welcome anytime. I have the hotline number now so I might have to get you guys. I'm going to get you guys planning on the west coast. I'm going to start doing some remotes maybe for you.

I heard Brewer took flack and some guy called up and said hey Jay Moore was on. He got cousins. We were trying to get the Russian model topless. And we said hey man if Jay was here what would have happened to her. Is she going to be here tomorrow? Maybe that's why Brewer is pissed. She wants to be a lesbian. I can't get chicks naked like Jay. She wants to be a lesbian for a day so if you tune in to the show. I'll come in dressed up like Elijah Manali. There you go.

We're not suppose to bring more homeless back to New York. That defeats the purpose. That defeats the purpose. Oh the mayhem. Let me get this straight. We were hoping that a few of the homeless guys would stay in Jersey. That's helping the New York homeless problem. right but it turns out we're bringing one back with us. Yeah basically yeah. Oh my god come on. She's gonna do it again. Alright let's do this. How do they look Rick? Those are some huge cans. Are they? Wow. He's gonna be able to get a buck for each one of those cans.

Alright. Yeah. Oh my god. What a. You know you thought Christmas shopping was easy huh? Now we get to the saddest part. A lot of work to it. Alright Rick why don't you take a breather and call us back. You got it. In a few minutes. I mean you know like in like five minutes. We're not taking a break for a while. Alright. Bye. Just so Aunt and I can talk a little bit here. Wow Anthony. That's something. A very successful day with the homeless people at Short Hills Mall. People did a little shopping. I want to know who this woman is that they picked up and bring back to New York with. I don't know. I guess we'll find out on the bus when they can talk. She found a girlfriend? Yeah. Look at this. What does that say for a guy that can't find a chick out there? You know these guys that call her by can't get any girls a chick. Here's a homeless guy. Our own black girl. He can't get a girl. Sure. Here's a homeless guy on a two hour little excursion into Jersey. He finds a chick. She's flashing her boobs. She's on the bus with him. A homeless guy. Amazing. He pulls out that you know that you got to say you're an Indian. And then you got to get one of those little flute things like he was doing. And learn how to work that. Work the engine angle. The black thing ain't working for you Earl. Work the engine angle. You got some engine in you right? The chief had no problem. Just like that. We'll talk to her when Rick calls back. Oh yeah. Alright. But you know I got to say it. Got to thank the fine people at Short Hills Mall. How about that? They were actually very cool to our homeless people. And we didn't tell them anything. We didn't set anything up with them. They didn't know we were going there. They should be flattered that we picked them as the most exclusive mall in Jersey. Yeah. How about that? So we want to thank those fine people for helping us out today. And I also want to thank the security. The Jersey cops and the state troopers. Everyone treated us very nicely today. Yeah. Pretty cool. Thank you. Thank you. Unbelievable. Next time we do some kind of thing like this. We have to go though. Well we want. We were getting some heat from people saying why weren't you guys on the bus? Why didn't you go to the mall? We didn't have any facilities to broadcast from. Right. We needed to. Yeah exactly. Because you can't do a whole talk show from a cell phone. Coreless phones especially. Yeah. It just wouldn't work. Wow. What's your name? Hello. What's your name? Galaxia. Galaxia. What's going on? Galaxia. No. I just wanted to call on you guys. You did a great thing today. Oh thanks. And the funniest thing though is that I transferred from. I come home from work. I live in Queens from Manhattan. And I travel on the 7 train. So I'm listening to my walkman and I'm just laughing my head off when they. I don't know who it was that the security was pushing off. Yeah. And they were just like you can chew them. You can chew them full of salt. And I'm just laughing my head off. And people are looking at me like I'm nuts. So you had a lot of fun listening today. Yeah. You guys were great. I'm even at work. I was at work cracking up. Me and my cousin were just laughing our heads off. It was great. You guys are such a great thing today. Oh thank you. And also you guys said that Comedy Central wanted to get a tape of you guys. Well a lot of news agencies are very interested in what we did today. So we'll see what happens. You gotta let us know. Oh we will. We definitely will. We definitely will. That's a great thing to do anyway. Alright thank you. Alright take care. Alright bye. Bye. Kevin you're next on FM Talk. What's going on? Hey what's up? I just wanted to tell you guys something really funny happened. It was kind of chaotic. A little while ago a guy called up and he said his wife would let him go to the thing at a bike ride. And J. Moore said divorce the bitch. Yeah. Well at that very second myself, my mom, my sister, my brother all eating dinner. My brother starts choking on some freaking meatloaf. And I'm like, me, my mom and my sister cracking up, mixing it over here. And I looked up across the table. My brother is like turning blue. So I run over and I get him up out of his chair and freaking get behind him and do the Heimlich maneuver. And this freaking chunk of meatloaf the size of a freaking half dollar came out of his throat. And he was freaking shot about, I don't know, four or five feet across the table. We knocked a freaking little pitcher of milk over, hot seat, the freaking cats were running around licking all the milk up. Now they got a little treat. Oh my god it was just insane. You know, we don't want any of our listeners dying over our radio show. Oh believe me, I don't want my brother dying either. But man, he just came up from work, you know, he's trying to eat some food. He's going out tonight. Oh man, it was just historical. Very cool. You guys did a real good thing today, man. Hey, is J. Moore still there? Or did he leave? He ran out, but I think he's going to be back tomorrow. Yeah. Knowing him, so. It's cool. I saw him a couple of times when I was in college up in Jalhai, New York. It's like three hours out of the city. Yeah. He did like, I guess, a lip sync or lip service thing or something like that when he was on MTV. It was pretty cool. Oh, I remember that. It was like 91, 92. Yeah, that goes back a while. Yeah. Alright. You guys are doing real good, so keep it up. Thank you, Kevin. You guys want to come to the Palace AIDS Mall in West Nihak? We're going to have to rest this bit for a while. Alright, because I'll tell you what, I'm a security guard there and I'm looking to get laid off. So if you guys want a guided tour or just go across to Mayhem, I can be the guy for you. Alright, Kevin. Thank you. Amen. Take care. If you're on hold, you've got to make it quick because so many people want to say something real fast here, alright? Yeah. Tim, what's going on? Hey, what's happening, guys? I came out of Garden State, uh, Garden Jersey Garden, whatever the hell that is, mall. I skipped Short Hill today because of this thing because I'd never been able to get in there. But what happened? Like, did this come off as like a practical joke? Are you guys going to be on the news for like a Good Samaritan and all this crap? I don't know. Who cares? Who knows if they'll even cover it? I thought it was going to be crazy. The cops are going to come arresting people. Well, there's no laws were broken. No, that's great. It was pretty insane when you got... I'm expecting to hear all this funny stuff and it's just like, oh, you guys are going to be on the news and this is so sweet and these guys are so... I was like, this just seems funny to me. That doesn't seem like how you wanted to pull it off or anything. Oh, no. It worked out perfectly. I think 300 people following around the homeless through the mall as they tried on suits and perfume and I thought it was pretty funny. Alright? Well, I guess it's just because I came out the end of it. I just wanted to hear some of the funny stuff. Oh, you missed them. Trust me, there was a ton of funny stuff, Tim. Little recap we need. No, that's okay. You got to listen longer to the show. Alright. Bye. See you guys. There's always someone trying to like rain on our parade, Anthony. Hello. Dio, what's up? Hey, yeah, I'm a politician. I was listening to my job and you guys are great, man. Oh, thank you. Yeah, listen, I heard you have a lesbian for a day. When are you going to have a bag for a day? I don't know if that will ever happen. Alright? Okay. Alright, bye. If we could take that. No. Matt, what's going on? You guys have caused total mayhem in Jersey today. What's the matter? Do you realize? I go to Seton Hall and it's usually like a 25 minute drive up to Short Hills Mall. I could have a class at a quarter to five. I'm still in traffic. Sorry, man. I couldn't even get up there to see any of this. This sucks. You guys suck, man. Yeah, sorry, man. We got a ton of footage of this, so. Alright, you guys didn't put it on the website? Hell yeah. Alright, cool. Alright, man. You guys rule, man. Thank you. Dan, what's going on? You're next on FM Talk. Hey guys, I'll tell you. I just came from the Short Hills Mall. Unbelievable. You guys are, oh man. This chick you guys picked up, she wowed everybody. Yeah. Aw. What does she look like? Hot. Big can. And she left on the bus? Yeah. I'm stunned by this, man. I am amazed. I don't know who she was, but everybody started screaming wow and she did it. Oh wow. She was huge. Alright. You guys, I'll tell you guys, are on the money. Alright, thank you. Who's this? Opie? And Anthony. Hey. Anthony, hey. Aw, man. Great show today. Great. Alright, thank you, Dan. Who knows? Ziggy could be getting a hummer in the back of the bus as we speak. That would be hilarious. Mr. Sullivan. Yes, is this the two idiots? Yeah, you want to sue us? Yes, I would just like to inform both of you gentlemen that there will be a lawyer talking to your management team because I have been not only embarrassed but harassed. Really? Do you understand this? No. And don't even, don't even not even go close by saying thank you to the Short Hill Malls because let me tell you something. This has been a disgrace. You have your malls over there in the city. Don't you got ghetto malls over here in Newark? Don't be coming to our malls and doing something like that. You hear me? Yeah, what else? What else? Yeah. Okay, I mean, what's that, a train? Hello, sir. Sir? Mr. Sullivan? The sorryest thing is right before I hit him, he goes, what's that, a train? Sir? Did you hear that, Joey? I heard it. He goes, I heard it. What's that, a train? What's that, a train? Wham! Damn, that's funny. That's brilliant. Uh, Ryan, what's going on? What's up, bro? Oh, I'm on the way back from work on Sesame Street. You got Short Hills all tied up. It's ridiculous. Oh, cool. You gotta see it, bro. It's tied up all the way back from Park Tiffany. It's ridiculous. All right on, man. I just want to tell you, you guys caused a major commotion. Oh, cool. Yeah. Uh-uh, they go just wrong. Break it up. Um, thank you, though. Break it up. The guy on Instant Feedback, Mike, just typed in, what's that, a train? You hear that guy say that right before he got slammed with the funniest damn thing. Hey, Bill, what's up? Hey, guys. How's it going? Hey, all right. Excellent job today. Let me tell you, it's the funniest show, if that's the word. Oh, cool. Thank you. You made my girlfriend's day. She's sick home. She's sitting laying in bed listening to you the whole time. Tell her to give you a hummer. She's too sick, man. Oh, I appreciate, Bill. She keeps running to the bathroom. That won't work. All right. All right. Thanks a lot. Excellent show, guys. Thank you. Take care. All right. Joe Lyons from Comedy Central. Check it in. Joey, what's up? What's up, dude? Hey. Huge props out to you guys. That just kicked ass today. That was fun today, huh? It was, it was, you guys have had the best radio this week. You just kicked butt all week long. Oh, thanks. Are you on the train? Yeah. Cool. Oh, you're the last guy on the cell phone. I'm just enjoying myself. Big time. I didn't do any work this afternoon. It was hilarious, man. It was so good. I hope you guys just blow off like it and just keep this thing going until like 10. No, no, no. We started at 2 today. We're a little tired. Oh, my God. Got to get to the office. Right. You got a week and a half off coming up. Well, if someone can get the Aunt Nia beer, I think we can do another hour. All right, Joe. Great, great. Big props out to you and to Rick for just kicking butt. It was awesome. Oh, cool. Thanks, bro. Have a good one, guys. Lunch is on you tomorrow. Oh, okay. Always. All right, man. Joe Lyons from Comedy Central. I should ask him about the comics come home that Jay Moore's going to be doing and Jim Brewer. Oh, yeah. Both guests on the show this week. I think it's Sunday. Sunday? Yeah. Gotta catch that. Risa! Hey, guys. What's up? What's up? I got to tell you, I came home from work sick today. Wanted to go home and go to sleep. I have been up listening to you, laughing my butt off. This was by far the best show. Look at that. The accolades coming in. You guys are the best. I mean, if your ratings don't go up right now, you guys did a great thing. You guys rule. You're the best. Can I tell everyone something? What? It proves that we really don't even care about ratings because the ratings book ended yesterday. Really? That was great with you guys. We didn't even do this for like, you know, how to do it on TV for sweeps week or something. If we were smart, we would have done it yesterday or Tuesday. I wish you guys would come out to Long Island and do this. We'll be back out to the island doing something real soon. You guys are the best. I wish you the best of luck and keep up the great work. Thanks. Actually, we're trying to throw one last party next Tuesday before we go on vacation for a week and a half. Where at? We don't know yet. We're going to try to get it together. It might be tough because the marketing department worked their asses off on this one today. You guys got to let me know. Well, just keep listening to the radio. It'll be a last minute thing if we do it. Keep me in line, guys. Keep up the great work. Take it easy. Bye. What is that? A train? That's like everyone's commenting on it on the instant feedback. They're just laughing their asses off. That could be the quote of the week. Diana, I got to hear that fact one of these days. Hey guys, what's up? Yeah, without a doubt. I just left the mall and the funniest thing was not even so much watching the homeless guys, but watching the chicks in Neiman Marcus, Saks, and Nacy's putting their perfumes up and lining up their pocketbooks. And they're like, oh my lord, what's going on? So I just came from work and I'm dressed kind of nice so I'm kind of passing myself off. I'm like, I don't know. It's this radio show and they're having these homeless people. Well, this is a disgrace. This is a disgrace to my mall. I am so scared to walk outside right now. You have no idea. The chick was freaking out on me. It was definitely the best get you guys have ever done. It was a great thing. This other chick's hanging out outside and it's me, one other girl, and then this chick comes out smoking cigarettes. And she's like, this is a disgrace. I can't believe you bring these homeless people here. And all these guys started turning around and screaming at her. She's like, that's right. It's pathetic. This chick from Jersey. That attitude's on there. And I said when we were inside Nacy's and the girl's like, this is a disgrace, I'm like, yeah, they thought they'd come to the most obnoxious mall in the world. And they thought that was Short Hills. I'm like, wouldn't you? She was so pissed at me. But it was a great job, guys. All right. Well, thank you, Diana. Thanks. Take care. All right. We've got to check in with Ricky. He's back on the bus heading back to New York. Rick? Guy? Was that a train? Did you hear that? Was that the best one ever? Dude, that guy doesn't even know where Short Hills Mall is. Did you listen to his accent? Yeah. Jesus Christ. But we have our new bus rider. What's your name again, miss? Virginia. Virginia. All right. Who the chief, I guess, threw some love potion number nine and souped up. Now, what is she doing? Is she coming to New York with the chief? She's coming to New York. She's taking her clothes off on the bus to show everybody her stuff. Has she gotten completely naked? Not yet. Hey, Rick, what's your deal? What's your deal? My deal? Hello? Hi, Meg. Who's this? This is Virginia. Hi, Virginia. Why did you decide to get on the homeless bus back to New York? Because I was homeless once upon a time and I totally support what you guys are doing. Do you live in New Jersey? I live in New Jersey. Yeah, I was homeless since age 13 up until 18. So now, how old are you now? I'm 21. And what are you going to do once you get to New York? Whatever pops up. I've been going with the flow all day. Well, if you sleep outside 57th and 7th tonight, you can come by and check out our radio show live tomorrow. Oh, really? Yeah. But I have to sleep outside. Wow. Well, you don't have any accommodations. I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate it if I brought you home with me. Funny, funny, funny. Yeah. Yeah, I'm having an awesome time. Awesome time. All right, cool. And I am not giving blow jobs. I'm not giving oral favors. Yeah, we had to dump out of that. Do you want to like slash the guys one last time? Oh, I've been doing it. I just saw some guy in a car riding next to us. He almost crashed. Oh, cool. A flash bus now. Great. Yeah, yeah, man. All right. Well, thank you. I'm trying to get on a few police driving behind us. Yeah. Well, thank you, Virginia. You're welcome, darling. Bye-bye. All right. All right, guys. Yeah. I think we're going to have Virginia flash the only guy who hasn't seen her breasts today yet. Who? Ziggy? No, the bus driver, Bob. Oh. He's been doing an awesome job with the bus. What did Ziggy think of her boobs? There we go. Beautiful. Right up in front of the white line. There he goes. I got you. Here we go. One, two. How's that, Bob? There's my headache. There's my headache. All right, Rick. How close are you guys to the studio? I guess it's a far. When do we do it again? How close are we to the studio there, Bob? From the city. What I understand is a lot of traffic. All right. All right. A lot of traffic. We're probably about 15 minutes from the tunnel, so try and get in there as soon as we can. All right. We've got to take a quick break. We'll check in with you one last time next, okay? You got it, man. All right. There's Rick on the homeless bus doing a great job today. An awesome job today. Everyone ending their emails with, is that a train? Great instant feedback coming in right now. Bob from Jersey, you guys got to end the show with, what's that, a train? Guys, that's got to be bit of the week. Mark says, no, it's a frigging Winnebago. Yeah, it's a damn train. Bang. Apparently, New Jersey Transit has added a new station stop. It's called Uptight A-Hull. Is that a train? Wham, ouch. Everyone ending their emails with, is that a train? Very good. It has to be. People want it on the website. Is that a train?

Oh, yeah, and I think, hey, you guys appreciate it. We don't have to do this for you guys today. All right, hey, is that a train? What's that, Rick? Hey, Rick. Oh, no. I can't believe it. I can't believe the train took out the homeless bus on the way back to New York. The homeless people, their new chick, all gone. Wow. Hey, Mike, you're next on FM Talk. What's up? Hey, how you doing? I was just at the mall. It was crazy. It was like a mob scene. There were so many people that everybody was going crazy. Everybody started changing their stash socks. Well, that's a staple chant when you get our fans together. Yeah, I know. Cool. It was the best thing you guys have ever done around here. You guys got to come back here more. We will. Okay. Thank you. All right, Mike, we'll actually show up. Yeah, we will next time. Denise, what's up? Hey, guys, what's up? All right. Absolutely hilarious today. Oh, cool. I was walking around the mall all day waiting for you guys. I'm kind of upset you weren't there because I have a huge crush on OP. And all of a sudden, all of these cops were right in front of Neiman Marcus here. There were like five police officers. And I knew you guys were there. Well, you guys weren't, but you know. Yeah. Rick and them. So we ended up seeing them and I'm really upset I couldn't get through sooner because I was in this one store and there was like some gay black guy all upset and totally dethroned that you guys were in the mall. And I wanted to call in and tell you to get them to go into that one store. Yeah. Oh, well. Well, we had enough people helping us out today, but we appreciate it. And next time you guys have to go. We will. We're actually trying to throw a last minute party together before we go on vacation for a week and a half. Listen tomorrow. We might have more details on that. All right. Cool. All right. Thank you. All right. Rick's on the line. I hear there might be some survivors. Rick. Yeah, we got the bus off the track just in time, but we don't have survivors. Survivors. This goes out to all of the homeless on the bus. When the big train hit, some people perished, but Rick and others went on to become survivors. All right, guys. We'll see you later. All right. We'll see you tomorrow. Hey, Rick. Hey, Rick. Great job today, man. Yeah. Thanks, dude. All right, man. Peace. Bye. Some guy works at the Sharper Image store in Short Hills Mall. Yeah. Said it was the best work day of his life. It was hilarious. I had a homeless guy ask me if I have CDRS. What the hell is a homeless guy going to do with recordable CDs? All the workers at the mall were giving each other updates on where you guys were. We loved it. Oh, cool. The best thing was the look on the faces of those stupid rich people. You guys are great. All right, man. All right, man. You know, with that, let's call it a day. Let's get that all out of here. Absolutely. We've got a very busy Opie and Anthony show tomorrow. Yes. You know what?
