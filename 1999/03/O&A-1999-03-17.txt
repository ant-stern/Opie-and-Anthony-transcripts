 The Rock of New York 1027WAW, Finlay's the jailbreak. Alright, yeah. Remember this in our case. Nice crowd tonight. Yeah, yeah. And this is our first break. I can't wait till later. Wow. We are broadcasting live LeBar Bad West 57th between 8th and 9th. You guys having fun or what? I guess I gotta start by asking, is anyone sober in this place? No! People got an early start today. Did anyone go to work today? No! Whoa! That's ambient background noise. Don't bother with that. We just threw out the first curse. That's good. What's the laser pointer on the table? I'm looking around like, what is this? Who's got the laser pointer? No, no one ever has them. No one's gonna fess up anyway. Just the dot on the table. Okay, I don't mind putting it on my head. I'll go, oh look, I'm the Indian gun. Just don't burn my retinas out, okay? I need my eyes for half life. And it could be an actual gun. We got a bunch of cops in the back over there. Yeah, there they are. And we got the firefighters. Where are the firefighters? There they are! Yeah! Alright, we're still in the middle. And my buddy's up at the bar. Yeah, lug nut. Hey, Diesel had sex with a midget. He was telling me, I love this. You can tell how much people have been drinking all day by the conversations you get in within the first ten seconds of meeting someone. I meet him, like ten seconds later, I had sex with a midget. He's like, well, tell me all about it. Well, tell him why he had sex with a midget though. Because he admitted to us that he has a real tiny schlong. Yeah, so it looks bigger next to a midget. That's what he said. Little Vienna sausage fingers, you know? Those little midget fingers. So ladies, the guy standing up at the bar, he's got a real small one, just in case you're wondering, alright? He's going to put a corona bottle across your head. Yeah, that's alright. We're partying with Killian's and we're all over the ball field today. We're at La Barbe at West 57th between 8th and 9th. Matt Devotee is at No Idea. Great name for a bar, No Idea. That's on East 20th Street, 30 East 20th Street between Park and Broadway. Ralph the Tour is at Hooters, starting at 5 o'clock, Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island. Eddie Trunk is at Murphy's Townhouse starting at 5, 97 Franklin Street in Stamford, Connecticut. And it's all brought to you by Killian's Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day. But we are here at La Barbe. And we are going to try today during our broadcast here between 3 and 7 at La Barbe. For the guys, we are going to try to get a boob up on stage. It'll happen. We've seen some drunkenness already, so I think it could happen. I think it could happen very soon, Anthony. Also, we've got a lot to give away if you're on your way over here. We've got two trips anywhere in the USA for two people, $50 gift certificates to Chelsea Piers, we've got movie passes to Lowe's Cineplex. And are they still skiing? We've got ski passes? Is that happening? All right. At Hunter Mountain, we've got CDs and T-shirts. Lots of stupidity on the way. It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live. La Barbe at West 57 between 8 and 9. Man, look at this. These people are psyched to party, St. Patrick's Day in New York City. Yeah. And usually early on in our show, it's kind of a mellow crowd, but these guys are primed already. All right. Who's been going since 8 this morning? How about 10? Any late starters? 11? Yeah, yeah, was he? Not one person. Hey, you guys, we've got to say hi to George Killian. He's throwing the party today. Zee George Killian. Come on. Wow. Hello, everybody. Look at that voice in his head. I love it. Hello. Hello. I'm delighted to be here celebrating St. Patrick's Day with you at WNEW. Isn't that great? Now, George, how many Killians have you had today already? I've lost count. Did you pour down your lucky charms this morning? Bring it over here. So you're making the rounds around New York? Making the rounds, yeah, but having a fabulous time. That's kind of rough going from bar to bar, because then you have to... Hard work. Someone has to do it. I wish I had your job. I thought I had an easy job. I think you have the best job in New York. I'd be ready to hire you shortly. Maybe you'll consider it. Oh, really? You got somebody in the wings that's going to take your place here? A few. Like Frank Perdue did? He put his son in there? He'd do that? George, show us. Hey, who is it? Now, George, could you give us like an Irish toast or something maybe? To get the party started right? Give him a beer. Give him a beer to start it. I'd love to get a toast in honor of St. Patrick's Day. Okay. Alright? Yeah, let's do it. St. Patrick was a gentleman who should strategize stealth. Drove all the snakes from Ireland. Here's a toastie to his health. But not too many toastings, lest you lose yourself and them. Forget the good St. Patrick and see all those snakes again. Alright! Two billion, everyone! Hey, I have another one. There once was a man from Nantucket. George, you know any limericks? Probably none you could tell on the air, right? I couldn't put it on the air. Yeah, they usually rhyme with rock. You know, things like that. Luck. We understand. Alright, now George, you're going to be doing some cake stands with us a little later? Funnel shots? Funnel shots. Okay. You guys, let's hear it for George Killian, huh? Lots more to come. It's Opie and Anthony Broadcasting Live. La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th.

Well, you've got to do something really, really good for a trip. Come on. Yeah, yeah. Have we got nudity yet, Anthony? No, we're still waiting for that. Nudity? Still waiting. Oh, really? Nudity? Whoa, hello. Could you come on stage and show everyone that? Oh, the guys would love it. Yeah, come on up. Come on. This is the cornerstone of our show. Well, first of all, what's your name?

Look at those. Oh, come on. Look at those, man. All right, you guys want to see something or what, huh? All right, should we start with the 36s? I think we start with the 36s and work our way up, Anthony. All right, let's go. 36. Oh, my God. Look at that. It doesn't like green elevators. I love that. The crowd seems to not like that because she's showing her bra. Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Oh, my God. Wait a minute. I think I have seen heaven. Wow. I have seen the bra of his life. Jennifer, I got to say that those could be the best boobs I've ever seen in my life. Those are beautiful, Jennifer. Unbelievable. And people, isn't this what St. Patty's Day is all about? Where's the 38 double Ds now? Oh, she's a 38D. All right, you're a double D, 36 double D, and you're a 36. Who the hell cares? Whip off your boobs. No, I really like the whole mathematics. Lose the shirt, honey. Wow, let me see this. Wait, wait, we have a rule violation. We have a rule viola... God, oh, but your head was in the way. Can I get a private show, please? What do you guys think of that, huh? Can I get a private show? His head was in the way. Can I get a private show? One more time! One more time! One more time! I think the 36 double Ds have it. Wow, ladies, beautiful. Beautiful. I one shot together. Look at this guy, one shot together. He's got his camera. He's taking pictures. He's a firefighter, too, man. Speaking of which, we've got to say hi to the Yonkers fire department hanging with us today. Station 4, engine 304, ladder 74, partying with us after this. We've got New York's finest, New York's gravest, and New York's drunkest. Well, we were going to play a bit that came in late yesterday, but I guess we can wait. I mean, look at what we've got. We can't stop that. If you want to party with us, it's... Say hi to your friend. What? Sean. Sean, you just did. Alright, for one more peek, you can say hi. We'll fart around a mission for a boob. Alright, how about a double?

We're broadcasting live, La Barba, West 57th between 8th and 9th. I don't know how we're going to outdo ourselves from the last break, Anthony. That's okay, we'll just have to get more people up here. Yeah, I think so. I think we can do that. I think it's the afternoon goes on. I think we'll get more girls that might want to come up here. And give a little St. Patty's Day spirit. Any other ladies want to flash? How about someone on the railing? Oh, she's waving. The high altitude flash. The high altitude New Orleans flash. We turn this into Mardi Gras. Come on, Mardi Gras. Guys, throw money, throw something. Please. All right, we're going to be here until at least 7. Look at the spotlight goes on. That's smart. Who's working the spotlight? That's good. All right, move the spotlight around. Maybe we'll find another lady up on the railing. There he goes. You got to be careful. I saw some guy get some abuse, man. What do you mean? Yeah. Guy right over here. Girl was requesting a song. She came up to me and said she wanted to hear George Thorogood. And he said, how about you hear my big beep go into your beep. She turns around, takes her beer and throws it right on his groin. So he's got to go around the rest of the night looking like he wet his pants. Now, where is that guy? It's a perfect move for a girl. Where is that guy? Come on up on stage and show everyone your wet spot. This is the wet spot. We got to see the wet spot. I think wet spot left. It's one of the... He's changing his pants. There it is. All right. Very good. That isn't even the guy. What did it happen to you too? How many guys does this happen to? What are you kidding? I wouldn't let that happen to me. Pour him on that. All right. This guy's going to pour a beer into your pants. Is that all right? All right. Pulling his head down. Yeah, we didn't laugh. I don't know what's going on. We didn't need to see that. Firemen in their hoses. Hey, Anthony, late in the show yesterday, we had that schmuck call us. Oh, yeah. He said we talked too much on our radio show and he wanted to talk to our boss who's in the corner over here, Gary. And we played the runaround game with him. Oh, no. Trouble has arrived. What's up, bro? The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW. Days of the new. Hope you and Anthony broadcast a live LeBarbat at West 57th between 8th and 9th. I got to point this guy out. Raise your hands, dude. I don't know if you guys remember when we were smashing the hell out of that Bronco in Monocay, New Jersey. This guy was putting his bare fist through the windshield and the side window. Thank you, OPR. Anthony, I thought you would recognize me for this. I recognize you. I recognized you, you mother-in-law. I gave you a shirt. A cool, light shirt. I just grabbed the shirt. Get the guy. Give him an N.E.W. shirt. I don't want him to wrap my head. Look at him. Ben, you got to take care of that guy. He's scary. He's giving him another one, the same shirt. Earl, he's going to kick your ass. You know this guy? He rolled over the Bronco single-handedly. I still got the stitches to prove it. He does. He was bleeding like a mother and he's like, hey, man, I want to just shake your hands and like, no, we're not going to shake your hands. You're a biohazard. What's your name again, dude? I remember the face. Matt. All right, Matt. Matt's in the house, everyone. Look out. Yeah! We got to thank Killian's Red for throwing the party today. If you can't make it to La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th, we're all over the ball field today. Matt Devote, starting at 5 o'clock, will be at No Idea. That's the name of the bar. That's pretty cool, right? Yeah, I heard the spot. Matt's like, I'll be at No Idea. Sounds like me on a Saturday night, having no freaking idea. That's on 30 East 20th Street between Park and Broadway in Manhattan. Our buddy, our pal Ralph Titor, he's at Hooters. Man, he got the luckiest sign in today, huh? Yeah, but you know, Ralph can never talk about Hooters. That's true. So he's in his own helm right now. That's true. And that's on Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island. Go see Ralph between 5 and 7. And Eddie Trunk, who's doing that great show on Saturday nights. Anyone else hear that show on Saturday night with that? Saturday Night Rocks! Saturday Night Rocks! Eddie's at Murphy's Townhouse at 597 Franklin Street in Stanford, Connecticut. Eddie always happy to be out of the studio. Yes, he's very happy to be doing his own thing today. And this is all brought to you by Killian's Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day. Now, earlier if you were listening to the radio, we had the lovely Jennifer. And who was the other girl? What was her name? Jennifer! Who cares? They both had great foods and they showed everyone on stage. Jennifer is just beautiful. She came up and showed everybody her goods. Her 36 double V's. Just beautiful. We might have to get an encore presentation later on. All natural. All natural, right? Firm, still perky. For something so big to be so perky. What can I say? They're all yours? Yeah. Jennifer, I'm going to suggest this. You should come in the studio to Challenge Terror, it's the hottest girl ever to be naked on the Open Air 3 show. I'm totally serious. I am totally serious. We've got a couple of girls coming down Friday to do that, to take on Terror. So, if you want to join us, we'll let you know off mic. She's coming down, man. Alright. We've got something for the ladies here. So, guys, let the ladies up front for this one because I don't think you guys want to see this. Let's hear it for Gary, everyone. Gary, grab that mic. Yeah, Gary. Now, Gary, what is your sad story? What is your story? Well, I'll give you one of my sad stories. When I was 16, December 18th, I had broken my knee. Yeah. So, I had an operation Christmas Eve. Okay. Being a macho guy, I stopped using my crutches too early. As I was walking with my knee brace and everything, my testicles twisted inside my body. Oh, oh, oh, oh. And I thought it was just a really bad case of blue balls or something. I didn't know what was going on. Oh, my God. So, I just put it off. Then when I finally went to the hospital, they told me they would have to have an operation. They would see if they could untwist it. If they couldn't, they'd have to remove it. So, four hours later, I wake up with only one testicle. Whoa. Wait, so it's like when you take the party balloons and twist them and that's what happened? And it died inside me. And if I got in the hospital like five hours earlier, they would have been able to save it. You guys want to see Gary's one testicle? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think Lee's got something to say about this. I never agreed to show it. I just got, I had 200 drunk people push down. You are with you, buddy, so back off. Excuse me while I whip this hat. Maybe we could do this. If a girl wants to see it in private. Oh, yeah. Any woman is welcome. And then she can describe it. Any woman is welcome to see it firsthand, in the mouth and whatever other buddy parts come into play. Is there a girl that wants to see, any girls want to see one testicle? Raise your hand and come toward the stage. Any of the girls want to see this? The difference with my number. Oh, no, they're coming. They're coming forward. I just see guys. Any other ladies want to see one testicle? You want to look, you'll be a you'll be a investigative reporter, a correspondent for the Opium Anthony show. Is there any other girls that want to see the one testicle? Because then they could describe it for everyone else. You look, you come back, you talk on the air and tell us what it looked like. Right? Yeah, we'll do it that way. Right? All right. All right. She's going to she's going to. Yeah. Wow. What's your name? Are you one testicle Ted? One testicle, Gary. What's your name? Elaine. Elaine, you want to see how long you've been drinking? I only have one. That's it. One. And Gary only has one. Oh, you want to see. You want to look too. Yes. Okay. All right. How are we going to do it? Anyone else want to see Gary's testicle? Any other girl? It'll be a group shot. Should we charge admission. What's going on? No, we'll take care of it. All right, Gary, stand up and show these girls your testicle. Right here. I can't go behind the curtain or something. Sneak back over here. Black girl will hide your ugly ass from the crowd. What am I going to do with this? Gary! Gary! Gary! What am I getting out of this? We'll take care of you, trust me. We'll give you some good stuff. Come on, the girls are waiting. Alright. The girls are in front of Gary, on their knees, Anthony. Back up a little, Elaine's saying. I bet Rick wishes he was here. Alright, Gary has undone his belts. He's pulling down his pants. And here... Oh yeah, look at that! It's true! What am I going? You got a problem? He just showed the one nut to the girl. It looks like two fat ones that just came together. It looks like two fat ones that came together. That was one testicle. What do you think of the one testicle? I think it looks like a potato. It looks like two nuts or one. It just looks like one potato, right? Yeah. Hey, did you notice that the one testicle got bigger after they removed the... Because I looked and it was very large. It's been eight years so it's probably just... Maybe the one testicle became super testicle. Yes. Because... Freaking yes nature. I don't have a partner, now I must become super testicle. They'll be doing a special on Nova next week, you don't know. Yeah, all right. Well, let's hear it for Gary. There's one testicle, everyone. A tragic story. Five hours earlier you would have cut your nut. I would have saved it and I would have been fine. Did you keep it in a jar or something? I don't know, but the doctor kind of had a little freaky look. Really? It could be sitting in the back somewhere. Well, good luck to you. Can it still perform and everything? So it's no big deal, right? No, it's just a shock when it first appears. Look at the penis! I only saw it a couple of times ago. Hey honey, you want to see penis? I think you'll have some takers out here. All the guys are starting to pull down their pants for a reason. All right, we got lots more to come. It's open, head to the broadcast and live. You still have time to get down here. We'll be here until at least 7 o'clock. Barbat, West 57. All right, we're back. That's Collective Soul and Heavy on the Rock of New York. 1027W&W. It's the LaBarbat, West 57th between 8th and 9th. Just having an overall piss out. Yeah, good time. We got more girls coming up on stage to show some boogs or what? Well, some guy just informed me there were four girls over there. All right. One who want to come on up and show. We'll do that as a little tease just in case people are on their way over here. Sure. Something to look forward to if you're on the road. But right now we want to do the first round of the Show Us Your Star competition, Anthony. Okay. This is based on audience applause of these stars too, I'll be sure. Yes, and we're going to need the guy with the spotlight to help us out. Who do we got first there, Ben? Do you want to do John first? All right, let's do John first. John has an ash scar. John, sit on the seat and talk to us for a few minutes. And if you're in your car going, man, I wish I could see this. Don't worry. Black Earl. He's got the digital camera. We're taking pictures and hopefully they'll be on the website by tomorrow afternoon. Now, John, you got an ash scar. You're going to be able to see it. You're going to be able to see it. Now, John, you got an ash scar. Yes, right on my tailbone. Like that crack of the ass part. Now, how did this happen? I had a benign tumor that had to get removed. Okay. And you have no problem showing everyone your ass? No, no problem. I've had the scar for 15 years. All right. 15 years. I got another one on the middle of my back too, another little removal. All right, you guys want to see John's ass? Oh, you're going to have to get something out of this. But just like a car accident, you're going to look like a car accident. Exactly. All right, John, if you would stand up. We've got the spotlight on the stage. Look at the girl that wanted to see the testicle. She's like yelling. All right, Ben's got the camera. He's taking a picture. There's John. And he's got another tumor scar on the back there. Very nice, John. What do you guys think of John's ass scar? Wait. We're not talking about his ass. We're talking about his ass scar. Oh, my God. All right, who's next? Jane. Wow. We're going to talk to Jane here. Come on, Jane. Grab a mic. All right, Jane. How are you doing? How are you? Very well. You are hammered. No, I'm not. All right, Jane, you've got a... She's smacking the bag over here. You have a gallbladder scar. Oh, that's pretty good, Sergeant. All right, turn around and show the crowd. This is Jane and her gallbladder scar. That's pretty good. I think we can do better, but that's pretty good. That's good. Wait, you have to talk on a mic here. Okay. This scar... I was dead. They rejuvenated me. I was given my last rites for five times in 30 days. This scar to me is very important. I am rejuvenated and alive again. Did you see the light now? I saw the light. I was floating above myself and I saw myself. My sisters are right there and they'll call you back. Your death experience, man. All right, you guys. Let's hear it for Jane. She was dead. She was dead. She just flashed. She just gave him a little extra there, Anthony. She just flashed the crowd. Errol missed it, I can tell. You missed that fixer, didn't you, Errol? That was pretty quick. Who do we got next, then? We got Kelly the guy with pretty outrageous stretch marks. Wait, Kelly, grab the mic. Kelly, what's happening, guys? It's called four years of college, man. I spent nothing but drinking and screwing. Did you used to be a skinny guy? No, you were always big? Big being, precise question. And then what was the stretch marks from? Like eating and drinking? I spent four years of college. I don't think stretch marks qualify though. I bet you a million dollars they come from that. All right, let me see. These guys want tits and I'll show them tits. It's no big deal. I got no problem. We want to see your stretch marks. Face the crowd. Wow, look at that. What the hell is that? He's proud of them. That's okay. That takes some good work, man. Very good. We got Mark. All right, Mark, come on up and show us your scar, Mark. Sit down. Grab the mic, Mark. Wow, you got some gnarly knees. Is that where the scars are? Talk into the mic. That goes from my knee to my thigh. And the other side, about four inches across. And then there's another one over here from a motorcycle accident. All right, stand on the chair. Hopefully you won't break your leg and get more scars. All right, this is Mark and his knee scars. Pull up your pants so they can see the whole scar on the left there. That's pretty good. That's not bad. Now, how'd that happen? This one, motorcycle. And this one, my leg locked back. My knee, like, pulled. Oh, your foot went the wrong way. And hit you in that forehead-like? In the shoulder. Locked back. Man. It locked back and came right up. All right, let's hear it for Mark, everyone. Not bad, not bad. And we can't find Brad, the shotgun victim. Where's Brad? Oh, come on, Brad. Where's Brad? All right, we want to see the shotgun guy. Well, we'll take a break. It's the first round of the East Show. It's a star competition. We'll get Brad up here in a little bit. It's Hope and Anthony broadcasting live, the Barbat, West 57th between 8th and 9th on the Rock of New York, 1027WNEW. Why, what, do you got some stacker 2 on you? No, I don't. Come on, let's leave. Okay, listen, if you can't make it to the Barbat where we're hanging out, we got people all over the ball field. We got Matt Devotee right now at a bar called No Idea. I don't want to say it's appropriate, or Matt might be insulted, but that's appropriate. There you go, it's 30 East 20th Street between Park and Broadway in Manhattan. Our buddy, our pal Ralph DeTorra, he's great when he's on our show. He's at Hooters right now, Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island, and Eddie Trunk who's doing that great Saturday night show, Saturday Night Rocks.

But Eddie Trunk is at Murphy's Townhouse, 97 Franklin Street in Stanford, Connecticut. It's all brought to you by Killian's Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day.

Oh my god, now the mother's coming on stage. Okay, let me explain. Here's the deal. When we were in commercials earlier, right? We found out that these four sisters want to show their boobs all at the same time on the stage. Yeah, yeah. And we were all set to do it, and then their mom showed up. The mom showed up and they came up and said, no, don't even mention this. That this is gonna happen. I mean, come on. I think it's a verbal contract or something, right? Alright, someone shield the mom's eyes. She doesn't want to see this. Maybe mom could... Wait a minute. Mom just won a tour of La Barbatte. It's a grand tour. It's one of the prizes here we're giving away. It's a tour of La Barbatte. Start with the back corner. Alright, wait, Anthony. One of our faithful listeners have got to take one for the team and take mom to the bar and do a couple shots with her so she doesn't see the mess that's about to happen on the stage. Alright. All the sisters, I want you sitting down at this microphone over here. Are you girls attractive? Look at this. Isn't this great? You guys have gorgeous blue eyes. I hope you're taking pictures.
