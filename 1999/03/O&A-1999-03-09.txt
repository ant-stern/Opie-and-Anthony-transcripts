 One oh two seven W. N. E. W. The Rock of New York two for Tuesday with Leonard Skinner. The Stones before that with a tasty little track. Live With Me from Let It Bleed and Respectable. Starting off the OBE and Anthony show today. Oh, oh, oh! I almost forgot. I'm sorry. Ah, you sick? Wow. I'm done. Sorry. Ralph forgot. He always sprays. I'm done. I'm now going to be sick. Sprays the mic with Lysol. Done. He's getting me back. Oh, never mind. You sneezed on Anthony's mic? I sneezed on Anthony's mic. Are you serious? How did you sneeze? Ew, is that snot? There is a piece of snot on the top. No, I'm lying. See, you guys exaggerate everything. Oh, we exaggerate everything? Did you see the pubic hair on the board that we pointed out yesterday? And then there was bloody tissues. Did you see the bloody tissues yesterday? Was that yours? No. All right. Oh, well. What a way to start another OBE. Anthony, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, well. What a way to start another OBE. Wait, hold on. Let me turn your mic on. What happened? Do you really want to know who I think the bloody tissue belonged to? Well, Anthony lost it yesterday because his work area over there had bloody tissues. You don't know this because you're here late in the afternoon. In the morning when I come in, if he's still here, Steve Mason's working in that area with his laptop, just like you have your setup. Well, not just like it. I'm not pointing any fingers. I really don't know. I don't leave bloody tissues. There was bloody tissues and blood all over the newspaper. Blood on one of the newspapers. And it wasn't the first time it happened. If it only happened once, I'd be like, ah, somebody was hemorrhaging. It's okay. Well, Devo is bleeding a lot lately. From where? Between his eye and his finger. He cut his finger on the air a couple days ago. I didn't have my medical bag with me. We have the easiest job in the world. How do you cut your finger on the job here? I'm holding up a calendar. How do you cut your finger? Oh, paper cuts. Sorry about that. Oh, you got me. I forgot about that. Paper cuts. Figure out. Shut me up. Try working with sheet metal. All right. Are we off and running? Yeah, we're off and running. This is what we do. It's our show. And they're off. Got to say hi to Brian in Brooklyn sending an instant feedback. There are lots of New York's bravest listening to you guys. All the guys in my house, Engine 156. What's up, boys? They love Yoshi especially, so that's cool. All right. And are we doing the DiMaggio record today? Yeah, we could do that. Two consecutive days being dead? Well, the joke goes, what happens on April 23rd, Anthony? They're redoing my joke. What happens on April 23rd? What, Alpe? Joe DiMaggio will be dead for 56 consecutive days. I don't think he'll ever surpass Lou Gehrig's record. That's a tough one to beat as dead Yankee greats consecutively being dead for so many days. But Joe Di working on it day two. Did anyone else find the actual paper today? Yeah. Yeah, there were a couple of false starts as I'm reading the post and news day today. Our 20 page spectacular Joe Di commemorative section. It's like I'm going through the paper going, look, it's all Joe Di news. And then finally the middle of the paper there's like three, you know. Then they have the hidden paper within the paper. Yeah. Okay, here's Monica on the cover and the daily news. I mean, jumper almost killed me. Yeah. Is there a better story that is happening in New York than that one? We had a guy that saw this happen yesterday and he described what happened to this girl. Well, I got him queued up. Oh, you do? Because we had one of the first eyewitness reports of the incident. Guy jumped off a roof and splat. Twenty one stories. Woo hoo! What a ride. We were discussing this on the way in. From the description of his head popping like a light bulb, I would think his head hit first. Or else, you know, your fall would be broken enough, I think, maybe, if you hit with legs first. So poor Diane, she's on the cover of the daily news. She says she... What did she say she heard? And he was all over her. She heard the wind? Yeah, she heard like a whoosh and people screaming. But she didn't see, because I guess people saw him falling. Was it like a Bugs Bunny cartoon? Yeah. And I guess... But he didn't crawl out of the hole, dust himself off, and go to Acme for some missiles. He just splattered all over every piece of real estate within a 25 foot radius. Can you imagine the guy's arm hit her? Yeah, that's what happened. They're saying she heard this whistling, heard people screaming. She stops and like, huh? What? And the arm, his arm hit her shoulder. And it said it felt like a ton. And she fell down. As she gets up a little dazed and opens her eyes, she's covered with what's left. Yeah. With what's left of this guy all over her and all over everything. Disgusting, huh? And she's saying that if she was a little over... Yeah, a little bit to the left. She would have been dead. This son of a... You know something? I understand he's despondent. He's out of sorts enough that he wants to jump off a building. He was sane enough to call a friend and say he was doing this. You know, take some pills. There he goes. Oh, that had to hurt. He's out the window. He's despondent. I understand. But you take pills and lay in your bed and die. Don't threaten other people's lives. He could have killed this poor girl. Let me take the other side of this, though. You're not thinking in those terms. He's thought enough to call someone. I'm going to kill myself. Look at me. I'm... I crap my pants. I ride a little rascal. And I got the poly at the pants up to my nipples. I wear the wrap around sunglasses and the walker with the wheels and the handbrake. I'm jumping. But just think, other people aren't old and decrepit and might want to live out their lives. He just jumps. I think he has the I'm the only person in the world syndrome. Which we talk about a lot on this show. The most important person in the world. He jumps and almost hits this poor girl who now I think is probably traumatized. I want to talk to her and ask her how she slept last night. We're trying to get her on the phone. Hopefully we'll be able to make that happen, Anthony. I mean, could you imagine the type of nightmares? No. You dream that this guy with a popped head is chasing you and his arm is constantly hitting your shoulder? Why didn't you catch me? Why? It's your fault. You know, that would be horrific. Hi, NAW. Hey guys. Hi. What's up? Do you think that girl, if she got some brain matter on her, she could say he gave her some head? A wacky little joke there. You got to lighten up this deep. Alright man, thank you. Thanks guys. Good job. Let's play the eyewitness from yesterday that called in. Alright, pretty sick. Alright Chris, so what happened? I was walking down the street in front of the Harley-Davidson Cafe and I hear this woman scream behind me. I turned around and this guy came down and splattered all over the sidewalk. It's like the guy I was saying before. His brain went all over the sidewalk, all over the side of this grocery store, this gourmet grocery store. I don't know about any guy being hit, but there was a woman there, a poor young girl and her 20s. It's absolutely hysterical because it happened right in front of her. Wow. It's typical of New York City fasts and the place where they're sitting there and they leave the body with no cover on it for about 20 minutes until someone finally gets a sheet and covers it. Then there's like a leg sticking out of the back of it. It looks like one of those cartoon characters with the legs all twisted. And you got some brain on you? I hate to say I don't. I think someone's going to mislead you. I didn't get any brain on me. It was all over the sidewalk and people were walking through it because they didn't realize what happened right off the bat. Right, you're just walking and all of a sudden it's like, hey, what is this? Yeah. Throughout the day my mechanic kept sending me back for coffee, which is right around the corner. I kept going back and checking out. I was lying there for a good five, six hours until they finally took it away in the fire department, just sitting there with their hoses, hosing down the sidewalk with all their brains going down into the sewer. That's what it all comes down to, doesn't it? Your brains in the gutter. Yeah, unfortunately it seems so. I hate to run, guys, but I've got to get the bus to get home. All right, buddy. Well, thank you for that. You guys rock. Later. Bye. And there you have it, Chris, from yesterday. That's it. He lived 70 some odd years to have his brains hosed out of the gutter, hosed off the sidewalk into the gutter for the rats. Isn't that wonderful? All right. Well, lots more to do today. We have Johnny Lang coming in at four o'clock. Yes, we do. Can't wait to see him again. He came by in the summertime. We had so much fun hanging out with him. And I think we're going to play Bra Bingo with Johnny Lang today. Yeah, that's a fun game. We like Bra Bingo. I haven't played in a while. A lot of people love when we play Bra Bingo. So, you want to tell the people how to get their cards ready for the game, Anthony? Yeah, if you want to play along at home, you make a standard Bingo card, which is five squares with the middle square of the card being your free boob space. And you throw in random, let me repeat, random Brazier sizes. Yeah, don't put all the obvious sizes in a row. Yeah, if you put all the fun, cool, common sizes all in a row, you're going to win very quickly because we just randomly take phone calls. And you're only cheating yourself, people. You're only cheating yourself. So, we suggest putting a bunch of sizes in a hat and you draw them out and fill them in across that way so there's no favoritism. And the center square, the free boob square. Free boob, we then take calls from girls who give us their bra sizes. And if you match on your card, the bra size on the phone, you exit off. And of course, first person that gets five in a row, diagonally or up down across wins. There you go. Bra Bingo. All right, we'll play that sometime after four o'clock with Johnny Lang. And if you do want to play along at home, make your cards up, fill it in, and then you're going to have to fax them to us with your name on it. Sure. So that way after the game is done, if you in fact did win, you could then fax it to us and we can check to make sure you didn't just make it up. Right. Okay. And maybe we'll have some tickets or something. You never know. You never know. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, Tuesday with Nirvana from Unplugged, that's dumb, and Come As You Are from Never Mind. It's Opie and Anthony. Hello. Quickly I'm seeing in USA Today it says, shock jock after shocks, advertisers clean up. They say that advertisers on radio programs that feature shock jocks do much better than on shows that don't have shock jocks. Is this Today's USA Today? Yeah. They talk about, let's see, the Griezmann, yeah, and Don Imus, and Howard. Yeah. And they're saying that these shock jocks, their advertisers don't shy away because they've seen through their little research that people are listening to those ads. They get people to buy the product. How about that? But I guess shock jocks, it's a hot topic in America these days because the Griezmann, the Griezmann, getting fired a couple weeks back. You're a little daddly-doo. Yeah, I just can't say anything racially. Opie and Anthony get in trouble. Are you still on your apology tour, Griezmann? I'm on the Griezmann apology tour. I'm apologizing to everybody. Did I say chink? Who? Yes, you did. I'm in trouble again. You're shocking. I'm proud of this guy. You didn't know what you were saying, right? Walt, do you have another? Do you have another gig lined up yet? Not yet. Job offer is not coming in for the Griezmann show. What are you going to do if you're out of radio? I don't know, maybe television. Look at my good looks. Oh yeah, you look great on a nightline. I'm going to do my apology tour though for the next year. I'm just going to go around everywhere in the world. I don't care who it is. Have you talked to Cosby yet? The Crouch, the Chink, the Mix, the Dago, everybody. I apologize to people I haven't insulted. Oh, all right. Dear Martians, how about those red bastards, the Martians? Yadda-doodle, those short little people, Martians. I hate the Martians. Did I mention homos? Yadda-doodle-dee, how about the homos? I'll tell a gerbil joke and apologize for a year to the homos. Yadda-doodle-dee-da-day. On the Grease Man Joe's apology tour. Very nice. Well, is Anthony still? Oh, hey, there you are. Hi, Opie. Why do you let him take over the mic like that? I don't know. He just goes. So it's a big article on Shock Jocks in USA Today. They mention the Grease Man. Yeah, but they're saying the advertisers stay with it. And it's a... Well, do they have other examples of people getting fired for saying something shocking on their radio show? Let's look. Yes, yes, in Austin, Texas. A radio host joked about assassinating President and Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Gore. Wow. A Nashville disc jockey called boxer Mike Tyson the N-word. And he got fired for that? Yeah. And in Sacramento, California, a DJ encouraged motorists to run down illegal immigrants crossing the Mexican border. Yadda-dada, why didn't I think of that one? Hop in your cars, run down the wetbacks, yeah. Yadda-dada-dada-day. Are you kidding? He got fired for that? Yeah. Are we mentioning this article? Because ours was pretty intense, too. OP, once again, we were looked over. Our dead mayor in Boston, Schtick, didn't even rate. It doesn't even rate. Come on, that's better than calling Mike Tyson the N-word. I know. But I've got to say, it's not as good as encouraging motorists to run down illegal immigrants crossing the border. That's up there. Yadda-dada-dada. I love it. 1027W&W, the Rock of New York. It's Priceline, Anthony. Priceline, yadda-dada-day. Oh, it's the Greaseman. The Greaseman loves Priceline.com. Are you getting paid to do this live read for us, Greaseman? No, I'm not getting paid. No, not for this. I just love Priceline. On my apology tour, I'm going to a lot of hotels in a lot of different cities here. And I call Priceline. And you need to save money because you don't have a gig right now. That's right. I name my own price, and yadda-dada-dada. Priceline comes through and saves the Greaseman all kinds of money. Plus, if you use their service, they throw in that free hotel room. I could always use free nights here. When I'm sitting in my hotel room, drinking bone dries, thinking of how can I goof, goof on the wetbacks here. Thinking of my next act here. Maybe a little joke about the chinks here. I need a free night in a hotel. Yadda-doodle. Well, how did you do it? You gave him a call at 1-800-Priceline, or did you go on the web? I went on the web. My phone's tapped. People hate the Greaseman. I see that. Yadda-dada. So you went to www.Priceline.com? Yes. All right. And I named my own price for a hotel. And they said, yeah, we'll give you that price here. And lo and behold, I'm in a hotel for the price I named with Priceline, yeah. Were you slinging lead in the hotel room? I had my peace. I was packing heat ready to sling lead with anyone threatening the Greaseman. Woodle-doodle-deedle-die. Snarlingsy, snarlingsy, bone dry. What do snarlings mean anyway? I don't know. Oh. I'm having flashbacks, yeah. It just sounds good on the radio when you say it. Yes. I sound like Mr. Magoo, don't I? Yes, a little bit. I'm having a little battle-deedle-doo by George. Didn't Magoo have that little chink that I went around with him? Yes, he did. He used to say, Mr. Magoo, Mr. Magoo, yeah, why didn't they get in trouble there? How come Magoo never had to apologize like the Greaseman does for making fun of the little chink who said, Mr. Magoo, Mr. Magoo, what's that there? Well, it's Priceline.com. Oh, that's right. We're doing a commercial there. Priceline.com. All right, we're going to be talking to Johnny Lang in just a bit here. Stick around for that. And then later on on the show, Sammy Hagar coming in for a visit. I think we're going to be drinking tequila with Sammy Hagar, right? Yeah. He sent over the bottle. We might as well try this stuff today. Let's drive it. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with Rush, Closer to the Heart and Subdivisions. It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's our pal Johnny Lang, everyone. How do you? Johnny's back, man. When were you here last? Do you remember? A year ago or something. Was it that long? We haven't even been here a year. Believe me, it seems like 10 years. We've aged about that 10 years. You want to put your headphones on or no? Oh, I'm fine. I can hear you guys. Oh, really? Yeah. You won't be able to hear the callers. Oh, playing at Hammerstein Ballroom tomorrow night. Yup. All right. And here he is back playing in the imaginary ballroom a little while. So Anthony has a question about the Nickelodeon thing. How old was that? How long ago was that? I don't recall doing that, but somebody told me today, was it cute? Oh, it was just adorable. Yeah, no, I'm laying in bed and it's Saturday morning or something and it was that Linda Elibi show, that Who, What, Where, Nick News thing. And it's some kind of new, you could tell they take clips from all over. They're not Nickelodeon's little wacky bubble camera shooting things. Obviously it was taken from something else, little video clips and stuff. I was like, you know, hey look, it's Johnny Lang. Look, but he's 10. It was pretty funny. I think I remembered doing it a little bit. Really? Yeah, it was good. It was a very sweet, cute little piece. It had your long hair then. Yeah. Oh, oh, that's the one about my obsession with unicorns. That's what I remember. It's growing in though, your hair. I see that. Yeah. You're going with the gel thing? No, it's Dax. What? What is that? That's the every kind of oil you can fit in a jar. Dax? I thought it was something to do with there's something about Mary. No, Dax. Well, then I'd never have to put anything in my hair ever again. No, I wasn't going to say unless my train of thought. Dax? Yeah. It says you're only supposed to put it in your hair like once every three weeks. Really? I don't know. I don't have healthy hair. I use it every day. No, no, no. It kind of looks good. Yeah. So we've been jamming the new CD, Wander This World. Cool. We love it. Great, man. Want to tell the people about it that haven't picked it up yet? Yeah. It's a little different. Yeah. It's a little segue from the blues thing. It's kind of a more of a funky soul, R&B rock kind of album. I hear this. I put it in a genre. It fits in that very digital. We hear the R&B. Definitely. Cool. How's the touring going? It's great. Have you been touring ever since you saw us last? Yeah. Seriously? Oh yeah. Is it getting old? No. Really? No. No, man. You look at BB King and you've got no excuse to pick up touring. Yeah, but I mean come on. Look at back then and stuff. Why? But I mean he played like 260 shows a year. Still? Yeah. Well, he's got it. The white man took all his money. Well, isn't that the truth? Well, come on now. I think that's the truth, right? Didn't that happen? Like BB... Well, he didn't get the greatest record deals when he was first star now. I don't think anybody did, but I watched this show last night, this rock show, and they showed a bunch of black artists back in the 50s. And obviously white radio wasn't playing the black artists. So they had white guys doing the black guys' songs. But I mean they had Pat Boone doing a Womp Womp-a-Loo-ba. And it's like, hey, a Womp-a-Loo-ba-ba-loob. It just didn't work. So BB, I guess, got caught up in that whole thing too where white guys are doing his own. He wasn't getting money and credit for it. And now he's making up for lost time. Apparently. But you though, I mean come on. You could take some time off, right? Well... Hang out? Yeah. Do you get home and stuff or are you just like constantly touring? No, I get home, you know. Once a year. Really? No. I'm probably at home, you know, two or three months out of the year. And then what, like your friends come up, hey look, he's like the cool guy. Do you have any friends or is it just a drag? No, I have no friends. It's great. Really? I can't tell if you're serious or not. No, man, I got my buddies from second grade. Really? They didn't turn into dicks or anything? No, no. No, it's great. So like, hey man, hey Johnny, no it's cool. Johnny will buy the beers, man. He's like, you know, because what are they doing? Working like 7-Eleven or something? No, yeah, well Pepsi, my friend Brett works at the Pepsi plant in Fargo. Really? Yeah. So... Whoa. The Pepsi plant in Fargo? Oh yeah, that's huge. That's a gig. Yeah, you're the man if you got that job, right? That must be. Yep. Wow, I was going to leave Fargo if things didn't get better. Then I got the job at the Pepsi plant. Yeah. What else? Any other, you know, what? I've got to be the guy that works at the convenience store that just thinks when you come back home it's like, wow look, it's Johnny Lin. No, there's the guy that still lives with his parents and has a little job. Yeah, but wait, wait, wait. But most people your age still live with their parents. Right, right. No, well... We've got guys in their 30s that still live with their parents down here in New York. How old are you guys now? What, 18, 19? I'm 18, yeah. Yeah, same. 18. When was your birthday? January 29th. Really? So recently, what'd you do? You must have had a big 18th bash. I, uh, no. No? No. I was touring. I got a tap too and spent some time with my girlfriend who has the same birthday. Let me see the tat. There it is on the shoulder. Wow, look at that. That's some kind of Mayan artwork. Yeah, it's the Aztec calendar. And Johnny... Just in case you forget what day it is. Yeah, exactly. Look at my shoulder. In Aztec, it's nice. Now you're 18, you're on the road like nine months out of the year, ten months out of the year. Why a girlfriend? Why? I'm serious. Stability, Opie. If I was a rock star at 18, that would be the furthest from mine. Yeah, but look, he's been doing this for years now already. He's probably so sick of it. Yeah. No, you know, it's, I don't know. She's like my best friend. Look at us discussing your life. See, Opie, what it is in his life. No? Any book or anything going to come out about how bitter you are about having to tour so much? Definitely. Really? I was a kid and they had me rushing around. You're not going to come out with one of those things going, they never allowed me to put the child on. The record label held me down and made me cut my hair. That's why I was in the car with a transvestite. I was never able to be a child. I started preaching from the Bible, Samson and Delilah. I must cut your hair. I have to. Sit her with a hatchet. No, no bitterness or anything? No. You're a happy guy? Yeah. That's good. You come across that way. We're miserable. Anybody happy in this room, we're happy about it. We're getting happier though, I guess. Shut up. What's the, you guys got the beach scene? Tequila? Well, we got Sammy Hagar coming in a little later too. He's got this tequila or something from his place in Cabo. He goes on other radio shows but they're not allowed to drink on the radio because it's some kind of FCC law. But we're going to crack that puppy open and do some shots. You're 18? Oh, God, what's the drinking age in New York? He's 21. We're almost in Canada. Yeah, he's legal in somewhere. 21 it is. I remember, it was 18 when I turned 18 in New York. It was just like, you had a drink, right? But you got the tat. You usually don't get tats unless you're drunk. No, no, I've never. Your girl got a tat also? No, she didn't. Oh, I thought she... She was going to. She either chickened out or just pleaded, I'm not ready or something. That is a big commitment. Hey, who's this? Maria. Hi, Maria. You got a question for Johnny? No, actually I just wanted to let him know that we saw him in Philly on Sunday and he was so excellent and it's so amazing that he's so young and so talented. Yes, so supple and firm. What? Is he? He is. I was right here at the party. He is hot. So you're kind of bummed that he has a girlfriend? No, I share. Wow, where are you from? New York. Oh, I won't be there for a while. Oh, that's great. I saw you already anyway, but you're really good and keep it up. All right, you going tomorrow night, Hammerstein? No. No? Well, you never know now. You never know. Hopefully my boyfriend is listening and he's going to take me. All right. So long. Well, thanks for calling in. Bye. So in a fight, do you think you could kick all three Hanson guys' asses? No. Like what? Not Frank and Hanson, I don't think. I think if you took Frank and Hanson, you would kick all three of them. I think you would kick all three of them. I think you would kick all three of them. So in a fight, do you think you could kick all three Hanson guys' asses? No. Like what? Not Frank and Hanson, I don't think. I think if you took Frank and Hanson out of the mix, the older one. I couldn't even take the little one, man. They're really cool guys. Did you beat them? Yeah. I figured that would have to be something they would hook up. No. Like some stupid publicist thing. Wait, wait, where's the publicist? Like, we've got to get them together with Hanson. Get the girls on board. You got a good Hanson story? Well, yeah. I mean, they're... We're all drinking backstage, banging broads. We were put... But all of a sudden, Frank and Hanson... How bad is that? That poor older brother? I mean, you got the two little cutesy kids, right? And the chicks are just totally after them. After the shows, they do the meet and greet. And all the little girls come up, and poor Frank and Hanson's got to stand there like... And the kids' moms are coming up going, you're just a lovely boy. And meanwhile, you know, the other two Hansons are just getting the pick of the 16-year-old broads. You're a rizzle. But you're getting that, though, right? Let Johnny tell us Hanson's story. All right. What happened with you and Hanson? Well, they just... They live in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And they came to our show and hung out. They were just so cool. They're so cool, man. They're like so level-headed and... Really? I see. I think that's going to come out in a book, though. You can't be that young and have that kind of success. You know, what's the little one? Was it like in the fetus? Or was it like in the... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You can't be that young and have that kind of success. You know, what's the little one? Was it like in the fetus? I think originally the mother was in the gynecological startups and drumsticks were coming out of her womb playing the drums. That was the first Hanson recording. Really? Yeah. No, I don't think you could be that young and have that kind of success and stuff without being bitter and writing the book at, you know, 22. Well, and you have to have all ten fingers. Yeah, that's true. You know, you can't play before you get out of the womb. There's a behind the music special waiting to happen with Hanson, you know. Look at that other one with... what's his name there? Um, um, um, Lace Garrett. Did you see that one? Oh, man. Did you see that? Yeah. My dad told me about it. He said it was pretty... Oh, you got to see it. I think you being a young guy who's, you know, popular and stuff, you ought to watch that and take notes because you don't want to go that route. Don't let any of these idiots tell you what to do, including us. Hi, N.E.W. Hi. Hi, who's this? My name is Sherry. Hi, Sherry. What do you got for Johnny? Oh, I had a question for him. I mean, I definitely emailed it to you guys, but I guess you're not looking at your screen or your monitor or whatever. I had a question. He was on a TV interview and they were asking him why he failed his driving test. And he didn't answer. He said his grandma was watching. I didn't know if he could answer that now. Well, grandma's not listening, so Johnny, you got to fess up. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Look, he's flustered. You know, the Hanson brothers were there. We were drinking. We were drinking. No, I didn't study the book before I went in. So they let me by with the written on the third time. Wait, the written you failed? Oh, yeah. How do you find the written? Try it. Try it in LA, man. What does a stop sign mean? What did you guys do? I mean, come on. The guy could play guitar behind his back with his eyes closed. That driving thing. I don't know, yield. What does that word even mean? You guys took your driving test in the 30s. How does a horse and buggy make it across a four-way intersection? Oh, that hurts! That's funny. Thank God. That's the old N.E.W.T. He did make us look old, though. I remember taking mine, the radio on, bop, bop, bop, bop, bang-a-dang-dang. Hi, N.E.W. Hello. Hi, Johnny. How you doing? I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm doing well. Hi, you got a question for Johnny? It's all ladies calling him for you, Johnny. Of course. Excuse me? Go ahead, what's your name? How do you know I'm an old lady? I said all ladies. All ladies, not old ladies. Okay, I was beginning to feel insulted. Well, how old are you? We'll work on that. Excuse me? That means you're old. How much do you weigh? Yeah, I'm old enough to be his mother. And I'm a big fan. And I want to mother him. No, I don't. I have my own children. Thank you very much. I feel sorry that your mother didn't call you. He's on mission. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that your mother didn't take you driving so that you could have passed your test. Well, I did eventually pass it. So now I... But who taught you how to drive? Well, I grew up on a farm. That doesn't tell me anything. I grew up on a farm myself. So then you know what I'm talking about. I didn't see cars there. You didn't? Well, you drove the combine, didn't you? The combine. No, no. We had the carriages pulled by the oxen. Oh, okay. That's how old I am. Come on. Well, we had motor vehicles on my farm, so... No. We had motor vehicles on my farm, so... We had motor vehicles on my farm, so... We had motor vehicles on my farm, so... No. See, we didn't have any. My father couldn't afford them. All right. Do you have a question for Johnny? Yes, I do. I wanted to know if his music has been influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan. Oh, definitely. Of course. I think his influence to me was more just his energy as an artist instead of trying to copy his guitar licks. He was just so intense and that really rubbed off on me, I think. So, yeah, because the reason why I appreciate your music is because you play with as much intensity as he does. Oh, thank you. Well, that's the drugs, ain't you? No, it's not. He looks like a pretty clean kid. But I think you play from your heart and that's why you're so successful. Right on. Well, thanks for calling. Take care. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. No drugs or no drug problem, right? No. Good, good. No pot? Well, you know what it is. You grow up and you grow up in the public eye like this and a lot of people who went through that whole age bracket at least experimented with weed. You ever take a poke or anything? Well, I mean, the scars are clearing up. I see that. The track marks. No, that's good. That's good. You got to stop that. You got to get the monkey off your back. Yeah, definitely. The H, the big H, the horse, the smack. Hey, Spike. Yeah, what's up? What's up? You got something for Johnny? Yeah, I got a question. All right. We've seen Spike naked. She's really hot. Oh, it's Spike. Yeah. Yeah, you're raw. Well, I saw him about nine times opening up for Aerosmith a couple of summers ago. And I was blown away. Of course. He's great. I mean, 16 years old, just playing like you couldn't even imagine. I was amazed. She's a dominatrix, too, by the way. Wow. I know she's got a tattoo, Johnny. You do? It says pink. Right. It says what? Pink, right? Yeah. Right on the pubis. Because of Aerosmith? With an arrow. Because that would be that Aerosmith pink? Yeah. Oh. Aerosmith pink. That's the best tattoo I've ever seen in my life. It's a good one. It's like a roadmap. In the best place, maybe. Okay. Actually, I noticed a lot of mannerisms that possibly were picked up from Stevens. Yeah. Just wondering if you had any influence from there. Oh, you know, I think every band, you know, we've been out with touring or whatever, getting to see them live, it's kind of like learning through osmosis, you know. You pick up stuff. You don't really, you know, know you're picking up. And so, yeah. Right. But no, I think, you know, Steven and I went to the same mannerism school. I could explain a couple things. All right, Spike. Very cute. Thank you. Very excellent. Take care. All right, Spike. We love Spike. Checking in. Yes. All right. Let's take a break so we can get you playing in the imaginary ballroom. All right. One of Tuesday. Hey, what about that? One of Tuesday. What about that? One of Tuesday. One of Tuesday. One of Tuesday. Hey, what about that? 1027W and EW, the Rock of New York. It's Opie and Anthony and our pal, Johnny Lang. We love when he stops on by the studio. His Wander This World song rocked. Thanks, man. Are tickets still available for tomorrow's show? Really? Very surprised at that. Hammerstein Ballroom tomorrow night with Johnny Lang will all be there. Yes, we will. Hanging and partying. You want to play a quick game of Bra Bingo with us before you get out of here? Since I'm 18 now, yes. You could have played when you were 16. Something tells me he was. Yeah. Don't let him kid you. He was playing the Braille version of the game. You're going to have to prove that. What size is that? Well, we got our Bingo cards in front of us. This is our favorite game on the Opie and Anthony show. And it's a five by five Bingo card. The center square is the free boob square. And then we filled in random bra sizes. You can mark off your free boob square right now. All right. I'm going to circle out. You're given that. Tell them what order for them to come. No, that's cheating. Oh, man. Look at you. Hi, who's this? Hi, how are you? Good. How are you? You like Johnny Lang? Oh, yeah. All right. Oh, yeah. She gets all giddy. Are you excited to tell them your bra size? Oh, my freaking. You are a sick man. Wait a minute. This is good. I have like a small size on here. Oh, thanks, guys. 24 AAA. I got that. All right. You got a question for Johnny Lang before we get started. Yeah. I just wanted to say that I was at the concert last night. And I just want to say it was totally amazing. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Well, thanks for calling. OK. OK. Thank you very much. All right. Bye. OK. Bye. And now she'll call the other station. It's in sync there. Hi, any W. Any W. Any W. Hello. Hi. You're not a girl. No, I'm not. I was in a record store last night and I found a CD, Kid Johnny Lang and the Big Bang and Warner and what happened to that band? Or is that like a transformation of his current band? No, that's my evil parallel twin brother. No. I did that when I was like 13. That was the first album I ever did. Yeah. Yeah. That band, we kind of got defunct there. Everybody kind of went their own way. I saw you the first time about two years ago. You played in a hard rock cafe. Yeah. And it was a great window into what was to come. And I think you're really great. And I'll see you tomorrow night at the Hammerstein. All right. There you go, man. Take care. All right. Bye-bye. We need some Braziers. Yeah. We need Braz. Hi. Any W. Hi. Oh my God. I'm ruining your game. I've been going here, guys. Sorry. No, it's okay. That's okay. I can't believe I got thrown. All right. You got a question for Johnny? I'm going to tomorrow night's concert. And I just want to know if I can get backstage. Yeah. I just want to get an autograph. Pardon? What would you do for an autograph? Check, please. Check, please. Well, maybe some bacon cookies. This table has to be bussed. You're the one with the sick mind. You're going to ... Opie's like, oh, look at him. He's trying to get that little article in the daily news. What? He's trying. Hey, honestly, if you want to come to a mean greet or something, ask for ... No, I'm not going to say his name. Well, we can put her on hold. Yeah, we can do that. All right. Hold on the line, okay? Okay. All right. Well, this broad video is almost screwed that up for us. Hi. Any W. Hi. I have a question for Johnny Lang. How old are you? I'm 23. All right. Well, I don't want to do the bra-bingo thing. Well, let's say you did want ... I got a real question here. I'm a musician. I'm on this whole bra-bingo thing. Good. Good for you. That trash. I'm an artiste. I'm not going to go there. I just have a question. I'm a fan. All right? I'm just a fan. Let's say you were playing. What size would you ... Oh, God. Excuse me? What size would you say your bra is? Well, can I talk about my question first? Only if you give your bra size first. Oh, no. This is a game. This is the rules. I'm ready. All right. I'm going to get you all excited. I'll say them. I'm a 34 double D. All right. 31 double D. You have that? No, I don't. But I do. You're really playing bingo in there? Oh, I have a single D. Of course you're really playing. I think you got the cards. Of course we do. All right. What's your question for Johnny? All right. Here. First of all, as far as performing venues, I was just curious what your favorite thing was. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy.

I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. I was a little bit shy. She had a curse. She had a curse. She used the F word. We're on a delay so we can dump that out. We're on a delay so we can dump that out. We're on a delay so we can dump that out. Oh good. Oh good. Yeah. Which we did. Which we did. Wow. Is that amazing technology? She cursed. If you're still listening though, thank you. If you're still listening though, thank you. No, that was very observant of you. That was very observant of you. I was really nervous, you know, as Aerosmith. I was really nervous, you know, as Aerosmith. Well, you're opening up for Aerosmith. Well, you're opening up for Aerosmith. And it's a guard. Yeah, of course. So you know what I noticed? You have to get a little more bitter. Huh? You're really nice. I understand that you're fans and everything and you have to be very nice to them. Huh? You're really nice. I understand that you're fans and everything and you have to be very nice to them. But somebody like that, go, you know something? Kiss my ass. It's Madison Square Garden. If I was a little nervous stepping out on stage, I was nervous. What are you reading my emotion? Listen to the music, enjoy the show and shut up. Well, hey, if you were having... I got your money, screw you. That's what he means, right? That is Anthony talking. That is the guy. That is the guy. That is the guy. That is the guy. I'm not Johnny Lang talking. Let's move on here. Hi, Annie W. Hi, I'd like to play Robin. Oh, it's about time. What's your name? Betty. Hi, Betty. Hi. How old are you, Betty? Oh, you don't want to know. Sure. No, we don't. Go ahead. I'll be 43 this year. Oh, right on. Oh, can I ask John something real quick? Yeah, of course you can. Is he going to join the Hummer Club or what? Oh, the Tuesday Hummer Club. Yeah, we have a new club, John. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We have a new club, John. Yeah. Look, he's all nervous. I don't want to know this. I get a free Humvee. Okay. If you can travel 60 miles upstate, then yeah, sure. Well, we encourage the ladies to ... She might even pop her teeth out for you. Oh, wonderful. Thanks, John. And I know all the things about you. I'm kidding. Come on. We're just joking. We love our fans. I know. We encourage the ladies to give Hummers a Tuesday, John. Yeah. And it's been working, right? Yes, it has been. All right. What's your bra size? Thirty-six C. Thirty-six C. Hey, what do you have between your boobs now that you didn't when you were a kid? Yes. Your bellybutt. I have my first mark. All right. Thank you, Betty. Older than I am. Hey, what size was that? Thirty-six C. Right. Thirty-six. Oh, I got that. Thanks, Betty. All right. Okay. All right. Oh, good. That lines up with my free boobs face. You guys are making me out to be kind of a sick puppy here. Oh, no. You're getting into the game. It was a corner square for you. You're being coerced. Everyone can see it. Hi, NAW. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. I want to play Probinga. What's your name? It's Ellen. And how old are you? I'm thirty-nine. Okay. And what's your bra size? Thirty-four C. Thirty-four C. I have to have that. I saw that earlier in my car. You have to have it. Thirty-four C. Yes. Yes, me too. That's a good one. Ha-ha. Damn. I'm a little scared. I see that. It's a corner square. That's my corner too. I hope we don't have the same card. No. Okay. Now listen. What do your boobs look like? What do they look like? Like if you had to describe them in the form of a fruit, let's say. They're nice peaches, but they're not fuzzy. Peaches? Johnny Lang's holding up the lemons that we're going to be using for our tequila in about twenty minutes. Oh, good. All right. Well, thanks for playing Probinga. Thank you. All right. Come on. Hi, who's this? Elizabeth again. Oh, Elizabeth. I'm sorry. How are you? I'm good. I'm still here. All right. What do you got now? She's holding. Just click on the button again. She's holding. This is the girl that wants to go backstage. Oh, hi. All right. Hold on a second. Kevin, take a picture. Get Johnny's people to take a picture. Somebody's got to work these phones. God, she's still waiting. Hi, N.E.W. Come on, hold for the guy. All right. No, you're right here. You're on the air. Hey, guys, how are you? Good. What's your name? Melissa. Hi, Melissa. You want to play Bra Bingo? Yes, I do. 34B. 34B. Oh, I got that. It's the other corner. Me too. I got that. Come on. Oh, yeah, I got that. All right. You got a question for Johnny Lange? No. Okay. Oh, shoot. Give her bra size and less. No, that's better. Hi, N.E.W. Hi. Hi. Who's this? This is Shashan. Shashan. Yeah, I like that name. Thanks. Where are you calling from? From Manhattan. Okay. Yes, I do. All right, let's hear it. It's 34D. Oh. 34D? Yeah, I got that. I'm getting all the corners, but I need a ... Oh, that's good. That kind of lines up. All right, right on. It's Opie. It's Anthony. Sammy Hagar is in the building, Anthony. He's upstairs. We're going to get him in a couple minutes, and we're going to get hammered with Sammy Hagar. Because tequila. What is he making for us today? Some of these margarita things. Oh, right on. All right, stick around for Sammy Hagar. If you got a question for Sammy, you could ask that today. Save us for all week. I don't wear headphones. It's okay. Cool. It's the Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, two for Tuesday with Van Halen. Finish what you started. And ice cream, man, before that. Sorry, Sammy. Oh, man. You've got a bottle walking on that. I'm going to drink this whole bottle. Yeah, we were like, put the monitor down outside. Don't let him hear that one. Yeah, what are you doing, Andrea? Wait a minute. That's legal. She's the one who did it. If you program the music, knowing Sammy's going to be in here and you'll play that. We'll give her three shots in a row. You play that Cubic Zirconia Dave song? Ice cream, man. You're drinking tequila now, okay? It doesn't go with ice cream. Yeah, you brought the tequila. This is a step up for us because last week we were drinking 40s. Yeah. We were. We had a guy, Old Dirty, come in because there's some problem with one of these malt liquor advertisements in New York. They were saying it's racist and stuff. We wanted to taste test it. We had a guy come down and we were getting snotted on bad malt liquor. This stuff, though. Why would they say malt liquor is racist? I'm stirring it up here, man. I don't know. It was one of the posters because one of the posters advertising this malt liquor. Well, Lou Rawls was the first guy to advertise. Remember the bulls? Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. They had a brother endorse it so they figured it must have worked. They said they target the African American communities with the advertising. That's what's racist. Why do people get uptight about that? It's totally cool. Right. That's what we were saying. Exactly. Then the next thing you know, my picture is in the paper next to the Greaseman. Yeah. Yadda-dadda-dee. Well, you guys should drag me behind the car. Yeah, well, there you go. Drag me and we'll set the record straight. I'll show some people in Van Halen what I'm on. So let's... Come on. Come on. You must be so sick of that. Van Halen. I'm not about to go back through it now. No, no. Everyone knows. But the truth of the matter is, as truthfully as more time goes by, I have more and more good memories and less and less bad memories because in all honesty, the first ten years were fantastic. Right. It was a ball. You know, maybe we got in a couple arguments two or three times maybe. You know, never came to blows or nothing. Right. But that last year, which didn't come to blows, but kind of wish it would have, you know. I probably would have felt so pissed for about the first two months. Right, right. But, no, you know, it was just a bad... it was like a great movie with a bad ending, that song. Yeah, yeah. So I got nothing bad to say. The longer it goes, like you say, you forget about all the crap. That's like any relationship. Yeah. I hear an old song, I finish what you started and I start remembering, you know, recording it and eating it and stuff. And then you hear Ice Cream Man and you want to kill somebody. I got to get in your head really fast. So you leave Van Halen, okay? Yeah. And you're watching the MTV Music Awards. Yeah, exactly. And you see that mess, David Lee Roth walking on stage with the rest of the band. I was so uncomfortable. I couldn't watch it. Yeah, what were you thinking? Was that like one of those embarrassing moments? My stomach was churning. I'm going, oh my God. You know what I was honestly feeling? The first twisted thing that went through my mind was, what if someone thinks that's me? Oh no. You know what I mean? Like some guy watching it, you know, that doesn't really know who Van Halen is. What did they do to him? That's that Sammy Higger guy. What's his problem? Why is his pants up to his nipples? Why is he making all those funny gestures? Even like Eddie and the rest of the guys were so like uncomfortable on that stage. Oh, that was, man, I'll tell you. That's definitely a low point. But you know what? Here we go again. Now here's a good thing, you know. Everybody says, you know, well were you happy when the record didn't do so good without you? I'm saying, of course I was. You know, the last thing I want, you know, is like to leave the band like I did when I joined the band. And it goes on and gets more success. And probably Dave is probably still dying about that. I would have felt the same way. No doubt about it. That's a horrible thing. But when I saw him on there, I was worried because I was thinking, man, Dave's coming back in the band, you know. A lot of the fans are going to like that. And they're going to go out. What if they perform? And what if it's like really great? Right. You know, and I was sitting there kind of nervous, kind of, you know, didn't really want to watch. And man, all of a sudden he's up off the ground and said, yes! Everything's going to be OK. When you break up with any girl or anything like that, you don't want to see her dating a doctor and stuff. You want to see with the crackhead or something. It's like, oh, what happened, honey? Exactly. After me. See him on the street corner. Right. So you were relieved at that point, right? Yes, sir. And then we'll get the other Van Halen question out of the way. Then the new album comes out, Van Halen III. And honestly, we were working in Boston at the time. We were embarrassed to play that on the radio. We really were. And they would beg us to say, no, man, be cool. Gary Serone is from Boston and stuff. And he's a good guy. We like Gary a lot. And we interviewed him when he was in Extreme and stuff. But obviously they were trying to make him sound like you. I don't think they were trying. When I joined the band, I realized Eddie picks up a guitar. Sometimes it's not even tuned to anything. And it's just the way, you know, we made records. And we just play a riff. And if I like the riff, I'd start singing to it. I would write some lyrics, come up with a melody. We had a song. Boom, right? You don't even know what key they're in sometimes. So the point is, that's the way it goes. Gary's voice, you know, my voice was okay in those registers. Right. But obviously it was a little bit of a strain. Because to me, he's singing better in Extreme. But I'm not putting Gary down. This ain't his fault. He's totally cool. Everything's fine with Gary. I got no problem. Well, what singer wouldn't want to step into that situation? Exactly. It's a good situation for him. It just sounded like a bad parody of what you were doing in the band. That's what scared me. Because Gary Serone has a great voice. Well, singing to the guitar chords and the changes in Eddie's tunings and stuff, you know, he's a unique guitar player. And singing to those kind of changes that he does kind of is very restricting. You almost have to do certain things. And finding a melody to sing sometimes was difficult. Other than the song I finished when you started, which was mainly my trip. Right. Some of the songs that were a little more melodic were like, that was kind of my input. And I would get some of the jams where I would just yell and scream a couple things and let some music go by and yell and scream again because there wasn't much of a melody you could really put to some of that type of music. And unfortunately, this was like an Eddie solo record. This is unfortunate for Gary. And there was just tons of those kinds of songs. Normally, I'd weed those out. I'd be saying, oh no, Eddie, get that out of there. Let's put a different chord change there. No, you can't go to that chord because it screws up the melody I got going here. You know, we wrote together. It was a good thing. But I don't think Gary knew about doing that. And he just tried to make it work. It's just not singer friendly. Some of those guitars. Yeah, yeah. You've got to like scream your balls off. It should have been instrumental. Yeah, there was a lot of stuff going on with the guitar work on that album. But it's difficult walking into a band with what? How many years? Eleven with me, eight with Rommel. Twenty years of history and throwing a new voice in there. And when you're not seeing it, you're just hearing it, you're going, Jesus, it sounds like Van Halen. Some things are a little amiss. It's like the retarded brothers. Not at all. Van Halen. Do you remember where you were when you heard the album for the first time? Yeah, I was at my house in Hawaii and someone sent it to me in the mail. Oh yeah? Way before it came out. I let it sit on the counter just like the MTV thing. I let it sit there for about three days. I kept looking. I'm saying I'm not ruining my vacation. You know, what if it's great? Right, right. What if it's great? I put it on. No one said a word in my house, man. I had it cranked. I had a couple of people over. They conned me into it actually. They said, come on, let's hear it. Let's hear it. You know? Let's hear it. I had to get great. A couple shots of tequila, maybe a big hit of a dude, you know? And then put it on, about four songs into it. I did it once again. I jumped up and said, yes! Oh boy, you guys are dragging me right back through this. You were relieved, huh? Hey, your club. Yeah. Cabo Wabo. Now I thought that was always yours? Or was that all? I built it. I was in Van Halen at that time and I'd been going down there before then. I had a place down there. I lived down there part time. I used to go down there and write all my lyrics. So I started building this club. It was to be a tequila bar, Tequila Mascale bar. That's where my whole thing is. I went to the town of tequila and I discovered all these great little boutique tequilas that you'll never see. The town of tequila. It's a town of 35,000 people now, man. It's like Napa Valley or it's like Bordeaux or something, man. It's like bumper to bumper and stuff. used to be donkeys in carts, you know, but anyway, you know those shows you've heard of them. So I built this club and our manager at that time, Ed Leffler, who passed away in 93, he says, or 94, he said, you know, I think I said, Ed, hey, I want to make this a big grand open. I want to fly all these other bands and musicians down and jam, you know, with us. And he goes, well, you're going to get the guys and the band into it, but he goes, you better call a band Halen's Cabo Wabo. And I'm going, oh, that's fine. You know, so it's one of the problems. You guys are kind of into it. MTV jumped in it and we charted a big plane and threw all these celebrities down, have a big blowout party in them. After Ed Leffler died and it wasn't somebody to really take care of the business of it, they just weren't interested in keeping the quality of the place up. And I was. And you know, you got to put new furniture in a place like that about every six months because people get like trashed on tequila, man. They're breaking everything in the place. Every person I know is puked into Cabo Wabo. You know what I'm saying? Right on. So you have to keep it going, you know, and they just weren't interested in keeping it alive. And I love the place. And I go down there and jam with people. I just jam with John Wissle down there two weeks ago with Matt Sorem and myself. We did a who set an hour and a half impromptu places, about 400 people in there just sitting around dancing to whatever ACDC and stuff for the box. All of a sudden we walk out there on stage, jump up, man, it's like, whoa, man. I mean, you know, it's really cool to do that. You got a whole international clientele down there. A lot of Americans are all Americans. Mostly American. Yeah, I mean, you get some people from Mexico City and some, you know, rockers from Mexico over there, but it's a pretty isolated little place there, you know? Yeah. Cool. Well, let's take a quick break. We're going to break open the tequila. You can have a few shots with us, Sammy. Oh, sure. Well, not a few. I got to play some time. You guys are starting to start my motor a little early. Yeah, you play in the Hard Rock Cafe tonight. It's going to be a great, great time. We're having a party. What we're doing is going around the country. There's 13 Hard Rocks today. Hard Rock worldwide love my tequila and they want to put it in the bars. And they said, well, so would you come around and promote it? And I said, well, if I can mix it with the new song and the record somehow. But the album's not out yet, but we're going around. We're just playing parties. No tickets of it. You can't buy a ticket. It's not for sale. It's a party. We've been giving away all weekend. I don't want people puking on Elvis's jacket or anything in the Hard Rock without tequila, though. 1027WNEW, the Rock in New York. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony and Sammy Hagar. My records sound so bad. What is he saying over there? You ever blow your voice out? Oh, yeah. I mean, you're always balls out like that. I'm just wondering if you ever just went to sing and nothing came out. Yeah, a few times, but that's usually from being sick. I don't usually just blow my voice out completely because I have a pretty tough voice. But if you get sick, you get a cold, you know, and then try to sing. Did you do any training or anything or that just came natural from? No, it's kind of like I said, you know, it's like training is in the bottle. There you go. I trained on stage. That's why it took me so long to make it. I did all that training, you know, as a professional. Right, right. Well, can we try the tequila? Yeah, let's give it a whirl, man. Well, what are the listeners? How are they going to know what this tastes like and it looks like? This blue bottle looks like the ocean in Cabo, OK, if you're sitting, you know, in an airplane, the beautiful ocean, kind of turquoisey. It's got the whole pitch. And it's... The smell. The smell. Now, that was something I like. We call it vitamin T. It's almost good for you. You don't need a salt, a lime. As the song says, Mastaquila, take your vitamin T with salt and limon slice. A limon in Mexico is not a lemon. A limon, you tell a guy you want a lemon, they give you a lime. You say, oh, I'll have a lime, and you still get a lime. It's a limon. OK. Now, you were telling me... Oh, Sammy's pouring them. Pouring them, yeah. OK. And that's just a little bit. Now, look, tonight, I'm doing a little party, and I might be doing a lot of this later on, OK? A lot of it during the show and a lot of it after the show, and I've got to have some kind of a system here, you know? But we're going tonight, man. I want to check this out. Look at the line forming over here. Everyone's... Listeners, you should see this line. You've got to get this tequila. Is Gary, Gary, you having one? Yeah, look at this. Is Gary our boss? Is he having one? Gary! It's Tequila Tuesday, everyone. And since it's two for Tuesday, we're going to need another tequila. Look, I filled that one up real high, and everyone could pass it around. I'll tell you how. People are lined up outside the door. They're just coming in. All right, you know what I mean? You don't have to worry. It'll kill anything. You can drink right after someone with the flu. It doesn't matter. Same cup. And we've never had this many people in the studio. I think we've got to have Tequila Tuesday every week. It's funny what Tequila does. I always say at my club, you know, I'm saying, where's your favorite place to play in the world? I say, I'm going to the club. I'm going to the club. I'm going to the club. I'm going to the club. I'm going to the club. I'm going to the club. My club, you know, I'm saying they say, where's your favorite favorite place to play in the world? I say, it's a cobble wobble and it's not because I own the place. It's because everyone's drunk on tequila and when a bunch of people drunk on tequila are a blast. You know, it's like, you know, you get a bunch of 400 500 people drunk on beer in a room and what do they do? They start fighting and tequila, man. People start taking their clothes off and we're hoping for that today. different thing. I'm noticing the smell isn't the same as most tequila I have had because it doesn't smell all that strong. Look at them coming. It doesn't have this chemical smell to it. No, there's no chemicals. This is pure. It's all natural. It's got to be good then, right? Natural. No preservatives, no chemicals. Look at everybody coming in here to drink tequila. We honestly, someone has to take a picture. There's like 20 people in here. We got about 20 people in the studio. You guys blew it. I find it on this video. I would have started selling these shots. You should have. How many more we got? How many more? We're going to do it. We're going to all do it together. Walk around the other way, guys. A couple of people got real big ones now. My judgment was real bad on a couple of these pours. Now, I'm going to do it. If anyone has to puke, here, Ben, pull out the garbage can over there. We've got a half full glass. Don't slam it, folks. Now, problems. Sammy said you should use sea salt because the salt with the chemicals like iodized, that's not good. I'm going to use that anyway. This is test of salt. And then a piece of lemon, which should be lime because of the lime flavors in tequila. And real tequila, pure tequila has a little bit of lime flavor and a little bit of salt flavor. So you want as pure as salt as possible when you're using a pure tequila and it's pure lime or lime, you know, nice, ripe lime. Lemon will do, man. It's just, you know, it's all good. You think anyone's listening to this anymore? I have a feeling a couple of people just took off and went down to the liquor store. Interactive radio. Anybody else more here? All right. Well, this is almost like a dream come true, man. I'm doing shots of tequila with Sammy Hager. Hey, it's the next best thing to be in the Cabo Wavo. I'll tell you that. All right. Is everyone ready? Yes. Wait, wait. You don't need salt. Look, look. What are they doing? This is good tequila, man. If you want to do it, you can, but you don't need it. Wait, wait, wait. Sammy, do a toast. All right. Do a toast or something. I raise a toast to peace, love and happiness and mas tequila. Mas tequila. All right. Wow. Oh, man. Yeah. That'll make you happy. Wow. That'll make you happy. Let the party begin. Oh, this room just came up a notch. Wow. Suddenly I want to hop in my car and drive over mailboxes. That's the best tequila you've ever tasted. Wow. I like that. I like that a lot. That is good. It'll burn in your stomach. I mean, it's alcohol, but man, but it's taste in your mouth is good. It sure makes you salivate. Yeah. It gets all the juices flowing. You're going to have your tongue down some girl's throat, man. Man, I'm telling you, you're there. Right on. Wow. That was good. I want to put M80s in mailboxes now. Hey, Carrie, break open your bottle, man. What are you doing? Oh, look. Carrie's got his phone on it. He's taking it home with him. We'll get you another bottle. We'll get you another bottle. Was that it? That was the whole bottle? That was the whole bottle? We drank the whole bottle. Wow. Look at that. Egg. And I think that's backwash. Yeah, a little bit in the bottom there. All right, Sammy. Wow. You got to tell us about the new album. It's coming out, what, March 23rd? March 23rd. It's called Red Voodoo. Yes. We've been playing Masta Killa here at N.E.W. and getting lots of requests for it. Well, you know, it's pretty much a party record and a party tune, and it's not that I tried to make that. Like March in the Marsh is a very serious record for me coming off the Van Halen split. I was a little angry and had some little whiter eyes. I want to get out of here. You know, I take it out in my songs instead of my wife, you know. So after that, you know, I put a new band together. When I did 110 shows, you know, the Wobble Readers, and we played combo probably seven, eight times last year. And I just started getting real festive about the whole thing. You know, it just started getting better and better. Right. It's like a dog off the leash, man. You start having fun, you know, going around sniffing everything, you know. So I was having a pretty good time. And as when I started writing, it just started coming out. I just started writing down in Cabo a lot. I started writing about the situation with the band. So we just got together at my house. The whole band moved into my house and we wrote, produced and did the whole record. My house is great. Screw that. I need another shot. But it's a party record. Well, let's check out Masta Killa here. All right. It's Sammy Hagar off the... Wow, I'm already... Look at him! Look at him! Come on, man! Hello! I live in South America. New York City. The Rock of New York. 1027WNEW. The latest from Sammy Hagar. Off the CD Red Voodoo, which comes out March 23rd. That's Masta Killa. You're right there. Oh, yeah. I'm feeling a little better now. Already? Oh, you mean it was cut? It's funny because we're talking about Sammy's new CD Red Voodoo and I'm listening to him and all of a sudden I just start zoning it out like... And it just came over me, man. That shot. It was a good high. It's a spirit. Well, you poured me a double shot, though. I must say. You did the whole thing? Yes. Yeah, the beginning of the bottle, people got the bigger shots than at the end of the bottle where we had to ration it out. But I got to tell you, I got the first cup full. It was funny about five months ago, six months ago, when Tequila first came to America, when the first dates we came to was back here in New York and I came back with Tequila Company and we went around and had a bartender convention here outside of town out by the airport and we invited all the bartenders because I have a drink that's made of this called a Wobble Rita which is the name of my band. You were supposed to make those for us today. It's a straight up like a martini served type margarita instead of, you know, it's shaken and but it's got a couple other mixtures in it and it's got to be done right. The recipe is on this little tag on the bottle. So I wanted to show all the bartenders how to make a Wobble Rita. So we had 150 bartenders in a room and I got up there and I showed them how to make a Wobble Rita and then we just made a bunch of them and just got trashed. I mean trashed, man. Left this town and went to another state, you know. And did the same thing over and over again. I want to tell you something, that was about four days of a blur. So now you've got to watch it in New York because they take your car away if you're driving. Now, look, see now that you have a license. You know, I do, but it's not good. I got a couple of strikes. Really? Look, my whole trip is, you know, I can't drive 55. I tell everyone, I said, oh, no, no, that's that's no longer represent Sammy. Now I'm represented by Moss Tequila. You know, represents my life for the next 10 years. And I try not to mix it. It's like go out and get plastered and then drive fast. Oh, boy. The cops must just pull you over and like, oh, look, it's Sammy Hago. All right. I can't drive 55. Moss Tequila. The other day says, you know, I used to always say, you know, a couple of me always say, oh, man, you know, I couldn't see that. I didn't know how fast I was going or whatever. Yeah, just tell them, no, man, I've been drinking so much tequila, man, I can't see the speedometer. That'll work. Yeah, that's why. Yeah, the mayor's loving you right now. Yeah, they take your car now in New York if you're driving. I wouldn't drive in this town. You guys are crazy to drive in this town. I get in the back of a taxi. Well, that's that's close. Where are you going? Take a couple of whacks and you mind if I take the sidewalk? It's fun, man. All right. Everyone wants to talk to Sammy. Let's grab a few folks. Let's talk to some listeners. These people got to say hi. Any W. Hi, sir. Yeah, you're live on the air with Sammy Hagar. That's the Hagar squeal. It's a phenomenon we hear. Obviously, she's been drinking. I'm only 15. I haven't been drinking. So don't start now. OK, listen, don't get me in trouble with your mom now. Yeah, really? Hi, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Pretty good. What are your top five favorite bands? Right now, my favorite band is Tool. I really am. We love Tool. I think it's about the coolest band happening right now, the most innovative, best sounding, weirdest, you name it. I just really dig Tool. And after that, geez, man, I don't know. I mean, I'm a Peter Gabriel fan, which is Tool Peter Gabriel. This guy's crazy. Take that tequila away from this guy. But I don't know, it's just off the top of my head. Sorry, no Hanson or Nsync. I don't like them. They suck. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right. Hi, Any W. Hey, what's up, guys? What's going on? All right, you're having fun? I'm having a blast. What's up, man? How are you doing? Everything's good, man. This is the first time I've ever sat in a radio station. I agree with you. Every time I see David Lee Warts, you see a constipated dog shaking his leg. I didn't say that. You agree with me. Now, wait a minute. You're saying you agree with me as if I said that. No, no, no. The way he looked on the Video Music Awards. Oh, yeah, that was pretty rough. That was rough. My name's Peter from Wontore. I see you at Jones Beach. Just tons of people. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I'm a big fan of yours. I like venues like that. You know, to me, being a singer, it's much more fun to sing and a little more relaxed on your voice to sing outside. Especially when there's a little ocean air and stuff and some kind of moisture in the air because you get inside of a building where there's been 18,000 people and they're breathing up all the good air and smoking cigarettes all night. By the time I get up there, they've been in there seven, eight hours, doing a lot left. It's hard on your voice. It really is. So I really enjoy open air. And I remember last time Jones Beach, we had that big rain. And I don't know if you were there when it rained. I was really. Yeah, we were there. So I jumped out in the rain with y'all and ruined my cordless microphone. It cost me about 5,000 bucks. Hey, man, but you guys always run a good show and I'm looking forward to the new record and have fun tonight. Thank you very much. Take care from this new record and good luck, brother. It's a rocker for you, man. All right, man. Stay with you guys. These guys are the best in New York. I know. They're cracking me up. I'm having the best time I've had on radio in years. They will. You will. Take care. Have a good night. Hey, thanks, buddy. Take care, man. All right. Howard, treat you good this morning? You know, he didn't, he went too hard on me. He kind of endorsed me for the first time. And now he's on my side, you see. You know, before, he was like, you know, he was on Ross' side. Now he's on my side. He always likes the guy that's kind of out in the cold. Right, right, right. Well, we grew up in New York, so obviously we listened to Howard. I remember him bashing you on one video. Oh, man. He got his head buried up in the ass of Eddie Van Halen on one of those videos. Look at him. What is he, kissing his ass? Yeah, Howard's silly, man. You know, the first time I went in there, I was really upset. I was going to go in there and just really kick his ass. And he kind of disarmed me before the thing. He was real nice to me. Yeah, but you know what happened? Because I heard that. Because I remember that whole thing. He's kind of a phony, though, because as soon as you left, then he trashed you. Well, we kept listening to him. He did, though. I was always wondering if people listen after, right? I did. Exactly why, because he did, you know. Because that one time he was kissing your ass saying how David Lee Roth sucks. As soon as you left the studio, he starts trashing you and saying, man, you know, let's get David Lee Roth on the phone. And I was like, what a pussy, man. You had Sammy right there. Tell him how you really feel. But that was a few years back. He's a funny guy, man. He's a funny guy. All right. Hey, you got to, he's got an advantage. First of all, you got to realize something. Seven o'clock in the morning, Sammy Hagar on the East Coast. Now, I'm a West Coast person. Oh, yeah. Came from Cabo. That was three o'clock in the morning. Wake up. And I'm telling you, I wasn't quite ready. I was a little grogged out, a little slowed down. Right. After I left, I come up with some of the best answers. All right. You got a question for Sammy? Yeah. How you doing? All right. Hey, OP. How are you, Anthony? Hey, Sammy. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good. Hey, listen, man. I just want to say you guys are great, man. I mean, I love listening to your show. And Sammy, let me say something. I mean, you're great. I love your voice. I mean, I got albums of you. I mean, I even go back to when you were in Montrose. Wow. Wow. That far back when you were playing, when you were doing, you know, Rockin' Nations, Space Station No. 5. I mean, incredible, you know? I mean, I think, you know, personally, what they, you know, they got the solo guy playing for Van Halen. Thanks, man. I don't know. I mean, I'm close to what you are. I don't know. Thank you very much, man. That's a high compliment. I mean, really. Well, people don't, people, a lot of people, I guess, don't realize you had a huge career before Van Halen, you know? Yeah. People forget that sometimes, you know? Yeah. The Red Rocker. Everywhere but New York City. Yeah. It was a funny thing, you know, as a solo artist throughout my career. I was, you know, I'd headline, you know, arenas everywhere. And I would never come to New York because the first time I came here, I opened for Kiss. Well, not the first time. As a solo artist, Montrose, I actually played here for The Who one time. But I opened for Kiss and I got boot off the stage at Massacre. Get out of here. What happened? Off the stage, by the third song, I pulled down my pants. I started to yawn. I gave it a little shake at him. I smashed the guitar up and I said, you people, right? And I split. And I said, I'll never play that city again. Wow. I'm serious. And then I came back with the group Boston about, you know, five or six years later. And I said, okay, I'll try it again. Open for them was kind of a mediocre response but I made it through the set. Who were you opening for when they booed you? Kiss. Oh, Kiss. Way back in the old days, you know, in 77 or something, 76. Well, yeah, anybody up there before Kiss would have gotten boot off. It was rough, man. Oh, that's rough. You know? You know, I had kind of a, I was nervous, you know, I didn't really, and then, you know, through Van Halen, we, you know, did really well here all them years or anything. Sure. So I'm over it now. I'm okay. But I skipped over, you know, three lockbox, VOA, you know, to ask the promoters around here. I didn't play. I played outside of here, anywhere. I did not play on a deal. And, well, New York can be rough. Weird thing, you know, for me. Hi, N.E.W. Hey, Sammy. Yeah? Just want to let you know that I'm sure a lot of people stroke your ego a lot but no one's ever going to confuse you with wrong. I'm going to talk Van Halen for a quick second, then I'm going to ask you a question. What you brought to the band was a great musician and a hell of a voice. Thank you very much. All right. You showed growth on every album and you peaked with balance. Terrific, terrific vocals and music on that album. That's pretty profound. Quick question for you. Quick question. Uh-huh. And it was 11 years of Van Halen. I saw every show with you. What's the difference now, torn with the band? I'm sure they're your friends. But after spending so much time with a group of guys where you seem to have so much fun together and so much respect for one another, what's the difference now? He's making me tear up. Man. You know, there really isn't a lot of difference because when you put a band together of people that you really enjoy and love to play with, it's really the same. My new band, they're just, I have the same fittings with these guys as I did with Van Halen. The difference was with Van Halen is that we were four really strong, equal individuals that were really individuals. And when we got together, a special thing happened. And it's like being a solo artist is different from that. Van Halen was a chemistry of four people. And as you see, one person leaves and the chemistry changes. That's totally true. And I tell you what, I think they probably would have been better off doing an instrumental album because after having you in the band, there was no place to go but down. Where are you, in the monkey cage? What's going on in the background? But the thing is, I'm a father now. So am I. But when you're a solo artist, the difference is that you can kind of do anything you want when you want to do it and it's a lot purer. There you go. I like that. I like that. That makes me homesick, buddy. Put her on the phone. Put that kid on the phone. I'm going to watch my son. All right, buddy. That's good. Okay, keep rocking today. Thank you very much. How old is your kid? Mine? Oh, three. I have a three-year-old daughter. I heard that scream and I assumed it was a girl. The little daughters are squealing all the time. Would that totally change your life? Yeah, man. It kind of hooks you right up. You know what it does? It gets your priorities straight. All this time you think about me, me, me, me, even with your wife. You fall in love. You think you're just so in love with your wife. All right, oh man, just love her more than anything in the world. But it's still me, me, me. It's like, show me how much you love me. I'm like, I'm going to be a good boy. That's what it's all about. You're never sure that she loves you enough. You want her to show you so much how much she loves you so that you can let go and show her, right? Did Sammy have to take the garbage out and stuff? I take the garbage out. Did you get the edge? Sammy Hagar, vacuum the carpet. No. No? You don't tell me what to do. Did you tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? No. You don't tell her that? You don't tell her that? But when you have a baby, and that little head pops out and you see that little face. I'm telling you, you are changed up. It's no longer me, me, me. It's like I'll do anything for this thing. I'm going to make sure this human being is safe, happy and I mean, you know, I swear it's just like you just you know the true meaning of love. It's about given, not taken. And that baby to me did that for me. I'm down with it. Hey, you have a question for Sammy? I already be a selfish piece of crap. I can try to take too long. I'm on a volunteer fire when I got a house burning down. Whoa. Are you serious? Yeah. Burning down the house. Wait, are you on the way to the fire? I worked on a street. I'm at work. I've been out of work for like 45 minutes and we got a fire, but I wanted to ask my question. I heard you talk. You just seem like such a big man about everything that happened. And that's really cool. But I was like, especially earlier when you were still all kind of PO about and he decided to go solo. Did somebody call you up? Want to be your drinking buddy and like be all pissed off? Yeah, just bad mouth everybody. Did he call you up and was like, hey, come on, let's go get some beer. You insane? Not a question is that. I had a couple friends. You know, that's a really, that's a pretty unique question because it's true. You know, I had a couple friends like, you know, publicly, everyone told me, all my professional people, you know, my manager, my lawyer, you know, don't go bash them. Take the high road, Sammy. Take the high road. I'm going, you know, and it's like, so. But I had a couple of friends that I could sit down with and say, man, you know, we didn't necessarily get trashed and we just did it. It just would turn that way. And there was a couple of people that now there was a guy that used to make Eddie's guitars. I'll even say it was straight up, man. He was the guy who used to make Eddie's original guitar. And then Eddie got in a big beef. So this guy, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, back up like five seconds. At least you know Sammy's getting comfortable. No, so this guy, man, he was upset with Eddie very much so. Right. And Eddie left the company and started another guitar company, endorsed another guitar. And me and this guy, we got together on it, man. Oh, really? Just a fashion? We went off, man. I'm telling you, he told me stories and I told him stories. It was actually, it was very inventing. You know, it was really therapy, you know. It's healthy. I actually felt a lot better after that. I think a lot of people want to see a pay-per-view, you and David Lee Ross. That'd be huge. That'd be like the Tyson Spinks fight. 72 seconds of the first round. All right, man. On 51, engine 51, fire in progress. 6 o'clock, I think. Hi, Eddie W. Hi. I have a question for Sammy. How are you doing, Sam? I'm doing great now. Man, you're the best. Thanks. I just want to say that you're a lot better for Van Halen than David Lee Ross ever was. Wow, revelation. It's so funny, man. It's like all this is coming around now. You guys should have popped up, you know. Thank you very much. I think the Ross era was very good. It just was different, you know. Like I said, chemistry is different. There's three different eras now. Every new guy in a band like Van Halen, because it's a chemistry band, it's not about one guy solo trip, and it just makes for chemistry and each guy is different. And it was two different bands. I have a question. When you play on your own, do you play any VH songs that you play with them? Oh yeah. Like tonight we're doing this party over at the Hard Rock. I'll probably do maybe three. You know, we're playing about an hour, 20 or so. We don't play a long time because it's just a party, you know. Everybody's so drunk by the time we finish. We play as long as we can. Right. And it's kind of like, yeah, maybe I'll play three Van Halen songs. And when I do my normal two and a half, three hour show, I'll play like six or seven Van Halen songs and a couple of Montrose tunes. I tried tonight. It's really kind of like a greatest hit set. You know, it's got, you know, all the all the hits from my past career and all three of them. And they're all three Van Halen songs. Isn't that weird? And when are you touring on your own? The tour starts May 1st, actually, and I think we'll be up here in the summer. Awesome. All right, man. Thanks for having me here, Beth. Thank you. Bye. All right. Yeah. I'm having so much fun though, man. But we just everything else I have to do. Let's just bring them down. Yeah. But it's just got the booze here. We got a good company. You can't leave. You brought the beer. I brought the tequila actually. It's kind of like the guy in the band who can't you can't fire him because he has a truck in the back. I think that's how Roth got the job in Van Halen. I did read that. Didn't he have a P.A. or something? I swear to God. I'm not joking. It was like that was the deal. I read that he was doing disco tunes. Yeah. Michael Anthony and Eddie were the original singers. Which is their tape for that? I don't know. I love to dig some of that out. Yeah. They told me those stories themselves and then Roth had a truck and a P.A., a band and a P.A. And I was like, Hey, you want to be in our band? What do you do? It doesn't matter. You got the equipment. Cowbell. You're in. All right. Work out a little bit more. I guess we got to let them leave. All right. All right. So happy to be here. Thanks to Sammy Hagar wanting to sign off with you people, but don't change the dial because I think they're going to play some more of my music. Hell, yeah. Don't I'm going to do like a dinner, Howard. I'm listening to you guys. We're going to come out of commercials and say, you know, you suck. Oh, come on. We would never do that. I'll be back. It was straight, brah. No, we're a little we're real here. Man. All right. Well, Sammy Hagar. Thank you, man. The new CD comes out March 23rd. It's red voodoo playing the hard rock cafe tonight. And we're playing Monster Killer here on the radio. A lot of people love it. So for home delivery call 1-800-NY-TIME. People just yapping. See what Tequila does to everyone. Everyone's towels now. I'm going to go downstairs for a cigarette. Well, we've got to thank Sammy Hagar for stopping by. Honestly, God, he's a great guy. What a blast. He's awesome. Cart Blonde, she can come back anytime. I'll bring some of that Tequila with me. Here's something a little different. Let's play some music today. Oh, that's right. That's right. The last hour and a half since Johnny line came in has been a complete blur. The Rock of New York 1027W&W, Two for Tuesday with the Black Crows. Track from By Your Side, that's only a fool. And now let's begin from the first one. It's Ophie and Anthony and Ralph D'Otora in the studio. Our buddy, our pal. Hey, listen you son of a bitch. I don't need this crap anymore. I'm not going to take this to watch the game. You can kiss my ass. What? What? You want to fight? You want to fight me? What? You want to fight me? You're not good enough to shake my hand. I'm not good enough for you anymore. You will tell me I'll kick your ass. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, give me a hug. You're like my best friend. I'm sorry. I call you out. I call you out, man. Come here. That was good stuff. Yeah. When do you get to go to work and do shots of tequila with Sammy Hagar? When you're a DJ in New York. It's just amazing. I'm stunned. That was great. Yeah, that was good. Ralph, did you have fun? Oh, great time. Did you get one of the early shots of tequila? I got one of the early cups, yeah. It was about half full. I got to tell you guys. These are coffee cups. You should tell them. These are coffee cups from the machine. And when he started pouring, there were only about five of us in the studio. And then when we're talking, more people started coming in, so we had to make the shots smaller. But the ones that got them first, which is Ralph, me, and Alvin, they were pretty full. They were really double shots or shots. And I was just saying before Sammy came in that I can't do tequila anymore. I had a bad experience way, way, way back. And I really haven't drank it since. Were you going to re-experience? Well, I didn't want to be a pussy. So I got to slam the shot. Sammy's here. He poured me a shot of tequila. You can't punk out in front of Hagar with his own tequila. What are you going to do, punk out? He doesn't have the shot glass. He's just pouring whatever he felt like in the coffee cups. So I drank it. And for a split second, I'm like, oh, man, this stuff's coming up. No way. Oh, dude, if you would have hurled it. Honestly, I really like the tequila. Fantastic. Just because of the experience way back when, just a hint of the tequila maybe. You're okay now. Yeah, I'm fine now. It's wonderful tequila. It really is. Cabo Wabo tequila? Is that what it is? Tequila Tuesdays. Let's have Tequila Tuesdays, everybody. He's a good example of one of the guys that have been in the business for a lot of years. And it's not like when the newbie bands come in and they act like asses. Third Eye Blur and Third Eye Blind. But you hear what Eddie was saying? But he's honest. He's really honest. He comes in and pretty much told the story with the Van Halen. And there's no real BS coming out of him. I liked it. He's a good guy. He's a good man, too. He's playing blackjack with Eddie in Atlantic City. Eddie, grab that mic. You didn't know how to play blackjack? Tell him the story. I went to see this thing that he's doing tonight. On a Sunday night, he played down in Atlantic City at the Taj. Afterwards, at the end of the show, he said, all right, I'll see you guys at the tables. Now, everybody would say that, you know, I'll see you later, whatever. Down at the tables, I'm sitting there playing blackjack. He pulls up the chair next to me. And he's like, you know, I've been a Sammy Hagar fan since Montrose's first record. So I'm like, this is cool. Starts ordering drinks. Where's the waitress? Where's the drink service? And he's betting pretty heavy hands. Obviously, he can swing. He's got a couple of blocks. Yeah, so I'm playing like the table minimum and I'm just like hanging out. I'm losing my shirt. But Sammy, as much as I love the guy, doesn't really know how to play blackjack because he'll have like an 11 and not know to double down. Oh, god. He's got like 300 out there and on one hand, he had like 300 bucks. And he drew like an 11 and the dealer had like a three show and he's just like, I'll stand. No, no. Oh, double down. So I know, Sammy, you've got to double down. And he goes, that's 300 bucks. It's a six hundred on hand. Sammy, you've got to play by the rules. So he slides out six hundred on hand. Of course, he wins. He takes some chips. He starts throwing them over. Yeah, doing the right thing. Doing the right thing. It was really cool. He's like the most down to earth greatest guy. I always had fun with Sammy on the radio. First time a rock star ever paid me, you know, all these years growing up, buying his records and stuff. I got a little kick back. I guess. All right. You know, I mean, we got to thank Jay Lang for coming by, Sammy Hagar. We didn't even get to half the stuff we wanted to do today. Who won, by the way? Oh, we won the Bra-Bingo. I did. You won Bra-Bingo? Yeah, we had a Bra-Bingo game today and Opie won. See, we needed to do the Bra-Bingo while we were drinking the tequila. It would have been much more fun. It would have been very hard to keep track of. That's true. That's true. But also we asked the listeners to, you know, send in their favorite Slim Pickens movie lines. I don't know how we got on this. Oh, Stanley Kubrick. I think a day's pay for napping on the job. You know what happened? Yeah, Stanley Kubrick dying and Joe DiMaggio got all the press. But we were saying how brilliant Slim Pickens was. Well, did you see the Screen Actors Guild Awards? No. Roberto, I always screw up his last name. Abelini Marino. Yeah, yeah. From Life is Beautiful. He won and he paid homage to De Maestro, as he called him. Ah. Because it had just happened that day. It wasn't even really in print or anything. Sure. So he got a little coverage. Ah, okay. I don't think he was getting all the recognition that he needed, but Dr. Strangelove, one of the movies he directed, Slim Pickens riding the nuclear warhead down. Yeah! Wasn't that great? He's riding the nuclear warhead down. But then we started talking about Slim Pickens and Blazing Saddles. Another great movie that would never, ever, ever be made today because of all the racial overtones in it. And Richard Pryor, a writer on Blazing Saddles. I didn't know that. I didn't know that until they roasted Richard Pryor recently. Yeah. I mean, what do you think, Mel Brooks was coming up with all the black jokes and that? You know what? There was a scene in there where the lights go down and he's in the room. The sheriff. Madeline Kahn. Madeline Kahn and... Clevon Little. Clevon Little, right. Yeah. And she goes, oh, you're so big. And the next line, which was cut from the movie, was, baby, you suckin' on my arm. That was cut from the movie? Cut from the movie? Cut from the movie? Oh, you suck on my arm. Look at that. Right on. So everyone sent in their Slim Pickens lines. Okay. That's how we got on this subject. Slim Pickens, Blazing Saddles lines. Well, you want to hear a couple of them here, Anthony? Yeah. Let's hear. All right. Here's another one. I know how we can run everybody out of Rock Ridge. How? We'll kill the firstborn male child in every household. Too Jewish.
