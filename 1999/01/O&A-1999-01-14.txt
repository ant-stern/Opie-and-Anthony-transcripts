 I'm going to be a W. A. W. The New York brand new band on the music scene that's trained with the song free some skinner before that. That skinner goes out to a guy that requested it yesterday. I pray he's still listening from yesterday. Yeah. All right. You never know. That's how lazy we are. I really hope the guys listening because he called about 10 times yesterday. I said, yeah, man, I'll get it on for you. No, really. I'll get it on. Well, you did. Finally. Good afternoon, everybody. I hope you're making it through with this snow ice, sleet, freezing rain. Oh, it's snowing out. Well, I don't think it's doing anything right now, is it? No. Oh, wow. I didn't know that. I was watching TV and listen to radio all day today. Yeah, they never broke in with any weather. Yeah, no one really mentioned it. I'm wow. Really? Oh, look at that. It seems to be a little flake or two. Huh. Oh, it's going to be a tough ride home today, I guess. I wish someone would have told me. I would have prepared. I would have ran to the store and got my canned goods just in case the lights go out today. Batteries. Put some sand in your trunk, Opie. Check the elderly. And be careful. Make sure you don't leave your pets outdoors. Yeah. Bring your pets in because they get cold too, even though they have fur. All right. Well, look at that. Little tips that we've heard all day long. Oh, great. I got to hand it to our marketing department here at NAW. Yes. This could be the first nice thing we've said about Roger and the rest of the gang in marketing. Yes. We went on the air yesterday and said that we want to have a Jets Pep rally. We'll party for the boys. We also said we need a Bronco. Yes. So we can beat the crap out of it with sledgehammers. We're going to like tag it with spray paint. Mm-hmm. And then beat the crap out of it. Anthony, I'm proud to say that we are going to be broadcasting live tomorrow from 3 to 7. Isn't this great? We're finally getting out. They're finally letting us out of the studio. Finally. I guess we did something right. Well, I wouldn't push it. So where are we going to be? Manny's Cocktail Lounge in Monocay, New Jersey. Yes. We're going to have a Bronco. They had to buy a Bronco for us. Can you believe this? That's amazing. I didn't realize we had a budget, but they bought a Bronco. We're going to spray paint it. We're going to hand out sledgehammers, and we are going to have a good old time. We're going to get ready for the big game on Sunday. It's going to look uglier than Elway's teeth. Yes. When we're done with it. So we're encouraging everyone to join us tomorrow if you're a Jets fan, if you're a Giants fan, if you just want to hang out and party, because the beer will be a-flowing. Right. All right. If you need to figure out how to get there, we have the directions right on the website, the WNEW website. All right. Cool. So I applaud the marketing department. Bravo. Earl, were you part of that? Sort of, yes. All right. Well, thanks, Black Girl. Job well done. All right. We got lots to do. We got the Jets chant ready to go. When you hear that, that's your cue to try to win the trip to Denver for the game. Yeah. We've been doing this for the last few days, and I must say, I was listening to the W today, and people are finally getting psyched and finally getting into it. You hear some of these people? Yeah. They sound like stock-raving lunatics. That's what we want to hear, though. Exactly. We want you to... You know, we want to feel what you're feeling. Blood come out. That's right. The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, Billy Squire. Lonely as the night. Days of the New Before That Touched Peel, and Stan. It's Opie and Anthony. Hello. And we played the Jets chant there, Anthony, so we've got to get another qualifier for the trip to Denver to see the game. All right. We've got Barbara here online, too. Let's see if Barbara can give us a good shout. Barbara? Yep. How are you? All right. You heard the Jets chant? Yep. And you're ready to do a chant back? We're ready to do a chant, okay. Now, if you don't do it well enough, we're going to hang up on you. We get very upset. That's the chance I have to take. We get very upset, and not only us, the real hardcore Jets fans go, oh, come on, I could have done that better. Yes. So we need something like an A effort out of you. Now, where are you now? I'm at home. Okay. So you have no excuses, no losses around, nothing. Right, right. All right. Here's Barbara, everyone. Okay. J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets. Okay. That must have been the wind up, that dead silence before she started. Now, Barbara, people are driving off the road right now. That has nothing to do with the ice. Wow. I can't be responsible for everything. They're ticked off. They need you to do it louder. Louder, huh? Yeah, like when your voice starts crackling. Are you married? Do you have kids? I'm married and I got one on the way. Oh, okay. All right. Our first new Jets fan is on the way. All right. We don't want you to go into premature labor here. All right. You think you could do it a little louder, though? Okay, we'll try. Okay. Come on, Barbara. Push, push, push, push, push, push. J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets. All right. All right. Very good. Almost broke her water with that one. That's the only reason we're going to let you slide. All right. Because you got the kid on the way. But congratulations. You got a Jets prize package, which is a Jets sweatshirt and a bunch of other things. And we're going to be picking the winner of the trip tomorrow during Steve's show. Okay. New morning guy. Okay. All right. Hold on the line. Rick's going to get some info from you. Okay, thanks. There she goes, Barbara. We're going to do that a few more times today, so keep listening, all right? Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Man is is a sports bar. Mmm-hmm. So you know what that means, gang. Yeah, it's going to be one big party. Don't let the weather get you down because we'll be partying inside and outside. It's just going to be a blast. Now a lot of people are calling for the directions to Manny's. Are they on our website? Now I'm hearing rumors that it might not be on our website. The directions. I'm going to have to pop the website up now and say, okay, my God. On the way we got some Lenny Kravitz and David Bowie. Good. Hey, it's Faye Dunaway's birthday today. We'll get into that next. Star of my favorite movie. All right, Anthony. All right, it's Priceline.com. It's Opie and Anthony. Is William Shatner in the studio once again today? I am the spokesman for Priceline. I love Priceline. It's fabulous. It's how I bought the Enterprise. Really? Yes. I called Priceline and said, I need a starship and I only want to pay this much for it. And they got it for me. Wait a minute. At the price I wanted to pay. Yeah, but Priceline's not into Starcraft yet. No, this is in the future. Oh, I see. I use my time warp to come back. In the future Priceline will actually have starships too. It's going to be fabulous. Well right now they're into airline tickets and hotel rooms. They're pushing the hotel rooms right now. Mr. Shatner. Yes. I'm so used to dealing with people like the gamesters of Triskelion always trying to rip me off. But not the fine people at Priceline. Smart bones. Good Priceline. For a open up a hailing frequency. Good Priceline. Well if you're going away in the near future, you need a hotel room, give Priceline a call at 1-800-Priceline or visit them on the web, Priceline.com and you set your price for your hotel room and they're going to take care of you. If you use their service they're going to give you a free hotel night. You can't beat that with a block lube. And if you need a flight, they're in that business as well. You primitive people in your aircraft. Yes, I remember from my history computer. I understand you still have to travel by aircraft. But if you must, why not call Priceline? Well they saved me $350 on two tickets to Florida right after the holidays. You and your dollars. I deal in ignats. Ignats? That's my form of currency. Okay, I see. They saved me many ignats in the future. I see that. Priceline. The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW Lenny Kravitz and Fly Away. Hey Anthony, if you're thinking of flying this afternoon you better check with your carrier. There are a lot of cancellations and delays. If you're looking to get away like Lenny was just saying. Wacky DJ Segway. How many of those have you been hearing today? Every song they come out of has to have something to do with the weather. I have an announcement to make. Every single flight has been cancelled for the next two days. Thank you. Really? Is that an official announcement? Oh wow. Well what if someone is driving to the airport right now? I would suggest you turn around. We don't do too well when we broadcast the news so I think maybe you ought to shut up. Every single flight has been cancelled today. Go home and drink. Okay. That sounds good. I like the sound of that. I hope you don't get your news from Opie and Anthony. Listen for the sarcasm everyone. We're up to four already today. Did you hear it? Yeah I think I just heard something go by. Sarcasm. Hey happy birthday to Faye Dunaway. How old is she? 57? I think it was 57. 57 years young today huh? Yeah. No wire hookers ever! God I love that movie. That movie gives me the creeps. I saw it just over the weekend. It was on TV. And I giggle like an idiot watching that movie. When she's just pounding on the kid Christina when she's a little kid it's hysterical. Scrub Christina scrub! They're in the bathroom with the like comet on the floor. Scrub! Scrub! And she starts hitting the kid with the comet. And the kid's like. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! And then the best part when she leaves Joan Crawford leaves the bathroom and she goes what am I supposed to do? And she looks back at the kid and goes clean up this mess! And the kid just goes Jesus Christ. Now Anthony it's the best movie. We've been doing this show for about seven months. Yeah. And if you surveyed our listeners they would swear that I'm the crazy one. Why is it that you find enjoyment out of dramas on TV? You laugh at Bill Jenkins the Mickey Rooney movie. That's supposed to be a serious drama. You sit there and laugh like a little girl. I laugh at the ones that are funny because they're so utterly bad. Like you think Faye Dunaway's performance in that was good or maybe just a tad over the top in our kabuki makeup. Standing there with the wire hanger and the white powder on her face and the big red lipstick going I got you nice dresses and you put wire hanger! That stuff is great. We've got to get that clip for our show. No wire hangers ever! Ever! Christina get the axe! I like when she cuts her hair. What are you doing? Another great scene when Christina gets a little older. There's a writer over who is going to write this whole story on Joan. The daughter is back from school and Joan goes to her. Why can't you give me the respect I get from any stranger on the street? Christina goes, because I'm not one of your fans! They proceed to beat the crap out of each other. You see underwear and skirts are flying in. They're choking each other. The movies are classic. You just sit there and laugh. Like a retard. You were playing Half Life last night. I was getting heavy into Half Life. The game is extremely bloody and extremely gory. There were blood, guts, organs from other people that were killed and splattered on the wall. You were playing multiplayer. Big pock marks in the walls from bazookas. I typed in, Christina clean up this mess! Everyone in the room knew what movie it was from. You get the little LOL. In honor of Faye Dunaway, 57 years young today, one more. One more little... No more wire hangers! Ever! Happy birthday to you, Faye. Godspeed, Faye. Up to five. Five sarcastic. Alright. We got some Bad Company on the way. Some Aerosmith and some Johnny Cougar next. Little Johnny Cougar. Let's just start calling him Johnny Cougar, because everyone has seen the commercial now. 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York Bad Company. Alright, Topee and Anthony. Anthony is struggling to get his headphones. The boss had his foot on my cord. I think he was giving you a sign. Are you going home early, boss? I'm going home early. I'm trying to beat that New Jersey traffic. Good luck. He's got his balls in his hands and he's ready to go. What do you got? Do you want to elaborate on that? Titleist? I see you. He stated the obvious. You got your balls in your hands. Alright. It's Greg Dolgolping weather. I'm getting into my weekend mode. I may escape a little bit. God, that's got to be nice. Just to be able to get out of this. I may just be escaping to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina this week. Oh, wow. Look at you. Because you're leaving Saturday morning. It's got to be nice. It's one of these days. It's tough. You've got to find a way to unwind. It can be stressful. Alright. I was just bombed. But I wasn't deliberately stepping on your court. Oh, I wouldn't think, I wouldn't dream that you would do that on purpose, Godfather. I can never tell whether music is playing or not. What music? You never give me headphones. What music? There's no music playing. What are you talking about? It says, I often just hear music when I'm walking down the street. Oh. No, we don't have music in the background. Just talking to our boss, that's all. Dave Herman sleeps with the fishes. So I was actually asked this morning by Steve Mason if the changes are done. At the station? At the station. Oh, we hope so. And they ran through the entire lineup. Right. The changes are done. They're done. So now we've got a radio station to promote finally. We actually have an entire radio station to promote. That's incredible. I have no future wackings in order for me to be whacked anytime soon. Do not cross me. Your baseball bat got a workout the last seven months. Why isn't he laughing? I know. I'm laughing. He's laughing on the inside. Oh, okay. Yeah. Wow, you hear that crescendo that just came up in the music. It's beautiful. What did it say? How'd it go? What music? There's no music playing. It doesn't have headphones on. Music may. No. So. All right, boss. Thank you. Well, enjoy the ride. Thank you. Are you going to be at our little pep rally tomorrow? Anthony doesn't like to call it a pep rally. I just want to call it a big ass party. We're just going to have a huge party. I know. I think I paid for that Bronco today. Did you? How much do we have to pay for that? I think we're talking about like $750 to $800. All right. Just so we can beat the hell out of it with that. I'm not even sure it has an engine. I think we may have to tow it in. Good for parts. That's all right. That's going to be fun. Just like John Elway. Yeah. Yeah. You know? No engine. No engine has to be towed in. That's it. That's what we're hoping for. We've got to get to Elway early Sunday. Go Jets. Did you hear our Mike and the Mad Dog impression yesterday? No. I'll have to do that a little later. We'll do it for your ride home. I'll be in the car for the next three hours. Okay. So just take your time. A lot of people liked it. I was surprised. So. But tomorrow's the big jet pep rally at Manny's in Monockey, New Jersey. You know where that is? I do. Not too far from the metal lines. Exactly. And it's a sports bar. And we're going to be inside. We're going to be outside with the Bronco. We've got sledgehammers and we're going to beat the hell out of this Bronco. Get it like my name. We're going to raise some money for the Marty Lyons Foundation. Yeah. Oh, that's right. I just found out about that. The former jet? Yes. Very cool. I think we're charging $2 a whack and then we're going to turn the money over to charity. That's fair enough. That's good. Sure. And we're doing our whole show live. So please come on out and support us. We haven't been out yet. We haven't been out since Johnny Cougar. That was like four months ago. Johnny Cougar. That was about four months ago. It's like our debutante ball. Yeah. We want to see if people are actually listening. Do you actually know what you're going to be wearing? Are you going to lay out your clothes tonight? Yeah, I'm going to lay my clothes out. Make sure I have a nice outfit. It's like the first day of school. Yeah. Get my school bag. We're kind of excited. Yeah. It's going to be fun. We want to meet the people that are supporting us. Yes. The two or three people. All right, boss. We're going to be having a lot of fun. We're going to be having a lot of fun. The two or three people. All right, boss. Do you want to call from the road and be our traffic reporter today? Sure. All right. Yeah, you could be a... I don't want to get it wrong. No, that's CBS, the cellmates. What does WINS have? The phone force. The phone force. The phone force. Our 1010 WINS phone force calling in. It's Bill on the Jersey turnpike. Says there's traffic. Thank you, Bill. I love that. They got some wacky little street reporting going on. And here we came across Lisa in Times Square who likes this weather. New York had its fun. New York loves this weather. I don't know. You guys should talk to the people that really hate this weather. That would be fun to listen to. I wanted to talk to the guy I saw on the side of a building pumping insulation into a little hole from his truck. He didn't look like he'd have a happy word about this kind of weather. Well, my wife is in charge of the class moms. Yeah. So like we get the call at five o'clock in the morning that school's closed. Oh, wow. Yeah. And the New Jersey phone chain goes into effect. I don't train. I don't train because by noon people have already been frightened into taking the train. So now the roads are pretty clear and the train sucks. You know, and then we're driving in, we're listening to 10 10 wins. And what are they saying? Roads are clear. Twenty minute delays in miniola for equipment problem. All right. So you won this battle. Of course I did. I take the train every once in a while. There's a lot of freaky people on the train. You take the train. I can see the freaky people from my windshield. There's a lot of them today. If you're in the left lane and you're going 15 miles an hour, get that out of the way. You know, I'm not going to buy the argument of people calling up going, hey, these maniacs of this for utility four wheel drives. You know, you guys better come. No, no, no. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. This is the first year I have ever, ever owned a four wheel drive and I'm behind people going 15 and I know I could do at least 30, you know, but they're in the way and it's not like they're in the granny lane. No, they're in the left lane. They're in the passing lane. Just move to the right. How many times do we see this left lane clear? Right. You're buzzing right along out of the middle lane. Come somebody into the left lane. All right. And then they don't go any faster than they were going in the middle lane. They're not passing the vehicle that was in front of them. Nothing. They're just in my way. And you are freaking out today. We got to do the road rage thing again. We haven't done one of those in a while because you were in rare form today. You're just flashing your high beams at this lady and she's just like, what am I doing? All right. I was I was angry. You were losing it. And this lady couldn't understand why you're so ticked off behind her with your four wheel drive car as she's in her pinto. I think it was going 15 miles an hour in the casting lane. I got the cow catcher thing on the front. I got lights. I'm shining. I'm like, get out of my way. So then we finally passed her and she looks at us like, what is your problem? We got to give you that quick like you maniac look and I give them the quick you asshole look and we're on our way. And then everyone moves on. Move along. All right. We're going to talk about the Val Kilmer movie. We can do that next, I guess. But everyone is calling for the directions for our live broadcast tomorrow. I'm getting very excited about this. We're going to beat the hell out of a Bronco. We got the Bronco. We got the sledgehammers. We got the location. It's Manny's Cocktail Lounge, the sports bar over there near the stadium. And that's in Manakee, New Jersey. We're going to be there from three to seven, beating the heck out of this Bronco and drinking lots and lots of beers and just having a good old time as we get psyched for the game on Sunday. All right. As I pull up the N.E.W. website, Opie, on the front page right there, when you first get to it, it says, details and directions, Opie and Anthony's Bronco blowout. There you go. There you go. So go to the website, www.wnew.com. One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York, the Jets chant. We got to get a winner here.

To see the game Sunday in Denver. Mm hmm. I.W. Hi, J.E.T.S. Get, get, get. We got a live one here. Hello, did I win? Well, you're supposed to wait until we do some of that small talk, right? Yeah, we want to get to know you a little bit. And then we set you up and let you go. You kind of shot your load there. I'm not the 10th call. You're the 10th caller. Oh, boy. Oh, my God. I'm in the running. OK, what's your name? Joyce Clark. All right, Joyce, where are you calling from? I'm calling from Midtown. I'm working? Yes. Where do you work? I work at 685 30 Avenue.

Go ahead. Oh, we didn't want to be on hold. I wanted to see what station they listened to on hold. OK, let's see. What is that? That's got to hurt. It's like that New Age stuff. Is this from like Madame Butterfly? Like from Madame Butterfly. I guess you didn't realize. I am back. Oh, there you are. That's some great music you got on hold. I know, it's sick. What station is that? I don't know. I don't know. Is it? OK. All right, we're going to give you another chance here. You really got to scream because there are people out there that really want this chance to go to Denver. Now, you got to just let it go. Let it go. OK, you ready? Yeah. OK, here we go. J-E-T-S, Jet, Jet, Jet. All right, there you go. We can handle that one. All right, hold on the line. Rook's going to qualify you. OK. You get a Jet Prize package.

No. I've heard that before out of girls. You're letting us down. In the past. Yeah, I'll be there. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure you will. I know I'll try. And I'm left standing there waiting, looking like the dorky kid that fell off the bridge and shouted in my fever. All pathetic. She's going to show up, right, Tony? She's going to show up, right, Tony, right? Look, Tony, I'm dancing, Tony. Look, Tony. I want to see you. I want to hear the B-52. Yeah, I'll play it. Yeah, I'm still waiting. Whoops. OK.

We're broadcasting our show live from Manny's Cocktail Lounge in Wenaki. OK. And we got a Bronco. We got sledgehammers and everyone's going to come down, drink a few beers and beat the heck out of this Bronco. OK. Does it sound like a good idea? Yes. Oh, it's going to be fun. I'm ready. All right. We'll hopefully see you there. OK. OK. Hold on the line. OK. Yeah, that's from 3 to 7 tomorrow. Yeah. She did a pretty good job. She did. They're getting better. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, Led Zeppelin. Metallica, before that, turn the page from Garage Inc. and Golden Earring 2, Twilight Zone, as you try to make your way home this afternoon. It's open, Anthony. Thanks for checking us out today. We definitely appreciate that. Yes, we do. We do have our supporters, and we're going to see all you guys tomorrow at Manny's Cocktail Lounge in Monocay, New Jersey. Monocay. We've got the Bronco. If you don't know what's going on by now, we're all very psyched for the game, obviously. So we're going to do our show live tomorrow from Manny's, right near the stadium, from 3 to 7. We've got a Bronco. We've got Sledgehammers, and you get the chance to beat up the Bronco. It's fun for a Friday afternoon. Yeah. It's great. We're also going to raise money for Marty Lyon's foundation there for the terminally ill children. And go figure. All that fun and the good cause to boot. Yes. You might be saying, yeah, but, opening Anthony, it's going to stink tomorrow. The weather's supposed to be bad. That's why we picked a sports bar. We're going to have fun inside, outside, all around. So please make your plans to join us tomorrow from 3 to 7. Well, this morning, they have on the actual couple that inspired the movie At First Sight with Mira Savino and Val Kilmer. So they must look really hot. No, no, there's no Val Kilmer. No, no. What about Mira Savino? The real... No, no, no. Not even close. They're stretching the truth with this movie? Unbelievable. Just... Hanus. Big fat. Now, what's the problem? At First Sight is where Val Kilmer, he regains his sight. He regains his sight. Yes, and sees how lovely the world is and how lovely Mira Savino is and told wonderful. So it sounds like a great love story. What's the problem? Well, Opie, they don't look like Val Kilmer and Mira Savino. Well, what do they look like, the real couple? They've got big fat goofy people. I don't think he was all right in the head either. It's kind of a ball ball. Basically, this guy's wishing that he didn't regain his sight. Is that what you're getting at? Yeah. Is that what you're getting at, Anthony? Yeah, that's pretty much it. I think the wife wanted to gouge her eyes out. He was wearing that big wrap-around sunglass thing like you see the old people wear in the Terminator. He was kind of looking around like he still couldn't see. I don't know what it is. They show Val Kilmer walking around. He's fine. Perfectly fine. Yeah, he's looking at everything. I don't know. Well, we've got a page, a picture of the lovely couple in the post today on page... what is that, 44? Page 44, if you want to check it out for yourself. Could have reunited Ernest Borgnein and Shelly Winters from the Poseidon Adventure if they could really make them look authentic. That's pretty much what I saw. That's pretty close. Isn't it? Yes. Not that I got the picture in front of me. It is Ernest Borgnein with the big wrap-around sunglasses and Shelly Winters from the Poseidon Adventure. Wow. I was a swimmer. I was a championship swimmer. I love that movie. That's a good one. That's the real Titanic. Yeah. Yeah, the 70s Erwin Allen Titanic. None of that stupid storyline thing to get in the way of the action. When she tries to swim underwater, that's pretty funny. Yeah, big fat Shelly Winters. Like a whale. It looked like a scene out of SeaWorld, like Shamu. Big fat Shelly Winters swimming underwater. That's one of those movies when it's on TV. You can't pass it by. You've got to watch for a while. Yeah, it doesn't matter when you tune in. No, red buttons and 15 minutes left. You've got to watch. Yes. There's got to be a morning after. Shut up. Nonny. Is that a name? Yes. All right. We've got the Jets Chan ready to go here. That'll be your cue to call in. 212-757-1027 to win the chance to see the game live in Denver. When are we giving away that trip? Tomorrow morning at 8.30 with Seamason? Yes. The new guy? Yeah, the new guy. We finally have a lineup here at N.E.W.? We finally have a new guy. It's not us. There's a bunch of people that are... Yeah, that's true. Ralph's a new guy still. Steve Mason's a new guy. We're veterans now. The new morning show. At seven months, we're veterans. We certainly are. This place, to be a veteran, you had to put in 30 years. The times have changed. The veterans. Yeah, we are. We're veterans. Shell shocked. Been on the front lines a little too long. When do we get to start drinking on the air? No, really. That went on for years around here. Alright, so stick around for the Jets chant. Make sure you call in to try to win that. We got some great rock and roll on the way. We got that new band, Indigenous. 1027W&W, the rock of New York. That's the band, Indigenous. Now that you're gone, why are you doing that? I don't get it. What were you saying about them? From the family of musicians. From? Three brothers and a sister from the Dakota Nation. From South Dakota. They grew up on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The Yank what? Yankton. Oh. Yankton. I don't know. Indigenous. I get the name now. Yes. They are indigenous to this land, being Native Americans. Correctamundo. They are indigenous. I used to like, what was that engine band? Blackfoot. Blackfoot. Yes. I like it. Okay, cool. Indigenous. Sounds a little bit like Stevie Ray Vaughan. Yeah. They got their roots in the blues. Sounds a little bit like Buddy Guy, too. We played the Jets chant in there. We need to get a qualifier for that trip to Denver for the game. And let's grab a phone line here. Hi, how are you doing? Hey, how are you doing? All right, who is this? This is Bob Buck. How is it going? All right, Bob, where are you calling us from? I'm calling from the 84th Precinct Detective Squad in Denver. All right. What's going on? Hey, you watching my PD Blue? Oh, yeah, I do. What do you think of it? I think it's pretty good. Yeah? Is it accurate? Yeah, I think so. I think it's a question for me, actually. I love that damn show. Me too. Me too. I'm glad I got 3D guy. I really like what you're doing, man. That's a good show. We like what you're doing. Okay, cool. So you guys walk around with your butts exposed? Only in the summertime. We'll have to tell that today. With your butts exposed? Isn't that an embarrassment to the precinct to see everyone's butt on NYPD Blue? Yeah, really. Did you see it on Tuesday? I was on NyQuil. I think I fell asleep at 10.01. You gave me a complete asshole out of a metaphor on Tuesday. Did they? Yeah, Sipowicz said it was funny. Yeah, Sipowicz is funny, man. I like when you're shaking down them scales. That's right. That's right. It doesn't beat them hard enough, I think. I'm going to beat them hard enough. I'm going to beat your ass. You don't tell me what I want to know. I like that guy. Definitely. All right, I guess we need you to do the Jets chant. Absolutely. All right, are you psyched? I am psyched. I'll be honest. We've had some wimpy qualifiers today. I was driving in and I heard that one girl driving into work and I said, you've got to be driving. I was the guy that had to drive back on the road when you told everybody to drive off the road. But we let her slide because she was pregnant. Yeah, she was pregnant. That's right. We didn't want her to pop a kid or nothing. No, no, no. Pop a little nugget out. All right, what are you guys doing on the job tonight? Anything fun? Any drug busts or anything? No, we don't do drugs. We go out for the other kind of criminals. We let narcotics do the drugs. Which I did myself for four years, but I don't do that anymore. Have you had any exciting stops lately? We'll see. We picked up some 15-year-old kid that was robbing everybody with a gun around here. I've had him come up recently. Boy, you never heard of him. I did too. My buddies caught him in the act with a gun screwed into some guy's ear on the sidewalk. Oh, really? Yeah, they didn't shoot him though. I was really pissed off about that. Did he shove the plunger up his butt when he went back to the prison? Fine, I'm just asking the questions everyone wants to know. Oh, come on. All those things out after that happened. When that even the toilets back up were screwed. We can't even have one in the building anymore. You've got to roll up a newspaper and shove it down in there. Exactly. Get rid of all the plungers. All of them, man. They're out. They're out. The nightstick works better anyway. That's true. I'm ripped in. Oh, my God. Geez. You're even harsh for us. You're even harsh for us. I love you guys. We do. I've been doing this for a while, so you know, you get a little hard over time. How long have you been on the job? 15 years. 15 started out on the streets? Oh, yeah. I've been up in Harlem. Really? East New York. All the dumps. All the good garden spots. The garden spots in New York. I'll tell you, the better the ghetto, the more fun I had. Just tell it like it is. Keeping it real. This neighborhood now is a little too soft for me. You need some action. I'm going to get back into the action. All right. I guess it's time for your Jets jam. Okay. Whenever you're ready. Okay. Hold on. Let me just adjust the phone properly. Hold on. J-E-G-S. Judge, judge, judge. Kick them in the ass. Yeah! I like that. I just got really excited. Awesome. All right. Hold on the line, okay? Okay. All right, man. There you go. Very cool. One of our boys out there. One of our men in blue. That's it. All right. You had a good instant feedback about the Jets. Yeah. I have a couple. Let's see. First, I got to get this guy Jim. I don't approve or let him go. I don't approve. I don't approve. I don't approve. I don't approve. I don't approve. I don't approve. I don't approve or laugh at everything you guys do, but that lamb chop skit was one of the funniest things I've ever heard. That had to be one of the most tasteless, cruel things we've ever done. The lamb chop, yes. I'd love to know what he doesn't approve of. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Oh, yeah. This is the, this guy James had this whole thing how now the Jets are destined to win. And he proves his point. Oh, let's hear this. The Jets won Super Bowl III. That was 30 years ago. This is Super Bowl 33. Huh? Huh? That sounds good. Come on. The three thing. That Super Bowl was in Miami. Oh, yes. So is this one. Okay. Weave was the coach that season. He died this season and the players wear his name on their helmets. That's a little bit of a stretch. We'll go with it. We'll go with it. Vinny is number 16. You know how many points they scored in game three? 16, baby. 16. Need I go on, he says. Okay. The Jets are destined to win. I thought I had a few more. Well, maybe you got to come up with more. It's a little, it's not exactly rocket science. The grassy knoll. Yeah, but like Kennedy's secretary. Her name was Lincoln and Lincoln's secretary was Kennedy. Was Kennedy. Yeah. When I read that for the first time, that whole conspiracy thing, it freaked me out. Lincoln was banging Monroe, Maryland, a guy that was an actor back in... All right. Hey, don't forget about our Jets party tomorrow at Manny's, the sports bar near the stadium there in Monocay, New Jersey. We got the directions for this place on the web. Right. WNW.com. We want everyone to be out there. We'll be broadcasting live from three to seven. We got ourselves a Bronco. Rumor has it the thing's not running anymore. Yeah. We're going to be like the team. So they're getting a toad out to this place. Then we're going to hand all our faithful listeners sledgehammers and for two dollars a whack you get to beat the heck out of this Bronco. But the money raised is going for a great cause. Proceeds go to the Marty Lyons fund for terminally ill children. So we'll raise some money and do something nice for once. Good cause and a good time. You know, this isn't one of those stiff, stupid radio guy things. You know, we like having fun. especially sports bar. Damn it. We're going to have some fun. It's going to be ugly. We'd like you to be there. We're going to be partying indoors, outdoors. So please try to make it by. Right. Because a lot of you guys have been asking when you guys going to leave the studio and hang with us. Well, we're coming out. We're coming out tomorrow. We're going to have a great, great time. Also, I had to wait for my pistol permit to clear. Now I can leave the building. Also, I think like the first 200 people that pay to beat up the Bronco. Yeah. I beat up the Bronco, open Anthony T-shirt or something like that. Well, there you go. So worth the price of admission right there. It's better than our pedophile T-shirt. I know I made it out there. One of two seven W and W the rock in New York, Van Halen, Jamie's crying and Eve six before that with inside out. It's open Anthony. Thanks for checking us out today. Appreciate it. You know, one of our most popular guests thus far here at any W has been Steven Lynch. Oh yeah. He gets so much email on this guy. It's incredible. And then with his guitar and sang some very touching songs. I believe he's going to make his second visit in the very near future. He was supposed to come tomorrow, but I think we're going to have to reschedule because we're doing that live broadcast from Manny's in Manaki tomorrow. Yes. The Jets rally thing we're doing. Yeah. More details on that if you don't know what's going on. But so I think we'll get him in next week. Good. He's got a couple new songs that he wants to try out on us. I would take it that you have one queued up now. Yes. 24. Oh, I see what you're getting at. Yeah, like third. Well, 30. Yeah, 36. He was 36 years old. Hey, dude, alive is enough. Screw the number thing. If she's even alive. Wow. That is pretty bizarre. Yeah. Hey, I got a new telemarketer call. You do. Yes. Well, you hate telemarketers. I think a lot of people hate telemarketers because they call at the stupidest times. Things you don't need and you can't get rid of them and you beg them to take you off their list and no one listens and they continue calling and harassing you. So I've turned the tides a little bit and I mess with them back. Yeah. This lady. Pretty good at this. This lady. This lady, Miss Williams, called me today. Miss Williams. Miss Williams. Now, you know, when you get a telemarketer call on the line and they have to read from a script, they all do that. It is so obvious. It's a script like, Hi, my name is Miss Williams and I'm calling from AT&T. Right. You can just tell it's a script. So my latest scam is to see how many times I could get them to start over or repeat their script. This is what I do for fun before we do a radio show. Anthony, how successful were you?

Wait, no, no, the second one. They are equally as evil. Equally? I don't know. I think so. More email coming in about the one-dunce Jets by Paul McCartney and Wings. That one is really bad. You want to hear it again? We don't even know who did this. Hey, wait a minute. I smashed this. Well, the other day. They sent us another copy. Come on. This is a joke. No, I'm serious. They sent another copy. And a bunch of people said that they heard that there's a song worse than the YMCA one that we were playing. They goofed it on. Everyone knows the YMCA one. Go ahead. Give them a taste of this. We'll show you how evil this one is. All right. It's bad. All right. It starts off all right. All right. It starts off all right. Oh, yeah.
