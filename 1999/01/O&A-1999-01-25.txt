 I'm so high. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Pink Floyd. Days anew before that, Touch, Appeal and Stan and ACDC2. It's Opie and Anthony. What's up? How you doing? Well, I've got to ask one question right off the bat. Did we bomb anyone? Did anything important happen this weekend? I don't think so. No, not really. Why? Anyone famous? TV or anything? Anyone famous die? We didn't nuke anyone? Nothing, right? False alarm on Joe DiMaggio. Which we'll get into later. No. Okay. I didn't watch TV at all this weekend. And I felt very strange coming into NEW today, not being informed with what's going on around me. Well, then I guess you were doing something very important that you don't know what happened over the weekend. I was playing PlayStation. I'm addicted. Tomb Raider 3, right? Tomb Raider 3 is what's getting me these days. All right. But you know, I woke up yesterday. You're a rip, man. Well, I woke up yesterday and it looked like seven outside. We discussed it on Friday. It was one of those seven weekends, just dreary and rainy. It was a perfect day to just stay on the couch for eight straight hours and play Tomb Raider 3. Eight hours. Eight hours. Oh, I'm proud. Look at that. I played a total of 14 hours this weekend. Tomb Raider 3. You finally found a game that you can stay on there for hours with. Yeah, but the problem is, the problem is I need to rent a 12 year old kid to come out and come over. Michael Jackson. No, I need to rent a 12 year old kid to come over and do the maneuvers for me on the waterfall ice cliffs, waterfall cliffs. What's the matter, Grandpa? You can't swing the move? I understand what I have to do. And I tried to do it for four straight hours. Four straight hours. Saturday night. To do, wait, to just do one little thing? Yeah. Oh my gosh. And I know exactly what I have to do. I need some 12 year old kid out there to come to my house after the show. This is how desperate I am. I'll go pick you up. I'll bring you home. You get me through that section so I can move on with the game. It's pathetic. You are pathetic. Well, the part I'm stuck at, you climb up the cliff. You have to do a double back flip onto another cliff. Then you have to jump completely across the cavern to a ledge. You got to hit the jump perfectly. What is it with Lara that she has to do back flips to jump? She looks cool doing it. But I mean, why not just jump? Well, no, because you're facing backwards. You can't turn around when you're on a ladder, dude. I'm almost positive you can't, anyway. So then you make that jump. Then you climb. You have to make another jump where you have to turn in midair to the left and land on like a dime. Then the final jump is across the cavern again where a cobra snake is waiting for you. So I finally make it up there. I'm like, cool. I take out my guns to kill the cobra. Damn thing bites me once and kicks me down to the bottom of the cavern. Got to start all over. So that's where you spent four straight hours. Hi, NAW. Hi, guys. The reason why he can't do it is because he's too busy checking out the chick's butt. That's a hot little video game. It really is. She is smoking. That's why you're not making the moves, man. Take your eye off the body for a few minutes. You'll figure it out. Well, every once in a while, they'll show you a shot of Lara Croft's just breasts. Like your whole TV is her animated breasts. I'm like, wait a minute. That's great. I'll turn on the Playboy channel if I want to see that. I'm trying to play a game here. I know, man. You just get totally into it. Next thing you know, it's like, oh, freak, I'm dead. So we start again. I'm like, what? I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die.

I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. All right. We got lots to do today. A lot of people on hold. Well, we'll talk to them next. All right. Make a way, right? All right. Rick is screening the calls right now. 212-757-1027. Remember that number because later this hour when you hear Stone Free by Hendrix, be the tenth caller. 1027-WNEW, the rock of New York, Metallica. Turn the page. And Hendrix before that, that's the song you had to be listening for to qualify for that Super Bowl party in your house. And John Lemezuz. Wow. Wow. He is Polish. You're right. John Lemezuzki of Whitestone, New York. Congratulations, John. You're our latest qualifier. That is quite an honor. Congratulations. All right. Next hour. Next hour, I think to qualify someone, we're going to play Godfather Trivia. All right. We could do it a little different than everyone else's, right? Is there any set rules that we have to make the listeners, uh, feel comfortable? No. I think we should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. Do you think we should, uh, wait for a song? That's our show, right? I think we should do Godfather Trivia because Anthony claims to, to know that, uh, the one and two, Godfather one and two. You don't get me into three. I want to get started. Damn cult. Bullshit left alone for God's sake. You think you'll do well with trivia from one and two? Yeah, from one and two. I mean, the end of two, it's left off very nicely. Michael sitting on the bench realizing, you know, he did everything for the family. In turn, there wasn't much family left. You know, and he's just reflecting. Leave it like that. Get into the whole thing later on with the three, with his diabetes or whatever and this and that. Killing the Pope. I don't want to hear it. Okay. You think you'll do well with Tribute from 1 and 2? First person that stumps Anthony will qualify. Yeah, I think so. And will qualify for what, you ask? Well, you'll win the $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house. Okay? All right. We'll do that next hour. So get your Godfather trivia together. Now, Anthony, I saw the blockbuster videos in your car. You rented Lethal Weapon 4? It was mindless Sunday video day. How bad was it? Because I never saw it. Yeah, that franchise has been done for a couple of episodes already. Was Chris Rock funny at least? No, I've seen Chris Rock very funny. This wasn't the funny Chris Rock. No. How bad was it? Very formulaic, very stupid. Yeah. The chinks were the bad guys in this one. Oh, something a little different. Something a little different. At one point though, they're arresting some guy that ran out of a restaurant and they think he's a bad guy and he turns out to be a cook and they ask him to prove it and he goes, well, what's the special today? And the guy goes, well, our time prime, Paul. I started laughing. Hey, wait a minute. Look at that. Hey, it's Yochi, everyone. Yochi's in the movie. Okay. And then you had, what else was in the car? Oh, Mafia. Mafia. Abrams' movie about the- Who was it, Lloyd Bridges? Yeah, his last movie. Boy, I'm sure he was happy about that. To leave us with that mess? Yeah, you know, mindless, silly. It was funny when it was Airplane and Police Squad, but you know, that whole thing's done too. They didn't pull it off? Yeah. Sometimes you got to rent the bad movies. At least I rented them. I didn't go out to see them. What movie did Opie see this weekend? Well, where'd you go? Come on. All right, listen, though. After playing Tomb Raider 3 for 14 hours this weekend- 14 hours? I had to give a little back. Right, because the girls get a little angry when you spend so much time. I had to give a little back and it wasn't like we were going to go see some cool war movie. All right, you aren't going to see Thin Rent and Thin Red Line or anything? No, you've got to move. What? What? You've got mail. You've got mail. You've got mail. Is that what you said? Yeah. You went and saw You've Got Mail. I paid to see You've Got Mail. You're a pussy, man. Oh, you really had to pay back for playing PlayStation. Yeah, this movie, I mean, it's been said many times, but it's just a cheap version of Sleepless in Seattle, as we all know. How many guys are in there with you? None. None? You were like the only guy. Yeah, Sandy, my sister, my cousin Michelle. The same audience. Oh, you mean in the whole theater? Yeah. There's a couple of other sass. Poor sass. Yeah, but there's a few interesting things about You've Got Mail. First being it's a huge commercial for AOL. Huge. AOL is all over this movie and Meg Ryan is signing on to her account on AOL. Right. What do you think it takes in the movie? Oh, five seconds. Ah, come on. So she signs on and it goes You've Got Mail. The whole place starts laughing. It wasn't supposed to be a joke there, but everyone's laughing because it's like, yeah, right, it does take me five seconds to sign on to AOL. Of course not. Everyone knows the drill. I'm sorry, our circuits are busy. Please try again. Yeah, right after work, she's signing on to get her mail. Yeah, that's not a busy time at all. You don't get a busy signal whatsoever when you sign on at that point. All circuits are busy. Please try again. Yeah, and then at one point in the movie, she signs on and it doesn't say You've Got Mail. It says No Mail. And then everyone starts laughing again because when was the last time you saw that? You had No Mail on AOL? Right. Yeah, I know. With all the spams and the mail for the smut sites and stuff, you get mail every day now. Yeah, all I know is everyone wants me to invest in the market. I love smut. Yes. My email on my AOL account, that's all it is. Hot horse at your beck and call. Wow. Invest in Amazon.com. Wow, look at that. Right next to each other. Well, the thing I hate, now you bring up all your mail, they trick you into opening up the mail. What's that about? Oh, you don't fall for that. I fall every once in a while. It says, Hey, I'm writing you back, man. Something like that. Yeah, I'm writing you back and you're like, writing me back? What is this? I'm writing you back and you're like, writing me back. Oh, I'm writing you back. Yeah, I'm writing you back. Oh, I'm writing you back. I'm writing you back. And the other thing real fast about You've Got Mail, they conveniently made New York look like a place that had no foreigners. Just a nice, clean, very white city. Really? You've Got Mail. And it supposedly takes place on the West Side in the 70s. Oh, there's really not much traffic up there, is there, Anthony? I don't know. And no foreigners whatsoever. Just all white people. So it's the movies. Well, obviously. I mean, this is a great place to live and work, but come on. So what do you look a little different in the movies? So what a pussy movie do you like best? This one or Bridges of Madison County or Fried Green Tomatoes? Which one that you got? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I want to get into this. The Bridges of Madison County. I never went to see Fried Green Tomatoes in the theater. Oh, wow. And I never saw it at home. Maybe like five minutes at a time. Steel Magnolias. Oh my God. You saw Bridges of Madison County? Yeah, I did. In the movies? Shut up, man. I sat there and was pissed off like every other guy in the theater. Oh, and Clint takes his shirt off. That was my favorite part, Anthony, you ass. What an ass. It was early on in my relationship. You have to do things like that to get a little of the... Oh, Meryl Streep's looking out the window at Clint Eastwood who looks like he's eight billion years old with his shirt off. His skin is hanging like doilies. And there she is looking out the window. It's starting to caress her bloated body. Like, God, maybe 20 years ago, kids. What are you doing here? Oh, you're so right. You are so right. Hi, NWF. Boys on the side. NWF, shut up. Hey, guys, how are you doing? Hey, man, what's up? First of all, Anthony, welcome back from your sickness. Thank you. I'm feeling much better. That's a great idea. Second of all, how could you not think that Leap of Weapon 4 was a good movie? God, it was just done already. The night you were seen? The night you were seen made the movie. That stuff is so contrived too when they do it. I don't know. It's a whole palsy-walsy thing. They're in the dentist's office and they're all breathing nitrous and they're laughing and making jokes. It wasn't that good. It wasn't that good. The sensational explosions, they're not that sensational anymore. We've all seen them. Right. You know? And then, second of all, I can kind of feel what Opus is doing because a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago, when that Greg Kinnear movie came out with Warren Harley, I was dragged to the movie. The last couple of movies, the movie that we saw before that was I Know What You Did Last Summer. I had to drag it to that one. She's like, well, I saw your movie, now you've got to come see it. Who was that? Jackie Martling? I had to go to battle that, dude. Thank you. You can't talk about sucking. You've got to word it right. Yeah, you've got to code it right. We get the point. Every guy has had their girl drag him to a movie because they turn around and say, hey, I saw your movie. Well, my movies are more entertaining. They've got a little bit of everything. There's just not a lot of movies that are made for both sexes. The Horse Whisperer. Oh my God, if I was ever going to get dragged to that piece of trash. All right, more to come. Give us a call or send us a fax, 212-957-WNEW. And our instant feedback has been moved, I believe, if you're trying to find that today, Anthony. Yeah, yeah. You just click on our pictures and scroll down the page. And you'll be able to find it from there? Yeah, you'll find it. Okay. The Rock of New York 1027-WNEW Celebrity Skin from Hole. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey. As we head into the second hour of the program today, we're setting up here for Godfather Trivia. Yeah. Anthony's the master of film and TV trivia. I don't think I'm the master, Opie. I just think I watch a lot of television, seen a lot of movies. Godfather, one of my favorites. And let's just see what happens. I'm not making any promises. I don't know. You might get burned the first question. Yeah. It's a chance you're going to take. It's a chance I'll take. I don't know. I'm not saying I'm an expert. I just, you know, we'll take a little test here. So you'll accept questions from Godfather one and two? Yes. No. Get three out of it. Just not a fan of Godfather. Oh, Francis Ford Coppola. Take your money and leave with one and two. The biggest joke of that movie was his daughter being in it. Oh, what a joke. Worst actor in the history of Hollywood. What a joke. And the likes of a trilogy of a story with such great characters and actors and actresses and he puts that hat in because it's his daughter. Yeah. All right. Well, here's the deal. First person that stumps Anthony with Godfather trivia will win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house this coming Sunday. And you heard about this, right? You and I are going to be watching the Super Bowl with somebody. It better be cool. And we're bringing a Sony 53 inch big screen projection television. How well we got to break your house up because you're an a-hole. We're going to be pissed. They got a two tuner picture in picture. That's a great feature. Wow. What's that? A two tuner picture in picture. This TV. Oh, so you don't need like a separate VCR or something when you're hooking it up. I got I got I got tricked into that. Oh, wow. Picture in picture. I need two VCRs to work. I need two tuners. What a pain in the ass. The Rock of New York 1027W&W. The Rolling Stones. Good afternoon. It's Ophi and Anthony. Hello. Very, very busy day talking about a lot of different things today on the show. Yeah. A bunch of people calling in with their comments about you've got mail. We'll get that on the radio in a little while. Also, a lot of green tomatoes. A lot of people calling in and talking about the movies they've been dragged to in the past just to get some terms. Terms of endearment. The Horse Whisperer. The Horse Whisperer. Oh, my God. I got dragged to The Electric Horseman back in like the late 70s, I guess. 79, whenever that came out by a girl. Now, is that the worst movie you were dragged to, you think? No, no. There have been some bad ones, but I got dragged to that one because I think it was out at the same time as The Wrath of Khan came out. And I took her to see The Wrath of Khan, so she was like, now you have to go see one of my movies. Like, oh, how could this compete? Khan and Kirk are shooting phases at each other. Oh, wow, love story. That's awesome. Did he get some at least for taking her? Well, yeah. It was the same girl that was hounding me because I was laughing at the TV movie Bill. Oh, really? Same one, huh? Yeah, Lisa. Part of your past. Well, the worst movie for me, I was trying to think if there's anything worse than Bridges of Madison County. And you know, I just can't think of one. No, huh? That's got to be the worst one. That was the worst movie I've been dragged to. That was awful. There wasn't one minute of action in that whole movie. You know, if you were a guy and you were in that theater and you were looking at that screen and you were enjoying yourself, I'd better not say anything. Yeah, don't say you'd have to be a homo. It'd have to be a homo. That would be inappropriate. I mean, come on. Call me close-minded, but it would have to be. I don't know any guy that enjoyed that. You'd have to buy the stick, I think. Because I just don't understand. Right. Especially like you were saying earlier with the Clint Eastwood naked and Meryl Streep staring out the window, getting all horned up. Who wants to see that? Yeah, yeah, Clint's pumping the water with his shirt off and she's up at the window like Oh, just rubbing her big body. You're a dirty boy. Yeah, look at him pumping this water. Yeah, I'll be pumping something else, Meryl. You're filthy dirty looking out that window. Clint Eastwood's got baloney tits. It's just like, and I was in the theater and I had my arms folded and I turned to my right and there was another poor sap with his arms folded on him. Oh, you got dragged to this mess too, huh? What's the mess? This same guy that was in the Outlaw Josie Wales, one of the best Westerns ever made. And there he is, Bridges of Madison County, getting vasculated, getting a little water. Got to take more pictures of some bridges. Whoa, the action doesn't stop here, does it? Wow. You know, I would love to hear from the ladies today. Yeah, yeah. We should turn the coin on this one. Ladies, what movie were you dragged to that you hated? Oh, that the guys made the girls go to. I would love to hear what the ladies say to that one. I don't know. All right. Because I could go to Titanic. I saw that. The girls loved Titanic because of the story of Leonardo. But it was cool. I mean, the effects were great. It was interesting to watch. Yeah, I honestly did not mind the Titanic. It just got a little sappy at the end. But then when you get like Bridges of Madison County, Steele Magnolia's, now one guy takes it to the head with a, yeah. Boys on the side. I'm going to see boys on the side. All right. I think we're set for Godfather trivia, Anthony. All right. Let's see how this works. Wasted a little time there, but that's OK. Give us a call right now. Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven. We are trying to stump Anthony this afternoon. Yeah. The king of trivia. We are looking for your Godfather one and Godfather two trivia questions. I'll slip in no three. Anthony doesn't want anything to do with Godfather three. I'm disassociating myself with Godfather three. OK. Now here's the deal. First person to stump Anthony will win a fifty dollar multi-sport passport to Chelsea peers and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house with that Sony fifty three inch TV big screen projection television. That's huge. Nice. And we're going to do that Sunday. OK. All right. Are you ready to go, Anthony? Ready. All right. Hi, Andy W. Hello. Hi. I'd like to know who is the character you play, the young Bruno. Are you? Clementa. Oh Clementa. Oh, you almost blew it. Bruno Kirby. Oh man. I got. Also the limo driver in Spinal Tap. There you go. I'm sitting here. I'm waiting on the line. I'm like, oh man, am I going to get through? Am I going to get through? What's your name, buddy? My name is Jude Wilson. And where are you calling from? Jersey City, New Jersey. All right. Thanks for playing Godfather trivia. All right. Thanks. Later, man. Hi, Andy W. Hello. Hi. What was the undertaker's name in the first movie? Ah, Buenos Aires. Oh. Look how they massacred my boy. Not bad. All right, man. Are you ready to do this service for your Don? Yeah. Not bad. Thanks, man. No problem. Bye. Bye-bye. Hi. You got a question for Anthony? Yes, I do. All right. Let's hear it. Okay. For Godfather 1, this may be easy, may be hard. I don't know. For the Godfather 1, who played the baby in the baptism scene? It's a name you'll know. Isn't that that annoying Sofia Coppola? Oh, it sure is. Yeah. Oh, very good. She gets her mug in the first one. Yeah. And she decides she's got a star in the third one. And wreck it. And wreck it. Mm-hmm. Well, thanks for playing. Okay. Hi, Andy W. Hi. Hi. What was Vito Coyoni's real last name in Godfather 2? Ah, Andolini. Oh, very good. Okay. Thank you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Good. Okay. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye. Hi, Andy W. Hi. Hi. Who's this? Rich. All right. Rich, you've got a question for Anthony. Sure. All right. What was the sport that Hyman Roth was watching on TV when Michael Coyoni came to talk to him in Miami? Oh, and then they had to keep turning it up so his wife wouldn't hear. That's right. Football. That's right. Oh, thanks for playing, all right? Okay. Hi, Andy W. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. That was a good run. I think he got about eight. The Rock of New York, 1027W, N.E.W. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Blue on Black, Sugar A's latest before that, Every Morning from There, CD 1459, It's Opie and Anthony, having a lot of fun for a Monday. And I got to quickly say, has anyone else seen the latest issue of details with Elizabeth Hurley on the cover? Yeah, baby. I never thought she was hot, but now I am convinced of it. She's got a good look there on that cover. Look how they airbrushed the nips out now. They're barely in there. You're showing me from a distance, so I kind of see them. But yeah, yeah, that's the maximum allowable nip for a displayable magazine. They definitely airbrushed it out. And Rick's saying there's a dirty girl picture in there. Oh, why don't you show me that, Rick? Yeah. In the meantime, Al from Fairlawn, New Jersey, we're talking about chick flicks that we've been dragged to. Yes. The worst movie that a guy could be dragged to was How to Make an American Quilt. It was two and a half hours of pure pain. Remember the ads for that one? Where it looked like just a bunch of old women knitting a quilt and what, Winona Ryder was in it? And they're talking to her about the quilt. Oh my God! Could you imagine being a guy? I'm going to sit through that? Quilting! Us guys will do that early on in a relationship. We will go to these stupid movies. But think about it, ladies. You've been with the same guy for a long time now. When was the last time you dragged him to something like that and he went with it and he didn't have an excuse? Jesus Christ. How to Make an American Quilt. Jen goes to the movies herself now and she wants to see those. She gets pissed at me. She's like, yeah, well, I guess that's one I'll be going by myself today. Like which one? Yeah. Which one? What's it like today? Like the one you saw over the weekend? Oh, you've got mail? She's probably going to go to the movie theater today. Yeah, you've got mail. That's real smart. Let's encourage everyone to find their long lost love on the Internet. Their soulmates. Oh, well that's where you find your best people. On the Internet. Your best perverts. And then at the end of the movie, Meg Ryan is going to just finally meet this guy, which obviously is Tom Hanks, in a park in New York. Like she's going to walk to this park by herself. Yeah, that's real safe. And I'll hack her to pieces. Yeah, monster dad on the cover of the post. I think he was looking for a date. That's a horrible story. Wow, that is a dirty picture. Let me see. And details of it. Oh, look at this. Well, she's standing in front of a washing machine. It's a black and white picture. She almost looks like Courtney Love there. Oh, yeah. She's got the hurling sheik working. Yeah, and she's grabbing herself. Looks like she's scratching an itch. Ooh, a little itch ski. And on the instant feedback, because we're trying to turn the tide here and talk to the ladies a little bit because all us guys have been dragged to some horrible movies in our time. And I'm interested to find out what movies the ladies have been dragged to in their time. And I think this is Janice. Janice writes, the worst movie I had to sit through was Reservoir Dogs. Oh my God, that movie was great. That's one of the best movies ever. Oh, yeah. And Quentin Tarantino directed it, obviously. Come on, that was good. But that's what the ladies are thinking. Maybe they're sitting there while we're watching Reservoir Dogs like we're sitting there watching How Stella Got a Groove. How Stella Got a Groove. What was the other one? The other one with the black chicks. It just looked like they were constantly drinking wine and dancing and talking about how men suck. Yeah, that's on HBO all the time. Line one we need. Okay, let me go over here. Oh, it's horrible. Multimedia, Opie and Anthony Studio. I can't even sit through the commercials for those kind of movies. Hi, N.A.W. Hi there. Hi. Okay, you guys want a bad one? Yeah. When I was in college, I was dating this guy. I set him up with a computer dick. Yeah. Somebody dared me. So we went to go see Iron Eagle with Lou Gossett. It like totally sucked. Oh, I feel for you. Climb high. Climb high and play the tape. Okay, I got one more though. Okay. When my husband and I were dating, before we were actually engaged, I took him to Turns of Endearment. He walked out and dragged me to a hotel. So not only did he not have to see the movie, but he still got some. Wow, you rock. That was ten years ago. Just standing online for a ticket to that entitles him to any orifice he wishes. Believe me. You rock a lot, guys. Love your show. Hey, thank you. Nothing beats those women with one dying movies like the frigging Stepmother. That's the latest one. What guy's been dragged to that atrocity? I'm not going to see Stepmother. That's one that I think our chicks went to see that together. Well. I think Jen and Sandy went to see that. Well, they were smart enough not to ask because they own that one. Exactly. They realized there's no way in hell. And I got rooked into You've Got Mail just because I played my PlayStation for 16 hours. Yeah. Barbara Hershey. Beaches. Hi, NAW. Hi. My husband made me watch Scarface. It was awful. Come on. That's great. Oh my God. I love Pacino, but I hate it. I love Pacino. I love Pacino. I love Pacino. I love Pacino. I love Pacino. I love Pacino. I love Pacino. I love Pacino, but I hated Scarface. I hated it. That's a great- It's too violent. See, it just shows that- Too violent. Men and women- I love The Godfather. I love The Godfather. We have the epic and we watch it all the time. Say hi to my little friend. I mean, there's lines that are the best. Gold pelican. Yeah. Guys and women, we just think completely different. Your womb is salt-polluted. That's great. You compare that. Like you hated seeing that as much as a guy would hate seeing beaches. I don't get it. No, I don't either. You're still there? It's amazing. No, we hung up on her by accident. All right. That's kind of weird. Yeah. There are ladies sitting there going, they hated Scarface and there's guys out there saying, well, I hated the horse whisperer. The horse whisperer. Now playing. All right. Trying to get through some more of this instant feedback. There's a ton of it today. There's a guy that needs your, oh my God, I got dragged to beloved. I like the movies that that movie trailer announcement guy can announce good. Those are the ones I'll see. International terrorists have taken over and there's only one man that can stop it. Like that whole thing. Sure. You never hear him like fried green tomatoes. adventure of women sitting, eating fried green tomatoes. It happened in a small town. It happened in a small town. That explosive depot. Beloved. This guy's right. It doesn't work. This guy's writing about beloved. He lost three hours of his life that will never get back. That's funny. That's great. That's funny. And Anthony, really fast before we take a quick break here. Help Anthony. It's all your fault. I started playing that stupid game Half Life and my wife's threatening to leave me. So the least you could do is help me get out of this section. I've been stuck in for two days. All right. All right. Help this guy out. It says, how do you jump to the FN fire escape from the electrical cabinet in the surface tension level? Oh my God. You got to hit the crouch button as you jump. You could jump higher that way. All right. Is that real early in the game? Yeah. He's kind of early in the game there. Okay. He might have just saved the marriage with that little tip. No, I probably ruined it because once you get Half Life and you're a guy and you're married, your marriage is ruined anyway. It doesn't matter. I don't know who invented that game. All right. We got more to come. One of the things we're doing today on the show is discussing movies you've been dragged to and someone just faxed this over Anthony. 102957 WNAW just says two words. Steel Magnolias. Steel Magnolias. No name, no explanation, just a big letter doesn't need it. 1027 WNAW, the rock of New York losing my religion. It's Opie and Anthony. The phones are just lit with people discussing what movie they've been dragged to in the past. Man, there is a big difference between men and women when it comes to this one, kids. Wow. Worst movie my husband ever dragged me to is Dennis Rodman and Jean-Claude Van Damme. I think it was Double Team. All right, we'll give you that one. Okay, I think the worst thing I ever got him to go to though was the sequel to Eats. Sequel to Terms of Endearment. It was called Evening Star. It was horrible. God, you guys just love torturing each other. Oh yeah, it's like a game. It's ongoing. All right. I want you guys to know you guys are the best. Hey, thank you. Have a good day. Bye. Hi, NDAW.
