 And my new place doesn't have a bed. Sleep on the floor. So I'm actually staying at my brother's house. So here it is. I'm staying at two places. And you're not staying in either one. Bravo. Good job. I am a mess. I need a secretary to figure all this out. All right, but I'm in a good mood. We're right around. We're going to talk about Sherry Lewis in a little while. I can't believe this happened. All these kids show ventriloquists. They're dropping dead. Bob McAllister from Wonderama. And Buffalo Bob Smith. Howdy Doody. And now Sherry Lewis. The creator of Love Lamp Chop is dead at 65 of pneumonia. They all die in threes. I'm telling you. We brought this up weeks ago on the show. This is a weird one, though. Three, you know... Ventriloquist kiddie show people. And we've been talking about this for the past two weeks. That's amazing. So we'll get into that a bit. And if you got something, 212-757-1027, Facts Line, 212-957-WNEW. And the instant feedback all set and ready to go? Yes, it is. WNEW.com. All right, go with that. This is not what I'm used to. 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Third Eye Blind and Jumper from the band from San Francisco. And one of the bands that played in the Imaginary Ballroom thus far on the Opean Anthony Show. We're going to have Semisonic in the Imaginary Ballroom. That's what I'm hearing. And possibly Fastball. These bands confirmed. I do believe they are for later this week. So... Imaginary Ballroom. Something to look forward to. Anybody get any on them on the Hamptons this weekend? Any of you ladies get any on you? I guess Bill's leaving. He's gone. He's out of there. His little weekend fun is over. He hung out with his Hollywood hotshot friends, raising money, using tax dollars to get there to the Hamptons, to hang out with his friends, and raise money for the Democratic Party. Isn't that great? It's a great system. It's a great country we live in. And Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger hosted him one of those nights. What was going on in that household? Is Alec out of his mind? He's a mess. He must have been with her every second. I'm going to go into the kitchen and get something honey. I'll go with you. Just staying by your side 24 hours a day. I'm just going to go take the garbage out of here. No, no, honey. Kim, Kim. Oh, you're right there. Where's Bill? You know I saw him downstairs. You know it's got to be in the back of Alec's mind. Of course. It's the whole weekend. What's he doing down there? Yeah, he's the president on stage, but he left some of his presidential on another woman's dress. Hey, Kim, could you come over here a minute? I've got something I want to ask you about, this little thing I'm looking at on the table. What, Bill? I can help you with it. I know just as much. No, Kim, you stay there. I'll take care of Bill. It's got to be petrified. He'd be like a horny dog or a goat jumping on anything around you. How true, how true, how true. Spielberg, you stayed with him and Kate Capshaw. It's another one. You brought up something really funny on Friday with that whole thing. What was that? With the blue screen and the... Well, if he catches them, you know. Honey, oh my God, Kate! Bill, get off her! What's the matter, Steven? Would this look better if it was filmed in front of a blue screen? You just add in your own background. You can have the making of me doing your wife. Before the actual feature. He's on the cover of all the papers. All you think of when you see him is a horny old goat. He sure is. What's going to happen with this, you think? What in your mind is going to happen when Ken Starr releases this report? The guy is a slippery guy. It's really up in the air. I think he'll just continue to lie and deny. I think he's got to admit at this point. No, he doesn't have to do anything. Unless they... See, if he lies though and they find out that... DNA. That DNA matches up, he is done as the President of the United States. The patch of presidential porridge left on her dress. Yeah. I think he has to go in front of America and admit that... I have sinned against you, my friend. Exactly. You think so? No. He can't take the chance that the DNA is going to match up. That all depends on what comes out when she testifies and when the FBI gets back that test of the dress. That's another thing too. The FBI, he can't just make some funks. Hey, that dress, lose it. No. Just lose it. No. Just send it to the cleaners. Right. Oops. It just gets sent out to the cleaners or something. The next two weeks are going to be very, very interesting to say. We will see. All right. On the way, we got some Steely Dan, Genesis, phones ringing like crazy. We'll go to those next as well. Stay there. The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, Steely Dan, it's Opie and Anthony. Beautiful day today. Beautiful weekend, matter of fact. Yes. Got to love that. Oh, I was mentioning earlier, so I moved into the new place, right? Yeah. Well, let's get the facts straight again. I'm still paying for my apartment in Boston. Right. I'm paying for a place in New York, and I'm not living in either one of them. Really? I'm on my brother's couch. You're a brilliant man. Thank you. But I got the phone hooked up in my new place. Right. Okay? And I'm unpacking bags and stuff and boxes and trying to get the new place going. And the phone has been hooked up for two and a half hours, let's say. Maybe even less. Do you have my phone number in? No, I don't. Does the Boston NEW have my new phone number in? Absolutely not. Does my mom, who lives down the street, have my new phone number, Anthony? I would gather no. Okay. Does my girlfriend have my new phone number? Well, she's got mine. No. Of course. Of course. No one has it because they just installed the phone. Why is the phone ringing then? I don't know. Who was it? The phone was hooked up for an hour, hour and a half, maybe two hours. The phone rings. It's a telemarketer. How did they get my number so fast? I haven't even given it out yet. They do get them fast, man. It's ringing. I'm like, I'm figuring it's the phone company. They screwed up something. No, it's a telemarketer trying to sell me stuff. What were they selling you? I taped it. Oh, you did? What were they selling? I don't know, cabinets or something. Cabinets? I'm renting. I have no need for cabinets. I'm like, this is too good. Something like this is too good. So I push record on my answering machine. Would you like to hear that? Yeah, let me hear. All right. Hi, Mr. D. Yes. Hi, sir. My name is April and I'm calling from Century 21 Cabinet Refacing. And the purpose of my call is to tell you about a service that we're providing for homeowners in the YCLE area. Mr. D, do you own your home? Yes, I do. You do? And this is in my statistics, am I correct? Yeah. Yes, sir. What the f***? I'm kind of in the middle of my job right now. Okay, no problem, sir. I'm a college student. I'm trying to make some extra money on the side. Oh, me too. Are you? Yes. What do you do? I'm telemarketing, sir. Oh. I, uh, this is kind of embarrassing, but I donate to a sperm bank. Oh, okay. Well, I'll call you back. Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of it. I appreciate it. Okay, thank you. This is a whack, which is pretty nice. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. All right. Opie and Anthony. Oh, man. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Van Halen, Dance the Night Away. It's Opie and Anthony. Sing it, Dave. I'm laughing because the front page of the Post. Yeah, they found some new pictures. New videos of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky together. And Monica. Look at her. I know. What a pig. Oh, ooh. There she is. Yeah, mooing at him. Look at that. In picture number one, if you turn to your New York Post workbooks here. Picture number one shows her with her mouth agape, a pose I think Clinton's pretty familiar with. Then picture two, Clinton's rapes his arm over Lewinsky's upper back. Something tells me he's done that a few times also. To shake someone's hand. Picture three, caught between the crowd and the Commander in Chief, a glowing Lewinsky gazes into his eyes. What a mess. And then he gives her a little hug and tries to move on down the crowd. But she just won't leave him alone. Now she's staring at him and then he puts his hand on her shoulder, trying to push her down. That's just the look of love. Come on. The look of love. That's not the look of love. What's that on your lip? What a mess. He's so guilty it's not even funny. Holy cow. Ah. Her wanting. Her yearning. Ma. Her crawl. And you mentioned this Friday, I think. The newspapers are very creative with their headlines. Yeah. Here's one. It's so long. Island for Bill. It's so long. And then what comes in between on purpose? So you'd have to say, it's so long. Island for Bill. And then, heads home from Giddy-Hippen. Head. You said head. My God. That's great. Very nice. So, alright, you got the new videos of the present, Monica. You got that dress. That foul dress. Yeah, she supposedly turned over her little dress that she was wearing the night she paid visit to Bill. And some of his DNA could be on the dress. This is our president, right? We're talking about? We're talking about the leader of the free world. This isn't the guy that got caught for doing some peeping today. No, no, that guy's funny too. But it's the president of the United States. Okay. Just want to make sure. What a mess. Can you imagine if the president had other dresses in the White House that he needed cleaned? I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't. He should. He probably does. Look at him stashed all over the White House. And he'd have to call the laundromats and see if they could get those nasty stains out. Get those stains out, man. I wonder what that phone call would sound like. Hello? Hello. Hi, my name's Bill. And I have a problem with a stain on a dress. I'd like to know if you could get a stain out of a dress. Excuse me? What is that? I have a stain on a dress that I'd like to know if it can be dry cleaned out. It's a big splooge stain. You have to bring over so I don't know. You don't know if you can get a splooge stain out? What kind of stain? It's splooge. It's a big old splooge stain. And it could get me in a lot of trouble. And I just want to know if you could get that out. I don't know. You don't know? I don't know. I don't know. I have to see how it is. Well, I'll let you know. It's on a black cocktail dress. And it's right on the front, right underneath where the chin would be. I don't know. And it's a big old splooge stain. It's bigger than the... We don't know. It's kind of dripped out. I kind of missed it. It's a big old splooge. What do you use to get splooge out? What kind of chemicals? Best use for splooge. I heard that commercial, protein gets out protein. Shouldn't that wash itself out? I don't understand what you say. I don't understand. It's splooge. I don't understand. You know splooge? I don't understand. Like Yankee, Yankee, cranky. When you Yankee, cranky. I don't understand too much English. Okay. Sorry. When you Yankee, the cranky. What are your thoughts on the Opie and Anthony show? They suck. Slow them up. Hang on. Oh, we're having fun today. The Rack of New York 1027 WNEW. What the hell? Another song from Monica Lewinsky. 1027 WNEW where rock lives. It's Opie and Anthony. I just can't get over this, the dress that everyone's talking about. The dress. Did you realize where the dress came from? Where? Monica Lewinsky got the dress from The Gap. She shopped at The Gap. She shopped at The Gap, got this lovely little cocktail dress. She's never doing endorsement. Yes, of course she should. And the president filed the dress and we all know what else is going on here. But the interesting thing is, first of all, The Gap doesn't sell this dress to anyone. Why? I don't know. You could get it in the retail shops. With her it probably took too much material. She used up all the material for it. Like cow-like physique. But this is how weird our country is. Because Monica bought this dress from The Gap and the president filed it, everybody wants this dress. That's the way it works on this country. A ton of women out there want this dress. Remember a few years back Sharon Stone wore the black Gap t-shirt to the Oscars? Oscars I guess, right? Just because she wore a black t-shirt to the Oscars, everyone wanted it. They couldn't keep them on the shelves at The Gap. Same thing is happening with the Monica Lewinsky dress. They're calling the stores like crazy and they can't get the damn dress. So they went like a factory-installed stain or like pre-stained, you know like pre-washed denim and stuff. I want it just like Monica's with the presidential patch of porridge. I've never heard it called that. That's pretty good actually. Yeah, she's definitely gone through a makeover too, you see her? Yes. Well, every day she's in the paper and she looks, well she's trying to look just a little better. Well, they're talking about that in the papers today too. All the women want the Monica Lewinsky hairdo. They want the Monica Lewinsky makeover basically. The look? Okay, we'll start with 20 boxes of Twinkies in one sitting. Isn't the Monica look the Rosie O'Donnell look? It's the same look, right? Yeah. Pretty much. It's the same damn look. Just updated a little bit. With a little of the porridge. Jeez, that little pudge look. But she's trying, like that other one. What's her name, Paula Jones? Paula Jones chopped her nose off to try to look better. They should send some of that nose over to the starving. Or Somalia or something. Very nice. So there you go. Pretty interesting. We'll see what happens. Hey, if you've got an angle on this Bill and Monica thing, we'd love to hear from you today. Or you could use the Instant Feedback through the WNEW website. Just click on our pictures and you can shoot us a letter right to the studio immediately. We'll read it on the air and give you credit for it, right? Yeah. And if you want to fax us, 212-957-WNEW. 1-027-WNEW, the Rock of New York. The Brian Setser Orchestra, recorded live in the Imaginary Ballroom. Jump, jive and wail. We've got a few performers coming into the Imaginary Ballroom this week. I believe on Thursday it'll be Semisonic doing Closing Time and a couple other ditties. And then Friday, the song of the summer, I do believe. Fastball, The Way. Yes. They're coming in at school to play in the Imaginary Ballroom. Hear that on the Opien Anthony Show. That is so freaking cool. All right. The listeners are onto something here. I like this. We were talking about, actually we were coming out of Bad Company, Feel Like Making Love, and we sent that song out to Monica Lewinsky. And the listeners are calling up with requests for Bill and Monica. They're pretty funny, actually. Someone called in for ACDC, Shoot to Thrill. Shoot to Stain. And who was that guy that we just talked to? I forgot his name. I'm sorry. I apologize. Because he came up with a great song, too. David Bowie, Rebel Rebel. Yeah. Put on your dress, your face is in the mask. And all that. Very good. So if you want to add to the list of songs for Monica and Bill, you could do that by giving us a call, 212-757-1027. You could fax them in to us, 212-957-WNEW. Or you could use the instant feedback, right? And maybe we'll play just a little bit of each song and put a little montage together for Bill and Monica. Sure. Sounds like a plan, huh? All right. Also on The Way, we got the Talking Heads and the Goo Goo Dolls with that song that everyone loves. Iris next. Stay there. All right. We're building our Bill and Monica music montage. If you got a song you want to dedicate to the lovely couple, give us a call, 212-757-1027. Here's the Goo Goo Dolls, Iris on the Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW. 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Johnny Lang, Lie to Me. One of the songs he did in the Imaginary Ballroom last week. Yeah. He was absolutely great for us last week. The kid rocks. He did rock and he put on a great show with Buddy Guy. It's hard to believe he's 17 years old. This week in the Imaginary Ballroom, don't forget we're going to get Semisonic to play Closing Time and a few other ditties. And also Fastball coming in Friday to do The Way. So that's something to look forward to here on the Opie and Anthony show. The Song of the Summer. That's right. The Way? Yeah, I think so. I think so too. No other songs really stand out this summer as the Song of the Summer, the song you hear everywhere. You don't want to get stuck in your head. Yeah, when you're tolling around the beach, no matter what station it's on, you hear that same song coming through the radio. It happens every year. There's always one that crosses over to many, many different stations. I think maybe Fastball is one of them. Yeah. All right. Sophie and Anthony, do we have an exclusive interview with Lamp Chop coming up in a little while, Anthony? Well. Is that possible? Yeah, Sophie. I think I'm trying to line that up now. Okay. So, Sherry Lewis, of course, the creator and puppeteer who created Lamp Chop, a little sock puppet, is dead. That's 65 years old. Bob McAllister, who did Wonderama, he was a ventriloquist and puppeteer, dead. And Buffalo Bob was Howdy Doody, dead. And now Sherry Lewis, dead. The trifecta. The triple came out. I'm telling you, celebrities die in threes. But that's like three in the same industry and everything. Same group. Same kids shows, same group. Ooh. A little creepy conspiracy maybe. And what did that guy write on the instant email? Oh, which one? He just knows our show already. Oh, yeah, yeah. Someone already said, hey, hey guys, Sherry Lewis, dead of cancer. Because he's waiting. He's waiting for the musical tribute that you did with Bob McAllister and Buffalo Bob. No, I think we're just going to go with the interview. The interview with Lamb Chop on the way. Lamb Chop, yeah, we're trying to get Lamb Chop on the phone. Oh, I don't think anyone else in town has the exclusive interview with Lamb Chop. Hell no. Hell no is right. Just here. They're too busy doing knuckleheads in the news and all those other wacky radio bits. Ho ho. Hey ho. That's zany. Wow. Hey, did you hear the one? That's wack-zinerific. Here's a wacky story coming out of Tampa Bay, Florida, everyone. Can you believe it? Ho ho. Hey ho. He put a rocket motor on his car and he drove into a brick wall. Ho ho. That's insane. That's wack-a-ricious. So, figure out for our exclusive interview with Lamb Chop. Also, the listeners are getting involved. Actually, they pretty much created this bit, which is pretty cool. We've been talking about Monica and Bill off and on throughout the afternoon here. And people started requesting songs for Bill and Monica. And we're putting together a little montage of songs for the cute little couple. Yeah. Cute cozy couple. You want to hear what we got thus far? What do you got? Hi, NW. Do you have a song for Bill and Monica? Yeah. Pearl Necklace by ZZ Top. Yeah. That's cool. Unperfect. Billy from Queens has one. ACDC Shoot to Thrill. I'm out here. I'm out here. I'm a trigger.

Why don't you hit me with your best shot? Hit me with your best shot. Fire away. Hi. What do you got for Bill and Monica? Oh, I think Gary Smith's big tenent should be just right. That's right, honey. And now we're going to see some of the songs that we have here. Oh, we got some cool listeners. Yeah, baby. Well, if you've got a song for the cute couple, give us a call. 212-757-511-845-5185. Yeah. And we'll see you next time. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

I think Guyro Smith built Big Ten Inch will be just right. Hi, who's this? This is Paul from Cranford. Alright Paul, you got a song for the cute couple? Yeah, the Lemon song from Led Zeppelin. Say no more, say no more! Tell the Jews, run this down my leg. Tell the Jews, run this down my leg. Hi, N.E.W. Do you have a song for the Prez and his lovely little girlfriend? Yes I do, Fat Bottom Girls. Are you gonna let it all hang out? You make the rockin' world go round. Hi, do you have a song for the Prez? Yes I do. Let's hear it. The cars and tonight she comes. I know tonight, I'm gonna make her move. Hi, do you have a song for the lovely couple? Oh, I got a perfect song for Monica Lewinsky. Alright. How about Suck My Kiss from the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Yeah. We came in a little early there, sorry about that. I hope you're enjoying the festivities today. We're in a really good mood for a Monday. I don't know what happened. I think it's the boss whipping us into shape because I don't know if anyone else noticed but on Mondays we're not that good. Yeah, maybe we should just have a formal blanket apology for every Monday we've done so far. Well, we have to apologize for a lot of our bad shows. On Mondays we have really, really bad shows, usually, but not today, thank God. And every time our stock goes down we have really, really bad shows as well. The Dow down today, big, but for some reason when the Dow goes down our stock goes up. So I think between both of us we might have made somewhere in the realm of eight or nine bucks today. Really? I think so. That's cool. Oh, not made, that's total worth now. Okay. We made about two or three dollars. And you might have noticed last week we had a lot of bad shows. Yeah. The Dow is all over the place and we apologize for that. Actually, I'm blaming any bad shows we have on the Asian economic crisis. For some reason it's affecting everything over here. You know something? Yeah. Everyone go out tonight and buy sushi. Because for some reason Japan is going down the tubes and a bunch of people are selling off on Wall Street. It's making me a little nervous. Of course. Go out and buy some sushi. But there you go. Pump their economy up. I think that's the deal though. Our stock went up today so we're having a good show. Okay, that must be it. Our show depends on the stock market like everything else in this country lately. Bill gets that room and the stock plummets. What the hell is going on here? Okay, wow. Lots of facts are coming in. How did you guys do that stained skit with the Chinese lady without laughing? That was hilarious. I know what she's talking about. That was Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton. They want to hear that again. We'll try to get that before the end of the show. My friend was away on vacation. Did not hear the big Willie pop. Please play that again, Emily. Alright, Emily, we'll try to get to that. This guy wants to dedicate a song to Bill and Monica. Dedicate, don't come around here no mo. Very good. What are you getting on the instant feedback? I'm getting from Lake Success. Can you play a bit from your record which is unavailable in New York? New York. It's unavailable everywhere. Not available in stores near you. You played a bit from your record last week called Butt Plug. Yes, we did. Please play another one today. Alright, I got the CD here actually. Hope you and Anthony's the Better World. Don't bother trying to look for it because you can't find it in New York. Unavailable. Unavailable everywhere. I wonder why. Alright, we can play a bit from this. You want to play Hi Mama in Pornum? Yeah, that's kind of cool. Kind of cool. This is so brutal. Give you another taste of our personality here. What would the average mom do if her daughter called and told her that she was not doing what she thought she was doing but she was in porno movies and really convinced the mother that she now went from sweet girl to doing porno. It's brutal. This is really brutal to listen to. This is how we celebrated Mother's Day at our last radio job. We had all these girls call their mothers and breaking bad news to them. The other radio stations are, hey, we're going to send some flowers to your mom in your name as our little mother's day. We have daughters call up and tell moms they're in porno. So this is Hi Mama in Pornum, Hope you and Anthony's the Better World CD where you can't find anywhere. Hold on to your hats. Hi Michelle, you want to play Hi Mama? Yes, I do. I hear you want to play Hi Mama in Pornum. Yeah. Awesome. Now where's your mom live? Montana. What are you doing in Boston? I'm a nanny. You're a nanny? Yes. Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet so you jumped into porno. Okay. I got your mom's number. I'm giving it a call right now. Okay. Nutrition Center. Hi, can I speak to Jean please? Is this Michelle? Yes it is. It's important. Okay, hold on. Uh-huh. So you lost your job, you had no other choice. Okay. You were all alone. Hello? Mom? Yes? I have a problem. I lost my job. Why? Because I just wasn't doing it. I couldn't cope with it, you know. I thought you said it was going great. It was, but things just fell apart. I'm having a really hard time so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to but I know I got a different job. But I'm doing, I don't know how to tell you this. What? I'm doing porn movies. No. Yes. No. Mom. No. Why? It's too late. No. Mom. No. Um, I'll, you hold on. Okay. Oh my God. Holy Jesus, I think she believes you. I'm shaking. Michelle? Yeah? Where can I reach you? Um, I have, I have like three days to get out of here. So I don't. You don't do that. What? Don't do what you told me. What am I going to do? How am I going to get home? You don't have money in the bank? Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling. I had to get an agent. No, you don't. Where, where can I call you? Same number, but mom. What? There's something else I have to tell you. What? Happy Mother's Day. I love you. This is just a joke. I'm on the ring. Oh my God. It's a radio program. Oh, I just wanted to let you know that I love you. Oh my God. I'm thinking about you, mom. You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people. I mean, I wouldn't listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that, you killed me. Oh my God. There you have it. Always makes me laugh. She was just trying to say, Hi mom, I'm important. No wonder this CD of ours isn't available anywhere. Just conjured up that mental picture in her head of her little girl. You know, I came up with a new idea that I want to pull off. What? I want some guy to call his wife and tell him that he lost his wedding ring at the strip club. Well, that's a good one. That's a pretty good one. Hi honey, I lost my wedding ring. At a strip club. At a strip club. Right. Maybe we can make that happen. All right. On the way, we got some Sheryl Crow and Dire Straits and whatever you want to do, give us a call. You saved your beer's soul. Sam Adams, a better glass of beer. It's like my great grandfather used to say, if you have kegs of beer at your house, you're going to get laid. I'm buddy Jim Cuncey. Yeah, we got to get him on the radio. We've had him on in the past. That guy is a blast. To the Caribbean with him. Yeah, he has the best drinking stories ever, ever, ever, ever. I saw him on the beach at like eight in the morning. Yeah, he's got a Sam Adams in his hand. A better glass of beer. We've got to get back to the music. Yeah. 1027 WNEW where rock lives its opiates Anthony. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, stop that now. Cut it out. I don't know. Do you want to play the cleaner thing again? The cleaner. Well, people are requesting it. Well, yeah, okay. Well, Bill Clinton has a problem with stained dresses, I guess. Well, everyone's talking about Monica's dress. Yeah. And earlier in the show, we were just wondering, you know, if the president has more dresses that are fouled in the White House. Maybe he wants to get them cleaned, you know, so the evidence isn't there. And he would have to call it cleaners. Hmm, would he? And he would have to discuss how to get the stains out of the dresses. And we were just wondering how that would sound. Hmm. 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. Pretty big buzz on this guy. Sean Mullins, lullaby, guy from Georgia. His CD's called Soul's Core. And you can't find it in New York yet. But you will in the near future because he was on a small label. But I do believe one of the major labels just picked them up and they'll be distributing that CD in New York soon. Well, good. Very good. And we're pretty proud of the fact we were the first station in New York to bring that one to you. Right. Hey, you know how we were talking about songs that kind of fit the Bill and Monica thing earlier in the show? Yeah, we had listeners requesting songs to Bill and Monica, sure. Mm-hmm. This one's a good one. This one's a good one. Bruce from East Village. The weight by the band. I think that's got to be one of the best lines for this situation ever. Ever. The best line ever. What would that be, Ed? This one. And you put the load right on me. And that doesn't say it all. I don't know what does. There you go, honey. Oh, baby. Yeah. And you put the load right on me. There you go. Oh, my cocktail dress. Damn you, Bill Clinton. I'm going to have to clean this or press it like my prom flowers. That's probably what she did. Wrapped it all up in plastic. Eww. Eww. Pulled it out for her friends. And you know what this is? The cocktail dress I wore. See that? You know what that is? Yeah, but it's got to be an order of appearance. She probably has all her dresses lined up. But I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. I'm going to have to clean this. Remember Monica, if you go to school and do your homework, someday you'll grow up to do the President. Do we have to get off the air? Can we do another hour, man? Come on, man. Let's have. Let's do it. It's your turn, I guess. Like Lennox Lewis, come on, man. Let's get it on. Let's get it on. Let's get it on. Why do you have to have to obey with that British accent, you know? Come on, man. Let's get it on. Let's get it on. Meantime, we're like, knock someone's head across the block. Yes, what's up? So, you know, I left something in here last. I lost something. I can't find it. I left it in here last week. You guys see the month of July? I know. Wow, that did go by. Summer is flying by. Actually, we had a, me and Anthony, while we were driving to Manhattan today, there was a huge sign that the summer is, you know, almost over. John Ski, what? The women are starting to wear more clothes all of a sudden. What happened to that? That's no good. Already. Already? It might also be the 64 degree temperatures we've had. Well, yeah, well, people were bitching about the heat. You know, it's a little cooler, which is nice. I hear the back to school on TV. Yeah. The football commercials. That, and I mean, which is cool because I look forward to that, but that's one of the reminders that like, man, falls just around the corner. I mean, Giants play the Bengals Saturday. You could hear it on NAW, 7.05 Saturday, but I just, it doesn't feel right yet. In a few weeks it will, obviously. I know you love people that like, we're talking about summer and everyone goes, oh, where did July go? Does anyone worry about February? No, not at all. First it goes, damn, where did February go? Where did February go? I was just getting into eight hours of daylight. Yeah. Cold. You know, nothing to say. That's true. Or you know it. Don't even go there. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. Because you know how it works with summer. For some reason, when spring rolls around, it's freezing for months and months. Even in spring, it's still cold. Yeah. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. It's still cold. Yeah, I mean, that's not the case. But in spring, it's still cold for some reason. When Labor Day hits, all of a sudden, oh, you're out. You're sunning the next day. Yeah. Yeah. That is so weird how that happens. It just cuts off and it's done. No, you've got to appreciate this last month. We're long out of breath, guys. I used to spend my summers always at the Jersey Shore. I mean, was it the same like the minute, like the second, the hand-hit midnight. It's all over. Labor Day. It's all over. Boom. Everyone just leaves. on the Jersey Shore they have banners hanging over the overpasses on the parkway, bye bye Benny, go home, all over the place. They've had it at that point. I was on the parkway yesterday, have you guys seen these extreme bumper stickers? No, what are those? It's just like everybody's got a cause and now it's like people cracking on other people's bumper stickers. I just love it, it says your child may be an honor student but you're still an idiot. I saw three great ones this weekend. Once at Earth first, we'll strip mine the other planet later. Very good, I like that. Stop repeat offenders, don't reelect them. Oh nice. I mean you know, there's going to be a little more edge in them. Oh I love the one. Ask me about my grandchildren. I'm going to pull up, first of all if I did get the opportunity to come up to your window and you roll it down and we talk to you it would be about how you drove ten miles an hour in front of me for fifty miles. I just ran you into a tree at sixty because I want to talk about your grandkids. Speaking of traffic too, five more minutes left. If you're on the Queensboro Bridge right now on the upper level, hang a Ui, real quick, they're changing the pattern in five minutes. Well they did. The upper level now is going to be regular traffic now, but right now it's just outbound. How's Charlton Heston going to deal with that? My god damn the motor. Alright we got to get out of here. Yep, done skim. Hey Bill, do you want to hear your song one last time? Huh? Which song? This song is dedicated to you. Oh yeah please could you?
