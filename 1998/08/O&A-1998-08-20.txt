 1 0 2 7 WNEW, the Rock of New York with the latest from Kenny Wayne Shepard, somehow, somewhere, someway. And you know, Kenny Wayne Shepard is not the guy singing on that. No. He's the guitar guy, obviously. The Axeman. That's right. It's Noah Hunt on lead vocals for Kenny Wayne Shepard's band. No relation to Mike. You're disgusting. Thank you. It's Opie and Anthony. Well, Bill did it. Bill Clinton did it. He figured out a way to get out of the house. Did it? Well, there's many things going on with this. Didn't we last week say that he needed to bomb something? Yes. And guess what he did today? He bombed something. He bombed something. Bill Clinton, at a press conference about an hour ago, and said that, confirmed, he did in fact order that we bomb terrorist targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan. So I just think, I swear, I can't help but feel he was just doing this to get out of the house. You know when you get in an argument with your wife? Yeah. And you're just looking for any excuse, a friend to call something, to happen, to get out of the house? What's Bill going to do? Do you think Hillary is giving him hell in Mars's Vineyard? You know it. Is that, I've got to get out of here? You know it. So now he's on his way back to the White House right now. Alone. Alone. He figured out a way out of this thing. Bill scores. He's probably going to Washington for some nookies. Let me pack my Monica tie, once she gave me his little bat signal. And he's out of the house. I wouldn't be surprised when he gets there. His first thing is, I have ordered a strike of suspected terroricides on Mars's Vineyard. Very nice. I'll go one step further. Do we have proof that he actually bombed something this afternoon? Well, it is difficult to prove. They're being really hush-hush about this because they say that the terrorist targets are, it's not like conventional targets. So everything is very vague right now. If it was Baghdad, there's reporters in Baghdad. And we would know if he actually bombed something. Afghanistan is not an easy place to get any info from. Get in and out of, you kidding? And Sudan? Sudan looks bombed anyway. Well there has a civil war been going on there for quite some time. So who could tell? Yeah, that's the building we bombed. It's looked like that for the past 50 years. I think he pulled a wag the dog maneuver here. I think he might have. He successfully pulled the lead story in all the news of Monica Lewinsky once again testifying today in front of the grand jury and replaced it with a good bombing story that Americans love. And there was a rumor that Dustin Hoffman was on the Vineyard. Yes. The last few days. Interesting. Yes, very interesting. We'll delve into that a little more. Of course we will. And you know I think we have exclusive audio from Monica Lewinsky today. Yes, she just got out of the grand jury about an hour ago. As a matter of fact, why don't we go to Tom Brokaw in a few minutes here and we'll get the exclusive audio from Monica Lewinsky. How's that? Very good. And if you've got something for the show today, 212-757-1027 is the phone line. The faxes are spitting out like crazy if you want to add one to the pile. 212-957-WNEW and of course the instant email at WNEW.com. Very good. On the way we got Fuel and Zeppelin next. 1027-WNEW, the rock of New York, pep and tar. Love is a battlefield. All these songs take on a new meaning with all the crap that is going on down there in Washington with Bill and Monica and Hillary and bombing other countries. He had a bomb something. That was his only way to get the heat off of him, quite frankly. I want to say hi to Johnny Love from Limbrook. He's emailing in that we're freaks and he loves it. He especially likes when we played the tape of us two driving into work with the road rage. Oh cool. We were going to say, if you want to tape yourself with a little road rage as you're driving around, because a lot of people have been saying, boy that sounds really familiar. It sounds just like me. lot of emails from people saying, my ride is even worse than you guys were a bunch of pussies actually. You guys really didn't get that angry. You should hear a tape of me. That's because it was just honestly, it was one day that wasn't all that bad. We're going to tape ourselves maybe tomorrow. Yeah. Friday commutes are the best. Or maybe next week. We'll get another one of those on. If you want to tape your own road rage and send it into the show, we'll put the best ones on the air without a doubt. Maybe we'll pick the road rage king and come up with some kind of prize for him. Andrea, the music director here at NEW, she says that her and her husband are much worse than you and I when they're driving. Right. I'm trying to convince her to send a tape in of her and her husband driving into work. Let's hear some people's road rage. Yes. So do that immediately. Just bring a tape recorder with you in the car and let it fly and send it into the NEW. We'll put the best ones on the air and make you a little radio star. How's that? There you go. We've got to head down to Washington. Tom Brokaw is on the line here. Is he? Yes. All right. What has he got? Well, there's a lot of breaking stories going on. The president bombed Afghanistan and Sudan. I can't say that word. The Sudan. The Sudan. Thank you. And Monica Lewinsky just gave more testimony to the grand jury. So he's got an update on both stories, I do believe, with possibly some exclusive audio for Monica herself. Great. Has anyone even heard this lady's voice yet? No, we're investigative journalists, Hopi. All right. Let's go to Tom Brokaw. Tom? Hello, this is Tom Brokaw. NBC Nightly News. The lead story of the day has to be the bombings in the Sudan and Afghanistan retaliation to the embassy bombings in Nairobi. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tom, Tom. Yeah? What's wrong with you? Well, I had a loose shell from my office and it hit me on the head. Okay. All right, continue. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. But in other developments today in the Monica Lewinsky sexual violence, today Monica Lewinsky once again testifying for the grand jury, leaving the grand jury about an hour ago with this statement. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, my client Monica Lewinsky. I have had enough. This whole experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I can't stomach anymore. I feel as if I'm getting the shaft that this ugly matter has come to a head and flown up in my face. This may be a tough load to swallow, but when things are hard, that is when I am at my best. I have faced hard things in the past and I know what is coming. I will meet the challenge the only way I know how, head on. I have licked bigger things than this before and I will again. No one will ever be able to say that Monica Lewinsky isn't a finisher, that she quit before the job was done. I will work nonstop and fight this blow by blow until I am wiped clean of this dirty affair. I will not be stained by you, Bill. Thank you. By the way, the tie I gave you looked great. Obviously, there will be more as the stories develop throughout the day. It's time we're working with our embassy and lightly in the news. Wow, how about that? That's what she sounds like. That's how she sounds. Wow, sounds like hot. Breaking news on the O.P. Anthony Show. Who needs 10-10 news when you've got O.P. Anthony? 10 wins. There you go. Very nice. By the way, we've got the Bear Naked Ladies and Peter Gabriel. Stay there. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from the Bear Naked Ladies. That's one week off their CD, Stunt. Good sounding song, right? The station is happening. The station is alive, baby. Yeah, gotta love it, huh? O.P. and Anthony, we've got CNN on. Well, the President has landed at Andrews Air Force Base. Didn't he just give a statement to Martha's Vineyard? How come he never gets delayed? Exactly. Can't hate that. I do. From Boston to Martha's Vineyard once, I flew. It took me seven hours. I was waiting in airports. You had to go through Detroit. Why does he get the direct flights? Come on now. Nice cushy plane and the helicopter ride. He has a nice tie on. I wonder who gave him that tie. Now he's back at the White House. I didn't see. Was Hillary with him? I don't think so. No, he left Hillary behind. This is important stuff. Oh, no. I'm arguing with them. The Republicans are already putting a spin on this bombing in Afghanistan. They think that Clint has used this just to get out of this sticky mess he's in. Right? Right. I totally agree. Show us the footage of the bombings. Where's that cool film of the bomb going down the air shaft and blowing the walls out? I haven't seen any film yet. We had all that cool film during the Gulf War. I haven't seen anything. He says he bombed something. I want to see proof. We do want to see proof. Get Wolf Blitzer on the phone. Yeah, where's the Scud stud? We need a report from the Scud stud. Come on. I'm not believing anything until I see something blown up. Where's Charles Jacob? Gas, gas. Right, right. Where's Bernie? Is he under a table somewhere? Get Bernie out under the table and show us some footage of this actual bombing. I don't know. Breaking news, US strikes in Afghanistan. There he is, his helicopter pulling up. We'll see him get out with his frigging party shirt on. Yeah, you know he's a broad on each arm. Would that be the funniest damn thing? How you doing Washington? I'm back. He's like, I'm free. I'm free. I left the bitch a couple hundred miles away. Oh man, what a sucker. Well, that's the truth. I tend to believe that he wouldn't have jumped the gun on this one and bombed something as quickly as he did if these allegations, well not allegations anymore, if this hadn't happened. And why is Dustin Hoffman coming out of the helicopter with the President? And Robert De Niro, what's going on here? You know, it's funny, they don't really have any hard proof of who bombed the embassies in Africa yet. There's really no concrete evidence. They have theories and they're still investigating. They have a few leads but nothing is stone. It's like who? Bomb them. Send one to Martha's Vineyard. Send a cruise missile to Martha's Vineyard, please. Just bomb anyone at this point for me, you know? Bomb Detroit. I don't care. Just light up something. All right, well we'll stay on top of this story, of course. Yes. Breaking news. Pass along to you guys when we get it. Hey, we got that cool song from Sean Mullins on the way. Also, we'll do some Elton John. And do we have audio of the President and Air Force One? Yeah, well you know us. We can get audio from anywhere. Yeah, we've got sources all over the place. Yeah, and we actually got a little bit of audio from Air Force One. Very nice. All right, stick around for the stupidity. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. PTO, it's Opie and it's Anthony. Wow. We're checking out Sudanese TV on CNN right now. Got the tube on in the studio. The anchor guy looks pretty peeve. He looks really ticked off that we bombed some buildings in his lovely country. It looks like Geraldo with a towel on this guy. He's got the towel all over his head. The first pictures are coming in from the bombing. Freaking news! From Sudan! You son of a bitch! All right, well there's some fire. I see a building burning. So I guess we did drop something, huh? Well, we can't be certain though because they are having a civil war in that country. Yeah, Sudan's having its own problems. Maybe we didn't do that. Some guy that looked like my cab driver on the way in today is on TV. That's all I know. I don't know who this guy is. Is he the Geraldo of Sudan? He must be. All right, well there you go. The first pictures coming in from the bombing. Very good. What do you got over there? Anything on the instant feedback? Just a bunch of people saying that Bill should have kept in his pants. All right, we all know that. We do know that by now. Well, speaking of that, we've got sources all over the world for this lovely radio show. And we've got some exclusive audio of Air Force One. How did we get that? That's got to be classified. It is classified, Anthony, and I can't give my sources away. I'll go to jail before I give my sources away. But obviously the President had to fly back to Washington. We actually got audio of the First Family in flight on the way to Martha's Vineyard. Wow. And we picked up some audio from the cockpit. The black box. The black box. Yes. So if we could go to that audio now, that would be really good. Oh, there it is. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking from the flight deck. Welcome to Air Force One. On behalf of the crew, I'd like to say hello to Mr. President and the First Family. I hope you enjoy your flight today to Martha's Vineyard. Today's in-flight movie is Liar Liars starring Jim Carrey as a father whose inability to tell the truth makes his wife and child's life a living hell, thus jeopardizing his marriage and his career. Once again, the movie is Liar Liar. Enjoy the flight. Wow. They picked the wrong movie to show on that flight. It's abusive. Yeah. I don't think any other station's got that, right? I'm sure they don't. I don't think the Fatty Show has that. Does he? The Fatty Show? What is his name? I don't know. Oh, the cartoon characters. T-Rex! Oh, that guy, yeah. Watch me pull a Twinkie out your head. Oh, Blaine Winkle, that trick never works. What do you think they're doing today on the radio? Probably nothing. Maybe Knuckleheads in the News or something stupid like that. We've got breaking news here on our show. Let's do Knuckleheads in the News. Oh, Blaine Winkle, that's stupid. Okay, let's do it. Feed me some more. I think I'm down at 800 pounds. 212-757-1027 if you've got something for the show. They're showing more pictures of the bombing. Can you tell what we blew up over there? Are you sure this isn't footage of the Bronx? No, I'm serious. I don't know the difference. I'm serious. That's MLK Boulevard. It is, right? Yeah. Oh, they're tricking us again, CNN. Breaking news. Come on. I have a comment about that, but I'll move right along here. Move along, nothing to see here. 1027WNEW with the Rock of New York with Joe Jackson, the band Everything Before That, doing hoots off their Supernatural CD, it's Hope and Anthony. We're having a lot of fun today. Breaking news. As you know, by now we've bombed Afghanistan and Sudan. Terrorist targets? Yeah, there's supposed to be supply and training facilities and nerve gas warehouse. I don't know. Guys saddle like this so we can't get HBO anymore. Yeah, we're going to get the latest info with Tom Brokenjohn a little bit. CNN has been showing the Sudanese TV broadcast. Bunch of guys that look like Geraldo with towels on their head. No one can decipher what they're saying, but I think our expert translator will be able to translate their language for us so we can find out how they're feeling after the bombing, right? I bet they're not too happy. They're not happy at all. I want to stick up for Chris Rock today, too. Chris Rock? Chris Rock. Hallelujah, brother man. What happened? Well, he went on the Today Show yesterday, right? Yeah. Yeah, he made some comments about the whole Clinton affair and it got a little raunchy. That's what you get when you get Chris Rock on your show, though. What did they think they were getting? Sinbad? Yeah, getting Chris Rock lights? Yeah. No, you were getting Chris Rock and he let a few nasty words go by like ass, crap and scumbag, words we've all heard by now. And the Today Show freaked so when they rebroadcasted the Today Show out west on the west coast, they cancelled Chris Rock's appearance there and they substituted it with some kind of cowboy rodeo college report. Oh, there you go. That's just like Chris Rock. Chris Rock said ass twice and Matt Lauer was freaking out saying, remember, remember, this is a family show. Because he said ass. He said ass and scumbag and he said how he wants to whoop Kenneth Starr's ass. He got it in trouble for that? Yeah, pretty much. That's stupid. Is the Today Show claiming to be some type of family show? I find Al Roker's ass offensive. Yeah, without a doubt. Never mind hearing the word. What does Al Roker do on that show? I don't know. He comes out and talks to people that, he talks to roofs that hold signs up to the TV. Oh, tough job, Al. Tough job. How many million dollars a year does he make to say hi to people on the street? And what's your name? Hi mom. You ever see those people that stand out there? Yeah, they're mutants. Embarrassing. Well, they're all the tourists. You never see a guy from New York making his way on TV, really. We're from Tulsa and I just want to say hello to my wife. And cousin. And cousin. They're the same person. Hi Glenda. Yeah, right, exactly. So, I don't know, what's up with the Today Show's A's? But they should have known what they were getting into when they have Chris Rock on the show. I like it. Matt Lauer is like freaking out and he goes to cut Chris Rock off and go to another guest. And Chris Rock's about to go, so Matt, what's the matter, Matt? Were you on the pipe? Claiming to be a family show. I suggest that we try to do something actually with the Today Show. Like? I don't know. You should see what kind of listeners we have out there. I know we don't have many, but maybe we could get one to do something wacky. Oh, in the little crowd of rubes? Yeah. When the camera comes on? Yeah. I say we set up a bounty. Hmm. Like, first girl to show her boobs. Oh man, would that be mint? First girl to show her boobs on the Today Show when they're out in the street. I will personally give $100. Are you in for $100? I'm in for $100. $200. Definitely. I want to see how much of a family show it actually is. What about you? You in? We barely pay him. I don't get paid anything. All right, throw in $10. How about a buck-fifth? Come on, throw in $10. All right. If somebody, if a girl on the Today Show. $10. We're up to $210. Get on the Today Show. Yeah, we want to show the Today Show how much of a family show it actually is. The crowd shot when Al Roker's out there, they're doing some fun thing outside. And flashes, her boobs. I'm serious. I'm serious. It'll take them off. How are they going to prove it though? It'll be the talk of the town if there's naked boobs on the Today Show. We'll know. And then we'll have you come up here and they'll have a sign too. No, just naked boobs. Just naked boobs is easy enough. That's going to be tough to pull off. Yeah. But look at the phones going crazy. I bet you the listeners are going to add to the pot here. Hey Al, take a look at these. Whoa! You can get an Al Roker to show his breasts. No, I don't want to see that. That would not be fun. No. So what do you think? Do you think we can make this happen? That would be really neat to see. Okay. Maybe we could take a collection around the NAW studios. We could come up with more than $210. Right now the jackpot is at $210. First girl to show her boobs live on the Today Show when they go out in the street. All right. And we'll stick up for Chris Rock and we'll show the Today Show how much of a family show it really is. I'll start taping the Today Show so if it happens we'll give it a verify it. Okay. All right girls, come on. I know someone will do it for us. Yeah. I guarantee it will happen. Bring it up here and make it a radio star too. There you go. So on the way we've got another report from Tom Brokenjaw and whatever you want to add. Actually the phones are ringing so we don't even have to give out the phone number. We'll be back in a bit. The Today Show all pissed off at Chris Rock because they think they have a family show. Please. First girl to show her boobs in the street when they're on live. How much money are we up to? We're up to what? Two hundred and ten dollars. Actually there's a few people on the phone that want to add to our pot. All right. Hi Eddie W. I want to contribute to your cause. Yeah. Two hundred ninety dollars but I have one caveat. Okay. It can't be a homeless pig. I don't know dude. I think we just need like boobs at this point. Even ugly ones? Even ugly ones. All right. Actually the uglier the better. All right. If you guys are in I'm in. Two ninety. Make it even five hundred. Are you serious? I'm dead serious. All right. But I got to see it on tape too. No problem. Actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to have Rick talk to you and get your number and your name and you'd better not back out on us. It's a deal. All right. We're up to five hundred dollars. First girl to show her boobs on the Today Show. I'm in. I love you guys. The Rocker is doing the stupid weather. We'll show them what type of family show they've got. I love you guys. I'm in. Thank you. One oh two seven W.N.E.W. The Rock of New York with the Dave Matthews Band and Stay. It's Opie and it's Anthony for your ride home. So much freaking stuff going on today. Big news day. Yes, big news day. But we're also sticking up for our pal Chris Rock. Yeah. Today Show. What a bunch of broods. Well the problem is the world is getting way too politically correct. I think a lot of people realize that at this point. And Chris Rock was on the Today Show yesterday morning to promote his HBO show, which is a great show by the way. I think we're going to get him on our show eventually. But anyway, he was on the show and the Today Show knows what Chris Rock is about. Yeah. Why'd they ask him on? Why did they ask him on if they had a problem with his language and how he discussed the Clinton and Monica thing yesterday morning? He used words like ass and scumbag and crap. I've never heard those words before. And the Today Show thinks it's a family show and that was inappropriate language for morning TV. Then did they go into a segment on thong bikinis on the beach? No, I think they probably had an update on the shootings in Jonesboro, Arkansas or something with all the gory blood and details. Yeah, sure. Or maybe the bombing in Africa. Yeah. Family show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure it is. But they weren't getting Sinbad, they were getting Chris Rock. Yeah. Okay. This is funny, man. And they should have expected this type of language from Chris Rock and they should lighten up is what we're saying. So we have started a little thing on the Opie and Anthony show. We want to show the Today Show how much of a family show they really are. Now we understand we don't have the power of the listeners yet to just ask and have something happen. No, no. But we're sure as hell going to try. So we do what's the second best thing, offer cold hard cash. Exactly. So you come up with how much money? Well, I'm giving a hundred. You're giving a hundred. Rick, who produces the show, is giving us ten because we don't pay him. And then you walked around the building. Walked around the building, been in promotions at a twenty. So that's two thirty. Two hundred and thirty dollars. And then we had a listener call and he's going to give us two hundred ninety dollars if we make this happen. Don't be so cheap. I'll go up to one fifty. I'll do it. Yeah, you do one fifty. I got to go on fifty. Yeah, that's okay. All right. So we're up to three hundred and thirty dollars officially. And if this listener comes through, then you're talking six hundred and twenty dollars if I do the math. Six hundred twenty bucks. I'm going to start taping the Today Show. Okay. And when Al does his little weather thing. Yeah, you see that? When Al does his weather and they got all the rubes from Wisconsin holding up signs. We want a girl to flash her boobs. Yes. As a camera. Yes. And we'll show the Today Show how family oriented the show actually is. And if you make the show, we watch the tape and it's you. We hand you over the cash. Officially three hundred and thirty dollars. Officially. It could be up to as high as six twenty if this guy comes through that we had on the phone earlier. By the end of the show, it could be up even higher. Who knows? We got people offering more money. Okay, very good. There you go. That's one thing that's going on. Also, we bombed Afghanistan and Sudan. Sudan. I wait and let you say that name because for some reason I'm having a mental block and I can't say Sudan. You're like George Bush with Saddam's name. Saddam, Saddam, Saddam Hussein. We bombed those those deadly terrorist targets. And if you were watching CNN a little bit, they had these guys that look like Geraldo with towels on their heads. It was a it was a live feed from Sudanese TV and Afghani TV and Afghani TV. So on the phone live from Afghanistan is Tom Brokaw. How do you do that? Didn't we just talk to him from Washington like an hour and a half ago? Yeah, well, yeah, he did. Well, he must really be groggy from the flight. Yeah, he was in the transporter or something. Okay. Okay. But yeah, Tom's gonna is gonna make sense of this whole mess that is going on today. Okay. Let's go to Tom here. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. We're out of Afghanistan where President Clinton has ordered a bombing in retaliation for the bombing in Kenya. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tom. You sound a little out of sorts here. Well, it's been up for many, many hours and a little sleep with Monica, little fancy and it's bombing. Okay. Well, continue with your report. I'm sorry. I'm very angry in Afghanistan. The Afghani people are very angry with the bombing mission in L.A. Sorry, this is a serious issue. Okay, go ahead. We have exclusive audio of Afghani television with a translation. Let's go to that audio now. We are angry, angry as if someone has slept with our goats. The American president using his bombs as he uses his penis, dropping loads where they do not belong. Our turbans are spinning with anger. Our brothers must rise up against America. Seven, 11 workers take a whiz in the slurping machine. Stop drivers, fart when your fare is in the cab. Your bombing has caused tens of dollars of damage to our cities, except for the city of Balakalala, which now looks a little better than it did. Your president should whack the carrots and leave us alone. And how could he sleep with that slob, Monica? I wouldn't do her and I have banged llamas. Stop your aggression or we will be forced to stop supplying you with our main exports, Afghani people. As you see, anguish coming out of Afghanistan. This is some broken jaw. Obviously, rightly so. OV&M, what do you consider N-E-W? You getting any instant feedback over there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. People wanting to contribute money. Oh, good, good. Today's show thing. Okay. Plenty of those. Yeah. And wow, we kick ass, Hope. Shannon loves us. People are actually starting to say we kick ass? Mm-hmm. Are you serious? And Joe, from what he calls the garbage capital of the world, Staten Island, New York. He liked the news reports with Luscious Lewinsky and the Oknads planning terrorist attacks with slushies. That was pretty good. Let me state here, I'm going to be the first to say this because we're breaking news all the time. With Afghanistan being bombed by Bill Clinton, watch out when you're sipping those slurpees and getting those hot dogs and those burritos in 7-Eleven. You don't know what's in there, do you? Okay. Watch those burritos. We will. Speaking of news, we've got Tom Brokenjaw on the phone again. Good. He's got some exclusive stuff here. Oh, what? Turn your head and it feeds back. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, New REM, coming in the fall. Can't wait to hear that. It's Hope. It's Anthony. Do you have to sing? I didn't sing. When the song is playing? I didn't sing. Here's what I have to listen to during that song. Wait, Earl. Earl, you were in here. Get over there. Earl, back me up, man. What did he sound like? I have no response to that. Oh, Earl, you saw me down the river. You're a puss. That was horrible. That was just a dream. It wasn't that bad. It was horrid. Thank you, Earl. God, thanks, Earl. The whitest black man I've ever met in my life. Are you really black? Are you? Yes, I am. Of course he is. There's no definition. Of course he is. Are you sure? What kind of a racist statement is that, Opie? What do you mean by white? Listen to his voice. Earl, do you have any rhythm? No, I don't. Can you bust out a rhyme for us? No, I can't. You really can't, right? No, I can't. It's okay. I'm a rock dude. That's okay. I respect that. I've gotten some flack in the community. A little bit, yes. Really? Do you get flack in the community for liking rock and roll? Earl, what's up with that, Earl? What's up with that, Lance Eplen? What's up with that? Growing up, yes, I did. I caught a lot of flack for it. Did you? Yes. It's like, Biggie Smalls never listened to Zeppelin? What up with that, Earl? Goddamn. Puffy listened. Yeah, Puffy got some zeppelin. Now they're all sampling the rock songs. See, I think you're ahead of your time there, Earl. How's Scott so doing? He's cool. Does he talk about us at all? Yeah, maybe we can get some insight into him. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. How's Scott so doing? He's cool. Yeah? Yeah. Does he talk about us at all? Yeah, maybe we can get some inside info. No, not negatively, no. Oh, really? I don't know. Oh, his face looks like Clinton's did when he was doing that speech the other night. All right. Yeah? You don't hear any, hey, Earl, what about those two a-holes doing afternoons? They're ruining everything, Earl. No, he's giving you the benefit of the doubt. Is he? Yes. He's giving you the benefit of the doubt. No, Scott is very fair. Fair? He is extremely fair. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. I'm going to wait a few weeks before I say they suck publicly. You know, if Scott Muney goes on the air and tells everyone we suck, we're done. We're just waiting for his blessing because if he goes on the air and says we suck, we're going to be run out of this town. Believe me, you'll know it when he hates your guts. Oh, okay. Really? You'll know it. Have you ever had the wrath of Scott so? No. Have you ever done anything where he was... I witnessed it. Earl, you bastard, you forgot to bring me this or that. No? No. Have you ever gotten bitched at by Scott so? No, not at all. No? I know better. Wow. All right, cool. All right, we've got to get Scott so on the show one of these days. Yeah, maybe he'll come on after the benefit of the doubt phase is over. Exactly. We've got more people that want to contribute to our Today Show thing. Yeah, I think this is a great idea. Earl, we're sticking up for Chris Rock. You should. All right, very good. I'm turning your mic off. That was great radio, Earl. Thank you. You should. Yeah, Chris Rock getting the flack for going on the Today Show and being himself. Yeah. I don't know what they were expecting. They book Chris Rock for the Today Show and expect Sinbad. Yeah. They expect Earl. Hey, Earl. They book Chris Rock and they expect Earl. What does the black community think of Sinbad? You really want to know? Yeah. Yeah. One shade short of a sellout. Wow, look at that. Oh, okay. Very good. All right, thank you. You know what? Have you seen the show? What is the show vibe that he's on, Sinbad? Awful. You know what Sinbad looks like these days? I swear to God because he's got that reddish hair and it's cut real close. He looks like the old G.I. Joe with the lifelike hair. Remember? I used to have that. It's like, wow, mom, I want the G.I. Joe with the lifelike hair. He's got this little hair helmet thing going. I was expecting a string. You know, move out, man. Does he have the kung fu grip? That's very good, actually. He does. Sinbad looks just like him with the goatee and everything. Yeah, so we're sticking up for our pal Chris Rock because the Today Show is all up in arms because Chris used words, ass crap and scumbag on the air. And that's what he was calling Matt Lauer? No. Oh, okay. I think he was calling Al Roker that for being a sellout. Look at her all shaking his head. But anyway. Al Roker's got to get on the crack pipe and lose some pounds is what Chris Rock was saying, I think. See, Al Roker is like 90 pounds. Yo, man, I need some. I'm hurting real bad. He can just smoke Willard Scott's toupee. Oh, God. Anyway, so the Today Show basically thinks that the language that Chris used on the show is not appropriate for morning TV. Yes, it's family oriented. We don't want to offend anybody. Now, let's go to the carnage in Africa and show some dead bodies. Yeah, exactly. Hypocritical. But we are looking for a fine young lady to show her boobs live on the Today Show when they go out in the street to show the Today Show how family oriented they actually are. Do one of those segments. Yeah. So get by the railing and just flip the shirt up and we will hand you cash because we don't have that dedicated audience yet like some people do. I mean, you know, Howard could probably get someone in two seconds. Yeah, we got to bribe. We got to bribe people. We understand our position, but we come through with cash. Yeah, we're up to a thousand dollars, a thousand and fifty dollars unofficially, officially well over six hundred that we could actually get from people. So, but it'll probably be in the thousand dollar range when it's actually tomorrow's the first day that this could happen. So I'm going to set the VCR at home. I'm going to tape the Today Show and I'm going to look and see if a girl flashes. If I see a girl flash, we got to get her up here and give her her money. Where do I send my check? Any W. Hi, I want to contribute to the show your kids on today show fund. Call it the day show. What's your name? Well, we actually need someone to do it, too. You know, I, you know, I wish I could. I really do. When you said it, I was thinking, you know, I could do that. That wouldn't be bad. All right. We're up to just under a thousand dollars. How much do you want to contribute? I'll contribute a hundred bucks. Hundred bucks. Wow. Anybody that's got the nuts to do it, you know, they deserve some decent money. Wouldn't that be great to say fat Al freaking out? You can't do it. Back to you. Back to you. OK, so where do I send my check? Hold on the line. Hi, any W. I want to donate two fifty to the have the girl go on TV. Two fifty. Two fifty, buddy. Wow. That's a lot of cash. My wife's four and a half months pregnant. Anything with a new set of tits, I'm in. All right. Well, add it to the list. Hold on the line. Did they get your info yet? No. All right. Hold on, man. The Rock of New York with the pretenders middle of the road off the learning to crawl CD. That's the same CD that has this little ditty on it. It's somebody's music, isn't it? Yeah, someone's music bed. Hello, it is the Rush Limbaugh Show. Excellence in broadcasting talent on loan from God. With the circumstances of the past few weeks, I am covered in baby oil, manipulating my unit with joy. I know, Rush, you hate the president of the United States. What else is new? You have anything else to talk about? Six years. The guy's been waiting for. Oh, shut up. Crap, the proverbial bed. And he's diddling himself as he watches the news reports. Hey, we got two more ladies on the line that want to try to show their breasts on the Today Show. All right. Chris Rock getting dissed by the show. Well, they say it's a family show, the Today Show, and Chris Rock was inappropriate saying words like ass. No, you know, if a naked breast showed up on the Today Show, I wouldn't consider that show a family show anymore. Would you, Anthony? I would watch it. True. Right, right. It wouldn't be what they consider a family show. Annie W. I'll show my tits. Are you guys crazy? You will? Of course. Wow, we can do this. We've got more than $600 at this point. Are you kidding? If you go down to the Today Show and go out by the barrier, you might have to get there early to get a good spot, but it'll probably be worth the money. And when the camera goes on you, you flash your boobs and you will come down here and we will hand you cold hard cash. Really? How much is it up to you? It's at least what we can verify and definitely get from people, $750. I'd do it for like $10. You guys kidding? Well, we're not kidding. If you do it, then it's yours. It's up for grabs starting tomorrow. Tomorrow is the first day. The money is on the table. How do I get a good spot up by the barrier? That is up to you and everyone else that's going to try it. Uh oh. Yeah, if you figure it out and do it, it's yours. Got to sleep without a roker? No, we wouldn't subject anybody to that nightmare. All right, so I'll see you guys tomorrow morning. All right. Beautiful. Bye. We'll be looking for you on TV. Hi. Now, who are you? Dawn. Hi, Dawn. Hi. I hear you want to do this too, huh? Yeah. Well, the first person who does it gets the money. Simple as that. Okay. The money is up for grabs starting tomorrow morning. How much is it? Uh, what? Over $700. Okay, what if I put a lipstick WNEW across my chest? We'll give you an extra $100 for that. Okay, cool. And what if I get arrested? Um, then I don't even know you. No, I'm only kidding. Actually, technically, you're allowed to walk around the streets of New York with a shirt on. A shirt on, yeah. Great. I don't know if you'll be breaking any laws that I know of. Okay, well, what street are they on again? 48th and 5th. Okay. Yeah, and you don't want them to come on? Get a good spot early, like 7 o'clock. 7 o'clock and 48th and 5th? Yep. Definitely. And where do they pick up the money? We're going to start taping the show starting tomorrow so we can verify it was you, and if it was you, then boom, we'll give you the money. You come down and get it. Great. We ain't kidding. Great. All right. Okay. Well, good luck tomorrow. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with the Talking Heads. It's Opie and Anthony. We're staying on later and later as we go along here. Yeah, we should be the three to midnight show in a couple of months. That'd be fun, right? Yeah. There's nothing else going on on the station after us. Oh, I'm kidding. The boss is sitting right here. That's why I said that. You're too confrontational, man. I like that, though. You know? Hi, boss. Did you like the show today? I've been here a little while. I think, you know, you're losing it. Your blood sugar is gone. We should have like a little machine in here that they have for diabetics. That's Opie's blood sugar. Uh-oh, it's down. We better get them off the air. He's shaking. That's what happens in the six o'clock hour. We need the six o'clock hour catered. Jell-O. Can we make that happen? We have Jell-O molds, bro. Jell-O shots. Jell-O cream cheese like you get at Thanksgiving for your grandmothers. That'd be good. It's easy to digest and it goes right to you. Opie's a, we talked about this, Opie is a grazer. See, I'm a, I'm a binger. I could eat at noon and I'm fine until I have dinner. You have to eat, you have to graze the whole day. All day longer. I'd lose. You're like, I have low blood sugar. You could hear him during certain breaks chewing his cud, bringing it up from the fourth stomach. You eat like a lady. I know, I do. I'm a fag. Where were you last night? Where was I last night? We were supposed to get some sushi. I had a headache. So you cancel our date? Dude, if I was at a sushi restaurant with you, we would look like the biggest, I know. I was with my wife. I know but we still look like the biggest swishies. Oh gosh. I got to tell you that too. After we went to Finley's in Huntington and there was a band playing with this girl singer. Really? But now I'm with my wife so I have to make it like I'm interested in the Yankee game that's on the TV too. So I'm watching the band like, �Yeah, well they're really good. They sound good. The girl's got a great voice.� And I'm staring at her, I was like, �Oh, Jen's sort of noticing.� Hey, three to five. Come on, Yanks. Pick it up. Pick it up, guys. Come on. Come on. Then I go back to the band. Look at that keyboard player. He's good. He's good. Obviously I'm not looking at the keyboard player. Sure. I'm like, �Oh, come on. Bring it on. You're blowing with basses loaded, guys. They'll rally, hun. They'll rally. Don't worry.� We are pigs. I know. Well, now she knows what you were up to last night because you listen to the show every day. Oh, Jesus. You idiot. I didn't even think about that. Jen, this is just a part he plays for our radio show. He doesn't actually do this when he's out and about. Yeah. Okay? Jen knows you're full of ass. I know. There you go. All right. We've got to get out of here because the Giants are playing in a little while against the Jets. That starts at 715. We'll have a little song in and we'll have giant football. J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets. What? You're a Jets fan? Today. Oh, we sponsor the Giants here. You've got to be the Giants fan. I am the Giants fan. That's how it works. We go against each other. Ugh.
