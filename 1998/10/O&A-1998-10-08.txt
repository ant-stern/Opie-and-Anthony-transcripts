 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, tragically hip. That's Poets off Fenton Power. Good afternoon, it's Opie, it's Anthony. Hello. And just in case you're wondering, the fan is up to hour 19 of discussing the play from last night. They've been discussing the play for 19 straight hours. Well, there's a lot of people that want to call angry people. I, like you, I'm sure, have a Yankee hangover today. Yeah, that was a little bizarre. A little bizarre, but they have been discussing the play for 19 straight hours. Someone call the Guinness Book of World Records, please. Uh, yeah, guys? Yeah. I got a, uh, I got a comment about that. I mean, what's with that shit? You're standing there, you should have picked the ball up. Yeah, could you believe that? You didn't even dream, you just watched the guy running around the base. Hey, you know, I'm pretty pissed off. Yeah, I think we all are. Next caller. Yeah, how you doing? Uh, pretty good. What's up? Well, um, did you see that guy drop that ball? I mean, he didn't even pick it up. I mean, he hit the guy's back and he just got watched the guy like a strong home run. Yeah, he's a blockhead. Yeah, that's really stupid, huh? I agree. Let's take one more call here, okay? Hello? Yeah, what's going on today? Yeah, I think I got a new perspective I want to add into this conversation having about the Yankees. Yeah, okay. I heard that guy not picking up the ball. That's ridiculous, huh? Sure is. What an idiot. Yeah. I'm pretty pissed off as a Yankees fan. Well, you can't argue the calling to the play's over is what we want to say. Too much. Nineteen hours and counting, they're discussing the play on the fans. So you might want to keep your radio here for a while. Yanks lost, we go to Cleveland. That's all you need to know. Yeah. Exactly. All right. It shouldn't have gotten that far. No. Is what I'm calling in. Yeah. Yeah, it's all on fine. The guy pulled a bonehead move, but for God's sake, it shouldn't even have gotten to X-Rannings. There you go. Yankee should have ended that. You know, maybe someone should get on the fan, you know, call them up and say, hey, open Anthony's say to stop discussing the play. It's up to 19 hours and five minutes now. It's going to be counting. We're going to keep track of that today on our show. Marathon, yeah. A marathon. 212-957-WNEW. That's the fax line. Phone line 212-757-1027. A lot to get to today. So stay right where you are. On the way, we got some U2 and we'll come back with some Jimi Hendrix. 1027-WNEW. The Rock of New York. Days of the new and the downtown. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony. And don't forget later this hour when you hear the Boys of Summer by Don Henley. Be the 10th caller to win a pair of tickets to an imitation only acoustic performance by Cheryl Crow. You'll have to call 212-757-1027 when you hear Don Henley. All right, NW, what do you got? We want to hear the Licky Licky song for your old boss. That song's great. Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick. Yeah. Yeah, this is our old boss at the station we used to work at before we got fired. And we did this goof song on the Volkswagen commercial, the Da Da Da song. And he didn't like it because we were hitting a couple of gay issues that he felt was in bad taste. So he called us in the studio and we recorded his phone call telling us maybe we ought not do this anymore. And then we took his phone call and cut it up and put it to music, which really made him so happy. So here's our old boss, 1027W, NW, The Rock of New York, semi-sonic and closing time. Don Henley before that, that was a song you had to be listening for to win the Cheryl Crow tickets. And we do have a winner. Rick is getting the info as we speak. I think we'll have another chance for you to win next hour. Did I give the song out right now? Sure. All right. You got to be listening for R.E.M. Stand. If you hear that, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027 and you will score tickets to see Cheryl Crow. All right. Who's the winner? I grab that mic. Oh, he doesn't even know he's not prepared. Oh, look at this. Oh, waste of time. Laura is running Laura Glatzer of Hoboken. Cool. Hoboken Hoboken. Very good. All right. Sophie and Anthony, what do you got over there? Well, I know what I'm going to be doing tonight. What? I'm watching a brand new Colombo. I'm hooked on Colombo. Colombo is great, but this one is getting really bad reviews in the paper. Excuse me. Excuse me. Four stars. The one I read, I think it was in the post, said one star. They're way off. Daily News got four stars. See, it just goes to show you critics don't know anything. If you're a Colombo fan, it's probably great. I love watching him solve those mysteries, Opie. You always get the crook, bad guy, kills somebody, and then Colombo comes up and tries to get info from them, and they always give too much information. It's like these criminals during Colombo should just shut that barry up. You hear of a lawyer, first of all, and then the other guy's like, I just can't understand how he got into the window. Well, obviously it's easy, Lieutenant. He stepped on the chair and walked through the window. Well, that solves everything. He tricks them and stuff. The guys, if they just shut their mouths, Lieutenant, talk to my lawyer. Damn, I'm screwed now. That's it. I loved Colombo's car. He always had the donut tire on the back. He still got the same old car. Yeah, the rag top with the donut tire on the back. He'll dress like crap. It's getting a little old, though, I must say, these days. Yeah. And it's easier to tell which eye is the fake one now. It just sticks straight ahead, and the other one's moving all over. Pardon me, man. Whoa, look who's coming through the doorway. Get out of my goddamn way, you bastard. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Dirty Colombo. Dirty Colombo. Hello, ma'am. This is Lieutenant Colombo. I got a couple of questions to ask you. Could you shove your fist up my a**? I'd love it if you could just stick your fist up my a**. Listen, get your husband over here. We'll pop my eye out, and he could skull f*** me. Could you do that, please? Just skull f*** me. I love that. Mrs. Colombo, she pulls out a big a**, rips my eye out, and just shaves that thing right to my brain. I love it. All right, thank you. Oh, pardon me. One more thing, ma'am. One more. Could you bury your boot up my a**? Could you do that? And could you just grab my a** and twist it like a pretzel? I'd love if you grab my a**, grab my shriveled old Colombo a**, and twist that thing like a pretzel. Okay, ma'am, I gotta get back to the precinct now. Oh, before I leave, one more thing. Could you do, ma'am, one more thing. Put my a** in a vice. Could you just clamp down on my a** and squeeze them till they come out of the hole in my head that used to have an eye? Colombo, don't you have to go arrest Martin Landau? I was in a series once with Martin Landau, and after the show, after the shoot, as they call it, I jammed my fist so far up his a**, I actually pulled out his prostate. It was wonderful. We used to film at Universal Studios, and we all get together in the commissary and pound each other's a** with the zucchini. I can't take this. Obi and Anthony. When that happens sometimes, it leaves a chafing. I start itching and chafing under my nut sack. It's horrible. And then my hemorrhoid to hang like melted moose of L.T. He's still at it. The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. On the way, we got some SCP and Kenny Wayne Shepard. It's Obi and Anthony. Just in case you're keeping track at home, the fan has answered our 20 of discussing the play from last night. They're up to hour 20. That's interesting. I don't even think it happened 20 hours ago. They started discussing the play before it actually happened, I do believe. Am I on the air, sir Ben? Yeah, what do you got? I'd like to discuss the play. I think Tino made a bad call. What do you mean? I think the umpire made a bad call. Oh, okay. Alright, thank you. Yeah, that was good. Thanks for the insight. I got an opinion on the thing. Yeah, do you have a different angle though? We've been discussing this play for 20 hours. What could you possibly add to this discussion today? I think it sucked. The ball hit the guy's back. And you know, it sucked for the Yankees. Alright, thank you. I appreciate that. Let's get another call in here. Hey, how are you doing? Pretty good, what's up? I have an insight, something that hasn't been discussed yet. With the play? Yeah, I think so. Okay, let's hear it. Boy, I think Chuck screwed up. You know, he just stood there while the guy ran about on the bases. Yeah, what can I say? He had a brain fart, you know? I got another opinion on this whole thing. Alright. I think it sucks. Okay, very good. I'm a big Yankee fan. I think we have time for one more call in this segment. Hello? Hello? I got an opinion. Okay, what is your opinion? What could you add to the discussion? Pretty much sucks. I'm a big Yankee fan. I think Chuck screwed up. I had the ball sitting right there and he didn't throw it. Okay, that's good. We've, yeah, we worked that angle for three hours today. And it continues. Yes, it continues. There's a couple people calling going, they're pretty psyched about last night's play because they hold in their hand tickets for game six at the stadium. So, yeah, it's like a gamble. So now they, you know, they want to go back to the stadium for game six, obviously. That's why they did it. Alright. You know what? We got to say hi to everyone. We met last night at the Mellon Camp thing at Tower Records. It was a huge success and it was really cool to see a lot of the listeners of N.E.W. A lot of people, yeah. A lot of people. Got to thank the promotional staff here at N.E.W. They did a flawless job. The whole event went off without a hitch. Got to hear Mellon Camp live on the radio yesterday. That was neat. If we can only have them do such a fine job when we broadcast live from the giant pop card. No, I think we're past that. Thank God. But we got to thank like Roger and Christina and Ben and the rest of the gang. They really worked their asses off to make that happen yesterday. Had a lot of fun. I got a fax here from Quasi. Hey, O&A, I've finally seen what you guys look like in person when I came out to Tower Records yesterday. Opie looks like he wears makeup. Oh, come on. Makeup? Makeup. And Anthony looks like he should be covered under Megan's law. But other than that, you guys rock. It's Quasi. I don't think I'm a child molester. Is that what he meant? I don't look like I wear makeup, do I? I don't know. Well, thanks, I guess. We're like the Hall and Oates of radio. Yeah, we are pretty much. We want to get out there a lot. Our whole goal is to get out on the streets as much as possible. We finally got the first event under our belt yesterday. It felt good. But I think the next time we're out and about, Anthony, it's got to include beer. Our listeners and beer. We had a few people offering yesterday, but obviously we can't drink while we're broadcasting from Tower Records. Well, we just can't let the boss see us drinking is the deal on that. But thanks to everyone who came out, Sir. So that was good. And I think we got the live songs. We recorded them yesterday. So maybe we'll sneak in one of the songs you did at Tower later on in the show. OK. And if you got something to add, 212-957-WNEW. How's the instant feedback today? Pumping in. Hot and heavy. Hot and heavy? Yeah. All right, cool. We'll read some of that in a bit, too. 1027-WNEW, the rock of New York, Stone Temple Pilots, interstate love song. And so be it, Anthony. Our pal, Stock Broker Dave, has got a little fan club here, Anthony. Yeah, I see. Getting a lot of faxes for Stock Broker Dave. Let me read a few of these really, really fast. Dear ONA, we just want you to know that we are officially new listeners. We've started listening to you guys every day ever since the first time we heard Stock Broker Dave on your show. We work for a Wall Street firm and we all got a kick out of him, especially when he declared the stock market blows. And then his call about the Dow hitting 7,500. He was right on. People up and down Wall Street are starting to keep their radios tuned to WNEW. Very cool. Great. Real fast from John, it looks like. Stock Broker Dave, great call on the 7,500. You made a lot of money for me. Keep up the good work. We're listening for the next call, Stock Broker Dave. You're the greatest. Look at that. Dear Opinac, I'm factoring you to express my appreciation for your inviting Stock Broker Dave to appear on your program. He seems to be right on with his picks and his predictions. I'm thinking of firing my broker. Thank you, Stock Broker Dave. If you weren't listening, he pretty much predicted that the market would go down to 7,500. That was what? Two weeks ago he said, right? Yes, he did. Yeah. And today, man, it was a mess earlier. It was like 270 points down and it closed like just under 10 points. Yeah, it made a rally at the end there. So I can like 77, 31. There you go. But yesterday on our show, when we were at Tower Records, Dave stopped by and he went on the radio and said that the market is going to 6,000. Now he's saying 6,000. He's been right every time so far. 6,000. I wish I had the nuts to actually follow him, you know, some of his little advice. And you wish you had the money. That too. You need the money to... Well, we're heavy into the market, me and Al, but we got like 10, 20 bucks in there. There you go. We actually lost a lot of money today. Our stock went down another two points today. We kind of lost $3.75. Our stock went from 25 last week to what is it today? 13 something? 14. 14. 14 million. We're a mess. It's the world. Yeah. The world is... Because the company that we own stock in says nothing's wrong. statement going, we don't have a clue as to why the stock dropped like 10 points in like a week and a half. But it's just the world right now. Russia is a mess. Asia is a mess. And no one knows when it's going to clear up. They're starting to hint at a recession. I went crazy using that word. That's what they're hinting at. You're the media. You can start a frenzy, Opie. Stop it. And Alan Greenspan. He better get some... He needs some... He needs some strange... Get him out there with a smile on his face saying everything is grand. I mean, don't kid yourself. Alan Greenspan is the most powerful man in the world. When he talks, people listen. He hints at things and the market either goes up or down. So me and Anthony figure if we could get him some Vietnamese hookers and get him enough, we'll all be okay. The world economy will be okay. He says the outlook for 1999 for the U.S. economy has weakened measurably. Oof. And maybe he's talking about his sex life has weakened measurably and he needs some help. Maybe that's what he's hinting at. Maybe he needs us to bus in the hookers for him. Boy, that'd be an expensive hooker. Can you imagine being his pal? Yeah, I would love to be. He gets some inside scoopage. You would get the best inside scoop. Because everyone who plays the market has their tips. It's pretty funny. I like what he says too. He describes the economy as very fluid and voiced concerns about what he called this whole looming sort of somewhat scary psychology. Yeah, he never nails it. He kind of just hints and kind of hangs around an issue. He's like the, what was that, Kane on Kung Fu. You know when he went to the master, he never got a direct answer. He's one of those, well how do I handle this problem? You will know when the time comes. It's like hey wise one, tell me now. Tell me exactly when the time is coming so I can prepare. You will know. This guy is like very strange, like the man on the mountain. Yeah, he comes down, he says some stuff and everyone screws everything up. Exactly, but there you go. We'll be fine. So congrats to stockbroker Dave once again and because of his prediction I think he's taking us out to dinner which is pretty cool. He isn't the guy that he bet. That's what I mean. Because stockbroker Dave went on the radio and said the market is going to $7,500. Another stockbroker called and said if it goes down to $7,500 I'm taking stockbroker Dave and you guys out to Din Din. That's it, a nice Din Din. We win. We do win this time around. So, alright, on the way we got some great rock and roll. Well I can't tease that song because that means something. I could tell you Sheryl Crow is on the way. Alright, and some Van Halen, stay there. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Sheryl Crow, my favorite mistake. She'll be in the imaginary ballroom Monday with you and I Anthony. That's going to be very cool. R.E.M. before that, that was the song you had to be listening for to win a pair of tickets to a special acoustic performance by Sheryl Crow. That's going to be happening somewhere else by the way. We'll give you details in a bit. Who's this hour's winner Rick? That's Mike Verone from Verona, New Jersey. Congratulations Mike. Next hour you've got to be listening for Joe Walsh's Life's Been Good to Me So Far. When you hear that be the 10th caller, 212-757-1027 and you'll score some tickets to 727. Sheryl Crow. Alright, we've got to start a new feature on the Open Anthony show right now. It's called Asshole of the Day. Okay. And people have been voting. And it was very close by the way. Pretty easy though. We've got the runner up, A Hole of the Day. It's flat out the story of the day. Headline of the Daily News, CABBY, I'll call it quits, three accidents on second day in job. Nice. Let me read a little of this. A taxi driver who got into two accidents and mowed down a pedestrian during his second day on the job has made a wise decision. He's decided to find another line of work. I don't want to continue with this job if I don't have to. A shaky Mohammed Rahman said yesterday, uttering words, sure to let city drivers and pedestrians rest a little easier. Check this out. After a night in jail, the Bangladesh immigrant blamed Tuesday's unprecedented string of accidents. He had two crashes and struck a pedestrian 48 hours into his taxi driving career on an unlucky combination of confusion and stress. Now the alleged one-man road menace began a shift driving for team systems of Long Island City, Queens at 6 a.m. Tuesday. According to police at 930 a.m., he ran the car parked at 6th Avenue. Rahman said the car hit his cab and he even flagged the cop and made out a report. An hour later, Rahman said he paused for a red light at 20th Street and Broadway. He said he got nervous when the light changed and cars honked while he waited for pedestrians to cross. I got confused and my feet just slipped from the brake to the accelerator, Rahman said. That's when he struck 22-year-old Akin Smith of Jersey City, who is now in Bellevue Hospital in serious condition. I mean, that's not funny, actually, but. The cop said Rahman fled the scene, but the cabbie insisted he was looking for a parking place so he could check on Smith. Unfortunately, that's when he ran into another car. I got confused, he said during an interview at his Ocean Parkway Brooklyn apartment. There was no way to stop the car on the street and I was trying to spot a parking space when I accidentally hit the other car. Police arrived, charged Rahman with leaving the scene of the accident and jailed him. He was sprung on $500 bail and he has decided to quit his lovely job as a taxi driver. Wow, man. But he was the runner-up for the A-hole of the day. Anthony, who was today's asshole of the day? Well, Opie, he's on the cover of all the papers. Come on, Chuck. 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. Tom Petty in there and Sean Mullins live in the Imaginary Ballroom. He was in here a couple days ago with Carol Miller. Sounded great. That's Lullaby that you heard a little while ago. Don't forget, coming Monday, we got Sheryl Crow in the Imaginary Ballroom and then Willie Nelson also next week stopping by for a little visit. It's going to be interesting. I think that's going to be very cool. So if you want to fax your questions to Sheryl Crow, you could do that today. We'll start collecting them because we like to get the listeners involved in our show. The fax line here is 212-957-WNEW. Also, make sure you're listening a little later this hour for Joe Walsh's Life's Been Good. When you hear that, be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027 and you'll win tickets to a special acoustic performance by Sheryl Crow with details on the way about that. All right? Good. And some feedback doing all right, Anthony? Yeah, well, G. Groenert from Elmont. My name is G. Groenert and I think you guys are the worst thing to hit the radio since the last time my great-great-grandmother got laid. Hmm. Okay, that hurt. So I see he's trying to be funny.

a little weird i don't know i'm going to there you go a little visit from dice and tower records last night hi anyw yeah hi i was wondering if anybody saw the chuck knoblock play last night in the yankee game because i don't know i've been hearing about it but i can't find a replay anywhere such a sarcasm i think just a little bit i'm i i tell you what i'm a huge yankee fan but i'm a little tired of hearing it hoping anthony loves sarcasm remember that well we love you guys are great we live for sarcasm and by the way the fan is in hour 21 of discussing the play yeah i like to talk about that play as a matter of fact i think i got a complete new spin on the whole thing um chuck uh now i think he should have probably picked the ball up when it was laying there and he was pointing maybe the better thing would have been to throw the ball then they would have lost three one instead of four one i don't think anybody has hit on this yet so i think i'm the first actually you got a good point you should call a radio station with that thank you have a good night all right man take care thank you uh hello is this is this wfin yeah what's up yeah i'm a long time listener first time caller cool what's up i want to comment on the yankee play yeah because i haven't really heard you talk about it all day um you know that guy chuck knoblock yeah we all know him today he's on the front page of every paper did anyone notice uh was it just me that he kind of blew a play i don't know if anyone picked up on this but he should have probably thrown that ball huh yeah i am we're we're in agreement there sir yeah well thank you okay uh is this the fan uh yes what's up i got a whole new take on it okay um i'd like to use uh check knoblock's name in a sentence okay let's hear that um before i got a spank on in the bathroom i turned the knoblock so my mother can't come in and catch me at least that's something no one said yet oh okay well thanks for calling the fan this

tired of channel surfing and not finding anything worth listening to but now she plans her driving around our show bravo thank you bravo donna thank you donna thank you we appreciate that she was listening tuesday night when you were talking about scott so driving out of the parking garage the wrong way and had tears in my eyes laughing so hard she liked that huh well it was it was a pretty bizarre scene actually actually scott tried to explain it to us the other day yeah in our little office what happened was i was coming in to work tuesday and um i was going down the ramp at the parking garage i usually park in and next thing i know i mean it's definitely a one-way i mean you go you go down the ramp here you don't go up this ramp absolutely and uh i'm ready to pull in it's so busy out there there's cars behind me there's buses trying to pull over it's just a nightmare you just got to get in real fast and there's scotso in his car at the top of the ramp trying to make a right i didn't realize it was scotso so i'm starting to honk and i'm getting ready for some good road rage where i was going to just let the four-letter words go flying and just as the first like you mother i realized it was scott so i'm like oh man so then i quickly backed up into traffic to let him out and he just like do do do do and drove out of the parking garage the wrong way oh my georgie roadhog out of the way so he came to our office the other day to explain why he he goes that way and i still don't understand why he does that well he said um well yeah i came in this way i gotta get out this way right but there's a different way to get out yeah a two lane uh one way down and one way up right and this is not it no this is definitely only in yes not an out tunnel no but he yeah for some reason thought yeah this is okay this isn't a bisexual parking garage no it's one way there's only one way in and there's only one way out think of it back when i first started here at n.e.w it was a dirt path once i got out of the garage covered wagons so he insists because he's been you know parking at that garage for 40 years that he'll just leave him anyway he wants he don't care he don't care yeah that's it i'm just worried he's gonna get in i had on collision because it's a nasty curve as you get out of there too yeah you know and you know what we do we just tool down i know we try to see how fast we could go down it and cut the turn before we hit the wall yeah that's fun little game it is a fun game it preoccupies our time as we uh out of my way whippersnapper oh my georgie magoo you've done it again that car there it's one way by georgie out of the way one side you whippersnapper magoo it's a one-way road magoo all right on the way we got we got you too man and a lot of
