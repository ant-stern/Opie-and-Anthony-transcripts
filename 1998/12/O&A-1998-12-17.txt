 I hope I get a Monica I'm this happy Hanukkah The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW What's that? What was that in the CD player? Hey man Ralph DeTore ended his show with the Hanukkah song he's new here what am I gonna do Beat him up already? I hate that It's his first week we gotta let it slide if he plays next week though we're gonna beat him up Alright what's up man? How much? How you doing? You watch any of the war today? The war show on CNN? Yeah it's kinda boring. Yeah It's typical Clinton. You know when Bush was in office the war show was good the sequel isn't panning out as good as the original Well you know sequels are never as good as the original. I know well except for Godfather 2 Right that was very good. Alright but George 2, the lethal weapons after the first one The Gulf War, the war show I don't know I like the original one where they showed the the same infrared camera bagged out with the big penis building They're still standing by the way. I guess there's no weapons inside the penis building I guess not. That's probably where Saddam's hiding He makes it through every attack the big penis building. Just take out the penis building and you'll find Saddam Yeah Saddam's in the big penis building. But you saw the big penis building and all the bright flashes during the first war show and now it's like you know well there you have it another raid. Well know why? Because precision bombing Well we had that back then too. But now we're saying we're even more accurate than back in 1991 Yeah. But Saddam just doesn't have the stuff anymore I don't think. He doesn't have as much anti-aircraft weapons. He doesn't have the surface-to-air missiles he did during the first one and he was all stocked up. What about the Scuds? Scuds. I heard there's like one Scud left in the back of an old Iraqi U-Haul. They're trying to move around the desert on two flat tires So the Scud capability Israel bracing for a possible Scud attack. Yeah. I don't think so. One of the best lines about the Gulf War back in 1991 was from Sam Kinison. He was talking about the Iraqi technology. And he says that the Iraqis, they blow off these Scud missiles and then they turn on CNN to see where they land it and where they hit. That's their technology. Of course. It's so true. Ridiculous. But now Congress is getting together. They're going to go ahead with the impeachment vote. Well that lasted for a day. That helped out Bill. Kept the impeachment from being voted on today. But yeah it's going to go ahead. They're going to have some arguments tomorrow and then the vote on Saturday it looks like. I don't know where Bill's going with this. Where is Clinton going with this bombing raid? He's going to stop short once again. And what's the follow-up here? Do you make the full commitment that we are not leaving until Saddam is removed from the leadership of Iraq? Well that's what he's been saying today. Well how are you going to do that? Good question. And then he's talking about not bombing during the Islamic holy days. Which is 40 days. Yeah that are coming up. Why can't we bomb during that? It's war for God's sake. Right. Holy days don't count in war. That's why it's war. There's no rules. Right. Make the commitment. Well he says he's going to make the commitment but can we really believe anything he says at this time? No. President Weiner. That's the problem. That's all I see when he's on TV. And we have to show Saddam Hussein that. And I'm just like my Weiner. My Weiner. Hey it's my Weiner. All right well we're ready to rock today. We're not going to bitch as much as we did yesterday. Got a bunch of complaints from the faithful listeners. I'll screw them. I'll bitch if I want. I kind of like when we bitch. There was plenty to bitch about yesterday. That's true. We have fun too. Why not? We did have some fun. Lighten up on our bitching. The Clinton Christmas songs were hysterical. Very fun. We'll be playing those today. We're getting so many requests for the grandma got run over by a reindeer song from the demand world CD. Not the original of course. No we want to hear that crap. And everyone wants a copy of it. So let me look at the clock here. We'll play it in the four o'clock hour. How's that? Then you could tape it. Yes. Oh we're back to infrared camera of Baghdad. Baghdad live 11 18 p.m. It just looks green. Yeah there's just a lot of smoke and stuff and going on. Come on. They can't pull this off and make it look as good as the last one. All right. Well we'll keep you updated. If I was somebody in Baghdad knowing that CNN is showing all this I would fire off a bunch of bottle rockets out of my window just to make it look good. Here we go. Fax line 212-957-WNEW. The instant feedback is all set and ready to go. If you're online drop us a note. Just go to the WNEW website and click on our baby pictures and you go from there. OK. On the way we got some ZZ tops and Stone Temple pilots and Kenny Wayne Shepherd next. Anthony I got our first facts of the show today. All right. Says two words pork man. A little more specific please. All right. Here's Kenny Wayne Shepherd. This is Blue on Black. The Rock of New York 1027-WNEW interstate love song from Stone Temple pilots. Don't forget beginning tomorrow and all weekend we've got the latest box set from the Black Crows. Plus we got a chance for you to fly to Atlanta to see them live. The winning starts tomorrow at 10 a.m. on that one. OK. Oh I got instant feedback here from Josh and he says I wish I could have taken a bet yesterday when Anthony said at least one major newspaper would have a picture of the penis building from Baghdad. Needless to say no penis pictures. Well I know the picture on the let me see which one. I got Newsday but it's it's kind of dark. It's too dark is the problem. I think that's the penis building in the background. You know I got to be honest. I don't think it is really. What about the daily news. Yeah. Where's the daily news. Do you have it over there. Yeah I got it over here. Take a look because I can't believe that one paper at least didn't put the penis building on the cover. What's wrong with these papers. The universal signal of Baghdad is the penis building. No the post the post really blew. What is that supposed to be. What is that. Do you. It's just black. Yeah. It's supposed to be a picture of the city in the back there. It's supposed to be the penis building. That's what I'm saying. Well Josh you're right. OK. All right. Josh I blew it again. So we didn't call that one. Wow. My bets. I lost a bet. We were the only radio station in New York that called the bombing yesterday to the hour. Everyone else is doing their music sweeps and giving away Furby dolls and we went on the air and said that we're bombing Baghdad within the hour. That's right. One guy writes us an instant feedback and says man where do you guys get your information from the CIA. I mean we all knew that it was it was you know that it was going to happen. Of course. But we put our necks on the line. Oh sure. That's that really put our neck on the line. And the journalists that we are. Yeah we don't want to come out with something that isn't really going to happen. No. Yeah. Yeah we wouldn't do that. All right. On the way we got Metallica doing turn the page and some zeppelin to one oh two seven W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W.

All right, what are we doing here? I think we can play some more rock and roll for you guys. Yeah, let's rock. It's a rocking day. Yes it is. Anthony? Yes? I've got a question for you. Okay. What is Pepsi One, Anthony? Opie, it's a one calorie cola that doesn't taste like a diet cola. You've got to be kidding. I am not. Would I kid you? You've never kid me in the past. That's right. Okay, Pepsi One. Who is it for, Anthony? Okay. Anyone who views diet cola as a compromise. Now what do you mean by that? I mean, say you have to lose some weight. Maybe. You can't drink sweetened cola. It's cola sweetened with sugar. So you go to a diet. And what happens? You're compromising. Because they taste like crap. Then you turn to Pepsi One. It's got a brand new sweetener. What does it taste like? It tastes pretty damn good. It tastes like cola. I was pretty surprised that it's a diet cola. You can drink it without thinking, oh, I'm drinking something with one calorie. Okay. Where do they get Pepsi One, Anthony? Anywhere. Every store. You'll find that, really. Let me put it in terms you can understand. If you're a fat slob that's got to lose weight, or if you're just a skinny guy or skinny gal that wants a good tasting cola with one calorie, that's it. Try Pepsi One. Pepsi One. It's Pepsi One, everyone. The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW Live Rush. The spirit of radio. It's Opie and Anthony. Want to send a fax today. 2 on 2957 WNEW. We're getting some good ones today, Anthony. This one reads, Drop a scud missile on Opie and Anthony. Drop a scud missile on Opie and Anthony. Rebuild WNEW with Dave Herman and Scott Muni. Rebuild? Rebuild. That's kind of impossible. The changes that have taken place at NEW are a big mistake. Like my Rock and Jocks, the old fashioned way. They can be old fashioned way. A long time listener and he's got long. Underlined a lot. He's a real long time listener. I guess so. Well don't worry, you've got only a few weeks and then you can listen to the Scott Muni siesta on 2104. That'll be a lot of fun and exciting radio. Sure. And I'm sure they'll probably hire Dave Herman soon. They're hiring all the husbands over there. Let's see, Opie and Anthony, guess what I heard? What are you laughing at? You. Just tell me. Of course. Opie and Anthony, guess what I heard? Hillary Clinton's gay. You always see her with that dark haired lady. That's the word around town. Have a good day, Bonnie. That dark haired lady? Who's the dark haired lady? I don't know who that is. Let's try this one. Can you please wish my girlfriend Gail Rudolph a happy birthday? She's a big fan of the show. She listens between three and five. No, we cannot do that. That's great. That's our faxes today. Keep them coming. Hey, you know what I hear though? I hear you're getting a new mailbox. Yeah, yeah. When we first came here to N.E.W., we had the mailboxes way at the bottom because obviously they had the older staff here for many years and they had rated to get the top mailboxes in the mail room. That's what goes on around here. Instead of doing good radio, it's how long you've been in the building. So if you've been in the building 30 years, you get the big mailbox that fits a lot of stuff. So I moved up to the big mailboxes I think a month ago. Now you, Opie, are getting the Muni mailbox. Yeah! You have just been informed that you are getting the Muni mailbox. Now where is the Muni mailbox? In the mail room. Okay. I'm going to have to maybe go in there and see what's in there for you. Well, we've got to empty out his mailbox. Yeah, we'll empty it out. We'll take over his mailbox. And maybe do a little exorcism. I feel honored to have his mailbox. All right. Cool. Then we'll have to investigate what's in there. Is there a phone in the mail room? Yeah. All right. We'll call from the mail room and see what's in his mailbox. Okay. Also, I'm hearing rumors that Lamb Chop might be calling in tonight. Yeah. Lamb Chop, I think, is calling in to plug some Hanukkah special that's on Channel 13 tonight. All right. We haven't heard from Lamb Chop in a while. No. That should be fun. Hanukkah special. Yeah. Okay. And also a lot of people calling in for the Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer song, the demented version from our CD, Opie and Anthony's Demanded World. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people still having a hard time finding that CD and time. It's a holiday. I don't blame you. So what we're going to do is we're going to play it in about 15 minutes so you can get a tape of it and play it for your family and friends. Okay? Very good. So if you've been patiently waiting to tape that, stick around. Hey, are you still searching for the ultimate holiday gift? Are you? Hmm. Well, look no further. It's a monthly cigar membership from Cigars Around the World, the original Cigar of the Month Club. It's a perfect gift idea for the cigar aficionado in your house. Yeah. This is very cool.

Cigar accessories. Well, you can give them a call for that as well. Oh, they have that too? They sure do. Ha. Well, tell me about it. Well, they've got the cigar cutters and the humidor and whatever else here. What else? And the card. Yeah, a card comes with it Anthony. All right. Oh, you threw me off here. My God.

And we're also giving away a trip to see the Black Crows in Atlanta. The winning starts tomorrow at 10. Ben, what are you bringing in? Hey Ben. How you been man? Everyone wants to know how Ben the Fag is doing. I swear to God, we're getting so many calls about Ben the Fag. Yeah. Not a fag. What are you bringing in? It's not a fag. I don't know. Oh my God, wait, it's a package from our agent. Oh. Is it really? Yeah. So, this time we've got the job here. So, have you gone home with any transvestites lately? Yeah. Transsexuals. Transsexuals? I'm sorry. That's right. They still have their penis. You opened your package? What are you crazy? All right. Hey, look at that. Yeah. 10% of my pay and I get pretzels and popcorn. Thanks. No really, Ben. That's great. A gift package. Oh, wait, there's gummy candy in here too. That's cute. That must have cost $250. Thanks. Thanks for the effort. Thank you. Appreciate it. Now pick up the phone and give us a call. All right. What were we going to talk about? Now I forget. Oh, we've got to play the Grandma song here. Everyone is sitting by. They want to get a tape of this, Anthony. All right. See, the agent could help us distribute our Demanded World series. Because obviously our record company has decided to blow us off. Oh, of course. See, an agent will put the heat on and get things done for you and I. Too busy getting together these gift packages. Cropcorn and pretzels. I don't know. There's something in there. All right. Well, thanks. Anyway, a little Christmas ditty. I've got to give my brother credit for this one. Yes. Can't take it. Brother Joe wrote this. Yeah. I was going to talk about Grandma's real fast. I'm going to give you a little bit of a hint. I'm going to give you a hint. I'm going to give you a hint. I'm going to give you a hint. I'm going to give you a hint. I'm going to give you a hint. Just give me just a minute. I mean, I love my grandma, but aside from a holiday, when you go over there, what are you going to go over there to talk about? Not much. You can sit down high, how you doing? But my grandma's cool. Last year, she has 30 grandkids and I don't know, about six or seven great grandkids. She gave us all lottery tickets last year. Oh really? Now that's a cool gift, right? Instead of a stupid pair of gloves or something that you're never going to use. What? Yeah, but my grandma's cool. Oh, no, my grandma's cool. Hell yeah, she's cool. It's like the girls that talk about their cats. My cat's different than every other cat. No, honey, it's still a cat. No man. It's like, oh, my grandma still goes to Atlantic City and gambles. She's 88 years old. She's still cool, I'm telling you. She shows up at our Christmas party with a t-shirt that says, Grandma got run over by a reindeer and there's like a hoof print up her whole body and stuff. She's got a sense of humor. Come on, she's 88, she's trying. I get it. She's trying it. She's still asking how, you know, junior high is? No, she's pretty with it. I got a few ants that get my information all wrong. So how's Buffalo? Buffalo, turn on your radio. I'm on in New York now. Still going out with that girl, Christine? No, dumped that bitch about five girls ago. Hey, how's that Honda Accord? You just bought that, right? No, I bought that in 1986. I remember my grandma on my father's side, God rest her soul, she's not with us any longer, Opie. But me and my brother had to be in our early 20s and she's giving us Christmas presents, little marionettes. She would bring us things like we were eight frigging years old. It's just, oh God, why bother? That's pretty cool. No, it's not. It's sad. It's just sad. So what do you do with the gifts after you leave the party? I don't know, you just put them in the closet. It's embarrassing when you open it up and it's like, oh gee, you could, you know, play with each other. I got some relatives I see every year. I say one thing to them, hey man, can you move your car? I got to go. You're blocking me in. That's about all I say to them. We all get together and stuff and I see them once a year, but also I was like, hey man, we're leaving, can you move your car? Yeah, there's a couple of those. That's the truth though. All right, so you want to play this thing? Yeah, yeah, it's a little ditty. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Kiss from Psycho Circus. You wanted the best. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey, on the way today, we got our pal Red Peters coming in. Yeah. We haven't had him on the air down here yet. No, a very good friend of ours when we were at another station. Yeah, we've known him for a bunch of years. He's the guy that does How's Your Hole? Yeah. Family. That's the guy. And I think he's going to do that live for us today and I think he's also going to do his Christmas song, Holy Ass It's Christmas. All right. So please stick around for Red Peters. Who's bringing him in? Someone from our record label because we're both on the same record label. Yeah. You can find Red's CD in all the stores. Right. You can't really find Opie, Anthony's, and MetaWorld in all the stores yet. We'll see. We'll have to talk to them about that. I don't think they're brave enough to send the big boys. No? No, it'll probably be like a restaurant records lackey or something. Damn. So we won't be able to confront them on why our CD isn't in the record stores once again. I thought they were all lackeys. Well, Red Peters calls the owner of Restaurant Records, Owen Money. And we always thought it was just like a cute little joke. Hey, I thought that was a joke. Hey, Red, come in here. Come here. He's in the hallway. Oh, is he here? Yeah. Come on. Come in, Red. Hey, how you been? What's up, brother? Look at Joe. All right. Hey, Red, what kind of T-shirts you got? I've been lugging these around for a day and a half. They got Opie Anthony's MetaWorld T-shirts. How you been? Where's the representatives of Restaurant Records? They're stuck in traffic. Hey, Red. I know they're not stuck at the bank withdrawing money to give us. Red, why do you have a T-shirt? Why do you have name tags? Well, we're Visitors. Visitors? Get out of here. They gave you tags. Visitors. They're making you put name tags on. Opie Anthony. Visitor. This Iraqi crisis is getting a little out of hand. Oh, is that what it is? That you've got to put name tags on. Do you get strip searched? You've got strip searched, Red. Did they give you the pipe? The lady at the front desk with the plastic gloves. The gloves? Really? I didn't mind, but the lady kind of... Hey, Red, we were just talking about the owner of Restaurant Records and what you call him. Owen Money? Yeah, there it is. See, we thought that was a joke for all those years. I don't know what's going on, but he was supposed to be with us. He says he's going to be here. He's not going to make it. We thought that was the funniest thing when you called him Owen Money right up until the time we were under contract with him, under a recording contract. Well, you guys can get the subtle hint, you know? You were calling him Owen Money for years and then we're like, that's really funny. Yeah, but hey, look, you get the t-shirts, didn't you? Yeah, we got t-shirts. Yeah, that's true. All right. Yeah, he gives us some t-shirts. I'll hold you over for a couple of days. Well, Red, what are you going to do on the show today, man? I don't know. I'm going to rest for a minute. You know, we got lost on the way here and I'm going to go through my bag and see what I can dig out. All right, we'll give him some time. We'll give him some time. Actually, let's play his track off our Dementor World CD. He contributed a track to our CD, Anthony. We felt honored. Babe Marino, right? Yeah. This is his auto dealership. That's where he did the ad for his dealership. Babe's here right now. All right, Zopey, it's Anthony and Dred Peters, who's enjoying our gallery magazine. Yes, indeed. We only put out the best for our guests. I don't usually see this sort of thing in my travels, you know? I'm doing the, I've been asked to do the Lilith there, but I don't know if I'm going to do it or not. But some of the Christian rockers want me to do something, you know, sort of alternative. Oh, really? Yeah, sure they do. Sort of, I don't know what they're trying to prove, but. Somehow I can't picture that one. So, but you can with the Lilith there? Yeah, yeah, why not? Yeah. As you thumb through galleries girl next door issue. Yeah, well, I mean, that's just, I was reading the stories. Roast beef issue. Well, this is going to be very exciting. Red in a little while is going to sing a few songs for us. A lot of favorites on our program. He's going to do How's Your Whole Family Live for us. You're going to do Holy Essence Christmas today, Red? If I can find one here that has the S word bleeped, but I'm not sure if it's bleeped or not. All right, we'll figure that out. I want to scream with that word. Say something else. And then he's going to do the Blow Me Song as well. Well, another favorite on our show. For our president, I guess that Tom Brokenshire called up and requested it, didn't he? That's one of my favorite songs, Tom Brokenshire, MBC Nightly News, live from Bagdad. Tom, wake up, man. The hardest thing in my broadcasting career ever to say was the Achilles' heel. Why the hell couldn't they be on the Queen and Mary? It had to be the Achilles' heel. All right, stick around for the mess to continue. 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York. Tom Cochran, Life is a Highway. It's Opi and Anthony and our pal Red Peters in the studio today. Right here with the Rock Buffet. You know what it is? Well, what do you mean, Red? What are you talking about? You know, I'm pretty hip to the format. What's this format? This is classic hard rock, right? Is that what it is? No, you were right the first time. It's kind of like the rock and roll buffet. Rock and roll buffet. I like that. Yeah, you know how it is when you go to a buffet. It's a lot to choose from, a lot to pick. You pass by certain stuff. You personally might think it stinks. But then the next thing smells pretty good and you eat it. But the next guy might think what you thought didn't taste good was pretty good. Right. Are we still talking about the same thing? We've got to get new liners for the station. 1027 WNEW, The Rock Buffet of New York. The Rock Buffet of New York. That's a good way to explain it again. Well, Red, we're still trying to figure out the music. How's that for an answer? I think you're doing a great job doing that. Okay. And the contribution you make, the easy part is exemplified by your presence, you know, the standing there talking to you. Well, thank you, Red. What the hell did he just say, Anthony? I think it was a compliment. Okay, well, it was definitely a compliment. Well, thank you. Well, we play a lot of tracks off your CD. I laughed, I cried, I fudged my undies. Appreciate the spin, fellas. Congratulations. You could actually find your CD in the record stores. We're on the same label. Yeah, we're on the same label. But for some reason, your records are in the stores and ours are not. Well, look, let's just go back a little bit. All right. Don't you have the T-shirts we just brought over here? We got a bag of T-shirts. We got a bag of T-shirts. What are we going to do with all of Anthony's? The Better World T-shirts. I told him, I said, look, what can we do for these guys? I can't go there empty-handed. So you brought a bag of our T-shirts. Great. Yeah. I've been lugging them around for like a day and a half, you guys. That's good. Poor babe. No, really. You sell 60,000 CDs in Boston and we get T-shirts. Good. Yeah. So it's starting to pour in, the benefits. The benefits are definitely coming in now. Pouring in. Great. A little bit of light clothing. Right. Well, Red, you ready to sing a number for us here? Gee, I'd love to. All right. You're going to do How's Your Whole Family Live? Sure. Is that even possible? I'm going to try. I haven't sung yet today, but I think I can do it. Okay. Sure. The band is all set up in the corner here. There we go. Are you ready there, Red? I don't want to. Whenever you're ready, Chief. Oh, how's your whole? Fine, Red. Family, how's your whole? Family, how's your whole? Family, how's your whole? Family, how's your whole? Family, how's your whole? Family, how's your whole?

How's your whole family? How's your whole family? How is your whole family? How's your whole family? Wow, there you go. All right, Red. Red Peters live in the studio today, obviously. Off the CD, I Laugh, I Cry, I Pudge, my undies. That's the How's your whole family song. What line? Line five has a question for Red. All right. Hello. Hello, hello, hello. I'm going to beat my children because you played that sport again. What's the problem with the song? Well, you obviously impacted on someone's life through your music. If the kid can just forgive me, this is not the reason why I sang it, to see an innocent child get beaten. Hi, NW. You touched somebody. Hopey, owing money. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Hey, Owen, this is Red. What a time to be asking me how's my whole family? What happened? I got arrested. You got arrested? Yeah, I got one call and I'm calling you. Well, we're going to keep you in jail. Why? Huh? Why? Anthony and I want to know where our CDs are. Yeah, where's our CDs? Music Clan, Sam Goody, Tower Records. Where? Beirut? They can call 1-800-270-2299. They can get Red Peat and Hopey and Anthony. They can get a special. You got T-shirts there. We got the T-shirts. What's the phone number to order our CD and Red CD? 1-800-270-2299. If they act now, they can get it before Christmas. What's the marketing plan for the open Anthony Domain of World CD? Hold on, let me look here. No, but your sales, this was the biggest week you ever had in New York. How many? You sold 89 in New York this week. Wow! 89 in New York this week. And Red Peat sold, oh I'm sorry, can I say this over the air? Yeah, go ahead. Red Peat has sold 1,029. Wow, look at that. In New York? Yes, that's correct. We see who rates in the record company. Well, that's directly proportional to how many CDs are in the stores. Red, you go into a store, you go, where's Red Peat? The guy goes, oh right there, around that corner there in that section. No, no, no, that was sold just on the street corner in Manhattan. We would even be happy for that. All right, Owen, we got to get back to Red. Okay. Owen, you coming over or what? Call me. Call me. Oh, thanks, though. He's not coming over here. Oh, and money. If we see you, we'll honk as we drive by. All right, Red, you want to do the Blow Me song in a few minutes here? Sure I do. Have you ever performed the Blow Me song live on a radio station? Never, not since the last incident, you know. Is it easy access out of here for you? Oh yeah, pretty much. If we have to run? No problem. Well, radio stations get fined for playing the song. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. It's OPI, it's Anthony, and we're hanging with Red Peters this afternoon on the program. His CD is called I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies. We play like, I don't know, five or six tracks from this on a regular basis. Red? Yeah, that's what I've heard. I've heard through the grapevine. I appreciate it. Thank you. Big supporter of the Peter. Right on. Right on. I need all the help I can get. We've known Red for many years now, Red. Many years. As a matter of fact, remember a couple Christmases ago, I had that reunion with the New Christy Hamsters. Oh yes. In Boston at the station there. You know, you guys surprised me. You knew I was coming on around Christmastime. I come in, and who do I see? I see the three New Christy Hamsters there. Bruce, who was it? Bruce Godfrey in Raleigh. And I look at them and I went, oh, forget it. I got like, oh, I'm Sealeye and that's it. No, I'm not speaking of it. But you pulled it together like a professional. Hey Red, can we have the number of your dealer? You're seeing some good stuff, man. Where can I score some of that? You're seeing hamsters and stuff? No, no, no. You know my song, Holy Eek, It's Christmas with the New Christy Hamsters. Sure. And you know the premise of the song. I went in and they, they effed with my head. They taunted me. They would, you know, they were making fun of me. And you know, they, you know what I mean? I just don't like them. They bummed me out then. And I said I would never work with another animal act. And Oh and Money, listen to this. Oh and Money tried to get me to do a duet with Babe this last summer. I said, look, no, forget it. All right. So you sing songs with hamsters. That's kind of cute. Oh yeah. Maybe we can hear it later. We will play it a little later. Thank you. Right now you're going to do a song that'll probably get us fined, which is All Right by Us. It's good. Why not? Who cares? This, you may recall, I recorded this with the Alan Pinchelow singers. And in the great Babe Marino, singer, his orchestra and with the help of Alan Pinchelow. And it was actually the first, my first tune that I recorded, the first one that really took off for me. Okay. Really? So. Has a Frank Sinatra feel to it? It does. Right? Yeah. And he's the president. Of course. This is, I hear he plays this, you know, he used to before the Trouble. Okay. And now he can't get away with it. All right. Without further ado, it's Red Peters, everyone. This is very special to me. Hi, Dick. Hi, Bob. Pretty good, thanks. You too. Below me. You hardly even know me. Just set yourself below me and blow me tonight. My hand, it would certainly be dandy, but it's not enough to say no. Slow me. You gotta blow me. All right. When you part your lips that way. I want you night and day. When you squeeze my balls so tight. I wanna blow my load with all my might. So blow me. You hardly even know me. Just set yourself below me. You gotta blow me tonight. All right, everybody, come on. Blow me. You hardly even know me. So blow me. You gotta blow me. So blow me. Blow me tonight. Yeah. All right. Red Peters, everyone. Very good. Shall we both? Oh, my God. Well, look for somebody else here. Three to seven is on any W, starting tomorrow. Another song that will be banned from our radio program. Thank you, Red. Hey, did you see my word sheet here? Yeah. What do you got there? This is signed by John Wayne Bobbitt. Oh, it is, really? Wow, look at that. Red, don't lose your head. Sleep on your stomach. John Wayne Bobbitt. He made a little career of having his schlong cut off. Check this out. Look at that. Oh, and he puts a knife. He underlines his name with a knife. That's really his signature. I swear, yeah, it is. That's pretty cool. That's something. All right. That's the favorite of his show. I think Red has one more in him. I got one more in me. We'll do the Christmas song next, OK? Sure. It is the holiday season, Red. That would be fantastic. All right. Stick around for Red Peters. All right. More with Red Peters in just a bit. Everyone enjoyed that last one, Red. Hey, thanks. OK. It was good, man. We got to explain our new club to you. Yeah, now what's that all about? We'll explain in a few. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York Live, Pearl Jam, Elderly Woman, Behind the Counter in a Small Town, off there live on Two Legs CD. It's open, Anthony. And Red Peters in the studio, our pal. Yo. He's on the same record label as us. We feel privileged. He's the top gun at our label. Yeah, the Titanic label. We're all going down on it together. You have the flagship album on the label. Who else is on the label? Who else do we got? Actually, a very talented rhythm and blues singer. Glenn Jones. Glenn Jones. He's great. He's excellent. Who? Who's that? Who's that? Glenn Jones. Actually, he's very big down south. Did he have to be in Shana-Nah? Well, Red CD is called I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies. And unlike our CD, you can find his in the record store. Congratulations. I want to know what deal you made. Thank you. Thank you. Don't you need to plug a few things in? You know, pharmaceuticals? Remember? Remember? Pharmaceuticals. You know, you had the... Do you mind if we plug a couple of things? We can play for it. We need the money. All right, go ahead. You know, I have, you know, I have penis. The external penis remedy. Working on that. Working on that. No, because we're talking about the money. I'm trying, you know, make ends meet. Right, right. And we have from Rouge Pierre, it's called, it's a cologne called JHS. I told you about this, didn't I? No, no, no. It's sent JHS, short for Just Had Sex. It's a new man's cologne. It's going over real big. From Rouge Pierre. Yeah, from Rouge Pierre. And we got that, the Viagra stuff? No, super libido. Super libido, yeah. Yeah, super libido. It's like a Viagra type drug. Oh, really? It's a natural, natural stimulant. Okay, really? What's the difference? And you roll it and you smoke it. No, no, that's not... That's not it? No. This is in pill form. Oh, oh. See, I get my... You have to take it for a month. Unfortunately, I'm on anti-libido. Let's forget about the pharmaceutical thing. I'm mixing the products up. Which I do, which is easy to do. I don't know if that's ever happened to you. You know, you... You're like, 100 bucks out the window, right? Which is pill here and... Hey, Red, how high are you right now? You know, just normally. The normal amount. Yeah, you might remember hearing Red doing a lot of EasyWide or Rolling Papers ads on the radio. Right, right. There's a reason they picked him. I can say that. I was amazed that they picked me. I don't know why they picked me. But I was very, very excited. Really? You know, as you can imagine. Did they take care of you, huh? Yeah. Sitting there cleaning your weed and the phone just rang? You guys, you're getting T-shirts, which, you know, I have plenty, thanks. Yeah. But, you know, they pay me in, you know, papers and... Oh, that's fun. Lighters. Yeah, lighters. Zippo lighters and... Yeah, and things you can't use, like clothing. You know, just what I want. All right. You know, to... To be pulled over in. Yeah, to be pulled over, you know, you have an EasyWide hat on. Hey, officer, what's up, man? Officer, why the attitude? All the paraphernalia. What did I do? Hey, Red, we haven't talked to you in a while. Yes, sir. Did you hear about our new club we started? No, no, no. You know that Blow Me song you just played for us? Right. That's our theme song for our club. And where's the club? It's called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. And what is... Every Tuesday we encourage the ladies to give their man a little hummer. Hummer? Humming action, yeah. Do we have any of the stats come back yet on how successful you are? Very successful. I remember the Whip It Out Wednesday. The Whip It Out Wednesday? Oh, Ixnay on the Whip It Out Wednesday, eh? We'll have to explain that maybe when the weather gets a little nicer. Yeah, yeah. That was a good one. That was very successful. As a matter of fact, I still see people, you know... At the Wows and stuff? Sure. Cool. Watch me. Watch for that. Watch for that in the future if we're still here. But we notice a lot of people are miserable in their relationships. They've been married for 10, 20 years and the wife has... They both have kids now and the sex life goes down the toilet. So we just said, look, guys, when you go home, tell the women about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club and have them induct you as a member. And all of a sudden people started doing this all over the place. Really? They're doing it everywhere? Guys were happier and happier. And did you see that little point where the stock market went back up after that big dive? It was right when we introduced the Hummer Club. It brought optimism to everything. Which today? Thursday. That's what I thought. Anyway... But listen, seriously, we were saying today how happy people seemed in New York. See? That's the reason, Brad. Part of the reason, I think. Putting smiles on everyone's faces. That's fantastic. Well, you want to play the Holy Assets Christmas song here from I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies? Sure, why not? I mean, it is that time of year, right? Are we going to be looking at a follow-up CD coming out soon, Red? Yes. We're trying to clear up some legal problems right now. But once we do, we're very confident that we will in the next few weeks. We're going to begin working on a second album. We already have all the songs in our head. In your head? That's the only safe place for them right now. Because if they come out of our heads, then you know what happens. Alright, obligation. Alright, Anthony, Cigars Around the World, the original Cigar of the Month Club. Great gift idea for Christmas, Opie. Isn't it? Yes, it is. Do you know a cigar aficionado? I know a few. You do? Yeah. And wouldn't this be a good thing? I do believe it would be. And it's easy? You don't have to go to the mall and park your car, walk through those crowded stores. You can do this right from your house. Which is a pleasure, Anthony. Oh, please. For only $24.95 per month plus shipping, Cigars Around the World sends five fresh hand-rolled cigars sends you a newsletter, a free cigar cutter, gift card and more. The cool thing is if you don't have a lot of money or you do have a lot of money, they've got memberships that will suit your needs. Two to 12-month memberships available. Just call 1-800-Fresh-66. That number 1-800-Fresh-66 and they guarantee that your gift will be there in time for the holiday. Well, that's good. Alright. You don't want them getting there late. You want to wake up Christmas morning, unwrap your cigars, sit back and light one up. Light one up. There you go. Alright, stick around. We've got one more song from Red Peters on the way. And Red wants the number for that other sponsor, Red. Something about that came in late, something about hand-rolled something. No. No, it wasn't something about some hand-rolled gifts. No, it wasn't joints around the world, Red. Yeah, he thought he was going to get like hand-rolled fatties sent to him. No, doesn't work like that. Is that it? No. Oh, what a mess. 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York. It's Opie and Anthony and Red Peters and Eddie and the hamsters in the corner that Red is seeing as he visits with us today. I'll tell you, just hearing their voices again is sort of like an acid flashback. I'll tell you, I don't like, I don't know about you guys, I don't like getting embarrassed, you know what I mean? I have three little rat fangpacks and three little rat fang hamsters, you know, make funny, make you look like a dick, you know, it's embarrassing. Now, where do these hamsters live, Red, that you see? I don't know, I think they live in New York, actually. They don't live on your person? No, I guess in Seattle. Somewhere warm in my pocket. I guess for professional hamsters the only place you can get work is down in New York. Yeah, right, Red. Well, Red's on our record label, his name record label is us, I should say, his CD's called I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies, and because of Red's appearance on our show, according to Owen Money, who owns Restaurant Records, which our CD's on with Red's, orders are coming in for our CD, Anthony. Are you kidding? Sam Goodie's just put in a huge order for our CD, Anthony. Really, how many? 850 units. Whoa! That could help us out if you're trying to find Open Anthony's Menoworld CD. Wonderful! Tower Records and Carl Place, just put an order in, Anthony. All right. Record Town Stores, just put in an order. I like that. Wow, I feel like we're getting a tote for Jerry's kids. Right, right. And McDonald's coming in with a million dollars, Jerry, for your kids. That's fantastic, fellas. I'm proud of you. And I just found out we have an 800 number for your CD and our CD. That is correct. 1-800-270-2299. And then he puts on here that to order Super Libido, and he's got a phone number for that. I thought you were kidding. No, as a matter of fact, I'm on it right now. Now, Red, what is Super Libido again? It's in, I guess it's in all, well, that's what they're telling me. I'm hoping because I'm ingesting this stuff. All right. It says something about a doctor approved on it. I didn't know. Uh-huh. My glasses, I may need... Dr. Kovorkian probably. No, no, it's that the lettering is very small on the bottle, but it says something about that it's good for, you know what, your, uh... Wait, is it Libido? Wait, just say it. Just say it. It's like Viagra? It's like Viagra, yeah. This is real stuff? This is real stuff, yeah. And, uh... Super Libido. I'm trying it and, uh... You're on Super Libido right now? Not right now. Well, that explains it. Wow, great. Really. Well, the blood's rushed out of his head. Yeah. I see. I am feeling, I guess I would call it a tingling sensation. All right. All right. Great. And there's a room full of guys, so... Perfect time to have taken it before coming to do our show. Yeah, when that thing pops, could you, like, leave the studio? Uh... I may have to. I don't know, man. Super Libido! So, this stuff is real? It's real, yeah. All right, to order Super Libido. The show's turning into one big plug. Infomercial. 1-800-845-8694. Yep. Red is feeling a tingle, so... I'm feeling a tingling sensation. I have to say, it's... I don't know if it's working or maybe it was that chick I saw yesterday. He's blown up like a party balloon now. He's going to make a giraffe head. Luckily, I'm wearing my big-packaged jeans right now because... To make room for that Super Libido. All right, Red, do you want to sing us out here? One last song from you? Yeah, this is... I'm trying to think of, you know, something that's tropical and that sort of thing. We have the space program and this sort of thing. And this actually was used, although there was not a big deal made of it, to wake the astronauts. Oh, really? This was the song that... To join John Glenn's mission. Right, right. Wow. It was, you know, shake, rattle and roll, get out of bed, what do you have you, and this sort of thing. And I guess it was Clinton's idea, I guess, to... You know, it was a little gag for the guys to... All right, and what's the name of the song? All right. It's called, You Promise the Moon, but I Prefer Uranus. And again, this is with the great Babe Marino and his orchestra with the Alan Pinchelow singers. You know, this reminds me of the Alan Pinchelow singers, how privileged I've been in my career, those five workers, with some of the most fantastic people. Really? I mean, you guys, I think, with me, the show I did with the Hey Would You Blow Me singers. Yes, yes, very talented, very talented guys. And what do you call that? Dog Name Stains, I did that with Smelly Water and the Dickner Brothers, one of them. The... God. The Dickner Brothers, I've been heathen, you've been... You've been... I've been heathen, you've been Dickner... I've been heathen, you've been Dickner, the Dickner Brothers, and I worked with the Joy King off singers. I never went anywhere without Joy King off for many years. And let's see, remember I did that rap song with Sir Scratch Your Ass a lot? Yeah, I remember that. Sure. How can we forget that one? I'm trying to think of somebody... Fudgie Johnson, yeah, he was on the show. I'm trying to think of somebody... Fudgie Johnson, don't forget Fudgie Johnson. Yeah, he was on that. Fudgie Johnson? When were you in third grade again, Red? Oh, I know who, remember I did the duet with Ewe Jorgan? Remember? Ewe Jorgan and I don't know, this is some of the people. Wow, you sure have made the rounds. Oh, remember Bob Frapple? Bob Frapple. He was great, he was great. And I don't know, I've just been very fortunate. Very good, so you're going to sing this lovely little tune. This is You Promise the Moon, but I Prefer Uranus. I'm not queer. I'm just experimenting an idea. The feeling's unrelenting when you're near. That feeling starts extending. And it's just so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. That feeling starts extending towards your rear. And ain't it clear? I just want to bone you, have no fear. I'm not full of baloneya. You and I could fly to Uranus tonight. This is a ladies' choice. All skate, all skate. All skate. Reverse. Groovy. Yeah, that's a great Peter and Anus on guitar. Oh no, an idea. Oh yeah, when you're near. That feeling starts extending towards your rear. And ain't it clear? I just want to bone you, have no fear. I'm not full of baloneya. You and I could fly so high in the sky in the night. Well, all right, yeah, you bite. You and I could fly. You and I could fly so high. You and I could fly to Uranus tonight. Tonight. Yeah. Tonight. Gonna fly. Tonight. We'll fly so high in the sky. Yeah, wow. Wow, man. There's red Peters off the CD. I laughed, I cried, I was so happy. You should have been a rat packer, man. Oh man, I'll tell you. You're a mess. You should have been a rat packer. I'm just hoping that maybe I can catch the wave on the swing thing. Oh yeah, something's swinging. I think you're right. It's got super libido. Bravo, Red. I like that song. Well, Red, it's always a pleasure when you stop on by. Oh, jeez. Okay, and you're back in New York. I'll be back. The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW. It's opiate, Anthony. Thanks for checking us out today. We definitely appreciate it. FU Friday is tomorrow. Yes. You got your FUs in early. Ralph Titor is on before us. He'll make sure he stacks up the pile of FUs. You can send them early if you like. The fax line is 212-957-WNEW. Also tomorrow, the winning begins with the Black Crows thing. All weekend long, you've got chances to win the Black Crows box set. We're going to have a grand prize winner that we're going to fly to Atlanta to see the Black Crows live. That is very cool. Atlanta, huh? At Hotlanta. Go to Atlanta? God damn. God damn. You know we went to Atlanta a little while. Yeah, when we got fired and stuff, we were being flown all over the country for gigs. Yeah, like you interview with radio stations. Right. They fly you in and you hang out. And we flew into Atlanta during Freaknik. Freaknik. Freaknik. Y'all, gee. Freaknik is a bunch of black students from various colleges go to Atlanta and party. And it is just the biggest crowd you've ever seen. If you're white, it scares the crap out of you. Yeah, it closes down the city. And the locals were telling us that they are scared S-list. They close their shops. They board up their windows. No joke. This is what they told us down there. And there's a bunch of these southern people. I remember when we got on the plane to leave, I was sitting next to some white guy. And he turns to me and goes, you're getting out too, huh? We were booked on this flight. This guy was fleeing Atlanta. There are a little more races down there than up here in the north. He was fleeing Atlanta because of Freaknik. But it's crazy. All of a sudden you'll be driving down the street and a car in front of you will stop. And girls and guys will just start getting out and dancing. They'll start getting out and dancing on top of the car. And you're like, you can't beep. Well, they showed a special on Freaknik on MTV. That's exactly what it was. Cars will just stop in the middle of the roads. They have these huge boom boxes and they'll just crank the music and start dancing around in the middle of the highways. And what are you going to do? Excuse me, could you get out of the way? Hello? It's a big mess down there. The locals want Freaknik to go away, but it brings in so much money for the economy down there. They don't know what to do. Yeah. That was our little trip to Atlanta during Freaknik. So we decided not to go to Atlanta. So you guys are stuck with us. Yeah. The funny thing is when they were trying to sell Atlanta on us, Anthony and I are truly from New York. A lot of people still think we're from somewhere else, but we're not. We were born and raised down here. It's a long island. And they knew we wanted to go to New York bad because it's like going home. So they tried to tell us that Atlanta is just like New York. Yeah, right. So Anthony and I would go into the local gin mills to see what was going on. Yeah. There's no bars like that up here, Anthony. No. Well, Atlanta itself was very urban, but not like New York. No way in hell. The second you leave and you're on the outskirts, it was like, you said, we walk in a bar and you, hey, y'all must be from the city, huh? You stupid northerners. Northerners? No, the concrete walking city boy. You, you're just a stupid city folk, ain't you? You automobile driving, concrete walking. You, you, you, you cap wearing. Look at you. Concrete Walker? Living in a house with no wheels, person. And we're like, oh yeah, this is just like New York. Boy, I could get right on the air and sound like I'm from here. Yeah. And the New York humor would really fit in in Atlanta. You made a joke about no teeth. It's not very funny to me. So we didn't go to Atlanta. No, we didn't. All right. Before we leave it, by the way, I must say you never know what you're going to hear when you listen to our show. Yesterday we had a very serious political discussion about the crisis in Iraq. Iraq? Talking about the president and should we impeach him and the politics. It was pretty intense yesterday, right? Heated discussion. I like that. And then today you tuned in our show and what do you hear? Third grade humor. Well, we like doing that. Yeah. That's how life is. We like to mix it up a bit. Sometimes it's serious and you got to do what you got to do and then sometimes you hang out with your friends and it gets stupid. We got to thank, by the way, Red Peters for stopping by. All of ours. Oh, I like the email we got. Red Peters was hysterical, almost as funny as he was on Howard Stern yesterday morning. Who's on deck for tomorrow? Hank the Angry Dwarf? All right. I got to give you that. That's pretty funny. That is funny. We can't help it if we're friends with Red. I know. Sorry. Geez. And if I was Red, I'd go on Howard first too. What kind of names do we have in New York? Not much yet. But you just wait. You wait and see, okay? And tomorrow, yes, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf. All right. Well, anyway, on the phone really fast here is Lamb Chop. Lamb Chop? Yeah, Lamb Chop. We haven't heard from Lamb Chop in a while. What's Lamb Chop calling in for? Well, everyone remembers who Lamb Chop is. Of course, the Sherry Lewis, the sock puppet from Sherry Lewis. The late Sherry Lewis. The late Sherry Lewis. The late Sherry Lewis. And last time we talked to Lamb Chop, he was pretty psyched that the bitch was dead. Wasn't that his exact word, something like that? Something like that, yeah. He was a little bitter that for so many years Sherry got all the recognition and he was the big talent. That's what the whole story was. But I guess there's a Hanukkah special on tonight that he taped with Sherry Lewis. Really? It's an old special and he's stuck promoting it. So I figured he'd call our show and promote his lovely little Hanukkah special tonight. Oh, mad at least. Hey, Lamb Chop! Hi guys! Happy holidays! Happy holidays! Happy holidays to you. I hear you want to plug your Hanukkah special that's happening tonight on Channel 13. Yes, yes, it's great. It's a Hanukkah special. Lamb Chop special Hanukkah. Lamb Chop, I thought you really wasn't into the Lamb Chop gig. No, no, this is great. I think it should be seen by all the boys and girls. Hey, Lamb Chop, cut it out, man. We got a tape of you saying that Sherry Lewis is a bitch. I think the word I used was ****. All right, look, the solo act hasn't been doing too well these days. Think about what that hag's fist is in my ass. No one wants to book me. All right, get to this special. What can we see tonight? Oh, well, it's great. Really? Before Sherry dropped dead, we pumped out this gem. I can't believe it. Before Sherry dropped dead, we pumped out this gem. I can't believe I got a hawk this ****. I'm not even Jewish. My name's Artie Borelli. I'm Catholic. She had me wearing a yarmulke and spinning a dreidel. In between takes, she's down in men as shivets like it's water. So by lunch, this tanked up witch heaves acupilter fish on my head. After an impromptu sponge bath, this lush decides I'm going to like the menorah. Well, for those of you following at home, I'm a **** sock puppet. And this sauce to Betty's hand says about as steady as Richard Bryant. But then the rag ass bumps into the candle and sets my fleece on fire, and she's laughing. The **** bitch is laughing. I'm burning. God, I'm glad she's dead. Catch me tonight on Channel 13. All right, lamp shop. I think I'm on after that homo Elmo. He's gay, you know. He's gay? Yeah, he likes to fist up his ****. All right, bye boys and girls.
