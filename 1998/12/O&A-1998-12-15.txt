 One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with R.E.M. That's Driver Eight and what's the frequency? Kenneth from Monster before that. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey man. And kind of bummed, Mr. Roper died. Yeah, how about that, huh? Mr. Roper. That was one of my favorite shows growing up, my dear company. Three's Company. Was it? Yeah. I didn't like it that much. Why? I don't know. It was kind of gay. I kind of liked the... It was kind of gay. The cans that were always jiggling around. That was kind of cool. Not Suzanne Somers? Yeah. She was like the worst actress. I know, but you know why she got the job. Yeah, I could figure that out. Mr. Roper, his whole big deal was that he never gave his wife sex and his wife would always make these little innuendos that she was never getting any. Mr. Roper would make little jokes and look at the camera and then laugh. Awful show. She wanted Jack. And he thought Jack was a homo. That's why he let him live in the building with two girls. Oh, wild show. Pretty risque for the late 70s, I guess. Hey Jack, but we know what you're into. Oh, everyone laughs. Oh yeah. And the whole thing was, I even thought he was gay. He looked at everyone. If you're going to have a guy trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes, he's gay. Make him look not so gay when he doesn't have to be gay. Right. He's true. He always looked gay. You know that Mr. Roper was only 74 years old? He looked a lot older than that. We did. It looked like he was in his 70s during the show. Right? So, well we're mourning the death of Mr. Roper on the Opient Anthony show today. It's kind of a bone support of our childhood, I guess, in a way. Come and knock on our door. We've been waiting for you. Yeah, I can find that theme if you want, Anthony. Where the kisses are hers and hers and his. Mr. Roper's dead too. Yeah, he died of cancer. He did? Yeah. Uh-oh. And he was in one of those Hollywood retirement homes. He smoked a lot, didn't he? Yes, he did. Uh-oh. Here's to Mr. Roper. Come and knock on our door. We've been waiting for you. Come and knock on our door. Mr. Roper. Come and knock on our door. Mr. Roper. Come and knock on our door. Mr. Roper. Come and knock on our door. Mr. Roper. Come and knock on our door. Mr. Roper. Come and knock on our door. We've been waiting for you. We've been waiting for you. Where the kisses are hers and hers and his. Please, come and eat you. Come and dance on our floor. Dance on our floor. Take a test of it now. You've got a little face that needs your face. Please, come and eat you. You'll see that my miserable again. Roper is going for you. Come and knock on our door. Please, come and eat you. Come and knock on our door. Come and knock on our door. Jack, Jack, you're a homo. Jack, Jack, Jack, he's not sleeping with the girls because he's a homo. That's horrible. No, Mrs. Roper, you're not going to get the big swan tonight. Are you done with your tribute to Mr. Roper? Come and knock on our door. Take a test of it now. We've been waiting for you. Come and knock on our door. Please, come and eat you. Come and dance on our floor. Well, that's a cute little tribute there, Anthony. Yes. Also, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Yeah, welcome. We're up and running. Yes, we are up and running and we are getting new members as we speak. That's right. We initiate new members starting at three every Tuesday for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. You're still Poohba? Is that how it's working? I'm still Poohba. This is your last week of suspension. Next week you'll be back in the club and then you can maybe break out your cute little tape or something. I will. That's what I'm waiting for. All right. I'll prove you wrong. We're just getting warmed up. If you've got a fax to send us, we'd love to read it. 212-957-WNEW. The phone line is 212-757-1027. We've got the instant feedback set and ready to go in. WNEW, Doc. 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York Bad Company shooting star on Two for Tuesday. On the way, some Led Zeppelin and the Who by request. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony. Phones are ringing like crazy today. Phones are ringing like crazy today. Everyone's talking about the Tuesday night Hummer Club. And it's really simple. Everyone has questions every week about this damn club of ours, Anthony. The rules are simple. You've got to get a Hummer on Tuesday between the hours of 3 and midnight. That's it. And then you become a member of the club. And yes, both parties become members of the club. What is that noise? A computer problem. All right. Let me pot that down for now. But everyone's calling in. Yeah. You know, does it count if I get my Hummer on Sunday? No. No. It's the Tuesday night Hummer Club. Everybody knows how it works. And it's quite simple. And we started this club to maybe get some sparks back into the relationships out there. Because we pretty much did a survey. Yeah. And we found that a lot of people that have been married for quite a while, and some that haven't been married that long, kind of lost the spark. And guys find it hard to ask for that oh-so-precious experience. Right. The Hummer. And we apologize for putting all this in the ladies' lap. But someone has to get this started. Yeah. And you ladies are good at getting things started. Right. So it's simple as that. You know, guys, if you've got a lady out there that, you know, you need help with, maybe give her a call right now and make sure she listens to our show today. Because off and on we'll be talking about the Tuesday night Hummer Club. They can bring it up tonight at dinner or something. And maybe they'll get the ball rolling. Talk about what those wacky guys did on the radio today and how silly and stupid this Tuesday night Hummer Club thing is. And next thing you know, something might be happening. It's an icebreaker. Yes. And later on we might pick a sad sap from our audience. And call his significant other. Yes. And see if we can hook him up. Yes. Give it that hands-on help that some people need. Was it last week that we had the cold fish? Or was that the week before already? I think two weeks in a row we've been screwed here. Yeah. We had a great, we had three weeks that we just ripped. And then two weeks, nothing. Nothing. Yeah. We made people's lives even worse. Worse. Where the guy got home, you call a radio station again and tell them I don't give you. It's all over. All right. So we'll get into that. If you've got a sad story, you can fax us. 212-957-WIW. Phones ringing like crazy. Let's grab one here. Hi, IW. I want to know, since Anthony is singing 70s TV theme show songs, if he could do the Alice one again. Well, you know something? I've discovered there are three different versions of the Alice songs. Oh, yeah? I was singing the wrong one. Really? Yeah, there's one that really gets out of hand. Where she really... What did you do that? There's a new girl in town and she's looking good! Like really gets out of control. We might have to break that out. What do you mean there were three versions? There's three versions. I only remember one. Yeah, we all remember just the one. Don't make me punch it up. I'll do it. Oh, he's going to punch it up now because of you. I'll do it. That would be great because I really need a good layoff. Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye. I could have sworn that there's only one version, Anthony. No, but you might remember that we played the original version. Linda Lavin is the worst singer ever. She decides she's going to sing the theme song to our TV show, Alice. It was bad enough in the 70s. Now I think E plays it early in the morning. Sometimes I fall asleep with Eon. I wake up to Linda Lavin, that bad schlock jazz lounge singer thing that she was trying to pull off. It's just awful. And the first one, you might remember, it was early to rise, early to bed. In between I cooked and cleaned away that in my head. There's a new girl in town and she's looking good! Looking good! And she's just screaming. And all that. Very exaggerated. All right. Well, then I get an email from some guy going, there's another version with different words and everything. I don't remember another version. All right. Here, I will pop it up for you. Okay. Here it goes. A little cheesy version. See? Used to be sad. Used to be shy. See? Let's see, she gets out of hand. Here she comes. Here she goes. Never, never, never knew. Girl in town. What was she thinking? The end's even worse. Listen to this. Cover your dog's ears. Here it comes. Whee! Whoop! It's like the emergency broadcast test. What do you have to do? All right. Ah. See? There's one version. Yes, and there's a total of three, you're saying. Oh, yes, Opie. Yeah, listen to this. Ah, we have to hear another one. I used to be shy. See, this is more dead-end. That's it. As I never knew I. Kicking myself. All right, enough of her. Be sick. All right, Linda Lavin. Thank you. Different version, though. Thanks for that lovely phone call. Equally as Hammy. Where's our new girl in town looking good? What the hell is that? I have no idea, but. Get a singer for your show. 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Tuesday, Led Zeppelin, Traveling Riverside Blues. Misty Mountain Hop before that from Zozo. Some people like to call it Led Zeppelin 4. I don't think the band actually named that album. Some people picked up that it said Zozo on the side of the CD and said, it's called Zozo, man. Yeah, man, yeah. All right, on the way, some two-fers from Alice in Chains. Rock. Our listeners were bitching and complaining, saying they don't hear enough Alice in Chains on any W. So we paid attention. We listened to you. We'll do a two-fer before the end of the hour. Figuring that. And we got some Joe and Jed up next for you. Got a fax here. Here, Opie and Anthony, just so you know, Linda Lavin is still on TV. She plays the mother, the main character on NBC's bad new sitcom, Conrad Bloom. What? Like I said, she's not on TV anymore. I swear to God, I've never heard of this sitcom. Conrad Bloom? Never heard of it. And then Kathy goes on to say, she doesn't sing, though. Thank God for small favors. You guys are great. Conrad Bloom. Conrad Bloom. I swear, I've never even heard the name. All right. We'll learn something today. Well, if she is still on TV, she's not going to be for long. I've never heard of that. I don't know if anybody talking about that show. It doesn't have a buzz to it. No clue. Oh, someone is on the line. They just joined the club, Ant. Oh, nice. Hello. Hello, Anthony. Yes. I am a new member of the Hummer Club. All right. I'm the Hummer and he is the Hummy. When did it go down? 3 o'clock this afternoon. Good job. Right on the numbers. Yeah, first in for the week. You are our first brand new member this week. Why, thank you. What's your name? Mary. Mary, what's his name? Bob. Bob. Cool. What were the details? A little bath, a little shower, a little, you know. Don't you guys have to work today? Well, he worked nights and I was off, so it was perfect. Nice. That rocks. Are you guys waiting all day to 3 o'clock to hit so you can become members? I could stand it, yeah. That's awesome. Tapping at the bit, so to speak. All right on. So, Middlesex County rocks on. Cool. I was calling from South River, New Jersey and right now he's taking it easy. He's probably napping. Yeah, he is. All right, I'm out on the cigarette. God, look, I think we made you happy today. I think so. Oh, cool. It's a definite deal. Well, congratulations, guys. Oh, radio. Were you listening to the radio while I was going down? Oh, that is so weird. Oh, he's having on. Yeah, that is a little bit loud. Anthony and I are trying to figure out how many people are having sex while they listen to us. Oh, all the time. Oh, it's awesome. You got to have that spirit to rock hard. The rock hard. Rock hard. Rock hard. Rock hard. Rock hard. Rock hard. Rock hard. The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday with Joan Jett. Little Drummer Boy and Anthony, the complaints are coming in about that song. Yeah? We're not allowed to talk bad about the music anymore, but... Well, that's a Christmas song, so it's kind of seasonal, so maybe... The song blows. ...just say that... It's horrible. ...it's one of our favorites. Are people in their cars singing along and stuff, getting psyched for the holiday because they just heard Joan Jett sing Little Drummer Boy? Oh, not a fave. And everyone's calling it bitch and they go play and saying, don't you guys have anything better to play as far as holiday music? I like the... I just like the goof Christmas songs. I just don't get into all these bands with their Christmas songs. Well, you liked Gary Hewitt. Yeah, because it was different, though. You know what I mean? The Rock. He was jamming and you're like, how the hell is this guy going to play the Grinch Christmas song on a guitar? And he pulled it off. That's why I liked it. It was totally different and new and exciting. Doing the 12 Days of Christmas on a guitar. Try to figure that at home if you're a guitar player. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Yeah, you're right. I did like that. So people are requesting our Christmas songs. Maybe we could play that here. Yeah, that's a good goofy song. I think it's better than the Little Drummer Boy by Joan Jett. Definitely. Now that makes me laugh. It puts me in the spirit to run around from mall to mall to try to get my Christmas shopping done. Really? Not Joan Jett, Little Drummer Boy. Please. And your brother did a great job on that song. Yes, yes, he did. Anthony's brother Joe on lead vocals for the grandma song that you can find on Open Anthony's Dementor World CD. Good luck, Charlie. Good luck trying to find that this holiday season. A lot of people calling in saying, hey, congratulations, you finally figured out a bet last night. Yes, I did. You picked the Niners. And they won. They won. They kicked ass. In all fairness, not the hardest bet to make, but... Oh, right, since they... Well, we'll accept it. And the Giants... wait, and the Giants Denver thing was a hard one? You're like, oh, 49 is over the line. It's not a hard bet. No, I'm just... I'm just saying the obvious, you know, a lot of people took the Niners and gave the points last night. This is the same thing with the Giants. I'm just busting your balls. Damn. You were the... you went on a limb and said that the Broncos would beat the Giants. All right, so you're right. Oops. How's your Zoom.com doing today? Well, I don't even want to talk about it. Why? Well, I... Well, first of all, what did the market do today? Did we kind of survive? I know it was up a lot earlier in the day. Yes, I think we muddled through today, Opie. But... The market's just having a horrible couple of weeks. Yes, I may have made a... oh, wow, it's way up. Yeah, closed at 127. 127 up? 27. Okay. Very good. And I got rid of my Zoom. It's all time low and it went up today. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's follow the story of Anthony and Zoom.com. Oh, no. Four days ago, you bought Zoom at how much? For 38. Zoom.com at 38, okay. You sold it when? Yesterday? Yeah. At what? Like 21. 21? You lost 17 points in what, three days? Yeah, now it's... Now it's going back up. You're kidding, right? What did Zoom.com close at today? Oh. What did it close at? It's like 23. Around this. And you sold it at 25. No, that's the way to go though. You buy high and sell low. That's a great strategy you got there, Anthony. Oh, my God. Maybe I should jump back on it. You might as well. You might as well. You're going to jinx it, but give it a try. So you bought it at 38, you sold it at 21, and today it's up to 23. I better quit this game, huh? I don't think I'm any good at this. Well, the stock market might not be your cup of tea. Not my cup of tea. I'll go back to the track. Stick with the Half-Life game that you play. Yeah. Well, there we go. 1027 WNOW, the Rock of New York. Two for Tuesday with Allison Chains for the Unplugged CD. What a great CD that is. Over now, and no excuses from Jar of Flies before that. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey, man. And everyone is calling up about the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Of course. And we've got a bunch of guys standing by on hold. They need our help today, Anthony. Well, that's what we like to do on Tuesday. We call up the significant other and give a helping hand, as they say. Yes. And let the girls know what the guy wants, tactfully, of course. And most of the time we're successful. The last couple of weeks, we haven't been quite as successful as we'd like to be. Right. I think a couple of couples are heading toward divorce court because of the phone calls we made the last couple of weeks. But in general, we do get the deed accomplished for the guys. And there's a bunch of people just calling in the middle of the act and stuff. It's like, okay, we know you're becoming members while we're on the air. Call us after it's done. Yeah, we don't want to hear it during. No, we don't want to hear it while it's... Exactly. Hello. Two for Tuesday with Pink Floyd on the Rock in New York, 1027WNOW. You're taking the ride home with Opie and Anthony. And new members are joining the Tuesday Night Homer Club as we speak. A lot of you guys on the highway as you drive home. Thanks for letting us know about that. Just keep the car between the lines, okay? Yeah. And at this point, I guess it's time to try to help a couple out there, Anthony. We like to do this every week. Yeah, we get in there and try to get the couple some action. It might have changed a little since you've been married. We like to get in there and shake things up again. We get close to a hundred people contacting us every week, begging us to talk to the wife or the girlfriend or other guys actually. Guys begging us to talk to other guys for them. This club is for everyone, I guess. That's fascinating. It's quite fascinating. We'll do the guy guy thing one of these days. Have fun. It'll be sick, but it'll be funny. I think a lot of people will check it out just for the hell of it. But we get you guys contacting us all week long with your sob stories. And you basically say that you just don't know how to bring it up anymore. Yeah, it's very hard to just bring up a conversation. It's a nice breaker. A lot of the emails and letters start to say, when we first started dating, there's always that line, things were great. We had monkey sex on the subway. We would do it on the couch while her parents were in the other room. We went downstairs to do the laundry. That's what they thought we were doing down there. But then time passed and I got two jobs and she's working and trying to raise the kids. And now our mother-in-law lives with us. All these horror stories. So that's why we started the Tuesday Night Hammer Club. We figured we'd put it right out in the open for everyone. So let's talk to Stephen here and see if we can help him out. Steve, I hear you need our help trying to get your wife into the Tuesday Night Hammer Club thing. Most definitely. She ain't buying it at all. She's thinking of making the whole thing up. I put you guys on to have her listen to when you guys were ready off last week. So they get her to listen to us while we're on the air. Yeah, that usually helps. Well, where is she right now? She should be home. If she's not home, she's just out spending more of my money, which that ain't too good. When was the last time you had a home? We're talking months. Back in June maybe. It's been a while. And why don't you guys get it on? Well, she was saying she didn't like the way... Can I say ****? I guess I can say **** now. I shouldn't say she didn't like the way my **** thinks when I'm drinking beer. So I quit drinking. I got the herbs still, but... Alright, alright. Alright, a little too much information there, Steven. Alrighty. Alright, let's give her a call here. What's her name? Roseanne. Alright, Steven, let us do all the talking, but you'll be able to listen in, okay? Alright, hold on. Hello? Roseanne? Yes? Hi, it's Opie and Anthony from WNEW Radio. Hi. How are you? I told us to give you a call. I have not a clue. You listen to the show at all? When I can, yes I do. Alright. You know what Tuesday is? No. Why do you laugh when you say that? I don't know. Am I supposed to know, I guess, right? No, why do you laugh when you say that? You have an idea? No. Yes, you do? No, I really don't. Alright, well we did start the club, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Is this ringing a bell now? Yeah, now it's ringing a bell. Alright. And we're crazy enough to actually start this club. It's just a way to get couples together, to break the ice. Okay. When was the last time you gave him a homework? Excuse me? Opie, you've got to be a little more tactful here. Well, you try. So how long have you kids been married? Almost four years. And I heard a little toddler in the background? Yes, you did. So when was the last time you hobbed his dog? Opie, please. Please accept my apology. I don't even know what to say. So, you have a child too, huh? Yes, we do. That should be a good clue. And things might have changed since you first got married, right? Yes. Well, that happens with everybody. Have you buffed his helmet lately? I'm sorry, have I what? You're a sweetheart. Oh, see, this is the type of stuff that kind of gets in the way of your relationship being the way it used to be. And guys have a hard time asking for a certain thing that is very special to us. Uh-huh. The hummer. So we're saying that on Tuesdays, maybe the women in the relationship can give the men a hummer, thus breaking the ice and getting those wild, crazy sexual days back again. Oh, okay. Is it my grandma? No, it's not grandma. Definitely not grandma. How can we possibly do that with a kid right there? I'm not even that sick. Is it grandma? Oh, man. Well, Roseanne, what do you think the chances are of making Steven a member tonight? Oh, I think we could probably swing something. All right. It'd make him very happy. Okay, I'm glad. We're trying to make the world a happier place, and I think that's one way to start. That's wonderful. You guys are really something. Well, we try to be tactful, but it just never works. Okay, well, listen, I just have one question for you. Yeah. What's in it for the women? Anything? Well, we do encourage reciprocation. Oh, okay. I know pretty much every guy is into Hummers, and women, they're different. Some are into whatever. But if there's a guaranteed Hummer in it, I'm sure the guy will go for anything. Actually, Steven. Your husband's on the line, Roseanne. I'm sure he is. Hello, darling. See, this is what it takes. I tried to tell you this is real s***. I didn't believe it. Yeah, well, now you do. You didn't believe it, huh? I didn't believe it. Well, there you go. We accomplished a feat for you guys. Well, have fun and let us know how it turns out tomorrow. Most definitely. Grandma, no, it's not grandma. 1027, WNAW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, Jimi Hendrix, Dolly Dagger. I don't think I've ever played that song on the radio. No? Sounding good though, man. We're doing different things here at NW, and are you experienced before that? I am. I'm fine and Jean and the rest of the gang at Centiport Deli, they've been with us from the beginning and we appreciate it, boys. Thanks for checking in. Yes. Another Long Islander has joined the NW staff, Anthony. Uh-huh. Our pal and our friend, Ralph DeTour, we're very excited to announce that he is now doing the shift right before us here at NW. You were co-workers for a while, weren't you? We were co-workers on Long Island for like three, three and a half years. And I grew up cutting class in high school and tuning in Ralph as we're drinking our beers in the parking lot of Harborfields High School. So I go way back with Ralph DeTour. And it's the first time I feel like the station is finally moving forward. Here we go. We're moving. The process has begun. Got a new morning show coming in soon. We'll have details on that and that's a very exciting thing as well. So please keep listening to NW. It's only going to get better from here. We don't do these things overnight. No. Slow, arduous process. Overnight? You know, it's our six-month anniversary today of doing afternoon drive in New York City. Are you kidding me? Six months. We've been here six months. It feels like five years. It's been a long six months, but we are definitely starting to have a lot of fun. I feel like I've aged five years, man. I know. And Ralph DeTour takes you through the world's largest rock library with the online archives, Weekdays at Noon, and he brought to NW. And it's pretty cool. He's featuring great guitars this week, so make sure you check out Ralph tomorrow at Noon. Rock! Anthony, I've got another telemarketer call. I forgot to tell you. Which one is this? There's a new one. What do you got? Well, as probably a lot of faithful listeners know by now, I'm sick of the telemarketers. So I've turned the tide on them because they refuse to stop calling me. I've tried all the tricks. Take my name off your list. So I tape them and I mess with them a bit. All right. This one, I will warn people ahead of time, is a bit harsh. Unlike the other ones, aren't they? Yeah, a bit harsh, a bit edgy. If you're going to be easily offended, turn over to Fat Rocky and make a bid on a Furby dollar. Whatever the stupid thing he's doing with that. Hey, we've got Furbies. What will you do for a Furby guy? For a Furby? Hey, you have to try to tell us what the little Furby's saying to win the Furby. I know some stupid station in this town is doing that bit. Of course. I wouldn't doubt it if it was him. But anyway, so this lady calls from a bank. The bank I go to. A bank? Yes. I don't think I've ever gotten a telemarketer call from a bank. Well, they're calling their customers to see how the service is. Oh, oh. You know, one of those service surveys. And between a scale of like one to ten, you've got to rate the service. Okay. Like how is the teller, where you're greeted, where you're, you know, taking care of everything you needed, all that crap. I've heard of those, okay. And you sit home and you rate them. Well, this gets way out of hand. Take a listen. 1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York. Rolling Stones, Two for Tuesday rocking Hard Place and Love is Strong. Those bastards aren't coming to New York, huh? Hartford is the closest they're coming on their next tour. Great. No New York, huh? Thanks for taking care of us, Mick. You're only in this city every other weekend doing our broads. You can't play for us? It's not a big city or anything. Yeah. Skip the little, the cute little town of New York, I guess, huh? Yeah. Why aren't they playing New York? There's no basketball. I'm sure they could get some dates at the garden. I don't know. I'm not sure. It's a question. It's pathetic. I guess we've got to get them broads. Broad. Mixed broads. Do we even use the term broads in the late 90s? Yes, I think that's the term now that we use. Yes, broads. Joe Penanthi, I want to congratulate all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, everyone. Congrats. Good job. Good job, people. Is Ben in it yet? We've been sitting here for the last three hours. We don't even know who you are. Two and a half hours. I'm Anthony from Vital Transportation. I'm one of your sponsors. You guys want me out of here right now? We hate our sponsors. It's like we're under a constant state of blackmail. No, we love our sponsors. Yes, we do. And what do you do? We have a limousine company in Manhattan. I have 350 sedans and 100 limousines. And Lisa Orban was nice enough to solicit me. I'm one of your sponsors now. We start in the third week of January. Congratulations. You have those cars that the guys drive around and cut everybody off with? Definitely. The guy goes, I don't know where I'm going. Where do I go? He's on the air. Some of those drivers are worse than the cabbies. My guys are all right. They don't smell. You don't have any of those livery cabs, do you? No. I hate the livery cabs. In fact, we're going to send a couple home. Yes. Your friends are yours, right? Yeah, John and his lovely girlfriend, Tonya. I don't think she's from Boston. No, she's from London. You want to hear a London accent? Come on, Tanya. Say hi. Hey, what do you call pants? Charles's. No, that's really... No, say it. Nickers. Nickers is rude? She thinks the word Nickers is rude. Are you serious? Rick said maybe on the way home that he can get into the Hummer Club tonight. Never know. I'll find out later and then we'll discuss it tomorrow. All right. You got those big-ass limos that are like a block long. How long are these limos going to get before they break in half? I've got a 14-passenger that sits there the size of a van. It's everything. You got the soda machine, the sink, the toilets, it's all around. Soda machine? It's a limo. What the hell happened to the limo? They've got a hot tub in the middle. I brought him a shirt. I brought Anthony a shirt with Joe DiMaggio. How am I supposed to wear this? Where can I possibly... Let me explain really fast. He brought presents in for everyone. He brought Ben, who was with that transsexual over the weekend. I guess officially he didn't do much with the transsexual, so he says. What did you bring him? I brought him an escort service book for S&M. I figured if Ben wants to have some girl call up, hopefully she'll be a girl, not a man with a mustache. I told Ben, call up, see how much it's going to cost you. We'll put it on the credit card and see if he can get satisfied for the evening. All right. So you brought that for Ben. For Anthony, you got him a t-shirt. I brought her all... did you see what I brought her all? I brought her all a giant yearbook and some rolling papers. I got the Jolton Joe DiMaggio... You got the Jolton Joe DiMaggio. Everyday Anthony's sitting there saying, you know, this guy's dying, now he's walking, now he might be dying, so I had him every day, a different condition, one day he's fair. It's more tasteless than anything I said. Okay. But hang, what the hell, thanks. And where's the Tuesday Night Homer shirt you got? Tuesday Night Homer shirts are right here. All right. It's for you. It's like Christmas in here, Opie. Can I say happy birthday to my son? He's one year old today. Security, security, security. I'm going to kill Lisa, I'm going to kill Lisa. I can't wear this. I can't wear this. It's got sexual positions all over the back. And it says on the front, if Wednesday is hump day, then Tuesday is hummer day. I can't, where am I going to wear this, dude? You know, you want to wreck your lawn? There's all kinds of sexual positions on the back of the shirt. There's six, seven hummer positions on the back of the shirt. Correct. Is that a horse tail? Oh, that's her hair. I thought the guy had a horse tail on. Yeah, but that's her hair. All right, wow. This is just like Christmas. You're welcome. Thank you guys for having me on. Thanks for letting me sit outside for a couple of hours. I also brought you a free $50 feels for meals, travelers check for the first 50 people. They get free feels. Yeah. Vital transportation is donating that to them. Okay, yeah, we are trying to get the feels for meals thing together. All right, thanks. You're welcome. Thanks for having me, guys. Great. I hope I didn't ruin the show. No, you're fine. No, we were ruined well before you came in today. I asked you guys if you want, we're going to go to the Super Bowl, so you can go. I would like to call you guys from the Super Bowl, give you a traffic report in regards to limousines and everything else. What's going on?
