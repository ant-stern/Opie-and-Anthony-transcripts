 One oh two seven W-N-E-W, The Rug of New York, Two for Tuesday with live selling the drama and the lightning crashes. Two from Petty to start the show off today. It's Opie and it's Anthony. Hello. On this dreary Two for Tuesday. Yuck. But who cares? We're going to have a good time today on the radio. Yeah. Thanks for checking us out right away. I don't know, I don't even know where to begin today. I got a list of stuff that we got to get to. We do have a few topics today to work off of. Monica, the audio tapes released. Sounds pretty funny. She kind of, you know, you can understand how Bill might want to have phone sex with that. Yeah, she's got a hot little voice. She's kind of got a cute voice. Uh huh. Then you hear that Linda Tripp on the same tape. Ugh, Monica. So did he come over to his house? Why? Well, I got exclusive tape of Monica. Everyone's got it. It's not too exclusive, Opie. Oh no, I don't think anyone's got the actual tapes. I don't know what they've been playing on the TV and all the other radio stations. We got the exclusive audio of Monica. Oh yeah. Would you like to take a listen? I would, indeed. Okay, it's another exclusive from the Opie Anthony Show. It's Monica Lewinsky talking to Linda Tripp. Oh yeah. She's a little upset there. Yeah. As Linda asking her, run the last time she saw. Oh look, that got her. That got her pissed. You're not going to hear that on any other station. Exclusive audio. One of the tapes I seem to have missed when listening to Winds. I can't believe you missed that one, Anthony. Wow. Actually, would you like a little clip of Monica? Yeah, let's hear some. All right, which one do you want to hear? We got Monica crying. That has got to be the best clip. Come on. Monica Lewinsky talking to Linda Tripp. Linda Tripp, a great friend of hers, taped their conversations. Something like 24 hours worth of tapes. Something like that. Yeah, what a gal. In one point in the tape, she refers to their relationship as like a mother daughter. She's just laying the screws to the girl. I hope Linda Tripp gets hit by a Mack truck. It looks like it happened already. Look at her mug. All right, so this is Monica just losing it. Yeah. I don't know. Were you crying? I was upset. I just felt like I have no... I can't take it anymore. I know, I know. I just can't. I just... Oh my God. I just... It's too... It's too much for one person. Oh, it is too much for one person. Yes, it is. Oh my God. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. I just can't. She's talking about the president of the United States. Giving a hummer to the president and she's crying like she just got stood up on prom night. The president, honey, that's what you stepped in there for. What did you think? First lady was around the corner? She's talking like she went to the mall and the guy she had a crush on was with another girl. Yeah. I was coming out of the gap and I saw Robbie with Cindy. He said he liked me but he really, really liked her. It's a present. She gave him a hummer. Oh wow. We've got lots more audio to get to. This is Two for Tuesday, the facts line, 212-957-WNEW. Request line, 212-757-1027. You've got a chance to come in this coming Monday to see Kiss when we interview them. How about that? We'll have details in just a bit. Black Crows next. 1027-WNEW, the rag of New York, the latest from the Black Crows, kicking my heart around by your side. That CD's going to be out in mid-January, I believe. Toby and Anthony. Hey. Very, very busy day and all our technology is failing us, Anthony. You seem a little ticked off over there. I don't want to hear our technology is failing. My technology is working just fine. Okay. I figure it's about time we start getting the studio cam hooked up in here so when we're doing various things we can put it on the website and people can look in, see what we're doing. So I have it all hooked up. I have it hooked up. I wanted a little link on the WNEW website that you could click on to get to our little webcam. I can't find the guy. I guess Scott Colombo took the day off and we need him desperately. We've been beeping him. Here's the day we need him. Every 10 minutes and if anyone knows where Scott Colombo is, have them call the Open Anthony show. We need him today. Our instant feedback is not working. The instant feedback doesn't work. We want to put the camera up. I have the camera up and working. The only people that can see it are people who know our secret underground website address which is a pain in the ass to give out because it's too long. It's impossible to give out. There are people that know it. If they've emailed us, we've emailed them back the underground website. That's one way to get to it. It would have been handy if they could have gone to the WNEW website, clicked on a link and instantly gotten to it. Right there. We're supposed to have Phyllis come in today. She's going to audition for us to see if she's worthy enough to meet Steven Tyler. Not just meet Steven Tyler. She wants to spend 15 minutes with him. So we're going to come down and check her out. We're going to throw her picture up there on the website. As it happens. And let the listeners decide if she's worthy or not. Now it's going to be a mess. Now it's going to be the five or six people that have the underground website. Because we can't get a link on the WNEW website. Isn't that great? No one cares about our show. We're trying to make things happen here. No one cares. Sorry that people that were in these seats before just got used to the telephone as a new invention. We want to bring the studio into the 21st century coming up right around the corner with computers, cameras. Let's let it work. But for some reason we just got the telegraph equipment out of here Friday and installed some telephones. Well you know when they hired us they actually re-hooked up the phone system. They didn't need it for many years. Yeah they blew the dust off it. It was like at the Munster's house. Just dust went flying off everything. We're trying to move the station into the future with a mentality from the past. So Scott if you're listening we need you to call please. Alright. Got to say hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. People are waiting for us to mention that. Yes we will be inducting new members tonight. Yes. Ladies I hope you know what you have to do by now. Are you going to become a member now tonight? You're the grand poobah opie. I'm co-poobah. I was a member last week. First week it started. And you come in Wednesday. Opie you a member? No. No. Well no I'm not going to become a member tonight to be totally honest with you. And I'll tell you why we're going out with the boss. Oh yeah that's right. The boss is taking us out tonight. What am I going to do? Hey boss I've got to become a member. Remember what I had to do to get this job. Well I've got to do it again. Come on. So now I've got to wait until next week it looks like. Wow you're I don't know I'm disappointed. Well what do you want? You want a poobah that has actually done it. You have to have a club or an organization where the head guy is. Okay Anthony that's fine. What do you suggest? I'm all ears at this point. So I blew it last week. I obviously can't do it today. Well ears ain't the problem. Alright well we'll give you another week and then you might have to be impeached as poobah. Don't put the pressure on me. I'm sorry you can't continue to be the head of an organization. And not be a member. Well could you give me two more weeks? If Sy Spurling was walking around bald people would go oh look he's the hair club president and he's bald. No one cares about that but he's a member he's got the hair club hair. Well you've got to come be a little slack. You know we're going out tonight with the boss. Yeah I know. The pressure will be on next Tuesday. How's that? Alright we'll give you until next Tuesday and we might have to start impeachment hearings. Alright but you never know something could happen today. Impeach for not getting a hummer. There's something interesting. There's a twist. Hey Monica's in town. Maybe she could come up to the station. Hey there you go. She sounds cute on the tape. She sure does. But ladies you know what you've got to do tonight. Now this all stemmed from a couple weeks ago we were discussing relationships and well lack of communication. Lack of communication between the sexes. Everyone's miserable out there. Everyone's miserable. They're not getting what they want in general. I know there's people out there that are completely happy with the relationship they're in and that's great. Keep it to yourself because there's a lot of people miserable. So we're just trying to like push the ladies along here. We had to start somewhere. I know we get a lot of faxes and emails from ladies saying hey this isn't fair. But we are encouraging the guys to reciprocate as well. It's hard to ask for such a thing as a hummer. Yes. But when Opie and Anthony ask ladies please. Take care of the guys. They'll take care of you. It'll make the whole world a little happier. The Dow Industrial as I look right now is above nine thousand for the first time since July this week. We have something to do. It had to be because of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Everyone's happy. They're optimistic about the future. There you go. We're just asking the ladies to make the first move. Because guys truly want hummers. They just don't know how to ask for it anymore. Exactly. And that's why we invented the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. See that Alan Greenspan came on and said lower interest rates. Why did he do that Opie? Because he probably is a member of our club. Exactly. He's happy. He wants everyone to be happy. So he's doing what he can. We're doing what we can. Let's make the world a happier place. Oh and ladies you do become members of the club. This isn't just a male club. Of course. Both people become members. And you can brag to all your friends. It'll be the talk of the party. We're going to come out with bumper stickers and pins maybe. Yes. All graphic designers out there send in your designs. Identify each other. We are looking for the Opie and Anthony Tuesday Night Hummer Club bumper sticker. Maybe even a secret handshake. So when you're on the highway you can see your fellow members. I wonder what that would look like. The secret handshake? Yes. Alright. Cool? Yeah. Alright. It's Two for Tuesday coming back with the Stones. Stay there. 1027 WNEW The Rock of New York. Two for Tuesday with the Rolling Stones. The Rolling Stones Monkey Man from Let It Bleed and of course Do Do Do Do Do Heartbreaker from Goats Head Soup. It's Opie and Anthony. Amen. And in the studio we got the lovely Phyllis. Say hi Phyllis. Hello. She's scared. Of course I'm scared. Take your mic. Yeah. You're actually very brave to come into our studio. I know. I'm extremely brave. You're right. Yes. Now Phyllis' story is she wants 15 minutes with Steven Tyler. Right. Right. That's true. I think that we could possibly help you. I think you could. Because we had a great phone conversation with him when last week. That's right. I thought you were going to do it then. Yeah. We had a good conversation and he did promise that he'll stop on by when he comes to town December 27th. Yes. That's why I'm here. So you came down to the studio so we could check you out. Yeah. We got a kind of, you know, judge for Steven. Well I think you guys should be the ultimate. We kind of know what Steven is into. We leave it up to our listeners now. That's just the way it is. That's the deal. We don't do anything without our listeners. You think Steven likes a shy girl? Oh my God. No, I'm not shy. It's not the shy. No. No. Okay. So you have black hair actually. Yeah. Do you dye it? No. No. Natural black hair. All right. What color are your eyes? Blue. Green. They're blue, right? Blue or green, depending. She's actually not bad. I'm kind of bummed. I was hoping for some kind of slob that we could make fun of. Who do people tell you you look like? Oh, I've heard a few weird things. I don't even want to repeat them really. Courtney Cox, things like that. Courtney Cox? No. A little bit. No. How about the chick from the first Indiana Jones movie? Who is that? Yes! That's it. Karen Allen. Karen Allen. Really? You've heard that one. No. You look like a Karen Allen, especially in the eyes. Yeah. Very good at it. But your hair is longer. Yeah. I'm going to go with 5'2". 5'2". That's not bad. And your measurements? 36, 24, 36. You've got 36 under there. Yeah, it's black. She wore this big puffy sweater, for God's sake. Or black, covered. Wait, stand up. Wow, that's good luck. Hey, you've got some knockies on there. Wow. Hey, wow. You see, I should have sat. Come on, I was just checking on your knockies. That's pretty good. Turn around. Turn around. We've got to see the caboose. Oh, my goodness. You're starting trouble over there, the quiet one. Let's see. Yeah, that's not bad at all. You're very good. I like that. I got a shot at Steven Tyler. How's your hoop? My hoop? How's your hoop? Holy Jesus. What? I thought we were just kind of having fun. You don't just come out and ask people, how's your hoop? What happened? Things are going okay. I thought I could sit down. So, we're doing so well here. And he does this all the time. He doesn't know where the hoop is. He just doesn't know where the hoop is. He doesn't know where the hoop is. So, we're just going to sit down and see how you do. Oh, my goodness. We're doing so well here. So, we're doing so well here. We're doing so well here. And he does this all the time. He doesn't know where the line is. He steps right over it. He doesn't even know any better. No wonder I'm not a member of my own club. The ladies are scared of me. Well, I think she's pretty cute. Yes, I think. But our listeners are the final judges. Yes. And we have to just take a shot and leave it to the listeners. Yeah, we're going to put your picture up on our underground website. I think you'll do fine. Well, we've got a couple of things we want you to do. I think you'll do fine. No, no, no, no. Trust me, it's okay. It's okay. I trust you. First of all, we need a very good seductive shot. Okay. That's all that. Look into the camera and give your best seductive pose. Take our headphones off because we don't want anything to get in the way. Thank you. Okay. All right, look into Anthony's camera. Tell him when you're ready. Hold on, hold on. That's not seductive. You're holding your hand. I don't know. It's not hard. Go ahead. Don't do that. It's hard. I'm snapping as we speak. You do it. You pick it. All right. Now look into the camera. Anthony, you aren't even looking at the camera on that one. Thank you very much. I'm with you. All right. Hold on, hold on. You got it. Let us give us a look. There you go. Smile. Oh, yeah. Okay. I just snatched a shot. Oh, yeah. Very good. There we go. Okay. I want to take these, yeah? Yeah, we'll show you the picture. Don't you sweat it. If you guys got our underground website address, these pictures will be up and running in a few minutes. Did you get a good seductive shot, Anthony? All right. I think we could use another one. All right. Another seductive shot. That one was one of those like you were caught sneezing. Yeah, look into the camera. Look into the camera. Show it love. Okay, that's good. Oh, yeah. That'll be good. That'll work. We'll take that work. Now we need a full-length shot standing up. No, no, no, no, no, no full-length. Just stand up. Stand up. You look fine. We're not even asking you to get naked. We're being nice. Come on. I'm dressed for work. You look fine. You look fine. Now look into the camera. Okay, hold on. Oh, yeah. Okay. You got to back up a little because we need a full shot of you. Yeah, how about you back up to Cleveland? Wait a minute. Right? Right? See how he's getting. You see how he's getting. I'm sorry, Phyllis. All right. Hold on. I expected abuse. Okay. Right there. Got it. All right. We got one of them. Now we're going to need the side shot to accentuate your perky, your perky hips. Oh, yes. Okay. Don't get bent. Yeah, don't let your hands get in the way. Yeah, you can do the Marilyn Monroe. Go ahead. There you go. All right. I want to stand there. All right. There you go. Come on. I tucked that. There you go. That's the shot. That's the one we could use. Yes. Okay. Very good. Wonderful. Why is Ben coming in here? You want to do the plunger thing too? Yeah, we're going to try to do that. Hey, Rick, give her the plunger. This is a brand new plunger. What are you doing? Getting a picture of Steven Tyler for her. Oh, that's a good idea. Okay. No, no, no. Never happened. No, don't worry. The plunger is brand new. Trust me. We went out on the street and we bought a brand new plunger. We figured if you want 15 minutes alone with Steven Tyler, you're going to have to kiss lips that big. You're going to have to know how it is to kiss those huge, giant Steven Tyler lips. That is sick. Wait a minute. All right. So Rick put the picture of Steven Tyler on the plunger. It's actual size now. All right. Give it your best shot, Phyllis. Kiss the plunger. We're serious. You guys are too much. We're twisted. I know. Go ahead. You really are. Go ahead. Just think it's Steven Tyler. They're that big. It's as good as his lips. All right. We understand that, but it's that big. All right. Just go. We've got to move on with music here. Wait a minute. No, you've got to show the plunger. No, I can't. I can't show you. You guys are killing me. This is great. You're doing very well. I know. I'm loving this. Wait a minute. I need a picture of that face. Wait a minute. Let me get in there. Let me get in there. This is very classic. This is something I want to show my children. All right. She just made out with the plunger. You've got to picture that, Anthony. All right. Are we going to go with the banana, too, or? No, no, no, no, no. You're not. No, you're not. Yeah, now, well, Steven likes a good Lewinsky like the rest of us. Yes. And we went and think, we just want to see if you can get ... Yeah, that's fine. We're serious. It's just a banana. I know you are. We want to see if you can get five in there. Now, wait a minute. You know what I have to ask you, Steve? No. We've been talking about this for a long time. I've been talking about this for a long time, and I'm like, what? I'm like, oh, I'm going to get five in there. I'm like, oh, I'm going to get five in there. We just want to see if you can get ... Yeah, that's fine. We're serious. It's just a banana. I know you are. We want to see if you can get five in there. Now, wait a minute. You know what I have to ask you, though? What is honestly, what is my guarantee? Not much of anything, actually. See what I'm saying? The guarantees are pretty slim. You're going to be getting into such a hard time. Slim to none, but all right, go ahead. Anthony needs to get the picture of you and the banana. You're just tuning in. Phyllis is auditioning to be a better shot. I give you your best shot. She wants 15 minutes with Steven Tyler. Go ahead. Nobody said anything. I'm going to be in the picture. All right, that's fine. All right, there it is. Wait, wait, don't bite it. All right. Perfect. Did you get it in? I got it. I got it. Okay, here's the deal. We've got a bunch of pictures of Phyllis. We're going to put it on our underground website, unfortunately, because Scott Colombo is not here and we can't hook it up any easier today. And we're going to put it on our website. We're going to put it on our website. We're going to put it on our website. We're going to put it on our website. And you guys start using the instant feedback to vote on whether or not Phyllis is worthy of meeting Steven Tyler and hanging with him for 15 minutes. There you go. Okay. And we're coming back with more great rock and roll on the way. We've got Aerosmith for Phyllis and The Who next. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with The Who from Quadrophenia. The punk meets Godfather and My Generation. It's OP and Anthony. Hey. You never know who's going to step on by the studio. We got to say hi to Christina Morrison. Hello. Hi. Wow. Wow. We're not used to seeing really hot girls in the studio. I don't know what to say to her today. I don't either. Phyllis, what do you think of Christina? Well, she's a doll. She's a doll? She's a doll, definitely. She's beautiful, right? She's from Gallery Magazine, right? Yes. Gallery. Wow. And you're the girl next door of the year? Yes. Now, what's that all about? Well, they have a contest. It's strictly for amateurs over the age of 18. You send your photo in and you run for girl of the month. And if you get girl of the month, then you're automatically entered for girl of the year. And I won out of 12 other girls. So here I am. And you're the girl next door? Yes, girl next door of the year. I used to love that the best in that magazine. You go through it, you know, you'd see the pros and everything. It's like, all right, they're kind of cool. And then you go to the girl next door and it just gave you that real feel. Yeah. You know, some of them are kind of ... Would you agree with that? Well, you know ... All of them are very, you know, very nice. You don't have to be politically correct in this show. So what is your real answer? Do you agree with us? We've seen some ... Sometimes. We've seen some messes in there. I mean, you got to admit, sometimes things like maybe shaving would be an order, I would think. I guess that's just a personal preference. Personal preference? I mean, if you don't want to, you don't ... For the love of God, shave above your knee, please. It's like, you know, here's April taken by her friend Bob. It's like, oof, Bob should have taken the weed whacker out before the Polaroid. I think. But that's just me. That's just us. Yeah. But girls like you don't live next door to me. Yeah, really. I'm sorry. I got the fat housewives that love Rosie O'Donnell. So was that the first time you posed naked? Yes. It was in front of anybody. And who took the pictures? His name is Warren Tang, here in New York. And then when I won the yearly, I went to LA and it was Stephen Hicks. Oh, so you didn't have one of your friends take the pictures? Well, for the entry, yes. I had a friend of mine take it. Who? Was it an old boyfriend? Yes, old boyfriend. Oh, it was? Old boyfriend? Wait. But I have been wanting to do this for about four years. So nobody told me to do it. Nobody. Right. This is something I wanted to do. But he was a boyfriend when he took the picture, obviously. Yes. And then when it was published, he wasn't a boyfriend anymore? Well, we kind of went our separate ways. Oh, he's got to be hating you. Oh, that poor man. We still talk. We're still friends. Oh, sure you guys are. No, yes, we are. I just spoke to him last night. So do all his friends call him up and say, hey, so your girlfriend naked? Well. It's got to be a little awkward. I mean, you know what some people do with a picture, don't you? Did that sink in at all? Yeah, it sunk into him, yes. Yeah? What's on your arm? That's an old tattoo. Wow. You're a wild girl. Is it his name? No. What is it up? Yeah. And why is it an old tattoo? I'd rather not say, but I have another one here. Check this out. Yeah. Yay. Oh, that's cute. What is it? It's a grateful dead bear. Yeah, I know. I didn't expect it to be on your ankle though. Any piercings we should know about? Oh, no. No? All right. Why the Got Milk T-shirt? Got any? Loaded question. All right. Well, if you want to go down that road, have you heard about our Tuesday Night Hummer Club yet? Have you heard of our Tuesday Night Hummer Club? No. I'm not from here. You're not from here? Would you like to be a member? We induct new members every Tuesday night. Mmm. It doesn't have to be with us. I'm just saying in general. No. Look at him. He wants to be. That guy wants to be a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. That's Mark. Who's Mark? I think that's Mark. Get Mark in here. Does he take you around? That's the UPS guy. Oh, that's the UPS guy. UPS guy. Oh, screw Mark. Screw him. Yeah. No packages. No packages. No packages getting delivered. This is the UPS guy. Mark, grab that mic. Are you off or something? Are you off? Am I off? Yeah. I'm delivering the packages, buddy. Oh, there you go. How about that package? You think she should become a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Mark? Oh, definitely. Dude, her eyes are up there.

Well, our club is we encourage the ladies to give their man some oral stimulation on Tuesdays. Because guys, you know, they have such a hard time asking. You know, sometimes after a while in a relationship, it just kind of goes to the wayside. You know how it is. Nice. Right. You know how it is. Right. She's like, for the love of God, get me out of here. What happened? So what does Dad think of your posing? Oh, he loves it. Does he? Yes. Now, there's a surprise. He is all for it. He's... Does he bring the pictures in to work and brag to all his friends? No, actually, he's got my July issue. And I have it framed. He's got it framed and it's taped. And it says, to Dad, love Bean. That's my nickname. He takes it to work and everything and he's got it taped so nobody can open it up and look at it. But he loves it. Alright. Like they wouldn't just go out and buy it anyway. No. Without saying where he works, what does he work? What does he do for a living? He inspects tanks for a John Deere. Oh yeah? He works at a factory. So there's all these guys, you know... They would love to check out the man. I'm sure they've got their own copy at home. You know that the pictures just end up on the wall taped to the job. It's like, you know, there's the assembly line moving through and there's your pictures on every piece going through. Oh, alright. And what do you do for a living? What's your... When you're not naked... I just finished one... I think you should be naked full time. Don't get me wrong. Oh, okay. Believe me. Yeah, that was a compliment. I just finished one year of college for accounting. Accounting? Yes. That's not very exciting. I work at a lingerie store back home. I figure it's okay. I can buy that. What, model? No, I'm a sales and bookkeeper there. Are they insane? They should get you in the window. Like, as a display. No. No? Wow, okay. Alright, Christina. Well, I think she should have won too. You had my vote. Thank you. So what issue are you in, the one that's currently on the newsstands? It comes out December 22nd. It's a January issue. Of Gallery Magazine. Gallery Magazine. Look for Christina Morrison. Girl next door of the year and she's quite lovely. Yeah. Alright, thanks for stopping by. Thank you. Would you like to kiss our plunger? No, thanks. You don't make her kiss the plunger. Why? Terrible. Alright, we got two from Aerosmith next. Stay there. 1027 WNEW. The Rack of New York, two for Tuesday. With Aerosmith, living on the edge. Ragdoll before that. The boys coming to town December 27th. Continental Arena. And on our show all this week, you got chances to win tickets to see Aerosmith. I think we'll give it away later on in the show. Just stick around, okay? Nah. Speaking of Aerosmith, Phyllis is still in the studio. Sophie and Anthony. Very, very busy show today, by the way. Yes. People are coming in and out. We got UPS guys coming through. Gallery women. She was pretty cute. Christina was gorgeous. Rick says I was just staring at her. Well, that's what you do. Rick, what are you talking about? Grab that mic. What was I doing? Dude, you were like stunned. You couldn't move. You were like stoned. You were just looking at me like, ah. It was a good feeling. Yeah. Usually we have messes in the studio. It was funny. Oh, be Phyllis. It was funny. Oh, be Phyllis is here. Come on. I don't want to say that. I didn't see you behind the computer. He wouldn't have had me before. I didn't see you behind the computer. I'm sorry. But after the interview, what else are you going to say? She's dumb as a box of rocks. What am I going to start talking politics with her? She's a hot girl. I don't know, though. At least Aunt was able to stand there and just look at her. Oh, like Aunt? I was having a great conversation with Aunt. I was gawking, too, though. Yeah, but I could see in your eyes you were pulling the pants down. What am I going to get an ass like a 13-year-old? What the hell is wrong with that? Are you a homo or something? I was just acting normal. I'm just saying. I'm not going to fake it. What? Bet that smelled like a brand new yo-yo. Like a brand new yo-yo. Then I leave the studio and I'm talking about her bush with her managers. You were? Yeah, because when we were setting this whole thing up, I was stupid enough. I was on the phone with her handlers. Handlers? And I said, does she have a 70s Earth mama momma? So then Christina goes, see, I don't have a 70s Earth mama momma. And I go, I see. She showed you? By your picture. Oh, the picture. All the pictures we have here. We have her in every single pose possible. But she wouldn't get naked. That's all right. Yeah. It actually was better that she didn't get naked this time. Sometimes it's cool to not see a girl naked. Sometimes you just sit there and you sit. Sometimes. When? You are. When? When you're with a guy. You got me. Shut up. You ass. You know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you lead a little to the imagination. She had a little half t-shirt on. The artsy party guy leads to the imagination. Man, that would have been great if she would have taken her clothes off. What are you, stupid? What are you, silly? I didn't see you asking. I wasn't going to ask because I knew that she wouldn't. All right. I'm not going to push. Well, if she's still listening, come back and get naked for us. How's that? You have to go to college. I'm going to buy you a rock. Thanks. Yeah, yeah. She'll come back. It wasn't a matter at that point. She's going to college. She's a college girl going for accounting. How could you say she's dumb? You don't know her. Cute. Okay. Cute. So we got Phyllis in the studio. I really didn't know her. I really didn't know you were still here. I'm sorry, Phyllis. I really apologize. You might remember Phyllis. You're totally beautiful. I love you. You're great. We called up last week after we had Steven Tyler on the phone, and she wants 15 minutes alone with Steven Tyler for whatever her reasons. I don't know. I don't even care. But she wants 15 minutes alone with him. We figured, let her come in. We'll take a look at her. But who are we to judge? So we put her pictures up on our underground website and have the audience judge. Phyllis, if you had 15 minutes with Steven, would you go for it? Definitely. If it was a Tuesday, would he be a club member? Let's just say that. I want to talk to the man. Wow, she wants to sing into the microphone. Alright, so the pictures we took of Phyllis, we took a couple seductive shots. We took seductive and... I had something in my throat. I'm sorry. Oh my God. What? He doesn't know. At least he didn't call me dumb as a box of rocks. You're actually pretty intelligent. Well, thank you. So we took a couple seductive shots of Phyllis and we took some shots with certain tests that she had to perform. Because we figured Steven Tyler, his lips are pretty big so we made you kiss a plunger just so you could get the feel for how it would be. So we got that shot on there. We also looked at her technique with a banana because we all know Steven likes that. She almost failed that test because she started using her teeth. What's wrong with you? What was up with that? You know teeth is a no-no with that. Alright, you caught me off guard there. Alright, so the pictures are up. You've got to make your lips look like Charles Bronson. Alright, alright. Hey, you know like sucking over your teeth. Charles Bronson. Hey, like that. Hey, I'll get out of this prison camp. Do a tunnel. You know, you've got to suck your lips. Yeah, don't do that. Oh, you're funny. And Anthony came up with a celebrity. You look like Karen Allen. Yeah, she kind of looks like Karen Allen. That's the chick from the first Indiana Jones movie. You're definitely very good looking. And she was in Animal House. She played Boone's girlfriend and she slept with the professor guy there. Donald Sutherland. You've got to see her butt in that. Hey, you've got to plug your company because your boss is really good. You've got to see Donald Sutherland's butt. Ew. That's a little different. I work for a structural steel company called Molten Metal. Alright. Molten Metal. So we'll say hi to the gang down there. So the pictures are up and running. I think there's a couple ways to get to them now finally through our underground website if you've got that address. And Scott Colombo came through, gave us a call and he's linking it right to the WNAW website. Yeah, so you go to the NAW website and click on our pictures and there should be some link to the studio cam we're going to call it. We're going to leave it up there because every once in a while we're going to start doing this with the technology. Alright, so what do the listeners think of Phyllis and the shots we took of her, Anthony? Well, we got a couple of positives. Hey, give her a shot. Give her the 15 minutes. I like that. How many? Phyllis can you handle honesty from our listeners? Of course I can. Continue, Anthony. Alright, this guy says maybe she could get five minutes with Joey Kramer, but definitely not five minutes with Steven Tyler. That's alright. It all depends what Steve is used to. Is it youth or a particular look he's interested in? And this guy's voting for your enthusiasm. He says yes. Look at that. This guy wants to offer you a job as a CPA? That was the gallery blockhead. I think you're confused. You want the gallery girl. Something tells me she wouldn't be able to balance the books. Who cares? He's probably done worse, but the one she looks like is Robin Bird from New York Cable. Yes, a little bit with dark hair. A little bit. Just a little. You're not as scuzzy as her. She's nasty. That's nasty. Maybe Robin Bird 20 years ago. Looks like she has potential. Look at that. No one really committing. No one really going for the yeah. Oh wait a minute. I think Phyllis is hot. Andrew, I think Phyllis is hot. How old is she? Thank you, Andrew. I would like to see if I could get her mind off Steven Tyler. Wow. Okay. Andy loves having us in New York too. Thank you, Andy. Thank you very much. Oh, wow. No, next person. You have to have one. You have to. Uh-oh. Is Phyllis worthy? Nope, not with those teeth. Phyllis, what's... I'm calling him as I see him, honey. Right on. Looks like Mick Jagger. I've never heard that one. But then if you look like Mick Jagger and you kiss Steven Tyler, that could cause a vacuum that would never come apart. Show a better picture, but let her at him. She had the balls to come into the studio. We should get at least 15 minutes with him. We do give you credit for that, Phyllis. Yeah, well... That's the hardest part. Okay. It is a little difficult to come in here. Uh, what have you guys got against Steven Tyler? This woman is totally unworthy. I say no way. Oh. I'm just going one right after the other. Let's see that one. It's right here. No, I mean that person. Oh. Show more tits. That's another one. Totally what I expected. Well, but... I know. I understand. I vote nay. No, she's either real ugly or that's a lousy picture. Oh, Phyllis, the tides are changing fast here for you. That's how it is. It's like Wall Street. You can start up in the morning and by the end of the day you're ready to jump out a window, huh? I'm telling you. We're re-upping. Hey, guys, what the F? She looks like Joe Perry. Joe Perry? These are bad pictures. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. These are bad pictures. That is not a very good picture of her. Wow, my God. How old is she? Sixty-seven? Oh, my God. I'm just reading them as they're popping on the screen. What happened to the good ones, Anthony? Only if she could put a whole cucumber in her mouth. It's just getting brutal. These are listeners. What can I say, Phyllis? We love them. All right. Okay. We should have used the heart lens when we took the photographs of you. What? Lastly, well, for now, anyway, no way. There's a lot of Os and Ys on the no and way. I don't think they really are. You don't know what the heart lenses are? In all their videos, the lenses have a lot of Vaseline and stuff to help out the pictures. No. You never heard that? No, I never heard that. You heard that one? No. They kind of smear Vaseline on it or something. It looks like a circus mirror. We're not saying that. All right, Phyllis. People could still vote. They can go to the WNAW website. Okay. Now, for everybody that already looked and voted, we're going to take a whole new group of pictures. I want better lighting. I think it's to your benefit. I don't think they're getting the true you out of these pictures. I'm going to get better lighting. We're going to take like six more pictures and get the real you on this because I don't think some of these people are seeing you. They're not seeing the Karen Allen cute girl from Animal House. Anthony can do wonders. Trust me. Look what he's done for me. Show me love. Show me love now. All right. Well, continue staring at the pictures and seeing if Phyllis is worthy or not to hang with, see what's out for 15 minutes. Okay? I think the link should be up on the WNAW website so you can get to the pictures through there. I'm happy these people are officially crashing our website. We're freezing up. We're jamming up on the NAW website. But keep trying. You can see pictures of Phyllis. We're putting her picture on the page to see if she's worthy for 15 minutes with Steven Tyler. Stick around. We're going to read some emails too, some of your responses to Phyllis' pictures. All right. In the meantime, it's Super Tuesday with Pink Floyd. Hi, NAW. What's up? It's Tuesday! It's time for Tuesday Night Homer! You are excited! That's right, baby. Hey, listen, let me come down there and let that girl induct me into the Tuesday Night Homer Club, man. Hey, how are you, man? Are you officially a member of the club or are you going to be a member tonight? I hope to be a member tonight. Oh, wow. Good luck, brother. Thank you. All right. Take it easy. Anthony, look how excited everyone is. Oh, they love it. It's time for the Tuesday Night Homer Club. A lot of people heading home hoping to be inducted into our lovely little club this evening. We're just asking the ladies. The guy gets home tonight. Little Homer action. When was the last time you heard someone that excited driving home? See how happy he was? What time is it? He was happy at the prospect of the whole thing that he might get one. Fantastic. Very good. It's a holiday every week, once a week. Phyllis, if you're a faithful listener of the show, you might remember she wants 15 minutes alone with Steven Tyler. Now, we know Steven Tyler is coming down to hang with us when the band comes to town December 27th. We decided to invite Phyllis down to our show to see what she was all about, to see if she was worthy enough to have 15 minutes with Steven Tyler. Anthony took some photographs of the lovely Phyllis who looks like Karen Allen. I think so. From the Raiders of the Lost Ark movie. I think you're cuter than that. Thank you. You've got very dark hair, you've got blue eyes, huge candies. Well, I can tell. You're wearing like a bear though. Yeah, you're wearing a lot of black. That's like a bear skin rug you're wearing. Smart. Okay, but you've got the nice candies working. We asked about, did we ask you about your hoop? No. What? How's your hoop? Do you have a nice hoop? We're just all drinking coffee hanging out. Oh, she gets you coffee and everything and you're asking about her hoop? For one, I'm not even sure I know what that means, but I'm sure it's not that good. Probably not. This is just stuff I ask women. How's your hoop? What? What the heck's wrong with you guys? I've never asked a woman how her hoop is. And this phone's been ringing that she's got. Okay, so Anthony took some photographs of her. And you can get to the photographs through the WNEW website. Click on Air Staff and go to our pictures. After that you'll get the live studio cam and the pictures that we have taken. We took a bunch of photographs. We took what, Anthony? I don't know, I took six earlier and then we put up another six right now. Different poses, different moods, different lighting, seductive shots. My favorite was the picture of you kissing the plunger. Right? Well, I mean, you know, Steven Tyler, you want 15 minutes with him? We figured, you know, you should start practicing on the plunger. He's got those big ass lips of his. Are we annoying you? Are we interrupting something? Are we disturbing you, Phyllis? Do you have an annoying cell phone for the entire class? Yes, I do. I feel like I'm on the train and I'm trying to get a few minutes sleep and the guy next to me has to talk to people. All right, and then we took the picture of you and the banana to see what your technique was all about. All things that I'm sure Steven Tyler would be curious about, Anthony. Of course. Okay, so we've sent the pictures out there and the listeners have had a chance to look at them now and digest the photographs. I'm shutting it off. Oh, my dear sweetie. Take that away from her. That's it, I'm going off, gone. That's what you said three times, Phyllis. Nice belly, by the way. That was very cute. I like that. What do you need that for, that phone? Okay, listen. So what are the listeners saying about Phyllis? Is she worthy 15 minutes with Steven Tyler, Anthony? Well, the listeners are speaking. We've gotten the email. Let's see, Opie and Anthony. I say give her the 15 minutes. Wow, look at that. She looks like a relative of Steven Tyler anyway. And thanks for the bottom left photo. It's the only shot you can assume, a breast size. If Steven isn't available, I think I could spare 15 minutes. See you, Jason. Look at that. You got a little fan in Jason. All right, let me keep track. So Jason likes you. Jason likes you. Jason thinks you're worthy. Okay, worthy, not worthy. Go ahead, Ian. All right. Good. This is our listeners. We love them. They're honest as us. See, I'm not pre-reading these. Okay. When she said 36, 24, 36, what she meant, 36 Big Macs for breakfast, 26, 24, 26, 26, 24, 26 Big Macs for breakfast, 24, lunch, another 36 for dinner. Those are bad pictures. Even Clinton wouldn't do her. Okay. Oh my God. I believe that would be in the not worthy column. See, that's just someone being a smart ass, because you're not fat. When she said, you should be sticking up for Anthony. You're sitting here next to me. I'm just reading him as they come out. Don't slouch. They make him look even worse. Did you tell her, what? Just sit up straight. All right, go ahead, Anthony. Did you tell her her photos would be on the web because she didn't dress for it? But she does look like she has potential. See, I think you did yourself a grave disservice with that sweater. I really do. I think you're better than that. That's because I wasn't going to go that route. Okay. I believe that would be the worthy category. Worthy. I say go for it. I say go for it, Phyllis, and good luck. Whoa, look at that. Look at that. Okay, another worthy. Likes you there. All right, Anthony. She is still a fox, but the lighting isn't very good, but she is worthy. Look at this. Four worthy, one not worthy so far. I like it. Stop. Phyllis is hot, but she doesn't look like Karen Allen. No? No. I don't see that either. You have a very sexy voice, by the way, Phyllis. Has anyone told you that? She does look like Joe Perry. Oh. Now that would be a not worthy. I'm sorry, Phyllis. Okay, not worthy. Go ahead, Anthony. Joe Perry not worthy, really? Well, because Joe Perry is a guy. You don't want to look like Joe Perry. Well, right, but he's not. Joe Perry is a good guy. All right? You just don't want to look like him. Hey, and now that I'm looking a little closer to you, you've got that full man shoe work just like him, too. Oh, stop. Oh, oh, phew. All right, sorry. Go ahead, Anthony. You're terrible. Isn't he, though? Go ahead. Is she wearing a mask? What? Well, Phyllis, I do believe that would be another not worthy. I'm sorry. Probably. Hit on that picture. Okay, not worthy. All right, Anthony, go ahead. Are you guys nuts? That's annoying. She looks like a priest in drag. What? I don't even know what that means. You're right. It's the black. The black is hurting you. All right. I don't even know what that means. Okay. Taking a while here. Looks good to me. Ron Flowers. Wow. Phyllis, you're still ahead. Six worthy? No way. Four not worthy. She doesn't stand a chance. The only chance she has is with that plunger. And you guys laugh. Well, Phyllis, I do believe that would be a not worthy. No, that's not. That's annoying. Probably. This mail server is working very slow. I understand. That's what I'm saying. Okay. Well, we're getting swamped with email about to... Whoa, Phyllis, breathe heavy again. Yeah. That was kind of nice. Show some skin. Skin to win. Skin to win, Phyllis. Guys want to see skin. No? Okay. No? All right. I don't know. I think it would be good. We'll continue reading the email, I guess, Anthony. No way. Steve would definitely not dive into that. Oh, this guy gives you three reasons. Number one, teats. Where the hell are they? Reason number two, that voice. Yikes. Sounds like Linda Tripp. Reason number three, she's a man, baby. Baby? Oh my God. That guy doesn't like you at all. I'd like to see you. All right. I'm sorry about that, Phyllis, but that would be another not worthy. That's okay. Well, the subject alone is good. Are you effing nuts? Are you... you're kidding, right? I've seen smaller chins on female lesbian bodybuilders. Oh, that would be another not worthy. I'm sorry, Phyllis. That is so bizarre. Phyllis has a better chance handing out free Tuesday night hummers than getting her 15 minutes of fame with Steven Tyler. Oh, that's not nice. Oh, I deserve this for coming here. I really deserve this. Well, unfortunately, the tide has changed at this point, Phyllis. It's bad. I... Okay. Well, what do you have against Steven Tyler? Phyllis? Hey, you guys didn't say you would have Creepella Gruesome from the Flintstones in the studio. Oh, come on. Creepella Gruesome? That's... All right. All right, Phyllis. I'm really sorry. Phyllis, you were doing so well, too. I'll tell you the truth. I apologize for our listeners. I'm really sorry. We love them, but they're as honest as we are. I knew what you were saying. I'm really sorry. I just let you guys talk to me. Steven Tyler let her have 15 minutes with Steven Spielberg. Maybe he can do something with that face. Holy... Well, you gotta be kidding me. Phyllis, things have drastically changed here. I don't know what to say to you. I'm done. Okay. It's like professional wrestling. Just when you think the guy's winning at the beginning, you're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. I think she's had enough, Anthony. She's taken her shots. Steven Tyler's had a hard enough life with drugs and all. He doesn't need this. You know, I think you're paying. It would put him back on. I want to read some of those myself. No, Anthony would never. I'm not. Read the bad ones. I'm reading. I've known Anthony a long time. He's very fair. He wouldn't read all the bad ones. Okay. I'm pretty honest. And we gotta thank everybody for participating with this today. We're getting swamped. Yes. And we'll continue reading the email as the show continues here. All right? What does this guy mean? What? I don't think so. And then he writes, woof, woof. Now, Phyllis. Anthony, you should be sticking up for me. I don't know. I'm trying. I'm just reading them as they're coming in. Yes. So, well, we'll stop the voting right there. Yeah. As of now, what are we looking like, though? It's not looking good. It's not good now. No, it's really not looking good. I think we could get you 15 minutes alone with Lemmy from Motorhead at this point. Oh, my God. Lemmy from Motorhead. Well, I mean, what can I tell you? The not-worthy is up to 20, the worthy is like 6. Well, you didn't count the first round. All right, Phyllis. Well, listen, for coming in, we're going to take care of you. You've got a lovely, open Anthony t-shirt with our baby faces on it. This is awful. What does that one say, Anthony? I don't want to know. Go ahead. The guys are complaining that the site was crashing out, the N.E.W. site, but everybody's back on. The pictures on your secret underground site offer an image of a middle-aged skank who, if she dyed her hair Frightwig White, might bear a good resemblance to Carole Miller. Oh, my God. If you think you wouldn't be... What? If you think that wouldn't be something... Oh, come on. Wait, don't leave, Phyllis. Don't leave. If she made contact with Steve, his lips would shrivel and fall off. Where the F do you guys come up with these freaks? Rock on, Frank. Now, Frank, I don't think that's... Rock on. Rock on. I don't think that's appropriate. Opie sipping his coffee? Do you think that's an inappropriate comment? Well, I'm trying to be nice. No, of course not. Wow. On that brutal note, that had to be the worst one yet. I'm good. You're good? Yes. Okay. All right, here's the deal. Wow. We're going to give you the Opie and Anthony t-shirt. We're going to give you the new live Aerosmith CD, right? He did. You got that? Yes, he did. And for being a sport, it breaks my heart, but I'm going to give you a pair of tickets to see Aerosmith. Very cool. How's that cool? That's wonderful. That's cool for you, Phyllis. The camera doesn't do it justice. She kind of looks like Steven Tyler. She's a good sport. Give her 15 minutes. See? We still like it. We gave her tickets, the latest CD, a t-shirt. You did. And when Steven comes to town, we'll try to work something out, all right? We'll have you come up. All right. I'm facing you. I've got enough. You've got some set of balls, Phyllis. I've got to give you that. I'm coming up here. All right. It's due for Tuesday. On the way, some Kiss. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, with the tapes coming out today. We figured we'd break out that little ditty. Oh, yeah. And in honor of Tuesday night Hummers, that's an appropriate song as well, right, Anthony? Sure. I guess everyone has heard the tapes by now, you think, Anthony? I think so. Of course, the Linda Tripp tape. She made Monica Lewinsky's phone calls. What a great friend, huh? Yeah. I hope Linda Tripp gets hit by a Mack truck. Like I said, she looks like she already has. Yeah. You hear Monica's voice for the first time. Everybody was wondering what she would sound like. Mm-hmm. And do we have a tape of that? Yeah. What do you think of her voice, though? I don't know. It's kind of, you know, hot. Hot? Yeah. Really? Not according to this clip. This is exclusive audio of Monica Lewinsky talking to Linda Tripp. It's really hard to distinguish who is who in this clip here. Sounded good. What? Why is everyone laughing at me? It's kind of hot. This is actual audio of Monica and Linda. All right. Which clip is this? See, right there, she's getting really mad. Look, look, look. I think the translation right there is, you bastard. So we have to build it and call her back. She's upset. All right. Well, we got audio, I guess, here. Yes, we could play. She had phone sex with Bill Clinton at some point. Yeah. And you could understand by hearing a voice that, yeah, that could be good. You'd go for it, right? You just don't put it to that bottom first. Well, I got the clip of her crying and really losing it, almost like Corky Steinbrenner did after he won the World Series. This is the best scene in baseball. Yeah. Well, Monica is probably better than Corky Steinbrenner with her emotions. Yeah, she starts weeping. Yeah, and what you've got to keep in mind when you hear this piece of tape, she's talking about the President of the United States. Yeah, not her junior high prom date. That she saw at the mall with another girl. All right, take a listen to this. Oh, my God. It's too much for one person. Oh, it is too much for one person. Yes, it is. Okay. He's going to go home. She's at a dinner. So if he calls you, you would have to call you before she gets home. So, Monica, I'm just saying that we have to at least consider the possibility that he's going to call you tonight. But he's not going to call. Because he's thinking, like, why do you think he's thinking I called to see what's going on? Yeah. He doesn't understand. He doesn't know what the problem is. No, so he's going to think I've called to find out what he's done so far. And he's just sending. Just sending to see. He's just sending to see. There's nothing to say. There's nothing to say. And there's nothing to say. There's nothing to say. There's nothing to say. Are you saying she sounds a lot like Linda Lavin? Just that little last clip where she was doing some jazz singing thing. There's nothing to say. Alright! That was all about. Alright. Isn't that great? Bobby was at the gap and I came out and I saw him break up and he was with another guy. The President! The President of the United States! Not the captain of the football team! Do you believe her? She's crying to her little friend about the President of the United States of America. You gave him a hummer. Whatever happens, happens. Walk away. She's bawling her eyes out like he was going to put a pin on her and invite her into Air Force One. What the hell did she think? I don't believe it! He's not going to call me! Give it a rest. Where's the other one really fast? This is the tape of Monica talking about what Bill only lasts in a minute or something like that. Crew walked out, came in, came in finally and he had like one minute. What was happening then? He had a President, what's his name? The Mexico guy, Zedillo. Oh, waiting for him. No kidding. So how was it? It was so nothing that you can't even grade it. Because it was so quick. Yeah. Fidel Castro, right? That's what you were saying? You've got to think that Linda Tripp was at home talking to Monica using a plunger on herself. So how was it? What a mess. I don't know who the bigger mess is there. Well obviously Monica's a disturbed little girl. And Linda Tripp is just the sea hag. It's the sea hag. Look out for the sea hag. She'll take your phone calls. She wants to hear about the hummers. Alright, very good. Cute little audio tape there. The sea hag will blow me down. Okay, this is a good show today. Like I care. Alright, it's 2 for Tuesday, up next Kiss. Welcome to the show! The Rock of New York 1027 WNAW, 2 for Tuesday with Kiss Psycho Circus. And calling Dr. Love before that. Yes! It's open Anthony, a lot of cool concerts coming to town. Kiss being one of the bigger ones. We're going to have the boys from Kiss in Monday. Can't wait to meet the whole band. We've talked to Paul Stanley in the past. We've talked to Gene Simmons in the past. I want to go to a mall with Chris. It'll be cool having them all up here. Actually can't wait. And then we've got Aerosmith coming to town, Dave Matthews Band, Blues Traveler. Things are happening. Alright, well tonight is the night, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. I believe that new memberships are taking place as we speak, Anthony. I think it's safe to say that at this moment in time. Yeah, I would say so. It's been happening all day. It's Hummer Tuesday. I got an email from Hoover. That's any sign. Says, since the love of my life's offered to become a member of the Hummer Club with the whore beast he's been seeing instead of me, that gives me free rein to initiate a few members for you. Oh nice! I'll be in the city late tonight, Obey. Maybe I can help you out. They don't call me Hoover for nothing. You know what? There's a girl I knew, her name was... Hoover? Yeah. And she bragged, she liked her nickname a lot. And her whole deal was... Well... How can you put this, man? Well, I worked at a club and you know, a bunch of bartenders and stuff. Just a bunch of people. And she was a regular and her name was Hoover. And her claim to fame was that no guy could last more than 60 seconds. Ah, I got you. Kind of like the rodeo where you try to hold on. Yeah. Well, I lost. A bunch of other people lost. Really? I just share that with everybody. What was his name? Boy, that's not getting old, Anthony. It's not. Hi, NW. Hi. How are you? I'm an official, huh, Matt? You are? What's your name? Joy. Hey Joy, congratulations. I'm on a commute. It's like an hour. And you make me laugh so hard. It's so funny. My girlfriend is also an official, huh, Matt? And she's dubbed the Snake Charmer. She's dubbed the Snake Charmer? Yes, she is the Snake Charmer. So hi to the Snake Charmer if she's out there listening. Very nice. Keep up the good work, you guys. Oh, you keep up the good work. And I just let you guys know you have the sexiest voices too. You are hot. Thank you, babe. I love you. Well, thanks a lot. We really appreciate that. We know we have our supporters out there. We always talk about the negative part of trying to build an audience. But we know there's some people out there that like us. Oh, everybody does. You're the best. And we appreciate that. We love you. Well, the bumper stickers are coming soon, so make sure you get one on your car, all right? Okay. I love you. Bye. Do you want to take another one here real fast? All right. Hi, AW. Hey, listen, I want to join the club. You want to join the club? You got to help me out, though. All right, what do you want me to do? I want you to call my wife. I can call your wife. You can? Yeah, but I got to warn you. She's tough. She's a tough cookie, huh? That's why it's good to use somebody like us. All right, what's her name? Hello? Mickey? Yeah. It's Opien Anthony from WNEW Radio. Holy s***. How are you? I'm good, how are you? You guys are live on the air. I have to tell you that. Okay. All right? Yeah. So what do you think of your husband? I think he's wonderful. Ah, that's great. I need a little help tonight. Oh, you think so? Yeah. In what way? Well, have you heard about the Tuesday Night Harmer Club? No, I haven't. Well, Anthony, I think you should explain the Tuesday Night Harmer Club. Well, we were talking one day about relationships and being married. How long you guys been together? Almost 10 years. 10 years, see? You got some kids? Yes. You know, sometimes romance takes a back seat. You got to agree with that, right? I think it's the same as it was when you were first dating. Okay. You know, maybe both of you aren't doing certain things that you used to do. Okay. All right, and so how about it? Can you give him a harmer tonight? Sure, I must provide I get one back. Oh, well that sounds like a bargain. All right, no problem. Look at that. That's your tough nut to crack? Your husband's on the line. Hi, babe. Hi, how are you? All right, honey, I'll see you when you get home. You guys are great. Thanks a lot. Another happy harmer. You got it. Another happy harmer, you got that right. Would you like to talk to your wife for a minute here? Yeah, sure. Thanks, guys. Hello. Hi, babe. I don't know, we might still be on the air, but we can do this tonight. Yeah, sure we can. Now I want to get off of them on the air. All right, I'll see you when I get home. All right. All right, it's a date. All right, bye. Well, there you go. All right, thanks, guys. Congrats, you got yourself a harmer. Hey, she wasn't that hard, was she? Not at all. Hey, what's your favorite harmer station? Well, it's WNEW. All right, brother. Hey, listen, two for Tuesday, right? Yeah. I'll call my friend's wife. Really? Opie and Anthony. 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. You too, when love comes to town. Rattle and hum. Name of the CD, great CD by you too, by the way. Oktong Baby. Even better than the real thing from you too before that. Two really good albums from you too. Actually, the last real good album from you too is Oktong Baby. One man's opinion. Huge you too fan, please. Zeropa. I'm a fan of you too. I'm a fan of you too. Zeropa. All right. I forgot the name of the other album. Errol, what was the other? Pop. Yeah, pop. Errol knows everything. Anything about music, man. Just talk to Errol. Hey, Errol, have you been standing out on the corner 57th and 7th to check out the meteor shower? No. That's supposed to be tonight. Yeah, let me take a look. Any meteors out there helping? Get a good look. What do you got? Nothing. Cloudy. Clouds. How come every time there's a celestial event, it's always cloudy around here? All the time. Ever since I was growing up, I wanted to see all this cool stuff they talk about. Hey, it's going to be a lunar eclipse tonight. Just check out the northeast horizon. Oh, clouds. Comet Calhotec. Tonight, the sun is going to be shining. Calhotec. Tonight. I love when the comments come through. It's like, you know, look to the southwest skies and you'll see it. And you're squinting and squinting. You see a stupid dot and you're like, that's it. It's like, oh, yeah, great. That was worth it. They get this nerd of a, it's a bit of history in the making right now. It's a great time to be alive. And then they make us feel so insignificant like this whole shower thing. You know, the next time you'll be able to see this is 33 years from now. So you better take a look. Take a gander. No, thanks. They're pre-positioning all of the communication satellites too. So they don't get hit by any of these things. No. Little BB sized meteor smokey. Thanks. Yeah. All right. There's a lady on the line. Hi, N.E.W. Hey, how are you? Good. I just want to let my husband know on his long commute coming home that he's going to join the Hummer Club tonight. Oh, yeah. What's your husband's name? His name. And where is he driving right now? Oh, he's hopefully on the tap and seat right now. Oh, and you're just waiting for him at home? Oh, he's by the doorway getting all hot and tired. Wow. Would you have done this if it wasn't for us? You know, you've encouraged me because sometimes I just get so tired. You know, the time you crash into bed and you just fall asleep. It's like, oh, come on. Yeah, you realize that... You know, it's like schedule. That's good. That's good. Yeah, it's a little icebreaker, isn't it? Yeah, well, I've been at it for a while. You got a little outfit on? Oh, yeah. What do you got on? Not for you to know, honey. He is going to be so happy, man. I think so. He always comes home with a smile and says, is anyone listening to you guys? So what's the move as soon as he opens the door? Oh, like, oh, I can't say. You're on the air, aren't you? Yeah, you are on the air. I'm in the jungle, babe, just like in the jungle. Oh, pounce on him. Bring home that bread and butter and... Like a tiger on a gazelle. Reenact that scene from Sea of Love. Sea of Love? Yeah, Al Pacino. Throws What's-Your-Name up against the wall. Oh, you just get so dirty sometimes. You know, it's that laugh that you have. The girl said your voice is very sexy. It's that laugh. It's that nasty boy laugh. It's tedious. It's not fake. But before Ed gets into the driveway, I reveal that he's on his way home. So I just hope he got this message. All right, congratulations in advance. You guys obviously are going to join the Tuesday Night Hummer Club probably within the hour. Well, maybe after dinner. All right. Thanks, guys. Bye-bye. It's scary to think that people are actually listening to us. They're doing this. I wonder how many hummers have taken place because of you and I. Oh, we're not trying it. We're not telling people to go out there and whack each other over the heads with hammers. This is something people like. It's an enjoyable thing. And we're just reminding people that it's a great thing and should be done. Yes. And people seem to be receptive. The Tuesday Night Hummer Club with Opie and Anthony. Gotta love it. I hope you remember. If not, maybe tonight will be your lucky night. And even if there is, you don't get it tonight, but you know that it's just seven days away from the next chance. You might just get it. Remember, there's meetings every Tuesday night if you're a member of the club already. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you could be a two-time member, three-time, you know. When we get those bumper stickers, we'll have to have some way where you can check off how many times. Like a fighter plane back in World War II. You paint the Jap flags on the side. Yeah. You just put like a splooge mark on the side of your car. All right. You had to say that. Why? I thought we were all having fun. What happened? Getting a ton of requests for the chocolate salty ball song as well. Oh, yeah. We'll do that. And a couple from ACDC next. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. Two for Tuesday, R.E.M., Bang and Blame, and Orange Crush from the Green CD. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey. Just about out the door, huh? Just about, huh? Do we have time to help out one more couple before we leave? Oh, I think so. Tonight is the big night. The Tuesday Night Hummer Club with Opie and Anthony. Tonight is the big night. The Tuesday Night Hummer Club will be meeting. Hopefully we'll gain a bunch of new members tonight. I'm sure people are joining as we speak, Anthony. That or rushing home to their loved ones. You know, there's meetings every week, every Tuesday night. And you've got to make as many meetings as possible. What time membership? It would be nice. But we've got a fax here from Ed. Help me please. If you guys could call my wife for me, it sure would help. I'm going to be in the middle of the night. I'm going to be in the middle of the night. If you guys could call my wife for me, it sure would help. I got nowhere last week, but a blank stare from her. Oh, that's the worst. Alright, let's call her up. Her name's Deanne. For Ed. Hello? Hi, Deanne. It's Opie and Anthony from N.E.W. Really? Yeah, how are you? Sorry, I have a crying baby here. Oh. Well, Ed wanted us to give you a call. Oh, yeah? No, Ed is still at work. Really? Poor guy. He probably works real hard, huh? Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Poor guy works... Ed wanted you to give me a call, huh? Yeah, Ed works pretty hard during the day, huh? Yeah, he usually is. Yeah, I bet. Comes home, he's not quite as relaxed as he could be, right? Don't tell me you're calling about that Tuesday thing. Well, Ed... Jigs up. Ed was hoping that we could talk you into a little action tonight. Okay. You know, ever since the kids were born, you two just don't seem to... You know, it's not like it used to be, let's say. Well, you know, it's kind of hard with kids crying in the background and all that kind of thing, you know? That's just it. I think you've got to recapture some of those passionate moments. Well, we're trying, we're trying. Yeah, but I think a real good thing is that you're not just a little kid crying in the background. You're not just a little kid crying in the background. You're not just a little kid crying in the background. You're not just a little kid crying in the background. And we're trying. Yeah, but I think a real good way would be with a Hummer. It is Tuesday after all. It is. And I know Ed, it really has, you know, he's kind of thrown some hints my way, you know? Ah, see? What kind of hints has he thrown your way? Oh, like telling me, hey, did you hear about that Hummerglock? Almost like, those wacky kids, huh? God, could you believe those two idiots? So, what do you think? Well, hey, you know, he's going to be a real good guy. He's going to be a real good guy. He's going to be a real good guy. Well, hey, you know, he's going to be getting home late tonight, but I think we could work something out. He would really like to become a member of this club. And of course, you'll be a member as well. Oh, hey, hey. And we've encouraged Ed to reciprocate in whatever way will make you feel good. Oh, hey, I think that's only fair. Whether that's like something sexual you like or maybe something you need done around the house, whatever it's going to take to make you smile as well. That's the way, OP. Stuff around the house. Something around the house. You're getting off course with this thing. I'm sure Ed is listening. What would you like Ed to do for you if you accomplish this feat for him tonight? Well, you know, I think he could get creative. There you go. See, he's a woman that's been married, has kids, and she kind of misses the old days with that sexual promiscuity that you used to have, right? Hey, wait a minute. Promiscuity? Wrong word, Anthony. You know, when you used to run around like a madwoman. With my husband, right? Yes, of course. Oh, yes, sure. What would you like to happen? Because I'm sure Ed's listening. Well, you know, something done around the house is always nice. You know, it's amazing what can turn a married woman with kids on. You know, there's something sexy about having your husband vacuum. Oh, oh. Oh, trade one Hoover for another. So if Ed promises to vacuum, it'll happen tonight? Yeah, I think he could count on it. Oh, make him vacuum naked. Okay. Make him vacuum naked with tap shoes on or something. Say something real stupid. So, Dan, what's the odds? Well, I'd say the odds are pretty high. Nice. All right, give us a percentage. Oh, gosh, what, 95%? That's pretty good. Very good. You know, we're going to call you tomorrow and make sure this happens. Okay. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. All right. Well, you guys have fun tonight, you wacky kids. Okay. All right, Deanne. Bye. Bye. Bye. We have another love connection, Anthony. I hope so. That was sounding a little evasive, Opie. I don't know. A little evasive. I don't know. That 5% is going to kick in with I'm tired. That was with the kids all day. Well, we'll follow it up tomorrow. We'll give Deanne a call and see if the deed was accomplished. Make sure. And if their members are not, okay? Got to thank, what was her name, Kristian? Kristin? Kristin. Kristin Morrison from Gallery Magazine. Gallery Magazine. She won the girl next door. Of the year. Of the year. She was hot. Yeah, she was very hot. Nice little crapper on her. Yes. I hated that. Hey, nice dumpa. When I was in construction, I used to hear things like that all the time. Well, I was stupid enough to ask her, how's her hoop? How's her hoop? I'm going to ask a girl how, I don't even know what that means, but whatever. All right, well, thanks for listening. Also, thank Phyllis for coming down, taking the abuse. Yeah, that was cool. We started something new here where we're going to be popping pictures up on the website.
