 20W the Rock of New York. Good afternoon, it's Opie and it's Anthony. I just reached a milestone with that song, Anthony. A milestone in your life? That was the 20,000th time I've heard that song on the radio. Really? 20,000th time. That's a lot. I'm keeping track of it. Yeah, it's a very important song to play. A very special song to play during the evolution of the rock in New York. We're in the year 1982. We're stuck in the year 1982 right now. Our nightmare continues. Our nightmare continues, yes. Oh, Carol Miller hates us. Plug in your headphones, Carol. Carol is going to be representative of the people that appreciate this music and this special program, the evolution of the rock of New York, that has been put together here on WNAW. There we go. Now, Opie's cracking up the delay. What do you expect? I'm cursing Opie. We're all professionals here. No, I got to wait for a delay. I need at least eight seconds. Well, get over it. She's scared of the stand next to you, Anthony. No, no, you stay over there. No, no, stay over there. No, you've got your technical stuff together, don't you? All right, so what problem did you have with us yesterday, Carol? You. I had a problem with you, the two of you. What happened? I'm just kidding. She didn't like the fact that Anthony was playing the kazoo to all these great classic rock tunes. I think they needed kazoo. These cheesy, butt-old classic rock songs. Yeah, how can we go from a week before we start this special goofing on butt-old rock and then we go into butt-old rock and we're supposed to act like we liked it? Listen, first of all, it's a matter of opinion, but a lot of this stuff, including the stuff that you were ranking on yesterday, I mean, I really dig this stuff. I was playing it for people. Of course, people will dig this stuff. And you know something? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I dig this stuff too when I heard it on NAW, but I don't want to hear it anymore. I want to move on. I want to move on to the future. Yeah, well, I want to hear it. What do you want to hear? Third Eye Meatball Blind? No, I want to hear the latest from the Black Crows. I want to hear the latest from Kiss. Yeah, so? The latest from the Rolling Stones. We can't play any of that this week because we have to play Marshall Crenshaw someday, some way. Well, I think this is a good trip down a recent memory lane. We've been doing that for 31 years. 31 years here at NAW. This has been a classic rock station for many years. We've been going down memory lanes. Most of these people have every single one of these CDs at home. If they want to take a trip down memory lane, then they should play it at home. You should go talk at home. Oh, that hurts. Oh my God. Do you realize NAW has to be competitive in New York City? Do you realize it's been stagnating like a pool of green water with chinch bugs in it? Let me tell you all something. I'm not the management here, neither are you. But if it's been stagnating, I've been stagnating here for the last how many years, and I still love the music. There's a lot of people that want to hear it. How many listeners did we gain today by going down memory lane playing Marshall Crenshaw someday, some way? Marshall Crenshaw did a really nice Christmas concert for us. Who cares? They don't care anymore. A lot of people do. This is the music that has gotten us to 23rd place. No, no, no, no. Yes, it is. For God's sake, Carol. If we played most of this music, we wouldn't be in 23rd place. Oh my God. You're on crack. I'm not on crack. There's a lot of music. Are you having a flashback? Did you do acid back in the 60s? No, I wish I did. Are you having a flashback? This is not the music that is going to get us into first place. This isn't the attitude of the station that's going to get us into the top ten. Jock's doing good segues and playing this crap is not going to get us out of the basement of New York Radio. We are talking about music here. A lot of the stuff that we're playing on this special is a lot of the meat and potato stuff that people haven't heard in a long time. Ricky Lee Jones, Chuck E's in Love, who cares? To me, personally, it's a French... Do You Think I'm Sexy? Rod Stewart. Rod Stewart. Me and Opie's dream came true yesterday when we had to play Do You Think I'm Sexy? Let me tell you something. Holy geez. That song was always a sense of humor. It was a funny song to begin with. It's not a funny song. It sure is. It's an embarrassment. Sure it is. Carol, take all these CDs. Look at them. I'm looking at them. I'll get a U-Haul truck. Take every single one of these CDs, resign, take those CDs, and you can play them wherever you want. And we'll compete and see who ends up in the top ten first. Yes. Oh yeah, but I'll tell you one thing. I'll make a deal with you. If I play my CDs for a month and you yak for a month and play yours, I bet you go down to 25th. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Oh, no, no. I don't like that bet. No, listen. Seriously, guys. Now resign, take all the CDs, and trust me, there's so many radio stations in New York. Someone will pick you up. I'll tell you something. You can take all these CDs and play them and see what happens. I should trust you? Yeah, trust me. Now why shouldn't you trust me? Resign on the air right now. Carol Mill is going to resign. Oh, kiss my ass, but you'd probably like it. Come on. Resign on the air. No, no, no, no, no, no. You resign on the air. Resign on the air. We've got to move forward here. Resign. Yeah, we are. Take all these CDs. I'll get the U-Haul truck and resign right now. No, I resign myself to hopefully remaining in my seat playing the best rock of the present, past, and future that I possibly can. Is it only a coincidence? I'm W-M-E-W, the rock in New York. The only people that are enjoying this is Carol, Scott Soe, and Dave Herman. I don't know that Dave and Scott are enjoying some of this music as much as I am. I think so. No, no, no, no, no. This is kind of the early 80s. We have to move this station forward. We feel like we were doing something for us. We've been doing something for a few months, moving forward, revitalizing, re-energizing W-M-E-W, and then now we're stopped and we're looking backwards. We've been looking back 30 years at this station. Let's move forward. Time to move forward. Damn it, Opie. Give me a Metallica CD. She's not going to resign. No, I'm not going to resign. You can have all these CDs and resign. No, you can have these microphones and resign. You have the best CD collection in the history of mankind. Actually, we do here at W-M-E-W and that's why we're playing it for you. Oh my God. The company line. This is my music, man. Don't mess with my music. No, it's pathetic. Anthony and I are the only ones brave enough to stick up to the fact that this special sucks. That's it. We'll go on the record. Not one other person down the hall will come in here and admit to us, live on the air, that this special sucks. I understand people put hard work into this. I'm not taking away from that. But the hard work went into Paulie Shore movies, too. Does hard work go into your show, too? Yes. We take every show very seriously. I won't even have to finish the sentence now, do I? Well, it's not your cup of tea, Carol, and it's not the cup of tea of the people that are liking this special. For God's sake, we've got to get out of this. All right. We've got to get out of this. We've got to get away from this. I guarantee what Anthony and I do every afternoon. I entertain many more people on the way home from work than playing this crap. This crap. Well, first of all... Oh, stick around. The stray cat strut is on the way. Can't wait to hear that again. I think I've only heard it 8,000 times so far. How many times have you worn those jeans? What jeans? I don't even have jeans on. Whatever they are there. What does that have to do with the price of tomatoes? I'll tell you what. Because your favorite music is kind of like your favorite clothes. I'm not wearing bell bottoms anymore. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not wearing bell bottoms anymore. I don't need to. I've moved on with my... You want to do that analogy. Sometimes your underwear gets skid marks that you've got to throw away. Well, I'll tell you about bell bottoms. If you want to talk about laundry. Bell bottoms. Bell bottoms are in this... Oh, I'm turning your mic off. We've got to move on. We're moving on. We've got to get out of this. So are you going to resign and take all these CDs? That's all I need to know right now. No. Why? Why should I? Well, obviously there's like head banging here, okay? There's Anthony and I and the rest of the whole damn radio station. So something's got to give eventually. Trust me. What are we up to? 1830? Yeah, well, I've been arm wrestling here for 15 years, buddy. So you just hang on. Hang on. Oh, the evolution of the rock in New York continues with this ditty. What is it? You might remember this one. Yes, we knew them well. But lay them to rest. Lay the music to rest. Lay the jocks to rest. It's time to move forward. Let's go. On the way, John Mellencamp. I'm glad we made our point. Now we've got to play John Mellencamp, Jack and Diane for the 10,000th time. Stray cats on the way. Did we play George Thorogood? I don't even know. Yeah, we did. Anybody ever tell you? Shut up! I turned off your mic and I'm on the air. Oh, man, you're cursed there, man. A little tense, Opie. It's like something else's bitch and it's like grody to the mouth. I'm sure. It's like really nauseating. It's barked out. Shut up! It's gross. Are you serious? I hated Valley Talk back in the 80s. Why do we have to listen to this again? Totally. Whatever, you bitch. 1027, WNEW, the Rock of New York. It's Opie and Anthony. We are stuck in the year 1982. This is the evolution of the Rock of New York. You know something? Frank Zappa is rolling in his grave right now. He had written thousands of songs that are sheer genius. Thousands upon thousands. He wasn't very happy with the ones that were popular. So what do we choose to do here at WNEW with our little evolution of rock and roll? Let's play the only song that Frank Zappa had success with on the air. Great. That makes him proud. I'm sure John Lennon is in heaven somewhere. He wants to hear Imagine again so we can all reflect on his shooting. Take a deep breath, Opie. Take a deep breath. We're moving through the evolution of the Rock of New York. Hi, NW. Opie, how are you doing? You guys have to lighten up. Why? You're biting the hand that feeds you. I don't give a fuck. The hand that feeds us is in the fucking future, not in the past. I agree with you. We don't need to lighten up. Don't you understand, Anthony? I'm the only one brave enough to admit that this special is stupid. In the context that they're not a classic rock station. You know that there's a bunch of people walking around the hallways right now and they admit that it's stupid, but they're not brave enough to come in here right now and admit it. It's a bad idea. Well... Half these songs we've heard a million freaking times. We don't need to hear them anymore. Yeah, but a lot of them we haven't heard in a long time. This whole special caters to an audience that made us last place. We're in last place in the ratings because we played this drivel. And now we're celebrating it? Well, we're showing everyone, Anthony, why we've been in last place for the two years. Oh, is that it? Now I get it at least. We're having a celebration. At least I get it now. It's a goddamn funeral around here. Yeah, well, good luck. We had Carol Miller on the air. I thought for sure she was finally going to resign. No way. She'll be there long after you guys are gone. That's fine. At least I know I kept it honest and kept it real. Simple as that. You know what? Because she's too scared to speak up. Dave Herman, he's too scared to speak up. He's too scared to speak up. He's too scared to speak up. He's too scared to speak up. Alright, well, you've sold everything here. speak their mind around here. They're all chicken shits. I will personally get the U-Haul. I will pack all these dusty old CDs, half of them. We didn't even know what they were because we had to wipe the dust off them. We'll put them in boxes and those guys can go to another radio station and see how popular they really are. Maybe Andrew Dice Clay would like them. There you go. He was big back in the 80s, you know. Oh! Got to go. All right, bye. How do you get the woman who... Okay, that was the edited version of Joe Jackson stepping out. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York. Just saved a minute there, Anthony. All right. We're stuck in the year 1982. Do you have any fond memories of the year 1982, Anthony? You'd like to share with everyone? Yeah, maybe we ought to, you know, play this like everybody else. We'll convey some experiences from the year that we're playing. What is it, 1982? 1982. What were you doing in 1982, Anthony? Let me see. What do these songs remind me of? What images get conjured up? 1982. I was booted out of my house, living in my car. My girlfriend was going to Downing College and told me to call her up before I come there. Yeah, Anthony, could you just not drop in? Could you maybe, you know, give a call first? Yeah, because I'll be hobbing a knob. And I'm just like, oh, okay. You got some fond memories. That's real cute. And I call her. Yeah. Hi, Lisa. Yeah? You're pathetic. It's Anthony. I'm thinking of coming by this weekend. Oh, that's a tough one. Yeah, there's midterms. You're a week into your year. Oh, yeah, well, they're doing them early this year, so please don't come here. Yeah, thanks. Great year. We're going down memory lane, 1982 for you, Anthony. Great. Every song will make me cry. Well, here's one you haven't heard in a while. Can't wait to hear this again. What is this? The Alan Parsons project. All right. We're stuck in the year 1982. It's the evolution of the rock in New York. On 1027 WNEW. Wait, isn't that, this is that song, isn't it? What? And now, the Chicago Bulls! Six Nights from North Carolina, Michael Jordan! I always wondered what that song was. Now I know. Great. So you learned something. I learned something today. This is really freaking great. Yeah. All right. The evolution of the rock of New York. Okay, great. That was a great trip down memory lane there. That's the song I really want to hear again. 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. Shadows of the Night. We're stuck in the year 1982. This is the evolution of the rock of New York and that song blows. Do you ever think you'd be playing Pat Benatar again, Hopi? No! Do you ever think in your wildest hallucination that you'd be segging Pat Benatar's songs? No, no, no. And you know, we're getting a bad rap. People are attacking us and stuff. We can handle it. Keep calling. I don't care. But people are sitting there going, no, we really want to hear this music again. Who in their right mind wants to hear Shadows of the Night by Pat Benatar again? Can I explain to you what happened again, Hopi? Maybe you seem to have forgotten. Alan Parsons' project, Eye in the Sky. I don't need to hear that song again. I understand that some of the older songs are cool to hear, like the Zeppelin and the Hendrix and the Pink Floyd, ZZ Top, Black Crows. That's what I want to hear. I don't want to hear Shadows of the Night again. You know what happened? We had phase one going very well where we took the people that liked the old butt rock. They didn't like it and they left. They said, screw you, Hopi and Anthony, left the station. Well, now they're coming back because we're playing their music. We're playing their songs and now we're hearing from them again. Remember how long it's been since we got those calls? I want to speak to your station manager. So now we have to deal with that again because we've kicked up this great evolution of the rock of New York. Carol Miller walked back in the studio and handed us a couple of enemas. Handed us enemas. I don't get it, Carol. Hello? Hello? I don't get it. What does this mean? What does this mean? What does this mean? I don't know. She had to run out to the—what does this mean? What is wrong with you? No, no, dear. You see, I— Are you having an acid flashback? What is a— I read that acid was in there, but that was for you, dear. What does this mean? What does it mean? Well, actually, you see, I left and I was on my conscience. I didn't want to fight with you guys. I love you guys. And I thought— What does an enema mean? Shove it up your ass. So I thought perhaps there might be something constructive you could do. So, Carol, once you— We had enough. I won. Bye. No, you didn't win. Yeah, I won. Trust me, you did not win. Trust me. Trust me, you did not win. I got my conscience. I speak my mind. You don't. I am speaking my mind. What do you want this station to turn into, Carol? A kick-ass rock station. A kick-ass rock station. A rock station? How are we going to accomplish that, Carol? Excuse me. How are we going to accomplish that, Carol? By playing Shadows of the Night and Eye in the Sky by the Alan Parsons Project? Let me explain something to you. To you all. To you all. We, you, me, and you and me and me are not the management. Don't put us in the same sense. Okay. No, no, no, no. I don't— We're like—this is called separation of state right now. No. The point of the matter is it's not my job and nor is it yours to decide how— I will express my opinion. A long time ago, people used to go on the radio and express their opinions. What do you want to— I just told you what I want. That is my opinion. You guys have been trying to make this a kick-ass rock station for 15 years. No, no, no, no. How many years have you been here? I've been here 15. Have you guys ever been out of 20th Place? Absolutely. How long ago? Can you remember back that far? I'll tell you. When we really had our best ratings—I would say—actually, I have the ratings at home back 1985 or so. No. 13 years ago. Yeah. No, but we actually— That's great. That's fantastic. Okay, great. You're asking me when we had our best ratings. That would be it. 1985. Okay. Okay, that's great. Yeah. Okay. So for the last 13 years, you guys have been trying to get back there. No, actually. No, no, that's not really what happened. Speaking for the folks at the station here, I think we have had so many different managers—this is true—before you got here, we must have gone through nine different people who were programming the station. And I would have to say it was in the early—we were doing quite well. It was in the early 90s. Well, when were you doing quite well again? Up until— I would say— 1985. No, no, that was our highest rating. Okay. But I would say up until the early 90s, maybe 1991, 1993. Okay. No, you guys weren't doing well in the early 90s. Trust me. I remember the day Scott Muney went on the air and said, here's the cranberries. That was 1995 to 1997. Okay. Well, you guys weren't doing any better before that. Yes, we were. No, you weren't. And what did you do? Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Unfortunately, that was a mistake. And I think— Let me— I think— Well, there's been a lot of mistakes here. But Carol— Yeah, I look— Yeah, you're looking at two of them. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Listen, let me just ask something. Yep. Let me get in here. Sure. And when they started playing alternative music with the same jocks, you thought that was a good idea? Yeah. You personally know. Okay. And you went on the air and played it anyway like a good puppet. Well, I'll tell you something. Like a good puppet, right? You didn't say—you didn't speak your mind? No, actually, at the end of the period— End of the period? Yeah. Oh, that's—yeah, when management was gone and out the door. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not my job. So you guys—what are you, a robot? It is your job. No, it's not my job. Who says it's not your job? Radio is all about having a revolution and speaking your mind. But a kick-ass rock station, as long as they tell you that it's a kick-ass rock station. Hey, listen. That's the thing. I enjoy it. Somewhere along the line, a bunch of suits got together and shut all you guys up, and you guys aren't brave enough to come on the radio and have a new revolution. You talk all fond about the days where you were able to play your own music and do what you wanted and groove the way you wanted to. And then, like Hope said, the suits came in, told you you couldn't do it anymore, and you shut up. And you shut up. And the second now, people are talking. Me and Hope, we're talking. We're speaking our mind. And now, we're the assholes? Well, if you had some education to back up the mind that you were speaking with, it might be useful. What education, Carol? I'll challenge you on anything. Hypocrisy? Take your degrees and shove them, Carol. I don't have a mind to clear out your ass. That's why I brought you an animal, okay? Carol, I love these people. You need degrees to know anything. Anybody who didn't go to college are all a bunch of jerks as far as Carol's concerned. Oh, I didn't say— Carol, the offer is here. Resign on the air right now. You'll be the talk of New York again. Well, at least someone will be talking. They ain't talking about you. You want to make a bet? That's how out of touch you are, Carol. Oh, come on. You don't even know. Listen, I will get the U-Haul. You can take all those CDs. I'm serious. This isn't a joke anymore. You can take all the CDs and all the old jocks from here could go find another radio station. Notice all the ones that have been fired from here. No one's picking them up because no one cares. You guys are all out of touch. No one cares anymore. Take the CDs and find another radio station. Simple as that. No one cares. Shut up for a second. I want to say something. We are not—you are employed here to do bits and to do things like that. No, I'm employed. I cannot come in and level you the way maybe it would be fun to do. It's just not my gig. I can't do it. So I will not do it. I can't do much of anything. Mm-mm. No, I can't do much of anything, but I got a Korean radio. I know what you got. I have a Korean radio. I've been doing this radio for two years. You've been here for three months? 18 years. Oh, that's how they rate people around here. How long have you been at NEW? Yeah. Let's hold it up. I mean, cut it. No, seriously. Take the CDs. You're just not being serious about this. I'm very serious about this. This place sucks and it's time to move forward. Well, that's your problem. You're being serious about this. You're getting a little bit out of shape. We're celebrating a relic. We're doing a celebration for a relic. It's WNEW in the relic stage. We want to take the station and restore it to its former glory, not through its former music. Hey, I came to give you guys... It was great. It was great back then, but it's done. I came to give you guys a present. Let's move on. Bye. Bye. Bye. Go away. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye. No, seriously. Bye. Bye. All right. Look at this. Our big boss is in. He doesn't like it. Rick, take her headphones off. Bye. No, no, no. I take them off myself. Don't lay a finger on me. Don't. Just leave. It's our show. We don't want you on anymore. I'm turning your mic off. Bye. You made your point. You're powerful. Turn it off, baby. Bye. Wow. Bye. Bye. Leave. It's our show. Leave. All right. Fine. We'll just sit here. You can't just sit here. I'll sit here. What's up next, though? I don't know. Oh, look at that. Look. Scott Herman. Our big boss just walked in. There's Scott. Oh, he's got his baseball bat with him. Oh, my God. I was actually holding the bat before. Oh, you were? Well, so how are you enjoying? How's the special going? It's going great. Yeah, we're really enjoying ourselves. So what are we up to? What year? I think we're up to 1864. I'll turn off the mic as soon as she leaves because I don't want to talk to her anymore. That's all right. Go suck in your cleaner. Whatever. Whatever. You got me. It hurts out. Bye-bye. All right. OK, can we move on with our show now? Let's go. All right. On the way, we got more great ride from the year 1982. Actually, Judas Priest. I like Judas Priest. Yeah. And I like the hoe. Wow. They didn't throw us out of the building. One oh two seven W.N.E.W. The Rock of New York. Where do we play? Van Halen. We're doing the evolution of the rock in New York. We're stuck in the year 1982. I like Van Halen. That was a good song. I like that. I like Judas Priest. You've got another thing coming. I don't mind. I wish we'd play that song more often. The Who, Eminence Front. That was all right. I liked it. It's getting into some music that I appreciate. Billy Squire, Everybody Wants You. All right. Maybe someone out there had a soft spot in their heart for that one. Yes, that's OK because there are a lot of different tastes out there. Yeah. But I personally hate that song now. All right. And I don't think we have to reflect and play Billy Squire, Everybody Wants You. You're playing it for people that might like it. Open I guess. So I want to say hi to all the other radio stations now listening to us. Got a little real in here a little while ago. So man to see us. Scott Herman, the big boss. Yeah, our big boss had to come in. We had a huge on air fight with Carol. Well, he came in with a baseball bat to calm us down. And I was scared because I saw that movie. What was that called? Scarface? The original one. Yes. Al Capone? No. Whatever. I don't think it was Scarface. Al Capone comes up behind the scenes. Oh yeah. OK. Tracks him in the head. Yeah. That's all I was waiting for. Well, I kept him in front of me. I made sure he didn't walk behind me. Keep your eyes on him. All right. What do we got? What's coming up, O? So where do we go from here, Anthony? We continue with the evolution of the rock in New York. OK. I thought you would discuss what happened. You're a little more intelligent than me and a little more level headed. I thought you would have some kind of witty little thing to say here. I cannot assess what transpired in the mere 10 minutes that passed. I have to breathe a little, soak it in, reflect. All I know is that in 10 years when they do another evolution, they got some. That clip is going to be a highlight. Screw Scott Muni talking to the bank robber. We got some better stuff now. Absolutely. But all right. I just expected more from you. You're known as the level head around here. Don't worry. Don't worry. All right. Still early. OK. I'm assessing. All right. We got to move. It's this real emotion that comes out here. What do you got? Southern Cross is on the way. Hi, Annie W. Hi. Hi, Mom. Did you get fired? No. How come the other guys are now in the tomb? I'm still here. I'm still here. All right. All right. You had me worried for a minute. Now we're fine. I'll talk to you later. All right. Yeah, it's my mom. I think you want for you. She's used to it. That's the problem. She thought I finally rehabilitated. What a day this is turned out to be. Hi, Mom. I'm here still. Hey, they haven't fired us yet. Not out yet. You know, there's a whole new audience listening right now. They have no idea what happened the first two hours of our show. Yeah. I have a feeling it'll be written about tomorrow. Well, you know, and you've had an hour to think about it. Seriously, people look toward you to make sense of things after I lose my mind. Because they say you're more level headed than me. Oh, really? Yes, they do. Well, we're none too happy about the situation at hand. Having to play the evolution of the Rock of New York during our show doesn't fit. It's the old N.E.W. We're moving ahead into the future. We're trying to evolve. Evolve, yes. Evolution is not looking back. It's going forward. Yes. We're celebrating the dark years. That's what we're doing right now. We're celebrating the dark years of N.E.W. So, well, Carol Miller kind of had a problem with our take on it and came in. She expressed her opinion. There was a lively debate. Very lively. And then she left the studio. It got real. But then she came back in. I must say, Carol Miller did defend herself quite well. Yeah. And that's fine. I respect that. She's very capable. For the first time, she spoke up. But then she came in with two enemas. A very symbolic gesture. Because she said we were full of S. Yeah. And that's when I lost my S. Yeah. And then it got very real in here. And a little heated. A little heated discussion. I don't know. I think we have to move forward. Yes. There's two factions right here. There's the people that want to hold on to the past. I want to hold on to parts of the past. I don't want to hold on to the entire past. And only the past. And then there's a whole bunch of people that we have truly brought in to N.E.W. We get it every day. We bitch and complain about the ratings and stuff. The fact is that our show is growing. And there's a lot of new people that have been checking out N.E.W. that haven't in many, many years. And they don't want to listen to this crap. And those people do not want to listen to the evolution of the rock in New York. They want us to make them laugh on the way home after a hard day's work. We're starting to get people. And then we start playing the stuff that drove people away. This mindless old butt rock. I mean, sure, there are some great songs peppered in this special. This special would have made a great two days. They would have made a great four hours. Give it to Dave Herman. It would have been great. And it's ten days? Ten days. My God. Ten days. It's like it's in real time. We're working through the year 1982 and it's going to take all one year. And there's a reason why a lot of these songs aren't on the radio anymore. Because they suck. They're just horrible. Boy, we're celebrating that we have this huge wall of CDs. So we have to play them all? I don't think so. Crosby, Stills and Nash, Southern Cross. Do we really need to hear that again? If you're a big Crosby, Stills, Nash fan, you have the CD, right? And you play it when you want to. It doesn't have any, I don't know. It doesn't energize me when I hear it on the radio. No, it's going to do nothing for us if we continue playing this crap. We're celebrating what doesn't work is what we're doing. So for ten days. Anthony and I are attempting to move this station forward. If we're successful, that'll be great. I'll be the happiest man in New York. If we're not, at least I know that I tried, you tried, and we were able to speak our mind and throw our input into the rebuilding of the station. Yeah, simple as that. We're going to sit here and seg these songs, make believe we like them. There's not a lot of jocks out there that are willing to speak their minds on a daily basis and put their jobs on the line. We've done it in the past and we'll continue doing that. Other jocks just want to seg tunes and collect a huge paycheck and go home and keep their trap shut. Bitch behind people's backs. Bitch behind people's backs. I know there's a bunch of the old timers around here that hate our guts. They're not brave enough to tell us to our face. Some of them went out the door. Some of them went out the door. And not many of them have been picked up by any other station in town. There's no market for this music. This music is being played on CBS FM, everyone. CBS FM, run one day. Hello, love. Maybe we should start broadcasting from a large gymnasium so we have that nice echo. That echo behind us? Yeah. Well, that's where we stand. I want to assure the people that enjoy our antics and we'll be back Monday in full form. Back to our normal show. You'll hear Dirty Columbo, Lamb Chop maybe, Andrew Dice Clay might drop in. Real important things like that, Opie. Tom Brokenjaw. Tom Brokenjaw. More prank calls. Fun stuff that makes you commute fun, not irritating like this. This is very irritating to everyone. Not everyone. I know there's people out there enjoying this. Oh, there are. I always suggest you get a life. I'm just kidding. We need you at this point. Sorry, I'll take that one back, okay? Oh, phase one all over again. I know. All right, on the way. All right, what great tidbit do we have now, Opie? We're stuck in the year 1982. I honestly can't even announce these songs with a straight face. What is it? Well, the Monroe's, what do all the people know? We play that on a regular basis already. Dire Straits, Twisted by the Pool. Come on. No. A lovely ditty from Three Sides Live, Genesis doing Paper Late. Anyone notice that Phil Collins has a goatee now on his head? He's got that strip of hair. What happened up there? Just shave it, Phil. It's time. It's time for you to evolve. Just shave it all off. I thought it was over. Oh, Trump's all off. Michael, look at this. What? 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. Trying to think if that brings back a fond memory for me. Let me think real deep here. No, can't really say it does. Nothing, huh? Nothing whatsoever. Well, it's part of the evolution of the cute little song. Loved it. Who out there likes that song? It was needed to be played. Was anyone twisting by the pool during that? Okay, that was great. Genesis, Paper Late before that. The Clash. There's one I like. Should I stay or should I go? All right. Because I'm starting to understand at least that there's a lot of different tastes out there. So some of these songs people like and others I'm sure are with us with the tunes that we hate. Hi, Andy W. Yeah, hey. What's up, man? Not much. I was just calling about this retrospective thing. I don't mind it, but it's sort of like running into all your old girlfriends that you went out with growing up. You know what I mean? Like some of them you run into and they bring back a fond memory and others you just sort of walk away shaking your head thinking, I was really into that. You know what I mean? You said it all, man. Like Paper Late would definitely be a one-night stand. Yeah, I went out of doubt. Hey, thanks a lot. All right, see you guys. Bye. That was good. Someone finally put it in terms we can understand. There you go. Thank you. All right, I sure just turned into a democracy. Hold on. Get that off. No, no, no, no, that's not fair, Anthony, because there are people out there that might like that song. So we are going to take the next five callers and you tell us if you want to hear Roxy Music more than this or not. All right. I think that's fair. I personally don't want to hear it. If it was up to me, I would throw it out the window. Is that okay? That sounds fair. Hi, Andy W. Yeah. Roxy Music more than this. Do you want to hear it? Absolutely not. Okay, very good. Thank you for calling. All right. Hi, Andy W. Do you want to hear Roxy Music more than this? Hello? Do you want to hear Roxy Music more than this? Hell no. Thank you. Hell no. So there you go. Hi, Andy W. Do you want to hear Roxy Music more than this? Hello? Do you want to hear Roxy Music more than this, sir? Roxy Music? Yeah. No, not particularly. Okay, thank you. I like this. It's working out. Hi, Andy W. Oh no, that's it. Well, all right. Do you want to hear Roxy Music more than this? Absolutely not. Thank you. Hi, Andy W. Do you want to hear Roxy Music more than this? Yes, play it. Play Alan Parsons stuff. Unfortunately, though, you lose because it's a democracy and we took a vote. What about guys? It is all guys and you sound cute. No, we can't play it. I'm sorry. All right. We'll just go to Alan Parsons. Make sure that one goes out the window, okay? All right, we'll do that. Thank you. All right, so there you have it. Democracy wins. Pull it out of there. Pull it out of there? Now, the only problem is what is it getting replaced with? I don't know. We'll find out in a second. This is the evolution of the rock in New York because we listen to you guys and you think it's not fair that we decide for everyone else if this music should be played or not. Oh, okay. All right. Do you want to hear Peter Gabriel's Shaq the Monkey? I'm serious. This is fair. Out of the next five callers, if three says yes, we will play it. All right? Okay. Hi, N.E.W. Do you want to hear Peter Gabriel's Shaq the Monkey? Uh, not really. Okay. Thank you. Hi, N.E.W. Do you want to hear Peter Gabriel's Shaq the Monkey? Oh, come on. You got to be kidding. I'll take that as a no. Hi, N.E.W. Do you want to hear Peter Gabriel's Shaq the Monkey? Actually, I wanted to hear Roxy Music. Oh, too late. It's too late, though. You really have to play what they're telling you to play, though, don't you? We don't have to do anything. No, I don't have to understand. Oh, obviously not. I think you guys are much of jerks anyway. That's okay. I respect your opinion, actually. The whole rest of the day has been fine except for when you come on. All right. Thank you. But you don't want to hear Peter Gabriel's Shaq the Monkey? Um, it's not one of my favorite songs, but if it's the next one that's in order, then yeah, you should play it. Oh, if it's the next one in order? God, the puppets. I am not the puppet, darling. You're a puppet. I am not a puppet. You just described what a puppet is. You say because it's next in order, you have to play it. Don't upset the cards. How hard people work on this. Have you ever fought for something you believe in? Yeah. Ever in your life? What was that, ma'am? I think that right now I'm fighting for something. Okay, I can respect that. You believe in a play list. The guy that called you before is absolutely right. You don't let anybody else talk. Yeah, that's true. You let you talk. I can't wait until you guys are off the air. Goodbye. Okay, bye-bye. Oh, she got the last word. I'll play. All right, so we don't have to play that one. No. No. All right, what's next? Okay, we got to play something here. All right, we replace it with this one. At least we're being democratic. We are being very democratic, Anthony. The evolution continues. Yes. Here we go. We are fast-forwarding into the future really fast. We could be into 1998 in no time. Okay, this one. Okay, all right. Rush New World Man. If I could vote, I'll say play it. No, we're not allowed to vote. I know, but I would say- We're not going to allow the listeners to decide. Okay. Hi, N.A.W. Do you want to hear Rush New World Man? Yes. Okay, very good. Oh, we're onto something here. Hi, N.A.W. Do you want to hear Rush New World Man? Yeah, sure. But, okay, tell you something. Oh, don't curse us out. I'm not going to curse you out. We're taking a bunch of hits to the head today. I'm fully for you guys. Okay. I have friends of mine that listen to you. I called you guys, spoke to you guys a few times already. I was just over at Buddy Mines' house. He's 42 years old. He loves you guys. Right. His son listens to you. Right. But the music, like it's the archive of rock and roll. Yeah. Come on, it's more like the crypto rock and roll. And the guy who called before, he's like a human stool sample. All right? Yeah, we're not worried about him. This guy is a putz. If he's 32 years old, he's probably fat, bald, and he couldn't get laid if he crawled up on a big chair. Okay, very good. I got to cut you off now. I'm still keeping a PG-13. All right, man. Thank you. I want everyone to cut. You guys are doing a great job. And if they get rid of you, they should pull the plug on the station because then the station will really suck. Well, thank you, sir. Thank you. All right. What's the vote up to, Dan? We're two, four. All right, we only need one more and then we can play this song. Hi, N.E.W. Do you want to hear Rush, New World Man? Yeah. Woo! Of course. Okay, thanks for voting. Hey, do me a favor. Yeah? Send me that Roxy music thing so I can put it in the microwave. Yeah, we got a new one of those. All right, we'll do that. Thanks, man. Thank you. That's very cool. We also have the Rush special tonight, don't we? What time is that out again? Midnight. Midnight. Midnight tonight. Gary, help me out. I've lost my mind. What's the deal with the... I'm totally serious. That mic's live because I've lost my mind. We got the world premiere of the Rush live CDs. Okay. Which actually recorded live on the last couple tours. Okay. And it's at midnight. Very cool. All right. Two hours. Very cool. A chock full of music. There's a reason to listen to N.E.W. Yeah. Thanks for voting. 1027 W.N.E.W., the Rock of New York. We're stuck in the year 1982. It's the evolution of the rock of New York, Van Halen, little guitars from Diver Down. When did we get here? Did we get here in 81 or 80? How long have we been? 82. The whole show's been in 82. Yes. Whew. A 38 special before that caught up in you. Rush, New World, man, don't forget tonight. Yes, it is that world premiere. After we do some of that live concert stuff, we've been doing the last few days for you. Premiere of Rush's newest release, different stages, live recordings from their last two tours. That's going to be very cool. It's a three CD thing and we'll bring it to you around midnight. And then the songs we didn't play this hour, Peter Gabriel, Shock the Monkey and Roxy Music, more than this. And a few people are upset because we didn't play the Roxy Music anthem. We were very democratic. We took a vote and left it to the listeners and they decided they didn't want to hear that. I think we should take a vote to see if we should stay here or not. Well, since you brought it up, now we have to. I'm willing to put it on the line. Are you? Today? Well, today, I think we'll be packing our bags. I think the valid boxes is loaded. I don't think the odds are in our favor right now if you went to the phone. Election day. Let's see. It might be an upset like Schumer. Let's see. Go ahead. Are we allowed to talk about anything current or are we stuck in the year 1982 and we're supposed to talk about stuff that happened in 1982 to us? Now, we could talk about something now. Chuck Schumer won the Senate election over DeMoto. That was something I thought DeMoto was going to win. I thought he was going to pull it out in the end, but he did not. No. I'm more interested in Jesse the Body, Ventura. Yeah, Jesse the Body is now the governor of Minnesota. Minnesota. That is insane. The ex-wrestler and B-movie actor. Is he going to break out a can of whoop ass when someone does something wrong in that state now? A forearm smash. The guy wants to legalize prostitution. This is amazing. I'm moving to Minnesota. When I found out that he was running for the governorship of Minnesota, I thought it was a goof like when Gopher ran and stuff. But Gopher actually won his election as well. Yeah. Well, maybe Minnesota felt it was time for a change, Hopi. They were tired of the old ways, the old stale ways. Maybe people couldn't relate to anymore. I can relate to that. The politicians had and then Jesse the Body came along with new ideas. A lot of people probably didn't like those ideas. Kind of like our radio show, I'm starting to think. Wow, I didn't even think of that analogy, but yeah, you're right. We're a lot like Jesse the Body, Ventura. Just like our hero, Jesse the Body, Ventura, for God's sake. You'll learn to like us someday, hopefully. All right. On the way, John Mellicamp. That would be us, sir. A couple idiots, right? Well, hey, nothing personal, but you guys are a bunch of idiots. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Bye-bye. Have a lovely day. You too. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Well, I guess that's the last call we'll take today. Oh, is that it? Oh, you want to take a little one, Anthony? We do have our supporters out there somewhere, I know. Yeah. Yeah, I know they're out there. Remember, we had them before we started the special. I mean, gosh, this person right here must love us. Hi, NAW. Hey, calling for support for you guys. All right. There we go. Thank you. Playing what you guys like. I'll turn on your radio. That's the delay. That's right. You guys are playing some good stuff here and you're not, but you got to make your choice. Yeah, well, there's some very good stuff that we are playing. That is interspersed. And go for it. But there's some stuff that during our show is downright embarrassing to be associated with. So don't play it. Let somebody else play it. Exactly. We didn't. We moved on with- That's your choice. People out there don't like you. Well, then turn you off. There you go. You know what I'm saying? Thank you. And now you got to take the good with the bad. We're trying. Yeah, you guys are doing good. I keep it up. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Here we are. Hi, NAW. You must love us, right? Hello. Hi, what's up? Is that NAW? Yeah. Hey, how you doing? All right. Who am I speaking to? OP and Anthony. Here it comes. I'm listening to you on the radio now, though. You're not on the phone, huh? Oh my God. It's a delay, sir. Look into it. Oh, yeah. OK, listen. Oh, now I hear me. Go ahead. Hey, how you doing? Good. Listen, I've been listening to NAW since 1983. He's trying to listen to himself and talk at the same time. No, so I've been listening to you guys since you've been on. Right. You know, you've done a great job. I mean, the changes NAW is making are really good. But for you to compare yourself to Roxy Music, isn't that what brought you into radio? Well, when we actually compared ourselves to Roxy Music, what we meant was we never compared ourselves to Roxy Music. What, are you insane? No, but wait. When did we compare ourselves to Roxy Music? Why would we? Oh my dear, sweet Jesus. I thought I was going to make it until 7 o'clock without a hammer. I only have one other question, too. Oh, all right. Do you think when you put on your radio show and you listen to music and everyone has their own little thing they do, like you guys are being a little pompous, don't you think, towards the NAW old staff? Listen to me from the outside, though. We're not being pompous. Somebody as little as you would understand that. Like, I'm sitting out here and I want to hear your show. I love all your stuff, like all your little skit you do, yeah. Sounds like the cute kid at the school play. You're squirreling, but all of a sudden, you know, I wonder, when you tell us about the problems of the radio station, like in the fights that you had, I miss what happened with Carol Miller. So you don't know what went on? No, no, I don't know what went on, but what I'm saying is, me as a listener, do you think I give a hoot, like, about, I think we want to listen to the show in good time. So do we. That's the whole point. So get off the phone. That was the whole point. I'm just kidding, but we do have to move on. I'm not saying anybody, but one thing, like, in business, don't you think you should, like, don't be, Thank you, L.P. Take imposter, like, Hit that, please. I can't take any more of that. Hey, hello? Yeah. Yeah, can you talk to this idiot for us? No, I don't want to talk to that idiot, please. Hang up on him. Hang up on him? I'm, I'm, I've been a viewer. I've been listening to you guys and you've been on the hell with everyone else in their car, man. And who are you? I am. Who are you? I'm a listener. Oh, you're a listener? Do me a favor, bud. Get the hell off and leave open Anthony alone. Because I don't know what you're talking about. Dump out of it. Wait a minute. Wow. Someone had a curse. We had to use the delay because I cursed. Don't curse anymore because we've run out of delay. Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't. I wasn't, I wasn't. That guy was. Oh, we almost had a love connection. Yeah, please, get me his phone number now. I'm really dying for him. All right. Now, I just wanted to say, I can't believe that these people call in and say such a stupid thing. I just, I can't fathom it at all. Well, honestly, Anthony and I do know that we do have our supporters out there and a lot of people have called and we really, really appreciate that. I've talked to you like four different times. I love you guys. As a matter of fact, my daughter who is 14 wanted to know why she didn't hear your voices as much during this evolution thing. Yeah. She noticed the difference and then she said, oh, there they are. What are they going to say? And she laughed. Yeah. You laughed at what you said. All I can say is we'll be back to normal on Monday as far as our show goes. Yeah. And we'll see what happens. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much for putting on that God of Mine. I really enjoyed it. All right. Cool. Bye. Bye. All right, we got it. We got to get out of here. There you go. Thanks for listening. We do appreciate it. And hey, we'll be back tomorrow to continue with the evolution of the rock of New York.
