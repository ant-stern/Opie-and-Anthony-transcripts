 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. Boston, more than a feeling. ACDC in there and we start the show off with Live Rush, the spirit of radio. It's Opie and Anthony for your ride home today. Hey, not much new around NEW these days, huh? No. Yeah, well, wow. Kind of went down. Wow, okay. As they say. There's our comment. Anyway, on the show today... We got some Aerosmith tickets to give away. Yeah. And we're going to do a lot of really cool stuff. People are already calling. They want to know how church was yesterday, Anthony. Shut up. They're calling. I didn't say a word, right, Rick? First five calls, what do they want to know? They want to know about Anthony and church yesterday. Is that just going to continue, I guess? Yes. First of all, I'll answer your question. I don't go to church. That's the answer to the question. All right. I'm going to continue this thing. I'll have to start pulling out better weapons to pound you with. Wait, wait, wait. You'll curl in the fetal position and start crying like you always do. Like Glenn Closted in The Big Chill? Yeah. Yeah. Whatever you want to do. No, so you can dish it out, but you can't take it. How many months have you been on me about... I can't take it. The hairy virgin girl. I finally found something on you and I'm going to work it for a while. Here's the difference. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. So did the listeners and so did Rick and so did everyone that works at N.E.W. I heard that you had sex in the closet with a priest. You're speaking for yourself saying you heard that. I don't even know where you... You know where you heard it from? You. I said, yeah, one time I must admit I had sex in a church closet. You went, with a priest? I said, I didn't even say with who yet. Because that's what I heard, with a priest. Out of your own head, you heard it. No, and then I went to the phone. Shut up. And every call we took on Friday, I heard the exact same thing I did. That's all. That's all I'm trying to say. That's all. Get the tape, play it back, you'll hear exactly what was said. You going, a priest? And I never even... I didn't even say it. I didn't even finish my statement. Alright, where's the tape from Friday show? I believe I have it. On you? I don't know. Let's look. You don't even have it, right? It's probably in my vehicle. Oh, and who drove today? You did, finally, for once. Shut up. You don't have the tape, right? We will play the tape tomorrow. Alright, but we will play the tape tomorrow. Yeah, and you'll hear that I said nothing about a priest. Opie makes these things up. As far as a hairy woman that you slept with? Wait, wait, wait, wait. That's fact. You told me she was a hairy back wookie woman that sounded like... No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Opie. No, no. What I said was... Opie, cuddle me. Cuddle with me. What I said was... Go my mane, Opie. Give me a chance. Are you going to give me a chance? Oh, like you gave me? Okay, what I said was that yes, I indeed lost my virginity to a girl in college. In college, how pathetic is that? And the girl had like a mane down her back. You turned it into the wookie woman. Well, she wasn't that much hair. Was she hairy down her back? It was like an eight-year-old girl. She was like a nine-year-old girl. She was like a nine-year-old girl. She was like a nine-year-old girl. She was like a nine-year-old girl. She was like a nine-year-old girl. I don't care. I don't want to hear about your anatomy. What about her? An inch wide all the way down her back. So? And all of a sudden, it's like I slept with a wookie. Hairy woman. Well, that is a little closer to the fact than me saying I slept with a girl in a church closet and you saying it was a priest. I heard priest. You heard priest out of your mouth. But I did hear priest. Enough. Enough. I did hear priest. All right, we'll play the take tomorrow. It'll be settled. We will play the take tomorrow. It will be settled. All right? You'll know when we get back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. All right. We'll play the take tomorrow. It'll be settled. We will play the take tomorrow. It will be settled. All right? You'll hear it. We got lots to do today. I don't know what it is, but we'll get to it. Yeah. Fact line is 212-957-WNEW. Phones are already ringing off the hook, so we don't need to put you in to give you that number. You're an asshole. Thank you. It's going to be one of those days now, isn't it? All right, long some George Thurgood on the way and the latest from Johnny Lang next. The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Collective Soul, The World I Know. On the way, Metallica doing Turn the Page and some Def Leppard by request. It's open, Anthony. Hey. Well, the New York Mets did the right thing. Breaking news here, Steve Phillips returns as GM of the Mets. Bravo. Good. He didn't do anything that he shouldn't be with the team for. Our president set a precedent, and if nothing happens to the President of the United States, then why should anything happen to Steve Phillips? He should be able to keep his job, fulfill his duties while this goes on. What, is he still being sued though for sexual harassment? Yeah, I think the Mets just felt bad because they got a glimpse of who he was messing around with and said, oh, hi. Everyone thought, wow, this chick's from Florida. She's going to be hot. Probably all tan and big boobs and oof. She came over from Cuba on an orange crate. That's all I saw. He's back and they're having a press conference right now. I think that's very good. Good. I think he can run a baseball team. A little easier than running the country. Yes. I guess we're not going to war this week, huh? No. One more time. You do that again, boy, I'm going to spank you. What a joke. Back in February, Saddam Hussein pulled the same crap, and what did Billy do? No. You knock that off or we'll come in there and I'll bomb you. Just like we mentioned last week, Saddam Hussein is pretty much toying with us right now. He is controlling our armed forces. He's the commander in chief. He dictates where our resources are in the world at any given moment. We are wasting so much money bringing all our troops close and then bringing them back and then another two months or so we're going to have to bring them back in again. Jackoffs from the UN start negotiating with this guy and it's a joke and he finally backs down and then we don't bomb them. A couple of months later he pulls the same crap after we pull all our stuff away. It's scary to think that he just might be stalling. He is buying so much time to build whatever the hell he's building in that desert. Say you have a few thousand buildings that these UN teams have to search, right? Now you've searched a few of them already and they won't let you search some other ones. Then they throw you out of the country. You don't think they're taking what they don't want you to see, putting them maybe even where you looked already. Now you've got to do what? Start all over again and look at everything again. This guy is playing everybody like a bunch of jackasses and Bill Clinton, Mr. What are the polls say? Just blew it. He blew it. He should have done something. Lob a few in. Let him know we're serious. Well, the whole Clinton side of this scares me too though because I think at this point in time he has to do something dramatic to make people sort of forget about the Monica thing. Before the Monica thing hit, like him or hate him, the polls were huge and he was going to go down in history as a pretty good president in general. All things said. Now when he leaves office everyone is going to be like, the president that got oral in the office and stuff. But this is a perfect way for him to make people forget about that whole mess. Yeah. I think he might be timing it for when Starr has to testify because Starr has got to give his testimony but that's not for what, next week or something. So maybe he'll lob a few bombs when that starts happening, take the pressure off. He's an ass though, Bill Clinton, just an ass. I can't wait until this guy's out of office. Wreck in the country, thank you. Economy, it's not Bill Clinton. Don't get all excited people. We're not doing well because of Bill Clinton. Doing well because the economy runs in waves and we're on top of a very good wave and he happens to be in office but he's just a jackass. That's my statement. I like that statement. All right. Commander Schween. Commander in Chief Schween cigar in the you know what. What a joke. Factsline 212-957-WNEW. I'm just bummed because I was looking forward to watching the war on TV. The war show. I heard we were 30 minutes away from bombing. The B-52s were in the air. Cruise missiles were ordered to be launched. He gave the okay. All right, let them fly. And then they send this little note, like a little excuse note, using school. And everything gets called off. Doesn't anyone realize that's millions of dollars? Yeah. That's lives of America. Just because bombs don't get dropped. Every time they launch a plane off a carrier or something, people's lives are being threatened. In a war situation like that, they're really pushing the edge. And if anyone dies, that's because Saddam is telling us what to do with our army. And Navy. Bad jerks. Don't get me started again. Well, I like this. It's very good. All right. If you want to add to the discussion today and coming back with that Def Leppard, stay there. One of the seven W.N.E.W. The Rock of New York, Metallica. Yeah. Turn the page. I can't wait to hear the rest of that CD. And when is that coming out? I don't even know. I'm slacking with my music knowledge lately because Anthony makes fun of me because I know all this stuff. Make funny. You think it's funny, though, right? Well, Metallica's putting out that CD. It's all like their favorite covers. There's some punk tunes and Bob Seeger, of course, and others. Skinner. Skinner? What's Skinner's song? I don't know. I just heard there's a Skinner song. You know more about that CD than I. Look at that. All right. Finding our expertise. Very cool. On the way, the Dave Matthews Band coming to town for a couple sold out shows. And we got some who for you by request. Well, is traffic all cleared up downtown from the John Glenn ticker tape parade? It's all like gridlock and traffic and tons of people and paper and just like it was back in 62. Well, actually, Anthony, I got some audio from the ticker tape parade. We have some audio? That they threw John Glenn. Yes. Would you like to hear it? Let's hear the chanting crowds. OK. Hold on. And there it is here. John Glenn coming around one of the corners. I dream of Canyon of Heroes. There it is. Exclusive. Exclusive audio of the ticket tape parade that our lovely mayor threw for John Glenn. Did anyone care? Did anyone go? No one went down there. They get reports from people were saying I expected more people. It sure is fun to watch a bit of American history, but I expected more people. I didn't. Not everyone knew it was going to be a wash. Can the mayor stop cheapening our ticket tape parade? The city is known for the ticket tape parade and now we're starting to cheapen it. Exactly. That's what it is. But I still disagree with you. They should have thrown one for the Yankees. You just think you think it should be for pretty much war heroes or or people that cure diseases and do something for mankind, right? When we kick Hitler's ass and kick the shit out of the city, we're going to be the only one who's going to be able to do that. And I think that's the only thing that's going to be going on in the city. When we kick Hitler's ass and kick the shit out of the city, and our boys came home, there you go. There's a ticket tape parade you saved. Oh, geez, we won a baseball game. Yeah, that's the same thing as saving the free world. But I don't agree. But it's our home team. Doesn't matter. I think you throw the ticket tape parade for the Yankees winning the World Series, Rangers winning the Cup. Excuse me. Save it for. But to give it to John Glenn again, 36 years after the fact, because what he accomplished in space was absolutely nothing. Yeah. Nothing. They're not even going to use that knowledge. When are they going to possibly use that knowledge? He went up as a passenger to see how low an old man's sack will hang in zero gravity. Everyone knows that's what they were checking for. See if they bounce around like those old click clacks. But he went up, everyone watched the launch on TV. It was all a historic moment. They got Walter Trumkite. See your name? Here's John Glenn. I'm blasting off another piece in history. Everyone watches. He's up there and everyone forgot. Yeah, and he spent the time doing sleep studies. It was a big NASA commercial. They called it sleep studies. Sleep studies. No, he was sleeping. Leave him asleep. Leave him asleep. People say he's doing sleep studies. Grandpa, I'm going sleep studies. My teeth are floating away. Help me please. Thank you. Oh, look at your pretty planet. This is what the real astronauts had to deal with. Yeah. While they were up there. Yes. And they come back and now Giuliani is going to throw a secret tape raid. And no one shows up. No one. It was like a normal day down there. I could have used that money to, I don't know, cave the Bell Parkway would have been nice. Oh, you know, let's use the money for something that matters. No. We drive down 57th every day. What is that one crater between, where is it, between 5th and 6th? Has anyone noticed this crater yet? If you're in the right lane, I swear to God, your stomach ends up in your nuts when you hit this thing on 57th. Oh my God, westbound. Westbound, right? Unbelievable. Yeah. But no one showed up. I guess the big thing was driving the car was New York City police officer. What's his name? He was the son of the first cop that drove Glenn in his first parade back in 1962. So there's a big tie in. Exactly. If you keep talking about John Glenn, I'm going to have to keep playing the story part. No one cares. No one cares. Godspeed, Johnny. Godspeed. Godspeed, back into your normal life, back to your wife. You see, right when he came down, he wanted to go back into space again. I don't blame him. He's a married guy. I had a great time. 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York. Today, Matthew's Band and Stay. Those guys come to town for a couple sold out shows, December 2nd and 3rd. And we're getting a lot of interest on the Dave Matthews tickets. I think we have a few later on the joints still. You just got to keep listening for details, okay? All this week on our show, Anthony, we got more Aerosmith tickets to give away. Cool. We have a pair to give away to maybe someone to do something stupid. Like what? I don't know. If someone's got a good idea, we'll listen to you today. But every time we throw that out there, nothing gets done. What do you want me to do? Or I'll bungee jump off the George Washington bridge. Okay. And then it doesn't happen, obviously. And then we just give them away on the phones. Rick's work on the phones, if you've got a good idea, we will listen to you. Yes. And we may have a pair to give to you if you do something for us, okay? All right. Hi, NAW. Anthony, I can't believe this. You don't believe the Yankees should have received a ticket to a parade? Don't think they should have. Jesus, Opie, this is coming from a guy who played seven seconds in heaven with a priest. And you believe in him? Come on. Hey, man, I fought it. I think the Yankees deserve it. I think when the hometown team wins, that's good. Yeah, I mean, even the low we met. What would happen if the Jets would have won a Super Bowl? Would you say they deserve a ticket to a parade at all these years? No sports ticket to a parade. Save it for real heroes. The first guy that comes back from Mars, give him one. The guy that invented cure for AIDS, give him one. All right, this is coming from a guy again who gets wood on the bus. That's me. Jesus. The guy that invented the big yellow school bus, give him a ticket to a parade. Yeah, yeah, and a new way of delivering a communion wave is how it tastes. That bland or a little salty. Right off of the father's ****. Oh, God, you guys are sick. Keep it up. All right, man. Bye. See you later. Give me a break. You're out there, man. Give me a break. You're out there. I'm just saying, real heroes should get ticket to a parade. No one cared that John Glenn had a ticket to a parade. A lot of people calling. They were down there, you know, working and stuff. They said that there were more cops than people at the ticket to a parade. My high school, my illustrious high school, John H. Glenn High School in Elwood, sent their marching band there. I don't even know why, because John Glenn, in all the years, never visited. That was like the big thing. John Glenn never came to his namesake high school in Elwood. Yeah, joke. So there's the band. Yeah, why go see him and then three people at this ticket to a parade? Oof. Joke. We got a fax from Phyllis. Phyllis? You'll remember Phyllis. We got to do something with Phyllis. The stalker for Steven Tyler? Yes. Dear Opie and Anthony, remember me? I'm the one who turned you, turned to you guys to set me up with 15 minutes with Steven Tyler. Well, I have to admit I am disappointed, but I have faith. I am hoping you guys will do the right thing and someday decide you should use me as an example and make my dreams come true over the radio. I believe it was Anthony who asked if I was hot. I am. I said I am. As I said, 35. I weigh 110 pounds, black hair, blue eyes, about 36, 24, 36. I won't embarrass you. I give you my word. I will write to you guys daily if you'd like to show my sincerity, but hey, please, whatever. Blah, blah, blah. I know. It just rambles on, but Phyllis still wants us to set her up with Steven Tyler for 15 minutes. What are we, the Make-A-Wish Foundation for the terminally horny? Come on. Well, she says she's hot. I got an idea. We should invite Phyllis to come down here and we'll decide if she's hot or not. Or better yet, we'll let the listeners decide. Okay. You got your digital camera today? Yeah. We could put some shots of her on the underground website. And you can vote? And the listeners can vote whether or not we should try to make this happen for her. All right. We can do that. So I got Phyllis' number. We'll call her later this hour and see if she's willing to come down here so we can take some pictures of her and put her on the website and then let the listeners decide. I think that would be a fair thing to do, right? Absolutely. Okay. On the way, we got the latest from Lenny Kravitz and Led Zeppelin, next. 1027 WNEW, though, right? I'm in New York. It's Opie and Anthony. Hello. We are collecting your faxes this afternoon, by the way. 212-957-WNEW. A lot of people have comments about what has gone down the last few days here. And send the faxes in and I'll give them all to the boss, good or bad or indifferent. I don't care. Send them in, though. 212-957-WNEW. And we have Phyllis on the line, Anthony. Good. We want to talk to her. Phyllis is a lady who wants 15 minutes alone with Steven Tyler. And for some reason, she's convinced that you and I can make this happen. So we have decided to maybe invite her down here to see what she looks like and stuff. Maybe take some pictures of her, put it on one of our websites and have the listeners decide if she's worthy or not to hang with Steven Tyler for 15 minutes. I think it should be up to the people, yes. Yes. So let's see if she's game for this. Phyllis. Yeah. Sophie and Anthony. Hey, how are you? Good. I heard that. I heard that I'm well and I'm game. Well, can you get down here now? I can't come tonight. I have that tomorrow night. Why can't you come now? Because I got plans tonight. I'm going to fix my... I have a small tattoo that's about 18 years old. They need to get fixed. Oh, no. I want to add some color, you know. I made an appointment. I got no choice. What football team's name do you have to cover up? Oh, I don't have any football team. No, absolutely not. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo.

I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. I have a small tattoo. That's when he was on drugs. He's sobered up now, so he's got to be hot. I hear you. I will not let you guys down. I am not, you know, not perfect, but I look all right. I get my share. We're going to have the audience judge you. I think we let the listeners do that. Let's do that. Yeah, well pop your picture up on the website and they can vote. Let's do it. Can you come in tomorrow? I can. What time do you want me there? Nice and early. Okay, 3 o'clock. I'll be there. It is Tuesday Hummers tomorrow too. That's right. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you.

I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you.

I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. I can see you. That's a great idea. All right, we're back on track. We're riding back down. Thanks, man. All right, man. Bye. Bye. Thanks, man. I can see you. I can see you. You're listening to the Rock of New York. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. It's Opie and Anthony. All right. We got some Aerosmith tickets we're giving away later this hour. We're going to have to make it simple because no one came up with a good idea for the tickets. So we'll go the boring way once again today. Put it in over there. When you hear the Black Crowes remedy, be the 20th caller at 212-757-1027 and you'll have a pair of tickets to see the guys when they come. December 27th? Is that the date? Yeah, it is. All right. And Steven Tyler promised us he'll stop by and do a little visit with us. He better. Well, he said it. We have it on tape. He'll be pissed if he doesn't. Yeah. Hey. Do um. Does Howard, is he the only one that could goof on IMS? Uh-huh. Is that radio like rules and regulations? Only Stern could goof on IMS? No, I think IMS is fair game for everyone. Is that it? Yeah, because he sucks so bad. Because I'd hate to get into it and then have people call and go, hey, you're ripping off Howard Stern because you're goofing on IMS. Right. You know, and I don't understand what the radio rules are maybe. Because I think IMS was making some comments. Hey, Harold, what's the radio rule? Are we allowed to, you know, make fun of IMS? Because now that's, that's, I mean, I think Howard invented that, right? Yeah, he invented everything. Yeah. So I don't know if we could, we could goof on IMS. There's really nothing new to radio because Howard invented all of it. So he was, um, IMS was ragging any W this morning, wasn't he? Yeah. Well, some big changes came down. Yeah. On Friday. It was a very, very sad day around here. Yeah. It wasn't easy for anyone. And I miss decided to, to pretty much trash any W this morning. Yeah. Well, one five stations always going to be a one five station. I mean, what's that all about? Don I must, I'm going to start talking about my brother's salsa. I sell them to stores and where that big stupid ass cowboy hat. Don I'm a FAM. Where's Charles McCord? So my face looks like it's melting. Doesn't it? Doesn't it? Yes. He's hunched over. I see him on that MS. Is it MSNBC? Yeah. In the morning. He really should not have a TV show. That is obvious. I woke up to that. I thought I was watching a sci-fi channel. I thought it was like the blast from a neutron bomb. It hit some guy and that's what I went to sleep to. I thought I woke up to it, but it was just I miss his face is melting at this point. Don I must in the morning 66 WFAM. Don I must boy any W got a as a one five day. That's always going to be a one five station. What's our rating? One three. We weren't so bad. We wouldn't be so bad. He had nothing intelligent to say about the whole mess that went down Friday. Tomorrow I'm going to pop my teeth out. Now that would be some good TV. Yeah. I want to see that one. What's up with the gay cowboy look? Yeah. I don't get it. I'm an urban cowboy. No one wears the bandana around their neck and a cowboy hat unless you go into the village for some act show. Unless you're a fag. Don I must a big fag. 66 WF AG. Fag 69 WF AG. Yeah. I'm wearing my cowboy fag clothes today. Got my spurs on. I'm going to talk about that. I mentioned my brother's salsa. See how I look. See how unfunny this is actually. This is an actual excerpt from his show. This is this is what's so pathetic about his show. If you're just to have him talking without all his supporting cast. Yeah. He's probably the worst personality in New York. Well, I don't know what you're talking about. 66. That's great. That's great. Don I must Charles McCord with the news. Is that funny? No. Have I done anything? No. How about Bubba Clinton? Don I must. I must in the morning. 66 Fag. I picked up his CD. He re-released his CD from 1973 or something. Yeah. Real relevant. What a piece of garbage. All you want to hear is him goofing on Nixon. Well, that's not even the point. I mean, whether he's goofing on Nixon or whatever, it's just not funny. It wasn't funny when he did it in 73 or whatever it is. And it sure isn't funny in 1998. Are we allowed to play his CD on the air to show people how bad? Sure. It's a CD. God, I don't have it with me though. I will get it. Might be in the office. We'll bring it in. That's pretty interesting though that he goes and berates a station that's at the beginning of a rebuilding phase, a new era. Well, it's the brave thing to do. Here at NEW instead of him sitting there on his fat old ass. It's the brave thing to do. It hits someone when they're down. Yeah. It does matter. Don, you want to take a call? Yeah. Hey, what's up? FAN, Don Imus, Imus in the morning. Yeah. What do you got, sir? Come on. You guys go. The guy is an icon. The guy is up to the date. And here you are, a monetization of Scott Muny. What? Another icon in the radio business. Don Imus isn't an icon. He never was. He's an eyesore. He's an eyesore, that's for sure. Get him off TV, first of all. What do you mean, TV? Don Imus. The guy's never been on TV. I was, I was a... You guys cannot compete. I was Scott Muny's intern. I was a radio host. I was a radio host. I was a radio host. Don Imus. The guy doesn't even realize that he's on TV. Yeah, really. It's the best TV in the world because it's so scary. Hey, you got a question for Don Imus. Imus in the morning. Hello. F-A-G, W-F-A-G. Well, Don, you didn't... I'm dressed in my fag cowboy clothes right now. Well, that's real good there, Don. That's nice. Be careful where you're going. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom.

My brother, Frank Imus. Don Imus in the morning, 66. It is... Oh, I know you're in your car going, wow, this is really bed radio, but this is exactly how it sounded this morning. 6.55, five minutes to seven o'clock. Don Imus, Imus in the morning, got my cowboy hat on. Charles McCord sitting over there. How you doing, Charles? And my hot wife at home. Yeah, I got my hot wife. Boy, she didn't marry me for money, huh? Yeah, that's right. It's love, baby. Hello. Imus in the morning. You're on the air with Imus in the morning. Hey, Dom, I have a question for you. Yeah. How come on the TV show your eyes have that blue glink to them? They have a blue what? A glink. Is that Viagra? Yeah, it's actually a Viagra in my bloodstream. In your bloodstream? I haven't been able to sport wood in probably 25 years. The wife don't care as long as I've got a wad of bills in my pocket. He pops them like Tic Tacs. He needs Viagra just to take a leak. Yeah, so shut up with a gopher on any W, please. Yeah, that was real tough radio this morning. We're at the beginning of a new era. Of course, it broke some hearts around here to change things. We understand that. It's not always a fun thing, change. But sometimes it's just necessary. Yes. It has to happen. We don't really need Don Imus goofing on us. Imus in the morning. Has anyone taken a peek at his ratings lately? Please. Talk about a downtrend. See, I wasn't sure. Maybe only Howard's the only one that could goof on Imus, but Imus was taking shots this morning, so I felt we had to defend ourselves. Very good. Against that freak of nature. Well, people want to hear the salty ball song. We're going to play that there, but we had to get some of that. Imus in the morning. Exciting Don Imus radio on for you. Is it time for Charles McCordan in the news? 66F AG. I'm wearing my fag cowboy clothes. Fag cowboy hat. I got my bandana around my neck and a bullet tie. It's real relevant in New York City, isn't it? I'm going to go to Arizona. My brother Frank makes salsa now. I see it in the stores. F-A-N. Do you want to hang out with us for the rest of the program? Don, you might have more relevant stuff to say. Yeah, I could pull your station down to no rating. Okay. Imus in the morning. By the way, we've got the Stones, Kenny Wayne Shepard, and we'll do that salty ball song as well. Stay there. Don Imus, Imus in the morning show. I'm here with Charles McCord. No, Opie and Anthony. It's Don Imus, Imus in the morning. It's a hell of a time of it there. Is this what you do all morning long? 5.30. No. Imus in the morning. You look like the Crip Keeper with a cowboy hat on. I'm wearing my western gear today. Don Imus. Imus in the morning show, WFAN. Hey, Halloween is over. Why are you still wearing the outfit? Well, what outfit? I'm just wearing an outfit. You're not going to get off. Oh no, I'm going to get off. Don Imus, Imus is in the morning. So, you do this for like five straight hours, and people actually listen to you? 5.33, three minutes after 5.30. Don Imus, Imus in the morning. Well, if you got a question for Don Imus, we only have him for a little while longer. The Rock of New York, Rolling Stones from Tattoo You, Kane Wayne Shepard before that Blue on Black, it's Opi and Anthony. And on the show today we have the privilege of having Mr. Imus in the studio. You see, Mr. Imus thought it was pretty cool to make fun of any W this morning. Why don't you kick a station when it's really down. Imus in the morning. Boy, that's some great radio, Don. 66F.A.G. So we figured we could get some pointers from you, Mr. Imus. So we're sitting here listening to your comedic stylings. Well, stick around. We're going to have Senator Alde Mato stop in. He's not the senator anymore, so. He's not the senator anymore. Why don't you tell me that I'm a court. Don Imus. Imus in the morning. 5.45. Yes, sir. And this is what you do every morning and people laugh and they're entertained on their way to work. I play some funny comedy bits. I dress in my cowboy outfit. Don Imus. 66WF.A.M. If it weren't so bad, we wouldn't be so good. Boy, Don, without your people around you, you're just. Well, you got to see me on my. You're a ball of laughs. MSNBC show. Now I know why you're all those people. My cowboy hat looked like a urban cowboy. My brother, Frank, I'm a friend, friend, friend, I'm a scholar in Arizona. Ever see his salsa in the store? Don Imus, Imus in the morning. Well, thanks. Well, you're really helping our ratings. I could I could feel it. There's a buzz out there. Thanks for helping us out. What about that? That Bubba Clinton, Bubba Bill. Imus in the morning. This is what you do. Bill Clinton. And you're a legend. This is what you do. Another standoff with Iraq didn't amount to anything. Understand that one. Spend a lot of money on. I miss in the morning. F.A.M. Wank Wank. Stand out on. Bubba. Hillary. You know. You guys. I miss in the morning. How about some news now? Charles McCord, Charles McCord. No, he's not here. You're by yourself. And it's obvious you need people around you to make yourself funny. You know, phone call from anybody. I miss in the morning. You want to take some calls? Oh, what a mess. Where's McCord? Listen, we're going to take some calls. I want to talk to McCord. We're going to take some calls. OK. Any W. Oh, I got a question for Don. Is that really him? This is Don Imus. Oh, Don, you're on my favorite radio station. Let me ask you something. Thank you. Let me ask you something. Yeah. How much fucking Thorazine you shoot up before your show? I think I better let Charles McCord answer that one. I miss in the morning, Joe. It's 535. What's the deal with that? The one out of my neck? No, the one around your balls. Well, I'm wearing a cowboy. I wear a cowboy hat and a bandana around my neck just in case any dicks and drips out of my mouth. Don Imus, Imus in the morning. Don? Yeah, yeah. Don Imus in the morning. What's up with that neck, man? Maybe you've got more rolls on it than when the trip's neck. It makes one of the trips neck look tight. Yeah, how about that? Looks like I. What's with that thing, man? With the young chick you got? A little stretch maybe? A little plastic surgery? I got a big old turkey neck is what I got there. That's why you wear the bandana around your neck. You know, hide it. Yeah. But you think with that young girl you got, you'd be pretty happy. You're a pretty grumpy bastard all the time. I catch you on a TV show. Well, if you had a hot looking girl like that and couldn't get wood, wouldn't you be pissed off? Imus in the morning. Don Imus. Yeah, Imus. Yeah, Don Imus. Don Imus. W-F-A-G. Listen, man, there's a good question. Yeah? Your wife, did she marry you because she lost a bet? And if so, what did she get if she would have won? Yeah, she's quite an attractive girl. Thank God Charles McCord is having sex with her. But is that figuratively or literally? They say love is blind. Is that figuratively or literally? Yeah, I did have to put some acid in her vizine. So she'd wake up, put that in, and she wouldn't have to look at my ugly face all day. Don Imus, Imus in the morning. 66 W-F-A-G. Wow, you're really helping our ratings, Don. Thanks for helping us out. We really need the help. Yeah, anything I could do to help. Yeah, you said this morning, NAW will always be at 1-5 radio station or something like that. Yeah. Well, what are we? At FAN. Have you checked your ratings lately? Hey, I'm a 1-2. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don Imus, Imus in the morning. Are you going to stick around for a little longer or? Imus in the morning. What the hell's that? Oh, you're a legend. Yeah. You're a, let me bow to you. Wait a minute, let me. I'm bowing to you. You're a man. You have a hair tie? You have a hair tie. What's, a hair tie? Yeah. Why do you need a hair tie? Well, I got a tie of skin on the back of my neck into a little ponytail. It doesn't flop over the microphone so you don't hear me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Gobble, gobble. Yeah, baby. Maybe she's, maybe, maybe. Millisol Hargis. Look out, look out for Moby Worms. Look out, Moby Worms attacking the Empire State Building, people. Don Imus, Imus in the morning. You ever think of maybe drinking again so you're funny? Yeah. Huh? Ugh. Where's my, where's my attractive young wife? She's home probably banging someone. Yeah, you think so? Yep. Hey, where the hell's McCord? He's not here. You're, you're, wait, wait. You're by yourself. Is Charles McCord having sex with my wife right now? You're by yourself when you're, when we just listened to you, it's obvious that there's nothing going on here. Yeah, baby. I'm in the morning. F-A-G. And what? Ugh. People listen to this every morning. They listen to you do this? Huh? Ugh. This is painful. People are driving off the road right now. This is what you do every morning? If you don't have your supporting cast around you, you're nothing. Yeah. Hey, look at the time. Ugh. I'm just in the morning. No, you're taking more calls. On the way, we got some black crows. Stay there. Danny W. Yo, fellas. Hey. You got to calm this down. This is awful. I mean, at first it was funny and he's, I'm just pathetic as it is, but this is getting really bad. But it's really Imus. I know. That's the problem. This is what he does. I can't help it. He wanted to come in here and help us get some ratings and he's doing it, I guess. I guess this is what he does. This is what he does. Yeah, what's the matter? You got a problem there, sonny? Oh, man. You got a problem with Imus in the morning? He's just awful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Straight up awful. There's like no other word. All right, baby. Moby Worm coming down the street. Reverend Bill Huggins. That ain't coming out of your pants. I'll tell you that. You can have Bubba Clinton on the phone there. I wear spurs too, baby. I bet you do. Where's McCord? God, this sucks. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony. Chocolate salty balls. That's a funny song. It's a great song, isn't it? Yeah. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. It's a great song. We can't take credit for that one, though. It's off the South Park CD. That's Chef. Chef and Friends, the songs of South Park. The CD's going to be available, I think, next week, actually. Pick up my CD. My Don Imus. Imus in the Morning CD. You have a CD that you re-released from 1973 because you don't have anything new to put on CD. Still relevant. Hey, what do you think of McCord's beard? He's got that beard now. We're going to be talking about that for the next three hours. Who invited you in here? I don't know. When you don't have people around, you just suck. You're horrible. Yeah. Hey, where's McCord? He's not here. I wish we invited him. Then it'd probably be a little better. You want Ted Turner? Yeah, Ted Turner wants to maybe run for president in 2000. Gene Fonda there and Ted Turner. What about him? You must have some cutting edge humor here. Go ahead. Well, you know, I'm married to that Ted Turner guy. What do you think of that McCord? He's not here to bounce off. Where's that little weasel? Where's that weasel? Get him in here. What do you think of Iraq? Everyone's talking about Iraq. You must have some cutting edge stuff on that. Oh, yeah. Saddam Hussein. Yeah. Imus in the morning. Oh. Imus in the morning show. FAM. Wow. Yeah, well, you know, he's a jackass. What do you think? Saddam is... I almost got chuckled. Camel jockey. Yeah. Camel jockey. No, really. Don Imus. Imus in the morning. No, really. This is great radio. I like it. Make sure to catch me on MSNBC. Why do you have a TV show? Show people how I'm deteriorating. Now, that's funny. That's the first funny thing you said all afternoon. Sure could use drugs and booze now, huh? Sure can. Every time I look in the mirror, let me tell you about that one. Imus in the morning. All right, very good. Yeah. Got to congratulate George Rosado of Chester, New York. I'm going to go to the end of the show. I'm going to go to the end of the show. I'm going to go to the end of the show. I'm going to go to the end of the show. I'm going to go to the end of the show. I'm going to go to the end of the show. I'm going to go to the end of the show. New York. He's got the Aerosmith tickets. We got those to give away all week long here on the Opie and Anthony show. Where'd you put Anthony, by the way, Don? Imus in the morning. Oh. 66, W-F-A-G. Wear my cowboy outfit again. Yeah, I see the hat. I like wearing a cowboy hat. And a bandana around your neck. I got a bandana around my neck. You know, the dust on the trail. Yeah, you look cute. I actually like your jean jacket. It really makes you look younger. Yeah. I was wearing this outfit in the village. I bent over and almost got one up the old dirt road. Now you're becoming funny. This is good. What? Maybe you should use some of this stuff on your morning show. Yeah, well, I got to do a time break. 66, W-F-A-N, 6.05. Five minutes after six. Stick around. We're going to go to Washington. Yeah, who are you going to talk to there? I don't know. I wish McCord was here. Isn't it time you talk to your brother on your show? Yeah, who? Fred? Frank? What? Yeah, that's some compelling radio. You know, when you talk to your brother, sometimes I'm like, I don't know, a half hour late for work because I just can't get out of the car. It's so riveting. Yeah, it's compelling radio. It is unbelievable stuff. It really relates to people in New Mexico. Yeah. It makes a salsa, you know, in the store. Yeah, okay. I miss in the morning. All right, on the way some Hendrix and Green Day. Yeah, baby. Could you like leave? Could you leave? Yeah. Well, I got nowhere to go. Why don't you go home to your hot wife? She told me not to be home until like midnight. Why? Why do you think? She has a company coming over. Oh yeah, what kind of company? Yeah, she said she's going to be happy because there are going to be clean sheets on the bed too. I don't know what that means. Yeah, baby. I miss in the morning. Well, thanks. This is the boost this show needed to have you come in here. Yeah. It's really good stuff. What? All right, more Great Rock on the way and maybe some more of your phone calls. Maybe Don can talk to you as well. This is just the worst radio I've ever heard in my life. I miss in the morning. I miss in the morning, 615 on 66WF AG. Don I miss Charles McCord? Hey, looking in the paper, I'm up to Monica Lewinsky. What do you think about her? Thank you. 1027WNEW. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, Jimi Hendrix, Little Wing, Green Day Before That from Nimrod and John Faraday too. It's Opie and Anthony. Don't forget this weekend, tune to WNEW for the 14th annual Hunger-Thon. This is really cool. Explain. It's always very cool. Among items up for bid this year, a signed Bruce Springsteen guitar, a VIP tour of the New York Stock Exchange. Will that be with our buddy stockbroker Dave? I don't know. That's interesting. Did Dave come to the table with that? Maybe. Because you and I went on the floor. That's the real VIP tour. Wow. They give tours. We saw some tours coming through. They take you up, you can look down on the floor and it's really cool. But then we got the real tour. We were in the middle of the action. See, this is unbeknownst to a lot of people. They take all that money, the billions and billions of dollars that they're trading every day, and there's a back room and everyone goes back there and they play poker with all the money. That's what decides our economy. I wasn't supposed to say anything. It's out of the bag now. We heard some horror stories down there. Are we allowed to talk about the horror stories now that it's been a while? Which ones? Where guys in the past have dropped dead of heart attacks and they trade right over them. Well, some guy dropped dead. Not some guy. They said a lot of people dropped dead of heart attacks. Well, the story I heard was one guy dropped dead. He's laying on the floor in front of one guy's booth where there's some trading going on. And there just happened to be a lot of action that day in front of that booth. And they couldn't move him. For some reason they can't move him until the coroner gets there. You're not allowed to move a dead body. They've got to make sure everything was on the up and up. So they started trading over him. Over him. Over the guy. That's it. Hey, life's got to go on. The earth is still turning, my friend. That's a little rough. Yeah. That's life. I stepped over a few bodies in the hallway today myself. Ouch. Ouch. That hurt. What? I don't even know what you're implying by that, Opie. Also this weekend, another item up for bid. A chance to be a jock in WNEW for one hour. That's how long it lasts. How long your gig will last. Oh my God. This all starts Friday at 6 a.m. Only on WNEW, the Rock of New York. On the way, some David Bowie by request. And also we're getting some requests for some Stevie Ray Vaughan. We'll take care of that one next. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. David Bowie. Eve Six before that inside out. And a bunch of people calling about Stevie Ray Vaughan. Saying, who sang that last song? Was it Sammy Hagar? Wow. Yeah, someone called and asked that. It's Look at Little Sister from Soul to Soul. It's Opie and Anthony. A lot of people also calling to get in sight for tomorrow. We're going to be inducting some more members to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Yes, induct some more members. And even take it to a personal level. And call up some of the girls. We understand the guys have a hard time asking girls for such things. Like the Hummer. Yeah, there's a lot of confusion out there. So when there's a real pathetic case, we'll help. Yeah, we'll help. We'll call. We'll help you guys along. So make sure you get those factions in before we get on the air so we can plan for you. Help you out, okay? And a lot of people are calling, you know, are the ladies part of the club? Yes. Yes. It's an easy concept. Tuesday, every Tuesday. It would be very nice. The girls out there would take care of the guys, deliver the Hummer. And everybody would just be a happy world. So we're setting aside Tuesday for just that. Did it last week, worked out very well. Yes. And there are meetings every Tuesday night for members. You know what's happened since we started the Tuesday Hummer Club, OPI, last week? The stock market went back over 9,000 for the first time since July. And I think it's directly because of the Tuesday night Hummer Club. A lot of guys very happy. Happy guys. They go to other ladies. They're feeling optimistic. And we're asking the guys to reciprocate as well. Yeah, of course. Whatever that may be. Whatever your lady likes. We don't know. We don't know your lady. Wait a minute. I can speak for guys. Guys love Hummers. That's it. That's why we start this. That's what makes guys the happiest. Especially if you're in your car. I wouldn't recommend that. Why? The car one. Because especially first of all, you have to be the one driving. Obviously, a girl can't drive and do that. And then your legs get all discombobulated. Yeah, you got to slow down a little. Well, you can't work the gas and the brake when you're doing that thing with your legs. You're just like, oh, you know, moving around. It makes it very exciting, though. Wondering if you're going to die or not. Oh, great. Yeah. You lose all control for that five, six seconds. And you just wonder if the car is still going to be on the road by the time it's over. Believe me, in that situation, with what would be going on, you would wish you were dead. Put it that way, if you hit something. You've never experienced one of these, Anthony, on the highway? No. Oh, no. Really? No. Honestly. Honestly. Why, you're going to tell me you did? Yes. Really? Many times. Yeah, there's a lot of guys out there. What was the trucker's name? You got me. You just heard it, people. Hope he was at the truck stop. Yeah. Giving hummers. Don't try to play my game. The truck driver. Everyone heard it. Don't try to play my game. Oh, my God. I can't believe you're coming out like that. No, that's my game. That's my game. With a truck driving priest. IAW. Yeah, hey, I've got to talk to those guys on the air. You're live on the air. What's up? Oh, cool. You know, this Hummer Tuesday thing, you're not speculating enough that the guys don't do it enough for the women. Well, yeah, but we've got to start somewhere. Ah, well, then why don't the guys start for the women? Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. That's the way it's been. No, absolutely not. You ladies in general control the amount of sex us guys get. No way. I don't care what they write in Cosmo or anything else. Oh, I don't read Cosmo. I go by real life. Well, this is the way it is. No, it's not. Wait, wait, wait. Let me explain to you real life. Yes. I am in real life. Married 15 years. My man's got a Hummer. Oh, my God. I've had a hang up on her. If I wanted that, I would go home. Married 15 years. Now explain your point. When it comes to sexual relations with each other, the guy really can't ask for the Hummer. It's very difficult. If it all of a sudden stops happening, you can't come back and go, honey, give me a Hummer. It seems silly saying it. It's embarrassing. What if you get a no? We're just breaking that ice. A girl could walk up to the guy and go, honey, I would like you to take your head. Enough said. Right. A girl could do that at any given moment. The guy will go, yeah, all right. Whatever you need. But the other way around, it's not that easy. We're helping out where it needs to be helped out. We've got to start this club somewhere. Yeah. So we decided to start with the ladies because in general, I truly believe the ladies control how much sex us guys get. If we did the Tuesday whatever munch club, let's just say, it would be the same as it always is. Nothing would change. That's going on all the time. The Hummer Club though, a little extra treat there. What do you got, bro? Oh, me? Yeah. Oh, yo, you're on the air. Oh, hi. This past summer, I got my very first vehicular Hummer at the age of 37. Boy, it was a fantasy of mine for a long time. When it finally happened, you're right, man. My eyes were bulging. I was driving 25 down the Northern States. People were going, beep, beep, get out of the way. I'm like, whoa. You know, I don't think we can condone this activity. It's going on all the time, but you know. Hey, at least once. At least once. It's a pretty sick feeling. Any truckers come by? No, we were on just a passenger car highway, which I think made it a little bit easier. I mean, I wouldn't do it on the thruway. All right, that's right. All right, there you go. Congrats. Have a good one, guys. Thank you. Rocking it. All right. There you go. It is a sick thing, but I don't know if we can condone it. There'll be accidents all over the ball fields. Yeah, we don't want that happening. Safety if you're on home or parked car or real late at night and you're the only car on the highway. Not even that. You got to try it. You got to try it. No? All right. Do it at home. Do it at home. You need some excitement. That is excitement. Yeah, but you got to mix it up a little. Look who's talking. I'm not even a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Yeah, really. Come on. I became a member the first night we had the Tuesday Night Hummer Club and Opie comes in Wednesday. Opie, you a member? No. Well, you're the grand poobah. And you know what? I'm not going to be a member this week either. We're going out with the boss and I'm not going to ask him for one.
