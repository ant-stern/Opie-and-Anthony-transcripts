Yes, Tuesday Hummer Club, open for business. Yeah, look into, induct new members into the Tuesday night Hummer Club. Yeah, so get hobbin'. Right now? Right now. Yeah, hob, knob, knob, hob, knob, hob, knob, hobbin', the knob. Saw a little bit of the Hummer Club going down on the TV screen in the office. Jesus Christ. You know, this job rules man. What other job do you go to and just hang out in the office for a little bit and watch porno? We got a box of porno sent to us. Let me tell you guys, we know you love us, we appreciate it, but I'm almost ready to say that I think we've reached our quota in porno. We're running out of shelves. Yeah. I mean, I don't know how this started, but you know, the faithful listeners, they get a porn tape and they want to share. Of course. They pass along to us and we really appreciate that and stuff. Today, like Ant just said, we got a box-o-porn. A big box came in. How big is the box? It's got to be so they can visualize. Like, you know, three feet. Three feet across, two feet deep, is that accurate? Yeah. I mean, it's a huge box. Yeah. We open it up and there's got to be 30 to 40 porno tapes. Porno tapes, so we put them all up on the shelf. Yeah. Now the salespeople are coming into the office and we're renting them out now to the salespeople. We are officially renting porn from our office. We're like Blockbuster, but instead of the BL, it's a C in front of it. That's what we call ourselves and we put a sign over the door. And we're renting it out now. You know, if all this continues, we're going to make more money just sitting in our office than actually doing a radio show. Yeah. Between all the stuff we got going on back there. We don't charge late fees. We come to your house and kick you in the nuts. That's right. Take the tape home. How many pornos do we have on that shelf, really? I couldn't even tell you. I mean, I brought at least a dozen home to my house. At least you have. Oh, hell yeah. I was wondering where some of those went. Hell yeah. Come on. I'll bring them back. Oh, like you're going to miss them? Well, yeah. Have someone go down and count how many pornos are in our office right now. Yeah, but there's some good ones, you know. And then there's some homemade ones that you guys, yeah. Pretty sick. The homemade ones are a little out there, but watching a scary one before. Brian? Skinny little white guy with his white girlfriend, and he opens up the door and lets this huge black guy in. Yeah. He's like got a Louisville slugger, and he watches a Louisiana black snake in his pants. And he was just watching as like Mandingo did his girl. Yeah. And he's getting all... He was like a nerdy guy. And then he's getting all weird in the background and stuff. It was a little disturbing. He's like, yeah, ever, ever, ever. Oh, man, he liked that. Pretty sick, man. That was pretty sick. Well, Brian wants us to like give away the porno. What? Hey, Brian. Yeah, how you doing? Great. Yeah, you guys got too much porno, spread it around a little bit. You know? Give us more prizes. That's not a bad idea. You know, hey, what the heck? We're always looking for prizes to give away on our radio show. We could like basically take the porno off our shelves and give them to you guys. Exactly. Why not? A big old contest. I mean, it was hilarious today opening up the box O porn today. That's it. I mean, half the tapes in this box, you know, they're in the middle of the porno. Some weren't even rewound at all. Some weren't even in boxes. Yeah, I know. Some didn't even have a label on the tape. So those are the homemade ones. You just have to pop it in and see what comes up. Yeah, right. Literally. You didn't have any problems getting any of them out of the box. They weren't all stuck together, were they? No, we were a little paranoid about that. We had some gloves on. So, hi, Brian. Hey, listen, love you guys. Thank you. Take care. Bye. Bye. Like Mark was concerned. It's like, oh my God, look at these tapes. Oh, don't touch them. You don't know whether. It's like, well, wait a minute. The tape is the safest thing to have. Yeah. The tape is in the VCR while you're doing whatever you're doing. So it can't really get any on it. You know? I don't know what. The listeners are freaking out. They all want porno now. John. Hey, how are you? All right. Listen, you guys better be careful about renting these tapes or Mayor Rudy will be sending his inspectors down to make sure you're on compliance. Yeah, we have to make sure it's, what is it, 4060? Something like that. Do you have 60% legitimate videotapes in your collection? As per Lord Come Over. Right. What we'll do is we'll get 60% Kung Fu tapes that were on our shelves as well. Kung Fu tapes and Disney tapes. Disney tapes. Nothing better than seeing Ravage Savage Suck Sluts right next to The Little Mermaid. All right. All right, John. Take care. That's what we've got to do though. We have to get some Kung Fu tapes. Yeah. Some karate action flicks. That's what they do now. A flash dance tape. Just throw it in there. It doesn't matter. That's what all the porn shots have to do now. 60% of their stuff has to be legit, non-porn. So they have this advertisement for a Kung Fu film festival. Like you're going to walk into a peat land so you can see a Kung Fu film festival? I don't think so. You're in there looking for some meat curtains. Yes. I think we have more porno in our office than most of the sex shops. Most of the porn stores? Oh yeah. And adult toys too. We've got that fake vag. We've got the hoppity hop wiener ball. Which for some reason is always at Opie's other side of the desk. Underneath the desk. Please. I'm not saying anything. I'm just wondering why it's always over there. It's actually on your side of the desk today if you really want to get into it. I'll kick it right back where it belongs. The Love Doll. I've got hiccups now. And someone drew a map of Hawaii on the Love Doll's map. Did you see that? Yes I did. There's a map of Hawaii on her back. And then on the front it says your mom. Yeah. So we're not sure whose mom it's supposed to be. And someone stuck a Mr. Hankey keychain. No the Sundown chain. Yeah. It's pretty disgusting. Well there are some freaks working here. God damn. Well that's why we're here Anthony. Yeah I guess so. We're in the same boat. So there you have it. Yeah pretty much we could open up a sex shop. Yeah. In the back there. Why not? We've got the DVDs that everyone sends us. We have the penthouse DVD that's fine. Right. Gotta love that. Oh man. Everyone is asking can I have some porn? No. I'll take some porn. We can give our porno away. Scully. Yeah how's it going guys? Alright. Listen I used to manage a video store. We had this great porn section. There was this one in there I swear it was called Opie Goes to South Central. Yeah I saw the cover of that tape once. Yeah man Opie comes from Wisconsin goes to South Central. And all the black pimps try to cheat about that. Oh you're cursing now. No problem. I'm to cursing. It's kind of hard to talk about porno without cursing isn't it? Yeah. Much in serious apologies. I gotta check that one out you know. I know a bunch of you guys have sent that title to me. I gotta check it out for the hell of it. Opie Goes to South Central. Oh and by the way John Famiglietti said to say hi. I don't know if you remember him or not. John who? Famiglietti I don't know. He's from Brentwood. He says he knows you so. Brentwood. I don't think I know anyone from Brentwood. I just usually drive through there with my windows rolled up real fast. Same thing with wine dance. Yeah tell me about it. Well thanks for your time guys. Thank you. Yep. Brentwood. I used to work in Brentwood I think. So you probably know. Maybe I did. Hey you know Dave Hinckley from the Daily News. What an ass. Oh my god. We'll get into that next. We got a little blurb in the Daily News about the rock. The croc. Yeah. We have to take a break but Ben's got me the article. We'll talk about that right after commercials. Stay right there. Ope and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. 1027 WNEW it's the Ope and Anthony show. Hey man. Should give out our phone numbers 212-757-1027 if you have any questions. Our fax line is working just fine. 212-957-9639. We like hearing from you guys if you're being inducted into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club for the first time. Yes. And if you are congratulations. Well the Daily News. Oh I got my phone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can a week go by without the papers writing something stupid about the radio show Anthony? Hey that's a good thing. We don't care. No honestly we don't care but I'd like to point out the stupidity of some of these articles. Yeah. David Hinckley who I actually kind of respect. I don't think he really gets or likes our show. Yeah I think he's very skeptical you know. He's very skeptical as to what goes on in this show. What is real. Right. But the thing is everything's real. Honestly everything is real on this show. We don't fake anything. Can you honestly think of one thing we faked? No. If a listener could come up with that I'd appreciate hearing that because I can't think of one thing we have done since moving to New York that has been fake. That we faked. That was a put on for the sake of good radio. Yeah. Pretty much what you hear is what happens. And I'm surprised David Hinckley who writes the radio column for the Daily News hasn't figured that out yet. Well you can't really blame David. I'm going to take the blame off him and put it on the wacky DJs because he's not used to reality in radio. Reality based radio. Right. If something happens, if something's big, if something makes some noise in this town it was probably a set up or fake you know. He's not used to things really happening like what happened here. The Rock came in, got upset and walked out on the show. Correct. Well in the radio dial section of the Daily News David Hinckley writes, The Rock. Many listeners found it riveting when WWF wrestler The Rock walked off the Opium Anthony Show in WNW. Thursday after the arrival of Sickboy whose wrestling website includes posts with racial insults. Racism in entertainment and on the web? Question mark. Good subject. Except that WWF is a set up and so is a lot of Opium Anthony. God damn does that piss me off. What's wrong with him? If he's going to say that why doesn't he list like a bunch of things that we have done on the show that he is convinced is a set up. Name one thing we've done that is a set up. Yeah. Go ahead David. Kimma. If you're going to make a statement like that then give me an example. Something I can touch and feel and go oh I remember that. And then we would explain to you why it wasn't a set up. Except that the WWF is a set up and so is a lot. A lot of Opium Anthony. A lot would mean a lot. Pretty much everything we do. Someday people will get what we do. Remember the time we walked off the show in the summer? People thought that was a set up. Like why would they risk their jobs? Yeah that was fake. Because we really believed in what we were doing that day and we were that pissed that we were willing to like get fired. Yeah. But they're like oh that was just a publicity stunt. A fake. To get listeners and stuff. No one ever believes us. It's a running gag for regulars to laugh at rubes who get all outraged as if it's real. What? Ah. That's not true either. However sincere an act and however legit an issue, you're still in a room where the first commandment is take nothing seriously. Well that makes sense. Oh sure. We don't try to take anything seriously on the show. You're right. Wear a goof. The Rock's a goof. So like what is he getting all serious with his racist issue on a goof show when he's a goof show. Right. Alright that I can understand what he's saying. See I guess the thing to say at this time is what happened last Thursday with The Rock and Aunt and I was very very very uncomfortable and very real and to be honest with you that type of radio is not going to happen on our show very often. No. We're against that uncomfortable and that real where we pretty much I don't know break out of our radio persona if you will to really try to discuss something. Yeah. And then you know the cry baby, the croc you know walks. Corky Rock. Walks out of our show. Racist. Walks out of our show after I told him you know we had nothing nothing to do with the comments on Sick Boy's wrestling site. Yeah. And still The Rock walked out without saying goodbye. Dwayne. Dwayne Johnson without discussing it further. He's a cry baby. I'm sure Sick Boy was happy though. See his little name in the paper there and it's all in bold type like The Rock's. That's pretty cool. Well The Rock is even thicker print than Sick Boy but The Rock says I'm a cry baby. Hypnotizing with stage. That OK. Dave. How are you doing guys. All right. I'm not saying the hypnotizing with stage but I do I can give you some ideas to why someone would think it was stage. OK. He had spaz hypnotized right. Correct. And every time he said something or did something spaz was supposed to act like a farm animal. Right. Yeah. He didn't say he was supposed to he was he was supposed to make a farm animal noise. OK. Is it just a coincidence that every time he did something spaz did a different farm animal noise. Like he never repeated the same farm animal. He would always go into a different it was like he was searching and towards the end he would go into a different farm animal noise. And towards the end he was trying to think of a different farm animal. Right. You're right. You know something. But Dave I don't believe the hypnotizing thing. I don't believe it either. I really I totally did not believe it. I'm still extremely skeptical. I was being courteous and cordial to the hypnotist when he was here. I don't I don't buy it. I don't believe it. I know. I know. Because they and I are on the opposite sides of the fences on this one. Yeah. I completely believe that. But I also decided I have to ask Rick a ton of questions. I asked Rick enough questions as far as enough questions after the fact that I'm convinced what happened happened. I'm still not. So you think so you think Rick and spaz pulled one pulled one over on us. Yeah. They would just believe maybe. I was believable. Rick was believable. I was believable. But spaz it was just it was just too it was like it was too perfect. You know what I'm saying. Right. Why would he do what every time you do every time you had to do a farm animal noise he came up with a different farm animal. They were truly hypnotized and they'll and then and then and the hypnotist didn't say anything that he had to make a different farm animal noise every time. I think just I think just I basically think spaz blew it. I can see where a guy like David Hinckley is going to listen to that skit and say all right that was stage right. Well no one's going to expect spaz to come up with it on his own. If that was going to think that you told him to do it if that was stage and I weren't even in on it. And that's what there's no way it was stage in my opinion. No way. I believe that you believe that. Oh yeah. Without a doubt. Because I asked Rick enough I even said Rick we're not on the air anymore. I mean that was pretty freaky what was going on there with the hypnotist. And he goes dude I swear I barely remember you know being in the studio doing all that crazy stuff. Yeah but spaz swears up and down to things all the time. Well I mean spaz. I believe Rick. I don't believe Rick would lie but spaz is full of it. Well spaz is not a good liar either though. He's not a good liar. I didn't say he was a good liar. Get spaz real fast. I said he's a liar. Right. But the fact is we don't stage stuff on this show. I wasn't buying it though. Spaz. That's not really. No you're right. That's not. Yeah that isn't setting up. Something up for the skit. Which I don't think is anything wrong with it. And even if you do stage stuff it's making people laugh. Who cares? Your job is to make people laugh. Well there's an integrity. I mean believe it or not in Opie and Anthony integrity we don't like faking and staging stuff. There's a lot of radio shows that do do that. Oh I've done stages half everything. And it should be obvious to you guys when you're listening to the radio what is stage and what is real. And I'm telling you right now I'm challenging you guys today to come up with something that you are convinced we staged or you know thought it was fake or something. You're not going to find one. I think the spaz hypnotist. I don't think. Spaz a lot of people still think. We're in such a deep hypnosis. Alright Dave we got spaz in the studio. A lot of people spaz still think that you know you faked that whole thing when you were hypnotized and you were in cahoots with the hypnotist. And then you and Rick were in cahoots with the hypnotist. No way that was possible. And if you would listen back and we replay it from time to time and I look back at the video he says when he tells me to do the barnyard animals to switch it up a bit and don't do the same ones. So looking at the video when I and I saw him say this. Yeah but then you should then you should have been able to just really fast rattle off different barn animals. It sounded to me and to Dave like you were trying to you like you were thinking of a barn animal and trying to think like as he was talking you're going OK now I'm going to need a new farm animal in my head. And then he would say something you would go into the farm animals. I don't remember doing that at all. And I think what has to happen is you got to get hypnotized. No it wouldn't work. It's not going to work. You know I think when you're under hypnosis you still have to think. And let me tell you something it would piss off the friggin hypnotist. I know that you know how the hypnotists are. They come to the radio shows. They want subjects that will work that they can work with that it'll be fun to listen to and make them people go to their shows. Yeah they don't picture those people. Yeah picture me going into the back here. He hypnotizes me. Nothing happens. I walk out. I'm fine. He knows it. He sees it in my face like I'm not going to play along. And he goes oh it didn't take on him. Well there could well he did explain that there's a there's a trust factor. You have to believe because you have to like you know you have to like close your eyes and really concentrate on what he's doing. I would do everything he said and you know something it still wouldn't work. I'm not going to go quack quack quack. I don't I don't think there's a percentage of what happens. But there's to the extent that that guy was doing it. There is a percentage of people that just doesn't work on it. Did they get the voodoo in you. What exactly. There's nothing. I believe it. I don't understand how it goes down. I believe it. These guys are so friggin powerful that in a few minutes of being alone with somebody it was like a half hour to 40 minutes. They can totally take over their friggin mind. How about why aren't there more criminals that are hypnotist that hypnotize people that are maybe bank tellers. All right. And put a subliminal thought in their head. When I go in the bank you're just going to give me a big bag of cash. And then how else do you explain what we saw with Rick. It's a gimmick. It's not a gimmick. I asked Rick I go man. You know I'm like Rick tell me. You know why is this fake. Are you in cahoots with a guy. He swore to me he didn't even remember acting like a three year old trying to grab a quarter out of my pocket. He was having fun. He was I know I was being involved with the show. He was being a part of the show. I will not accept that a certain percentage of these people that get up on stage at these shows and do things with the hypnotists. They will play along. That's what they know. They're exhibitionists. Right. Right. They want to be. Why do you think we get people that come in or come up on stage at our live shows and do anything. So because they want to be part of the show. So Rick doesn't need to be part of the show that he loves being part of the show. You can't keep his mouth shut when he's in front of the frigging mic. He's just crying. Unfortunately we can't get Rick out because he's in London. But I'm telling you Rick would have told us by now if he was in cahoots with the guy. Dude maybe he actually got to believe that much. Maybe he wants to. No no no. Wait a minute. I don't believe Rick would tell you. I don't either. So here's why. Here's why. Listen to the logic. Okay. Rick is truly dedicated to the show. It bends over backwards for the show. Okay. If he tells you that he was in cahoots with the guy. That makes for better radio and that's why and Rick would fess up and go alright guys I con you. It would make for better radio if that's all we're worried about. I'm telling you. I think he'd take it to his grave. A lot of the guys can continue to believe that. A lot of the guys. Nah. Because a lot of the bits that do work for this radio show is like bits that go wrong or go off the track. First of all he came out from the back room looking like he was on heroin. He wasn't even like hypnotized. That was scary. He was acting. No no no. You know something. He came out looking like he was on heroin. His arm was shaking. His eyes were half masked. His mouth was open. He looked like he was ready to start drooling. Because that was how he thought we would want to see someone that is hypnotized from years of watching cartoons. You know what. If that's the case then Rick should move to Hollywood. Because he's a great actor. He's a great actor. Because I'm telling you the stuff I saw when the camera or no one was focusing on him he was still hypnotized as a three year old staring at a quarter head. Why aren't there more hypnotist criminals? It seems so friggin easy if you walk into anywhere. You hypnotize someone they give you what they want. Hypnotism. It's not going anywhere as long as you're in New York City. How could you do shows? How could you find time to do hypnotism shows if you're a hypnotist when you could be getting laid 24 hours a day. You go to a bar. You see the gorgeous looking girls. You hypnotize them before you know it. So it's Tuesday every day. So you think all those shows are staged. And everyone on stage is acting and they're really good at it. Absolutely. No way. I think there is legitimate hypnotism and I think it takes a long time of laying down relaxing for things like maybe to quit smoking to cut down on eating. Right. But that's something remembering something from the past. Right. Something that's in your mind already. You can't make a sane human being with a half hour of coaching in a room act like a chicken. It was just. It was people that really legitimately do that. They're not going on radio shows. Nothing wrong with that. But those are psychiatrists. It was like it was not to be responsible. But you're also with someone's mind. You can't just go around. But also the hypnotist also has to find things you would you would probably do if you weren't hypnotized. I mean, if all of a sudden you told Rick, you know, under hypnosis to have gay sex, I don't think he's going to do that. I think that's part of it as well. I mean, the hypnotist finds things that, you know, this person would normally do. Oh, and spaz is a prostitute. And I need to get me to give him money for sexual favors. You know something that no, I'm not. I freak me out because if you're kidding around, you know, not yet. Well, without any hypnotism involved, it's like a guy is just kidding around with you like that. It freaks me out. I guarantee you. He gets spaz. Come here. I'll prove it to you. Spaz. Anthony, reach for Opie's groin. Yeah, watch him freak out. Go over here. Grab that mic. All right. Remember when you were hypnotized after you saw the tape and you discovered that you were like a prostitute and you were flirting with ants? That freaked me out. OK. Try to do that right now. He's not going to be safe. It ain't going to happen. He's not going to do it because it's not part of the act. It's part of the show. Look at him. There's no way he could even attempt to do it now. Try to act like a prostitute and he's your best customer right now. Go ahead. See, I couldn't even dream of doing that. But under no hypnosis whatsoever, he played a gay guy getting his schwanza done up by another man on a stage. Because what? That was acted out. Oh, there was an act. But you can't act now. All right, act now. Because he's not under hypnosis. He wasn't under hypnosis at his gay play. All right. And he acted like a fag. Act like a prostitute and answer best customer. I can't do that. What would you do? What would you do? See, right now he's bolstering his hypnotism act by making like he couldn't do that. Dave, you are 100% right. Give Dave a frigging prize. No way. Dave, go on hold. We'll give you something. No. I like you. You're wise. Let me plug my website. What's your website? Real fast. World's Greatest Party dot com. All right. Thanks, Dave. Bye. Thanks, dude. I agree with Dave. We will agree to disagree. There's no way. I completely believe what I saw was because of the guys under hypnosis without a doubt. Without a doubt in my mind. You saw Spaz's face. There's no way he could act that out with you if he wasn't under hypnosis. He acted with another man in a play without hypnosis. He's able to do it. He is totally able to do it. And I know Rick well enough off the radio show. What I saw when he was acting like a three year old is just no way. For the show. Listen, when I was sitting here I was under hypnosis. Okay, through the back of my mind I could do it because I've acted in that sort of a thing. Because I've sat down. In acting you sit down for three months to sit down and plan it. Because I've been in a gay play so to speak. It was in the back of my mind so hypnosis I guess he was able to induce that part. I don't know. A memory. Spaz, I ain't buying it. You can talk till you're blue in the face. I am not buying it. So why? They have nothing to hide at this point. We already got what we got out of the radio show. Now it would make a great bid if he could. If it was fake it would be great if they admitted now because it would be unbelievable radio. He won't. First of all because you believe it so much. If you tell Spaz the sky is green he'll tell you it's green too. It's not how our show works. It's not how our show works. They would have told us by now. You stop showing the halls fast enough and he's doing a prostate exam on you. It's not how the show works man. I understand. For some reason they don't want to come forward and say that alright they were putting it on. You're high. I am not high. You're high. I am completely sober. Do you pay attention to the people we work with? Yeah. And you're still convinced they're just pulling one over on us two months later? Yes. Why? Why would they? I'll get it out of Rick in the office one day. I'll get it out of him. Dude I tried on many occasions. You believe it too much. I'll sit there and go Rick come on. It's not just believing because I do believe it but I also decided I want to do some research and find out some stuff. The guy would not budge. He wouldn't budge in the office. He wouldn't budge on the train on the way home. He wouldn't budge at a family function. I've asked him three or four different times. He is not going to budge. Yet everything is completely fine now. But he has no problem admitting that he got gay crabs and he sucks on chocolate penises. What's the difference? Because that's for the show. No way. Because he would get more air time if he admitted it because then we would come in here and trash him and go why are you making stuff for the show? He will. He never will. I'll get him to admit it. No way. Guaranteed. No way. Why then how could you just trot through the rest of your life knowing that at some point that some guy made your mind friggin' wacko? That's why I wouldn't go under it because I believe it so much and I wouldn't want that experience. Rick was truly freaked out. I saw it in his eyes. The guy was freaked out that he was doing the things he was doing. Especially when he was acting like he was three years old trying to get a goddamn quarter from my pocket. Next time they could hypnotize the both of us. I don't want to. I'm going to watch you quack around like a chicken and watch me go this way like a bull. I don't want to. All right. It freaks me out. I do believe it. I do believe it. I do believe it. You have the type of personality, and I think I have the type of personality too, that we probably wouldn't go under. I know what you wouldn't go under. There's no under. Because there has to be a trust level when you decide to go under hypnosis. There is no under. I'm totally saying there is no under. I don't believe it for a second. I didn't want the guy getting all pissed off that his shows wouldn't sell if I was... See, then you're a puss. You should have confronted him. I will be the next hypnotist. You live and learn on this show. He's coming back. All right. I'll tell him I absolutely don't believe you. That's a puss move, man. Okay, I agree. But you live and learn on this show. That's how it is. If you didn't believe that much, then you should have confronted the guy. Billy from AirSick. Hey, guys. Billy from AirSick Productions. What's up, Billy? Hey, Anthony. You're missing a big point here, buddy. What? In fact, as you said before, you would expect spas to start rattling off all these animal noises one by one. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. If you always wanted to like rock but didn't have the attention span, PLJ can solve your problems. Scott and Todd yesterday broke out a mix of excerpts from the whole Top 100 in VH1's greatest rock songs. It took 10 hours to make and runs 4 minutes and 23 seconds. From Papa Was a Rolling Stone at number 100 to Satisfaction at number 1. It's 4 minutes 23 seconds of just like... It's just freaking clips of the Top 100 songs that appear on VH1. And he's writing about it. And he's writing about that. That's the headline grabber of his column. If I was Scott and Todd, if that's all David Hinckley has to write about your show, I'd be pretty damn embarrassed at this point. Yes. And Scott and Todd didn't even do it. They had one of their flunkies do it and then they play it and get all the credit for it. Oh. Wow. Would you sit through that in? Oh yeah. Would you spend 10 hours to get a snippet of the Top 100 greatest rock and roll songs according to VH1? 10 hours to get 4 and a half minutes of material. Oh yeah. 10 hours. That's smart. Really can't figure why Stern's kicking your ass. It's weird. Bits like that and fake news. I thought you guys would be number one. KJ, Queens, love the show but I'm pretty convinced that Is That A Train Bit was staged. What? What? How could that be? How could it? You're jackass. Tim, what's up? What's up? All right. I just want to say on Anthony's behalf. All right. Yes. That Opie, you are, everybody always says that Spaz is always kissing your ass. It sounds like maybe you guys are teaming up and it's all BS. It's what? Anthony's right. There is no hypnosis. It's all BS. Whatever. I completely believe it. Rick doesn't kiss my ass. We have fights all the time. We're like brothers. Yeah. Spaz kisses your ass. He kicks your ass. No, he hasn't kicked my ass, buddy boy. Hey, Doug. I heard it on the radio. No, he didn't. Yeah, the fight club when you met talked about his sister. Yeah, that's true. He did kick your ass. Oh, you said Rick? Yeah. Oh, I thought you said Spaz. I am. You kicked Spaz's ass. Yeah. I apologize. I didn't hear you right. I'm the ultimate skeptic, which is very good for this show. We can't be getting the wool pulled over our eyes. I don't believe in hypnotism. I don't believe in frigging Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, UFOs, nothing. Dave, what's up? Everything's bull crap. Dave? Yeah, this is Anthony's full of it because when he was there and Rick was carring up a storm, he was like, oh, I believe, I believe. He's full of it. And my wife got hypnotized over at Governor's. And at the end of the whole thing, he told him everything you did, you're going to remember. And there's no way unless that guy gave her millions of dollars that she would have done the stuff that she did. And have you asked any? Of course, nobody else believes in the Loch Ness Monster. And it's a matter of- She was trying. I think she was just, she wanted to be part of a show. So now you think- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So now you think this guy's wife is lying to this guy? I'm sure the guy's asked her, was that real? Are you in terms with the hypnotist? That other guy Dave is a mess because the hypnotist told him to make different animal noises every time he made- every time I sat my finger, you're going to make a different animal noise. And he did it. He tried. He's just too stupid to figure out- remember he thought a dog was a farm animal. I don't think you're getting my point. It's not that I think everyone that acts like they're hypnotized on a stage is in cahoots with the hypnotist. I think they're just themselves wanting to be part of a show. And then they want everyone to actually believe that they were hypnotized so they don't say anything. So why aren't more people- What do they have? What do they get from it? Yeah, why aren't more people- They get their little part of being a part of a show. They get on stage. They're the center of attention. And then everyone loves that. And then they have to shut their mouths for the rest of their lives about it. And they don't say anything. I'm sure some people do. Not when you get them on tape. You guys got that the way there. I've been listening to you. Yeah, watch that, Karras. Yeah. That's the show. My wife didn't fake anything. He told them when they were done, you've got to remember everything you did. Right. She still doesn't remember everything she did. All right, man. Thank you. I would think there would be a lot more hypnotist criminals out there. Steve? Yes? From the Underground website? Absolutely. Our screen's not working today. What's up, Steve? Not much, but just to reiterate the same point 150 times, were you not there? Did you not- I mean, I have this all on videotape. You rearing back in pain when Spaz came out. You're like a little girl. Oh, I know, but he was acting. No, he wasn't acting. This was hypnotist. I don't buy it. He was hypnotized. There's no way he was playing. I'm totally not buying it. Well, I mean, look, when Rick wasn't even on camera and I pan over to him and he's in the corner, curled up, playing with a quarter. Yeah. No one was paying attention to him. There was a section that Rick was by himself for a good 10 minutes while we were paying attention to Spaz. That was what he thought he should do to make it look good. There's some degree of willingness that goes along with hypnotism. I mean, you have to be willing to do it. Remember the two other girls that were there and it didn't work on them? Right. Because there has to be a trust factor. You have to trust what the guy's going to do to you. So Rick could be turned into a blithering frigging idiot two-year-old on the floor just from talking to a guy for a couple of minutes. I can't get out of here. You are totally understating the law of the human mind and personality. They call me stupid. I believe it. How did you go and get hypnotized? You know, then drag another frigging quack hypnotist in here to try to hypnotize me. I will more than willingly, I will go into the room, sit there. You'll never be hypnotized. I will do everything he says. And you know what? I'll come out and go, yeah, bull crap. No more. If you prance around like a little girl, I'll be there to get it on video. Yeah, you'll be okay. See, all I have to go on is I know Rick pretty well outside the show. I asked him. He told me the truth. He has no frigging clue. That's all I need to know. I believe that. I believe it. As much as I would ask you something, you tell me the truth, right? Yeah. Thank you. That's all I need to know. And the fact that Rick cursed up a storm and you guys had to make the guy, you know, tell him to stop? He knew we had to lie. He knew. He knew. Steve was in studio too. It was a freaky scene, man. I don't know. I buy it. I buy it. I'm buying it. All right. Steve, a couple of other things, because we could be on this all day. Yeah. First of all, the unofficial Opium Anthony website, foundrymusic.com. Oh, yeah. Heading toward a million hits. It's going to happen before Friday. Yeah. Thank you. And the site's only been up, what, seven months? Seven months since June. Well, June 4th is when I found out. I was in the studio. I was in the studio. I was in the studio. I was in the studio. I was in the studio. I was in the studio. Nice. And the other thing, I wasn't able to write you back yet. Oh, yeah. You have to put the video clip of the rock walking off our show. I got it. You know something? Rick told me. Were you still rolling tape after the show ended or his segment ended, hopefully? I got to check. There's a tape that should be arriving at your office pretty soon because Rick wanted a copy. He said, Rick said, hold off on putting it up. I said, I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. I'm going to put it up. He's on there too. If I get to speak to him and get his approval for it, which I don't know if I'm going to get. Well, the part I really want everyone to see, because we have been made to look like bad guys out of this whole thing. We made a bunch of calls to WWF and they have completely blown us off. After the amount of time we have spent talking about the WWF, I thought it would be courtesy they call us back to discuss this issue. A ton of free advertising for their product. Not that they need it, but you know what I'm saying. I want people, because we were made to look bad, to see the part where the show, the Rock segment ended and I went to commercials and he got up and left without saying goodbye. That's what I need people to see. I hope you have that on video. Oh, that, definitely I have. All right, because the uncomfortable moment, I mean you can put that on as well, but I mean it's very important to me that our faithful listeners see how much of a crybaby this guy was. So the Rock just walked out. The guy walking out not even saying thank you for the 50 minutes of promotion we gave by his book signing and his book before he decided to blindside us. You know, someone brought up a really good point the other day to me and they said, as I was rolling the tape for them, they said, you know, one day I wish I could be black so that I could get really indignant at the drop of a hat for stupid reasons. Wow. That will stir up some crap. Hey Steve. Huh? Yeah, I know. Well, you know something man, if this guy has been as racially insensitive as Opie was saying, as he was the other day in the past and he got that freaked out about it that he hit a storm out like a baby, either it was an act and it was staged or he's a hypocrite and, you know, doesn't deserve half the publicity you guys gave him. I think he was trying to get publicity. Well, we'll get the clip on the unofficial website, ASAP, if you can find it. And email is when it's up there so we can tell everybody. I'm serious, I want people to see it. Because it's amazing, you're not going to believe it, you just wait. After promoting him for 50 minutes, he like, we go to commercials, I turn around to say thanks or something to him and he's getting up and walking out with his back turned up. Like a big crybaby, the croc. Croc, oh, you know what? You know. All right, man, we got to take a break. All right, man, go ahead. Thank you, Steve. Talk to you later. All right. Brian from Jersey, Anthony, I'm with you. My sister got hypnotized, went through the whole show and afterwards I asked her about it and she said it didn't work but she still did everything the guy said. Happens all the time. Well, that's one person. I saw for myself, man. You're not going to change my opinion right now. All right. And next time the guy's in, I hope you confront him, man. I will completely confront him. All right. All right. All right. Let's try to move on to other things. Bob, Bob hung up. No big deal. All right, we'll be back. Dudes with dudes. I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off. Okay, go ahead. Come here, come here. We're out of control. We're so lucky. All right, knock it off. 1027 WNEW. Hey, Anthony Pizzano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. Joey's Place, Pizzano of Mulberry Street. We go down there all the time, love the food, love the atmosphere. The portions at Pizzano's huge and very reasonable prices. They got a pasta lunch special so you can go down there for lunch. And for dinner, it's great. You take your family, you take a date, and you'll have a great time, great food, great atmosphere. We love it. And Joey's listening. I finally finished the food. Would you like to have some? I brought all the food home that we had here for the Rocks visit. Yeah. And after the crock walked out on us, no one felt like eating the fine food from Pizzano because we were all sick to our stomach. Yeah. So I brought it all home. I had the penne ala vacca. That's great. I had the chicken marsala, eggplant parmesan, Anthony. All excellent dishes. Get the stuffed veal. Stuffed veal's good. Fried ravioli. We love the fried ravioli. Also, just ask for Joey, the owner, when you're down there, tell him Opie and Anthony sent you, and he'll bring over a glass of wine on the house, Anthony. Nice. Very cool. Pizzano, Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. Give them a call, 965-1188. That's 965-1188. 1027-W-N-E-W, it's Opie and Anthony. We have Julie on line 10. She's very upset with us. Julie, what is the problem today? I'm really pissed off with what this guy just said today. Regarding black people, I challenge him any day, his friend, to walk out for a week in a black person's outfit or something, to be prejudged. And I can understand how someone could get pissed off and tired of hearing black jokes or anything pertaining to their race. Some black people may not be offended, fine, but there are some that can't handle it, that don't like it. And what's wrong with that? So, Julie, are blacks the only group we should not pick on because you guys are so sensitive? Excuse me? Should we just lay off black people because you guys are so sensitive? I don't think we should lay off anything, but you should understand that some people have different levels of sensitivity regarding those type of subjects, whether it be black, white, purple, green. Huh? You know? Right? You weren't listening in. I'm sorry, I was trading. Jesus. And it's not that black people are just complaining, you know, but some people can't handle it. If it was interesting to me, I'd listen. I'm sorry. It's racism, Anthony. We've had a little too much of that. Can't we all just get along? I don't think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should. I think we should.

Yo. What's up? Hey, call the reporter. I just heard something that was staged. What's up with your girlfriend, Opie? Your girlfriend. See you guys later. Very good, Keith. Call the reporter. What an idiot. Very good. Everyone has a comment now. We'll take a couple and then we've got to take a break. Joe, what's up? How are you doing, Opie? Anthony. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. I'm just saying, it's just the way people perceive you. That's alright. And are you an Asian man? No. I'm not Asian. I'm actually a mix. I'm Irish and Ecuadorian. Irish and Ecuadorian? Yes. Wow, that's pretty cool. Your dad must have been really drunk. I got a vocation at skin, so. That's cool. I'm perceivable, are you? That's why. Right on, man. So, I just wanted to let you know, it's just the way people perceive things, and it sucks how they actually show them. By the way, I apologize for stereotyping. I mean, how do we know if your dad is the drunk and it wasn't your mom? Don't worry about it. Or is the Irish drunk? It's like I'm used to it. I got my friends, my Chinese friends always bug on me. Alright, man. Thanks. Thank you. Bye. Walter! Yes? What's up? Hey, how are you doing? How are you doing? I saw you guys, I met you guys at Hooters. Yeah. That was a really cool show. I want to agree with you guys. I think everybody has a distinct sound. I think there are two black people that don't sound black are Tony Gwitt and Tiger Wood. I think for now on, I think we have to guess your race if you call the show. I'm going to guess Puerto Rican, Anthony. Okay. Walter, wait. Walter, speak a little bit. Let Anthony get a chance at it. Okay, sure. I don't know what else to say. I took a couple of pictures of you guys at Hooters. I should be downloading them soon. Yeah, I'll say Puerto Rican. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Yeah, Puerto Rican. Close. Alright, what is it? Well, I'm actually Cuban. Ah! Yes. We don't find too many of those in the street, do we? I was going to switch to Dominican. But, Cuban. Cuban, yeah, the rare, the few. The one we find in either New Jersey or Miami. Well, obviously Hispanic. Yeah, I'm Hispanic. But basically, I can just talk to you guys. You can tell off the meat rack that she was Puerto Rican. Yeah, I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Puerto Rican. I can act like that girl that just talked to you guys. You can tell off the meat rack that she was Puerto Rican all the way. The way they talk and the way they were just clapping their mouths. A thousand miles an hour. I call it the machine gun syndrome. How they flap. How they flap and flap and they don't stop. You wonder how they're going to catch their breath between sentences. You know, because they're talking so fast. But that's a Spanish thing though. Whenever we speak Spanish, it's like, tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick. When you guys need to know, you know, Spanish is a very fast language, but English isn't that fast. So slow it down a little bit. Right. Exactly. Slow it down. Slow it down. Slow it down. You know, this is USA. But you know what I noticed too? Like for example, you know, I'm Cuban. I was born here. But there was like, for example, a point I was working around Mexicans and after a while, I was speaking like the way they were and people were thinking I was Mexican. So sometimes it happens that the people that you're around might influence the way you speak even though you might not be of that background. Yeah. I don't know if you've ever seen that or experienced that, but I find that to be pretty interesting. You know? But I don't know what else to say to you guys, but I'm just overwhelmed. Spats had me on home for an hour last week. I never got through to you guys. Oh, there you go. But I'm so glad I got to meet you guys. Hey, it's the first time on the show. I don't know what else to say to you guys, but thanks so much. Hi, Walter. Glad to be back on my opinion and everything. All right, Walter. Remember the phone? The only two whites. Start the train. I'm sorry. No, no, no. I don't want no train. All right. All right. All right. Mike, what's going on? Yeah, what's going on, fellas? All right. This sick with a black experience thing. I'm a white guy that works in Harlem, the South Bronx for a phone company all day long. Let me tell you something. These people are nuts. They're throwing things out the window. They're going crazy. They see me. They think I'm a cop. They run away. Then they come up, you know, hey, what are you doing? I'm working. You know, what am I, a cop with a phone hanging off my belt? Right. What are you talking about? This black experience thing. If anybody, if any black guy talked like a white guy in Harlem, he'd be beaten by his friends until he was like, yo, sup, man. Well, that's where we get it all from. You know, I mean, everybody does have their distinct voice and their distinct way of speaking. Of course. It's just reality. It has nothing to do with racism or anything. It doesn't. It's not a racial thing. It's where you come from. I'm sure a black guy from Texas won't sound like a black guy from Harlem. Yeah. You know? When they have the comedians from live from the Apollo Theater and they make fun of Whitey, it's all well and good, right? No, that's OK. But if I sat here and saw the black joke in Harlem, I'd be reading about parts of my body on the highway the next day in a paper. There you go. Hold on. There's a guy that disagrees with you. Jimmy, you're on with Mike. What's up? Hey, Mike, I disagree with you. I work with wiggers. I work with specks. I work with Jews. I work with all of them. I'm still Italian. And I talk Italian. And that's all I got to say about it. Yeah, you know what? You got no point because you're a dumb, greasy wop. I'm a dumb, greasy wop right in your face. Why? Why? OK, go back and watch Goodfellas for another three hours, you stupid fool. Yeah, you're... Oh, me. I can't call you that. Me. Me. Let me hear something. Let me get a large pie. How's that sound? You're right there. Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, let me get mushrooms on that. Did you grow up with that one? Huh? I grew up banging your mother. How was she? Was she good? No, she's sick. She's sick. She's sick. She's sick. She's sick. She's sick. She's sick. She's sick. No, she's sick. Yeah, I was too busy shaving your mother's back, that greasy Italian whop. Really? Where are you from, you mutt? Where am I from? Yeah, I'm from the Bronx. Where are you from? Come here. Come here. Do me a favor. I'll call up the police. Where are you? You can come by and kick my ass. Yeah, I'll come by. I'll keep your father's ass because he made you. Yeah, really? Yeah, but you know what? He's not a greasy wop with a stinking, fat, hairy wife like your mother and father. Very good, you freaking... You feel sympathy for the boy going there? You stupid Italian pig. How come your women turn like fat and 400 pounds and half when they turn 25? What's wrong with that? They want to be killed. What's going on there? You might as well have these Italian boys born with a razor because they've got to start shaving the same time I do. I'm going to go to your stupid wet back. I'm a wet back? Now I'm a wet back? Yeah. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Now I'm a wet back? Yeah. What? What? Do you just want to pick any race out of the book and throw it on me? That's not it. Didn't you say you were stupid? I want a pie with extra cheese and two sodas. You don't bring it to my house from now on. That was the other caller, dude. All right, I'll send it to your mother's house. Oh yeah, my mother likes that. All right. Good. Holy smoke, man. Nothing but a little racial love here today. What are you going to do? You know, we've got to get along. Can't we all get along? There you go. Thank you, Jimmy. Bye. Be good, on. Thanks, Mike. Holy smoke. Mike, relentless. Mike smoked Jimmy. Wow, I got to say that. Pretty funny. And laughing at all the Italian jabbing. Hey, funny's funny, and he's right. Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot. Oh, come on, mom. Don't bang open. You f*** my mom, I'm f***ing yours. Oh, this is touching. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I say lay back and enjoy it. So how much did the bargain ride? Both me and Anthony. A couple of real motherf***ers. 1027 WNEW. 1027 WNEW, it's the O.P. and Anthony show. We're trying to do a show, but we've got to try to get Anthony off E-Trade and we'll be able to move on to the festivities today. How many shares have you moved around today? Oh, my God. Really? You've moved around a couple thousand shares? Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You've moved around a couple thousand shares today. Absolutely. That's going to be a radio first, too. Come on. We're in the middle of this heated argument. I look at Anne for some moral support and I'm like, oh, my God, I don't think he's paying attention. He's not even listening to me. She's babbling. I've got to scoop up AOL. Well, everyone's talking about the Time Warner AOL merge. Yeah, pretty big. Absolutely unbelievable. And then AOL kind of took a little dip today. It went down like almost nine points today. Yeah. Do we have our closing stats for today, Ann? I think we do. Let's go to the Tote board. I know NASDAQ took a hit today. Yeah, a little down. AOL made a little bit of a comeback. 7 and 15, 16 sits down today. 64 and 11, 16 is hoping. So you've made some money there. I'm in. You made some money in the last 20 minutes there. Very good, Anthony. Congratulations. Bravo. Thank you. Believe me, I need it. And what did the Dow do today? NASDAQ was down, what, 168? Something like that today? Yeah, 120, I think. 120? Something like that. I've got to go back to the other page. Can't be bothered. All right. But yeah. So your trading is done for the day? Well, the market is closed, but I do have after hours trading here on E-Trade. What a dangerous thing this E-Trade is. It's like crap. It's bad. I've had it for a couple of years now. It's efficient. It's fun. You might as well. Like, everyone's trading now. Everyone's into stocks. Remember our old boss here, OP? We had a boss here? I'm not mentioning any names. I'm not saying anything, but it was always about the stock ticker. Instead of having meetings in the office, the ticker would be on. He's like a crack dealer. He kind of got me all involved. Yeah, he's pretty much passed his Fed habits on to us as far as the stock market. A lot of people, OP, not with the E-Trade account, but on the phone with his broker every so often. Got a hot tip the other day. You went up a couple of points with that stock, didn't you? Yes, I did, Anthony. Look at you. I jumped in a little penny stock action. It could only mean the end of the stock market when the likes of OP and Anthony are trading. When we are trading, it can only mean it is doomed. You guys only know, man, what we're about. We're a bunch of slobs. Now we've got a broker and an E-Trade account. Oh, it's a mess. And it's not because we're making a lot of money here. We've been sucked in like everyone else. Yeah. You know? When we put down the porn to take a call from a broker, you know there's a problem. Yeah, that's true. Like, he muted the porn because he's on the phone with his broker. Didn't turn it off, believe me. I just muted. What? What are you recommending? He has some interesting news for me, man. Yeah? Trying to expand my portfolio. Portfolio? My portfolio. Are you training me? I need to be for my portfolio. My broker looked at my portfolio and said, there's some serious problems here. What? Because everything is like, I'm going for the big win, the big hit. Okay, you need to diversify. I don't believe it's the word you're looking for. Diversification in your stock. You're like pretty heavily into the tech stocks as I see it. Am I going to diversify? Yeah. There's a disaster. You're F'd. Yeah, everything is going down the crap. If the tech sector takes dumps, Opie is broke. So he gave me all this advice. I was on the phone for like 10 minutes. He was telling me why I have to diversify and stuff. Pharmaceuticals, Opie. And I'm like, Opie is into drugs, man. Opie bought into drugs. Biotech, eh? You're amazing. Biotech. You bought drugs. He's a drug dealer. Hey, man. He's a legal drug dealer. You've got to do your research. There may be a cure for cancer soon. Oh, could be huge. That's all I'm going to say. Well, that's all you better say. That's all I'm going to say. Amazing. So the broker is giving me all this info on how I should diversify stuff. And I'm like, hey, man, I'm young. Put it on black and let it ride. There you go. That's it. You've got to play the market like you're in an A.C. Hell yeah. Like you're in Atlantic City, man. Spin the wheel. Come on. What am I saving for, bro? I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. I'm saving for the world. Damn. All right. Let's try to move on to other things here today. We'll take a whack at it. I'm in shock. The biggest news story of the day? Screw the Time Warner AOL merger. That little thing. Who cares? There's other things to talk about. Yeah. Donald Trump breaking up with a supermodel. What's her name? Is he on crack? Melania or... I've seen the pictures in the paper. How do you dump that? Melania or... How do you dump that? I'll tell you exactly what happened. Tell me he got tired of that. No. Is it just like you and I where you just get tired of the same old game? Oh my God. Oh, we're going to make believe that's not going on in people's heads right now? Oh my God. What are you talking about? Want to take a stock tip? Is this R Dave? What happened to R Dave? Yeah, what happened to stockbroker Dave? What happened to stockbroker Dave? This is not by broker Dave. All right, Dave, what's up? My father is a broker and I have a great stock to suggest if you want to check its yearly chart. It's gone up exponentially. Well, we don't... I don't know what the rules are here. I don't know if I'm allowed to say over here. I don't either. Yeah, we better... I know those stock shows, they have those disclaimers about anything you hear on the show, we don't blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If you want, I can give this back and give it to you guys off the air. Well, we better handle this off the air there, Dave. Yeah, do that. I don't even know what the rules are. We're just a mess. We better hand... Better safe than sorry, old man. Right. Let's see. You know how that is. I own three stocks. All we need is the... And I'm allowed to say... ...on our stock. I can say this, right? I own three stocks. You can say three, yes. First one went up two and five-eighths today. Very nice. Second one... I've been on a roll lately. Down three and five-eighths. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Down three quarters? You're not a player. Not a player? That's why you're... That's why you're... No, see, this is why I have to diversify. No, Psycho Mark is looking like, oh, stocks. He's not a player. Psycho Mark, you'll get into stocks eventually. I guarantee it's not a snore fest. Good one. Just about everyone is trading. Your dividend check. Take us out to dinner. Dividend? Dividend. You don't hold them long enough to get a dividend check, man. What, are you crazy? You gotta move them. Shake them around a bit. You gotta trade on the tick, my brother. Throw out the old. Come on, bring in the new one. Speaking of stocks, what about whatever happened to stock market on a stock... Stockbroker Dave. I don't know. We disappeared. We disappeared off the planet? He's listening. We'd love to hear from him. We brought Cas live from the stock market something. We were on the floor. It was awesome. Maybe because he was such good friends with our old boss, he wants to sever any ties with us. Oh, my God. If there was one guy that could not stand our old boss, it was Stockbroker Dave, man. There was an alleged incident of him being stuck with a check one evening after being invited out. So he kind of felt bad, you know? We're not allowed to talk about tips on the air. That's coming down. That's fine. I don't care. I didn't say anything, did I, before? Now I'm getting paranoid. No? Oh, okay. Sell, sell! Mortimer! No, you don't know what it's about, man. Day trading, you know, selling on the 16th. Oh, come on. Like, I make enough money to even think about it. And before you know it, you're so insane. You grab high-powered rifles and you go into these places and just shoot everybody up. Office parks. Yeah, into office parks. Remember that guy? Mark. He was a day trader and he lost like a hundred grand in like a day. And he went into the place that he was working at and just started shooting them up. Mark, here, sell this, you ass! You got to jump on the bandwagon. College kids are doing this instead of studying. I'm serious. Yeah, you should stop buying those bags. There was a story I read over the summer of high school kids, high school kids that aren't old enough to trade going to their friend that is old enough to trade to buy stock for them. And they would think he's like a bookie for school. Yo, man, I need some Amazon. Got it, I'm hurting real bad. All right, but we were talking about Trump, weren't we? Yeah. He's got to dump his supermodel girlfriend. Someone has to explain the logic to this. I will tell you exactly what happened. To this one. Obviously, he is making a serious run for the presidency. No matter how silly we all think it is and the rest of this country thinks it is, he is seriously going to make a run for the presidency. She must have some frigging baggage that he's got to dump this leggy one there. You see the picture in the daily news? Yeah. Where she's sprawled out on the presidential seal? Across the presidential seal. Those legs could go around you twice. Look at the size of them. She must have a serious flaw somewhere in that body for him to dump her. It's got to be that she, I don't know, gave a hummer to Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War or something. I don't know. There's got to be some skeleton in her closet. Yeah, but is the presidency worth giving up that? That? Well, when you look at what he's getting right now before he's president and then you look at what Clinton gets as president, yeah, I don't know. You might want to hold on to this one. And Clinton is a little better looking than Trump. So if Clinton is getting that fat pig Monica as president, can you imagine what Donald Trump's going to be getting? Well, oh my God. God damn. Bob, what's up? Hey, what's going on? You got this Trump thing all wrong. He was married to two of these women who took him to the cleaners twice already. He finally smartened up. Well, he doesn't have to marry her. Yeah, but she's probably hunting around for a rainy day. Screw this. She's not hunting for anything. She's just there. Yeah, I mean, so he's jumping high. When was the last time you saw Trump with an ugly girl? Every girl you see him with, she's always hot. He's a cocky man because how is he ever going to be this cocky? Come on. Every picture you see of him in the papers, man, you'd be proud to die for. He's got the cash. That's what it is. He'll find another one. He's not getting any younger. I mean, you've got to like, you know. That doesn't matter. You've got to cash in eventually and say, you know what, it's not getting any better than this, so I'm going to stick with this one for a while. You've got the cash. You can get whatever you want. I don't know. Cash equals cash. Exactly. Exactly. Remember that for what did we learn on the show today. Alright, Bob. Thank you. You guys are great. Take it easy. Bye. Tim, you're next on the show. What's up? Yeah, how are you guys doing? Alright. From what I heard in the news, the reason he dumped this luscious piece of ass is actually one of the reasons was she posed on that presidential seal in the magazine that they were just talking about. Apparently, Donald has felt that is inappropriate. I think he also didn't want to talk about how he's, I remember, the mile high club with this girl. I think he wants to be respectful. I'm saying he's never going to get a girl back. He will get a girl back. But Jesus Christ. The deal is Donald Trump as president, that's a goof. Wouldn't it be great if a first lady who looks like that, are you kidding me? Oh my God. Imagine that. Hail to the chief and his wife. Just imagine what goes on in the Lincoln bedroom. Nothing would get done for this country. Yeah. He's just, excuse me, I'm banging my girl here. Right. All our foreign interests would be in the way of the president. I'm not going to get into that. I'm just going to get into it. I'm going to get into it. I'm going to get into it. I'm going to get into it. I'm going to get into it. Oh, whatever you want. Whatever. And she has hot friends. Yeah. All of a sudden you see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world. You see all the leaders of the world.

That means we don't have to work as hard. We get our best stuff from you guys. Keep it coming. Online, 212-757-1027. Jeremy's on line 9. Jeremy, what's up? How's it going, guys? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Just say, Good watch. Are you gonna do a Super Bowl party in giveaway like last year? I want another chance to win a big screen TV. I was runner up last year. Well, we decided not to do what we did last year. No. Nothing against the party we went to, but we felt very out of place, Anthony. Yeah, kind of weird. Last year, they sent us to people's houses. Like that's me and Opie. Opie and I went to a house. A guy won a big screen TV and a Super Bowl party sponsored by us, plus us as guests at his party. So, we pull up to the house. And trust me, that's no treat to have us. Yeah, nice enough. People and everything. We go in, but just picture this. Super Bowl Sunday. Leave your house. Walk to a house where you don't know anyone. But there's a lot of cars and you know there's a real good party going on inside. Knock on the door and go, hey, what's up? And then walk in. It's a little awkward. And then try to get along with the people and stuff. Yeah, and there was a couple of people I could talk to and everything, you know, but I just felt, I don't know. We had a good time. Yeah, but see, I mean, no one could... I guess one of the problems is that we were the big prize and a year ago, no one really cared. Yeah. So, we showed up as the big prize and I swear to God, there had to be what, 50, 60 people in this house? 40 of them easily had no freaking clue who we were and could care less. And most of them were like, why are they here? Which, you know, it's fine. I mean, you know, who the hell are we? Right. But it's, which is silly enough, like even now, who the hell cares? Right, but they were very nice to us. Yeah. They treated us well. Although I left, we left at halftime, didn't we? Like third quarter, yeah. Did we leave at third quarter? Yeah. I thought it was halftime. All of a sudden, I ate some Swedish meatballs over there. And oh my God, I was percolating. I was driving, I swear, I was supposed to go out to my mom's house out east. I stepped on the gas. I was racing to get home. I had to just go home. My stomach hurt so bad. Came out the same way they went in. Swedish meatball. Like Benoit balls. Like a tennis ball launcher. It's terrible. So I guess we're not going to be doing that this year. No, I think we're trying to like throw a huge Super Bowl bash. Yeah, I think that'd be a much more our style. My family's having a party. I'm going to want to party with my family. We broadcast from your your your family's. Yeah, that could be a lot of fun. We'll do that. All right. Now we'll see what happens. We might throw something together. Yeah, we're going to try to figure it out. Like everything else on this show. Never know. We had some great ideas today in our little brainstorming session. Yes, we did. Upcoming things for the rest of the year that I think people will enjoy. Yeah, we're starting to actually prep for our show. Don't get carried away. Slow down. Slow down. We're actually trying to start to put some thought into what we do. Yeah, a couple of minutes a day trying to think things out a little bit, maybe. But I came up with a few things I think might be fun. Yeah, we don't want to pop them. Yeah. But the funny thing is, you know, we have in these brainstorming meetings like once a week and we want everyone to come to the brain for brainstorming. Well, yeah, plenty of storm going on and they're not much brain. And we told everyone that's involved in these meetings to come to the table with some ideas that we could throw around. Yeah. And Spaz is hilarious. He was so excited, like he found out that we were having this meeting a week ago and he couldn't wait to tell everyone his idea. He was so happy that he was in the meeting and he's got his little notebook out and everything. He like opened up his little notebook and he's taking little notes and everything. And he had his idea written down. Now, everyone's throwing ideas left and right about what we want to do. I hate to stop you. Yeah. There's a guy that online three because we'll get right back to what you're saying. Yeah. That was at the Super Bowl party last year that we attended. Oh, really? John, what's going on? Hey, what's going on? Hey, man. Hey, man. You don't like my girlfriend, Swedish people? Those things, man. I it was like I was a Gatling gun when I went home. We had fun, but no one really cared. You know what I mean? Was it really that bad? No, no, no, I don't want you guys to be pissed at us. And you guys were completely fine, but it was like kind of awkward. It was awkward for everyone because, I mean, most of the people didn't even know who we were. Well, they did know who you were. Just, you know, there's a lot of people who are listening to your show. How many times have you guys played the tape of Aunt and I just watching the Super Bowl? About 50 times. Like, after everybody knew, you know, like you guys think you guys are so famous. They kept playing. They put a camera in the corner. I found this a little awkward because then I felt like I had to do stuff because I knew like they would show this tape a million times. And they have these people have a tape that's got to be two hours long. And all it is is Aunt and I sitting on the couch watching the Super Bowl. Yeah, with the rest of the people. We talked about that girl, Jamie, who called up earlier. Uh, can we touch on that? I don't know. Which one was she again? What? Oh, she was the black chick that wasn't black. Oh, the Hispanic one? She had to be black. But by the way, she talked, you know, she had the accent. She was black. Right. You can tell. All right, John. And, uh, I live in Armonk, New York. My name is Rob. All right. What? Huh? I didn't get that part. I don't either. Is he tricking us in? I don't know. I, I, I hate when people trick you and then hang up before you hear what they said. Right. Like if you want to trick us, you could stay on the line. It's okay. Was there a Baba Booey in there and we missed it? I don't think so. Okay. Anyway, so we were doing the brainstorming where everyone had to come to the table with some ideas and like we said, Spaz very excited. Um, couldn't wait to tell everyone his idea, right? He had a notebook and everything. He was very excited to even be part of the meeting. You know, and we're all thrown around some ideas, having some laughs, talking about what we want to do in the upcoming year on the Opie and Anthony show. And, uh, then we're pretty much done with it. And we're waiting and we finally go, well, Spaz, do you have any ideas? And this is after like an hour of like, Oh my God, that's a great idea. We can do this. Love it. We're all freaking out. Everything that was mentioned in sparrows. Well, yeah, I got an idea. And it's very exciting too, because some of these ideas that we were putting forth for the Opie and Anthony show. Huge things. Yeah. It's not just like these little things. I mean, big things. Cause now it seems we have cautious optimism that we are being backed by the new regime here in place at a WNEW. There will be some money behind the show and some sponsorships and we'll be able to go out and do some fun stuff in the upcoming year. I'll believe it if they get our CD out, which they're working on as we speak. Very good. So Spaz, uh, well, the end of the meeting, it's like, Oh, and Spaz, do you have an idea? Thumbs through his little notebook. Finds his little idea page. Eight man fight club elimination tournament tournament. Like what? Yeah. We get like, and I think he met listeners. We get it. It's like, did you know just us? He wanted, there's about eight people that are regulars on the show. And he wanted an eight man. Look how bad he feels. Come on, Spaz. I didn't think it was a good idea, but it's the best one I had of all the ones I'd written down. What were some of the other ones? Come on right now. It's in my notebook. All right. Get your little notebook, man. Get your little notebook. I got to hear the ones you rejected. He's running down the hall. Go see who's on the warm line. It might be someone. Uh, eight man fight club elimination tournament. So basically he wanted, and he's singing this in front of the new bosses and we're like, shut up, shut up. Oh, fight club doesn't exist. Shut up. Don't talk about fight club. Cause everyone's like, the new guys were like, what's fight club about? Ah, it's not nothing. Bit. No big deal. Yeah, a little bit. It's something we staged. So, uh, Dave Hinckley writes about it. Yeah. We're actually kicking each other's asses here in the studio. Ass. Hinckley. So basically, yeah, he wanted a tournament set up to see who's the strongest guy in the show. All right. Here's a little daily show daily plan there. Yeah. From the daily show. Okay. And that's figured this out. Me get a little bit more in sync with the show. There you go. Very good. So these are the ideas that you were too scared to mention. Yeah. Cause I didn't think they were that good as good as the fight club tournament one. You're really proud of the eight man limit, limit elimination, uh, fight club tournament. Yeah. Well, for now, yeah. Okay. All right. Other ideas had was the, uh, opiate Anthony dating game. All right. I mean, can you explain the opiate Anthony day? How does it work? Uh, I was thinking about this in a train ride in, um, I don't know. We're thinking about instead of having the standard of asking questions, right? We just have like a really hot girl here and have three guys just do like something like, I don't know, like, like they do something crazy and training me. Well, he knows the train. We got to stop the train. Okay. Yeah. Just, no, just, just have something, just think I'm crazy. We had a brainstorm about it, but that just came up with the basic idea for dating. That hasn't been done on the radio before. Okay. Um, the, uh, remake of the Tom, like his opener, uh, like, it's, I don't think it's gonna be working much longer. So that's stupid too. And then, yeah, what else? My next stupid one is, uh, boob weightlifting, boob weightlifting, boob weightlifting. Yeah. Just tie little harnesses to her boobs and just have them lift. Well, we did the penis weightlifting. So figure include women in this and I don't think ladies boobs are as strong as a guy's junk. Come on. Oh, he's getting a little angry. Um, turning down his idea of boob weightlifting. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, who is the gayest person on the open Anthony show? That was, that's, uh, that's been done on another radio show. Okay. Um, let's lesbian guest the gash. Why was lesbian guest the gash? Okay. Um, I was thinking about lining five women up here and have a six one on the side to, to taste. I, I, I, be careful. Hold on. And, uh, but have, but one of those five would be a person that she knows so she could pick out the person that she knows and she could taste. I saw that on, uh, I saw that on, um, the HBO sex show. Yeah. Yeah. When they show all the sex shows from all over the world, but pretty good idea. Okay. And, uh, there was another one done like that. Another show I saw another showed. Yeah. Had a similar idea. Okay. Yeah. So kind of hard to come up with, uh, you know, original ideas and stuff. We understand. And one more to define tune. If we do a Valentine's day show, um, just to fine tune last year's, uh, not that it needed fine tuning, but, uh, what would a loser do for a date and to qualify, you know, a pathetic story and do create something crazy and stupid. That is what we did last year. That's exactly what we did. Exactly. No, but it wasn't, but we got too drunk so we couldn't like, uh, Oh, we couldn't even do our own content. We couldn't see it all the way through. Cause we were too busy, like, you know, flirting with chicks and getting hammered. Come on. That's, that's what we were supposed to do that last year. I know. All right. What time is it? Oh, it's seven. The show's over. Blah, well drawn. Sorry, Spassk. Go ahead. Those are my ideas. Um, okay. They're very good ones. So that's okay. You're still, you're working on them. That's what counts. One of these days you'll rattle one off out of that book and we'll go, huh, huh, that's a great idea. I hope so. Okay. Uh, the phone's a need answering. Yeah. Wait, someone thinks one of your ideas is funny. Hold on. Chris. Yo, what's up guys? What's up? How you doing, man? All right. Yo, dude, you gotta do that. Which one? One of the boob weightlifting. The boob weightlifting. Oh man. If you guys do that for the God, I'll make the harnesses myself. I remember Chris. Uh, it's not going to happen. Uh, my girls can lift, uh, stuff from their boobs. Like guys can lift stuff from their, uh, from their junk. Yeah. So I, Chris, I know you have a fan out there. What? I know you have a question. Yo, what do you think of that sculpture? You still want the other one? The what? The sculpture, man. Remember the club with the seal? Oh yeah. Yeah. Send it in. Huh? Send it in. No, no, I already sent it in. I said, do you want the other one? Send the other one in. Oh my God. You're talking about something. No one, no one knows what you're talking about, Chris. Remember I brought in the club with the seal. We know. All right. Now do you want the other one about the rusty trombone? You still want that? Send whatever you want in there, Chris. All right. Whatever. All right. All right. All right. Whatever. And you want to talk to your stepfather? As long as he's not going to yell at me, I'm going to get it right up front. If he starts yelling, you hang up on him. Hey, Sal. Yeah. You're not going to start yelling at me. Are you? No yelling. Oh, okay. This is a good call. I've instructed Opie. If you start yelling at me, he has to hang up on you. Well, this is really directed at Opie. So, uh, I feel bad. He doesn't have any place to go for Superbowl. And since you're coming, why doesn't he and Sandy, why don't they come? Oh, really? I've been invited to one of Anthony's functions. Wow. Look at that. Actually, I did a wedding. Uh, one of your- I thought that was pretty good, huh? I like that. I've heard stories. They're legendary. Your Superbowl party, Sal. Oh yeah. We haven't had one in a while. You're supposed to have like 40 people there and stuff. Yeah, that's gonna be sick. All right. Sal's footing the bill. Well, um, I like that. Sal, if, uh, if we're not doing a live broadcast, I'm there. Okay. All right. Yeah, sounds good to me. You get directions from Anthony. Yes, he gets directions from Anthony. I'm just pulling up to Apollo here. Uh-oh, tell the guys I said hi. You want to come help me do the contract? No, God, I remember that. I used to work there and, and Sal used to have to negotiate the contract with my boss and stuff. It was pretty awkward. Just like, oh geez, I got to like a quarter. Tell the guys I said hi though. I will. I'll tell them, uh, turn on the radio so they're not going to listen to me anyway. So all right, Sal. All right. Tell my mommy I said hi. I certainly will. All right. Well, you're definitely coming. I heard you on the air. I taped it. Okay. All right, Sal. Bye Sal. Okay, bye. Nice to know you guys are getting along these days. Oh yeah, we, uh, we all made up. Everything's fine now. Right. They understand. Right. And so do I. Sort of. Uh, Fernando. Yeah, what's up? What's up? Yo, did you see on mankind when he did the, the cactus jack gun thing? Uh, no. You didn't see that after he hit on triple H with the, with that top on the board. Yeah. He goes on, he did the bang bang bang. Oh, all right. Cool. Thanks. Yeah, man. Wrestling. I don't know. I don't know much about wrestling. So, uh, people are out of your freaking minds, man. Everyone's, uh, decided to come up with ideas for our radio show. Jasper. All right. We have to get them on the air. Uh, Jasper. How you doing? All right. Come on. That'd be a great show. You get one of the hosts come in and see what is the shortest Peter's on the, uh, open it. Hold on. Hold on. I'm sorry. Very good. Jasper. Hey, I got a quick joke. Yeah. Black guy in Spanish guy in the back seat of a car. We drive top. You all right. All right. Oh man. We went, we better take a break. Yes. Did we accomplish anything with that break yet? Oh, plenty. We'll have to wait till the end of the show to do. What did we learn on the open Anthony show segment to see what we learned? That's when we truly know we, uh, yeah, we made an impact. We got things accomplished today. It makes me a sleep better at night. Just that segment, knowing that people are learning things from our show. There you go. All right. Um, Oh, and the Valium. I want to, I want to talk about, um, sleep sex next sleep sex. Yeah. Great article in one of the men's magazines. I'm not sure if it was Maxim or details or stop. They love that. I know. I'm sure people that details love the fact that you can't distinguish them from Maxim or vice versa. I see. Percy. Well, maybe because the editor in chief worked at both places. So yeah, confusing. When's he going to come in here again? I don't know. We got to call him up our buddy Mark from, uh, details Mark. Oh, yeah. All right. Let's take a break. We'll be back. The open Anthony show. Okay. Terrific. So many, many, many, yeah. Two seven W N E W. It's opiate Anthony. Hey, hope you're enjoying the festivities today. Gets were sold today. It's official. I guess the NFL has to approve the deal, but, uh, the just for sold to, uh, Johnson and Johnson Johnson, Wood Johnson, the fourth Wood Johnson, Roberts, Robert Wood Johnson, the fourth. Is that a joke? So for the God, hair to the air. I said hair hair, hair to the Johnson Johnson pharmaceutical empire for nearly $635 million Wood Johnson pending league approval Anthony on to how Dick Johnson feels about that thing's slided. And what about Harry Harry Johnson? Did they even ask Harry before they gave it to Robert Wood? I don't know. And then poor little pecker Johnson, the youngest of the Johnson's. All right. What does that, what does it mean for the jets? Uh, what does it mean? Um, stability, Anthony, a little stability for the club. I guess it's better than having a dead guy run it. Uh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's always good if your owner's living and breathing. Wonder what this means for a parcels. Oh, please. Big race is coming back as coach. Come on. They'll offer them up some huge slice of cake edge. Without a doubt. And he'll be in, he'll be in. He'll look like the hero. Damn. Is he a genius? He can't lose next year. Even if, even if the jets go three and 13th, he go, Hey, I came back to try to help the team. I wanted to retire. You brought me back, but I had to come back because there was no one else. Did not leaving for good. Really? Now I'm leaving for CBS to do their play by play. Yeah. Their color commentary as you will. No, I think he's coming back. Yeah, I would think so too. And then who was voted into the hall of fame today? A Fisk and who else was a Perez, the Perez Megan after all. Pudge and Perez make up a class of 2000 hall of fame. Anthony, very excited. You gotta give them a lot of credit. Care. Can't believe we're going to be taking a cause on Johnson and Johnson. My against how would this affect the Q-tip taking a cause? I use the Q-tips all the time. Now, Mikey, you're cleaning the years out. Yeah. I use the Johnson and Johnson. Yeah. Now, how is this going to be? Are they going to be turning green? Is it going to be just green? How can I tell what color the wax is in my ears? If they change the continent on the card swabs to get green. Taking a call to Mikey. That's right to look. All right. Yeah, let them discuss what it means. What it means here. What is it all? I mean, I'll tell you what it means. Uh, mad dog. It means that our ticket prices are going up once again. They'll find some excuse to raise tickets once again this year. I'm going to be there on a cotton ball day. Johnson and Johnson buy the cotton balls for the crowd. A corn removers. Johnson and Johnson corn removal day. It's a day. There you go. Trying to see what else is going on in the news. Angie Everhart was here. Was she here? Yes, Stallone's old squeeze. Yeah. What is she in Playboy or something? What's the deal with that? She's doing a spread in Playboy. Yeah, she did a spread on my bed. Why? Yes, why? Better than Adrian. I gotta tell you that much. Did you, uh, did you crap on her? Oh, yeah, I appreciate doing that kind of thing. You know, like, uh, crap it on people. Yeah. I mean, women, I usually crawl underneath the glass table and have like, crap on my face. Mm-hmm. Crap on me, Mickey! Mickey, crap on me! Ah! Ah! Well, if you don't know the story, there was a... I was like a boxer and I met her and she was real ugly, you know? Yeah. And then I started winning fights and she came up and got out and, oh wait, I was Asian. Yeah. There were three hookers, ex-hookers from Hollywood, that wrote a book and they named names and stuff. And, uh, they named Sylvester Stallone and they, they swear it's true. Yeah. We cannot confirm on this radio show. No, but it's in that book. It's in that book. Uh, I'll get the name. Mm-hmm. I just don't have it on me now. Uh, Sylvester Stallone. Yeah. Liked. Crapping. Onto. Glass tables. No, I like... Oh, no, no, no! Okay, I'm sorry. I'm under the table. I'm sorry, I got the details wrong. I'm sorry. I'm saying that so casually. Can you imagine someone in their car like, what? What? How could you just casually say that? No, okay. No, Sylvester Stallone was under the table. I was under the table. The glass table. And the broad would be on top and take a dump on my face. You know, while I... Mickey! ...on top of the glass table and he would be under it. Yeah. According to this book from an ex-hooker in LA. You ain't never seen nothing like it. I'll tell you that right. Imagine that. Well, that's gotta be some view. That's why all my glass tables have, like, windshield wipers on them. Like the spray that comes out. Wipes are clean. That's just beyond bizarre. Mickey! Mickey! Come on me, Mickey! And so Angie Everhart was here. Yeah. She was on the Radio Chick show. Gotta say, she's not that hot. No? Ben, you saw her? Hot? Yeah, she's hot. Oh, she's hot? I don't know. It's all right. It's not ugly or anything, but I was expecting much better. Really? Yeah. I didn't see her. Any pics? Everyone was in that, like, studio behind you. Oh, where the Scooby-Doo eyes come from behind the glass? Yeah. It's so funny. We got pretty much like a room with people who go in and you can't tell if you're being stared at from that other room. Yeah. So everybody was piled in there taking a look at her. Freaking people around here. Wasn't that impressive? No, huh? I gotta see a picture. Mike Adams was drooling, really? Well, I hear the spread is unbelievable. That's Mike. I hear the spread is unbelievable, but they can do miracles in a little airbrushing and all that stuff. Little nip and tuck here with the old digital manipulator. She's all right. Oh, here it is. Sleep sex, Anthony. Sleep sex. It was details. Fine magazine that we like to read. Yes. You think this is true? What? Uh, a few lucky men combined two of life's greatest pleasures, sex and sleep. When a 41 year old Silicon Valley executive woke up one morning, he was well into his wife and it wasn't his first such lewd awakening for 15 years. He's been a sleep sexer. What sleep experts call men who get busy when they're asleep. One time my wife told me I placed myself in front of her face. I phrased my request in a way I normally wouldn't, says Sam, says Sam, not his real name. It struck me as being a little impolite, just a tad. Probably, you know, suck my sound improbable. It's not even uncommon. According to Dr. David Blah Blah, head of blah blah. I hate when they do that in articles. Dr. David Saul Rosenfeld, head of the Kaiser Permanent Sleep Clinic in L.A. care, who, uh, who's recently published sleep sex study was prompted by a woman who noticed her rather stayed boyfriend was unusually kinky and aggressive during their early morning sessions, often biting and talking dirty. Anthony, she loved it. Yeah. Until she noticed he was snoring and wasn't remembering a lick of it later. A lick. It's part of what Mark Mahowald, MD at the MD professor of neurology at the University of blah blah blah blah blah blah. Dad! Right. Calls, uh, Confusional Arousal, a state somewhere between Confusional. Confusional Confusional Arousal, a state somewhere between sleep and wakefulness. I've never heard the word Confusional. C-O-N-F-U-S-I-O-N-A-L, right? Confusional has to be, uh, I guess only guys do this. All right. Trying to say. It happens in males that are particularly common. Uh, it's common in guys who are sleep deprived or have a history of sleepwalking. Hmm. My hubby does sleep sex. Ah ha ha. There you go. Let's see. Cheryl. Hello. Your husband does sleep sex. Yes, he does. Really? And I like when he sleeps. I tell him to go to sleep more often. Why? Is he just a completely different person? Yeah, actually, um, when I first, when I first met him, I was really into him. So one night I snuck over his house at like two o'clock in the morning. I figured I'd surprise him. You know, I walked him just a negligee on and stuff. And we had sex and then the next day I was talking to him and he didn't even know we did it. So I, he said I was sleeping for it. So I figured he was probably drunk or something. So then now we're married and we first, one night I just woke up and he was there. He was on top of me and it was completely different. And he was talking dirty and he, and it, um, it was, it was like, we're off. It was like a whole different person. And then, um, I was talking to him about the next day and he said, show, I have, I have no idea what you're talking about. He says, I don't remember any of this. And now all I gotta do is lean over and just touch him in a private part and he's there in a second. No kidding. She's okay. Sleep. Sex every night if I want. That's wild. Well, does he ever go too far though? And really get just over the top wild. Um, and then he could use that as an excuse that, Hey, I don't remember that. It was sleep. Sex and no actually it's, it's, I mean, it's, it's more wild than normal only because it's, um, it's a little bit more aggressive. Right. And he'll, and he'll even talk and he'll talk dirty and everything. Right. Um, but it's never gotten to the point where I've had to stop them, you know, and it's, it's not really a long time either. It's basically just until he gets to the, to when he's finished. Right. It's, it's, it's so good though that it doesn't matter to me, you know, right. But, uh, yeah, and I've been married to him for almost 10 years and if I wanted to, I could do it every single night. All right. Well, I guess it's happening then. Thank you, show. Cause I, cause Mark Golan has a, has a way of kind of sneaking some fake stories every once in a while. Yeah. To see if anyone would, you know, believe it is paying attention. I don't think he does it anymore. I would believe it. Maybe not to that extent. Yeah. I believe it. Cause, uh, you've never, you've never woke up in the middle of the night and you were doing things to your, uh, chick. I, what happens is I just take all my clothes off while I'm sleeping. I wake up in just a wild stay. Sometimes what do you sleep in? Little jammy selfie. Yeah, I do it. Do you? No, I don't idiot. Well, how could you sleep in the nude? You sleep in your jeans and your freaking, uh, leather coat. How do you sleep? Well, you're saying you take your clothes off in your sleep. Yeah. I got like whatever sweats, long johns. Oh, so you're in bed and you're wearing sweats and long johns. I don't know if it's a dream I'm having or not, but also I'll just get, I'll just get freaky and just like get freaky, get naked and then, you know, hope to get something going on and maybe that's the problem. Maybe you're wearing too many clothes to bed to get laid off. Jesus Christ. You go to bed just like Kenny from South. I didn't say I had a problem with my sex life. Anthony. No, no, I'm usually, I think like every guy out there, I want more and more and more, but, uh, it's not like, it's not like it's, uh, completely dried up there. It was just weird. I didn't know you, uh, went to sleep, but clothed like that. Yeah, I can't. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. A lot of guys sleep naked. I just, I can, but I was wondering. That's all. All right. So after sex, what do you do? You get dressed again? No, it depends when it happened. Like you're, you're, it's, it's nighttime, right? You go to bed, you're fiddling around a little bit. You get into some sex, you finish. If I, if I pass out, then yeah, whatever. Then I don't need to get my clothes back. And I know, but that's like, there will be times you'll just like get dressed. Okay. All right. This guy wants to abuse us. Vin, what's up? Yeah, guys, big fan of your show, but I'm real left down the way of ripping Angie Eberhardt, just cause Stern got a date with her. Um, we're ripping up for that dude. Honestly. I agree. She's all right. She's all right. I didn't say, I didn't say her, so I don't even have a comment. I've made out with better than that. You okay. You would throw her out of bed. I didn't say I would throw out her bed, but it's no big deal. No big deal to supermodel man. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't put her in the supermodel category. What I saw today. I'm sorry. All right. Well, and then I know it was a coincidence, but I know she used to sleep with was five to one. Have you been listening to our show? I said, I like to the fact is we passed on her. There's nothing she's going to add to our radio show. We completely passed on her. Guys, you let me down. I think, I think she's hot. I'm trying to realize. I don't know what I'm arguing at, what you're used to, but. Wait, Vin. I'm trying to see how we let this guy down. Yeah, Vin, why did we let you down? You think she's hot. A lot of people think she's hot. I looked at her and said, ah, she's no big deal. That's, that's, that's life. Yeah, but she, I don't know. I understand. My point is that if Stern didn't ask her out or he didn't have her on, you guys wouldn't say this. And I'm a big fan of you too. Ah, that's so. That dude. Wow. That is. You're reaching there. You're really reaching. Am I? You can call us out if you want, but you're reaching on that one. I'm serious. It's really no big deal. All right. Hey, if I'm reaching out to you guys, but I feel like. Just, you know, if she wasn't on his show, you guys are like, ah, she was on here. She's so hot. Blah, blah, blah. The fact is. The fact. She's nothing, nothing special. She was offered to, she was offered to us, I don't know, a few weeks ago and we passed on her. We're like, there's nothing she could really offer to the show. My bad. I apologize. Apologize to you guys. I'd rather have two girls in here that have never kissed before on the lesbian couch and hear her babble about nothing. Nothing. I agree with you there. I'd rather have that too, but I'm still facing five. That's all. She's not. She's not a dog. I'm not. But, you know, I was expecting, I don't know, better, I guess. Understandable. All right. I've never seen her in real life. So I mean, I'll take you guys work for it because everything you said the last couple of years I've been listening to has been true. So I'll take that. She's, I mean, obviously if I, if I said, wow, she's a dog or ugly, duh, no, I mean, she's. All right. I mean, but I guess she's just not my type. OK, I'm taking it back, man. Jesus, get off my ass. You got to run. All right, man. All right, take it easy. Bye. Well, we got to talk to some of these people. This could get wild. Uh, Stephen. Yes, how are you guys? Hey. I got a story. You guys are just talking about doing things while people are sleeping, not realizing it. Sleep sex, yes. Well, my fiance, she does it in a sleep. One morning I woke up to her, you know, moaning and trying to move under the covers and so I. No, she pulled on the covers and there she is doing her deed to herself. Whoa. And she's completely asleep. Completely asleep. That is a major turn on. So what I did is I pulled down her panties and she. All right, be careful. So he just like, he's opportunity right there. Were you able to work your way in or what? Well, so I did the I did the normal thing. I was like that first and then I. Pleasure, you know, I just be careful. So basically, basically you joined in. Yeah, I did. And I did the oral part. Did she ever wake up? Not at first. And then I just got to around and I woke up. I couldn't deal with it. She said, oh, I was sleeping. I wasn't doing nothing. So we went away on vacation. Yeah. And then she is in the hotel room doing the same thing again. Yeah. So I said, that's it. I bought a video camera because we're on vacation. Oh, man. So I sent a video on it and I'm doing what I have to do to her. And she has no clue. So about 15 minutes later, I woke her up and she's like, what are you doing? Get off me. I'm like, you started it. She's like, how? I played back the video. She's like, that's me. You have no clue. Awesome. Very good. You guys are great. Have a good time. Thank you, Stephen. Bye. All right, listen, we got to take a quick break. There's a ton of people on hold. All you guys on hold stay right there. Everyone has a story about sleep sex, and including Sean, just to make sure he stays. Sean, we're going to you next. We got to take a quick break. All right. You got it. Sean swears he had anal sleep sex. I wonder who the guy was. Oh, come on. I'm kidding. Stop. Opie and Anthony. Those guys are fast. 127 WNEW. It's the Opie and Anthony Show on 1027 WNEW. So on the train last night, I have two choices, Anthony. I could read all about the Time Warner AOL merger. Yes. Big news. Huge news. Huge merger. Yeah. It's going to pretty much affect every single person on this planet. That much? Pretty much. Close to it. Or I could read an article on sleep sex. Opt for the sleep sex. I opted for the sleep sex. I didn't really believe it, but the listeners are calling in like crazy saying, yeah, it's happening. Oh, yeah, it's happening all over the place. So let's continue the discussion, excuse me, with Sean. Now his phone sucks. Sean. No, no, no, no. OK. I'm going to the car. OK. This is worth it, man. Trust me. My god. OK. What is this? The Weather Channel Live report from a hurricane? Yes. It's not like the news, man. Outro. Why are we outside, man? Because I have to get to another phone. OK. All right. So this is the story. All right. You've got to keep it really clean for the radio. I'm trying. You know the story. All right. Use the balloon knot for the back door. You know, talking coat. OK, you got it. All right, again. About a month ago, this was, I was recently moving, so I had to stay on the couch. So my girlfriend stayed over. So we're both, I would just say, in spoon position. Right. OK. So she's sleeping. I didn't know it. So I'm working something out. And I said, why not get it in there? All right, listen. OK, OK. All right. Hold on. I'll clean up. Wait. You don't understand what sleep sex is. No, no, no. The person that is asleep is the one that is trying to have sex. I mean, what you're doing is basically rape. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen. You're having sex with your girlfriend that's unconscious. She turns around. Yeah. I had a full session in one way, the regular way. Right. Then toward the end, we worked toward the balloon knot. All right. She asked for it. So I give it to her, right? All right. Be careful, OK? OK. So we wake up in the morning. I'm happier than a pig in crap, you know? So I talked to her about it, gloating. I said, yeah, you know, I gave it to you good last night, huh? She's that fat, huh? And she's, no, she's 5'7". Listen to you. Yeah, I gave it to you pretty good last night, didn't I? Yeah, I was proud of her. Well, you did say pig in crap. OK. No, no, not at all. All right. 5'7", blonde, 112 pounds. She runs for college on a scholarship, so picture the body. Right. So she turns around and tells me, what are you talking about? So we argue about it for five or 10 minutes. I finally look down. I got a little proof on me, so I show it to her. There she goes. She's good to go. She believes me. Because I got a ride to the gravy stand. All right, all right. I got the point. Later. Oh, he didn't get the train. Everyone knows the train. Claude, you're next on the show. What's up? Yeah, what's up, guys? I had a friend who was sick in the hospital. And I had to sleep over, so I wouldn't sleep in the visitor's lounge. And it happens that I had a wet dream. I wake up. It's about 10 in the morning. And there's like 10 people in the visitor's lounge. And they're staring at me. I don't know what took. Was I like humping the sofa? Oh, my god. He was probably humping the sofa, I guess. I know. Sandy, let's try to get this on track. What's going on? Hi. I have a sleep-sick story from a few years back. OK. My ex-boyfriend, at the time, we had just started seeing each other. So we were kind of pretty hot and heavy, you know, the way it is in the beginning. And he was very sleep-sick. Because we used to stay up late a lot. And one morning, one night in the middle of the night, he rolled over. And he just started. His hands were everywhere. OK. OK. It must have lasted about five minutes. And I realized he was asleep. But it felt so good that I was like fine with it. He woke up. And he was so embarrassed by what he was doing that he tried to stop. And now he goes back to sleep. And I'm laying there. He's ready to go. And he's done. But I had to wake him back up and like make him finish. That's funny. It was pretty funny. It was the one and only time it ever happened to me. Very good. But you enjoyed it? Oh, yeah. Why did you enjoy it? Because he was just like another person pretty much? Why didn't he enjoy it? Why did you enjoy it more than just the usual way? Because he seemed like a different person. He seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. There was nothing involved beforehand. There was no real kind of foreplay. It was just kind of like all they are all at once, which was real different. You know? OK. It was cool. Very good. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. You have to reach over, though. And you're like, you know, Amy just hung up. And we like hearing from the ladies. They could explain a little better. When you're totally asleep, kind of reach over and start like, fiddling, petting the poodles. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, oh, my God. What am I doing? Petting the poodle. Petting the poodle. Chico wants to explain why sleep sex is better. Chico, what do you have? Yeah, I ain't doing. Listen, I don't understand what's going on. Some people don't even know what sleep sex is all about. All right. Hey, Chico, we're trying to guess races today. Yeah, I understand that. All right. Let me let me. So can you talk a little more? Yeah, sure. The thing is, when you live with a woman for 15 years, then you get more. I got it. I got it. You're Irish. No, no, no, no. Ah, damn. You're all from Puerto Rican. Ah, see? That was my second choice. Yeah, sure. Yeah, all right. I guess you can't do that all the time. No. I guess someone's raised by their voice. He totally sounded Irish. He didn't sound Puerto Rican at all. Yeah. All right, go ahead, Chico. Yeah, I mean. Oh, Chico, that should have gave it away. Wow. Wow. Even the name. Damn. Yeah, man, you live with a woman for 15 years, right? Now, women are the ones that are mostly complaining. But I don't hear really no guys complaining, right? Now, the thing is, they go in and you get home from work all tired. You go to sleep, right? Now, you actually, when you get home, you thinking you're going to find something beautiful. But after looking at all these women outside, and they got these beautiful figures, right? And this beautiful body. And you get home and you see a 500 pound monkey with a mustache, you're going to not want to have sex with them. Oh, my god. You understand what I'm saying? A 500 pound monkey with a mustache. Yeah, you know? So you get home. You go lay down, right? After you do whatever you got to do. Then you'll be dreaming about having sex with these beautiful women. So when you finally wake up, you're on top of that 500 pound monkey. That's what I'm saying? It almost feels like that hot supermodel from the street, right? OK. Exactly. Be careful with the curse in there. So I mean, you catch yourself. But after you're done, you're like, oh, no problem. Meanwhile, the monkey's thinking everything is fine. You understand what I'm saying? I'm thinking, oh, I know I was great. But when you get up in the morning and you finally realize what you've done, you're like, oh, my god, I did it again. And then the 500 pound monkey is having a whole bunch of little monkeys. All right, guys. You're in hell, Chico, aren't you? Take care. Yeah, bye bye. Pay attention in the barn instead of trying to pick up the women at 5 to 4 AM. Joyce, you're next on the radio show. What's going on? Hi, how are you? Great. I just want to tell you that sometimes I prefer that. I prefer the middle of the night to the middle of the day. Only because it's such a surprise. I'm expecting a baby every five months pregnant. So I really have energy during the day. I come home from work. I go to sleep, whatever. And then, listen, there's a surprise. Sometimes I initiate it. Really? Oh, yeah. It's much better. But is one of either you or him completely asleep when he's going on? He is completely out. Completely out. I'll wake up and I'll say, OK, let's see if I can get him started. Oh, that'll take more than 30 seconds. Wow. Yes. All right. Thank you, Joyce. Take care. OK. Kelly, you're next. Kelly. Hi. Hi, you're on the radio. OK, well, first of all, this happens to me and my boyfriend all the time. And he'll be the deepest sleeper. And he'll just wake up. He'll wake me up in the middle of the night. And he'll be doing stuff to me. And I love it. But also, it's happened to me before, where I've done it to my ex-boyfriend. And I woke up in the middle of the night. And I was touching him. And I didn't even know it. The next day, he woke me up. And he said, do you remember doing that last night? And I had no idea. I think it happens to girls and guys. That's so erotic, man. Yeah, well, what can I say? That rocks, right? Come on. Why's everyone laughing at me? All right, you guys, take it easy. Thank you, Kelly. Bye. Bye. You don't think that's cool? Awesome. Chris, what's up? Nothing. What's going on, guys? All right, man. Listen, one night, sleeping, wake up to my old lady, moaning and groaning a little bit. She's having an orgasm right next to me. I'm not even touching her. She's not even touching herself. What do you think about that? And she's completely asleep? Totally asleep. I'd love to check that out. I mean, it was cool. But I wish I was in on it a little bit. Nah, man, you got to sit back and just watch that. That doesn't come around every day. That's something you go, wow, I'm going to check this out. You know. What are you going to do? All right. All right, guys, I got to go. Thank you, Chris. Bye. Rob? Hey, Rob. Rob? Yeah. You're next on 1027WATW. Hey, what's up, guys? How's it going? Good. Hope, you were talking before about how you have to get dressed afterwards to go back to sleep. No. I was mis-interpreting it. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It all depends on what's going on. Well, I don't know. I guess it's a little crazy, a little whacked out. But no matter what, I have to go to sleep with socks on. So even after sex with my wife, I'll turn around. Even if I find myself just starting to pass out, I'll have to throw my socks back on like my feet get dry. They touch. They drive me nuts if anybody touches my feet. So no matter what, even afterwards, I still got to get back up, throw the socks back on. And I can just go to bed stock naked, just socks on. Kind of odd, waking up in the morning, going to make a pot of coffee with, you know, the twins hanging out and wearing a pair of socks. The twins. Actually, you're twigging berries. No, that's funny, though. Thank you, Rob. No problem. Take it easy, guys. All right. We'll take two more. We like hearing from the ladies. Kelly? Yeah. A lot of Kelly's checking in today. How are you? All right. How you guys doing today? You got a sleep-sex story? Oh, god, yeah. My husband does this to me all the time. I was having this dream one night. I was on the love boat. And Captain Steubing was walking me around the love boat. Oh, god. My husband's like, I'm so sleepy. And Isaac, your bartender gave you the high-hard one? No. He was. Gopher started nibbling. No, no, no. No, listen. No, listen. Captain Steubing is walking me around the love boat. My husband is diddling me while I'm asleep. And I look over at Captain Steubing, and he's got his hand on me, and he's working me. Captain Harold Steubing. Did Julia, your cruise director, give you a blast of Coke and then go south? You know, and I mean, I guess I started getting into an awesome Captain Steubing turn into my cat. And I think that's because my husband was using the P word. Right. You know? Captain Steubing on the love boat. The next thing I know, I'm expecting my cat on the love boat. Give me some bald head. Hey, ooh. That's funny. You're into that Meryl Steubing look? With his wacky little captain uniform and his big bald head, bald head. I have a uniform. All right, Kelly. Thank you. Thanks, guys. It's one of those wacky dreams, though, that just goes all over the ball field. Some of those are pretty funny. I hate those. Captain Steubing. Turns into the cat. Yeah, and you don't think twice about it. Right, and you dream. It's a stupid dream. You wake up like, oh, that makes sense. You want to tell the whole world, and then you start remembering details. Wait a minute. Oh, maybe I should keep this one in myself. That made no sense. Jesse. Hello. How are you? Good. I pretend to be having sleep-sack sometimes. You have sleep-sack? No, I pretend to. I pretend I'm asleep, because that way, you can do the things that you would normally do that you won't. You know what I mean? You put on a personality that you don't want him to know that you have. And what do you usually pretend? Usually I start by pleasuring myself, because I know that kind of turns him on. And you can't do that when you're awake? I don't. I like for him to think that I'm a little bit more inferior than that. Right. So when I pretend that I am, then I am a lot more wild. So you make believe you're completely out cold, and you're playing with yourself, knowing he's watching. You open your eyes, and it's wild to see if he's checking it out. Absolutely. And then he'll start, and we'll talk dirty. We'll do the whole night. And it's absolutely insane sex, because he thinks I'm completely asleep the next morning. He'll be like, oh my god, you have no idea what you did. I'll be like, oh, no, you're right. That's not me. And I can't believe I did that. Right. And so I get to keep the whole denier act up at the same time. You ladies have a racket, I'm telling you. Jesus. That's awesome. Yeah, he pretty much seems to enjoy it, too. Very good. Thank you. All right, Jesse. I think Jesse has the best story of the day. That was pretty good. All right, we got to take another quick break. I think we could do one more segment on this that people are calling like crazy. Oh, yeah. Sleep sex with Asians, lost gum, and girls. Oh my god. Look at line four. That one's great. Girl likes to sleep with junk in her mouth. Like a pacifier. If you're a faithful listener to the show, it's great to talk in code and everyone knows what you're talking about. Line 10, sleep sex first time with balloon knot. We'll get to more of your calls in just a bit. Don't forget, today is Tuesday. Looking for a bunch of people to join the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Anthony. Absolutely. I guess we could go to this little ditty from Airsick Productions. I think they explain the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, right? Yes. People love this damn thing. Hummerlovin' on 1027 WNEW. Hummerlovin' on Tuesday Night. Hummerlovin', it feels so right. I got my girl down on her knees. Wonder if he will do me. Time is done. He's shinin' gone. Oh, I will love Tuesday Night. Hummer, hummer, hummer, hummer. Hummer, hummer, hummer, hummer. Hello. Tell me more, tell me more. We don't care where we are. Tell me more, tell me more. Do we fight in the car? She came to me. I dropped my pants. You owe this to Althea and Ant.

Tell me more, tell me more. Now can you do my friend? I exploded. That's where it ends. I have got the world's best girlfriend. I love to be in his lap. Think it's time. Oh, I took a nap. Hummer's done. There's more to come. But those hummer. Now I'm living long. Living long. I love this bed. Yeah, baby. You're going to get it. I'm going to slam it in you, baby. That's what it sounds like. It's like porno music. Yeah. You turn over. You lock it in the butt. 1027 WNEW. Hey, Sophie and Anthony. Yeah, baby, don't wake up. Use the sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Where do we go? Where do we go? Where do we go? All right, let's go to Larry. Hey, Larry, you're next on the program. What's going on? Hey, how you doing, guys? I got a story about sleep sex for you. OK. I went on vacation last summer with a friend of mine, just friends, and she's hot. She's so hot. Like 5'3", tight little swimmer's body, big, like, 36D chest. So we're going on vacation. Our hotel reservations get messed up. So we have to sleep in the back of my truck. So in the middle of the night, all of a sudden, she, like, rolls over on top of me and just starts going at it. Yeah. Just, oh, so good. This girl is so hot. To this day, she has no idea. You didn't even bring it up the next day? Nope. You know, I had a crush on her, and, like, things never worked out. So she never said anything the next day? She had no idea. To this day, she has no idea. Did you guys do it? Do it? What? Did you do it? Do it? Oh, yeah. Really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. She had to have known. Maybe she did, but, you know, I don't know. I was afraid to bring it up because I brought it up before. I tried to get with her. It never happened. Yeah. And then I just figured that was nice. Right. That was awesome. Go on. That sounds like you remember it like it was yesterday. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. All right, Larry. All right, guys. Thank you. Later. Wow, that's cool. What's up? What's up, guys? Not much. You guys are on a bundle of wool. Just want to say that. Oh, thanks. Listen, I played in a band. It's not quite sex, but at the same time, it's a sleep story. I played in a band. We used to rehearse at the best person's house. I went to Michael Todd's place, sleeping out cold. Got stopped out of nowhere. Just like that. Out of nowhere. I don't know what they dumped out of, but basically... Yeah, he took a leak on the wall. Oh, sorry, guys. And what? He was asleep? He was asleep. He gets back. He gets back over to the couch. Out. Back to sleep. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Not quite sex, but... Yeah, not quite like it, but it just blew me away. We were like, we're dying. Right. Well, thank you, Richie. All right, guys. Bye. Bye. Dominic, you're next on the program. What's going on? Hey, what's going on, there, big guy?

Alright thank you. Alright buddy. Alright bye. Alright Jesus, you said that like it was new. Hey you guys suck, hey I'm with the pro-gret. Jack! Hey how you guys doing? Good. Several years ago I was dating this very hot Asian woman. I don't know how you guys feel about Asian women but a really beautiful Asian woman. Hey hey. Can you hear me? Yeah I got it. So the only problem she was very kind of prim and proper and kind of boring and just wasn't all that exciting and one night I'm sound asleep and it's like the chick out of Ghostbusters. Okay she wakes me up, she's got like two heads on herself just ripping me apart. I mean I wake up the next morning, I got like bruises on me, I'm scratched. It's like at a point where she has completely pulled a sybil and I asked her I said what happened last night and she said the rest of my relationship all she did was a little meek smile and that was the last episode for the little episode. I guess every now and then you just got to let it loose. There you go. It was a beautiful thing. Thanks for sharing today Jack. You got it man. On the instant feedback, Kevin from New Jersey Anthony. Yeah. Isn't this subject painfully close to crossing the border of rape? Yeah well we're talking about the person being asleep initiating the sex. Yeah I guess that's the big difference. Yeah. If you look over and you see like you know your lady completely out cold and then you decide you're going to have your way with her because she's not going to wake up. That might be a little different than what we're trying to talk about here today. Yes. Just a little bit. Especially if you don't know her. Yeah. Could get a little rough. Could get a little rough. Maybe she should lock her windows at night. I'm just waiting for Spaz and with Jennifer on hold so we can move on here. Oh yeah. Thank you. That's it. That's it. Hey Jennifer. Yeah. You got something to add to this or what? Well basically this is a story from college. I had gone out with my sorority. Got a little drunk. Was coming back to my boyfriend's dorm and for the life of me in this dorm I could never find his room because all the rooms looked the same to me whatever. So I guess I went in and by the way I didn't know this. I went into an Amish guy's bed and ripped naked, climbed into bed with him and tried to start stuff. Wow. I guess he wrapped me up in a blanket and brought me to my boyfriend's room and asked is this yours? Oh the Amish aren't they nice? But I guess a couple weeks later he dropped out of school. Really? Yeah I hope I didn't have anything to do with that. I'd have banged you. Quite honestly a naked girl just crawls in your bed and starts doing things. You're getting slammed. What's very scary is no one actually knows except for him. He's guilt ridden now. Yeah that's why he dropped out. Screwed him up. He's probably building barns every weekend now because he's a barn raiser. He's raised something in his pants and he's all guilty. Alright Jennifer. Alright thanks you guys talked. Thank you. Bye. Women listeners Anthony. Of course we do. Debbie you're next on N.E.W. Hi. I never called in before but I've been listening. I'm driving home and I just have to say this happens to me all the time when I'm asleep. My husband will tell me the next morning when we woke up that last night was great and I'll be like what? Or all the time. Really? I sleep when I fall asleep I can have complete conversations with people and not even realize I was active. I think I slept fine the whole night through. I don't remember anything. So what do you do when you're sleeping? Apparently I become aggressive. We'll be asleep and he'll come over and give me a kiss goodnight and I'll start kissing him and that's it. Then I'll wake up the next day and I don't remember it and he'll bring it up and I'll be like and he's like I knew it you were sleeping again. Like he doesn't know. He doesn't know if I'm asleep or awake because my eyes are wide open and I'm talking to him but I'm passed out. That's creepy. It is a little creepy. Sleepwalking where your eyes are open that's creepy. But you just turned into an animal when you were sleeping? Well either way but yeah he says I satisfy him. That's cool. But it's funny because I used to do an overnight shift at a job. I had to stop because I was like helping people and letting them in and not even remembering until the next day when I rung them up and everything. Wow. Yeah but that's it. Alright Debbie. I love your show. I listen to you every day on the way home. Hey thank you. How's the traffic today? It sucks. I'm on Southern State right now. And it's really bad. All I see is our tail lights. Pretty much sucks every day doesn't it Debbie? No actually there are days that are worse than other. I don't know if there's an accident up ahead because I see lights flashing lights but okay. Alright Debbie thank you. Bye bye. I just don't understand traffic. It just sucks every day. Every day. Everyone knows their alternate routes. You know? Yeah. Why do you need someone to tell you where the traffic is every day? Well that never works either. They tell you where the jam is. You avoid it and there's a jam where they told you to go. Right. Can't win Anthony. No. Hey Mark what's up? Yo what's going on dog? Yo I've had sleep sets so many times and it's like you just wake up and you're like alright well I guess I might as well keep on railroading. I mean I'm already half way in. Oh my god. But there's other times right? Uh huh. Where I'll like have dreams. You know the dreams that don't make any sense or whatever? Oh yeah. You know like somebody's like in a movie theater and obviously somebody's jumping over at you and all of a sudden they're like ow! And she's like what are you doing? I'm like oh my god I just punched somebody in the G. I just punched my girlfriend in the head. I'm like oh sorry about that. Yeah I've gotten violent lately in my sleep too. Have you? Yeah throwing elbows and all sorts of stuff. Really? Oh yeah. Knocking the headboard. I nailed Sandy in the head one night really hard and I don't know what I was dreaming. Yeah sure you weren't dreaming. I know. No come on Mark. Thank you. I hate it when everybody says you suck. Right. Anyway you suck. Probably later. Right. We just can't come up with anything better. No. Hey Law what's up? Hey what's up guys? Alright. Hey big fan. Why don't you know that? Thank you. Yeah? I hope you. I went to college in western New York too. Uh, Fredonia State. Oh my God. Listen I knew this girl out there. She used to tell me that when she went to go to bed, when she went to go to sleep she had an oral fixation and even if she was in bed with just a friend or whatever she had to put you know junk in her mouth before sleeping. In bed with just a friend. Yeah she said like it didn't matter she just had an oral fixation and that's what she had to do. Man it goes back to the college stories. Yeah. I slept with friends that were girls all the time. Yeah. I swear to you man. Well this one is like. Oh it's just a friend. Yeah let me put my, your junk in my mouth. I don't be afraid of you. I don't be afraid that since she was sleeping she might just like have a dream that she was eating something or biting down. You know what I mean? I was like did she dream she was eating a carrot or something? I'm screwed. Yeah you really are. That scared me. Hey listen guys. I'm a PA for Comedy Central. Can I give a little plug to the Upright Citizens Brigade? There you go. Hey we had those guys in here man. They made us laugh our butts off. Yeah. Yeah watch them. The new season starts the 17th at 10.30. Alright cool. I've been watching. Alright guys. Tell the guys we said hi they might remember us. They were in here probably a year ago. After they pulled that gag on Al Roker with the big dildo. Swing? Yeah. God damn that was so friggin funny. Awesome. The new season is coming up. Watch it. Alright. Alright guys. Now we got to explain that because we have a ton of new listeners. Yeah. How was it? Upright Citizens Brigade. Right. Went to. Well one of the characters acts like he's a little kid. But he's got a tremendous schlong. Right. It's a disease Anthony. Yeah. And I guess the disease makes his schlong really huge. And the problem is he doesn't think that he's, there's anything wrong with him. Yeah and you can't tell him anything's wrong because you'll give him a complex. Right. So he jumps around with this big dildo hanging out of his pants. Right. And they went to the Today Show. And Al Roker's doing the weather outside. And one of the Upright Citizens Brigade guys had a sign that says I want to be a soldier. And he was like, I want to marry me somebody, some girl's name. And he was all excited to get Al Roker's attention. So Al Roker comes over and starts talking about his proposal. You know, who do you want to marry? He goes, oh my God, I can't believe you. You're over here. I got this sign, marry me, marry or whatever it was. And he's jumping around like he's all excited. And he's telling the camera, Mary I love you. Please I want you to marry me. And Al Roker's looking all proud that he found someone in the crowd. This is like a news story. Behind the guy now, jumping up and down like a monkey, is the guy with the tremendous dildo between his legs. And he's holding it up right in the camera. You see some guy jump behind this guy that's proposing with a huge rubber dildo in his hand. Al Roker's horrified. He goes, oh well, let's go over here. I almost peed myself. I swear to you. It was a great prank. Yeah, Upright Citizens Brigade. Yeah, they're funny guys. I've cut the show a few times. Ozzy, what's up? Hey, you guys roll, bro. All right. Yeah, guys, look, I had one night stand with this model for my company. And we did it. Then I went to bed. Then I woke up again. She was right on top of me. You woke up with her on top? Right on top, man. I was like, oh my Lord. Wow. Great. Lord. That was the greatest thing ever. That was optional. Hey, you guys roll. That was all, bro. All right. Bye. God damn. All right, let's take a break. All right, man. There's a couple more girls that want to get in before we change the subject. So we'll get to them next. Okay? Cool. Opie, boring, Anthony, boring, producer Rick, boring, spaz, yay, yay, yay. The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW. What are you doing? I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. I'm doing a show. 1027 and WNEW. It's Opie and Anthony. I want to try to move on to other things here. Let's see what Christine has real fast as we wrap up the sleep sex segment on the show, Ant. Yeah. Christine, what do you have? I have the most awesome sex in my sleep. Really? Unfortunately, my husband doesn't get it. What do you mean? I'm asleep and I think I'm giving him good satisfaction, but he's not getting any. It's just me pleasuring myself in my sleep. Oh, and you're dreaming. Yeah, but it's way better than anything I've ever had in real life. Gee. Poor guy. That's pretty bad. Does he catch you sleeping and playing with yourself? Every once in a while he catches me and then he gets it good, but I'm telling you, for me it's the best. In your dreams you're thinking you're doing your husband? Most of the time. Wow. Loving these stories today. Well, thank you, Christine. Have a good night, guys. Bye. Bye. Not bad. Everyone wants to talk about sleeping now. Ray, what's up? Hey, how's it going, guys? All right. Hey, my ex-girlfriend used to induct me into the Hummer Club, but she would never finish. One night we were sleeping and she starts getting frisky with me. And I'm like, okay, this is good. And she starts calling me by another name. And she's saying, Sal, I want you so bad. Sal, I'm thinking, my name's not Sal, but I'll play along with this. And she's going, Sal, Sal, I want you. Sal, let me induct you into the Hummer Club. So I'm like, this is cool. I'm sure I'm going to affect them people while they're sleeping. This is good. And she starts going for it. And I'm getting close and I'm getting close. And she's like, give it to me, Sal, give it to me. And I did. And I basically drowned her. She started gagging and choking and going up saying, you know, she wakes up and she is screaming at me. What are you doing? What are you doing? And I just looked at her calmly and said, well, who's Sal? That wasn't me. It was Sal. Do you know any Sal's? Sal is her personal trainer. Oh, so you know the guy she's talking about. I know the guy she's talking about and she was in her sleep. She was thinking she was doing him. And it doesn't bother you? She's my ex-girlfriend. Oh, there you go. You guys rule. Take care. Thank you. One more and we'll move on. Donna. Yes. I think we're going to finish up with you. What's up? I was just saying, I don't know if this constitutes, but I love to wake up my boyfriend every morning with a Hummer. Oh, there you go. That's pretty nice. That is a very nice lady right there. That's mighty sweet of you. That's probably one of the best things you could ever do to your man. Beach bacon and eggs. Right. Or that Maxwell House coffee. I mean, it's there anyway. Why waste it, you know? Wow. More women should think like you, Donna. Do we have a prize for Donna? We're going to hook you up with something. Are you? That's great. Are you kidding me? How many times a week do you do that to him? Almost every day. Oh, my God, really? The guy has no idea how lucky he's got it. All right, hold on the line. Okay. All right. Waking up with a Hummer. All right. All right, let's play some music and regroup here. I want to talk to her some more. Look. Here. I want to talk to her some more. Look, I'm giving her a prize. Okay. Really? We'll be back. A couple tunes. A little break. It's Metallica, 1027 WNEW. 1027 WNEW, Rage Against the Machine, Gorilla Radio. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey. If you have something for the show, we're going to try to move on with other things today. 2127571027. I'm next on the show. Chris. Chris, what's going on? What's going on, Opie? All right. What's up? Hello. You're up, man. Opie, did you beat Medal of Honor yet or no? Actually, Psycho Mark gave me Medal of Honor to try out. I don't know, man. I got to say. They're ranting a raving about Medal of Honor. I think it's like the best game ever. I got to admit, I only played like the beginning of the game. I wasn't really into it. What type of game is it? It's a first-person perspective Doom type of game. I'll tell you why I couldn't get into it. I watch Ant every day before the show, just going nuts in Half-Life Online Multiplayer. Then you get Medal of Honor on PlayStation. To me, it's a little primitive. I was also looking for codes because they have codes for infinite ammo. Sheet codes, sure. You get them on websites or even some magazines. Some of the electronics boutique has whole cheat books. Do you have a computer? No, I have a crap one. Find a friend that has a good computer, go to Yahoo, punch in Medal of Honor, and a crap load of stuff will pop up as far as cheat codes and stuff go. One more question. In all fairness, Psycho Mark loved Medal of Honor. I've played Half-Life and it showed me around the Half-Life game. I'm not the type of person that sits at that hard chair and plays with the mouse. I like it in my couch, you know, with a nice beer pop. Believe me, I do the same thing. Beer. One more question. When is the CD coming out, man? I've been waiting since October for this. Well, you know, we have new management here at WNEW. And they are, as we speak, trying to make it happen. Oh, word, man. They shoved the whole project back in the lawyers' faces and said, make this work. Make this work for the guys. That's what I'm talking about. All right, man. You guys suck. Is that a train, bro? All right. Thank you. I don't know if Cringe will ever make it out, but we'll see. I hope so. Money talks, though, in this company. I said, do you guys realize how much money our CD will make between our audience in New York and our audience in Boston? A double CD for our listeners? I hope it does now. Jesus Christ, that would suck if it didn't. It's a guarantee. We're really proud of the project. So we'll see what happens. That game Rick got me, that Unreal tournament? Oh, my God, that's good. That I put up there, too, with Half-Life as far as playing online. Half-Life was a great game for one player when you're just getting on and playing the whole game. A lot of the games coming out now like Unreal and Quake 3, Arena, they're made for online play, which is great. I mean, they're great multiplayer games. But I have not seen one thing come close to how good Half-Life was to just run through as a single-player game. Really? Fantastic. System Shock 2, pretty close, pretty good. The other one, Half-Life, the second one that just came out that I just finished, Opposing Force, pretty good, but not as good as the original. A lot of the same stuff going on. I'm doing Tomb Raider, Last Revelation right now. How's that working for you? It's a really good game because it starts out really easy and just gets harder as the game goes, kind of like that. So right now it's just getting really frustrating, but it's all right. I'm waiting for the new Team Fortress 2 to come out from Half-Life. And in the meantime, I'm actually playing the original Half-Life again on expert setting, Opie. Very difficult to get through. But I know it's common, so it kind of sucks. I wish they'd come out with another really good game like that. I mean, to this date, though, my two favorite PlayStation games, Siphon Filter. Yeah, that one was good. That was really good. And Silent Hill. Yeah, that was scary. Yeah, that was scary. Silent Hill is just... Man. I like crap like that. I like the creepy stuff, the stuff with the story behind it, the stuff you've got to kind of think and shoot. You've got to get a PlayStation and play Silent Hill. You would really enjoy it. And the puzzles are kind of a little tricky. You've got to think a little bit. And the creatures are great. The nurses with the hearts beating on their back on the outside of their skin. And the dogs that attack you that have, like... It looks like they've been torn inside out. And they run around. It's just great. I need graphics now, though. I really do. I mean, I need the top-of-the-line graphics. So PlayStation, I don't know, it might be a little disappointing. Every time I pick up a PlayStation game, they're just moving forward with the graphics and everything else, though. I mean, Last Revelation, Tomb Raider, the graphics are so much better on that game than it was for Tomb Raider III. And it's only like, what, a year and a half difference in the two games. Yeah. I mean, I'd get one of those just so I could like... You should hang out on the couch and stuff. It's great. Better than just sitting at the computer. On those Sony Tron glasses we got? Yeah. So now you can, like, lay on your couch with your head all the way back on a pillow and you can play the game on the ceiling. I've got to check that. Or it looks like it's on the ceiling with those Sony glasses they gave us. That's great. Jim, what's up? Yeah, listen, you already said you played Siphon Filter, but... Wait, were you feeling a little jealous there, Jim? He was listening to the show and he heard us. I said, you know, laying on my back, playing PlayStation with the glasses, it looks like it's on the ceiling. I'm dying. I'm sitting here dying. I got a 35-inch TV I played on, but I'd rather have the glasses. I picked up on some, though, because you didn't know we went to you, and I hear, oh, that's great, right? I wish I had that. Oh, I need that. I heard about it from you guys and I priced it, man. I'm looking at that and go, wow. Yeah. How'd it go there? Yeah, the price is up there, but the price is going to come down like crazy because it's going to be the new rage very soon. That's what I'm waiting for. It's a PC game. Yeah. Hidden and Dangerous. Hidden and Dangerous? Is that that World War II one? Yeah, the graphics on that are pretty good. Yeah, I was looking at that. That looked pretty good. I play it. I have it at home. It's decent. It really is. Is it a first-person shooter, you know? It can be, but it's both a first-person and a strategy shooter, and you can take your pick, and the sniper mode on that thing is awesome. God, I love the sniper mode in any game. Oh, give me the sniper rifle. Zoom in and just take off some heads. Absolutely. The sniper feature is hitting every game because even Tomb Raider has now a sniper feature. Sniper feature. There's nothing better than on the crossbow, man. Zooming in and just watching him like in Half-Life when he used the crossbow. Yep. You zoom in, you just, boom, and you see the guy just fly back. It's like, oh, I didn't even know I was there. This thing is cool. You can take over tanks. You can shoot tanks. I mean, you can shoot from the tank. You can shoot off machine guns. You take over weapons. You drive trucks. And the enemy is intelligent. It hears you, and it comes looking for you. That's a lot the way it is with Half-Life 2. Yeah, that's a good thing. Artificial intelligence. It's great. Yep. Like they chase you, the soldiers in Half-Life. If you come around the corner and one sees you and you run away, but it don't matter. They're chasing you. Oh, yeah. And they'll throw grenades at you, and they're accurate. Absolutely. Good stuff. It's fun. Man, can you imagine another five years? It's just going to be completely out of hand, the game. Yeah, much better. All right, Jim. Yeah, you take care. You guys are great. Thank you. Timothy. All I wanted when I was a kid, too, was like games and computer games. We're like in its infancy, but I wanted them. I wanted to play them. I loved them. I went to some stupid arcade where I would pump quarter after quarter into a machine to land a lunar module. Oh, remember that? And you had a little stick with thrust control buttons, and you had to land the thing. And you had to figure out to make sure you had enough gas, right, and all that? And make sure you didn't come in too fast or the thing would crash? This was the best thing in the world. Completely remember that. And it was ridiculous. Two-dimensional little lunar lander would come off of the command module. You had to turn it with the retros and slowly bring it down without running out of gas, like you said, and keep it so you wouldn't drift to the left or right. And I was like, oh, I need this for my house. This is a big clunky unit. So whenever new games come out or new technology comes out, I've got to have it. Got to check it out. What a slide of Voodoo 2 graphics caught on my computer. Three weeks later, Voodoo 3 is out. Oh, Voodoo 2 goes to my brother, Joe. See you later. Voodoo 3 goes in the machine. Yeah. You know how we laugh at the first computer games and stuff? Yeah. You think in like 10, 15 years people are going to just be laughing at what the games were in the year 2000? I'm sure they will be because it's going that fast. Like, look five years ago what the graphics looked like. And look at them now. It's just going to get that much better. There's a graphics card coming out that, of course, I'm going to have to have that has to plug in to the wall. Now, you know, you plug the card into the back of your computer. A plug comes in for the fan to cool the processor off because it's handling so much of the graphics that it overheats. So it's a fan that has to plug into your wall just for the graphics card. Wow. Oh, I need it. I need it now. That's got to be good. I want a water-cooled graphics card. I want something that looks like a big engine on my living room floor pumping glycol through my computer to keep it cool because of my graphics card. Yeah. Tim, you're next. Hey, what's up, guys? All right. I just want to say most of the games, Medal of Honor and Silent Hill, I've played them all. Medal of Honor I beat. I beat it with the Bronze Star. Did you like Medal of Honor? Yeah. As you guys were saying about the soldiers being smart, they're the same thing in that game. Like I throw a grenade at them, they pick it up and throw it right back at me. And they have bazookas and you lock up, you shoot the guy in the head. And then next thing you know, he pulls out a bazooka and it blows me away. Yeah, I mean the game's getting rave reviews, but the graphics are just a little primitive for me. I know. You start off here in the woods and all that. I mean, that's kind of hard. But then you get to like inside the buildings into a V2 rocket plan, all this cool stuff. Oh, cool. Maybe I should play the game a little further then. You can get to get onto a U-boat and all that and blow it up and submerge it. That sounds cool. It's cool. Well, I'm going to give it another try then. I played the Ultra Lunar Lander game. That's pretty cool too. Yeah, remember that? Yeah, years ago, man. Yeah, it's like the kind of moon wind kind of blow you back and forth. You got to like move it and go too fast. Even when I saw Pong, I was mesmerized. A stupid little ball going back and forth with the paddles. How the hell they figure out how you can play a game right on your TV. Only movie stars are on TV, Opie. Look, now I'm playing a game on the TV. I must be special. Let me get up and turn the channel and see what's on. I was always jealous watching Wondorama that they would give away one of those Pong games. A Pong game and a Ross Apollo bicycle. With a snake can game. And it was like, oh, if I could only get on Wondorama and Bob McAllister could give me a Pong game. Yeah, ain't happening. All right, Timothy, thank you. Well, one more thing about Silent Hill. I've made it to the end. I won't spoil it because I was trying to get some information out of me. But I don't want to spoil it for him. I got to the end of the game and you have to get this one thing in order to get to this place. You can't get the thing without like... I'll tell you off there, but it's so hard. There's like what? Four or five endings to that damn game. Yeah, there's different endings and I have to get this one thing in order to get to get it. I'll tell you this, it's electrified. In order to get to get the electricity off. You have to take an elevator to get it. And since you turned the electricity off, you can't take the elevator. So I'm like, screwed. I'm in like one place. I'm going to beat it. I'm trying to remember what I did because that goes back about a year and a half now. Yeah, same with me. I've been playing a while and I thought I was in the hospital and Fav is proving me wrong. Oh really? I can't remember. I don't remember that much. I can't remember. I can't remember what I ate for lunch, man. Yeah, acid flashback. There you go, thanks. Alright man, take it easy. You guys suck. Alright man. One more. Greg? Hey Greg, what's up? What's up guys? Love the show, been listening for a long time. Wanted to talk to Ant. Hey Ant, have you tried the tribes game online yet? Not online, no. Dude, you got to try that out. I've heard it's really good. It's unbelievable. You get on there, you get to choose from three different armor types like light, medium or heavy armor. You get all these different kinds of guns. You got to check out this, they got this disc launcher. Yeah, that sounds like Unreal Tournament. They have something that launches like saw blades at the other people. It's pretty cool. Well I think that the tribes game predates the Unreal game. Yeah, it does. A lot of the tribes tournaments, you're battling on these floating command posts and you have jet packs and you can jump from post to post and just ride ships and stuff like that. Oh, it's great. Yeah, I love those online games, man. I play Half-Life Online like all the time. And there's some people that really piss me off because they're really good. I consider myself pretty good at it. But some of these guys will just rip you a new ass. Now which one do you play, Team Fortress or Opposing Force Online? I play Half-Life, the regular one, Team Fortress and Opposing Force. I like that being a sniper on Team Fortress, take off some heads. It's fun, man. It's great. People are like, oh, it's promoting violence. No, it relaxes the hell out of you. When you're pissed off and you get on the computer and you whack a few people with a shotgun and a sniper rifle. Oh, that's great. There you go. Thank you, Greg. You guys, before you settle down and have kids, get all the gaming in while you can because I have a 20-month old and forget about it. It's all over, huh? It's all over. I would think you'd play more games because you get up in the middle of the night because they're crying and you throw your game on a little bit while they're going back to sleep. I get about two hours a night and that's between the game and my wife and the TV and cleaning the house. Oh, look, he's in hell. Can't wait. You've got your own video game you're playing. It's called Your Life and it's hell. It's scarier than any of the ones we play. And the goal is how to get out of hell. How do I get out? How does this game end? I need a cheat code. That's a good one, guys. I need unlimited ammo. All right, Greg. Take it easy, fellas. I need to be in God mode. Lancelot from Jersey, get off the video games and start talking about lesbians. Oh, please. Come on. What's going on with Vicki? Hey, Vicki. Yeah. What's up? What's the matter? You are really scaring me here. Why? What's the matter? You're talking about snipers like they're real people. Oh, it's great. Yeah, but they're not real. You know what it is? When you play online, the person you're shooting on the screen is sitting at his computer somewhere in the world. And that's who you're killing. Yeah. You're killing his little character. So you're not just playing against that. Now I know why your wife freaks out. My wife? Your wife. When you play these games. Oh, look at the time. We've got to take a break. Yeah, we'll get into that. No, you're really... Do you guys remember Asteroid? Yeah, Asteroids. Space Invaders. Do you remember the lines on the screen? Yeah. Oh, man. But you would scare me, Anthony. I used to get drunk at Cedar Pub and I played Asteroids for hours on end. Yeah, just remember that they're not real, okay? All right, Vicky. Can you do that? They are, Vicky. I'm the defender of the world. If I falter for a second, everyone perishes. So I'll remember if I'm online, if I get shot, it's you. Yes. Okay. Frag Monster. Frag Monster is Anthony's little thing. That's me. You shouldn't probably be talking so bad. I'm the Frag Monster, 10-10-10-8 on the side. Well, you know, you realize now that you've just doomed yourself. That's all right. I'll frag anybody. Try to take me out. Thank you. Thanks, guys. I will. Thanks, Vicky. Bye. All right. Let's take a break, Anthony. All righty. I dug this up from the Opie and Anthony archives, messing with some chick that thought she won a lot of money through one of those clearinghouses. Oh, yeah. You know, like Publishers Clearinghouse. Or one of those such things like that. Right. She thought she was calling that company, but she called us instead. Have a play of this in a while. Check it out. Hello? Yes, I'm calling. Is it? Yes, it is. What can we do for you today? Yes, I just got a call from... Yes? And he gave me my claim number. Uh-huh. Because I won a prize. Yes, you did. What claim number did you get? 654... 654... 321... 321... 6J. 6J? Yes. Ooh. Pretty excited, are you? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? You ever won anything before? Never won anything. Hold on, please. Oh, okay. Dude, tell her she won a European vacation. Hello? Hello? That is coming up as a European vacation. A European vacation? Yeah. He had told me something like $10,000. I wish I were you, as a matter of fact, because it's a European vacation for your family, plus $10,000 in spending money. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you psyched? Yeah. I'm like shaking. This is... Oh my God. Wow. Oh my God. Wow. Hold on. We have our supervisor here. Okay. He's going to need, I guess, some information, maybe. Hold on. Hi, ma'am. Yes? Hi, this is John Huber, Bill's supervisor. Can I have that number once again, please? We've got to verify that you are, in fact, the winner. Yes. It's 654... 321... Uh-huh. 6J. 6J? Yes. I thought she said A, John. You thought she... I thought it was an A. Yes. Oh. It's 6J? It's 6J as in jump. Oh. We've got some good news and bad news. You're still the winner. Okay. But your prize is a set of steak knives. A set of steak knives? Yes. The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A. Oh. And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the steak knives. Oh, all right. And that's $19.95. Okay. Would you like to... No, thank you. Oh. Okay. That's okay. That's fine. Okay. Well, thank you anyway. Okay. Oh, that was way too painful, man. Oh, poor girl. I'm all for violence sometimes. Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies. God, I want to punch you in the face. Better leave a bruise. 1027 WNEW. Oh, I'm sorry. I want to sound like the ABC voice guy there. Yeah. Tonight. Tonight on a brand new NYPD Blue. 1027 WNEW. Dennis Franz's ass in your face. Ah! So, Peter Anthony, audience and feedback. Mark from Highland Lakes, New Jersey. You want addiction? We were just talking about gaming. Yeah. Mark writes, play EverQuest. I got laid off because I was absent from work. I don't give an S about boffing my wife. I spent all my time playing this game. It's scary. I'm on level 47 of 50. Trust me, you'll give up sex for this game. Jesus. Some of these games are all good. The guy's got it bad. But some of these games, it's like doing like, you know, crack. Doing the crack. It's like doing a line or two back in the 80s. You can't do just one. Danny from the Bronx. You know what I mean though, with these games, you're like, oh, I'm just going to put in five minutes before the news. Oh, it's not five minutes. I'm going to put in five minutes before Letterman. Then I'm going to go to bed after Letterman. I never put time constraint. I always put level constraint. I'm like, oh, right after I get around this corner and take out the guy, I'll hang it up. You know what sucks about these games? You're in a really involved level, okay? Yeah. And it takes you a real long time to really figure it out. You finally figure it out. And you were saying in your head the whole time, as soon as I figure out this level, I'm going to bed. Yeah. It's almost a mini goal in this game. I'm going to bed. Right. But then all of a sudden, like let's say the exit door opens for that level. You pop into a whole brand new world. It's like, oh, I got to explore before I go to bed. You can't go to bed now. Just take a quick look around the room. Take a quick look. And then you're in it. Next thing you know, it's 4.35 in the morning. Exactly. They're terrible. How did they do this? How did they do this to us? It's an addiction. It really is. And then there's this Danny from the Bronx talking about Medal of Honor again. He says, the best is when you go undercover and the guards give you the Nazi salute. It's a World War II game. And you pull out your gun and blow their head right off. The look on their face when they realize who you are and try to run is priceless. That brings up something too. Because we've been playing games for years. And it used to be the little pixelated, two-dimensional animated character. If you had to shoot anything, that was it. No blood, no nothing. It was kind of a, ding! And he's out, you know? When Miss Pac-Man died, who cared? Yeah, who cared? Waka-waka. Right. But now, I mean, the faces have expressions. You shoot them and the arms fly back. The body slumps in the corner. Blood flows out. In Half-Life, you set a landmine and he trips it and it blows up. You see meat and bone chunks flying past you. A face flies past you. It goes on the floor in just a smear. And if you had a little relationship with that person in the game, you kind of feel bad. Now that he's gone. You kind of do. Yeah. You kind of do. Like you could recruit a couple of people in Half-Life. So you recruit one of the cops, one of the security guards in the plant that you're in. And he goes, okay, you know, maybe we'll make it if we stick together. Make it a little longer. He comes with you. All of a sudden, a big monster comes out and just hacks into pieces. You're like, huh, I was kind of getting attached to the little guy. He was helping me out. He was helping me. He was my pal. Steve, what do you got? Hey, Anthony, you've got to get this piece of software. It's called BLEEM, and it'll let you play all of Opie's games on your PC in higher resolution than on the PlayStation. Yeah, I heard about that. It works really good. And if you have like a good accelerator card or a good 3D graphics, the games look way better than they do on the PlayStation. Yeah, this guy's dissing me on the instant feedback, Opie. Saying, oh, I have my 16-meg Voodoo 2 card, Voodoo 3 card. No, pal, I got the 32-meg Diamond Viper. All right, pal-y, you want to start talking hardware? Tech Talk. I'll kick your ass. Tech Talk. Thank you, Steve. All right. Hi. Hey, Bob. Yeah, what's up? Hey, you're the manager of Anthony's old Hangout? I used to be the manager of Time Out in Sunrise Mall, and I used to remember on Saturday, when he mentioned Lunar Lander, I swear I jumped back 20 years. I said, oh my God, that's the little kid. Well, no, it's the little kid. That's the kid in the denim jacket who used to wait for me to open the store. You and your buddy. You used to play Lunar Lander for hours. No, actually, that wasn't me. Yes, it was. Well, I never went there. You never went to Time Out in Sunrise Mall? No. Oh, man. I used to play it at the... I don't even remember where. And everyone knows Ant wasn't wearing denim jackets. He was wearing fur coats back then. Big, fluffy fur coat. Big difference. Oh, man. I'm sure there was other people addicted to that stupid game, too. I don't know. That one in Lunar Lander and the other space game where you had to blow everything out of the sky. Remember Defender? Defender. Defender was cool. Remember Defender? Arcanoid? Remember Joust? Arcanoid. I remember Arcanoid. Running around in an ostrich looking thing. With Joust was the first 50 cent game. Yeah. Joust. Joust was the first 50 cent game. Absolutely. Okay. You guys suck. Thank you. Take care, man. And is that a train? No, you did well. Goodbye. Bye. A lot of people, you know, a little paranoid of the train. We didn't have to break out the train too many times. And now people jumping off the track these days. That's good. You don't want to be the one that's known to be hit by the train. No. Tom, you're next. Hey. Hey. When you mentioned Wondarama before... Yeah. ...you brought back a very traumatic instance. I was on it when Bob McAllister was still hosting it. Yeah. That one was four hours long. Oh, you could wake up on Sunday morning at like seven o'clock in the morning and watch Wondarama until Soul Train came on at like midnight. Exactly. At noon. You don't know what they put kids... This was like scared straight for kids. Two things I remember particularly. Remember the go-go session when the kids were dancing and stuff? Yeah, they said it was down in the basement. No. But it was the same studio. They just turned the audience the other way? Exactly. It was on a big sound stage and they moved the bleachers where you sat and they set up the things. But what they told you was, they told you, if you don't dance, we're going to make you wait outside for your parents. And it was probably midway through. Oh my God. Eight years old. That's threatening the children on Metro Media Television. A pre-50s stage manager was like Hitler. Okay. You were there from probably eight o'clock in the morning to probably ten o'clock at night. For a six-year-old kid, that's two days. The other thing I remember is that when... You know how they always advertise... Didn't they give you ice cream and Kraus hot dogs? Yeah. What they gave you was they gave you... Halfway through for lunch, they gave you the Jumer ice cream sticks, but only like the half of one. And they gave you an RC Cola. And the stage manager... RC Cola, yeah. The stage manager goes, Any one of you kids that's skilled at it, we're going to make you lick it up. And didn't Bob McAllister go and chain smoke in between shooting? When he used to do the professor, when he used to change it to the professor, I swear to God, it was an hour between changing. And he just put his stupid lab coat on and some glasses. Exactly. It took an hour. They told you after he came back, after an hour, and you're just sitting there like, what the heck is going on? Oh, my God, it was torture for good. You have to start cheering like he just left. These people scared you. You never wanted to watch his show again. Oh, my God, it's forget about it. Does anybody here got an aardvark? Oh, my God. I'm sure they must have sexually molested some kids. Oh, my God. I just can't remember. It probably was me and I blocked it out. That show was on Metro Media, WNEW Television. Yeah, Channel 5. Yeah, Channel 5 before they went to Fox. I swear to God, bringing that memory back. Yeah, Wondorama. Boy, I would love to see some old clips from that damn show. Oh, God, I'd love to not. Bob McAllister, what a nut. He's dead now, you know. Is he? Yeah, we did a haunting tribute to him about a year ago, I guess, when he died. I'm surprised it wasn't some kid that was on the show that probably killed him. Wow. He used to smoke like crazy. Yeah, that's probably why it took him so long to put his lab coat on. He died of lung cancer or something, yeah. All right, Tom. All right, guys. Thank you. Anybody here got an aardvark? Anybody here got an aardvark? Let's go down to the basement to the disco, kids. They get the poor kids dancing. They're all doing the peepee dance. They all look like they've got to take a leak. Little seven-year-old to nine-year-old kids dancing like they just got to take a whiz from all the RC Cola. They're all popped up on that. Hopped up on the junk. Hopped up on the junk. Jason, you're next on WNAW. What's up? Hey. Hey. Anthony. Yeah? A couple months ago you said that Mob Rule was a good computer game. Yeah. That thing sucks. What, you don't like it? It's horrible. It all depends on what kind of games you like, man. Yeah, I got it. It's like a $50 game and it sucks. There's some good... Well, that's like one of those strategy games and stuff. I don't usually play those. I play first-person shooters. Yeah. But for a strategy game, I thought it was pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not into that stuff. And by the way, EverQuest... Yeah? One of my friends, he was addicted to that game. Really? Oh my God, it's horrible. A lot of people are writing on the instant feedback about EverQuest. Yeah. What kind of game is that? I don't really know. It's a role-playing game. Monica from New Jersey. On the topic of EverQuest, serious guys, people have gone with the idea of a game. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty bad. And then James writes from Queens. If that guy is too busy playing EverQuest instead of doing his wife, I'll do his wife. It's always somebody there to do that. That's right. And just goes on and on, and on and on. And then James writes from Queens. He doesn't know what it says. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not a fan of that. I'm not a fan of that. I'm not a fan of that. I don't know. It's just a little... But I'm not a fan of it. I have a few friends on my team that I've been on for a while. I'm not a fan of that. I'm not a fan of that. EverQuest, instead of doing his wife, I'll do his wife. It's always somebody there to do that. That's right. It just goes on and on. EverQuest equals EverCrack. There you go. Video games are stupid. What's next? Skateboarding? You're going to start talking about how cool it is to skateboard? Grow up just a little. I wish I was. Skateboarding is cool. Let me tell you something. First of all, I tried skateboarding. I just never got the hang of that one, unfortunately. Most of the games being bought for computers aren't being bought by kids. You know what I mean? It's like adults buying these games. Well, Jason, thanks. All right? Peace. See you guys later. All right. Dominic. We can't win no matter what we talk about. Say no. Hey, Jack. Yeah, guys. What's up? How are you? Good. I've been homesick listening to you all week. That sucks. You've got that damn flu. Yeah, it's bad. But listen to this. I've got you guys on and I have the TV going, the TV Guide channel. You know, it used to be the preview channel. Yeah, now it's TV Guide. And they have all these features and things on there. They had a thing on there. They said Roseanne is going to have a singing career. Like, she didn't learn her lesson with, you know, the Star Spangled Banner a few years back. And the talk show. And she says this is the best part. She said kids think that she's cool. Oh, really? Yeah. Anyone can have a singing career. Apparently. Who the hell was talking about doing a record soon? Well, whatever. They all try it. It doesn't work. Who's going to run out and buy these? Hey, you know who has a CD? Orrin Hatch. What? He does. He has a CD. Is it a comedy CD? I hope not. Yeah. But it's songs inspired by Orrin Hatch or something like that. Oh, brother. There you go. All right. Well, take care of that flu, all right? Thanks a lot. All right, Jack. Bye. By the way, they asked Bob McAllister when he was the professor. I hope he was Professor Finkelheimer. Finkelheimer. I do remember that. Professor Fingerheimen. Finkelheimer. All right. Oh, brother. I think we got to take a break, Anthony. Yeesh. And I believe we're ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today. Oh, don't forget all the things we talked about today.
