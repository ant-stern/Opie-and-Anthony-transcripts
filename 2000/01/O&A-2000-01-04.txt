 Opie Anthony, we recorded a number of their messages on tape, but one of the messages appears to be a fan of attack. Bizarre at 1027. It is Opie Anthony, hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us. We're cracking each other up as the music's playing. Oh my god, unfortunately we can't say the stuff on the air. You ever just say the most politically incorrect thing in the world just to shock your friend? Oh my god, you can't say that. It's like someone turns to you and goes, you can't say that. It's like, you just can't. But, deja vu? It's exactly what I said yesterday when I was trying to explain myself about the, you know, Bill's dead phone call. There are times you're hanging out with your pals and you'll, like you just said, you'll say something to really shock them. Yeah, but that's saying something amongst your friends, not dragging in a more innocent bystander. If you say, let's say we were all sitting here in the studio and we made some kind of ethnically disparaging remark, which you just did, I'm not saying we did that, let's just say we did. Let's just say we did. Oh my god, that was funny. See, the difference is we're all shocked and then laugh at how outrageous it is. That's different than inviting a person of that ethnic background in the studio and then saying it. See, that's the same thing as you with your phone call. Look at the Reverend Al sticking his head in the door. We weren't talking about your people. Oh no. We weren't talking about your people. It was someone else. What remark was made? I demand an investigation. I demand an inquiry into what goes on behind the scenes of the Orby and Anthony show. It's bad enough to listen to the outrageous remarks of you two on there. Now you say you're making ethnically disparaging remarks off there. But it wasn't about your people, so that's okay, right? I am outraged. I'm sure it was about my people. No, no, it wasn't. I am positive. No, it wasn't. This is just like the Louima case. What goes on behind closed doors? I feel violated and I want vindication. I am outraged. You can tell how outraged I am by going to my website, ReverendAl.com, where you can tell all the happenings of Reverend Al. Be sure you click on my banners, I get a penny a pop. I need money to wear these almighty suits when I don't have a job. And for your entertainment, I also have a couple of fun little computer games you can play on the Reverend Al website. Yeah? Yeah. Here's another one called March Through New York City. Watch it, here goes Reverend Al marching. Uh-oh, here come the police. Oh, the Reverend Al didn't make it to the final destination, the Palo Theater. But it'll be fun. All right, Reverend Al, we weren't talking about your people, all right? I am outraged. All right, get out of here. Who were you making disparaging remarks about? Um, the Asians. Oh, that's okay, I got a good one. Yeah. Reverend Al, ladies and gentlemen. There he goes, Reverend Al. Big fat ass ass. Telling us Asian jokes. While we're on this racial topic, Tamar, on the Instant Feedback, Tamar from Brooklyn. She's been, I assume it's a female, she's been emailing me the last couple days, and she writes in the Instant Feedback, again, question for the OP, for the sexy OP. Jesus. What's up with you saying you want a black girl before you get married? Wouldn't you marry one if she made you happy? I don't get it. Help me understand you. Love you guys. Oh, that's an interesting point. But I want to understand what you mean. Well, it's a- What's an interesting point? It's one of my fantasies, fetishes, if you will, to be with a black lady before I get married. Really? And I say it that way because most likely I'm going to marry a Puerto Rican. So I'm not putting down the black race. You want to enjoy the pleasures of a black woman before I marry- Before you marry a Puerto Rican. And she was saying, how come you've written off marrying a black woman? Because most likely I'm going to be marrying a Puerto Rican. Okay. Hold dirty? No. The sad part is this is the truth. So sad about that. You don't look like an ethnically diverse person. You don't really look like the type of- you look like you should be marrying the- Man, I'll tell you one thing. At least going out with the girl that's the high school homecoming queen in Harborfield, you know? Well, instead, if I marry Sandy and we have kids, they're going to pop out like Carrot Top. With her wild nappy hair and my red features. I don't know if Sandy would appreciate you saying she has nappy hair. With those banana curls of hers, our kids are going to look like they're plantain curls. They're going to look like Carrot Top. Sandy has lovely hair. Yes, she does. I don't know what you're saying. Oh my God. Well, it's a little nappy at times. You guys are like West Side Story. Tonight, tonight. Forget that boy and find another. One of your own kind, stick to your own kind. But answer your question tomorrow. Boy like that who killed your brother. Forget that boy and find another. One of your own kind, stick to your own kind. But answer your question tomorrow. Forget that boy and find another. But I hope that answered her question. If I still say, the way to not. You are. What if I still say, you're little Maria. Maria, Sandy, I just met a girl. And then like her family and friends could get the gang together and you could get yours and they could rumble. Yeah, that'd be fun. You guys can translate. Kiss me off. What up, Anthony? Eddie. This is 1027WATW. No more of that FM talk crap. We called you yesterday. You didn't believe us, did you? You didn't believe us, did you? No, but it's true. I made a decision yesterday. Not that anything's, I don't know, what's changing as far as the show, Opie? Nothing. Don't worry. Once again, they keep slapping a new name on the package, but don't you, Fred. Your pals are still here doing the same thing. And we don't even know what that is, but we're doing the same exact thing. But I told you, man, we're doing these high profile meetings now. High profile? Well, Anthony... What are you doing? Oh my God. Anthony's not, but I am. Anthony's got a slate. I bet he gets here before 1.30. 1.30, first of all, ass. Here we go. I'm usually here by quarter to one. Yeah, call me weird. I'm so sensitive. You're sensitive. Am I sensitive? When are we allowed to play the audio of you doing the New Year's show? You can play that anytime you want. It's so boring, dude. It's boring? See? See? There's like nothing to it. It wasn't any, you're not going to... Dude, not over the board. Watch your finger, man. And watch your thumb. Oh, Opie with tools scares the crap out of me. Shut up. I can do that. Oh, you're so sensitive. Opie is hacksawing the FM talk at 1027 mic flag off the mic. And of course, don't let the shutting the mic off or doing it at any spots. So everyone can just hear... You proved you could do the show without me. Just keep talking. Oh yeah. And wait a minute, Rick. What do you mean boring? The whole thing was boring? You didn't like my rap? No, no, no. It was arduous to get through the tape because Earl recorded everything. They're talking all the music. So it's not segmented. So I don't know where the hell to stop the damn tape. Okay. Is there any wires in the middle of this thing? Oh yeah, there are electric wires. Don't cut the... Is there an easier way to get this mic flag off? Yeah, you undo the screw at the bottom. Oh. See the little wing nut? All right, I'll do that. Now the whole mic is going to fall, so you have to hold that. I know. Remember the time I was working the mic and it fell off in my hand? No problem. That came loose. That came loose. Okay. Oh, there you go. Yeah, just let it hang by the wire. There it goes in the trash. Would you throw the hacksaw away, Tony? Yeah, I don't need it. There you go. Now at least we can see it. Wow, Ed, that's what you look like. How are you, man? How did they put that big thing on and we couldn't even see each other? I haven't seen you in like three months. It's like the scene from Caddyshack. Ed and I... Ed and I tried to do this... God damn it. Sit down, Dennis. Hold on, someone hold that. I'm serious. Dude, what happened to this thing? Girl. Oh, there it is. What, the... There it is. Can't get it in the hole? I can get it in the hole, jackass. There he goes. You want to start talking about your gay roommate right off the bat, Mark? Fine, let's go ahead. I don't care. And other things? All right. There we go. Wow, honestly, I can see you now, Ed. Yeah, this is kind of cool. There was a big block there for so long. And before you guys call us a bunch of homos, no, you need to see the other guy when you do a radio show so you don't step all over him. Exactly. Can't be just talking with a big block in front of your face. Imagine that, go to a bar with your pals, right? Put a big block in front of everybody's face and then try to carry on a conversation. That's what we do here. And just like Caddyshack, you know, we're kind of looking around the block, but the other guy's looking the other way. Danny. Sit down, Danny. And then he just kind of wipes them off the desk. Right. Now we're okay now. Now we're all right. The block is out of our face. I see the little things up all over the place. 1027 WNEW. Website, WNEW.com. Oh, really? Yeah. See, that's a lot easier. There's still nothing on it, but at least we can give out the address and people will understand it. FM Talk. Is there anything good on it? www.wnew.com. Is there anything good on it? No, I'm serious because the website blew. So what do you mean there's good stuff on there? It's the same website. Neneh. It's not as good as our underground website. That's for sure. Everyone commenting, by the way, about all the new stuff on the unofficial website. Yeah. The pictures of you in a fur coat is a big hit. I think it's a hit. With our faithful listeners. Steve that runs the site sent me an email saying, oh my God, you poor sorry bastard. What an upbringing. And he's amazed I even gave him the disk with those pictures on it. Yeah. So he may share it with millions of people. It is pretty scary. Well, if you want to share, I'll bring in some pictures of myself that are pretty horrifying as well. So well, we had spoken about me wearing the fur coat when I was a little kid. My mom bought it for me much to my chagrin. I really didn't want to wear it, but I'm a kid. You know, you've got to wear what your parents make you wear. And we talked about it on the air and my cousin Anthony came up with a picture of it. And who am I to censor that from our listeners? If a picture exists of something we talked about, why not? The funniest part of the picture, you can't tell who is Anthony. Yeah. And your sister's involved in this. It's you, your brother and Dawn. You can't tell which one's Anthony in that photo. When I was a kid, especially with the fur coat, I would go out to restaurants and stuff. And the waitress or waiter would come over and, and what would the young lady like to you? Yeah. Oh, great. Thanks a lot. I used to get that. I'm a boy. I'm a man. You bitch. I didn't cross dress in a wreck. I used to get that. Until like six months ago. I finally had it. I had to cut my hair. Really? From behind. I was always getting ma'am and I turn around and getting all pissed off, have a goatee and stuff. Do I look like a ma'am? Well, you shaved your goatee off that you had over vacation. Yes. You're one of those guys that vacation, you let it grow a little bit and then you come back to work and shave it right off. Well, I didn't want to look like you, Anthony. Well, that's pretty impossible. You're the goatee man. Yeah. So when I grow the goatee, then everyone goes, what, you trying to copy Anthony? So what did you do? I just, I didn't shave over vacation? Yeah, it started really hurting. Actually, I shaved it because I was looking too much like Spaz. You had the exact same goatee. I'm like, wait, something's not right here. Okay. I look just like my hero. After all, he likes me better than you. Well, we all know that. That's fine by me. Max, what's going on? How are you doing? What's going on, Anthony? Hey. All right. Listen, I got some advice for you. I just heard a little while ago that you said you wanted to bed down with a black woman before you tied the knot. Yeah, without a doubt. All right. I got some advice for you. Understand this, that once you go black, you don't go back. You never go back. All right. What's up with that? Now, what's up with that? I mean, depending on the girl and how strong she is, because once she finds out that you're a celebrity and you are, whether you have a major following or a cult following, you are a celebrity. You belong to the world. She won't try to run. She won't try to put the serious moves on you. Uh-oh. The serious moves, oh. That's right. And I'm telling you right now, that's something to, uh, that's something to behold. Take it from me. I am a black man. All right. I'm just going to, like, get a black hooker, I think. He's just going to bang. Oh, man, it don't matter whether it's a hooker or not, man. It don't matter what hooker. I'm going to grow my goatee. No one's going to know it's me. And I'm going to get a black hooker. It don't matter, though, man. I'm telling you right now, once she finds out that you're a celebrity, she's going to try to put the moves on you. I'm going to get some of that purple fruit. Oh. The purple winged bat. Oh, you're funny. You're funny. So do you have any advice as far as picking up a black chick? No. He's telling you to lay low on it. He doesn't want you to do it. I'm just going to put it to you like this. If you heard the saying, keep it real. Right. Just keep it real. Don't try to do nothing serious and extravagant. Only unless this chick is also a raw, raw mess, is she rowdy or something like that, then you turn around and you can go over one of the other. Oh, boy. Now, great, boy. Just be yourself. Hope's got to come off like a scrub. No, he ain't got to come off like no scrub. Just be yourself. Just be real. If you ain't real, man, then you ain't going nowhere. I just don't want the relationship. I just want the bang. No, no, no. You ain't. No, that's the key. That's the key right there. You ain't looking for no relationship. You ain't looking for no relationship. You're just snagging that black ass while you're riding it, Hope. Imagine that. And you're a pretty, a white guy. Yeah, that's pretty fair. I mean, you're pretty fair skinned. So imagine what the contrast would be like. I'm not a pretty boy ass. I said pretty in the terms of like mostly pretty white boy. Oh, because I'm saying if you're a pretty boy, then you ain't going to have no problem picking up no black girl. I'm going to say that right now. Let me tell you something. In the past, I went to black bars trying to get the deed done. Now, you got to go to the laundromat, Hope. No, no. Why? No, no, no, no, no. You see, y'all need to hook up with me, man. I'll take you to some places. I ain't talking about no squeeze buckets either. Well, it'll be in the back alley like Rolls with your wallet missing. Well, the deal is no one can find out about this. See, I'm in a relationship, so I got to do it on the side. All right, no doubt. We can do this on a hush hush. Yeah, all right. A hush hush. You're saying you? I mean, look, you name the designated place and the designated time, and we can designate some ass. All right? Put this smear on me, all right? I'd like to scare the crap out of you, Hope. I think it would scare the living daylights out of you. That would be part of the beauty of it, Anthony. Yeah? Hell yeah. I think it would end up like, remember when the little pregnant chick came in and danced for you? You thought you wanted it right up until that happened? I think that's exactly what would happen. You'd get in bed, she'd be like, come on, sugar. Come on, give me some, baby. Come on, Hope. And you'd be like, I'm not into this anymore. I got to go. I can't stay. So what is it? You accepted my invitation? Well, honestly, that was an old bet that we played. Oh, see, you're backing out already? That was a while ago. I got to reassess the situation and decide if I still want that. How could you measure up? Right. You know? She probably used the black guys. I listen to y'all every day, so when you regroup yourself and you're ready to go, right, I will definitely be giving you a call. All right, Max, thank you. Easy. All right. Easy. Easy. Is that the new one in the community? I guess. Roger, you're next. 27W, N-E-W. Great, Spaz. Roger. Yeah. It's Hope and Anthony. You're live. Let's go. Hey, man, what's happening, guys? You thought it was Spaz even without the go to you. Yeah, man, exactly. So what's up? If he's wrestling career, if anything like his phone voice, he's going to suck. Listen, man, you got to watch out for them black women. They're fine. They'll take you for everything you got. How's that? How's that? Are you married? Are you married to black chick? Black chick more. Hello? Excuse me. Oh, she took his phone. She's taking it right now. Exactly. She got me. All right. So what happened? You married the black chick? Married the black chick. We went to St. Patty's Day parade and fell in love with her and she took me for everything I got. Still married to her, two great kids and guess what? Little Z-Post. The house is in her name too. Oh, that's stupid. Yeah, that's stupid. Two words, pre-nup. Pre-nup. All right, Roger. Talking about a what? Roger, one. All right, Roger. I'm hanging up on Roger. I'll tell you why. Because he's listening to the damn radio as he tries to talk to us. You know, we're making changes around here, left and right, changing things. For the new millennium. But the deal is we still have a 40-second delay as we speak. So if you have the radio on and you're trying to get on the show and you're trying to talk to us, we're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. We're going to have to wait for you to get on the show. Look at that. ONA Radio, 24 hours a day. See the radio message board, Opie, jumping with the news that it is true. It is N.E.W., W.N.E.W., not F.M. Talk. They said they heard it on our show yesterday, but didn't believe it until they heard the radio chick talking about it. Well, she's more credible. We have no credibility. That's okay. We don't want credibility. Yet we get fired for fake news stories. How did that happen? I don't know. Jesus Christ. Life's not fair, Ethel. It isn't. It is not. Well, it's kind of nice to see that you guys finally believe that we're doing live radio shows again. Yeah, they're calling. You guys are calling. Yesterday, we had to say what? Ten or twelve times that we're live, and the phones weren't ringing at all. People thought it was a tape. And then when the phones did ring, it was people requesting worst of bits. Yeah. So it's good to know that you guys are here. You're calling in, and you finally believe we're back from vacation. Even though we kept saying the date. I know. We even said the date. It's January 4th today. So Parcells stepped down. Yeah. A little bit of controversy there. Well, we'll get into that a little later. Yeah, well, we'll get into it for hours. How am I going to add on to the band? They've got to just be going insane over there. Well, they're happy. They needed something. To them, like Parcells stepping down and actually getting on the air with them and stuff, is like 20 chicks coming in here and shooting eggs out of their most intimate areas. That is like a coup for them. You know those shows where we're high fiving, there's nudity, and just debauchery? Yeah, and everyone's playing. It's kind of their homeless shopping spree. Right. You know? Look at that, Maggie! We got Parcells! Look at this! It's just better than eggs shooting out of the egg! They've been discussing Parcells resigning for the last 24 hours. Yes. And they'll keep going. They love it over there. And Bobby Bo. Excuse me. As we do a quick sports break here, my dream came true. Gonzo. Bobby Bonilla. Out of here! They hated him so much. You see the deal he got in the paper? They're going to be paying him until the year like 2030. I'm not kidding! Get the paper! Get the paper! They just wanted him out. They wanted him out just like pretty much every Met fan in the tri-state area. They made a deal where they pretty much are going to be paying him until like 2030, Anthony. Wow, sounds like our last P.D. With that, let's take a quick break and we'll get into the Bonilla thing and everything else. It's Opie and Anthony. If you want in on the show today, 212-757-1027. Opie. What is it going to take for us to fish you off to the point where you're going to change the station? That's what I need to know. Shove it. Anthony. Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on the show, isn't it? That's going to be trouble. Opie. Anthony. Opie. Anthony. Anthony. It sure is easy to be a fag on the show, isn't it? That's going to be trouble. Opie and Anthony. We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity. 1-0-2-7. 1-0-2-7-W-A-W. It's Opie and Anthony. We are back. We are live. It's January 4th, 2000. Yes, it is. Top of the millennium to you and yours. We're here, live. A lot of people were confused yesterday, as Opie said, but now we're here live. It's been a long time, right? It's been five days. Four days, five days. Why, did you get some on New Year's Eve? Let me figure it out. Did you bang in the New Year? No, I didn't bang in the New Year. Let's see. A couple days before. What day is today? The 4th. The 4th. 2 plus 4 is the 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th.

Nah, I hate everyone. You hate everyone? Go ahead pick a race. Pick a race, not breathe. Ass. Thought it was John Rocker there for a minute. Breathe? What are you talking about, the Puerto Ricans? Oh, Murray Gunn. Are you saying the Puerto Ricans have a lot of children? I'm thinking so. Alright, so Steve the pissed-off Asian just took a shot at the Puerto Ricans. all you Puerto Ricans out there, you know, f-like ravage. Oh come on, you were just going around in those G.O.s all stuffed up. Now you're making fun of their cars? Isn't it great living in a melting pot such as this where we can all hate different people? You're not making fun of their Toyotas, are you? No. With the small little steering wheels? Yeah, the Tercells or something. Yeah, the Toyota Corolla and the Celica GTs with the little skateboard wheels on them. Oh and the blue neon light. Do you need the blue neon light reflecting off the bottom of the car? What the hell have they got there? I want to illuminate my drive shaft, man, with blue neon light. And you need the license plate with the chaser red lights going around it. I guess it confuses the hell out of the cops when they're chasing them. I can't get the plate number, there's some red lights spinning around it. It's making me dizzy. It's making me nauseous. Just let them go. And then of course it's got to be tinted with, I don't know, flat black paint from Pergamon, the window tint. Sure. And then the trailer on the rear hood, on the rear trunk lid, because you never know when you're going to get one of those Toyota Corollas with their four cylinder engines up to about 260, could leave the roadway at any moment. And thank God we're in the off season. All the Puerto Ricans can now see out their back window because Sammy Soas is not hitting any homers. And then how about the little crown air freshener on the dashboard? Sure. The little crown. I think you need your Jesus Christ headlight stencils. That is the best thing I've ever seen. You ever see the Jesus Christ headlight stencil? It's over the headlight and it's Jesus' face. Like, wow, that is pretty cool. I need that. Jesus' headlight stencil. Well, Steve, thank you very much. Hey, I got a joke for you guys. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, how do you stop crime? How? Have a million man march every day. I think he was just goofing on the blacks. I know. You're his new Asian friend, Steve. You already took the... Oh, no, but I've known blackout before. You already took a shot at the Puerto Ricans and on the line we have a bunch of pissed off Puerto Ricans thanks to you, Steve. No problem. All right, man. Hey, Steve. Hey, you guys rock. Steve. Yeah. Do you have a last name like Chang or Wang? It's just, you know, throw a walk down the stairs. Walk? Yeah, because I always think it's funny when you throw a walk down the stairs and whatever sound it makes, Chang, pang, pang, pang. That's really funny. What's your name be? PANG, PANG, PANG, PANG, PANG, PANG. Hey, do we have anything we could throw to make it sound like a Chinese name? Get us a pot. Get us a pot or like a calendar or something. We're going to give you a new name. We're going to give you a new name so when you call... I always think it's pretty funny when an Asian guy with the last name that's like Chong, pang, pang, has a first name like Steve. Or you know, it's, my name is Bob. Bob Chang, pang. Yeah, you know, of course it's a pseudonym. And why do you guys talk like a model airplane? That's the women. I don't get it. At least I'm not spitting out 10,000 words a second like the Puerto Ricans. Oh, he doesn't like Puerto Ricans. All right, see, at first you guys, you know, you didn't want to admit that you didn't like anyone and now you're really pissed off at the Puerto Ricans. Okay. All right, here, give that to him. Let's see if this works. It's not actually a part though. No, it's made of metal. We'll give it a try. All right, we got a big, huge metal stool. Okay, here we go. That was like a chong, pang. Chang, pang. All right, Steve, chong, pang. All right, Steve, we got to let you go. All right. All right, man. You guys rock. Well, we'll continue this, Anthony, because now we got a bunch of pissed off Puerto Ricans. Oh, my God. And we'll talk to them next. Stay there. The Opie and Anthony Show. I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show. More stupidity on the way. 1027. 1027WAW. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. I told you guys yesterday, no longer FM Talk. But once again, the Opie and Anthony Show is exactly the same. We're the one constant in the universe, like the cockroach. No matter how our surroundings or environment change, we remain. We adapt. We adapt. We will be here for millions of years. Either that or until we get a Bobby Bonilla deal, you know, buyout. Yeah. I don't think they'd do that for us. So the upper management of CBS, if you guys want to give us a Bobby Bonilla buyout, Aunt and I will walk today. What are we going to do for 11 years, though, before it kicks in? Yeah, that could be a little rough. It's got to suck, especially like if you don't get another gig. So you're just hanging out and you're like, hey, look, I'm going to be rich in like 10 years. Believe me. I swear. And get back to the dishes. You know, I would still go for that deal, though. Really? Oh, without a doubt. I don't know, man. I would go back to Caddy. I would honestly. You look a little silly now, Caddy. I gotta say. Why? Well, I can see, you know, working your way through college or something or for high school, whatever you're doing, caddying. But now it's like, hey, you could probably really use the punter, you know. Hey, man, I was good. I don't doubt you were. You were a good caddy. But would you feel comfortable with a bunch of kids caddying and you standing there? Honestly, I could care less. To this day, when I was a caddy, it was my best job. It was your only job. Yeah, that's true. I've never had a real job. I'm talking about radio. I'm trying to think. You were a caddy and a DJ. Let me think. Have I ever had a real job? I was a caddy. I don't think so. I worked in a video store where we watched porn all day. You worked in a video store, too, huh? Yep. What did you do? Did you like the counter? You rang it up? I told you that story. I got fired because his sales went way down. And I'll tell you why. I was on like the five-year plan at Geneseo. Didn't want to go home. It was too much of a party up there, you know. So I started making up new majors and reasons why I had to stay. And I finally needed some cash, so I got a job at this video store. And I was in a fraternity up there. And I was also on the radio, college radio, no big deal. And I was also like a bartender slash DJ in one of the big bars there. So I was kind of, you know, a lot of people knew me in Geneseo. Key to the story is the only reason I'm saying that. So I get this job at the video store for some extra cash. All my old fraternity brothers are coming in. All the bartenders I worked with at the bar, just people I knew all over town. And they would come in to rent videos and stuff. And they just assumed that it was free because I didn't charge anyone. They were like renting like VCRs for a week at a time. And other people would come in and they wanted to rent the VCR. But the other people never brought them back that had them for free. I'm going to take this, right? Yeah. I just wrote it down and said, yeah, bring it back in two, three days. And then if that's not bad enough, all my other friends that didn't feel like going home would come into the video store during the day. And we would watch the sickest, wildest porno in the video store. And then like a mom would come in with like her little daughter and wanted to rent a Disney movie or something. And we all were bummed that we had to turn off the porno so she could go try to pick out a video. And then everyone caught on. And I mean, the books were just horrible, horrendous. I lost a few bucks. Yeah, and I ended up getting fired. You had the porn section in there and everything? Behind the curtain? It was, this was the early days of the whole video. Really? So yeah, it was just a little section. Little section over there because I, you know, you want to go into the porn section, but you just, you have to make the move. There's got to be the right people near the curtain before you duck in. Do you get some legitimate videos first and then go into the porno section? And then coming out, you don't know who's going to be standing there when you bolt out with, you know, with gay love. Sluck sluts from Venus in your hand and then you walk past and it's like, oh, look at that, the pervert. See, I know I'm getting older because I don't care anymore. If I want a porno, I will go and get one. I don't care. Dwayne Reid, last night, what do I see? I see a guy he's buying and he's like an old guy. He's buying, he's got two video cassettes in his hand, blank ones and rubbers. And he's walking and he's just like, he's looking at the rubbers in front of everybody and he's just like this real old guy. And he's got the video thing. So you're just thinking in your head, oh my God, who did he abduct? Did they tie up somewhere? He's got the cameras. He just needed tapes and some rubbers. That's all. And he's looking at him. He's like, oh, so then for a moment I'm thinking in my head, all right, maybe he just needed the videos. He's just a responsible older gentleman. He puts the condoms and the video cassette on the counter and then starts asking the guy, how much is this? How much? And he goes, well, the tapes are this and the condoms are this. And he's digging in his pocket. He's got to pull change out to pay for it. It's like, oh yeah, there's some poor bitch tied up in his pad. In his murder hack pad. I don't even want to think about it. God. Just unrolling those rubbers on that shrivel. And everyone's looking at him like that. Everyone online was just like, oh, the old guy with the condoms and the video tape. That's just not something you want to say. But there is. You don't want to buy those things like the video porno vids. And you go into the pharmacy, you've got to buy the rubbers or something like that. You just don't want to deal with it. And you're like, oh, I'm going to buy the tampons. That's as bad as the guy day before Halloween getting the apples and pins. Apples, pins and razor blades. And that's nothing else for me. Thank you. I've got plenty here. You know? Yeah. People look at you a little strange. By the way, a shock coming in today. Coming in right now, actually. Belichick is leaving the Jets. Everyone's bailing out. Punch out Maverick. He's going to the Patriots. That's obvious. Well, there's a lot of jobs that he was the number one man for. I guess he's a little pissed off for the Jets that he didn't get a chance to interview. But the Patriots, not what you were saying in the office today. No, that is the guy's honest truth. No, wait, I'll get into this. There's a little bit of an argument going on in the office. No, I'm not. The fact is Belichick is pissed off probably at the organization that he didn't get a chance. But I don't think he has any right. Parcell set him up nicely here in New York. Said, hey man, I'm going to be the coach in two, three years. I'm stepping down as yours. They screwed him up by not giving him the opportunity to have a couple of teams to bargain between to get the cash. But it's business. You and I can't walk around New York and tell the radio stations and say, hey, man, can you give us a better deal than WNEW? There's a better analogy, I think, because it's Parcells and Belichick. And I think, and I agree with Rick, that Parcells kind of screwed him over a little bit, even though we brought him with them to New York. What you guys don't remember, though, remember a couple of years ago? A couple of years ago, Belichick was up for the Jets job and Parcells took it and basically pushed him out of the way. Right. Much better. Much better. We'll jump over to the Patriots before Belichick. That would be funny! No, I see what's happening. That's like the double screw. No, I see what's happening at this moment in time, though, because the Jets have too good of a team to just screw it up with the coaching right now. I see Bill Parcells coming back now. Nah, he's done. Yeah, but he was stepping down because he knew he had his right-hand man ready to move in, but now that he's gone... Didn't you read the man in the glass in the Daily News, the poem he read to his people? I don't know what the hell that means. I don't know either, but... I wouldn't be surprised if all of a sudden he goes, all right, until we can figure out this whole mess, I'll come back next year. I would not be surprised. I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised. I don't know about that. Who are they going to get? Are we going to get Pete Carroll back? God help us. I don't know, though. He kind of made a... He's done that before, though, make it sound like he's not doing anything. Right. He usually leaves a little opening, though. Didn't he, when he was leaving the Pats and coming to the Jets, and everyone was like, no, he's saying he's not going to the Jets. He left some kind of little verbal opening there. I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised if he comes back now, because now the team is just screwed up. Who are they going to get in there? I don't know. We only have one good year left with Vinnie. I know that's kind of a joke. I know last year was probably a fluke year for him. I'm not going to be stupid, but... Yeah, really. I mean, everyone looks at him like he's a hero. The rest of his career is pretty much blue. I'd like to see Ray Lucas in there next year full-time, but... Whatever. He's going to... He's going to handle it out of coach, who knows? It's going to be very interesting, Anthony, to say the least. Maybe Scott Herman can go over there now. He's done with his responsibilities. You know, we got to tell our faithful listeners, you guys all know Scott Herman, our old boss man that got... I don't know what you call him. He stepped down, I guess. He's no longer in charge of 1027 WNEW. He's now only in charge of wins. We've had him on the radio a million times, blah, blah, blah. And he was in charge of wins before he got this job. They kind of gave him this extra responsibility, which is like, OK, here, you have wins. Wins is like the child you have that's in college, in law school or something. It's like, it's wins. Very prestigious, always tops in the ratings. Very responsible journalists up there. It's wins. And then they toss him the retarded, two-headed, politimized baby that is NEW. And he's got to deal with that. So after a while, it was just like, oh, my God. And you could see it on the poor guy's face. He put in a solid two years. He's not used to the problems that this place presented to him. He's used to wins, the college student, not the kid that the cops are dragging home on drugs every night. Without going into details, I mean, the crap he had to deal with because of you and I, mostly just you and I. I mean, the rest of the station didn't really cause him too many problems. No one was listening. Right. It was you and I. Yeah. Well, the point I want to make, we saw him just before today's show. Yeah, he came into the office. Now, it's been two weeks since he moved on and said, you know, he's no longer going to be the boss of 1027WNW. The guy looks 10 years younger. Did you see him? 10 years younger. People, I guess, at wins are asking him if he's on Prozac. He's got a hop in his step. He looks great. He lost weight. His hair looks darker. Yeah. I don't know what the hell happened. He looks like a completely different person. And the funny thing is he was coming down to our office because there's a transitional period going on here. We got the new boss coming in. Scott's kind of leaving. So there's still stuff that Scott kind of has to pass on to us, right? Yeah. So Scott is like basically dumping about, what, 20 to 30 pounds of paperwork on your lap this time. Yeah. The latest Opium and Amputee problem that he has nothing to do with. Lawsuit number 12. I believe we're referring to it as. Yeah, big stack of papers on the desk. I'm like, oh, I'll just thumb through this. And he's like, yeah, all the key words are highlighted. So I'm just thumbing through it like, oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, he said that. The only thing worse than hearing a tape of you saying something stupid is reading it in a transcript. Oh, yeah. You thumb through it, you're like, oh, I never said. Well, it's taken out of context. You've got to realize there was a lilt in my voice when I said that. A comedic lilt. Lilt. That's a great word. Yeah. So he dumps the latest problems on your lap and leaves the studio with just skipping down the hallway. Take it easy, guys. See you later. See you later. He's got a pirouette. Yeah, pirouette. A pirouette. A tan down the hallway. Just smiling. Is he in the best mood of his life? Yeah, because he doesn't have to deal with us anymore. Oh, he says he loves us. Like one of those earthquake victims that are alive after like two weeks and they pull the rock off of him and he's like, oh, oh. My God. I'm sane. Fresh air. I'm sane. It will take a little while for these wounds to heal, but I'll be fine. Fine. Full recovery. That's it. That's what this place will do to you. I think if he had the choice, he would have chosen being one of those hostages in India for a week in the puke plane. In the puke plane. Yeah. Then deal with us for two years. Better working condition. Sure. I'll take my chances with the homicidal hijackers. In the puke plane. Did you read that story? Yeah, that's what I... I read about the one hijacker named Burger. Burger. And he was like a real nice guy. He'd be all fun. Wait. And joking with the hostages. Was he Indian? I think so. What a cruel joke that is. My name is Burger. But seriously, folks. Try the meal. We'll all be here all week. So Burger, one of the hostages, right? He was one of the hijackers. Take my camera, please. He was one of the hijackers. And he was like... The hostages were describing him as this really nice guy who would joke. He was telling jokes. Did you hear about the man in the helicopter? This is one of his jokes. The man in the helicopter who asked, Turn the big fan off. I'm getting cold. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows that's a Polis joke. I guess he didn't want to offend anybody. He's got a gun to people's eyes. But then at one point... He just wanted to offend anyone, but I puked on my neighbor 10 times already. Gee, thanks, sir. Curry. But they said he would joke around like that. And then the next second, if negotiations broke down, he'd say, well, I'm going to kill all of you. And the people freaked out. They didn't know what to think of this guy. And at one point, they took a bunch of hostages up front. And they slit some guy's throat. Killed him. And they threw him off the plane. So they meant business. But then some of them were like, oh, he was the nicest guy. He'd come by and pass out food. He was like good cop, bad cop, all wrapped up in one. Right. The puke plane. The puke plane. That must have been something when all of a sudden the engines just went... And the fan stopped blowing. I was reading all that coverage. I mean, I've been on a runway for like two hours and I thought I was going to die. You know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, you're just trapped in a plane and there's babies crying and there's a big fat sweaty guy sitting next to you, whatever. You know the deal. Can you imagine being in a plane for six or seven days? No fan. Hostage situation. You weren't allowed to look up at all. No. You had to look down for six or seven straight days, Ant. They weren't showing any movies or anything. People are puking. And then the body odor, they said, was just unbearable. And that's why, you know, everyone was puking on top of that. Can you imagine? No. Like you said, when you're stuck on the runway for a little while, you know, and a little while being up to an hour and you're just so agitated and you just want off and it stinks. Next time that happens, I'm going to think about this damn last situation. You could be with Berger. You know, I got to tell you, fuck. Does it stink in here or what? Come on, lady, smile. Wipe the puke off your face. Did it stink like this before everyone started to puke? I've been in some of your houses. So puke. What's grosser than gross? This plane. What are you kidding? You're all weak. Berger. Berger. When do you laugh at that? Rick is just like throwing me these stupid lines. Stupid lines. Get out of here. We got to get to the pissed off Puerto Ricans out there. Oh, God, they're still on the line? They're still on hold. This all started with a comment Aunt made about black people ringing up bills on those stolen cell phones. And then the angry black lady called and she made fun of Asians and then an Asian guy called and he made fun of Puerto Ricans. So that's where we're at. And we'll talk to a really pissed off Puerto Rican next. The Opie and Anthony Show. Troll men jumping all over each other. OK, terrific. This is Opie and Anthony. It's 1027 WNEW. We're back with the program. Hey. All right, you want to talk to a pissed off Puerto Rican, Anthony? Sure. This is getting way out of control. Want to explain it one more time because people are tuning in for the first time today, Anthony. All right, I guess a black woman heard a comment we made on the air about a black and white couple having kids. I think somebody said a yes. Opie, yes. I believe you said it, Anthony. Oh, yes. I said the kids would be zebras. Come on, it's an old joke from the Jeffersons. My God, that was on TV in the 70s. Have we not come this far in the new millennium that we can't say zebra? But she found it offensive. She took some offense to it, called up, voiced her complaint, and during the course of her complaint, goofed on the chinks. I don't know how that got started, but she was a little hypocritical. She found my little zebra thing offensive, but then she turned around in a breath and just said something about Asian people eating dogs. Eating dogs. Now, that's a stereotype that I don't think the Asians like or appreciate. So we had an Asian guy call up, and he was pissed off at the black woman who called because she was pissed at us. And lo and behold, the Asian guy had a problem with the Puerto Ricans. Right. It's a great, great state we live in. I love this place. We're so diverse that you can turn your head in any direction and hate somebody. It's amazing. So now this Puerto Ricans on the line that are pissed off at the Asian guy who was pissed at the black woman who, if you remember, was pissed at me. Just reading the facts. If you want to send a fax, that's worth reading on the air. 212-957-9639. All right, so let's go to Jerry, who's the pissed off Puerto Rican answer. Jerry! Hey, how's it going, fellas? Hey, what's up? All right. I'm not upset. It was, you know, fine. It's just comments, man. It's nothing big and personal. But that Asian guy, Steve, he's just pissed up because they don't have mini or some sizes for condoms for his baby fried shrimp. I guess he's implying that the Asians have small penises. And maybe he's angry because he couldn't find a condom to fit over his small Asian penis, is what he's saying. And that's what Jerry's trying to say. And those hard things and with Salsa, that's Dominicans. Well, not Dominicans, Puerto Ricans. Oh, no. They're not going to go with that same thing. Oh, man. Do you think we can tell? Do you think that we can tell? As much as you walk down the road, you see an Irish guy or an Italian guy. Well, you know the drunk is the Irish. Although I'm trying to think of a better example. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, the Italian guy is always upset. Well, OK. You've got the attitude. Oh, not to jump off the subject. I was at Hooters. I was Don't Want to Sign. Oh, it's on, man. ONA is at a training, the People's Radio. Yeah, we love when you guys bring signs to our live games. No problem, man. Appreciate it. You guys are my fans. We're your fans? Well, I'm your fan. I'm your fan. Oh, my God. All right. Thanks, Jerry. Well, we're your biggest fans. I have a joke. Yeah. To say, how do you drown a Jew? Yes. No. You glue quarters in the bottom of the fountain. All right. Thank you, Jerry. Take care, mother. Jerry, I guess trying to say the Jew would stay down there, Opie, trying to kick the quarters off, even though they're running out of oxygen. And probably just stay in there and drown not being able to lift that glued coin off the bottom of the fountain. I don't think anyone is that stupid that they would stay in the water that long for a lousy quarter, Anthony. Maybe the Polish, Opie, but not the Jews, no. Caesar, what's up? What's up, Opie? How you doing, guys? All right. First of all, I got something for the little goo-goo called. We breathe like crazy because we're not hung like a yellow tic-tac, OK? Second of all, OK? Second of all, at least we're not like the stupid Indians, OK, who freaking are starving to death or, God forbid, they eat a goddamn cow, OK? Eat them, you dumbasses, like the Indians do, or drink the same milk that the little rats dance around in, OK? All right. All right, so I'm assuming, Caesar, that you're really pissed off at the Indians. They're idiots. I think they're more stupid than the damn Polocks. At least the Polocks eat the meat when they're hungry. Jeez. Yeah, it's pretty funny when you see starving Indians. Starving Indians, you see a damn cow in their front yard. And this cow's just in the road and the rivers that they're bathing in and drinking in. I know they got dead people in the rivers that they're bathing in. What the hell's up with that? Because it's a reincarnation of like an old relative or something. Come on. Gosh. All right, thank you, Caesar. OK, buddy. Thank you. Is that why they do that? Happy New Year, OK? All right. Because they believe their cows are reincarnated spirits of their relatives or something like that. Something like that. Yeah, obviously. Wow. How did that religion get... I mean, it's hard enough to believe that, you know, the Son of God was Jesus and all that stuff without the... My relatives are cow? Right. And I'm starving and they walk around in front of me? How ironic. What a bit of irony that is. It's got to be a joke, isn't it? It's no joke. Rachel. Hello. Hey, what's up? I'm not on a stolen cell phone, by the way. Oh, you're not? No. Are you a recon? Who said that? Yes, I am. All right. But I don't have any kids. None of my friends do. And I'm actually a 20-year-old virgin. Wow, I find that very hard to believe. A Puerto Rican virgin? Yes, I'm a Puerto Rican virgin. But I guess I'm holding out for Anthony. Who are you? What? Nothing. No, I have a very nice body and I'm just holding out. Yes? Yes. So whatever that little tinky boy said is not true. What are you waiting for? I'm waiting for Anthony. What? Anthony. Wow. Really? The limo driver that... No, I've just been holding out. I haven't found the right guy, I guess. But I would just like to say that I absolutely hate guidos. Not Anthony, though. So you're Puerto Rican, you hate the guidos? Yes. I hate the Italians. You hate the Italians. Wow, look at that. But she likes me. All right, hold on. We got an Italian on the line. Julio? No, this is Julio. Julio, Julio, what's up? We went through this already. Oh, yeah, I remember you. Julio, what's up? What's up, boy? How you doing? All right, you're on the phone. I'm going to comment for this lady. I don't understand what the problem is with guidos, because if you look at it this way, Italians have got to be the best thing you could think. You got Polish that know is dumb. You got Irish that know is drunk. You got Jewish that know is Italian. No, you're not. Yes, you are. No, because you walk down the street saying how you doing, forget about it. I'm talking about you. How you doing? How you doing? The thing is, I think you like Italian, and that's just your way of covering up the fact. You might not like guidos, but not all Italians are guidos. Italians are the Italians. Guidos is just like a label that's thrown on an Italian. You know what I mean? I know. Well, I guess Guinea is guidos. I think it's guidos. I think it's guidos. I think it's guidos. I think it's guidos. I think it's guidos. Since علي eve have food and anti- POW. Just go eat your spaghetti and stop talking to me. Wow, wow, Rachel. What is that? She said go eat your spaghetti, the 20 year old's I'm not going to lie, I eat my spaghetti every day. Cool. I gotta have my spaghetti, I got my carbohydrates and what not. You know what I mean? I gotta function like a normal human being with my carbohydrates. Not a problem. Alright man. I eat my spaghetti. So Rachel, Rachel, you got any brothers and sisters? Yeah, I do. How many? Two. That's it? Yeah. Wow. I come from a very upstanding family. I thought maybe your father just left after that. I don't, you know, I'm with my stepfather now. Ah, see, yeah man. Parents starting to car crash? What? Nothing. Your father cut out? Yeah. For another girl? I honestly don't know, I haven't talked to him in a while. Really? Yeah. Now your family don't have this problem. Yes they do. Now your family stick together to the end baby. He just had his grandmother sitting around a table eating macaroni and just talking about how you do it. It's better than getting divorced than having screwed up families. You know what I mean? The Italian families, they're strong, they do their thing. I mean their wife would rather die before divorcing her husband. Here if the guy treats her, you know, not too good. You know what I'm saying? You don't have those problems with the Italian families. The old school Italian families, when I talk about the new school Italians, whatever, when you get that, whatever, other briefs, hand briefs, whatever, you get a full Italian, they do the right thing by the family. That's the important thing. People, instant feedback coming in about Rachel. They want to know if the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny are there with you, the 20-year-old Puerto Rican virgin. I am a virgin. I'm not going to lie about it. You like girls call your show saying how they're lesbian. Oh my God, look out behind you, it's Bigfoot. They think it's other really cool content to defend my nationality, but then you made that comment about the guidos when I was on hold, and I'm not going to lie to you. I got a little offended. Very good. Well, thank you, Giulio. No problem. Don't forget, tune in to the new season of Sopranos. Right. Yeah, we should do that. All right, Rachel. All right, bye. Bye. That's like our Italian playbook when we watch that. It's like our game plan, Opie. Yeah, it's a real marathon. Yeah, Sopranos Marathon on HBO. This is turning into a free-for-all today. It certainly is. Jay, what's your problem? My problem. Jay is Irish. Yes, I am Irish. And I am very tired of everybody saying that the Irish are all drunks. Okay? You have that Italian guy over there. All he does is drink his wine, and he doesn't do anything else. My parents are full-blown Irish, and they drink from time to time, but we're not all drunks. From time to time, one o'clock to two o'clock to three o'clock. It's not like that. Anywhere you go, they hear your last name, and it's like, oh, you want a beer? Jay, I've got to say, we have a friend Jay up in Boston. We do that to him every time we see him, and he's Irish. He takes the beer every time. Hell yeah. And he's usually drunk. I know one thing, and that's Irish guys can kick almost anybody's ass. And that Irish church... You guys are always beating the crap out of each other. But don't try to get in the middle of two Irish brothers fighting, because then they'll both turn on you and start beating the crap out of you. Well, no comment on that. And it's usually in a bar, drinking. Yeah, well, I have another thing to say. The Irish curse, that is complete bull. You're hung like a what? Oh, you've got like a good two, three inches, right? I'd say double that, triple that maybe. Double, triple? It's duct tapes in my leg. Yeah, sure. All right, hold on. There's another Irish guy on the line. Tim? Guys, what's up? All right, you're on with Jay, another Irish guy. What's up, Tim? How you doing? No, sorry. Listen, I kind of agree with you, but I don't agree with you. My family, my uncles, they all died. They're all dead. And the only reason they're dead is because they drank. All right? My father was a problematic drinker. I can't talk. He sounds drunk. I got it from you, Anthony. And, you know, stop denying it. You know, it's in the family, it's in the blood, it's hereditary. All right, well, all my brothers drink. I drink on occasion. I don't drink Texas, but it's there. It's true, it's true. It's there, but, you know, it's like anywhere you go. It's like as soon as they find out you're Irish, it's like they either accuse you of being drunk there or they think as soon as you leave, you're going to go get hammered. So what? Well, when you're Italian, people are like, oh, you're the mob. Yeah, when you're Italian, you're going to go window shop in the Irish, you're garbage, you know, with a clear bed. You know, you're going to go tit for tat now. You know that's a Puerto Rican word. Or even like Anthony, I think you said it one time before, your Irish friend you hang out with, you check a car for bombs. Yeah. I would do that. I'd make him go out and start the car. There you go. Look, you started. Would you rather be, you know, related to terrorists or drunks? Unfortunately, I have them both in my family, so you can't do anything about it. Oh, geez. All right, guys. Thanks, guys. He's an IRA, I guess. IRA drunk. Matt? Am I on the internet? You're a Jewish guy that's pissed off at the Puerto Ricans. Why? Yeah, I mean, that's total bull. I drop a penny. I don't go, oh my God, I dropped a penny. I better pick it up. I mean, I drop a penny, it's a freaking penny. That's all. But if it was a quarter, that's another story, right? A quarter, I mean, I'm 13, I only get an allowance. So a quarter, yeah. A quarter is a bit more. A penny, though, I say screw that. And that's fiscal, I got to say. All right, very good. Thank you. All right, thanks. Bye. I mean, if he dropped a penny in the Volkswagen, he wouldn't jump in after it, like the old joke goes. Mike, what's going on? Not much. I mean, listen, everybody, I'm half Italian, half Irish. I'm not drunk. And I'm not in the mafia, although half my family's drunk and half my family is in the mafia. But I got a problem with the Arabs at the gas stations. I don't know if you got this problem in New York, but why do they always have to call you boss man? Well, that's just what that's just a new saying. That's like the dude of this this new millennium to call everyone boss man. Well, the dirty only people that do it. And I'm a police officer, so I see him all the time. And there's like five words they know, five, 10, fill up, boss man and Rob. Rob. I kid you not. Remember when the guy was asking me if I wanted a receipt? Yeah. You want the rest of reset. That's that's a lot of that's a lot like one. I'm Rose. Why? And then they get pissed off at you because you don't understand that. I'm like, excuse me. That's that's that. That's that. That's that. That's that. That's that. Oh, what's he saying? Rasta? I want to wrestle. No, I need gas. When they just know the word. Yes. And I had a I remember one time we had a gas station get robbed and get there and, you know, Haku was like, you know, we're like, what happened? You get robbed? Yes. Was it a black guy? Yes. I have a gun. Yes. It's like, all right. And believe it or not, there was some Puerto Rican guys there and they started messing with the guy and they're like, are you gay? And he's just going on. He's like, yes. They just kept going and going. It was so funny. Do you take it up the poop shoot? Yes. Yes. Boss man. Have you ever been fisted? Yes. All right, Mike. Thank you. It's nice to start off the new millennium showing that we've moved forward. Yeah. And we can really spread the love here between the races. Michelle, what's going on? All right. I am 100 percent Italian. Yeah. The other half of my family is Puerto Rican. My aunt married a Puerto Rican. His great grandmother was from Spain, an actual Spaniard. They hate Puerto Ricans. Even though I'm white, I hate Puerto Ricans. Sounds like static or something. Wait a minute. Michelle. Yes. Is your mustache rubbing on the phone? Because I'm hearing. You know what? And I'm Sicilian, so it's not dark hair or anything. Oh, man. Just saying, even the actual Spanish people do not like Puerto Ricans. Yeah. We all know that from the ovation Rick gets on any given day here that people don't like Puerto Ricans. And all signs are not good. That was psycho Rachel was still on the phone. Yeah. Well, maybe she'll call. If she calls back, you call back in, all right? Okay. All right, Michelle. Thank you. I believe we have a free for all in progress here on the Open Anthony Show. Unbelievable. Look at the screen. Argentinian pissed at Ricans. Polish and I'm pissed at Anthony. Pissed Rick in his slanty eyes. Jesus, man. An Italian I hate Indians. Will on line seven. He's German and tired of the Jews. Jews pissed at the Arabs. Oh, geez, there's a new battle. Can we start a new battle? Why doesn't anyone hate the goddamn Canadians? All right, more of the flap heads. More of this crap on the way. Stay there. Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes you don't. You guys are gonna burn in hell. Okay. And then one of seven one oh two seven W a W. It's open Anthony off to a fine start today. January 4th, 2000, 19 2000. A lot of people still convince her on vacation. I don't know what we have to do to convince you guys that we are here live. Almost nationwide. Yeah. Another one of my power meetings during vacation. Ah, in other other places. I was schmoozing with the people back in Boston, Anthony. You are you all schmoozing, wheeling and dealing and getting hammered. Really? Getting hammered. You got hammered up in Boston. I got hammered throughout the whole vacation. Where are you really? My new love, Red Wine. Nice. Lots and lots of Red Wine. I feel like I'm gonna drink that kind of room temperature though, right? I was doing that. Yeah. Some nice bottles of Red Wine. They still have to screw off tops, but they look nice. Wow. No corks. No pesky corks to deal with. The corks are a hassle. What the hell was I drinking this? But the label looks good. So it must have been good wine. Captain Morgan and Coke and beer. Yeah. And a couple of Bloody Marys. Those are always good. Well, I got another announcement to make. Very exciting news for the Open Anthony show. Well, first of all, our article is out in Raw Magazine. Yes, on newsstands now. We should give the WWF another fine plug for the great article they wrote on you and I. Raw Magazine. The January issue, it's finally out. It's got a Christian and Edge on the cover with the Hardy Boys. Right. We were talking about this about a month ago and everyone's like, look man, I've been looking for the article, it's not out. Well, if it's gonna be the January issue, I guess it would come out in January, but we weren't thinking like that. Well, so back in late November when we started talking about this, I've got magazines where it says the January issue and you could pick it up in November. Doesn't that freak you out? Yeah. Playboy does that. Like I think they're up to November 2000 right now. They can't pump those out fast enough. Right. Because there's a demand. But anyway, so that's very exciting news for us because that's nationwide. Yes. Because I was in three different states over vacay and every bookstore and magazine stand I was at had a stand I was at had it. I was like, wow. Yeah. I'm such a retard too because I was at like a bookstore and there's the raw magazine with our big huge freaking mugs. Yeah. Can you take a bigger picture of us guys at WWF? I know, both pages. So I open it up to that and I just lift it up with all store to see like they care. Look, it's me. Look, see that's me. I'm in the magazine. Can I have it for free? Because see, that's me. You can't even buy or have your own image given to you. No, you must buy it. No. So we're excited about that. I think it's the best article ever written on us. Most people that decided to do an interview with us like to trash us. They make believe when they're here. They ask all the fluffy questions and stuff like, hey, it looks like it went really well. Like that's going to be a good article. Then it comes out. It's just a piece of crap. They trash us. They don't understand us or our show or our listeners. They're just shock jocks. Right. But not in raw magazine. Did a fine job. And the Wheeling and Dealing in Boston, we are officially syndicated. Get out of here. But not the whole show. It's kind of a weird thing we're doing. Yeah. They are playing in Boston our best bits. Really? Our best bits. Which is kind of cool. Like when you tune in to the station in Boston, you're only going to hear the good stuff from Opie and Anthony. So like when we're having a crappy day here in New York, it doesn't matter up there because they only got the best stuff. True. And Opie did the Wheeling and Dealing? Wheeling and Dealing for this? A little bit. You did too. All right. But I'm just going to get to the point here. What do you say? Wheeling and Dealing. I see it in your eye. Go ahead. Burn me. How about the cash? Well, that's something I'm still working on. There will be no financial reward. And as you know by now, we're not in this for the money. Believe me, I know. But if our agent would ever call us, I think we could work those details out. Trust me. I don't want my income bracket going up by a buck. Believe me. Well, maybe that's why we're waiting for that. Just let me know when it's okay to work out that deal for us. That's okay. Just ask Sandy if she wants another cruise. Oh, I just realized I paid for that. Did you? You want me to pay you back? I guess I did. No, you don't have to pay me. It was Sandy that went. You want her to pay you back? My wife took Sandy on a cruise. My wife takes Opie's girlfriend on a cruise. I paid the bill. It hit me over the holidays. I'm like laughing his balls off over there. It hit me over the holidays. It got put on the American Express card. Even if Sandy paid her back, I didn't see it. I didn't see a dime back. Well, I remember writing out the check for Sandy to give to her. No, I know that didn't have any of that. Are you sure? So it's like, you know, sorry I didn't get you anything for Christmas, O. But I got your chick a cruise down to the Caribbean. Too bad that's not the only thing you've paid for recently. Yeah, well, tell me about it. If there was only a cruise, I think you'd be real happy right now. I'll pay through the nose. Anyway, so what was the point? Oh, we're up in Boston now and they're playing our bits like all over the damn radio station up there. So I'm very excited. So if you want to send an email to WBCN in Boston, you know, thanking them for having the balls to get us back on in Boston, That would be really cool. The cool thing, though, is a lot of you guys, I mean, a lot of you guys have been big parts of our our bits. So now some of you guys are being heard in Boston as well. It's not just Opie and Anthony. No stuff we've done down here. Some of the stuff I've said is some of the hilarious stuff you guys have come up with. So and now it's up in Boston, right? WBCN, right? So the virus slowly spreading slowly, but surely. And they were our arch enemy. Years ago. Yeah, it's kind of strange to be on that station. Honestly, it's a huge story up there. Yeah, like they're they're sending down the articles every day. And it's just ugly because it was the station we used to just completely bash and crash on the air when we were up there. Yeah, picture to put it in some perspective here. Picture if we went over and started having tea and crumpets with Wilpen Darvis. That will never happen. It was just as bizarre having it happen up in Boston. But after Nick, but after many meetings and many bottles of wine and dinners and schmoozing, we put our differences aside. Yes, we did. And we didn't do it for the cash because there is not because there is not because that's what they're saying up there, too. You know, yeah, that we're doing it for the cat. No, we're not. We're just doing it because we have a bunch of faithful listeners up there, too, that we want them to, you know, hear some of the stuff we're doing here in New York. How come everything we do, people say we do it for the cash and we never see cash? I don't understand. We only know it's like, oh, they've got to be doing it for the money, man. They did this and that. Make a fight or they said this. What money? What money? We're still waiting. I wish I'd see it. I mean, it's wearing a brand new shirt, but hey, that's the first new shirt I've seen you wear in five years. Christmas present. What do you think? I buy shirts. Very good. I'm kind of impressed. We're all whispering. Gap that were you all whispering behind your back a little bit going, wow, look at and style with a brand new shirt finally. Finally. Jesus Christ. You know something? You said that about the nice new shirt I was wearing last week or something. So how many you got now? Two? Yeah, up to two nice new shirts. And you still have like the Jack Daniels T-shirts. Now, you know something? I really don't know. Nothing's that make the crossover. I can only leave the house with so much in my trunk. After you broke it. Yeah, you know, you know, what? What? No, just, you know, I got a couple of nice shirts, by the way, I need my crowbar back. Good luck. I left it. I can carry my computer in the closet. Same on. Make two trips. Please expect the cows to put a gun to my head. So I don't know. I don't know where this break started, but no better feeling than when you're breaking into your own house. Wow. Get a little warm in here. Turn on the AC. Getting a little warm in here. It's really warm in New York today. That's that spring like weather they're talking about. But it's supposed to get a little cooler tonight. So you're a little delirious is what you're trying to say. Maybe that's it. And people shouldn't pay attention to the last 15 minutes radio. I was just trying to take the attention off something private like my new shirts. Kind of deflect the attentions elsewhere. So you wouldn't dwell on my shirt. I changed the subject real good, didn't I? Wow. OK, everything will come out. Don't worry, people. Everyone thinks they're being left out of the loop. Well, we took a break from abusing all the races, but they're back on the phone lines, Ann. Uh-oh. I think we have to take another break. I don't know what we accomplished during this one. We don't have to accomplish crap. That's true. Stay there. OP and Anthony. Is this the best radio you guys could come up with? 1027. 1027. WNW, OP and Anthony Show. Hey, man. Hey. Well, if only she would have had the Slum and Shield, I would have had none of my stuff. Ouch. Oh, well. Pay no attention to this radio show today. All right, Ann. Where are we in this mess of a show? A lot of people on the phone lines. Yeah, we have people full of hatred and racial stereotypes. And what other place gives you this forum to let it out and feel better about? You know, I think when some white trash hillbilly calls up and starts, you know, bad mouthing the chaggies on our very radio show, I think he's ready to go out and be more peaceful in real life. You really think, huh? Oh, yeah. What is a chigger, by the way? It's a, you ever see a bug? Yeah. It's like a bug, like a chinch bug. Okay. Or a chigger. So a chigger is a bug. Yeah, if he was working on a farm, you would know about chiggers. God damn chiggers. Little pests, the chigger. And they get on the children, I hear. Chiggers, you know, the children. That's what I heard. Yeah. Sometimes I saw one time a beautiful girl in our town, beautiful blonde haired girl, walking down the street with a goddamn chigger on her arm. My girl, what you do with that chigger? Come on over here. And I took joy in killing that chigger. I told her I never want to see you walking down Main Street of this town again with a chigger on your arm. So you got to stay out from where the chiggers are or they get on you. And chigger would be a bug, right? It's a goddamn bug. Okay. It's like a chinch bug or a mite. They live under the leaves. It's called a chigger. Okay. A goddamn chigger. A goddamn chigger. But they feel better about themselves. I, okay. Yeah, they do. Let's go back to the phones. Chris has been waiting a long time. Chris, what's going on? Hey, what's going on? I'm Italian and I can't stand those dirty, stinking sand niggers. Oh my God. Oh wow. Come on. Didn't ring the bell once during the chiggers. Oh, well, chiggers are bugs. A bug? Of course. That's what I said. Just say dothead or something, man. How about raghead or something? Oh. That was a little harsh. I deal with them all day. Yeah. Well, what's the problem? Oh, they got these little kind deli's that used to be all nice and stuff. And then you got these guys buying them out and destroying everything and being rude all the time. I just can't stand them. All right. You know what I'm saying? Uh-huh. You waited almost an hour for that, huh? Hey, I got to say, I got to say that the sand bleeped on the air. So what the hell? OK. I'm going to let it. Thank you. I was hoping for the first train of the new century. Well, I'm waiting for my template. There it is. Well, Kevin is going to admit that he's Irish and he's a drunk. Kevin? All right. Yeah. I thought a chigger was a black Chinese. No. OK. Well, no. Yeah, I'm Irish. And when I first got to college, I was getting slammed off with two beers. But that was only three months ago. And now I'm like nine and feeling good. So you're an Irish guy that likes to drink. Oh, yeah. The stereotype is completely true. All right. Very good. But, you know. Well, thank you. All right. No problem. All right. Bye. We're going to move on to other things very soon here. Stacey, what's going on? Hi. Hi. OK. Number one, that Chinese dude, he's so stupid, OK? The reason he's upset at the Puerto Ricans because they look good. You know what I'm saying? They have good looks. Stacey? Yeah. Loved you in white man can't jump. Anyway. God damn. Listen to your voice. Go ahead. Continue. You're pissed off at the Chinese. Yeah. Because number one, everyone that's bumping on the Puerto Ricans are upset. All right. But a simple fact, they know the Puerto Ricans have it going on. And then he's confusing us with the Mexicans. You know what I'm saying? Because what he's saying is that he's going to be a black guy. He's going to be a black guy. He's going to be a black guy. He's going to be a black guy. He's going to be a black guy. You know what I'm saying? Does Woody Harrelson have a big unit? For real. For real. Don't start me off. You don't know me like that. No. You know what I'm saying? All right. The Puerto Rican winning all that money on Jeopardy. Come on. Are you kidding? Oh my God. You're being bad, man. What? Go ahead, Stacey. I'm sorry. Not because he's a jackass, but that's what I am. Anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Anyway. All right. Touche. Very good. Very good, Stacey. All right. Go ahead. So you don't like the Chinese? No. He needs to shut up. He may have a stinky ass. All right? All right. He needs to shut up. For real. Mr. Obvious is on Line 10. Paul. Hey, Stacey sounds like Rosie Perez. Well, I don't look like I look much better anyway. Hey, Paul. Let me ask the person a question here. She knows Puerto Ricans and everything like that. I got a question. How come all Puerto Ricans aren't getting Honda Civics? They're changing the exhaust system so it's not like we left this. Oh, please. We don't have Honda Civics. Please. You're going to be driving the wrong thing. No, you got to hold on, Rosie. I'll light it up a minute there. Now, check it out. That's number one. Anthony over there, figure out all the stuff with the Sammy Sosa. There's no more salt in the winter. Sammy Sosa is freaking Dominican. Get it straight. He's Dominican. He's Dominican. He's Dominican. He's Dominican. He's Dominican. He's Dominican. He's Dominican. Oh, what did we talk about? Hispanic or are we talking about Puerto Ricans here? Hispanic to Puerto Ricans? We're talking about Puerto Ricans, right? Right now, I'm talking about Puerto Ricans too. I was just saying what Anthony had said prior. The listeners did the show and you just called up Yacca. No way. I've been probably listening longer than you have, so shut the hell up. Oh, my gosh. I love it when our faithful listeners fight it out, Ann. Who's been listening longer? I got me a she just don't make no sense. I want to yeah, you know what I mean? I like how I'll get it I like how she sounds though. She sounds like I'll give you that bit don't be she sounds like a really He hates me, but I love this guy anyway, thank me with you guys and Just one thing to say to that lady that I'm Bobby that cool.

And didn't follow through With some of that fresh butter Triangle ringing in the distance and she goes running off for a barn raising man Barn raising I Got a gun man. Very good guys are a rip today, man. Yeah, you guys are on fire I don't know. We're done with this. Yeah, maybe we should go on to other things. I will touch on a little later I think we've had enough racial hatred for those shows quoted today The gays That's not like a racial thing the gays will get into Ricky Martin a little bit Literally seems like everyone else has This new head of Yeah, flaming home mom hair of shocking Who you Hey Ricky, why are you pulling your pants down in front of spads? What? What? What? Living la vida home on Who Is The Year Stuff? Who Is The Year Stuff? Think about girls, yeah. Yeah. Pull your pants down. Pull your pants down. Come on! You two are losers. It's gonna make you puke. Who is the year stuff? Anthony, hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us. Yeah. Alright. Well, there's a little story about him in a picture in the paper. Did you see that? Ball. I got some problems with the story. Wow. Yeah, yeah, I was reading it. I'm thinking, oh, red flag. There's a few red flags here. Now, before we start this, we have no idea whether or not Ricky Martin pounds nails. I have no idea about his sexual persuasion, but we can speculate whatever we please. We have no clue. He's like a robin and likes to pull worms out of the ground. No idea. No. So let's say that right off the top here. Sure, sure. Well, it seems Ricky Martin spent New Year's Day in Miami Beach. You know. Okay, that's the first red flag. Okay. Okay, he's in Miami Beach. And I'm gonna count the red flags. Alright. Miami Beach nears Eve one. Looking like Goldilocks. Okay. Okay. He bleached his hair. Bleached his hair. It's white. It's not bleached. How many of your pals do you know, Ed? It's the new bleach in the pump dispenser. Okay. How many of your pals bleached their hair? Oh my God, let's see. There was none. Alright, so that's two. Yeah, he dyed his hair. People are saying, oh, his representative, his little rep people. He dyed his hair just before Christmas, just for fun. He shaved for a goof. You know, geeging. That's what I do for a goof. You can do that for fun. For fun, why not? You know, maybe, I don't know, pop in a PlayStation game, oh. Or bang abroad. Bang abroad. You know, some fun. Maybe go out for a few drinks. When I'm thinking fun, I'm thinking banging broad. Sure. Not dyeing my hair blonde. Not going to the salon, the little hair care place, and having somebody bleach your hair. Right. Blonde. For fun. For fun. In Miami Beach. Alright, let's see. He'd been on a two week trip with two friends to India. Alright, well, we don't know who these two friends are. They went to India? That's what it said. That's what it said. That's a surprise because they don't eat meat in India. Well, those three did. Lucky he wasn't on that plane. Okay. So that's three red flags? Three, yeah. Okay. Return to the United States. You had to spend New Zealand, Miami. And I think the jet ski was a Christmas present from someone. So they'd been jet skiing. They. Alright, this is... A buddy. Ricky Martin, accompanied by a buddy and his pet Labrador, sunned themselves. Hey, wait, wait, I've got to stop you. How long have I known you? Oh my God, years now. How many times have we gone sunning together? Geez, can I have a moment to count the amount of times we've spent sunning? Sunning. Do you call up your buddy and say, hey, Joe, you want to go sunning? Want to do some sunning? Sunning. No. No. No, we have never sunned. I think we got drunk together on a beach in Turks and Caicos, but there was no sunning. There was no sunning. Right, it was not. Okay. Alright. That's four red flags. Sunning themselves before, and listen closely, the way this is phrased, before jumping on a jet ski to tool around the bay. Okay, listen. That's five red flags. Now, Ant, once again, I have to ask you. We've known each other a long time. You love jet skiing. OPI owned my own Sea-Doo Watercraft, personal watercraft, the two-seat version, you know, the one with the big seat where somebody can sit on the back if they damn well please. Correct. Yeah. How many times have we gone jet skiing on the same jet ski together? Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Ever. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. First of all, what are you going to hold on to? Like the whole gag when you get a girl on the back and there's a handle up front, you know? Hold on tight, I'm going to jump some waves over here. You better hold on. Sure. I'm going to try to blow your bikini top off when I go through this boat wake, you know? Little tricks I just couldn't imagine playing on the Opster, hanging on the back of the jet ski. You know what I mean? It just wasn't going to happen. Sharing a jet ski. A jet ski with his buddy. And from the looks, I don't know, they could not have found a more gay picture of this man to put in the daily news. Noah's funny about that whole picture too. Let me take a look. They're having like some kind of little fight. It's like a little moment or something because he seems a little miff. Yeah, like Ricky with his cute little blonde hair. I want to ride the jet ski next and you sit in the back. He's pouting and his friend is kind of like behind him kind of like talking to him. Trying to smooth things over. And when I'm bummed about the radio show, will we ever find a picture of us like that in the paper? I don't think that you could ever find a moment like that with us. You're bummed about the show? I'm like, well, I'll go down and get some beer. The problem's solved. We feel much better about things. Sure. No. Let's get Ricky's all pouty. I want to drive. You're always driving. Yeah. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Yeah, Ricky. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Oh, man. Oh, my God. That's funny. Now the abuse is coming. Scott, what's going on? Hey, what's happening? I'm thinking Sandy's loving you now because you must look exactly like Ricky Martin now. Well, if you remember the time John Stewart came in, there was a whole controversy how Sandy wanted you to get a Ricky Martin hairdo. Right. I guess he heard it. Exactly. You're not going to get his hairdo. No, you're going to have to make her look more like Drew Barrymore. Well, you can't tell what his hairstyle is like in this because it's been puffed back from the jet ski. From the jizz. So actually, what are we saying about Opie now if he has that bleached blonde hair? Just saying. Just saying. I hope those are not bleached blonde hair. And I didn't have a choice. This is what I was born with. You know, when you start dyeing your hair, you know, bleach blonde. It's for fun. Well, you know, I saw you in the Raw magazine. I figured with a little bleach, you know, you could be a baloney smuggler like Ricky. Oh, give me a break. I don't share jet skis. I've just busted you. All right, Scott. You guys are great. Bye. Same page, too. What the hell happened to Gwen Stefani? What is what? When you're supposed to have braces when you were 12, not 30. But she and she just doesn't look good in this picture. With the braces, how is she going to sing and look all hot and stuff with a mouthful of tin? Gavin Rostel's just like, I'll remember. Hey, Don. Yeah. You're a gay guy. Yeah. All right. What's the problem? I'm wondering why you guys are so homophobic. What does it matter? Freaky Martin's gay or I'll tell you why it matters. Why isn't he singing songs about guys? Yeah. His career would be over. Well, we can't talk about it, but him being silent is fine. He's he's he's I'm offended. He's singing about banging chicks. You know, it's because he has to. No, I don't care. I don't care that he's gay. But what I care about ranking on him because he's gay. I think I'm more ranking on that. He's you know, and we don't know for sure, but I'm ranking on the fact that he's singing about girls. And it seems like he doesn't really know much about women. Yeah. OK. I have a problem with that. Yes. Who's going to buy his records if they know he's singing to guys? All you gay guys, all you gay guys who will be so happy that he came out of the closet if he is gay. And I don't I haven't even bought his record. I don't like his music. He's a nice looking guy. You have to. Honestly, if he is gay, I feel I feel sorry for him. You know, I mean, could you see it? Now, you know, we want to make it so bad that we're going to sing, you know, if it was popular to sing about guys. Also, we've written out about guys because that's the only way we can make it. Screw that. Well, I understand. But I mean, I like you guys. I listen to you guys every day driving home. Living la vida. Oh, that's what the song should have been called. Yeah. Equal opportunity offenders. But it just seems like you're ranking on the poor guy. He's in a tough situation. He's probably got managers and PR people telling him I'm laughing. I'm laughing. He's got the he's got the worst of both worlds is what he's got. He's probably so happy. You put the camera in front of this guy's face. He flashes that big smile. He's talking about how great everything is, how wonderful. And you know, he's probably miserable. He can't get he can't get the hot beef injection in public because he's got to make it like like he likes chicks and all those crazy Puerto Rican girls jumping around, loving them. Come to me. They all interview him when it comes to the garden and stuff. They get the cameras down there by the police lines. I love you. Please. You just got to be the best. Please. Come to me. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I give you love and I can never have. Yeah, you would. You don't have a penis. What are you having like you've never had? Well, people like you make it hard. You foster the hatred of people like us don't make it hard. But this guy in the picture looks like he might. All right. Come on. All right. Enough. Do you guys have any gay friends? I honestly let me think about that. Gay friends. I don't think so. I had a homo friend. We talked about that. I wouldn't have a problem having a gay friend. I have a problem with people being fake. It's not being fake. Yeah, it is. It's having a hide. You know, it's like being in Nazi Germany. You had a hide. You were a Jew. Well, it's not worth it. Well, that's true. He wants to be that famous that he's going to hide and sing about women. If you were gay or one of you were gay, would you be out on the radio and be gay Anthony and say, Opie? Yes. Hi, it's the Gay Anthony Show with all the gay people. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. I'm Opie. Gay Anthony Show with Opie. You honestly believe we would be out? Opie and Gay Anthony. Well, you're on to us. That's why we take so much time off. We're too busy. We can't get out of the bedroom. No, I'm not saying that. Yeah, I'd be out because I'd be banging guys all night. You're talking about it. You know you'd be biting a pillow. I'd be pulling your hair, Don. I don't think so. You're not my type. You're your type. What's your type? Anything with a schween? See, you guys are crazy. Oh, come on. We talk about stereotypes and everything else, and then we get to a stereotype that gay guys will screw anything and you go crazy. Straight guys will screw anything too. Hallelujah. But a straight guy has to find a girl. There's the trick. There's the trick. A straight guy has to find a girl. You gay guys, you bump into each other. It's like, hey, you want to screw? Okay. Why not? Whether he's gay or straight, he's horny. Yeah, but then you bump into another guy who's horny. That's why I'm saying gay guys probably have more sex than straight guys. And Don, when was the last time you got a piece? I had a steady relationship for eight and a half years. Well, congratulations. And when was the last time you boned? Saturday. That's it, huh? Pitcher, catcher. Yeah, what do you do? Both? A little of both. A little of both, huh? It's the best of both worlds. You shouldn't limit yourself to one or the other. It's the best of both worlds, Uranus and Uranus. Those are the only worlds involved there. Come on, guys. Why? You don't think it's funny to... You know something? You gay guys got to figure this out. Figure what out? Just because we think it's funny and stuff doesn't mean we hate you and we're on the road to bashing and stuff like that. But you got to admit, to a straight guy, gay sex is the funniest thing ever. Just like, man ass. How do you look at man ass and go, wow, I want a piece of that. I need some of that. That's like, that's gay! Don, trust me, there are some women, yeah, you're right. I'll agree with you. But you, like rolling a guy over and looking at that big hairy thing is better than a woman's snatch? It's what you are. I mean, I didn't ask to be this way. It's just that I am. You didn't ask what? I didn't ask to be this way. It's what I was. When did you know? When I was 18. That's when I finally admitted it. But I mean, you could look at it like... I really need to understand this, okay? You're at the gym, let's say. You're in the shower and there's a guy next to you with the hairiest of asses. You honestly get turned on by that? I don't like Wolfman like guys. There's all different kinds of guys. He likes the hairless. Not hairless. I think most guys have a hairy ass though, right? Let me check. Not that I've... Jesus Christ, get out of here! Plus I've been with the same person for eight and a half years so I haven't seen one really. Eight and a half years, huh? Yeah. How long have you been together with your partner? Oh, too long. Wow, that's pretty good. You goof on everybody but it just seems like... Then you get these calls from these idiots that listen to you, some of them that are idiots, and they just want to take what you say and then use that as an excuse to hate gay people and bash them. Oh, hate. See, it's not hate. You're mistaken. Humor and fun for hatred. Yeah, Don, I mean, if you're a faithful listener to the show, you don't hear the hate in our voices. Don't hate gay people. Think it's some funny ass crap, though. Think it's some funny stuff, though. And it's real. We're very real on this radio show. We're not going to fake it. I know you're real. All right. I'm saying some of your listeners interpret what you're saying and use that as an excuse to hate. Well, we can't really... Well, Opie and Anthony are making fun of them. They're going to have to be all right. Let's go beat up a few fags. All right. I have an announcement. Opie and Anthony love gay people. Yes. We're coming out. We're gay. Gay and loving it, Don. You guys are funny. I like you guys. I listen to you every day but... We're here. We're here. You guys are queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us. We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us. We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us. We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get used to us. We welcome both of you to the gay community. Thank you with open legs. We welcome you. Thank you, Don. All right, guys. Here's a traditional gay greeting. Hey, Don. Hello. It wouldn't be our show if we didn't put you on the phone with another guy, okay? I already have somebody. No, this guy wants to talk to you and it wouldn't be our show if we didn't allow this to happen. So I apologize before I put Carl on with you. Alright. Carl? Hello Carl, yeah, this is me. You have a question for the Colin Cowboy? Yeah, why are you so proud of Stink the Boy? What that you have sex with some guy doing? Why are you so proud of him? Alright, first of all I'm sure they dumped out of that. Yeah. Don? Don? Yeah. I apologize for Carl. I thought he was going to have a little more fun than that. Yeah, he was very intelligent. Yeah, I'm sorry. Well, that happens. You are. You like what you like. You can't help it. Ricky Martin is in a tough situation a lot. Hollywood and music stars are in a tough situation because their careers would be dead if he came out. I don't know. I guess it's getting pretty trendy to be gay though. Yeah, wouldn't he? For most, someone like Boy George. Nobody was surprised when he came out as being gay. The gay guys would come rolling in if he would swivel his hips and say he was gay. You wouldn't be there? Who? You. Ricky? With Ricky? Yeah. Support him. I'd support him but I don't buy his records because I don't like his music anyway. I'm not going to just like him because he's gay. Tommy from Staten Island says gay guys don't have hairy asses because the friction of the other fat guy's stomach rubbing on it makes it disappear. Is that true, Don? That could be true. Some guys shave their asses. Go shave your ass. Alright. Well, thank you, Don. Alright, guys. Thank you for having a sense of humor. Alright, you guys suck. Alright, but no, no, no, you suck. Thank you very much. Thank you for the setup. I needed one today. Alright. Whoa. Oh, man. Well, he's a... Hey, where's the J. Moore sex call? He made a point. If it's real easy, we'll go on a break with it. Right there? Alright, we have to play this again. I know we've played it a million times but our buddy J. Moore having gay phone sex, he made a point. If it's real easy, we'll go on a break with it. Right there? Alright, we have to play this again. I know we've played it a million times but our buddy J. Moore having gay phone sex, and we'll be back with more of the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit. Alright, it's FM Talk at 1027. Talk, you can't ignore. It's Opie and Anthony and in the studio with us today, J. Moore. Hey, Marco. Yeah. You're a gay guy? Yeah. And you're in love with J? Oh, I love J so much. Get down here right now. I would watch your show action. I would watch your show action and pleasure myself two and three times. I think that is fantastic. I'm all for self-gratification. You are so gorgeous. Thank you, sir. Hey, Marco, these guys are blushing. I love you so much. I'm getting aroused talking to you, Marco. I saw you on a cover of genre. That's right. That's a gay magazine cover. You are so beautiful. Do me a favor, Marco. I'm going to do phone sex for you right now. Come on. Take it out, Marco. I'm at work right now. I don't care if you're at work. Do you want it or not? Baby, I want it so bad. Marco, do you know how ripped my stomach is right now? Oh, baby. So hot. Marco. This is a wet dream, baby, for me. Where do you work, Marco? On Long Island. All right. You've got to figure out a way to start. Do you work at a desk? No, I work in a factory. In a factory? Well, you've got to get that phone someplace where you can touch it. Well, I'm behind a desk right now. Take out the hog, Marco. Because what I'm going to do to you is going to rock your women's program. Oh, baby. Marco, my stomach is so ripped. Oh, baby, I love that. You know the hip bones when you get those diagonal lines that go down towards the crotch? I got that too, man. When your lower abs are really, really cut? Yeah. And here's the top of all toppers. Two days ago, I shaved my pubes. I'm not joking, Marco. These guys are laughing. I do that too. I do. I do it just so I don't pull my hair when I masturbate. It's not seven and a half inches, Marco. Oh, baby. I knew it. I knew you were that big. I'm circumcised. I got a pink fireman's cap on. I have very small testicles. Not very small like a freak, but they're not like dumb a**holes, you know? Oh, baby. And Marco, man, I tell you what. Then tell me about that hole of love. No, I don't do it. Oh, now you're drawing a line, Jay? You can only do oral with Marco. All I can tell him is... Oh, baby, just let me put my f**k in there and you... No, you can do that. Definitely. I'll let you do that. I'll get a baby wipe. I'll get it ready. Unless you want to clean it yourself. Oh, baby. It's going to make you puke. No, it won't. Marco, it is clean. I got baby wipes. I use toilet paper and baby wipes every time. Oh, man. Because you never know when you're in the Hershey Highway when this f**k goes broke down. And Marco, when it's all done, I'm going to make a map of Hawaii on your stomach. Yeah. It's going to be everywhere. That's what I meant. It's going to spray like... I could break up an Al Sharpton March with what I'm spraying. Oh, man. When I f**k, I'll hit you on the forehead. Come on, Marco. Is it out, Marco? Are you talking to yourself right now? Uh-huh. Come on. Stroke it, man. Alright, alright. Hold on. You want me or not? Stroke it, man. I don't stroke it. Stroke it. Show me. Show me. Show me. Come on, baby. Show me. You want to be gay? Let's be gay. You say you're such a fag and all? Come on. This is your shot, man. You are going to get it. You are so hot. You are so bad. You are so hot. You're bad. And you're going to get it. And if you don't take that out right now... Oh, you know I want to get it. Do it. Do it. I'm telling you, you better finish. You better finish. I'll get it. I'm pulling my pants up if you don't finish. I've got mine out right now. Anthony, just turn the other way. Do it, Marco, if you don't... Oh, I'm going to smack your ass here. Smack that tight ass you got. Come on, do it. Do it. All over me, Marco. Come on. Come on. Good. Oh, my God. All right. All right. There you go. There you go. Come on. I'm telling you... You're a good boy. That was great. You did great. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was great. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Alright. Oh my God. Hold it, hold it. We're going in. Oh my God! Oh my God! I never ducked out so much in my life on a radio show. Bring in the lakins! OP, you're kinda cute too. Alright, bye Marco. Horp? You horp. Alright, we had a hang up on Marco. He better have been doing it. If I find out he's faking it, I'm going to the factory with all my gay friends and we're going to kill him. The music was the best part. I actually got an erection just from the music. Opie and Anthony, 102.7, Talk Radio. Forget it. Why listen to music? You own the album. What are you going to listen to? Rock and Roll. You own that record. Put it on 1027. It's a riot, baby. It's a riot. Opie, Anthony, 102.7. This is a song that I wrote actually a couple days ago after a friend of mine, my best friend, we went out to a bar and we got really hammered. We just had a really good time and I realized, why not write a song about the good times you have with your pal when you're out drinking at night? I wrote this for my best friend. My friend should be cute. I'm going to play that now. I hope he's listening. If you are, man, this one's for you. Tears have been shed. Maybe the whiskey's gone to my head. But if I were gay, I would give you my heart. And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art. And if I were gay, we would swim in romance. But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants. It's not that I don't care. I do. I just don't see myself in you. Another time, another scene, I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean. Because if I were gay, I would give you my soul. And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being. And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls. But I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my hand. It's radio. Turns into hot invinciblities.šk Awesome! Thank you. What do you say? Little theme. Unless it's music. You there, okay? Deal with those, I guess. You're in your manhood. I guess that's fine. And I am. Dudes with dudes. I think every time we open our mouths, we'll piss someone off. Opie and Anthony. We're out of control. We're so lucky. All right, knock it off. 1027. Hey, Anthony. Yes? Stacker to the world's strongest fat burner. Stacker back with the Opie and Anthony show. People lost weight with the Stacker last year, you remember. Now the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, the high-end, Deals went away for a little while. I thought they had a problem with us, but I'm proud to say they are back and they had no problems with us whatsoever. I think the people at Stacker know that people are going to eat during the holidays. So they should lay low, wait until they all fatten up, and then give them a great opportunity to lose the weight. Let me tell you this. Screw Jenny Craig. If Monica Lewinsky was on Stacker too, she'd be a lot thinner. Yeah, everyone's making a big deal of Monica Lewinsky. Yeah. Oh my God, she's still a heifer. Oh yes, she lost some weight. Big whoop. Give her some Stacker too though. You're talking supermodel. There you go. So Stacker too does three things, right Anthony? Yes it does. It gives you a boost to energy so you're not sluggish. A boost? Yes, during the day. It's the world's strongest fat burner. So it burns the fat and it cuts the cravings to snack during the day. There you go. Adds up to losing weight. Check out Stacker too, the world's strongest fat burner at www.stacker2.com or you can give them a call for more info. 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Stacker too, the world's strongest fat burner. 1027-W-N-A-W. We're back. It's Sophie and Anthony. Old Dirty dropped in. Old Dirty, yo what up? Oh Dave. What up Dave? Oh Dave was just looking at Luba's pictures up on the unofficial website. Right. He's like, F'ing that bitch is fine. Hell yeah. Luba who acted like a prude when she was on our show, we couldn't even get a nip out of her. She played lesbian for a day. We were all just drooling over. Turns out that she posed naked about a year ago and it's all over the internet. These pictures are all set and ready to go for like Penthouse or Playboy, right? All professional stuff. What the hell happened? I just hit myself in the head with the mic. I'm noticing one thing on Luba. Inconceivable. Well no, she shaved down pretty good, right? Yeah. A lot of stubble right there. Look at that. It goes up. I think she's pretty hairy if she wasn't shaved. If she wasn't shaved it would look like she has one of those big huge Russian hats in her hands. Those big furry Russian hats in her lap, yeah. That's what it would look like. A babushka? A babushka. A babushka. Look at the babushka in your lap. Looks like a Rocky and Bullwinkle all in one. Remember her man though? Her pimp? I mean her man. Not a pimp. What is Badenov? He looked like the guy from the Georgie ads, the Georgie vodka. Really? Yeah. I didn't check him out at all. I was too busy checking out Luba. Luba. Well we found the naked pictures of her. I don't even think she's happy that we found him. I don't know. Because this website is getting pounded to the point where they want to talk to us. The website. They're very, very happy. I bet. Also, let's not forget, there's also pictures on the unofficial website of Anthony and his fur coat. Anthony had a fur coat back in the days. Yeah, we talked about it in the air. During the holidays, he ran into his uncle who happened to have some pictures of it. Now they're on the unofficial website for the whole world to see. You know how it is, old dirty. You know, your mom's... Your mom. Your mom buys you clothes and stuff. You gotta wear it. And you gotta. You gotta wear it. And I had... You're gonna have to see it here. Here I am, back in the day with my little fur coat. You got a genuine fur coat! You're enjoying that a little too much. That's my sister. That's me. That's my brother. You can't even tell which one is Anthony. They all had that long, beef-gallant hair, right? Yeah, it's got the leaf-gallant hair. You're right. It is the full-length shot of the fur coat. Look at them all pimped out, yo. You were pimping. I bet you got your ass kicked in school, though, when you wore that coat. Yeah, you can't wear that in school, man. Did you actually go to school with that fur coat, do you remember? Back then? Yeah, I had to. And I was trying to sell the line that my mom was telling me. Oh, look. Oh, this one's wearing it. Oh, it's great. No wonder Boomer beat you up. Yeah! I think that was around the same age. Yeah, that was around the time. I think it was because of my fur jacket. My fur coat. Fur jacket. It's pretty sporty. I'd wear that now. Boomer, Sias, and beat up Anthony. Now I know why. Oh, yeah? You never heard that story? Back in elementary school. Yo, you could still sue them, right? Yeah, right. Timberpoint Elementary School out on Long Island, East Islet. Timberpoint? I went there for like a year, long enough for Boomer to beat me up. Oh, Derry, listen, this is a great story. He hated being called Norman back then, because his name is Norman Sias. The gym teacher called him Boomer. Even back then, he was like the gym teacher's pet, man. I mean, everyone knew he was going somewhere, you know? But he was the most obnoxious bastard on the face of the earth. He'd go around and fart in everyone's face, like he'd be eating at the cafeteria. And he'd come up and go, hey, like, he'd be standing next to you and turn his ass around. And then he'd go, hey! And you'd turn your face, and the second you turned it, he'd go, pshh! Right in your face. Or like a choc, right? Yeah, what could you do, though? Or he'd come up and just smack you on top of the head, wham, you fur coat wearing fag. You know, something like that. And you were. So, he hated being called Norman. So I waited. So I was like turning the corner in one of the hallways. And I went, hey, Norman! Why? He's like, uh-huh, you know, goof on him a little bit. And I turned around, and one of his buddies was standing there looking at me. Like, oh, no, man. And the guy's like smiling and nodding his head, just looking at me like, yeah. Oh, I hated that in school. And it's like, oh, don't tell Boomer that it was me. That was at after school. It's like, I want to see you, man, outside. You're a good guy, right? Yeah. So I kept my coat on. I'm not sure if it was the fur coat or not. Because I wanted it as padding. I wanted to be like a caveman in my fur coat. So, you know, square off, get ready to do some brawling, little kids around. Punch him square in the forehead. He was big like that? Yeah. So I'm like trying to get the first punch in. Wham, jump up, punch him in the forehead. Square in the forehead. So Dr. Lader told me I broke the ulna and radius, the two bones in your forearm just from hitting him in the head. So there I am now. I have the handicap of being a little pipsqueak. I mean, look at me in this picture. I look like a little cake. Oh, the one I saw. And there's Boomer, the big jack guy. And oh, let's give Anthony a broken arm, too, to finish out the fight with. And there went Anthony's athletic career. Oh, that was it. I was ready for a big career on the pros before Boomer broke my arm. So yeah, just kind of. Actually, you can like, you know, work the bong anymore. I wasn't smoking back then. Come on. Yo, what happened to your fur coat? I was a good kid. I don't know. You think your mom still has the fur coat? Hell no. We can have one of those O&A auctions. Oh, that would be, you know what I would put on? E-Pay? The famous fur coat? That thing is long gone. Do you know what we should do? Probably Ziggy's probably wearing it. Know what we should do, though? With the unofficial website, we should have an O&A auction and come up with all the crap that is associated with this radio show and have people bid for it. Bid for our garbage. Yeah, like the fur coat, the fake vag. That would be cool. The videotape of the 100-year-old lady having sex that we talk about a lot. Right? We can come up with a... We need that. Rick's right. We can come up with a ton of stuff. We've got plenty. What happened to the couch? It's still there. Yeah, the lesbian couch is out there. Yeah. Stained and smelly. We're hoping to get some lesbians in here soon to be lesbians for a day. All right, so our phone number is 212-757-1027. We are here. We are live. A lot of people think we're still on vacation. It's amazing. I don't know. How long a vacation do we take? We're not up to the Howard three-week vacations yet, people. Believe me. No, we get that for a whole year. Damn. I think we blew out our vacation the next year already. Yeah. When do we have vacation next? Don't we get a couple more weeks right after the first of the year like this? Yeah, we're going to try. They're ready? I'm exhausted. What are you saying? What are you saying, man? Wasn't the limo guy here? Anthony was here. He dropped off some champagne for the new year. We're going to be chugging that after the show, I guess. His kooky laugh. You can hear it in the background, right? Freaking guy thinks everything we do is funny. It's like, dude, trust me. We even know what we just said wasn't funny. So relax. He's like a laugh track. He laughs at everything we do. It's like enough, man. Andrew, what's up? Hey, listen. I got $50 for the picture of Opie with the pumpkin wagon. God damn. You know, I was listening to that on Best of. There is still a picture somewhere of Opie not only with the wagon, but with his head poking through a big pumpkin cutout. Oh, man. With Opie's face poking through. Dude, you know something? I fessed up. I came through with my picture of me wearing the fur coat. You've got to put that up on the website. Listen, call his mom. My mom? His mom's got to have a picture of it somewhere. I'm sure Sandy sent it to him. My mom's got some pretty wacky pictures of me. All right. I guess I could, like... Yeah, you've got to take the hit. I guess I could take one for the team. And listen really quickly. Yeah? When you were playing that whole Ricky thing, you should have played... Is that a train idea? What? Because he sucks. It was funny. He is a terrible man. All right, man. Thank you. Thank you. What happened? I said, yeah, I got it. That's what I said. You got your chocolate penis over there? See, when I went in, I went back to the office when we were playing music. Right. I'm playing spots and I grabbed some of the chocolate that we got. Who sent us that chocolate? Sinsful chocolates. Right. OK. And I make sure I go through the basket. Oh, there was plenty of chocolate in the basket. Yes. But I couldn't grab it because it was chocolate penises. So I found the chocolate boob, as you see, and I'm nibbling on it here. Yes, you are. Remember last year when they sent it? Big basket full of huge chocolate penises. We come walking in, Rick is just mowing down on his chocolate penis and not even thinking about it. He's talking, we're talking and just looking like it's no big deal to him. What are you, crazy? Rick, you're eating a big chocolate penis. It's like, it's chocolate. You have it shaped like a penis. You have it like a big vein and stuff. You know what? I don't think Rick should be in charge of worst of anymore. No. What happened to the whole chocolate penis bit? Yeah, now that would be a funny worst. That's something people need to hear. Look, it's on my list. It's one of the many bits I'm trying to find. Ah, is that it? It got lost in the fire that we never heard about. Right. Because the abuse he got that day was unbelievable. Oh my God. Because he's eating it. He didn't even think twice about it. All of a sudden we both look at him and he's like, he's got this huge chocolate penis. It was a huge chocolate penis. It was a huge chocolate penis. It was not. It was a small part of it. It's not like this, like an end. Rick, trust me, I'm Irish. It was huge. I remember because it had all the contours, veins. I swear. And he's just eating away on it. Like Rick, there were chocolate boobs in there because you were like, I just wanted chocolate. But there are chocolate boobs in there. No, there weren't. Go get the chocolate stuff for old Dirty to check out. Because the chocolate vag is pretty funny too. Look, I just bit off the nip. I see that. You like chocolate, huh? All right, Rick's going to go get the chocolate goods. Wow. All right, so Monica's a whore. Yeah. I see on the board there. Thanks to talk about it, 1037W on AW. It says Monica is a whore. That's all that's up on the board. It's Monica though. Monica Lewinsky was on Larry King last night. Enough already. Go away, go away, go away. She's like, I just want a private life. I wish I could have a private life. Then stay off the TV for a week. She was humming Larry King live or something. You know damn well she keeps saying that on every interview. I want my privacy. I just want to be left alone. When I go out to a museum, people are taking pictures of me. It's like, what does that happen? Stay off TV. Stay off TV for a little while. Stop the interviews. You'll fade away. You think camera people are chasing Donna Rice around? She's trashy. She got on her knees for the President of the United States. Now she's trying to cash in. Before you know it, she'll be has been whore. You know what I'm saying? You don't have to worry about it. She was on CNN last night. Off the penises of Rick. She was on CNN because of the whole Jenny Craig thing. I guess she's lost 35 pounds thus far. That's it though? I think so. All right, look, it seems like a big accomplishment. Congrats, but that's it. If you're in the limelight and you're supposed to be losing weight, that's more than just the ordinary diet that somebody has to lose weight on. She should be dropping like 60 pounds, 70 pounds in that amount of time. And the next time she goes on TV to do one of these interviews associated with Jenny Craig, stand up and show the world your ass. I want to see if the ass is okay. She got a big butt or what? That's the thing. But she's lost some weight. I want to see if she has an ass that looks like an ass finally. You know what that probably looks like? Even if she slid down to the point where she was slender and guys were looking at her, you know she'd take her clothes off and look like a bat. Big flying squirrel things under the arms. When you've got a spread eagle on the back of your head. Come on, that crap ain't rubber. That don't snap right back. I guess she would have to vacuum all the cellulite out. Yeah, then she needs that. Then she needs a nip and talk. I kind of like her with the big fat ass. And she's saying that she's looking for Mr. Right, Anthony. Mr. Right. Congratulations, I hope she finds him. She shouldn't have any problem because we all know she's sucking. She's not a sucker, right? Well, I guess she can. She can go on the line and ask him. Hey Rick, we got the chocolate. Some chocolate, Tay Tay. You don't like it? You can't live it down. All dirty. Put down the chocolate. I don't want to eat the chocolate. Here goes the chocolate vag. Oh yeah, make him do it, Darrell. But that's what Rick was eating. This is what's great. Look at the cubes. Look at this one. No, no, no, we can't have a cube. Hold on. No, no, no, no. Do not put a stupid cube on our microphones. We can't have it. We can't see each other. It interrupts with the show. Put them on the rest of them. They have brought in the brand new mic flags and now say 1027WNEW. Those aren't mic flags. You know what those are? The old mic flags with bumper stickers wrapped around them. Those look like bird condominiums. Do not put one on this mic or that mic. I'm serious. Because we can't see each other. We can't see each other. Look, look. Hey, what's up, man? How are you doing? I'm looking at a big 10. From this way, it's like, what are we, it wins? There's a big 10, there's a 27. That looks like a pot leaf. This hasn't been thought through. I know everyone's a little overzealous to just calling this place WNEW once again instead of the FM talk thing. Get new mic flags. Because you know what's going to happen? Mike Adams is going to be in a fit of rage, a nut-induced fit like usual, and just start peeling. Start peeling like I'm doing right now. It's fine, man. FM talk. Get some new mic flags. These things are going to be all hang. It's going to be all ah. It's going to look like WLIB in here. Don't put those up. I'm serious. They look stupid. Yeah. You can't even tell it's a W. You can't. Unless you see like the... I see WFM. Let's order a look. And then they had to... They had a blackout with Marker. What is that? New York's rock alternative? Or was this New York's classic rock, classic jocks? What incarnation was this? Look, I think we can wait for the professional flags to come in. I don't think the press is ready to barge in. I don't think they're pounding down the door to get a shot of Opium Anthony with the brand new mic flags. Because that's the only reason they have them, I guess. So when we're interviewed once every five years, we're ready. Yeah, you see the big mic flag. Hey, Amro, look. I'll pop it right in front of you. How you doing, O? Where are you? I got you on radar. I'm not picking up a visual. We can't have those. Ben, you look like a young... Who's that guy? The spy who shagged me? Austin Powers? You look like a young Austin Powers. Oh my God. Yeah. Leave it to old Dirty. He cut it down. Oh my God. Yeah, baby. Do I make you whole? Shall we shag now or shall we shag later? Very shagadelic. That's a good one, old Dirty. Too bad this is radio and no one else gets the joke. But Ben helps out the show greatly. Looks like Austin Powers. Yeah, baby. Uh-uh. What are you going to do, Austin? Leave it to old Dirty to point that out. That's good enough. Swing it, 60s. Here I come, baby. Yeah. Do I make you whole? I'm not picking up a visual. I'm not picking up a visual. I'm not picking up a visual. I'm not picking up a visual. I'm not picking up a visual. That's great. There we go. Taking off some breast issues. It's away from me. Here's the one. Here's the one. You add it in your mouth, Rick. What are you trying to do? You're trying to make fun of it because it has it in his hand. Look at the vein. I know. Rick just had it like his hands wrapped around it. Oh, so eager. Eager. Hey, Charlie, what's up? What's up, guys? Have you seen Monica Whiskey's commercial yet? It aired this morning. Yeah, I've seen them. I'll be honest. She looks exactly the same. I know. She slimmed up a bit, but the best part is her kneeling in the middle of the living room and sitting there saying, oh, yeah, Jenny Craig's food's got the right amount of carbs. Yeah, because you don't need any more protein. You dumb bimbo. There you go. All right, guys. Thank you, Charlie. You could perfect technique with this thing. I don't need to see your technique on the chocolate guy. How dirty is that? Practicing a little cunnilingus on the chocolate. All right, anyway. If you thought about it for a minute. Rick told him it was the chocolate guy's bunghole. Hey, old dirty, when are you going to get a job, by the way? Yo, what up, man? I was thinking about that. I knew you. I knew you. I knew you. I was thinking about that on New Year's. We're thinking about it as we sit here wondering why the hell you're in the studio. Oh, dirty, you're still unemployed, huh? Yeah, B. I'm big up for you to the Office of Court Administration. You know what I'm saying? You're the most well-dressed unemployed guy I've ever seen in my life. There's little Abercrombie and Finch. Let me think. You got out of jail, what, four months ago now? We was there on October 13th. So November. Almost three months, OK. And your clothes are much better. Yeah. Thank you. Although we did used to come in wearing like a suit sometime. Yeah, that's when I was working at the Office of Court Administration. Yeah. All right, we got a question about the Hummer Club. Oh, man, it is Tuesday. Angel, what's going on? Hi. Hi, who's this? Opie and Anthony. Oh, I'm on? Yeah. Humming Club. Let's explain the Hummer Club. A lot of new listeners now that it's a new millennium, Anthony. Yes. We encourage the ladies on Tuesdays to give their guys hummers. OK, well, yeah, I was inquiring about it because my husband last night, he asked me, when was the last time I had given him a BJ? And I told him, well, where is that coming from? And I thought that he should have came out and just told me, well, I'm going to give him a BJ. He came out and just told me out straight, like, I want to be part of the Hummer Club. Because he's saying it has to be very consistent. Is that right? Well, it could be. He's working it. Yeah, there's different levels of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, so it would be good if you continued the hummers every Tuesday, sure. So I figured I knew he wanted to be part of the Hummer Club, and I guess he wanted to be a quirer, like, quod then and said, oh, I'm getting a hummer today or something. Well, are you going to make him a member or not? Well, that's why I wanted to know what were the rules and what was the... The rules are simple. Sometime on Tuesday, you give your guy a hummer. He is part of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, and he can brag to all his friends. That's what I wanted to know. Why specifically has to be on Tuesday? Because Tuesday is, like, just a boring day. Oh, OK. Yeah, just something to look forward to. Just a boring, non-day. Today's a good day for you to get on your knees. That's what I needed to know. Thank you. We got luck. We just got a guy a hummer. There you go. And with that, let's play the Hummer song, Anthony. Ah. Hummer lovin'. This song was banned from our radio show. Yes. For many months. Many months. Is it clear with the League of Department? Yeah, we got new guys taking over and they got, like, they got some kahunas, man. Balls. They got some balls. That's good. The one new guy, he walks around with a wheelbarrow. And he was able to get this past our League of Department. What? Why couldn't they do it before? I don't know. Make sure those kahunas ain't duped in chocolate, eh, Rick? Hey, hey, come on, man. Rick will come a-nibbling. So we got to thank the guys from Airsick Productions. Is this the first time we're finally playing the unedited version of Hummer lovin'? Yep. Totally unedited. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. Unedited. Thank you to the new bosses. We still don't know who they are, but thank you. Rick, Rick, it's Scott Harmon. Rick, make them stop, please. I don't have to anymore, Scott. Hang up the phone. Oh, good. You got balls now, you prick. I'm learning the legal side. All right. So let's play it from Airsick Productions and we'll be back, okay? Right. Hummer lovin' on Tuesday night. Hummer lovin', it feels so right. I got my girl down on her knees. Wonder if he will do me. Hummer's done, he's shinin' gone. Oh, I love Tuesday night. Hummer, Hummer, Hummer, Hum-ho. Tell me more, tell me more. We don't care where we are. Tell me more, tell me more. We'll talk to you right in the car. She came to me, I dropped my pants. You owe this to Ophi and Ant. I'll call them up when you go down. All they hear is a serving sound. Hummer's done, get me some gum. Oh, I love Hummer night. Tell me more, tell me more. I don't mean to offend. Tell me more, tell me more. Now can you do my friend? I exploded, that's where it ends. I have got the world's best girlfriend. I love to be in his love. I think it's time I took a nap. Hummer's done, there's more to come. But, come on, those Hummer nights. Tell me more, tell me more. Ophi and Antony. Cuddlingus and psychiatry brought us to this. On FM Talk at 1027, the talk you can't ignore. 1027, WIDW, Ophi and Antony. OD's stopping by today. Moet. Welcoming us back from vacation as we welcome him into the new millennium. Seems like everyone is welcoming us back from vacation. Yeah. Got a fine bottle of Moet. Yes. Moet. Some Moet. Some Moet? I love that stuff. Rich man's 40. Rich man's 40, is that what it is? I was drinking a lot of this Moet. New Year's Eve? I got to tell you something about champagne. You drinking alcohol? The bubbles tickle my nose. Shut up. At least I can still buy champagne. Oh yeah, I could. Give me my 20 I gave you yesterday. How come I'm the broke one and you're always taking my kids? You're always taking my cash. Because you're too busy. You and everyone else. Because you're too busy paying for cruises for my girls. Exactly. Oh God damn, thanks man. My girl want to go to Columbia. Oh that's okay. Well we got a little up gentle so send you a freaking ticket. We got into that earlier. But getting back to the champagne, you drinking off of it? It starts tasting like puke man. Anyone else know what's that? Probably because you're puked. It tastes like puke. It just does. Before we change subjects, you ever, I think guys do this more in junior high, high school kind of thing. When you're getting drunk with a chick. Eat muck? Why don't you start eating like a high school kid? No, not that. But when you're drinking with a girl and she whoops. Do you kiss her? That's right or not? Your hormones are, wait a minute. You've got to put yourself back where your hormones are raging. I'll be honest. Yeah, I did it too. Alright, everyone's having an agreement. Alright. Boy with times have changed, you get a little older and they do the deed on you? No way. They do the deed on you back then? It's like alright, she owes me. You know? I'm in. After she comes off her knees, she wants to make out. That is the worst. I'll be like, your scope is on the left hand side. And they get insulted too. You're like kind of like make believe. You move your head just right. And it's like, what are you doing? What are you doing? I'm going to go by proxy. What if she's doing that? What if she's doing that? Doesn't complete. And then you go in for some traditional sex and now there's some kissing involved. She didn't complete but it was down there. What do you think? What's the verdict on that one? You've got to kiss. Tap kiss, Alicia. Tap kiss? A little. They like the neck. They like the neck to be manipulated so you get on the neck. You go for a tap kiss, sure. Let's talk to Annabella. Annabella, what's up? Hey, what's up? What's doing? Talking to you. I am just calling to let you know, give your new voices two thumbs up. That song was awesome. Isn't that a good one? The Hummerloving. Hummerloving by Airsick Productions. Airsick.net I believe. None of those annoying beep, beep, beeps through the whole damn thing either. Pain in the ass. I want to let you know my new husband only after a month is going to be part of the Hummer Club tonight. There you go. No doubt. Deep knee bends. This is the first time I'm actually getting on live with you guys. I've called so many times to talk to you about the Rusty Trombone. We've got to bring back that whole discussion. Annabella, thank you for being a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. Thank you. Have a wonderful night, you guys. Your man will appreciate it. I know he will. Disco panty. Disco panty. All right. Ann, I want to see how good the new bosses are. Yeah. I want to see if they can get the Dry Badge song back on the show. Now that is a good song. Come on. That is such a good song. If they can get the Dry Badge song, can't use the real word or they'll dump out of us. If they can get that on our show, then I think these new guys are all business. Dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, dry. So before my ass starts to get sore, pick up some badger lube. Come on. We got to play that. I got to hear that one. If they can get that song back on our show, we know the new bosses mean biz. That would rock. Yes. As you can tell, we've run out of material for you. Goddamn, we had a great two and a half hours today. What were you breaking on? I was on the train. We had some killer stuff earlier. We were having a lot of fun. We were talking about the Asian. I heard them to like... No one listens to us from 2 to 3.30 and that's when we do our best stuff. We got to save it for 5 o'clock when everyone is in their car. Save it for the drive home. We had a whole 20 minute segment on Ricky Martin today, old dirty. What? You didn't see the picture in the paper? Dude. Don't even say a word. Just look at the picture. What is your thought? Gay. Who's that? George Clooney? They got a dog there too? What's going on with my man? Poor dog. My man look kind of depressed. Doesn't he? I think they had a tiff. Yeah, a little lovers quarrel. Come on Ricky, come back to bed. You little fag. Yo Ricky, what's up with your man? Yo Ricky, yo Ricky, you got to... He's not even talking. Yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky, yo Ricky. You're seeing the commercials come to my Puerto Rico. Old dirty, give me that. And I got to point out a few things and answer this honestly, okay? Sure, go ahead. First of all, would you ever go to South Beach with another guy for New Year's? Negative. Okay. Would you ever bleach your hair blonde? Negative. For what, for fun? For fun. For fun. just for fun. Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. Unless I'm natural blind like you then you know your roots showing all that you're gonna look all crabby. Yeah all right. What's your gay point of view Rick? Would you ever? Ready? In this article in the daily news they might go man. Yeah I'm thinking. Oh wow. All right now. We're gonna break the equipment. Oh Rick just threw the little football right into old dirty's face. Yo where's the little football that is in it? Thursday. I'm gonna rehearse. Yeah the Rock's coming Thursday. The Rock coming in Thursday. All right here's the kicker in this story that's in the daily news today. Great picture of Ricky with his cute blonde hair by the way. I guess he got a jet ski for Christmas. That's a man giving a man a gift. No we don't know who gave him the jet ski fair enough right? Yeah. But we do know that he went tooling around the harbor. Yeah. The bay. On a jet ski with another guy. So they're like. So he was in the backhoe the night or the boy was in the backhoe. Who knows. Doesn't matter. Would you ever share a jet ski with another guy? And while they weren't jet skiing they were sunning together. God that's such a let down because Ricky Ma is like Latino and he's like this big sex symbol. It turns out the brother's gay. We don't know. Hold on. Hold on. We're learning about defamation of character. Oh yeah you guys. We don't know for sure. We don't know if he's gay. We totally don't know his sexuality. But the sighting is definitely in the high eights on the fag meter with this guy then. There's some problems there. My man could get mad. It's a chocolate thing. I know. He better watch. But there you go. There's the picture of Ricky Ma. If he's going to take pictures like that and stuff. They look like they're fighting. Word up. People might start assuming he's gay. He looks all unshaven. He looks like a. He looks like my girl. Well I'm screaming at her. Yo. He's all depressed. You see that. And a male buddy soaked up some serious Florida race. Ay ay ay. Man I love. Yo that's your peach man. That's your peach. Let's move on. Tony you're next on 1027WATW. Hey I heard you guys talking about drunk women there before. Women puking. Yeah. I got a great story. Okay. I went out of the bar one night. Tried to pick up. Picked up a broad. Got her in my car. Was taking her back to her place. She turned around to throw up. The window was closed. Oh yeah. I threw up all over the inside of the car and herself. I made a clean it up. Did you? Oh yeah. The worst is when yeah the throwing up in your vehicle. Cause you know it's just going to sting forever. I wanted to get her out of the car right away at that point. I wanted to just pull her out of the car. I wanted to just pull her out of the car and I pulled her out. I wanted to just pull her out of the car. I wanted to just pull her out of the car right away at that point. I wanted to just pull her out of the car and kick her out. But I dropped her off home. You give them something forever. Diamonds. Diamonds are forever. What do you get back? Puke. Puke is forever in a vehicle. Believe me. And all guys do the same thing. You're with a new girl. You're out at a bar. You're drinking and stuff. You're just always convinced that they need just a little more alcohol. Yeah. To get them over the edge. But then you always go too far. You're like oh wow. You're in the bar. Everything's cool. You're hanging out and touchy feely and stuff. She has a perfect buzz. But you're not thinking that. You're like man I think she needs a little more alcohol. And it always puts them over the edge. Nothing happens when you get them over the top. You know? Too much booze. That's the mentality we have. We're like wow she's doing good. I think she can handle a couple more shots here. And I think it's going to get really funky back home. It's going to get funky all right. But what happens? They end up passing out on the way home usually. Preferably in my lap. Then you've got to make believe she's dead. My brother and me have a... You ever hit a drunk girl? Like you know, had sex with a really really drunk chick girl. And you're trying to dunk in there and it's all dry. You know what I'm saying? Dry, dry, dry. Me and my brother have a good drunk story. Was, I guess high school age. And my mother going out going to work. No more jokes people. Just was going out to work. I swear. And we used to have parties. We used to have parties over the house. And one weekend we weren't having a party. So me and my brother just hanging out. We hear a knock from the apartment downstairs. So we open it up. Two girls. Two girls. Two girls. Downstairs. They're babysitting. For the woman that lived downstairs. We're like, oh they were going, do you have a TV guide? Because we want to know what's on TV. We're like, TV. Exactly. We're like, oh this is great. We shut the door. Yeah, we'll get a TV guide. Shut the door. Give her a TV guide. And then say, what are you doing? Oh, we're just hanging out. Come down a little later once the woman leaves. She hadn't left yet. We're like, oh cool. So we're just peering out the window waiting for the woman's car. And what else did we do? We find whatever booze we had in the house. All we had was anisette. Some anisette. Some Italian liqueur. Hey, it's got alcohol in it. Who cares? Well, we go down there. They're just pounding this stuff down. Pounding it down. We're taking little sips because we didn't want to have any. And they got trashed. So the girl that my brother hooks up with pukes all over herself. The apartment. I think the baby she's watching for the woman. I mean, just projectile vomiting all over the place. Chunks? Well, it was disgusting. So now the girl that I was trying to hook up with is real concerned about the pukey girl. So I'm done. The pukey girl is puking. So she's done. My brother's done. We had to hump the girl up into the shower upstairs, undress her, and shower her. And it was the most unerotic thing in the world because it was like bathing like I used to wash my horse. There's just nothing like just this lifeless body. What was it? Real world Hawaii? Pretty much. Throw her in, throwing the clothes in the washing machine, trying to get them sober before the woman downstairs comes home. That never worked. It was just a mess. You could try anything, but that ain't happening. I remember them saying goodbye. They're walking out as the woman, she came in and she's taking them back out to the car to drive the girls home. And the one that didn't puke is turned around. She's looking up at the window waving goodbye. Call me. They're all just nodded. The woman downstairs is so pissed. You guys are nice. Pukey all over the place. They would have got railed. No, you can't say that. See, OD, the difference between us and like Dominicans, white boys need to get their women drunk before having sex. I mean, you know, you guys like what? But you know, what are you going to do? The girls puking and passing out. You're just going to be a woman. Women tend to stay hot. You know what I'm saying? Like, yo, no lie. My baby's mom's for three years straight, bro. Yo, we had sex. No lie. We had sex. Yo, there wasn't a weekend. There wasn't a deal. I even think like for seven months, yo, all we did was have sex. That's my word. Yo, she stayed hot for me, son. And once I had an appetite for that, for her femininity and her hotness and her lightness and the rice and beans came together. No, it was awesome, yo. Like three or four times a day, kids. Seven months, no lie. Yeah. Stop bragging. Like smegma. I was shooting smegma at one point. Like hot lava was coming down. All dirty. You're a pisser, man. You are too much. Mike's on line three. He wants to defend two guys riding on a jet ski together. Mike. Hey. Hey. You know, I'm not defending Ricky because I think he's gay, but jet skiing, you go crazy. You know, we do crazy buddies. You ride two. It's not gay, man. You don't ride two. You can't on three skis. No way. Tell me about it. I had one for three years. I had a C-Doo XP. Right. I used to fly around Huntington Harbor or the Ash Roke in Northport out in the sound, just having a blast. There was not one occasion where one of my male friends were on the back seat of my jet ski. They would come down to the beach maybe and then I would see them on the beach, pull the jet ski up, go, hey, I'll sit by the cooler while you take around. Wait your turn. And then you hang out. Because you know what? Not only not only you can't do half the tricks you could do when someone's on the back. No, but you know, when you're with the Yahoo boys and you're like, yeah, all right. I mean, you know, no, no, no, no, you're like, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no homophobic guys are. I'll go one step further than Anthony. Even let's say, let's say and I were in Northport Harbor and okay, we have one jet ski, right? We know there are two hot rods at that Ashokan beach that want to do us. Okay. What is the protocol? Let's say the buddy go go for the girl. One guy takes a jet ski and the other guy swims. Absolutely. Well, even if you don't know, you know what you do? You take it over, right? Hang out with one chick, give the chick the jet ski. She comes back, picks me up. See how much of a hassle is just to make sure there's not a guy holding on to you while you're just riding a jet ski. Absolutely. Sharing the craziness, you know, that's all. All right. Sharing the craziness. What craziness is there? You're on a jet ski. It's bogging down because you got your big, dopey buddy on the back. Yeah, and a tail on your back. Hey, hey, but who goes fucking picking on me? You're crazy. You're talking catching about nine, 10 feet of air over a big lobster boat wake. That's crazy. And you ain't doing that with your friend Bubba on the back. All right, hold on. Mike, believe it or not, on line 10, a guy that wants to defend you. Tom? Hey, Tom? Hey. Bob? Tom. Tom, what's up? You're on with Mike. Oh, what's up, man? Hey, you know, right? Why are you defending Ricky Martin, man? No, I didn't say I'm not defending Ricky Martin. I think he's a fag, but I'm just defending. You guys on a jet ski are a couple of ass pirates. Arr, we're ass pirates. Arr, baby. I wear a patch over me bum. Hey, man, I'm going to do it more than most of you. All right, Mike. All right? Thank you. Keep it cool. Good job, Tom. All right. All right. This is no way to ride a jet ski with your buddy on the back. Get out of here. Jesus. All right, before we take a break, Phil, you're next on 1027WNEW. Hey, O.O.A., welcome home. Welcome to your own home. I just wanted to tell you about a story. I used to date this girl from the office. And one day, I took her out to dinner. We were out drinking. We had a lot to drink. We had some dinner. And everything was going great. And all of a sudden, she threw up in my pants. And I had a drive. I dropped her off immediately. What an incredible story. And then I had a drive all the way out to Suffolk County with that in my pants. And it was like the worst experience I ever had. But I dated her again after that. And she was actually a great date. She must have been real hot. She was. She was. Well, obviously. It's obvious. That big, fat, ugly pig threw up on me. But we dated again. It's better to throw up cash. I don't know. It was like the worst feeling driving all the way home. I was driving home drunk. And I didn't want any policeman to pull me over. Because then they get me out of the car. And you're coming in puke. You're drunk. How do you get the puke in your pants? How do you explain that? If you're a cop, though, you see that. I think you've got to let the guy go. He has worse problems than a stupid chicken. They don't know, though. He might have thought it was his own puke from getting drunk. You can't dust for vomit. You couldn't tell whose vomit it was. Thank you, Phil. All right. Bye. Where's Austin Powers? Dennis, what's going on? Hey, how are you? What's up? All right. Hey, man. Hey, you know, this whole thing with Ricky, man, it's like, you know, you don't see guys riding down the street on motorcycles with guys on the back. You know, it just doesn't happen. We're just too homophobic to have that happen. You got that right. I got a no-guy policy for my motorcycle. I mean, he better be... It's a one-seater. Right. It just doesn't make sense. First of all, the whole holding on thing is just a little much. Call it what you like. Call it homophobic. Call it, oh, you're not securing your own masculinity. No, you know what it is? Your friend has his arms around your waist. Your friend has his arms around your waist and his crotch smack up against your butt. And his hot man breath is on the back of your neck. Jesus Christ. Like, take... Look, look. Take that scene. What's the difference? Take that scene. Lift yourself off the jet ski. Don't move. Prop yourself down on two bar stools in a club. You're gay, right? Just because it's a jet ski or a motorcycle, there. You're snuggled in the spoon position. Now take it off the jet ski, turn it sideways, and lay it down on a bed. Oh, my God! All right, Dennis. Too much. Thank you. Take care. Getting to the important issues on this radio show. As always, Opi. As always. See you, sir. Opi never deepens. See you, sir. Hey, O.A. Yeah? What's up, guys? What happens if you're driving jet ski with your brother? All right, let me tell you something. I have four brothers. I don't think I've ever touched any one of them. Not even touched. I have four brothers. Let me think. I don't think I've ever touched them. That's gay. What do you mean? You never wrestled with your brothers? Huh? You never wrestled with your brothers? No, we had pillow fights. Oh, come on. You never put your brother in the headlocker family. Wow. Wait, wait, wait. Pillow fights isn't that bad. Can we see your stuff? Come on. What are you... Pillow fights. We fight with pillows. We had pillow fights when we were like 10 years old. 11, 12, sure. You should have been biting them and then... Yeah, we bit the pillows, Rick. Yeah, you got me. Oh, that one. No, line 10. I can answer right now. No. All right, hold on. Yeah, let them pop on. Paul. Wow, welcome to A and Whole's show. Let me ask you something. Now, I don't know about Opi, but let me ask this question to Anthony. Yeah. Did you ever ride a motorcycle when you were younger? Yeah. Yeah, mini bikes, motorcycles. And when your friend was drunk coming home from the bar, you would never throw him on the back and put him home? No, that bastard's walking. You were walking? I'm not riding anybody on the back of anything. I didn't ride anyone on the back of my bicycle. I mean... Hey, look, let me tell you something. Hells Angels all the time ride each other home drunk from the bar. That don't mean there ain't no hormones and I wouldn't have to bop and say they won't. Paul, we're just giving our opinion and I just can't see doing it. I mean, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.

I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. you like what quiz? So yeah, that goes through your head, right? But you got to do it. And are you holding on to your friend? What that? You're holding on to your friend, right? No, I'm holding on to the gas tank. I do what I want to do in the worst way. Oh, what? You're leaving? What is it, like one of those crotch rockets there? Yeah. And he's all hunched over? Oh, then you're like totally bent over him? Oh, that means remove the motorcycle. It looks even worse on a crotch rocket. Totally, but you got to do what you got to do. You would never be in that position with another man in any other circumstance. We're not arguing that, but I'm just saying it just is a little too weird for me. Oh, yeah, but how about this? What the jet bike? Yeah. What bike? A bunch of us went out to Seaside Heights. There was eight of us. Yeah. We don't have them, so we rented them. But there were seven bikes. We couldn't, like, go back to shore to go get him, so one of us had to take him. Would you agree with that, though? I think we could say... Who's the fag that didn't just hit the gas and take off? That's a... It was you, wasn't it? All we're saying is it's a little weird. I understand that there are a lot of guys out there doing this, but it's just... I don't know, man. I try to defend that. You got to hold doggy-style things happening on your bike. It's totally like... Come on. I almost flipped him for the 140 just so I wouldn't touch him. Wow. All right. All right, I gotta go, guys. All right, thank you, Jack. Later. Bye. Jack. Ride me. Hold on to the gas tank. Yeah. All right, let's give him the reach around. Yeah, that's the reach around. Oh, my God. It's reaching around. Let's take a quick break, Anthony. Hey, Rudy's in the paint bucket. All right, we'll talk about Rudy next. Yeah, B. All right. O.P. and Anthony. We punish ignorance. Hey, ass, turn down your radio. 1027. This is 1027 WNEW. O.P. and Anthony on your radio. All dirty in the studio. As we speak, I believe Adam Farrar is taping his David Letterman appearance. Oh, that's right. Tonight. Tonight, check out Adam Farrar, Anthony's childhood friend. My pal. He's been on the show a million times. You know something? If Adam had to be on the Letterman show by like 5 o'clock, right, and we're stuck in Jersey with only one jet ski, I wouldn't even take him over. My pal would miss his chance on Letterman because I would not cross the Hudson on a jet ski with Adam. On the back of your jet ski. Hell no. All right. Natalie, what's going on? Hi, gentlemen. Hello. Hi. I got a question. Yeah. I'm following the whole jet ski motorcycle thing. I need to know then why is it acceptable and not considered homophobic for, in the game of football, a quarterback that basically has his complete arm up the guy's rear end as he's snapping it? Well, that is pretty homo. You're right. But that's acceptable to you. You know, his laugh as a kid, you know. Yeah, homo. It's a little weird. Okay. Just wondering, like, where you draw the line. You know, I played a lot of sports in high school. Can never get into that patting on the ass thing, man. Look at you. Go, go, go. I hated that. It happened all the time. High school wrestling. Nice shot. Nice shot. And they're patting you on the butt. Or the towel snap in the shower. The towel snapping in the shower. That just doesn't happen. That's just total jang. That's folklore. Folk, folklore. That never happened, right? Have you ever, come on. I mean, every guy that's listening to us had to take showers with all the guys in school and stuff. He never did. Never had the towel snapping going on. Never did. You guys took showers in high school. Never did. I hated it. Yo, they never had that. Thank you, Natalie. You're welcome. Yeah, you were in high school. It was probably like a prison rape scene in the shower. Jesus Christ. Lockdown. They had showers and all that. Lockdown high. I think, yo, no, now, you know what they did? They turned the showers into a locker room. You never showered after gym class in school? That's my word. We used to go to social studies and be like, at least I break cologne and all that. Then your head got all freaked out. Well, you are Puerto Rican, Dominican, whatever. Cologne shower. Cologne shower. Oh my God. Yo, OP, man. Cologne. Cologne shower. Same thing. Great. It's the Puerto Rican shower, man. Let me bathe real quick. I just wouldn't take a shower in class. I was such an introverted little kid in school, too. I would just go to my classes, go to gym, not even change. I'd be the guy with the frigging jeans on, fur coat. And just like my shoes, my hush puppies. It was a drag for me. Gym teacher hated me. I developed real late and I'm in the shower. I'm the only guy that doesn't have like freaking. No hair care. Oh God. It's just like a Purdue chicken. I look like young William Hoagy. A young man's boy. I'm going to be in the shower. Yes, dear boy. Looked like a Purdue chicken leg. Just socked. I'm like, oh God, what a cool joke this is. Gym teacher hated me. Really? I would just come in and like my hair was in that transition between straight and going completely like bat ass curly. So I had no clue what to do with it. So I would just like leave it. I'd wake up. It was all over the place. You're a kid, you know, and I would just put on like a shirt and pants and I'm on top and stuff. I didn't care. I was just like, like I said, like an introverted little kid. I just walk around and the gym teachers, big brawny schmucko frigging militant ass wife. Get over here. Come here. Toes on the line. I'm standing there. Oh yeah. Like I'm a soldier now. You know, in the army of this frigging night. Toes on the line to play with a huge oversized ball. Yeah, great. So standing there and he looked at me and he like, like he goes down the line, like he's inspecting the troops. He stops me. He's like, look at the way you groom yourself, man. Like what? What? He did. He said that. Look at the way you groom yourself, man. I'm just looking at him. He's got like this huge frigging like muscle man arms and he's just standing there like what? What? You know, what do I know? I don't know. Look at your hair. Why don't you brush your hair? Straighten yourself up, man. Like I'm like I'm at the rehab clinic. I'm a dopey kid. That's how I was. That was it. And the guy like trying to give me some kind of complex. It must have worked. I still remember it. Jesus Christ. You didn't pay attention. You didn't pay attention. Not a bit of it when they were, you know, showing you the film Anthony about hygiene and all that. Look the way Mike brushes his hair. Anthony isn't brushing his hair. He's Mr. Bungle. See that lice coming off Anthony's neck. Anthony doesn't offer Susie a seat in the cafeteria. Mike always offers Susie a seat. Anthony's Mr. Bungle. Look at the way he grooms himself. Were you the guy that had like the shorts, the t-shirt and the denim jacket on? No, because I didn't know. I didn't put the shorts on. I didn't change. I stood there. I had my shoes on. I never and I would just stand there and like that was it. I didn't care. Oh, yeah. All the time. All the time. I hated gym. It was the dumbest thing. I wasn't like because they were the sports kids like there were five or so in every gym class that were just like totally into it. They knew all the friggin teams and everything and just I wasn't into it. I was more into science. I didn't like I was like a nerd. You know, in our school when you took gym too, they made you play stupid sports. Yeah. Bad men. Also, I'm playing bad men. Why are we playing bad men? I didn't even care. I didn't care what sports were playing. Westchester Country Club. Pretty much. Run some laps. Where's your uniform? Uniform. What is this? The Waffen SS? My uniform. It's shorts. Pal, the gym teachers were the worst. The guy come dressed in your uniform. I was like ready to just grab some kind of uniform. All right. Here you go. Boy Scout. There. It's a uniform. You had a guy gym teacher. Yeah. It was a guy's gym class. Yeah. Well, we had a girl gym teacher. We had the Dyke. Johnny Bull. The girls gym class had the Dyke gym teacher. No, we had a Dyke one time. All right. There's a problem. And you were showering. They didn't come into the shower with you? They were in the same frigging place. They could walk out of their little office into the locker room. They never did. Oh, as far as you know. They weren't going to see nothing on me anyway. I could care less. I don't know. The Dyke gym teacher I always remember as being the girls gym teacher. Yeah. And they'd shut those big separating doors with the other little door and the accordion door. And that was it. I remember right before we closed, you'd look at a girl and just go, oh. Hi. Hi, girls. See ya. See ya. Now I'm stuck with, wait a minute. You're grooming yourself, man. Man, I'm not a man. I'm a very small lad at this point. And on the other side of that big door, the Dyke gym teacher. Oh, there was six parties going on. We all know that. The Dyke teacher was trying to get a look at the young little teenage chick. All right, we're going to do some rope climbing today, girls. Up the rope, I'm going to hold the bottom of the rope here so it doesn't jiggle around on you while you're climbing it so much. And we don't want to weigh you down with those cumbersome panties. I'm going to take those off. And shorts. So it's going to be naked rope climbing. I will hold the rope at the bottom. Yo, now thinking about it, yo, that freaking rope was high. You had to go all the way up to the ceiling for that. Yeah. Now that I think about it, it was high, yo. I didn't mind going on the top because that's when I finally figured out that this thing was used for something else. On the rope. Oh. Yeah, when I was young. Dude, that is sick. What did you do with the rope? That's like, he was rubbing his thing against the wall. Like pumping like a poodle on company. No, no, no. Let me find out you were burned. No, I was sliding down and went, oh my God, there's something else going on down there. That's how I figured it out. That's when you discovered your... Hell yeah. Your shwee. Look at Rico. Rick is always trying to turn everything into some homo thing. It's the shape of a big shwee. You're sliding down a long slug. Yeah, that's what I'm doing, Rick. That's exactly what I think. I wish he could see Opie's face when he totally writes off, Rick. That's the funniest thing. You know, Rick, that's exactly what I'm thinking when I'm banging your sister. That's just like the big rope in grammar school. That's what I'm thinking. You think my sister is a big schlong? It's like Rick's sister or a big rope from Jim Clank. Let me think about this one for a while. The rope would have been cheaper for me to send on a cruise. You were way out of the conversation today. Did you even hear this one? Oh, okay. Ant just found out and I was scared because I'm like, God damn it, I don't want to pay for this cruise. I was praying to him. Pay for the cruise? You barely gave me my 20 bucks back and you're borrowing it for the train. I didn't pay for a cruise. So I'm like sitting here going, I pray Ant doesn't find out that he paid for the cruise. I'm like, I don't want to pay for this cruise. I'm like, I don't want to pay for this cruise. I pray Ant doesn't find out that he paid for my chick's cruise. I paid for his chick to fly down to Florida, go on a cruise down in the Caribbean for a week, fly back to New York, paid for Anthony. You had to pay two of them. I never even saw her naked. Not even a picture. I haven't either lately. Uh-oh. Where am I sending her for next vacation? So I'm sweating because I'm like, man, I don't want to pay that bill. Naked G-T. Oh yeah. Tell me about it. I thought it was all on the slide like Ant would never find out, but he finally got it. I finally put two and two together. It's like, wait a minute. I was just hoping you thought it was like a real expensive cruise. It was. Well, yeah, for two people, but I was hoping you got the bill and thought, wow, that was just a real expensive cruise for one person. Wow. I got enough points on the American Express from that cruise to take my own cruise. I paid it, and then I'm thinking. Over vacation, I'm thinking. I'm assessing finances and everything. Yeah, after you write the check. And then it's like, wait a minute. I go online to do my banking, and I look at any deposits that were in it. There was no deposit matching that price. Like I paid for Sandy's cruise. All right, I'll pay you back. You know, it's not your fault. It's not mine either. It wasn't my idea. I know. She needed a shoulder to cry on. Yeah, well, it's an expensive shoulder for God's sake. Jiminy Cricket, Yump and Yiminy. Anyway. Oh, Jesus. There's some great phones waiting to go on the air, but we got to take a quick break. If you're on hold, we're going to go to you next really fast, OK? You got to pay for me to go somewhere now. Sandy's got to pay for me and you to go sunning and jet ski. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah. They're going to bring the rope? Where is Sandy going to get the money from? You. Yeah, exactly. She got it from Jen. Exactly. Jesus. All right, so let's take a quick break. If you're on hold, stay right there, OK? More of the Open Anthony Show in just a bit. One must know evil before he can condemn it. I'm Opie. One must see evil before he can denounce you. Anthony.

That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Shut up. We're trying to broadcast, O.D. 1027-W-A-W. It's Opie and Anthony. O.D. in the studio today. Hang with us. There you go. Trying to add to the show. Still waiting for something to come out of his mouth. Oh, I forgot that guy. Wait, let's talk to... Oh, wait. Eva, hold on a sec. What do you got here? I got Peter from my old hometown. Do you remember playing dodgeball at Elwood Junior High with Coach Kazaza, trying to give innocent 14-year-olds concussions? This guy, Coach Kazaza, he would take you into the deepest bowels of Elwood Junior High into a boiler room. Wow. Yeah, tell me about it. With the little red dodgeball thing. Remember the sound it made when it hit your head? There you go. And he would just go at it. Like two split up the teams and you played dodgeball in this padded room in the boiler. It was like some kind of prison experience. And then he'd jump in every so often. The ball bounced off the wall and he grabbed it. Like, wing it like a howitzer at your head. What a sadistic basketball. Very sadistic game. In the boiler room, what is it, the WWF? It was a boiler room match. Boiler room brawl. If you ever turned your back accidentally in dodgeball, you couldn't turn back around. Because you knew the second you turned around, that ball would be right in your face. No, there it is. It had a crazy stink to it too. I never got hit in the ground. You know the guy with the big red welt on the side of his face. Experience is so amazing. He's still got it, the big red welt. You're out. Walk it off. Walk it off. Be a man. Take the pain. Take the pain. Let's go to the phones here. Eva, what's going on? Eva, sorry. Listen, first, I just want to, you're very funny and I really enjoy you being funny. You make my day go by quicker. What are you calling David? And also, what did you say? You tell him. What? I didn't hear you. No problem. I wasn't meant for you. Alright, you're being silly. Okay. And the other thing was, this free for all this afternoon is also very funny. Yeah, it was. The race is going on. It was very, very, I had a kind of, I wanted to make a comment. But you guys didn't have time for me. Anyway, you are, the one thing I have to say is you're being hypocrites because it was less than two weeks ago that you were screaming that you've never, ever been in a shower with any other men ever. But in high school, it happens a lot. Yeah. So you tell, you're screaming about, you said just a few minutes ago that, oh yeah, everybody in high school has to take a shower, blah, blah, blah. And high school is like, oh, I'm going to go to the bathroom. And how are you beeping the horn? That's very funny. I think you should look. That's what you get in the classic radio show. You get hit by the 515, kid. Oh, she never saw it coming. Is the caller there? Ava? Hello? Ava? No, she couldn't jump out of the way. It feels good breaking that out. For the millennium. Come on. For the millennium. That just felt good. You never saw it coming. Getting the first one out of the way. Who's this? Yo. Yeah. What's your name? This is Royal. Royal? Yep. All right, Royal, what's up? I'm here at the statistic gym teacher story and Anthony's a little, a barber, a little guy. Okay. I had a gym teacher, Mr. Warner. We called it a bombardment and he would line us up on opposite sides of the basketball court. Instead of using a red dot, we only wish we had a red dodge ball because we would use half deflated basketball. Oh, man. And he would take it to go freshman verse. So you've got the varsity pitcher winging out of the way. And he would go, I'm going to go with the red dot. And he would go, I'm going to go with the red dot. And he would go, I'm going to go with the red dot. And he would go, I'm going to go with the red dot. Winging half the way in the basketball. And then he'd say, okay, there'd be about five freshmen left. And they'd all line up on the wall, just sort of like targets. And he'd be, okay, upperclassmen anywhere. If you hit one freshman, the whole team comes back in. Well, that wasn't good enough. So he devised the penalty box and he'd get a wrestling mat and he set it up as like a box on its edge. And if he felt for whatever reason you were trying deliberately to get out by sticking your hand out instead of getting hit in the head, he'd say, �All right, shirts off.� You have to take your shirt off and get in the mat and anybody could just walk up to you and whine at you. Kidneys. What the hell is wrong with him? Pretty sadistic. A lot of them are, man. These gym teachers, they're just bitter. There was one in John Glenn who this big fat guy, we used to call him giblets. He played for the Denver Broncos until a leg injury ruined his career and he ends up being a gym teacher. This guy was so friggin' bitter, he would just abuse the students. It was amazing. He hit some kid with a pipe once. Another time, if he caught you smoking, he would give you the option, �I will take you down to the office and tell them you were smoking or you get one punch in the chest from me.� Get out of here! Swear to God! Then you go into the locker room, you stand there, he'd wind up and punch you in the chest so friggin' hard, you'd fly across the room. Didn't you know that's how Harry Houdini died? Yeah. When he hit the kid with the lead pipe, that was when he got fired. He hit some kid with a lead pipe. Lead pipe. Is that true? What am I, Mr. Urban Legend guy? You know me. I only speak the truth. It happened in our school in John Glenn. Why would he even hit a guy with a lead pipe? If you knew a kid, you'd hit him too. He was that little slater, I think. Let's go to Jeff. Jeff, what's going on today? Hey, how are you guys doing? Good. I just wanted to bring back two games from the old elementary school days. I went to school in Long Island and we used to play with the dodge balls, but there was a big inflatable medicine ball in the middle that you used to have to hit back and forth. It was kind of like a tug of war kind of thing. You had to knock the ball back and forth. And then the other one was when you used the small balls to play handball, your hands used to come out stinging and all red, broken fingers and stuff. Played asses up handball. I played asses up. I would never play asses up. I played asses up. That sucked. You're standing at the wall, asses up. Someone takes the ball and wings it at your ass when you're lost. And you know what the worst part was? Not when it hit your ass. When someone was real good, could ricochet it off the wall. And now you're in the nuts. So you did play asses up. I saw many games of asses up. I played asses up. That game sucked. The best was when they could really aim and just get the skin right here. Just wing you. Like blow your package on your leg to the... You guys have like the awesome gymnasium curriculum, yo. Oh yeah. You never played asses up or handball? Look, we had handball. My Chinese handball. We had drive-by shooting. What else did you have in your curriculum? We had bagelology. Because we used to go to the corner and try different bagels. Go to the gym class. Yo, what you having today? Raisin. What up, man? I mean, in New York City public high schools, you know, if there's not a football team, and the baseball team and the basketball team, they get all the props from the gym teacher. They don't even get to show up. You know, they get the little Delaney card. Oh, that's my center. Excuse him. And they'll be in gym like for the whole day. But the rest of us, you know, we had to thug it out for two periods playing basketball. And they never gave us, you know, none of that dodgeball. That was wack, yo. I think that's why they just throw you basketballs in the city school. Odds on, a large percentage of the children will enjoy this. They'll still have the basketball. It doesn't matter. Eli. Yo, ONA, what's up? What's up? How's it going there, guys? I got a story for you. Junior high. I swear to God, we used to do square dancing. Yeah, I was there. What was the meaning to square dancing in school? Square dancing. I don't know. You know what? I used to say that same thing. I wasn't going to live down south to be with all the hicks and square dancing. There's one good thing about square dancing, though. You lined up and you started counting off going, okay, one, two, three. Oh, all right, I got to change places with the guy in front of me. Yeah. Oh, wow. You want that chick. You know, that was the one thing that brought the two, they flung the doors open. Yeah, the partition kids. And the boys met the girls. Here come the filthies. Now it was... And now it was co-ed. Co-ed. And you would. You would line up, like Ope said, you're counting because you wanted to be with the girl that you wanted to be with. But unbeknownst to me... I wanted to be with Camille, the first girl that grew boobies. Yeah. There's a girl I wanted to be with that I can't remember. And as I'm counting, a girl is counting to be with me. So it didn't matter where I ended up. Yes, Pam Bernfeld. I ended up across from her, who I dubbed president of the itty bitty titty committee. So there was a problem there. And lined up, I just remember, okay, hold hands. Which was kind of cool though, in like junior high. Because they'd rig you up with these girls and stuff. And you'd have to hold hands. And then when you'd switch partners and stuff, that was kind of cool. And you're holding hands. Remember the feeling you gave? It was like, oh, girl hand. Oh, it's a girl hand. Oh, nice to see you. And she's holding mine all sweaty and frigging clammy. You guys look like backers out there in the island, all. Come on, we're playing banjos in our spare time. Back then anyway, I'm talking about today. What if you were sick the day they were choosing? And you come back, I came back at the teacher and you're like, you're stuck with like, you know, heinous Helen, who's like this lump in the corner just finally strolls out. You know, I would have taken anything back then. Who cares? It's female. You know, you're not thinking about what they look like. You're just like, oh, female. They put that cheesy record on. Yeah, they had to. Bring your partner around, beat on the head and turn around the corner. Come to me! And cross the floor. And now stick it in, that's your big whore. How is that going to benefit us in future life, you know? Square dancing. Square dancing. I'll be at an interview at IBM, but did you ever square dance? Oh, damn, yeah, I did. All right, you got the job. Hey, John, you're next. What's up? All right, let's go, guys. All right. Dodgeball, dodgeball fun. When I was in high school, they used to line the balls up in the middle of the floor in the lunch room. It was a slick floor, and they'd make everybody run in to get the ball. That's good. So you get two feet away from each other when you first start lunging the balls at each other. Yeah, but one of the guys flew underneath, they cracked skull. One of the guys got knocked unconscious, got some brain damage, you know? That's great. They had those red balls, you could palm the thing. They were the small ones. So just beating your head, it would knock you unconscious anyway, man. You guys suck, man. Thanks. Look at this guy, Tim. He said, we got a guy in asses up who could hit your sack from behind every time. He knows he got it. He just knows, like, oh, no, I got asses up and it's against this guy. The ricochet shot. And do the dodgeball sound effect again. I love that. And it just flies, right? It just bounces up your forehead. That was the same ball they used in kickball. But theirs is sport. Kickball. We had a girl that struck out in kickball. Nothing more pathetic than striking out in kickball. Every time. Same girl that would pee her pants, too. That's sad. It was hilarious because like, where we're from, I mean, you went all the way from kindergarten to high school with the same people and you remember this girl as being the one. I won't even give her name because I'm sure she still lives in Centiport. She would strike out in kickball and pee her pants every day. Oh my god. Every day at like 1 o'clock where the teacher. Sorrowful. Where we had the teacher that had the little panties in her drawer that she had to take and then give it to the girl and she'd come back in the room to learn some more. This is the same girl we saw strutting around high school years later. Like no one's going to date her. Strutting or just kind of sulking? You remember what she used to do and no one wanted to date her. You don't want to be the guy that dated the girl that just peed herself. And strike out in kickball. I feel a little jealous, man. What? It's like an all-American high school experience. Oh yeah. We were out there where there were white people. We had that, the fast times. Yeah, it was like fast times. Well, during the one high school I went to, same one as Mariah Carey. Oh, the one she had the show on? They just did the show on Fox. I'm just waiting for the call to come back to my high school. Oh yeah, that phone will be ringing. Sure, we need you at Harborfield. Any records? Yeah, spin records in the cafeteria. No, I want to go back to my high school and then we'll go to Ant's high school, John Glenn, and we want to do a live radio show. Well, I wanted to last year. I don't know what. Maybe we'll have less of a problem this year since we're so world renowned now. Our show is so popular. Maybe I could get my diploma from John Glenn. Anthony, you need to graduate. No, I needed gym credits, dude. I swear, I need gym credits. I'm willing to come in and attend a gym class if they give me my diploma from John Glenn. I would damn well do that. Get in touch with John Glenn High School. Tell them I want my goddamn diploma. I'll go to gym. I'll dress in the shorts. I'll climb the rope. That'd be awesome. That'd be fun. Then maybe I could get a real job. See kids, you don't need a high school education. No, kids, drop out. You don't need to drop out. Look at your pal Ant. Colleen, what's up? Hey, how are you? Great. I am a female phys ed teacher in New York City. Okay. In Brooklyn. And I am most definitely not a bike. You got the short spiky hair on top, long in the back? No, I don't have short spiky hair on the top. You don't like looking at the naked little nymphs? Colleen, I got a question for you. So why didn't you pay attention in school? I did. Let me see. Now I don't have this argument all the time. What did you want to be before you said, you know what, screw it, I'm going to be a gym teacher? It's phys ed. Phys ed. Oh, phys ed. It's not gym anymore. Phys ed. Physical therapist. I can't tell you, I have 20 credits in science that I had to take to get into the group. I was going to be a ballerina. I know I was not. That is not my thing. Alright. I don't teach dodge ball. No? No. So. You didn't have any kind of aspirations towards, you know, like sports or something? Like being the home ec teacher? No, I did not want to be the home ec teacher. When you were growing up, you didn't possibly say to yourself, I want to be a female gym teacher. Phys ed. Phys ed gym teacher. Oh, and the colors. You got a chrome whistle? Come on ladies, we're going to go on a balance beam. We don't have mats, so I'll act as the mat today. You don't need those pesky underwear. Oh, stop. I'll just stand here and, oh, look at you, you little thing. Wow, it's still in the shape of a diamond. It's not at all even remotely like that. Oh yeah, I've seen plenty. They are. No, but I'm not. You can't love us all together. I'm sorry. My husband would disagree with you. Ah, what's her name? He's not going to be happy. He's listening. Pat. He undrugs you, this Pat. There you go. Oh, we're just messing with your colleague. That's fine. Alright. Very well. Have a good night. You too, Colin. Bye. Bye. A woman's perspective on Jim. Vicki? Hi. Hi. How are you doing? Very good. I tried being in seventh grade with a sea cop playing medicine ball. You had a couple of medicine balls of your own. Yeah, I did. I was the first one to develop a medicine ball. Oh, God. The guys have never forgotten you. To this day, they mention your name. Yeah, they come up to me now. Ready? Ready? I'll play it with everyone in the room. Who was the first girl that grew boobs? I don't remember the last name, but first name. Sixth grade, Cuba Hill Elementary School. Jerry. Jerry was her name. Rick? The good old dirty person. She kicked me in the crotch through the back. Everyone in their car right now is naming a name. Every guy. For me, it was Camille Brumner. Oh, I'm flattered. This is terrible though. And those medicine balls hurt. Maribel? You know what old dirty's problem is? He can't think back to second grade. Oh, something kind of old dirty. He went to a work school. Old dirty. Old dirty. Just remember, the last time you were in school. Oh, man. You guys make me laugh today with this stuff. And I've got to tell you about the square dancing. The girls, they hated it, but inside they loved it. They wanted to dance with the boys. They had their pegs. And you're right, they did pick their pegs. Let me tell you something. I didn't mind the square dancing because we got to touch females. Yeah, that was the whole thing. Even just touching hands was pretty cool. Oh, yeah. I didn't mind the square dancing because we got to touch females. Yeah, that was the whole thing. Even just touching hands was pretty cool. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. If you didn't like the girl you were with, they would do that thing where it's like exchange your partner. Uh-huh. And you go forward, be gone, you go across. At that age, they didn't even care. It was female. All of that mattered to me. No, girls are different though. Girls get together. That's like third or fourth grade, right? Sometimes you have to. They never made it to junior high. They were in sixth. Yeah, there was grammar school. Yeah. But the girls, they sit together and they go, okay, you can have this guy today. Right. And unless they fight over it. Thank you. Thank you, Vicki. Take care, guys. With the lovely, are they still Cs or they have to Ds? I'm very short. They're still Cs. Okay. All right. You want to square dance. One, two, one, two. Dirty China. Uh, Brian, you're next. Hey. Hey. O&A? Yeah. Hey, what's going on? All right. I went to school growing up in Manhattan. Junior high school, high school, elementary school, everything. We played kill a man with a ball. Kill the guy with a ball. Remember that game? In our day, it was a hook ball, no rules. You just kill the guy with the ball. It was a hook ball. It was a hook ball. You just kill the guy with the ball. In our neighborhood, it was called smear the queer. Yeah, we played that out here. We didn't know what queer meant back then, but that was the name of the game. We played it on concrete, like out in the street. I remember getting tackled and I lost one of my teeth and both teams are running around the park looking for my tooth. There was always a guy that just, I mean, you're playing like kill the guy with the ball and his arm would just snap and the bone would pop right through. There was always one guy. Exactly. All right. Exactly. And then growing up in school, you know, we played that in high school and junior high school. And then I went to junior high school. I went to Lower East Side of Manhattan. Yeah. And then it was more just like kill anybody. It turned into like kill the white guy. It was going to be all easy. I'll forget about kill the man with the ball. It was just kill the white guy. All right. Well, thank you, Brian. You're welcome. I want to take a break, but Russ swears that he had a midget gym teacher. Oh, come on. Hey, Russ. Hey, how you doing? How you doing? Hey, forget about it. Forget about it. What's up, Russ? Yeah. In high school, we had a midget gym teacher. I'm not lying. Oh, my God. He was about four foot. We called him Oompa Loompa. Totally didn't get nothing done. Oompa Loompa. I swear to God. So, hey, you can go to my own high school and just like pass this class. That's weird, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it was really weird. I mean, we had like a normal gym teacher, of course, the lesbian gym teacher for the girls. Yeah. You had like Mini Me teaching your gym. Yeah, Mini Me was the gym teacher and we just like totally did. Towards the end, he was like asking us to do one of something. That's pretty weird. Yeah. All right, man. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you, Russ. Bye. Bye. And with that, let's take a quick break. We'll be back, okay? All right.
