 A gigantic boombox is coming down the street. Hand me the RPG-7. Orly and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. I'll be in Anthony! In my day, radio was boring all the time. And we like it that way. And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath! Alright, we gotta get Spazz in here. Yeah, quite frankly, he's gonna bore us here. Gay boy! Alright, so if you're faithful to the show, Spazz, who you've kept off the radio for a while now, thank God. He finally completed his gay play run. How many plays were there? Five. Five of this plastic. I remember the first night you said, I don't know, you kind of had a scene where you had to lay in the bed with this guy. He kind of put his hands through your hair. And as the lights went dim, he made like he was going south to pleasure. Yes. That's the scene. I knew we were supposed to be straight in this play, but I was supposed to be confused with your sexuality. You had one gay experience before this, and now for some reason you're in bed with this gay guy. Is this the play or his life we're talking about? I'm confused now. He's supposed to seduce me in the play. Right. And you're in his bed. No, he's in my bed. He comes into my room. So you have the homo-field advantage. How did that come about? How do you invite the gay guy back to your room? I didn't invite him in. The way the scene starts is that I'm in my bed sobbing. I'm fighting not to cry because of the tragedy in my life. And he hears that through the partition in the wall. So he comes in and he... Takes a temperature the old-fashioned way. He pounds me down and he seduces me. He uses the excuse that I want to know why I'm... That's every day that I'm in bed and if someone's knocking at the door I just let them in and invite them into my bed. It's a play, you know. No coffee or anything? I don't invite them in because it's just like a little thin wall with a little slide door. He just walks right in. Oh, he just came right in. I walk into his bathroom. Is this supposed to be your apartment? It's supposed to be... It was an old house in 1938 in New Orleans. Alright. And you're just living with gay guys. No, one is gay. The other one... If he gets $100 he'll do it. And you're supposedly this confused guy. I'm the confused guy. So now the gay guy's in your bed. You have to talk about this because I know that a lot of listeners were happy about Spaz Free. Oh, shit. So you're in the bed. And he's sitting on the bed with you. Yes. He starts, the actor, starts improvising a little bit on the scene. Let's get this straight because basically you all agree that you'll do this gay scene but there's no touching, right? Well, there's only two parts where he touches me. One is when he runs his finger down my arm. And the other part is when he puts his arm around my shoulders. And you agree to that but no more for this play? Yes. But the actor starts improvising? Yes. What did the actor do to you during the gay play? Now the first couple of nights he started improvising just a little bit. Just a little bit. So what was he doing then? Well, instead of a finger he put his whole hand... And rubbed down your where? He rubbed down my thigh. So he's rubbing down your thigh. And then what was he doing? You said something with... I don't know. What was he doing? Wasn't he breathing? Oh, yes. He nubbed my ear. What? He took my earlobe, like he held on to my earlobe, shook it a little. What is he, Carol Burnett? So he grabbed your ear? He grabbed my earlobe, yes. So he fingered your ear? He didn't finger, he just grabbed down the earlobe. So he had a hold of your ear? Yes, your ear. My ear, yeah. That's what I said. So he gently fingered your ear. Your ear, I said. Your ear. My ear. Your ear. He had his hand all over your ear. Did he poke anything in your ear? No. He just grabbed onto it. He just grabbed your ear. And kind of flitted around with a finger. Did it sound like my behind? No, I'm saying your ear. You're from New York. This is how we talk. Your ear. He said your ear. He fingered your ear. He grabbed onto it. He shook it with his fingers. He kind of played with his fingers on your ear. Yes. On my ear, yeah. That's what I said, your ear. So was he blowing into your ear? No, he didn't get that far. Alright. Did he tongue your ear? No. I got an ass. No, he did not tongue anything. Did he diddle your ear? It's like saying here's a look at you kid type thing. Would you consider it a diddle? Did he diddle your ear? What do you mean by that? You know what a diddle is? He just grabbed onto it and looked at me dead in the eye. So he used two fingers? He used two fingers. Two fingers on your ear? Yeah. Wow, Spash. That's all I could say. So that was the first night of improvising. Yes. So now the next night, he gets a little more bold with you. Well, I don't know if this was intentional or not. But this is part where he's supposed to say shh, listen to the rain. And I'm supposed to turn my head away and look out the fake window and look at the rain. And when he's doing this, he's supposed to say I'm going to give you this to help you to sleep. And he puts his hand underneath the sheets. So it's supposed to be manually doing something? No, he's supposed to be reaching for it. How are you supposed to hear the rain if he's got a finger in your ear? No, he just numbs it at the end of the eye. So you're listening to the rain? Yeah, I'm listening to the rain and he's moving his hand and he kind of nipped it. Now wait a minute. What? He nipped your schlong? Ah, fag! It was unintentional. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Dude. What do you mean? No offense, but at that point you break character and you punch it in the head. I broke character in a different way. I laughed a little bit. Oh, you laughed? Before you giggled like a little schoolgirl? Giggled like a bitch, man. No! I left my ear! I did not laugh! No! This is the way it happened. Because I was not expecting it! Did he touch your unit? He nipped the tip. Now, I'm not a fag! He touched the tip. He just brushed it. He nipped it. So you even know all the terminology. Yeah, he nipped it. And you giggled like a schoolgirl. I didn't giggle like a schoolgirl. How did you laugh? Give us a little laugh. You broke character, what did you do? I didn't laugh, I had this smile on my face. What? Wait, let me tell you something. Player No Play, someone's touching my sling, even if they nip into it, that's not the look that's on my face. The look on my face is... It's not a big smile, right? Let me just tell you why I had it. Because I was not expecting it. Because he has a tendency to play jokes around the... Oh yeah, what a joke. But the joke's on him, because you're not gay, right? Yeah, sure. And the look of pure shock on your face? That's how I react to everything. That's how I react to everything. That's like my defense against... My defense against everything. No, uncertainty. But he nipped it. He nipped it. Laughing is my defense against something if I'm not so afraid of it. I can see you on Cell Block D, just giggling your ass off. Like you're a new boy. Hey, that's good. Laughing is my defense against something. Laughing is my defense. He's tossing my salad. No, look, I'm tossing salad. It would never go that far. Look at me. Look, I'm taking... It would never go that far. Oh sure, so how far would it go? If he nipped it? He nipped it. I was not expecting it. And things I get surprised that I laugh at. So you laugh. So now, moving on. There was another instance where he is supposed to take his head and move it down towards your intimate area. To simulate that he's having a non-pleasuring. So at one point he gets so close. Now Spaz, you are wearing nothing but flesh colored boxer shorts. Yes, and what was he wearing? He was wearing the European underwear with the outline. European underwear with the outline. What is that? It's like the outline. It's a speedo. No, it's like the shape of your thing. The back is like a thumb. It acts like a speedo, yes. Oh my god. But it's underwear. So this guy is obviously gay. No, he's not. Please. He's a respected man. Look, he's defending his boyfriend. So are you trying to say that gay people aren't respected? No. You're one of them. You shouldn't put him down. I'm not one of them. I'm not making any accusations against anybody because he's a good friend of mine. I asked if he was gay and you said no because he's a respected man. Implying that gay people aren't respected. I'm not going to make that accusation. You just did. We have a lot of gay listeners. They're going to be pissed off at you. I already said that I could be friends with a gay person. Oh gee, you pretty much patted down with one. I hope you could be friends. He's not gay though. Don't do the gay community a favor or anything. I could be friends with him. Gee, thanks. So Spass, now you're wearing your boxer shorts. And he's wearing his European little... European suit or whatever. Now I guess the front of the boxers has the normal hole in it. Yes. So as he does his little move where he moves south, he gets so close. What do you feel? Breath. You feel hot steamy man breath on your unit. There's a reason for that? There's a reason for that? The reason for that is that that particular night, that particular night the lights were coming down really slow. Yeah. So he has to stretch the seams. So what he has to do is he has to hold his position there. Yeah, hold his position. So how does man breath on your penis feel? Yeah, how does that feel? Hot steamy man breath. It feels weird. And what about razors? What, you think I liked it? Not once did I get excited. You're going to do that again though, right? No, that... Man breath! Man breath! No, that... No! Little bitch laugh. I do not laugh like that, alright? I'm a man who laughs. I need to be told something funny. This stuff isn't funny? What are you crazy? At that particular time I had a look of confusion on my face because I was looking in the direction of the lighting person. Oh, looking in the direction? Oh, direction. Alright, so let me get this straight. You had a look of confusion because you were looking at the lighting director. And that's why you were confused. It wasn't because there was man breath on your penis. No, I was confused at two things. No, actually because the slow lighting led to the man breath. Hot steamy man breath. 1-900 calls. Like I said, it probably was purely unintentional. Oh, sure. He couldn't just get far enough away. No, because look, he had a simulator. So he had to put the blanket up and he had his face like right there. Was his head moving? What? Did you have your hand on the back of his head? No, because he asked me to lean back and imagine the paratroopers. So I had to lean back. What? Paratrooper. The paratrooper was the first person I had a relationship with a long time ago. Geronimo. Pooper trooper? Pull my cord. Oh, spaz man. You couldn't find a production of Oklahoma? Oklahoma, yeah. OP and Anthony. 1027, WNEW. OP. I'm all for violence sometimes. Anthony. God, I want to punch you in the face. Better leave a bruise. 1027, WNEW. That's right. It's the OP show today. Screw Anthony, I don't need him anymore. Where the hell is Anthony? He's checking his stocks, isn't he? That bastard. All right, screw him. We're going solo today. Here he comes. Loser. You said two songs. You said two songs. I don't need you anymore. You said two. I don't need you. I will not be doing a radio show with you anymore. I thought that was the first song, OP. That was the second. Bush was the first. Hey, what's up? Hey, Eric. Glad I could make it. Let's make believe we haven't talked to each other for the last three hours. Yeah. I had to turn Anthony on to the lesbian stuff from HBO. Yeah, we're watching that in the office. If these walls could talk. If this gash could talk. Yeah. They replayed last night on HBO. We got a tape. I had to turn my buddy Anthony on to it. Finally. I heard a bunch of people talking about it. I hadn't seen it. Now I finally saw it. Oh my God. There was problems with the matching of the lesbians, right? Yeah, definitely. They needed Michelle Williams with Sharon Stone. Right. That would have been a hot lesbo scene. But instead you get Ellen DeGeneres with Sharon Stone. We're trying to figure out if that's Ellen DeGeneres' boob. I think it is. You really think that's her boob? I think it was. There were quick shots and one of her laying on her back. So that was kind of weird. You can't really tell firmness or anything by laying on her back. Well, it looked like a little pancake. And then one where she was kind of bending over Sharon Stone, like hunched over her. And it was just hanging down. Hanging side boob. And it didn't look bad there. I don't know. It's amazing though. I saw everything that everybody watched that show for. And it took about a minute and a half. Oh yeah. The whole show, how long was it? I think each vignette, I think they're called vignettes, were like 20-25 minutes long. So you're talking a show, what, an hour long show? Well, we got the tape and we just went to the lesbian scenes. That's all we did. And we didn't do the lesbian scene in the first one because they were old Lesbos. I guess it was two old Lesbo broads. We had no desire to check out that lesbian scene. Geez. Even I did not want to see that, Anthony. You're proud of me? Yeah, I know. Thank God. Rick's like, oh, there's the old Lesbos at the beginning. Oh, it's like, nah, no, thank you. But, man, some of those scenes, pretty hot. And then the other one they had, what's her name there, from Dawson's Creek? Michelle Williams and Chloe or whatever her name is. Oh God, that one is a man. I know. There's nothing worse than seeing a lesbian scene where one of the Lesbos looks like a man. It was ridiculous. But that Michelle Williams, well, that's not bad. She was always a first Lesbo experience, I guess. She's in the bed, she's getting her clothes peeled off, she's giggling. That was hot. She opens up, pulls the shirt up. She's all timid and stuff, and the other girl just nails her hands down. Yeah, hands her hand against the headboard of the bed. Then she cups the right one a little bit. And then with one hand goes right down, beef, to play What's in My Pants? Squirming. That was pretty hot. Pretty much like the scenes we've been seeing in the studio. I want to be a lesbian for a day. Yeah, on the Lesbo couch, for sure. So what did you think? It's all you liked, right? You didn't have to sit through the bullcrap storylines. Yeah, I thought they were pretty hot Lesbo scenes. But they didn't have that glazed donut look when they were done. They were basking in the afterglow, and they were both completely dry. All of them. You know, the little... Come on. At least a little bit. Eric, what's going on? Yeah, what's up, guys? How are you? Feeling. The field broads don't go out in the thing last night. Oh, no? Well, we didn't want to fast-forward through it to see. We just assumed they were having old broad Lesbo sex, and we didn't want to go there. What does that look like? Definitely not, man. It's like bumping cow tongues. It's like any other... Like any other clam. Like any other clam, though, you don't want the old ones. You want the newer, tighter ones. The young, supple Lesbo scenes. The older clams, if you find you open them up, they're a little stinky, a little gamey. The color's a little off. The color's a little off. Could be a little chewy. And in the long run, it could make you sick. Okay, terrific. Very good. All right, sir. Guys, am I getting an appropriate bill? You've got to do something. Yeah, we're going to have some contest for those damn things today. All right. All right, we'll do that a little later. All right. All right, man. Thanks. Peace. Let's go to Bob. Bob! Bob! What's up, Bob? What's up? I saw Michelle Williams in an off-Broadway play down here called Killer Joe. Yeah? She did a totally nude scene. Get out of town. And you can tell that the entire audience just went there because she was doing a nude scene. Just to see her naked. Yeah, she's got one of those hot bodies, man. Yeah, because when the scene came up, you could hear a pin drop and everybody leaning forward in their chairs. You heard the whole audience like, eeeeee. Everybody just wanted to see that. It was a bunch of lectures. Yeah, they sat straight up to check it out. And they had to hire a guy for the theater, too, to squeegee the floors when they were done. Yeah, she was born to be naked, definitely. Born to be naked. Good line, Rick. Thank you. Born to be naked. I like that. We're going to use that one on the show. We're going to ask girls if they were born to be naked. Well. Born to be naked. Thank you, Bob. Okay. All right, peace. Let's go to Mike. Mike, you're next on NAW. Oh, B. I see we've fixed the phones. Yeah, what's up, Mike? What's going on? Not much. Listen, watch at the end of that. It's got stand-ins for those two. It ain't her boob. It looked like her face in that scene where she's on her back. Yeah. That was all Sharon Stone, though. You can tell. No, that was. I have to say yes. But at the end of the credits, it has something that says stand-in for those two. Oh, really? I don't think that was all Ellen DeGeneres. No way. I don't think so either. I don't think she looks that good naked. No, dude, you're getting confused because a stand-in is someone that they have working there on the set that stands or, you know, takes the position of the actor while they get the lighting all set. A body double is somebody who takes the place of the actor during the scene. Yeah, but they wouldn't write body double even if it was because they wouldn't want to screw with them. And they usually don't credit the body double. Yeah, they want everyone to think that was Ellen's boob. That was like a stunt boob. Stunt boob. Stunt boob for Ellen DeGeneres, I believe. Stunt boob played by Buddy Joe Hooker. Remember him? He was the stunt man like everything. Like in Smokey and the Bandit. Smokey and the Bandit. Stunt man. Buddy Joe Hooker. All right, listen, guys. Thanks a lot. Syndication now and forever. Thank you, Mike. Take it easy. All right, we've got to take a quick break, Anthony. We're just getting started here today, of course. We've got a couple new entries for the most offensive song. And I don't even know if we can play them on the radio. Why? They're that bad? There's a couple really bad ones, man. I heard the one. I'm not even going to say the title. We don't want to ruin it. What the hell is that doing on me again? The studio cam. We need broads to come down to the studio cam. Yeah, studio cams should be fun stuff. Not us. Just us. Who cares? All right, well, we do have a couple more entries into the most offensive song contest, Anthony. And they are definitely over the top. Just from the titles, I say contenders. They're very good. Definitely contenders. We're going to play those later on in the show. And a lot of people ask how they get their entry in for the most offensive song. Very, very easy. Get a song in to us. Less than three minutes would be appreciated. Make sure we can understand your lyrics. Write about whatever the hell you want. And send it in to WNEW. We have the address here if you want to call Spaz up. All right. Right. 2127571027. Quick break. We'll be back. Opie. You scum. And Anthony. Your new name is Dick. Opie and Anthony. What changed you into such demonic little bastards? 1027. Sickos. WNEW. You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now. Opie and Anthony Show. There it is. 1027. WNEW. That's my favorite sweeper by that guy. Opie and Anthony Show. Oh, God. That's like a guy that's just finally given up and realized that we're here to stay. Yeah, that's the guy that probably a year ago was hoping, you know, we'd get fired and he was all excited. Yeah, but it didn't happen. Now just like all the other critics out there, they're all giving up going, huh? They are going to stick around for a while. Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. How did it happen? They're supposed to be fired. I understand. All right, we're up to a year and nine months. Remember when everyone in this damn market said Opie and Anthony will last three months? Three months and then we're gone. Gone. See? And then they were convinced the old N.E.W. would stay forever and that the Opie and Anthony Show was a stupid, stupid experiment. Remember that, Ann? Yeah. Don't worry. Look, you'll be back to music and you two asses will be gone. You guys are being like Tulsa. All right. Well, we're still here. Oops. Oops. We pretty much outlasted everybody at this station. Sorry. We've been here the longest. You know that, right? Yeah, we're the veterans. There's only like two people on this floor that have been here longer than us. Who? Andrea. Yeah. Who does the music for the show. And Jimmy. Right. Who puts together our production and does a great job at that. They're the only two that have been here longer than us at this point. Wow. Cleaned house. Oh, and Earl. But Earl doesn't really work. Earl. We're talking about people that work. Earl. Yeah. So it continues. Now we have a bunch of new shows and fun stuff going on. Yup. And that ride out big. That's right. I hear Ron and Fez are talking about what we've been talking about. Yeah. I guess they're getting a few emails about Fez and his wacky voice. Yeah. You know, but people are tuning in, man. Yeah. I was listening. They were reading some email from listeners. I was listening. I was listening. I was listening. I was listening. I was listening. I was listening. They were reading some email from listeners. I was dying laughing last night, man. Ron is talking about some of the emails coming in about Fez's voice. And Fez is like, every time. What? Every Marjorie Garter they say the same questions. You're going to get a pump upside the head. I don't understand it. Then they read a letter from some guy that was calling him a fogget. Like he couldn't spell I guess. Calling him a fogget. Foggets? What's a fogget? I was dying though, really funny. Wait, there's a chick that used to work with Earl here at NEW. Christina! Hi. Is this the Christina? Were you here when we got hired? You might have been. I might, yeah. No. No. We've been here a year and nine months. Oh no. You used to work here at NEW. I worked there for about four years and Earl was there when I worked there. And what do you have to say? He was just, he didn't do anything then. I mean I loved him. I loved him. I loved him with all my heart. He was a great guy but he was you know, he was fat and patsy. Oh no. So Earl does a lot for this place. He used to walk around in all black with like pounds of stuff in his front pocket so they gorged out. He still does. And he was proud of being a virgin. He still is. He still is. We're trying to get a hooker to bang Earl. Oh it didn't work back then. I offered back then. Whoa! You offered to bang Earl? Yeah. Wait a minute. Why didn't he accept? Because I think he was too shy. I think Earl's gay. No. No. He used to leave the kiss on the lips all the time. Wait. Earl's on the line. Earl obviously taking time out of his busy work schedule to call our radio show. Hi Earl. Hello guys. He's so lazy he doesn't even walk down the hall. Wait Earl are you on the floor right now? He's like right down the hall? He's 40 feet away. This is how lazy the guy is. He doesn't even walk to the studio anymore to be on our show. He has to call it in. Oh Jesus. So now this girl offered to have sex with you Earl? Oh Christina? Yeah. She's married. Well I wasn't then. She wasn't at the time and she offered to have sex. What did Earl say? He said no. Why? Why? Because her fiance is a cop. Might have had something to say about it. I wasn't even engaged then. She wasn't engaged. Yes she was. No I wasn't. Oh my God Earl. Earl what is wrong with you? Well you used to kiss on the lips and stuff. What like make out kisses? Oh deep soft. You guys used to make out? No. Oh Earl. Oh my God. What is going on here? She gave great shoulder rubs. Oh Matt. Matt Savoti. Hi sweetie pie. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Matt Savoti. Hi sweetie pie. Hey Christina were you like the station whores? Yeah. Close to it. Close to it at least you're honest. You want your job back? No. I don't know if they paid me. Yeah we'll trade Earl for you. No way I wouldn't go back there if you paid me like a thousand dollars. No it's a lot different than it used to be believe me. No it's impossible. The place is better. Believe me you're hearing it from us. It's completely different. You hear the echoes down the hallway. No. No. Not anymore. Believe me we would agree with you and we did for about a year and a half. It's sad. I know we walked in here like that a couple of years ago and we were ready to shoot ourselves. It was depressing just walking the hallways but now there's the action. Yeah right. Things are happening. I was there when the rough Jim Buff was there, Ian O'Malley was there, Jim Monahan was there, Matt Savoti. It was like nonstop men. Wow more Johnson than you can handle I bet. It was awesome. It was great. How many did you have sex with here? You don't have to say who but how many? Sex? Yeah. Three. Three? Three of the people at N.E.W.? Yeah. How many? Well not being one of them. Oh not being one. And how many knobs did you hob? Oh geez. Two. Two. Wow. They all go back. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Earl, how big is her ass? Big booty? Baby got back? No, it wasn't that big. Don't diss me Earl. It wasn't that big. It wasn't that big! You've been black. Earl, black. Thank you. How big? Give me a height weight right now. Right now? Yeah. 55, 140. Right. And back then? 55, 125. I don't know. I like big fucking big fucks. I can't lie. I like big fucking big fucks. I can't lie. I can't lie. I can't lie. I can't lie. I don't know. I like big bucks in the king's life. I like big bucks in the king's life. So Earl, why wouldn't you do this? Why didn't you have sex with her? You're kissing her and stuff. Wow. I wasn't engaged then either, Earl. Why did you want Earl so bad? She was engaged. She was engaged in sex with everybody here at the station. Why the hell didn't you? I was very choosy. Sure you were. I was. Choosy? I was. No, bluesy. Bluezy. Maybe. I don't know about choosy. I was very choosy. You needed a penis. Very choosy. I held a mirror in front of the mouth. If it fogged, we would go into town. Oh my goodness. I was very choosy. You guys kill me. If you have a pulse, I'll do it. No, that's desperate. I don't resemble death. What, that's her? So where the hell did this come from? What is that? Where did this come from? It's a chick that just gave a hummer, and she's got that glazed donut look on her face. No, no, no. Oh my God. Wow. Be nice. It was taken right after the money shot. Yeah. Be nice. Exactly. All right. Looks like she has a runny nose. Yeah, she needs a night-quail. So when did you leave this fine establishment? I guess it was like 93 or 94. Yeah. Now why did you want Earl? We're shocked that anyone wants Earl. He wanted to cure his virginity. Kind of. That's what I'm guessing, right? Probably. Did you want that Louisiana black snake? No, we could never tell what he had. His pockets were always so full of garbage. You could never tell. That wasn't garbage, baby. Yeah. That was junk. Well, you checked out every guy's package here at N.E.W.? Well, yeah. Most of them wore really tight jeans. You know, Mally wore tight jeans. Saldaleo wore tight jeans. All right. Are these the guys she's had sex with? No, no, no, no. Okay. They just were all, you know. You want to fess up? Were they on air? Any of the guys you had sex with? No. No? All behind the scenes? Yeah. Oh, interesting. How'd you go for the banging? I just didn't. Oh, stop it. Come on. Why? Why not, Earl? She sounds like somebody who was, you know, it wasn't just a quick pick up off the street where you didn't know what you were getting. No, I didn't know what I was getting. A working relationship and she was offering. Hey, Earl, do you like man ass? Yeah, Earl, you've got to be honest. Do you like cranky man ass? Earl likes cranky ass after someone pops a nugget. This girl sounds like she'd be a lot of fun to bang. She had everything Earl wants except a penis. Did you used to have sex like on the job and stuff, Christina? No, no, not on the job, post job. Where did you have sex in this office? You tell us. You're not even in the same place. I know, but did you have sex in the boss's office, in the studio? No, no, no. You don't find that hard to believe. There was a meeting room. There was that lounge area. A meeting room? Oh, a meeting room. Earl, do you remember that? Earl, yeah, you remember that? Yeah. You remember that big room with all the couchsets and all. Do you remember where you didn't have sex with her? Well, what happened? In the old place there used to be two radio stations, AM and FM, and they would hold out and there was all this space in the back. All right. Can I, I've got to make an announcement about Earl. The truth is, Earl's a kid toucher. And, and she was, she was past puberty and Earl just isn't turned on by anything like hair. Let us get you a hooker. It is time. You have nasty things on your body like hair and breasts. Can we get you a hooker? Let us get you a hooker. You have nasty things on your body like hair and breasts. Can we get a girl to hob your knob today? It would make everyone happy around here. Let's get someone to hob your knob today. No one's going to come down and hob Earl's knob. Why not? Unless his name is Bill or Bob. All right, I have to go back to work. What? I have to go back to work. All right, Christina. All right. Bye, Earl. Bye, Christine. Bye, Matthew. She's got to get back to a penis, I guess. Oh! All right, Earl, she's gone. Was she the station slut? Give it to us. Give it to us. I'll be polite. Was she the station slut? Honestly, I don't know. Sounds like you're the only guy she didn't do. How long was she with this company? I think almost two years. You know, you hear things, but I don't believe them. Hey, Earl. Black Earl was interviewed on the unofficial website. I guess from time to time, Steven the Gang at www.foundyourmusic.com interviewed someone associated with the radio show, Anthony. This week, it's 13 questions with Black Earl. Well, I'm sorry. First of all, this chick with the facial picture, I can't stop looking at it. She looks like she's hammered off her guard. I swear she doesn't look of age. What was sent in to the chick? The radio chick show? Where's the radio chick? She didn't want to look at it. She didn't want to look at it? What's wrong with her? Get her down here. That's a perfect shot. Why are women sending us pictures like that? This was sent to the chick. Was she looking for pictures of... Her boyfriend sent a picture in. And the rest is history on the face. That's classic. It looks like she has a really bad runny nose. It looks like she got punched in the eye too, right before the... Maybe there was something... Check it out. Look at her eyes, dude. That's great. This girl's on smack. I don't know what she's on. She ain't on Earl. I think she got hit in the eye by the Loch Ness Monster. Steve and the gang from the unofficial Opium Anthony website. 13 questions with Black Earl. You can check out some of the questions for yourself. Should I just read the number 8? This is number 8. One of the questions they asked Black Earl and his answer for everyone to see on the unofficial Opium Anthony website. Question 8 reads, It sometimes seems as if the crew gives you a hard time. Do you think, if given the proper opportunity and motivation, that you could focus your nigger rage on one or several of them so as to tear their still beating hearts from their chest? If so, who would feel your wrath? Fair question. Fair. The answer? Wait a minute. I didn't change my answer. Hey, I didn't change your answer. Why would they do that, Earl? Nigger rage. Are you kidding? If anyone has a right to be filled with rage, it's the guys I work with every day. Do you have any idea how much crap I get away with daily? I arrive late on a regular basis and blame it on the train. I make personal phone calls all day. I wander the hallways while scratching my head and bother other people at their desks. I hang around the studio trying to get on everyone's show. And I call all the record and book companies requesting tons of free product under the ruse that I'm somebody important here. Wait! I did not write that! Oh my God. It's in an interview. It's got to be true. I did not write that. Okay, terrific. No, I did not. No, I did not. I'm now upset. I did not write that. Uh-oh. Is there any other questions you want me to read? Earl, I'm just reading what's on your website. I didn't write that. No, I did not. I swear to God, I'm going to hit somebody. I do Psycho Mark with right out of the studio. That's a good one. That's pretty funny. Are there any others worth reading here? Number which one? Okay. Oh, Jesus. Palomino. All right. This one's good? Wow, man. Which will go down in your memories as a Fonda radio experience, working with Opie and Anthony or with Scott Muni? Because, Earl, it did work for Scott Muni for many years. I would say it's got to be Scott. And before I read this answer, I have no clue what it's going to say. I do have to say we really like Scott. Tough question, Earl writes. It's really hard to compare the two shows. Working for Scott was a blast. He taught me a lot, not only about radio, but about life. Opie and Anthony really taught me how to lighten up and that radio should be fun. How many people can say that they've worked with Scott Muni and Opie and Anthony? I'm a very lucky guy. Wow. Did you write that one, Earl? Yes, I did. Okay. If you wrote that one, you must have wrote the other one. No, I didn't. Oh, man. I swear to God, I didn't write the other one. All right. Well, very good. If you want to read the rest of the questions from the Black Earl interview, it's on the FoundryMusic.com website. I guess it's my time to share. Insightful. Insightful, concise interviews. And Earl, I appreciate you walking down the hall. That was very nice. Thank you. Instead of calling us on the phone. It's my turn to barrel. I love this phoning in his moment. Hey, Kevin, what's up? Hey, what's going on, Opie and Anthony? Talking to Earl. What's up with you? Earl is totally gay, man. Yeah? Why? Totally. Because why wouldn't you bang her? Yeah, why wouldn't you? Because she's a virgin. Why wouldn't you bang her? It sounds like she really likes to give, you know, the... She's a virgin. She's a virgin. She's a virgin. She's a virgin. She's a virgin. She's a virgin. Why didn't you bang her? It sounds like she really likes to give, you know, the oral and stuff, and she did everyone else. Why not you, Earl? You don't have a commitment, nothing. Why didn't you bang her? I guess, I mean, she was... She was... She was... She was... She was... She was... She was... She was... She was... She was... No, she was... Was she attractive? Very attractive. Damn, you gotta go there, man. I was good friends with her, I believe, her still husband. Oh, is she the girl that came by, like, recently that you introduced me to? No. It's not the same one? No. Not the same Christine? No. Earl has a lot of girls that hang around him, but none of them bang him. Could we get you a banging, Earl? Yeah. Could we get you a girl to hob your knob? Yes or no? Scott's up. Yeah. Yeah, what's up? I just wanted to say that I don't believe that Earl is gay. One day, Earl and I were sniffing the seat in which John Lennon sat in, and I attempted to reach around and give him a dirty stint. He wouldn't allow me to do so. Oh, cut it out. But... Earl, did you bang Scott so? No, I didn't. No, no, no. I have a message from a friend of yours, Ope. Yeah. He says to say to you, hiya, dopey. What? It's the hiya, dopey guy. Oh, all right. All right, Earl. He actually loves the show. Oh my God. This is a line time with a gun, I guess. Doug in line eight has something to say to you. Doug, what's going on? What's going on, guys? How are you? What's going on with this guy? He's a fruit puppet. Fruit puppet. He could get laid in a woman's prison with a handful of pardons. What's the matter with you? You had a girl coming on to you and you don't want to give them that Louisiana black snake. Yeah, it sounds like the girl was wild, too, Earl. I think you have to go for that one. Yeah. What's the matter with you with that Louisiana black snake? Hey, I got a good idea. I heard you don't know how to hang pictures. You know where you can learn how to hang pictures? Well, I think they have a good place for you to go hang things. They have a clue-clux claim. They'll teach you how to hang things. Oh, come on. That old gag. John, what's going on? Nothing much. Hey. I think I know why you're old at the playbiller. Why? Well, he's saying her boyfriend was going to get pissed. Right. I think his boyfriend was going to be more pissed. That's pretty good. Very good, John. Thanks. You guys go. All right, man. Out. All right. Earl, you're getting a bad rap here, man. Well, Earl, I'm sure you have a... My time in the gun. I'm sure you have a very busy day planned. Probably have a lot of things to do before 5 o'clock. What are you going to do now? Going down the hall, what can we expect from Earl today? Well, I'm going to write the public file. Okay, very good. Write like W-R-I-T-E or write it R-I-G-H-T. Which thing? I'm going to write it. Write the public file. Okay, write it. All right. The public file. What's that? I don't know. Every station is required to have a public file. Right. I'm ready. Writing? All right, Earl, thank you. Punching up any porn on the computers or anything? No? No? No? Is that true that that happened? I heard some stories. Mark Bookmark, the freaking gay porno side of it. Uh, Earl, I wasn't even going to say that. No, no, no. One time I came... I'm walking to work, I found one on my computer, there's a gay porn side of it. Oh, what a coincidence. It was Ariana, who he talked to. I just happened to be flipping through and it was just there. Did you get in trouble once, Earl, for... having porno on your computer? They asked me about it and I said, I had no idea. I swear to God. I heard this story that like... You're like, I had porn. I'm like... Wait, what's the story? It's news to me. That like his computer was loaded up with porno. First thing in the morning... And you're in. What happened? And... Who does the computer? Ria. Tells us not to shut off the computers. I left mine on. I come in the next morning and I think it was Matt. He's like, are you leaving porn on the computer? And I'm like, no. He goes, well, we came in and there's a whole thing on the screen. You know, like news to me. I heard like the hard drive was tagged. With like porno. Oh my God, you've got to delete those files, people. That's classic. And then they gave you like some type of warning or something? I told the truth. I went, I know nothing of that. And they just said keep the porno off the company computers. It's just like, I'm not, I'll keep it on because I don't put it on. Oh sure. Okay. We believe you. All right. All right. Well, we got to take a break, Anthony. Okay. We're all going to go back and look at Earl's computer for some porno. I heard there's some kiddie porno on there too. Oh my God. We should get a list of all the websites that Earl's been to lately. That could be pretty fun. Hey! Gary Pooter in the studio. All right. Okay. Let's take a break, Anthony. And we'll be back. Stay there. Opie. Keep your hands away from your pants. Ah, too late. And Anthony. I'm just a flaming fan. More stupidity on the way. 1027-HWNW. Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.

Anthony, lots of instant feedback coming in about our buddy, our pal, Black Earl. Yeah, Richie from Westchester. The reason Earl wears black all the time is because he is in constant warning of his dead penis. Oh, that's pretty funny. Frank from Manhattan writes, because we were talking to that girl that wanted to bang Earl when she used to work here and Earl liked the Niner. Frank writes from Manhattan, if she wears a strap on, would Earl bang her? And Rob from Jersey, okay guys, get off Earl. Scott Muney just did. Oh! That's very funny. Couple more coming in here. Michelle writes, why is Earl still a virgin? I looked him up on the studio cam and he's not that bad. He has to be gay. Wow, look at that. Rich from Jersey, is there any truth to the rumor that Earl and Spaz are doing a man-man porno called Bungle Fever? Bungle Fever. Ouch, babe. Speaking of Bungle Fever, Anthony. I don't know, what do you want to do? We have a bunch of people sending in songs for the most offensive song ever. Yes. We are looking for the most offensive song ever written. And the entries are really getting out there. Really bad. There's one we're going to play later that's going to outrage a ton of people, I believe. I think both of them that came in, that we're probably going to play today. We're going to play two today. They're very offensive. I don't know. And will upset a lot of people. This next song will upset a lot of people. But we are trying to find the most offensive song. So how do we handle this, Anthony? How do we handle it? I think that's how we handle it. The topic is write the most offensive song and send it into the show. We'll play it. We say beforehand, the views expressed in these songs are not necessarily those of Opie and Anthony's show or WNEW Radio. That's the first time we ever said that. That's how bad these songs are though. But god damn, they're funny. That's the whole goal of this thing. Is send in the most offensive song. So obviously you have to top the last one. Wait, I'm trying to listen to you, but through the reflection behind you, I can see the picture is up on your board there of the girl that just got the facial. I put her up on my board here with all the show ideas and whatnot that we have to do today. You're getting inspiration or something over there? There's a picture of a girl that looks like she has a really bad runny nose. But it's a picture taken right after the money shot. It kind of looks like she got too close to the hose when someone turned it on. It looks like somebody... You know what it looks like? It looks like she was dipping into the strutalizing before it got put on the case. Yeah, it sure does, man. Anyway. Oh my god. That's a great shot. We should put that picture up on the unofficial website. Make captions. The eye hand shot on the one side is great. God, I love it. Hold it in front of the instant feedback. In front of the camera. Is the studio cam even working today? I heard it was. All right, hold on. We'll try to put the picture up on the studio cam. Let me get... And then you guys could like... Yeah, take a look at it. Wait, you got to go back further, Rick. Then you won't be able to see the sploog though. You can't say that word. I think people know what we're talking... You can't really see it. No, I don't think so. It's going to be set up somewhere so it's just there on camera. All right, don't move. Let's see that. That might work. See, you're in... It's a contrast problem. Yeah, it's not going to happen, but you guys get the idea. Try one more here. Try that. Studio cam, you could go to www.com. We're really not doing much with it yet, but eventually it'll be a very important part of our radio show. You can't really see... You can almost see a little on her cheek. You can't get the full impact of how much... How much friggin'... All right, try that. That might work right there. Just imagine what's all over... Okay. All right, let's see if that works. Yeah, well, on the... On the lip. Let's see if anyone is commenting about that. I'm trying to see. It's a little out of focus too, but that's the problem now. It's just not focused. That's what it is. Yeah, a bunch of people saying they can't see it. All right. We tried. Well, maybe we'll... All right. ...on the website with that little black bar over the eyes. Right. That tells... Whenever I see that, I know I'm looking at some real good pornos when they have to blank the eyes out with that black bar. Yeah. All right, Ant, do you want to play one of the entries to the most offensive song contest? Well, what are we going to do? We announce a little contest and what? We're not going to do it? All right, we can't be pussies. We've got to play all the entries that we think are interesting. Like I said before, that's the object of this contest, the most offensive song. We're not playing it and saying that it's a great tune. Let's play this and have fun with it. Well, no, we are. And who sent this one in, Rick? He goes by the name Fuel. Fuel. Fuel sent it in. All right. This is Fuel's entry into the Open Anthony most offensive song contest, Anthony. All right, hold on to your hats. 1, 2, 3, 4. How much is that dark in the window? Please say that dark is for sale. How much is that dark in the window? Don't make me pay extra for the mail. I must take a trip to California. I need someone to home along. If I die that darky on a long train, He can get the job done while I'm gone. How much is that dark in the window? For the one with the long dangly arms. How much is that dark in the window? I've got things neat pickin' on my farm. I have a wife who needs a meetin'. But I can't afford to go to jail. If I make my darky do it for me, I can't give what's comin' that well. How much is that dark in the window? My team could use a G&H. Please say that dark, he don't do cocaine. I can't afford to rehab his whole race. How much is that dark in the window? Please say that dark is for sale. How much is that dark in the window? Don't make me pay extra, cause he's now. I apologize. Alright, that's Fuel. The latest entry in the most offensive song ever ever ever contest that we're having. Ever written. Opian Anthony Show. Again, let me reiterate. The opinions expressed in these songs are not necessarily the opinions of the Opian Anthony Show or WNEW. Well, the feedback's coming in nice and strong now, Anthony. Alright. Rock from Woodside on the Insta Feedback. Fuel, not as good as the first song we played. What song was that? We want you guys to keep track of all the songs we play. The most offensive song ever. Oh yeah, that was the one to the Barry Manilow song. That's right. So already a lot of people think this isn't as good as the first one we played. Musically, his guitar playing is a little lacking. His singing a little droning. But, boy, lyrically it truly is offensive. Fuel did give us another entry. You did? Play later on in the show, which is a little better than that one. Jay, what's going on? Hey guys, I'm offended and I'm white. You are offended and you're white. Ring the goddamn gong for that one. It's a trick. Well, we didn't warn you guys ahead of time. That's the danger of doing a contest like this, you know? It's not bad though. It's pretty good. Alright, Jay. Thank you. Bye. Let's go to Conrad. Conrad, what's going on? Yo, O&A. Yeah. Dude, I'm driving through Newark and Maplewood right now with the windows down and that song playing. You've got to see the looks I'm getting. Yeah, you've got to watch where you play that one. Oh my God. I forgot it was one of those days where you do want your windows down, the top down, your crank and the stereo, and that's coming out of your speakers. Yeah. That can't be a good thing. Jesus Christ. Alright. I've got to get out of here. Alright, Conrad. Thank you. Alright. Alright. Nick, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you, Nick? You should have had the inappropriate bell on cruise control for that one. We warned you. I didn't really want to play that song, but I don't know what else to do. If we're going to have a most offensive song contest. Yeah, we've got to play them. We've got to play all the entries. That's why I love you guys. Alright, thanks, Nick. Later. Bye. Let's go to Scott. Scott, what's going on? Oh, we lost Scott. He was scared, actually. He goes, I am scared that I just listened to that song. Tim, what's up? You're next on NAW. Hey, guys. What's up? Hey. That one sucked compared to the Barry Manilow version. Yeah, it seems like the Barry Manilow song is still in the lead as we try to find the most offensive song ever. This one was like two repetitions over and over. Yeah, yeah. Darkie the Wind-Dyed. That kind of sucked. Yeah, he's got a point. I agree with him. After the third chorus of that you hear, you're a little tired of it. Yeah, it kind of... Shock values. On and on and on. Alright, thank you. Okay, one more thing. You teach me how to make banana nut bread, you home-made faggot. Over and out, Doug. Get out of here. Instant feedback coming in about the song. Anthony, Bill from the City. I bet that tune would make the top ten list in Memphis. Oh, probably would. Shonee from New York. I just broke my inappropriate bell. John from the Island. That belongs on MTV's TRL. It was a hit. Oh, Jesus. The NAAACP checking in from Jersey. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Okay, terrific. Very inappropriate. Let's go to Matt. Matt, you're next on N.E.W. Okay, terrific. That was one of the best things you guys have ever played. I think the first one was better, though, but that was definitely a good catchy tune. Yeah, we have to decide which one's in the lead. You're thinking the Barry Manilow song? Yeah, I'd say Barry Manilow was better, but this one had a better guitar going. Yeah, we want you guys to pay attention to all the songs we play. We do have another entry later on today. Oh, great. What time? Alright, I don't know. Alright, cool. I'll be listening all day anyway. Alright, cool. See you guys. Bye. Later. Awful. Horrendously awful. Well, that's the object of the contest. I mean, what are we going to say, right? Right. Right. Seth, what's going on? Yo, what's up? Hey. Ah, this is what happened. I was listening to the song. Yeah. And I got to a gas station to grab a pack of cigarettes. Yeah. I opened the windows open and I had the thing blasted. And there was a black lady right next to me in a car with her kids. And she was getting her kid out of the car to get something to smoke. She started flipping out on me. How can I listen to that kind of stuff? What's wrong with me? Going nuts. Wow. Crazy stuff. Crazy stuff. Is it as good as the first song? I think it's better. Alright. I think it's much better. Thank you, bro. Thanks a lot. We got the guy that wrote the song on Live 4 here. Jeff, what's up? Hey, how you doing? Good. Hello. Hey. What's up, Jeff? Nothing. You were the guy that wrote that song, huh? Yeah. We wrote it yesterday. Well, you're getting mixed reviews on your song. Yeah. You know, I know it drones a little bit. What are you going to do? At two minutes I was like, it's done, but whatever. Yeah. Put it in. Alright. We're going to play your other entry a little later on in the show. I think that one's worse. What? The one we just played? No, I think the second one's worse. Yeah, I believe so. I think that one's more offensive. Alright, man. Alright. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you. Well, Ant, there you have it. The latest entry in the worst song ever written. Not bad. By Fuel. It's a contender, but I don't know if it'll hold up. Jeff, AKA Fuel. Very good. Alright, man. We got to take a break. We'll be back. Stay there. Obey and Anthony. Fun, ladies and gentlemen. You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. Go take a mitle. Diarrhea, wave, hit prisons, supper blade. In Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican prison. Jamaican prison. That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh? All the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper. A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than a thousand convicts suffering. Doctors are struggling frantically to contain the outbreak which inmates have blamed on their Sunday supper. The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering. Spicy crab soup. Spicy crab soup. Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage. Rice, peas and chicken. No, no, they didn't have the rice, peas and chicken. Sunday meal of rice, peas and chicken. Obey, you're getting the story wrong. I preach a cut. Oh, they should have got the rice, peas and chicken, but instead they got the spicy crab soup and the Chinese cabbage. Cabbage and some kind of vegetable taro. Whatever that is. And diarrhea. Cha cha cha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Angry prisoners on Monday dump scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the cell blocks in protest. That's great. So they have the bad supper. Everyone has diarrhea. Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags. You know what's great? You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys. What do they do? They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages. Correct. Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons. No. Oh my God, throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea. That's great. Now the treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells for medication fearing attacks from other inmates. A special security team was going to cells to give inmates on the spot treatment if needed. This medical team had to go from cell to cell to give them treatment as there's diarrhea all over their cells. I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked and ran away. That old gag. All right, so they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the episode. There you have it. A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica suffering from diarrhea, Anthony. Diarrhea. Diarrhea. After a bad Sunday supper. All right. We're clapping. Clapping all over you. Hey. We're clapping. My pants are all full of jewelry. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. We're clapping. And I hope this time is gonna last. Hey! No bullet can stop us now. We're in the bed so we won't fight. Either can be fought now or so. Hey! Hey! Okay, terrific. Bisous mom!!! Aww. In Jamaica! I like the new Fatboy Slim. Yeah, we're doing ONA pictures on the show every day. An outbreak of diarrhea. Taste of Jamaican. Okay, terrific. Yeah. It must not be very... You know how it sucks when you have diarrhea anyway. And you're in the best of conditions. Imagine that, a Jamaican prison. You're losing it. David, what's up, man? Yo, ONA, how you doing, guys? Good, what's up, David? Yeah, I gotta figure it out. I know what happened in Jamaica. The wooden was at the bottom of it. He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there. Hey! That would definitely put a damper on it. Hey!

What are some of the good teams? What would you say? Notre Dame. Okay. Actually, it's not really. Really? A lot of the powerhouses aren't that great this year, like North Carolina. There's no standalone kick-ass one. Is UConn good? UConn is ranked 22nd in the nation right now. What about Boston? Boston? No, Boston doesn't have any really good teams in the 20 this year.

We're going to be on the line. We're going to be on the line. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. Moving right along today. Our phone line, 212757, 1027. The fax line, 2129579639. Give us a call if you want in on the show today. Coming up at 430, Lewis Black. Yeah. Always a pleasure to have him in the studio. We love when Lewis Black stops by the studio. He loves talking about current events and things like that. Things going on. Stuff that he finds funny in the news, Anthony. Yes. You know? He's probably got a lot of talk about what's happening in politics. I guess McCain bowed out today. Yeah, that's it. Bradley bowed out. We kind of knew a while ago that it was going to be Bush and Gore. Yeah. Going for all the marbles. And I just have a feeling George W. Bush is going to be our next president. You really think George W.? Just like daddy. Get in there. President. I don't know. I think so. But Gore's going to have to... First of all, he's got that whole image problem of being a stick figure. And then he's got the Clinton thing. Yeah. You know? He was vice president of a president that was in there for two terms. I don't think I ever saw them in the same room together, to tell you the truth. And he had no clue what was going on. You know, he didn't know what his president was doing. He knew exactly what was going on. And I just think that sucks. I mean, he was going for the primary and stuff. You would think Clinton would help him out. But how many times have you seen Clinton on the tube endorsing Gore for the nomination? The answer would be zero. None. You don't say. They're keeping him apart. And if I was Gore, I'd be so pissed at Clinton. Like, hey, you got eight years as president. I hope you're happy because you really screwed my chances. You jackass. Yeah. Not that Gore has much of a chance. I don't know. Because people that voted on party lines, he'll get all those votes because he's a Democrat. But I don't know. He doesn't have any charisma. He doesn't have, not that Bush does, but he's got to shake the image of being a nothing piece of wood. The one thing you got to worry about, Anthony, McCain, if he runs as an independent, it's going to screw up the whole election. Right. The parole factor. And I think McCain is so pissed off at the tactics that Bush used with the negative campaigning and stuff, he might want to just shove it up his, you know what? I don't know. That always wrecks the voting. Yeah. When you have kind of technically two Republicans on the ticket. Splits it up. Splits it up bad. That's what happened. Perot took a lot of votes away from Bush and Clinton won. We'll see what happens. All right. There's your political break. There you go. Political commentary from Opie and Anthony. I personally don't even care who our next president is. Yeah, I don't care either. Because nothing really changes for me. Oh, they all have great big ideas, Anthony. They all want to, you know, as they campaign, they tell you everything they're going to change. They want to read or it's going to be. They all want to reduce taxes. They all want, you know, health insurance for everybody. Right. Nothing changes. No. We just chug along. Just chug along. The economy goes up. It goes down. Things happen. It's on autopilot. Speaking of, Dow making a great recovery today. 154. Really? Close. NASDAQ huge with 150 points on the upside. Very nice. Very good. Travis. Yeah. What's up, Travis? You know, I swear to God, I was on the bus yesterday. This is a really scary thing. There's black girls talking about the election. Right. And they believe that George Bush Sr. is running. They're like, oh, he running again. Scary thought. No, he running again. That's true. That's not a joke. They did a poll and up until two weeks ago, everyone thought it was his father running for president again. A lot of people still think it's George Bush running again. That's freaking scary. And these people going to decide who our next president is going to be? I don't know. I don't know. George W. should be running for president of Quick Records. All right, Travis, thank you. All right. Bye. Let's go to Rocko. Rocko, you're next on N-E-W. Just take a step back for a sec, guys. We were talking about how many times Bill Clinton has actually went and stumped Al Gore. Yes. You think it carries any weight? I don't think so. I think that was part of the strategy, was to keep Bill Clinton and Al Gore separate, so we have a fighting chain. Oh, yeah, that's what we were talking about. We understand all that, but if Al Gore sat around and knew exactly what Clinton was up to and didn't speak, I don't want that guy as my next president. But then you've got to think of the flip side of that. If it comes out and says Bill Clinton is out banging everything that moves, you think the Democrats are going to look to him to carry the party in 2000. It just shows you what a lunatic Clinton is and what everybody thinks of him, because if you have a two-term president and an incumbent vice president running for the presidency, you have the two-term president just pushing this guy every second. Yeah, under normal circumstances. He was president for two terms. Yeah, under normal circumstances. You know, you're dealing with some hillbilly guy from Arkansas that's just probably... I'm amazed. I'd have a lot more respect for Al Gore if he opened his big trap. When the whole Clinton thing was going down, Al Gore was in Hawaii. They got him on the exact opposite part of the globe. Well, what's a safe place to be? And I don't think to this day he's... Well, yeah, he started talking bad about the president and his actions finally. Yeah. Long after it meant anything, you know? I just would have a lot more respect for the guy if he spoke up. You know, then it's party suicide. There you go. That sounds good on politics, though. So who are you voting for? Me? George... Uh, nobody. Yeah. I mean, I'll do George W. I voted for his father. I usually, you know... I don't vote strictly party line. George W. In this case, he happens to be the better of the two. W. George W. Got it. Got it. Who are the hot chicks standing behind George W.? That's his daughters, right? Is it? Someone's daughter. That's what we need. More hotties in the White House, man. Come on, bring them on. Screw this Chelsea. Get Chelsea out of there. Finish. It took eight years and she still, you know, doesn't look that great. Chelsea's... now she... You know something, let me tell you. She's turned around, I understand. No, no. Now she's turning again, though. Oh, really? She went through that phase where she looked like a chicken. A chicken with a fright wig on. You know what? Then she went... She's pretty at that hair, though. Yeah, well, then she went through a phase where she started in college and it was almost acceptable. Like, you're looking and going, all right, you know, there's something going on there. Now it's her mother with her finger stuck in a light socket. That's what she looks like now. She's starting to really look like Hillary. I saw a picture in the paper of her and I thought it was Hillary for a second. Get a penis and blanket now. All right, Rocco. But a couple of hotsters in the White House like that? It's going to be... Bush. It doesn't matter. Yep. There's a Bush in the White House now. Bush in the White House. There's going to be a Bush in the White House now. Real Bush instead of that Barbara Bush. God bless America. All right, thank you, Rocco. Thank you, guys. That's what we need. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I think it's going to be a tough one. I'm for capital punishment too. Yeah, and he's frying them like crazy down there in Texas. Yeah, absolutely. Even though they took that form of the death penalty away from us, unfortunately. Women, children. So listen, I'm a full supporter of that, however, and we all know Clinton's an idiot, and we all know why Clinton and Gore have been separated with Gore running here. But the fact is, if you look at Bush, the guy's out of his mind. It's everything you don't know about Bush, and that's not talked about. Like what? It makes me nervous. I know supporters of your show. These guys out there, everybody that supports your show, they're pro-choice. Bush isn't pro-choice. Let me ask you something. Wait a minute. I hate when they use that as an issue. The pro-choice issue. Listen to me on the pro-choice issue. How many Republicans have been in office since Roe vs. Wade? I have no idea. A hell of a lot. And you know what? The women's right to have an abortion has not been taken away. It is not an issue. It isn't. No, it isn't. Holy mother of pearl. So you're going to sacrifice everything that is an issue in a presidential race just because a guy is against a woman's right to have an abortion. Come on, man. Bush? You want to vote for Bush? The guy is everything you don't know about Bush. It makes everyone nervous. All I'm saying is they're not going to overturn Roe vs. Wade because the Republican is in office. Reagan was in there eight years. Bush was in there four years. Reagan was an effing moron. Listen to me. That's 12 years of a Republican in a row in there and they didn't take it away. Ten years of really right Republican. You know what's got to be done here is Radley needs to run as an independent and we need to vote. Who cares how that guy dresses? Go hug a tree, my friend. Go get on one of those zodiac boats with Greenpeace. Save a whale. It doesn't matter. Believe me, I am the most pro-choice person on the face of the earth. I think women should be able to walk down the street and pull their god damn uterus out on Broadway. I don't care. Believe me. But a Republican president has nothing to do. Nothing to do with pro-choice. Don't worry about it. There's other issues. All right? I don't agree, but hey, what are you going to do? Listen, big fan, guys. Thank you. That's people trying to scare you into voting one way or the other. Are you really into the Bush thing or what? No, I'm really not into the Bush thing. I'm not into you, the guy, really. I don't think the Gore thing is... I don't see that happening. I think Bush will get in there and that's it. It'll be business as usual. Business as usual. Doesn't matter. He's going to say he's going to try to reduce taxes. Oh, yes. They all do. Yeah. He's in the White House. That's all I care about. Just keep the economy strong. That's all we care about. Webcam in the kids' room. Come on. Come on. All right. Well, I don't know. I mean, the whole political discussion gets boring fast, right? Well, it all depends on the spin you put on it. And we do have Lewis Black coming in soon. Yeah, he'll give a great spin on that in about 15 minutes. He'll be here. Lewis Black from Comedy Central. On the line, Smelly Karen. Well, that's the only way to describe you, Karen. That's enough. Hey. All right. We're not going to abuse you. You know, I went to the studio board and I'm getting pounded by the descriptions of the show. I even... Hold on. Hold on. We'll get to you in a sec. All right. Scott says we don't know anything about politics. Scott. It's very true. How are you doing, guys? All right. Now, explain your side and then we will counter. Okay. Well, first of all... Hold on. All right. Hold on. Let's do it now without cursing. Okay. He's given an S about abortion. Okay. Bush tried to have it overturned. And many Republicans in states are trying to have it overturned. And have been for quite a few years. And in many states, not this one, have been very successful. That's what you failed to see. Oh, please. That is not... that isn't true. It's very true. You know that right-wing campaign has been on for at least 10 years, forcing the medical schools to stop teaching how to do abortions. Oh, please. You know something? It's this propaganda on both sides. The fact that... There is propaganda on both sides. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I agree with you. But... And the fact of the matter is... It is an important issue. It is a law that has been passed. And that's it. Okay, well, what about Supreme Court justices? Yeah. Next round, it gets the point. At least three, if not four. And that's enough to overturn Roe v. Wade. I severely doubt it. I severely doubt it, too. It would be an enormous civil war. I think hinging your choice on pro- or choice or pro-life as far as voting for president goes is really silly. That's like a... It might seem so, being that you're a guy. That's like... If you're not a woman... No, I'm saying... It's a little bit of a different story, don't you think? No, it's like deciding what restaurant you're going to eat at based on what color the napkins are on the table. That's what I'm talking about. It is. Do you think that's how important abortion is to a woman? No, I'm saying it's very important to a woman. It's not an issue. It won't matter one way or the other. It hasn't for years. That's what I'm saying. Yes, it is an important issue. Is it an important issue in a presidential election? It shouldn't be. It doesn't matter. I agree with you that it shouldn't be in an ideal world, but it is. I mean, you guys are here. You were in Boston before that. You know, you've got to go out to some of the rural areas. It's a much different story. Every church you pass has enormous fields of crosses for the unborn. I know. It's been happening for years. Don't you hear what I'm saying? It doesn't matter who's in office. There have been years of Republicans in office. It doesn't matter. Don't you think that every single appointee that Reagan and Bush made to the Supreme Court was scrutinized over this question? Yeah. And why were they picked? They were picked because they were pro-life. Oh, not necessarily. And that's why so many, especially under Bush, didn't get in. Yeah, see, it's not like they all of a sudden decide who's going to get in and they get in, Supreme Court justices. They have to run through the gauntlet on both sides. If someone is totally pro-life, they're not going to have an easy time to get in just because George W. Bush is president. What depends who controls Congress? If you have a Republican Congress and you have a Republican president. Can I play ping pong, please? We're having a debate. I feel like I'm in French history class. All I'm saying is after years of Republicans being in office through the 70s, it's not an issue. Okay? All right. Well, besides Bush, Bush is a moron. Is that not an important issue? All right. I think they're all morons. Thank you, Scott. All right. Bye. Bye, guys. Oh, my God. They're all morons. You guys really want us to play this song? People are going to freaking lose their minds. Which one's this? Another entry into the most offensive song ever, Antidote. Very appropriate. I don't know. We weren't even going to play this one today, but we are talking about abortion.

You want to hear it? Yeah. Well, like I said, it's a contest for the most offensive song ever on the Opie and Anthony show. It's not like we agree with these songs. They're supposed to be offensive. All right. With that, here it is. All right. I can't be a dad. You bitch I've been had. Punch your stomach. Tried pliers, they got stuck. You're getting rots. Oh, stop your crying. I think I want the fetus. Want to kill the fetus? Just once. I can't get out of their cunts. Holy cow. Watch that gap. I love it. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Wow. Turn it off. Wow.

What are you nuts? You can't smoke. Boy, that has got to be the lead. That's in the lead. All right. Listen, we got to take a break. We're going to have to do some stuff to top that one.

Twenty girls want to bang me. hommes et femmes No, they don't. 1027, ن esp brackّ Wow. Alright, we're back at theО paz distributed-interchange show. Hey, man, call a line, 212-757-1027. People are just losing our minds wives from Queens. Stop the contest for the song, Wins. Hands down. Yeah, that... my God, man. Brutal! Just some of the instant feedback coming in. Joe from Holbrook, by far the winner. The funniest thing I've ever heard. Play it again. Play it again, huh? Mike from Jersey, you just got yourself a winner. Ellen from New City, ding ding ding. Fong, are you... what? Cracked? Fong, are you on crack, I guess. Tim from Jersey, you guys should ring the inappropriate bell non-stop from 6 to 7 to make up for that one. Syndication out. Ding ding ding, we have a winner. That's D from Jersey. Jesse from New York, hey, own a... holy crap, I've never... I've never heard something so psychotic in my whole life. Only a true sicko could think of something so insane. Billy Bob from Jersey, that song was funny as hell, I think it should win. I'm sitting here pissing my pants. Joe Soprano from FoundryMusic.com, I think Billy got the idea for that song during his colonoscopy. I like to forget the inappropriate bell, you need the Liberty Bell. Liberty Bell. Well, let's go to the phones here. Keith, what's going on? Hey, that song was great, man. I don't know if it was great. I was laughing so hard I turned my computer off by accident. I mean, if we're looking for the most offensive song, I do believe we have a leader in the contest. That was definitely better than the first one you played today. Well, we have another one to play and I don't even think it's going to come close to what we just heard. You know, you got to play them. It was great. Because honestly, that song has been on our desk for the last couple of days. And I was like, I don't even know if we can freaking play this damn thing. There were a couple of bleeps out. A couple of bleeps? You guys only heard half the song. They were dumping out of it like crazy. I could hear the dumps on the air. Yeah, we had to put another bleep in. It was so funny. We got to play it in its entirety at some point. But somebody here, Chris, on Instinct, saying, guys, the Airsic song was more offensive, but the Barry Manilow parody was, to me, funnier. Now, let me tell you, it doesn't matter. We are looking for offensive. The most offensive song. Not funny. Well, it's up to you guys to decide. I mean, is the one from Airsic in the lead, as far as most offensive goes? Anthony on Instinct Feedback just saying, holy ass winner. Well, we'll see. It just puts the bar up that much higher. I don't know if I could be part of this contest anymore. Where did you grow a vagina? Dude, did you hear the lyrics to that song? Yeah. Did you hear what I heard? I am putting it in the context of what it is. The most offensive song. I think they did a fine job at writing a very offensive tune. We had that on our desk for a while. We weren't really sure what to do with it. Then the whole abortion issue came up, and then Rick runs it in here. Well, the pliers thing was pretty much... Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Alright, alright, alright. Call it out. Alright, syndication now, guys. Cool. Thank you. Let's go to Eric. Eric, you're next on WNAW. Hey, ONA. I'll tell you what. You have a vagina. That thing was... that was hard. Yeah, that was wrong. That was absolutely wrong. And I gotta tell you, if you got anything in the coffins back there that's worse than that, I don't know if I can handle it. I get into an accident now every five minutes. The scary part about this contest is... now we raised the bar. I can only imagine what's going to come in next. You know, people are going to go out of their minds trying to do worse than that now. Anything else is going to sound tame at this point. Yeah. Oh, by the way, Anthony. Yes? President Clinton is amazed at a screensaver. Yesterday he just found out Air Force One is not a 2-2 trainer. Hey, ONA, syndication now. Take it easy, guys. Alright, alright. Thanks, man. Yeah, we do have one more song to play. One more entry into the contest. We're not going to... I'm not going to give the title out yet. We have a lady on the line. I was waiting for this. Jeannie. Hi, it's Janine. Janine, I'm sorry. Hello. How are you? Five months... you're five months pregnant, huh? Yes, I am. And that song made me absolutely sick to my stomach. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Opie, you should have went with your instincts and not played it. Well, it's the most offensive song contest. What is it supposed to do? It's too offensive for the most offensive contest? Yeah, actually, I think that kind of crossed the line. No, but that's just it. And it's not the Opie Show. You know what I'm saying? We all have a vote in this, and I'll tell you. I was definitely on the fence with that song. I can't lie. I can't lie. And I'm the one that usually says the sickest crap on this radio show. I know. I'm very surprised at you, Anthony. Very surprised. What do you think? I'm agreeing with the song? Is that it, Janine? You sound like, you know... Do you think I'm condoning what the song says? Is that it? I hope not. Well, I think we all agreed that we wanted to have this contest after the full-blown AIDS song that Jay Moore and his buddy Mike DeNicola wrote. Mm-hmm. And I just didn't expect it to get to this. Yeah. That's all I'm trying to say, if you think about it, really. It's got to be offensive. You know, and you guys agreed. You said, let's go for the contest. I remember we were asking the audience. We said it would get brutal. We said it would get way out there. You want a contest where we screen it and, oh, it's too offensive for the most offensive song contest? No. I can't imagine what was dumped out. You don't... I can't imagine. Yeah. All right. All righty. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Let's go to JR. A lot of people have comments, Anthony. We'll hear next on N.E.W. What's up, fellas? How we doing? Good. My partner and I worked in Staten Island on an ambulance about four or five months ago. We put an inappropriate bell on the dashboard. Great stress reliever. We broke the damn thing. I'm dying here. You guys are out of control. We got to do something about these boys. That was definitely the winner. All right. Thank you. See you later. Bye. One guy's pissed off because the song was dumped out of too much. Oh, yeah? All right. Let's go to PJ. PJ has an angle on this. PJ, you're next on N.E.W. It's TJ. TJ, sorry. You sent me the inappropriate bell? Yeah. Yeah. There it is. I just used it a ton of times then. It was perhaps the most offensive song I've heard, but it was so offensive that it was funny. Yeah, that's true. Does it get so offensive that it goes all the way around in the spectrum and become funny? I think so. I'm actually going to see Paul Bond tonight, and I suggest everybody go see him. He's a funny guy. Maybe he'll play it. Where's Paulie playing tonight? At school. All right. Maybe he'll sing the song for everyone. Yeah, I doubt it. Yeah. All right. All right, PJ. Thanks. Bye. A couple more and we'll move on. Brian, you're next. What's up? Goddamn boys, you're playing that song again. I'm fighting myself. That was brutal. It was beyond brutal. Oh, my God. You know, I'm pro-choice, but I'm starting to think about that after hearing that song. Wow, we might have changed people's opinions. We might have changed people's opinion on the whole issue with one song. Goddamn. All right, Brian. All right, thanks. Bye. Trish, what's going on? Well, I just called to say that those guys are far from offensive. They're past the psychotic mode. They need to have psychiatric help if they can write a song like that. All right. That was really sick. Cool. Super sick, especially when they said about the bones cracking. Oh, my God. That was a great line. I mean, for a woman, that's a pretty tragic thing to hear. And believe it or not, we're trying to get more ladies to listen to our show. Oh, yeah, that'll help right there. Yeah, right. Right. Well, I listen every day on my way home from work. So I drive 50 miles and I appreciate it. I've had a lot of good laughs. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Trish. Bye. We ain't playing it again anytime soon. Yes, we have. Bernie. Yo. What's up, man? Guys, I just crashed my damn car laughing so hard at that song. Come on. It didn't work to get out of the way of this person who's crossing the street. Ran right into a telephone pole. You guys rock, man. All right. You can get anything. Be careful out there. A lot of good instant feedback coming in. Patty from Babylon. After that song, FBA is like a lullaby. Yeah, really. Hey. Marty. Yeah, good morning. What's up? Good afternoon. How are we doing, O&A? We're doing all right. I tell you, I'm 56 years old. That has got to be the most offensive thing I've ever heard. Yeah. It's the worst thing in my entire life. Not even song-wise or anything, just ever. I tell you, the contest ends with this one. Yeah, maybe we should just end it right now. I really think so. I could live another 56 years and I don't think I'll hear anything as offensive. Well, if we're going to end it, you might as well play the winning song. Wait a minute. Let me know when you're going to play it again. I've got to take a little nitro for my heart pain. All right, man. Thank you, Marty. And thanks for listening. All right. All right. All right. All right. Pete, what's going on? Yeah, what's up, fellas? How are you? All these guys are complaining about this song. Half of them, these guys are like a bunch of thirsty monkeys out here. These other guys going on the child porn sites every day now they're complaining about this song. Are you kidding me? All right. I got a question for you guys. Why do you want to go syndicated so you can be puppets like Howard Stern? What's that? Nah, we just want to do it for... I'm not going to say it. Don't be such a pussy. Don't do it. For the cats, no. Don't do it. Yeah, I hear that, but do it. Don't do it. No, we have a lot of people we left behind in Boston when we got fired. That's one reason... What if they wanted to fire you? You know, I mean, what are they going to do to you in Cleveland or, you know, Minneapolis? Nah, not crap. If we ever get the chance to be syndicated, I hope we choose our markets wisely. We're going to be puppets, guys. ONA puppets. Winokio. We really want to get back into Boston because we left a lot of listeners hanging when we got fired. Be in town. All right, you thirsty monkeys. Damn you. Damn you. Wow. Hector! Hey, what's up, Hector? Puppy! I'm cleaning up my van here. Wow. I threw up in this thing. They're crazy. Dale! What's up, Dale? Hey, listen, Puppy, you gotta play it again, man. That was pretty lame. Dale, you want to hear it again? How can you have done that? I'm losing up here in North Lapland, bud. I'm sorry I'm far from so far away. Chris! Yeah, play it again. Wow. It may be rough. Well? What are you doing? Well, people, some people didn't hear the whole thing because it was... Well, we got to talk to Billy, one half of the team that wrote the damn song. Billy from Heirsic, what's up? Hey, is this Corky Opie? Shut up. Throw some hair on your ass. Shut up. Oh, it's so offensive. Oh, come on, Oak. Give me a break. It's freaking funny. I can't believe you guys dumped out of the bloody gash. Well, and you know something? You're saying it probably just got better. You know, the C word. Yeah. I mean, that we knew, but that was intentional. But the other stuff was not intentional. I went over that with a fine tooth comb. Well, Billy, I just don't see anyone beating you guys at this point. Yeah, we're pretty good. I mean, I guess we will encourage the listeners to try, but... Well, you know, Oak, you know, you say you have a need, we fill the need. I understand that. What the fuck am I talking about? Don't be whiny about it. Oh, my God. It was my turn to play good cop in the show. Will you shut up? Ah, but it was great. I give you guys, you know what, kudos for playing it. Because Paulie and I, we were sitting there thinking about it going, you think they got that nuts to do it? It sat on our desk for a while. We're just kind of looking at it going, you know, what do we do with this? You guys, we almost sent them in under a pseudo name. Oh, like we wouldn't have been able to tell. We're going to call it by touching Harry or something, you know? Oh, all right, man. All right, let's play it again. Play it again. Play it again. Oh, people haven't spoken. She's trying to play it. Play it again. Play it again. Look at all the phone calls, Opie. Everyone wants to hear it. All right, wait, wait. We got Chuck from the Mod Squad. from the Radio Check Show. What's up Chuck? Yo man, all I gotta say is, I'm about to leave, I'm going home, I'm about to get on the elevator and all of a sudden in my head and coming out of my mouth is, how much is that dark? What the hell am I doing? That was the entry from earlier, yes. Oh my God, here I got one for you. Here you go. Here you go. Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga. Stand in the morning for breakfast, makes my teeth white. Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga. Oh my God. Jesus. Now that could win. I just want to make it perfectly clear that a black man just said that. For some reason it's okay if you guys say that stuff. Absolutely. Alright. Thank you Chuck. Sounding good with the Radio Check Show. Take it easy. Alright. Well you sick F's. It is the People's Radio Show. And look at all the calls coming in. You sick F's. I can't be a dad. You bitch I've been had. Punch your stomach. Broad pliers, they got stuck. Your c*** is bleeding. Hangers in your uterus. Don't stop your crying. I think I hooked the fetus. Wanna kill a fetus? But just once. Can't get out of their c***s. Please, D&C. Suck down little toes and knees. Back, back yak. Can't hear the little moan track. Ooze, can't juice. Gonna pull it till it comes loose. Laugh your god damn heads off. You sick F's. You sick F's. You guys happy now? There you go. You needed to hear it again. Did you see some of the faces out there just like horrified? You sick F's. Is that the most horrific song you've ever heard? And Chuck just became a dad. Chuck from the Radio Chick Show, his lip is like quivering. Look at his lip. Dude, I'm like terrified. You know what, it's like watching somebody take a dump or something. It's horrible. You know what I mean? Why am I watching this? Why am I listening? Why am I laughing? What the hell is wrong with me? I'm like so embarrassed right now. But that is so funny. I'm sorry. Probably the most offensive song that could ever be. I don't know how anyone's going to top that one. You're going forward with the contest? Oh yeah, we have to. What are we supposed to do? Call it off? We throw it out there, the people have responded. We have to continue with the contest. All of a sudden Louis Black isn't showing up anymore. Why? Oh my god, I wonder why. Where's Louis? He's writing another song to try to beat that one. Yeah, I'll see you guys later and I'd like to say that I'm officially disassociating myself with this song. Very smart move. There he goes, Chuck. Why is the boss walking down the hall? No, really? Uh oh. Oh boy. Cut him off at the pass, Rick. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. All right, Louis Black has entered the studio. We'll talk to him next. Hey kids. It's your old pal Krusty. And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy, I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show. Syndication now. Thank god Louis Black has arrived, Anthony. Some sanity to the show. Louis Black had nothing to do with the last half hour of radio. No. He has no clue what we just did, matter of fact. I was on the subway. We're not even going to fill him in. It was pretty bad. We want to keep him out of this mess. We've got to take a couple of phone calls and then we'll get to Louis Black. Contest is a contest. Let's go to Pete. Pete, you're next on WNEW. What's up? Pete? Oh, O&A. You guys are sick in the head. What did we do? You got some friends in Boston you want to see? They're going to be sending you back pretty soon. I know. I heard the Greaseman is looking for some friends to join the support crew. Yeah, they're doodling. The Greaseman Joe. Well, we are doing the most offensive song contest. It got a little ugly today. What can I tell you? My palm just swatted. I can't hold the steering wheel anymore. I know. We all have that feeling today, Pete. Have a good one. You guys suck. All right. Thank you. Let's go to Larry. Larry, you're next on N.E.W. Hey, O&A. How are you guys doing? All right, Larry. You guys almost created a huge back up here on Route 80, man. Really? On the merges, yeah. I'm knocking cars left and right over here trying to keep it straight. Right. Man, you guys got to keep that contest closed. It's over. It's going to throw your butt down there. I don't see anyone beating that song. We do have one more entry that we're going to play in the 5 o'clock hour show. Thank you, Larry. All righty. Have a good one. All right. Let's get a female point of view here. Mary Ann. Hi. Hi. What's up? I think that you guys should definitely play that at least once a day. Oh, yeah. I'd like to. We are entirely too politically correct in this. Right. It's out of control and just wakes some people up. All right. You know what I think? If you're going to have a contest, don't you want the best of the best competing? Exactly. You don't want half-assed stuff. Right. So you got to, if it's the most offensive song contest, you want the most offensive song, not the most offensive song that was chosen to be played. Exactly. So it wouldn't offend too many people. Exactly. Defeats the purpose of the contest. Well, there's a lot of outrage today. Where were all these people when we played Full Blown AIDS, that song? That was the first entry. Medication now! Hi, Mary Ann. Thank you. Hi, guys. Wow. What are they doing? Lapscaff. John, what's going on? Hey, how are you doing? Great. That song is totally offensive. It makes Kill a Kitten like a nursery rhyme. Yes. Yeah, see, Kill a Kitten doesn't seem all that bad anymore, does it? All right. That got a lot of, what are they, they had postings on web boards about that, huh? Yeah. What, the Kill a Kitten song? Yeah, the animal rights activists all over Steve Jobs. I'm going to come after you guys now. Oof. We'll be reading about it in the paper. They'll be picketing tomorrow. Wait till, yeah, wait till Fetus really makes the rounds. All right. Thank you, John. Take care. All right. Forget about it. Oh, man. Well, enough of that for a while. We have a responsible journalist here in the atmosphere. That's where it's come to. We saw your political commentary there on Super Tuesday. It's sad when my life, when I am now almost mainstream, I'm going to have to kill myself. Isn't that something? You ever think? No, I never thought. Wayne Lewis, we're putting you on the webcam, if you don't mind. No problem. Because people have heard you on our show many times. They would like to see what you look like there. Yeah, this will really help. These are actually in my head. I wear them all the time. I wear them in really big, ugly boots. It's www.com. Go to the O.P. and Anthony section. There's a link to the, it's called the Spass Cam. And Lewis Black is on there right now. No offense. No, it's fine. It's fine. At least that puts me in a category I can deal with as opposed to responsible journalists. When did you come on? Compared to what's been going on in the past hour of this show. Compared to this show, I'm becoming like the John Chancellor if he were alive. Yeah, exactly. It's insane. That's what we're talking about. That's just wrong. What you are is directly proportional to the situation you're in. So, you know, when you're here, I don't know how much worse it can get than being on this show. And he still has no clue what just went on. I swear to you he has no idea. I want to hear this thing during the break though. Very bad. Oh yeah, well that'll help me. I need my eyes opened. I passed a guy coming all the way over though. It was like perfect because since it's bright and sunny the nuts are out here. This guy sitting, wearing it, I came around the corner and said, A black man with an Afro, which makes it what, 1967? And he's sitting on the corner of 43rd Street with a sign that says, Insult me for a dollar. You saw that too? A lot of people have been talking about him. That was great. Cindy and Rick's wife Linda saw the same guy today. And I thought, you know, son of a... I wish I had the time. That's what's sad. I want to stop and just pretend he's somebody else and yell at him for a while. You know, he'll probably make a lot of money. He's performing a service. Unlike a lot of people that just sit on the sidewalk looking for cash, it's a service. It's a terrific service. You give him a ten and tell him I'm going to be here a while. You know, screw the buck. That which is right across from that World Wrestling Federation restaurant, which just makes my block of peach to live on now. You know, when I think food, I think Big Sweaty Guy. That was a theme restaurant I had been waiting for. You know, nobody yelled, you know, they got upset about Disney, which was fine, but then these other things are moving in and nobody... it's like they broke our back. You know, nobody even pays attention. And insane amounts of junk in the window. You know, lunchbox and action figures. I mean, it's unconscionable. I feel like I literally have felt since yesterday that I'm walking around in somebody else's planet. I don't belong here anymore. Things are passing me by. And then an Applebee's on 42nd Street. Nobody said, that's wrong. Nobody said, you know, no, we don't need that. You know, what is it, a neighborhood pub? Yeah, where? On Venus, it's a neighborhood pub. You know, I want to come to New York and eat at a place that I could eat at, you know, at the strip mall. And then you've got to go up a flight to get there. They probably have handicap access up to Wazoo. Do you have one of those apartments where the neon lights come right into your place? No, but it's close now with that jumbo thing that they got on 43rd. Now that thing above, I guess it's ABC or something. But it's kind of neat though, because since I don't do drugs, it's like great, you come out of the apartment and there's this big huge sign right in your face. You can't tell what it is. You can't tell what it is, so you kind of feel disoriented. It's great. And then there's NASDAQ underneath, so that might as well be a sign. You're not involved in this, screw you. You're not seeing another dime today, are you? You put your stuff in the chump change thing, don't you? You're down there with the idiots. You're in the farming group. They had a scary image on the Jumbotron a couple days ago. Katie Couric's colon. They put that up there when they broadcast live on the Today Show. I'm serious. I heard a few people hit the building thinking they were at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Wait a minute. Oh, it's Katie's colon. I almost drove into the Jumbotron. I love that. And then they'll yell about what you do. It's like they have no sense of taste anymore, but they don't know they have no sense of taste. They think they're doing a service, and it's news to stick a camera up Katie Couric's backside and show the world her colon. You know what it made me want to do? It made me want to leap down to my doctor and get one of them. I've had one already, and I thought, oh, yeah, I've got to get another one, and this is really going to make me go do it. Why are you nuts? Because Katie did it. Katie did it, and it's creepy. And hello, why isn't Katie doing something like, can we do this? Can we find another way? Hello, you've got a phone that's an inch high. Can't we come up with something that you can go into the Kizuber without doing damage? I don't think that's right. It's like an octopus. It is, it's like that Roto-Rooter thing. You can think of it. When I had it done, my doctor was like, boy, this is great. It's just clean as a whistle. Take a look. Take a look. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, thank you. I see commercials all the time with fiber optics. Information can fly from point to point over a wire that's thinner than a human hair. Well, can't they put a camera at the end of that and stick it up there? No, it's got to be something like a tree trunk. Exactly. Something up there. Yeah, really. It just doesn't make, you know, everything is kind of like completely askew at this point. And I don't think it's coming back. No, no. Where's it going? Times Square looks like a scene out of Blade Runner now. Doesn't it, with all the video screens and everything? I just don't know how those people work though with the lights just flashing through their, you know, office buildings and stuff now. Yeah, and then it's great because I'm there. So there, you know, you've got that at one end of the universe. And where I'm living is a fifth floor walk-up where, which I think, I wish a kid would, Turing, she would present it as a diorama as a science project. Stack it off the top, bring it into the gym and go, diorama, look at what I grew here in 95 years. Look at it here. Here's a plant that must have started in 1902 when someone peed in the corner because there probably wasn't indoor plumbing. It's unbelievable. And there's no heat in my apartment because, you know, it's March. I mean, granted, today it's warm, but, you know, but two days ago when it was like 50 outside, my whole thing's opposite of it. If it's 50 outside, it's 10 inside. You know, it's like, if it's 10 outside, it's 115 inside. It's insane. You're the hippest city on earth and I got like metal in my, you know, it's that, what do they call that, steam heating, whatever they call it. Yeah, which is like, you know, couldn't we at some point, hello, what century? Yeah, the same heat as when we're in there when, you know, Hitler was blitzkrieg his way across Europe. You know, the guys came from the stone. Look at this. You know, but now it's like, come on, you know, there's guys living in a trailer that at least have a knob thermostat. And how about this at 2 in the morning? It sounds like the Concorde's taken off in my bedroom. It's that, that and the tapping. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of a sudden you'll get to think. Right. Well, the reason is because of the... What the hell is that? What's marching in my pipe? The reason they haven't advanced, they're too busy thinking of new theme restaurants. They've got their priorities in order here. And then I used to have one, it reminded me today because when I first moved into the East Village and the apartment had the tub was right next to one of those pipes that just burns you. See, now at least strategically I put furniture in front, you know, so I don't get just, you know, hey, look at that boom. Oh no, I'm singed. It's unbelievable. That's like insanity. Oh, very funny. There's quite a gap in technology, isn't there? Well, especially in my neighborhood. You know, I've told you before, I got the block that, you know, the block that Rudy forgot. It's the block that he's really, it's really important. It's the block that he, it's really, you know, we're like, we're going to be the old New York block. Oh, this is before Rudy. It was just like, look at the way they live. It's where the cops stop people. It's like the one block, and it's like stupid. It's like the, you know, 42nd Street or, you know, the 43rd is where they've got guys set up if you're going to the tunnel. You know, guys that come in, you know, my block, you know, so they're two in the morning. I got to listen. It's good. It's a smart block because tons of people just whipping down that. They don't go down the other ones. I can't take it. And it's weird. You know, we're screwed because it's about, what is it? A hundred and eight today? Yeah. It'll be, you know, that means there's a blizzard coming. Of course, of course. That's right. Just when we thought it was over. Oh yeah, no, this is going to be good. And this is like, you know, this is when I feel like we're just in a Petri dish. Someone's experimenting. They're going to eat up on them. Put the Bunsen burner under there. Yeah, let's see what kind of thing I can get glowing in Lewis's lungs. All right, I think everyone needs to breathe. It's Lewis Black. Are you plugging anything, Lewis? Just my butt. Thank you. Oh, hey. I'll wait for that. That deserves that. I'm going to be at the stress factory in New Jersey, in New Brunswick. I actually even leave, when I leave here, I'm getting on the train to go out there. Are you doing tonight, all weekend long? Yeah, eight o'clock tonight, 830 and 11 tomorrow and Saturday. Right. If you guys are in the area, you got to see Lewis Black. Very funny guy. And more with Lewis, you can hang for a little while, right? Hell yeah, we got to talk a little politics. And I got to hear this thing while we're off. Oh, yeah, okay. A big controversial song. All right, we'll be back with Lewis in just a bit. Stay there. Dudes with dudes. I think every time we open our mouths, we'll piss someone off. We're out of control. We're so wacky. All right, knock it off. 1027 WNEW. Anthony Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner. I was just talking to Lewis. I know, I'm sorry I rushed into a Stacker commercial. I'm sorry I had to interrupt the conversation there, but it would have been dead air. Oh, okay. So Lewis, just hold that thought. No problem. Stacker's very good, like today, come on. It's beautiful weather out. So now you're starting to think, oh my God, I got to get this body in shape.

Thousands have proven it works. This is the best radio you guys can come up with. 1027-WNEW. And we're hanging with Lewis Black today, Anthony. Yes. From Comedy Central's Daily Show, The Daily Show. And we're hanging with Lewis Black today, Anthony. Yes. From Comedy Central's Daily Show, The Daily Show. He does Back in Black every Wednesday. Yep. Very funny last night, Lewis. Very funny. Thank you. And Lewis, where are you playing again? I'm playing at the beautiful Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Just down from those, just down from extraordinary Raw Way. Yeah. Ah. It's the site of Raw Way State Prison, the first of these scared straight shows. I remember being from Raw Way. Yeah, exactly. So it's tonight at 8 and tomorrow 8.30 and 11, 8.30 and 11 on Saturday. And I'm working with Paul McCurio, who's one of the writers from The Daily Show. Cool. Very funny comic. And we suggest everyone go see Lewis Black tonight. Yes. The reviews on your live shows are unbelievable. That's right. Every night, the day after you play, I mean, the email goes crazy. That's great. I haven't seen you yet myself. I can't wait. Well, it's been nice. I really, you have no idea. I appreciate it because folks really show up and say, you know, you guys suggested they come down and then I try to move away from them. Yeah. That's a good move. Very safe bet. No, it's very nice. It's really fun. They come out and it's going to make it and they're a great audience. They keep coming back to see you because they're convinced you're just going to hemorrhage on stage at some point. They want to catch that. They will come. They want to be there, yeah. Well, I'm really thrilled because I get to get, you know, and the biggest, my biggest trouble about going to Jersey is getting on the New Jersey Transit, which is just to get on that train and go out there is such a pleasure because the guy who designed the seats obviously had scoliosis. It really is comfortable if you're pretty much crooked. You can see why they spent a lot of money. I said they just should have a stick up your butt. You know, flying on the stage, the money on the leather. Just have it so it's shoved up. Maybe do the biopsy then. Oh, yeah. You get a free pipe. A free pipe load. Every colonoscopy. Unbelievable. The Long Island Railroad, same thing. She's actually sitting there and it feels like you have a knee in your back. You're like, who designed this crap? And it's designed just that wherever you're going, it's designed that you get drowsy eight minutes before you get there. It doesn't matter where you're going. I think they release gas. They do. It's unbelievable. And New Brunswick is really nice because it's one of those places that's just far enough away that it's irritating. You know, you go, oh man, we're almost, oh, we've still got to keep going. Son of a gun. Oh, God. And you can see why people settled there. You know, because, you know, why would you want to be here when you could be just that that far away that you just drive you nuts? I'd go there tonight, but no, I'll go there. I'll just go to New Brunswick. It's a tiny town. It's three blocks, but they've done a nice club actually. Yeah. And it's, but it's, you know, I would rather walk there. Did you like the most offensive song there? I think it's, it's been actually, it cut, it cut a new swatch in my brain. Yeah. There's a section of my brain that still had trigonometry in it and it's gone. It just settled there. It lasered it out. It kicked it out. It was unbelievable. Yeah. And that, I mean, if you're looking for the most offensive song, you want the best, the champ. You know, you watch boxing, you don't want to watch a couple of schleps. You want to watch the heavyweight champs. No, that is, that one, did anything come close? Well, one of the guys that wrote a song is on the line. Let's talk to him really fast. Anthony from the most offensive song, Anthony? Yeah. He wrote the Barry Manilow. First one to come in after full blown AIDS. Right. Anthony, what do you have to say to that? Guys, all I have to say is this is my concession phone call. I would like to admit defeat right here and now on the air. I was driving home. I had to pull over. I'm on a pay phone. I'm 23, coming out loud, holding, holding, holding just to say, I concede. Now you're conceding. Are you now backing this new song? I am currently backing the new abortion song. I'm not sure of the exact title, but yes, I would like to put all my fans and all my people who supported me, please vote for now the abortion song as the most offensive song ever. That was terrific. There we go. A fine gentleman. You just heard Anthony concede defeat to the abortion song and throw his backing behind the abortion song. Yes, that Billy and Paul from AirSick.net wrote. Well, Anthony, it takes a man to say that and thank you very much. Thank you guys. I appreciate it. Breaking news. In case you missed it, you just heard Anthony say, do you love how the reporters do that? They have the speech, the concession speech like you saw McCain do. Let's ask Lewis about all that, man. And then the reporters have to come on and tell you 20 times what he just said. You want to reach in and just choke them. I can't understand. And then you got Tom Brokaw and Missy Knightley Nears. What she just heard McCain say was, I can't understand him telling me what McCain just said. McCain conceded defeat, playing that long face for the monkey. And I'm there. Still the funniest thing ever said. Achille Laurel. Tom Brokaw and Missy Knightley Nears. Leon Klinghoffer thrown from the cruise ship Achille Laurel. How did he get so far in news where he's like the guy on NBC News and he can't talk? It's perfect. It makes perfect sense. Fish impairment. At least I'm not getting a pipe shoved in my butt. Tom Brokaw and Missy Knightley Nears with the pipe of Katy Perry's butt. I'm going to have the camera planted on my genitalia. This ought to be fun. I am backing the Killa Fita song. That's the most offensive song, Tom. Yes. We'll be playing it as the new opener for NBC Knightley Nears. Well, Paul wants to thank Anthony for the concession. This is so much. Paul from airsick.net. How are you doing? Paul Bond. What's up, Paul? I'd just like to thank Anthony for conceding. We've put a lot of hard time. I'd like to thank God. He's thanking God. Thank the Almighty for putting the words in our heads. Wonderful. Don't forget Roe and Wade. Very good. Oh, man. Very good. Keep rocking, Lewis. You're the best, dude. Thank you. Thanks, Lynn. That song really helped me, I'll tell you. Lewis had to follow that today. I really don't. It cleared my lungs. It cleared my lungs. I gagged. If there's anybody that can follow that, it's Lewis Platt. Thank you, Paul. You guys rock. Syndication now. Yes. With songs like that, it'll be tomorrow. Sure. We've got to have them nationwide. We have one more entry today. I don't know if it's going to come close, but we'll give it a spin a little later. I can't wait. Lewis, what's it called? A preteen vagina. I think it's the new one. Jesus Christ. Did you see Lewis look at me for a second like I was serious? I'll ring the inappropriate bell. Oh, man. Oh, boy. Sarah on line four is sick to her stomach because of the song. We played the song an hour ago and people are still commenting. Can you be sick to your stomach? I don't know. Want to ask her real fast? Let's see. All right. Sarah? Yeah. Hey. Hey. You guys, I can't believe I have never had such a physical reaction to something on the radio. Physically sick and by our program. Oh, my gosh. I mean, I can feel it in my throat. I could leave radio now. That was my goal. I had to call because after all this time, it's still there. Well, the bosses sat Ant and I down and told us, you know, you guys really need to bring the women into your show. Oh, yeah? So we figured, you know. Hitting the important issues. Oh, okay. That's an accomplice. With a bang. Man. All right, Sarah. Thanks. Bye. All right. Bye. Thanks. That's great. Thanks for making me physically ill. Physically ill. If you can just yell that you can't, that's the best. When a sound coming out of your speaker can make you physically ill. That's phenomenal. Come on. That's great. That's what it's about. Yeah. All right. You know, if we're going to have a drug-free America, this is the route. Yeah. We need like audio narcotics. Yeah, exactly. That's what it is. I think you're coming close. Well, you want to talk politics a little bit? You must have some thoughts on what occurred the last few days. What occurred is utterly the worst. The worst case scenario is that we could spend $250 million and be nowhere. Yeah. You know, this is just the most... We could have saved the money, right? Yeah. Sorry, that song may be offensive, but what occurred, you know, with that, with what's occurring right now with just Bush? Now we're left with the two of them. That's offensive. Bush and Goi. I've lived on this planet this long to end up, and that's the best we can do. Give me a stick and I'm poking out my eye. That's insane. Look at that. They're both so creepy. One is out of a pod, and the other one is... He's out of a pod. I want to know where the pod is for me. Al Gore, Al Gore, worse than Al Gore when he was not peppy, is this new kind of... Yes. And I was, hello, happy. Happy. Hello, I was messed up. And it's like when he speaks, it's like somebody's giving him an anima. Dude. Yeah, they told him. Get excited. He can't get excited. He's socially retarded. The other one is socially retarded, and he sits with that wife. They look... I'm watching the two of them sitting side by side thinking, This is like at some handicap festival. He's looking at, she's looking at, they don't even know how to look. They don't even know how to act natural anymore. Are we supposed to really stomach this? It's true. It is. I've been in politics so long that you don't even know how to act like a human being. I would rather just get one of those robot dogs. Is that what they do with the wives of these candidates that have to stand next to the podium and give a Stepford wife a mon-friggin-heroine look at the husband? Because McCain, his wife, looking at him, I swear to God, I thought at some point her head would roll right off her body. It looked like she was on drugs. Like she was drugged out. Yeah, no, she does. And that was the best. The best thing yesterday was that McCain yelling at Maria Shriver. Yeah, great. That was great. Get out of here. But you knew that. But that's the thing. There's the little snap box that nobody wanted to talk about. See that and go, ha ha ha ha ha ha. Because that's the other thing with him. He ran and I kept saying in the actors, the guy's in a North Vietnamese prison camp for six years. Can we discuss that for a minute? No, no, no, he's a hero. Ha ha ha. Me and my friends went over there for a year and they're still like, you know, they're dragonflies coming in the yard and they're hiding in the roots. So I mean, let's get a grip. I mean, for crying, I just think, for reasons of discussion, you have to bring it up. You have to bring it up. What did you endure? How did it affect you psychologically? How do you think it's going to work on you? And what do you think it means? Well, we were hoping McCain was going to be our next president because we knew he would snap eventually in the White House, you know, and had a great line about the Rose Garden turning it into a rice paddies. I felt he would just rototill the Rose Garden, plant rice paddies, and just sit there with maybe a mounted 50 cal out the side window of the White House and pick off a few of the gardeners for all times. Little revenge. That's perfect. Oh boy. Or, you know, if he got any further and he'd have to go on the campaign trail further, and you know how they love kissing babies, I'd love to see him in an Asian community. Pick up a baby and just bite its throat out. You drew first blood! You drew first blood! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! Goose babies! Goose babies! Bring me a goose baby! Goose baby! Goose baby! Bite its throat out! I didn't draw first blood! You drew first blood! Hey, put that to music. I think we got another entry. Wow. Wow. You drew first blood. It wasn't me! I didn't start this! You started this! Goose babies! Jesus. The new tune, Goose Baby, climbing up the jives on American Top Flare. Oh man. Boy, I'm having an acid flash. McCain just checked in. He is supporting the Fita song. McCain did drop out today, right? I mean, I'm just being... It was sort of a half-assed dropout. He said, for now, you know, he's dropping out of the race. I think he wants to run as an independent at this point, huh? I think he's going to load up and try to kill Bush and jump back into the fray. I think... I just thought... I think he thinks maybe Bush might accidentally put himself in the electric chair, kill himself. You know, I can't pardon myself either. It was a paperwork glitch. It says I have to be put to death. Got to do it. I can't look weak. Got to do it. Got to do it. Have to electrocute myself. Got to do it. Oh man. So we're left with them, Gore and Bush. And now, Pat, you can have my other favorite. My personal favorite. The man who likes Hitler more than Hitler likes himself. He's a swell man. I really... You know, he's so misunderstood. That's how he's gone off, yeah? It always makes me... On the road, I go, you know, you've got to bring it up. I go, you know, I'm Jewish. And then you can hear the hush come up and go, ooh. You know, he gets a little laugh like, uh... You know, the guy is like, you know, what is he doing? He gets to run? You know, that's the best we can do for a third party is him. I mean, I'd pick a cartoon character. Anyone. You know, Clutch Gargo makes more sense than... Yo, Simit is in! I love him. He's perfect. You know? And he'd have guns. You know? The NRA would have someone to really support. And there's a group of... There's another group of Swedish. Those guys. You know? But that thing with Buchanan is... If you don't think that Buchanan is psychotic, okay? If you can't pick it up on your own with your own ears, go out and get a dog. And when Buchanan's on TV, put the dog in front of it and watch the dog spin around in circles and try to bite its own ass. And eventually it'll pee itself. And probably pee urine. I'm just telling you. So then that might change your vote. He has that type of effect on Buchanan. Yo, yeah, anything. Plants. Plants, Twitch. Oh, man. All he needs is the little mustache. Oh, yeah, exactly. He almost looks the part. And he's got that laugh. He laughs. Instead of going... Expelling air, ha ha ha ha ha ha, like in normal human beings, he's like... He's actually sucking an image. He's the third candidate. Yeah, that's perfect. Oh, wow. And now we've got months of this ahead. It was somewhat interesting. You know, somewhat interesting. You said, Bradley might as well have just eaten his own body. The poor guy. I really wanted him to make it. Did he have a fashion consultant or some kind of a person that tells him how to look? I know. Look and act. I mean, you know, it's like, come on, speak. Speak. Come on. Say something. You know, but he should have just literally... You should have started the first state of New Hampshire. You should have chopped up his hand and just eaten it. That would have been New Hampshire. And then he got to the next state, South Carolina, whack! Take another chunk of his arm, eat that. Until he was gone. Until he was gone. And I liked him. Yeah, I liked Bradley a lot. But he came out of the slots with that big issue, health care, which everybody just leaps on. Yeah, they jump on that one. Oh, boy. Because you know who really loves you? There's the people who really have a voice in this country, the people who don't have health care. And people who do have it don't even want to discuss... No! No! I'm fine, right? I'm okay. I'm paying enough already. I don't need to pay for anyone else. I got my co-payment, you pig. Get it. Go. You know, if you really cared, that job, you wouldn't be a temp, you little pig. You know, you do something with your life. It's unbelievable. No health care in this country. And then I love the fact that they... And so as a result, now health care is set back 100 years. Yeah. You know? Because now he's ruined it forever. Pretty close. Nobody's going to even touch that issue at all. And that's like stupid. I mean, I don't have health... The thing is, for a long time I didn't have health care, because I'm a comic. We don't have what, we got a union? Yeah. You know, what am I going to get together with Shecky Green and Mal C. Lawrence? We're going to discuss the deductible? Oh yeah, I know a deductible. Two Jews went into a bar, Hong Kong, quack, quack. Humble feet. What does Tylenol cost? I remember this. It was a joke. I used to do Tylenol in a Kentucky hospital. They would sell Tylenol for like 50 bucks a pop. 50 bucks a pop is when you get your bill and it would be Tylenol, $800. And you go, you know, maybe I should quit this and go down there and walk around the halls selling them too for 25. Do we have to get you out of here, Lewis? No, I'm good for another 25. Nice. We've got to take a quick break. Let everyone breathe. If you want to talk to Lewis Black about anything that's going on in the news, that's our political thing there. We'll move on to some of the other stories that have hit the news lately. We'll come back with Gook Baby Killers. Right. You started it, it wasn't me. Gook Baby, come here, give me the gook. Give me the gook baby. 2127571027. Lewis, the plug for your show once again. I would give you your plug, but it's not written down in front of you. No problem. I'm biting the throat out of Gook Baby. Okay, terrific. Wow, that cleared my sinus. I'm at the stress factory in Haiphong. I'm at the stress factory in New Brunswick, at 8.30, 11 tomorrow. And then I don't know what I'm doing Saturday. I may just lie on the tracks and wait, hope to die. I just lie on the tracks and wait, hope the dream train comes by. It's just a small patrol boat ride up the Mekong. Lewis, a very funny guy. Take him out to the stress factory and give him a call for taking him for a ride. And we'll be back with more of Lewis Black in just a bit. Let's all breathe. The OP in Anthony's show. Oh, stupid. Wow. or stupidity on the way I'm WNUW. Anthony. Yes. Rockaway bedding. We love Rockaway bedding. I use it. I have a Rockaway bedding bed in my bedroom. They have 130 stores all throughout New York and New Jersey featuring brand new mattresses, Sealy, Cerda and Mines, the Sterns and Foster. Up to 65% below department store regular prices. Rockaway bedding, you know what they do for you? They give you a free steel bed frame with your bed. Free delivery, and here it is, free removal of your old stained disgusting mattress. Now you know what? I hope when either George W. or Gore get into the White House they call Rockaway bedding so Rockaway bedding can haul away Clinton's old disgusting yellow stained mattress. Because how embarrassing would it be if all of a sudden you see George W. Bush or Al Gore dragging this disgusting putrid stained mattress onto Pennsylvania Avenue to wait for the garbageman to pick it up. You know what that's like when you drive past a house without the car up on blocks and there's an old mattress out in front? Imagine what Clinton's mattress looks like at this point. It has a crater in the middle of it. Oh my God. From Hillary's butt. It looks like someone dumped a load of Dunkin Donuts Bavarian cream donuts all over it, I'm sure. I would have to think. And then those two huge imprints of Hillary's ass way on one side of the bed. Wailed stains way on the other. Probably some cigar juice from things I don't even want to think about. But Rockaway bedding comes to your house, gets rid of everything you want. No matter what it looks like. Anything. Okay. Speaking of Foster, I think they got rid of him too. Called him away years ago. Oh wow. Something under the bed maybe. You can haul away. Come on. You can shop at one of Rockaway Bedding's area stores or call 1-800-TRY-A-BED. That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED. Rockaway Bedding, the best and friendliest place to get your brand, your new brand name mattress with the best prices and free services. Rockaway Bedding is the official provider of mattresses for Anthony and our buddy Jay Moore. Rockaway Bedding. You guys can conflict. Piss me off, okay? Hanging with our buddy, our pal Lewis Black from The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Check out Back in Black every Wednesday. Lewis does a great job with that. Lewis Black playing The Stress Factory tonight Friday and Saturday in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Eight o'clock show tonight. One show tonight, Lewis? One show. You got an 8.30 and a 11 o'clock show Friday and Saturday. Call The Stress Factory for ticket info, but we highly recommend you go see Lewis Black. Okay? Hell yeah. Joe Lyons just called from Comedy Central. I keep forgetting. I'm really Mr. Plug. It exhausts me to think about it. ComedyCentral.com, which now has a new video of me. It's the Comedy Central website. Now I'm doing videos about the campaign. They put me on so that my head is about the size of a pin. You can watch me flap my bird-like wings. Isn't it great to be on the same medium that just shows ox having sex with women? Exactly. You could just one click away. There's Lewis doing insightful, funny, cutting-edge comedy about all kinds of things. One click away, there's a woman doing a goat. Well, that's on page three of the... It's actually me doing the goat. You've got to go to the webcast to really find me. There's some secret passages and eventually you'll hear the goat. ComedyCentral.com, see Lewis doing a goat. I bet Joe Lyons will call back. That is the way you're supposed to do that. What does the matter with you? Nobody's going to go there now. A lot of people want to talk to Lewis Black. 2127571027, you've got something that's in the news that you want Lewis to comment on. Would you want to go there? I want to know what I said that pissed them off. Nicky! Nicky, what's the problem? You're mad at Anthony because of the Vietnam comments. Yeah, no, I don't dig it. It's like O-hole and A-hole and everybody's an A-hole. What upset you? You guys there, what did you do? In the NAMM, I had a cool New York Jets jersey on and I was going to elementary school. Pretty cool, huh? Now it's a big goof. Was I goofing on the Vietnam War effort? I don't dig the goof on the NAMM. What did I goof on? I was goofing on McCain. We never said the war was a goof. You know what happened to McCain? He spent five and a half years in that. I had an opportunity to leave. We've discussed that part of it too, man. Yeah, you didn't give enough attention to it. Well, you can't do a set up and discuss that and then go with the joke. It's that simple. The whole thing's a joke, right? No, it's not a joke. You don't get the fact that the bottom line when it comes to humor is every so often somebody gets hurt sometimes. Yeah, right. I do get the bottom line. You know what? I listen to Stern, I listen to his goose, I listen to these guys. You know what? It starts to really pee me off. Alright. Alright. Thank you, Nicky. Okay, Rambo. Alright, thank you, Nicky. Yeah, die. Alright. Okay, that's a beat, Opie and Anthony. Die! N-E-double. Make a promo out of that. Eugene! Yo! What's up, Eugene? What's going on, boys? We're hanging with Lewis Black today. Yeah, I heard that. Let me answer Lewis a question. What did you think about that stupid bitch, Cassie Lee? I mean, I was leaving the show. I'm waiting for her to kick her right in the ass one time. What do I think? I think you're just saying calling her a stupid bitch in the way you just did really made my week. Because I can't even get to that kind of voice you've got to really get up to goodbye. She is just another proof that, you know, why didn't she marry the millionaire? That would have been perfect. Yeah. You know? And then she, did you know she's doing this movie with her kid? Oh yeah, she's dragging her kid into a movie. And have you seen the clip? No. Have you seen the clip of Cody yet? No. Have you? No. The acting is horrendous. I'm sure it is. And he looks like a fruit in waiting. Yeah, I gotta say, yeah. You know, he's moments away from, you know, and he's got no, and he's like, that's it. He's there. If anybody could write a how to make your son gay book, it would be, Cathy Lee, everything she's done is a step by step thing to get your kid to grow up gay. And I'm really glad that she's leaving that show where at least we have her contained. Clearly she's in a box. Now she's going to branch into her other things. Yeah, to give her time for other things. Yeah, that concert tour, that opportunity to be on Broadway, movies. Yeah, sure. Because she's such a great singer and actress. Oh yeah, she's really special. She's gonna flourish after she leaves that TV show. Oh man. And you know the love boat isn't on the air anymore? It will be now. Any gig that she would get. Oh Jesus. You are disgusting, Psycho Mark. He comes in with jokes about Cody. Cody will be a Peter Popper. What does that even mean, Psycho Mark? Oh no, he's gonna be flaning. His wrist is gonna be limp. Okay. He's gonna be pulling worms out of the ground. I saw that clip though. He's a Peter Popper. It's unbelievable. Even in the picture you can hear him lisp. Now Cathy Lee is saying that sex, her and Giff have had, like sex is the way that they got their marriage strong again and the trust back with Giff. If you remember when Giff had sex with that woman in the hotel, what was his favorite kind of sex to have? The back door, the blood. I'm thinking Cathy Lee didn't want to give it up. Now that he strayed and then came back, she had to make some concessions. I'm thinking maybe now Cathy Lee takes it in the dumper. And that's probably why she's leaving the show, because she can't sit for an hour straight anymore. In the balloon. Giff tagging her. Alright, let's go to Dana. You be the center and I'll play quarterback. Dana. Hi. How are you doing guys? Good. Lewis, you're great. Thank you. Speaking of the millionaire, what do you think about this D'Arvichic? Has she fulfilled her 15 minutes of fame yet or do you think she has a little time left to go? Well, her brother died the other day so I had to hear about that. You know, that's what I really wanted to do. Now that I've got her in my face, then I've got to hear that she's got a brother with cerebral palsy. I've got to wake up and read that with coffee. What does that have to do with anything? And then I've got to think about people with cerebral palsy, which is terrible. But it's like, what? It's disgusting. And what is she thinking anyway? Why don't they just, they should have brought her on and they should have just, you know the interviewer, an adult come out and slap her. Somebody like in their 60s, he goes, what is the matter with you? You're in your early 30s. You are troubled. And they just whack her a couple of times. And then, see, you have anything to say? And as soon as she opens her mouth, hit her again. It's appalling. And then I said, but I'm thinking Rick Rockwell may be the guy running for vice president. You know, he's got almost enough credentials now. He's a jackass to the hundredth power. And why not? What about how to find a vice president and do that? Have him stand out there and have 50 people and then ask a couple of questions and we'll cut it to 10. Well, my dream ticket would be Gore and Clinton as vice president. And then Gore resigns day one. We get more years of that funny son of a bitch Bill Clinton in office. That would be unbelievable. I wonder what there's probably something in the Constitution. Leave it to Bill though to get around something like that. I want another four years. I don't care what I got to do. He said today his approval rating is at 67%. Because he hasn't done a goddamn thing in a year, at least a year. He's done nothing. Insane. France, you're next on NAW with Lewis Black. French? Frank. Oh, Frank. It says French. Hey, Frank. Sorry. Sorry about that. It's not an entire French nation. It's Spaz. He can't spell Frank. Now he's changing his name on the screen to Frank. Thank you, Spaz. All right, go ahead. Talk to Lewis. I got to ask you, what do you think about the Cos? That was a good story, Bill Cosby. I missed that. Invited some 20-year-old actress that has done some work on his show, Non-Speaking Parts, to his apartment in New York for dinner to discuss her career and how she can advance her career. Advice, right. Turns out she calls the cops because Bill Cosby at one point took her hand and shoved it down the front of his sweatpants. I'm sure he did. Allegedly. Well, that's what the police report said. So now, of course, she's suing and stuff. You know, I'm not a big fan of Bill Cosby, but you've got to question what she's doing if she's spending hours at his private place. Well, it may have been a punchline to a joke. We don't know. You may have said, you know, he may have stooped and it was, you know, they say black men have really big ones. Well, you know, here, boom. And then, you know, whatever the setup was and the punchline was his penis. Sometimes. You never know. Well, you do. You work with audio visual aids sometimes. Or maybe when she asked what was your inspiration for Fat Albert? Yeah. And he just wanted to show her. But also. Fat Albert in the concert. And then what are you thinking? What is she thinking? You know, I'm going to go, oh, yeah, dinner and drinks with Cosby by himself. At his place. You know, what are you thinking? What could possibly, oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure he's going to discuss that with me. I'm sure we're going to bring out the Stanislavsky book. Yeah. And we'll talk about acting. Well, obviously she got caught up in the whole thing. Thinks he's really Dr. Huxnable for something. And he's no, he's just a horny old man. He has a 20 year old in his apartment and he wants to get a little. But the thing I think about Cosby is, you know, that's what he needs is money. But he really needs more money because I don't think he really has enough cash. You don't think? No, it's unbelievable to me. You know, I just think he should have another show and probably he's got, you know, a website where we just send him money. I don't think he's got enough cash. And now, obviously, he's collected all the cash and now he's looking for a hoochie coochie. All right, let's go to Brian. Brian, you're next on WNEW. Yeah, I just wanted to know why Mike Tyson picked up Katie Curric. I don't have my bullhorn. Yeah, we don't have the Mike Tyson bullhorn today. Sorry, no props here today for the bullhorn. Did you hear about that? What, you mean Mike Tyson and Katie Curric? Yeah, the Katie Curric and the... Oh, we talked about her getting the pipe already. The ass exam? Yeah, we did. We went through that. Laying on her side as she was right on camera. You did. I discussed it. There was a smell in the air. Oh, God. That was Staten Island. John, what's going on? Hey, what's up, WNEW? How are you? I was wondering if you guys heard about Magic Johnson. Yeah, we were going to talk about Magic Johnson. Here's another guy who can't get enough puss. What did he do? He can't get enough. He had a girl come into his hotel room to give him a massage. After like three hours of massage, she claims that he grabbed her, fondled her, and deep tongue kissed her. And now she's being AIDS tested and suing him for untold amounts of cat. Again, why are you in a hotel with Magic Johnson for three hours and get in a position where he's going to thrust his tongue down your throat? Man, oh man. She was just wearing a T-shirt. Just a T-shirt. Just a T-shirt. Wonderful. What are you expecting? You know, no sympathy here. Magic Johnson is known to be a womanizer. I mean, you got to know it. That's how we got the AIDS. Yeah, really? You know something? Heterosexual sex, causing AIDS, giving AIDS to men, is not as high as some other groups, let's say. You really got to beat the odds on that one. You got to make it up in quantity. And that's what he does. He's a womanizer. And now she finds herself in this hotel room, and now she's freaked out because he tongue kissed her? You put yourself in those situations. What did she say? Well, you know, I'm going to come up, I'm just going to wear a T-shirt, but no kissing. No kissing. Let's know who who who. No, no, there won't be any of that. And if there was ever anybody that looked healthier after getting AIDS, it's Magic Johnson. For the love of God, what does this guy take it? Oh, man, it's really like, it's unbelievable. The guy gained weight after he got AIDS. And got a TV show. And got a TV show. Oh, yeah, boy, yeah, that's it. You know, he played basketball, and now that he's got AIDS, let's let him talk. The worst talk show ever. Oh, yeah. Ever, ever, ever. Hey, Mike, what's up? Hey, guys, love the show. Thank you. What did Lewis think about Daryl Strawberry? Daryl Strawberry is, you know, there, you know, I think we ought to give him 100 more chances. I think that first up, he should play at least 55. I think we keep bringing him back, see what other drugs he wants to do. You know, because God, he's got a problem. It's like at one point you just go, that's, no, sorry, can't, right. You don't get to go to the till anymore, okay? You got, you were sitting at the big money pit was there. Now you got to come up with something else, go, now you're stuck. Now you're going to be a born-again Christian, you little pig, wander through the South from church to church, whining and complaining and putting out the little, you know, your little thing and asking for a couple of bucks and write your book about how you met Jesus. And he said, oh, it was me or some crack. And then I had my revelation. And then he can go, he can do a church week. He can be like I am. I go from Village to Dell to every comedy club in the world. Every comedy club in the world. Let him wander around like some moron. You know, you got to break in the world. And you just, you know, okay, if cancer is not going to get you to detox, what is, you know? God just sticks it right up your kazooters because, okay, I'm going to kill you. And you go, okay, I'm going to have some more coke. Okay? There's not even a moment of it. And then, you know, I think I'm just, I'm just, I'm speechless when it comes to it. I love when you get to that point. Oh, man, I think we have time for one more here. Peter? Oh, yeah, hey guys, I like your show a lot. Hey, thanks, Lewis. I was wondering, I heard a story yesterday about a fender bender where a lady had rear-ended a guy, but it was really not a big deal. But he became so enraged that he got out of his car, went over to her car, grabbed her dog and threw it into oncoming traffic. Whoa! And killed the dog. This is a huge story in California, right, Peter? Yep, that's right. Yeah, this guy got... Do you think that's justified? Justified? Wow! No, I'm only kidding. Someone write a song about that. The contest is still on, most offensive song. What happened, where, in LA? Yeah, what happened was there was a little road rage incident. In LA? I believe so, yeah. Okay, then I think they'll treat martial law and shut it down. Shut the whole city down, and that's what I feel. I drove there about a week ago, and, no, they should shut... They should shut the whole place down. They should really... And force those idiots to walk, okay? He's the one, he snaps, and the whole class has to stay after. No one gets a car. You've got to go from place to place by foot, like in the old days, you little pigs. If you don't know how to drive a car, and your concept is I'm going to drive for 16 hours a day, well then, and you can't do the privilege well, the whole class is punished. That's the way it works as far as I'm concerned. They can go to hell. I was driving two hours a day. They're psychotic. They are so psychotic. It is insane to drive out there. Insane. You know, we have our Blake Long Island Expressway, and sure, that's complete madness, but it's just a part of the chunky... this is like forever. Four to five hours of driving, and you're still in the same place. That's all. That's true. When you drive two hours, you should be in another state. And try to get over six lanes of traffic to get to your off-ramp. That's the good one. Because they announce, you know, about 30 seconds beforehand. Yeah, yeah. Now you've got to go six lanes over. Was it a poodle or something, though? Did you guys get the details? Unless it was a little fender bender. All right. The guy has road rage, and the lady's sitting there. She rolls down a window. The guy starts screaming at her. And her little poodle or whatever jumps on her lap. The guy grabs a dog and throws it. Wow. Wow. That is... Oh, man. Pretty heinous. Well, he may have had a poodle that, you know, that got in his face in the past. Well, you know something? He has a little winky in his face when he was a kid. Oh, it looks like a bichon. Yeah, that's a general. A bichon frise. One of those lap dogs. Oh, my goodness. And then they've got to show the picture of the dog. Yeah. They've got... Oh, man. They're like the dead dog, yeah. The dog has died, you know. Services for Fluffy will be held. Is this a bichon? Yeah. My sister used to have one of those. I wanted to throw it into traffic. I swear to God. Oh, man. Well, you know something? She must have really done something bad for a guy to want to grab her dog and throw it into traffic. I've been in situations where I want to throw the driver into traffic. Yeah, probably driving with the dog on its lap. Give mommy kisses. Give mommy kisses. Hey, mommy, drive through the green light. Man, oh, man. And you get into a little fender bender and throw the dog out into traffic, huh? That's unbelievable. Hey, Mike, what's going on? They show a picture of the dog. All right, check this out. Talk about traffic. Yeah. Two people have insect on the side of the road on the northern state, exit 32. Are you serious? In a convertible, in a Jetta. Man. I've seen a Jetta dog, green car. She's on top of his lap on the passenger side. Northern state, exit 32, they're just going at it on the side of the road. Northern state, exit 32. She's wearing like one of those panther tops, but like gray color. Beautiful, man. Beautiful. Can anyone else confirm that out there? How's the traffic? Just slowing down to a stop? It was back up over there. Yeah, sure. It was back up. I was like, what the hell's going on? I thought we were in traffic. No way. Usually when you're in traffic and you're waiting forever, you're just praying for blood and guts because you're so pissed off because you waited so long. That's something I would say, okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm just going to pull over and join them. All right. Thank you, Mike. All right. Bye. Wow. Sex on the side of the northern state tonight, exit 32. Sean, what's up? Hey, how you doing all day? You guys suck. Thank you. All right. Just wanted to say about second chances. What does he think about Sammy the Bull blowing the chance that he got? Can you believe that one? He's got to be nervous. Yeah, and then he had his kids doing it too, which is good. The whole family, the wife, the kids. But with him, okay, at least with him I get it. Okay? What else is he going to do? Is he going to go be, oh boy, I just finished killing 300 people. Now I'm going to paint. It doesn't happen that way, okay? This is what he does. You got a point. You know what? He gets pulled back in. He's criminal. And he was career criminal. I'm going to go paint. He's in Phoenix, right, too, which is where they all seem to live. Yeah, they all throw him back in Arizona. He's in Phoenix, which I think would drive me to die. I would need ecstasy on a permanent basis. I had 118, which is a really nice weather in the summer. It's nice if you want to bake a chicken on the sidewalk. I'd be lying in my air conditioning going, I'm going to have some more of that ecstasy. Oh, wow. Sammy the Bull. Yeah, he's got to be a little nervous now. People know where he is. John Gotti looking for him. Well, not John Gotti himself. He's kind of put, he's indisposed at the moment. He'll probably go to trial and rat on his kids. Yeah, knowing him, right? To save his own ass. Well, Lewis sucks you. I got to hit the road. I got to go get on that rush hour on the New Jersey Transit. The other pleasurable part of this experience today will be going with those people who are sweating like pigs. They're wearing their coats. It started about 30 this morning and now they're sweating and salivating. It'll be just a treat. I can't wait to get on that train. Oh, boy. Train that smells like a soup kitchen. Well, we got to thank Lewis Black for stopping by. Always a pleasure. He's at the Stress Factory tonight for an 8 o'clock show in New Brunswick, New Jersey. If you can't make it tonight, he'll be there tomorrow and Saturday, 8.30, an 11 o'clock show. You got it. Oh, I finally got it. The phone number for the Stress Factory, we got it here if you want to call us. But it's 732-545-4242. Lewis Black, thank you very much. Thanks, guys. I had a lot of fun. And of course Comedy Central and ComedyCentral.com. Oh, thank you. Dad is going to be happy tomorrow. My video will be on it shortly. Yes. Okay. And I guess coming up next, Anthony, another entry in the Most Defensive Song Contest. Oh, my God. I can't wait. I'm waiting with bated breath. We'll do that next. OP, you're a sick ass man. Anthony, you're not a jackass. You're obviously a stud. The OP and Anthony Show. It makes me sassy. 1027 WNEW. OP and Anthony. Are you in love with each other? Yes. We're home mobs. Love gay people. Love gay people. Yes. We're home mobs. It's so easy to get guys naked. Yes. We do have a lot of pent up sexual frustration. Yes. We're coming out. We're gay. Hey, is this the home mo and Anthony show? Yes. OP and Anthony. Two guys who are not afraid to love each other. We're here. We're queer. We're fabulous. Get your stuff. 1027 WNEW. Jesus Christ. I burned that one. That's the last time you'll hear that one. That was the moment we were playing when Jay Moore was here. Yeah. When the show was getting a little too gay. Here, get this to production. We're done with that one. My God. Once again, I want to thank Lewis Black for stopping by the studio today. Very funny man. I need a nap now, but yes, a very funny guy. Yeah. He gets rave reviews when he does his stand up act, and he's doing that tonight at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Eight o'clock show tonight. If you can't make tonight's show, he'll be there Friday and Saturday, 8.30 and 11 o'clock. Two shows. Okay? Cool. All right, Anthony. In the middle of the Lewis Black segment, can't really call it an interview. He's an owl and he just kind of hangs. Sure. Hangs on the show a couple times a month. Someone called in about a couple having sex on the Northern State Parkway on exit 32, was it? Yeah. On the side of the road, and we're begging people to call in to confirm it. We've got Andy on the line. Andy, what's going on? I just saw it on the Northern State. They were going at it eastbound. They were just pulled over on the side of the road. Pulled over on the side? Yep. Going at it in a little green convertible. And the top's down? Top's down. I hear the top's down. The girl has just mounted the guy. Yep. Passenger seat. Passenger seat. How is he sitting? He's just relaxing. Recline him back. Oh, and she's sitting on top of him? Are people beeping at the guy or anything? No. I was just driving by. They've caused him a little bit of a traffic jam. Is she naked? No, not on the top. Not on the top, huh? No. Maybe she has a little skirt on or something. Wow. Can you imagine 1010 wins? They have to report this? Because they always report what the problem is up ahead and stuff, you know? I'd love to hear that one. All right, Andy, thank you. All right, take it easy. All right, bye. Traffic being backed up on the Northern State Parkway from my vantage point here above it. There's a guy getting laid down there. What a mess. Look at that. The car's backing up here. That's what I call a traffic jam. He's jamming her in traffic. John, you're next on NAW. What's up? Hey, what's up, ONA? How are you? All right. Yeah, I checked it out. I seen it on the highway there. You saw the sex on the side of the road too, huh? Yeah, it was crazy. I thought you guys were starting up some new thing like having sex wherever or something. Well, yes, it is. It's Have Sex Thursday. Have Sex Thursday. Have Sex anywhere you damn well please Thursday. Right now, we want all our listeners to stop doing what they're doing and have sex. All you're going to see is people on the side of the highway having sex. All right, John. All right, man. Thank you. All right, thanks. I guess it's happening, Anthony. Yeah. We need a brave soul with a car phone to stop behind him and, you know, get an interview, an exclusive interview with a couple having sex on the Northern State Parkway. All right, well, I... I'll power tone. Anthony, you want to get back to the most offensive song contest. Well, it is the current contest we're running here on our show, the most offensive song ever written. We've had some entries that have just been brutal, the last of which that came in from Air Sick, the abortion song. Don't even know what to say about it. It is probably the most offensive song you'll ever hear. Which officially is in the lead at this point. Yeah, yeah. Preliminary voting being in, it seems to be running away with only a small percentage of the precepts checking in. Just running away with this thing is really going to take an offensive effort to dethrone this song. Yeah. But I have faith in our sick perverse listeners. They'll come up with something that'll beat it. So we have another contender. Yes, we do. Let me just see if this guy's real. A guy that is walking behind the couple having sex. Pete, come here. Are you really near the couple having sex on the... Yeah, man, I'm on exit number 32. All right. On the Northern State, I'm walking right up to them. Are you really? Yeah, hang on a minute. All right, if anyone's in the area, please beep. I don't know if this is real. I'm intending not to believe this. But we will say. Yeah, man, hold on. All right, they just looked at me. Had a dump. He's cursing. No, I'm not cursing. He said, what the F? Oh, I did. I'm sorry, man. All right, man. Oh, my God. All right, Pete. All right, later. Good try. Great. All right, so where were we? Oh, yeah, most offensive song. Most offensive song ever written. Started with full blown AIDS. And boy, the people really took up the challenge in writing some truly offensive and tasteless songs. The Barry Manilow most offensive song was in the lead. Good one. A lot of racism in that one. A little of everything in that one. Another one, How Much Is That Darkie in the Window was played earlier on today's show. A little monotonous, repetitive, but very offensive. And shocking. And shocking, truly. That was from Jeff, who calls himself Fuel, I believe. Fuel. OK. And then Jesus Christ. A song that. Billy and Paul from Airsic Productions checking in with what could be the most offensive song ever written, the Fetus song. Kill a Fetus. Kill a Fetus. We were shocked, stunned, and thoroughly entertained. And now we have a new entry. Yeah, we have another entry from Fuel. Oh, yeah? Jeff. Same guy? Yeah, Fuel. The guy who. Hedging his bets. Sending in two. Who wrote How Much Is That Darkie in the Window? Well, hold on to your hats, people. All right. Do you want me to. I should give the name of the song, I guess, huh? I guess you want to intro it. Like a CBS FM jacket? That's your gig. Here we go. I don't know the name of the song. Oh, here it is, Anthony. OK. Here it is, Harry Sack. Harry Sack with you, CBS FM. This one coming in by a new artist, Jeff. Ladies and gentlemen, on CBS FM, we premiere this song, Baby Raper. CBS. Baby Raper by Jeff. The other inmates think I'm die to sick. Because of where I like to dip my stick. And how I always talk about the game. I met that little hearty John today. I wish that they could somehow understand. I'm just an average ordinary man. Who somehow they just can't seem to get. While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet. Baby Raper. I'm a baby Raper. Sweet and young. Good enough to eat. Baby Raper. I'm a baby Raper. The youngest cherries. Always taste so sweet. I drink my date up at the Disney Store. When mommy turns away, I go for more. Sing them songs and tell them that they're sweet. I'm just an average ordinary man. Who somehow they just can't seem to get. While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet. While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet. Baby Raper. I'm a baby Raper. The youngest cherries. Always taste so sweet. Baby Raper. I'm a baby Raper. Sweet and young. Good enough to eat. I'm a baby Raper. I'm a baby Raper. Whoa! Okay. We got a contest now. Yeah, we got us a contest now, don't we? Alright, listen. We got a winner, Steve is saying. We want the people to vote that have heard both songs today. Or all three songs, I should say, alright? A lot of people coming in. Take it back, this song beats the fetus song. Worse than the fetus song. Oh my God. Uh. Just coming, ding ding ding, winner. They're calling it the JonBenet song, unofficially. It's definitely a toe-tapper. Alright, let's go to Antonio on line one. Antonio. What? Anthony. Hello. Yeah, you're on the air, let's go. No, that topped it off. I'm sorry. I just recorded the whole thing on my computer. I recorded it on my tablet, my stereo. And it's a toe-tapper. Have you heard all the songs today? I heard them all. And you think that's the one? That's the one. Alright, thank you, sir. By the way, I'm the guy who ate the Twinkies. Oh, right on, I remember you. Yeah. From the road show, cool, bro. Alright, thank you. We'll see you soon, alright? In the gate. Oh, sorry about that. This year's Grammy for the most tasteless and offensive song going to baby Raper. F'ing sick, man. Jeff has problems. All these coming in like crazy. Baby Raper, the worst song ever, ever. Alright, let's go to Phil. Phil, you're next. Phil. It's Bill. You got it wrong. Sorry, what's up, Bill? I'm going to be singing this song all night long. We were humming that all day before the show today. Baby Raper. I'm a baby Raper. I've heard all three songs. My father best. Wow. I didn't think anyone was going to beat Airsick. It's toe-tapping, it's funny, and it's offensive. What else can you have? Alright, thank you. Let's go to Steve. Steve, you're next on NAW. Hey, guys, end the contest. It's over. We got a winner, man. But that's what you guys said about the song before this. I'm going to be singing this song. Alright, thank you, Steve. Alright, man. Indication yet? Oh, sorry. I didn't think there could be anything that beat the fetus song, but holy ass this does it. Winner, baby Raper. I didn't mind hearing this song. I minded hearing the abortion song. Well, they're offensive in two different ways. I think the fetus song more disgusting. I think the baby Raper will be more offensive. I think the fetus song is more disgusting. I think the baby Raper will be more aggressive. two different ways i think the fetus on more disgustingly offensive but this song just wrong just completely wrong i let's go to craig craig your next third-round tk of the phone just took on the chair while okay while by far the most hilarious on the record for a lot of funny people think it's a say look at this baby raped the most vile cruel sick and funny a song i've ever heard that i had a view of the uh... the the motion down to you know it's a target you will find yourself you wake up three of them on it the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the let's talk to the songwriter jep a k a fuel gas a guy uh... i think i know they're going to do it your first entry uh... uh... how much is that darky in the window didn't get uh... you know great reviews but then the second one the follow-up uh... track alas sometimes the first song they put out is it really the head i should explain now so beside it my original entry was supposed to be baby uh... middle of writing it i got the idea for the other one for the fact what the heck let's write that one brought on their cap my god we've always all about baby river well i was always a little bit well arm at this point uh... not all the voting zin but uh... it looks like it looks like you're you're taking over the fetus are climbing the climate alas afraid of going to have to talk to you song i was afraid what i might do uh... right for myself but i'd uh... fuel brian staton island baby raper winner by knockout they are loving this song ultimate offensive song and it has a melody grammys here we come to the first that the best thing chris somebody might land that tonight singing at them so i think the crackup baby raper made me crap my pants look at that that's something for the album cover a little promotional sticker we might have to put a couple of these songs on our uh... next cd school baby rapers stuck in my head faster than comic chameleon does it be we deliver tegers though as a catching to ask actually there i don't know if it rivals that as a catchy tune i'm just scared scared to check the mail

a mix master yeah we're like fat voice live and remix and stuff uh... okay well i can't even jessica let you go but i'd just think it's almost safe to say that you're in the lead as far as the most offensive song all right well they might be a mission after animal rinkers or something to come up with something worse side this just a knockout blow unexpected coming in because everyone thought the fetus song was a runaway winner and that was it this is just getting rave reviews i can't do one thing my brother yeah jessica robert brother of a look up to you it's you're going to be around the

Oh, that's got to take, you know, the fetus I heard that today, I was sort of pretty bowled over by that one. But this one, my God, I have a baby. It sounds just like that baby is crying on you. All right. Well, who goes here with time? Huh? What? There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. You guys are psycho. All right, Liz. Thank you. Take care. Bye. Bye. No, don't shoot him. I didn't do anything. Baby Raper is definitely more addictive than Crack. Congratulations. The instant feedback just spilling in. Rob from Stony Brook. Guys, I am totally screwed. My girl walked in and I have Baby Raper blasted. And now I'm not getting laid for a month. Heard all the songs. This is a winner by far. Ben from Garfield. Baby Raper. Toe tapping little ditty that should be in the top 40. A winner. Should be a Casey Kasem dedication to John Benet Ramsey's Mother and Father. Oh, man. Where's the gun, the bell? Matthew from Jersey. Today, coming in at number one on the American top 40. Everyone wants the Casey Kasem. Baby Raper. It started as the most offensive song ever by a long distance dedication and has climbed the charts number one for its fifth time. Climbing the charts. And now a little song dedicated to John Benet Ramsey. Oh, man. It's a long distance dedication from Daddy. It reads, Dear John Benet, I'm sorry I choked you with a rope and boned you right before your death. Please accept this song as my little tribute. It's called Baby Raper. Done. Oh, man. Ponderous. F'ing ponderous, man. How the hell am I supposed to do a Baby Raper song and go into a goddamn up tempo number? F'ing ponderous, man. Let's go to Lisa. Lisa, what's up? How are you? Hi. What's up? What's up? I love when chicks do that. What's up? So what's going on today, Lisa? Well, I thought Baby Raper was highly offensive. I sent in a song that you didn't like it. We're going through all the entries. Oh, OK. You know, we have to just pick a few every day. So we... Well, I know it's not going to be Baby Raper. We played three today, so... I know. I heard them all. We'll have a few more tomorrow. I haven't been off, and I was going to tape it if you played it. It's called Sand in My Crotch. That's pretty funny. Sounds interesting. All right, Lisa. Well, have a great night, OK? Thank you. All right, Rick? Bye. You know, we've constantly got new people tuning in who may have missed the Killa Fita song. Maybe you should balance this out a little bit. Well, that's too bad at this point. Really? Let's go to Mike. Mike, what's going on? Mike, what's up? Oh, my God. Yeah. Baby Raper rules. It rules? Can I make a prediction? Yeah. I bet you it gets me fired from work tomorrow. Why? Well, I'm in that business where we install custom computer systems, and I'm always humming and singing while I'm working. Yeah. I'm going to be humming and singing that one, and the client's going to walk in, and that's going to be it. I'm going to be done. All right, Mike. Thank you. You guys rule. All right, bye. Bye. Does that make us rule? A song like that? You guys rule. Joe, very offended. Joe, what's up? Yo, ONA. Hey. I was listening to that dockey on the window. Yeah. I was doing pro clip before, and Ben Stylist did that. I thought it was really funny. Yeah. But this song, the baby raper, I have a three-year-old girl in it. It was making my blood boil. I don't blame you. See, that's a bad one. I mean, it's funny, but it really gets you crazy. I want to go like, spang on the guy. We're not looking for funny. We're looking for the most offensive. And that certainly was. I think we found it. Hey, you guys are much better than Stern. Thank you, Joe. Take it easy. Just an opinion, obviously. Thank you. Take it easy, guys. All right. Bye. Well, Ben's giving me the results here, Anthony. About 10 to 1 for baby rapers. Yeah. All pieces supporting Ben. Yeah. Oh, the crowd just going wild for baby rapers. Jesus. All right. Well, we've had enough comments on baby rapers. Yep. Let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Ophi and Anthony Show, 2127571027, as we clear the phone lines and get that going. We've got to say hi to Smelly Karen, Anthony. Oh, wait. Where's she? We were supposed to talk to her about an hour and a half ago. She's coming in tomorrow, I believe, old dirty. You were listening to that, right? Yes. The Roman Bath edition of the Ophi and Anthony Show. We're going to bathe her. We're going to bathe Smelly Karen. Can I bring a hard bristle brush? No. As hard to reach areas. Yeah. Smelly Karen, she's definitely a good looking lady. I hear that. Nice, nice brush. Yeah. But she has a slight, slight. That's an understatement. She has a little hygiene problem. Just a little odor. So tomorrow, we're bringing in a kiddie pool. Smelly Karen's going to stand in the middle of it. We've got some really, really high babes with sponges and lots of soap that are going to sponge her down. They're going to lather you up tomorrow, Karen. And a few of these girls very interested in having a lesbian experience tomorrow, so it could get pretty wild with Smelly Karen tomorrow. It's going to be a wet and wild Friday here on ONA. And she wrote me an email saying that she has a water fetish too. What the heck is a water fetish? Right Karen? Yeah. You get turned on by water, by taking showers? I'm taking a bath. Man. So how the heck can you smell if you like the water? I know. That's what I don't understand. It has nothing to do with smell. What are you talking about? You better have a fetish for the soap, Gary. How about a soap fetish? ONA, can I ask you a favor? Yeah, what? I'm asking tomorrow, can I be stripped of my title of Smelly Karen, please? Well, if the girls that sponge you down do a good job, I think we could talk about that sure. Okay. But if you come out of that kiddie pool and you're still reeking, you know. We can only do what we can do, you know. What could I tell you? The funkometer got to read zero. And I'm sure if you end up in one of our road shows and we bring you up on stage, I don't think anyone would chant Smelly Karen. No. Smelly, Smelly, Smelly. No one would do that. I don't think anyone would do that. I believe they would show you some respect and just chant your name. Karen, Karen, Karen, right. Oh, all dirty. It makes a difference, guys, because I'm 20 and I'm not even allowed in your road show yet. Oh, thank God. Oh, man. It gets hot under those lights. Yeah, these road shows smell enough. That wouldn't be a problem for me. Right, okay. Yeah, they'd be stinking, Karen. You're going to bring the level. Oh, my God. Aw, okay. That's not fair. All right, all right, all right. So, your boyfriend all into this? Yeah, he's all open arms about this. Oh, he's pissed off? Yeah, because the thing is that like he thinks because I'm bisexual, right, but it's cheating for me to do this. Oh, really? Yeah. So, I'm all like, oh, man, it's like should I have the awesomest lesbian experience with ONA or should I break up with my boyfriend? Yeah. It's like, ah. Tough decision. Yeah, it really is. But I won't be breaking up. But you have to have lesbians. Well, you're coming in tomorrow, right? Oh, yeah. All right, oh, yeah. Bring that soap, kid. Oh, I can't. Hey, do you have a preference for soap or shampoo? Not really. I just, no, not really. No, huh? Okay, well, I got contacted by somebody at Lever who was listening to the show. Lever, the official sponsor of Smelly Cat. And they just, I got the package in my mailbox just now. What is it? It's a box of soap. We need cool stuff. We need like a bubble bath. Yeah, I'm sure it's included in there. Some scrub loofahs and stuff so she can really get scrubbed down. Maybe we can get some brillo's. Like a metal brush. It's like a bath kit. Yeah. And I know what we should have done with Smelly Karen. Put her in the back of a pickup truck and send her through a car wash. Oh, that would have been awesome. Big word up. Well, if the bath doesn't work, we'll try that next. We won't give up on you. No, not at all. No matter how much you want us to. Our goal is to get you clean. All good. All right, so tomorrow's going to be a big day. What time are you coming in for your bath? About 4 o'clock, but I have to be out of there at like 5.30 because I have to be somewhere 6. I think an hour is plenty of time to... We don't want to be pruning now. Now, if your boyfriend is going to be pissed, you've definitely got to keep him home. Well, I invited him... No, no, no. Guys, always wreck the lesbian crap around here. You know, I invited him to come, but he said he had to work, but it doesn't even make a difference because he doesn't get the station where he works, so he's not going to even know. All right, yeah, but please, please don't have him come down here and wreck the lesbian crap around here. We're going to have him come down here and wreck our parade tomorrow, okay? Don't scrub the area where the smell is emanating from. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Karen... You really don't want me to shower? No, Karen, come in smelly tomorrow. Okay. I want it off the funtometer, kid. I'll walk from my dorm to the station. How about that? How about jogging? I want to see if you're able to offend OD with your smell. Yeah, yeah. The neighborhood he comes from, it's going to take a lot. Oh, my man. Come on, my man. Man, there ain't no bell on this table. Ding, ding, ding, bro. Ding, ding, ding goes the trolley. All right, Karen. All right. I guess we're done with you until tomorrow. All right. Tomorrow, big day for you. All right. We're going to try to get rid of your nickname. Okay, yeah, right. All right. Bye. Don't be, Karen. Yeah, she's got to come in raking, Anthony. Yeah. Yeah. Can we make a runner on the block or something, too? Yeah, she's got to run like four miles an hour. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. She's got to run like from the dorms, son. Put a milk dud in her butt. Oh, dude. Oh, dude. Let me tell you something. It doesn't take much. My man, word like that? Oh, my Lord. Oh. Everyone smelled it the other day and no one was brave enough to say anything. Antonis, is this true? Yeah, you know. I know. All right. Let's play a quick round of what do we learn on the Opiate Anthony show today. Dennis from Newark. Today I learned that people listen to Lewis Black for two reasons. His jokes are so funny. And number two, he's so on the edge you expect a blood vessel to pop in his brain and kill him mid-ranting. Very, very true. Lewis Black, very funny. He's playing The Stress Factory tonight at 8 o'clock in New Brunswick, New Jersey. If you can't make tonight's show and we highly recommend you try to, he's got two shows tomorrow and Saturday, 8.30 and 11 o'clock. Okay? Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey. O.D.'s checking out the picture, Anthony. We started the show with that picture today, man. But like one eye is bigger than the other. Yeah, you see that? Well, let me let everyone in on it again because the audience changes drastically. O.D.'s already holding up a picture of a girl right after the money shot and it looks like she has a really bad cold. Yeah. They're laying down rail behind Nick. Laying down some track. Yeah, that's something. She's got a... I didn't notice the rest of the picture because I just thought it was her face but look, there's some boobage and legs and look at that. Look what's on her leg. There's some more. Like it's all over her. She got cream. Yes, she did. She was standing too close to the hose. Looks like you beat her in the eye with it though. What was turned on, man? You can't look down that hose unless you know it's not on. The lost milk mustache. All right, listen. Tom from Jersey. What I learned today on the ONA show, raping babies is worse than scraping them. Jason from Jersey learned that ONA fans are the sickest and most creative creatures in the Tri-State area. Well, that's very nice. We take that as a compliment. Thank you. All right, let's go to Damon. Damon, what did you learn on the show today? I learned how to perform an abortion. Oh, God. Wonderful. All right. I got to know how long metal cold hang is in this state. Let's go to Steve. Steve, you're next on NAW. Hey, I learned that exit 32 in a northern state would be better than Scores. Yeah, it's better and cheaper than Scores. Cheaper. Much cheaper than Scores. And I also learned if you're an alcohol president, you should eat Bavarian cream donuts. We like the obscure ones. Thank you, Steve. Yeah, we had a couple having sex on the side of the northern state today. Yeah. A couple more. We've got to get out of here. Tim? Yeah, what's up? What did you learn on the show today? I learned that tomorrow, over two million people in the Tri-State area are going to be humming baby rapers. Yeah, I believe a lot of people are going to be humming that in their sleep tonight. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Over and out, Diamond Dust. Diamond Dust. General, what's up? Oh, hey guys, what's up? Hey. I learned that Gary Glitter should do a cover of Baby Raper on his next album. You guys got problems, man. Yeah, we know that already, though, man. All right, syndication out. Burn in hell tomorrow, guys. Over and out, Diamond Dust. Sounds like a plan. Rich, what's going on? I'm learning my aim on full speed. You're going to stay in the house until you're 10 years old. I'm going to knock the door out with a stick. Yeah, that was. You're going to lock your baby indoors. Yeah, I think so, at least for a while. All right, thank you. Syndication now. All right, bye. All right. Let's go to Brian. Brian? Yeah, how's it going? Good, what's up? I want to tell you what I learned today. I learned that if you want to buy the sweetest cherries, you've got to go to the Disney store. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We were just having a psych. Guys, thank you, Brian. Take care. All right, let's go to Aaron. Aaron, you're next on NAW. Yo, what's up, guys? How are you? All right, I learned that I forgot everything that happened in the show. Right after baby raper happened. Yeah, no doubt. We had some great stuff before that, too. Also learned that the warm weather is pretty bad if you listen to that song when there's a family of four next to you in a minivan. All right, man, take care. All right, bye. See ya. Ah. Well, Anthony, I guess we could announce the results. All precincts reporting. I'm sorry to say, Billy and Paul, I know you're listening right now, but it's over. It's over, Johnny. Yeah. Oof. You have been surpassed. We didn't think it was possible today. And that's a good thing. That's unbelievable. But Baby Fetus is- Baby raper. Yeah, Baby Fetus is done. The new leader in the most offensive song contest. It's a whole new administration. Baby Raper by Fuel, aka Jeff. We might have to leave the show with Killifetus. Give it one last play, one last minute of glory before we move on with the contest. Before we move on. I learned that Earl can't get laid or do any work. Bob from Jersey. That goes way back to the beginning of the show. Dan from Stanford, Connecticut. I learned that Satan is holding a special place in hell for Jeff, aka Fuel. Fuel. Fuel rocks. He had better come to the next road show. Fuel? And perform that song. Well, we're going to try to do a road show in early April or mid-April. Could you imagine thousands of fans screaming, I'm a baby raper. Baby raper. We could have a bunch of these guys on stage performing their songs. Maybe we'll use the road show as the- That's right. The grand finale. We have the finalists. The awards perform live and the listeners who are there. Judge. You take the votes here and then compile them with the live performance votes. Oh man, that's amateur night, kid. Come on. That's not amateur night. That's not a bad idea. Rip it off to a piano theater. I don't know if we can handle another three or four weeks of songs, but- That's true. It's going to get ugly. But yeah, it's not a bad idea. What we could do is get four people and then we'll wait for the next road show and then the listeners decide who wins. We'll get finalists. All right. Is that chick going to show up at the next road show from the picture? Atta girl, baby. Hey Ray, you're next on NAW. Thanks. It looks like a thing of Elmer's glue blew up in her face. Ray, you're on the radio. Let's go. Hey, I learned that Michael Jackson is an alias. Fuel. Very good, Ray. All right. All right, man. Take it easy, guys. You suck. Thanks for all the great phone calls today. Thanks for listening to us. Thanks to Lewis Black for stopping on by. Word up, man. He's a funny kid. Yeah, I got to give him another plug because it's definitely worth it. You're looking for some in due and you're close to the stress factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Lewis Black on stage at 8 o'clock. You're going to laugh. I'm telling you, you're going to have a great time. If you can't make it tonight, he'll be there tomorrow and Saturday for two shows, 8.30 and 11. Yes. And with that, Anthony- We are done-ski for the day. Yeah. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done.
