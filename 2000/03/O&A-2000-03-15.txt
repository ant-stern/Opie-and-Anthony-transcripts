 Hi, I'm Angela, the first naked broad ever on the Opie and Anthony show, and the proud supporter of Whip em Out Wednesday, right here on 1027 WNEW. Opie, you're a sick ass man. Anthony, you're not a jackass, you're obviously a thug. The Opie and Anthony show. It makes me sick. 1027 WNEW. Hey man, what's up? It's the O&H show on this fine Whip em Out Wednesday. What is going on with these Wednesdays lately, Anthony? Beautiful. My God. We don't want to start Whip em Out Wednesday until like mid or late April there. Yeah. But every Wednesday lately is just a gorgeous day. Beautiful day. So I must say, ladies, please start the Whipping Out process for the love of God. I'm sure you'll have your fellow commuters on the way home tonight. A little preview of what you're in for later on this Whip em Out Wednesday season. Yes. When we get into full force there. But we can't let a nice day like today go by without encouraging the ladies to flash their fight. Hoot, hoot, hooters. It just proves that God endorses Whip em Out Wednesday because he's given us these beautiful Wednesdays a couple of weeks in a row. And you wouldn't want to get God angry at you, would you, ladies? So start flashing the boobage on the way home. Okay. Well, that's one thing we're doing today. And I think that's about it. The rest of the show will pull out of our ass. Oh, yeah. Sure. As we go. I don't know. We have a couple of things planned. What are they? Well, I think there's a couple of girls coming in. Okay, good. Very good. That's a good thing. So, what are the lesbian fantasies happening today? If that pans out. Lesbians with strap-ons. Strap-ons. That's all you need to know. And whipped cream. I saw that Stinky had to run out and get whipped cream. Yeah. For today's fantasy. So that's always good. One of the intern-type duties here on the Opium Anthony Show. Go out and get whipped cream. And coffee. Does it work still, the whipped cream? Or has all the nitrous oxide been sucked out of it by now with Psycho Mark back there? No, and Stinky, we better make sure it still works. He looks wrecked. Nitrous. Ben goes, he looks wrecked. That's how he always looks. Yeah. He's the clone of Spaz. What do you expect? Clone. They're cloning what? Pigs? Yeah. Oh, we've already cloned humans on the Opium Anthony Show. Yeah, we got our own Spaz collection. This one we call Stinky. Or Spaz 2. Spaz 2. Yeah, we already cloned humans. That's old news to the O&A show. I swear, you see him side to side, you would be convinced of that. We just changed the recessive gene to a dominant gene. Changed his hair color a little bit. That's all. We just shuffled around a few genes and gave him dark hair instead of red hair. But don't let it fool you, the intelligence level has not been tampered with. All right, well, where do you want to start today? We definitely got to go to the phones right away here. Hey Mike, you're next. What's up? Yeah. Hey Mike. Hey. I was on TRL yesterday with the wow sign. That was you? Are you the fat kid? Yeah. Well, come on down to the station. We got some prizes for you. Oh, I live in Jersey. When can I come down? Well, you have an invitation to show up whenever you want. All right. This is the deal. You get on TV with a wow sign or you get on TV with any sign related to the Opie and Anthony show. Yeah. That gives you a free invite into the studio. All right. Sounds good. To check out the show and then you leave with some great prizes as well. All right. Right. Great stuff. So you show up whenever you want. All right then. A lot of people emailed me and said they saw you, fat kid. They go, hey, fat kid on TRL with wow sign. How fat are you that everyone's just calling you the fat kid? I'm pretty big there. Yeah. How big? How big? 400. 400 pounds? Yeah. And how old are you? I'm 18. Oh my God, dude. What are you doing? I don't know. It's in his jeans, man. I was this big all my life. You know something though? It's in his jeans. If I started eating now and just ate 24 hours a day, I would never get up to 400 pounds. It's weird though. I don't even eat that much. All my friends eat more than me. I don't know. Then you have to work extra hard because you know something? 18 years old. What's on an 18-year-old guy's mind 24 hours a day? Sex. Exactly. Right. And how much of it do you get? At 400 pounds. You've got to be honest. Too much. Right. What, do you got some girls that are like friends with you? Yeah, of course. Because you're the fun fat guy. Yeah. But that's as far as they're going. Yup. Oh, dude. You've got to trim down. You're going to find yourself in your 30s going, I blew my whole youth. I know. And I was fat. How about Stack or Two or something? Yeah. I heard about that. Pretty good. I just got an email from one of our listeners. They've been on Stack or Two for eight days. They've already lost 18 pounds. Yeah. I'm going to start crying for you like Richard Simmons. Not because you're overweight and it's unhealthy, but because you ain't getting no quim. Yeah. It's like, you've got to lose some weight. You have to lose because you're not getting laid. That's a lot. They'll try to give me a rusty trombone. Now, how big are your parents there? Funny thing is, they're not big at all. Really? So where does it come from? Are you adopted? No, no. Do you have brothers and sisters? Yeah, they're big too. Yeah? How big are they? I'm about middle. One's a little bit bigger than me. Whoa. So wait, what, a brother? Yeah. He's bigger than you? How much does he weigh? No, not too much bigger than me. We look about the same, but... Do you look like those twins that they used to show on the bikes in the Guinness Book of Records? No, no, no. Not that big. No, I'm a little bit better. What the hell are they? The mini bike twins? Yeah, I know about them. No, not like that. How old's your brother? He's 18. Oh, so it's just a year apart. Yeah. Do you just like hang out and go, God damn, look how fat we are? Yeah. When was the last time you saw your penis? I don't know. For an 18-year-old kid, that's pretty tragic. Oh man, I'm dying. You need to see your penis a lot when you're 18. Yes, I do. You've got to do something. Well, I... Is that a fart? Well, Mike, this explains it because a lot of people emailed us and said, hey, fat kid on TRL with wow sign. Yes, that was me in the thong. I don't know if you saw it though. In a what? Yeah, because Cisco was on and they gave me a thong to put on, so I put it on. I don't know if you could see it though. You had a thong on? Yeah, it was over my pants though. It wasn't like just a thong. Oh my God. I wouldn't go that far. Yeah, couldn't imagine seeing that. Well, Mike, we definitely want to meet you. How are we going to get you down here? Are you able to get, you know, still, you know... Give it a house or do they need one of those trucks to take a wall down? Take you out with a crane. I can get out of the house. You don't have to call SeaWorld when you want to go to the mall, right? No way, no way. Okay, that's good. That's always good. I could walk around. I can get up there. I don't know when though. Mike, I'm sure people have told you that you keep going this way. You're at a high risk for a heart attack there now. Yeah, every day. All right. Do you go to doctors or anything? They told me I could take like some kind of pill that will help me out, but I don't know. Oh, probably FenFen. Your heart will stop. Yeah. No, you know what you got to do? What? Get yourself into some kind of regimen of eating properly and a little exercise. I'm getting all that McDonald's. See, you eat McDonald's, don't you? Yeah, a lot. Oh, that's crazy. I mean, you know, if you're a skinny person, it's pretty good you stop there, grab a little bite to eat, but if you're overweight, I wouldn't recommend that. Yeah. Yeah, you should eat some carrots and stuff. Yeah. Have a carrot stick and maybe walk around the block or something. I'm sure to a certain point you can't really help yourself. I mean, you know, it's in your genes to be a little bigger than, you know, the average person, but then you got to work a little harder. Yeah, but that doesn't mean you should just, you know, throw in the towel and go to McDonald's every day. You know what he needs? He needs a picture cut out of penthouse, put on a stick with a string on it, and then he could just walk chasing you. That's a big motivation. Yeah, like the carrot on a stick for a horse. You have a naked chick on a stick. Well, Mike, you come down whenever you want. We're going to know when you're here. All right. You can't miss me. All right. And we got some great stuff for you for getting on TRL with the wow sign. Sounds good. All right. We're going to let you go, Mike. All right, guys. You guys suck. All right. Keep in touch. All right. Bye-bye. There's Mike, AKA Fat Kid. He's got to do something. That's terrible. Diaz on line two. Not sure if I'm a lesbo. Well, not sure. We'll talk to her next. Yeah, we could help you out. Quick break. We'll be back. Our phone number, 212-757-1027. You guys can come, like, piss me off, OK? One, oh, two, seven, W-N-E-W. Well, let me in on the joke. What are you guys laughing at, man? The Opie and Anthony show. We got in the studio Rick, Rick, Ben, and Shai Kamar. Holy smoke. We were talking about Friday, how we're doing the little thing we're doing. Let me explain. On Friday, Friday, we're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We're doing the little thing we're doing. We got in the studio Rick, Rick, Ben, and Shai Kamar. Holy smoke. We were talking about Friday, how we're doing the little thing we're doing. Let me explain. On Friday, Friday's our last day at night taking a vacation. After St. Paddy's Day, yeah. And we started a new tradition around Christmas. You know, the day before we go away on a big, long holiday or a vacation, we want to invite our listeners to just have some beers with us. Yeah. So, the goal is that not one of these extravagant road shows that you guys know and love, pretty much Aunt and I just leaving the last hour of the show. We just hang out and drink a few beers. Finding a bar close to the studio, going inside, have nothing planned. We throw some shirts out. We drink a few beers, shake some hands, do some chants, and get the hell out of there, right? Right. Well, we are doing that Friday, this Friday, you know, somewhere within two blocks of the radio station. We don't want to give out the place because we don't want a mob scene, to be honest with you, because then you guys are going to expect something really, really good when all it is is us just having a few beers with you guys, okay? So, Friday around 5.45, we're leaving the studio to this certain location. Right. So, Ben and I are discussing this real quick. It's like, okay, what do we need to make sure that nobody has a problem once Friday rolls around, especially guys that work here who are going to be here until 7 and coming down and hanging out after the show. So, you guys decided to make some type of backstage pass type of thing. Right, the little badges, you know, like they have for concerts, the VIP t-shirts that you hang around your neck. Sure, sure. So, what? I asked Earl, I said, Earl, what are you doing this afternoon? I said, could you just work on this for me, so. So, now, Earl is in charge of making up our backstage passes, which are going to be laminated and they've got to put a little thing on. Right. And they're going to hang around our neck. Everyone's seen this. Let me set this up by saying those VIP backstage type passes are no more than two inches by four inches, right? Yeah, that's usually what they are. Everyone's seen them at concerts. Yeah. Okay. All right, so that shouldn't be too hard for Earl to do, right? So, I'm printing up some stuff off the printer and by mistake there's a sheet left on there that I don't see but is included with my stuff and it just happens to be Earl's draft of the all-access pass. Oh my God, look at it. It's a whole sheet of paper. It's a whole sheet of paper. It's a whole sheet of paper. It's an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper. That's bigger than my Volkswagen Hubcat medallion. It's as big as the Flavor Flav clock. What are we all going to have? It's Flavor Flav clocks around our neck. It's a standard piece of paper that comes out of a copier. That's how big this thing is. Print it up. Hanging around your neck. It's on the entire page. It could be Kevlar. It's a shield that you could wear. Earl, call the studio or get your ass down here. Hey, there's another thing going on with Earl that is a little weird, a little wacky. Last night I'm in the office playing a little Half-Life. Wait, wait. I've got to interrupt you real fast. Yeah? The chick that wanted to know if she was a lesbian or not, please call back. We're going to get to you. That's a very interesting phone call we want to get to. All right, she's calling back. Go ahead, Ed. Yeah, so I'm playing a little Half-Life and a couple of people left. So it was just me in the office. Earl comes in. He has been carrying around a nightstick, a freaking police nightstick for the past two days. So he's like watching me play Half-Life right behind me with this billy club. And at any minute I'm like, I know we have a pretty good relationship, me and Earl, but is he just going to snap and cave my skull in as I'm playing this game? He won't put the damn billy club down. Everyone's noticed this, right? He was doing it this morning. I said to him, I said, Earl, this is an office. Don't carry a billy club around. That's his intimidation. Now where's Earl? We want to talk about the billy club. We want to talk about this huge VIP pass thing. You've got to ask him about the van. Oh, the van. We don't even want to give him that. I've got to have one more thing. Wait, wait, what happened with the van? Well, hold on real quick. I just want to add a little footnote from yesterday. Remember Earl said he was working on a press release? That was sent out a month ago. The press release he was working on yesterday was sent out a month ago. A month ago. Just a little footnote. Where's Earl? Wait, the van is the van. The van story, man. What's going on with the van? The van story is priceless, Mark. I get a call in the office because, Ben, you call me up. They sent Earl down to find out what kind of van we have. He couldn't figure out what kind of van we have. He thought it was an infinity. An infinity van? It only says F-O-R-D on the side of it. It says Ford. He's been driving that van for how long? Maybe he's just a little distracted. I think he's the only one that has driven that van in the last 20 years. It's a Ford. Line 5, Earl. Earl. Yes. How are you doing? Earl, why won't you come down to the studio so we can discuss this stuff? Because I'm going to hurt somebody. Once again, there's people talking about you, and you won't come down to the studio to face the music. No, I don't talk. I don't care anymore. There's so much tension going on. Earl, last night we had you on the show, but you called in. You're only like, I don't know, 50 feet away. Come down to the studio. Now, first of all, Earl, why are you walking around with the billy club? Because I noticed that last night, too. It's a little unnerving. Earl? Hey, Earl. Earl? Earl? He's there. He's listening to us. Earl, why are you walking around with the billy club? Hey, Earl? He's still on the line. Mr. Volpe? Is he? Earl, he's definitely on the line still. Earl, talk. Spaz, scare him. Let's just go down there. Psycho Mark, go run down there into his office. Oh my gosh, I'm just going to kill him. I'm just going to kill him. Dude, did you see what he did yesterday? What did he do? Earl threw a chair and broke it. Oh, I know. He has been so backed up. I think it's backup of a seminal fluid that is going into his brain. Now, Earl, I know you're still on the line. Why did you tell us you were working on a press release yesterday when the press release was released a month ago? Yeah, well, Earl. Earl D. I know he's there. Earl, this is your airtime that you need. Come on, Earl. Earl, Mark's going to pass you by in airtime if you don't talk now. We don't consider this airtime. This could be a good break for a tape. How long does it take Psycho Mark to get into his office? He should be there by now, no? He should be there. He probably locked the door. All right, hold on. All right. There's another phone line ringing. Hello, hello, hello? Yes, guys. Hey, Earl. Are you on the other line still? No. All right, hold on. All right, let me hang up on that one. All right, Earl. Yes. What happened? I got caught up. Oh, why are you walking around with the Billy Club? I'm not walking around with the Billy Club. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. We all saw it. Are you trying to intimidate us? No, I'm not trying to intimidate anybody. Are you trying to give us a sign that you've had it with the abuse lately? All right, let's fight. Psycho Mark's in there just... Mark's going to get killed. I'm going to get killed. Earl, seriously, why are you walking around with the Billy Club? I'm not even trying to intimidate anyone. You just like walking around with the Billy Club? I enjoy the Billy Club. Yeah? I like the Billy Club. In what way? Do you feel oppressed or something? No, I don't. Don't put race into this. Don't play the race card, Opie. I said oppressed. What is Psycho Mark doing, Earl? I don't know. He took the club. All right, Earl, we have a problem with your VIP thing you're making. What? You know what I did? It's a little big, Earl. I know it's a little big. I had it on a file already. How are we going to hang this around our neck? It's as big as a regular sheet of paper. It wasn't meant to be hung around the neck. I had something else on file already, and I made a rough cut of it. Dude, this says, live at... What? Dude, this says, live at... Yeah, I made changes to it. I was going to shrink it down and print it out. ...Friday's day. Yes, I was going to shrink it down. I was going to see what it looked like on paper, then shrink it down. All right. When can we expect the final product? Friday? Oh, man, Opie. Deal with you later, Opie. I figured if it takes him all day to hang pictures, something like this has to take at least two days. God damn it. Oh, my God. He's pissed. Ring Earl's bell. He's pissed. Tom, you're next on N.E.W. What's up? Yeah, I would have thought to Earl. I think he's losing his sanity. I think so, too. I mean, if you're carrying around a billy club at work... Yeah, we stole the billy club. We now have that in the studio. Yeah, this is a workplace. I mean, why is he doing this? Yeah, I'm the main boss, man. I mean, why is this guy snacking? Well, to take Earl's side, he's been taking a lot of abuse lately. But he's working on the best radio station in the country, correct? And the best radio show. Right. So, I don't know. Our media is getting paid to do this, correct? We just like pointing out things that Earl does around W.N.E.W. I think we can point out what everyone does. Yeah, but he's proud of everything he does except this. Right. They're going to take him away in a straight jacket. Well, he hung up on us, so maybe he'll call back in a little while. I don't know. All right, Tom. Thank you. Thank you, man. Bye. Just a little angry. Let's go to Manny. Is this our Manny? Manny, what's up? Yo, what's up, yo? Is it our Manny? Yeah. Hey, what up? Man, I haven't talked to you in a while. I've been listening, man. All of a sudden, the OP turns black. I've been listening from the start. Did you hear the, the what's up guys yesterday? Yeah, I heard that. Did we cast as black? Hell yeah. Hey, yo, you know what? You guys get the whitest black guys ever. I know. On your show. I know. What's up with Chuck Earl? Chuck Nice is as white as they come. Earl is as white as they come. What's up with Rudy? Who's Rudy? Rudy's a white guy. Rudy's a white guy. A what? Yeah, Rudy's a white guy. Any black people that are hired here are strictly to just fill a quota. So we like, we like keeping them as white as possible. Hey fellas, what's up with Earl, man? I don't know. He's ready to snap. He's walking around, man. He with his billy club now. Let me tell you like this. I got a child and one on the way, man. Let me box him out his job. You want to box him out? Well, hey, yo, he don't appreciate that spot, man. Manny, I think, I think we might have to hire you just to have you protect us from Earl. Hey, man, you seen them two Jamaican cats I came there with last time. Yeah, yeah, those guys are all right, man. They'll beat some ass up. I would believe that, yes. Earl is too soft, man. Yeah, he's too soft. He's too soft. He's too soft. He's too soft. He's too soft. He's too soft. He's too soft. He's too soft. All right. Look, man, good looking. You know, nice holler at you all. Hopefully, I'll see you all soon. I'm going to try to check you all out this Friday, man. Oh, yeah. You know, I'm a little terrified, man. No. It's a white, black thing. No, you hang with us. I'm going to get with Psycho Mark real quick. It's good to have some of you brothers on stage with us. Hey, yo, the show's been great, man. Oh, thanks, man. Trying. Hey, well, if Chuck or any of them other cats ring y'all bell, I'll personally be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. Yeah. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to be happy to do that. I'm going to have to listen a little closer. All right, Manny, we're going to have a beer with you Friday. No doubt. All right, Manny. There he goes, Manny. Interesting. Let's go to Steve. Steve, you're next on WNEW. Hey, guys. Hi. How you doing? Good. What's up, Steve? I know what the problem is with Arl. Yeah. He's got DSB. What's DSB? Oh, deadly sperm buildup. Or deadly semen backup. Yeah. Could be. I've seen it happen before. You've got to watch these guys, man. They explode. Well, we offered him a Hummer. You know, we said we'll get him a Hummer. Well, we didn't offer him a Hummer. Not us personally. Not us personally, but we said we would get the job done for him. We'd find somebody, you know. Do you think he's gay? I don't know. We've asked him, but he gets very mad when we bring that up. And he's a virgin? Yeah, supposedly he's a 30-year-old virgin. Something's going on with him, man. All right. See you later. Thanks, Steve. All right. Enough of Arl. Vinny. Yeah, listen. Yeah? I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Thanks, Steve. All right. Enough of Arl. Vinny. Yeah, listen. Yeah? I mean, you guys are great. You guys rock. Thanks. I just don't understand what's up with Arl. If he knows who he's working with and who he's dealing with, if he can't handle it, he should just go elsewhere. Why carry a club? It's going to make everybody else feel uncomfortable. Yeah. All we asked him to do is make this little VIP pass for Friday's little gig we're doing. So like the bar knows who's who. a full sheet of paper and he's going to laminate that and make it into a big, huge VIP pass. So what do you do? Glue that to your chest? I know. I mean, you guys understand how big this is, right? Yeah, look. It'll be hanging around her neck like this. Yeah, like that. It's bigger than I... I hate you guys. Listen, one more thing. Hey, Vinny, you do the best imitation of... oh, gee, no, I can't remember. All right, Vinny. That guy. You sound exactly like him. If you don't see you guys talking, you would think it's him. Who? The comedian there, the dirty guy. Oh, Andrew Dice. Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't remember his name. That is right. It's phenomenal. That's right on. Phenomenal. All right, Vinny. But you guys rock. You're the best. And thanks for having me on. All right. Thank you, Vinny. Take care. You know, I say we just laminate these. What the hell? Would that be so funny? We'll look like dorks, Bobby. Pretty funny. It's funny. It's as big as a freaking license plate. No, you don't know what a license plate is. License plate's small. It's a piece of, like, loosely paper. You don't know what a license plate is. It's copier paper. And look at all the stuff he writes on it. ONA, Live at St. Patrick's Day, All Access, and then the date, VIP. You don't need all that. It'll look like one of those, like, 4x4 shirts you wore, like when you were 12 years old. You had the press on, a lot of iron on patch. Yeah, across the entire shirt. Huge. All right. All right, well, maybe he's working on that as we speak. You know, we wasted time with Earl, and now that girl hung up again, the girl that wants to know if she's a lesbian or not. And one of the lesbian girls coming today for that lesbian fantasy with the whipped cream and the strappies. They should be strolling in in the next hour. Nice. And I think Wayne Corbett's checking in today, Anthony. Oh, cool. I think he was so excited that you picked Hofstra in the tourney that he felt like he'd better call. It's his old school there. He's got him on the water. We'll get him on the phone as well and lots of other things to do today. All right. Cool. We'll go to the phones next. Stay there. You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now. The O.B. and Anthony Show. Thank you. 1027 WNAW. O.B. We have no reason to be here. Do I turn? And Anthony. On this appointment bed. More stupidity on the way. 1027 WNAW. Anthony, check that out. Yeah. Somebody is setting up the spaz cam. Ah. Looks like we're going to have some action today. Yeah. Some action in the studio. Why are they putting plastic on the lesbian couch, Anthony? Ah. There's going to be whipped cream and other doodads. It looks like an Italian grandmother's house in here. With the plastic on the couch. Little plastic on the couch. Is that specifically Italian, grandma? I do believe so. No? Rick is saying no. I think some Jewish ladies get into that too. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. You're Italian. Some of your relatives, plastic on the couch, Anthony? Not so much now as years ago, but I remember going over like my Aunt Mary's house years ago. I was a kid and the living room was like a roped off museum area. You didn't go to the living room. Like the kids went to this den area that had the TV in it and old couch that you'd sit on. And the adults would hang out in the kitchen and sit around the table and talk. But the living room never got used. And the couches were perfect. Never sat on. And every cushion wrapped in plastic. And they were so square. Like because the corners were never sat on. And then you had shorts on and your leg would stick to the plastic. Dude, I wouldn't even say, I never knew because I never sat on it. I never knew anyone that did sit on the couches. You didn't go in the living room. It was a known thing. They had like a phonograph in there that never got used. It was like a museum. Like you should just have a velvet rope and usher people by. Here is the typical 1960s and 70s era Italian living room. Yeah, here it is. Okay, file pass. That's what it was. The big huge console TV. And then we even had one of these. The console phonograph. The record player. You opened up this sarcophagus. Half and top. And inside was like an AMFM radio. And a record player. A phonograph. And this big 8-track player sometimes. That was one of the new ones. And these huge speakers. And all this elegant plastic looking woodwork on it. And you just raised the top. We've come a long way. All that technology we can now carry on the subway with us. That's right. And I never understand. I mean it was furniture in your living room. It's like a big furniture. Here is the big wooden sarcophagus. It's like a big coffin. Jay, what's up? Hey, what's up? What's going on guys? Talking to you. Guys that are best. Hey, thanks Jay. That plastic on the couch. Definitely a Puerto Rican thing. A Puerto Rican thing. Oh yeah. That goes right along with all the ceramic figures underneath my grandmother's TV set. I've been to a lot of houses in Dix Hill so I know it's a Jewish thing. I definitely am Italian. When was the last time you went to Harlem? Harlem? Oh, I was just there. Oh, I would have to say never. Alright, well that's why you haven't seen the blacked out couches. I feel that the blood from the shoe outs don't spill on the couch. Yeah, that's a different reason. I'd driven through Harlem by mistake a couple times. But yeah, it's a brave error in judgment. Alright, thank you. Oh my God, syndication now. Thank you. Jay's saying it's a Puerto Rican thing. Yeah, the syndication plans have been put on hold once again. We found out today. Can't really get into the story but... We're waiting. We've had a setback, ladies and gentlemen. A little setback. There was a little light at the end of the tunnel. I mean the smallest little pinhole of light at the end of the tunnel. All of a sudden a big boulder just fell in front of it again. Slight setback. The company is waiting for us to behave. Yeah. For a length of time. For a length of time. And I was talking to one of the bigwigs in the company today. Yeah. Because this one person really wants our show syndicated in a big bad way. They want it on their station tomorrow. Right. So he went to the boss and the big boss and well the big boss we found out is still really pissed at us. And so I was talking to this guy that wants to syndicate us and I go what's the problem? He goes well they want you guys to behave for a while. They're still upset about the situation. The situation. Anyway so I go what do you mean? And I have been, you know, we haven't been in any trouble in two weeks. And I'm on the phone in my office dead serious saying hey we've behaved for the last two weeks. This is all I heard on the other end of the phone. Two weeks! He screams it in his office in another city and then just starts laughing uncontrollably and I'm like what? Two weeks is good for Opie and Anthony. Well what's the problem? Two weeks. And by the end of this week it'll be three and then we're on vacation next week. So we might make a month without causing any problems. He was laughing so freaking hard and I'm like what? I'm serious. Yeah so we're going to have to kind of be good. Not like good on the show or anything. I mean we could still be bad. But we're going to have to be good. We just can't attack anyone that's associated with the company that makes more money than us. Let's just put it that way. Or else we'll get in more trouble. Which is pretty much everyone else in the company makes more money than us. But that's another story for another day. Yeah. So the syndication thing has been put on hold again. Oops. Jesus man. We've been good for two weeks. Always in it. Always bad. We are moving on from the Earl thing. The Earl incident. But Dave from Dick's Hills on the instant feedback. Does Earl think he is Urko from the Planet of the Apes? Oh my God. Oh my God. With carrying around that club. Well we were explaining how he's walking around now with the Billy Club. And I think he's trying to intimidate us a little bit because he's been taking a lot of abuse on this radio show. And Dave writes does Earl think he is Urko from the Planet of the Apes with that club? Oh my God. That's a little rough. Remember him? He was the big gorilla leader of the Apes. He had the big leather helmet hat on. The wacky helmet and stuff. And always carried a club. Could someone get Earl on the phone? I want to ask him if we could start calling him Urko if he would get insulted. If he got insulted then I will pass on that one. Earl-ko. Urko, right? Yeah. Earl-ko I think. With an L? No, we'll call him that. Earl-ko. We'll call him Earl-ko. Yeah, that's not as bad, right? Yeah. It sort of incorporates his name. Cranky-ass from Midtown writes Cranky-ass. I love when these guys have creative screen names that incorporate the show. Well Cranky-ass checking in from Midtown. Cranky-ass. What about the gold baby statues in all the Italian houses? Oh yeah. Andrew from River Edge Jersey. It's definitely not just Jews or Italians. My grandma is Cuban slash Puerto Rican and has those damn plastic covers. You know it's funny, my grandmother's house used to be like that. Where the living room portion had like the plastic on the couches and you never sat there. You went downstairs. Hung out down there as a kid. And then after a while they redid the whole house. Put carpeting, like new carpeting and redid the wallpaper and furniture in the living room. And opened it up to the family. It was like they knocked down the friggin' Berlin Wall. That's how it was. That's how we felt. You walked into the living room and was like, oh look we can sit on the couch and everything. Freedom. Freedom! Opened up the living room. Nice. Glen from Queens. Puerto Rican, Italian, what's the difference? Glen. Can we get Earl on the phone or what? He won't pick his phone up. He keeps on letting Ray into his voicemail even though he's sitting right there. Rick, could you all get on the cell phone and go into Earl's office? We want to know if... We'll tell him that we won't call him Black Earl anymore. And we want to start calling him... Erko's kind of a cool name. Erko. Erko's really hip, man. Erko, what's up? What's up? Let's go to Billy, fat guy. Billy, what's up? Guys, where are you when I need you? What? What the hell is with the radio, twat? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What do you mean? What's the problem? I'm waking up before, right, and I hear her talking about some new employee they have, and Chuckie saw it and she goes, oh, was that that big fat ass I saw walk in the halls yesterday? What the hell's her friggin' problem? Billy, you are a fat, though. Yeah, but if that gives her a right to call me a big fat ass, you know, take away those boobs and she's as fine as cooking as Darien O'Toole. Oh my God. Billy, you sound a little pissed off. Yeah, but there's nothing to her. My God almighty, don't tell me she gets on TV when she throws a bra. Was there any other fat guys walking around yesterday? Duh. I think you were the only one yesterday. Yeah, so, I mean, like, what the hell have I ever done to that little hook nose Jewess? Wow! You're really offended. Why? What have I done? I'm a friend of the show. You guys are supposed to stick up for me. Well, we have our own problems, man. We try to stick up for everybody. Oh, A2 Brutay? Yeah, you're worried about a new employee. They should hire you to make that damn show funny. Oh, wow! She would have wished I was the new employee, for God's sake. Wow, Billy. All right, Billy, honestly, I gotta let you go because Rick's in Black Girl's office. Yeah, I'm gonna go find the radio check. I had a booth in Times Square. I dropped my quarter in. Oh my God! Jesus, Billy. Wow! All right, thank you. It's interactive radio now. Okay, bye. Okay, terrific. Yeah, okay, terrific to you, too. Yeah, Spaz is checking in. What's wrong, Spaz? Earl walked out. What do you mean, Earl walked out? Remember last Friday? Yeah. Wait, Earl walked out? Why are people walking out on our show every day? Spaz, what do you think about Earl walking out on the show and his job when he has a responsibility to people here at the station? What do you think about that? No comment. Yeah. Now, where's Rick? Is he chasing him with the phone? I think so, yeah. Did he run out because Rick was berating him in front of people? I think he misguided before Rick got there. Really? Okay, thank you, Spaz. That proves Spaz is back with us. Yeah. A lot of people are really concerned about Spaz walking out on the show. Friday. Spaz walked out Friday. And now today, Urko walked out. Urko? Do you think he walked out because of the Urko remarks? I don't know. I hope not. We were going to ask him if he wanted to be called. Keith, what's up? It's General Urko, guys. He was a general. General Urko, yeah. General Urko. General Urko. And he was called Hickins. All right. Well, we're going to see if... Was that Claude Hickins? Yeah, Claude Hickins was General Urko. That guy rock. That's a good piece of trivia right there. All right, thank you. We're death to the humans. All right, Keith. Death to all humans. That guy rock. Is Rick on line six? All right. All right. Rick, who was sent to go find Black Earl. Rick, what's up? Hi, guys. Well, General Urko is AWOL. He cut out. Well, what happened when you got to his office? The office was locked. So I finally had it called Ben down here. Ben had a key, and we finally got in here, and everything's closed up and locked, like he's gone for the day. Hmm. But I did find a bunch of those passes he's been working on, and Ben's just running down with the list. Oh, boy. Oh, the VIP passes for Friday's Little Shindig we're doing? Yeah, it looked like he was in the process of maybe going to go put those together, and it's still the same freaking thing I showed you before. Oh, boy. Well, Earl's got to be around here somewhere, man. He ain't back here unless... All right. Maybe he went to the forbidden zone. Did he know you could do General Urko? That's pretty close, man. Do some more General Urko. Come on. Death to the humans! Death to the humans! That's pretty good, man. That's blasphemy! All right, Rick. There goes General Urko. He's MIA. That's too bad. We just wanted to ask him if we could start calling him that. Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Remember that one where we were hunting the humans down with the nets? You know what show uses that sound? Very similar. Who wants to be a millionaire? When the round is over, they use the woo-hoo! Oh, yeah. Woo-hoo! All right, let's go to Jamie. Hold on. Jamie, we're going to get to you next. Hold on. All right? Okay. They'll be raiding me, Scotso. Earl, that's okay. I would have done the same, but I was too drunk. We got some new Scotso clips. Oh, these are good, yeah. Where are they? We have new Scotso clips, and you remember the Oh Solo Mio one? Yeah. That was actually two separate instances that were edited and put together. We have the complete... Well, let's start with the original Oh Solo Mio, if we could. The original original? The original original. The one we've been playing. Psycho Mark went through an old computer today and found some other little sound bites from Scotso. Isn't that funny? They'd just been sitting in a computer. Which one? Yeah, okay. This is the original, Anthony. Oh Solo Mio. The lip smacking is my favorite. Anyway, we found the original of that. I guess someone put that together. This is how it really went down that day, okay? Okay. We got a couple new ones, Anthony. We're going to put this into your machine and make it as popular as okay. Yeah. This one. There's that one again. This one's one of my favorite. Ready? Really short and to the point. Wait, I'm going to start playing around with it. Oh, wait. Okay. Virgin. Virgin. Alright, you're on. We got some new sound clips to pull around with. What else do we have? Oh, yes. Oh, you guys, this is great. For all you old time WNAW fans, we found in the archives in Psycho Mark's little studio there, the only bit that Mr. Muni did. The only one ever. The only bit he's ever done. Okay. You want to listen to that now? Okay. Oh, my. Not everybody gets this for a birthday, you know, and look, there's a little ribbon tied around it. Okay, Sarah, happy birthday and come over here and sit on my lap. Oh, oh. Jesus. Hey, Virgin. Yeah, the professor. That was a dick joke. Okay. Okay. Oh, great. We got to get those into your machine so we can fool around with those, man. Oh, yeah. While we're at it, why don't we play the Anthony outtake? Oh, come on. We're going on vacation next week, so we had to do a live read for Mountain Dew. We love Mountain Dew, right? Yes. Having that huge little, that huge contest with Mountain Dew where you go to WNAW.com. Yeah. And you pick who you think is going to be in the final four, right? Yeah, so annoying Psycho Mark comes into the office on a daily basis and tells us to come in and cut some of these spots. I see. Good job. I don't see what was wrong with the last one we did. Seemed to have worked. Because the copy changes. The copy changes. It's the same thing. So Anthony really hates doing these things for some reason. He just can't get it together in there. Oh, yeah. He's a genius on the air, but when it comes to reading copy, he just has all sorts of problems. Because it's not spontaneous. It seems put on. So, you know, this has been going on for so long that we finally decided to take you to the head. You didn't know we were taking you to the head. So here's Anthony trying to read some Mountain Dew copy that will be running next week. They should just run this as their spot. It's actually running tomorrow. All right, here it is. Ready? All right, I read. Don't forget, stick your c*** in any c*** that is there and you'll shoot your l*** and blow out her f***ing uterus. Thank you, Mountain Dew. Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name. You have a one in... Hey. You have a one in four chance to win prizes like foot locker discounts, Sports Illustrated subscriptions, and 989 NCAA video games. Whatever that is. What is 989? 989 is a f***ing c***. All right, 989. Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name. You have a one in four chance to win a prize... win f***. Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game... This is great. I love doing it. Oh, you twat. Don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name. You have a one in four chance to win prizes like foot locker discounts, Sports Illustrated... I'm watching you laugh, you c***. And don't forget the Mountain Dew under the cap game called Got Name. You have a one in four chance to win prizes like foot locker discounts, Sports Illustrated subscriptions, and 989 NCAA video games. You collect game pieces with NCAA school names or wild names under the cap. Wild or matching caps... f***ing caps... Stick them in your a** and they feel really good. Wild or matching caps win, right? Is that it? Wild or matching caps win. Check out Mountain Dew packaging at your local retailer for details. So stick it up your twat. Eat my c***. Yeah, not bad. Not bad at all. Took you 10 minutes to read 20 seconds of copy. That's great. Yeah. You know, I'm so f***ing into it. It's so relatable to me. Eat my c***. Casey Kasem. Ponderous, man. It's Casey Anthony. How can I go for an uptempo number? Oh my God. Well, I gotta have Opie that goofing on me. As I'm reading it, Mark, I see him convulsing. He's laughing so hard. I'm trying not to make a sound. We knew we were going to tape it and finally put it on the air, because it's priceless when you have to do these things. Well, we want to thank the fine people at Mountain Dew for giving us two minutes of material there. I wouldn't talk either, Pally. There's a few tapes of you floating around that are pretty damn funny. I can find one of those. You got one? Oh, really? Ready to go? It's in the other room. I've got to make sure I've edited it. Oh, get it. Come on. Totally sent me down the river here. It'll take me a couple minutes to get through it to make sure all the curses are out. Is it me singing or something else? No, it's just you guys trying to do a spot. You got one of them? I got one. All right, bring it in. We'll listen to that next. But Mountain Dew, yes, given one of our listeners a chance to go to the Final Four, all you have to do is go to www.com and pick who you think will be in the Final Four, and then we're going to pick a grand prize winner. A few thousand people have already registered, and you have until Thursday, tomorrow at noon to register for the trip, okay? That's right, Opie. F'ing ponderous man. Two-two. Mountain Dew, hold on. Let me just tell Jamie to hold on. Jamie? Hey, what's up? I promise we're going to go to you right after commercials. Okay, for sure. All right, I'm sorry. Hold on. And the lady who isn't sure she's a virgin, will you call back? You keep hanging up on us. She's not sure. Oh, she's not sure she's a lesbian. I mean, a virgin, she's got a problem. No, she's not sure she's a lesbian. Call us back. We'll talk to you too. Opie and Anthony, those guys are likewits. I can drink them both under the table. Opie's Boring. Anthony's Boring. Producer Rick. Boring. Spag. Day, day, day. Opie and Anthony's show. 1027. WNEW. All right, we're back. 212757. 1027 is our phone number. Jamie's been waiting a real long time. We've got to talk to her, Anthony. And Rick working on something in the other studio. Okay. Giving you some ammunition today. Very good. Harry Sack from Hicksville checking in, Anthony. Harry Sack? Oh my God, Anthony, reading those promos are the funniest s' ever. Please put them on the website. Adam from Long Beach. Be careful, guys. Don't forget Earl is part engine and he may pop out around the corner with full war paint. Oh. Thank you. And let's say hi to Jamie. Jamie, you're on the radio show. What's up? Hey, how's it going? Good. I want to play What's in My Pants. You want to play What's in Your Pants? Yeah. How old are you? 22. 22? 22. Oh, we weren't going to play What's in My Pants today. Well, but you can play it for me. It's kind of like the Opie and Anthony J. Moore game, but I think we could have a little round here. Sure. Sure, why not? Ready? Well, describe yourself first of all. Well, I'm five foot. I weigh 105 pounds. I'm very petite. Okay. I'm 30-60. 30-60. I have dark hair. Very cute. Okay. And where are you calling from? I'm in Wanto. Wanto. Are you near Mulcaze? I'm right down the street from there. Yeah, we had a great time at that road show. I missed you guys. All right. And what? You're in your bedroom? I'm in my bedroom, yeah. Are you naked? Do you want me to be? Well, what are you wearing? Well, right now I have on some running pants. Some running pants. Running pants. Yeah, I'm without biking. Yeah, it's a beautiful day. Running pants, what do you got on up top? Up on top? I have on a white Victoria's Secret bra. Victoria's Secret bra, Anthony. All right, let's take the running pants off. All right, ready? Yep. Okay. She's taking off her little pants, Anthony. Okay. And you're laying on the bed there? Yes. All right. And you know how to play What's in My Pants, right? Of course. Okay, very good. Are you ready? Yeah, we're ready. Okay. Hey, what nationality are you? Oh, God. Hello? Hello, that was up and down. That was up and down. All right, let's go side to side. Okay. Oh, my God. Could you do a couple side to side? Okay. Yeah, back and forth a few times. All right. Wow. There you go. All right, now up and down. Sounds like she's raking leaves. No, I did it side to side and then up and down. All right, all right. Look. Do a circular motion. Okay. A few times, not just one circle. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What the hell was that? I heard some stuff in there. All right, and side to side again. Okay. All right. Ed, you want to go first? This is tough. Well, I'm sorry. I need a little more. You need some more? Yeah, now listen. Side to side, but do it like five times. Okay. There you go. All right. And it's to you. All right. Now remember, Jamie, don't give your answer until we ask you for it. Okay. Opie, I'm actually going to say wood floor because I'm going to say that. My ear is picking up that distinct sound. Psycho Mark? Psycho Mark wants to... Jiffy pop. You're talking jiffy pop. I'm thinking jiffy pop. I'm thinking massive, massive. I'm thinking it looks like you're making jiffy pop popcorn in your panties. I'm thinking like a triangle, yes. A pull rack full of Afro hair? Afro hair, sure. That's what it looks like? Yes. All right. I guess I'm the long shot here saying a wood floor, but I think a lot of that sound is skin rubbing on the receiver. So, Jamie, what indeed is in your pants? It is a triangle. Yeah! Very good. And it's not well-groomed. Yes, it is. I don't know about that. It is. It sounded like you were raking leaves. No. I thought because of the consistency of the sound over the whole area that it was shaved. I think that's what it might have been. But it's all hair. See, that's such a fine line between... It was a complete difference, dude. That sounded like an entire forest. Yeah, but sometimes the wood floor sounds like that because the sound is consistent. Yeah, plus... You know what I mean? Plus, you have it... When she went side to side, there was no like... The wood floor is a little bit more staccato. Oh, yeah? Is that it? Yeah, but you could get tricked with the wood floor if it's... Has a little 5 o'clock shadow happening. Yeah. The whole thing I was listening for was consistency. No matter where that phone was rubbing, it made the same sound. Wait, Mary's got a good line. Let's go to Mary. Mary? Yes? You're on with Jamie who just played What's in My Pants. Hey, Jamie, no offense, but you sounded like a horse blowing through her nose. That's what it sounded like. I swear to God. Wait, that was very similar. Wait, let's... Mary, as we keep you on the line here, let's compare the two. Jamie? What? Circular motions. Yeah, circular motions again with the phone. Hold on. Hurry up. What, did someone walk in your room? Yeah. No, now it's different. What are you doing? Yeah, what are you doing? I'm just painting. Yeah, rub it again. Circular motions. There's no way she's doing the same thing. I know. She's not doing the same thing, Mary, because you're right on top of it. It does sound like we have a clip of a horse. Thank you. It's actually John Elway. All right, well, thank you for that, Mary. You're welcome. All right, and Jamie, thanks for playing What's in My Pants. Yes, thank you. You did a great, great job. All right. There they go. Fantastic. Jamie and Mary, Anthony. Rick, are you set to abuse me? All right. I took a little bit of a beating there, doing the Mountain Dew spot. Seems I can't contain my vulgarities when I'm recording some of these things. Well, it's kind of weird because I was trying to put all the beeps in, and I do mean there's a lot of beeps. Yeah. It was Anthony who, again, walked away with the beep crown. Oh, really? What is this for? This is for a Connecticut school of broadcasting. I thought, you know, when I hear those commercials on any other station, you know, they're really professional, and they're smooth. This is Harry Sacks for Connecticut School of Broadcasting. You know, I'm a graduate, and you two could get into the wonderful world of broadcasting. Yeah, they sound like they're broadcasters. They don't sound like us. And they don't mess up. Okay, this could be a good one. So yeah, it's kind of interesting to see how Opie starts off frustrated, but Anthony just picks up and takes off with it. Oh, no. Oh, no. I remember this one. This one drove us nuts. Here we go, Anthony. All right. More outtakes as Anthony and I try to do commercials for our radio show. Ready yet? Here it comes. Hey, this is Opie. Hey, this is Opie. It's the new millennium. Don't wait a second longer to make the call that may change your life. What do I do, the second one? Sorry. No, I just, he just does one opening and then he just reads down the beep. Oh, I got to read Call of Connecticut School of Broadcasting? Yeah, I'll jump in. No, no, just go. Should I say this is Anthony? Because you didn't say anything. I don't like Hey, This is Opie. Hey, it's Opie and Anthony. It's the new millennium. Don't wait a second. Hey, this is Opie and Anthony. Hey, this is Opie and Anthony. It's the new millennium. Hey, hey, this is Opie and Anthony.

You should not be running through me. I can't help it if broadcasting as a troop doesn't have a f***ing sense of humor. It's like K-Y Jelly advertises a butt bang on Opie and Anton. Sorry, I don't get it. And go f*** yourself. Holy Jesus! That was supposed to get Opie? I just got hung up to try to guess. Like I said, it started off with Opie repeating his name. He's small. He couldn't get past his name. We couldn't even say our names. We're a bunch of retards. And like I said, you picked up the ball and just ran with it. Oh my God. There is literally five words in a row that are just unerrable. Like you just went bam bam bam bam bam. Everyone has done that though. You string the curses together nice. We have fun. This one was f-c-c-c-c and different c's. But back to back to back. Oh my God. That's hilarious. What happened? I think I have another one laying around. I might have to break out. Something where you lose it. I don't want to seem like the only lunatic in that studio. I like stumble all over the place, but you get mad and just lose it. I mean there's plenty of tape of me just stuttering like a freaking lunatic. You want to hear Opie a little crazy? Yeah. This is when we were at a radio station to play music. Okay. Oh, this bastard from Jersey. Oi oi, Andy Flag writes, have you two heard of hooked on phonics? You ass. You suck. Alright, when am I playing this? Yeah. Tune the best I ever did. No way. Tune the best that I can. I remember these things. When the music would be playing and we'd be coming out of a song. Opie would put the headphones on and start singing to the song. Now we can't hear it in here. All you hear is Opie singing. So what? Rick turned the mic up? I got it. Rick just cursed. I used to record so much stuff in the other room. Especially when he was singing. He used to just sing like he was a bird. Well where is it? That computer crashed and took most of it with it. I'll tell you what happened. I went on to what he was doing so after every show I went into the other studio and deleted it. That's not fair. I thought I had them all but you got a good one there. That's pretty funny. I used to have him singing Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Let me hear that one again. Come on, let me hear that again. I used to be a drummer too. Tune the best I ever did. No way. Tune the best that I can. That's pretty funny. I'll take it. That's alright. I want to hear the Connecticut School of Broadcasting clip again. That is way too funny. We have to take a quick break. Find the Valentine's Day one. You lose your mind on that one. Can anyone confirm that? We'll talk to Nick next. Nick, you're on hold. Stay there. I'll be right back. We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area. More stupidity on the way. 1027 WNEW. Diamond Vision, Dr. Philotoff. Yes, Opie. God himself advertising on the show again. Yeah. I mean what God failed at giving Opie correct vision, Dr. Philotoff fixed with his diamond vision. Corrective surgery. Procedure. There's topless girls all over the Tri-State area. A ton of people are on hold. They want to talk to us. See with my new eyes now I can see these topless girls all over the highway with their squinting. Thank God. My family thanks Dr. Philotoff because I don't make the stupid squint face anymore when I try to order at McDonald's. Where my tongue sticks out like I'm corky and my eyes go like this. I'm like, what the hell? My tongue sticks out like I'm corky and my eyes go like this. You're squinting. Not anymore. Don't have to do any of that. Don't have the glasses, don't have to squint. I can see boobs on the highway. What else can I tell you about Dr. Philotoff? The guy's done what? Over a thousand procedures, Anthony, including Lawrence Taylor's, Tiki Barber's, Sue Wicks, Dr. Philotoff. Now calling himself the doctor of the stars, Anthony. Doctor of the stars. Self-proclaimed. That's great. He's got three offices, one in Manhattan, one in Westport, and one in Greenwich, Connecticut. And one of our listeners had the procedure done. He won the contest, the last contest we did. Yeah, happy as a clam, Anthony. Dr. Philotoff roaming the earth like Jesus Christ, healing people. This guy got healed for free. Yes. He won the contest, which we're having another one now. Yeah, due to an enormous response from the Valentine's Day promotion. Why don't we ever screw up these reads when we're doing them live on the radio? Only when we get into that damn studio we start stumbling and mumbling and cursing and stuff. That's the problem I have when Mark comes in and says, you've got to go in the studio and do a spot, because it's not us, it's not natural. And they're written by the salespeople upstairs, so they try to incorporate our zenerific on-air personas. And it's like, hey, Opie, like they write a script, like we're supposed to stand there and read, hey, Opie, how about this? And you're like, well, Ant, I don't know, perhaps a rusty trombone's in order. They try to write in like everything we talk about on the show, and it comes off sounding so phony and fake that I wind up stringing eight curses together. We should read some of the scripts how they wanted us to read them. That's a good idea too. That could be funny, because then there was one where they said, okay, in the middle of the spot, Anthony could play the wacky horn right here. Yeah, okay, yeah, insert wacky horn. Oh yeah, that'll sound great. Sounds just like us on the air. That's why I go crazy. But I mean, Dr. Philotoff, how could you screw this up? It's a given. The guy is giving people sight. Well, he's running that promotion again, Anthony. He wants to give the gift of sight to one of our faithful listeners. All you have to do is contact Diamond Vision, and Dr. Philotoff is going to put you in the running for a complimentary vision correction and a free exam, Ant. If you enter the last time, this is good news, you'll automatically be entered in this contest, so you don't have to worry about that. He's got your name ready. Not everyone can afford this procedure, so this is the doctor's way of saying thank you to the Opie and Anthony fans, all right? Right. All you need now is the phone number. Very easy. 1-800-984-2020. That's 1-800-984-2020 for Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff. 1-800-984-2020. Opie, Anthony, Opie, Anthony. 1027WNEW. Fah with a fah. Fah with a fah. 212-757-1027 is our phone number. It's the Opie and Anthony show. Patiently waiting for the lesbians to show up. Another lesbian fantasy going down, Anthony. Yeah. We are breaking out the Blue Tarp for the first time here in New York. The Blue Tarp Cabaret has always been part of the ONA show. And finally, we feel it's time to break it out here. Breaking it out in New York. Basically, you put the Blue Tarp down, get lots of food products and have two girls go at it. Girls go at it on the food products on the tarp. It's wonderful. And we have set up the webcam, which is just stuck on my face. Trust me, it's going to get much better than this. But they need to focus on something until the girls get here, so can't wait for that. I hope a couple more days like this in the market and I won't have anything left to have to give half a way up. Yeah. You're admitting it, that you're getting killed today? Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy. And you, Billy, Baru. Sit down, Danny. Oh, the NASDAQ took a beating today. Down 123. I lost 10 points on one stock in two days. The Dow cranked in 320, up 320. Everyone dumped out of the tax and stuff today. What happened? Two days ago I was in the money. What happened? I can't believe it. What happened to my stock? You're screwed. I kept buying when it went lower and it just kept going lower. Let's talk to Nick, see what's going on outside TRL today. Nick, what's up? Another much, man. I turned on the TV and they're showing a crowd. Some guys hold up a black and a red wild side. Yeah. And right in front of them was this girl with a black sweatshirt, just microstucked. She lifted up her shirt. Right, yeah? Yeah. A few people are saying that. We can't really confirm it yet, but it seems like we might have got our first set of naked boobs on live TV today. Yeah, we did have a few bald midgets. Yeah, all right. Well, thank you, Nick. Okay, I'll see you guys. All right. If anyone else can confirm that, that would be nice. Carl, you're next on WNEW. O&A. Hey, man. What's going on? Talking to you. Let's go. Carl. Oh, my God. You idiot. Carl. Well, Carl wanted to say there's topless girls on Route 17. Yeah, I wanted to say that. Carl? He's laughing at himself. There he goes. What a clusterf. Jennifer, hi. How are you today? Good. How are you? Great. You're on the radio? Holy smoke. Jennifer? Oh, my God. Okay, you're on the radio. Am I? Yeah. Go. Great. I'm on the Atlantic City. I'm going to Atlantic City on the Garden State Expressway, and I want to wow somebody, but I don't see anybody with their sign up. Yeah. Well, it's early in the season. We haven't even started promoting wow. I mean, we're encouraging you... No, we're not. We're encouraging you ladies to flash. Why don't you just get some guy's attention and give them a freebie? No, but it's not as fun that way. We want some signs. Well, the signs aren't going to happen. I mean, the signs will be out in full force in late April, mid to late April. Can you do one just today for me? We said that. We said just, you know, we said to flash the guys on the highway. I have large breasts. You have large breasts and no... Jesus. She has large breasts and a lot of air in her head. Obviously, a lot of the oxygen in her blood being deposited in the breasts. Instead of... Steering clear of that brain area. Instead of the old noggin. Yes. Mike, you're next. What's up? Hello. Hey, Mike, what's up? Yeah, I was watching TRL. Yeah. And I had to go with a black sweatshirt. I lifted up a shirt for a few minutes in the background. You sure? A bunch of people calling in with that. Yeah, positive. All right. What? She was across the street? Yeah. Really? Yeah. All right, Mike, thank you. All right. All right, bye. Bye. We might have to blow off the phones today, Anthony. Oh, my God. People are a little slow today. Thank God we have some stuff happening today. Let's invite Mano in here, Anthony. She's the Pakistani chick. Mano. Anthony has a problem with Pakistanians in general at this point. Pakistanians? I don't know. What do you call them? Pakistani. Pakistani. More than one? Pakistani people. Pakistani people. Pakistanians. Not Pakistan. Pakistan. Pakistani. With Pakistani people. Pakistani people. You made a blanket statement yesterday and now you hate everything. I hate everything. I hate everything. I hate everything. I hate everything. I hate everything. I hate everything. You made a blanket statement yesterday and now you hate all of them. Well, I had such a... That's because one thing you wronged two nights ago now. I had such a crappy night a couple of nights ago waiting for a car service to pick me up and a Pakistani guy finally showed up three hours late and threw me out of his car when I got in pissed off at him. So yeah, I'm making a blanket statement. I hate Pakistanis. Okay. They're all scum. All right. They all smell. Okay. They're just dirt to me. Okay. Don't like them. And then we had mono-calling yesterday. A girl who I don't believe is truly Pakistani. And she says she could convince you into liking her and her people. Her mother and father, Iranian, and she was born in Pakistan. That's not a true... So she is Iranian. Yeah. Yeah. Don't matter where you're born. All right. Let's get her into the studio, man. Let's check this out. Hey. Hey, how you doing? There's mono. Mono. Oh, we don't have a seat for you? Here. Joey, move over because we've got to get her on the webcam. We'll put you back there. We've got to say hi to Joey. All right. Joey Paisano. Joey Paisano. Congrats. Brand new dad. He's out of hiding today. Hey, daddy. How you doing there, daddy? Joey hates when we put him on the radio, man. Keep me up to here. Keep me up to here. I saw the new picture that you might put up instead of the swamp lift picture. I'm begging you to put that one up for me. Okay. Because there's a picture of us with Jay Moore and Wayne Corbett they're going to put up in the restaurant. Ah, taking down the swamp lift pic. Mono, grab that microphone. We've got to sell that on eBay. The swamp lift picture. We could do that. eBay down 23 today. Get Rick or Ben to put the webcam on mono. Oh, boy. Hey, Rick. So what's up, mono? Well, I didn't like what Anthony said about Pakistani women. But you're not Pakistani. I am. You're Iranian. Mono, mono. My parents are Iranian. Oh, my God. Mono, here, go. Mono, first of all, I need some room. Yeah, get her some. She's crowding me. All right, get her some. I'm very frightened. Get her some headphones, first of all. Should I have frisked her for a bomb or something? And mono, by the smell of things in here, I'm assuming it's that time of the month. Whoa! Holy, holy crap. No, what is that fragrance you're wearing today? What am I wearing? Happy? Happy, it's called? Yeah, happy's a good scent if you put it on just a little bit. Happy, you got a little happy with the happy, I think. Holy cow. Do you normally wear that much perfume? Yes. Because girls that wear a lot of perfume are usually trying to cover something up. We just want to make sure you're not one of them. I just took the subway here from Long Island. I just wanted to make sure. You did? Maybe someone rubbed against. So, what's up? Hey, Rick. Hey, Ben. Hey, Ben. Hey, Ben. You did? Maybe someone rubbed against you. So, we're wrong to assume that it's that time of the month? No. You don't have... It is? Jesus Christ, man. This is a guest in our studio. I'm sorry. Regardless of the fact that she's a Pakistani hosebag, you've got to be nice because she's a guest. I just don't know when to behave. I'm sorry. And I don't believe you're a Pakistani hosebag because you are Iranian. You were born in Pakistan? What happened? I got pregnant, took a camel over the border, dropped you, and then what? Actually, both my friends are doctors. Wait, wait. Are doctors? Fixed away. Yeah, but Iranian doctors. They work with rocks and sticks. No, now they're Pakistani. I would consider them Pakistani. Why would you consider them Pakistani? Because... Pull that mic closer to you. We're having a little trouble. Mano, even though you want to... Yes, I'll have it. You're having a discussion with him, but you've got to talk into the microphone. Yeah. So everyone can hear you. So all of our listeners can hear. Right. Is that better? Yeah, but you've got to look at the mic. It's kind of hard. It's radio. Don't be afraid of it. It's not a missile coming over from Turkey. No, no. Turkish atomic bomb. Steve from Midtown, why do Pakistanis smell so bad? Oh, it's the men usually because... No, no, I'll tell you the name. See, he was a setup to a joke. See, the answer was so blind people could hate them too. I don't think that's really the way it goes. I've heard a lot of doodles. I've heard that joke another way myself. So your parents are Iranian? Actually grandparents, technically. Technically your grandparents. And then where were your parents born? Pakistan. Pakistan, ah. And then you were born in Pakistan. And they live in Pakistan or they live here now? Right now they're living in Pakistan. What are you doing here? I'm married. You're married to stay in the country? No, I married... I actually came here to visit and I was going to go back because I got a divorce from my ex-husband. Ah, were you a mail-order bride? No. No? No, my ex-husband is a Pakistani. He was a scumbag. Yeah, wow, I don't doubt it. And he can't find the Hard Rock Cafe on 57th in a car I bet too. I learned that the other day, Pakistani scum. Did he beat you? Yes, he did. He beat you? Yes. And he was very demeaning towards you? That's how Pakistanis are. They're very small penises, right? Hold on, hold on. Okay, hold on, hold on. That's a very good line, but we have to clean it up a little bit. Anthony, if you will. She said that her Pakistani man's equipment fired a little quickly. Two and a half seconds. Two and a half seconds, it was all over, huh? Oh my God. And then he'd be like, what are you still doing here? Go in kitchen. Cook me food now, you bitch. You bitch. The sick part is he's right. All right, Mano, look into the webcam because our listeners want to get a... Look at Kim. I beat you. You're a whore. Hold on, no, no. Don't move, don't move, don't move. Look right into the webcam. I don't know if they captured a good picture of you. I'm looking, wait a minute. And there we go. Keep looking, keep looking. Please hold. Keep looking. I'm waiting for the picture to change so I can see. Keep looking. In five, four, three. All right. I think we just captured one. There we go. Okay. All right, now get Ben to get the instant feedback. It's going to be... All right. Now... So you were married to this Pakistani guy and he was abusive towards you. Yeah. Beat you. How long are you married to him? Six months. Six months it took. And he had a short fuse too. See, I'm not wrong about this. She's allegedly Pakistani and she agrees with me. I agree with you. Hey, it's Pakistani Dice Clay, whore bag. Cook my food, you bitch. Okay. So he beat you and you divorced him. And now what? Now you're a citizen though? Yeah. Oh, that's all it took? No, I... There's a few bruises in Hello, USA. No, I got married... I recommend that to all foreign women. Come over here. Get married to an abusive Pakistani. You get a divorce? No, actually the way I got my... How many camels did you get in the settlement? He got a car out of it, an apartment. He got a car in an apartment and you got nothing? No. How did that happen? Because it's a dowry. He kept all the dowry. Oh, it's a dowry thing? They got that wacky little thing going on like that. Wow. All right. Who's your lawyer? I'll recommend him to someone I know. You tell me. That's a little joke. That's a little joke, right. That's a little joke. Well, Mano, you have big, huge boobs. Yeah, those are good. You could probably feed all of Pakistan with those breasts, right? You should go back home and take care of your peeps. They're living up in the mountains. Can you unzip the top a little bit there? Oh, yeah. How old were you when you came here? 17. 17. And how old are you now? 22. 22? Wow, really? What did you do over there? Something to hang out? Someone's got to work the webcam because this is getting into college. You're into college? For what? I'm a law. You're going to be a law? Yeah. I'm going to be a lawyer. Not anymore? Yeah. I like being a Long Island housewife. Ah, what, are you married now again? Yeah. Oh, look at that. To an American guy? Yeah, Jewish guy. In fact, double my age. Really? Yeah. So you got yourself a sugar daddy. Yeah, actually, I wasn't going to come in today. He's the one who's like, please go. Oh, really? Yeah. Isn't that great? You might be showing us some of your equipment. If it's for somebody else, he would say definitely no. I said, Opie and Anthony. He's like, go, go, go. I don't care. Oh, go take your clothes off. It's fine. Okay, well, that's great. Well, let's get to the taking of the clothes off. See, the American people are much better than Pakistani. Much better. So let's, I would love to see this Pakistani body she's got on her. Hey, Old Dirty, just checking in. Old Dirty will help us out with the description. Wow, she's got, look at that, right? Wow, she's got a couple of... That's good. She's got a couple of nuclear warheads on her chest. Yes, Pakistan trying to become a nuclear power. All right. I believe. Wait, what kind of bra is that? That's Victoria's Secret. Yeah, Victoria's Secret black satin bra there. Why is everyone coming to this show? Ali, what's going on? Ali, Ali, he's coming perfect time. I love how people that work at N.A.W.... Wow. Wow, look at that, huh? Very nice. Wow, wow, those are some nice, nice boobies. Those are ample. Very ample. Let's just say, very, very ample. Those are 30... 4DD. Yeah, I would have said 36DD. Very nice. Wow, I didn't expect that. All right. Old Dirty, what are you thinking? I'm going to Pakistan in Pakistan. Wow. Just putting her bra in her little purse there. Yeah, very comfortable naked. You're very comfortable naked and stuff? Yeah. Yeah? You got a big butt too, kid? I didn't run. Oh, old Dirty likes that. You got a little tat on your ankle? Where'd you get that? That's fake one. Oh, it's fake? I'm added to a Jewish guy who doesn't let me get the real one. Ah, yes, Jewish law. Yeah, you can't get no tats. No, you can't get the tats. I can make it, get naked at Opie and Anthony show, but you can't get the tat. Yes, well, there's nothing in the Torah about getting naked on Opie and Anthony show. Hey, can we play a live round of What's in Your Pants? Yes. Oh, how about that? Okay. All right. All right. We have to get to visual. We have to decide, we have to figure out what she has in her pants. Without even hearing anything just by looking? Oh, yeah. All right, well, hold your arms out a minute. Not much hair on the arms? No, not much hair on the arms. You shaved your arms? Yeah. Oh, that's a good one, Opie. Okay. Now, why do you have to shave your arms? Is this a secret? Look at Harry. You're showing me. What is she showing? Oh. She shaves everything. Wait a minute. She's got like... There's some like hair going down her lower back. Wait, turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Oh, okay. I'm willing to say. Now, wait a minute. I got to ask you this. Mano, do you shave your most intimate of areas? Yeah. You do? Okay. Now, there's a lot of hair on that back there, Mano. Yeah. You can't reach back there with the razor? My husband shaves me. He does? Why? Because he's got hair on the back like that? Yeah, he does. He likes that? Something to grab onto. Wait, let me ask you. He's a sick M.F. Wait. So, all right, so he shaves... And this is coming from a girl that had a Pakistani beater for six months. So she... He shaves all the other hair off your body except for the hair on your lower back. Yeah. Interesting. Let me see your arms, come here. I got to see. When did you shave? Oh, she does. Look, she does. She shaves her arms. She's got like razor stubble. There's like razor stubble. I was looking at your arms going, they're remarkably unhairy. And now it makes perfect sense. Now she's covering up. Oh, you don't have to cover that up. Actually, I don't like this. Oh, why? Why? Well, point the camera high then. Point it high. Get a face shot. Don't worry about that. If she doesn't want to be on the webcam, we can't force her, so. No, because if my uncle finds out, I'm dead. All right, no problem. Literally. We've got a head shot of you. As long as you don't jump up and down, you'll be okay, all right? Okay. Okay. Can we show everyone the hairy back, though? That's kind of cool. Okay. All right, turn around. Turn around. Because the people on the hairy back. On the other end of the room. Pull it down a little bit so we can see. Wait, get some light on the hairy back. Yeah. Hold on. All right. Put it down on the counter there on the console so you don't shake it a little bit with your hands, Rick. I want to pull her panties out. Rick. I got first getting a tight fit. How does that look for you? If we get a little more light on her back, it'll work much better. You got a hairy buffalo butt, don't you? He's got a real hairy buffalo butt. Move your hand. Move your hand. Does he shave your ass, too, like your cheeks? No? No, that's perfect light right there. Is there hair on your butt cheeks, too? Really? You haven't seen your ass in a while? Buffalo. Wow. I'm trying to look at the pictures that are popping up here, but I'm getting some kind of an abstract Picasso thing going on. You sure you never dated Opie like 20 years ago? All right. Easy on that. Hold dirty. Get out of her life. That's it. Hold dirty. Get out of her life. Look at that. It's perfect. Let me see it. Let me see what it captured. Oh, yeah. That's all we need. All right. Very good. That's all we need. Okay. So that's Mano's hairy lower back. All right. I'm guessing, but she says she shaves. So I'm going to say that before shaving, it is the president of Pakistanis head in a leg lock. That's what I'm saying. I'm going to say, and don't answer, I'm going to say wood floor. Wood floor. I have to say that there's not enough hours in the day to keep the hair off this lady's body. All right. Fred Flintstone's mouth. Fred Flintstone's mouth. Oh my God. You know how he's got that perpetual five o'clock shadow? Let me think. That's funny. No, I got to go. I got to go to natural. Natural shape. Triangle. Can I try, man? I'm going to value a guess at Robin Williams in a serious role. Ah, the beard. Yes. Yes. Okay. Anyone else want to guess? Anyone else? Joey. Second Mark wants to go. I say wood floor. I'm going to go with that. He's saying wood floor. Who said wood floor? Psycho Mark. Psycho Mark. Wood floor and O'Day. It's stubbly down there. Stubbly but shady. Okay. All right. It looks like a wood floor with splinters. It looks like a wood floor with splinters. Okay, O'Day. Good way to put it. All right. All right. I guess, Mano, if you would let us see what you got in your pants. Oh. Wow. Look at those big, huge breasts. She's got tiny little black panties on her. Before you show, turn around. I got to see her butt. Yeah, there's some...wow. Wow. There's some hair right on your ass. There's somebody who's sporting some hair on that ass. He likes it that way. Her man likes it that way. All right. She is out of her pants. She's wearing a little... What are you talking about? She's got... ...skeen panties there. O'Day's digging this. Sure. She can chew off that cellulite. All right. She can chew off that cellulite. All right, Miss Pakistan. Let's pull this out. All right. All right. All right, Miss Pakistan. Let's pull this out. All right. Let's pull out the pants. Let's see what you're sporting. Okay. It's a wood floor. It's a wood floor. It's a wood floor. Let me say, yeah, no, it's a wood floor. It's got some five o'clock shadow, though, Anthony. When did you have that shaved? Two days ago. I would say noon. That's two minutes ago. Let me see. Turn around. I got to see this. No, the other way. I got to see what you're sporting. Yeah, see? She's totally shaved. Yeah. I win. You win, Anthony. Now, let me tell you. Riddle me this back. I'm going to tell you what you're sporting. I'm going to tell you what you're sporting. Riddle me this, Batman. If you didn't shave, it would still look like you were wearing black bikini panties, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. Even when you're not wearing panties, it looks like panties. No. Crazy hair growing on you, girl. Grip from Jersey, Anthony. I'm going to touch my head here. Yeah. See how thick it is. Very thick? Well, yeah, see? Very thick. Very thick hair. Very thick. Very thick. Very thick. All right. Look at that ass. He's got so much hair on that thing. That's a hairy... Chewy. Chewy. Chewy. Chewy. Chewy. Chewy. Very nice, Anthony. Grip from Jersey. She's a co-star with Black Girl and Planet of the Apes. Yeah, she does have a hairy ass, too. Wow. All right, Pakistan. Very impressed with the body there, mono. Thanks. Does she grant me three wishes? Does she come from that country? That's all... That's Baghdad. Baghdad. Oh, Baghdad. Baghdad. You remember the place we bombed the living crap out of a few years back? Sure. Very nice. Would you like to have a lesbian experience where we're breaking out the... I'm bisexual. Oh, yeah? Wow. Would you like to be part of the Blue Tarp Cabaret? Yeah. Oh, very good. Look at this. Where can I find the... Jesus Christ, she's open to everything. Can we train you? How about that? Okay, terrific. Well, very nice. We've got to thank mono for stopping by the studio. Very impressed. No problem. Anytime. That's something. Wait, Kenny's trying to make some kind of thought here. Kenny, what's up? What's up, Iwona? How you doing, guys? Good. Real good. Big long-time listener, show. Love you guys. You're the best. Hey, thanks. Listen, mono, you're from... So big. Why the hell is gas prices so high here in America? I have no idea. Well, help us out. You got monster oil cans. Help us out. Oil cans. Actually, if Pakistan does not produce oil, is Iran that does? Iran. Iran. Iran. Iran? Yes. Oh, so, you know, I was thinking, you know, you could help the guys out there, help us out here. Yeah, it's just way out of control. She's got some nice hooters there, Kenny. Does she? I can't get her up on my webcam. Oh, shot, I don't know what's going on. Big and firm there, so... Should maybe we... This guy's got a good idea on instant feedback, maybe later on. Have somebody run down to Dwayne Reid, grab one of those little electric shavers and maybe Spass can shave her ass. Would you allow someone to shave your ass today? Not with an electric shaver. No, why not? Just a regular... A razor? Like a Bic or something? Yeah. Okay, and put a little, like, cream on there? No, I don't like cream. No, just a dry shave. Like the dry rub on that ass. All right, get a Bic shaver or something. We should make Stinky do it. Yeah, Stinky, the new intern, and if he nicks you, he's got to suck the blood out. All right, now we've got to take a break, all right? But Mano's going to hang out. A couple more girls showing up in our house. All right, what a day. Very impressed there. This week we could win another broadcasting award for this show today, I think. We're bridging gaps. That's what we're doing. Bringing countries together here on the Opie and Anthony show. Opie and Anthony. Well, you guys are both stupid. You're like a black eye for all mankind. I don't think they're very nice people. The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be done harrowing. Opie and Anthony. You know, I just, like, want to throw up. Feel the love. 1027 WNEW. Old D, working it with Mano, man.

She's a married woman. 36 double D's, nice body, but she has a hairy back. Someone came in with a razor, an electric razor that she approves of. Wow, that's a good one, huh? And we're going to have, I guess, Stinky shave her hairy ass. Stinky's got to shave her hairy back and ass. Because she really has a hairy ass. Yeah, the rest of her has no hair. She shaves her arms. She shaves it off, and then she's a wood floor up front, so it's already shaved. The hair on your arms must come in real dark that you're shaving it, huh? Yeah. It's like a man's hands. Like a man's hands. Holy smokage. Stinky, get over there. Oh, I got an idea. I don't think Stinky should do this at all. Me and Joey were talking and... I'm not shaving the chicks better. We throw in a nice Genesis song and maybe you can exile some of these demons. I was never into the hairy woman thing. I just happened to lose my virginity to a girl that had a hairy mane that went from the top of her back down to her balloon knot. NERPY! NERPY! Mano, have you heard that story yet? No. Yeah, I lost my virginity to a girl. She was really hot, and then I turned her over and she had a mane that went all the way down her back. Was it a horse? No, it was a wookie. It was a wookie, yeah. So, no, I will not be shaving asses and hairy backs today. Who let Stinky do it? Yeah, let Stinky get over there. The clone of Spaz. He looks like Spaz's cousin is what he looks like. No, he's a Spaz clone, yo. They've been cloning the pigs and stuff. We already got the human thing taken care of. We cloned Spaz already. Doesn't mano mean man? Mano? Isn't that like mano-y mano or something? Mano's one. I thought it was a disease. Manonucleosis? I got mano. All right, well, we're going to have your ass exposed over here. Maybe lean up against the wall in the frisk position. She's got to bend completely over the chair. Over the chair, that's a good idea. Are we allowed to put any of this on the webcam, as long as they don't see your face? No, don't put my ass on there. Listeners love it. No, huh? No. No hairy ass? I'll tell you outside, I can't take it. Alibaba. All right, once you get naked again. You want me to get naked again? All clothing must be removed. It's better that way. It is better that way. There's only 20 guys in the studio. That's okay. Usually there's only three. I wonder why there's 20 guys in the studio. Can you leave me alone? I'll kick you on that belly, baby. Oh, D's digging you. Oh, D, will you talk into a mic? No one can hear this stuff. Old Dirty, talk into the mic. Hi, son. What are you digging about her? Pakistani. He likes her. Yeah. Pakistani in the panties. You have a lot of the brothers coming on to you and stuff? Yeah. Oh, yeah. You're a black-eyed dream. I just had problems while trying to come upstairs. Really? You are. You're like a black-eyed dream, man. You got an ample ass on you. Call me crazy, but I think Old Dirty wants to make a map of India on her stomach. I want to do the whole pack rim on that ass. All right. Those are some really nice breasts, I must say. Yeah, sure. I know they're real. I can tell. All right. You got to bend all the way over. Don't want to lose that. Yeah, lose the top. Sure. It's just us in here. You don't want to get hair all over it. Chris from Belmore writes, have Spaz and Stinky each shave one ass cheek and then compare the work they did. Yes! That's good. No, no, get Spaz in here, because this is going to be funny. Because Spaz is Stinky's boss, unofficially here. Spaz, I want you to walk Stinky through the process here. I'm shaving a girl's ass and lower back. Actually, take your clothes off of that chair and then turn the chair so the back is facing the wall. And now lean right over that chair so you're hanging over it. Yeah. Now someone might... Oh, yeah, definitely. Like you're laying down. Okay. Like you're laying down. No, other way. That was like looking at an eclipse. Yeah, there you go. Like that, yeah. So you're a little more comfy. Yeah, that's much better. Just lean over. I don't need to look at that eclipse again, man. I was like standing at the sun too long. All right, hold on, Spaz. Stinky. Yeah, now you're going to have to pull the back of that thing down a little bit. Yeah, wait, wait, we got to expose lower back and ass. Anthony, we got to mic Spaz. Just ass cheek, no lower back? Yeah, he likes that, huh? All right, they can still shave her ass. Just ass cheeks. All right, give Spaz a mic. Spaz, grab that mic. Move the other mic down toward her so we can maybe get some sound here. All right, Spaz, walk your employee through the process of shaving a girl's ass, shaving her ass. Okay, now you never want to go side to side. So basically you can go up or down. It's better so you can clip the hairs up so you can catch your face. Yeah. You get a closer shave that way because if you clip it down you might miss the root of it. So you just want to start slowly just go up. And just go make an outer edge for you so it's like coloring in between. All right, now do you understand where the blade is on that razor? Yeah, that's like the trippy, the clippy thing. There you go. You were doing good. You were doing good. You were doing good. I don't think you're using that razor properly. Spaz, get in there, man. He's doing something wrong. You've got to put a little pressure in there, right? Don't move. Hey, don't cut him. You want to put a little pressure down in there, okay? Go back down a little bit slower. It's like paint the fence, okay? Paint the fence. Yes, stinky son. Black zone. Yeah, that's it. Okay, now you're going to have to come up with a new one. Here's stinky son. Wax on, wax off. Hair on, hair off. They are shaving Mano's ass. Up, down. Up, down. No circles. No circles. All right, stink. Well, did you see that big thing of hair that just came off? Even strokes. Very good. Good job. Now, Mano, he is getting towards it. Did you see that big clump of hair come off? That's great, man. Yeah, a big clump of hair just came off our ass. Someone grab that. We'll make a sweater. Now, Mano, he is getting close to maybe an erogenous zone. I only shave that part. Yeah? But I mean, are you feeling any pleasure from the vibration of the razor? Come on, you shave. Yeah? Oh, Spaz, you're pulling my goddamn headphone out. Thank you. Jesus Christ. Well, Spaz is trying to get in there to make sure Stanky's doing the job. Look at the hair that's coming off of that ass. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's good, but it is taking the hair right off. Get right close to a butt crack. There you go. There you go. Yeah, shave the station's call letters into our ass. Oh, my God. Did you hear that? The razor was binding up like a lawnmower in wet, tall grass. I think it's time to empty the bag. Whose bag? That's good. All right, Spaz. Let me look at his work on this cheek. Turn toward the light. All right, let me compare. Oh, yeah, you could definitely tell. It's one of those, it looks like one of those white-black cookies now. You need, yeah, a little more. The black and white cookies that you used to get at the Walt Whitman mall. Yeah, there's a... That's it. It looks like a half moon now. You know, you're not very economical time-wise, Stinky. Really shave that ass. I don't want to hurt her. You're not going to hurt her. It's an electric razor, for Christ's sake. Look at it. It's like a horse. Yeah, see? Like a horse. Yeah. It'll whip you with a tail. Look at that hair. Pop a couple of those zits while you're at it. Oh, man. Oh, B, she's got half an ass to go. You don't want to walk it out like that. I'm sorry. Come on. Other ass cheek. There's no zits. It feels good. It does not. Yeah. Yeah. A pockmark's a couple of miles. Rub that ass, Stinky. Rub her cheek there. How does that feel? Good? Nice and jiggly. Good. Nice and jiggly. You're in for smoothness. Not jiggleness. Oh, Anthony, this just in. Yeah? This just in the shaver courtesy of shavers.com. Oh, good. There you go. Everything on this show has a partnership. Oh, look at that piece of hair. Wow. Holy crap. There is some hair on that ass. And Spaz is pointing at Stinky going, don't forget that spot over there. Don't forget that. You have to shave around your nips? That gets hairy? Hold the phone. All right, hold the razor. All right, hold on. Turn this way. Turn around. I want to see the nipple razor stubble thing. Okay, come here. Let me see. You can't see it because I shaved it over there. All right, but I'm trying to look for some stubble. Oh, yeah. Whoa. There is a hair. Holy smoke. Bend over again. Stinky is almost done with his shaving here. This is taking forever. I don't know why the Jewish guy, he's bald and he's slugging his hair. Oh, Stinky. Stinky is really getting in there. Getting right in the crack there. Right in there. This is hilarious. A little bit here too. Yeah, Spaz is pointing at where Stinky should be. Just pull the G string a little. It's not lower back hair. Don't get that. Her husband likes that. No, not there. No, not there. Just crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Crack down. Cracking down. Just below the crack. Don't go above the crack. It will piss off the husband. Give them something to hold on to. Spaz, does Stinky doing a good job down there? Right in there. Yeah. That's right in the action spot, isn't it? Okay, that's it. Don't get any closer. Oh. Yeah. We almost got into the forbidden zone. Damn. Damn. She's a monkey woman. My God. You weren't throwing rocks at a shepherd the other day because he wouldn't give you water, would you? No. Okay. Just making sure. Well, what else can we do? I mean, we... What else can we do? Let's chop her up and put her in a 55-gallon drum. They'll be here. I think the lesbian girls heard you on the radio and they're running away. Let's see. Oh, my God. Look at the hair. Get out of here. Let me see. Okay, get it. Get a little... Oh, my God. We'll vial and save that and we'll give it away as a prize. It's the Pakistani ass hair. We give away everything on this show. We share with our listeners. You know, and I think if you smoke it, you'll get a good book. Yes. Hey, dude, I got some Pakistani... Herb? No, ass hair. All right. They are documenting the ass hair, Anthony. All right. Well, it did... Look at that. It did take the hair right off her ass. I am amazed. Someone thinks you're a man. Let's go to Nick. Nick, you're next on NAW. Hey, how are you guys doing? Good. I think about it. She's really hairy. She likes women. That's a man. All right? Also, you should take that hair and make a wig out of it and make spas wear it. There's a lot of hair there. We could definitely knit a little baby sweater for Joey. Love you guys. Kind of bare in the air, right? Take care. Bye-bye. Stop right there. Well, I didn't get your present yet. Leave my daughter at it. Okay. All right. Let's go to... Lee, you're next on NAW. Oh, man. Are you guys playing Let's Make the Audience Pugue over there? Holy cow. We were doing a public service. That is disgusting. We shaved her hairy ass. Lee, you should have saw the hair flying off her ass. I don't want to think about it even. It's disgusting. What does Chuck Hessen think about it? I don't know. Chuck is in love with it. He's in love with it. He's in love with it. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. Oh, Chuck isn't here today, Lee. Oh, I'm sorry. That's all right. OK, terrific. All right, thank you. Anything else we could shave there? No, I think so. You got everything. I want to shave the back hair. So bad. But your man will get pissed. Can we get him on the line? Oh, I'm asking. Can we call him up and ask him? My husband. Yeah, call him up and ask him. Here. Get Rick. Rick will call him, or Ben, or one of the guys. Yeah, get him on the phone. OK, I just dumped out of that. We had to dump out. She just said, but we're the guy who works. That wouldn't be too cool. No. There's 30 people on hold at her, though. Oh, my god. Bono, you weren't on the Discovery Channel Sunday night, were you? The wooly mammoth. The wooly mammoth. She was encased in ice. In the ice. That's what it was. It was Bono. She's a very nice girl. She really is. She's just very hairy. The boobs help her out, though, right? You see how just topless? She's got a very ample set of boobs and an ass to match. Oh, Jesus Christ. All right, this is what we're going to have to do. We're running late, Anthony. Yeah. We're going to take a break. We have nothing better to do, so we're going to get Bono's husband on the line. And see if we could shave her back hair. Yeah, because the back hair is getting way out of control. Yeah. OK, so we'll be back. Stay there. The OP in Anthony's show. Oh, T.O.P. Wow. Boo boo boo. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Or stupidity on the way. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, W, W, W. We're in the middle of commercials, but I got to go to line nine really fast. All right. And say hi to Michelle. Michelle, what's up? Hi. How are you, Michelle? I just want to let you guys know that I figured out who was the gorilla holding the sign on Channel 2 News. It was the girl you're shaving down. You know, back in the 80s, they used to call her a gooney goo goo. Gooney goo goo. I like that, Michelle. Thank you. She's nasty. OK, thank you. All right, bye. Aw, you don't have to insult her. Well, Mono. She's just hairy. She's a nice enough girl. Mono, you weren't the gorilla on Channel 2 two days ago, jumping up and down with a wow sign saying, OK, terrific on live TV, right? Definitely. You can't confirm that? OK, thank you. Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Yes. It works. You know? You've got to lose some weight. You've been packing on the pounds. Stacker 2 will burn the fat off. World's strongest fat burner. Also, it cuts down on the cravings to snack during the day. And it gives you boost energy. Everything you need to lose weight with Stacker 2. Isn't that right, Opie? Yeah, I'm just there. There was a subway shooting today. I'm just hoping it's not my subway. It was 59? Holy crap. That's the subway I take every day. Anyway, Anthony, yeah, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Yeah. If you want to give it a shot for yourself. A shot, hello.

Channel 7 news. Where is he? A guy possibly with a wow sign. Come on. A dead bird. Where are you? What was he waiting for? All right. Perfect opportunity. There's the dead bird. That's good. A dead bird is one of the lead stories on the news. Well, the West Nile virus, Anthony. It's back? The giant mosquito? Oh, no. Spaz the giant mosquito from last year? They're already finding dead birds and stuff. Damn. Not a good sign. It's going to be a scary season. Anyway, all right. We're in the middle of commercials. We'll break in if there's anything happening with the Psycho Mark psychopaths out there on live TV today. All right. Opie and Anthony. What other radio show is going to give you intelligent talk about stocks and girls playing what's in my pants? Yeah. Opie and Anthony Show. 1027 WNEW. Well, Anthony. Hey. We have an interesting afternoon happening here. We got Mano in the studio. She is a Pakistani girl. She's Iranian. Yeah, I still think she's Iranian. Her parents are from Iran. She was born in Pakistan. So you make up your own mind. We just shaved her ass. Yeah, she's got a lot of body hair. That's kind of a common thing with women that come from that area of the world, right? They're all haired out and stuff. And she shaves her genitalia into a wood floor. Just completely shaves it. And then we found out she also shaves her arms and around her nips, which grows a lot of hair. And then she takes all that hair and she glues it to her back, I think. Well, her husband likes the hair on her lower back, which is very hairy. And then she has a very hairy buttocks, which Stinky just took an electric razor to and shaved. And we actually saved the hair clippings. I hear we're going to vial it up and give it away at one of our road shows. We're going to give it to a couple stoners and see if they get high by smoking it. Do you know when you see them shaving sheep and it just comes flying off? Yeah, it comes falling off the razor. That's what it was doing. It was falling off the razor. Fabulous. Let's see. Well, we have Mano's boyfriend, husband on the line. This isn't the Pakistani guy that beat her that she divorced after six months of matters. This is her new husband. Her Jewish husband who likes the hair on your lower back there. All right, what's his name? Chuck. Chuck. Wait, Spaz is saying one moment. Spaz is writing me a note. I'm writing. Spaz is writing. He's writing. Dear Shanta, for Christmas I want a new slide. I want a bike. All right, Spaz wrote, lost call trying to call him back. Lost call. Aw. All right. Wow, how that happens. Well, Rick's calling your husband back. Let's go to Bobby in the meantime. Bobby, what's up? What's going on, guys? Hey. Having fun with Mano and her hairiness today? I shaved her back in Iraq and put it on eBay as a chia pet. Yeah, you're like a living chia pet. Like a chia. And water washing clay. Yeah. And chia Pekistan-y ass. And she's from Iran or wherever she's from. So, I mean, we're watching it grow as we look ahead. The chia pet. We're hoping to get plenty more blades to save her ass again because this is going to keep on growing. Yeah, that's pretty good. Well, thank you, Bobby. Take it easy, guys. Yeah, is your ass getting any stubble on it already? No. It has been like 10 minutes. I've never shaved my ass. Never? Close, Frank. Ah, yeah. No. That was... You usually don't shave it? What, do you do style it? No, I just leave it alone. Before we shaved your ass, I thought you were a black woman. Oh, my God. Frank. Yo. How are you? What's up, open Anthony? Good. I think they should have put aftershave on and see how sensitive she is. Well, it wasn't a blade razor. It was an electric. Yeah, it still gets sensitive, though. You just saw the hair flying off. I can imagine. We're stalling. We're trying to get her husband on the line here. Oh, okay. Well, thank you, Frank. No problem. Okay. Take care, guys. Bye. Bye. Great. Wow, that's hard to believe. You've never shaved your ass before? No guy has ever said shave your ass or anything? Let's go to drunk Rob. Spaz wrecked another segment. Yo, what's up, O&A? Is he going to walk out? Is he going to try to find her out? He wrecked another segment. Spaz totally ruined this segment. He hung up on Mano's husband by accident. Now we can't get Mano's husband back on the line. I'm walking out. Drunk Rob, what's up? What's up, O&A? How are you? Yo, I wanted to know why O.D. wanted to pick up Chewie so bad with a heavy man ass. What's up with that? Yo. Yeah, real fast, O.D., because we got our husband back on the line. Why do you want to pick her up? It looked good, son. You're going to shout a big B. Like that heavy man ass or something? Heavy man ass, my man. I think old dirty is missing prison. You're still saying it's a must-have. That's it. I'm walking out. That's the new thing now. People are just walking out. Is that the new thing on this show? People used to be able to take the abuse on this show. Now they just walk off the shelf. Now everyone feels like they're superstars or something. I'm walking. I should work with that man. All right, listen, we've got to talk to Mano's husband. What's his name again? Chuck. Chuck. Hey, Chuck, what's up? How are you doing? Hey. You're a Jewish guy married to Mano. Absolutely. Boy, what an ass. Mano's is tough. She's a very sweet girl. Thank you. I think so. She's got some nice, nice, ample breast day. Absolutely. But my God, hairier than a baboon. Unbelievable. Now Chuck, first of all, how long does it take you to shave her down? Well, it depends on her mood. Yeah. Are you usually in charge of the shaving? Most of the time. Yeah? So you like shaving her down. How many times a day do you have to shave her? Actually, it's like once every two days. Yeah. Once every two days? It's a lot of fun. We're very creative. It's an event. Very creative. You guys don't have time to do anything else, huh? No, absolutely not. So you shave her arms? Arms, armpits, legs. You need to shave. Wow. All right, let's name all the body parts that you shave on Mano. Arms, armpits. Arms, armpits. Around the nip. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That mustache she got. No, she don't have a mustache, do you? I wax it. She waxes it. Oh my God. Wow. I'm going to shave. There's not enough wax in the world to take care of that butt. Do you have that? Do you have that? Do you have to get rid of the hair that sometimes goes from the woman's belly button down to the... Occasionally. You can change blades for that. Wow, sometimes you've got to change blades? Absolutely. Go through about two or three blades. Oh my God. Do you shave her shoulders, Chuck? Occasionally, yes. Okay. Yeah, shoulders back. You get upper back hair sometimes. All right, side back. But it's a lot of fun, yes. Wow. You know what you should do? You're a Jewish guy, right? Uh-huh. You should let her grow her genitalia out and then make little peyas on the sides and put a big hat on her and let her walk down the Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. Okay, I got it. That would be great. I got to go. You got to go? I got to go. Well, we got to ask you a quick question, Chuck. Go ahead. We really, really want to shave her back, but we hear that's, I guess, a turn-on for you. You don't want her to shave her back. Not really. No, that's my forte. Yeah, you like that right above her butt. She's got that tough to hair. Why do you like the hair there, Chuck? I can't tell you right now. I got to go. My boyfriend is running. Okay, fine. Don't lose your job. Don't lose your job, Chuck. I love your show. Thank you, Chuck. Great show. Shalom. Take care. Bye-bye. There goes Chuck. There he goes. But obviously, he doesn't want us shaving that, um, that's too bad, that thatch of hair. You can look at Opie's face and tell him he wants to shave it so bad. I know. Look at him. You are absolutely right, Mano. He's really looking like, God damn it, how can we shave it back? Because it's bringing back some horrible nightmares. Oh, he said, he said, we can't shave it. Yeah, I know. Now we can wax it. Or dare. I want to wax his back. He won't let me. Oh, really? Is he a hairy guy? No. No? But I want to do it for fun. What the hell is going on in your household? What's going on at the... What else do you guys do for fun? I don't think I'm allowed to say on the radio. Oh, God, I can only imagine. This is what happens when Jewish and Pakistani people get together, yo. That drain in the bathtub must look like a barbershop floor. Right? When you get out of the shower? Definitely. Yeah. I don't doubt it. All right. All right, Mano. Well, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to shave the lower back hair. It means our hubby kind of digs it. Like riding bareback. You know, you grab onto that piece of mane right by the withers and you hold on to it. Listen, yeah. Hold on tight and yee-haw. Let her rip, man. Hey, Matt, you're next on W-W. Hey, Matt. Hey, what's up? You're next. What's up? I was just wondering, oh, you're the extra. I want to know whether her ass look like big red ape ass or wookie ass. It looked very furry. Yeah, it was just a fuzzy, like a peach. Like a fuzzy peach, yes. That's a good way to look at it. Fuzzy peach. Yeah. It was totally covered in hair. That's cool. You like that? You guys sure didn't do a favor to society. Yes. It's baby soft now. Yes, we did. It is baby soft. We got it nice and smooth. We got baby gorilla soft. You guys are nuts. All right, Matt, thank you. Bye. That's shotgun from land of the lost soft. All right, Anthony. Well, Mano, why don't you take a break? Uh-huh. Joey from Pizano brought some great food. We're hoping a couple girls come down for the blue tarp cabaret. We're having a little problem with that. But if they don't show up, what's the problem? What's the problem? The problem is that they're not showing up. They're not showing up. They're not showing up. They're not showing up. Check that. Yeah, because we had a couple girls coming down to jump on the blue tarp today. I would like that. And we're supposed to do strap-on. Does our GM, Kenny, want to check out Mano? After all the abuse. Does our GM want to check out Mano's smooth ass? Can you show our boss your smooth ass? It's a chick. He doesn't believe it. He's walking down the hall shaking his head. Someone goes, someone goes, it's a chick. Come on. And he goes, I don't believe you. I don't believe you? And then he walks away. Oh, man. We were trying to share with the new boss. New boss. We want to like bond with him or something. He looks distraught. He's walking down the hall shaking his head like, I don't believe you guys. It doesn't sound like a good thing. I don't believe you guys. I don't believe you guys. I don't believe you guys. I don't believe you guys. I don't believe you guys. I don't believe you guys. He's walking down the hall shaking his head like, I don't believe you guys. It doesn't sound like it's a chick. What did he say? He doesn't believe us. I don't believe you. I haven't been listening. I'm not coming in. He's not coming in. All right. So check out some of the fine food from Paisano. Okay. We're going to see if the girls are here and we'll have you back in a little later in the program. But before we go to spots, a bunch of people call and they want to hear the Anthony bloopers one last time. Oh, why me? Okay, here we go. All right. Here's the what's up guys from yesterday. Hey, Opie and Anthony. What's up? Let me understand then. Whenever I'm in New York, I listen to my two favorite guys, Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. Opie. You come. And Anthony. Your new name is Dick. Opie and Anthony. What changed you into such a demonic little bastard? 1027. Hey guys. W-N-E-W. All right. It's the Opie and Anthony show. Absolutely another mess going on today, man. Yeah. You can tell we're a few days away from taking a week's vacation. It feels like Friday already. Just kind of goofing off. Friday's our last show before vacation. And we started a tradition around Christmas and we're going to continue that. On Friday, we're going to do the last hour of the radio show with cell phones from a local bar. I want you guys to hang out with us, have a few beers with us, say hey. You know, we'll throw some stuff out and then we're going to go on vacation. Right? That's fine. So we don't want to announce the place because we don't want you guys to expect too much from us because it's not like a road show. Yeah. It's just us hanging, drinking beers with everybody on Friday. And it's going to be St. Patty's Day on top of that so it should be a lot of fun. So, uh. Paisano Fried Ravioli. I know. You're killing me. This is crazy. I can't do the show. I can't do the show while I'm eating. But I can put these down. Very good. So on Friday, we'll announce where we're going to be. Yeah. So if you're in the area, come on by and say hi. It's within two blocks of the radio station, which is 57th and 7th, all right? Oh boy. So now here's the problem. I opened up the fried raviolis, right? This happened last time. Now the show is on so I can't eat them. Everyone comes filing in and grabbing the goddamn things. Then we go to break and there's none left. No one touches the rest of these. Uh-uh. You think I was angry in that Connecticut school of broadcasting spot? You're getting very orc. Get out of here. Get out of here. No. No. Mike. Oh. Look at this. Come on. Double dip. Double dipping in your sauce. Double dipping in the sauce. Oh, Jesus. All right, that's really bad. Oh. I had to dump out of myself. Oh my God. That's it. That'll be an outset. I know. It's like bringing a goddamn supermodel into prison. No matter what you say, she's getting banged. That's it. Great. No sauce because Psycho Mark double dipped. That's a great one. There you have it. I licked everyone. Okay, listen, Psycho Mark, oh, good. Okay, fine. All right. She's a hot Iranian woman basically. I used to think this stuff was Pakistan. Her parents had her in Pakistan, but her parents came from Iran. Yeah, a little bio. She was married to a Pakistani guy who was real scumbag. Beg beat her. Took two seconds in the bed. Didn't pleasure her and she divorced him after six months. She's now been married to a Jewish guy for over a year. And we were talking a little earlier about her preference in men. And she goes she would never go out with another Pakistani guy, obviously turned off to the Pakistan because of the beating and the lousy sex. She also said she would not go out with Hispanic guys. And what was your reason for that? What did you say before? They're scary. They're scary and what else? In what way? And they hardly pay for anything. They hardly pay for anything and they're scary. So at this point, hold on, Odé, hold on. He's freaking out in the corner. At this point, old dirty lays into her like he's disrespecting me in front of my peeps. How dare you say that? And he's authentically pissed. So now he's like ragging on Mano and really mad. Now, old dirty, would you like to rebut what she said? I never said old dirty doesn't pay. I'm just... You look me in the face and told me, all right? You told me right here, my man, Joey, hold me, man. Hold me back, hold me back. All right? You told me that my people's Latino men, all right? What a hot property right now, baby. You know what I'm saying? You can't have none of this. Yeah, with other men. Yo, yo. Ricky Martin. What the fuck was that? Well, I'm just saying a hot property, yeah. Walk out, man. That's the new thing on the show. Walk out. Walk out. No, I should go. You went out with a few cheap... You went out with punks. You know what I'm saying? I'm a hustler. I got money, all right? I got that. Mano? A phone operator called for whom to pay his phone bill. Oh, man. Well, let's explain. Yesterday, we did have a phone operator talking old dirty, saying that he didn't pay his bill, and that's why half his service was cut off. Well, now she says they don't pay their bills, and well, you haven't paid your bills. I'm just looking for the outside. I'm not making any assumptions here. I'm just stating facts. You're stating the facts. Yeah, well, you know something? Yes, she's dealing through experience, and since she came to the United States from Pakistan in 2017, she's used to growing up in a country that isn't full of political correctness, and she speaks her mind. I landed in Newark. I had left my parents and husband. I didn't have money. I was living in Newark, so I was around. And a lot of the brothers and the Hispanic guys love that ass of yours, I bet, right? Yeah. Yeah. They love that big ass. Old dirty is pissed. He's pissed because he was so smitten over her, you know? Yeah, he was coming over to play. Hey, Zane. Hey, what's up? What's that? That's my word. You know why he's pissed? It's because it's true. So just chill. Oh my God. Now Rick, the sordid recon, talking to the pinnacle. I wouldn't mind going out with Rick. Really? And you know why she says that? She goes, well, you don't look like one of them. Oh my God. Old dirty, I'm just reading what's on the screen, so don't kill me, basically. Tim says, how can old dirty pay with food stamps? Just reading what's on the screen, old dirty. Oh my God. He's really pissed, though. Look, I've never seen him this pissed. I think he's bummed because this is the first girl that turned you down. Not only that, I'm broke. Yo, that's my word. Yo, India, bomb Pakistan in the next 30 seconds, bro. I want it right off the mat. All right, now, Monna, what would it take to go out with O'Day? Nothing. No, huh? No. You can't be persuaded. No. Now did you decide this right when you walked in and met him, or was it after a little talking? What happened? Because it seemed like you two were kind of... When you saw him. Oh my God, oh man. All right. Old dirty's complimenting her ass and her... You know what I'm saying? Said the belly, she's got little bellies that would do good for a hickey. I'm having some vodka, Eric. I'm having a bite on the stomach and everything. Right. And your two-way slaggy stomach. Gravity taking a pull on that body, baby. You better chill with that. Oh my God. Ed from Jersey checking in. Old dirty is not cheap when he's done working, aka jacking someone. He's got plenty of money to spend. My man. There you go. So wait, this is very interesting. So, Monna, you saw old dirty and instantly you said... Right away, right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. And instantly you said... Right away, criminal. No way would I go out with him. Why? What is it about his appearance? So you're agreeing with him and everything. He's just not my type. Not your type because he has that tiny pencil mustache? You like that? I'm a gaucho, baby. I can ride that cow butt all night. Oh my God. I'll spank you. I'll put a bell around you. I'll call you May Bell. Okay. Come on. I ride cattle like that. Very surprised that you're not my type. I'm a gaucho. I'm a gaucho. I'm a gaucho. I'm a gaucho. Very surprised that Mono's not into hair. She's not into the mustache. I've had enough of it. I've had enough. Well, she has been in... I've had enough of it. She's a fool. That's telling her. Oh, Dirty, she has been in some abusive relationships. That's all right. I wasn't going to abuse that. I am going to treat that cottage cheese with love, kid. That's my word. Mono? Yeah? What do you have to say to old Dirty? Now, you're married to a Jewish guy. Yeah. And stereotypically, Jewish guys are supposed to be cheap. Mine better not be cheap because I'm the one with the money. He has to ask me for money. Oh, there you go. My man. My man, you're supporting your man. Are you talking about me? I'm breaking. I'm not supporting you. I'm just calling him. My man, you just walked out of his car. Yeah, but that movie just made on the rug. I think you can make a lot of money at Penn Station. That was one hell of a move, old D. I'm breaking. You see that breakdancing move? I like that. That was a good move, yo. I like that. You need a big... What a home man. You need a big piece of cardboard. You're all set, yo. Look at this movie, baby. It's some kind of spin thing. No, my point is my parents paid me. Right. They said money... Supporting your man. And you're talking about me being broke? And you giving your man all that, Lou? At least I'm not broke. Oh. Hey, Mono. Old Dirty has admitted that he's, you know, he's like... No! So, what's my ex-boyfriend? Oh, not the current boyfriend. Not the current husband. Not the current boyfriend. Go away, man. No. And not the Pakistani guy. Oh, God, let's not talk about him. It's just disgusting. According to him, sex was laid there. Don't say anything. Don't breathe. Don't move. Yeah, so? That was... Did he put a sheet over you? Yeah, take a real cold bath. If he could, he would have. Really? All right, Johnny from New York City asked the cab driver, Mono, if he would pick up O.D. in Harlem. This is getting out of hand. A lot of Pakistani cab drivers, yeah. Yeah, I would. Oh, yeah? Okay. Yeah, you would? Yeah, I'd rob you, too. You better feel a cold tech on your neck. You better give up that loot. Oh, Mike. Talking about cellulite all on the legs, and I'm complimenting that. I'm ready to chew on her pang and stomach and the whole bit. And she's supporting her man. And she's talking about me being broke and that my Latino brothers, we can't pay. And she's supporting her man. Right. Now you're... I support my man. I got to walk out. Well, you said you're the one with the money. Yeah, I'm the one with the money. So then your parents send it over from Pakistan? I got like a fake Gucci bag, son. What do your parents... What do you got there? Oh, they're doctors, right? Doctors in Pakistan. I don't know. I mean, you're visiting Pakistan and you need a doctor. Oh, my God. What kind of archaic doctor? They got the FCPS and FRCS from London. Oh, I got a XYZ and an ABC from London. That's good. London. I got that Gucci bag on Canal Street talking about she pays, son. Come on. Man, old dirty.

Is this what it would be like? I just talked to him for about 5, 10 minutes, and he's already flipping out on me for saying something. So what if I start dating him? If you were dating him and then you did something that might have upset him, then you'd be stuck in it. And be limbless. Right. And then he'd be obligated maybe to hit you. You'd also be breaking...

You're normally so- She's brought the animal out of me, the Pakistani tiger. I'm ready to attack. No, I understand, but normally you're so nice and flowing, you sound good. You know, where's the donuts, kid? You're so nice and weedy. Weedy. Now all of a sudden you're freaking out. You're like that other Puerto Rican that they had up there. I'm not Puerto Rican. Don't get offended. No, no, I'm not offended. It's all good. I mean, this woman has brought out the worst in me because she's- Yo, Rick, man, just stay out of my line of sight, my man. Tim from Long Island saying, oh, Dirty, if you're unemployed, he wants to know how you afford the 50 cards you need for Father's Day. Oh, God. I need like a sum of the punch.

Wow, we got like two really hot chicks in this studio. Holy smoke. What the hell is this? A little gift that was sent over to kind of calm the races. What is this? And bring harmony back to the show. I remember her from Lesbian for a Day. She was like this. And I remember you from the bubble bath. Oh, man, this sucks. Old Dirty. Oh, is that a bottle? We bought a bottle of Cristal for you. That's a real deal. This sucks. Old Dirty's head was about to explode. And look, it just takes two really hot babes to calm everybody down. That's how they should work the U.N. When somebody starts getting pissed. What did you say? You coming down tomorrow night? Huh? Coming down to Privilege tomorrow night? What's going on? You guys doing a St. Patrick's Day party at Privilege? Oh, my God. Look at that. Look at, everyone's coming now. Look at that. No one cares about any comments that was said. It's great. It's great. All of a sudden, boobs come out and people just are at peace. Everyone's mellow now. This sucks. We're ready to have a riot. We're ready to have a race riot. A race riot was right around the corner. Wow, girls are tonopolis and no one's talking now. Hey, look, great thought. That's good. But it doesn't help our radio show when we're about to have a rumble in the studio. What kind of getup does she have on? That's like a see-through thingy and then, oh, she's taking that off. She's the girl from the bubble bath, Ronnie. The little G-strings. Yes. Oh, that thing unsnaps right off for you. All right. I said we pop the crystal. Get it out of here. Get it out of here. I see that too. Oh, Derry, you ever see that? Oh, man. You ever see that before? Sure. Hey, Mano, what do you think of the girls' bods over there? It goes for like above 50, but we used to get a $50 a bottle. That's not as good as Champel, but you know, Champel. Whoa, he's doing it my way. Calm down. Hey, watch it. Watch that bottle, yo. That's some expensive stuff. Well, this stinks. I mean, the girls are great and all, but where's my riot? Oh, Derry, would you like us to put that in a paper bag for you? Oh, come on. All right. He keeps a doughnut gang away from me. He's a little bit of a bum. He keeps a doughnut gang away from me. Wow, that's... Look at this, though. It's so hard to get pissed at anybody with two naked girls in the studio. Are they real or did you do like work on them? They're all in mine. Are we putting the girls on the webcam real fast for a quick shot? Wow. Quick shot of the webcam? That's your natural hair color there? Yes, I'm a natural redhead. I could tell by your nips. Sure. Nice pink nip. What about the basement? Does that match? Wood floor? Oh, really? Look at Psycho Mark, he's insane. He's like, whoo-hoo. He never gets his clothes usually to girls before they run away. Screaming, if you listened yesterday. Wow, that's something. All right. AOD, are you pissed off anymore? No. Look at him, no, yo. Damn, this is so... Rick, we appreciate it, but you have the worst timing in the world, man. We were ready for a fight. It was going to go. Between Pakistan... We were going to have some wilding right here in the studio. There's going to be some wilding going on. Next thing you know, the door opens. Mano is going to look like the Central Park Jogger, remember? Oh, God damn it. Bring the bell, man. Come on, enough time passes, you can be a good man. Bring the bell. Come on, enough time passes, you can joke about anything. I figured I had to play the role of Boutros Boutros Ghali and try and calm this freaking mess down. Boutros Boutros Ghali. Well, it definitely did the job. The fine ladies from Privilege, Anthony. Thank you. That is great. You know what's so funny? The girls are right here, live, naked in front of us, but I have to like check out the camera. I'm looking like, wow, look, they're naked on the camera. But they're right there. But if you look on the camera, you're like, wow, they're famous. They're famous. They're on the camera. Privilege is at 23rd Street. The ladies are very fine down there. He's going to open his bottle. All right, yeah, don't move. Champagne can be violent. Yeah. Crystal. How about that? Could you open that out, Will? We'll do that after the show. We should get that chilled. Oh, wow. Where's one of the wonderful ONA interns to take this to the refrigerator? Yes, please. Ed on line nine, OD equals overdue. Oh. OD, just look at the boobs.

The dancers had to say, just look, just look. Yeah. Is there like white girls? Yeah. Nice. Are you girls a little scared of OD? You can be honest on this show. He's sniffing there. It's a bra. What do we have to be afraid of? Oh, you don't. Oh, yeah. Look at that. OD is sniffing panties right now. That thing unclips right off. You could probably just like click it and it'll fly off. They call those breakaways. Oh, I got him. Hey, you want to do a prison visit with OD and one of the girls maybe? Oh, that'd be good. Yeah. You got to see the prison visit. I want to see a prison visit with two girls. With two girls, huh? Kevin, if I get flashbacks, bro, you attack me to the blood. The prison visit, what we do is we get old dirty on the other side of the door with a cell phone. Then we shut the door and the girls come up as if they're visiting you in prison and try to turn you on through the glass. You ever see that in the movies where they touch hands or slowly take a breast out, push it against it? Yeah, something tells me that won't be too hard. We just need to get the cell phone immediately. All right, we'll get old dirty out there. We'll have them call up on the prison phone. The prison phone. Make sure we check them for any shivs, for any contraband. And ladies, the door is locked so you don't have to worry about him. You didn't smuggle any files in your vaginas, did you? Good girls. Someone want to pat them down? I mean... Yeah, look at all the hands going up. Get out of here. This is Mano. By the way, she's from Pakistan. And she's bisexual. And hairy as an ape. And we just shaved her ass. You want to show them your smooth ass? Okay. We shaved this ass down. It was it. She looked like a black lady before we started. It was that dark. She's from Pakistan. Check out the job we did on that. It's a third world country, Pakistan. They're horrified. They're absolutely horrified. Look at her. She goes, I was shaved by smelly. They're like, no, his name is stinky. They just made the butt head face. Okay. Yeah, yeah. She's got like this hairy ass. She's got the used tennis ball look on. Yeah. That's nice. Looks like she sat in a gravel driveway. O.D., what's up? O.D.? Is that O.D.? Yeah, what up? O.D. is on the prison phone. And why don't you explain the scene in the studio right now, Ed? All right. I can learn. The studio door is closed and locked. It's got a big pane of glass in front of it. O.D. is on the prison phone on the other side of the glass. And now the girls are visiting him. Yeah. Like up against the glass. They're pushing their body parts. O.D., what do you think, man? I'm loving it. Can't let me get up on that door, yo. Now, girls, girls, you have to like talk like it's a prison visit. So, oh, baby, you hang in there. We're working on your appeal. It's okay. We got a new lawyer. And then, oh, dirty, you got to be like, oh, it's so rough in here. I was voted queen of the weight room prom last night. Yo, what are you talking about? You know what I mean. Just some prison banter. Prison talk? Yeah. All right, bro. Yo, so you holding it down out there? What? Oh, my goodness. Look at that. Yo, could you like bend over all the way? Oh, we miss you. That's a good prison thing. You miss me, man? I hope both of you all miss me, though. Why don't you bump bonus for me real quick? I like to see that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, bump. Well, they're bumping towards you. He's like two feet away. He's right outside the glass. But he can't touch. He can't touch. The glass is in the way. Lick the glass. Oh, my goodness. Yo, you got that attorney for me? What's Johnny Cochran? That fool-ass mother. They're licking the glass and stuff, man. They're kissing the glass. Hey, is that door locked? Yeah. Don't let him back in. Hey, there you go. Now we'll cover up the window at Newspaper so he can't see anything. No, okay. That was a very good prison visit. Yeah. But you girls are not vocal enough, I don't think. You're not aspiring actresses or anything? You want to be actresses or something? What's your goal in life? To just dance until you're 60? What are you going to do? What's that? Watch as much porn as possible. Oh. Master bait and watch porn. Well, that's good. That's a good goal to have. I could get a job anywhere with that. They're not going to let me back in. And you're the coach yet, girl? Yeah. You don't dance? No. What are you, crazy? Private dancing. Oh, private dancing. No, how much money do you commit? Private dances. Oh, babe. I got you. Private. Look at him. He's freaking out. He can't see. He can't see now. They're blocking the window. Look at him. He's ducking all the way down. And Rick's just moving the paper around so he can't see it. See, through the glass. All right, well, Aunt, there you have it. Boy, that sure calmed everything down. That really did. Everyone's at peace now. John, what's going on? What's up? Hey, what's up? Oh, man, I'm telling you, Rick is a punk. You know what happened there, boys? Rick was afraid O.D. was going to kick his ass. So all of a sudden, he brought the women in. And then see how good O.D.'s playing that role? That's where he belongs. He feels most comfortable like that. Well, it's kind of a bummer because we were really close to it. Tom, I'm telling you, man, I was getting all ready. I thought we were going to start hearing slapping and teeth jiggling and all kinds of crap. Well, shut up, bro. What are you talking about? I feel comfortable. You do, don't you? No, I don't. Yeah, yeah, you feel like you were back home again. Yeah, you feel like you were back home again. Oh, Dirty, turn around. Look at the boobs. Calm down. Calm down. Look at him. Okay, he's back to normal. Thank you. Thank you, John. All right, boys. Take it easy. Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm. Look at the boobs. Let me just go to Steve. He wants to compliment old Dirty. Steve, what's up? Hey, what's going on, O.A.? Hey, what up? Hey, I have a question for O.D.B. Who has a hairier ass, Manu or his son from Rikers? Your mom, actually. All right, yeah, that's cool, man. Take care. O.D., calm down. Look at the boobs. Look at the boobs. Look at the boobs. Everyone. Yeah, there you go. There you go. All right, let's go to John. John, what's going on? What's up? I have seen more breasts in the past two weeks than I've ever seen before. I will call to you guys. Thank you. How old are you? 16. I'm pumping out the map of Hawaii pretty much every day. All right, John, bye. Bye. Oh my God. What? Nothing. Yo, PR, you know I haven't sat down in 45 minutes, man. You know what I'm saying? What's up with that? You're over here, you don't do nothing. You ain't producing for me, my man. Look at the boobs. Look at the boobs. Look at the boobs. Look at them bumping donuts. Wow, look at that. They're shaking them and pushing them together. Look at the... Yeah. There you go. He's calm again, ladies and gentlemen. I was hoping for a fight myself, but... Mono, do you think the girls are hot? Yeah? Very hot, yes. There's some bonding going on over there, Anthony. That is the goody trail. Well, what happened? What happened? Crossed M&Ms, y'all. One of them is bent over so he can check out her ass, and he's just going, man, that's the goody trail right there. Goody trail. Very good. Well, we want to thank the girls from Privilege. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you for having us. I hope you enjoyed the bottle of Crystal. Oh, we will. Hell, yeah. And we encourage everyone to go down to Privilege 23rd and 11th Avenue for their St. Patrick's Day party. They're doing that tomorrow night, did they say? When is that? Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Okay. Tomorrow night. Well, we've got to take a quick break. The Cochek girls available for private dancers. Private dancers. She's smoking. And we've got some lady listeners. What's up? I don't know what's wrong with some people. Don't you find something better to do with your afternoons? Sitting around listening to the radio. What kind of a name is Opie, anyway? It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway. You're going to have to tune yourself in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next. Opie and Anthony, we refuse to be responsible. Don't screw yourself. We refuse to be responsible. We refuse to be responsible. One, two, seven, W, N, E, W. Alright, Anthony. Yeah. I don't know what we're accomplishing today, but... Nothing. Again. But damn, it's fun. A few days away from vacation. Friday, leaving the show around 5.45, doing the rest of the show. From cell phones and a megaphone. From one of the bars close to the studio, Anthony. And a two, three block radius of the radio station. Yeah, so be around. Be around and hang out with us and drink some beers before we go on vacation next week. Okay, that's what we're doing. Friday, Mono still hanging out in the studio. The girls left, right? They got their plug and they ran out the door. Okay. Rick, why don't you grab a mic and... Hey, where'd the bottle of Cristal go? They took it with them. No, they didn't. Is it being chilled? It's being chilled. You gotta have a little taste of that after the show. That's like, you know, on the level of Dom. Yeah, it doesn't even have a twist on it. Better than Dom. Better than Dom. He's fat like Mono. Oh my God. The boobs go away and the violence comes back. Jesus Christ, man. Old dude, do you have a corkscrew in your pad? I can't, uh... You gotta get on mic, man. I go open the bottle for you. Yeah, all right. Yeah, I guess one of the listeners heard that Mono was here that liked women and decided to come on down and make herself available for a little, uh... I don't know, taste. A little psych action? Oh, a little taste. Wait a minute, she, um... She wants to be in the town. Right. You did say woman, right? Yeah. Okay. A little, uh... That's okay. Okay, horrific. Well, why don't we bring her in and meet her? I have yet to even see this girl. Mm-hmm. Did you take a peek at her? And what do you think? You're horrified? My name is Jana. Wow, look at you. Don't take on me. They were abusing you and I'm afraid now. So what's your name? Jana? Jana. Oh, Jana. Yeah, my friends are freaking out right now. What about strong legs? You got some muscle, kid. What do you do that you have muscle? Yeah, I go to the gym. Can you go to the gym? Yeah. Could you show Mono something here? I don't know what you want to say. What do you want to see, Mono? The blueberry? The blueberry. Oh, okay. I would like to see her boobs. Oh, look at that. Okay. I told you, they're pretty hot. She's not prepared today. She has to excuse me. Oh, okay. Well, she's got a tat on her. You got a tattoo on that thing. Let me see the one on the breast area. What is that? Chinese symbol for tiger. Are you a tiger? Yeah. It looks like you've had that a while. Two years, three years. Really? You spend a lot of time out in the sun, do you? Yeah. That thing kind of faded. I know. So why did you come down to the show today? Well, first of all, I heard she's bisexual. Mono? And it sounded like some of the girls that were supposed to come down weren't coming. Yeah. Which I guess sometimes happens, so I figured I'd liven it up a bit. Yeah. I think I'd seen it on the spaz camera earlier. Yeah, Mono. I was at work, no less. All right. Throw a little view there, Mono. Sure, why not? Yeah, why not? She's more prepared today than some of the girls. Look at that. She got it on the floor. Look at those things. She took that off hours ago. What do you think of those? Bigger than mine. Yeah, very big. I'm not a marita. You came down here for a reason, I guess. You wanted to... I told spaz you're missing an action at the moment. All right, hold on. Hold on. Okay. All right. All right. Hold the ballast tanks. All right, we had a dump out of that. I'm sorry. You would like to go for a taste, I believe. A taste, as they say. Right, right. It's not summer, thank God. Well, Mono... Mono, should we bring... I don't know, I might have to call her husband again. Should we bring the lesbian couch in, Mono? All I have to do is lay back? Yeah. Really? No? No. I thought we had a love connection. Did she touch your boobs or something? No. Wow. Oh my God. She said she's bisexual. Now she's not. Oh, Mono. You want to touch my boobs? Yeah, I want to touch them. Right now. I want to touch them. All right. I do it. OD coming around. OD. OD is so pissed. Okay, touch him. I want to touch him from behind, Noah. He's not doped. Really, what is he doing there? Really, like the guy with the pizza dough. Kneading the dough. You just calmed him down. Look how calm he is now. I've seen more sensitivity when someone's giving CPR. It's soft, you know. No sand up in that piece of skin. That was nice? Yeah, it was soft. Now why would you let old Dirty do that? You wouldn't let our new guest do that. Because old OD is like, sort of, he looked like he needed it. She threw the boobs at you for charity, OD. You're in charity case. Wealth fair boobs. She's going to charge you a couple of boobs. Now I'm unemployed and desperate. Oh my God. You're not doing that for PR. I mean, do you know the abuse I've been undergoing? All right, listen, now, Mano, what's the problem with our new guest? I'm probably not that tasteful. Is that it, really? What's the problem, Mano? You've been honest with old Dirty. Let's hear. What seems to be the problem? If she's bisexual, she's probably very talented in that area. And if you just laid back on the couch, shut your eyes, you might be surprised. I imagine it's her husband. Or something, you know. We could put a bag over your head. I might have to gross my eyes out. If that's the problem, poke a little hole or something. I don't know. We'll do the unknown lesbian. Look at her, she's like, come on, guys, I'm trying to be nice here. Wait, Mano, come on, you're brave enough to diss old Dirty. What's the problem here? I'm about to get insulted. I wouldn't insult anybody for anything. You have felt dirty. That's what it is. You know what I'm saying? Come on, Mano. People aren't sitting in their cars because you don't want to insult anyone. Let's hear. What seems to be the problem? She's not my type. Is there a type? There's a type when it just comes to it. Oh, wow. I'm too big now. Oh, my God. Sometimes the crystal is not around, you've got to accept the champagne. It's not always crystal. It's not always Budweiser. Sometimes you've got to go for that old Milwaukee. Not always. Right, exactly. Sometimes the king of beers isn't around, you've got to go for some slits. Oh, God, I'm getting this small. Oh, we're just killing. All right, you're 40 of all we. Not quite the 64-hour. You're good. You're not even willing to give it a try there, Mano. Would you give into anything, a little touching? No. Wow, she's adamant about this. Wow, look at her eyes getting really big. What's the problem here? She likes both of you. We can't get a supermodel here every day. Sometimes I go upset. You've got to forgo the filet mignon for a Swanson's TV dinner. Oh, my God. She's fighting to play a big new girl. Burger King would have folks just playing big lines. She would accept the salad. Oh, this is so nasty. You know, this isn't cool. She was brave enough to come down on the show. Come down here. She's ready to put on the snorkel and mask. Go cod fishing. So the girl with the hairy ass and the hairy back turned down the new girl in the studio. Wow. Sometimes we don't have a love connection. It just happens. In other cases, we'd be watching the couch right now and it would look like a bunch of spanking monkeys around the couch. But no, it doesn't always work out. Doesn't Joey look like Chuck Willery with the Rolex? It's so dirty. That's a swatch. All right. Well, I have a Rolodex swatch. It's closed. I bought it. I thought it said Roland. All right. I guess it ain't going to happen. You know what? If we didn't have that goddamn no drinking ruling here, they'd have been going at it. What? What? I would have been willing to use a strap on. What happened? Well, we at least have to get our number for the next girl that's willing to come down. Unfortunately, that won't work until 5. Can we at least take pictures of you? The pen. But with the strap on, like ready for action or something? Yeah. Like commando style? You want to take some pictures of that, Rick? She can use a strap on on OC. Oh, we don't. Oh, Joey. Joey's light of the day. Yeah. That was a good comeback, though, Joey. No one has a strap on, all right? Because I'm thinking if there was a strap on laying around, maybe Mano would want to use the strap on. On who? On our finance. She doesn't want anything to do with it. All right. Mano. Let's go to Jimmy. Jimmy, what's going on? What's up, guys? I just want to know how ugly is this girl that's on that she's even dissing her? What? How ugly is this girl that she's being dissed so badly? She's not bad. No? I'm driving in my car, I was all excited, and then when Mano dissed her, I'm like, oh, she must be really heinous. It's going to make you puke. What the hell was that? Oh my God. What the hell? I didn't do that one. I'm not listening anymore. That's Jesus. I didn't do that one at all. That's amazing. I'm really abusing more. All right. Well, we don't have a love connection, Anthony. It's very obvious. Obviously not. So I think we're going to thank you. You can hang out, have some food and stuff. Oh, gee, thanks. Oh, man, this is going to suck donkey balls. I tried. Sorry. I know. Oh, yeah. No, I mean, we were hoping, you know? I mean, Jesus. We'd all be standing around watching you go to town, but... Yo, do you get atoms on the rag, though? Yes, I do. What the hell? What? Where the hell did that come from, all dirty? What did you say? He asked her if she had... Hold on. He asked her if she likes to have sex during her time of the month. And she said yes. Okay. Oh, no? He has it like a bank on the rag. On the regular. Oh, on the regular. Hey, bloody son. All right, listen, listen. We're dumping out. Cut it out. All right, cut it out. I'm turning their mics down. John, what's up? Yo, that girl is horrible, man. I just saw her on the webcam. My computer screen blew up. Oh, my God. Flip him to bird, man. She's not on... Oh, she is on the webcam. All right, thank you, John. Yeah, take it easy. I don't think you're that bad at all. He's probably sitting in with a small wiener, whacking off right now. There you go. There you go. So you got to fight back on the show. Do the two-finger shuffle, I really hope. Very good. Let him sit there and do the two-finger shuffle. Okay, terrific. Okay, we got to take a break, Anthony. We'll come back and we'll play What Did We Learn on the Open Anthony Show today, all right? Right. 212-757-1027. Dudes with dudes. I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off. Open your mouth. We're out of control. We're so happy. All right, knock it off. 1027-WNEW. Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Oh, yeah, you remember our good friends at Stacker. They were here with us during the summer. And then I guess they laid off a while, but they're back, Opie. They were here during the dark years of the Open Anthony Show. Yes, very grim. Or the dark months, I should say. The dark months that seemed like years. But they're back after the holidays. Everyone pigged out, you know. You all had the big dinners with your family and you plumped up a bit. And the coats are covering them up, okay. But you know, spring's right around the corner. You better start losing weight now. And it also cuts the cravings to eat in between meals. Very good. That's where you gain a lot of weight. Yeah, when you're snacking. Your fellow employees desk and they got like the little kisses or cookies or something rolling around there. So coconut hostess snowball. Right. How could you pass that up? Oh, with the gooey marshmallow-y coating. Check out Stacker 2 The World's Strongest Fat Burner at www.stacker2.com. That's stacker2.com or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHTLINE.

What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show? We got to bring in Anthony real fast. I'm here, Opie. Another Anthony. Anthony is the most popular name of our listeners. Anthony was on TRL yesterday, Anthony. Oh, today you were on? Oh yeah, I saw that sign today. Yeah, we deliver keggers. Another psychopath making it on TRL. On MTV, he had the wow sign and the we deliver keggers sign all over the TV. Yeah, allegedly. He had allegedly on the screen today. And of course, okay, terrific. All right. Anthony's been waiting out there for like two hours. We've been really preoccupied today, I'm sorry. Okay, terrific. We almost had to bump Anthony, you know how like the talk shows do it? Yeah, they bump certain guests. That's terrible. So now we have to do the quick interview, like, oh. Yeah, the quick interview. Did you have fun listening to the show from the lobby there? Yeah. What do you think of Mono? Eh. Wow. She's got a nice smooth ass now, though. I think that's all we did on the show today, is shave her ass. That is hairy. What do you think of the one to your right? Janna, Jane, Jane, Jane. She's not a bitch. Whoa, whoa. So who's hotter? She's going to give you a hummer for that. Wow. All right, so you think she's better looking than Mono? What did I miss? All right, I'll take one too. All right, you want to plug anyone, Anthony? I just want to say hello to my friend Mike, who's listening right now. Okay. And anyone who's attending Five Towns College. All right, very good. Five Towns. Cool, well let's hear it for Anthony. He's going to get a bunch of prizes for getting the wow and the signs on live TV today. We love that. Besides the confiscated ask him out. It depends. If he wants to leave them, that's cool. I'll leave them. All right, time to play What Do We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today. Royal from Jersey. Today I learned Mountain Dew's new tagline, eat my... I can't say the word on the radio. We had a little bit of trouble with that. We had to bleep that, but Lizard from Wanto. I learned today that OD stands for out of dough. Whoa. Whoa. Laura from Jersey. I learned that I can't get a date with OD because I don't have a fat hairy ass. See what you did to me, like a standing woman. You destroyed me. Paul from Whitestone, Queens. I learned today that black girls new name is Urko. Urko. Now see, we're not allowed to make fun of Earl anymore. Is that it? Because he can't take it. He walked out today. Definitely walked. I guess Earl is off limits. We can make fun of everyone else in the studio here, but not Earl. Not Earl. He does it personally. For now on, he's just going to be called Earl. Well, we don't have to call him anything because we won't really be referring to him. He's dead. Because it will be hard to talk about. All right, Bob, what did you learn on the show today? I learned that making rugs of Persian ant hair can be more lucrative than Persian rugs themselves. And that Anthony is ashamed to do any Darth Vulgar or any Yoshi voices anymore. Why is that? Because you don't do Darth Vulgar, man. You have like 20 minutes to do that voice. Doing that whole Chewbacca thing. I do too. You do not, man. All right, man. We'll do it again. You better. Thank you. What did you learn on the show today? I learned that Fun Bag Suits the Savage Beast. Fun Bag Suits the Savage Beast. That's so true. And I'm kind of struck with NaNo, man. She's still here. Another thing I learned is that even a lesbian who's long in the tooth is still a hot lesbian. For you. All right, John, thank you. All right, take care, guys. Indication now. All right. I'm not sure how to feel with Rick here. We're ready to have a race riot and then we have to see really nice boobs. That's all right. I think it worked out for the best. T, what's going on? Oh, and hey, what's up? Hey, tell him, there ain't nothing wrong with it. It tastes like fish, smell like chicken. Hold your nose and keep on licking. Oh, and hey, if anybody can do it, you can do it. Get her licking, guys. Come on. We tried, man. We didn't have the pin pan today. Jay Moore would definitely be disappointed. Yo, at least have her do a prison visit. Yesterday's show was out of control. Let her do a prison visit with Psycho Mark. We're running out of time. All right, guys. We'll do it tomorrow, man. All right, later. Okay, let's go to TJ. TJ, what'd you learn on the show today? Hey, guys, today we learned that Opie and Anthony's favorite thing to do isn't reading copies. Yep. Hey, guys, I went to see Paul Vaughn last Thursday, a rascal. And if anyone is out there looking to see a comedian who is absolutely hilarious and puts on a great show, he's the guy to say, he was great. Yeah, look at that. Paul from airsick.net. He had me in tears. Thank you, TJ. Indication now. Okay, man. Let's go to Richie. Richie, you're next on NDW. Yeah, I learned that Pakistani women are descendants of wooly mammoths. And they can be on the Discovery Channel if they're willing to be frozen in the snow. That's right. Thank you, Richie. All right, guys. Indication now. All right. Let's go to Mario. We have a couple more left here. Mario, what's up? What's up, gentlemen? Yeah, I learned we could have played What's in My Pants with Lionel's backside. Yeah, What's in the Back of My Pants. How about that? I could have been special today. Yeah. Yep, yep. Hi, Natalia. All right, thank you, Mario. Bye. Let's go to Dave. Dave, you're next. What did you learn on the show today? Yeah, I learned that if I need to bang a Pakistani girl, I got to shave her ass first. And also that you guys hired the biggest fags in the world between Spaz and Urko walking out on you every time you say the wrong thing. I know. Too many people are walking out on our show. They can't take it anymore. They can't take it anymore. You know, once one person does it, it's just like everyone can do it now. Unbelievable. It's stinky. When are you walking out? Look, you just called me. He's walking out. He's all pissed off. It's the new thing. He's so stupid though. He's going to just keep walking. Right? He doesn't even realize in his head it's a joke. Come on back, Stinky. Yeah, dude. Don't walk all the way to the short bus. Not yet. It's not time. Hey, James, you're next. What's up? Hey, what's up, boys? Hey. How you doing? I learned today that no matter what nationality they may be, brown people cannot get along. Wow. F. Johnny Action. I'm out. All right. F. Johnny Action. Wow. That's it. That's an obscure reference. That goes back. I think we're done it. Yeah. What a day. What a day. We've got to thank Mano. She was the star of the show today. Thank you, Mano. Thanks a lot, Opi and Anthony, for having us. I wonder what would be more satisfying to society, working in like a small town, like a cancer cure lab, AIDS cure, trying to work on a cure, or this show? Judging from what I learned on the Opi and Anthony show, I think it's this show. I think we do more of a service than trying to cure deadly diseases on a daily basis. All right.
