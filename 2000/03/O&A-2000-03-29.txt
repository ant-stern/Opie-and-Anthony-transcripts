 That's about as funny as a sinking school bus. I have a strong stomach. You guys made me poked so great. The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. Oh, and then my two new favorite hordes. You guys are really horrible. Mopi and Anthony. What a couple of ass-whipes. 1027. WNEW. Yeah! Hey, hey. The C1A show, how are ya? Hey. Oh, you need that? There you go. There we go. Our phone line is 212-757-1027. Hey! If you want to work, if you are working, you want to send us a fax I should say. Fax us, 212-957-9639. We have another fine radio show for you today, right Anthony? Oh yes, absolutely. More Met tickets to give away to opening day? Fabulous. I was talking to Spaz in the back office about the Mets. Everyone knows the Mets start their season in Japan. The game started at 5am. Spaz had to watch the whole thing. Is that why he is all tired and everything? The only people that watched the Met game this morning were the people that had to get up early for work. So they got up maybe a little earlier to catch the end of the game. You pop it on as you are getting ready for work. I heard the ESPN Sports Zone was packed before work today because everyone went in there to check out a few innings of the game. Oh yeah? Yeah. But Spaz, set his alarm. Get Spaz in here real fast. You are going to laugh at this one. So Spaz. Spaz all day. I know. If we go through stage it would be Spaz. So what time did the Met game start this morning? 5.05am. 5.05am. 5.05am. Yes. You set your clock for what time? 5 on the button so I have 5 minutes to wake up. 5 minutes to wake up. And what was the end of the game? What was the score? Final score? 5-3. 5-3. Met's lost obviously. Yes. And your theory on the Met loss that you were telling me in the back office? It's a combination of jet lag. What? Jet lag. Both teams had jet lag. Yeah but it's, I don't know, it's, there's a whole thing against the Met's in Major League Baseball. Alright listen, no, no, no. It's a conspiracy. Tell me what you told me in the back office. In terms of the Japs? Well you have this theory about the opening game of the season. Oh yes, yes, my theory is that. Man listen to this. Okay. Well see last year the Met's lost their first game of the season last year as well, I believe against the Florida Marlins. And they made the playoffs. So it doesn't matter that they lost the first game because they'll make the playoffs again because it's back to back. Spaz has this theory, Anthony. Let me speak for Spaz. You have to tell me Spaz's theory. On the Spaz translator today. Spaz has this theory, if you lose the first game of the Major League season, you will not win the World Series. No, it's because the first game sets the tone for the rest of the season. There haven't been teams that had a crappy even first half of the season that just went on. If it were Mike and the Mad Dog at the van, we'd be able to get on our computers. Pull up stats. And we would be able to pull up stats how many teams ended up winning the World Series even though they lost the first game of the season. I know the Yankees, yeah. Like eight in a row two years ago. Right, right. The Yankees lost what? Eight in a row to start the season? Right, two years ago wasn't it? Yeah, so it was something ridiculous. It was like oh no, it's all over. Everybody's spelling gloom and doom for the Yankees. That's your theory. That's my theory. You gotta go with it. That guy's got a melon between his shoulders. But even though the Mets lost the first game of the season, you're still predicting them to win the World Series this year, right Spass? I'm predicting they'll come very close. My Dream World Series is Mets versus Indians. That's a Dream World Series? That's a Dream World Series? Why? Most New Yorkers' Dream World Series would be Yankees. The Subway Series. The Subway Series. I don't like the Yankees anymore. But why the Indians? Why the Indians? As you mentioned, the Indians were underdogs at one point in their careers and they both made a surgeons. Both surgeons, yeah. So two teams that were resurgents. So what do they do? Like open heart surgery in between games? No, it's like a surge. Surgery of energy. Okay, yes. Re-surgeons. Because they were once underdogs and now they're not underdogs anymore. It'd be a good series. Underdog, but I never liked that cartoon because the sweet polypure bad was always in trouble. Do you realize every team in the league was an underdog at one point in their careers? Yes, but the Indians were an underdog in the late 80s, early 90s. Okay, listen. We'll save all this for Friday. Someone wants to know if your brain has jet lag. I was sitting there in the office getting ready for the show and he's like, you know, it's usually a bad sign if the team loses the first game. It means they're not going to win the World Series. You really believe that? Yeah. They'll come close, but... All right, thanks, Bass. You go ahead. Thank you, Bass. That was great. Jesus. All right, Ant, we're getting ready for another radio show today? Yes. Where's Ben? I got a copy of the Jimmy Page, Black Crows, Live at the Greek CD, Anthony. Been jamming it on the subway on the way into work every day. And what's the deal with this album, Ben? You can go to MusicMaker.com to purchase it. And you can even design your own compilation. You can pick the songs in what order and there's some different tracks on there to pick. And then they're touring this summer, supposedly coming back around town. Ant, this is an amazing CD because you cannot buy it in record stores. Right. And the reason why you can't buy it in record stores is the reason because Columbia dropped the Black Crows? Something to do with that. Something like that. And they can't put any of their own songs on there. There's all kinds of red tape. Wow, what a cluster. But I've been jamming this for the last few days and I figured, you know, off and on today, we should feature a few tracks from this damn disc. I want to start with one that is just making me play air guitar like crazy. I see. You look like King Gimp walking around playing air guitar. Yeah, it's okay. You'll recognize the song though, all right? It's the Black Crows with Jimmy Page. Nobody's fault but mine. We'll go to the phones next. 212-757-1027. It's WNEW. Check this out. All right, here it comes. Anthony is evil but Opie is worse than Hitler. We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Krull and Inhuman show. 7-WNEW. All right. Yeah. It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony. I'll be a little, yeah. It is. I forgot about that. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. It's a little, yeah. I'll be a little, yeah. It is. I forgot about that. I will give you 10 bucks if you know who's doing this version of the Hoosong. Hold on. I hear any vocals? No. That's what makes it tough. I don't know who. That voice. Oh, I was going to say that. Of course I was going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. Of course I was going to say that. I thought I looked like an ass if I was wrong. That wasn't sure. Ah yeah. Okay. My music is pretty good. My music taste is changing. I'm really into Fat Boy Slim. I never thought I'd see the day that I'd be into... Psycho-Hot Call in your Bag. That's me. Pretty cool. You like that? Yeah. All right. 2127571027. I'm going to be a little bit more serious about this. I'm going to be a little bit more serious about this. I'm going to be a little bit more serious about this. 2127571027. Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. Well, we're still a little early. Yeah, it's kind of breezy, a little overcast. It really isn't that... We're holding back. I mean, we're going to start the whole Whip-Em-Out Wednesday promotion in the very, very near future. Boy, there's no problem with putting the sign on your car now. Yeah. It's an early start. Yeah, you definitely should get an early start. I guess what I should tell the people is we've got a brand new WOW logo. Yeah. We've got about 120,000 WOW bumper stickers that are being printed as we speak. Uh-huh. It's going to be all over the Tri-State area by the middle of summer. Trust me on that one, okay? Huge. I know a lot of the faithful listeners want one of these new WOW stickers. So, I would suggest you start sending in your self-address stamped envelopes. Yes. All right. Immediately. What address can I send that to, Ben? Do we have a PO box or the 888 7th Avenue? 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106. And just put WOW sticker on there somewhere, okay? WOW sticker. WOW sticker, Opie and Anthony, whatever, 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106. And as soon as we get those stickers, we'll mail them back to you, okay? Right. But as far as WOW goes, we're still a few weeks away. Yeah. But we're all getting excited about that, all right? Right. Okay. And what do you got over there? You wanted to make a confession today? What? Not a confession. It was tied in with a story we were laughing at in the office about Britney Spears. I mean, yesterday we were talking about this, but because of Spaz we didn't get to it. Yeah. Yeah, the pop princess Britney Spears suffered head injury after a heavy camera fell on her head during a video shoot. Yeah. Which just cracks me up. Yeah. Yeah. So what, she was filming her latest video? Yeah, her new video for Oops! I Did It Again. Yeah. And she needed four stitches on her head because a camera or something fell on her head. A heavy camera. God, that's great. Boy, is her 15 minutes up yet? No, not at all. No. No, there's a ton of people looking just like Britney Spears out there. Yeah. I've seen them. That Christina Aguilera hosebag. No, there's more than that. And then there's another one that's like 15. There's Mandy Smith. Yeah. I got it down here. You've been studying all day. I've been studying the new Britney Spears. There's a total of four, I believe. Four. You got Aguilera. Yeah. Very slutty. Yeah. Gives it up. She wants to be Britney, very bad, but she's like the second rate Britney. Remember the battle between Debbie Gibson and Tiffany? Yeah. And Debbie Gibson almost had a legitimate recording career going. And Tiffany was just like completely out of the picture. She was a mall whore. Yeah. She wanted to be. She wanted to be the level she's on. Yeah. Just like the whore. But she won the Grammy over Britney. So now they're starting to say ... They just pulled it out of a hat. They're starting to say Aguilera's a little higher than Britney Spears now, Anthony. But in my opinion, Christina Aguilera is like the slutty version of Britney. Right. Although Britney, I don't know, she's pretty slutty in her videos. You don't want to think that way, though, Anthony. No? Why? No, you want to think that she's like the sweet, innocent girl at school, and then you take her to the prom, you get her in the backseat, and then you slam it home. Well, uh ... All right. So there's Christina Aguilera, the slutty Britney Spears. Right. Then there's Mandy Smith, right? Mandy Smith. Mandy Smith, I believe. And Jennifer Simpson. Jessica Simpson. Jessica Simpson. Okay. And some weird one, Hakku or something like that. Hakku. I'm serious. Wait. Who knew Agu or something like that? What do you got in your bag that has this written down, dude? I am really scared. No, it was in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly. Oh, okay. All right, it had the whole rundown. Yeah, I was studying it on the train today. Damn it. Well, that's ... But the problem is that Britney Spears is the only one with the breast implants. All the other ones ... Hey, those aren't implants. Those are natural, according to her. She says that they were smaller in other shots because she was going through puberty. All right, let's go to the phones here. Anthony, what's going on? Hey, what's happening, guys? How are you? You guys suck, man. Hey, thanks. Hey, I just wanted to say, man, you guys are hanging on all four or five of these bros. Well, yeah, they would deserve a sound pounding from any guy. Any guy that sees them. Anthony, I'm very close to stalking Britney Spears. Are you? Oh, my God. You know what? If you don't send me an email, I'm taking a walk. All right. There's a couple of real good shots of her and a couple of ones that kind of ... I would definitely do Britney Spears. Little wacky. Aguilera doesn't do anything for me. Every one of them, man. Every single one of them? You throw them once. Plants or not. Let me see that picture on the back of that. Well, we're guys. 15-year-old, you take the Vegas. Well, we're guys. We got to like bang them all, but I mean ... The one I would enjoy the most would be Britney Spears. Yeah, I hear you. She's like the prom date that got away. She is definitely going to be in Penthouse at some point in her life. She's smoking. Yeah. Smoking, man. Like when the whole recording career goes down the tubes next year. Anthony, nothing but sticky pages, bro. I bet. All right, Anthony. Thank you. You guys suck, man. Later. All right, bye. Well, I got to admit, I was going through the magazine rack over the CBS. There was a magazine just called Britney. It was put out by, I don't know, 16 or Teen Beat or something like that. It just said Britney? It was just Britney with a big picture of Britney Spears. Yeah. And I had a fun time. You were thumbing through the Britney Spears magazine. Sorry, I'm distracted. I'm trying to write you a note. The big Britney magazine and looking at all the pictures, there are like 600 pictures of Britney magazine. I saw a lot of pictures of her. And like I said, some of them look really good. Some look really bad. And she, a lot of pictures, she had that big wide open mouth thing. And what's the first thing you think when you see her with a big wide open mouth? Oh, I don't know. Maybe I could feed her a Twinkie. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Is that what you think? Hey! Virgil. Hey! Virgil. Virgil. Hey! Virgil. So I was thumbing through that a little bit. It's a little embarrassing. I went there for my computer magazine. Now, there are people walking by going, why the hell is this guy looking at the Britney magazine? Well, you've got to kind of hide it. You don't want to be caught doing that. You know? You know? Especially if you look like you're ready to toss a bat. Virgil. Virgil. Hey! Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Virg spans it one more time. Virgil. Hey! Hey! Virgil. Yeah! Virgil! You gotta keep going I'm dying! I'm dying over here! I'm dying over here! I don't think I can finish the show! Virgil! Virgil! Hey! Virgil! Hey! Virgil! Hehehe! Errrr! Whoa! Whoa! Hehehe! Virgil! Yeah, thank you the Professor of Scots. Hey baby! Yeah, very nice. Yeah, they had pictures of Britney and Aguilera from the Mickey Mouse Club in the magazine. Yeah. That's right, I forgot you liked them really young when Britney was... Well, yeah! Yeah! When Britney had the, er, Virgil. With brown hair. Virgil! Hey! Virgil! Oh, yes! Is she actually Virgil? Yeah? No? No one has confirmed that they have, er, fouled her. I don't know. Would you just be there, like, unless you were still doing her, and you were like the first guy, and you're still doing her, because you don't want to ruin that? And if you had sex... Like, if you got thrown to the wayside and some other guy was doing it, wouldn't you just be on the news going, yeah, I banged her? And if you had sex with Britney Spears, you're calling ET up. Yeah! No one... Today, the guy that banged Britney Spears! Virgil. Scott-so! I believe no one has fouled her yet. You know what? You'd like to think that over. No, I saw somewhere she's dating one of the guys from NSYNC. Well, then she's obviously still a virgin. Yeah, I mean, that guy. Virgil. Yeah. Hey! There's the NSYNC guy. Hey! Hey! So, how long have you been dating Britney? Hey! Really? Hey! And what is she? Virgil. That's right. Yeah. I think that's like a little gimmick thing. Like, didn't... didn't what's his facey there from... Keith from the Partridge family? Didn't he date somebody? Like Laurie? Yeah. That's like a thing. I don't know. It's just good for the Teen Beat magazine? Right. It looks good if... it looks like maybe he isn't gay. And... Gay. And you know, they're not banging. They're just dating. They're going to the malt shop or something. Virgil. That's right, Scott. Another camera. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Virgil. Ha! Ha! Hey! Hey! Ha! Ha! Hey! Virgil. He-he-he. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ha! Ha! Hey! Hey! Ah, great. Alright, John from Queens. I need some feedback. Alright, you got Britney Spears. You got, uh, Christina Aguilera. Aguilera, thank you. Aguilera! It's Mandy Moore, Anthony. I get that, me me. Mandy Moore, what? Uh, Jessica Simpson. And now some ugly Hawaiian bitch called Hoku. Hoku? I was close, yeah. Is that like Haku from the W-W-W-W? Hoku. Hoku. H-O-K-U. You know what that is? That's, uh, that's Hawaiian for Virgil. Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, here it is. Oh, you got it? Let me see some pics. Yeah, the Entertainment Weekly that has, uh, the rundown of the chicks. Yeah. But, but, but, Mandy Moore. Mandy Moore. Mandy Moore, yes. Oh, mm-mm, running around. Virgil. Yeah, keep that going. Hey! Mm-mm. Ha-ha. There you go. Let me see. There's the rundown of the girls. Alright, okay. Alright, uh, Britney, of course. Jessica Simpson, 19-year-old Texas, uh, Texan Baptist is proud. It says it right here. She's proud to be Virgil. She, uh, what's she saying? Yeah, she's a virgin. And then there's Mandy Moore, 15. They're calling her Britney in a training bra. Uh, most likely to watch her Where Are They Now special before her 10-year high school reunion. That's true. And Haku, the spunky, spunky 18-year-old Hawaiian. How about that? Someone's saying Haku is Don Ho's, uh, daughter. That's what they say. Okay. Singing with dad Don Ho. Wow. Is that wrong for me to just look and want to just unload, uh, on the 15-year-old? Virgil. Why? Why? Uh, like, look at her picture. That ain't bad. We might have to play. Virgil. We might have to play I'm Horny for Little Girls today, huh? What? Is that a bad thing? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What? Is that wrong of me? What? It would be a good segue into I'm Horny for Little Girls. Maybe I shouldn't have been so outspoken. Each time I see a little girl, eight or nine or ten, I can't resist the urge to stick my tongue inside her then, because Virgil is for little girls. For little girls who have hairless little tw- Hey! I'm horny for little girls. Virgil. I get them hot on alcohol and pot. Whoa! That little butt so round, so tight and shiny. Hey! Hey! Makes you want to smash your junk inside her. I'm horny for little girls. Virgil. I want to bang them all, sometimes as young as one or two. Okay, terrific. I'll kill them when I am through. I'm horny for little girls. Hey! Hey! I tape their mouths and tie them to the wall. Virgil. I'm horny for little girls. Ha! Ha! I beat them and I make them lick my butt. Their little nips so helpless and appealing. I want to slice them off and mount them on the ceiling. I'm horny for little girls. Hey! Virgil. I'm horny for them all. Hey! Virgil. Hey! Hey! Virgil. I've got so much fun. I have so much fun. I'm not a cat. I'm a monkey. I'm a monkey. I'm a monkey. I'm a monkey. Virgil. I'm a monkey. Virgil. I'm a little girl. Hey! Hey! Virgil. Come sit on my lap little girl. I have some candy for you. Okay, terrific. Wow. Wow. That's Q. I'm horny for Little Girls, the latest entry in the Most Defensive Song Contest, by the way. That's a good one. That's catchy. We got that one late in the show yesterday, if you weren't listening. Kind of went along with our discussion here. Does Christina Aguilera have to stick her tongue out in every picture, too? You see that Grammy picture that she won when she won that Grammy? Because she's a slut, man. She is quite the hosebag. What do we have? Randy from Staten Island, O'Neil. I'd hit her with the map of Hawaii one more time. I'm talking about Britney. Maybe Haku. All the other ones need breast implants, though. What about the 50s? Virgil. Yes, Professor. Oh, God. You're going to have to start cutting scott to a check. Yeah, that's it. Someone brings up a good point on the instant feedback. Jared from Jersey. Here's the perfect tag team in bed, Britney Spears and Anna Kornikova. I'm starting to get into Britney Spears more than Anna Kornikova. We haven't seen Anna that much. She's married now, isn't she? I don't know. Is she the hockey guy? Is she officially married or engaged? Who knows? He's given the old slap shot. Isn't it funny? Isn't it funny they get married or engaged and you don't feel for them the same way because you always thought you had a shot? I don't even think it's so much had a shot, but you're just picturing the hockey guy. You just know that she's being foul-hawed. You know the dude dead. He's probably got his legs all tied up on the post. He's coming into the crease, slapping. Shot, score. She's got a light on her head. A little beacon on her head flashes when he does her. That's great. Jessica Simpson. The Baptist thing is a little weird. Proud to be a virgin. Does she sing sexy songs and stuff? I don't know. It's hard to be a Texas Baptist virgin and sing those songs. Britney sings and you're just like, okay, she's singing about F'ing. Same thing with that Aguilera. I don't know what the others sing. They're all over MTV though every time you turn it on. A spunky 18-year-old. Spunky, spunky. I got some spunky. Why is she spunky? She should wash. If they call her a spunky, maybe a handy wipe. Okay? All right, Ant. Good start to the show today. A little rundown on the new bitches of MTV. I have no clue what we accomplished there. I don't think anything, but I think we're accomplishing something when we accomplish nothing. I know one thing. That's our job. You're getting as good as Fat Boy Slim as far as that mixing goes. Wow, come on, that's Scott. You can't go wrong with a virgin. Right. It's Ant Boy Slim over there. Making his own mixes. I like it. Hey. All right. Well, that was a wonderful break. Is that Ag? Oh, come on. What? What? Oh, is that? Okay, let's go there. What the hell? Alex, what's going on? Hey, I want to know if it's Anthony's Britney Spears CD. The one we're playing? Yeah. To tell you the truth, we had to grab that one. We looked in my collection and no, I didn't have any Britney, but I will be adding it to my collection. Good to hear. By the way, I'm running for the website now. You're what? I'm running for Steve's website. Oh, cool. Alex. Hey, Alex, do a good job for us. I'll see you guys later. All right, man. Bye. Good deal. Let's see if you can retire when you grow a pub. Who the hell was that? I don't know. Hey, I'm writing for the website just so I can see the naked pictures before I'm 18. Let's go to Joe. Joe, you're next on N.E.W. What's up, fellas? How are you? Listen, I was just wondering, Anthony, you were flipping through that magazine. Were you looking for upcoming concert dates so you could get tickets? Yeah, that's what I was doing. I'm looking for Britney Spears tics, Mandy Moore tics, whatever I could get. Smartass. Take it easy. All right, bye. Imagine the women that hang out at a Britney Spears show, though. Oh, huh? All dressed like Britney. Remember the old days, like Madonna and stuff, all the girls that dress like a virgin thing? Like a what? Scotch-O? Virgin. Yes. They dress like that and you'd be like, huh, a girl can't pay any more than 12 and she's showing her ass. Yeah, but worse than that is the fat girls that get into the Madonna outfits. Oh, yeah. That's classic. They always show that footage on MTV or something when they're doing the Madonna special or whatever and they have all the girls online at a concert waiting to get into the Madonna show and they all dress like she used to dress in the early 80s. Like a virgin. And there was always that one fat girl that didn't quite pull off the outfit. Trying to squeak into that little outfit. I think she just ate some of the skinnier kids in front of her to get a little closer online. Do you think it's the same way with the Britney Spears shows? Yeah, I'm sure. All the girls are wearing little belly shirts and you got the big fat girl with the belly shirt on. Yeah. Yeah. Showing some of that big belly. Probably. I don't know. I've never been to a Britney Spears concert. Let me again say, never been to a Britney Spears concert. I'll tell you how the No Doubt show is though. I say we go just as a goof. You want to go to a Britney Spears show? When's she coming around? You and I. Jones Beach. Jones Beach? Yeah. Let's go. Can we get tickets to that? It's probably harder to get than No Doubt. We could bang the moms. The moms are probably younger than us. And we're not even that old but. I don't know. Let's do that. Let's try to get tickets to the Britney Spears show. We'll take a bunch of listeners. Would that be a horror show? A bunch of our listeners and a Britney Spears show. Show us your business. Show us your skin till when you bitch. And I think it's a brilliant idea. We'll get like 20 listeners. You and I will go. We'll chaperone everyone. We'll get drunk. Oh yeah. Wear the chaperone. We'll get drunk and high and go to the Britney Spears show. A bunch of 30 year old guys. Horrifying the 15 year old girls that are there for Britney. I like it. I like that too man. Set that up. Alright. Well everyone's calling about the chick singers. I think we need to move on. I think we're done with them. And maybe try to start a real radio show now. So if you're calling about that please hang up. If you have anything else though give us a call. 212-757-1027. How you doing? This is Angel Dice Clay. I got a lot of personnel. I mean you gotta get a piece of personnel. Try that one Anthony. You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma. The Opie and Anthony Show. Throne men jumping all over each other. Okay terrific. 107 WNEW. Alright let's try to accomplish something today. You sent your girlfriend over to our accountant to have the taxes done? Yeah. Are you insane? Why? Do you know Ben? Benny? He's perhaps the horniest horn dog on the face of the earth. I wouldn't leave a girl alone with him for more than two seconds. You want to get him back on the line? I'm sure he's listening to us. No I don't want to go phone too bad. He's gotta do my taxes tonight. Taxi's and a pod are gonna be nice and stuff you know. But oh my god you let Sandy sit in the office alone with him? Yeah one of them. Oh no. See if he has any luck. God damn. I always wait till the last minute so. This is early for me. Usually like April 14th I'm running around trying to find a tax guy. Yeah. I remember the good old days. Grab the EZ form. Fill it out. Mail it in. I get my little refund. Have fun. And it is a little refund I found out. Well now it's like you gotta fill out eight billion things. Thank god I lost money on the market last year. That'll help you out. And if today's any indication I won't have to pay next year either. Jesus am I taking a beating. Man there's a few things I should have dumped out of today. I know it. Yeah. I know it. I should have went with my instinct. Yeah. Gotta go with your instincts with this damn market. You certainly do. Instincts and maybe something that's written in the paper. Yeah. That too. That too. Oops. Very surprised my guy didn't call me today. As I watch one of my stocks plummet. Oops. They'll be back. Nasdaq's down like 120 points today. Everybody's selling off on the techs. I don't know why. Nasdaq is just whacked out. It's taking a beating. Yeah but it goes. Yeah. Then it goes back up to 5,000 and then drops another few hundred points. I don't know. This is a great buy. Great buying opportunity right now. If you play at the Anthony way. Unfortunately I bought this time before it went down. So I'm just waiting for it to come back. What a great radio show we have. Talking about fouling underage girls and now we're talking about stocks. Yeah. This is great. The American dream isn't it? Let's go to the folks. Make a little money on the market and bang a rock chick. Let's see what Joel wants to say today. Joel what's up? I want to talk about Kathleen Turner and her being playing Mrs. Robinson over in England in the graduate play. It's going to make you puke. It's like a fat sow. Well there's a problem with that. I guess she's getting naked during the play too huh? Yeah that's what I heard. Yeah Kathleen Turner she's doing the graduate on stage over there in London. Here's another example of things we talk about. And she's taking off her clothes. Now Kathleen you had to wait. You had to wait until she says 45. She does say she's 45. Yeah. Give her a take 10. Then they have a picture of her from the movie Body Heat. Yeah which I believe was 1981. 1981 which let's do a little math would make her 28. Very doable. No not even. Well she's not 45 first of all. She's got to be pushing 50. 1981 was 19 years ago. She's like let's say 31. 30 31 back in 81. Yeah. Doable. Why didn't she take it off then? Exactly that's what I'm saying. You know take it off live on stage then. These women all wait until they're in their 50s before they decide to take their clothes off. Another good example of that was Farrah Fawcett. That's another one. Everyone who didn't want to see Farrah naked in Playboy in the 70s during the Charlie's Angels years. Instead we got the Farrah Fawcett picture with the red bathing suit with the nips popping out. Yeah. Why didn't she go all nude then? Uh-uh. She waited until time ravaged. Tom did its evilness on her. I mean and obviously yes. She still looks pretty good for her age. You know you don't see a lot of women walking around her age that look that good. But it's not the Farrah Fawcett that we all wanted to see when we were young. And this Kathleen Turner now naked. Why? Why the hell is she doing that? Okay horrific. Yeah well I don't know. Did you have something on this Joel or you just want to bring it to our attention? No I just wanted to kind of see what you guys... I thought you guys would kind of be the same page I'd be. And you know like you guys were saying back in the body heat days she could have probably pulled it off. Joel she used to be so freaking hot. I know, I know. And just like Anthony said why didn't she take it off back in 81 during body heat? Simple as that you know. Kathleen Turner, she's one of those affected people. One of those voices. I'm on the stage in the London theater in the stage version of the movie Graduate. And I am nude in this production. Got a man voice now. Thank you Joel. Thanks guys. Later. With those thunder thighs of hers I don't think she could do the famous scene that Anne Bancroft did. With the leg? With the leg up and the camera zooming in on Dustin Hoffman's face. Mrs Robinson I think you're trying to do that one. Just see this big cellulite thigh flapping. I don't believe they'd be able to do that. No. Anthony Robert from Long Island writes on the instant feedback, hey Opie, weren't you supposed to write Anthony a check about an hour ago? Hey yeah. Hey. Right you were. Hey. Hey. I'm embarrassed to say that I forgot my checkbook. You forgot your checkbook. Well the market. Oh struggle. That won't be fun is checkbook. I'm very embarrassed but I mean the market's not doing well today. But that's when I would have put the money in. Like now? Yeah you put it in when the market's down. What am I going to do buy when it's up? See if you. On the highs? Yesterday I'm finally going to pay Anthony his money. I was supposed to do it today but Anthony being a pal of mine came up with a great idea. He's going to take my 600 bucks that I owe him from the cruise that my girlfriend took with someone Anthony used to know. How do we refer to her? Yeah because it's not finalized yet. Let's just say someone you used to know, the complainant. So Anthony is going to take the 600 bucks I owe and he's going to attempt to double the money in the market. Double it in the market and then pay you the money that you paid me. That way I get my money and you're not totally out the money because you really didn't know what was going on. You didn't know that your girlfriend was getting a vacation paid for on my American Express card. I really didn't know at the time. From the complainant. Right. But today would have been a good time. Now I'm willing if you do say that you are going to give me this money. I have to. I am willing to. Our friendship depends on it. Front it. You do like a fronting thing. So I will now buy. You're going to buy now? Something and then I will. Are you going to buy right this minute? Yes I think so. Okay I promise you the 600 dollars comes tomorrow then. Now there's a couple of issues here Anthony. Okay. You have the 600 dollars I give you. Yeah. You completely lose. I'm off the hook. That's my problem. Okay. That's not your problem. The other thing. I know some days you do really well. What if you like quadruple my 600 bucks? Then you will be very happy with the money that you owed me. Damn it. That's it. What do you think? Would you throw me just a little extra? No. Not at all. Are you buying right now? I am ready to buy. Absolutely. You're going to push send? Here we go. I'm punching up what I'm getting. Push okay. Please hold. I will give you the money tomorrow. Okay. There it is. And let's look down the list. Oh yeah. That's what I need. Can you tell people what you're buying? It's probably not ethical too but I'll tell you one thing. It ain't yippy. I know that much. It ain't yippy. It ain't yippy. Okay. All right. Let's see what it's the okay. Let me go down the list. 180. Okay. All right. I can do that. I'll pop in right there. Okay. Are you setting a buy price or are you just going in? I'm in. I'm in. You're in. I'm in. My $600 that I owe you is invested officially. It is duly invested and not in yippy. All right. Is there a possibility that you will sell this before the end of the show today? Oh, looking at the NAS today? No. No. Probably not. It would take a miracle in the next 20 minutes. All right. But oh, that's right. It closes in 20 minutes. Yeah. No. Another hour or so. Tomorrow we should see a very nice bounce on this issue. Okay. I wouldn't worry about it. Now, if you make my money back before tomorrow, I don't even have to write the check. I'm just asking, right? Wait a minute. You really get off the hook here, don't you? No. You know something? No. No. Wait. Officially, if you make my $600 back by showtime tomorrow, I don't have to cut you a check. No, you do. Why? Because I want you to write that goddamn check and then I will pay you back. Okay? But if you make the money... I don't care. ...then I don't owe you anything officially. I don't care. Just consider it margin. No. What if I don't pull it out? What if I let it ride? No. See, come on. That's not fair to me. No. See, you have to pay me the money. But what if you make my $600 back before I see you tomorrow? Then you give me the check. I don't owe you nothing at that point. That is going to force you to sell it at that point to get me off the hook and give you a little money. Then you write me the check and I will write you a check. I think we have a problem here. It's a symbolic exchange of funds to keep the records straight. Will you symbolically rip it up in front of me after I give it to you? No, I will cash it and you will cash the check I give you. No, I don't trust you. Oh, come on. See, you can trust me but I don't trust you. Oh my God. You're insane. You're too much, man. You're insane. The deal is I have to give you the $600 that you just invested on this stock that's not yippee. Right? Right. Okay. I think we need to go to the phones. So logically, if you make my $600 back before I see you tomorrow, why do I owe you anything? I understand what you're saying. Yeah. Realistically speaking, you're off the hook. You would have never invested that money if it wasn't for me. Oh man, I probably would have. Realistically speaking, you're right. Okay. But symbolically, I want that check. I want you to write a check to me for the amount of money that that cruise cost. And how come it's $600 now and not six and change like it was? Was it six and change? I don't even know. I got to pull up my statement. Hey, Lewis, what's up? Dude, Anthony, are you Italian? Yeah. Because what kind of pussy Italian guy can't collect money from a wuss Irish? First of all, I'm not Irish. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. White guy. White guy. I mean, any Italian guy worth his weight in Provolone has got to be able to collect money from a puss like, oh. How easy. I mean, come on. All right, Lewis. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Jeez. Let's go to Paul. Paul, what's up? Hey, what's up, Paul? How are you? Listen, it's just like if you work or deal with a brokerage firm. You could buy a stock and on the same day sell it, it's a quadruple. But you still got to send a payment in. Send the check. Send the check. Anthony, sorry. I'm sorry. I've got to take a minute. I love you both. Am I right, Anthony? You've got to send the check in. You are absolutely right. To the brokerage firm. You're killing me. Thank you. You're killing me. Come on, Oprah. You're trying to get out of this and it's not fair. You are. You're killing me. I'm washed up and I know my stuff, baby. All right, Paul. You love your both. You're the great syndication like yesterday. All right, bye. Yup. You're killing me. That's just not fair. Mike, what's up? Yeah. I don't understand. You own Six In Change. Yeah. And now he's going to extend and you're going to own another Six In Change and he won't get the first check. No, no, no, no. He already put the order in, first of all. Yeah. Right. All he's doing is taking the money that I owe him and he just invested it to try to make my money back. I'm doing Opie a little bit of a favor here. Yeah, but you pulled him out of the hole and you haven't seen the first 600. By letting him off the hook. Yeah, technically. It's just, uh, it's 1200 down right now. No, I'm not. No, no, because you- Because that's $600 of your money you just punched in. Right, but you have to pay me the money. You have to give me the check. What are you going to pay your fucking boss? I said technically, you're 1200 in the hole. He better give me that check. All right, Mike, thank you. No problem. Why is everyone saying that you're getting screwed? Joe. Yeah. Hey. Dude, Anthony, you're getting screwed. How? You owe him, he owes you 600 in change, right? Yeah. Right. So basically you're investing as a favor to him. Yes. Would you have invested the money if you weren't doing a favor for him? Yes, you would have. Oh, you would have. Okay. Come on, this stock is down this much today. I'm in. All right, so he should give you that $600 then because what's happening is you're putting in your own money and- But Joe, Joe, Joe, listen to me and then tell me what I should do. All right. All right, uh, Ant, just invest the money I owe him, okay? Right. He's trying to make- But it's his own money. All right, I understand that, but he's trying to make my money back, right? Right. Okay. So at the time I see him, this thing doubles, shouldn't he sell and then we call it even? And then I don't have to pay him anything? Symbolically, you must write me the check in good faith. I think he should have to give you the money regardless. All I'm saying is- Yeah, you should, you know why? Because you should have written the goddamn thing today. I know, I- Right now. I did screw up. I did forget. Another thing, guys. Yeah. I work with the Special Olympics and uh, walking used to be our shortstop. Yeah. He left to pursue his singing career and I was wondering if uh, Spaz wants to fill his spot. Spaz? We'll round in? We'll have to ask Spaz. He might want to. Thank you, Joe. All right, thanks. Bye. All I'm saying is like, logically, because this is getting boring. Yeah. If I see you tomorrow and the money's still invested and you haven't made anything back yet, you're even maybe a little down, a little up, then obviously I have to give you the money at that point. Yeah. If I see you tomorrow and you've already sold the stock and you made my money back plus you made some for yourself- I still want your check. I want it run through the bank. I want it cashed. I want you to get the returns check. I have enough funds there. Come on! Yeah, right. Oh, he doesn't have $600 in his account. Yeah, give me his wallet. No! Give me that thing, man. That's not going to do you any good. Look at that. He never carries cash. Look at that pathetic condom. It's been sitting there for years. Look at it. It's worn a hole right through the back of the wallet. No, I want that. Yeah, see, I want that as a symbolic gesture. All right, then that's what I'll do. By the way, the stock that's not yippy, just drop two points. So how much have you lost on my money? Don't worry about it. I'm not even realizing it. But don't you worry about it. Oh my God. All right, we've got to take a break. Oh wait, let's talk to Karen real fast. Move on to something else here. Karen, what's up? Hey, I just wowed a guy. I'm on 109 in Woodbridge and he ignored me. Really? He's in a B&D electrical truck. Did he know what was going on? Did he see your boobs? They were there. Maybe you're just, you know. Oh no, I'm telling you. They were there. He took the visor, he put it to the side and put his hand right by his face so he couldn't see me and I'm like, what the hell? That means you have an ugly set. They're not ugly. What do they look like? What do they look like? They're nice looking. I don't know, it doesn't make sense. Guys want to check out boobs no matter what they look like. I don't know, unless he was gay. But he totally ignored me. I don't know. Well, thank you, Karen. I don't know what to tell you. Try it again and let us know if someone else is more appreciative. All right? All right. Bye. Yeah, Opiea, also I'm going to have to charge you with capital gains tax on this. You bastard. So now I have to pretty much make the money one and a half times in order to cover. Well, you just let me know how my money does tomorrow. Jessica. Yes. How are you, Jessica? Fine. How are you? Good. I want to know why you have to pay it back and Sandy's not paying it back. Bingo. And why she did it in the first place. Bingo. Because the girls were being a little sneaky behind our backs. See, Aunt and I are in this one together. No, no, no. Because I really had no clue. Yeah, I didn't know either until it was all done with. But I still think Sandy should pay it. She was sneaky to do it. All right. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Bye. No, I agree. Yeah, yeah. Sure. What is your problem? Listen to her. Wow. What's your problem? I don't know. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right. Thank you, Jessica. Wow, you have a problem with someone. What's the problem? Hey. It's just that I don't see why you should pay it. She shouldn't have did it. Well, that's why Aunt's making this deal with me. He understands. Exactly. And if you were going to pay it, you should have paid it months ago. Yeah, you're right. And Anthony shouldn't have to give it back to you. Well, that's the deal my pal made with me. See, I'm just, you know, because that way I'm not losing that, honey. Yes, you are. Wow, Jessica. You're on the reg today? No. You sure? No. All right. Thank you. Bye. But you have to give me the check in order to make this work. And if that's what you need, I'll do that tomorrow. I will. Tomorrow. Okay. All right. All right. Everyone has comments about this. I think we need to move on. Well, what's Mark writing? What? Someone's sleeping on the couch tonight. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. Someone's sleeping on the couch tonight. Yeah, I remember last time, I'll think. I know. It was a little bit of a rift. There was some problems. All right, we've got to take a break. We'll be back. Let's regroup here. Phone line, 212-757-1027. You can call us, call us. You treat them like, you know, good people. You don't talk down to them. Hey, f*** you. Jesus Christ, shut up. You idiot. You're such a loser. Hey, f*** you. What a witty car. You're high. What, you're stupid? Hey, f*** you. The Opie and Anthony Show. 1027 WNEW. This is Vince McMahon of the WWF. And if you love a good cage match, you're going to love Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW. Yeah. WNEW. Vince McMahon, it's a bunghole match. I got to welcome Vince back to the WWF. So much more entertainment. So much more entertaining when he's involved. Yeah. He stayed out way too long. But now he's back and I'm laughing again. I'm at home enjoying myself. Oh yeah. Raw's war and Smackdown on Thursday nights. We got our WrestleMania next weekend. Going out there. Yeah. Thank you, WWF. Yeah, we do have to thank them. We're going to have lots of stories by the time we get back from LA next week. Opie, you best bring that checkbook. I know. We're losing the money faster already out here. Paul. It seems the second I put the buy order in, this thing tanked. Really? It's all right. The whole thing is like diving. Dumping today. So what's the $600 worth at this moment? If you pulled out. Not much, though. What? $300, $400? Yeah. Oh, okay. You lost $200 in 10 minutes. That's pretty good. I'm impressed with your day trading. Hey, shut up. But yeah, the McMahon's just battling it out lately on WWF. Yeah, a lot of fun to watch. You had Stephanie McMahon slapping her mom. She gave her that little stupid slap. It was still good, though. And then Shane McMahon pretty much knocks Vince out from behind. Yeah. And then they're pummeling him with the triple H and everything. Very entertaining, though. I don't know. What is Stephanie? Because at some point, Stephanie's going to have to turn back again to being a good girl. And what's she going to do? Go back to being the shy little thing? Emphasis in the leather pants and the shirts that show her her cans? I mean, what's she going to do? It must be tougher, like, her dad, Vince. I know. To hear, like, 15,000 people just, you know, chanting, slut. Slut, slut, slut. Every time he walks out. I know. Gag or no gag, that's got to kill a father just a little bit. Stephanie, now remember, you're in a character. This is not you and us as a family. This is a character that you're portraying when they yell slut, whore, and whatnot. I think they're going to ride this one for a long time, though. Yeah, we're all four members of the family are against each other. So, I mean, they're not going to come together for a long time, I believe. No. Because they got a great storyline there. Well, you know, at WrestleMania, they usually do something kind of wacky and twisted. The storylines usually take a turn. So, I don't know what we're going to see. Well, maybe out of the four, you know, they'll pair up. Yeah. It'll be the girls against the guys or... I don't know. Shane's got to be against Vince. Yeah. So, maybe the kids against the pairs. Maybe that, yeah. That's a good one. But I'm hoping to get someone from the WWF on the show before the end of the week to promote WrestleMania. That'd be cool. Yeah. I know they listen to us up there in Connecticut. Rick's on vacation. So, if you're trying to get ahold of us, just ask for my extension and we'll work something out, OK? Right. Hey, Anthony, all this week we got tickets to opening day at Chase Stadium. It's going to be what, next Monday? Yeah. You and I were supposed to go, but we're going to be flying back from LA. Yeah. We had this great concept. We were going to take like 100 listeners, hang out, opening day, have a lot of fun, all sit together and all that. This wrestling trip came up, so we passed it on to Psycho Mark. It's still going to be a great time. Yeah. You're going to be there with at least 100 of our listeners. It's all courtesy of SmallWorld.com. What you do is sign up today for Small World Baseball at SmallWorld.com. They're a fantasy baseball website, Anthony. A lot of people into the fantasy baseball. Yeah. It's the best fantasy baseball on the web. SmallWorld.com. Thank you guys for giving us all these tickets, OK? And I think we're going to blow out 20 right now. Whoa. We're going to play a little contest. Give them to the sports fan. All right? OK. A quick contest. So, if you're calling in, you're going to have to guess. It's a very simple contest, Anthony. Recently, there was a poll. I'm not going to tell you where because then you're going to look it up and get the answers. And we don't need that. They ranked the top 25 sports films of all time, Anthony. Yeah. Top 25 sports films of all time. Sports films. We are looking for the top five. Top five sports films of all time. So, we'll go to the phones. All you have to do is pick one out of the top five. Right. And you will win a four-pack of tickets to see the Mets opening day with Psycho Mark. OK. One of the top five. Very easy contest. At the least, you could guess. I'm sure we all know of a few sports films off the top of our head, right? Yeah. I need a list. I can play along at home. Here, write the top ten down for Anthony. We'll stall here for you. Thank you. Huh? You see in the meantime that American Beauty chick? She got married. Got married? Yeah. You find her attractive, though? She's kind of wacky looking. She kind of looks like one of those aliens from... She was definitely hot in American Beauty, but I don't know. She looks like that alien chick from Mars Attacks. Remember that came into the White House and bit the guy's finger off? Martin Shorth's finger? That's pretty good. I'm a little outraged. Why? I don't really agree with this. Why? She's 21 years old and she's with this 38-year-old guy? I'm disgusted by that. All right. That's a nice inside joke. Three people got that one. That was good. Yeah. Okay. She looked pretty good in the movie. Without a doubt, she did. Especially when she was hanging out in that bathtub of rose petals or whatever it was. Yeah. All right, Ant. I think Ben's got the top ten for you. I got my list. You got yours. Very easy. We're giving away med tickets for opening day. This coming Monday with Psycho Mark. I don't agree with this already. I don't either. That's ridiculous. I'll tell you which one I think should be number one after the contest is over with. Number one shouldn't be number one. That was a great movie, though. Oh, get out of here. Great movie. All right. Here it is. We want to thank, once again, SmallWorld.com for giving us the tickets. Let's do it. All right? A recent poll, top 25 sports films of all time. We are looking for the top five. All you need is to get one from the top five and we'll give you a four-pack of tickets to opening day Monday with Psycho Mark. All right? Let's randomly go down here.

Oh, man. Thank you, Mike. All right. All right. Let's go with Sam. Sam on line nine. What's up, Sam? Looking for the top five sports films of all time. Your guess? Field of Dreams. Field of Dreams. Yes. Yes. All right. That was number two. Number two. Only one film beat. Field of Dreams, top 25 sports films of all time. Sam, where are you calling from? I'm calling from Deer Park. I'm at work. All right. You got a four-pack of tickets to see the Mets opening day this coming Monday, okay? Yes. Thanks a lot. All right. Hold on the line. Someone's going to get your info. Okay. And make sure they pick up line nine. Sorry, but someone beat you to it, okay? Let's go to line 11. Tom. Yo, what's up, guys? Hey, Tom. Looking for the top five sports films of all time. The Naturals got to be on there. The Naturals. Yes. Yes. Where are you calling from, Tom? Psi Osset. Psi Osset. You got a four-pack of tickets to opening day at Shea, okay? Cool, man. All right. Hold on the line. We're going to get your info. Yep. Psi Osset. Psi Osset. The Naturals came in number three, by the way. Cool. Thanks, guys. All right. Hold on the line. Still looking for, what do we got? Three more. Four packs for you to give away. Let's go. Okay. Let's go to, where am I? Let's go here. Justin. Yeah. We're looking for the top five sports films of all time. How about Raging Bull? Raging Bull. This is like Family Feud. Is that your final answer? Yeah. Raging Bull was number 10 of all time. Yeah, thanks, boys. According to this poll, but thanks for playing, okay? All right. All right. Let's go to Anthony. Anthony. Yes. What's going on? Where are you calling from? New York. All right. You got a guess? We're looking for the top five sports films of all time. Slapshot. Slapshot. Thank you. Well, you lose, first of all. But let me tell you something. I would have put it in the top five. I would have put it number one. I would have put Slapshot. The number that come in. Number nine. All righty. Sorry about that. Thank you. But if I was making this list, Slapshot would have been at the top. Slapshot was great. Best sports film of all time. Yeah, Coach. Remember we got drunk with the brothers? With the Hanson brothers, yeah. They were doing some kind of an appearance up in Boston at the All-Star game up there when we went. And they were all tanked. Well, first of all, we never went to the game. Yeah, we just hung out in the bar. We never made it. The bar was in the same building as that. Well, it was in Boston. You know, we got to stop the contest for a second. I mean, keep calling with your guesses, but we have a good story to tell right here. We got so loaded with the Hanson brothers. That we didn't make it into the game. No, because the last radio station we worked with, they came up with a pretty good idea. We get a lot of wacky ideas thrown at us. This idea was go to the NHL All-Star game with Opie and Anthony in a limo. Right. I liked the idea. Sure. Okay. It's nice we get to see the All-Star game. Sure. A couple of listeners get to see it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There was a few problems with this plan. Game started at 8. We picked up our listeners at 2. You do the math. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, Danny. By 2, by 2.05, because one of our friends who's a bar owner went with us as well. Yeah. By 2.05, we are already slamming down our first Long Island Ice Tea, I believe. Yeah. It was something very similar to a Long Island Ice Tea. And one of the listeners was chugging tequila straight out of the bottle in the limo. He was wrecked before we even got two miles down the road, I think. He was drinking so much tequila that at the stoplights he was getting out and puking on the double yellow line. Remember that? We stop at one point and he goes, where are you going? He's like, one minute, I'll puke. He just whoops, gets back in and he's like, whew, ready to party again, man. And he keeps drinking. See, the problem was we went with an ex-Marine and I believe a frat guy from this college. We were so freaking snotted by the time we made it to the Fleet Center. Yeah, we get to the Fleet Center. There's a bar right in the same building, so you don't even have to get this. You didn't even have to go outside from the bar into the arena to see the All-Star Game. Just had to go upstairs. Upstairs, through a hallway, we're in. We're in the building. We never made it out of the bar. We watched the All-Star Game with the Hansen Brothers on TV drinking. It gets better than that, though. I'm not sure. What's wrong with you? Drink, you fag. Don't quote me on this, but I think one of these huge beer companies was the sponsor of the NHL All-Star Game that year in Boston. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Oh, I forgot about this. They gave us the tickets. Yeah, we had like really good tickets. For the NHL All-Star Game, everyone in Boston wanted to go. We had two for Aunt and I and two for these two listeners. We had four primo seats. Big promotion, promoted it on the radio station, this beer company and all, right? Yeah. And what did we do with our tickets? We were drunk in the bar, and then we went outside and scalped them. We didn't give them to someone to scalp. Your pals, Opie and Anthony, went on the street and scalped the tickets. And taped the whole thing. Hey, man, you need tickets? Who needs tickets? Who needs tickets? It was like, we walked out of the Fleet Center, and when we announced we had tickets to the NHL All-Star Game, it was like throwing chum in the middle of the ocean and watching the sharks attack. It was amazing. We almost got killed. We taped the whole damn thing. And we're trying to be cool so we don't get arrested. Right. So it's like, okay, well, meet me behind this pole and give me the money, but don't give me the money. You give him the money. Like, Opie would get the money for my tickets, and I'd get the money for his tickets, and then you'd have to go to Opie to get the tickets. Right. Like, Opie had a scheme planned. We made a bloody fortune. And we're all on these tickets. We were hammered. We taped the whole thing with a little mini recorder, and then we put it on a radio show the next day. Yeah, we implicated ourselves. Oh, we got in so much trouble, man. Yeah, because they're like, oh my God, you know, we go through to get tickets for you guys on these things, and if the sponsors think you're just going to go out and scalp them, they're never going to give you tickets again. Yeah. So then we're in the bar, because now we don't have tickets, and the game's right upstairs, you know. We're just snotted. Next thing you know, we run into our listeners. Yeah. We're like, dude, you guys should be upstairs watching the game. Oh, man, we scalped our tickets. They scalped them, so we hopped in the limo and went to a topless joint with the money we got from the tickets. We were so hammered. We got home that night drunk off our ass, smelling like whore. Right. We got in so much trouble. You're supposed to be home by, honestly, I think we said like, ah, it's a stupid, you know, promotion with the listeners. We'll probably leave by, you know. We'll leave after the second period. We'll be home by, you know, 10, 30. We'll go out for a late dinner, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And what time did we show up? It was somewhere between 4 and 5, something like that. Probably closer to 5. Just drunk. The whore perfume from the booby dances all over you. Because we had, I mean, we blew all the money. We made scalped tickets on topless dances. How was the game? It was good, man. It was good. My girlfriend got me back so bad because I was so hungover. Not only Saturday, because I think it was on a Friday night, not only Saturday, but Sunday as well. And she wouldn't help me out at all. Well, it sucked so bad. The All-Star game was what? In like February? I think it's the beginning of February, somewhere around there. Yeah. I still had Christmas lights up at the apartment. I had to take the Christmas lights down as punishment. Like, I'm hungover. I'm ready to woof. It was still, there's still snow on the ground. It's cold. It's Boston. I'm just like, oh my God, I'm going to puke. I don't feel very good. Get up. Take the Christmas lights down, four in the morning. We were at least able to function. I was dry heaving from my butt. That's how bad it was between the food and the booze. No, it wasn't even that. It was just dry heaving from the butt. There was contractions, but nothing was going on. Really? Oh my God. What a day. What a day for sport. Then we get back to the station on Monday and everyone's like, hey, how was the game and stuff and the promotion? We're like, I'm good. We'll be talking about it on the radio in about two hours. Yeah. You might want to listen. Remember the one listener got out on the way back home at a convenience store. He gets out of the limo. He's like, pull over. I want to get something. We figured, you know, because everyone's, they've just been puking and stuff. We figured he's getting a Slurpee or an iced tea or something. He gets out, pukes all over the parking lot of the 7-Eleven, goes in, and he's like, goes in, comes out with a six of beer. Yeah, man. This guy was a partier, man. It was nasty, man. It was a lot of fun, though. We got in so much trouble with the boss, though. He's like, you guys realize that scalping's illegal and you're playing the tapes on the air? We said it's not going to give us tickets. You blew it on a booby bar. We sounded so pathetic on the tape, too. Who needs tickets? Everyone's just screaming. All right, fun day for hockey. Is that really Jay Moore on line six? Oh, yeah. Jay! Gentlemen. Hey. Are you in town? I'm in town Monday. I just did a, I just put a little deal together for Monday at Rascals in West Orange. Oh, yeah? You son of a bitch. Look at you. But scalping is only illegal if you sell it for more than the face value of the ticket. Oh, believe me, we did. Jay, we made... Okay, I thought maybe you were so drunk you were selling them for like six bucks. Six bucks. Three or four times our money. This was a hot ticket. You know what's funny about that guy puking in the parking lot? I always talk about that. Guys don't care if they get sick. Like when women get sick, it's like a one-woman Broadway show. They've got like a chorus and dancers, girls holding their hair back. Somebody hold my hair back. Guy puked. That just means you have more room for beer. Yeah, more beer. Like that guy puked and he had to run to the store because he realized he had to fill up that room that he just excavated. That's so true. Hey, Jay, how happy are you that your next movie has an Academy Award winning actor in it? I was at the improv in Tempe and I was jumping around like, I'm in a hit movie. I'm happy. And is this his next movie that's coming out or does he have something else? Oh yeah, no, this is it. This is it, his follow-up to his Academy Award winning performance, Kevin Spacey. When is it coming out, Jay? It's coming out Monday at Rascals and West End. You're a whore! You whore! She's a whore. Hey, were you on Conan last night? Hey, want to hear something funny? Yeah. I'm at the improv in freaking Tempe, Arizona. I'm on stage like maybe 20 minutes and from the back left of the room, there's 450 people here. Is that a train? I go, what? I go, you've got to be kidding me. The guy goes, is that a train? O&A! I go, O&A listener? We got O&A listener? And then the guy straight-faced me and ignores me. I'm like, oh that's nice. I've got a mic in a spotlight. Great, that rocks. I'm like, what are you, a sniper? You hacko and you go into your little phone, right? That rocks. He actually screams that. And then after the show he's like, I'm the one that yelled, is that a train? I'm like, thank you for freaking helping me out there in the show, Mongo. Mongo. He says, I'm from Long Island. You've got to call him and tell him you met me. I'm like, no, I think it's the other way around, jackass. All right, Jay. Are you guys having a, sorry. What? I called last week, Monday, and Rick said, no, they're on vacation. Then I called like Tuesday and Rick said, they're on vacation. Yeah, we're on the whole week. Dude, they're off for the week. I'm like, oh. You finally figured it out. What are you doing? Are you doing a guest thing on some guy's radio show? Jim Rohn? Yeah. In May. Oh, in May? Oh, they're writing about it like crazy over here. Yeah. What? Like on the radio message boards and stuff. I always host that show. Oh, yeah. It's AM Sports Talk. Unfortunately, we don't get it. I would like to listen. The best show. It's syndicated in 153 markets. I hear he's pretty good. It's unbelievable. It's no, it's no, is that a train or a map of Hawaii? I was going to say, I thought we were unbelievable, Jay. I talked to Deena Cola. Yeah. And I told him he should be calling you guys pissed off with your case with song contest. He should be getting ASCAP money for every time someone wins a contest. Well. If he rolls a card, he's going to get a $100,000 prize. I'm going to get a $100,000 prize. I think he's just drunk. He really is a drunk. That friggin' contest though, you should hear some of these songs. They are so utterly tasteless. The worst thing I've ever heard is that they're so, so good. I mean, I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. I've never heard of them. He really is a drunk. That friggin' contest though, you should hear some of these songs. They are so utterly tasteless. The worst things you could ever imagine going out over the air. Well let's give them a little sample. Which one? He was all over the carolines and somebody yelled out, SBA. I'm like, that's great. He's like, no Jay, full blown AIDS isn't something I want people pointing at me and yelling. You want to hear a few of the samples that we've been playing lately? I'll play it Monday at Rascals. Look at you. How many shows are you doing at Rascals Monday? One show Monday definitely. Then we're going to try to push it Tuesday and Wednesday. That means we'll be hearing a lot from you the rest of the week. Well you sound disappointed. I'm just, whoa I almost cursed. I'm just effing with you. Man, I love you. I called when I had nothing to promote. I was there the whole day for no reason. Jay, you don't have to explain yourself. Listen, you've got to hear a sample of our latest most offensive song entry. And then I'll give you the top five sports movies. No, no, you can't wreck it for everyone. I'm going to try to push it. I'm going to try to push it. I'm going to try to push it. I'm going to try to push it. I can't say because then people will look it up on the internet. I can tell you mine. Alright, let's hear yours. Top five sports films of all time. Five to one, ready? Mm-hmm. Bad News Bear, As Long As George, Hoosier, Rocky, Jeremy Lincoln. Curse of the leg. Freaking Money in the Bank, man. Well, you got one right. Well, I don't care what they think. Is that your final answer? I don't care what they think. I don't care what they think. Is that your final answer? No, no, no, no. Those are the top five. What about Slapshot? You know what? I had that five and I crossed it out because it needed a comedy. Bad News Bear. Slapshot is a great movie. According to this list, it came in ninth. James Conn, I had Slapshot fifth and I crossed it out for the comedy. Really? Alright. Lean into it, Lupus. Come on, you don't quote Slapshot. That's true. Alright, listen. You've got to hear like just 30 seconds of this. You're just like the young boys. That's right. Why do you think I umpired in high school? I got to crouch down by that little 12 year old's cat. Alright. And we used to play that game and it did two fingers or my penis. Classicals Monday. You're a pizzeria, man. We really got to strike. Let me pull it out. Jay, we want to run down some of the entries in the most offensive song contest. I'm excited when I talk to you guys. You were the one who started this contest. Mike DeNicola started Full Blown AIDS. Well, we have songs that beat that. Did you hear Baby Raper yet? Oh God. Yeah, see? This is the level these songs are at. Some Full Blown AIDS has become pain. Yeah, did you hear? I can actually take some credit for it. Yeah, believe me. Did you hear? Oh my God, that's a Mike DeNicola, Steven Lynch. Did you hear Killefetus yet? Killefetus? Yeah, that's a good one. What about, I heard DeNicola told me Camp Concentration was pretty neat. That's a good one. Did you hear the KKK man done to the Candyman? No, I heard DeNicola told me that was a good one too. That is really nasty. DeNicola couldn't sing it to me on the phone. A, he can't sing, but B, he kept laughing so hard. He couldn't get like a line out. He would go, no wait, wait, listen. Okay, it's really bad. And Jay, this one came in yesterday. We just got to give you 30 seconds of it. Alright? When you're bored, just scream and we'll stop it. I don't think I'll be bored. Alright, here we go. Each time I see a little girl, eight or nine or ten, I can't resist the urge to stick my tongue inside of them because I'm horny. For little girls, for little girls, have hairless little tw**ts. I'm horny. For little girls, I get them hot on alcohol and pot. That little butt's a rabbit so tight and shiny, it makes you want to stash your junk inside her h**t. I'm horny. For little girls, I want to bang them all. Sometimes as young as one or two. And then I kill them when I am full. There's a little sample there. Is that Marie Chevalier? Yeah, Chevalier. Isn't that great? It was Chevalier, wasn't it? Yes. I'm trying to think what rhymes with... Oh God. What is this? You can say hi. Why didn't you say KK, man? You want to hear parts of the KKK, man? That's a little too real. I think that's more... This guy was writing more from hatred. We had to get permission from our black listeners before we would even air this one. Are you all dirty? No, we have a few more than that. Are you ready for this? I heard when... Who's that pig, that porn star that was like... Oh, that b**ch that came in? No, the other one with the horse teeth. I was in... Last time I was at Roscoe's. I called you guys up and she was on spectrovision. I cranked one out while you guys were talking. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Animal. Animal, right. She could eat an apple through a picket spanner. A wood chipper, yeah. She's cold, though. She was thinking she got a hatchet fight and forgot to bring hers. When she was on, I heard OD just took a chunk out. Yeah, she's pretty hot in person. No. Yeah, she's not bad at all. She looks like a prostitute. Aren't they all? Yeah, I guess, but she's one you can afford. All right, Jay, here it is, the song everyone's talking about. Ready? I can't wait. All right, everybody, gather around. The Ku Klux Klan's here. What kind of n*****s you want? Burnt n*****s, hang n*****s, happy head n*****s, concrete n*****s and cement shoes. Anything you want, you come to the right man, because I'm the KKK man. Who could take a n*****? Hang him from a tree. Burn across his lawn and kill his family. The Ku Klux Klan. The Ku Klux Klan can. The Ku Klux Klan can cause the spill of the world with hate and wear. A funny wife, who can kill Bill Cosby. Orton Urkel too. Bring back the little rascals, make Loima smell like poo. The Ku Klux Klan. The Ku Klux Klan can. The Ku Klux Klan can cause the spill of the world with hate and wear. A funny wife, the gay KKK hates. All these stupid apes, I'm sure they're gonna get enough. I'm saying I'm... Turn it off! Sir! That's all he could say. Turn it off! All of a sudden he's in the movie Hardcore. Turn it off! Turn it off! N*****s, n*****s, n*****s! I'm scared. Oh man, hang it up. Hang it up. Now, Jay. Please turn it off. It's off. If you're my friend, you'll turn it off. Listen to me. I can hear it! Oh wait, maybe it's... I'm hanging up now. No, it's off. No, this is... Now, you gotta realize what the contest is. It is the most offensive song contest. It's just some word that just wrote me the wrong way. Right, what was it? Was the... The Klan. You know what it is? You don't want the half-assed offensive songs. You gotta go for broke. This is probably... you probably just heard the winner. Because I can't think of another song that could be as offensive. Hey, Jay, you started this contest. Yeah, you're responsible. I learned it from you, okay? I learned it from you. How many times do I have to tell you? When you roll a joint, you have to curl the end. Remember this question? Yeah. I learned it from you. Okay. I learned it from you. That one's like... like you said, it's kind of got like the hatred in it. It's just... it's pure hate. And your show is all about the love. Pure hate. Yeah, what... yeah. That's why you guys... like when I... when I get pissed off when Howard's like, you guys are copying him, I always tell my friends, I go, when Howard tells jokes, it's all kind of based in meanness. And everything you guys do is based in like just having a great time. And like you love your listeners and your listeners love you and it's just fun. But that's fun to do. I mean, the other one was like disturbing, but it's just kind of retarded and funny. Like that guy really doesn't go out and like, you know, see a character. But this guy, I don't know, the way... I mean, the guitar was just kind of attitude enough. It was like a redneck Altamont. Yeah, we're not... we're not proud of that one, Jay, but... I think Full Blown Aids is better than both of them. Really? You think? I don't know. Either which would come forward. Oh, he will never ever come forward. And he's being a douche to the show? No, he's probably too busy or something. He's drunk. All right, Jay, a piece of another one here. Real fast, real fast. Okay, but that one... You know who loves that one? I bet Psycho Mark masturbates to that song. Oh, you should have seen him. He was dancing around the studio with a huge Confederate flag when I was playing. I remember when he dropped an N-bomb near me when I was in the studio. Yeah. He said, the country Niger with an extra G. Right. I just looked at him and was like, dude, don't ever say that again. Are you crazy? He is crazy. Jay's a black man. He's psychotic. I'm black. I'm an honorary member, my man. I call O.D. my nigga and get away with it. Right. He is my nigga. O.D., you're listening, baby. You know you're my nigga with peeps and all that, my man. I'm trying to get that song off the air because it ain't correct, son. It ain't correct. All right, listen, another piece of another entry. It ain't done, B. What's up? Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. We've been standing, but we're bad. Two pure nurses, we're never leaving. But there's lots of fun still to be had. Activities. Today we're working on left jays. It's hard, but they're teaching me how. Has anybody seen my mother? Her shower should be finished by now. Oh, God. They're pretty good. Oh, God. Yeah, pretty bad. Old economics. Today they're teaching me cooking. And boy, these ovens are big. Has anybody seen my father? I made this especially for him. Welcome to camp concentration. I got a south park thing going. The only thing that song has going against it is it's like a good 20 seconds before the first joke. Her shower should be done by now. And you're like, where's the joke? And then it's done by now and you go, all right, that was a long way to go. Full blown AIDS right at the top. I lost three teeth and all my friends. I had scar-cheek sarcoma all over my face. I went to give blood. They showed me the door. I went to sit up and I fell down and hit my head on the floor. Pretty bad. It was all AIDS. Damn that whore. You remember every line. Look at you. You're proud of that one. Mike Inacola is such a lyricist. It's like Jungle Land. You remember every word. Yeah, just like it. Well, tell Lynch to come out of his little pussy shell. All right. Play the song. I just think it's great that Mike Inacola is on stage and people scream out full blown AIDS with other comics watching. Hey, Jay. What's up? I got something for you, but you need to give me an address. OK. In front of me, I have the Jimmy Page, Black Crow's CD. Wow, what? Yeah. I mean, did they make them for real or did they do it? You can only get it through the Internet. Oh, man. They have a problem distributing this because. You know what? I'll be there. I'll be in your studio Monday. We're not going to be in Monday. It doesn't matter. I'll just go pick up the CD. All right. Well, we got one with your name on it. It's unbelievable. I know you're a big Black Crow's fan. It's two discs. Maybe send them to my New York apartment. Yeah, definitely. You guys aren't going to be there Monday? No, we're flying back from LA. I think one time off, then like. I know. We're not happy. Well, we're kind of happy. It sounds like a teacher. We're going to be out in La La Land. Oh, that's right. Oh, now I remember the WWF stuff. Yeah. With the half-breed. Yeah. Yeah. That guy's on TV more than I am. I noticed. But I got a disc with your name on it, right? Dude, I would worry. But SAD is producing today. He's going to screw up my address. No, no. He's going to mail it to UNICEF. No, what I'll do is I'll. No, Ben. UNICEF nothing? I got Ben to my left here. It was funny. What? You're going to UNICEF nothing? All right, give the plug. That was good. All right. Rascals, Monday. Hey, New Jersey, wake up, baby. J-Mor is coming back. Rascals, Monday. J-Mor. He wowed them at Rascals. Wowed them last time. All right. I got new material. Oh, yeah? About four minutes worth. If you want to get laid, bring your lady to Rascals. Bring your bitch, you're trying to say. Bring your bitch to Rascals. I'll get you laid. I do some of these jokes about Mohawks and triangles. You can't stop thinking about it. You take your junk out in the car. How'd you like the show? Who cares? Look at this. What, you saw on the phone? Yeah. I love you guys. And put me on hold for my address. And so, Monday, you're out. Damn it, you're here. But I can call you in LA from here. Yeah, and we'll be on the phone here. It's like cross-pollinization. We'll work it out. I'm such a whore, I'll find out a way to promote it. All right, cool. J-Mor, you're going to UNICEF nothing? I got Ben to my left here. J-Mor. J-Mor. J-Mor. J-Mor. J-Mor. J-Mor. Hey, you guys, I appreciate it. But KKK, man, gotta go. Well, yeah, we're not happy about it. But if you're going to have a most offensive song contest, you can't sugarcoat it. Absolutely. I know, but I'm black from the way down and I find it offensive. All right. Hey, Monday night is already sold out. Who said that? Some dude on the instant feedback. We can't really confirm that. Call for yourself. Well, then we're doing Tuesday, too. No one knew. No one knew it was going to turn out to be ten shows again. No, I mean, if Monday sold out, the deal is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, if all goes according to plan. Ah, so that's promote one day at a time. Let me start off easy. All right, you're starting off easy. Call Rascals for ticket info on J-Mor, all right? Hey, but most importantly, you guys rock. And in Tempe, there was a guy in the audience representing. That's pretty cool. Are you going to be in that? Tempe, Arizona. You going to do the show next week? Your show? It depends on how ticket sales go, huh? No, I'm doing it regardless. All right, cool. You guys are here. Yeah, because we're. No, we'll be back Tuesday. Oh, OK. Oh, totally. OK, definitely. You'll be here. You'll be in New York Tuesday. Yeah. All right. Can I be your welcome home guy? Yes, you can. Want me to bring up hoards or something? We got to play the next round of What's in My Pants. Oh, we should get hacking on the phone. We'll do it. All right. You want me to call an SQA team if Anthony get his junk polished? What do I need my junk polished for? What a homo. Need a reason? All right, Jay. Listen, we got to go. All right. I love you guys. Put me on hold for the address. Yeah, you got to get this black and rose. All right. Have a safe flight. All right. There he goes. Jay Moore, everyone. He'll be in next week. Ben, line six with Jay. And we got to take a break and then we'll give out the rest of the Met tickets, OK? All right. We're in the middle of playing the top five sports films of all time. You just got to pick one from the top five. We have three slots left and you will win a four-pack of tickets to opening day this coming Monday, OK? Right. We'll be back right after this. The Opie and Anthony Show. Here's just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting. Hail to the kings of the radio. 1027 WNEW. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. I want to thank Jay Moore for checking in. We were all wondering what happened to him. Turns out he's going to be at Roskills this coming Monday. Looks like he's going to be camping out there again. What a coup for him, huh? The star of his next movie, Kevin Spacey, wins an Academy Award Best Actor so they can push that angle. He might actually be in a movie that people say is good at the box office. No, Jerry Maguire is a huge... He knows we're just joking with him. Who else is in that movie, do you feel like? What? Helen Hunt and the small kid from Sixth Sense. Oh, the kid from Sixth Sense? The kid from Sixth Sense? Yeah. You should ask Jay if he's had sex with him yet. Come on. Jay's going to be in... No one Jay is going to be in all next week. The show is going to be right back into homoland. We've been out of homoland for a good solid month. God damn, he's out of here and we have girls taking baths together and in the kiddie pool. We're going to have to bring back the lesbian bath. Yes. Yeah. It's all by our butt plugs. Going back into homoland, Jay's coming back. Back into the gay zone. Getting back into the gay zone. Just when everyone was proud of us that we went back to being hetero. Yeah, well you know what happens when Jay comes in. All right, Anthony, where are we? Hey! Exactly. We're in the middle of giving away these tickets to see the Mets. Opening day at Chase Stadium. Yeah. Where were we? We have four packs of tickets to give away. We started this little contest. There was a recent poll. Top 25 sports films of all time. Yeah. I think right off the top of our heads we could all think of a bunch of sports films. All we're asking you guys to do is come up with the top five. We have three slots left by the way. Field of Dreams made the top five. The Natural made the top five. Yeah. And that was it. Okay, we got three to go. That's right. All right? All you need to do is come up with one of them and we will give you a four pack of tickets opening day. With that, let's go to line seven. Hi, who's this? Hey, who's this? Hello? Yeah, it's you, man. Hey, what's going on? It's Starrett. Starrett? Yep. All right, where are you calling from, Starrett? Fairfield, Connecticut. Very good. We love our listeners in Connecticut. Yes. Right on, right on. We'll get up there eventually. We're looking for the top five sports films of all time. You come up with one of them, you got a four pack of tickets opening day, Chet. Never seen it, heard a lot about it. I'm thinking Rudy. Rudy, great movie. Rudy. Great movie. Well, that was an 11th place there, Starrett. All right. But thanks for playing, okay? No problem. All right, man. Let's go to... Take it easy, guys. Later, man. Let's go to Jeff on line one. Jeff, what's going on? Hey, O&A, what's up? How are you? I'm fine, yourself? Good. Do you care? All right, we're looking for the top five sports films of all time. How about Mr. Baseball? Mr. Baseball? That was with Tom Selleck, right? Yeah, it was. I don't even think that made the list. That was on somebody's list. In the top 25, it didn't even make the list. It didn't even make the list. It's the only list that was on. All right. Sorry about that. Let's go to Bob. Bob, you're next on NAW. Looking for the top five sports films of all time. Hi, guys. Bill Durham. Old Durham? Mm-hmm. What's your name? Yeah, but you're not Bob. I'm Bob's mom. You're Bob's mom. Bob had a run to work, so I'm calling for him. And also he told me that you guys suck. All right. All right. Well, Bob's mom, guess what? Yeah, Bull Durham is in fifth place. Oh, great. Top five sports films of all time, so that means you got a four-pack of tickets to opening day at Shea. Oh, that's so great. Thank you. Hey, Bob's mom. Yes? I'm Bob's mom. I'm Bob's mom.

We're entering the gay zone next week, it looks like, if Jay's coming back, so. We'll keep control. God. He can hear it in your voice, Hope. What do you mean? Yeah. He'll be here all week next week. You're like, ah. No, we love when he stops by. Sure. Oh my God. Sure you do. The airsick guys, not big fans of Jay Moore. No, it's very obvious. Oh, yeah. Make sure you blast off, yeah. No, I was just saying, you guys not big fans of Jay Moore. Paul, we picked up on the fact you're not a big fan of Jay. That's okay. What made you- What made- All right. Know how uncomfortable it was last time when you and Billy were in here and like Jay's on the line and Aunt and I are laughing and you guys had your arms folded and was staring forward? I have a problem with him. We pick up on things like that. What's your problem with you? Yeah, what's your problem with him? Nothing. Nothing my sphincter is going to say. Paul, say your piece. Say my piece. You're open for him there, rascals. Open for- no, actually, he was very nice to me there. Okay. He was. All right. There and then what happened? Behind the music. You know, people have two faces. Oh. That's all I'm saying. Hey, you know why Don Ho's daughter changed her name? Why? Because she'd just be a little ho then. She's not gay. I'm trying to get back to the females because I feel like it's getting into the gay zone. All right. Virgin. Paul. What? We'll talk to you soon. All right. We've got to get back to the contest. We gave you a chance to say your piece but- How about Longish Yard? Longish Yard? Longish Yard in the list here? Longish Yard, 13th place. All right, Paul. All right. Thank you. Take it easy. We have two more slots left here, Anthony. A little bit of tension there between the two camps. I see that. Interesting. We might have to delve into that when Jay returns next week. Let's go to Ty. Ty, what's going on? Pretty good. How about Rocky? Oh, Bing, Bing, Bing. I'm surprised no one mentioned Rocky. Yes. Yes. As far as the top five sports films of all time, Rocky comes in fourth place according to this list here. Good. Coming in at number four. What are we doing? The list? The list. The list. All right. Ty, hold on the line. Okay. We're going to give you a four-packet ticket to a- What was that? Okay. I'm hoping- Courtesy of SmallWorld.com. What the hell is that? I got my duck here in this room. I'm living in South Jersey. Okay. Hold on, Ty. Very good. Wonderful. Let's go to Neil. We have one left, Anthony. Yes. One four-packet ticket's left. Neil, you're next. Caddyshack. Caddyshack. Top 25 sports films of all time. Caddyshack came in at number seven. You suck. Sorry about that, Neil. We're looking for the number one movie, by the way, Ed. Yes. No one's going to get it because this wasn't the number one movie. Let's see if Joe's got it. Joe? Hey, how you guys doing? Hey. What about Chariots of Fire? Chariots of Fire, top 25 sports films of all time, number eight. Oh, I think. Sorry about that. How many times do we have to listen to that? Oh, wait. I do my Zamfier version. Here comes the big one. Thank you. Zamfier, master of the pan flute. Very nice, Anthony. Let's go to Scott. Scott? Hey, guys. What's going on? Where are you calling from, Scott? Nyack, New York. Nyack, New York. We're looking for the top 25 sports films of all time. We have one left on the list and it happens to be the number one movie according to this poll. Your answer, Scott? Who's Your's? Who's Your's? Who's Your's was number one. Ah, stupid movie. Starring Gene Hackman. It's a great movie, Ed. Oh, stop it. Number one sports movie of all time, Who's Your's. Great basketball movie. Great basketball movie, Anthony. Basketball, college basketball movie, right? Yeah. Oh, stop it. Stop. What would be your number one? Number one? Probably like Caddyshack. Well, according to- No, no, as far as like real sports, I think Rocky beats the hell out of Who's Your's just on principle. Rocky, yeah. Scott, thank you. Thank you. Raging Bull, for God's sake. I loved Raging Bull. Raging Bull beats the hell out of Who's Your's. Who cares? Scott, you got a four-packet ticket to opening day at Shea Monday, okay? Cool, guys. Thank you. Hold on the line, all right? We want to thank SmallWorld.com for giving us these tickets this week. Check out their website if you're into fantasy baseball. Anthony, real fast before we take a break here, let's just run down the top ten in the list, okay? All righty. Top ten sports films of all time according to USA. It was a USA poll. I don't want to give that away because then you can look it up on the Internet. Tenth place, Raging Bull. That would have been my pick for like number one or two. Definitely. That movie rocked. What was the line from that, Hey Ray, You Never Knocked Me Down? Ray? Hey Ray, You Never Knocked Me Down? When De Niro got the S kicked out of him. It's great. Ninth place, Anthony, Slapshot. That should have been higher on the list. Raging Bull should have been higher on the list, I think. Eighth place, Chariots of Fire. Seventh place, Caddyshack. Top ten sports films of all time according to USA. Number six, Brian Song. Who could sit through that? Number five, Bull Dorm. Number four, Rocky. Ant-Aunt Rocky should be number one. Hey, I got a glass table. Why don't you squat over it and take it dumb? I'll be underneath it and you can grab on it. Mickey, grab on me, Mickey! Yeah! Wasn't that written somewhere in some horse book? Yeah, we interviewed the horse from that book and they claim, according to their book, that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it. But you know what's better than maybe laying underneath a table, you know? Ah! Come on, baby. Why don't you open it up and give me one over the glass table? Oh, yeah, baby. That's how I like it, sloppy. Ah! Ah! I didn't start this! You started this! Yeah, good job, buddy. Yeah, good job. Oh, look at that, there's some corn in there. That's how I see it. Oh, look, I see some peanuts. Mickey, she ate peanuts, Mickey! Ah! You know, when a girl squats over a table like that, you're hoping, you know, it's a nice sloppy dump. You know, you don't want anything to pass it, girl. Yeah, baby. Oh, that's the new driver. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey, scrawl over the table, Paulie. Paulie, scrawl over the table! Ah, Paulie! Give it to me, Paulie! Ah! Oh, Paulie! Big fat ass, Paulie! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey, Paulie, where you going? Now who's going to scrawl over the table? The hell's this? Hey, Mickey! Hey, Mickey, come on over here. Scrawl over the table, Mickey. Oh, Mickey! Oh, no, look, it's burnt blood! Mickey, you drew burnt blood! Not me! I just started! You started! Ah! Ah! Mickey! Mickey, grab on the table, Mickey! Ah! Rocky's full of crab legs! Ah! Ah! Ah! Okay. Okay, where's my check? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Virgin! Scrooge-o! Grab on me, Scrooge-o! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! That's wonderful. Okay, terrific! Okay! Hey! Okay! Oh, boy. Okay, horrific! That's just the stuff. That's what they said. Well, according to that book, yeah. The book that the whore wrote that Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, actually enjoys that. Squatting him to the table. We have a brand new glass table here in front of the lesbian couch at any WI's. How long do you think it's going to take before we have that little happening? We promise, before we get fired, that we'll make that happen. Someone's doing a Cleveland Steamer on the glass table. I love it! Hey, goodbye, squat at the table. Where's he going to eat? Some brand or something? Where's he going to eat? Come on, baby. I just want you, I'm going to hold you hostage for a week straight. And I want you to eat nothing but prunes and baby food before you get hungry! Ah! Ah! You whore! You whore! Open it up and don't let me! Stop! I just tried this! Ah! You can't! Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah, it's got to enjoy that. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Hey! Hey! You never know where this cluster of his got to at any given moment, do you? Remember, kids, fart equals funny. Okay. Oh, we were at number four. This has been such a mess of a radio show today, man. Why not? I'm having fun. What the hell? So I guess we're at the top five. Top five sports shows of all time according to USA. I said five Bulldorm. Yeah, but that was about 20 minutes ago. All right, it was Bulldorm in fifth place, fourth place Rocky, third place The Natural. Yeah, give it to me. Third place The Natural. The Natural movement. I like The Natural. He's too... He's no The Natural. He don't need no K.O. Pick. He's not that stuff. He just comes out. I think it's your diet. I'm crazy! I'm crazy! Okay. Virgin. Okay. Okay, terrific. Yeah, okay, terrific to you too. All right, in second place, Field of Dreams. Yeah. And first place, top sports film of all time according to USA. Hoosiers. Hoosiers. Hoosiers. Yeah, believe it or not, we're in our thirties. You got that right. I have that to look forward to. All the guys I went to high school with, they got real jobs. They have to wear suits every day and we make fart jokes every day. John, what's going on? Hey, what's up? Hey, I just basically crap myself in the car with Don Rocky and stuff. Unbelievable. I've never... You guys are still doing all time high. All time high. That was just great. All right, I just wanted to say you guys suck. Keep up the good work. Thank you, John. All right, bye. John enjoyed that stuff. Oh, do I need a drink? Yeah, let's take a break, Anthony. Writing, we have no clue what we're doing next, but if you want to stick around, by all means do so. Okay. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. I can finally breathe again. That was damn funny, man. Hey, do we have the filter tickets to give away? Filter, one of the many great shows coming to town. Anthony? Yes, I know that. I'm looking at the concert list here. Yeah, let me look. Let's see who I want to see. All right. Korn this weekend at the Continental Arena. I'd be there if you weren't in LA. Right. Let's see who else I'd go see. Well, Ant would go see no doubt. Do we have Anthony's no doubt tickets yet? Yeah, we're good. Cool. We want a full report, Anthony. Oh, I'll give you one. Filter, play April 20th at the Hammerstein Ballroom. We have tickets to give away all this week on our show. Filter's a great band, so if you're not into Filter, please don't call to try to win these tickets. Don't get priced. I hate the people. There are so many people that win stuff on our show and never pick it up because they just want to win to win. That's bogus. I thought Veruca Salt broke up. Well, Veruca Salt is warming up for Filter, Ant today. Yeah. What's up with that? We've got to get them back in here. Yeah, like they'll even talk to us anymore. We stole their panties. We were such a mess. Yeah. We stole Veruca Salt's panties and they were so freaking pissed at us. They were really pissed. How did that story go again, Ant? I bet you on the air because we were going to go to Veruca Salt and pick up the panties. We were going to go to Veruca Salt and Bush up in Boston. Yeah. And I made you a bet on the air that I would steal one of their panties. Nina or Luis? Nina. Nina? Yeah. Yeah, Nina's panties. Yeah, I would grab Nina's panties. And we were hanging with them because we were kind of friends with them and stuff. They were on our show a bunch at our last radio job. We would get drunk with them and really get very close to screwing them. Why, come on. It was kind of funny. It was a snake on me. Screw A. Come on, you know what I mean. I told Sam we were just friends. I said very close. Don't worry about it. It was very close. The blonde one liked me. So I was going to steal the panties. I swear. I was going to steal the panties. I could have some rock star... Veruca Gays. Veruca Gays. Veruca Snacks. We would get drunk with them and stuff. Check this out. We got so close with Veruca Salt before we pulled this little stunt that Ant's about to tell. They used to dedicate songs to us. It would be a sold out show at the Fleet Center up there. It would be like what? 18,000, 19,000 people there because they were warming up for Bush. And they would send out songs to Ant and I. It was really getting close. And our girls would look at us like, What's that all about? Nothing. Now you mention why it didn't happen. Anyway. So you made this bet on the other day. I said I'll get a panty. Because we were flirting back and forth a little bit. So I'm like Ant, okay. Let's see how good you are. I want you to bring Nina's panties back to our show. I'm like sure, no problem. So I'm hanging out backstage and stuff. And I said, Can I keep these panties? You know, just grabbing at them. And she said, yeah. No, I know what it was. But you got to give them back. I want them back at some point. No, I know what it was because we were pushing it so much on our radio show. And everyone knew we were going to the show and we were going to be on stage. So you go, look, man. Everyone is counting on me to bring your panties out on stage. I need the panties. And you're like, come on, I just need them for like five seconds. I show the crowd. They'll go crazy. And then I'll give them back to you, right? Yeah. So Ant gets her panties. She takes them off. Shows the crowd. The crowd goes ballistic because all our listeners were there. And then you proceeded to keep them. Because I was going to give them away. We were going to do like a giveaway. Win Veruca's old panties. I thought we were going to make tea out of them. So I get a phone call. Get home that night. It's like three in the morning. That's the guy that used to do the TV show. The Real Rock TV. That we were part of. You have to give back those panties. Like what? Ian, what's the problem? You've got to give them back. She is so pissed off that you hit those panties. Like, you've got to drive back here and get them. I'm like, look, I'm like 20 miles out of Boston. I'm not driving back. Okay, I'll drive and pick them up. All right, they'll be hanging on the doorknob. That's what they were. They were hanging on the doorknob. That was the last time we talked to Veruca Salt. They were pissed. They were extremely pissed. We really need to get them on the phone to see if they're still pissed at you and I. It's been a couple of years now. It's okay. Nothing a little modest at seven doesn't clear up. You don't have to be embarrassed about it. Can we try to make that happen? We'll get Veruca Salt in. They'll play some songs. We'll see if they're pissed at us still. I think they're pissed at each other. Weren't they all like, didn't they break up? Supposedly they broke up because one of them was going out with the other one's boyfriend or something behind their back. That's the rumor I heard. One of them was banging Dave Grohl for a while. Right. And then, yeah, there was something that went on with each of their respective dudes. Yeah. I don't know. So I guess they figured they weren't selling any albums alone. So they hooked back up again. So they're warming up for Filter to make a long story short. And with that, we have a pair of tickets to see if they're still pissed at us. Yeah. We have a pair of tickets to see Filter. I'm telling you, Filter's great. We'll give them to the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027, okay? Okay. Anthony, we need to take a quick musical break. Yeah. I promised today that we would be featuring tracks from the Jimmy Page Black Crowe CD. Yeah. There's a problem, though. What? I've been jamming this damn disc for the last three days on the subway. Yeah. What do you got over there? What? Go ahead. Oh, this one doesn't work. Oh, it doesn't work? No, the key not assigned. Oh, I wanted that one. Yeah, you had something good. Anyway, yeah. Yeah. We were going to feature tracks from the Jimmy Page Black Crowe CD. Mm-hmm. Because I've been jamming it. I think it's cool. I want to turn some people on to it. You can't even get this disc in the record stores. You've got to go to where, Ben? It's MusicMaker.com. MusicMaker.com. I'm amazed that this thing is not available in record stores because it completely rocks. Jimmy Page and the Black Crows getting together to do a lot of Led Zeppelin classics. Yeah. So I want to feature some of the tracks, right? Good idea. I told Jay Moore about the disc on the air about what, 40 minutes ago, Ant? Yeah. Jay was so excited, he said, send me a copy? Mm-hmm. So I go, Ben, no problem. I send Jay Moore a copy of the Jimmy Page Black Crowe CD. How fast did that thing leave this studio? Not only did he send Jay Moore a copy, he sent my copy that I've been jamming for the last three days. Now I have nothing to listen to on the subway tonight. We don't have another copy laying around? Don't have any more copies. And I promised everyone we would, you know, feature tracks off this damn thing today. Yeah. So we do have the single. But like all the other stations are playing the single. I want to, like, play, like, in my time of dying or something. Yeah. I want to play, like, in my time of dying or something. All right. Well, Jay Moore's got my disc, and we'll play the single that a few stations are jamming. What up, yay? What is and what should never be. What up, yay? Quick musical break. We're going to regroup, and we'll be back. But check this out. We really like this right now. It's WNEW. O.B. and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. All right. It's the O.B. and Anthony show. Hello. All our affiliates back from their commercial breaks. All our affiliates back from their commercial breaks. All our affiliates. See you again. Apparently it is. That's why you always hear that delay in music. Yeah. Got to wait for all the affiliates to come back on their local commercial breaks. And we'd like to welcome to the network WXYZ. And we'd like to welcome to the network WXYZ. Right. Living Georgia. We're just getting ready for syndication, so. Yeah, that'll happen. Wow. It's a lot of power. They don't really carry the weight. One of these days. All right. Well, we're here. It's a radio show. And it's a complete clusterf today. But we're having fun. Our phone line is 212-757-1027. Right, Anthony? Right. Hey, a lot of people are telling us that King Gimp is going to be on HBO next month. Oh, yeah? The dude from the Oscars that was flailing all over the floor. The movie? Yeah. It's going to be shown on HBO. HBO next month. I'd like to see that. I hear there's an unbelievable scene where he makes popcorn. Why? What is he just like? I mean. Hold the Jiffy Pop handle and let him go telling me won the Oscar. That's all he'd need to do. I think it was the Post that had a big huge article on King Gimp. Yeah. The Gimp there. And there's a scene that's going to be on HBO where he makes popcorn. It takes him like forever. And then I was laughing again on the train. This guy is hilarious. I don't know if he's... Oh, yeah, a little laugh. I don't know if he's trying to be hilarious, but he's funny. So he makes the popcorn. It takes him like a really, really long time. And then half of it falls on the floor. So he falls on the floor and starts eating the popcorn right off the floor. Off the floor. It's part of this documentary, yes. Holy smoke, I got to see this. King Gimp. I'm looking forward to it. How many times have you seen the King Gimp clip from the Oscars, Anthony? Probably as many times as I've seen the Hindenburg explode and Kennedy get shot in the head. I keep rewinding the tape and just watching him fall on the floor from the Oscars. It's great. The one guy is trying to hold him and he slides and falls on the floor and starts convulsing. Well, we have a new song about the Gimp. Oh, really? About King Gimp. What do we have to thank for this? Well, we've got to thank Billy and Paul from Airsick.net. Ah. The guys that hate Jay Moore. From the people that hate Jay Moore. From the people that hate Jay Moore, they've got a great King Gimp song, Anthony. Let me tell you something. When Jay is here next week, I have a prediction to make. Can I make a little prediction? This is going to get so f'ing ugly that you're not going to believe it. See, the interesting thing, Billy. Billy. He doesn't beat around the bush ever. Right. Paul, we had Paul on the air a little while ago. And it's kind of obvious that both the guys do not like Jay Moore. They have some problem with Jay. Yeah. Which is fine. Yeah, we don't care. Because the last time we had Billy and Paul in here from Airsick, and we had Jay just having to call in from LA. And I don't know if the guys were all pissed because Jay was taking some time away from them or what, but there was some major tension. Jay's making us laugh like crazy because flat out we think he's really funny. And Billy and Paul were sitting right over there with their arms folded, not even moving, not smiling, actually grimacing basically. Frowning, if you will. Sort of annoyed. But like you said, Paul might beat around the bush a little. But Billy, oh my God. Billy tells it how it is. He just goes all out. And we called on the phone and we brought it up with him and Paul kind of wouldn't really tell us what the problem was. Remember when Billy was in here with the black guys when we were having the racial get together? Oh, that was great, yes. And one of the black guys called him Fat Guy. And he just turned around and laid into this guy. We were roaring laughing. I was proud of Billy that day. Billy does not pull punches. So if, I don't know. We just know there's a story there and if it's worth telling on the radio. Yeah, we're not getting the full gist of what's going on between these parts. I know Billy listens a lot if he wants to call in. The outspoken Billy. The outspoken Billy. We'll see if he calls in. He doesn't have to, Billy. You don't have to. But we just felt, we just saw the tension and want to get to the bottom of it. That's all. But with that said, the guys from Airsick came up with a really funny song about the King Gimp at the Oscars. You know the story. They announced the winner of the short documentary. And it was a movie called King Gimp that's going to be on HBO next month. And the King Gimp himself was there in his wheelchair and he was so excited that he fell out of his wheelchair. And it took forever for them to get him back in his wheelchair. And it was all on TV. Over a billion people watching the Oscars, everyone was in shock. In shock that he was on the floor like a flounder. Right. We personally have seen the clip at least 20 times in our back office. With that said, here's Billy and Paul from Airsick.net. Oh, King Gimp keeps falling on his head. He keeps falling. So one minute he's just sitting in his chair. The next thing you know he's on the floor flopping everywhere. Drooling from his mouth. Oh, King Gimp keeps falling on his head. He keeps falling. Oh, let's watch the Gimp go. They tried so hard to get him. Oh, forget him. It's Oscar time. Just leave him there and don't mention him. King Gimp keeps falling on his head. The next time you see him I bet he'll have a helmet on his head. King Gimp is the one. Cause I'm never gonna stop laughing at his flopping. Because he won. God damn, that was fun. I like that one. Very good. Could it be one of the most offensive songs? No. They're working on one for the most offensive song. Another one. A follow up to Killifetus. But there you have it. Billy Hine and Paul Bond from Airsick.net. Thank you. Thank you guys. A little email here about King Gimp. His name is Dan Keplinger. And in Dan's own words he dreams of doing things. He wants to skydive. He wants to skydive. What would that look like? I think it would just look like somebody falling without a parachute. Floppener wants to skydive. Loves to paint. And dreams of finding love. And he loves to make pop-cord too. We'll see that on the HBO viewing of that. King Gimp. Tom from Hofstra has an early FU, Anthony, on the Instant Feedback. A big FU to Cablevision for switching all the channels on my TV. I went to put on The Daily Show last night and the F'n Golden Girls was on. They screwed up all the channels. I hate that. I don't know why they have to do that. They switched, they swapped channels for some reason. And I was like trying to find a Nick game and now MSG is Lifetime. It's just a cluster F. It sucks. And they say it's for some FCC reason but I think it's just a F with us. Yeah, what's the big deal? Why would you have to swap Comedy Central and whatever, UPN? Why? Because when you're flipping around the channels like that, right? Yeah. I mean you know where to go. Nick game, Channel 15, E, behind the music, no behind the music 30, VH1, MTV, 29, E, 35. MTV has been 29 for as long as I can remember. Oh, now it's 50, Anthony. Yeah, I believe. Right. Comedy Central, it was 45 forever. Cartoon Network, 46. I go to the Cartoon Network. Now it's like the Discovery Channel. Yeah. A mess. Fat Guy's on the line. All right. All right. Fat Guy. Hello, boy. How are you? Hello, Billy. Well, thank you for playing our song. I was very kind of you. Okay, now listen. Now listen. Is there something else going on that I should know about? Now you don't have to say your piece but we just figured we'd get the real story from because Paul was being polite and Billy doesn't care to say anything. He don't really care. Oh, mama. How do you like? Oh, what? I'm sorry. Oh, man. By the way, I know I've only written one or two songs in my life but Mike Dina Coli, now that's a real lyricist. We can write one freaking FBA tune but he's a real lyricist. You know, I kiss my freaking fat ass. How much are we going to blow our own freaking horns on the radio, guys? If you can bend down, don't give me this crap. You guys are so funny. Hey, Billy. What? Tell me what. Tell you what. No, I'm sorry. Like Paul said, I hope you're shooting your voice. Oh, a whole week of J-more. That was sarcasm. Oh, yeah. Dude, it is our show. We have on who we want. You know what, guys? No, that's correct. It is. It is your show. It's just like when you guys come in, you know, you guys come in because we want you here. If they want J-more in, we would tell them so. Hey, look. Okay, no problem. And all the people associated with the show, they don't have to get along with each other, but we just know there's tension between the J-more. Look, the guy doesn't even know I exist, so it's not even fair. Okay. But why do you guys dislike him so? Well, would you rather do this now or do you want to do it like maybe next week when he's there? Oh, wow. Was it something that happened? It's just we don't... I can't say wait. Let me speak for myself. Okay. You know, not only do we guys have the relationship on the air, but off the air we appreciate everything you do and we like you guys. Yeah, sure. And I just don't personally appreciate some of the crap that goes on and maybe you guys don't say nothing about it or aren't aware of it, but you know, it's a lot of BS. Why? A lot of stuff going on in the air and off the air. It's like, you know, let's show everyone how wonderful I am in Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. Rascals Monday. I'm in town. Let me go to Bobbie and Auntie and sell out a room. He's called just to hang with us two. Look guys, no problem. I don't know the guy personally. I wouldn't know if I tripped over one of his bad movies. But you guys really don't like him. I mean, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. I don't know the guy personally. I wouldn't know if I tripped over one of his bad movies. But you guys really don't like him. Yeah, because I think on the other hand, regardless of how many times he does plug the shows he's doing, he has given us some really good radio. Hey guys, no problem. Look, look, look. I'm just saying from my personal standpoint. All right, I'm just taking his side because he's not here. That's all. I personally would love to see a fight club between you and Jake. I wish one of his little minions would call up and get him on the phone. Little boys that are probably hanging around him somewhere. See, because I don't get that. I can understand what you're saying because you're looking in on it and you see what was going on and how you interpreted it or how it really is. Whatever. I'm just saying, but why does that get you so angry about him? Yeah, because we support you guys and we promote you guys as much as we can, right? Of course. I have no problem with you guys. It's almost like... Okay, not a big problem. No. I don't know. It just seems like... Wow. Yeah, this is fun. This is great. Well, we'll have them on next week. Just ask Stephen Lynch the next time he goes into a hotel room who's bent over with their big brown spot looking at him. Oh yeah, that's normal behavior. When somebody comes in and I only met in a radio room, I'll sit there and show Mike. I'll pout a hole to him. Well you're referring to the time Stephen Lynch went to Jay's hotel room in Boston and Jay opened the door... well, Stephen Lynch opened the door and had a look at Jay's brown eye. On all fours, Brendan and Jay. I thought all guys did that when they first met. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure Anthony did that when you first went up to Boston. But why does that bother you? It doesn't bother me. It's just very strange behavior, don't you think? Yeah, but it makes for good radio. Okay. You know, you guys... Strange behavior? Now you're making me sound like a little... like the guilted boyfriend here for Christ's sake. I'll just take in the other side, that's all. Okay. I just wanted to know if there was an issue that we didn't know about. Yeah. Well there might be. There is. What is it? I think I'd rather do it face to face. I'll have Rick pull some tape on certain things and we'll bring our little weapons. Wow. And like I said, it's not fair that Jay's not here. Alright. Let him sell out rascals and then we'll talk on Tuesday. You know, I'm sure everything will be wonderful and it'll be God's gift or whatever. Okay. And I think it'll be fun. Let's set a date and let's have a little love fest. So you definitely have an issue, you definitely have some ammunition and you want to take on Jay face to face or on the phone or whatever? No, whatever. I think it would be better that way. It's only fair. Like you said, it's not fair that he's not here to defend himself. Okay. You know, he can call, get Buddy Hacker on the phone. Alright. What's wrong with that? Now I'm just throwing crap at you guys. Now you're pissing me off. Oh stop it. Buddy Hacker's giving us some fun right now. Buddy Hacker is a legend. I have nothing, no problem with Buddy Hacker. Don't even start that. Alright. Buddy Hacker was a pisser with you guys. Okay. But now I'm sitting there going like, oh look at Fanker, he's a little crying little bitch. No, the listener's honest. No, Fanker, I will be honest with you. We try to be honest as much as we can on the show here. Okay. Kevin, Joe, I agree with Fat Guy. Dave, Line 9, I am with Billy, no more J. Moore. Line 1, Will wants to defend J. Okay. You know what it is, guys? Another guy's picking up for J. So it's like 50-50 right now as far as just looking at the phones. Hey look guys, you know how we feel about you personally, professionally. And it's just like- I just knew there was a problem last time you guys were here and we had J on the phone. It was so uncomfortable and I was pissed at myself that I didn't bring it up while J was on the phone because you guys were just staring right through me. Oh, I didn't even realize. And you guys both had your arms folded like, you know, oh, we have to deal with this guy again. At that point it wasn't the O.B. and Anthony show anymore, it was the J. Moore show and we wouldn't know if we were guests. Well, we allow people to take a little control of the show from time to time. You know, it's not easy to do five hours of talk every day so when we get someone like J or you guys coming in or Steve Lynch, it's kind of a pleasure to rest a little bit and let you guys shine a little bit. I think it will be very interesting. I think like Paul said before, there are two faces to a lot of people. Would you like to take on a few of the J supporters? I would love to talk to them, sure. Really? Okay, hold on. Let's go to Will. Hey, Will. Hey, what's up? You're on with Fat Guy and you want to defend J. Moore. Yeah, J. Moore is gone, okay? So, you know what? So forget, you know, he does the gay thing, so what? You know, forget about it, you know? But he got two cousins to kiss. He's got many lesbians on that couch and what has Billy from Air Sticks done? He's taken a crunch in a freaking toilet and that's about it. That was pretty funny too though, man. I got to... You're just talking about me against J. I got to stick up for Fat Guy. When he took a crunch on Spaz's paycheck, that was very funny. What's your name, dude? Will. Well, you know, you're making it like who's done more for the show and that's not what it comes down to. You know, what it comes down to is like we respect Opie and Anthony. We respect what they do, what we do for them, what they do for us. It's like, you know, and he's like, yeah, you guys can think he's funny. We have no problem with that. He probably is very funny. But like before you're like... You don't even want to admit it, huh, Billy? He's come up with some funny stuff. I have never seen his act. His act is really good. Yeah, I'm sure the guys who we got it from are a little hot that we haven't had before. Oh, okay. All right, now we're getting to the issue. Jeff from River Edge, New Jersey. J. Moore is a spotlight hog. He really does monopolize air time. The incessant kissing ass of Buddy Hackett is annoying. I agree with Fat Guy. Wow. That's the one coming in. Rock from Woodside sounds like someone is jealous that his spotlight is threatened. All right, I guess that's coming in for against you. I guess I would use J. Moore plug. Yes. It's right down the middle though, Billy. That's cool. Let's see. Fat Guy's right. For one thing, J. steps on Ant's voices all the time. Okay, J. Moore rules. That guy is just jealous. I mean, it's totally down the middle. Well, then this sounds like fun, doesn't it? It could be a good time. You know what it's like. Jeff from River Edge, New Jersey. J. Moore should visit Camp Concentration. Oh my God. But then the next one says J. is the man. I really like when J. comes in the studio. Just don't have him in every day for a week. Fat Guy is the man too. But with the most important email, Joe from North Arlington, Spaz is a retard. We've got to keep focused here. All right, hold on. I want to get you on with Jeff who wants to defend J. Okay. Let's go with Jeff. Jeff, what's going on? Hey, what's up, guys? Hey. The way I see it, I think there's a lot of shell space to go around. And it's almost like Fat Boy. You're kind of being like the jealous girlfriend almost. No, I'm coming across as the bitch who got left out and didn't go to the prom. That's what it seems like. I mean, J. is hilarious, man. There have been shows where he's made the show almost. I mean, I was kind of on hold there for a second here and all those instant feedbacks. A lot of them make sense. Let me ask you a question. We're hoping it'd be funny before J. showed up. Hell yeah. Oh, okay. But hey, he adds to the show. I'm not saying he makes the show. I think your stuff is funny too. We have no problem letting other people shine in the show, which is very different than other high-profile shows in this town. I don't know. You know what? Maybe there's more to it that we don't get on the outside here. But you know, you call him and you kind of sound like angry about something that we're not seeing. J. is funny. He's like that out of control guy that like just let him do his thing and it's worthwhile. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. So Billy, will you be representing Billy and Paul? I can't speak for Paul, but if the invitations are right, I know for a fact Paul had an issue or two that might want to be brought up. Yeah, I could feel that on the phone today. And I know for a fact that Paul actually has people to back up some of his things and they might be calling in. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we need to hear some issues. Yeah, you promise, Fat Guy, you'll let it out and we'll get right down to what's important. Well, you know, that would be a little different for me. I'm not using it very openly in my how I feel. Okay. Billy, a lot of people saying that you have some kind of a gay love thing for J. It sounds to me like Fat Guy wanted to hob J's knob, but J said no from Larry and Yonkers. Well, I understand that would never happen. I don't think J would ever say no. Oh! Wow! Okay. Okay! Oh yeah, but that's different from him chasing Haley Joe Osment around the hotel room, right? Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Now, you let me know, when is Rick getting back? Monday. No, Tuesday. Tuesday, okay, cool. Hey, Fat Boy, one other thing, you know. Fat Guy, by the way. Fat Guy. One other thing, man, I think if you're going to take J on, you've got to polish it a little bit because he's quick and witty, you know what I mean? Oh, yeah. Oh, of course. So what should I do? Should I go into like rocky training over there? No, I mean, you said you're going to pull out some weapons, you've got some ideas. I bring some strong ideas, you know what I mean? Okay. They could make for some interesting radio next week. I'm looking forward to it. All right, Jeff, thank you. You know, I think, you know, something like this would be better done in person, boys. Hey! So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. Oh, okay. So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. Oh, okay. So you want to be in studio? Yeah, sure. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, you know me, I certainly don't have a problem with it. That guy, I do bow to you, you have balls. It seems like something like this that would be easier to do on the phone. That would be the easy way out, wouldn't it? You want to be face to face. Yeah, as of whether Jay wants you, that's another story. Like I said, he doesn't even know who the, he probably doesn't even know who he knows, Paul, they work together and stuff. Yeah. But from what the hell I know, I'm just a fleck on his ass, you know. All right. He probably doesn't know me from the hole in the wall, so he probably won't even know where the hell it's coming from. All right, we'll see if we can set this up for like two days. My only thing with you, with him, comes from our relationship and his relationship with how it deals with you. Okay. And I mean, other than other things I have heard, some things that I know from the comedy community. We have no problem. I know you guys, you guys don't back away from conflict, are you kidding me? No, but we have no problem with Jay, you know. No, not at all. Or we would have said something a long time ago. No, it's the truth. Okay. All right. I just wonder if you had your nuts today, that's all. What are you talking about? Are you going to bring your balls next week or what? Oh my God. That guy, what are you getting at? No, I'm teasing with you. No, but what are you getting at? No, I don't know. You know, if there's something you wanted to be free, would you, if you had a problem with somebody, would you actually come out and say it? I believe I have in the past, sure. Oh, okay. As I sit here, I don't have a problem with Jay Moore. Okay. I don't have a problem when he, you know, takes over the show a little bit here and there. I have no problem with it. Oh, that's cool. All right. Now I am really feeling like a dick, no? No, you're not, because it's right down the middle. It'll be interesting, but I'm serious. I have no problem with it. Oh, cool. Anyway, this should make, it'll make for definitely for some interesting afternoon gossip. And I have no problem with you either, so. Oh, of course. I'm so lovable. Do we sue from Jersey? Checking in real quick. I'll tell Billy to go get another pipe. Who opened for Jay during his stint at Rascals? Wasn't it Paul? Yeah. Oh, well. And Paul did very, very, very well. Yeah. I'm kind of pissed that I didn't see his whole set. So. What does that have to do with anything? I don't know. That's just Sue speaking her piece. A lot of people like Paul. Yeah, I mean, it's not a question of, you know, look, you know, a lot of, you know, who likes Sue and who likes what, you know, comedy is as diverse as anything. Right. Right. And some people like others, some people won't, you know. And I think what Paul was hearing earlier was me just throwing around some sarcasm. Oh, OK. Because, I mean, the show does get a little gayer when Jay's here. So I was like, oh, boy, you know, can't wait to get back into the gay zone. You know, I'm just throwing the sarcasm around. Well, you did exercise the demons there for a while. No, but when it comes right down, I definitely enjoy when Jay's on the show. OK, cool. All right. It's a pleasure. And I look forward to next week. This could be great. Oh, yeah. I'll have to go into the studio now. All right, Billy. Bye, guys. Have a great weekend. Later, man. Bye. There he goes. Interesting. All right. Well, let's get ready to rumble. It'll be interesting. Hey, Joe, what's going on? Hey, dude. How are you, Joe? Show rules, man. Hey, man. Hey, Ants, you know, being an Italian guy from Brooklyn like me, you wouldn't know anything about this, of course, but when they change the channel, they call it that silver bullet thing. Yeah. And they do that to zap the boxes that people have that get all the premium channels without paying for them. We know the bullet. But of course, we don't know anything about that. I don't think that's what they're doing, though. That's exactly what they're doing. And they do it regularly. And that's the reason. All right. Thank you, Joe. Hey, one more thing. The fans. OK, terrific. Hope you got demoted and you answered the phone. Ants, you know. Nice, Ant. Thank you. All right, Joe. OK, dude. We got to get back to the game here. Thank you. All right. Bye. Game point. Oh, petered out over the net. That was interesting, though. I knew there was a little tension there, and it's nice that it'll all come out in the wash next week. Should be good. Oh, yeah. All right. We got to take a break, Anthony. Oh, yeah. We'll regroup. More of your phone calls in just a bit. We're moving on from the J-More fat guy issue. We'll let those guys, you know, deal with that next week. OK? Hash it out. Anything else, give us a call. 212-757-1027. Oby and Anthony. Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?

Come in. Okay, come in. Virgin. Come in. I hope someone else finds that stuff funny. I love Scott so much. Let's go to Ron. Ron, you're next on WNAW. How are you? Hey, what's up, dude? How's it going? Good. I don't know if you got my story. No. I'm not too sure. This is totally off the topic. But, um, I had just gotten a recent bill in the mail. Only because I apparently have a problem with talking on the phone to the girls who like to charge me for it. And... Wait, it says here you got a $15,000 phone sex bill? Uh, yeah. It was over three credit cards. Whoa! Why are you calling the phone sex numbers? Oh, who the hell? Well, you know what? I just got divorced. You know, and you know what? I moved into an apartment. Everything was great. Everything was nice. Ron, let me stop you. Do you realize what you could get for $15,000 if you just got divorced? Well, I don't know. Maybe I could take some of that Anthony Stocktab or something to make some money off of. Not today. Did you spend $15,000 or somebody else, like, rooked your cards? Uh, no. No, I actually went through every single bit of it. You, yourself? Yeah, I did it in four months. I don't get the phone sex lines. You know, I just sit on there and I talk and I... I hear all those party lines are all gay guys, though. No, they're not really gay guys. I'm not gay. I'm serious. Hello. Ding dong, ding dong. Hello. Hello. Ding dong. Hello. And anyone else in here? Hello? Remember that time with the scanner? Hello, this... Hello, Ron, you there? Ding! I had this scanner and you could pick up all kinds of fun stuff on it. Illegally. Like, you know, whatever. And occasionally, inadvertently, I might pick up a cell phone call, you know? Oops, oops. And you hear something. And then you could hear, um, you hear this guy talking to one of these phone sex things. It's like a room that a bunch of guys get in and there's a... I guess you push a key on your phone and it goes, ding dong. Yeah. To tell all the people that you're there. All the people that you're there. In all fairness, we didn't know it was a gay sex. Yeah, yeah. It could have been, you know, one of these party rooms that were supposed to have girls in it. Yeah, yeah. But it was all guys. And I happened to hear some girls in there. It was gay. Oh dear. All you heard was, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong. Hello, hello, ding dong. Hello, hello. So that's how you chalked up 15 grand? Yeah, yeah. I did that for four months, dude. I can't... And it's not like, you know, I had my pants around my ankles, you know, singing, you know, Judy Garland's phone's doing this. You know, I just, um, you know, it just happened. That's how it is. So I need 15 grand. Well, good luck. Good luck to you. Good luck. So you're not going to help me? Well, Joe said he'll help you on line one. Joe, what's going on? You're on with Ron. Oh, Ron? Yeah? What the hell's wrong with you, man? Dude, I don't know. 15 grand? Yeah, 15 grand. You are a loser, bro. No, it's $14,875. Oh boy, let's just cut it short a little. What the hell's wrong with you? I don't know. I guess I'm somewhat retarded. Joe, have you ever called the phone sex line? No. No. I went to movie. It's a lot cheaper. Dude, it's not like phone sex. It's like you get on a line with a bunch of people. You gotta pay 15 grand to get a friend, man. You got a lot more problems than being divorced. Did any of these girls get you off in the party room there, Ron? No, no. Oh, what a waste. Dude, dude, go rent the whore. You can get a whore a lot cheaper. All right, Joe. All right. Thank you. Later. All right. Well, sorry, Ron. So you're not going to give me 15 grand? Yeah. Yeah, let me just pull it out of my butt. Wait a second. Kat, what's going on? Oh, nothing, man. I'm just going to tell you that this guy's a total loser. 15 grand? You can get anything from starting on the computer. What's wrong with him? Never had a computer. Never had a computer? You could have bought a few of them. You could have bought a kick-ass computer for 15 grand. That's what it is. I probably should have bought my wife back for 15 grand. You know, you get on the phone with the company or whatever it is, and you just tell them it wasn't you. You say there was somebody else, and then they put a block on your phone for those calls, and you're not liable for the money. Okay. All right. Wait. You told me to lie. Well, there's one more guy that wants to talk to you. TJ? Yeah, how you doing, guys? You work for an escort agency? Yes, I do. All right. You got some advice for Ron? Yeah. You know what, Ron? This is ridiculous. 15 grand, you didn't get anything out of it. You know, for 150 bucks, I could deliver a fine-looking broad. In all honesty, I did get some of it. I did get something out of this. I'm not believing Ron's story, to tell you the truth. Oh, my God. I mean... I think Ron is faking this. Ron, hang up the phone and shoot yourself. Shoot myself? Yes, you should shoot yourself. I don't have a gun. All right. I got a rubber band. All right, TJ. Take care, guys. Thank you. Immigration now. Ron, I'm going to cut you off before you say a babble-boo here. I'm not believing Ron's story. What do you mean, no? No. All right. Let's go to Chris. Chris, you're next on N.E.W. What's up? What's up, guys? How are you? Hey, what's this joker's name? Ron. Ron, you're not alone, my friend. I mean, not that I charged him 15 grand. I tell you, it used to be nice. I used to go away on company business trips, right? Yeah. And, you know, the bill all gets expensed. And, you know, he's sliding up the phone calls on. You're all set. So you've done the phone sex too while you were away? Oh, all the time. We used to call it from the job trailers, like the Supers trailer outside the job sites. When he wasn't in there, you'd pick up his phone and dial like sex lines. Really? It's pretty funny. But I'd like nothing that would ever come of it. I would talk, be on the phone and be like, hey, what's up? Hi. All right. What are you going to do for me? I got like five minutes here. Well, what are you into? What do you like? What are your hobbies? I'm like, hobbies? Start talking about knob-harbin' or something. Time is money here. But nothing ever came of it. And then, you know, an electrician would grab the phone, give me some. Like a phone whore. Can you ask you to describe yourself at the beginning? Just try to drag it out. Well, they want to make as much money as possible. Sure. So, okay, Chris, thank you. Yeah. Hey, brother, you're not alone. All right. Brother being Ron there. Ron. Hey, Joe, what's going on? You're next on WNAW. Joe? Hello. Hey. What's up, Joe? Hey, what's up, guys? What's up, Joe? You guys are the coolest, man. WNAW on Channel 7. On Channel 7? Channel 7 is all WNAW. This sounds like a phony tune. Yeah. And, hey, you guys got to play more of that Spaz Radio. That's the funniest crap I've ever heard. Spaz Radio rocks. Well, Spaz Radio. Spaz Radio rocks, especially that rerun of today when he walked out. The Spaz Radio will be back Friday. He's doing his Week in Review. The Spaz Week in Review Friday on the Radio Show. All right. One more thing. Here it comes.

What? It takes on a whole new life. I'm a baby raper. This is horrible, man. What? That's so sweet. I thought we were all just having fun. This is the radio show, right? Oh, come on. I'm a baby raper. We're going to get this show I'm a baby raper, I'm a baby raper, so sweet and young, good enough to eat. Danny! What's up? What's up Danny? Now you're coming there and just reel you in the head? That's so wrong! He is the worst. Come on. Oh my god. Oh you hung up on him. What? No I didn't. No I didn't. You have got to be the most disturbed individual. Mike what's up? This piece of tape naked number one. Alright Mike thank you. God damn. What? That is just wrong man. So hi Danny. Yeah it's good to see you too man. It's good to see you. Okay terrific. God damn. Okay horrific. You are awful. They come in here with the newborn. They want to share with us. And you play that song. I didn't play nothing. Yeah sure. Alright it's good to see you guys too. Here's a gift for you to torture. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Each time I see a little girl, eight and nine or ten, I can't resist the urge to stick my toes inside her damn hippie bones. I'm all in it. For little girls, for little girls who have hairless little p***s. Come on man. What? You are so freaking wrong. Dennis from Brooklyn. Satan is coming for you Opie. John from Queens, Opie you are the Antichrist. What's the name of the newborn? Patrick Aaron. Yeah what's the... I don't even know is it a girl or a boy? It's a boy. Patrick Aaron. Okay. Jeez man. You have a problem. What? You have issues. What? Hi James what's up? Nothing much guys. Okay. That was perfect timing man. Okay. Perfect timing. And get Jordy to play good cop man. Oh my god. Look at the kids talking and stuff. How are you doing? Jesus Christ. For little girls, I want to bite them and I make them lick my b***s. They little nips. Hi guys how are you? It's a... I'm going to give you a thousand torture but you won't even... Well get on the mic. It was nice that you guys stopped by before your vacation. You got to get on the mic. No one can hear you Celeste. Yeah get on the mic. Steve what's up? Opie you are going to hell. What? It's Rosie. Hello? Yeah. You're going to hell man. Why? That is the sickest stuff I have ever heard in my life. I almost threw up in the car. Well I'm... I don't know. You know what? I've lost all respect for you man after doing that. I thought you were really cool and funny. Now I think you're really sick in the head. I don't know who started that song. I know who it was. It was you man. No it wasn't. It was you. Uh oh. What? I think the kids are going to start crying. Jesus. Oh no. Oh no. Oh. That's great. You are so bad. How could you look at those kids and... Oh man. You are so bad. I didn't do nothing man. I was always wondering who was worse. Hitler or Opie? Well it's clear now. Opie. I did nothing. Ellen what's up? Yo what's up man? Hey Ellen. This is Alan. Alan what's up? Yo Opie you got a lot of balls man. That song, I'm giving it a vote. It came in perfect timing. Alright thank you Alan. No wonder they wrote Ellen. Alan is about 10. Okay so we have Celeste and Dan in the studio. So very good. I see everything went well. You have a healthy cute little baby right there. When was you born? January 1st. January 1st. How over did it? Way over. A few weeks. A few weeks. Well we remember because we were trying to induce that labor before Christmas. Anthony Roman Polanski. Roman Polanski checking in. Yeah Roman Polanski checking in and I'm the one who had to leave the country. Before you guys hang me, there's no way the little ones were able to hear that song. Oh really? And? Why? At least stick up for me with that. I'm not sticking up for you or anything. You are so bad man. There was no way they could hear it right? Dan? That's true. Thank you. Opie is heartless. We stopped by to thank you guys for your hospitality all this time and I hope we get syndicated because we're going to be living in South Florida now. Oh when you're moving? When you're moving. Saturday. Really? That quick? I thought you guys were just going on vacation. I didn't know you were leaving us. I'm afraid so. What are you doing down there? Yeah what are you going to do down there? Computer technician. Really? Yeah. Meaning you're going to be running the website? Pretty much anybody from Dell or Compaq or anybody that has problems. They call people and I'm going to be one of those people. Are you hanging up your career as a nude magazine? As a nude pregnant model? Kind of put it on hold. The milk production wasn't all there so I couldn't do nothing with that. Let me stick up for myself. These two are sick apps themselves. Come on. They're obviously good parents. I could see that just looking at them but they are sick apps when the kids aren't around. There's a lot of coal for it out there. Celeste has some pictures on her website that will just... Verge it. I don't think so. People want to hang you up. I had nothing to do with that. Yeah. You guys are leaving Saturday. That's great. When's the syndication start? I want to be able to hear you down there without having to call and be on hold. Good question. You'll have to keep track through the website for a while. Somebody emailing in, Opie, Opie, Opie, hang them from a tree. Is it Miami or... Actually Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale. Very nice town. Yeah, there you go. You won't have to listen to horrible songs that Opie's playing in front of your children. I'm going to miss not listening to you guys every afternoon. Well, hopefully we'll be syndicated. I thought it was the Black Crow CD in the CD player. Dave, what's going on? Dude, that was worse than when you pulled that old lady that her friend was dead. Oh man, you're the devil. Thank you. Let's go to Anthony on line 5. Hope, you know you're going to do it. What? You might as well do it. Give him the send-off song. You know you're going to do it. No, no, no, no, no. I think we ran out of songs. Come on, Hope. You know you're going to do it. I don't have any more. Send something for them. Give them a send-off gift. You know he's going to do it. Yeah, I know. I have nothing left. You know who? Oh, the phone! Okay, it's a ribbon. You can't say that. You can't say that. Alright, man. I'll see you tomorrow. Alright, bye. Bye, boy. They could have turned the song off. Don't even give people that. They know what this studio looks like. They've seen it in pictures. The board is across the whole console for me. I'm so far away from you. It's almost as big as your desk in the office. How am I supposed to crawl over it? Patty from Babylon, what did we learn on the show today? Surprisingly, Anthony is the sensitive one. What happened? Where's the kid? He's running around the studio. See, if you were a real man, you'd show the kid how the board works and make him hit the button. No, no, no, no. Joe, what's going on? Nothing. You do absolutely nothing at all. I mean, it sounds perfectly normal to me. The only thing I worry about is you play baby raping with a little baby boy. That scares me. That scares me. Now, the fact is the kids didn't hear the songs. I believe you 100%. That was just for the entertainment of our fans at home. We believe you. Thank you, Joe. Let's go to Kathy. Kathy, you're next on NAW. Hi. Hi. I guess it's a good thing that Robin Feliciano Black. Wow, Kathy. That's funny. Thank you. Uh-oh. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Oh, yeah. Let's go to Scott. Scott, you're next on NAW. Scott. Hello. Hi. What's up? Yeah. Oh, that was bad. Yeah. That was no good. Yeah, you got it. You have little kids crying in the background. That's no good. Wait. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. The crying was on tape. Yeah, but then after the tape stopped, you know, you hear the kids in the background. All right, Scott. You guys are going to be playing radio in Iraq. You got to stop. All right. Thank you. Take care. You boys can't be doing it. All right. Oh, he's going back behind there again. He's going to pull out all the plugs. All right. So this is the G portion of our radio show. So we'll get the kids out. We'll get back to the R person. Yeah. Yeah. So let's see. How are you doing? I'm just trying to get in there. How's the belly? How's the belly? It's better. Let's see. Oh, yeah. Can we see your stuff? Oh, Jesus. Wow. You're good. Yeah. She'll show us. Now, how long is the cake for? Nine for the kid? Get rid of the belly. It is. Oh, my. Oh, no. All right. This is so long. She just whipped them out. Okay. And I'm the sick one. She just whipped them out. Whip them out Wednesday. But your kid is right over there. Oh, my God. All right. Listen. Listen, this is wrong. There are so many levels. It's not like they haven't seen them before. Okay. We got to take a break. Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay. Coming. Virgin. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, guys, thanks for stopping by. Yeah, thanks, man. And best of luck in Florida. Thank you, guys. Best of luck with the syndication there. Hopefully. Send us an email every once in a while. We like to keep track of the listeners that move out of the area. Hope you like the doll. Yeah, yeah. She gave us the Rosie O'Donnell doll. We hate her as much as about everyone else in the world. If you could torture it on your next road show maybe, that'd be nice. Okay. Dreams come true with Rosie. What a cutie patootie. Come on, give me a kiss. It was an unwelcome gift. Let's put it that way. Rock on, blue one. Dreams come true with Rosie. All right, so let's say goodbye to Dan and Sylvia. Yeah, we'll torture this appropriately. Thanks. Rebecca. Yeah. Hi, what's up? Hey, just curious if you were going to tell the kids that there's no Santa Claus now. Sorry, already been done. Hope you already did that. I didn't. On a previous show up in Boston. I never did that. Much to the horror of many parents listening. I never did that. No, not him. All right, thank you, Rebecca. All right. Bye. Bye. Yeah, so many emails coming in. Not many in favor of you right now, I'll think. I had nothing to do with it all. You had everything to do. I did not. All right, let's take a break. Yeah. We'll take a break and we'll be back. We want to thank Dan and Sylvia for stopping by and we wish them luck in South Florida. Talk to you soon. Thank you. All right. Hey, I'm John Stewart and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027WAW. These guys have problems, but you know that. We're gay? Yes. I don't know. We just had a dump out. Is John in? He's not there. We just had a dump out? Yes. What almost got through? F. Oh, F-word. All right, let's start over. I'm sorry. Anthony Pizzano of Mulberry Street and the Heart of Little Italy. Yes. Dreams come true. Rosie. Rosie's dreaming of going to Pizzano and loading up on the wonderful pasta and great huge portions. What a cutie patootie. Yes. She says that veal chop is a cutie patootie. Come on, give me a kiss. Yeah, she just sucked in a whole plate of pasta right there from Pizzano. And she wanted to kiss Pete for bringing it over to her. Yeah, Pete ran away. We love Pizzano. We're down there all the time. It's a great place to take a date, the family, like I said, huge portions and really good food, you know. Reasonable prices, too. I was surprised when I finally looked at the menu and saw the prices, that you could get a huge meal and it's not that expensive at all. And you ask Joey, you say, hey, Joey, let me see the picture of Opie and Anthony. Did he get the new one up there yet? I'm not sure. Oh. I haven't been there in a few weeks. So it'll be a swamp with one? Probably. Well, you just say Opie and Anthony saying you get a free glass of wine. Dreams come true. That's right. That's right, Rosie. You're an Irish bitch. You probably get drunk all the time on the wine and stuff, right? Come on, give me a kiss. Allegedly. Oh, damn, who cares? I want to shoot this doll. Already? It's annoying as hell. It's a cutie patootie. Okay. Rock on, little ones. Oh. Dreams come true. Wait, Ann, Ann. What? I'm slamming her big fat head against the console. All right, Ann, it's Paisano, Maburge. Yeah, yeah, yes, Joey, the owner. Mo asked, does the kid want to talk? He's going to do an ad for Paisano. You want to talk about Paisano, little one? No, he's just playing. Oh, he turned the mic around. All right. If you see Joey, just tell him Opie and Anthony sent you and Joey. No, come on, come on. What? Wait, what did he say? He wants to talk into the wrong end. Yeah, talk into that. Come on, come on. It's some kind of a secret language. What is he trying to say? You still don't know? He's saying Opie is the sickest SOP I've ever seen in my life. All right, ask for Joey, tell him, hey, Joey, Opie and Anthony sent me to your fine restaurant here, Paisano, and he'll give you a glass of wine on the house, okay? It's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart. Come on, give me a kiss. Of little Italy. Give them a call. 965-1188. That's 965-1188. Opie and Anthony. There's no level 2 over. That's what I'm saying, too. Oh, stop. 1027W and EW. All right, Anthony, we only have a few more minutes left here. For today, anyway. 2127571027, I believe we can play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today. Certainly can. Let's go right to the fellowship and get a few of these people on. We haven't played this in a while. Joe, what's going on? Hey, guys, it's Joseph Rano. What's up? What's up? I had a boat with you guys at the bat on past day. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Today I learned that you guys have revived Scott Muni's career. Yes. Hold on. I also learned this week that a trick-settings pool free number is easier, remember, than any W's. All right. Well, thank you, Joe. It's indicated eventually a long-lived king gift. All right. Okay. Just got some. All right, let's go to Bob. Bob, you're next on any W. What's up, guys? How are you, Bob? Pretty good. Pretty good. I learned over the last couple days that there's a new radio station in town. It's going to be W-O-N-A. Yeah. Hell, yeah. Listen, guys, when is my birthday? Anybody want to hang out with Psycho Mark? We gave all the med tickets away. If you call tomorrow, we might have some more. You the man. We just got to see how many we got. Thanks a lot, guys. All right, man. Have a good one. Thank you.

And there was no need to do it, but on the other hand, it was kind of funny. All right. Thank you, Vinny. All right. Take it in the rear, guys. All right. Thank you. Take it in the rear, guys. Yeah, that's the take it in the rear. Hey, Frank. What's going on? Hey, what's up, guys? How are you? Hey, guys. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something.

I learned that pregnant chicks can't give birth in radio studios. I drew a blank. You guys put me on here so quick I'm blank now. That's right. Nice one. I'm getting a shot. I'm getting a shot. Yeah, we have a joke. Oh, I learned one more thing. Diamond dust does douse. All right. Thank you. Wow. You know, remember the old rules? We used to give up after the bad call. Yeah. Let's go, Dan. Hey, I learned that Anthony's Jesus compared to Opie. Yeah. Hold the phone. I got to agree with him. Dan was talking about doing 15-year-olds the first break of the show today. Did we all forget? I did not. Did I? 15 is a little bit different than two. I didn't say I was doing two-year-olds. It appears that you didn't want to. No, it did not appear that way. Did I say anything? Let's try to remember what Ant was doing in the beginning of the show today. What? About fouling 15-year-olds and stuff. No, I was talking about that singer, the one that looks like Britney's creative and all the rest of them. That happens to be 15. Solved. Thank you, Dan. Okay, see you. All right. What's her name? Mandy Moore. Alex, what's up? Yeah. I learned that Lester Shalom must have taken too many punches to the head. Yeah, that was pretty good today. Alex, thank you. Thank you. No problem. All right, let's go to Steve. No problem. Steve, you're next on NAW. What's up, guys? I learned on the show today Ant wants to do a 15-year-old. There you go. Come on. Let's not forget. All right, take it hard and heavy in the middle, guys. You ass. Okay, terrific. The phones are just brutal. Yeah, they are. Absolutely brutal. Let's just see what Anthony has. Anthony, what's up? Actually, it's Chris, but I knew he put me through it. I said my name was Anthony. All right. I learned that the Mets are going to lose the World Series and that Britney's going to be wearing a hockey helmet. Oh, yeah. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Oh, yeah, well, okay. And that Britney needs a hockey helmet. Did you have a light fall on her, Opie? I didn't remember it. Thank you, Anthony. Jeez. Peace out. All right. Holy fuck. Goddamn. This is going nowhere. This is so painful. Oh, my God, Maverick, punch out. This is so painful. Where's my black Pro CD? Why the hell did you guys need my black Pro CD and Jay Moore? We can use it right now. Oh my goodness. I can't help but say I can't believe this. We're in radio hell right now. We've got to stall for five more minutes and we have nothing. We have absolutely nothing. We always play. What did we learn today on the show? Today it was just a disaster. What is wrong with you people? I don't know but they're like on some kind of dope. Vince, what's up? Hey, I learned that Anthony's motto is old enough to bleed, old enough to butcher. See, and they're not changing at all. Wait, I don't even get that one. I know. Did it have something to do with today's show? Yeah, these little girls. Let them bleed, butcher them. Oh my God. What? Or do you give them the curb test? Put them on the curb and if their feet touch the road, if they're old enough. Gallimbein's done. Hey Joe. Yeah. Help us out. What did you learn on the show today? What did I learn on the show today? That Opie is the only person in New York City with a god damn sense of humor. All right, I can accept that. Not only you guys, Anthony, you know you're just playing good cop. You guys had this thing all set up. I think it was beautiful though. Opie, keep it up. You're the best. Wow, I finally got a compliment. Yeah, you deserve a compliment. It only took almost two years, but thanks. Absolutely, Opie, you rule. And syndication yesterday, you guys suck. Thanks, Joe. Bye. All right, Ant. Maybe we can play some extra commercials or something. Please come true with Rosie. I can't play that again. They already want to kill me. All right, Ant, stall for a minute. I'll find something. Okay. What a cutie patootie. Okay. Rosie and Scott. Rosie, Scott's doing an interview with Rosie. All right, you guys. Virgil. Rock on, blue one. Yeah, Rock. Virgil. Come on, give me a kiss. Yeah. Rock on. What a mess. Wow. You know what that was like? That was like, you know, you just, you know, you just, you know, you just, you know, you just, you know, you just, you know, you just, you know, you just, you know, you just, you you go to vacation, right? You're driving and you're driving home from vacation. You drove a real long time and you're getting a car wreck right outside your driveway. We were almost there. Yeah, because Chris from Jersey writes, I learned that the show came to a complete Screeching stop today, but thank God it came to a complete stop at six forty instead of like four five. Right. We hate ending this way so we have to think about it all night like the last 20 minutes 20 minutes? No, it was like the last 10 minutes. Yeah, it was just what did we learn? Yeah. That was it. We might have to give up on the what did we learn segment of the Opie and Anthony show. I don't know, it might be. We might have run out of steam on that little segment. What did we learn today? Whoa! Yeah. I mean, there's so many good ones to choose from today. Sometimes they just don't pan out. All right. We still had fun today, right? Oh, yeah. Okay. This little kid is running around like crazy out there. Why? I don't know. He's like... Shut up, the Rosie job. I just threw it. Opie is a... Opie is Satan. There you go. Okay, great. All right, guys, we've got a bail. Yeah, punch out. Punch out, Maverick. We'll punch you now. We'll leave you with our pal Red Peters. We'll leave you. We haven't played him in a little while, Anthony, okay? All right, Opie. And we'll be back stronger than ever tomorrow. Yes. Starting at two. Yeah, man. All right. Thanks for listening. It's N.A.W.
