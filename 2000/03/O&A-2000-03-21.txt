 You can call the soul up, you treat them like good people, you don't talk down to them. Hey, f*** you! Jesus Christ, shut up! You idiot! You're such a loser! Hey, f*** you! What a retard! You're high! Are you stupid? Hey, f*** you! The Opie and Anthony Show! 1027 WNEW Hey, what's happening everybody? No, it's not Opie or Anthony. If you didn't catch yesterday's show, we are doing a worst of all week this week. It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. Great new music from the Smashing Pumpkins called Everlasting Gaze and some Faith No More before that. What's up, man? It's Rick. Sitting in for the guys, doing the worst of, as I was saying just a few moments earlier. If you've got any suggestions for today's show, feel free, call them in, 212-757-1027 or you can send it through the Instant Feedback, which we do have up and running at WNEW.com. Just click on ONA where it says Feedback into the Studio. We'll take your suggestions for today's worst of and keep in mind if we don't get through it today, there's a very good chance we'll probably get it in sometime later in the week, so keep listening, a'ight? Cool. As I said, let's get right to it, shall we, with a little Dr. Smith. I'm a pedophile lost in space. I was going to say that. You are a pedophile lost in space. Yes. What have you done to William? Oh dear. Take him into his little room and tuck him in for bed. No chicks for me. Maybe a little Penny. Yeah. Little Penny. Yeah, why didn't you go after Penny? She was a piece of ass in our family. That's what everyone would have expected. Right. That's what the Robinson family expected. They never thought I'd go after young William. No. And then Major West. Yeah. Major West screwing duty. Fine piece of cash, but she's a girl. I like young boys like William. Wow, this is an exclusive. Are you finally admitting this on our show today? Yes. Yeah? Dr. Zachary Smith, pedophile. Lost in space. My schween is like the robot's arm. Warning, warning. Oh dear. Help me. I have a robot in my pants. He can't figure that out. Help me. I want to go home. Sweet, sweet home. Where I can coach a boys soccer team or something. I'm getting tired of young William. The same little supple ass every night. Help me. Oh dear. I'm always fouling things up with a hydroponic garden. I was going to say, if you really wanted to go home, why are you always getting everyone in trouble? I can't help it. I'm a buffoon. A pedophile buffoon. Young William. Oh dear, looks like a plucked chicken, doesn't it? Come on. Take him off in that stupid little vehicle we're driving. Have a place him with that pointy ear monkey. Oh dear. Help me. Help me. I want to go home. Dr. Smith, everyone. To start off the Opium Anthony show. Oh boy. Got to love having a TV in the office. Yeah. Helps the show tremendously. Did you see him? I did see him, yes. Dr. Smith, he had some fat opera star after him or something. In a Viking outfit, right? In a Viking outfit. The best part was another stupid prop though. Yes, I had this wacky hatchet. It was a wooden hatchet. You could tell it was wooden and then they painted it like gold to make it look like some type of metal. Oh dear, not that much of a budget on that show. Help me, William. What was he doing with that hatchet? Nothing. I'm a big pussy. I'm such a pussy. I'm always hiding behind young William. Right behind him, yes. Very closely. Why are you so close to the boy, Dr. Smith? Yes, very close to the young boy. Very close. Dr. Smith, my senses are reading. You're getting a boner. Shut up, you clattering clunk of collisionous junk. Because I have a boner. Look at the boy. Is it true you're exploring black holes in space? Yes, black holes. Yes, where's Gary Coleman? He at least looks like a young boy. Pardon me. Dr. Zachary Smith would like a blow-up doll in the shape of an eight-year-old boy. Yes, William. Something in a hairless model? Oh dear. Dr. Smith, you sick son of a bitch. Yes, I like them like a plug chicken. Dr. Smith, you are a pervert. Shut up, you bubble-headed booby. Dr. Smith, remove yourself from that boy. Shut up, you cannot deny me the simple pleasures of being lost in space. Help me. I could at least get a little trim from a plug chicken. It's the later episodes that William is getting a little too old for me. Reaching the age of 13 or so. I was going to say, what was he, 10? Why can't they just stay eight years old? What a trusting family, letting me take them out on an empty planet to do whatever I please. I can't say that, Rick. Shut up, you bubble-headed booby. At least we didn't have to deal with snakes. It's the worst of all the inanimate. So pay attention, asshole. We're going to talk to the guy that was injured at a fast food restaurant. Very similar story like the one that appears in the papers today. Hello. Hello. Hey, what's up? Yeah, what's up, buddy? I was very injured. Where were you injured? At a fancy coffee shop. Okay. I was drinking coffee. You know how it makes you have to pinch your loaf if you drink too much. I went to the bathroom and I was very nervous. I had a loose stool, very messy. I couldn't find the toilet paper like the gentleman you read about. Yeah, in the paper today. I went to reach back and like him, the toilet seat shifted. It snapped out on my penis like a bear trap. I was all flattened like a fruit roller. I was screaming in pain. One of the workers came in and started laughing at me. And why was he laughing? And my ass was still soiled. I'm suing it. I was degraded. You were very degraded, huh? And now I can't have coital relationships with my wife no more. Well, were you having sex before the mishap? No. Oh, I see. But now it's very embarrassing because we tried. And she was laughing at me because when I got excited it looked like one of those party favors. It unrolled. You ever see the kids' parties? Oh, God. My slug was bashed apart. And I lost my glasses and my shoes. You lost your glasses and shoes when you were in there. And I spilled a hot coffee latte on my testicles. I got off the boat screaming, help me. And I slipped in my own feces and fell on a toilet plunger. And it impaled me in my back door. Ah, we didn't need to hear that. All the while they were laughing at me. They just said they'd get me a new coffee latte. But I couldn't drink in the establishment with a plunger lodged in my rear van. I don't think that would work. My penis was damaged. I know, that's what you said. I hear you're suing for like $2 million. $2 million. I can only make love to a coin slot now. Flat and damaged. Horrible. I went to the hospital. They lashed at me. They wanted to hook it up to some kind of air pump at the gas station. Pump some new life into that thing. Got an easy inflate. Sure. Like a basketball pump. Right. And I said, oh, you're hurting me. And they all laughed at my broil's testicles. I must say you're a mess. I'm suing. Okay. For $2 million over an injured peepee. Hey, can I speak to Anthony? Pull that one off, smartass. Oh, look. Well, Anthony's smoking a cigarette, sir. Stop it. His mother doesn't want to hear that. You'll be very angry. Oh, what? If she learns he's even smoking. Are you related to Anthony? No, but I know his mother. She'll be pissed. She'll be pissed if she knows that you're smoking a pack a day? Shut up. He's not smoking anymore. He was smoking for a couple of weeks during the trying period in his life. I see. Shut the f*** up. I also have heard that Anthony may be free-basing at this point. Don't even start those rumors. All right, I'll give in to the cigarette smoke. This is getting too real. Shut up. So there's no truth to the free-basing rumors? No. I don't know where that came from. Probably your stupid brother. Your mom wanted to know. That's all. I figured we'd bring it up on the air today. Whose mom? Mine? Anthony's mom. Oh, Anthony. Put him on the phone. Well, he's still busy smoking that cigarette. He's not smoking. Shut up. Oh, he's going to sue you. Anthony Will, my pal? He doesn't smoke. Okay. It was for a couple of weeks. Okay. But he quit again. Well, whose cigarettes are these in the studio then? Shut up. They're not smoking. There are no cigarettes in there. If his mother hears this, she's very angry. Oh, he's screwed. You know, if Anthony's going to be smoking again, he really should buy the ones with filters. They are. They were. They were filtered cigarettes. I'm going to kick your ass. All right, well, thank you for calling in with this exclusive story. Thank you. All right, bye-bye. Bye. I'm suing. Okay. Bye. All right. There's not as funny as a stinking school bus. I have a strong stomach. You guys made me throw up some socks. Great. The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. Oh, and I have my two new favorite horns. You guys are really horrible. O.P.E. and Anthony. What a couple of ass-wipes. 1027. W.N.E.W. And now, the worst of all. O.P.E. and Anthony. 1027. W.N.E.W. It's O.P.E. and Anthony. 2127571027 is our phone number. Kick it. That's Cole Chamber, by the way. Yeah. Very cool band. That rock. You know, I wanted to take a musical break here. Yeah. Just not diggin' the music we have picked out today. Grab something else. We just did a really bad job picking out the music today. Grab something else then. I thought some of this stuff would be cool today, and it's just, eh. Play something off the new Barry Williams CD. What is that? Have you heard any of that? No. Ah, it's frightening. Barry Williams, the return of Johnny Bravo. The return of Johnny Bravo, Anthony. Imagine what a bitch it is being this guy, Barry Williams. You're Greg Brady, and that's all you will ever be known as. No matter what you try to do. Like, he tried to get a singing career off the ground. And, uh, that petered out. And now he's trying again? Johnny's back. Johnny, the return of Johnny Bravo. So now he's even milking a character he played as Greg Brady. Adios, Johnny Bravo. Remember that episode? Yes. He left the family. They just wanted to sign Johnny Bravo. Greg Brady. Because the suit fit. Right. And he told everybody, sorry, he's got to go solo. But then it ended. They were all cool and got the band back together, Opie. And sang, it's a sunshine day. You know, we turned down Barry Williams for our radio show. Maybe we should have him on so he can play the Joe Pesci game. Or he play tracks from the new CD and then ask him if he expects to sell any of these things. It's still one of my favorite things we've done. Johnny's back. You want to hear some Barry Williams, Greg Brady as Johnny Bravo, Anthony? Is that what you're saying? Hold on to your hat. Yeah. Listen to this. Groovy. Johnny's back. Ha ha ha ha. Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. This is great. This is a goof, right? I think he's serious. Johnny's back. Johnny's back. Right. Alright, listen, I can't hear anymore of that one. Is there any other tracks on there worth trying out? Happy Together. Oh my God. Happy Together? Hey, Greg, it's 1999. Almost 2000. He's on the cover of the CD wearing his Johnny Bravo vest. With his triple chin. It's just trying to like fade into the real world. Barry. Gone. Hey, Tom, what's up? Are you trying to kill me? Come on. I'm dying here. It's Johnny Bravo. Let's go. Come on, man. Oh my God. Tommy's crying over here. Please stop it. End the madness. This rules. I think this is going to be album of the year. Tell you the truth. Alright, have a good day over there. Alright, man. Hey, our listeners are loving this. Bill, what's going on? Oh my God, turn this off or I slit my wrist, man. Come on. I can't hear this one smash, man. Come on, rip it out and smash it. It's going to make you puke. Oh God. Alright, Bill. Please stop. They're loving it, Anthony. It's very obvious here. He covers a Huey Lewis song. What track is that? Let's see. Hey, Luke. What's going on? What's up, guys? Hey. This is unbelievable, man. I'm loving this thing. You guys get so much props for playing this song. It's hysterical. Don't you love it? Greg Grady. I want this album. I want this album. The return of Johnny Bravo. Does the record company really truly believe that they're going to sell copies of this thing? Man, I have a compilation that's called The World's Worst Records. Yes. And I picked it up just as a goof. It's like I want to re-release my own version, man. This one could be the first song on it. Well, Johnny's back. And ready to rock. Yeah. Here's the Huey Lewis remake by Greg Grady as Johnny Bravo. Off his latest CD, everybody. Talk it up. Crank it up. This is going to be a hit. You used to be a renegade. A renegade. You used to fool around. Yeah. With Alice. I couldn't take the punishment. Had to settle down. Now I'm playing it please, Frank. Yes, I've got my hair. I'm going crazy, and I don't even care. Cause I can tell what's going on. It's hip to be square. Yeah. Hip to be square. Mike, what's going on? I almost ruined the damn road, man. Why? This guy's got a style. Yeah. I'm crazy, but I know you can't, cause I can tell what's going on. It's hip to be square. Yeah. Hip to be square. Mike, what's going on? I almost fell off the damn road, man. Why? I gotta stop this. This is top shelf stuff, man. Yeah, where can I get it? You obviously don't know music like Anthony and I. I apparently don't. Well, I'm pegging this as album of the year. Without a doubt. Absolutely. Hey, I'll send you the copy for Christmas. Alright, thank you, Mike. Alright. Hip to be a renegade. Yeah, that must have been the episode where it was called Smoking. Johnny's back, and well it's a rock. Hip to be square. Hip to be square. There he is. I would rather hear Corky say. We got any other tracks off of that, man? Yeah, let's go. And what is this one again? I wasn't listening. We are the champions. We are the champions. Ah, this has gotta be good. Well, tribute to Freddie Mercury. Rich, real fast, what's going on? Guys, I will do anything you need to. Please don't play another song. Come on. Come on. I just watched some guy in a car split his girlfriend's throat and wrote, No more Johnny Bravo with her blood on the passenger side window. That was Greg Brady. Come on, we're tracking through the new Johnny Bravo CD. I think it's very important for Anthony and I to be up on our music. Guys, if you spin another tune, you'll be able to listen to me drive my car into this bridge. Oh really? Let's try that. Alright. Alright. I'm not kidding. Ah. Here it comes, Rich. That guy's fine. Vocal stylings. I've made my dues. Time after time. Yes. I've done my sentence, but committed no crime. And bad mistakes. There he goes. I've made a few. Speaking of Freddie Mercury, proud. I've had my share of bad mistakes. I've made a few. I've had my share of bad mistakes. I've made a few. I've had my share of bad mistakes. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. I've made a few. That's what he calls it. Oh. Bring it home, Greg. We are the champions. No time to lose us. We are the champions. Of the world. Ronnie, what's going on? Yo, dude, you're killing me. You guys are killing me here. I've already sliced my wrist. Don't let me bleed out. Come on, it's Johnny Bravo. It's Johnny Bravo. Let's go. Don't let me bleed out to Johnny Bravo. I'm going. Johnny's back. I'm going. All right, thank you. See you later. Bye. It's a sunshine day. Everybody's smiling. Should we try the sunshine medley before we move on here? I think we played one of the songs. We've got to get to the sunshine day. Oh, it's Johnny Bravo doing a Beatles song, Anthony. Awesome. Here comes Johnny. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, it's Johnny Bravo doing a Beatles song. That's Johnny Bravo doing a Beatle song. He sounds a lot like Corky. No, no, no, no, this is Johnny Bravo. Oh, okay. I was getting a little confused. Barry Williams. Yes. Here's Johnny Bravo doing Poison Ivy, Anthony. Oh, he did that too? Yeah, he did. Alright, let me hear that. Alright, from the new Johnny Bravo CD. Yeah, Johnny's back. It almost sounds like that. And I'm ready to rock. Johnny Bravo, everyone. Poison Ivy. I don't know, it sounds like Corky, man. No, it's Johnny Bravo, Anthony. Oh, I can never get enough of that. After listening to Johnny Bravo do Poison Ivy, I think it was a crack pipe they found in Greg's jacket. Greg, have you been smoking crack? Your mother and I are concerned. Let me find another track from the Johnny Bravo CD, Anthony. Wow, he does Mr. Tambourine Man too. Really? Johnny Bravo CD, when you were looking at it? I just skimmed over it, I guess. Okay, another one from the Johnny Bravo CD. Little different musical stylings here. Oh, it's showing his range. Musical intro. Sure. It'll kick in. Builds the drama, I guess, of Johnny Bravo. Oh, yeah. Groovy tambourine. Now it's starting off a little slow. It's getting that 70s feel. Mr. Tambourine Man. Mr. Tambourine Man. Mr. Tambourine Man. I guess he didn't feel like singing this one, Anthony. Yeah, really? What's up with that? Oh, wait a minute. Here's some basketball. Go. Mr. Tambourine Man. Play a song for me. I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to. I'm going to. Mr. Tambourine Man. Play a song for me. In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you. As you're in a pool. What the hell is that? On your magic swirling ship, my senses have been stripped. My senses have been stripped. What was that? A little skip in the Johnny Bravo CD. I don't think it's a Johnny Bravo CD either. My toes are too numb to step. I wait only for my foothills to be wandering. Wandering? Yes. Be my boy. Oh my God. I'm ready to go anywhere except that pool. I'm ready to go to the parade. My hair will get wet and fall off. And to my own parade, cast your dancing spell on my way. I promise to go under it. Alright, so you got me. That wasn't Johnny Bravo. I think that's our own James Tiberius Kirk. That's right. Little shatner doing Mr. Tambourine Man. I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to. My booty is to be wandering. And one last one from Johnny Bravo. Hey, he's doing Bobby's part. Who the hell is ever going to buy this damn freaking CD, man? Wacky DJs? We didn't buy it if it was sent to us. Gino, you're next on FM Talk. What's going on? You guys are killing me, man. It's like kryptonite. I don't even have the strength to go to the radio and shut it off. Listen, I got to hear Joe Pesci on the phone because I missed it. I need Joe Pesci after this. At the time, Joe Pesci called to promote his CD that was out last year. Yeah, he was putting out a CD of Italian songs and stuff. From my cousin, there was a My Cousin Vinny rap or something. And we had him on the phone. A lot of people thought it was Anthony doing Pesci but I swear to God it was actually Pesci. Why not Joe Pesci from Arthur Avin? And we made fun of him. And why don't you file away the Johnny Bravo because I'm sure there's hours of listening pleasure there. Oh yeah. Alright, give it to me over here. Johnny Bravo. Yeah, this is a good one. I believe we could do at least two or three more hours of radio on Johnny Bravo. I want to keep this because I think after playing it just once like that, the requests are just going to come flying in for us. Sure, sure. So I'll put it somewhere safe. Yeah, but put it right next to the Steve O'Lench CD. Oh, look. You ever see a Johnny Bravo CD come apart like that? A little platoon reference. I see that. Thank you. Yeah, this is Joe Pesci from a year ago. Hi, this is Bill and I feel your pain. That's why I'd like to tell the American people about a way to reduce the stress in your life and help put a smile on your lips. I'm reducing my all new Big Willie Pop. Suck on a Big Willie Pop and you'll see why women everywhere just can't stop. Made with all natural ingredients, my Big Willie Pop has a cream center that is a great source of protein. And moms, you'll be happy to know that once you unzip my package, your kids can suck on my Big Willie Pop all day. Hey, what do you have on your mouth? Nothing. Come on, you can tell me. What are you sucking on? Okay, don't tell anyone. It's a Big Willie Pop. Wow, can I taste? Yeah, here, wrap your lips around this. Mmm. Hey, give that back. I'm not sucking on it. Oh, no. So listen and listen good, because I'm only going to say this once. Satisfy your craving and put my Big Willie Pop in your mouth. Excuse me, can I have one? Sure, Chelsea. Come here. And, I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. Okay, terrific. And, cut. Opie Anthony 1027 WNEW. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. Korn playing April 1st at the Continental Arena. April 8th at Nassau Coliseum. If you've never seen Korn, you've got to check them out. Unbelievable live show. I've been jamming the Issues CD. Yeah. In my CD Walkman on the train. I've been playing a lot of the Kid Ra. That one. Devil without a cause, I'm going platinum. You like the Kid Ra again? Yeah. I really like that Jack album. I like it. I don't think he's got much longevity in the biz, let's say. But, I like the sound of the album. Why would you say that? I don't know. I don't think it's the type of product that I don't think you can consistently pump out album after album of. You know? Well, that's the curse of being in today's music. You're only good for a couple CDs and you're done. Yeah, there's no Chaplains or The Who's or anything like that where every year you have pumping out an album that sells as good as the last. Well, Korn's showing a little longevity right now. Yeah. A little bit. We'll have to wait and see what they pump out next. You know, the Peppers. The Peppers. Foo Fighters. Foo Fighters. Foo Fighters. Big time Foo Fighters. I thought that was going to be a one disc and they're out of here. What? Nirvana's drummer? What? Yeah. And now look, he's more popular than he ever was. Big man on campus, yeah. And Foo Fighters get to that point where they're more popular than Nirvana ever was. Yeah. Getting there, I said. I know that's a debate we could argue for the next two hours. Calm down. Calm down. Okay, Mr. Pushups. But yeah, the Kid Rock thing, like I said, love the album, but I don't think, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. That stuff, it can get old real fast, you know what I mean? Speaking of albums, Michael Hutchins' solo album comes out today. Oh, really? I hate. How's he doing? I hate listening to Dead Guys. And that's sad. It really bothers me. Yeah. I mean, I'm a huge Nirvana fan. I have a tough time listening to Kurt. Yeah. I still do it. I mean, you can listen to the Hendrix and the old school, as they like to say. But I don't know. Like Michael Hutchins, I mean, his body's barely cold and he's got a new album out today, a solo album. Dude, you know what's worse though than listening to old Nirvana is when you turn in SNL and Nirvana was on, you watch Saturday Night Live and see Kurt singing and stuff, that's hard to watch. That's kind of creepy and stuff. It's like, ah, you ass. It's a bummer. You blew it. I wonder what Nirvana would have been if Kurt would have survived. Well, speculate forever. I'm sure Dave Grohl doesn't care. Your buddy Kid Rock's going to perform on the Grammys tomorrow. My buddy? It's not my buddy. We'd like the Kid Rock, right? Yeah. Carlos Santana, Anthony, we want to get to that story. What, his uncle was a kid toucher when he was growing up? I don't know if it was his uncle. Well, what does it say? I just said that. He just said he was a molester. Of course, the song, that's up for a Grammy, a few Grammys. I'm CBS FM. You want to give me a little extra? It's too late now. Past the post. I don't know why he picked now to come out and say that he was molested as a child. But he said he had counseling and he's free from guilt and shame. And he's up for 10 Grammys. 10 Grammys. And he's coming out with this now. It just seems the timing's a little odd. Now, what's the story? Why didn't he come out on the stage of Woodstock and say that? You know? What's the story though? Someone touched his pee pee or what? It just says he was molested as a child. Yeah. For a couple of years when he was a kid. And it makes him feel uncomfortable. But he's over it. It doesn't say who, what, where, when or anything. Yeah. Someone had instant feedback when we talked about it earlier. It says, is he Cuban? Because that's just part of their culture. And no, I don't think so. It took him 35 years to get nominated, Anthony. He's going to sweep the Grammys tomorrow. Do you think so? He is the favorite. Everyone says that he's going to take it all. He's going to win everything tomorrow. Him, the song. He didn't write that song, though, you know. Did Rob Thomas write it? He's part writer on that. Yeah. With another guy. And then I love when the Grammys come around because you realize what phonies some of these people are. Like Ricky Martin. Living La Vida Loca? He's not on that. He didn't write that song. And you realize when the Grammys come around, it's the best song. Living La Vida Loca. Written by... It's like, what? That's not Ricky Martin. He didn't write the goddamn thing. Yeah, that's up for record of the year. There's a couple of them like that. Album of the Year. It is just pathetic what music has become today. Album of the Year. Backstreet Boys. Dixie Chicks. The Chixie Dix. Diana Krall. Don't even know who she is. I have no clue. Santana and then TLC. Britney Spears is up for one. Isn't she, Britney? Did you see her little Sunday layout in the Sunday Daily News TV section? I think one of those, like the magazine section that they have in the Daily News. I missed that. Special bonus poster. Yeah, special boner poster maybe. She's got those big cans of hers out. Her lips are just like, I swear to God it looks like she had just been with a guy. She's got lips. Hummer lips. She has, they're all engorged and just glazed over with some product. I don't know what the hell is going on. She's got of course the belly showing. I love hummer lips. God, is that the biggest turn on the big full hummer lips? And then she's telling, you know, she's 18 now. I know. Just had her birthday. She's totally legal now. We could get her in Playboy officially. Yeah. And things that she collects. Do I want to feel old? What? She was born 1982. You feel old? It's only three years before my girlfriend. That's nuts. Yeah, she says in that article she collects diamonds. Well, there's something any 18-year-old can relate to. Right. She's collecting diamonds. Fantastic, Brittany. And then she also says she will never pose in Playboy. Someone asked her now that she's legal age. Let me tell you something about Britney Spears and Playboy. If that next album comes out and it tanks, she'll be naked in Playboy. Absolutely. Guaranteed. She'll be hoping for Playboy. I'm praying that the next album tanks so we get her in Playboy while she's still nice and tight. Yeah. Because she'll be in Playboy eventually. I hate when they do that. Yeah, they're 18, 19 years old. They don't want to do Playboy. All of a sudden their career is gone. They're in their 30s and they decide now they're going to strip? Yeah. Take it back. I hope her album tanks so bad, Playboy passes her right by and she's got to go right to Swank. I want to see her in Swank. I want beef curtains. Let me give you a Swank. I'm going to give you a Swank pose. Not the Swank pose. I hate when you do that, man. Like up on the console. The Swank pose. The Swank pose. Right to Swank. Right to the let's see what Britney had for lunch pose. Can't wait to see her on the Grammys tomorrow though. Oh yeah. All right. Is she performing? I would think so. That's probably a big attention getter. I would assume so, sure. Well actually, Ben gave me the list of performers at the Grammys here. Let's run through them, Opie. Oh wait, where's the performers list, Ben? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Britney's got to perform, right? She is. She is performing. With her little headset mic on. All right. So she can massage her cans while she's saying she rubs her belly and stuff. Yeah. God, every time I have that remote control and I pass by the Nickelodeon channel, I've got to stop. They show the Britney Spears concert like four times a day. That was the one with her nips popping out. No, this is the other one. Oh, it wasn't? No, she still has the belly shirt and stuff. I thought it was from the Nickelodeon Labette Awards show where she went on and she's performing in front of a bunch of ten-year-olds and her nips look like pencil erases. It's like two thumbs. That's classic. It's Billy Bardy's fingers. Yeah, Britney Spears will be performing tomorrow, man. Oh, cool. I'm trying to see. What about the Backstreet Boys or NSYNC? Of course they're performing. The only one I want to see tomorrow, there's only three people I want to see perform tomorrow. Backstreet... No, just kidding. Sting, Santana. What's Sting going to be doing? Kid Rock and Britney Spears performing. Oh, they don't tell you what? Well, Sting's latest album is doing really, really well. Yeah? Yeah, he'll probably perform one from there. Has Puffy copped any lines off of his new music yet to change it to millions of dollars for Puffy? Give him a couple more months and he'll have something going on with that, I'm sure. Ben from Jersey, I saw the poster for about two seconds before I put a map of Alaska on it talking about the Britney Spears in the Sunday paper. That thing rocks. It's very good. Keep the instant feedback going. We finally figured out a system where we can read all the instant feedbacks. It got a little crazier since we've gone all talk. Speaking of Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, kudos to Carson Daly this weekend on MTV. He was right. He was right. Believe me, I don't give him kudos very often. He was doing this lame ass win a date with NSYNC and he had to deal with these little teeny boppers who'd come running out on stage and answer questions and tell why they want to go on a date with all five NSYNC band members. For what, a gang bang? An NSYNC gang bang? Oh, I thought this was going to be fun. It hurts. It hurts. So, Carson, inadvertently... I thought we were going out for ice cream and a little roller skating. I thought we were going to play air hockey and get a float. Why? That's all I want to say. I thought we were going bowling. You seem like such nice boys in the magazines. Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm bleeding. Oh, my Lord. Why? You don't know from where. Ask her. Carson calls them NSYNC right on stage in front of them. And the whole crowd's like, boom, boom, bunch of little teeny boppers. He's like, what? It was a slip. I made a mistake. And then NSYNC starts giving him... starts razzing him, not calling him NSYNC. He's like, you be quiet. You want your next song to be on Total Request Live? Just shut up. You can tell he just did not want to be there and deal with that. Like he says, he's buddies with Kid Rock and stuff. And then Kid Rock calls up and goes, ooh, how was NSYNC? Were they fun to hang with? All I told him was razz in his ass. You fag. Did you get one? What a day with NSYNC. NSYNC. Oh, this is great. I thought we were going out for ice cream. Why are you playing cards in my bag? Ow! Why are you grabbing at my little nubs? The doctor never put anything in there. Oh! So wrong. I look like I could buy his doughnut. That's a stupid contest, though. It really is. They all come running out on the stage. I was hypnotized by it. Like I turned it on. I'm like, what the hell is this? They go, okay, I'm now from Buena Park, California. It's candy. And she comes running out, whaa! Just screaming and jumping. Her pigtails are flying. I love NSYNC. I don't want to go on a date. I don't want... What the... What do you think is going to happen? And they all propose to me. We're all living together in a big house. The five of us, just me. It's great. They don't have sex with me, but I get the money and I get all the pictures. And I'm retarded. And I go, whoa, whoa. Opie and Anthony. Oh, those guys are fast! 127 WNEW. Hey, what's up, man? This is Rick, the producer of The Opie Show. The guys are out all week this week. If you didn't know that by now, we're doing worst of all week. So if you've got any suggestions whatsoever for today, if we can't get them today, maybe we'll slip them in tomorrow or Thursday or Friday. Whatever. 2127571027.

You'll find the link where you can send in your suggestions. I? Cool. And by now, all you guys know that Mountain Dew is the official soft drink of the NCAA trip to the Final Four weekend, which is coming up the weekend of April 1st. They're going to be sending a lucky winner and a friend to go check it out. And we're going to announce that winner on the 27th. So keep track because this weekend is a lot of interesting matchups coming up, especially with Seton Hall still in. And I believe Syracuse is still in. So interesting stuff concerning at least Big East teams and, you know, Duke, of course, is still in there and blah, blah, blah. And Gonzaga or Gonzaga. How the hell do you pronounce that anyway? I don't know. But like I said, NCAA Mountain Dew, we're going to be announcing the winner on the 27th. So make sure you check out Mountain Dew at your local retailer for the end of the cap game and do the dew with Mountain Dew and the NCAA. Getting back to the worst of. We've got requests for some broken jaw, which is coming up a little bit later. Bill Clinton on cops. Lots of requests for going to get it on later on. I'll say right now in the five o'clock hour if you're listening specifically for that and a bunch of other stuff, including some J Moore as well. All right. Cool. Let's get back to it with a little visit from Crystal Storm, the lady with the biggest chest in the world. The worst of Opie and Anthony. It's Opie and Anthony. It's our show. This is it. It's what you get. Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven. It's W.A.W. I'm very excited, Anthony, that I got that laser eye surgery. This is a commercial. Don't worry. I'm going to be very happy to see what it's about to walk through that studio door. Yeah. God, look at all the salespeople. All the salespeople are kind of camping out outside the studio door. They want to see this, huh? Look at everyone coming around. Well, we got to welcome Crystal Storm to the show. Yeah. She's one hundred and twenty two inches around up top there. Oh, my God. Here she comes. Wow. Oh, my goodness. Wow. Look at that. My God. Those are huge. And she's good looking. Yeah. Usually they're messes. I mean, no offense. Obviously, you're a dancer. Yeah. I mean, you wouldn't just like all of a sudden have boobs like that if you weren't a dancer. Well, you never know. I don't know. They seem like they might be inconvenient for other jobs, you know? Yeah, that's true. How many guys talk to your eyes? Not too many. Not too many, huh? I got this board in the way, so I think I'm going to be the first guy to talk to your eyes. Oh, cool. I'll just stare at it. I won't know what to do then. Like, normally I would be embarrassed or something if there's just a girl on the street and she's got big or very nice boobs and I'm looking at them. I try not to. You know, you look up at the eyes. But since you went through the time and expense of getting boobs that big and you're a dancer and you like guys looking at your boobs, I'll just stare at your boobs. I won't even look at your eyes. Okay, that's cool. Okay. We should share a moment with our new boss because he's like peeking outside the studio door. All right. Oh, I see him out there. Rick, let Ken in. Our new boss, Ken Stevens. Hey, I was just getting coffee. All right, Ken. Grab that micro fast. Our new boss in the studio, Ken Stevens. We haven't had him on the radio yet. It took big boobs then to get you in the studio. I swear it was a coincidence. You don't have to believe that at all. No, I don't, man. How many times have we seen Ken outside the studio in the last, how long have you been here now? Two months? Three months? Actually, maybe once. Yeah, I don't even think he's been in here while we've been on the air. It's a nice studio. Is it? Yeah, very nice. He's got a cup of coffee in his hand covering all his bases, but he's like peeking in the studio door. I figure we'd let him in. Yeah, that coffee machine's empty out there. Everybody's using it as the excuse. I need coffee. I'll admit I was looking in the window. Yeah. Well, you know, you never, how often do you get to see breasts that big? You're absolutely right. And they are how big? They're 121 XXX. XXX? Yeah. XXX. Oh my God. Those are very big. We've got to get some pictures for the unofficial website. Yes. Yeah, let's get the really good picture. Let's get the real picture. Oh my God. Holy! You know, that's unbelievable. That's like, where do you get a, the bra is stretched to its limits. Look at how huge that bra is. You know what each cup looks like? Remember the old crash helmets they used to wear at the Indy 500? Or the old football helmets back in the old days when the gift played? Right, the leather helmets. That's what they look like. And there's like two bowling balls in there. And look at the thing, the lacing that holds the cups together. I've seen that on the Verrazano Bridge. It like holds the roadway up to the cables. Yeah, there's a little stress there. That is unbelievable. And she's got a tiny little waist. Yeah, she's got a really little waist. Little waist, blonde hair. Cute butt. Like what is that, like a little Spanish outfit you're wearing? Yeah. Like a little Zorro outfit or something? Yeah. Boo-Boo. Look at you. The sides of the pants are all cut out, I think. If you haven't noticed, yes, she has legs. Not many people looking at those. You kind of feel bad that it takes away from the rest of you because you're an attractive girl and everything. And you've got these huge boobs that everyone just focuses on. It's like why bother putting makeup on? Really, you can look like Ernest Borgner and it's just like, hey look. But you do very well I guess dancing, huh? Actually, it's a lot of fun. I get to travel all over the country and New York City is one of my favorite stops. I come here probably about four or five times a year. Where are you from? I'm from Florida. Oh, Florida. From beautiful what part of Florida? Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Let's bring to the main stage right about now. A woman with huge breasts. I don't even know her name but we need some white snake for that. Yeah, yeah. You like dancing to the 80s hair band music? There you go. Is that what you do? Hell yeah. You do it in Atlanta and Florida. I dance all different kinds of music. You ever get any like pole wounds on those things when you're swinging around the pole? Oh, I wouldn't sit around the pole with these. Really? You could probably do like a pole thing where you put the pole in between them. Right. Go to try that. Lose the pole. And you could just lose the pole in there. And you want to do the rules. You want to do the real intro for her? Her name's Crystal Storm, 122 inch breast. Here we go. Ready? Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring to the main stage right now for beautiful Fort Lauderdale Crystal Storm. Fort Lauderdale, 22 inch breast. Let's give her a big hand and make her feel welcome today. They all sound like that, don't they? Yeah. Isn't that stupid? They all sound like they belong over at K-Rock. Hi, I'm 92 bit of rock black. That's 122 inch, boom. Yeah, that's something. God damn. Do you do any breast tricks? Oh yeah. Yeah, what do you do? Lots of stuff. Can you do a breast trick for us? Okay. Which one can you do? I need a volunteer. Look at all the hands going up. Jesus Christ. Get Spaz. He's been working his ass off. Okay, but I got to unleash the girls for this one. That's fine. Oh damn. What a shame. If anyone has a question for Crystal Storm in her breast, 212-757-1027. Spaz. Here's Spaz. I can't do it. Wait. Shut up. Shut up, you girlfriend. Shut up. We used to get you laid. Shut up. This guy has had sex with more of our listeners. You're a jerk-off. Now that he has a girlfriend, he doesn't want to participate. No, it's going to be Spaz. Okay, Spaz. You're not going to have sex with her, Spaz. Oh my God. Oh my dear sweet Jesus. She just unleashed him, Anthony. All right. Now look. Holy mother of pearl. That's got to be difficult to live with. There's got to be some drawbacks to having two human heads. I mean look. You know what they look like? To tell you the truth, you ever see the Star Trek episode with the big ass head aliens? The first one I believe was called the Menagerie with Captain Christopher Pike? Her boobs look like the alien heads. They're attractive though. I mean I've seen the big braided girls and yeah. I mean that's a turn on. This is the first one that's a turn on. Very big. Very nice. All right. Are we ready for the breast trick? All right. Spaz. Hey, why don't you explain what's going on? Spaz now on his knees. Oh, facing away. Now she's putting the boobs away. Wait, wait. The boobs are in front of his eyes. He's like blinded. Oh, he's got boob eyes. Wow. Can you hold anything under those? Sure. What do you hold? Like what's the biggest thing you've ever held under your boobs? Can you hold a magic eight ball? That's easy. She needs something more than that. Wow, yeah, that's nothing. Now we've got to find something. Oh my God. Hey, what size were you before you had those put in? I was a 65 triple F. What? So they were big anyway. Yeah, they were pretty big. You could tell by nip size, Opie. I don't think those would be on like A cups. No. Tell you the truth. And then what made you decide to go up to that size? Well, gravity. Really? It started maybe sagging a little bit because you'd had boobs. When did you develop? How old were you? I was about 10. About 10 and you started getting boobs? I was a D cup. Thank God 10 year old boys aren't that teasing or anything in schools. You probably didn't have much of a problem at 10 with the boys teasing you. So I just had my extra skin sewed up and I had them lifted. Lifted? So they're nice and high. With like a come along? That would be how they lift those. Wow. Look at that. I'm sorry. I can't take my eyes off. They look natural. I'm just looking. In a bizarre way they look natural. They're nice and firm up top. Natural on Jupiter. Where is that natural, Opie? What are you insane? Actually most of them are natural. My supports are at the bottom. Your supports? Yep. You're talking about them like it's the new building going up in Times Square. Almost. All right. Let's talk to a few guys. They're freaking out here. Stan, what's up? Hey, I just called from Queens and I could see her left boob right from my apartment, man. I was going to climb on top of it. I was going to climb on top of it. I was going to climb on top of it. I was going to climb on top of it. I was going to climb on top of it. All right, Stan. Wow. Thank you. I'm stunned. Do you ever do movies or anything? I have four movies. You have four movies? Mm-hmm. What, like Disney? Yeah. With the seven dwarfs. Yeah, really. No, you've done some porno? Yeah. Yeah? A couple of them. What kind? What are the titles? Breastful Fantasies. Yeah. I figured they'd be focusing on your assets there. Okay. Unexpected Entry. Oh. Very nice. Well, I bet that involves the book. The back door. The leather Cheerios. Does it? The burglar. The burglar? What, wait, is that when you're in bed and a burglar comes in? Something like that. And he's like, oh my God, I broke into the house with a girl with a huge boobs. This is great. I won't even take the TV. Crystal Storm in our studio. She's got a website, www.crystallstorm.com. Wow. Hey, Jim, what's going on? I'm a breast man myself. I like to know how big my nipples are, man. They must be big. I'm a breast man. I'm a breast man. I'm a breast man. I'm a breast man. How big are my nipples? They must be like pancakes, those things. I got to tell you, they're pretty big. I'm looking at the top of a ... About the size of a coffee cup. Yeah, more like the ... I saw a coffee cup. Yes. More like the big cup at McDonald's when you get the super-sized... Who made a Brock Holman? Good year. Good year. Could you do some jumping jacks for us? Oh no, no, good year. That would probably really hurt. I'd probably give myself a black eye, and all of you guys too. Yeah. All at the same time. That would probably hurt. There are some drawbacks. It's very hard to sleep, but I kind of solved that problem. What do you sleep? How do you sleep? I had a custom mattress made where they cut holes into the mattress. Get out of here! Really? You have little pockets for your boobs to go into? Yes. Wow. You never see that in any commercials. We had to travel with a mattress though. That's kind of a pain. Really? That's funny. You just take the saws all out and cut a couple of holes in there? That's just good to go. Walter, what's up? Yeah, how are you doing? I just want to know if she floats like a pontoon boat. Yeah, you ever go swimming in the summer? I've seen a lifeboat and the last time I was at the beach I saw this one girl. She was floating like a pontoon boat so I just decided to run out there and try to rescue her and just float on top of her. Now actually, when I swim I sink. Oh really? It's really, really scary. They're like weights? Yeah, they weigh 20 pounds a piece. Oh, 20 pounds a piece. 40 pounds a piece. That's a buoyant weight I guess. No, they do sink. How much do you weigh overall? About 145 pounds. Yeah, because she's really small besides her boobs. Yeah, so what is that, silicon? No. Saline? Saline supports it. Isn't that salt water or something like that? Or just be neutral buoyancy? I don't know. It should be I guess. I don't know. They need some ballast tanks in there or something. It doesn't work that way. AJ wants to comment about your website which is CrystalStorm.com. AJ? Oh, what do you say? Holy cow. It's nuts. And I want to answer your question. What's the story with the lion? Elvis? I guess. Yeah, I used to do stage shows with Elvis and I used to take him around and we did shows with the club until he was about, I'd say about 500 pounds. And then he started getting too big for the stages and now he's in Las Vegas doing shows. Can you lift him up with your breasts too? No, no. What's Elvis, a tiger or something? He's an African lion. Oh really? Yeah, he's kind of a pet for me. Very cool. He's real cool. Alright AJ, a lot of people have questions here. How about like sex with guys and stuff? They really enjoy that? Sex with guys and stuff, you know they really enjoy those big ones like that? Oh yeah. Yeah? It probably takes away from ground zero though, you know. They probably want to just do things to your boobs. Sometimes. Tell me honestly, has there been one guy that didn't want to do the TF? No. Yeah, see? Of course. Like who wouldn't want to? Oh, I just asked. There hasn't been one guy that she slept with that hasn't wanted to give her the TF. It's obvious. I mean, you wouldn't go. It's like going to Disney and not going on Space Mountain. You know? You'd have to do the TF. Benny, you're next on the program. What's up? Hey Chris, I was wondering, can you perform 69? Um, yeah. I got this vision, you know, you're on your back and my seat would be five feet in the air. Like an inclined plane, you know? That depends on how big your belly is too. Yeah. Because that could be a problem. I see. Can I sit between or what? Can I get between those two? See? Every guy would just want the TF. Thank God. Thank you, Benny. Act sounds like he's in love with Crystal. Tom, what's up? Yeah, I think he's in love. I think he's trying to hook up. I think it's the coffee that I've been drinking. I'm all wired. I think he's seeing the heart and the love in his eyes. Really? Well, I gotta tell you Tom, she's a cute girl. A lot of these big-breasted women, they're kind of, you know, they're slobby, you know? But she's very attractive. Well, why don't you take a shot at it? Oh yeah, okay. Got it. That'll be great as they call her as a witness in my divorce. What? So, Anthony, who you been seeing? Oh, great, yeah. A girl with a 122-inch breast. That's great. Thank you, Tom. No, I'm talking a lot because Tom, it's radio. What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and go, uh, uh. Joyce, what's going on? Hi, I have a question for Crystal. Okay. Okay. Right. So, do you find, I mean, was your inspiration, is this, are you naturally larger and then you went larger by surgery or did you have a picture in mind of this is how large I want to go and I'm going to use this as an act and I'm going to make myself known that way? Right. Well, actually, I was pretty large. I was a triple F cut before I started and I went into... Holy Magilla. Sorry. I went into the doctor and I asked for a reduction and the doctor said, how old are you? I was 18 and he said, you are too young to get a reduction because there's a lot of scars with a reduction. Really? Really. So, he said, let me just still you up and lift him up higher and your back won't hurt anymore. You know, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You go in... You have back pain and hurt with carrying that much weight up front? Well, it's the way it's distributed, actually. Oh. You went to the doctor that you won't go in, you're 18 years old, you want a reduction because you're so big and he goes, no, let me pump them up bigger and lift them up higher. My God, I won't do a reduction. That would be unethical. Let me pop some frigging cassava melons in here. My God. I'd like to be a double D. I'm always self-conscious about being small. I wanted to see what you thought. You were bigger already and you went bigger. How about somebody smaller going bigger? Can I recommend something? Go to Toys R Us, get two hoppity hops. You ever see those things? And just slam those in there. Your husband will love you. Bounce around the house. Laurie has a question for you. Laurie. I'd like to know if you had a special mattress made. Uh-huh. What kind of sheets do you use? Oh, she gets those at bed, boobs and beyond. It's amazing. Hey, turn down your radio. Hi. Hi, who's this? Hey, it's Craig from Wolf Damp. Hey, Craig, guess what? Did I win? You are the hundred and seventh caller. No way. I won. I won. You're kidding, right? Hundred and seventh. Oh, wow.

Sheryl yeah. what's going on Sheryl? big fu to o and a. what seems to be the problem Sheryl? I'm a black listener and I enjoy listening to your show, but I think you guys go too far when you talk about black sometimes. Why? What, spirit checkers? We go too far when we talk about a lot of things. That was Regis. But it's a different flavor when you're talking about black. That was Regis. That was Regis. Yeah, Anthony, it was Regis. That was a character. That was a character. The Mr. Anthony is a cactus. Is that what it is? You need more cactus, huh? I think you guys are so great. I really enjoy your humor, but sometimes I think you go a little far. Is it because you're a racist? No. You don't think you are? No, not at all. Can I ask you something? Sure. When we're making fun of Whitey, are you sitting there in your car laughing your black ass off? My black ass off? No, because even then sometimes I think you go too far even with the women. We go too far with a lot of things. But it's okay. It's okay sometimes. But can you try to be a little... We're trying to make people lighten up and just laugh a little bit. Lighten up? What do you mean by that? I mean offensive right there. Why do you have to lighten up? Yeah, darken up. Let's darken up. Darken up a little bit. Have a little fun. So you guys are offended by that line too. Why is lightening up getting more fun and everything? Yeah, that's right. Why is that? I'm outraged. I can't have more fun. My sister Cheryl, I agree wholeheartedly. Now, do I sound like that? No, that's whatever now. He doesn't sound like that either. We love our African princesses out there. You do? Oh yes. You guys are my favorites. Opie wants to bang one of you. Do you have a big penis or a little penis? Compared to what you guys are used to. The stereotype of what you're used to is probably big. I wouldn't want to challenge that stereotype. I'll say that. Do you eat well? Yes, I do. Oh, you should. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, you should have a code word right there. We all know the brothers don't appreciate that. You see, that's why I didn't marry a brother. Oh, you married a white guy? Of course. Now Cheryl, is that stereotype true? That the brother doesn't like going south? No, that's not true. I've heard that. No, I've gone out with guys who said, just let me do that. That's all I want to do. Cheryl, can I ask you why did you marry a white guy? Because he had a big dick. Oh, sorry. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't even say that. You can't even say that. You married a white guy because he had a big one? And he ate well. Really? Yeah. The best of both worlds. That's it? That was the only reason? Oh, and he was intelligent. And what about... Oh, well, why? Are you saying black guys aren't intelligent, Cheryl? Of course they're intelligent. Then why did you marry a white guy based on his intelligence? That's why I fell in love with him. Who are you kidding? You married him for the benefits. Well, I own my own business, so he couldn't give me too many benefits. You do? Where is the crack house? I'm kidding. See, Cheryl, we can kid like this. Teasing. Where is the crack house? We're teasing. You see, that's the stereotype that if a black owns his own business, it's probably a legal drug place. But we're just kidding. What nationality are you, Anthony? I'm Sicilian, so I'm part black. So you're in the mafia? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am. There you go. And, Opie, what are you? I'm a mutt. So you're a mutt? I'm a little of everything. And you like Puerto Rican girls, right? I'm going out with one, sure. He likes them, but he wants... I want some black tail, though. I don't think you can handle it. You know, once you go black, you never go back. That's what I hear. That's what they say. He wants to partake in some of that purple-winged bat. You know what? You might be a little disappointed in me because I'm not that dark. Oh, really? No, my fave is the café lattes. Oh, okay. What have you got? I'm café latte. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. No, Opie wants something like purple. Yeah, see, I don't... Opie wants something shining. No, my first choice is the café latte. Opie wants like, stymie with hair. You know what, Anthony? You know a lot about what Opie wants, but you don't have a woman, do you? Hey, yes, I do. At your hand, Rosie? Yeah, that's it. Rosie Cone? That's right. Okay. She's trying to get you, Anthony. Yeah. Hey, at least I'm white. So she... Oh, wow. I'm kidding. You know, it's not the reason. I would never say anything like that unless I knew it was a... And she knew it was a joke. It's so outrageous and so out there. It's obviously not serious. Please. Rick looks at me like I got three heads when I say something like that. Yes, Cheryl. Who wants to be that pale color? That's right. Who wants to be so uninteresting? I guess anybody that wants to work, but... On the other hand, to have a permatan is a great thing. I'm like every day. That's good. Congrats. You don't have to be white to hold down a job. I would be educated. Or to pull one. Cheryl, I'll prove how much we like you because there's a bunch of people that want a piece of you right now on the phone. Oh. And they could get a little ugly. Uh-oh. See, when we're saying some of this stuff, you can tell we're joking. So you're going to let me hang up now, right? Yeah, to prove that we do like you because these guys will rip you a new you-know-what. Oh, my God. All right. Let them go. Let them go. You married a white guy, so it kind of takes your argument away. Why does it take my argument away? I still have a black father. You aren't able to find a... I have a black father and a black brother. Where's your father? He works. Oh, really? He's with my family. They're together. Oh, okay. You actually know where your father is. I know who he is. All right. It's amazing. He's been married 30 years. Wow. Same person. And when's his release date? And he's been at the same company for 25. Yeah, that's called Rikers. No, come on. I'm teasing. It's not doing anything. You can think of Black People. We don't have normal black families. They're normal black families out there. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I understand. I understand, but I'm joking. I'm joking about the stereotypes that are out there in our society. You're not perpetuating it. I'm not perpetuating it. I'm commenting it. I'm joking. I'm saturizing them. Please, Sheryl. Don't you understand, but you married a white guy. You couldn't find a black guy that would give you everything that you could find in a man? I looked and I married the person I loved. Yeah, did you? I looked and I married the person I loved. But you're married. I looked and I married the person I loved. I looked and I married the person I loved. That's what I did. Is that so wrong? No, I'm just surprised with that. You married the person you loved and look at what happened to you. Maybe I should have gotten a black chick. You should have gotten a black chick. Hey, Cheryl, have you ever heard the trailer for the soul of Nigga Charlie? Don't you even dare. That is one of the best movies. You guys love saying nigger so much. Does it give you some type of superiority? Honestly, I think it's just a word. That's all I think of it as. The way you say it, it makes you feel superior. No, my God. You want to be a nigger? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Every black guy and girl now wants to say that they're part American Indian. To be honest, part white. My great grandfather is a white guy. Your great grandfather? Yeah. Was he like an Indian? No, he's white. He was the master. He was the master. He was the master? He was the master. Really? He was the master. Yeah, you're not claiming you're one of Thomas Jefferson's descendants like everybody else there. Thomas Jefferson would have had to bang for like 200 years to get as many descendants are claiming that Thomas Jefferson's kids now. Oh, really? Yeah. But no, so the Massa went into one of the slaves quarters and banged and then that was one of your relatives, one of your ancestors. Yeah, but you know what? You'd be very surprised at this master. He left my grandfather 2,000 acres of land. Really? Against all the things that the white man said, he still left in that land. Until this day, my family still has it. See, whitey ain't that bad. Well, my great grandfather was that guy. So, the master decided to get behind one of the women picking cotton and go to town. He knew good stuff when he got it. That's what the Master did. So it's the land that... He knew we did it. What are they doing with the land now? We farm it. Yeah? Cotton? No. Yeah, and once the Blacks are on it's like, you're damn right we're not growing cotton on this. I don't care what grows here. It ain't going to be cotton. Anything but. You're damn right about that. It won't be cotton. Well, sure, you want to talk to some of these people or what? Sure, go ahead. You sure? You're a lot of fun. We learn a lot about Black people and stuff on this show because we don't know. I know Earl isn't helping the situation. No, Earl's whiter than us. I think we've turned you around. I think you like us now. I like you guys. Just try to be a little more respectful. We're trying. Mike, what's going on? Oh, hey, what's up? You're on with Cheryl, our new friend here. Hi, Michael. How are you? Hi, how are you? I'm fine. I have a dilemma. I have a lot of Black friends. I'm many. I have no problem going down south, but if I talk to the guys at work, they will not reciprocate on a woman. I don't do that. What do you mean? How far do you have to know her? You've got to know her. You don't just go down. Know her? Three or four dates. Say if she gave you a hummer. Say if it's Avis and Andy on the phone. Would you reciprocate, ONA? Yeah, why not? Yeah, why not? See, I told you. I've got to know her. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her. I'm going to tell her. I told you. I've got a black fellow right in front of me now. He won't know it. All right. Let's put him on the phone. Hold on. Here he is. That's one of the stereotypes. Is that the black guys do not like going south? I have never dated a black guy who didn't like to do that. Exactly. You must be hot. Hey, guys. Hey, what's your name? I'm Dave. Hey, Dave. Hi, Dave. How are you? Hey, how are you doing? Dave, why don't black guys like going south? No, that's just a stereotype. That is not true. What I was saying to my partner here is that when you meet a woman and you go out for a few days, he's saying, oh, she's going to give you a hummer. Wouldn't you do the same? So I was saying to him, no. You've got to know somebody for a while to do that type of thing. That's where I agree with Dave. You don't want to just come out the box sucking on somebody's stuff. Exactly. You don't have to get to know them. Exactly. He agrees with me, too. If she gives you a hummer, you're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to get a hummer. You're not going to reciprocate. No, not right there and there. No, you've got to know her. But you know what, Dave? She's going in good faith. Dave, she's giving you some. Dave, I think that if I gave you a hummer, you'd reciprocate. Oh, excuse me. I don't think you'd have a problem. All righty, Dave. Yeah. She'll take you down to her plantation. See, we had to go there, right? Why? Well, I know you have a plantation down south. It's a farm. It's a plantation. You call it what you want. You want a plantation. You want a plantation. You want a plantation. You want a plantation. You want a plantation. You're probably looking for darker blacks than you to work it, right? As a matter of fact, we only allow white people to farm. Oh, really? Yeah. I like to work there. They work better than the black people. Oh, my God. Thank you. Hold on. Okay, thank you, guys. All right, hold on. It took me a second. The white people work better than the... Are you kidding me? You didn't just say that, did you, Cheryl? The white people work longer. We make the blacks the managers and the white people do all the labor. Wow, a little retribution there. No, they just work harder. Hey, Tim, you're on the line with Cheryl. All right, Tim. Unbelievable. I know why you married a white guy. Okay. Once you go white, you never go tight. That's true. It's often so small that it lets me tighten up those keloid muscles to get a good grip on it. Yeah. John, what's going on? Listen, I just want to know if I was going to do some black type of foreplay. Yeah. You're going to say, wake up, bitch? No, you know what you'd have to do? You'd have to maybe rub my babies a little bit. Oh, man. Get mixed all day. All right, I don't want to mess my car. All right, look, I'm driving with no hands. And then I'd probably lean down and maybe put my tongue in your navel and tickle your belly a little bit. You got to steal your wallet. You can handle my vanilla thunder? Your vanilla thunder. Jesus. Cheryl, you're a real good sport, guys. I think you should buy her a lifetime supply of cheese doodles. All right. Just reinforcing the stereotypes. Well, that's a little dry. You need something to wash it down with. How about a case of grape soda? Grape soda? So where are the hog moths and chitlins in the college? Don't get those stereotypes out there like that. Yeah, that's just wrong. I would like to apologize for that last comment. Mike Tyson. You sound like a wonderful African woman that I would love to get with. I am a woman of color. I'm not African. Oh, a woman of color. Whatever. You're going to be another color. Black and bold. Not all black women, all black men hit women. That is a stereotype. No, just me. I am Mike Tyson. I would like to actually maybe give you a couple of rabbit punches in the rectum, if I may. I'd have to shoot you. I'd have to shoot you. Just don't press charges. I don't care what you do. I am Mike the Tinker Bullet. That ping-pong was a pussy. He fell off the bird and had a couple of planes shot him. I am Mike the B swinging up there. I could take everything. Oh, God. I'm going to kick your ass, too. You'll like it. Oh, I might like it. Will it make it hurt good? You won't even know. You'll be unconscious, bitch. The work of Opie and Anthony. That doesn't sound so bad. Sucks, man, from wall to wall. 1027 WNEW. Good news, everyone. It's the work of Opie and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. Opie and Anthony. Hey. Hey. Just some feedback. Very important message from Yopolu in Garfield, New Jersey. My wife Laura is in the car now listening to you guys. Could you please tell her the ribs will be ready at 6? Thanks. The ribs? Hell, are we a messaging service over here? Excuse me. We'll just put the show on hold. Laura? Laura? Ribs will be ready at 6. Wait. Could you stop off and get some milk? This guy on the line says in high school, a teacher let them make whiskey in chemistry class. Nick? Yeah? What's up, man? In high school. We went through the same thing that you went through with being bored about chemistry and all this other crap. So what we did was we produced sour mash whiskey as a chemistry experiment in the class. Wow. How old were you guys? What were we? 11th grade. Really? 16, 15. Did you taste it? No. He kept it on the locking key. He'd go out so we could chart the chemical reactions and the changes. Then after we were done it mysteriously disappeared. Of course it did. Wow. That's pretty cool. It kept us interested in chemistry. We went on to other chemistry experiments but we didn't get graded for those. But this one we got the A on. I don't think I got graded for anything in school. I remember in shop class. I had to do anything to just get a grade. My teacher at the time was like, Anthony, do anything and I will grade you on it. I don't care what it is. You just have to do something. I think it was a bulletproof birdhouse. I just took some heavy 20 gauge sheet metal and spot welded it together and drilled a hole in it. I went, there you go, wow. Birdhouse. He graded me on it. Did it make the stupid metal funnel? No. In wood shop I made a pipe so I could smoke hashish out of it, which was good. But I said I was making a duck sculpture and that was the head. Very good. This is the head of my duck sculpture I'm making. So I drilled the hole for the bowl and the other part in the bill so it looked like a duck head. I would suck out of the bill. Did you get it? For some reason I never had to make the body. That's awesome. It was a waste in school. Just a waste. All right. I was going to tell the home ec story but what? You took home ec? Fag! Shut up. Did you wear a little apron? It was a waste. We're going to make hotcakes today with our own homemade syrup. We're going to make maple syrup out of sugar and water and you boil it down. That was where we went when we cut out a shop to see what the chicks were doing. Never remember coming across Opie with the little apron. Did you have your own oven mitt so you didn't burn your little fingies? It just blows when you put your foot in your mouth. What did you make? Did you take the sewing part too? Did you have to sew? We made like desserts. Today we're going to make a shirt with a pattern. You made dessert? That's cute. Can I explain? Ah, this story is adorable. I was in seventh grade. Are you going to blame me for something that happened in seventh grade? I think I was making a rifle rack in wood shop. Come on. Home ec. What are you doing? I don't know. I thought it was a cool way to get free food during the day. Free food? We made stupid stuff. Cookies and pies. I'll tell you a way to get free cigarettes in jail too. You're an ass. What an idiot. Home ec. All right. Food homo. Come on. I understand home ec is a very important word. The story is not that good. Go ahead. Tell me your home ec story. Because that was stupid. But we had to make pizza. Really? And all the burnouts. I wasn't the only guy in there. There were a bunch of burnouts. We were going through. And all the burnouts instead of putting the oregano on the pizza. And the whole place was like wafting. It's not a good story anymore because you just abused me for ten minutes. Why? I thought you were going to try to use the excuse. No, it was a great place to meet girls. No, I was in seventh grade. I didn't know any better. Home ec. Ouch. Oh, Anthony, you're perfect. I never took home ec. Well, just the thought of that was like why would I want to take a cooking thing? Because you got to eat the stuff. That's all it was about. You could hang out by the classroom and have the girls make this stuff for you. And get it from them. Everyone's shaking their head, yeah. Not in there. You know who? Opie, did you bake some brownies today? I'm done. Yeah, cool. I'm done for the day. We're in a wood shop shoving brad nails into people's arms. I'm done for the day. All right. Done. Take care of that egg too. Shut up. Your mic's down. Yeah. Make sure you don't break the egg. Treat this like a child. Yeah, that's going to be a hard one to live down. Yeah, this one's going to come back to haunt you for a while. Home ec. I was just home ec. I was just trying to share with everyone. I just wanted to share about my baked brownies. No, that's actually it does. It reminds me of a similar story that I had. Come on. Yeah, using the table saw and chopping. Yeah, that's just like home ec. Thanks. Yeah. You might actually burn yourself and get a blister. That's almost like chopping your hand off on the table saw. I can't even defend myself. Yeah, syrup bubbling on the stove. Danger. Danger. Yeah. Yeah, that's almost the same as maybe a piece of wood flying apart on the lathe and taking your head off. Well, Camille Brumner was in the class. Camille Brumner? Who was he? No, she. Oh. She was the first girl in junior high to like sport buds. Really? Yeah, that was a little awkward. I remember a chick in sixth grade, Cuba Hill Elementary School. Jerry, I think her name was. And she was the first one. She was huge. Really? And she had these big cans, woman cans in sixth grade. And guys, you know, would you get dopey in sixth grade? Like, look at you, you got boobs. And then you went on summer vacation, came back in seventh grade. Like, hey, Jerry, what's up? What's up? You want to go roller skating? Yeah. Because they come back, roll the ring. She had like the first buds though, man. We all just stared at her. Yeah. Awkward for girls. She was way ahead of her time. But those, really? Did she help you tie on your apron? Shut up. What was your pickup line? Could I bake you something? Shut up. You're an ass. What an idiot. Oh, man. All right. Food homo. Aw, come on. Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot. Aw, come on, mom. Don't bang open. You f*** my mom, I'm f***ing yours. Oh, kissing. I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a hell of a debonair ride. O.B. and accident. A couple of real motherf***ers. 1027 WMAW.

No, thank you. I don't know. You know what you're going to have to do? What? How long ago was this? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Are you getting any better? No. Uh-huh. You cut off all contact with her? No, I can't. I can't do that. Yeah, I see. So what, you keep calling her? Yeah, I do. I can't do that. I know. She's going to start thinking you're pathetic. I know, dude. You want to get her on the line and see what the problem is? She's probably out with her friends or out with this guy. She's probably getting, you know, oh, don't dig it in, Olfie. Come on, man. What are you doing, man? The thought of that is like turning this guy's stomach. It is. What do you think is going on right now with her? Right now? What do I think she's doing? Yeah, what position do you think she's in? Oh, dude. Oh, stop it. You're killing the guy. Come on. You're killing the guy. Come on, bro. Bobby, it happens to the best of us. I know, dude. Olf, you don't want to hear it, though. It has happened to every guy alive. But I love them. Oh, come on, Bobby. Yeah, no, this guy, come on, man. You've all been here. Don't harass the poor guy. Do you think she's getting the jackhammer, like the guy's drilling for the oil or something? Bro, come on, man. What are you doing? Oh, no. What are you doing? I'm already hurting myself. We're just trying to make you laugh. I know. That's terrible. She was really good at sex, too, huh? She was great. Yeah. How long did you go out with her? Three years. How did she look? She was beautiful. She still is beautiful. How old is she? She is 20. 20? 20, huh? How long did it take for her to give it up? I don't want to say that over the radio. Were you the first guy she was with or something? Oh, no, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Was she the first girl you've been with? Bobby, all I want to know, is she kind of easy? Was she easy? I mean, within a week, what? Man, I'm not going to put it down because I know people that I know are listening to the show right now. Well, I'm just saying. No, he's still in that phase where there's hope of. Like, he still has that hope that they're going to get back together. Seriously. You will trash this girl like no one has ever been trashed.

It happened to all of us. A friend of mine. I was totally like taken with a girl. It was in high school and stuff. And just went with my friend. It was devastating. How could these freaking get people, you know? How could you do that to your friend, man? You want to smack them. All right, Bobby, the listeners are coming through with some advice for you here.

Yeah, but she looked like it, dude. She kind of looked like her. Yeah, she wanted to be her, even. That's what she looked like. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She looked like her. She kind of looked like her. Yeah, she wanted to be her, even. Did she used to dress up in the Tomb Raider outfits for you? She wanted to, but we never got around to that. See, you should have got around to it. I bet you with your friend, you know, they're up to level eight. And they're treating you like those little monkeys. Alex, what do you have for Bobby? Yo, this guy is the biggest wuss I've ever heard. Come on, man. Man. You're sitting here practically crying to open an interview. No, I'm not crying, bro. You pick my girlfriend up with me. I ain't crying, man. Yo, look, man. You know how many girls there are in this world? Go out and find a new broad. Go out. Don't sit in your house and cry and smoke over it. I'm not crying, man. I go out all the time. And how would you feel if this? Why would you keep on sweating her like calling her up every day? You know, she's just going to think... She's just going to think you're more of a loser, and she's going to not want to have She's going to not want to hang out with you even more. The guy just was in love with the girl. What can he say, you know? Really, dude? It's not... You can't just shut it off, dude. The guy... The girl was doing your best friend or whatever. I don't know if she's doing it. I don't want to think about it. Oh, no, dude. I know you don't want to think about it, but, dude, you know something? Yeah, but let's look at the reality. You need reality. With your best friend or whatever. And, you know, why would you want to go back to that? You can't trust a girl. She's obviously a waste. Finds herself a good girl. Yeah, you know, he makes a good point there. Man, that's a rough situation for Bobby. It sucks. And then the thoughts just go through your head of everything you've done with the girl. And then you're just picturing your pal doing it. And it's just... That is awful, man. You know what's worse than that? When you see your pal with the girl out on town or something, you run into him. Well, then you just leave. Yeah, but you still get that feeling deep inside like, oh, this sucks. You just got to find another girl, I guess, and kind of see what happens. Well, we still have Bobby on the line here, Ant. We're still trying to get your friend on the line to find out if he's banging your ex-girlfriend. He's probably working anyway, dude. Well, I'll tell you the truth. He's not answering his cell phone, which that's bad news. That's bad news. He's probably in the middle of the act right now. Come on, man. He's the guy alone, man. What are you doing? I'm just telling you how it is. When you have a cell phone, why wouldn't you be answering it? Maybe he's working, man. All right? Maybe he's working. Ant, what do you got over there? Dave D. from Manhattan has a little advice for you. So this guy Bobby needs to get over it. At least his girlfriend left for another guy. Mine left because she wanted to be with a woman. This is true. After three years, she decided she wasn't happy and somehow a bearded clam would fix everything. See, Bobby, it could be worse out there. I guess so. There's always someone in a worse situation than you. You've got to remember that. Kathy? Yes? You're on the line with Bobby. Listen, I just want to say one thing. I was dating this guy for like six months and I really loved him so much. I thought he was the one. And I met his friend and it was just instant love. I thought I knew love. I didn't know love until I met his friend and we ended up getting married. That's not helping me, guys. Come on. All right, let me try to help Bobby here. Kathy, so when you started dating the friend, was the sex better too? Come on. Bring the bell. At first I didn't think so but it ended up the love overtook me. I don't want to hear that, guys. I don't want to hear that. Hey Bobby, did she do everything for you? Yes. God, those are hard to find. Did she give you the rusty trombone? I'm not going to get too into it, man, because I don't want to trash her name and have a lawsuit on me. All right, I think we have one more person to give advice to you, Bobby. All right. Old Danny! How's it going? We've got to help the youngster out here. All right, you're on the line with Bobby. Yo, Bobby. Welcome through this. Dude, what? Yo, K Pasta, man. This dude, this guy was your homeboy? He was your boy? What's up? I grew up with this kid. What? I grew up, I've known him since I was eight years old. Like that? And homeboy cuts your throat like that, son? He lived around the corner. Damn, dude. Yo, you got to listen to me, my brother. Bros before hoes. How's this brother going to do this to you? Yo, B, you got to start lifting some weights, kid. I do, yo. I'm going to do it. I'm telling you, B, you better tell this kid what time it is, son. You got to get this kid to respect you, B. He just respected you right there. You know what I'm saying? He could have stepped up to you and said, yo, I'm going to hit that. Do you mind? All right, man, that's all good. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? I could understand that. Because I asked my boy if I could hit his girl. He said it was all right. But if he would have said no, I wouldn't have done it. You know what I'm saying? I wouldn't have distracted him like that. Why are you guys laughing, man? Your advice is classic, man. Hey, old dirty, you think his friend threw a tray up into that piece yet or what? Yo, I'm about to throw a tray up in that piece too, B. No, I'm kidding. Throw a tray up in that piece. So don't you think Bobby needs to just get out there and start dancing? Yeah, B, yo. This mad skin's out there, homie. How old are you? I'm 23. Yo, bro, you a youngster. You got your whole life ahead of you, son. I'm telling you, B. Yo, but you better go bust that kid's ass. I'm not going to do that, bro. Why not, man? I have a good job right now. Where you work, yo? Where you working at, son? I work in the post office. Post? What are my freaking mails late? You work in the post office? Yep. Yo, so what? You ain't eating, you can't sleep, all that? You got all the symptoms of heartbrokenness? Seriously. Yo, crack a 40, son. How old are you, B? Dr. O.D., prescribing a 40. Yes, O.E., and call me in the morning. The doctor of love on the phone. You still talking to the chick? I call her all the time, man. Why you calling her? What does she say? Without music. What does she say to you when you call her? Don't call me no more. Yes, sometimes I get that. Yo, you know, yo, yo, do. Get over that, yo, but yo, crack a 40, son. Alright, old Dirty. Alright, brothers, have a good show. Alright, old Dirty, thank you. Sound advice from old Dirty. Yes, sir. Alright, Bobby. Thanks a lot, man. Peace out. Alright, Le. Later. Old Dirty's saying he's got to get over it, but in the meantime, he can medicate himself with a 40 to make him feel a little better during the time, the few weeks where you're really going to be feeling bad. You know, sometimes that's just the best thing to do. Well, that's it. Really, yeah. What are some of those situations like getting fired from your job where you just have to start drinking? I don't care what it is. You've been drinking, Bobby? No, no. No? See, maybe you should just start drinking. Just throw back a couple to numb the pain a little bit. You're smoking doobies? Well. Yeah, a couple of bones and stuff. But then you get all bummed, right? Yeah. Sit there feeling bad for yourself on the couch and just feeling bad. The next time you see your ex-girlfriend, this will be playing. Oh, come on. What are you doing? No. What? Dude, come on. That's not cool. That's bad. Come on. You know what? Are songs like just killing you? Yeah, what was your song? What was your little song? We didn't really have a set song. No, but like every song is like a back-up. Yeah. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. That's awesome. I like that. That's awesome. I like that. That's awesome. I like that. That's awesome. I like that. That's awesome. That's awesome. It's awesome. This song is like a powder and stuff now. Oh, that's awesome. God, that feeling sucks, man. It does, man. I feel like complete crap, man. You're not alone. It happens to every, pretty much every single one of us. Got to. All right, Bobby, as we go to commercials here, we want to play a song for you. We'll play a song for you. Don't hurt me, guys. Why? We're not hurting you. All right, guys. We're just trying to get you over this. All right. I don't know if I trust you but I'll listen. Here it comes. Yeah, here it comes. You hear it, Bobby? Not yet. You hear it? I do hear it. Oh yeah. You'll find out. Everybody's high on consolation Remember this old classic? What are you doing? Just listen, it'll probably make you feel better. Put a little perspective on things. You guys trying to get me to break down or something? Yeah. Here we go. Remember your first date? Yeah. Yeah. Remember the whole three years? Yeah. Oh, there's your friend. Remember the feeling the first time you guys had sex? Yeah, I did. You feel good it was? I do. Best feeling ever, right? It was. Yeah, now she's gone. Now she's gone. Possibly doing your best friend. What are you doing for you guys? Terrible. I hate that. End it's on. It's like George C. Scott in the movie, Turn it Off! Turn it off! Hardcore. Is your friend a big black guy? No, he's not a big black guy. Thank God, yes. Hi Bobby. Remember the first time you put a hand down in the front of your pants? Oh, come on. Remember that? Remember the first time you felt patch? Oh, come on. Just asking. We're just asking if you remember these things. Of course I remember these things. You alright Bobby? I'm alright. Remember the feeling when you just kissed her? Nothing better in the world, right? Yeah, it really was. Never wanted to look at another girl. Never did. Never did. Oh man. What's wrong Bobby? Maybe this is the wrong song to try to cheer him up. I think it is. You sure? Alright Bobby, this song's almost over here. It's not going to break me down. Except for the big part right here. Yeah, this is always good. This is the killer. What? People would just let me through. What are you talking about? We're just trying to get you over this with a little humor. I know. The listeners are suggesting songs for you Bobby. Oh no. Are you going to hurt me now? No. Remember this one? Classic song. By the cars. Okay. Might remember this. All the dancing's got to speed. This wave through ice. She got blue eyes Bobby. Yeah, she did. Oh damn. What's wrong Bobby? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Oh damn. Alright, this is my best friend's girl. Yeah, my best friend's girl. Come on. Did you like the way she kicked? I liked everything about her man. There it is. Here comes a line that hurts. Hey, open your ears to me. This is the worst of Opie and Anthony. 107WAW. Well, what's up Anthony? Hey man. It's the O&A show. Yes it is. It's a great day Anthony. You want to talk about Clinton real fast? This is great. Oh my God. I'll read this one. Clinton finds screensaver amazing. I love this. This is the leader of the free world, right Anthony? Yeah. Okay, President Clinton who likes to play up his fascination with computers while playing down his experience was dazzled on Tuesday by a basic display of software. A screensaver. A screensaver. He was amazed by a screensaver ladies and gentlemen. There's a quote in here by Clinton saying, amazing. Amazing. He said, Clinton said, as watching a series of coffee cups, deer and a blackboard form and dissolve on a monitor during a visit to a computing class in a senior citizen center. Wow, amazing. Look at that. Look, it's like pipes and they're just making themselves go and I don't know where they're going and then they disappear. Amazing. He's amazed by a screensaver. By a screensaver. Yeah. This just goes to show you that these jerk-offs have the speech writers and everything and they're publicity people and they make their speeches about the internet. He's been talking internet and everything like he knows what he's talking about, computers. God doesn't have a clue. He's amazed by a screensaver. A screensaver. Amazing. Not by the Sims or some of the great computer games out there. No, nothing. He's amazed by a screensaver. Right. Oh my God. The low-key visit with about 30 participants in the class also got Clinton talking about computer games he used to play with his daughter Chelsea. They were Freddy's Rescue Roundup and the Carmen Sandiego series of educational games, Anthony. Just no porno. I like to punch up the pornography like Seagulls and stuff. I like that. Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? I played that one with Chelsea. Hillary played Where in the World is Bill's Penis. Unfortunately, she wasn't really doing very well at that game right up until about a year ago. Then she won. I love her. I'm playing some new games. Womb Raider. Womb Raider. A Gash Life. New one. First-person load shooter, they call it. And it also says Clinton does not use his office email that much, Anthony. What would he be doing? Hi, I'm 15. How old are you? Clinton in the chat rooms. That can be pretty funny. AOL's chubby chick chat room. I like this one. Do you like Seagulls? How much do you weigh? Would you like to intern for me, the president? That's ridiculous. Clinton finds screensaver. Amazing. Like magic. And I turned the monitor around and I don't see how they get those pictures in there. I'm amazed by the whole thing. Look, there's a picture of fire on the monitor but I don't feel any warmth. How they do that. Amazing. Yeah, suck it. Go ahead. I'm amazed by the screen. Suck it. Oh boy. You find these things out toward the end of any administration. The guy at the helm is a stark-graving lunatic. They've run out of things to talk about Anthony at this point so now they've got to dig deep. Yeah, well maybe he wasn't really paying attention to the computer on the monitor when Monica's ass was up there. I didn't really look at the screen save when I was looking at a big brown eye. That's amazing. Amazing. Look at that big brown eye. That's amazing, all right, Mr. Clinton. My God. What the hell? I was wondering what that was. A computer? Is that what it is? What does it do? What does that even do? Suck it. I got the brown eye screensaver. It's amazing. Opens and closes. It's great. Screensaver. Now why does it? What does it do to save the computer? We must all unite to save the screens. In fact, the whales needed our protection in the rainforest. I do now understand it's time to save the screens with these amazing screensavers. Thank you. Amazing by screensaver. Holy God. You almost cursed there. Oh my God. I'm amazed that he's amazing. I'm amazed that he's amazing. I'm amazed that he's amazing. I'm amazed that he's amazing. I'm amazed that he's amazing. Even Dragan probably. Yes, I know about screensavers. They don't amaze me. They amaze Clinton. Mr. 20th century, 21st century. Didn't Gore invent the internet? That's what he should know about us. That's what he claims, yes, Anthony. I want to know something. Did Clinton and Gore speak at all during eight years together as president and vice president? Have you ever seen them in the same room? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

God damn, there he is, the president that was talking about leading us into the 21st century, amazed by a screensaver. Not amazed by MP3 files or... No. Or Voodoo graphics cards. Or a Bic lighter. And you move your thumb and there's fire. No more banging rocks. I am amazed. Opie. Boy. Anthony. Boy. Producer Rick. Boy. Spaz. Yay, yay, yay. The Opie and Anthony Show. 1027. WNEW. And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony. 1027. WNEW. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap. I need a nap! It's Opie and Anthony. All right, Anthony. Wow. I'm exhausted, you're right. The oxygen is coming back into the room. Finally thought... Thought I had the energy enough to maybe relate last nights events to our audience. But I'm exhausted now. Oh, really? I think we can start. I think we can muster up a little energy. So, let's do this. We went to the Knicks game last night. his first professional basketball game, I think. No. First net game? Yes. Okay. Okay, I'll go that one. What was your first basketball game? I believe I saw Rick Barry and the New York Nets. At the Comac Arena? I don't know where that was. No, it might have been the Coliseum. It was probably the Coliseum by then. Wow, when Rick Barry was playing for the Nets. For the ABA with the red, white and blue ball. At the end of Rick Barry's career there. That was a while ago. I remember seeing some net games at the Coliseum. Definitely. Yeah, that was it. They did play at the Comac, whatever that place was. The roller rink. The roller rink over there, right? Where they have the flea market after that. Yeah, they started there and then... I think I saw Skinner there once. Yeah, with Molly Edge. Yes, I went to the next game. Scott Herman, our old boss, Opie and Rick. Watch the basketball game. I think you saw a total of five minutes of the game. I was star watching. I was celebrity watching. You know how that is. You've got to give your take on the guard because it was the first time you went. I'm sure being an observant human being, you've got some observations to throw at everyone. Basketball in general, I think it's no matter where they play it, it's a little weird because the audience, two feet from the foul lines, from the out of bounds lines, that's a little strange. I want to see that in baseball. Yeah, right. I want to see them just sit the crowd on the... and they're on the floor. It's not like they're stands or anything. They put folding chairs on the floor. They're right next to the players and coaches and everybody else just sitting on the floor. You're eating your nachos two feet from the action. Line up the people sitting to watch a baseball game right down the foul lines. That's what I want to see. Or right around the goal line in football. Just sitting there. Oh, line shot towards first base. That took out that old lady sitting there on the foul line. Or football. Put them right there. I find that a little weird. You could see a lot of the celebrities like that. They're just kind of sitting there courtside. Woody and Soon Ye were there. Woody just kind of sits there. Wait, before you get to the celebrity watch, which everyone does at the Garden, you've got to talk about cell phone guy and drunk guy behind us. You can add in some stuff. Obviously you were there. It's your first game so I'm trying to see what you took in. I was concentrating more on the basketball game and stuff. The other stuff you get at any sporting event. Last night we saw cell phone guy. He's two rows away from us standing up with his cell phone yelling, I'm over here, waving his hand. Over here, underneath the sign. Look right here. He's got his pal on the other end of the place on his cell phone. They're trying to point at us. They're like, yeah dude, yeah, we're into the game. Trying to pinpoint each other. Jackass, look I'm a tool. I'm a jerk off, look at me on the phone. Then who was sitting in front of us? Arm around the guy guy. We've discussed this. We don't like it. I was laughing. I was arm around the guy guy. I came back with the burger and a couple of beers. I go to get into our aisle and I look it over and go, oh, check it out. Arm around the guy guy. I pointed at the guy. It's arm around the guy guy. There's no homo activity going on. It's just some guys feel comfortable enough, I guess, with their own sexuality. I don't even know what it is where while they're talking to their buddy or someone they barely even know, they kind of put their arm around the other guy's seat like they're on a date. This guy had his arm around the guy, touching his shoulder, pulling him in as he's talking to him. You see that one? Arm around the guy guy right in front of us. I was just taken with all the celebrities there. That's what I was taken with. Woody, Sun Yeh, Woody just sits there. We had a problem watching the game because at one point I go, aunt, check it out. Tom Brokaw. Yeah. I swear, Tom Brokaw walking down the stands to his seats, pretty much courtside. He was about six, seven rows up. Yeah. Right in front of him was Star Jones. Before I even saw Tom Brokaw, I saw Star Jones who had to continuously fan herself with some kind of paper product because she was just sweating. She has got to be the fattest thing I've ever seen in my life. Huge. Oh my God. She's sitting absolutely courtside. She is on the court. Those seats at the garden are small enough. Can you imagine having Star Jones to your right? What a pain in the ass that's got to be for that person. Her supplies spent 20, 30 grand for those seats, maybe even more. I don't even know what courtside is. I can only dream. You get sat right next to Star Jones for all the home games? That's got to suck. Star Jones who was getting up, I guess, getting something to eat or sending her cronies to she would stand up and you would just see this huge ass just projecting itself onto the court. Amazing. Other celebrities looking. I saw Matt Dillon looking at Star Jones' ass with a face on him like, look at the size of that ass. Doesn't matter who you are. The whole arena. Yeah. You know, you forgot to mention one thing, the halftime activities. What was the halftime activities all about last night because everyone was laughing at this one lady. They put an image on the screen. I was distracted. What were they trying to do with that? They were like loving couples for Valentine's Day that had a little strife in their lives or something like that? They overcame through the love of each other. Yeah. They put the woman's picture up on the screen talking about how in love she is with her husband and everything. They had the husband first and everyone was really into the story like, oh wow, she's a special lady. And obviously the lady's there and they put her picture up on the screen and she's talking a bit of her professing her love. She was huge. Huge and the whole freaking garden starts laughing and she's there on the court waiting. She's there on the court waiting to come out to be reunited with her lover there. Like Jabba the Hutt. The hair. You heard a collective. Oh yeah. The funny thing was all the women who were seated around us hearing us go, oh my god, they're so mean. Oh, that's terrible. They're so mean. It was just so funny though because you just weren't expecting it. They're like, let's bring them out here on the court. It's like, oh my god, she's here. She saw like thousands of people at the garden just razz her. Let me ask Rick. Hey Rick, did you see the halftime festivities? No, actually I went out because I was hysterical laughing about Star. How come she has one of those own guys, you know, clean up the sweat off the floor with those balls? Yeah. How does she have her own guys when I sit by her seat and get up every five minutes? I was trying to watch the game. Yeah. Barman, come on. Yeah, then the guy comes out with that big huge janitor thin mop thing to wipe up the sweat on the star joke. I was waiting for the guy next to him to wave the smell away from him. But it's terrible. All right, Rick, thank you. Bye, guys. Yeah, sorry about that. I thought he had a comment about the halftime festivities. What are you laughing at? Oh, she interned for Star General. Do I talk to Louie? Yeah, let's hear. Louie! Yeah, he's the intern for that fat slob. Really? Yeah, every now and then I had to go out and pick up a big bell for that Saudi. Well people, she had people going out getting her stuff to eat. Let me tell you something. She eats a lot, that big heifer. She stinks like a gorilla. Oh my god. She wears a lot of perfume and always wafs. When you pass her, forget about it, man. It's stuck to you. She's a diva though, come on, Louie. I'm a diva? She's a diva. Divas don't smell. She's a diva, all right. I'm watching the basketball game. Give me some nachos and chicken wings and a couple of hamburgers and some french fries and some pizza. Give us every couple of tacos. The worst part is when they set up the buffet, like for the talent that comes in, as she calls it, the talent, you can't touch none of that stuff. But yeah, she's up for that bento, but hogging everything. We heard that too from somebody else last night. She's the worst. Saying that they were setting up a buffet and she was eating the cheese as fast as the people were laying it out. And don't touch the bagels. You touch the bagels, she freaks out. I need some nachos, some tacos and Coca-Cola. Give me Diet Coke with that, please. I'm watching my weight. Watching it grow by leaps and bounds. I'm a diva. And she had the good hair on too, I saw that. Yeah, she had a wig on. I would have loved to just seen somebody pull that wig off. Oh my God, would that be great. Monica! Hey! Hi, you were stuck in a steam room with Star Jones? I go to a spa here in New York. Yeah. And I go in the steam room with really beautiful tiles and everything. And this woman comes in, I didn't see who she was at first, and she takes her towel off and spreads out. And I realize it's Star Jones. Oh, it was horrible. I'm in a steam room. I'm like a big steam dumpling. Look at me. Oh, you must have been horrified. Did she have her hair on? I didn't see she had a towel on her head. Yeah, because I got to take my hair off. Too much steam builds up underneath there. Pops off like a champagne cork. I get hot. Yeah, poor Monica, you had to go through that, huh? I had to leave. Yeah, like a big oven stuffer roaster in a steam room. With my pop-up gut. Big fat. I got to fan myself. It's only 30 below. Building up some heat, burning off some of this fat. So we got distracted. Yeah, she was there. Yeah, that was very distracting. Well, then the time broke off, because if you're a fan of the show, I mean, you've heard Anthony do the time broke off over and over again. So Aunt Nye and Rick and our old boss, Scott Herman, were sitting there and Aunt is looking at Tom Brokaw and doing his voice and making comments about everything he sees going on around him. And we couldn't breathe. We almost forgot who won. Just even when he was just going into the aisle. Yeah. Pardon me, please. Tom Brokaw coming through, NBC Nightly News. Hello. Pardon me, please excuse me. I have the next seat down. I'm getting a little woozy trying to get to my seat. I don't want to feel over on anybody trying to enjoy the basketball game. Hello. Hello. Yes, yes, I'm sitting next to you. And other than Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. Oh, my God. Look at the size of star Jones. He's as big as the Achilles. Oh, she's coming this way. I don't want to have to say cancer there. Hello, star Jones. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. Shake hands. Hey, she's nibbling at my hand. That's not a chicken wing, you sow. Get off of me. All right. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. Hey, Tom, who else did you see at the game? I wasn't sure about this, but I found out that Dionne Warwick plays center for the Knicks. No, that's Patrick Ewing. Oh, it looks like Dionne Warwick. I was sure. Did you see me slip off to the bathroom with Bobby Brown to do some cocaine? No, what are you doing? I was doing blow with Bobby Brown. Well, Bobby Brown was... Wanging broads. What was at the game last night there with the Brokaw? But I don't think you went into the bathroom to do lines with Bobby. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. I also saw Woody and his chink suing me. Fascinating. Fascinating. Her and her horizontally slanted gash. Oh, here come the little Knick dancers. What do they call them? Knick City dancers. The Knick City sluts. I love them. Look, I have to sit here like I'm not watching, but I'm smuggling a bone in my pants. Did you see that, how he couldn't stand up? Everybody would stand up and look at the Knick City dancers. Of course. You know, you've got to check them out. And he wouldn't stand up. I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. I must remain calm. I don't want to get a boner. I'm terrified that Star Jones thinks I'm a foot long hot dog. That would be the last I see of that thing. Oh my God, Knick City, I'm going to pop a nut. They think they're all hot. The Knick City dancers, they're artistic. They're artists. They're not just dancers. They're Knick City dancers. Baby, you're one step away from sliding down the pole for a buck down the G-string. From me, Tom Brokaw. When I go to Flinch Dancers. NBC Nightly News. Oh, here comes that pig, Star Jones. No star. My hamburger. Away, you. Back. Somebody get me a cattle prod. I'm going to shock this bad ass. Back to your seats. Hey, Tom, you seem a little more outrageous than normal. I was very jubilant for the game last night. And I still had about an eight ball left from Bobby. And we were banging broads all night. Yeah. It was great. I'm sure I'll crash later when I have to do NBC Nightly News. Fascinating game, though. I love that L'Etrel-Fluel. What a player. Boy, it certainly looked like he should be behind a wall with measurements on it. My God. He looks like everyone you picture doing a drive-by. Doesn't he? Tom, you can't say that. A man looks like a criminal. You cannot say that. I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. I know criminals. I report them on a nightly basis. I swear to God, he looks like a criminal. He should just be in a lineup or something. Good about basketball. Oh, Tom. Oh, Christ. Sargeant, back again. Sargeant, back to your seats. You know, when I first saw her, I thought maybe the little halftime show was Shamu the Killer Whale. I realized it was that fat ass Sargeant. Oh, look. Here she goes, backing into her seat. I can't beep. No, that joke went the other way. I can't beep. Hey, Sargeant, sit down. You're blocking half of the course view. Wow. Well, yeah. Trust me, I'm Tom Brokaw at Laugh Your Balls, opening for kids' day. And I'll be playing Rascals in Ocean's Half. Aren't you opening up for Bobby Slayton this week? Yes, Tom Brokaw opening for Bobby Slayton. Slayton. Yeah. Rascals Friday and Saturday. I think I'm crashing. I'm going to call Bobby for another eight ball. Oh, look. My beeper's going off. That doesn't work ever. Hey, Rick, could you get a beeper sound on this? Sure, Mr. Mogan. Thank you. Well, Tom, thanks for stopping by. Tom Brokaw, everything. Here he goes. Tom Brokaw, everyone. It's the worst of opening in Anthony. So pay attention, asshole. 1027, WNEW. All right, guys, what's happening, man? It's a trick. Producer for the Open Anthony show.

Now, continuing on, we got this thing where Ann was talking about how, I guess if you don't know already, he's kind of going through a transitional period in his life, had to get some new clothes, couldn't get his old clothes, couldn't get his stuff. Well, just listen to the bit and you'll figure it out, okay? Today, you're stuck with the worst of OB and Anthony. 1027-WNEW. WNEW, it's O.P. and Anthony. Hey, look who stopped by to say hi today, Anthony. Hi, Bill. Cowbell Bill. Hi, Bill. Hey. Hasn't been on the show in a while? Yeah. Hey. Hey, Bill, you haven't seen your buddy Anthony in a while, or you think he's a little bit weird? Hey. Hey, Bill, you haven't seen your buddy Anthony in a while, or you're digging his new clothes? Oh, look at that. There must be somebody living your life. Bill, at least there's new clothes, because I can't get my old ones. Yo, she took everything, man. The clothes are gone. God. I took one little batch of clothing. That was it, your computer and ran? Yeah, like my computer and a few clothes and stuff. I thought I'd be able to go back and get the rest of my clothing. No. Well, the phone rang today in the office. Uh-oh. Rick picks it up. Do I ever pick up my effing telephone in the office? Ever, ever, ever. Never, ever, ever. Do I ever? I mean, we're in meetings. The phone's ringing. I'm like, I don't care. I'm not picking up the phone. I don't pick it up. Why did I pick up the phone? What would we expect? Because you thought it was the Hard Rock calling back to bring us our lunch or something. But why would they have my phone number? Because I gave them the extension. Why did you give them my extension? Because you're on all these extensions doing an interview. I explain this to you. Regardless of how it happened, I never answered the phone. Rick answered the phone. He goes, oops, I guess I shouldn't answer that. So now I pick the phone up. It's the Future X. Oops. And what you're going to get, you know, talking about a couple of finances and things like that, you know? Some issues. Sure. Some issues. Sure. So I bring up the point that I'd like to come by maybe and get the rest of my clothes at some point. Oh, thank you. It's going to be hard to get all the rest of my clothes. Yeah. It seems that, it seems they somehow made their way to goodwill. Our own Ziggy that we had on the show is probably wearing some of my shirts. I can get some clothes. Yeah. It seems my clothes are bagged up and shipped out. Great. To goodwill. We could at least auction them off on the show. Yeah. Defense fund. You can believe it. It's like, oh yeah, come by and get some of my clothes. Oh, clothes? Yeah. It seems the clothing is not an issue anymore. Don't feel bad. I had a friend of mine show up at a club one night wearing his work boots covered with tar, dress slacks, and the vest for the dress slacks. No shirt. I look at him. I look at him. I go, Chip, what happened? Yo, Billy, man, she took everything. Just the vest, just pants and crap, and crusted boots. She took everything. Big ass hairy chest. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. She took everything. Big ass hairy chest, we had the vest on, hang out. He had to go down to the bar. He had nowhere to go. With the vest on! This work, man. It isn't good. Yo, Billy, man. How'd I look? Chicken shit, man. Yo, Billy, man. Yo, Billy, man. The best part of this story, Annie went back to his place. We've talked about it in the air. like we can bring it up again. Yeah, I had to get my computer equipment. But see, at that point you had a chance to get your clothes. It just shows you how much you really liked your computer. Well, I only had a limited time. Because at that point... A limited window of opportunity. Speaking of that window of opportunity, how did you get in there? Through the window of opportunity. Well, yeah, I was thinking in my head, based on previous things that had happened, I won't go into any details. I was under the assumption that if I went and knocked on the door and she was home, that I wouldn't have been able to get in to get my computer equipment. So I opted to take the other chance, which is to just let myself in, let's say, to the house that I was paying rent on anyway. Can you picture that? That was me. Isn't that that faint radio guy's butt hanging out there? I was hanging down from cables through the roof, trying not to set off the floor alarm. I was hovering over it and a little bead of sweat fell off my forehead and almost hit the floor. It landed on my arm, I think. Here's the computer equipment. Let me just pop the disc out. I've got to get my porn. God knows what kind of trouble that can make for me in a court of law. Yeah, I wasn't concerned more with my computer equipment than what was on that hard drive. Can I reformat this thing? That'd sink me for sure. Yes, must reformat hard drive. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I'm going to have to get my computer equipment. I reclaimed my computer equipment. All that was over there that I figured I would go by at some point and pick up was my clothes, which, good will. I still don't know the fate of my radio controlled helicopter. Something tells me, yeah, same fate as the old NBC traffic chopper. Same fare just as well as Stevie Ray's chopper, I do believe. What about that great mountain bike we got? No, I got that. You got that? I got that when I went to get my computer. I strapped that to the roof. Yeah, that's how I made my getaway on the mountain bike. I asked Rick to borrow his mountain biking pants and I strapped everything to my back. Well, look at the bright side. There's some poor, unfortunate kid with a brand new helicopter. Brand new helicopter flying around with an FN Talk at 1027 t-shirt. Jesus Christ. We just have a new contest. Spot Anthony's clothes on the street. If you find any of my clothing, yeah, let me know. It would be some, let's see, WAAF Boston shirts. That might turn up. Some E.W. stuff. Some beer and liquor t-shirts. Plenty of Budweiser clothing. Oh, I got my golf clubs too there, Bill. We could still play some golf. I love your priorities. It's great. Computer, mountain bike. Toys. Right. The clothing was just like an afterthought of what I threw on top of the golf clubs. Well, that's very funny, Anthony. Tragic but funny. Well, you know, it's life, I'll bet. You're left with more than I am, Anthony. Corky Anthony. What were you saying, Bill? Yeah, Bill. You're left with more than I did. Yeah. Bill kind of went through a situation. It happened to be summer. It happened to be summer. All I had was shorts and a t-shirt. And you got, Bill, wiped out. Everything wiped out. Can you retell the story? That's one of the funniest stories ever. Cute Bill story. You know, I had a story about how a couple of weeks ago my love life hit rock bottom. You want me to tell this story on top of that story? A couple of weeks ago something happened. Yeah. Your love life hit rock bottom? Look, he's all... Look at his face. What happened? It's embarrassing. I didn't hear about this one. It's pretty embarrassing. What happened? It's... Well, there's two stories in one, actually. I'm at the local watering hole, Peppers. Sure. And Friday afternoon, happy hour, I usually hang for a couple hours and I go home. That was the deal. I was ready to go home, in walks the nerdiest looking guy you've ever seen in your life. I'm talking crew cut, Coke bottle glasses, you know, the pencils in his top pocket. Fitts Town orders eight shots. This guy isn't with anybody. Bangs, all eight shots. Tequila, I think. So I said, you know, I've got to hang out and watch this. You wanted to go home. You know, I mean, talk about out of his element. You picture the front row at a Rolling Stones concert. 1969, the cameras panning across the front row. Bikers, hippies, and all of a sudden there's Pee Wee Herman. That's where this guy. So he looks at me and he goes, hey, you want to do a Dr. Pepper? I'm like, what the hell is that? You drop a shot in a Guinness or whatever. That's a Huntington drink, isn't it? All the way there. So, you know, I did one. I'm like, you know, that's not bad. I'm like, OK. And I'm banging him. I'm like, this is pretty good. The last thing I remember was saying, I don't think I should drive home. All right? That was the last thing I remember. I woke up Saturday morning. Now, you know how water beds work? Yeah. Water displacement, buoyancy. Sure. Normally, my alarm clock is right at eye level. I wake up, I'm like, why am I looking down at my alarm clock? Uh-oh. Yeah. That meant somebody was on the other side pushing down on that bed, thus lifting you up a little more than you're used to. 270 pounds worth. Oh, my God. Where did you find that? What the hell? You don't even remember? No. No. The last thing I remember was saying, I think I should get a ride home. And you ended up with a chick that was 270 pounds? At least. Were you hypnotized? At least. I was hypnotized. Oh, my God. Now, I got up and I said, you got to go. You have to get up. Before any of my pals come over here. I never let it down. Oh, it's too late now. You know, I went back to the hotel and I was like, OK. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I went back to the bar the next day to get my car. The whole place was looking at me like, are you nuts? I mean, you know. But yeah. Phil's nailed some pretty quality tail in his day, too. Like, it's his reputation. He walks out with a heifer. It's like, whoa. He's slumming tonight. I think that heifer carried me out. Put me in her back pocket and took me home. Oh, man. So anyway, I said, they said, you know, the guy that was buying you those Dr. Peppers, I said, yeah. They said the paramedics had to show up, took him out on a stretcher. That's a good night. You're the lucky one. Yeah, all time low. All time low. That's a good story, too. You've been better off on the stretcher. Yeah, I know. I would have been. Too funny. Phil, you're going to tell the other story a lot. You've told it before, but it's just, it's a killer. Well, you know, I'm working my butt off. You know, I'm sending my wife to school to become an RN, paying for the house. And she finally gets a job as an RN. I can't look. Starts banging the doctor. Oh, man. Oh, they still want to swallow. Yeah. Turns out to be my best friend's second cousin. Yeah. So, you know, I said to him, I'm like, I'm going to go to the doctor. So, you know, I said to him, I'm like, hey, you know, what's the deal with this guy? He's like, oh, he bangs all the nurses. Just give it up. Yeah. Great. Great. So I basically, you know, got booted out of the house, took everything, left me with nothing. And, you know, my mother's saying, well, don't worry, honey. What goes around comes around. I'm like, yeah, my right. You know, there's no way this is ever going to even out. Couple of years later, I hear from my best friend that the guy gets in an accident with his Jaguar, bites off his tongue, and they can't find it. I'll show you that. Give him a jingle. You called him up. I called him up. Remember me? Wow. I asked my wife, how's that feel? He's giving you a little stub. That doesn't sound so bad. Sex man from wall to wall. Hello, Lamb Chop. Thanks, man. Thanks, man. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? I thought you liked Sherry Lewis. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I want to rub there, you know what. Guess what I got. Guess what, we're playing Guess What I Got in My Pants today. Brand new game. Brand new game on the O&S show. I'm going to transvestite the girl up. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Rub, rub, clang. And we're going to get Buddy Hackett on the line to help us out. He's going to bet all the way from L.A. My father's college roommate was at the second show Sunday, Rascals. Yeah. And he showed me pictures of my father in college and he goes, you know Buddy Hackett, like how you were, you were like completely starstruck. Yeah, because I love Buddy Hackett. Well, this guy's like Buddy's age and loves him, you know. And he goes, I remember I was drunk coming out of the Waldorf Astoria and a cab was in front of me so I punched the cab and I heard a voice that said, what do you hit a cab for, you just going to hurt your hand? And I look up and it's Buddy Hackett. And I asked for his autograph, blah, blah, blah, and I go, well let's call him right now. And the guy's face goes white and I put Buddy on speakerphone. I go, Buddy, you're never going to guess who I have here. He goes, let me guess. I go, you're never going to guess. He goes, is it a man or a woman? I go, it's a man. He goes, well, you're never going to guess. He goes, well then who is it? I go, it's my father's college roommate. He goes, oh, you mean Al. Do you remember? No, he made it, I just bought it. And then I put him on the phone with the guy for like five minutes and then he hangs up the phone and he gives me the phone. But Buddy goes, Jay? I go, yeah, he goes, that's not him. He was taller. Buddy Hackett. What are you doing with them Opie and Anthony guys? Hey Buddy, what's up? It's Jay. Yeah, I know. You're on the air. How's everything in Mayberry, Opie? All right, Buddy, come on. He never heard that one before. That's the first time, Buddy. Yeah, you know, Andy Griffith was a good friend of mine. What happened? He's still alive, right? Well, he started to get fat. There's no sense two fat guys hanging out together. Hey Buddy, you're going to love what we hooked up today for you. What do you got? We got girls on the phone that are rubbing the receiver end, the speaking end of their phone on their crotches and we're playing a game and we're all guessing if they're shaved into a mohawk, a triangle or a Hitler Mustang. Never mind that, I like to sell them new underwear. What? He sees a business opportunity. Well, he's a crafty man to hack it. How are you, Bud? I'm all right. We sure did. The joke you gave me killed every show you Buddy for this. I got another one for you. All right. You ready? Yeah. Wait. Okay. Yeah. A guy said to his friend he's going to Majorca. He said, do you speak Spanish? He said, no. He said, just speak very, very slowly. They'll think you speak in Spanish. He said to the clerk, I want a room. The clerk, would you like a view? The tourist, yes. The tourist, where are you from? The clerk, Ohio. The tourist, do you speak English? The clerk, yes, I do. The tourist, then why are we speaking Spanish? Ladies and gentlemen of New York, New Jersey and Philly, Buddy Hackett, my friend. Are you going to tell that tonight? I don't have a show tonight. I'm resting my voice by going on the radio for two hours. Yeah, well. I'll tell it in Boston. I'm up in Boston next. What place? The Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall. Oh, Faneuil Hall, yes. That used to be a good place to eat years ago. It still is. It still is, yeah. They redid the whole place. I was there for four months in 1946. That's when you met Brando, right? Yeah, me and Brando hanged out. He was at the Plymouth Theater. He told Tallulah, not Tallulah. They told, oh, I forget her name. What, did you have a stroke? What happened? Yeah, yeah, it was Tallulah. Oh, okay. Oh, tell that story. That's a great one. Tallulah Bankhead. Tallulah Bankhead. He said, you have the worst breath. And that night he was replaced by an actor named Helmut Dantien. And I said, as it could, he learned a part on the train coming up. They called him, while the show was still on, they called him. They took a train up from New York and played the evening performance. Marlon started hanging out at my place, going with a girl named Gina Belkin. And they were doing all sorts of naughty stuff. So he got fired for telling the story that she had bad breath on stage. Well, she got rid of him somehow. Wow. Hey, look at me. I got fired last week just for telling them a funny line to put in the show. Well, for the listeners, Buddy Hackett was to appear on King of Queens. And Buddy showed up Monday and had some great ideas. Thought maybe his character should speak in Yiddish with subtitles. No, no, I didn't tell them that. I'm just telling you what I heard, Buddy. Well, I told them that on the phone. When I first got the job, I told the agent. The agent called them. They called me and said they don't even want to hear that. So I just had lived a couple of jokes in English. And then... Well, why didn't they want you on the show? I think that would have been a pretty big outrage. Well, what they said was, their reason was that I was intimidating because my persona was too big for the part. I said, how about my ass? I think that's what did it. Hey, so Buddy, you want to play What's in Your Pants? You want to guess how these go? Oh, sure. Is that one of the triangle mohawk or what? Or Hitler mustache. A Hitler mustache. Let's start. I would like to meet a girl that wears her muff in a Hitler mustache. Yeah, huh? Yes. She wears her muff. And you just yell, Hile hump. Hey, Lynn. This is the best radio there's ever been. We got Buddy Hacking 3000 miles away guessing Bush. How are you, Lynn? I'm all right. This is Linda. Oh, Linda, I'm sorry. Hi, Linda. You're on the air. Hello, Linda. Hi, Linda. Hi, Buddy. What city are you in? Oh, I'm not in this city. I'm in Jersey. Jersey. That's what I'm asking you. Which city in Jersey? Jersey has no cities. Yeah, I used to be a cop in Fort Lee. Oh, well, don't make a mad... Don't make a mad, you'll fall out of a window. Oh, God. All right. Well, Lynn, are your pants off? Oh, of course. And you got the phone? Oh, yes. All right. You got to rub pretty hard so we can hear it through the phone, okay? Pretty hard. Oh, it's like Jimmy Valentine. Can I think of J. Moore while I'm doing it? Oh, yes. Oh, he's so hot. You just got hotter. Can you tell Buddy Hackett how hot he is as well, please? Buddy Hackett, you are just incredibly hot. I would love to take your skin, unwrinkle it, and lick every inch of it. Could we make that retroactive about 53 years so I can hear it? All right. The big... Barry Katz, the big Jew, just added something to the equation. What about completely bald? Of course. Buddy, that's going to be obvious. I can guarantee you I'm not completely bald. You can't help us. No help. We're going to let Buddy have the first guess. So, Lynn, when you're ready... All right. Buddy, listen closely. She will now rub. Okay, hold on. Okay. Oh, my God. Lynn, one more time. I don't think I did that at the time. How about it first, Buddy? Buddy's guess is very natural in the center, trimmed on the side, and you must have gone out with a fireman because there's a brass button at the end. Don't say anything. That was very cute. Lynn, don't let it out if he's right or not. Yeah, well... All right, Lynn. You have to put it four separate times for you guys to guess? Yeah, that was Buddy's guess, very natural. Okay, now... His guess is very natural. Don't give us any clues. And I guess who's up next? He must have dated a fireman because he's got a brass hand. No, that's thick because my father is a fireman. That's how funny he lives. All right, Lynn. You're freaking me out. All right, Lynn, one more rub there. One more rub. One? I'm going to give you one more. Well, who's up? The rest of us.

Alright, we have reviews from everyone. The worst of Opie and Anthony 1027 WNEW. Diarrhea, wave, hits prisons, supper blame. In Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican prison. Jamaican prison. That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh? And all the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper. A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than a thousand convicts suffering. Doctors are struggling frantically to contain the outbreak which inmates have blamed on their Sunday supper. The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering. Spicy crab soup. Spicy crab soup. Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage. Rice, peas and chicken. No, no, they didn't have the rice, peas and chicken. Sunday meal of rice, peas and chicken. Opie, you're getting the story wrong. I preach a cut. Oh, they should have got the rice, peas and chicken but instead they got the spicy crab soup and the Chinese cabbage. And some kind of vegetable taro. Taro. Whatever that is. And... Oh, no. Diarrhea, cha-cha-cha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Angry prisoners on Monday dumped scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the cell blocks at protests. That's great. So they have the bad supper. Everyone has diarrhea. Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags. You know what's great? You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys. What do they do? They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages. Correct. Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons. No. Oh my God, throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea. That's great. Now the treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells for medication fearing attacks from other inmates. A special security team was going to cells to get inmates on the spot treatment if needed. This medical team had to go from cell to cell to get them treatment as there's diarrhea all over their cells. I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked and ran away. That old gag. All right, so they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the epidemic. There you have it. A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica suffering from diarrhea, Anthony. Diarrhea. After a bad Sunday supper. My pants are all full of goo. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. We're clapping. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Yeah, Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh. Oh. Er. Hey. Er. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Got your based days on thecrati Quiet now to answerow Now take my tonight'sc 외a 6 invitingables Zion Just see theseution Just see this funny Zion Just see this,sMac Whoo hoo the light You son here weare We're telling ya Oh Oh An outbreak of diarrhea Oh Must not be very You know how it sucks when you have diarrhea anyway, and you're in the best of conditions imagine that a Jamaican prison You know how you doing guys go is up David. Yeah, I got to figure it out I know what happened in Jamaica the wood was at the bottom of it He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there. Hey now. We're definitely put a damper on it Hey What now would wreck the party wouldn't absolutely you keep it up I did Look like the mud people from Woodstock Oh It is open Anthony hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us Hillary Clinton has announced that she's officially running Anthony what a surprise for the Senate seat Geez does that mean we don't have to put the bill anymore for every trip she makes here what Huh? So finally she announced and what does that mean? What does she do now? Well she had her speech Yesterday I checked that out. Mm-hmm. She pretty much wants to solve every single problem facing the world Where all that money come from the work and slob? ship I'm getting scared. I'm getting scared. I think she's gonna win this game election. I'm dying. It scares the crap out of me Now I think there's enough stupid people out there That's gonna push her over the top Anthony. I still think Rudy's Rudy has a narrow league this point narrowly. I Don't know they haven't started the mudslinging commercials yet. Really? There'll be some great ones. She couldn't keep tabs on her husband's affairs. Are you gonna elect her to take care of yours? Pay for my friends of roadie. Joey. Melanie. Hey Dave, what's going on? Hey, they both suck. Okay. Yeah, okay I cannot think of I can't think of who I dislike more Yeah, that's a great way to look at it. Everybody in New York thinks Rudy's like a big bully I mean he gets things done, but he's like this big bully and you don't do it my way I'll just push you around until I get what I want. Yeah, okay So that's that's Rudy's side of it They take Hillary and she doesn't know a damn thing about what she's doing here doesn't have a clue The only reason she's in New York is because New York will let her without being a true resident run for Senate, right? Correct. She doesn't get into the Senate bill is history, too. How long do you think he'll be around? I hope a while I want to see him. I know we all want to see him. I want to see him just party his ass off when he gets out of Office it's gonna be interesting after he leaves office great material something's gonna go horribly wrong with that guy I mean everybody in New York has got to lose their mind to vote Hillary in them Well, I'm starting to worry about this one and that's an insult to New Yorkers, isn't it? Maybe that'll be the way a bill get back in Hillary like for being such a bitch to him and not giving him any and stuff Like that. He'll just treat her like crap and Ruin her name, you know what I mean? That'd be fun like she'll be trying to be this legitimate politician and he'll just go out and bang chicks and Hang out in the booby bars. Mm-hmm. And that'd be a great episode of cops. Hmm. All of a sudden the cop gets a call And Bill just comes out with his wife beater t-shirt on You know, I'll get drunk and everything.

You think this is really funny? Our caller, Frank, you're on the air. This is really... I've been listening to this. It's just Insider. I don't think it's funny that CBS FM is a station that's responsible for bringing rock and roll to this city. Ho-ho, Frank. Looks like Hitler missed a few. CBS. It's not funny, man. It's just not funny. It's not funny. You're saying it's not funny. It's not funny. It's not right, man. It's just not right. Is my echo coming through? Because that's all that matters. Your echo's coming through. You need a little bit more if you really want to know the truth. Alright, Frank. Now, what's the deal with that other station? I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Why... He doesn't understand it. We're not going to be on CBS FM. And dedicated to him will play just a little understanding. Take you right back to 1962, Frank. We understand you. We're listening here at CBS FM. What is the purpose of the echo at CBS FM? CBS. It's to help enhance my voice so you can't tell I'm 101 just like our frequency. 101, CBS FM. Goddamn. Ron, let me see the CBS FM. How you doing, people? This one's going to bring back some memories of those black exploitation films. What is this, a deep ass walk? I thought it was sad. I could talk through the whole thing, but there's no words in this song. So I can talk it up right to the end. Hey, let's go touch some children. CBS. I bet Frank didn't like that one. Frank that just called in didn't like it because he's a child-toucher. CBS. Hey, just stay with me here on CBS FM. Reminding everyone, do a public service announcement.
