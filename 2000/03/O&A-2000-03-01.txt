 OP and Anthony. Well you guys are fucking stupid. You're like a black eye for all mankind. I don't think they're very nice people. The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin. OP and Anthony. You know, I just like wanna throw up. Feel the love. 1027 WNAW. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Ugh! Fuck! Is this the OP and Anthony show? On this fine, fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday? Well, I tried to nice out. Kinda gray. Kinda spring-like though. Well, it was kinda nice out when I, uh, I got a... Mother has changed, I guess, a bit. Uh, did a little music break there. Smashing pumpkins. A track off their latest CD, Machina, The Machines of God. That's the everlasting gaze. Foo Fighters, before that, Everlong. Is he still got the, uh, is he still sporting the Uncle Fester look? Uh, yes he is. Billy Corrigan, sure. The CD rocks, Anthony. Yeah. I jam it on, uh, the Long Island Railroad so I don't have to listen to all the, uh, Housewives. Yapping and talking about, uh, what Broadway show they're coming into the city to sing. Oh. Oh. Best present I got, uh, present I got this Christmas was a CD Walkman. Yeah. I could tune everyone out. I could tune Cell Phone Guy out. I could tune these, uh, these old Housewives that come in for the Broadway shows. Yes, I'm seeing Jacqueline Hyde. Right. I'm gonna stop at the Hard Rocker. Look at Elvis' clothes. No, it's usually like the Carnegie Deli or, you know. Yeah. They got it all figured out. Lunch and a Broadway show. Great. Keep it to yourself. I'm going to work. Wonderful. It was fabulous. Singing was fabulous. I don't know what's in the water on, on Long Island, but man, there is no hope for us. Have you seen the show? It's wonderful. Did you hear? Katz is closing. You know, I never respected the show, but since it's closing, I'm gonna have to catch it. Ha ha ha ha. Just for the fact that it's been there so long. I mean... And I do, do so enjoy Broadway, the theater, that I have to... Get me another pommel salad, please. Anthony, are you officially gay if your, like, wife of 30 years starts sounding like that? I mean, these women on the tram, like, there's nothing feminine about them anymore. They turn into men. Are you officially gay if your wife turns into one of those? I think it's all the sumps out on Long Island. God damn, what's in the water? The sump. The hell's in the water? Hello. Right. That's exactly how they started this morning. Where do you want to eat lunch? Do you have a light, darling? Ha ha ha ha. Only got the fake hair that's been sprayed and all the lacquered, friggin' Ronald McDonald orange hair. Who asks for that color? Ronald McDonald orange, please. Just the way I get it every week, darling. I'm going to the parlor this month. The parlor? The parlor. I'm going to the parlor. They got that friggin' football helmet hairdo. Man, it's like an Orange Julius color. They say it all the time, but time is just a bitch. I'm sure they were hot Bettys in the day. Oh my God. And now they're just like, they look like Ronald McDonald, they talk like men. They got chin hair now. The picture of running out of class during school to maybe meet up with her boyfriend. They're a little hobbing of the nothing. No, but you know, just hooking up. Sure. You know, you're on a little dangerous, cute and stuff. And then just add a little time. Why were you late from work today? You know, you know it's garbage day and now you have to get back out and take the garbage out. It's like, what happened? What happened? You know, I don't think my wife's been born yet. Is that how you're headed? Oh yeah, that's how I'm going to solve this problem. She's not born yet. My wife's not born yet. Oh, crap. That's pretty good. Because the more and more I listen to these Long Island Bettys on the train, I'm like, oh my God. At least like I'll be 80 by the time they hit that stage and it won't matter anymore. You come home to that. No, you know, we're still happy. It's wonderful. You know, it's 30 years of marriage and could you shoot me? Yes, sorry. There was four of them in front of me this morning and I'm jamming the Smashing Pumpkins in my... This is what's so freaking funny about the Long Island Railroad because I don't care anymore. We will never be apart. Right, right. So I'm cranking out the new Smashing Pumpkins. I got the CD. I've had it for about a week, right? Yeah. I am just checking out the latest issue of Penthouse. I don't even care anymore. I used to hide it. I used to have a Sports Illustrated on top and have the Sports Illustrated cover up and Gash on the inside. I used to look like that centerfold, darling. I don't even care. So I'm bopping my head. I got the Penthouse up high and they're in front of me. I could care less what they're thinking because I can't hear them anyway because I was cranking up the tunes. You know, where you open up to one of the photo shoots where the girls are whizzing on each other. That would be a good one. What is... Oh my God. Oh my God, the Ronald McDonald art. That's classic. And it is. I remember my grandmother, God rest her soul, she would go to the parlor. Every... I mean it would only be once a month. And you know she ain't washing her hair because it has to... It was like the big ass head creatures on Star Trek. Remember the first one, the menagerie, the pilot, the Captain Christopher Pike? She had the big ass head made of just this white hair. And she'd spray it. She'd use just wonderful hairspray. Those big cans. Like God forbid she went to turn the light on and it arced or something, the walls would blow out. It would just... because of huge fire. But she's there, you're... I gotta just spray until I get to the parlor. Come give your nana a kiss. Nana, I need a gas mask to get over there. There's some hydrofluorocarbons all in the room. Oh, well... And we used to, as kids, we would touch our hair. We'd be like, hey, can I touch your hair? She'd be like, sure, touch my hair. And you'd touch it and you'd be amazed because it wasn't hair. It was not hair. It was a space age polymer. It was like hard cotton candy. Yeah, exactly. Like cotton candy or like fiberglass. You know, it's all lacquered over. Dan from Long Island on the InstaFeedback. Hey, Howard Stern Imitators, who shall remain nameless? Why won't Hollywood Howie mention you guys? Obviously, he doesn't want to. Some apparent reason. He could mention everybody else's name when he has a problem with them. I've heard him back down from mentioning Imus or DiBella or Man Cow or any one of the other numbers of radio personalities that are on the air that he said sucked and have no talent and everything else. But he mentions them for some weird reason. Our names are not mentioned. Everyone knows who the hell he's talking about. We're flattered. That means we're not in the same category as the true imitators of your show. No, I guess he mentioned the other people's names because he figured people would tune over, listen and go, oh, he's right. They do suck and then come back to him. But for some reason, he won't mention our names. Interesting. Who? Give me a sea breeze, Rob. KJ from Queens. He was blatantly dissing you guys today and didn't even have the balls to mention your names. That's good. Well, thank you, Mr. Imus. We appreciate that. That's good. Yeah. That's it. How you doing? It's 2.53 on The Fan. This is Howard Stern. Looking a little familiar, isn't it? Watch your own movie, man. Get out of here. I don't care. Let's go to the phone. F you. See what people are saying today. 2127571027. Jeff, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on today? Yo, man, I heard, oh, Howard this morning was dissing you. Yeah. And we were told... He wasn't saying your name or nothing. He was just saying the two boys. And we were told we're not allowed to talk about him, you know, throwing a tantrum and crying like a little baby. No, because we all got to be team players. And kicking us out of his little press conference. There you go. We delayed his press conference 20 to 30 minutes because he had to get us out of the room. Yeah. We got another thing for you. What were you afraid of, Howard? We were just sitting there to check it out. The company told us to be team players, so we went down to check it out. That's it. He thought we had this big, huge plan that we were going to, like, try to disrupt his press conference. No, that... He went over you guys quick. It's been done. Well, that's fine. You know, I don't know what he was scared about. I don't know why he had to cry like a baby to our boss. We weren't going to do anything. I think you boys are getting set up and going for going to California, though. Well, whatever. Thank you, Jeff. You're glad. And then in the paper he takes a jab at any W, you know, calling us all imitators of his show. Yeah. He's the biggest ripoff artist there is, his brand new Son of the Beach TV show. I think I've seen that done a couple times, Howie. Police squad. Police squad, airplane movies. Are you going to acknowledge that? I'm ripping them off. He doesn't say he's ripping off the Zucker brothers and Abrams from the airplane movies and police squad. That show is an embarrassment, too. Don't even listen to what you read. That thing will never make it. FX should be ashamed they picked it up. Every other station, every other TV company in America said no to that thing, including our own company, CBS. And we're supposed to be team players, not talk about it or anything. But we weren't. We didn't yesterday. We weren't going to today. But if he gets on the air and starts talking, I don't want to hear no names are mentioned because, God damn it, you know who the hell he's talking about. So what are we supposed to sit here like a couple of pussies? You know, I'm tired of it. The funny thing is the company thinks we're not team players. I invented television. So we figured, what the hell, let's break the ice. We'll go to his press conference. We were invited as a radio station. Yeah, we have the proper credentials and everything. We went down there. We're like, OK, the company doesn't think we're team players. Howard's doing a press conference. I want to check it out. So we sat in the back row. We didn't even make a scene. No, we weren't going to sit up front and try to make a big scene. We were in back. Like where you're at a camera range or anything. If you want to start a scene, don't you think we'd sit up front where the cameras were or something? No, we just wanted to sit there. You know, excuse me, Howard is a celebrity, you know, in New York City and the country. He's a celebrity. It's newsworthy. We're down there checking it out. Not for long. No. Wasn't long before Mr. Security, man. Escort us out. Made us look like two complete idiots. I invented the press conference, Rod. You guys should have saw the looks we got when we were getting escorted out. That was just scum. Like we were the scourge of society and we weren't even going to do anything. We just want to show our support. And the guy that made a career out of sending people to press conferences, laughing his ass off as Stuttering John goes into press conferences and just disrupts the whole thing. And he would just laugh. And if anybody else threw Stuttering John out, how would it say? Oh, those pussies can't take it. Don't want to face me? Don't want to face John? Don't want to face... Oh, you'd throw him out. Yeah, what's the matter? You can't take it, you pussy? We were just sitting there to watch. He got right on the phone and had us thrown out. Thrown out. I invented a pussy, Rod. The lunch sucked anyway. Half a dry roast beef sandwich. Jesus Christ. Thrown out like the trash that we are. Made us feel good. As we attempted to be team players yesterday. Didn't work. Little support. You know, sitting down there, we were talking to the girl from Fox News. You know, looking at Penny Cron's face fall. You know, we were just having a little fun. That's all. Wanted to just hang out. You know what the funniest part of the whole thing is? They escort Opi and I out of the building. Out of the Plaza Hotel. They wouldn't even allow us to leave on our own. They had to make sure we were going to be out. And inside, unbeknownst to them, seated is Psycho Mark, who didn't get thrown out because they didn't know who he was. But the most dangerous man in media history, Psycho Mark, was sitting there the entire press conference. With RPD right over his shoulder, making sure he didn't say anything. That's the funny part about that whole thing. Because they were probably all relieved. Like, oh, thank God. Thank God those guys are out of here. They were going to cause a scene. Everyone can calm down now. The trouble is gone. There it is. Psycho Mark in the middle of the pack of reporters. I think at one point though, Psycho Mark did stand up and go, Hey, Imus. Hey, Imus. That was after we were thrown out. We just wanted to hang. Team players. Little support for Howie and his little TV show and everything. Because he's going to need all the support he could get for that piece of crap. And what kind of thanks do we get? What kind of thanks? What audience would he think would watch a show like that? Maybe basically men. Men 18 to 49. 18 to 49? Who's the number one show on afternoon drive for men? 18 to 49. That would be Mike and the Mad Dog. Absolutely. Mike and the Mad Dog. No, we're beating that. I don't want that out there. I think if everybody wasn't so goddamn paranoid, that sure, we might even watch it, talk about it. And maybe bring some more people to his little TV show. But, F it. He didn't want us there. We couldn't sit there. We couldn't even sit to watch the trailer. They threw us out before. They even rolled the trailer. Didn't want us there. He was paranoid we were in the audience. I'm quite flattered by that. I'm sure if Scott and Todd were there, he wouldn't have made a huge mistake. Throwing them out. Of course not. Anyone else? Imus. Mike and the Mad Dog. Gotta thank you Howard for letting me stay. I saw you throw out Hope and Anthony, those two lowlives. I like the show. Nothing better than watching a little tight gash in a bikini. So that's what happened yesterday. That's it. You're right. We weren't going to say anything, but I mean we can't sit back like idiots while one side gets to lambast us. It's just the way it is. Thank you. Thank you. Alright, I was talking about the Smashing Pumpkin CD. Can we give away a few of these? Because we definitely got to move on here. LNA talking out their ass. No we're not. Alright. We just talk the truth. Talking out our ass. Isn't that funny? You just say what happens, yet we're talking out our ass. Bob, what's up? Yeah. Hey. Alright. I called you guys before. You guys love my voice. Yeah, of course. I know. You trust us all the time. Without just being an idiot puppet, explain your point. Alright, here's my point. Please, I won't curse, so don't. I've called you guys in the past. You know that. Yes. I listen to you a lot. I work and I listen to you guys all day. Okay. I listen to Howard my whole life. Yes. You guys 100% steal bits. I'm not talking about borrow bits. I'm talking about you taking exact incidents that he has done, bits he's done. Like? I can name a million of them. Do you want a couple? Give us a couple of examples of how we've done exactly what Howard has done. Okay. You guys had a guy in there one time and you had another guy eat a Twinkie out of his ass, I'll say if that's allowed, like the jackie eating the marshmallows out of another guy's ass. That never happened. No, I'm telling you, I heard it on your show. Who ate a Twinkie out of his ass? You guys had two freaks come in and the one guy had to eat marshmallows out of the Twinkie. That's not true. It is true. I heard it. I'll tell you what happened. We had a big fat girl come in and sit on a cake and a guy had to eat cake off her ass for tickets. Now if you want to in some convoluted way try to make it like that's exactly what Howard did, then Howard invented breathing and walking too? No, that's... You guys... You're being a little vague. I'm not being vague. You guys are telling me that you don't see any resemblance to your show to his show. A resemblance? Sure. How about like an identical twin resembles his brother? Hey Bob, I could bring up stuff that he flat out took from us. Name one. Alright. That's not true. Remember the time Howard and the crew were wearing the pens until someone leaked? Yeah. Aunt and I did that bit in Boston three days before he did and we had all our listeners pound his fax machine yelling and screaming. I know. You guys listen to him probably as much as I do. I'm just saying it works both ways. True. You probably did. But no, Anthony, I still hear you mention every show he does every day. Now... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bob, please now listen to me for a second. I will listen to you. If you want to say that, I am not up until he's off the air. I get up probably 9.30, I go right to the computer and start trading stocks. Anthony, yesterday you mentioned stuff he said on his show. Like what? And I know you said it again today with the sea breeze. Yesterday you mentioned him talking about California. Now you're not hearing the show if somebody's giving you a transcript of the show? No, I'm hearing from other people around the station that go, what a fag, he's drinking sea breezes. Sure. I hear that, but no, I don't... Bob, trust me when I tell you, I've known Anthony for a long time. It's not possible for Anthony to get up there. I'm not up. I'm not up to listen. Please understand. It's not that you're not going to convince me. Do people feed us a line or two around here that they might have heard him say? Sure, of course. I'm not going to lie. But I haven't listened to his show in a very long time. I checked him out right after he announced the whole separation thing. And I went on the air and said it was some of the best radio he's done since like... And I remember you saying that. Since like 88. But I remember you saying that and saying that he needed higher ratings. I remember you saying that. Needed higher ratings? No, you said it like this guy needs anything else to talk about. He had such high ratings now his ratings are even higher. You're complimenting him. I've complimented Howard enough and we're sick and tired of hearing Howard cry about us. No one else can do radio in New York except Howard. That's not true. But I'm saying it's like singing, I want to hold your hand and say you wrote it. You guys do exactly what he does. It's not a fact. I listen to you. I listen to you all the time. Bob, you're delusional. I'm not delusional. I've listened to him my whole life. Exactly. And that's why you think like that. Listen, I thought you were getting divorced because you got divorced. Yeah, that's what it is. I needed. I'm really taking it a little far. To tell you the truth, when he announced that he was being separated and no one knew before that, I'm like, Jesus Christ, at that point I'd been out of my house for about two months. So you were copying you? Yeah, right. No, the fact of the matter is I didn't say anything and when he announced it I'm like, great. Now if I do announce it, people are going to say, oh yeah. I invented the voice, Robin. Do you remember you got on and you were saying how Man Cow is stealing your stuff? That's what Howard always said. But Man Cow did. He stole Whip-A-Mount Wednesday. So what, just because something really happens we can't talk about it? It killed the... It defended me exactly the way he said it. Bob, I'm going to hang up on you if you don't allow me to have a conversation with you. I'm listening to you. First of all, you're delusional if you think Howard was the first to do this type of radio. He has all you guys brainwashed thinking that he invented all this stuff. This crap has been going on a lot longer than Howard. I used to drive in 83, 84 when he first came around. I listened to radio morning, noon and night, and I drove for 10 hours a day. There were guys doing lesbian stuff before Howard. I promised you I was a fan of the radio. That's why I listen to you guys. There were guys doing lesbian radio before Howard. I know that's hard for you to swallow, but it's true. If you want to do some research, look up Steve Cullen. It's not that important to me. It's just that it's very evident that you guys are doing exactly what he does. You should have all the facts though. You guys used to make fun of him with the lesbians, and now you have lesbians in there every day. I never made fun of that. You definitely didn't. I heard it with my own ears. I'm not hearing it second hand. With this guy's logic though, it's like saying, Oh my God, look, one baseball player is ripping off another one because he goes out there and hits home runs. But what I'm saying is one baseball player is copying another player's style when he crunches down like Joe Morgan. That's what I'm saying. You're taking an exact style. Exact. No difference. That's not true. That's your opinion, huh? You're going to tell me that... You know, Bob, I don't even have to defend our show. All I know is there's enough people out there that listen to us and know what the deal is, that we do come up with a ton of original stuff. End of conversation. I don't hear it. I don't hear it. I don't hear it because you're one of the Howard guys and that's fine. That's not true. I laugh a lot at things. I hope our listeners defend us as much as you defend Howard. I appreciate that, but it's not true. It's not true. They cite stuff. I've been hearing Howard do it. They cite stuff and I say, Howard did this. Howard's made a career, years and years, of getting people to believe everything he says. And when he says that people are ripping him off and he invented this and blah, blah, blah, people are going to buy it and you're one of those types of people that just step fast to believe it. These guys hold up the signs and the deal and the fight is going on. That's all Futter and John. Dude, how about Butt Bongo Fiesta? Yeah. Remember that? Yeah. Remember Butt Bongo? I remember it well. Call Howard and ask him where he got the idea from. Where he got the idea from? Not us. No, not us. No, but see if he'll be honest with you. I haven't got time to call him. Ask him. Ask him. Dude, ask him if he used to get tapes from Chicago and get copies of Steve Dahl's radio show. Just ask him. You had mentioned Steve before. We're honest on this radio show. Ask him those two questions. See if you get a real answer. You won't. I couldn't be too much with the guys. You won't. Listen, I don't believe you. Hey Bill, what's up? I was listening to Stern the day that he heard about Butt Bongo Fiesta and said he wanted to do it on the air. Yeah, it was two DJs up in Maine. Yeah, I heard it. The day he did that. I remember that one because I was listening too. You're saying he acknowledged it. And then he took it as his own and... This guy just said he acknowledged it and said, I want to do that. Yeah, and he ripped it off. And then after that he made it his own. That was it. And now if anybody else does Butt Bongo Fiesta, they're going to say, oh, I invented that, Robin. Right. There's one of your guys. This guy hasn't been original since Kinnison's mom. You guys finally had balls enough to actually put me through, I'll give you that. You always hang up and say, oh, you can't curse and I've never cursed. No, because you come on and then you tell... I know who you are. You tell a story and then you jump in with a baba buoy and start rolling. I've never been a baba buoy in my life. And after a while it gets stupid and boring, man. But you point it off and say, you hung up because I cursed because you wanted to look like you're honest. And I've never cursed. And you always say, oh, you can't curse, man. Right or wrong? Well, we let you throw to disgusting because you don't want to talk. But right or wrong? Now you're discussing. Right or wrong is that what you're... I would have to hear a tape. I don't know. Come on, man. You know you're not doing it by... I'm being honest. We hang up on plenty of people and think out of their curses on a daily basis. I wouldn't call it a curse so I wouldn't get on a radio. I call it for the goof factor. You know what? You guys go ahead. Keep copying. I'll keep listening. There's nothing else on the radio. Well, thank you, Bob. At least we got you every day. That's true. Okay. Every day. Hey, Bill. I'm with the train. Bill, thank you. No problem. All right, man. Bye. There you go. I'm going to go ahead and say that for as long as we did. Whatever. I know the faithful listeners know that we do enough original stuff on the show. That's all that matters. I don't care. We worked too hard to be labeled that. And Howard gets to say that in the paper today and we're told we can't say a word about it. So unless you're on the air just segging tunes or doing news or... I don't know. I guess that's it. If you're on the air just segging tunes or just a news broadcaster, you're ripping off Howard, right? But the fact is we were thrown out of his press conference when we were trying to be team players because the company told us to be team players. So we figured we'd make the first move. I even tried to get into his birthday party. I thought it would be cool just to hang. I wasn't going to disrupt it. We weren't allowed to do that either. No. So... Keeping us at distance. We definitely try to be team players. We do work for the same company. Yeah. But it was a big deal that we were at his press conference yesterday. Such a big deal. What is he scared of? I don't know. We're not even in the same day part. All right. Back to the smashing pumpkin CD. Oh, yeah. Then I'm jamming on the way to work. We got a... How many do you want to give away? Like three? All right. We'll give the new smashing pumpkin CD, the machine of God, to the 10th, 11th, and 12th callers right now. 212-757-1027. We're going to regroup and we'll be back. Stay there. Holy and Anthony. We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area. More stupidity on the way. 1027-WNEW. Whippin' out Wednesday. Woohoo! There it goes. This guy's very good over there. He's there for me. The Hopi Show. I like Anthony. Did you like Anthony? We're going to Kinnison and we're finally asking Jackie to do Vegas and Jackie turning him down because there's not enough money. I love Anthony. You know, I forgot all about that. Anthony tapped into something. Do you remember that? Didn't Kinnison once ask you to play with him and you turned him down? I like Anthony too. Thank you, Hopi. Here's the Hopi and Anthony Show, our phone line, 212-757-1027. What's the fax line? They got this big NAW banner behind you because I guess Xtru is supposed to be here today. Interview the radio chick about the bra incident on Letterman with Kathie Lee Gifford. And then Show, huh? Fax line 212-957-WNEW. This is Reveille, right? All right, let's go to Jim. Jim, you're next on NEW. What's going on, Jim? Hey, what's up? Hey. You told us to listen to that guy last night. Which one? Which show? The one right after you. Don and Mike? Yeah. And? Not bad. It's like a dysfunctional family. Well, they just started. You've got to give them time. Not tonight, actually. Hey, I listened to them over Likus. Unlike other high-profile jocks in this city, we're going to try to support the people we work with. I tried to call in last night before and say what I learned. And I was going to tell you guys that I was, for the first time in a month and a half, not going to listen to K-Rock at 7 o'clock. Yeah, we don't want you listening to them anymore because we finally found a show that might work. Yeah, exactly. So we threw them a bone for a while when Likus was still here, but Likus is gone. We have Don and Mike from Washington. They follow us now. And I think you guys really should give them a chance before you trash them. Not bad. Hey, real quick. Give them at least three or four months. Have you checked out Ron and Fez after Don and Mike? No, I'm up before 4 a.m. every morning. Well, did you check them out, Ron and Fez? No, because they go off to foreign. Some other stupid thing comes up. Hey, real quick. Yesterday, talking to that chick with the Hummer thing, I found out the problem. He's paying for them. I don't know what he's talking about. Yeah, I lost you, man. I'm paying her to give them. Everyone went right over your head. Yeah. All right, man. We have short-term memory problems. Heavily medicated. The one with the ball in her mouth that was giving him rung, he wasn't enjoying them. Oh, the ball? Yeah, okay. That's why he's not enjoying them anymore. You have to pay for them. All right, I got you. Thank you, man. We're moving on to new things today. Please. New things. We can't keep track of what's going on here today. We can't rehash stuff from yesterday. Except for the fact that we did have a great lesbian for a day at the end of the show. Right at the end of the show. Fantastic. We had the crappiest pictures. Whoever was taking the pictures should be fired. Really bad? Horrible. I had something going for the... what was her name? Karen with the big, huge young breasts? They were nice and firm and stuff. Yeah. So I quickly went online this morning to check out the pictures on the unofficial website. We got crappy pictures up there from last night's festivities. What's wrong with them? Why are they crappy? Crappy quality or crappy poses? I think we got pictures of their elbows. Oh, really? I'm serious. There's one good shot, but you don't know what they look like. You can't really appreciate the big, huge hooters. Mark's got the video. Yeah, I got the video. Are you going to send the video to Steve? Yeah, as soon as I can get it out to Steve. That was great yesterday. Yeah, because there's some great clips there. We didn't think the girls were going to go at it. We had the lesbian couch in here. There was no love connection. The other girl, Galaxia, was all bummed out that Karen didn't really... she really wasn't into her. And then out of nowhere, Karen just takes her top down. She's got the huge hooters, and she goes, look, I'll let her do whatever she wants to me. That was unbelievable. Yeah, out of nowhere, I thought that nothing was going to be happening. Score! Yeah, it was a score. And then Karen just laid on her back and allowed Galaxia to go to... Ha ha! Galaxia, what kind of name is that? Right? It's Galaxia? It's like that game you play in the arcade. Yeah, isn't that a game? Galaxia? Yeah, that is actually. All right. We got some guys outside that want to do something crazy for the show. This one guy's got the most incredible hat I've ever seen in an entire world. Are you going to be able to leave work today, Mark? This is your day. Whip him out Wednesday. Yeah, I can get fired today. Huh? Send him to TRL. You want to go to TRL? Oh, Madonna's on TRL today. TRL? Oh, that whore. We should get some wow... These guys have the best sign. That's the best wow I've ever seen. All right, let's bring him in. What, he's got a hat or something you're saying? So his hat lights up like... Get out of here. Like Nagasaki. Yeah, these guys, I guess, they're leaving or something and they want to walk down... Paul, you can't... Oh, now you're talking. Put that hat on. Look at this thing. This thing is out right. He's got a construction hat with the famous Open Anthony Wow sticker. And then on top of it, he has to have like a three-foot sign that lights up. That is the goddamn funniest thing. Dude, you're going to walk down the street with that? Sure. One of your bulbs are out. That's a grounding problem. You want to have like a... All right, so what are you, electrician or tin knocker? Oh, I need a... Oh, what are you doing? Exterminator. How is that lighting up? Exterminator. I have too much time. How is that lighting up, first of all? Got a little motorcycle battery there? Motorcycle battery? Yeah. He's got it on the side of his body there. All right. God damn, if you get on a live shot with that thing, you'll be the king. Why don't you guys like walk down Broadway toward TRL? We'll have to... You got a cell phone, right? Give us a call and see how far he makes it because everyone's got to check out this sign. It's hilarious. This sign has to be on TV. Are the other guys with you or they... No, no, those guys, they just saw up here when I came in. Oh, all right. And what's your name, man? Larry. Larry. And why do you want to do this, Larry? Just for the hell of it? Yeah, just for the hell of it. And we'll throw you some prizes and stuff. Oh, well, completely take care of you. I mean, Jesus Christ, if that gets on TV, I will laugh my ass off. It's a construction hat with the wow sticker and then just a huge, what, about three foot wow sign? Yes. That lights up. Three foot by one foot. And like the pole's about, I don't know, eight to 10 inches. Yeah. And the letters are well over a foot high. Yeah. That's nice. Here, turn that on so we can get a picture for the underground website. Look at that thing. Put it on your head too. That'll make a good picture. Awesome. Mark, can you kill a little time and go down there with him or what? Big lit up wow. Do you want to see if more people want to show up this afternoon? We can have like a posse? Big wow-age. We'll wait a few minutes. Yeah, you want to start it. How about we just get people in the area? We start at four o'clock. Yep. Four o'clock, where are you going to be? Right downstairs in front of the Brooklyn Diner. At 57th and 7th? Yep. In front of the Brooklyn Diner. We'll just go for a little walk. And then we'll just take a look at the food. Yeah. And then we'll just go to the food. Yep. In front of the Brooklyn Diner. We'll just go for a little walk. And then we'll just take a little, we'll make a little wow parade down at TRL today. That's a great wow show. That's hilarious. It is so funny how it lights up. All right, so at four o'clock in front of the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, if you want to join Psycho Mark and this crazy mofo. Who are the other guys out there? Some other guys came down. You talked to them yesterday and said they want to come down and go down and hang out with Mark today at TRL. So they're here as well. Yeah, bring them in. Were they the ones that wowed on TV last night? Dudes, what's up? Were you the one on TV last night? No. Oh, because that sign looks familiar. Wow. What's your name, man? I'm Chris. Hey, Chris. Lad. Lad? And who's the other dude? Hey, Kerry, what's up? Do you guys want to go down to TRL with that huge wow sign? Yeah. We're going to do like a little wow parade. Yeah. We're going to start it at four o'clock outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th. We should see if we get some girls too, you know? Yeah, we need a couple girls to show up. Some authentic wowing going on. I know this is last minute, but we can pull this off. Four o'clock we'll be outside. Oh, I invented wow. That rocks. I invented parades. All right. And then after you guys do this and go down to MTV and have some fun, come back to the station, we'll hook you guys up with some good stuff, all right? Thanks. All right, man. Where are you guys from, by the way? Jersey. Jersey? Cool. We like Jersey. Long Island. Long Island, yeah. You guys live in the Port Jeff area? Sure. Sure. I've hung out in Port Jeff a ton in the summertime. Actually, I do work for, I think you guys show up at the Greenland Fire Department fair sometimes? Oh, yes. The Greenland Fire Department's fair. You do that every year? Yep, I do work for them. Oh, good deal. All right, we'll see you guys outside at four o'clock. Thanks for stopping by. Thanks, dude. Goddamn, is that funny. It's really funny. It's the best wow sign I've ever seen. I can't wait to see that on TV. Hey, Mike, what's going on? How are you, man? How are you? All right, man. Good. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about Don and Mike. I used to listen to those guys down in Washington. I used to drive down there. Those guys are pretty good, man. I mean, you know, for seven o'clock run, you know? Yeah, they're on after us here in New York, and yeah, we're going to give them a chance, you know? Yeah. I'm sorry, man. They're definitely worth listening to, you know? I mean, that's like the best radio that they have down there in Washington and Virginia, man. I mean, the only thing they got is how it in the morning, and you got to wait until seven o'clock at night. Actually, they're on at two o'clock down there. Yeah. You got to get them at two o'clock. Well, that's the only thing that goes on. I like them a lot better than Lycus, so. Yeah, Lycus really sucked, man. And we really got to start supporting some more shows around here, or we're going to be screwed. Listen, let me ask you a question, man. Don't come to you off. I just want to ask you seriously. Look. Yeah. I'm not going to curse or nothing, but. You guys are going to get us in so much trouble. No, no, no. We're really going to move on. Go. Look, I'm not going to say nothing. Go. All I'm saying is that you guys say, I mean, you guys are good. I'm a good fan, and you know, I look at you guys all the time. You're not going down in the mornings, but if you did, I know you guys are team players, you know, you're on the same cup being everything, but if you guys went in the mornings, you actually think that you would, you know, beat Howard. I'm not going to go in the mornings. Well. I know you're not going in the mornings, but I'm saying, if you guys did go to the mornings, you actually think that you would, you know, match up against Howard's Raiders. Mike, let me tell you the guy's honest truth and soapy speaking, okay? I would love to go to mornings and see what we could do. I mean, you guys are good, man. I'm not saying I'm a competitive person, and I would love to see, you know, what we could do against them, sure. That's my God's honest answer. Will it happen? I don't think so. I like you guys, man. I think you guys are good. I mean, I'm not putting you guys down at all. You know, don't get me wrong. I'm not afraid to go up against them. I want to see, you know, how good we are. You know, might as well go up against the best in New York. Well, that's true. But it's not going to happen. I know that. You guys get good ratings in the afternoons. You think you'd get them in the morning. That's all I'm saying. I mean, isn't that where the most radio is in the morning? Mike, it would be a bear. It would take a long time. Especially working for the same company. Right. I know. Then we wouldn't be able to compete the way we would want to. I would love to give it a shot. Could we win? Of course. I think we could win, sure. Why don't you guys move to K-Rock? Then you guys will have a real radio station. They had dumped us. You guys weren't on K-Rock. That's just another story for another day. K-Rock could have had us, and then they didn't want us. That would be better than, what's his name, a tool clock, that's for sure. I don't even know who's on it against us anymore. All right, Mike, thank you. Thanks. Bye. You guys, you've got to move on from this. We're done with that. We do all live phones. You're just going to get us screwed. So please move on. I think we've spent enough time on it. Adam, what's going on? O&A. How's it going? Good. Radio chick O&A in Don and Mike. That's some quality radio there, guys. Remember them last night? They were great. They were hysterical. They had me rolling. Well, that's what we want. You know? Yeah, that's good stuff. Well, cool. I'm glad you like it so far. And I think if they keep the line up exactly how it is, radio chick, and then you guys, and then Don and Mike, that's just ratings galore right there. Well, we believe so. We will see. We definitely believe so. Okay, you guys suck. All right. Thanks, Adam. All right. Bye. I mean, the deal is, Ant and I are nearing two years in New York. Yep. Let me just get this out of the way, okay? We really need to start supporting the other shows here at NAW. Or at least giving them a chance. There hasn't been anything worth supporting for a while. No, for the last two years, Ant and I have worked for a station that is still in last place. Dead last. Dead freaking last. We're doing well, thank you. Ant and I consistently do three times the ratings of any other show on this station. That's a fact. That's a fact. We are number one in all the key demos in afternoon drive. That's a fact. Yes. Okay? The problem is, that's not good enough to keep a station going. No. If this station continues to be in last place, there's going to be a major problem. Yeah, they'll do something. Something drastic that won't include Ant and I. So we have to support the new shows and give them a chance, okay? Ant and I only have a little over a year left in our contract. Yeah. Let me say it right now. A year from now, if this station is in last, I have no desire to re-up. No. No desire whatsoever. Do we want to stay in New York? Do we want to stay at NAW? Yes. But oh my God, could you imagine having to sign on to the station in last place again? Oh, when we got here, all the stories we heard of how great it was going to be in a matter of months. Right. And to be honest with you, a year from now, if the station is still in last, I don't think the company is going to put up with it. Right. So it's kind of like we're up to do or die. I mean, a year goes by like that. So we are going to support all the new shows. We really like the radio chick now. She has proven herself. And we're going to give the other shows a chance and then we'll see what happens. Yeah, we're not going to write off the bat trash anyone. We'll give them a chance. If they suck, you'll know it. We'll know it. Yeah, we're not going to make believe. We don't fake it. We're not going to make believe it's a great show. Come on. Why couldn't you do that for me? When it's obviously a bad show. I'm gone. But we're going to give them a solid three or four months before we make any opinions. That's a definite. Yeah. You know? All right, let's move on. Let's go to Andy. Andy, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on? Hey, how you doing? Good. Tom Green last night. And the Lewinsky thing? It was so good. You liked it, huh? It was... I thought they... I don't know. There were a lot of funny things going on. I want to thank Tom Green for calling our show yesterday. That was pretty cool. I just liked the way... I mean, it was a little different obviously than the rest of his shows. Right. But they built it up. They took an entire town. They played with them for an entire week. And the big announcement was handbags. Yeah. Yeah. They went to... If you didn't watch last night, I'm sure no one MTV, they'll run it another 10 times in the next month. Tom Green took Lewinsky back to his hometown in Vancouver. And then they created a media frenzy saying they had a huge announcement. And the announcement was something really, really stupid about what? Vancouver being the fabric capital of the universe or something? Yeah, Ottawa, something like that. And then they showed a couple of handbags they made out of Tom Green's parents' bedspread. You just got lucky the way that they had the media following them around for a week. Yeah, it was pretty good. For three days. All right, well, three days. The best part of the show was when Tom Green, he does a lot. He goes and wakes up his parents at four in the morning. Yeah. And his father wakes up and goes, oh, Monica, hi. Just completely like surprises him with Monica Lewinsky in the middle of the night. It was pretty funny. She had her hobbist knob. That's what we said to Tom yesterday. He didn't look bad. Really? How's she looking? I didn't see it. Neck down. Neck down. Neck down? No, I think her face is not bad. Is she still plump? Yeah, she's still a little chubby. She depends on what angle you're looking at her. She seems to have a really nice personality, though. She was very bubbly. Yeah. I think if Tom Green could get her on his show, then we could get Monica on our show. I think if we played our cards right, I think she would come on this show. Let's try to get that together. You mean get her on the couch? Get her on the couch. Monica. At least we should talk to her on the phone or something. Yeah. She had a really cool personality. We'll look at her. I think we will. MTV will be running it again. It definitely was a pretty good Tom Green show last night. Hey, one other question for you guys. Have you ever seen a show on the Food Network called The Iron Chef? No. I want to talk about it. It's Friday night's most intense show on TV. It's a Japanese overdub show in English that treats cooking like a sport. Cool. Really? Yes. I can't deal with the Food Network. No, this isn't Food Network. It could be on ESPN. Oh, really? Yeah. All right, I'll look for it. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. See you next time. Thank you, Andy. All right. All right, man. We've got to take a break. Anthony, we'll be back with more of your phone calls in just a bit. Hey, New York. This is Vince McMahon of the WWF and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio, Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW. Thank you, Vince. Where's Vince, man? CBS is trying to, what, get SmackDown on CBS. Oh, yeah? Comes in the business section of the paper today, right? Yeah. You know, Linda McMahon, Vince's wife, is the one that's in charge of the whole frigging shebang. She is truly the CEO of the company and she's really the one that deals with the stockholders and everything. Isn't that something? And what does Vince do then? He's like a figurehead. He's a PR guy, you know? Yeah. He goes out and shakes the hands of a cheese-like fish. Like the brains. That's about that. So what's the deal? I mean, CBS just wants to get SmackDown on Channel 2 or whatever or? Yeah. SmackDown's on what? Channel 9 now? Yeah. Yeah, they want to get it on CBS. That would be huge for the WWF. Yeah. Huge. Yes. And they reported earnings, Anthony? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, my goodness. How are you? I didn't know I was on. You startled me with the ringing of the phone when I picked you up. Yeah, I was dialing on my other phone to make a phone call. Oh, it's Opi and Anthony and you're live on our show. Okay. Just calling in to ring in to my boyfriend, Rich, who was initiated into the Hummer Tuesday Club yesterday. Or Tuesday Hummer Club, either way. Tuesday Hummer Club. All right. And he wanted me to do this for him. To what? To hob his knob or to call the radio show? And let you guys know that he was initiated. Oh, right on. What's his name? Rich. And where does he work? He works for KeyStand Energy. So now everyone there knows he got a Hummer last night from you. Yes, they do. Well, thank you for supporting the radio show and hobbing his knob. Anytime. How was it? Was it all right? Well, I didn't get a that a girl. Oh, really? Well, because it went a little too far into excitement and got turned into something else. Oh, I got you. Oh, some sex. Yeah. Some all out. Yeah. Sweaty sex. Yeah. That's what those Hummers usually end up. Yeah. Oh, nothing wrong with that. Nothing at all. All right. Well, thanks for sharing today. No problem. All right. Bye. Have a good one. Thanks. Let's go to Sue. Sue has a problem with something associated with our radio show. Sue, what's going on? Hi, guys. Hi. I've been waiting forever. OK, listen. You guys have the what is it, official or unofficial girl? The Opium Anti-Girl? The unofficial website is doing the girls of ONA. Yeah, there's a section on the website. All right. No, I already I saw it. Do you know that one of them is a prostitute? All right. An extra added treat. That would figure. No, I'm dead serious. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I want to get everyone up to speed. The unofficial Opium Anti-Girl website, www.foundrymusic.com, has the girls of ONA section where we encourage, you know, the ladies of our show to send in some launching pictures of themselves. Food, yeah. And then the listeners kind of vote on who the hottest girl is and then they win stuff, I guess. Yeah. Not really associated with our show officially, but. That's why it's unofficial. Yeah, that's why. But Steve's doing it and he's doing a great job with that. Now, you're saying that one of the girls up there now is a prostitute. Yes. How do you know that? Allegedly. Allegedly. Well, no, not allegedly. No, this is for sure. And I can back up what I say. Well, how do you know? I know this girl. They're triple nipple, okay? All right. But don't say her name now. No, I'm not going to say her name. Okay. How do you know? Well, how do you first define prostitute? Okay. Well, getting paid for sex. Yeah. Like for real sex? Yes, constantly, every day. And I'm not going to say her name. I'm not going to say her name. I'm not going to say her name. I'm not going to say her name. I'm not going to say her name. I'm not going to say her name.

Because I do have some respect for myself. Did you think about doing it? Absolutely not. No, huh? No, absolutely not. All right. How much would it take? I wouldn't put it on nothing. I wouldn't take it. I wouldn't do it. Nothing? Maybe? No, no, no. I'd take that back. I wouldn't do it at all. You wouldn't be that good. All right, hold on. Becky wants to verify Sue's story. Let's bring Becky. It's like a party line. Yeah. Oh, Becky. Becky. Ba-ba-booey. Well. Wrong one. Wrong one. OK. Hold on. I've got to do this. I've got to screw the phones up. All right. Steve, so what are you thinking? You know something? How does this chick, what reason does she have for calling you guys up and saying stuff like this? Yeah. Why are you mad at this girl, Sue? That you would call her out like this? I'm not mad at the girl. I'm kind of mad at the girl. I'm kind of upset with you guys because you're letting somebody... I mean, I can't... We can't have background checks on everyone that is associated with the show. Yeah. All right. Well, I mean, I'm letting you in on it. I know you want me to verify. And our listeners all want to know how they could hire this girl for an hour. I swear to God. You want the website? No, we don't want the website. Well, I'm just telling... You know, you guys are too good for that. At least I think that. Is there a picture on the wall? Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure. You know, you guys are too good for that. At least I think that. Is there a picture on the website of being like a prostitute? Actually, okay, it's... There's prostitute websites now? No, it's a stripper site. That's their cover-up. Well, wait a minute. You just called her a prostitute five minutes ago. Well, it's a stripper site, but that's the cover-up. All right. A prostitute is a cover-up. They're in the yellow pages. All right. Well, Sue, thanks for bringing this to our attention. One of the girls associated with the girls of ONA is a prostitute. Allegedly. Allegedly. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're coming back from the station coming down with huge wow signs. You'll know who they are, find them, okay? And they'll bring you back to the station after you wow. No doubt. All right, bye. Take it easy, guys. You guys suck. All right, bye, Camille. All right, Anthony, the wow parade is about ready to leave the station. Yes. We have Psycho Mark. A bunch of psychopaths have shown up. One guy has this huge wow sign that lights up on his head. Yeah, it's got like a helmet and a big metal wow with lights in it and everything. It lights up wow. You're ready to leave, Psycho Mark? Yeah, did that girl just say she's wowing down at TRL? Yeah, I told her to look for you. Awesome. You're going to be outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, like right now. You're leaving, right? Right down stairs. And then you guys are going to march before TRL is over. Yep. Call us when you hit the street, Mark. All right. We'll check in with Psycho Mark next. Stay there. Keep your hands away from your pants. Ah, too late for that. And Anthony, some disappointment fed. It is more stupid to be on the way. 1027 WNEW. Hope you had a good day. Get the best way in and you guys can come up with. 1027 WNEW. Lots going on on the show today. Psycho Mark has left the building with some psychopaths. They're going to cause trouble somewhere on live TV, Anthony. Oh, yeah. We're hoping Psycho Mark checks in in a little bit here. They're going to be heading down to the MTV studios. There's a bunch of people down there. Yeah. They should be outside on 57th and 7th right now, right outside the Brooklyn Diner. The one guy has a huge wow sign attached to a construction hat. Yeah, like a hard hat. A hard hat, excuse me. Big sheet metal wow with lights in it. Looks pretty cool. Really lights up right. This could be him, but Spad, you got to... God damn it. It could be Psycho Mark on the line. But Spad decided to let the retard answer the phones for him. I guess not. Who is it? Once in a what? Oh, really? Why are they calling on the special line? We have a bunch of retards that still work here. I know. We have people that all you have to do, I'm telling you, is just show up to the show, say, hey, I'm here to see you, and you can be a psychopath. Oh, my God. And they allow you to come right down to the studio. And they're giving away the hotline that's really important to our radio show. It's just people that want to call in with stupid crap. Here, here, you want to get a hold of them? You know, call this number. Why are they doing that? Because they're stupid and they're retarded. Oh, boy. Why would you give out the special phone numbers for a radio show? Those are the numbers like Jay Moore uses and celebrities and stuff, you know? Hmm. See, they're out on the street. Psycho Mark! Yeah, what's up, guys? Where are you? The crowd is growing. We're walking down Broadway right now. We're at Broadway in 56. Yeah. And we got a bunch of people walking around. It's very crazy. Looks like they're protesting for something. People don't even know what we're doing. They're all looking at us. Is that one guy wearing his big shoes? He's just a hothead. Hold on. I'm going to take a quick look. Oh, my God. They're walking down. We all know that. They're walking down. We saw them for a second out the window. How many people are with you, Mark? Right now we've got about 15 guys with us. Okay. And actually it's growing as we're walking down the street. People are joining us. I'm kind of like the Five Viper here. Oh, very nice. Now where are you right now? Right now we're at 55th and Broadway. Okay. We're almost by the Letterman Theater. All right. And we'll be moving all the way right down to TRL. And we're going to aggravate the piss out of MTV again. Wait a second. Why is that line still... Why is he still talking to that perth? Thank you. Oh. See, now, you know, I swear to God I just want to walk and go home today. No one cares around here. They're giving out our special phone number to anyone. It just keeps ringing because some retard upstairs is giving everyone the number. Who gave them the number? Hey, Mark, sorry. Who's giving out the number? The retard upstairs. You're kidding me. You're kidding me. Oh! There are people beeping on the street. This is great. Good. How many more people have joined you, man? Four right now. I say almost 20 people right now. All right. And you're on Broadway. And what side streets there? Now we're down to 54th. 54th and Broadway. Hold on. Spaz got an explanation for me. Hold on. Yes, Spaz? Virginia, the receptionist upstairs is pissed that you're calling her a retard and she wasn't talking to you. The receptionist, I've saved your butt a lot of times. Hello? Because you bring a lot of whack. We officially call you a retard because you just gave out the phone number to everyone. You're live on the show, you idiots. I didn't give it out to anyone. You just said the number. We had to dump out. Who did I give it to? That's a definition of a retard. First of all, I didn't give it to... Do not give that phone number to anybody. No. This call stood out in the lobby. All right. Well, take it down. Why should I? I didn't put it there. My job is to sit here at the front desk. Right. I try to make it as nice and smooth for people to come downstairs. If you guys don't come up and take care of the people that are up in the lobby, you're going to have problems. If the phone is listed outside, you're going to have the whole world calling. I'm not a retard. I don't like anyone calling me a retard because I happen to be a very good receptionist. I've been here a lot longer than you guys have. I don't ever do that before. Bye. Hey, how did a computer get stolen from... Hello? Ah, she hung up. Retard. Did somebody let somebody in the building and they actually stole a computer right out of the... First of all, I didn't call her a retard by name. I was assuming that it was someone else taking her place, but she does let a lot of stupid people down to this floor. Oh, this is what we have to deal with. Oh, boy. Mark! Yeah? Hey, what's up? We just lost... There's Earl. Where is he going? He's recording. Everyone is. Oh, I'm having fun. There are people joining us and we've got people driving by. This is Clay. We've got people joining us as we speak. We've got to lay out and get to trouble. Hello? Hello? We're waiting to see you guys show up on the TV screen. We're down by 52nd right now in Broadway, so if you care to join us. We can't miss us. We've got about 12 huge signs and we're walking around like... Is this Diallo just got shot again? Oh, my God. You're doing your own little protest, right? What's that? You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. You're doing your own little protest. Yeah. All right. How many blocks away are you? You've got to be close to this point. We're real close. We're a four-block right now. All right. Why is everyone screaming? I think it's just like a party atmosphere, Opie. You can tell. They're freaking out. It's not a party. It's not a party. All right, Mark. I think we're losing your signal. It's a massive after. All right. So we suggest people meet you down there at TRL, huh? I'll check back in as soon as we're outside. Okay. See you later. Thank you. So now we've got people mad at us upstairs, it seems like, Opie. Well, I will be talking to someone about it in a professional manner. There are a lot of people that get through our tight security, Anthony. Well, the security is obviously a joke, and that is the problem. Security at this place blows. We had lawyers trying to serve us papers, and we told everyone, you know, don't let anyone in, and sure enough, we walk outside to get coffee, and we're being served with papers. They can't even do that right. Yeah. And there are people, and I didn't point anyone out up there, Virginia. That allow people to come down here, that give out our special phone numbers. Yeah. We have two or three special phone numbers for like, you know, very important people of the radio show. Like if Jay Moore wants to call in, he could call this number, and it's guaranteed it's going to be free. Right. So we're going to have to get people to come down here, and we're going to have to get people to come down here, and we're going to have to get people to come down here, and we're going to go down via this number, and it's guaranteed it's going to be free. Right. But there are people up there, and I didn't name them by name, that give out all these numbers. And there are people that do work the front desk that just allow anyone downstairs. Remember the wallet that got stolen out of here? And you know what they do? Then they make our life a living hell, a pain in the ass. Like what happened? just walked in one of the doors and stole someone's wallet or something, or pocketbook, and just walked right out. Walked in, walked out. What did they do? They battened down the hatches and wouldn't give us the codes to the doors. So, oh, don't let Opie and Anthony in. But anybody else, any kook that wants to just wimose down the stairs, feel free. Oh my God. What a mess. And why is any of our phone numbers posted outside the door of the station up there? It should just be the request line, that's all. No, it's our special line. So now we've got to get all new special lines. Hello, brother. I've got a receptionist yelling at me. Hey, she's been here longer than us. That's what it takes. Remember when we used to hear that? Yeah, from everybody. All the old timers try to pull that on us all the time. Been here longer. That's the prerequisite. Receptionist for what, 20, 30 years? Good. Got some serious career goals there. It's nice. Good to say. Oh boy. Much best. People want to apply for the receptionist job. Oh yeah? Yeah. I'm going to look into that maybe. A receptionist yelling at us. That's good. I love this company. All right, Mike, you're next. What's going on, man? I just listened to TRL. They said they're going to let a fan from outside interview Madonna. Oh really? Yeah, so when the WOW posse get on. Yeah, I don't see that happening. All right. All right, man. Thank you. All right, man. Bye. I think they're going to be very, very aware of the WOW people when they show up. Tony, what's going on? Hey, guys. Hey. Hey, I'm in a Astro van. I'm walking right next to the guys that are getting ready to WOW TRL. And my van's totally open. And if they get into trouble, they can bail out. Oh really? Oh yeah, waiting for them. Following them right now. They're not making do about just hanging out. You're right behind them? I'm right with them, walking right next to them. How many people? I'll have them screen for you. Hold on. Yeah. Hey, guys. I got them on the line. Screen. All right. The little parade is growing. Did you get that? There's about 15, 20 guys out there right now. How close are they, Tony? We're right here at the... Yeah, because they just went live. They're live right now. Yeah, we're at 46th and Broadway. You're just about there. All right. Tell Mark to call me back, okay? All right, no problem. All right, thank you. All right, guys. Bye. Let's go to Rob. Rob, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on, guys? How are you? Pretty good. Just watching a little TRL here. Still haven't seen any boobage. We're waiting to see Psycho Mark. He's just about there. He should be calling in any second. All right, cool. And hey, just think, at least the receptionist isn't letting Patty downstairs anymore. Sorry I had to bring that up. All right, thank you. Bye. I want to see the big lit up wow sign on the guy's head on TV. Hey, Mark, what's going on? We're at 46th and Broadway, and the window is in sight. Yes. Yeah, we're coming right down the street, and we're going to do our best to allow that nasty man down. Okay. So we're making our way right now in the middle of the... What's it called here? The middle of the street. I'm trying to get a hit by a bus. Yeah, don't get hit. So we're going to try and set ourselves up in the middle of the street, but there's tons of people down here. It's crazy. Yeah, they're live right now. I noticed that. We're calling you now! All right, all right, all right. We need to see you. All right, we're all right. I don't see you guys yet. You're right there, right, Mark? Yeah, I'm right outside right now. Oh, I see you. It was a quick shot of you. I saw the big sign. There it is, right there. All right. Right there, the whole Wild Parade is right in the middle of Carson Valley and Madonna. Wow, there's the bitch inside. Okay, very good. Oh, there's a picker over there. I think that's a good Wild Shot. Oh, no, no, no! They were right behind Madonna's butt. Big wow sign. Hey, Mark, how many signs are out there, man? What's that? How many signs are out there? We've got a bunch of signs as a matter of fact. Yeah. A bunch of crazy signs. All right, but... He's not standing out here. All right, watch out. You ran back here to stand in the middle. I'm just going to go across the street. That's all. What's the problem? The cops are out there. What's the problem? Uh-oh. They're getting a little awkward. Oh, boy. They're getting hassled. Come on. I'm trying to move us around. It's kind of funny. Come on, officers. Hey, Mark, what's happening? Well, anyway, there's got to be at least 3,000 or 4,000 people outside of MTV Studios. It's a complete zoo. We can push all the radio stations we're trying to drive to advance by, but I'm not doing a very good job of it. Yeah. And there's actually a bunch of people out there with wild signs. There was a couple trips across the state. We actually were really scared. She's going to be wild-tied, and hopefully then we can see some chance on TRL Live. All right. First thing, she's about to go back up live, and here we go. We're going to move. The cops are making us move. All right, you're live. You're live. Oh, there you are. I see the wow. Yeah. The wow right behind Madonna there. Uh-oh, they're harsher than I thought. We aren't surrounded by cops. They're making us get off the street. Oh, brother. Oh, that sucks. They're calling everybody cordoned off over here. It's pretty wild. Where's the girl with the wild sign? Let's hear her. Camille, where you from? Upstate New York. She's from Upstate New York. And you came all the way down here with the wild sign? Yup. I'm from Florida. She's calling me over. She's all the way from Upstate. She's got a big orange wild sign. Yeah, I saw that one, yeah. It's right below the window there. Let me try and cross the street and get some more camera shots over there. I'm going to ask you to turn around. All right. One side or the other? We're going to go to the other side of the street. Oh, boy. All right. It's a horrible, but we're just going to keep moving our way around here. All right, man. In front of all of your teeny boppers here. Madonna's still attracting teeny boppers? Hey, we might be on right now. Here we go. Here we go. Woo! He's got a little bacteria! He's got a little bacteria! Wild sign off, dude. They're doing tight shots. I see one of you guys raising your arms. That was pretty good. Yeah, I don't know if it's making it, but... Yeah, you guys are like on the very corner of the screen, Mark. Yeah, very tight security there for the Madonna appearance. All right, I'm out of here. I'm going to go stand on the sidewalk. I'm getting really nasty works from the cops. They're about to punch my teeth out. I'm going to get tuned up in about two seconds. Tuned up. Yeah, what's up? I'm Detective Tamiko. You're annoying my captain. All right, don't stop. You're going to lose the flag and you're going to get locked up. All right, use your head and be smart. The whole site can enjoy itself. All right. Stop walking around in the intersection with an asshole like yourself. Okay. What's your search on your side, Detective Tamiko? A mid-time shopper. Very good. Turn him on. Okay. You're going to get tuned up. You're going to get tuned up. He was all business, though. He's wearing a suit. He hasn't been wearing a uniform. He's not happy. Yeah, he didn't sound it. We'll have to stand here with the rest of the words. All right, Mark. Hang on. We'll check back in and go see what we can do. All right, very good. Psycho Mark reporting live from outside the MTV studios. It's a mob scene down there for Madonna. Thank you, Psycho Mark. Cops hassling him and everything. Goddamn. They're very serious about keeping traffic clear, I guess, or something. Hey, Jim, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? Not too bad. Good. These guys are great, man. I've seen that guy with the hat. Oh, you saw the hat guy on MTV? Yeah, he's right out of the corner right there. Yeah. Oh, that was great, man. All right, cool. Now, this is syndication now. You guys suck. All right, thank you, Jim. Bye. Let's go to Ron. Ron, you're next on N.E.W. Hey, Rowan, how you doing, guys? What's up? Hey, great. I'm glad to see you guys again.

I think we're going to play a couple songs and we'll be back. To clear the lines, let's give out some wrestling tickets, okay? All right. Winner receives a pair of tickets to the WWF Saturday, April 15th at the Garden. Before you can buy them, plus a WWF t-shirt. Tickets go on sale this Sunday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster. The 10th caller gets the ticks. 212-757-1027. This is N.E.W. We'll be back in two. My music is a crazy piece of shit. Oh, don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. Are you mental? No! It's our show! I'm a mad man! I'm getting pissed! Red Brom, you sound like a stock-braving mad person. No! It's being pissed! No! No! Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. No! Oh, be an Anthony. How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? 1027-WNEW. Ah, yes. Another fine program in progress today. Yes. Anthony's falling apart on me. Ah, you feel like crap, huh, Anthony? Well, you know, I don't normally get sick. That's why it's very strange you never get sick. Oh, I get this hack. This hacking cough thing is killing my chest. Uh, I just want to... Shoot. Chris, what's going on? What's up? How are you? You guys are great. I listen to you guys every day. Well, we're trying. Thank you, Chris. I was watching on a total crestwad. I raced right home from work, listened to you guys on the way home. I was watching right in the left-hand corner. I could see a big white painted song like a sheep. Yeah, I know. Psycho Mark and the Psychopaths out in full force down there at TRL today. And then all of a sudden you see the sheep go away. They pan the camera to the right, and there's two cops. I was like, oh, no way. Yeah, they kind of got in trouble. Oh, really? Yeah, a little bit. Oh, I figured as much. Cops don't move along. Well, thank you, Chris. I'm glad you saw that today. Yeah. All right, man. Dedication now. All right, bro. Let's go to James. James, you're next on NAW. What's going on? Yeah, congratulations, gentlemen. Those guys did a great job. The other side, on the right side where Madonna was standing, was totally empty. And then on the left side is a bunch of lunatics jumping around with a big white sign. Yeah, the hat of the man was standing there. Yeah, there had to be, what, about 20 of them or so, huh? It was a nice group. The opposite side of the camera angle was totally blank. There was no one there on that corner. But the other corner is just a bunch of lunatics. And then empty right here, they started doing real tight shots to keep them out of the frame. Yeah, yeah, I noticed that. The second you saw like a big white and red wow sign go up, that was it. They just kept them close. Cool, James. Nice job. I'm glad you saw that. All right, take it easy, guys. All right, man. Let's check in with Psycho Mark. He's on the warm line that the receptionist feels like giving everyone today. Mark, we got a live shot. Hey, what's up, guys? What's up, Psycho Mark? Oh, hey, Anthony. What do you sound a little sick? Sounds like full blown AIDS. Jesus. There he is, man. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. So what's going on out there? We've got about 20 guys out here. And there's a live shot, I guess, across the street here. They're trying to get in. Oh, really? We've got like 20, 25 little guys out there. And they're trying to get in. Oh, really? We've got like 20, 25 little guys out there. And there's a live shot, I guess, across the street here. They're trying to get in. Oh, really? We've got like 20, 25 lunatics just absolutely out of their mind, running around here with big wild signs. And it's just nuts. As a matter of fact, they stopped TRL, so it's like we're sort of standing around looking for something to do. Yeah, I know. You guys got to find some trouble. Yeah, well, they're looking for a live shot, but there's nothing going on down here. But you should have seen all the cash down here from the bottom. It was unbelievable. Well, they had a great crowd out there today. Yeah, no, it worked out well. I guess the cops shut us down pretty quick. Yeah. Because you know how they are. But they're doing their job. Those guys are good guys. What's the age bracket of the typical Madonna fan these days? Like 12. Really? You're still getting teeny-boppers? That's a little weird. It's mostly teeny-boppers. A lot of gay guys? And I didn't see any gay guys. No? But there's tons of chicks. It was unbelievable. We horrified so many people because these guys are chanting, you know, show us your blue nut, you know, and whip them out and scream like crazy. And I'm like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And I'm like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And I'm like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? And they're like, what the hell? It was nuts. Well, you guys got to continue the... Yeah, we got to go on TV, guys! It was nuts. We're all going to get arrested. Well, Mark, the psychopaths are growing as we speak, huh? It is pretty wild. It is a lot. Alright. Oh, my God. Alright, guys, we'll check back in later. Alright, Mark. We'll have a couple of these lunatics back to the stage. Thank you. Want me to give them out the VIP number? No, I think people have it already. Oh, God. Alright, Mark, we got to go. We need to go, baby! Alright, Mark. Peace. Oh, bunch of lunatics. You sure you want them back here? That would give me a headache, Anthony. I know. I already have one. Yes, I do. Syndication now, that's a joke. Every other show that started this week on any W was already syndicated. Yeah, I know. Not us. No way. No, that's not too frustrating for your pals, Ophid and Anthony. Well, there's a reason. We're loose cannons, Ophid. Not team players. We were trying to be team players yesterday, and they don't know what to do with us. But, yeah, we weren't wanted. But we did try. Let's go to Douglas. Douglas, what's going on, man? What's up, Ophid? How are you? Alright, check it out. Go to CBS Studios outside. There's nobody around to show live shots. Oh, dude, that's our company. So? We're in enough trouble, believe me. Like, we need that. Green Day's coming around? When are we getting them in here? Yeah, we should get Green Day in. They're good friends. They had a blast last time we were hooked up with them. We ruined our studio, but a lot of fun. You remember that? Yeah. We had Green Day. Last time we talked to Green Day, they were just drinking beers and smoking dope, and we allowed them to just start breaking CDs. Yeah. And they broke our huge clock in the studio. They threw a CD right through the clock face. Yeah, they like their pot. That's for sure. They're going to be on the Warped Tour this summer, Anthony. Yeah. Alright, cool. We'll hook up with them. Alright. Enough with the wow on TRL. I think we covered that. Yeah. We appreciate that you guys checked it out. Moving to California. How can we lose listeners? I hate that. Hey, Jill. Yeah. What's going on? Hi. I was just wondering, how come a guy like Tom Lycus can be syndicated, but you guys can't? I don't know. That blows my mind. I don't know. Hey, listen, what about women with like, you know, you have like Hummer Tuesday and all that? Yeah, we're trying to find something for you ladies. I know what you're going to say. We just haven't found anything that's catching on yet. How about like Finger Friendly Friday? Finger Friendly? That sounds pretty good. How about Finger Paint Friday? Sure. We'll figure something out for you ladies eventually. Alright, guys. Thank you, Jill. Thanks. Bye-bye. We've got to say goodbye to Judy. She's moving to California. Judy? Yes? Where are you going? Oh my God. I didn't think my phone call warranted being put on the air, but... No, we don't like when people leave, so we've got to figure out why you're going. I'm going because I've been living in New York all my life in 27 and I've got to get out. Now, my brother and sister live in LA, so I'm going to move out there. LA, are you going to become a porn star? I don't think so. What are your dreams when you go out to LA? What are you going to do? I thought you were right, actually. You want to write like in porno movies? I could. I'm just saying, any girl that goes out to LA... I guess I could. ...for any career in the arts... Uh-huh. ...always ends up somehow in pornography. I guess I could. I don't know if I'm that desperate, though. You just need a new start out there? Yeah, I don't know. I wouldn't move out there unless they were out there, so... You're not a co-core or anything? No, no, no, I've never done that. Uh-uh. No, but I just love you guys. I've been listening to you since day one, and I'd like to get a T-shirt and just advertise for the show. When are you going? Next month. Well, come on by and get your T-shirt. Well, I'm kind of up in the suburbs. Are you? It's kind of hard, yeah. All right, hold on. Let me see if Ben could send you a shirt off. Thank you very much. All right, and good luck in California. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Do you have any plans, Opie, for when we go to California on the 1st? We're going out there for WrestleMania. Yeah. Well, you've got to go to the Comedy Store, check out the... Uh-huh. Check out the acts. Yeah, I'm hoping to see Dice there again. Mm-hmm. Bomb. And, well, I got a couple of plans. You do? I'm going to rent a car, go down to my old stomping ground of San Juan Capistrano, right there where the Swallows come back every year, and I think I'm going to make a serious effort to look for Dreamweaver. And see if we can't get her on the air. Are you serious? Why not? Do you know who she is? Yeah, I think so. I think I got a couple of people that I might be able to contact that could get me in touch with the actual Dreamweaver. And you think she's still living in the area? I don't know. I want you to get a hold of... Buzz? Oh, Buzz, right? Girl, that took your virginity away from you? Yeah, yeah. When I was like 13 or 14 or something. The girl that your dad set you up with? Yeah, yeah, Buzz. I don't know. She was like 22 at the time or something. That's a while ago now. So she'll be, yeah. But she's got to be in the area. I would love to talk to the girl that took your virginity. I'll see if I... I'm going to definitely try to get in touch with some of these people, get some numbers at least, so we can talk to them. Right. You know, dredge up a little of my sordid past. Because the Buzz story is classic. You were what, 13? 13 years old, 13th birthday, as a matter of fact. My father thought, you know, he's from the mindset that at 13 years old, you got to get your son laid, you know? So he leaves, leaves the house and sends Buzz over. Did he pay her? No, Buzz has been a friend of the family's and stuff, you know? Like, you know, she'd bang anyone. So she's there hanging out. You know, I've been riding all day, a little dirty. She goes, oh, why don't you go up and take a shower? I'm like, oh, okay. Oh, okay. I'll shower then. Not thinking anything. I just run upstairs, hop in the shower. I get out of the shower. Got my little shorts on. I'm only, you know, 13 years old, Ophie. Ready to walk back down the stairs, watch some TV with Buzz. And I hear from the bedroom, are you coming in? Like, hmm, that's weird. That sounds like Buzz from the bedroom. I wonder what Buzz is doing in the bedroom. I just got out of the shower. I was going to go downstairs, watch some TV, Buzz. Oh, oh, no. Oh, my God. This is it. Finally clicked in my head. This is it. Walked in. Just remember seeing Buzz. She had huge hands, huge. She was sitting, like sitting up in the bed, dropped up by some pillows. And the sheet was right at her hips. And her huge boobs were just hanging out in the open. It was the most remarkable thing I'd seen in my life at that point. They're just there going, take me, Anthony, take me. Everything else I had seen up to that point has been in magazine or some cheesy film. This was like live boobage. I was just like, oh, oh, my goodness. Oh, here we go. This is going to be it. And yeah, you never forget the first time you see live boobs. Hopped into bed. She's like, you know, she starts moving her hands. Kind of over me and stuff like, oh, OK, that's good. She moves down further, further. And then she goes for the grab and she has to go, why don't you take those shorts off? Dude, I got into bed still with the shorts on. What a tool. What do you remember from that first experience? I mean, how long did last? Just the best thing ever, ever, ever, ever. It wasn't a two second thing because I think I think I was spanking it in the shower. I'm not knowing that anything's going to happen. I don't remember really any details. I mean, it was cool and all, you know, and then I went off to school the next day. What did you do right after? Right after? Yeah, did she like leave or something? I smoked a cigarette. Yeah, yeah. You said you go back to playing with your Hot Wheels or something. Hot Wheels? Hot Wheels? I wouldn't be playing with a Hot Wheels. You know what I'm saying though. At 13 you're still like, well, I think I just went. I'm heading toward being an adult kind of, but I'm also still a kid. It must have been a little weird. I think I went back downstairs and watched some TV. Yeah. You know, I think I watched. Did she quickly leave or was it just that awkward? No, she kind of hung out on the couch, watched a little TV. Yeah. I was like, okay, hey, look at that. This is great. Okay, watch Bob Bob Black Sheep. My fingers smell funny. You had to go there. Why? They did. Marissa, come on, the first time you're just like a dog at that point. Come on, smell my finger. That continued for a while too, like about a year. Marissa, what's going on? Hey, how are you? Hey. That's a sick little story of just nothing really. Oh, it's not even a story. It's just, I don't know, you guys are just so visual. I don't know. Look at that. Where are you right now? In my car. Really? Yeah. It sounds like a prank. What? It kind of sounds like a prank. Trust me. We've heard enough Bob-o-Booies today. No, you want to know something? Tell it. F-Mackey. I listen to them in the morning, but that's just, it's getting lame, getting old. I don't know, there's just something about you guys. I just, whenever I hear your voices, I just want to touch myself. All right. That's pretty good. We like that. Wow, wow. What are you wearing now? Well, I have thigh-high stockings on. I'm wearing a thong. I've got my suit on for work. Are you a hooker? No. I'm not. I'm closing my eyes so I don't have to look at Anthony while you describe yourself. All right, go ahead. I'm far from a hooker. Continue. I actually... I was getting really distracted. I'm like, I have to close my eyes. Okay. What kind of body do you have? I'm about 5'5". Yeah. 115. Oh yeah. I'm very athletic. I run very limber. I'm a little muscular, but I'm very small-framed. Uh-huh. And you're all turned on as you're in your car on the way home? I'm sitting here on the highway with one hand between my legs... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. ...and the other hand holding the phone. Wow. You must be driving real slow. Actually, no. I'm stepping really hard on the accelerator. Yeah. Now, what part of the Tri-State area are you in? New Jersey. Jersey? Mm-hmm. I would love to get out of your car so everyone could check you out. Why? Are you like... What are you doing besides that? You're like... Well, I'm actually driving home from work. And you're petting the poodle? I don't have much of a poodle to pet. Oh, really? Yeah, it's pretty close-crop. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. See, I'm an accountant, and I wear very, very sexy underwear under very, very conservative suits. All right, listen. Kind of like a little secret I have. You're killing me. Not as much as you kill me. Well, tell me more. Mm-hmm. All right, well, what's she gonna do? She gonna do it right there in the car? I'm going through my handbook right now, seeing what we could get away with. Don't crash. Well, what do I do? Well, could you give us like a fake orgasm? Sure. Of course it would be fake. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh. Oh. Marissa, you suck. I knew she was gonna do that. What'd she do, hung up? She hung up. She crashed. Marissa, you're a C.T. I hate you. Ah. She got us good, man. She hung up. These guys want to kill her. Ah. Bob, what's going on? Ah, that chick, man. You know, I wanted to play What's in My Pants with this broad on the phone. Yeah, I was gonna ask her that next, but she hung up. Oh, my God. Hey, boy. She got us good right there, man. I can't believe it. Let's review the list of people that have said, I've been here longer than you. Yeah. Everyone has said that to Aunt Naya one time or another. Let's see. There's Scott Munny, Dave Herman, a retired receptionist, and, uh... Carol Miller. Carol Miller. Yeah, Carol Miller. You know, let's see. Where are all they? Well, we were supposed to be fired four months into this job, and miraculously, we're up to a year and nine months today. A year and nine months today? Yeah. Oh, my goodness. It's been that long. It just seems like yesterday that you two came on and started terrorizing the city, as it were. Yeah, well, we're trying. All right, guys. Syndication yesterday, and I hope to see you on TV sometime. All right, Bob, thank you. Bye. We gotta get to some of these guys that are really pissed off. Larry, what's up? What a be-odd. Oh, man. She set us up bad. Oh, man. She got you guys good, but you fell into it, you know? I had a feeling something was going on there. Couldn't you tell she wasn't on her cell phone? No. No? To be honest with you, no. It was clear as day. It sounded like her cell phone a little bit. What was that? Kind of sounded like her cell phone. No, come on. She was pulling your third leg. You know, Larry, it still sounded pretty cool. I don't care. Oh, listen, I enjoyed it. She had a good little visual mind going there. Yeah, it wasn't bad at all. All right. You knew when she was getting descriptive like that. Yeah. You knew it was a hoax. That's all right. At that point, you had to jump boat. All right, Larry. Thank you. Let's go to Jim. Jim, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on? What's going on, guys? How are you? Good. Excellent, man. Yeah, I got a chubby. Where'd she go? She hung up on it. Come on. She got me a mid-stroke. I had a feeling she was up to something, but it was still pretty cool. Yeah, these new radio guys I listened to in the morning. I was listening to Lycus on the way to work, and I changed that over. I heard these guys this morning. Love Lines? They were pretty funny. We've had Love Lines. I love Love Lines for a while. Yeah? They had a good one. Douchebag? Douche-nozzle? Are you trying to prank us, Jim? No, not at all. Come on, guys. I'm a long-time listener. What's a douche-nozzle? Yeah, I don't get what you're getting at. Well, that's what they were saying last night. Everybody says douchebag, douchebag. What about douche-nozzle? I guess you ought to be there. All right, guys. Peace out. Syndication yesterday. All right, Jim. Let's go to Rain. Oh, my God. Rain, what's going on? Is it raining? It's raining. It's raining. It's raining. Rain, what's going on? Is it me? Is the medication making my mind work a little weird? I'm hearing different things that are actually happening on today's show, I hope. I think you're a step slow. We're both a step slow today. I'm not sure. Is it the callers or is it me? I don't know. Rain, what's up? Hey, guys. How are you? All right, man. Hey, man, you guys are killing me out here with this girl moaning and groaning, man. Yeah, Tyler. Damn, they almost ran my truck off the road. Well, let's try to get her back on the line to finish what she started, all right? Definitely. But you know, I'm out here trying to make deliveries. You know, it's hard not delivering keggers. Right. He delivers keggers. Yeah, I got the re-deliver keggers sign right here on my front windshield. But it's been a long time. My listener has been going back to healthy, very first show there. All right. And Anthony was describing the radio. So the radio between his... What? All right, Rain. Rain, I'm going to cut you off, OK? Yeah, yeah, I lost it here. Sorry, guys. I think the medication is really affecting me. Every caller sounds completely frigging retarded. Amos! Yeah. How's Andy? Huh? What's up, Amos? Nothing much. All right. I was seeing you guys all the time coming home from work. Yeah, we appreciate that. I tried to get to that... We get that by now. I don't think we need to bring that up with every call. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So what's up, Amos? Nothing much. I tried to get to that show that you guys had last week. Yeah. It was... Too many people were there. I know. We apologize. We're going to get a bigger venue for the next one. Oh, definitely. What do you have for today? I just wanted to say what's up. Oh, my God. All right, Amos, thank you. Hey. I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but we're trying to do a radio show here. I just want to say what's up. Hey, what's up? Joe, what's going on? Joe, what's up? How are you? I'm good. I wanted to thank you guys. Last night, I earned my Red Wing because of you guys. How did that happen? Why did you have to do that? Because I was in the middle of the night. I was in the middle of the night. I wanted to go take care of business down there. She didn't want it. She wasn't having it, so I convinced her that you guys were into it. You thought it was cool. It was nice, whatever. And lo and behold, I earned my Red Wing. I earned my Red Wing. I earned my Red Wing. I earned my Red Wing. I earned my Red Wing. I earned my Red Wing. I earned my Red Wing.

little bit Well, what I think, well, walking around two in the morning by yourself, you know, anybody could be in danger. Right. Whether you're in the black or white. Who would be in more danger? I don't know. I'd have to go with the white person. Well, I think, you know what? I would say a female would be in more danger whether she was black or white. I wouldn't even say a man. Right. I'm just saying some areas are a little more dangerous than others. That's known. That's true. There's more crime in certain areas than other areas. It's just happens. Vanjie, a cop wants to talk to you. OK. Hey, Joe. Yeah. Hey, Joe. Wait, wait, wait, Joe. Before you start, believe or not, Vanjie's kind of a friend of the show, so try to keep it on the up and up. I know you want to like strangle her, but Joe, go ahead. Talk to Vanjie. How do you explain that a hammer is in the weapon? If a guy's... I didn't say a hammer was in the weapon. No, no, no, Joe. I said... If a guy's weapon up in the air is going to hit somebody, would you expect the cop to jump ten feet and then tackle him? Why does that sound delicious, Joe? Or just point the gun at him and shoot him? I mean, what's going to save the person's life? Trying to... Oh, well, you know, I couldn't jump ten feet and I'm sorry. Well, now you're dead, but if I would have shot you, I know I would have stopped you from killing somebody. I mean... I could have shot him in the knee or something. They don't train us to do that. You are supposed to shoot to kill. Actually, if you're going to shoot to stop somebody from killing you, you're going to be shot in the knee. You're going to be shot in the knee. You're going to be shot in the knee from taking someone's life or the life of another, you know, they're trained to shoot to kill. That's what we're trained for. The big target. Oh, I just thought that... Center mash, and that's it. Someone could have circled behind him and tackled him or something. It's not a movie. You know, they don't circle behind you. You flank, do a flanking maneuver. No, you put your gun out, you shoot him. It takes a lot for a cop to pull out a gun, first of all. No, I know. That's when you kill somebody, so it's traumatic. If they're going to pull out their gun, they're going to shoot you. If they're going to pull out their gun, they can't fool around. I know. They have made a serious decision that's probably going to affect them for the rest of their lives as well. Absolutely. Okay, Joe, I don't have a problem with you. I just was very offended that you thought that we could have done something else. Well, please, Joe, don't be offended. I wasn't even there, you know, and I'm just going by what, you know, everyone else heard in the public of what happened in the thing. The guy had his arm up in the air with the hammer and he was about to strike somebody. Yeah. Okay. And, you know, from that scenario, I would have shot the guy. Okay, Joe, where are you at the cop? In New Jersey. Where? In New Jersey. Oh, Jersey. Yeah. Okay. Well, you weren't there either, were you? No, I just said that. We're all going on what we know from reading about it, Vangie. Oh. Mm-hmm. Just like you. You weren't there either, right? No. You made your decision on what you read and so am I and so was Joe, obviously. Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, you know. The guy was a raging lunatic, you know, when that all went down. Yeah. God knows what he was going to do with the hammer. Oh. And I'm sure the cops said a few times, you know, put the damn hammer down. Yeah, they did say that. But what do you think he was going to do, sell it like soar or something? I don't know. I just thought you should rethink things before you say something like that. Vangie, in all honesty, I think you could kill a person with a hammer pretty easily. I'm sure you could. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You know? But I mean, you can kill a person with a gun faster. Yeah, but it's not about that. Oh. You let the guy loose, you know, he's a stark, raving lunatic, loose on the gun, and you can kill him with a hammer. Yeah. And if you hit him on the streets with a hammer, someone's going to get hurt. That's true. The whole thing, the whole thing, yeah. And it doesn't take, you know, much to kill somebody. One strike could pretty much do it. Yeah. Yeah, if you hit him in the right place. So. If you hit him right in the top of the head or anywhere in the head, you're going to kill him. Mm. Okay. All right. All right, Joe. Well, I'm sorry if I offended you, okay? All right, Joe. That's all right, Vangie. You offend someone. I mean, you know, that's what I'm saying. I'm just saying that it's unfortunate that, I don't know, these kind of crazy things happen, and I think that some people sort of overreact a little bit. Well, you know, there's fear. There's a little panic, you know. There's tragedies that take place, unfortunately. Yeah. Well, anyway, like I said, wait until the trouble dies down and come and do a broadcast here at Harlem. We're still into doing a broadcast in Harlem. Oh, great. All right. We did promise to do one first, though, on Venus. Yeah. We did promise to do one first, though, on Venus. All right. We did promise to do one first, though, on Venus. We have to do that first. Oh, OK. But right after the Venus broadcast, we're coming on. And then Mars? And then Mars, and then us. Oh, yeah. Mars, too, yeah. I think we're about 20 years away from, you know, being able to get to Venus, so. Yeah. Well, how about just some place in Manhattan? Somewhere in the year 2021. Yeah, and we'll be in Harlem. Right after the temperature in hell reaches 32 degrees. Right. Please, what's just some place in Manhattan that I can get to that I don't have to take the Long Island Railroad and stuff? If any place down in the village or something. All right. All right. OK. Well, thank you, Vanjie. OK. You guys take care. All right. Bye. Bye. OK. We got to take a break. Anthony? All righty. Want to thank Vanjie for checking in? Yes. It's always good to get up all sides of a story. You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now. B. OB. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B.

Now a girl, it's kind of like where the older brothers type of thing, you know what I mean? That's what it is. But if we talk to a girl like that, it's going to be like, oh my God, you're a frigging pervert. Right. You talk to a kid like that, it's like, yeah, like Ope said, like an older brother. Tracy, you're right, it's a fine line. I mean, we could get in a lot of trouble talking about sex with underage people in general. Oh, you should see the trouble you get in for having sex with the underage. Never mind talking. Yeah, I know, 17 will get to 20. I know. So, well, we're just trying to do the best we can here. Okay. I still love you guys. Well, thank you, Tracy. All right. Hi, Cesar and Raul. See you guys later. All right. Bye. Let's go to Mike. Cesar and Raul. Raul. Mike, what's up? Yo, Y1A. Hey. Another cop checking in. That's it, bro. The cop show today. Now, I just want to pass along some information. Yeah. Venge was on the phone talking about, couldn't you sneak around the guy? Couldn't you jump on him? It's proven statistically that a guy with a knife 10 feet away from you, which is not a very big distance, he comes after you with a knife, you're a dead man, even if you have a gun on your side, because you don't have the chance to react that fast. I would like these people to walk a mile in our shoes for once, you know? And see, like you said, cops don't just pull their guns out arbitrarily. You know, I mean, it's an amazing decision, but it's something that's going to change everybody's life when it happens. And they think we just like whooping at our guns, and it's like the OK Corral every time we come up against somebody, you know? Yeah. I'd like to hear a little more gunfire in the city, to tell you the truth. Well, I'm a cop in Jersey, so I'm not in New York all the time, but when I come in, you're damn right I got a gun on my hip. All right. But anyway, long time listener. Love you guys. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hey, can we get the psychopaths in here, Mark? Why are you filming me, man? I know, I look like crap. Whatever, I look like a fag. I don't care. How would you know what a fag looks like, Mark? Hey, we got two guys, two more psychopaths in the studio. Brought some, what's in that brown paper bag? Present. Could I unveil the present? Yeah, you can unveil the present. Sure. Something tells me it's shaped like beer. Anthony, you can't have this today because you're sick. What is that? Oh, some candy. Oh, yes. Look at you. We only get the meds for you guys. Very nice. Thank you. We were told we were going to get hooked up with prizes, and we didn't want to bring anything. That'll be kind of cold out for my cough, I think, right? Yes. That'll seal it. Very good, thank you. Well, we award the psychopaths. These are the guys that were on Channel 7 last night. We brought a sign list. Let me see the sign. I want to make sure it was you guys. Definitely. That was the sign we saw on TV. Oh, yeah. You guys, you've got to get smaller signs, though. Only like the W and half the O was on TV. This thing's like 20 feet long inside. In fact, we're primary colors. We couldn't sell it on eBay, so we made a sign out of it. You guys were little TV stars last night. Yep, that was great. They're old. We definitely appreciate it. If you guys get on TV with the wow sign, we invite you down here, and we give you a ton of stuff for doing it. A little tour of the studio and a couple of valuable prizes. We were hanging out with Spaz. We have a lot more respect for him now. Oh, really? That goes away. It's amazing. He works hard. People don't think so, but he does. What's your name? What's who you want to talk about? Okay, please hold. My name is Spaz. F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music. No, F-O- get a pen. What's the matter with you? It's Stinky, my new employee. Go to Associating. Get Anthony Hammett to his time here. I'm delegating responsibility. I don't even know what that means. What's your names? We should get your names on the radio. My name's Kevin. Hey, Kevin. What's up? I'm Glenn. Thanks for helping out the show. We appreciate it. We blew off all our jobs to come in. Oh, really? Cool. We say them and stuff. Yeah, go ahead. Say whatever you want. I work at a local paper called the Monclerian in Montclair. That's how I happen to be. The Monclerian? Yeah. What do you do there? I'm the advertising director. Cub reporter? No. I'm the major metropolitan newspaper. He's got a little pad pencil that walks around all day. Like Jimmy Olsen. I also work at Time Warp Comics in Cedar Grove. Oh, nice. Yeah. Like a comic book store? Yeah, great comic book store. All right, I got a problem. I just got a problem. Any guy that works in a comic book store always looks like a kid toucher. I work there one day a week just to get my own books. I got Pokemon, honey. You get over here. Yeah. That's in the back room. Yeah. Oh, there's a special section in the back. I'm a waiter at Benegans in Parsippany. All right. And a student at actually the school that we're on TV. Benegans. Montclair. Yeah. You have plenty of flair on your uniform. Yeah, exactly. No, we're not like Fridays and all, all over the place. Yeah, you don't want your buttons and stuff. And stuff, no. I don't like that. So, thanks for having us. You should just have a button that says like, twat on there, you know? And just come out, like mixed in with all the cute little buttons that people wear when they're working. I give you 35. Like Fridays. Just twat. Yeah, all right. Try that. I wear the one name tag, it says just my name on it, but everything else is just whatever. We're also directors in Durang One Eye Festival downtown in April. It's at the New York Comedy Club first and second weeks in April. Cool, yeah. Yeah, One Eye. Cool? Yeah. Well, we want to thank you guys for coming by. We appreciate it. You've got to follow this guy. He's going to like completely hook you up with stuff. You can hang for the rest of the show, all right? Great, thanks so much for having us in. All right, man. We appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Enjoy the beer. Thank you. We will. Yes, we always do. Anthony, know who else is here? Remember Make Bridget Cry? Yeah. Yeah. Bridget is here? Bring her in, man. Where's Bridget? Here, give her that mic over there. Wow, Bridget. Hey, Bridget. Are you weepy today? I was. Why are you? Well, let's get everyone up to speed. Bridget called the show, what, three, four months ago now? Not that long. Was it that long ago? Like three months ago? Yeah, about three months ago. All right, and you want to tell the story again? No. See, she's ready to cry. You're an emotional girl. Just tell the story again. It'll sound better coming from you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. See, we didn't think you were for real. Now that I see you in our studio, you're definitely for real. Yeah. All right. Oh, my gosh, I feel bad for her. I was going out with a guy for about a year, and it was... Before you start? Yeah. Could someone get me the megaphone? Okay, go ahead. Oh, no. Spaz, get the megaphone. I thought Tyson was sick today. This is too good. Okay. No, I'll be nice. Go ahead. How did that story go? Going out with a guy for a year. How old are you, Bridget? Twenty today. Twenty today? It's her birthday. It's my birthday. That's why I came here. Happy birthday. No, no, no. Birthday. I'm going to continue your story. What happened? You know, I'm usually not into redheads, but you're definitely cute. I'm into redheads. You're a redhead. I know. That's why I'm not into redheads. I know. That's why I'm not into redheads. That's actually... But go ahead. Okay, Bridget, your story. Bridget, B-Y... Twenty years old today. All right. Right. I hadn't done anything really with him. This was a guy you really, really liked, right? Yeah. Like, you still like him now? No. Oh, no. You sure? I'm sure. Okay. There's a bunch of guys that want to play Make Bridget Cry on the line already. Okay, so you were really into this guy at the time. I called here because I wanted to do something nice for him for his birthday. And Anthony was kind enough to give me some instructions. Well, he kind of suggested that your hob is not. Anthony's a freaking pervert. All right. And so I did. And the instructions were very good. Yeah, we even gave you step by step how to go about it, right? Which was very useful. Okay. And I got to the end and he freaked out. All right, but this was the first time you ever gave him a homer, right? Right. Okay. And he freaked out when you were done? He freaked out. Uh-huh. He called me a whore. He called you a whore? And then what did he do? And then very much in Iron Mike style, he threw me backwards. Walked out? And that was it? Threw you backwards and called you a whore? Well, that's despicable. I can't believe this guy. What a... I would like to punch him. He called you a whore and pushed you? And didn't even punch you. What kind of man is that? Shut up! So then you calmed up, Opie and Anthony, and started woohoo! My boyfriend called me a whore and pushed me down. But you know something? You're a whore! What are you doing? Putting that in your mouth, you don't know where it's been. Shut up! So you like doing that kind of thing? Why don't you come over to Iron Mike, pull down the fly, and unleash ten inches of Louisiana black snake? It's got a mind of its own. Alright, listen. It'll call you a whore and push you. Or by itself. It's easier to do this when she's on the phone. She really looks like she's trying to cry. Come on. I'm working on it. I'm okay. Listen to the story now, Anthony and Mike. Baby, baby, stick your head in gravy. Wash it off with bubble gum and punch you in the uterus. She's laughing. She was supposed to be here at 4.30. So Bridget, what happened? I missed my exit for the tunnel. And I took the George Washington instead, which I thought would be fine. Even though I'd seen New York pass a while before that. And so I figured once I took the George Washington I could just hop on a road and drive here. I'm going to get a little closer. Make her believe it's your boyfriend. No, I mean, you can't really hear. You just missed a great part of the story. A lot of people are going, oh my God. She was on the George Washington and figured I'll just turn off anywhere and find my way to the station. Oops. Exactly. So I realized it was kind of a bad neighborhood. The default road anywhere leads you to the bad neighborhood. When you get lost in New York, you will always end up in a bad neighborhood. Right. Which I thought was fine, but it just kept getting a little worse. Yeah. And then I stopped seeing street signs because they were all torn down. Translation. Dr. Dockher. At which point I called you guys for help. And, was it Kevin? Spazzy. Spazzy. I'll talk in. It's good I'll talk in. And? And he's saying? Drive until you don't see anymore black people. That's my help. Were you really scared? I was pretty scared. Yeah, people kept walking up to the car every time I stopped at a red light. Yeah. Wow. What'd they want? I don't know. I ran a couple red lights. I got really scared. You ran red lights. That's good. Very good. You learned very quick. That's what we do. Yeah. Wow. But then I got here. It was okay. Yeah. You're okay now? I'm okay now. You have a boyfriend now or anything? No. No. Sure. Yeah. Just want to try and see what your mindset is here. Would you like to play a quick round of Make Bridget Cry? I mean they're all waiting. Sure. Oh no. Are you serious? No, sure. All right. I don't think I'll cry. All right. Let's take a quick break and we're going to play another round of Make Bridget Cry. They're all waiting. We'll be back in a couple minutes. Stay there. Hey Anthony Pizano of Mulberry Street and the heart of Little Italy. We love it. I'm going. I was going to go tonight but I'm feeling a little under the weather. Yeah. But I think I'm probably going tomorrow. Yeah. I've been there in a couple weeks. I love Pizano's. I get the fried ravioli appetizer and then I'll get like a stuffed veal or the pasta with the meat sauce. Oh. See now I've got to go tonight maybe. I'm starving and I love Pizano's. Great atmosphere and they take Harry a service. Fantastic. A place for a date or to take the family. Mm-hmm. Pizano. And I think Joey's going to be a father like any day at this point. He might be a father as we speak. Yeah. I hope we find out. An heir to the Pizano throne. That's right. And if you do go to Pizano don't forget to ask for Joey the owner. Tell him Opie and Anthony sent you. He will give you a glass of wine on the house. Okay. Yes. We've turned on a lot of people to Pizano and everyone has a great, great time down there. Yeah. All right. Pizano, Mulberry Street and the heart of Little Italy. Give them a call for reservations. 965-1188. That's 965-1188 for Pizano. A gigantic boombox is coming down. Hand me the RPG7. 1027 WNEW. In the studio this afternoon, Bridget, the famous Bridget from Make Bridget Cry. She wants to play around and make Bridget cry for her 20th birthday. We did ask her. A bunch of our listeners want to play What's in Bridget's Pants as well. Oh really? Are you willing to play What's in Bridget's Pants? Like they guess? Huh? Like they guess? Yeah. We guess. What are the choices? Triangle, Mohawk, Hitler mustache and wood floor. Well, we've got to get her on the phone. Call up... Yeah, call up... No, no, no, I don't want to do it with the phone. How do you want to do it? I thought you were just going to ask. I mean, she was just going to get it. Well, we need to like, you know, hear something so we can make an educated guess. Yeah. More of a clue, kind of a hint thing, you know? No one will be in the room with you. No. No. I bet whatever it is, it's fiery red though, right? Fire in the hole. Right? Yeah, gotta be. Of course. Yes. Alright, set her up on the phone. You have her word, you'll have complete privacy. We won't. We won't peek. Except for the hidden camera in the drop ceiling. Yeah, right. She's going into the J-More suite. We're going to have to install the hidden camera. Yep. Any room is the J-More suite. She's a hot little number, what? What are you saying, Mark? Nothing, I bet that phone's going to smell good. Oh, Jesus, Mark. I bet she can drink. Well, she's Irish. That's what I mean. Alright, let's see. Hello, hello, hello. Oh? Yeah. Alright, I'm in Mark's studio. Alright, Spaz, thank you very much. I'm going to hear the phone. Alright. Spaz, guard the door so she feels safe. I will block the door. Okay. Bridget's very hot, 19. Not an ounce of body fat. I'm 20. 20 today. 20th birthday. Wow, it talks. Oh, I thought you had the phone down there already. Very tight body, tight abs, nice little boobies. What size are you? What? What size are your boobs? 34B. Yeah, they're nice boobies. Okay, what? Spaz, right in front of the door. Yeah, but Spaz turned away, God damn it. Yes, he turned away. Oh, well then, don't worry about it. You sure? Did you lock the door from your side? Well, he's standing right in front of it. They'd have to move him. Honestly, Spaz is not going to move. If we tell him not to move, he won't move. You've got to believe us. So, you've got a cute little skirt on. Okay, hold on. What kind of panties you got on? It's a thong. Wow, look at that. It's rock. Okay. Okay, hold on. Ready? Alright, are we playing the game now? What's in Bridget's pants? We're playing it. I'd like you guys to be doing this, I have to say. Okay, ready? What, you want us to do it? No, no. No, I really like you guys for me to be doing this. Oh, okay, that's obvious. Okay, ready? Yes, we're ready. Is that good enough? It was kind of hard to hear. Are you using the right part of the phone? The mouthpiece, yes. The mouthpiece, yes. Rub a little harder. A little faster. And a little longer. Side by side, you've got to work it on all angles. Yeah. Okay, alright. Is that good enough? Alright, alright, I'm getting an indication. We're getting there. You've got to pull your little panties out? Yes, of course. Don't want daddy to catch you. Can I come back in now? Yeah, okay. Alright, I think we've got a pretty good indication. Yeah, it's very brillo-patty, but short, cropped. I'm going to go with triangle, but trimmed. Wow, you're getting notes from the wow guys from last night from Channel 7. Get them in here, let me see what they're thinking. So you say what it? Now don't say what it is until we ask you. I'm going with just a groomed, very well trimmed, but still in a triangular shape. Okay, guys? I'm going to say a very closely shaved Hitler mustache. Okay. I'm thinking completely shaved. Wow, he's going completely shaved. Opie? I don't know, she wasn't much there in the sound there. She's innocent looking though. Opie? Hey man. I'm going to go... I think I got to agree with that. Really? I'd like to try to come up with a different one, but it seems like a well groomed triangle. Alright, are we ready? Yes, we are. If you would please. Fridja, what's in your pants? You guys are right. Yes, yes. See, and I'll tell you why I said that. I'll even give you my reasoning. But it's trimmed. Yeah. It seemed like there was a lot more area than just a mohawk. Like she was moving the phone and you were hearing... Mohawk side to side. Very short trip. And then well groomed because we weren't getting that real thick thatch like the machete through the jungle kind of sound. So I opted for the well groomed triangle. Wow. Alright. Alright, come on, let's say it. Nah, come on, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Can we see your panties? She doesn't like showing. Oh really? I don't know, I'm just saying that. It's obvious. Alright, well these guys want to talk to Bridget. I think they want to try to make you cry. Do we have like a prize for someone that makes her cry today? Maybe a gift certificate to Paisano? Let's go to Steve. Steve, you're next on WNEW. What's going on? Hey, what's going on, old man? How are you? Alright. How are you, you little dirty horse? You didn't get this chick to do anything, huh? That's a fine introduction. Yeah? Were you conceived in a petri dish? Wow. Does she know what a petri dish is? I know very well what a petri dish is. Were you conceived there? Huh? Were you conceived? No, I wasn't. Okay. Oh, okay. Steve, very good job. Wait, wait, wait. You got one more in you? Yes, I do. Okay, does she know what she has in common with a condom? What? When you're done, you just pull it off and throw it on the floor. Steve, very good. She's actually laughing, though. Aw, come on, cry. Cry, bitch. There goes Steve. We're playing make Bridget cry. The guy with the wow sign, the lights on, is in the other studio. Dave, you're next. Looks like the big lights behind Kiss. Hey, O&A. How are you, Dave? What's up? Hey, Bridget, you dirty little whore. I got something for you. Hey, Bridget, maybe you, it's not what you did, but how you were doing it. You don't sound like the sharpest tool in the shed, you know? You'd jump in your eyes when you were doing it or what? You sure you weren't sucking on this toe? You dumb whore. You wanted to run with your underwear around, huh? You're 20 years old, you look like a whore, too. You dirty pig. Come down there and smack you with my unit. It's so much easier to do this when she's on the phone. Oh, it's great. O&B. She's way too innocent for this, man. Hey, Bridget, you got anything to say or you got your mouth full? Yeah, I'm sure you're laughing. You wouldn't be laughing. You'd be going, oh, boop, boop. You dirty pig. All right, Dave, thank you. Thank you, guys. You're the best. Very good. Mark? I don't know. She's not crying. Psycho Mark, check her eyes. No. Nothing yet? Okay. No, she's not crying. All right, she's holding tough here. Rob, you're next. Yeah, I don't want to make Bridget cry. I want to make her happy. Okay. I want to take Bridget out and teach her how bad I am. She seems a little disgusted. No, I'm not disgusted. Bridget, has anyone gone south on you yet? No. No. Wait, wait. You'll cry from ecstasy. All right, wait a minute. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Hold the phone. This is a revelation. No one's ever done that to you. But that's where we get to go all day. Would you like someone to do that? Eventually. Eventually? Like by 7 o'clock? Eventually? What are we looking at here as a time frame? I believe we have a few takers. Are you still a virgin, Bridget? Oh, okay. Now that explains a little better. Oh, so you'll give your boyfriend a little gift of a hummer, a little virgin girl, and he dissed you like that? Yep. Oh, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad. All right. Are you interested in Rob's offer, Bridget? Thank you, Rob. I can't. She can't? Okay. She's like one of those fresh clams in the barbecue, in the ice. Let's go to Anthony. Anthony, you're next. What's up? What's up, Anthony? What's up, guys? How are you? I want to take her out too, man. I live in Jersey. I know she lives in Jersey. Yeah? Everyone wants to take her out. I'm 21 years old. I work. You know, come on. Come on. Come on. Give it up. It's like, come on. Throw me a bone. I'm working right now, guys. I don't think she's looking for a date at this moment. Come on. I'm going to take her out for a good time. You know, I'm going to make a call. All right. I'm going to go to Richie. Richie, you're next on Eddie W. What's up? You low self-esteem cheese crotch bitch. You are such a disgusting pig. You know that? You're a 20-year-old low life with no self-esteem. What's the matter? You have no parents? Piggy and pig-lit? Is that your parents? Not your little bitch? Huh? I can't hear you. You're tongue-tied and you've got your freaking crotch in your mouth. What's going on? This is brutal. Uh-oh. Mark? I'm crying. I'm crying. Richie, you're next on Eddie W. Richie, turn around. I was listening. I got it. Go ahead. Sorry about that. All right. What's the matter? She can't talk? Is she that stupid? Are you mute? What's the matter with her? I don't really know what the question is. What do you mean you don't know what the question is? You're a bitch. That's a statement, not a question. Where the hell did you go to school? You stupid bitch. I can't even believe you. You're such a smelly bitch. Oh, this is awful. Unbelievable. This is just awful. All right, you guys rule later. All right, Richie. Good job. Good job. Good job. Mark, you're next on Eddie W. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Mark, what's going on? Oh, hell, we're playing the game. Might as well give the guy credit. What's up, Mark? What's up? Listen, before I start, I just want to ask Anthony, I got a couple extra tickets to Riverdance if he wants to go. Oh, bro. Thank you. Where's Little Red Riding Hood? I'm right here. I don't want to take you out. You know why your boyfriend smacked you in the head? Because you probably smell. You're a little whore-tease, pig. I knew you were in that song. Ronald McDonald had a whore. Yeah, what's that? You pig. There's some angry people out there. Jesus. I'm frightened. What do you think her boyfriend smacked her in the head for? Because he didn't give her any. Who wants hummers all the time? Hummers. That's why he smacked you. All right, Mark. Thanks, guys. We're only going to give three more guys a chance, and then we're going to wrap up the game. Mike? Danny, what's up? Make Bridget cry. I don't want to make Bridget cry. I want to make her happy. Okay. Make her happy. She's gorgeous. Okay. Good. Now? Come on. I can do it. All right. That's not going to work. That's very bad. Two to go, Bridget. Mark, what's going on? Yeah, I wanted to ask Bridget out, too. Oh, you do? Yeah. Do you want to go out? I live in Jersey. This game is changing drastically. Hey, you know, hey. That's bordering on a dial-a-date. Ripping me off. You invented that. That's right. All right. Thank you, Mark. All right. All right. I guess we have one more contestant. Let's go to Scott. Hey, don't worry. What's up, buddy? Hey, Scott. Hey, Scott. Hey, Scott. What's up, buddy? I think they're going about it the wrong way. Bridget, you're 20 years old today, right? Yes. So you were with this guy last year, huh? Uh-huh. That must be tough in your birthday and when you're alone late at night. What goes through your head? I mean, don't you miss a guy? I know you say you don't, but there's got to be times where it's tough, especially on days like today. I miss him. I know. I don't know. I might just be kidding yourself. Have you seen the guy around at all? No, I haven't seen him. Or are you trying to stay out of his neighborhood? I've stayed away from him. No. We've got to be tough, though. So he was around last birthday, huh? Yeah. Where'd he get you? Was it something nice or was it just some really frappy thing? Bike pedals. What? Bike pedals. You got me bike pedals. All right. I lost it. All right, guys, you guys rule. Why did he get you bike pedals? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Why did he get you bike pedals? Because that's what I wanted. Like just pedals for your bike? So that you can clip on with your shoes on your mountain bike. Woo. Yeah, you did lose a catch. Jeez, let me tell you. Hey, Ron, what's up? Bike pedals. Hey, Ron. Ron. Jeez, if you were together this year, maybe he would have gotten you the hand grips with the little screamers flying off in the ends. Hey, Billy, what's up? Fair the dream. Hey, listen, Bridget. Okay, this is... I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something.

Don't you think about your family members when you're doing that? Oh Bridget. Remember Grandma who used to bake the cakes? Whoa, she's got a tear in her eye. I got her, Owen. I just want to stop. Come on. Oh no. Wait a minute. I just need to tear her off. We have a winner. Here you go. Billy, you're a winner. Wow, Billy taking the tact of the family members. Wait, Bridget. Go under the light. I swear to God, go under the light. Just move your whole body under the light. Clear your hair away a little bit. Yeah, yeah. You got it. Oh my God. Wow, Billy. Very strategic move Billy made. There you go. Going away from the degrading her to the family sensitivity angle. Very smart man. Beautiful, right, Owen? And he pulls out a victory. Look at him, he's going to the finish line. He's going to the finish line. He's going to the finish line. He's going to the finish line. He's going to the finish line. He's going to the finish line. Beautiful, right, Owen? And he pulls out a victory. Look, he's all proud. Now what do you want, Billy? What do you got for me, man? You could get a gift certificate to Paisano of Mulberry Street, the official restaurant of the ONA show pretty much. We got some CDs we could throw together for you. I don't do wrestling. My kid brother loves that crap. Do we have wrestling? All right, we have wrestling tickets. Excellent. Thanks, dude. Hold on the line. It's for the WWF event, I believe, April 15th at the Garden. I'll play up with a good one. And tickets go on sale Sunday at Ticketmaster. All right. And we'll throw in a t-shirt, all right? Excellent. Thank you. Congratulations, you heartless scumbag. Bye, Billy. Bye-bye. All right. Billy's on line 10. He wins the prizes. I saw the tear. Wow. That was mean. That was not good. You wanted to play, Bridget. I know. I'm fine. What got you? That was just gross. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's not really good. It's not good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to think of your grandma. I understand. That old, dried uterus. Silly shit. Silly shit. Oh, we're going template. Goddamn template. Hey, who's this? Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yeah, this is the guy. Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yo, yo, yo, who's this? Yeah, this is the only black guy that listens to this show. We're the only three guys. Now we have a bunch of black guys listening to this show. Yeah, one of the only three of us that went to the Super Bowl party was the only three guys there. What's up? Exactly. Now, I want to know if she's going to bring that snatch phone to the next road show. What's up? What's up? You got to bring the snatch phone to the next road show. Snatch phone on tour. Definitely. Who's going to use that phone? She rubbed the snatch all over it. Yeah, she's a virgin and she pulled down her tiny little panties and that was pretty nice. All the guys trying to make her cry about giving her hummers. Man, my girl listens to this stage. You're trying to kill me? What's going on? Yeah, right? For real. What are you talking bad about? You're making her think about her grandmother. What's going on? Hey, I got to ask you, what does the black community think of all the white guys that are all imitating the, what's that? We're not laughing with you. We're laughing at you. I know who you guys are. We're laughing at you. I'm trying way too hard. You guys come up with the greatest phrases and then Whitey wrecks them. Destroys them. You guys got like everyone on Wall Street walking around going, what's that? All right, you guys rule. All right, man. Peace. Obie, are you saying there's no black people on Wall Street? Well, yeah, there's a few. I was trying to think of what you were saying. Well, there's a lot of white guys on Wall Street. You know what I'm saying. No. Please explain yourself. No, thank you. All right, can we play a quick round of racial profiling going on here on the Obie and Anthony Show? Oh, big surprise. Didn't you check the calendar? It was my turn today. Yes. All right. You want to play a quick round of what did we learn on the Obie and Anthony Show today? Wow, look at the time. 212-757-1027. I want to thank the guys that were on TV yesterday with the wow signs on Channel 7. Great job, guys. Did Ben hook you guys up with some stuff or what? Yeah, he definitely hooked us up. Very good. You get your banner on TV, you come down a little towards the studio and some prizes. We sat on the lesbian couch for an hour. Ah, there you go. We got to sit on the lesbian couch. We didn't even know until an hour later. Something will be growing on your pants on the way home. Believe me, it's like a culture. The yogurt cultures. That's scary. And of course, we've got to thank Bridget for stopping by. The famous Bridget for Make Bridget Cry. We've got to get you at one of our road shows. We could probably get you in as a stage prop or something. Yeah. You know, put you in a packing case. Or we'll just tour you around with the phone. Forget it. Look at me. Dollar sniff. Oh, come on. Rick's not here. Opie's got to take the over the line role today. I feel left out, guys. All right, let's go to Ed. Hey, guys, how you doing? What's up? Hey, you know what I learned today? I learned that maybe you should smell the phone. Maybe that's why nobody's home. Mark, go take a... No, Spaz? Where's Spaz? Anthony? Yeah? Spaz, get the phone in here. Uh-oh. Are you going to eat your fat? What? Are you going to eat your fat? Oh, you're right from Caddy's side. God damn. You're going to eat your fat. You're going to eat your fat. I'm going to eat my fat. Are you gonna eat your fat? What? Are you gonna eat your fat? Oh, you're right, right, from Caddyshark. Goddamn. You're gonna eat your fat? What comes next, man? I'm thinking. Oh, I'm sick, man. I can't think today. I'm heavily medicated. Sorry, man. What is it? Spalding! Oh, I was gonna say that too. Spalding. Spalding. All right. Have them cleaned. Thank you, Ed. We got the phone in the studio. All right, guys. Thanks. All right. Was this the phone, Bridget? Oh. Is that the phone? No, I wanna leave. Is it? What? Yeah. Why do you wanna leave? What? Oh, my God. You're embarrassing her. Why? Go ahead. Give it one. Any hairs? No hairs. No? Smells pretty good. Because this is like Psycho Mark's phone. Yeah. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. I'm gonna go get some. This is like a Psycho Mark's phone. With the hot breath he has, this thing usually smells pretty bad. There you go. Ah, it got flowery. Very nice. There's like a flowery smell to it. Sure. Guys, would you like a sniff? I don't have a sense of smell, but these two can... No, that's a good one. What's with the people with no sense of smell popping up every so often? Psycho Mark? Smell the phone. Smell the phone. All right, pass it along. Bottle that scent. Oh my God. Give it to the guy with the big, huge light up wow sign. There you go. Don't foul it with your hands. Ooh, thumbs up. People passing it around like a fine wine. Yes, delicate bouquet. Nice legs. Yes. He's taking a big whiff over there, man. All right, give Smash. It's like passing around like a pot pipe. Yeah.

Alright, so I had to dump out. Oh my God. Go on. I had to bust up the tension in here. You can't say that. I know you can't. I feel like my mom's going crazy. Sorry. Unbelievable. Alright, Lisa, what's going on? Yeah, I learned that next time I call Opie and Anthony and start moaning and groaning and announcing I'm high, make sure my mom doesn't come home from work. She was listening? Yeah, and I went to get a drink of water and she was right there. So I'm like in my room and I'm not moving from here for like a while now. Are you still real high? Oh yeah, definitely. Alright, you sound like you're crashing a little bit at this point. Listen guys, can I come up to your show one day? Yeah. Really? Yeah, they let anyone in. You might as well. Yeah, all you gotta do is show up. They'll send you right down. Look at these clowns. Alright, Lisa. I learned Bridget is a virgin and she uses nice perfumes on her. So do you just soap and water basically? Basically. Did you take your perfume in and just do a quick like? No. No, huh? Okay. We'll take one more call. We gotta step aside for Donna Mike. Tom, you're next on NAW, the last call of the day. How you doing all night? Good. I learned that redheaded virgins smell flowery. You guys rule. Genesco grads rule. Oh cool, thanks Tom. And there we go, another radio show behind us. Whoa, yeah, look at that. Gotta thank Bridget. Let's hear it for Bridget for being a good sport today. Thanks Tom. From Big Bridget Crag. We came on strong in the end. I think the coffee helped us out. Yeah, it definitely helped us out. Right about 5 o'clock or so we dosed up. What about the coke? Had some cup of crack. Yeah, and then Psycho Mark brought in like an 8-ball. We all just snorted as much cocaine as we could before our hearts exploded. And it really picked the show up I think. It really helped us out today I gotta say, sure. And then thank you the guys that came down with the last ones and the crystal meth. That was great. Thank you, yes. Yeah, now I just gotta get this ecstasy out of my system. I'm gonna do a lude and maybe just speedball directly into the retina and I'll be fine. And with that we'll see you guys tomorrow too, alright? Yeah. Stay tuned for Don and Mike.
