 OOOOH, OPI & ANTHONY! We found a girl that can shoot stuff from her private area. More stupidity on the way! RIGHT NOW! 1027 WNEW! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! Last radio show before... vacation! It's the OPI & ANTHONY Show, it's FU Friday, man. UGH... God damn sucks out there! How you doin', man? Need to drink a lot of green beer today. Just so you don't freeze your ass off. Yeah. Oh my god, fix that. I was watching the parade this year. Usually I'm out there before the radio show, but this year I'm like, ah, screw it, I'll watch it on TV. Yeah, that's the best place to watch it. The weather BLOWS, man. You see Hillary Clinton getting booed like crazy? Yeah, what does she have to say? God damn, did that make me feel good today? And Giuliani's like, Well, I just hope she doesn't make a wrong turn down the wrong street and get lost in our city. And I said if she doesn't know New York, like Rudy, like he's always taking little feet towards down the side streets. Yeah. Please. Any, uh, any FUs you gotta get off your mind, then? Carol? Why, you... Anything? You're leading me onto something here? Well, it's FU Friday. Oh. I, um, I don't have any. I actually, well, I, I... Uh-oh. I actually, uh, made out pretty good today. We should play a new goddamn game. What's that? Uh, which member of the NYPD will pull over Anthony today? Get outta here! You got pulled over again? I swear to God. Ha! Look, I gotta tell you something. I'm pulled over more than a black man and Alexis, man. And, and I... Are you serious? You didn't even talk to me in the office. I gotta be honest. I forgot. It's become such commonplace now. It's like breathing for me. We said yesterday that I, I missed being pulled over, because, I mean, we were keeping track for a while there. Yeah. And now you're way, you're way in the lead. I got pulled over, I think, when we were still keeping track before I started taking the train. I think I was up to six times in a year and a half. And you were like, you were right around that level too, but now you have surpassed me. I am getting pulled over on a daily basis, and it is all due to this. I really am driving. I'm outta control. I gotta do something. I am driving like a lunatic now. Just take your time when you drive to Florida tomorrow. I will. I'm just, I'm saying... Because you know what? I'm assuming that the men in blue took care of you once again today, but if you're doing all that crap down there in the South, I'm not going down there to bail your ass out. No. It's only when I'm in the confines of the boroughs. Fine boroughs. That's it. Then I lose my friggin' mind. Today, I'm in Brooklyn, driving around. You know, I'm gonna be a little late because of the parade and stuff. Manhattan's a little clogged up. What sidewalk did you decide to drive on? No, it wasn't a sidewalk. You can't make a left off of 86th Street onto Bay Parkway over there in Brooklyn. So, I see the big sign, no left turn between 7 and 7. Okay. All right. And I don't want to be the guy waiting there to make the left turn while everyone behind me is beeping, going, look, no left turn. So, right when the light turned green, I went into the oncoming traffic lane. Now, there weren't any cars there. Went around a truck into the oncoming traffic lane of the turn that I made and then back into my lane and I'm off. There you go, right? Whip, whip, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee, whee. Not a good thing? No, I pulled over. Cop comes up to window, very nice, courteous guy, you know, I'm giving him the speech, I go, I know, bonehead move. I go, what can I tell you? I'm in a hurry. Amateurs, look at my Boston plate. I got the Dopey Mass plates on my Dopey Mass license, the registration with no insurance card because they stamp it and I don't want to understand that. First time for me in the city office, I'm sorry. Huh, was a little confused with your roads. I thought I was in Jersey. I'm in Brooklyn. All right, so how did you get out of this one? So, he goes, all right, I won't write you up for the turn, the illegal turn. He goes, but I'll give you a seatbelt ticket. I was wearing my belt. I said, you know, I go, ah, you got to go, look, it's a lot cheaper and there's no point. I go, oh, listen to Opien Anthony. God damn, you suck. Dude, I had to play the card. I never play the card. I had to play the card. I always feel if I'm going to play the card, they're going to throw me in jail. I got our new press passes that get us thrown out of press conferences, dangling from the rear view mirror. So I kind of like showed it to him and he's like, oh, wow, yeah, cool, okay. He goes, all right, take it easy. He goes, just say something nice about the NYPD. I go, I always do, man. Love you guys. You guys rule. See, it's not that we really love you guys, but it's our way of getting out of tickets. Hey, Opie is speaking for himself here. I am a total supporter of the men in blue. The men in blue need a raise. And that's because, you know something, I think they're being like that to me because we give them support on the air here. It's not a phony thing. We don't say it just to get out of tickets. Thank God it works. Not many people in the media give the boys props. No, I got to start giving the boys props on the Long Island Railroad so they can start hooking me up. What, give you free tickets on the? That would be nice. Then we get the lucky thing where it's like they haven't come for my ticket yet and they're up to my stop on the train. That's always good. It's like tickets, tickets, you're like, oh, no, the stop's one stop away. Come on. I almost made it. Well, that's when you have to run and get to the bathroom or to another car real fast. You just run away from them. So, hey, thanks, man. That guy hooked me up. Amazing, Anthony. Amazing. But I got to admit, I really have to admit now, I'm driving like a nut. We all said it. We've been saying it for years. Now, 56th, downstairs here, the parade going down 5th, they're blocking up all the streets like crazy. So I'm having a hard time getting down half a block to pull into the garage here at our building. Do I wait? Oh, no. What do I do? Wait, give me the details again. I'll tell everyone exactly what you did. I made the left onto 56th, instant stop. The entrance to the garage is between... It's in the middle of the block on 56th between Broadway and 7th. So I'm stuck right there at the corner. I'm thinking you pulled over and parked because you have the press pass. Oh, no. I parked in the garage, but I had to get there really quick and the road was full. You went up on the sidewalk? Oh, yeah. Are you nuts? I drove on the sidewalk in front of Hooters, in front of the parking... I'm on the sidewalk. Parking meters to my right. Swear to God. You're crazy, man. We're going on vacation tomorrow. I already let the cat out of the bag. You're driving to Florida, you're driving south. You pull that crap down there, man, you're going to be on a chain gang. I'm not. It's only when I'm in New York. We don't have a radio show down south yet, so you're not going to be able to pull the, hey, I'm Anthony. I'm Anthony. Well, that's... That's all well and fine, boy. That's pretty good, boy. Right. Well, God damn, I heard your show and you ought to calm down. Sing us a song. Sing us a song. All right, well, congratulations. Good old... Speaking of songs, boys are lollygagging around like it's 120 degrees. Can't be no more than 114. Duck that chink of days pay for napping on the job. And we have blazing saddles going in the office. Yes, we did. But speaking of songs, how many songs are we playing today? We got three new entries. We have three new entries to play today? Three new great songs. For the most offensive song ever on the Opie and Anthony show. Yeah, but they're... We've taken a new direction. All right. Less offensive. I love it. Listen, listen, there are two out of the three songs... Where? Opie. We need a lot of Jewish people to call and say that it's okay to play one of the songs. And we're going to need a lot of black people to call and say that it's okay to play one of the songs. That's going to happen. Then I'll feel a little better about the songs you're about to hear. Opie. What? What's the name of the contest? The most offensive song. Can a song be too offensive to be in that? Is a runner in a race in the Olympics too fast to run? Is a skater too fast to skate? This contest is making me a little nervous. It's a contest. It's making me a little nervous at this point. And we've already gone... Just wait to hear the takeoff on the Candyman, Anthony. Yes, I was listening to a little portion of that. The Candyman can. And I'm interested in the fact that the direction of these songs have taken a little turn because we've been pretty much on the same page. We've been pretty much on the sex and fetus angle. Maybe sex. Oh no, there's flat out racism today. This is really racist, bad songs and they're very offensive. Flat out racism and one about a smelly snatch. And might I say, I think contenders. You think contenders? The Candyman one is so friggin' offensive. This could be the most offensive song ever. Well, that's why we're having the contest. Honestly, I will not play it unless ten black people tell me it's okay. Ten black people have to call us. That's all I need. If ten of the brothers and sisters call and say, look, I have a sense of humor, play the song, then we'll play it. Hello, this is Reverend Hines. Play that damn thing. I'm on read. But until then, I just consciously cannot push the button to start one of these songs today. Play it, play it or I will punch you in the uterus. There's two. I want to hear the song. Three and seven more to go. All right, well, and speaking of the most offensive song contest, the song that started it all, FBA, Full Blown AIDS, which by the way is not on the unofficial website. I don't understand what Steve is waiting for because Steve has all the songs that are in contention up on the website and people can vote for which one is the most offensive. FBA is not up there, the one that started it all. But the prototype. We ran into Mike DeNicola after the Brian Regan show last night down there at Caroline's and Mike's coming in. Cool. The author of Full Blown AIDS. Is he actually fessing up to that? Yeah. At first he goes, you know, at first, you know, he didn't want to fess up to it, but then too many of our listeners were coming up to him and now he's like, yeah, that was me. Now he's all proud and stuff. But at first he didn't want anything to do with it. Of course not. Now he's all taking credit for it. And of course around 5 45 we're leaving the radio show today. We're going to be broadcasting from the bar back. Right. That's all right. People should know they need time to get there. Well, that's a quickie. We did it last year. We're doing it this year. We're going to the bar back and hanging out and having some green beers with you guys. But before we continue with the radio show, yeah, your buddy, your pal, my buddy, my pal Adam. Adam Farrar is on the on the line because there's a little controversy in the paper today. Yeah, I see this. And we want to clear this up, right? You want to tell the story real fast and before we punch that Adam here, Leonardo DiCaprio stepbrother. His name is Adam Farrar. Yeah, it's just like my pal's name without the egg at the end. Yeah, he was arrested for attempting to murder his girlfriend and making terrorist threats. And he's being held in lieu of one million dollars, a million dollars. And there seems to be some confusion over who this is. Well, it's funny because I was reading the email before the show and everyone's like, oh, my God, Anthony's childhood friend. He's in jail for attempted murder. Oh, I swear to you, there's more than one that came in today. Adam Farrar. Let's talk to Adam. Adam! I need this in my life. Hey there, pal. How the hell are you supposed to book some gigs with this publicity? A million bucks? I'm a little strapped. I know. You know, if it was me, you wouldn't even be picking up the phone. I know. I had no idea this was going on. I'm sleeping. It's at six o'clock in the morning. My cell phone rings and it's my father. I'm like, hello? Are you running or did they get you? I go, what, Pop? What are you doing? You sound groggy. Are the balls working you over? I go, what are you talking about? Your mother said she heard on the radio you tried to whack somebody. Oh, wow. I go, what are you talking about? How many times do I got to tell you? Make it look like an accident. Hire somebody. What are you doing? And my mother's in the background. I heard her go, Joe, I think they said he's a terrorist. Oh my God, are you a terrorist? I can see Weezy getting all pissed off. I know. I can't believe it. He's a terrorist. When I finally said it with somebody else, my mother starts backpedaling. She got on the phone and she goes, I know I didn't raise a terrorist. I told your father he was crazy. He doesn't even know who Allah is. So have you been getting many calls about this? Well, just my father woke me up. My mother made sure I was all right. And then Rick called. Adam Farrar. Without the A. Your Farrar-ah. Does the guy look like me? No, not at all. Thank God. No, he's looking real palsy with Leonardo there in this picture. Little step-brotherly love there. Is that what it is? Yeah, attempted murder, man. He tried to kill the girlfriend. He tried to kill her with that music? What the hell did he try to kill her with? Titanic music there, man. Did they say how he tried to kill her? No, attempting to murder his girlfriend and making terrorist threats. What is that? I don't know. It doesn't say anything. They give no details on what he did. He appeared in TV commercials and series such as 8 Is Enough and Battlestar Galactica. And he was last seen on Olive Garden commercials. I knew it! I knew there had to be a by the way in it! You know, now whenever I take a gig, I always think, how are they going to break my balls over this? Come on. Now, are we allowed to talk about the thing that, you know, that thing? Yeah, in fact, I'm coming in to shoot it. The first thing? The thing with the guy? We can talk about that. How Italian did you just become? You know the thing. Yeah, you can talk about that? Yeah, it was in the papers. I'm cool. Go ahead, let it rip. Tell everybody what Adam Ferrara, not Adam Ferrara, is up to. Adam Ferrara. My pal. Look at this. I'm beaming with pride. It's like the Highlights magazine. Goofus tried to kill his girlfriend. Gallant? No, it's not to murder other humans. The Goofus and Gallant. Oh, I love those. So now what are you doing, Adam? I'm coming into town to do the Dennis Leary pilot for ABC. Yes, look at that. Network television pilot with Dennis Leary. And you're going to be playing what? Detective Tommy Boutas. A cop? How about that? How cool is that? You get to wear a gun and stuff. Sure, the whole thing. Sure. I'm going to be like Fish on Bonnie Miller. That's not too shabby. So when do you start taping that? I'm actually flying out Saturday. Look at this. I'm beaming with pride, my pal. Look at you. I can hear the beaming. Look at you. Look at you beaming. I can't believe this. He's going to be on... This is network, ABC. It's big. All right, pal. Hopefully it'll go. I can come back to New York. Yeah, if this series takes off, you leave Los Angeles? In a heartbeat. And you're back in New York. I'm going to leave Skid Marks. Will you pull Anthony over if you're playing a cop? Yeah. And let me go? Anthony got pulled over again today. What happened? I'm getting pulled over on a daily basis because my driving is getting ridiculous. It's not getting. I'm driving like... Remember the chase scene in Bullet? That's how I drive every day. I remember... Remember the bug? Yeah, I had a Volkswagen. You know when he had the bug? No, in a Baja bug. He had a Volkswagen that he built an off-road vehicle with? Yeah. And just drove off the road. And drove it, yeah. He's like driving on the highway. He goes, you know how many cars can't do this? And we're going down a divider on the northern state. I go, you know why? You're not supposed to do this. And the thing fit. You know the signs on the parkways? They got the two big posts and a big sign right underneath in between. You went under those? Well, there was traffic. There was traffic getting to Jones Beach, right? As there always is. Oh, you just leave the roadway. You leave the road. You drive under the signs. Adam, he's still driving off-road these days. Yeah, I know. He's very Ted Kennedy that way. So I get pulled over like every day and then I have to play the card. And thank God it's been working, you know? Yeah. I go, my pal's Adam Ferrara and they let me right off the hook. Yeah, they went, you mean the murderer? Yeah, where is he? So Adam, he gets pulled over. You would think he would behave as far as the rest of his driving to the station goes. Ask him how he got into the parking garage today. As you can afford to. 56 was a little clogged. And I noticed there didn't seem to be much of a traffic problem up on the sidewalk. Right. So I took that. Stop it. Yeah. What's wrong with you? I drove right past Hooters on the sidewalk. Let me tell you, horrified pedestrians. I waited until the sidewalk was clear when I pulled onto it. Because you're a gentleman. Sure. You don't want to just pull up on the sidewalk while there's people walking there. Then some smartass tries to pull out of the parking garage. The nerve. The nerve. So now I'm on the sidewalk so I can't get past them. Now you've got to wait. What did their face look like when there's a car on the sidewalk? Without even reading the lips, I could tell he was saying, Oh my God, there's a car on the sidewalk. I think it works today though because it's St. Patrick's Day. So I think people are checking stuff like that today. So I pulled and then I'm yelling at the pedestrians. I'm like, Ah yeah, okay, yeah, there's a car on the sidewalk. Yeah, big deal. And they're all looking at me all pissed. I'm meddling in your business. You've got to do what you've got to do. What was that gig we were leaving on the island? We were on the long side of the road? Which time? I know. We were leaving some gig. It was me, you and Joe Buck. And I was driving and you go, Adam, we're on the wrong side. Oh yeah. You think I drive bad? I drive bad but at least I know what I'm doing while I'm driving bad. Adam just is oblivious. Has no clue. Hey pal. Mr. Magoo music starts playing in the background. Oh my, Georgie. Which way are we going, Magoo? We're on the wrong side of the road. Yeah, but we're making good time. Roadhog! All right, Pally. Let me let you go and good luck. Let us know when this thing is airing. We'll pump it up. You got a commercial coming up? I wonder what your next break is going to be about. Oh, off the air stuff. That's fun. A few more minutes. Okay. We'll hang on for a while. Yeah, hold on. You got three more minutes of material in you? You want to fill to the end? Try out something new. You want to fill? A little fill here? Oh, just wind me up. We didn't do anything for programming today. Vacation can't come soon enough. We're the worst of tapes. That's right. What are you doing on vacation? Where are you going? Plotting. Plotting? Plotting? Plotting? Plotting? Plotting? Where are you going? Florida. You going to Florida? Sure. Why not? Driving? Yeah, I got massive amounts of cocaine to take back. I can't take that on a plane. Oh, I still see your moonlighting. That's funny. I don't want to go on a plane. You know, the swallowing, the condoms, and then the straddling. They explode inside you, huh? It's a trip. Where are you going to Florida? All over the place. Would you like me to give out my itinerary? I feel like I'm watching Adam on stage. He's working the crowd now. Yeah, and what do you do? What do you do? And what do you do? I'm a student. I'm a hairdresser from Bay Shore. How long are you guys going to be on vacation? Just a week. A week. That's it. Are you going anywhere else? Yes, I'm going far away. I have to fly to my destination. Yeah, he's got some water to go over. He doesn't stop you from driving, Ant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll make the ferry. Yeah. All right. All right. Now we can take a break. Okay. It's Adam Ferrari, everyone. Hold on, bro. All right, and like we mentioned a few minutes ago, we will be doing our last hour of our show from La Barbe at Anthony. Yes. A couple blocks from this location here on the road. We'll be there by six, and we'll stay definitely a few hours. Yeah. Drink some green beer with you guys and hang out and stuff, okay? Hell yeah. Lots more show to go here. We have three. Sorry, we're going to have to go. We're going to have to go. We're going to have to go. We're going to have to go. We're going to have to go. We have three songs to play in the most offensive song contest. We have Mike Deena-Cola coming in. Got to talk about the Brian Regan show last night. Had a lot of fun there. Hell yeah. Got to talk about the NCAA. Hey, I owned it like great last night. Hey, what was the score? We'll get into that next. Stay there. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. I've been telling Anthony about Brian Regan for a long time now. Flat out the funniest guy I've ever seen do stand up. He works clean, doesn't have any blue jokes, doesn't curse and side splitting the whole damn time he's on stage, right? Every second. His act is funny every second, not one slow point. I was laughing, my sides hurt. My stomach was hurting. I woke up today, I'm like, what's wrong with my ribs? It was because I was just losing it last night. You gotta see this guy. You're fine, you get a chance. My God. There may be some tickets left for the remaining shows at Caroline's. You might want to call him to see, but I'm telling you, I would doubt it. He only gets to New York a couple times a year and he's just the best. He is the best. If he can't make it this weekend, just write the name Brian Regan down somewhere so next time he comes to town, you'll book your tickets early because he sells out all the time now. Very funny gentleman. And then we were leaving the club and we ran into Mike DeNicola, he's stopping by. The author of FBA, Full Blown Age, should be here in about an hour, Anthony. He's so proud. So proud of that song. Yeah. And then we were walking to the station and we ran into a couple of guys from K-Rock. Anthony. I can't say their names because I'll get them in trouble. What are they? First it was like they saw us and we saw them and they were all tough and stuff and then all of a sudden they broke down and they come right up to me and they go, hey man, I've got to tell you, not only do I listen to the show every day, pretty much the whole damn station listens every day. Oh really? So we want to say hi to the K-Rock staff. They tune in every day, right, Rick? You heard it. I was there, they gave us some nice little prizes from their stash in the van. God damn. I missed it. They were all looking tough like we were going to fight or something. It was two gangs walking toward each other and then one guy breaks down and goes, I've got to admit, and he pulls me to the side and goes, dude, we freaking love your show. And most of the staff over at K-Rock takes a listen. All right. Well, they're not going to listen to Will. Who are you kidding? I know. He could trash us as much as he wants. No one is listening to his stupid show. So I thought that was kind of cool, right, Rick? Very cool. Don't want to give the name because I think the guy would get in trouble because it seemed like he was a little nervous that he was telling me that. Yeah. Knowing that we'd go right on the radio and say something. You don't want to get him in trouble, though. You're right. Don't do that. Well, the kid probably makes, I don't know, nothing. Crap. Working over there. All right. So there you have it. Then I went to the hotel and checked out the end of the St. John's game, Anthony. Yeah. Ha. Ha. Ha. We dodged a bullet last night. They had a score with what, 13 seconds left? We did. I know you don't care, but, uh... No, I'm wondering how... St. John's doesn't look like a championship team. It sure didn't look like a championship team last night, Anthony. How did Iona do? Oh, Iona just kicked... kicked ass last night, Anthony. Did they? Am I doing good? Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. It's safe... What happened? It's safe to say that you only have three teams left. Three left. Yeah. Iona was out of it after two minutes, uh, went by in the game. Oh, really? What was the score, like, 23 to 3 or something like that? Yeah, in the first eight minutes it was 23 to 3. First eight minutes. Dude, they looked like the Reginald Denny of the NCAA last night. Just getting pounded. Horrendous. St. John's won, St.... Syracuse won. She and Hall just pulled it out at the last second this afternoon. St. and Hall won? Yep. All right. When does Duke play? Today? Duke, I think, plays later today. Um, UConn plays later today. No, UConn's on right now. 10-4, early first. Those are my other two teams, UConn and Duke. Yeah. You're down to three. Purdue won yesterday, though, Anthony. Yeah, yeah. They played later today. Very good. University of Cincinnati, I think they played later today. Yeah. I think they won their first game. Oh, they won their first game. There you go. You got two with that one. Come on, I'm cranking. They won this Hofstra play, Anthony's last pick. Tonight. Tonight. They will get pummeled tonight. Hey, look. Come on. You know the Iona thing with the goof, right? Oh, yeah. You know I picked Iona as a total goof. Oh, of course. It spazzes all my mind. Of course I'm going to pick it. Steve, what's going on? Little chow. Hey, Steve. What's up, guys? How are you? Yeah, listen. Is Iona like a handicap school or what? And I was pulling for you, but listen, I turned on the game, they were down like 20-some points. I was like, forget about it. How many people were watching the Iona game just knowing that Anthony picked it and just sitting there laughing? Yeah. I was like, I'm going to pick it. I'm going to pick it. I'm going to pick it. I'm going to pick it. Yeah, St. John's giving me a heart attack last night because that's the team I want to go all the way this year. It was just a joke. Iona was just a joke you're claiming now, Ant? Yeah, why would I pick that crappy team? I know they were crappy. I guess Hofstra is a joke too, huh? No, Hofstra I am legitimately pulling for. Okay. Come on. Let's go to Pedro. How are you, Pedro? I'm bored as hell. You're bored? Why? You guys. Come on, we're doing all right today. Yeah, you're doing all right. We're almost on vacation. We're almost on vacation. We're going to La Barbe back today. You going to be there? I can't make it this time, guys. No problem. It's more like a quick, hey, hang out, have a few beers before we go away type thing. I got you. Listen, I got two things for you. I went to the parade on TV. One of those Rockman police departments. Drum and bagpipe chorus. One of the guys on the drums had wow all over his drum. His drum? Yeah, I saw that and a bunch of people calling about that. I want to thank that guy. He had wow all over his drum kit there, Anthony. Cool. If he was a cop, he don't like all that stuff. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. I want to thank that guy. He had wow all over his drum kit there, Anthony. Cool. If he was a cop, he don't like a walrus. Yeah. It's like a big issue. That parade was beat. Well, the weather sucked. Oh, yeah. I was just taking a peek as I was hanging out here at the station before the show. The best part was when they were booing Hillary like crazy. Yeah. Thank God they were doing that. And then a bunch of gays got arrested. They got arrested for trying to march in the parade. Yeah. They got arrested. And they got arrested this year instead of just getting a desk appearance ticket. They're being put through the system. Oh. So they will spend some time in a cell. I don't understand why we have to allow gays to march in parades. Because then why can't we make our own group? Why can't we make our own group? Guys that love lesbians. Yeah. And force officials to allow us to march in the parade. That's why they... Upheld their law. Hey! Hey! Because you'd be able to say that. Hey, we want to march under a banner of guys that like to have sex with women. Yeah. But you should just assimilate into the parade. If you're a gay guy and want to march in the parade under the we like to blow bagpipes, that's fine. Sure. Just as long as it's not under a gay banner. Alright. Thank you, Pedro. I got one more thing. I got a nephew. To who? Everybody. Everybody? Yeah. Have a nice weekend. Friendly sort. Hang in there, Pedro. Alright, man. Alright. Now we need ten people, ten black people to call to tell me it's okay to play an offensive song here for the most offensive song contest. Yeah. So if we get those ten people, I will play the song. Ten black people have to give us permission to play a song? You know, call me a puss, but I just feel it's the right thing to do. This song is just so over the top. It really is bad. It's very offensive. I'll be able to sleep tonight knowing that ten black people said it was okay to play the song. Because then when people start calling and complaining, I'll go, look, your old people said it was okay. But when you're having a most offensive song written contest, you would want the champions. We've had the fetus song. We've had the baby raper. Oh my God, you're talking about a baby raper song. That's very offensive. And now this one, which delves into racism, delves, delves. This thing plunges headlong. You see that hole they got on 56 and Broadway? Yeah. Okay. Oh my God. No more than delving. I'll just feel better if ten black people give us the permission. Yeah? Yeah. Hi, who's this? Hello? Yeah. You're on the radio, buddy. Who are you? What's up, dawgs? How y'all doing? All right. All right. What's your name, man? Yeah, my name is Jareek, yo. Jareek, yo. Where you calling from, Jareek? Yeah, I'm calling from Paterson. Paterson? All right. Alabama projects. All right. And you want us to play the most offensive song that we got on today. Yeah, man. I want to hear what's the best thing I got out there. You know what I'm saying? All right. You're not going to be offended. I heard it all, man. You know what I'm saying? I want to see what I got, man. That's pretty bad. It can't be that offensive, you know? It's serious. All the N-word is... Look at that, too. All right, hold on. Hold on. You said, F that nigger. Yeah, I'm a nigger, too, man. I chugged down my 40s, slinged the Y, shit all that stuff. Hold on. You're cursing like crazy over there, Jareek. Say whatever you want, but don't curse, because we want you on the radio. Oh, my bad, my bad. All right, player? All right. All right. All right, let's play it. Yeah, play it nice and loud so I can hear. All right, we'll do that, Jareek. Thank you for calling. No doubt, baby. There's one black guy down. All right, Rick. Let me mark it down. Yeah, let's keep track. We need 10, and I'll let it fly. Jerome, what's going on? Do we even have 10 black listeners? I don't know. Call twice. Right here. Hey, Jerome, what's going on? Yo, what up? How are you? What up? You mean you do okay? Yo, you guys played that Amadou Diallo Disney the other day. You know what I'm saying? I was like... Yeah. This won't be any worse than that. All right, we're trying to make sure you're black. Yeah, it's pretty bad, man. You sound black. Where are you calling from? Queens. Queens, yo. No, please, Jackson Heights. Jackson Heights? No doubt. You sure it's not a white guy? Dude. You're not a wigger, right? Dude, dude. What? Shut up. All right. Who cares if it is? No, playing me like that. Sounds fine. All right, so, Jerome, you don't mind if we play a very offensive song to your brothers? No, you guys were like ragging on Amadou Diallo. It can't be any worse than that. All right. Thank you, Jerome. How many homies are we up to? Just two. Two, all right. Two homies. Byron. Yo, yo, what's up? What's up? What's going on? Now, make sure it's not a white guy imitating a black guy, because I will not have that today. Yo, don't play me like that. All right, you're black. Damn. No, he's black. Byron. Yo, yo. Yeah, you might be white. I want to ask you to play them songs. All right. All right. I'm locking them down. There's three. They call me Moon Crickets. They call me Tar Baby. I don't care. That's great. Okay. I'll ask. Ask? Yeah. X, K. I think he's right, man. All right. Come on. Are you white? Yo, yo, no, no, no. Yeah? I'm telling you. I got eight of my friends here that I wanted to, but two of them's Puerto Ricans, but that's okay. All right. Throw me a rhyme, then, if you're black. Yo, you want me to rhyme? All right. All right, let's go. Baby, baby, I'll take it and give it to you in the butt. Let's go, because you're my slut. I'm going to say, watch out for your ankles. I'll put it in you. I'm not going to let you go. I'm going to let you go. I'm going to say, watch out for your ankles. I'll put it in your mouth, then turn you around, and then I'll make you shout, baby. Yeah! All right. I think we have our third, uh, bro. Oh, yeah. He sounds like a black gentleman. Thank you, Byron. Thank you. Yo, you boys are the best. All right. We're getting permission to play this, uh, the latest most offensive song, Anthony. Whiter than the Pillsbury Dove. Look at that guy. Uh, Nigger Charlie, what's going on? Hey, how you doing? Hey. It's Nigger Charlie. All right. Nigger Charlie, you guys got to play that song and quit trying to do it. All right. All right. I don't know. You don't sound black enough. I'm as black as night. Are you? He's as black as night, Opie. You sure, Ed? Yeah. All right. We're up. I'm positive. All right. We're up to four. Four homies. Uh, four homies have checked in and told us that it's okay to play this song because it's very offensive, Anthony. Uh-huh. Bubba Johnson, what's up? Yes. How are you doing? Bubba Johnson? Bubba Johnson. Yeah, and you're an African American, too. And you're an African American. You're an African American. All right. All right. I just want to say that I want to hear that song. All right. All right. Bubba Johnson, thank you. Thank you. Don't you dare write it down. We're still up to four. I'm keeping track here. I'm paying attention. It's five. No, we're still up to four. That's five. No, no, no, that's not five. That's five. Bubba Johnson. That guy was as white as a cow. Bubba, what do you want? How do you know? Why? Because of the way he sounds? You're being stereotypical. Hey. I think you're profiling him. You are profiling him. You are profiling him. You are profiling him. I'm in charge of this segment. I'm telling you, we only have four brothers. We're up there. All right. If they're going to trick me, they've got to do a little better than that. Well, homies. Jimmy, what's going on? Hey, what's going on, guys? All right. Since when do you need a nigger's permission to play something? Oh, my gosh. No, you're definitely white. Of course I'm white. All right. We still have four, Anthony. This isn't going well. We need ten. No. Looking for ten. Rhylo. This is Rhylo, white boy. Hey, what's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? This is Rhylo, white boy. Hey, Rhylo, what's going on? I want you to play that song, man. I'm sitting here drinking some grape soda and eating some Cheetos, and I want to hear some offensive songs. Oh, embarrassing. Wait, come on. That's not sex. That's sex. Hey, I'm in your house right now. I'm just stealing a couple of things. See? That sounds okay. Come on. Rhylo, thank you. Oops, sorry. I said a bad word. Yeah, you did. All right, man. Thank you. I want to hear that song. All right, bye. You guys are making a mockery of this. No, I think... We want to hear it. We want to hear it. We want 10 legitimate brothers calling in to tell me it's okay to play this song that's really offensive. Anthony, what's up? What's up, man? I'm going to keep it real with you. I'm half black, half Italian, so you know I got both sides going on, but go ahead and play, man. All right, there we go. Go ahead and play. Seven. Seven, homie. Hey, yo, I got to ask you to everybody at the same time. Hey. I asked you to count me and J.C. All right, yo. All right? Thanks, bro. Pace. Pace. Now, what, are you going to argue that? I'll accept that one. You can argue the point there, Olpe. Uh, Rob? Yo. What's up, Rob? What's going on, boys? I want to be on the air. You're on the air? You're not on the air. I want you to get my vote. You don't sound black, though. I don't sound black. No. Why? I'm black. What's that? That's offensive, Olpe. I'm from Westchester County. That's why I don't sound so black. You're profiling. That's eight. I am saying that. Rob, how can you prove that you're black? How can I prove that I'm black? What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do? Thank you, my brother. Thank you, my brother? Yeah, right? Thank you, Mr. White Man. I mean, what do you want me to say, boys? He's black. I am black. Yeah, I hear a little blackness in your voice. Oh, you hear a little blackness. Thank you. You guys are so nice. All right, Rob. Thank you for giving permission because this song is really bad. Oh, is it that bad? Yep. It can't be no worse than F.B.A. Huh. Killing fetish? Huh. No, it's really, really bad. It's bad. Very offensive. I think Reverend Al is going to march against this song. I'll feel much better if 10 brothers give me the okay to play this song today. All right, well, I'm on the line with my brother. I'll have him call you guys too. All right, man. All right, boys. All right, we got Daryl Strawberry checking in. Daryl? How's it going, fellas? Hey, what's up? Hey, Daryl. Hey, Scott. You guys got any cocaine? No. No, how you doing, man?

Yeah, this is where you go. No, yo. I'm working on the most offensive song, and it's really over the line. You're going to hear it. All right. Well, this contest is starting to shape up quite nicely. We need some brothers, you know, writing some nasty songs out there so it evens out a little bit. Actually, we got a song from a brother today. The smelly steak. She smells. She smells. Pretty funny. So you're going to get ten girls with smelly snacks before you play it? It might be too funny to be offensive, though. And I just like the song. You know what I mean? It's a fine line. You can't be too funny. We got three brand new songs we're playing today. All right. Thank you, Malik. All right. No doubt. Peace. All right. I think that was really a black guy. Yeah. Sure it was. All right. Kuntukinte. Yes. You're on the air. Turn down your radio. Don't listen to your radio, God damn it. All right. Sorry. You're on the air. What's up? Yo, you got to put that phone on, G. All right. Well, how many more do we have to talk to, Opie? Come on. I want some legitimate black guys. I think we have four legitimate black guys. No. I'm counting up to 14 now. Oh, my God. It's obvious. We're just counting the black guys. All right, KK. I'll talk to you later, right? Heywood. Heywood's online. Hey, what's up, guys? What's up? What's up, my brother?

How many did we get there? We got 10. You sure? I'm positive. I was marking them off as we went along, Opie. All right. The latest entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest will be played right after these. It's a doozy. Trust me. Do not turn your radio dial. What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? What's that, a train? Yeah, that coffee, uh, sunk in? Yeah, like I had a go when I first got here, but I was like weighing what's more important, taking a leak, uh, checking my stocks. Taking a leak, checking my stocks. My bladder's still full. Alright, Anthony, I guess we gotta play this song, huh? We're doing the most offensive song contest. I'll just do this a thousand times now, because I gotta tell ya, Steve from the unofficial website in the studio, Anthony, he has a new section on the website where he has all the most offensive songs that are in the running up, where you can listen to them and then you can vote for your favorite. Yeah, yeah, the link is right on the main page. A lot of people are complaining, you gotta put FBA up there. Oh, alright. Well, glad I saw him. That started it all. Honestly, I can't put it on the site. Steven does not want it on the site. He has made it abundantly clear. Oh my God. Oh my God. So, I gotta stick it up there, bud. No, no, if it's gonna piss him off, we can't. Yeah, someone's gotta do another version of it. Well, Mike DeNicola, who's coming in, he wrote Full Blown AIDS with J. Moore. Mostly Mike DeNicola, though. Maybe he could just do his own version of the song. Well, we need a little musical accompaniment. Well, I understand that. We'll figure something out. An acapella version of Full Blown AIDS. Right, what's in the lead? Even though that's not the way we're gonna pick the contest eventually. Baby Rapers in the lead by Hefty March. Hefty March has got, I put it up today. If you go to the page with the poll on it, I think it's 600 votes for that one. And then 200 behind is the one that the Airsick guys did. Kilofetus. Kilofetus. And then way in the back is the Barry Manilow and the How Much Is That Darkie song. I forgot about that one. I think they got maybe like 50 votes each. But the two big ones are the Kilofetus and the Baby Rapers. Well, we got three new ones today. Really heinous. And we're gonna play one of them right now, I guess. Speaking of Baby Rapers, the guy who wrote Baby Rapers and How Much Is That Darkie in the Window, he's got a third entry that we're playing today. This guy's a genius. He's a musical genius when it comes to these offensive songs. He's got a song called Camp Concentration. So, we're gonna need some of our Jewish brothers to call before I play that next song. Oh yeah. And then the Smelly Snatch song. We're gonna have to get ten women at Smell to call up to give permission to play that song as well. Alright. Straight for the jugular, don't they? Really. And we're getting at this point at least ten songs a day. Yeah. Some of them just aren't good enough. Some of the songs are just horrible, horrible quality that we can't even put it on the radio. And some of those are pretty good, pretty creative. If you can't hear them. But it's really hard to hear. They're not funny, yeah. You know? And then others just flat out blow. You gotta keep the songs short and to the point. Yeah, really. A song being sent to this show that sucks? I can't imagine that. I know. And then all the finalists are gonna have performed their songs at the next road show, which should happen in the middle of April, it looks like. I don't know how that guy's gonna do the Candyman. This one is so bad. Where is the Candyman song? We're about ready to play that. So offensive. Steve, you're obviously coming to La Barbatte? Yes. We're leaving at quarter to six and doing the last hour of the show at La Barbatte. Very cool. Which is at 57th Street between 8th and 9th. We'll be there for a couple of hours drinking beer and hanging out and stuff. And you never know what's gonna happen. We're not planning anything. It's not like a road show. But goddamn, we're gonna have fun. Hell yeah. So please join us up here in the area, okay? La Barbatte took care of us last year so we figured we'd go back there. All right. Well, we did hear from enough black people. Yes, we did. Ten. You sure it was ten? I'm positive, Opie. I was begging for the brothers to call to give permission. I wanted to show the boys some respect because this is really offensive and over the top. But you've got to understand that is what the contest is about. The most offensive song ever. So it has to be offensive. I understand that it might hurt some people. It might offend some people. That's what the most offensive song does. Offends. Thank you. All right. So who sent this in? Rick, do you have any info? Does anyone want to claim responsibility for this song? Yeah, this is like a bombing. Someone's got to claim responsibility. It's really bad. Aw, I want to tape down the other... Well, we could get the guy a plug after the song then. Well, Ant, remember the song when we were growing up, The Candyman? Yeah, done by Sammy Davis Jr., The Candyman Can. Well, we have a new version of the song here. All right. The latest entry in the most offensive song ever heard on the Opie and Anthony show. Very excited. A new entry. Oh my God, this could be the most offensive song. I said that about Baby Raper, but I mean this is really offensive. All right. It's called The KKK Man. Remember, these aren't being judged on being funny. It's not how funny it is, it's how offensive it is. Yeah, and I'm going on record. This is pretty damn offensive. How big the lynch mob is outside the studio after they've been playing it. Oh, I know. And remember, of course, the views expressed in these songs are not necessarily those of the Opie and Anthony show or WNEW. Thank you. And here it is, Anthony. But they are of Rick. Okay. Here we go. Hold on to your hats. Grab your seats. Fuck off. All right, everybody. Gather around. The Ku Klux Klan's here. What kind of niggas you want? Burn niggas, hang niggas, nappy head niggas, concrete niggas in cement shoes. Anything you want, you come to the right man. Tom, the KKK Man. Who can take a nigga? Hager from a tree? And cause a kiss for lonin' kill his family. The KKK Klan. The KKK Klan can. The KKK Klan can cause us feel the world with hate and wear a funny white hood. Who can kill Bill Cosby? One to knuckle two. Bring back the little rascals, bake loemah smelling poo. The KKK Klan. The KKK Klan can. The KKK Klan can cause us feel the world with hate and wear a funny white hood. The KKK hates all his stupid hates from Shult and Dr. Dr. Zayas. Especially NBA players. Stack em up like Jews in Lyre. Niggas, niggas, niggas. Niggas smell like shit. They take a million showers but they must be using spit. The KKK Klan. The KKK Klan can. The KKK Klan can cause us feel the world with hate and wear a funny white hood. The KKK hates all his stupid hates from Shult and Dr. Zayas. Especially NBA players. Stack em up like Jews in Lyre. Niggas. Niggas invested niggas. Niggas hanging from a tree. Niggas sent within their race dislike bestiality. The KKK Klan. The KKK Klan can. The KKK Klan can cause us feel the world with hate and wear a funny white hood. Wear a funny white hood. The KKK can cause us feel the world with hate and wear a funny white hood. Wear a funny white hood. The KKK. The KKK. The KKK. The KKK. The KKK. The KKK. The KKK. The KKK. Okay, terrific. Oh my God. I think we have a runaway winner. That's what we said about the baby raping. I know and now I mean could there possibly be a more offensive song out there? The phones aren't even ringing. I think people are in shock Anthony. I told you guys, I warned you. Pete from Brooklyn, instant feedback. Ding ding ding. Okay, horrific. This is up there. A lot of people just saying this is it. That is the most offensive song ever. Jerome, what's going on? Yo, what's up white boys? How are you Jerome? Yo, this is Jerome from Harlem World. Yo, that song? Who wrote that song? Who wrote that song? Joe and Bob. Joe and Bob? Where they live. Hold on. I'll tell you something. I think we have a contest now. Yo, my bad. I won't be doing that. Have you ever heard a more offensive song in your life? Yo. Yo, Opie and Anthony. Yeah, you're on the radio. Jerome, let's go. Have you ever heard a more offensive song than that? Yo, I got my niggas down here in Red Hook. Yeah. And we're about to come down to the studio. Nah, nah, nah, nah. We're going to get medieval on here. Nah, nah, nah, nah. We didn't write it. I warned you. I warned you with the curses. Curses again. My bad, my bad. Are you a black guy? Nah, I'm white. I'm just drinking beers. I'm very black. Alright, Jerome. Thank you. Alright. Well, that was a very, very offensive song. I think it's in the lead. Let's go to Jenna. Jenna, what's going on? What the heck was that? It was the most offensive song. That was, that was, that was just, no, no, no, no. I was trying. Your stupid spaz would not get me on. No, it's the spaz's credit. He's out of the state right now. Yeah, it's the spaz clone answering the phone today. Stinky. Nah, nah, nah. See, I was wrong. Are you a black lady? Oh, yeah. Alright, would you have given us permission before you heard that song to play that? Hmm, probably. I told you it was bad. I try to tell everyone it was bad. Well, I never heard the other two. So, I don't know. I think it's the camp concentration and She Smells Strange. See, now that's horrible because I'm a black Jew. Oh, really? You're just doubly offending me. And if you smell, then you're in all three categories of the songs today. I said only doubly. You can stop there. We got a song from a brother that's really funny next called She Smells Strange. Alright. Now we're going to play next as we play all our latest entries in the most offensive song contest. That might be fair. Alright. I'm pouring in that this is a runaway winner. The most horrific song ever. Makes the baby raper sound like a lullaby. Really? I'm going to get fired for listening to this. People checking in. This by far the most offensive song I've ever heard. I think the baby raper is more offensive. Tim. Phillip, what's up? Hey, it's me. I'm a black guy. I'm calling. Yeah. I think the baby raper song is way more offensive than this black song. Really? That's all it is. You're a black guy and you thought that last song was funny? Yeah. I didn't think this was that offensive at all. Alright, so you still think the baby raper song is worse? Definitely. Well, thank you, Phillip. Actually, for both of you guys, you guys are pussies. It takes a lot to play this song. I know. You're right. Thank you. Karen checking in. That was the most offensive song I ever heard. Kicks ass over baby raper. I'm listening to it with two black coworkers and they are not laughing. Of course they're not laughing. That's why I needed the permission of the community to play that song. I'm not going to get the fuckery of my vote there. I wanted ten people to call up to give us permission, Anthony. Okay, this is Danielle. Okay, I'm a black woman. No lie. And I'm crying. I wanted to call you before but I'm at work and can only hit you on the computer. My goodness, I am offended. But is she crying because she's laughing or? She says offended yet tickled because that mess was hilarious. Alright, Chris, what's going on? Oh my God. I got to go home. I got to drive through the project. I'm driving and I rolled the windows up and turned the radio all the way down. Well thank God it wasn't a sunny day where you just have the windows down and cranking up the radio show. Like, oh, okay, here we go. Oh man, this is going to be riddled with bullets if that happens. Alright, Chris, thank you. Alright, take care guys. Bye. More instant feedback coming in? Wanted to know if John Rocker helped pin it. Let's see. You should send this to Bob Jones University. Okay, terrific. Alright, Chris, you're next on WNAW. What's up? Alright, Chris doesn't want to talk. Let's go to Matt. Matt, you're next on WNAW. How are you? What's up? How are you? Great. The worst part about that song was listening to the little kids in the back singing KKK. I felt like I got bass paper out of my head and now I'm going to be singing a little kid song. That was hysterical. As soon as I heard the song, it's like, oh crap, put the windows up. I don't want anybody hearing this. Alright, Matt, thank you. Thanks, dude. Bye. Yeah, Rick? I just got a page from my wife. She's offended by the song. She told me not to come home late. Get out of here. Come on. Is she really pissed? She's like, that's just disgusting. You guys are a-holes. You're lying. Come on, we're just playing it. Doesn't anyone realize that the idea behind the contest is to offend? We can't candy coat the most offensive song contest. How could you have a most offensive song contest and not play the songs because they're too offensive? It's a contest to see who can write the most offensive song. And it's not the most offensive black song. We have hit many different areas with this contest. Yeah. My God, man. We've offended the abortion people. We offended the, oh what, it's okay to suck fetuses out and hear their little bones crack? Yeah, that's funny. The, uh, the kilofitas song? Done to footloose. That was a catchy little ditty. That guy singing was really offensive. Something tells me he really didn't have to work it right in that either from the way he sounded. Something tells me he sits on his porch and just writes that. He was just waiting for this contest. It was already penned. Tony, what's going on? Hey, yeah. You know, um, I'm black. Yeah. And, uh, my whole take on this is the guys that wrote this song, I mean, we know where they're coming from. Joe and Bob. That they would take the time to write it. How does ONA feel about this song? How do you guys feel about it? I think it probably offends a hell of a lot of people. It's very offensive. Yeah, but that's what we're going for with this contest. I'm talking about you guys personally. How do you guys feel about it? I'll just sign up. I'm going to get in my car and come down there. No, it's obviously wrong, but we're... I think it's horrific. But we're trying to, we're trying to, like, hit every area here with this most offensive song contest. I don't think anybody in their right mind would listen to that song and go, oh, I don't see a problem with it. Right. I don't think it's that bad. It's wrong on many levels. Oh my God. But we decided to do this most offensive song contest and you can't sugarcoat it, you know? No, I mean, that's it. If you... That's true. Like in the words of Dice, I'm an equal opportunity offender and I think that's what it comes down to. Well, that's what, you know, we try, that's one of our mottos. We try to live by that. I mean, if you, if we just read some of the titles of the other songs we've played, you can see that we are, we're reaching all over the place. We had an AIDS song called Full Blown AIDS. We had an abortion song, Kill a Fetus. Yeah. We had the baby raper song. One thing I want to see, if this guy wins, I want to see him claim his prize. He's going to have to go through a gauntlet. Forget about it. Okay, now the winner is going to perform his song live on our stage here during one of the Opie and Anthony Road shows. James Earl Jones, what's going on? James Earl Jones hung up, Anthony. Where was he? He was very, very pissed off. I would have liked to have heard from James. Alright, let's go to Kim then. Kim, what's going on? Guys, that is the best song by far. Hands down. That was probably the most offensive song ever. I didn't think Baby Raper would get beaten. The Baby Raper song sucked. The Kill a Fetus song was good. Yeah. Okay. Well, you know, if you're going to vote, by the way, I hope you've heard all the songs, you know, because a lot of people might not have heard the Baby Raper song. Okay, maybe not. We're looking for the people that have heard all the songs and can make a fair decision on this contest. I've got to listen to your show almost every day. Yeah. Okay, so I think I've heard all the songs. Are you a black lady? Yes, I am. Thank God. Do I sound white today? Well, it's weird, but it just makes me feel a little better knowing that a black lady thought that song was really funny and offensive. That's all. Certain things I can't take offense to. Honestly, I really thought it was funny. Okay. And I did laugh at it. Alright. The Baby Raper song, yeah, it was creepy. Yeah. Oh, and that one. Oh my God. Wow. I know, the Baby Raper song was really, really creepy. I thought I didn't like it. Alright. And I didn't think the lyrics were that great either. Okay. But this one, guys, it better win. Alright, Kim, thank you. Thank you, guys. Alright, bye. Bye. We'll take one more call here, Anthony. Ned, you're next on WNEW. Hey, how are you guys doing? Great, Ned. Oh, that's funny as hell. Yeah? I mean, it's offensive, but what could be more offensive than raping a baby? I mean, really. Yeah. You know. Yeah, well, somehow we're going to have to vote on this eventually. We'll have to have some type of criteria, but there you go. One of the songs that's in the running. Criteria? The KKK man, Done To The Candy Man. How much longer are you going to run this contest? Well, we're going on vacation, and the entries are just starting to pile in. It took you guys a while to get creative and get your songs in, so we're getting like 10 or 12 a day. We've got two more to play today alone. I'll keep putting polls on the website if you want. Yeah, keep the polls going on the unofficial website. There is another three that just came in. We just started the show. Three more songs just came in that we haven't even been able to listen to before. Yeah, and I've got two more to listen to. Right here. Just between three and four into my box. Yeah, this contest is just exploding, so we're going to have to keep it going for a little longer. I think we're going to, should we set up a cutoff date? Should people get their songs in? Yeah, we'll figure that out after vacation. We're, you know. But you probably have at least another two weeks to get your stuff in, all right? Thank you, Ned. Thank you. Bye. Let's say, oh my freaking God, my mom just happened to come in when the KKK song was on. You had to see the look on her face. It was priceless. You sure you're still going out later? Todd, what's going on? Hey, guys. Hi. You know what? That was probably one of the most offensive songs I've heard. Let me tell you something. It could be beat. Yeah, no one on our listeners, I think it can be beat. I've heard some bad songs. I've got a friend who's written some really messed up stuff, but let me tell you, I think it could be topped. I didn't think Baby Raper would be beat, but that one, man, I think that one might be it. It's so weird. Every time we hear one of these, we're like, that's it. Contest is over. It's got to be. Most offensive songs, man. The next one we play, you know, is worse. Thank you, Todd. You guys swallow. All right, man. Let's go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. Ivan, what's going on? I'm going to go to Ivan. What are you crazy? Stupid? You're like a madman. No, I had it on normal and then I said, can I get a receipt? And then she like leaned in and she goes, what are you listening to? Because she heard like the beat. I put it up a little bit. She's like, that is a fat walk. The hell are you? She's yelling at me. I'm like, it's a radio show. Relax, lady. All right, well we warned you guys. I don't know what else to tell you, so. All right, dude. All right, thank you, Ivan. You guys suck, bro. All right, man. All right. That's the iconic we saw last night on TV. He was really funny. We got to get him in here. The guy that does the I-1 commercial on TV, we saw him last night. He's hilarious. He does the Saturn commercials, too. Does he? Yeah. Chuck from the Radio Chick show, checking in real fast here. Chuck, what's going on? Hey, man. I'm scared to come back to work, man. Why? I don't know if this is the right environment anymore, guy. I don't know. That was a goddamn funny song. I had to leave the studio because you know, you guys had like tall leprechauns out in the studio. I was afraid after the song they might want to break out a game of netherball. That's where you tie a nigger to a pole and bat him around until you run out of rope. Come on, man. Jesus, Chuck. Chuck, Chuck is that word more than Richard Fryer. Jesus Christ. You're trying to claim that word is your own, man. Well, I made it up. Well, Chuck, being a black guy, what'd you think of that song, our latest entry in the Most Defensive Song Contest? Well, you know, when I heard it, I was sitting in traffic reading my most current issue of Aint Magazine, age-infested niggas today. Magic Johnson's on the cover. And actually, I thought the song was actually pretty damn funny, to tell you the truth. It is offensive. But I've got to go and sing Baby Rafer to my daughter now. So I'll see you guys all. All right. We'll see you when we get back from vacay. There he goes, Chuck from the Radio Chick Show. Well, Ann, let's take a break. And what the hell? We're doing well. Let's get into the other entry. Another entry, yes. Right after commercials. And what's the name of this one? She Smells Strange. She Smells Strange. By Daz. I can't wait. We were going to throw this one away, but I said, no, Rick, I really like this one. Oh, wow. Pulling it out. I just like the style this guy's got. It sounds like an old rap song or something. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's a little bit of a rock. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It sounds like an old rap song or something. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe you guys can listen to it and tell me what it sounds like because it reminds me of an old rap song. Okay? All right. We'll do that next. Stay there. Opie, you scum, and Anthony. Your new name is Dick. Opie and Anthony. What changed you into such demonic little bastards? One, oh, seven, six, oh, WNEW. Kick ass. Kick ass. Anthony, real fast, got to talk about Mountain Dew. The official name of Mountain Dew. The official name of Mountain Dew. The official name of Mountain Dew.

I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. Let's go to Tony. Tony, what's going on? What's up, fellas? That song is hilarious. Yeah? Oh, really? Yeah, bro. I don't know. I might sound whiter than Earl, but I'm black also. Okay. Hey, tell Linda I said kill whitey, though. Rick's wife? No, no. The one who was on the phone before. Oh, yeah, I know. She said, yeah, that song is hilarious. All right, cool, man. Take it easy. Thank you. Appreciate the brothers calling in, understanding that it's a joke. Well, it's the most offensive song. Right. So it's got to be offensive. Now, will we have another one? Yes, we do, Ant. Do we have to talk to these guys real fast? Are they here? Mike and Frank, are they outside? Yeah. Oh. Remember on Raw this past Monday night, the huge FDA sign with the skeleton? Oh, yeah. It was all over the TV? Uh-huh. It's here? Look at it. Look at it. That's the famous sign, Ant. There it is. There it is. We got Steve from the unofficial website. We'll get some footage of it, but there it is, the big FDA. Hey, guys. How you doing? All right. Who's who? I'm Frank. Hey, Frank. And you're Mike. What's up? I got to say, I was sitting on my couch watching Raw's War this past Monday night. The signage was just incredible. The wow signs. Huge. Okay, terrific. And all of a sudden, like halfway up on the right side a little bit, right? Yeah. As you're looking at the ring, is this huge FDA sign with a skeleton hanging from the sign? I swear to you, I almost puked. I was laughing so freaking hard. The greatest part of this whole thing was sitting there. I've got a whole family of little kids in front of me. They all have these little paper homemade The Rock signs, this, that, and here I am with my full-blown AIDS sign. Yeah. Awesome. What does that mean? Did other people in the arena know what it was and come up to you and stuff? A couple of little chants. Yeah, and we had Psycho Mark coming over pointing at the sign. It was great, but couldn't get any more offensive. Well, I guess we can now, but yeah. Yeah. Never say never. Never say never is right. I don't think people will be bringing signs from that last song to the rest of the match. No. Steve from the Unofficial website getting footage of the sign so he can put it on the website. It's a great sign. I did get a message from the devil for you. He said, first of all, he said be prepared to pay Anthony his money for his race. Oh, and if you happen to wind up in hell over your vacation, bring a parker because that's not what we're doing. Yeah, freezing over this time of year. Just about. Are you guys hanging and coming to La Barbe with us or what? Yeah, absolutely. It'll be good. By the way, I don't know if you remember, do you remember the I Love Camel Toast sign? Yes. I was behind that sign. That was me and my friend Mike. I Love Camel Toast. Took a movie poster and kind of wrote it up and we almost destroyed it so we couldn't bring it down. I love Camel Toast. There was a homeless guy downstairs with an FM Talk at 1027 t-shirt flying a remote controlled helicopter. Yeah, very funny. He said to say hi as well. You're just a regular comedian, aren't you? Frank's a comedian. Mike's a comedian. Mike's a comedian. I mean, Mike. Yeah, get it right. Sorry, man. What are we doing driving down 86th Street? I'm from Brooklyn and you don't drive down 86th Street. I had business. Are you a Pakistani or a Cougine? I had some business to tend to. I had some Pakistanis to run over. It's my new mission. I've done some illegal stuff but I have never, ever gone onto signs. He was on the sidewalk. I've walked on the sidewalk too and that I've never done. He was actually on the sidewalk on 86th Street? No, he was on the sidewalk right outside the building. On 56th Street. He was on the road 7. Right in front of Hooters. He drove right by Hooters on the sidewalk. I had to get into the bucket. Let the girls live, guys. Are you guys going to play the concentration song? Yeah, we're going to get to that. First we've got to play the other one. We're going to play She Smells Strange. She's definitely looking forward to that. One shout out for me? Yeah. Thanks. She's listening. My dad's listening for the first time. Uh-oh. He picked the wrong day to start listening. My friend Yvonne at work was the only other fan in the entire building. If you get this station. All right, Mike. I just have to say, go Jericho, go. Thank you, Frank. Guys, thanks for stopping by. We're going to hook you guys up with a ton of stuff. If you want to hang, we're going to La Barbat for the last hour of the show today. Awesome. Where is that again? 57th between 8th and 9th, Anthony. La Barbat. All right, well, they got from 6 to 8. There they go with that. That's a great sign, isn't it? Yes. Full blown 8th. Jesus Christ. What the hell is going on? All right. I promise we'll play the next entry next, OK? Yeah, I got to hear this. All right. I'm not going to play the whole thing yet. I heard a piece of it. We have two more songs to get to. She smells strange and camp concentration before we leave to go to La Barbat today. Please join us if you're in the area. Steve, real fast, we've got to take a break here. Steve? Yo, what's up, guys? Hey, how are you? All right, I was at the show last night. Brian Regan? Yeah, great. Yeah, he was awesome. How funny is he? Oh, he's great. He's for a clean comic. He's phenomenal. Yes. Yo, what was up with Seguin Muck? Did he sit at the big boy's table? Oh, you saw that? Yeah, he was at my table. It's right behind you. Oh, you were that? OK. Why didn't you say hi to us? I wanted to leave you guys alone. No, we don't care, man. Come on up. Yeah, Psycho Mark's at his own table. Well, what happened was he told us he wasn't coming, then he shows up. We had like a table of eight. Psycho Mark comes walking in, just loud as could be, and they put him at your table with your date or your wife. Yeah, with my girlfriend. Your girlfriend, and it was like the kiddie table for Psycho Mark. He had to sit by himself with you guys. Yeah, but somebody should have gave the... Dude, I had a shot in the ear. Yeah, I had a shot in the ear. Yeah, I had a shot in the ear. Yeah, I had a shot in the ear. Yeah, I had a shot in the ear. Oh my God. Once again, just proving the fact that we've stated here over and over again, the Chick comics just blow. They blow. Oh my God. We've talked about it on the show, and as soon as they introduced her... We all went... You heard that's all at the table. It's like, I'm not a very funny lady. Aww. Well, time to catch up on some conversation and have some food. Yeah, have some food. Yeah, you can't eat your food, right? So... Jerry Lewis, brilliant man. Steve, thank God you were a friend of the show, because at one point Mark is making like the BJ face and stuff, and that's when you finally said something to him, and I go to Ann, I go, Ann, I think Mark's going to get punched finally. Because I thought you guys were offending. No, not at all. He was playing with that champagne bottle. Yeah, he was giving the champagne to you-know-what, and he's... He's yelling at the female comic. You guys think Psycho Mark is like, he puts this act on him, but he is as real as they come. He just doesn't give an F. No, he was real cool. He was just so funny that he was sitting by himself. Because he was by himself. You guys weren't really talking to him or anything. Then he made the BJ gesture, and I'm like, here it comes. Because you said something, and I thought you were going to say, hey man, you're offending us or something? No, not at all. He was awesome. Cool. You guys are great. Yeah, but Brian Regan, absolutely hilarious. I don't even know if there are tickets available for the weekend. You might want to call Caroline's. I jumped on it right away. Once you guys mentioned it, I totally forgot about it, but I said, I've got to get tickets to comedy. Yeah, we don't go to see many comedians, so that one we had to. I tried to get you more. I couldn't get in for nothing. No. Next time maybe. God, he only had 20 shows. I know. We all sold out every time I called. Sold out, sold out, sold out. Well, next time you just called earlier. Yeah, I live in Brooklyn, so I was going to drive all the way down there to see if I could get in or not. All right, Steve, thank you. All right, thanks. Thank you. And we've got to take a quick break. Then we'll play the next entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest. Very impressive. And Psycho Mark has handed me another Anthony Blooper reel. You had to record a Rockaway Bedding spot because we're going on vacation? At some point, I guess. And now what? He pulled some more stuff over. He's got some more outtakes from you trying to read copy. Great. What's the matter, Mark? I can't even remember which one this is. All I can say is you're a professional. Oh, well, you know how I enjoy these things. So I am. Let me just tell you before, and I'm an on-air guy, I like doing the things on the air. In the studio, when we have to do these things, it feels fake. I don't like doing them. Yeah. But, you know, I love the product. I love Rockaway Bedding. And when we talk about it on the air, I have no problem. I'm able to say what I want. When I have to sit there and read a script and stuff, and the way the sales people write it sometimes, it doesn't feel as natural, you know? No. Well, we'll get to the bloopers. Anthony Bloopers in just a bit here, too. Looking so forward to another round as Anthony looks like an a-hole. So much more to do. So much more to do before we leave the studio and go to La Barbat to have some beers with you guys before we go on vacation. 57th Street between 8th and 9th. We'll be there from 6 till, I don't know, at least 8 o'clock, if not longer. OK? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Most offensive song. Another entry. Next. This day's relaxing in my anger. But it's better to be silent than to be a lot of fool. They're just making me move on down. Don't know why it's filling the copy. Oh, make a note of it. Happy Saint Matthew Day. A good day, New York. I, Mayor Quimby, would like to be your senator. If elected, I would use your tax dollars to put Opie and Anthony on radio stations across this great land. Syndication now. Pretty stacker, too. The world's strongest fat burner. Yeah. Doesn't feel like spring's on the way today, but it's coming. It's coming. Yes, it is, Opie. And you're going to want to lose a few pounds before you start getting into the spring clothes. That's right, Anthony. Yes. That's right. And how are you going to do it? Forty million Americans are too big, Anthony, and they need the stacker, too. We're hearing from a lot of the faithful listeners that have tried the product in the last year or so, and they have been very, very happy with the results, Anthony. Very happy. The stacker, a lot of weight. The stacker, too. It does the three things, right, Anthony? Yes, it burns the weight. It's the world's strongest fat burner. It builds on the muscle. And it cuts down on the cravings to snack during the day. And it gives you that boost energy. A little pep in your step that you need to finish the day as a palisade weight. All right, check out stacker2, the world's strongest fat burner at www.stacker2.com or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.

What other radio shows can give you like intelligence talk about stock and girls playing what's in my pants? Yes. The Opie and Anthony Show. 1027 WNEW. Reading some of the instant feedback. A lot of people loving the last entry in the most offensive song contest, Anthony. Loving it? Is that really the proper word? Yes. I think getting behind it on its way to victory is one thing. Because obviously it's offensive enough to win. Uh-huh. Putting it down as your favorite to win. But loving it? Loving it. Wow. Listen to some feedback in from Russ T. Trombone. Mr. Trombone writes, he's from Jersey. Wacky. There was a man from the Freehold Business Association, he had on a FBA hat. People were just laughing at him and he didn't know why. That's pretty good. That is pretty funny. FBA. Alright, let's go to John. John, you're next on WNEW. How you doing, guys? I don't want to eat. Hey, what's up, John? I found a place where OK Terrific isn't so funny. Alright. Tuesday night, my wife was taking care of the Hummer Club duties. Sure, give me a little action. Alright. Yep. And as soon as she got done, I said, OK, terrific. She wasn't very happy. OK, terrific. Looks like it might be self-serve for a little while. Yeah. And we have some OK Terrific shirts we're giving out at La Barbat. How many do we have? Not many, huh? We have about 25 OK Terrific shirts we'll throw out to whoever shows up at La Barbat. I'm already about 90 miles north of La Barbat. Well, then we won't see you this time. It's more just to quickly have a few beers before we go on vacation. I look for you guys every single day from 3 to 5.30 on the ride. OK, terrific. Thank you, John. OK, terrific. OK, terrific. Alright, John. Bye. That never gets old. Fifi! Hey, baby. What's up, Fifi? What's up? Are you a transvestite? I'm a woman. Don't get into my face. I was just going to say that. A voice like that and a name like Fifi. My name is Fifi. Yo, my stage name is Fifi. You know you like it. Is this the kind of you are? Are you a black lady? Yeah. Yeah. Get down on your knees. I'm a black lady. I'm a black lady. I'm a black lady. I'm a black lady. I'm a black lady. I'm a black lady. Yeah. Get down with that. So, what's up? What was so offensive about that song? Well, I didn't. Oh, did you hear it? I didn't. You heard it. Well, I'm glad you guys are calling and saying it wasn't that bad. I mean, it's no big deal. I mean, it wasn't even funny. I mean, make them feel funny. It's not supposed to be funny. No, it's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be offensive. The next one that we play, it has some comedic value to it. Yeah, I mean, you know, it was alright. I don't understand. I wasn't really offended by it. You know, he's not a kind of a doofy. Alright. Well, thank you, Fifi. You're welcome, sweetie. Have a great weekend. You too. You sound like a guy, yo. Why? I don't know. Well, I'm not. You sure? I'll prove it to you. I don't know. You had one, that other one come in at one time. China? Yeah. That was, uh, that was fairly convincing. Charlie, I'm all woman. All woman. If you saw me, you would know. Alright. Well, you know what she sounds like? Warriors? You best make your way back to China. I'm not going to go to China. I'm going to go to the US. I'm going to go to the US. I'm going to go to the US. I'm going to go to the US. You know what they say about women with deep delusions, right? What? They got deep something else? Yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Well, Fifi, do you want that? Do I want that, Elaine? You just might. Well, Fifi, you want to come down? We got to check you out. Yeah. Yeah? Uh-huh. Alright, hold on a second. My money's on the fact that you're a guy or used to be a guy. I'm not a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. I'm a guy. You said you're a guy or used to be a guy. Have we ever played What's in Your Pants with a black woman? No, we have not, Anthony. We'll have to try that. No? Well, you want to play a quick round of What's in My Pants? Okay. Alright, where are you, Fifi? I'm in Connecticut. Ooh. Okay. I'm at work right now, too. Is there anyone around? Yeah, my girl. Your girl? Yep. Yep. Are you allowed to, you know, pull down your pants and rub the phone down there or what? Hey, Jill, do you mind if I pull down my pants? And rub the phone down there? Yeah, uh-huh. She's going to turn the other way. Alright, she's going to turn the other way. Alright, alright. Alright, unbuckle the pants. Well, Fifi, what do you look like, first of all? I don't know. I don't get up, no. I need a visual, though, Anne. I look like Little Kim. Little Kim? Oh, yeah? Oh, wow. Now I'm into this. Really? Really. Do you walk around with one boob exposed? Well, sometimes. You have nice breastages? Yeah, pretty nice. The whole package is pretty good. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Alright. And what are you wearing today? Well, I have on this black miniskirt, actually. It's got high boots. Nice. And a little green shirt for St. Patrick's Day. Give us a little weight measurement thing. About 5'3", 120. Because your baby got back, right? You know that, baby. That's right. You know that, baby. Look at that, Opie. He knows that. Baby got that back. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I've had it since I was little. Alright. Look at Opie. Alright. Alright. You are too light, man. Now you sound like a brother. Yeah. Trust me. I'm trying. I want to go black one time. You'll never go back. I want to go black. So, alright, what's your measurements? Um, well, 32 waist. What's that cup? Wait, 32 what? What cup size? Yeah, like, you're probably like a B then. 32 big? Okay, good. Nice size, you know. Not too big. They're real, you know. Sure. Nice brown nipples, you know. Great. It'll look like Hershey Kisses, didn't it? Okay, terrific. They look more like, um, what's that other one? The drops. The drops? Just the nipple now. Not the whole thing. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go back to the baby. I'm going to go back to the baby. I'm going to go back to the baby. I'm going to go back to the baby. I'm going to go back to the baby. I'm going to go back to the baby. Okay. I like the slow fade. The slow fade? Yeah, like color-wise. Yeah, the nip goes like slowly fades into the breast. Arreola into breastages. Yeah, that's how it is. Slow fade. I don't like where it looks like it's a Hershey Kiss. We saw a few of those at the last road show. No offense to the ladies because I'm sure there's guys that are into that. We're all into, you know, different things. But where it looks like it's just a Hershey Kiss in the middle of the breast, it's just a nipple now. It's just a nipple now. It's just a nipple now. It's just a nipple now. It's just a nipple now. It's just a nipple now. It's just a nipple now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hey. Very fun. Let's play some games. If you didn't already, that would be one thing we're going to play. Let's just play one, two, three, four, and five, and then it's back to zero. Okay. Go. Go. Okay. Add two up or two down and you're about to explode. Go. Go. Go. Go. Pretty bad intro. I don't know what it says. Alright, that's up and down. That's up and down. Now the side to side motion, again about five times. Okay. Okay, and now the circular motion please. Circular? Yes. Okay, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. Without a doubt. I have to be absolutely sure. I would bet a lot of money. I would bet a lot of money on this one. I am so positive. Alright. You're positive about what? You know what type of a... Now let everyone guess before you say anything, okay? Yeah, don't say a word until we ask you. I have to go first. Okay, go ahead. Without a doubt, she has Michael Jordan's head in a leg locker. You think it's a wood floor? Complete wood floor. Alright. No doubt in my mind. Now we'll go to Rick. I think I'm going to go with Mr. T. Mr. T, a mohawk? A mohawk. Okay. Unofficial Steve, would you like to... I'm going to say Hitler mustache, actually. Hitler mustache. I think so. I think I'm surely certain. Wow, that is a real bold... I think so. Hey Steve, real fast. What does J. Moore call you again? I was trying to remember. Mush. Thank you. Thanks Rick. I had forgotten. And you know how inappropriate that frigging name is? Mush. Because I beat him twice. I beat him twice. Alright, it's you. It's you. I'm going to say... Fight clip right here, Rick. I am going to say she has a natural, as they call it. A link? Just a natural. Natural triangle? Yeah, yeah. I'm going to say that she hasn't really dealt with it as far as shaping or anything. Kind of like a link from the mod squad's head in the leg lock type thing. Just leaving the hedges untrimmed. Pull rack filled with afro hair? Yeah, take a pull rack off the pull table. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Pull rack. Her Christ. Of the food table, right? Put it in your lap. Fill it with afro hair. That's what it looks like. That's what I'm saying. It gets a little triangle. Okay, I guess we're ready. Fefe, what is in your pants? Triangle. Yeah, yeah. It's shaped as nice. You know something, Opie? I was thinking wood floor. You're here this bit? It wasn't loud enough. Yeah, I noticed wood floor's was very loud. I notice it sounded like here. Do the circular motion again. There are sharp points on your head. I've got to point something out to Anthony. It didn't sound as much that time, but it sounded the first time she did it, like that squeaking when you're in gym class and all of a sudden, you know, the ball in your belly is on the wood floor and it's kind of like, eee, eee. I heard that too. But what got me was the consistent sound and the volume wasn't too loud because I've noticed the Baldi's really are loud. It sounds like a lot of hair. And then I'm surprised at the Mohawk and the Hitler mustache thing because the consistency of the sound did not change once. Side to side, up and down, it was all hair all the time. I was thinking either a triangle or wood floor and I went with the wood floor. You hit it. Well, thanks for playing What's in My Pants. And hold on a line because we've got to get you down here. We want to see what you look like because part of me still thinks you're a man. Well, you'll be surprised. There's a guy on line one, Steve, he goes, this is a guy. Yuck. Come on, Steve. Oh, that would have sounded different playing What's in My Pants. I know, right? Like going over a speed bump. Speed bump. Okay, terrific. All right, thank you, Peepee. Hold on a line. Let's go to Joe. Joe, you're next on WAW. Hey, guys, how's it going, man? Great. Listen, I play OK, terrific. I download it off the website on my computer all the time at work. Yeah. But having conversations. We're trying to figure out where it's from. Or did you guys just make it up? We just made it up. It was, no one was. We'll tell everyone. You know when you hear those Opie and Anthony sweepers with the station voice, like, Opie and Anthony. Yeah, right. Two A-holes. On N-E-W. Well, the guy who does that, we get him on the phone to read, you know, stupid lines for the radio show and stuff. And then Jimmy does a great job with the production for the radio show. He puts them together. The DJ voice guy. What? The DJ voice guy. Yeah. Yeah. So he's got the DJ voice guy on the phone. He's like from Canada or something. And Jimmy, like he had to read all these lines. And Jimmy goes, well, I guess we're done with you today. And the guy goes, OK, terrific. OK, terrific. And Jimmy isolates the dudes. You got to use this thing. And we have been in it. Do we have the whole sentence that that came from? Does he go, OK, terrific. I'll talk to you. You know. I think he was being sarcastic at the time, too. Like, OK, terrific. You know. It's hysterical. It's almost adaptable for anything. We're at work and the boss walks out of the room and he's like, yeah, OK, terrific. You know. Yeah. OK, terrific. All right. Thank you, Joe. Guys, what's in store for our worst of next week? We're trying to keep it fresh. So we've been working pretty hard on it. There should be some good stuff. Pretty much the highlights of the last three months. Cool. All right. Have a great vacation, guys. Hey, thank you. We appreciate that. The low lights. All right, man. Bye. Bye. Anthony, Fifi has a pair of turntables in her pants. It sounded like Grandmaster Flash scratching records, didn't it? At one point it was making like a rr-s-s-s-s. That was Dennis Domenis. We've got to give him a credit for that. More like Grandmaster Gans. Very good. Pair of turntables. Grandmaster Gans. All right, Anthony, once again, we were thrown off track there. Oh, my God. We were supposed to play the latest entry in the Most Defensive Song Contest, but Fifi was kind of cool, right? You know something? Let me explain something. We don't do this on purpose. When I was growing up, I used to listen to a certain radio show every morning. And he'd pull this crap all the time. And I said, if I ever did radio, I would never do this. But we don't do it on purpose. Promising something coming up and then go, okay, well, we didn't get to it, but we'll get to it right after this break. And the break, we come back from the break, not even talk about what we said we would go to. And then at the end of that break, when we're ready to go into another break, go, oh, we didn't get to it. I know, but at least it's- Oh, and I hated that as I was listening. Know what the difference is, though? What? He used to milk it for a week. We're just milking it for an hour and not on purpose because we go off on these tangents. Yeah, that's true. Anthony, right up to commercials. Okay. Swear to you, we play the latest entry in the most offensive song contest. All right. A song by Daz called She Smells Strange. Okay, terrific. The Opie and Anthony Show. Oh, it's going to be wild. B-b-b-boom. Ah, or stupidity on the way. R-r-r-r-room. Ha-ha-ha-ha. 127 WNEW. Fire stopper. Prodigy. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, yeah, wait, wait. I don't have it, Karen. Hey, hey, hey. Why isn't that on my little wacky machine? Come on, Rick. Well, when you get back from vacation, we're going to get you a bunch of brand new sounds. Yeah. The Scott Muni Virgin. Virgin. Virgin. Virgin. Virgin. Okay. I got a beard, too. All right. See, people are... We don't need any more beer, people. We have so much beer inside of us. Beer. Anthony, Mike DeNicola. I see. In the studio, Jay Moore's buddy there, and he actually can get three words in edgewise today. Yeah, Mike DeNicola. Amazing. A comic that does quite well on his own. Yeah. He shows up with Jay Moore every time Jay's here and he doesn't get to talk because Jay pretty much takes over the radio show. And it's pretty much how it goes. When Jay's here, I think we turn it into the Jay Moore show. Yeah. He's going to have his own sweepers next time he visits. All day. All day. On NEW. Jay Moore. Okay, terrific. WNEW. Buddy, what's up, Mike? I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity now. And I'll tell you why. Mike DeNicola, the author of Full Blown AIDS, Anthony. Full Blown AIDS, FBA, as it's been known. Now, what has happened to your career since pinning the hit FBA? Well, you remember. Since appearing on Starzert, where you're saying, FBA, we're going to do a full-blown AIDS show. You're saying, FBA, we're going to do a full-blown AIDS show. You're saying, FBA, we're going to do a full-blown AIDS show. You're saying, FBA, we're going to do a full-blown AIDS show. You're saying, FBA, we're going to do a full-blown AIDS show. I'm going to do a full-blown AIDS show. It was the first show Friday. And please welcome Mike DeNicola, about 60 people. Oh, and I, full-blown AIDS. The club doesn't know. They don't know. People are giving condolences. They go up to the bartender. The bartender is like, you want a beer? Yeah. He goes, what's with the full-blown AIDS? Full-blown AIDS. You heard that? I'm sorry about that. Walking through the crowd. Full-blown AIDS thing. He goes to the, where they have the people wait before they see you. Yeah. I walked through there and they're like, hey, great job on ONA, man. Full-blown AIDS. You rock. I'm like, thank you, I think. But after we left, after Jay Lynch and I left the studio, we just felt dirty. We shared a cab. We couldn't look at each other. I went home. I called my grandmother. How you doing? Why are you calling? Well, Steven's disavowed any knowledge of the song whatsoever. We'll not allow it to be aired with him singing under any circumstance. That's so wrong because the more you fight it, the more it sticks to you. Right. We're being called radio teasers. No, we will play She Smells Strange. We just had an intro, Mike Deena-Cole, and I just showed up. See, this stuff happened. We did it again. And we're not going to take another commercial break before we play She Smells Strange. Are you promising that? I have to promise that. Well, I mean, this is the guy that started. He also promised he was going to give me my $600. All right, I got the hint. He's been riding me real hard this week. See, he loses a few bucks in the market and now he wants his money back. Yeah, look at that. He's only got three teams left in the pool. I know. When he was kicking ass last week in the stock market, he forgot all about the money he owed. When he took some hits the last few days, next thing you know, he's looking for a couple of days. Been rough. Yeah, Nasdaq has been. All right, yeah, Nasdaq. A little tricky in the past couple of days. A little tricky to play. Little. But yeah, Mike DeNicola, who started this whole contest, he didn't know he was starting the most offensive song contest. Like a proud parent. So send all letters to Mike DeNicola. Yeah, these are pretty bad. So at first you didn't even want to take credit for the FBA, Sean. Absolutely. You were just like, oh my God, I hope people forget about this. It was, we went, like literally, I called my grandmother. We were trying to help an old lady cross the street, just trying to rack up some good karma. Yeah, that ain't going to happen. I know, I know. But then everybody I ran into was like, that was great. I'm like, yeah, it was great. Yeah, accept it. You know what it's like? It's like Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy. Remember for years he would resist it. He played Spock. He put out a book, I Am Not Spock. He wanted to pursue poetry and acting and other things. Then finally he said, you know something? F it, I'm Spock. I was Spock. I'm very proud of Mr. Spock and the work. Over the years, look how long this character has endured. And now he's at peace with it. Absolutely. Mike DeNicola has embraced the full-blown AIDS. He has embraced full-blown AIDS. Absolutely. Isn't that great? Hello, Fresco. Wonderful. We've got to get you a bang because I think you need to record your own version of that song. Someone's going to have to do it. You know who's got to do it? The We Deliver Kegger's Chick. Oh, Nicky. Maybe Nicky can perform full-blown AIDS in place of Steven Lynch. Steven Lynch will never play that song live. Never, ever, ever. But that's the worst, especially to say to ONA listeners, because every show he does in now on, they're just going to be chanting FBA. It's like saying, I'm daring you to chant. Yeah. That's why you have to take credit for the song immediately. I will. It's done. Well, should we play the FBA before we play the She Smells Strange song, Anthony? It's right here. Oh, my God. We're never getting to it. No, we are. I swear. It's not even, you know. OK. FBA first. This is the song that started the Most Offensive Song Contest. Even though Steven is singing this song, he has nothing to do with this. He was forced at the gunpoint, I mean. Yes, we were holding pistols to his head. Yeah. And the whole set up, it took us 20 minutes to convince him just to sing it for Mike DeNicola, because Mike's not a singer, Anthony. Right. With that said, here's Mike DeNicola. Sounds like Steven Lynch, but it's Mike DeNicola. Right. And his song, Full Blown Age, the song that started the Most Offensive Song Contest. All right. This is called, what is this called again? Authors of the song? Jay. Jay, what's this called? It's called Full Blown Age. I'm down to my target weight. Sarcoma has popped up all over my face. I lost three teeth and all my friends. Looks like I'm nearing the end. They're just telling a lie or even a fib. When you're lying in bed counting all your ribs. You try to give blood, but you show me the door. I went to stand up and I fell on the floor. It's full blown away. Damn that whore. Damn that whore. I said damn that whore. Damn that whore. All right. I can't believe you would play a song like that. That's probably the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life. Jay and Mike, just read what they wrote in front of me. Yeah, and everybody knows who wrote Living La Vida Loca. Now it's got to be said though because he really doesn't want to be associated with that. It's Mike Deena Cohen. It's Mike Deena Cohen. I'm serious because it's Adolf Hitler. That's who wrote it. Adolf Hitler. Lynch is a real good friend of the show and it'll really piss him off. I think Hittin's is fine. And then he won't come around anymore. We don't want that to happen. All right. With that in, let's get to finally the latest entry in the most offensive song contest. Look at the time. No, no, no. Mike, did you hear the one we played earlier? I did. Dunt of the Candyman. Oh my God. That was pretty bad. That was. Now is that worse than Baby Raper? I haven't heard Baby Raper ever. Oh, you want us to play Baby Raper for you? We'll play that in a little while. But okay, let's get into it. It's Daz. It sounds like an old school rap song. Does it? Oh, if someone could help me out with what it sounds like. Like an old school crap song. I like this one. He's got a wacky little style. Yeah, he does. And well, the song is called She Smells Strange, Anthony. The latest entry in the most offensive song contest. All right. Daz, everyone. Stream. Yeah. Oh yeah, I think there's a long intro here. Yeah. So violent. It sounds like Dr. Drett. All right, here it is. She Smells Strange. Yeah. I like the way she walked. I like the way she talked. And her booty was delicious. So we hopped in the bay, and she grabbed my head, and she shoved it down like vicious. As I went to work, my head started to jerk. On her carpet, I did munch. As I spread her legs, they smelled like rotten eggs. And I almost lost my munch because she smelled strange. And I liked it. She smelled strange. Down between her legs. Okay, terrific. When she spread those gums apart, she smelled strange. Like a box of rotten eggs. She's got the smell everybody knows. Like Fritos corn chips and sweaty toes. She don't do shh after her monthly flows. So I buried my nose where her fungus grows. And I liked it. Yes, I liked it. I liked it. They should smell down there. I liked it. Yes, I liked it. Hey, JP Morgan's going for the gums. I liked it. Oh my God. I'm just offended at the rap styling. I like it. Come on, A. Give it a chance. Oh, no, no, no, no. One more whiff of it. I... Spread wide, baby. Spread down. Okay. Okay. Okay, terrific. Yeah. Come on, I like that one. I don't like it. You don't like that one? No. Not as good as the KKK man that we played earlier? No, KKK man was... it fit all the criteria. It was very offensive. That one's offensive just as far as the guy trying to rap. God damn, was he black? Yes, he was. You never know it from his rapping. Hey, Frank, what's going on? What's happening, guys? How are you? Joe Pesci did a better job at rapping. The only thing I know about that song is that that guy should be air assaulted big time. I like She Smells Strange. You had something going on in the beginning of the song there, no? Something. Something, no? No. No? Mike? It was like a rap song from 82. It was old school rap. Melly Mel. Melly Mel, right? With the nine minute intro, a nine minute outro. Time for two lines. She Smells Strange. Okay, yeah, we get it. And now She Smells Strange on American Tab 40. Lydia. Hi. Hi, Lydia. It's not a rap, it's cameo. Cameo. It's cameo. Nice one. They sing it strange and I like it. Yeah, he just reworked the words a little bit. I knew I heard that song before. Yeah, but it's not a rap. He's not rapping. All right, he's like Biggie Smells. Don't give him credit for that, please. All right, Lydia. All right, peace. So you're not into the She Smells Strange? No, not at all. Well, what's the most offensive song to you thus far? Have you heard all of them? Well, I didn't really get to hear all of them, but I'll be honest, I've heard all of them. I've heard all of them. I've heard all of them. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is it the theme song for Stinky Karen? I'm offended just that I had to listen to it. What the hell is this? My God, it's the Blackberry Manilow. Come on, I like that one. What is this, PLJ? It's not really offensive. Kevin from Green Lawn. The music sounds like Beck's new CD. Stop it, stop it, stop it, written over and over again. All right. All right, I'll cross it off the list. That one didn't make it. I kind of like She Smells Strange myself, but all right. I don't know. You got a wacky taste in music. You know what? It almost had a cake feel to it. It was different. I love cake. One of my favorite bands. It was almost like cake. Hey, Pat, what's going on? Cake that fell on the floor. Oh, hey. That song was great. Are you busting on me, Pat? You like it? I'm dead serious. I only had a few beers in me. I'm dead serious. That song was great. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me. I only had a few beers in me.

The toughs are like the baby with the bad one one foot at a time. Ah, I'll just make an order. Happy St. Patrick's Day everybody! I'm going to be heading out soon Anthony? Yes. I'm going to do the last hour of the show at Lebar back, 57th Street between 8th and 9th. I hear there's a bunch of listeners showing up already. Yes! They only announced the location today. I'm going to stay there for a couple hours definitely. Should have some fun. Mike DeNicola coming down. The guy who wrote FDA to his credit. Steve from the Unofficial website is here. Psycho Mark going down. Is that going to be on like, you know the pictures of the comics in front of Caroline's? And it says, you know, HBO special, as seen on Letterman, you know, on Showtime. And it's going to be, are you going to have one that says author, FDA, full blown AIDS? I'm looking forward to seeing that. Can't wait for your next hit. Are you kidding me? I'm standing outside the club with a big button. Ask me about FDA, flags, porn. Oh man, let's go to John. John, you're next on W.I.D.W. What's up? John? Oh, P. I just wanted to let you know I agree. I think the song was great. Wow. It really sounds like it belongs to the next X-rated version of Naked Charlie. She smells strange. I thought it sucked. It had kind of a porno feel to it, you know? Yeah, definitely. It started out definitely porno. No one sucked about the song. It started out good and then it kind of just faded to nothing. I was really looking forward to the third verse and it just never happened, you know? The vocals definitely could have been better. All right. Thank you, John. Take it easy. All right. We're just about ready to play our last entry for today, Anthony. Bob, what's going on? What's up, R1A? How you doing? How are you doing? I'm doing all right. Except for the fact that I got a big red mark on my face from the KKK song from my brother here that works with me. He slapped me upside the head when he saw me laughing. Well, it's a song I don't know if you should be laughing at in front of everybody. I thought it was pretty funny myself. Yeah. Is it the most offensive song thus far? No. Full Blown AIDS is definitely more offensive than that, my friend. Now, is Full Blown AIDS in the running for the title, Anthony? No, I think that was just an exhibition song. Really? You know what I mean? It needs some kind of consolation point, anyway. All right. Well, thank you, Bob. All right, boys. Bye. Take care. Let's go to Eric. Eric, you're next on Andy W. Hey, guys. How are you? Oh, great. Good. Opie, I can't believe you liked that song. It was so lame. She smelled strange? Yeah. I just thought it was stupid. It took him long for him to get started. I know. It started off good, though, when he started singing, and then it didn't go anywhere. Right. But it's one of the better entries we've gotten lately. We're only playing the ones that we think are worth playing on the radio. Right. I mean, you can keep all the royalties because no one is going to take credit for the song. No one wants to take the money. And how the hell are we going to buy it? Sell it. Who the hell is going to put it in their record store? That's not a bad idea, though. Maybe we could burn some CDs and sell them on the Internet or something, Anthony. Out of Duffel bags out on $50,000. Yeah, we'll have double bags filled with the CDs before the show and we'll sell them. I like the idea, Eric. We'll look into it. Also, I heard all the songs except the Barry Manilow one. Well, the Barry Manilow one, I think everyone's in agreement just didn't make it. I mean, it was a good song early on in the competition. It got things rolling. Right. So don't worry about it. I don't think that one's going to win it. Also, Stephen Lynch, relax because compared to some of the stuff you've played lately, football is ages like a Christmas carol now. Yeah, I know. It's not that bad. The bar has been moved up. Now, Eric, you've heard all the songs. Which one do you think is the most offensive thus far? Well, I guess it would have to be the Baby Raper. Yeah, I'm still going with Baby Raper myself. Although, I was laughing my ass off at the last one. I was like, oh my God, and Sammy Davis Jr.'s dead. Oh, the Candyman song. The KKK man, yeah. And then they even added the AIDS thing in there. Yeah, I know. I was like, well, they covered two bases there. Oh, and he was Jewish, Sammy Davis Jr. So they really got three in there. Yeah. All right, man. All right, thanks a lot. Peace. Bye-bye. There goes Eric. Let's go to Joey Lodes. Joey! Hey, how are you? What's going on? How are you? Listen, you've got to get the Jerky Boys thing. The Moustacha tapes. You know about that? I've heard of them. I have to the first Jerky Boys. No, this was pre. This was before. This is the old one. It was on the same record label as the two barred red tapes. Yeah, I heard some of the stuff. I wasn't too impressed. Oh, excellent. Contest is really, really cool. All right, man. All right, man. Thank you. Peace out. A lot of people asking us to play the KKK man song. Again, yeah. By Joe and Bob. But why don't we get to the last entry for today? That's what I want to hear. We do have another five or six songs that we still have to listen to. And they're coming in every day. But there's six more songs that we could have possibly put on the radio. We just we have to pre-screen them and get all the voices out and all that stuff. Make it legal. Yeah. As far as the radio goes. Make sure they're up to snuff. And you still have a couple weeks to get your song in and then we'll get a winner soon. We're thinking, you know, the finalists have to perform the song live at a road show. But yeah, some of these entries, I don't know if the people have the balls to do it live in front of 1400 people. We'll have security up on stage. What did they win? We don't know what they win yet. Yeah. It's one of those contests without a prize. Maybe they win a whole race of people hating you. Maybe we could put up like Chicken Wire. Yeah. Like in the Blues Brothers and then they can perform the songs behind the Chicken Wire. I like that. It's a good idea. All right. Here's the last entry for today. It's by Fuel, AKA Jeff or Jeff, AKA Fuel. Right. He pens such ditties as, how much is that darkie in the window? Yeah. And Baby Raper. It's like a regular KTEL. Yeah. Well, his third entry in the most offensive song contest is a song called Camp. Camp Concentration. I wonder what this is about. Hmm. Hmm. Oh man. Camp Concentration. Yes. All right. Well, like I said before, the songs have to be offensive. It's the Offensive Song Contest. Come on. I haven't heard this one yet. I'm hearing it for the first time in the air. Rick heard it before the show. And you like it, Rick? You think it's in the running for the most offensive song? I think it deserves to be heard and let the listeners decide. You know? All right. All right. Here we go, Ant. You ready? All right. I'm ready. Here's Fuel. Camp Concentration. Welcome to Camp Concentration. We've been setting drugs for vets. The curers says we're never leaving. But there's lots of fun still to be had. Activities. Today we're working on the chains. It's hard but they're teaching me how. Has anybody seen my mother? Her shower should be finished by now. Home economics. Today they're teaching me cooking. And boy these ovens are big. Has anybody seen my father? I made this specially for him. Welcome to Camp Concentration. We've been standing because we're bad. The curers says we're never leaving. The curers says we're never leaving. But there's lots of fun still to be had. Is it? Today they taught me a new game. It's so much better than tech. We dug a big hole in the ground. And filled it with thousands of bags. I think I won. Science. Tomorrow should be exciting. Science is my favorite class. They're taking me to a special lab. Where I'm learning all about cats. Welcome to Camp Concentration. We've been standing because we're bad. The curers says we're never leaving. But there's lots of fun still to be had. Welcome to Camp Concentration. We've been standing because we're bad. The curers says we're never leaving. But there's lots of fun still to be had. Um... Uh... Contest is over. Okay. I can't handle this contest anymore. It's gotten to that point. I cannot handle this contest anymore. I cannot handle this contest anymore. Isn't it a shame? He might have won that contest. But his papers were not in order. Oh, come on. Oh my God. It sounded like a South Park song, didn't it? It really did. Camp Concentration. Camp Concentration. Okay. Okay. Look at the CD. There's no label. There's no name. It's just a blank CD and a blank CD. That sticks, man. How many of you this weekend? Welcome to Camp Concentration. Welcome to Camp Concentration. Just imagine the video. Hey. Welcome to Camp Concentration. Alright, listen. Listen. I can't... Listen, I can't... Call me a puss. I have found my line. I can't handle this contest anymore. I cannot handle it. This is the third one from Fuel. Just when you thought Fuel's entry was beat, he comes up with another one. You hear the sirens outside? They're going to get us. You hear that in the background? He's just a ball of hate. Let's go to the phones. Hey, Paul, what's up? Hello. Hey, dude. I'm sticking it on with you guys while I try to do my paperwork. I'm working from home today. You guys are killing me, man. I heard that the KKK... I'm a black guy. The KKK song was nothing but this. Oh, my God. Isn't that funny? That was like... Alright, wait. Let me ask you something, Paul. You're a black guy. Yeah. How long is more offensive, camp concentration or the KKK man? Oh, camp concentration, dude. I mean, the KKK man almost sounded like they were goofing on the KKK when they talked about the funny hoods and all that stuff. Yeah, it's true. That saved those guys' asses. It really wasn't all that offensive. But this one, man, you're going to have the JDL downstairs when you guys are going to the bar, man. Yeah. Yeah, we picked a great day to walk to the LeBron now. What are we, nuts? Oh, man, I got like tears of snot all over my paperwork from last week. Oh, Jesus. Alright, Paul. Alright, man. Thank you. Alright, bye. Let's go to Steve. Steve, you're next on Eddie W. Yeah, what's up, guys? How are you? Yeah, it sounds like a rip-off from Cartman singing, Kyle's a big fat bitch. Is it Mom? Yeah, definitely. That's why I said it sounded like South Parkish. Yeah. Well, I mean, it'll be up to you guys to decide. It sounded like South Parkish, but I don't think it sounded like that. Yeah. I like that, bitch. Yeah, it's got the little melody line to it. Biggest bitch in my home. We're goin' to speed now. Close enough. Thank you, Steve. Alright, out the vagina. Yeah, daddy G. Peeps in the kitchen. Alright, let's go to Tom. Hey, Tom, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? You guys are freakin' brutal. Well, it is the most offensive song. Hell yeah. My God, I cannot believe I'm listening to this stuff. It's crazy. Alright, now is that more offensive than the KKK song? Yeah, I believe. I believe. Do we need to play the KKK song? I don't think it's as offensive as the KKK song, and a lot of feedback that I'm reading now is saying that funny, catchy tune, but not as offensive. Hey, Ann. Well, these listeners, they're tough with involving you. Ann, take me out cowboy style. Come on! Come on. Later, guys. Thanks, Tom. Take me out crappy ratings style. Our first Jewish lady checking in, Leslie? Leslie? Yeah? Turn down your radio. You're live on the air. Okay, hey, I really did not find that offensive at all. I thought it was somewhat entertaining. I don't know why. I really was disgusted by the baby raper song the other day, and that one really kind of got to my gut way more than this one did. The problem with the baby raper song. Alright, so you're voting for baby raper at this point, huh? Definitely, Ann. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you. No problem. Bye-bye. Let's go to Darren. Darren, what's going on? Hey. Hey. Yeah, I'm Jewish, and I was in the car with my dad when the song came on. Uh-oh. Okay, he had like relatives who died in the Holocaust. Yes. Oh my God. Not something to joke about, obviously. I know. I looked at his face, and I swear to God, I thought he was going to kill me. He's like, how can you listen to this? Don't be an empty. I don't want you to say, oh my God, he was, oh man. It's not your fault. Well, yeah, it's just songs being sent in because they're offensive. That's why they're being played. I wanted to laugh, but oh my God, I would have gotten smacked. You can have a most offensive song contest and candy coat it, but... I know. I didn't get to hear the whole song because I had to turn it off. I was like, Dad, I'm going to turn this off now, okay? Yeah. That uncomfortable moment when you both listen to radio and you're like, uh, alright, I'll make the move. Listen, let's see what Z100 is doing. What the f? Could this be real? It says, you guys have completely crossed the line. I'm totally offended and it's signed Adolf Hitler. Alright, Darren, thank you. Alright, you guys are gone. Alright, bye. Let's go to John. John, what's up? Hey, how are you guys doing? Pretty good. I think you should give Fuel a gold record. Get all of his accumulation albums there and the guy is fantastic. Yeah, he's pretty good. But I would have to vote for Baby Raper. Well, which was by Fuel as well. He's got three entries in the contest already. Some people just trying to get one entry and he's got three already. He's fantastic. Alright, thank you, John. I'm waiting for Fuel to give us a call. He usually calls us after we play one of his entries, Anthony. I believe he's hiding in his attic like Anne Frank right now. I don't know, you get the feeling that Fuel has waited his whole life for an opportunity such as this. Yeah, you know? Finally, someplace to find songs. You don't even have to write them, you just pull them out of a shoebox. My babies will finally breathe. My children will see the light of day. James, you're next. What's up? Hi guys, I was the one who called in early in the week. Well, I'm Jewish and stuff and I've got to tell you, I'm probably the least observant Jew. All these guys say it's not offensive. Man, they can't be part of the Holocaust. They've got to be like Catholic or something. That was pretty offensive. I mean, I still say Baby Raper is still in the lead. I'm Jewish and stuff, but that was very, very bad. A couple of other things. Anthony, you need to get a cashier noise effect because you're going to be O&OB a lot of money after the NCAA is over. Yeah, you con just won by the way. Yeah, cha-ching, cha-ching. I've got four teams still in the running for the final four. Anne's down to three already. Yeah. All right, thank you. Yeah, vacation now guys. All right, let's go to Eric, another Jewish guy checking in. Eric, what's up? What's up, man? I am driving and I almost crashed right off the road when I just heard that dog. You're Jewish too? I'm Jewish. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm always up for a good joke. Yeah. When they started talking about my mom never coming back from the shower, very ouch. Yeah, that line was brutal. Yeah, I was good though. I didn't know they were wrong. I mean, it could have been a little better, but. All right. Well, thank you, Eric. All right, no problem. You think I can get on the air? Anything right there? You're on the air. Now we're hanging up on you. You'll hear the end of the conversation when you hang up. All right, another Eric on the line. Eric, what's up? Hey, how are you guys doing? Good, what's up? I absolutely love the song. It reminded me of the happy ending to a Roberto Benigni movie. It's like the crescendo of the crickets at the end of the very climax at the end of the film. That was added by Anthony, the crickets sound. Yeah, well, good work, Anthony. Bravo. I know Fuel doesn't mind if I add little sounds to his songs, like the baby crying during the baby raper song really seemed to have hit a nerve. You're helping out. I'm helping out. You're helping Fuel's cause. I'm like a producer. It's like 100 songs. Well, thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Eric. Well, thank you guys for enlightening me. All right. Well, and everyone requesting the KKK man. Oh my God, one more time? One more time. Well, we are running the world's most offensive song contest, so what the hell? And this one we played earlier and I begged and pleaded. I didn't want to play this today. We did get a bunch of our black listeners to give us the okay to play it. Yeah. And this is brutal. This is brutal. It's just brutal. KKK man. All right. Let's play this, Anthony. One more time, the KKK man. All right, everybody. Gather around. The Ku Klux Klan is here. What kind of niggas you want? Burn niggas, hang niggas, nappy head niggas, concrete niggas and cement shoes. Anything you want, you come to the right man. Because I'm the KKK man. Who can take a nigga? Hang up on a tree. Burn across his lawn and kill his family. The Kukaslan. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can cause a spew of the world with hate and wear a funny white coat. Wear a funny white coat. Who can kill Bill Cosby? Bill Cosby. Martin Erkel too. Martin Erkel too. Bring back the lead, our rascals make Louima smell like dough. The Kukaslan. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can cause a spew of the world with hate and wear a funny white coat. Wear a funny white coat. The KKK hates all these stupid apes. From shopping down to doctors they ask. Especially NBA players. Stack them up like Jews in L.A. Niggas, niggas, niggas. Niggas smell like shit. Niggas smell like shit. They take a million showers but they must be used to spit. The Kukaslan. The Kukaslan. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can cause a spew of the world with hate and wear a funny white coat. Wear a funny white coat. The KKK hates all these stupid apes. From shopping down to doctors they ask. Especially NBA players. Stack them up like Jews in L.A. Aids infested niggas. Niggas. Taken from a tree. From a tree. Sets within their aces dislike bestiality. The Kukaslan. The Kukaslan. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can. The Kukaslan can cause a spew of the world with hate and wear a funny white coat. The Kukaslan can cause a spew of the world with hate and wear a funny white Coe detectors. The KKK. The KKK. Okay Terrifect. terrific. Oh my god. Alright, well people want to hear that one again. Alright, let me tell you, now that I've heard both of those, Camp Concentration and the KKK song, back to back like that, yes, there's no contest. I'm going to have to hear Baby Raper again at some point before we leave, but the KKK song could possibly be the most offensive sound ever heard in the universe, ever. Oh my god. Anthony. Oh my god. What's up? What's the new station letter that we're going to be on? Why? You're going on vacation, right? Yeah. Don't come back. Alright. We're going to have a show. Ah, oh. It's the world's most offensive song contest. Oh yeah. We're going to be offensive. It's all gold. It's the whole contest. We're not going to have a job. Have a safe trip. Alright, we'll see you when we get back, Anthony. Happy St. Patty's Day. Alright, man. Bye, bro. You're going to get mad at a guy running a race that wins because he ran so fast? That's what it is. You're getting mad at these people writing offensive songs. It's an offensive song contest. Larry, what's going on? Anthony. Anthony. Yes? You suck. Why? What did I do? I haven't blown liquid out of my nose since I was ten years old. I didn't write those. You did that little South Park imitation after the other one and I was in the middle of swallowing and driving at the same time. It went everywhere. We're going to Camp Concentration. We're going to Camp Concentration. I'm looking at it, guys. You go soon. I'm going to Camp Concentration. You guys are great. And speaking of Camp Concentration, another celebrity calling the radio show. Who? Who? It's Fuel. Fuel. Alright, get Fuel on the line. The writer of Camp Concentration. There he is. Look at him. A standing ovation for Fuel. How goes it? You are like the new Lennon and McCartney. Like Anthony said earlier, you're the Elton John of most offensive songs. Is it too late to play the Hey I'm a Fairly Normal Guy card? No, yeah, much too late. It's over. Forget about that. Hey I'm a Fairly Normal Guy card. You've got to be kidding me. I'm impressed because we've gotten close to a hundred entries in this contest and we're not playing all of them on the air because most of them just flat out suck or you can't hear it or whatever. Fuel has gotten three of his songs on the radio so far. He's a protege. It's amazing. It's not like they were sitting around either, but I'm just for you. Well, I'd also like to volunteer if Stephen Lynch doesn't want to be associated with the FBA. I have no problem. Really? No problem. Well, we need Mike DeNicola singing it because it's his song. That's cool. Can you play the music for him or something? Absolutely. Is that you singing on Camp Concentration? Yes. You've got quite a range with your vocal styling. That's as high as I go. Very impressive. Now Fuel, the question I've got to ask, do you have any other songs in you? Yes, unfortunately I do. Are you holding back and waiting to see how this contest develops? No. I think the Baby Raper and Camp Concentration were definitely up there. Today is young. I don't know, man. The KKK is giving you a run for your money, man. It is a pretty damn offensive song. You've got to admit, it is offensive, isn't it? Absolutely. If the contest ended today, I'd have to go, like Ann said, we have to listen to Baby Raper again. You know why I'm going toward the KKK guy? Because in the sickest kind of way, Fuel's songs almost, you could tell he's kind of having fun with the concept. Even though they're really offensive. Baby Raper, my God, offensive song. You could still tell he's kind of having fun with it. That KKK one is nothing but hatred. There is nothing but hatred being pumped out of that song. That's why I think it might win as most offensive. It's almost annoying, though. I don't want to rip somebody else's head. The most offensive song artist having a little cat fight. I don't want to start a fight, but it's about two minutes in and you're like, yeah, KKK can't. The kid's in the background now. If anything I've learned is like, two minutes tops, got to get out. He knows parodies. Very good. That's the key to this contest. You've got to get to the point fast and quick. We don't like these long songs. Two minutes tops is good enough. You know it's gone too far when writers of the songs are looking down their noses at other songs. It's a little right. I know he did go very long. He's a little heck. Fuel, this is what we're going to do. Hold on the line. We've got to take a break. We will play Baby Raper next and then we'll go to the phones to see who truly is in the lead of the most offensive song contest. Hold on. We'll do that next. Fuel genius. We've got to get out of here in about 15 minutes to go to La Barbat 57th Street between 8th and 9th. We're doing the last hour of the show down there. Hope you can join us. I'm right here. Yes, I am. Hello. Anthony, Mountain Dew. We've got to thank Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA. They gave us a trip to the Final Four to give a little bit of a break. We had over 4,000 people sign up for the contest. Mountain Dew wants to thank every single one of you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. A lot of people drink in Mountain Dew and we have a little side bet going on with the NCAA tournament. One of my team is already out. The wonderful Iona College. They made it look good last night though. It's a little joke. Yeah, I was just doing a little joke. But Purdue advanced Anthony. Yes. University of Cincinnati advanced Anthony. Hofstra playing tonight. Sorry, I had something in my throat. I also did, yes, pick Hofstra. Yeah. Connecticut advanced today, one of my picks. St. John's advanced, one of my picks. But it didn't look too good yesterday. That would have been pretty funny. I wouldn't have been able to come in here if they lost that game last night. They almost blew it. It should have never been that close. Syracuse won yesterday and what, Duke playing later on today, I believe. So, I want to thank everyone that did register for the contest, okay? Yeah. Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA tournament. Oh, sorry. It's stuck in my hat. All right, and with that, it's not catchy. With that, because we got some really huge guys that are going to walk us down the Lebarbath in a few minutes. Holy cow. What's up, guys? Are you our personal security? How tall are you, man? I'm 6'8". You're 6'8"? 6'8", yeah. I feel, wow, I feel pretty safe. What's your name? James. Hey, James, is there anything we could do for you? No, this is enough. You sure? Yeah. Just walking us down the Lebarbath, you got to come back when we do the lesbian couch thing or something. We got to take care of you. Look at this guy. Man, you are big. And what's your name, man? I'm Tim. What's up? Not as big as James here, but it looks like you can do the job. Right, exactly. Just as efficient, yeah. Do you ever have to give people a heave-ho and stuff? It goes with the territory. A couple of times, yeah. Yeah, but we're pretty professional. We try to do the verbal psychology. Right. Something tells me they end really quick. You just wrap it up real quick. You got to see the size of these guys, man. Cool. Well, we're going to be at the Lebarbath in about 15 minutes, Anthony. Like the movie Roadhouse, Rick says. Yeah, that one. Have you guys heard our most offensive song contest? No. No, I haven't heard it. Good. The songs are horrible. They're way out there. We've got listeners that are very offensive. Offensive, that's a good word for it. Yeah. Camp concentration, indeed. Welcome to Camp Concentration. Well, these guys are going to walk us out in a few minutes, but we've got to play Baby Raper. Look at his face. Look at these guys' faces. Well, there is a contest. It is truly the most offensive song ever written contest. One of the songs that are vying for the lead position is called Baby Raper. Now, when you put something out as an offensive song contest, you're going to get back some pretty offensive songs. Yeah, exactly. So you guys still want to walk us down to Lebarbath? Yeah. I hope we don't win against any of those Baby Rapers. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's play it real fast, then we'll go to the phones to see who's the lead, okay? This one from Fuel. Once again, Fuel, yes. Baby Raper. All right. I'm just a marriage ordinary man, who somehow they just can't seem to get. While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet. Baby Raper, I'm a baby, and I'm a baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby. I'm a baby, baby, baby. Oh, baby, oh, baby, baby I'm a baby, and I'm a baby, very good, very good, very good. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh, look at how sweet this music is. Baby Raper. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Baby Raper, I'm a baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby, oh, baby. Oh, baby, baby, at the Disney Store. He he he he he he he he. When mommy turns away, I go for more. Sing them songs, tell them that they're sweet. As I slip the little booties off their feet. Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper. The little ones, the young, they're good enough to eat. Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper. The youngest, cherished, I always taste so sweet. Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper. The sweet and young, they're good enough to eat. Baby Raper, Alright, there you have it, Anthony. Baby Raper, Our personal security, they have left the building. I don't think they want to walk us down a Lebarbat anymore. Holy smoke. No, I got to tell these guys, look, we didn't write that. I mean, we put it out there, like I said, most offensive song contest. We've gotten some songs that are just complete. I'm totally offended by that one. Every time we played one, I think that's got to be the one that wins. Now I'm looking back thinking this has got to be the most offensive song I've ever heard. Now that I've heard them all today, yeah, I think that one's still in the lead, man. Oh my God. Baby Raper. Baby Raper, yeah. Look at these guys. Yes. And I don't... I'm pretty sick tonight. That could be the most offensive song ever. Alright. Oh my God. Alright, well we'll see you guys downstairs then. We've got to just wrap up all the festivities here. And then we're out. And then we're out. Like what? Five minutes, ten minutes? Five more minutes, and then we'll... We'll see you guys in the next hour of the show from La Barbe at 57th Street between 8th and 9th. We're going to stay a couple hours at least. See you later. Wow. And if you're in the area, please, please join us. Good God. I can breathe. Anyway... Oh my God. Did you see the size of that guy? Both of them. The biggest guy I've ever seen in my life. This guy is huge. We've got to invite him down to the appearance when Fuel plays a couple of his songs. Oh yeah. And when the other guy plays... What was his nickname? Jurassic Park? Wow. Man. Wow. Fuel. Yes. What's up? Nothing. Are they next to the elevator yet? Rick? They are now outside of your shot. Alright, good. Oh my God. I thought for a second they had heard the KKK song. Rick, did they thank you for giving me... Oh my dear sweet. When I saw them walking down the hall when they first arrived, I'm like, we are so dead. We are so freaking dead. Fuel, you're going to get us killed, you ass. I don't know about that. Wow. Fuel, the writer of the KKK, not the KKK. No, Baby Raper. Baby Raper, Camp Concentration and Camp Concentration. My mother, by the way, thought the Baby Raper song was absolutely hysterical and asked me for a tape. Oh really? Get out of here. Shocking. That's cute. The one who spawned you. I know. There is some of that in her too, you know. I had to test the mother's pride versus her moral code. Hold on, the guy that wrote the KKK song, checking in. Bob. Bob from Joe and Bob. Bob, what's up? Hey, how are you doing? There he is. Wow. You're getting a huge ovation. Fabulous. You're on the line with Fuel, aka Jeff. Alright, how are you doing, man? Good luck to you. Yeah, good luck to you. Nice song. Beautiful thing. But, yo, I take offense. Mean-spirited. You wanted bad. You got bad. Well, no, I didn't say it was a bad thing that it was so mean-spirited. I said that's why you're in the lead. Alright. In my book, that's why I think your song is more offensive because, I mean, it's complete hatred. That's what I mean. It's not hatred. You wanted the most offense. And that's the funniest thing in the world. You can't get hatred out of funny. Yeah, of course. If Chris Rock wrote that song, it would be top 40. Well, you got a point there, Bob. I think you got another verse. Bob, you're giving Fuel a run for his money. That is for sure. Hey, Bob, you should see our security guys. Well, I hope they're big if I have to come down there. Ah, they're big, but they'll kill you. They will kill you. I mean, the security you're going to get from me when I've got to play this song. Yeah, we'll get these two guys. We're going to get the chicken wire so you guys can play these songs live at the next roadshow. Alright, roll them out. Ride. Alright, guys, hold on. We might have to come back to you. Hold on. Okay. Here they go. Bob from Joe and Bob, the KKK man's songwriter and, of course, Camp Concentration, Fuel's latest effort and the writer of Baby Raper as well. Well, let's go to the... What, Robert? I got to tell you, just before we came back and you brought the security guys on, I walked over to pick up the phone to call somebody about the show. I see these guys standing there. I see these guys in suits. I'm looking at them going, who the hell let them down here because they don't look happy. No, I know. And I was just like, Paul. That's why I had to ask on the air, have you guys been hearing the songs we've been playing? And when they said no, I went... I thought Farrakhan sent them over. Huh? I thought Farrakhan sent them over. Yeah. I was asking a brick. Alright, let's go to the phone and see what everyone's saying now that they've heard all three back to back to back. Al, what's going on? Hi. Hi, Al. The worst one is Baby Raper. You're going to vote for Baby Raper? I think Camp Concentration reminds me of the movie The Producer with springtime for Hitler in Germany. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Well, the contest isn't over. I mean, we have another at least five or six songs in the back office we haven't even been able to listen to yet. But none of them... And there's 10 or 12 coming in a day at this point. None of them really offended me. I think they're too funny to be offensive. Alright, Al. Thank you. Thank you very much. Some people checking in saying Camp Concentration sounds just like Shut Your F'n Face Uncle Effer. Oh, that's what it sounds like. On the South Park one. Yeah. Uh uh uh. Uh uh uh. Welcome to Camp Concentration. Matt, what's going on? Hey guys, listen, I'll tell you, I have... You shouldn't be giving away duffel bags with CDs. You should be giving away duffel bags with paper towel and tissue.

Which one is the most offensive song to this point? Because of the context in my opinion fellas. You all know how I get down. You all are real cats to me. I have to say KKK because of the context of the way it's used. The baby joint, I got kids and I laughed at that. Come on, that didn't hit that nerve. Plus, we've got this racial tension going on in New York right now. Come on, that hit a nerve on everybody. I think white people are like, damn I don't want to be called nigger. You know what I mean? I asked permission before I played the song. I heard you had a whole lot of black Earl type black people calling up. Giving that permission. Believe me, I was rippling with my boss. I'm like, look money, I need to call in right now. He's you know, threatening some jobs type. I was like, alright, I'll let it ride. But I wouldn't have gave no type permission. It is offensive. I got to cut you off real fast because we got to get out of here. No doubt. Y'all cats have fun. Give me a hug. You hear my daughter? Yeah. Drink a bud for me. The show has been off to meet a fella. We're trying. That's why we need to take a break. We've got to recharge so we can keep it going. Alright, man. Peace. Good friend of the show, Manny. Let's go to Jerry. Jerry, real fast because we've got to head down to La Barbatch at the 7th Street between 8th and 9th. What's up? Yeah, you guys alienated me at work. At work in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Okay, in a wine shale with children. Yeah. Black people and children. Oh, you're listening to our show. I was listening to the show and you guys totally, completely alienated me. I think I'm going to be gone after today. Alright. Thank you. Peace. Yeah, man. Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, real fast. Hey, what's up guys? How's it going? Good. Everybody keeps forgetting about kilofedicine. I thought that was pretty offensive myself when I first heard it. Well, what we're going to do down the road, we're going to get the top five, we're going to put them on the radio and everyone will have a fair chance when it comes down to the end there. Well, how long is this contest going to last? Well, we're going to wait for a week. Dude, you don't understand how many songs are coming in at this point. They're finally piling in like you won't believe. And we're going to send the winning song to the Guinness Book of World Records, try to get it in the book. That's the most offensive song. Ever played on the radio. Yeah, that's pretty good. Alright, guys, take it in the rear. Alright, Vinnie. That guy. Take it in the rear guy. I love when it gets thrown. It's like a celebrity. Hey, it's the take it in the rear guy. Everyone's gotten a little notoriety on this show. Of course. Well, we've got to leave. We've got to go to the bar, Matt. Oh, really? I didn't know we were leaving. It's all packed. Well, let's say goodbye to Fuel. Hey, Fuel. Hey. I'm sure we'll talk to you after the vacation there, right? I'll spend the week, see what I can come up with for you. Oh, gee, fast. Can't wait. There's some more entries. Well, there's at least one that's written that we haven't recorded yet. My brother wrote some of it, so. Want to tease us with a title? No, no, no. I don't even want to know. I don't even want to know. I want to be pleasantly surprised. Alright, well, pick a new group and more people to send. Alright, man. Congratulations, Fuel. Thanks. And let's go to Bob real fast. Bob? Hey. Thanks for the entry today. Okay, no problem. You're the talk of the city today. I know you'll keep them coming, but I'm standing on my one shot there. Alright. Alright, take it easy. Alright, bye. Fuel making it up in quantity. Alright, let's head out. We'll see you guys at La Barbat for a few beers in the last hour of the show there. Right. Alright. You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now. The O.B. and Chancellor show. Thank you. 1027 W&E W. I just want justice for the rebellion. It's a big splooge thing. Turn that crap off. A butt plug. Turn that crap off. I'm not doing the chicken dance. A butt plug. I hate you. Butt plug. I hate you. Hey, my ball sack's bouncing around like a hippity hop. Scrutum. Who? Scrutum. Okay, they reconnected to toys all the time. Toys. Scrutum. What's your name? Scrutum. Hardware. Okay. What do you need in hardware? I got your pleasure menu. Could you hold on a minute? Yeah, Mommy. Me, you, your mama, a couple of friends, my ratwine, the power tool. Yeah. Sorry. She's a gusher. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn you all to hell. Damn, Damn, Damn. I have been vindicated. All right. It's Anthony. Where's Anthony? Anthony's taking pictures. We are outside the building on 57th street. Get that camera out of my face, Psycho Mike. Anthony, I've got a phone that's watching. We are walking down to La Barda. There are so many people out here on the sidewalk with us. Anthony, where is Anthony? Anthony is taking pictures. We are outside the building on 57th Street. Get that camera out of my face, Psycho Mark. Anthony, I got a phone that's watching. We are walking down to La Barbat. There are so many people out here on the sidewalk with us. The FDA guy is like walking in front of us with the FDA sign. People are walking by. They are absolutely horrified. Anne, is your phone working? It's ringing. Anne, say hi on this one while you get through. There you go. I think I'm on. We are going to be at La Barbat in about a block and a half. People are poking their heads out of their establishments going, what the hell is going on? As we make our pilgrimage down to La Barbat, that's wonderful. They are just scaring the crap out of people. I feel like I'm part of an AIDS walk. FDA! FDA! FDA! FDA! FDA! FDA! Yes, the FDA is a very important organization. What the hell is that? Get you guys out of your mind. FDA. Half the people are on the fire. I have no freaking idea what's going on, Anthony. Who are these wackos? I know. Let's make this light. Make this light. The security guys are huge. We are on 57th and Broadway, I do believe. We have another block and a half to go. This is the most exercise I have gotten in years. Hey, Rick, you want to take a break and then we will talk after commercials or what? Where are we? No, we don't have time for a break, actually. You guys actually have to keep talking. Just keep talking. He says we have to keep talking, don't we? Yes, stretch it out. I am walking. I am getting a little winded. These sidewalks are good for walking on. I never realized that. Usually I am driving on them. My problem is the so obnoxious that that siren. You see them? People are taking pictures of jumping. I don't even know if we are still on the radio. Who cares though? We are on vacation starting tomorrow, right, Anthony? Yes. All right, where are we? We are on 57th and 8th, I believe. We are half a block away from La Barbe. People are getting off the bus looking at us like who the hell are these guys? I just ran into a friend of mine. He just got off the bus. Are we crossing? Let's go this way. What's up, bro? Give your band a plug. Sacrin, number one. All right, there we go, Sacrin. Actually, a good band. I filmed them in the village about a month ago. Hey, where are you? Hang up. Oh. Oh, I had to disconnect, Ant. We are getting major feedback. Have them hang up and call back. All right, where are we right now? Am I still on the radio? Yes, you are on the air. You are fine. It is Anthony calling his feedback. All right, Ant, you can call back. All right, we are half a block from La Barbe, Anthony. The crowd is building and building and building. All right, Rick, do you want to take a break or do you want to make sure we get into the place first? Let's make sure you guys get into the place without any problem. All right, there is a bunch of people across the street waiting for us. It is like a two and a half block pilgrimage. Ant, are you there? Yeah. Ant, are you back up here? I think so. All right. I am not hearing that horrible noise anymore. People are just mortified at the OK terrific signs and the sirens. People have no idea what is going on in the SBA with the skeleton hanging off of it. It is an AIDS walk. It is an AIDS walk. SBA to our brothers. SBA to our brothers. We have the SBA guy leading the parade to La Barbe, Anthony. I hope no one mistakes this for us being gay activists wanting to get into the parade. Well, this is not a Patti's Day. People do not understand what is going on. There are a couple of people. OK terrific. OK terrific. Oh my God, Ant. I think we gave the location a little too early in the show today. Oh my God. Yeah, there are a couple of people out there. Look at the people beeping their horns. Give them an OK terrific. They love that. OK terrific. OK terrific. It seems like we have just a few listeners, Anthony. A couple. We are entering La Barbe, Ant. Ant, stay close so I can hear what you are saying on the radio. Very important because this is the performance of the radio at its best. Anthony, here we go. Mopey, what's up guys? Here we go, yes. All right, Ant, I am in the front door. Where is Ant? I am right behind you. Trying to get through. It is a little chilly outside, huh? Yeah, we are going to make our way to the stage here. There have got to be tens of hundreds of people. Good. Greeting the fans, Mopey. A lot of people outside. All right, we are making our way to the stage. See Mopey and Anthony show the day before vacation. It is time to drink some green beer with some of our listeners. All right. A little warm here. We are inside. Woo! Hey, Mopey. Woo! You have got your stuff recording up there. Here we go. Look at these people. Yes, thank you. Mopey, wonderful. Wonderful, yeah. Oh, look at all these people. Look at all these people. I think they are all here. I am looking at them. Anthony, what are you doing? Oh, yeah. There are so many people. There is a radio. Okay, terrific. I think it is not. Definitely. It feels also terrific. Okay, terrific. There are so many signs here, Anthony. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. All right. A little close. A little safe party. Stay close. Yeah, thank you. Going down. That was good. That was good. That was good. That was a party. Yeah, I think so. A lot of mic set up. How about one more? One more. Get in for the other two. There you go. All right. Yeah, one more. Get up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to punch you in the uterus. All right. I think we have ourselves a party. Yeah. Yeah. I look at it. Definitely seems to be a party atmosphere going on here. A lot of people are wearing some training. They kind of blow with the weather sock and stuff. Look at a bunch of guys in their bagpipes. I heard there's some hot girls doing that Riverdance crap though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They almost cursed though, I didn't realize they were having an am. No, no, no, no. No cursing. We have women here Anthony. Yeah. We have women. I'm noticing that. Why did you say hi to the women? Yeah, we're noticing that there are actually some women at this. This is a place we're not really used to this. What a mess. So we went from here to town. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice job intent Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By far higher I do it. Yeah. Oh yeah. Right, who's got the back? It is a beautiful man. Hey Anthony, ask the crowd. NIO are working as a team here. I'm on the radio through the phone and they're talking to the crowd through the megaphone. And ask the crowd if they've heard the latest entries in the Most Defensive Song Contest. Oh, does anybody keep me keeping tabs on the latest entries in the Most Defensive Song Contest? Yeah, pretty, pretty offensive, huh? From the sound of applause maybe or noise, what do you think the most defensive song, maybe the Ken Fetus abortion song? KKK song? It is pretty bad. What about KKK? Yeah, KKK. That's kind of good. Don't forget Baby Raper, Baby Raper. Wow, it is a... I don't know what this next singer is, does it? Hope they're freaking insane. This is scary Anthony. This is scary. I've already drank my complete pitcher. There's got to be close to a thousand people here Anthony. Ann can't even hear me. Rick, I'm on the radio by myself. Ann is like two feet away from me with the megaphone and we can't even hear each other. The crowd is just absolutely losing it. There's got to be close to a thousand people just staring, staring at us. Alright, Rick are you there? Yeah, I'm here dude. Why don't we take a break because it's absolutely insane here. Sounds like it. You can either, I don't even care because we're on vacation. You can play a couple songs, you can play an old bit, you can play some commercials, whatever you want to do. And we'll be back, I don't even know if we're still on the radio. It's Hope and Anthony Live. I hope this is really going up in the air. I'm going to get it. Alright, we'll be back in a few minutes. It's Hope and Anthony LaBarbat with WNAW. Now let's imagine that you're in the middle of your talk show and you must identify your station. You might say, 127, WNAW. Alrighty, if you guys aren't at LaBarbat right now, which is on 57th Street between 8th and 9th, then you don't know what's going on. Or if you're just hooning in, the guys are there live celebrating the start of their vacation, the, I guess, St. Patrick's Day. And they're about to get S-faced. Okay, so if you're within the vicinity of 57th Street between 8th and 9th Avenue, go down, hang out with Hope and Anthony. Bunch, bunch of stuff to give away. We got some T-shirts. The guys just brought a bunch of stuff with them. Hopefully you guys show up. Have a good time. Get the weekend kicked off St. Patrick's Day style. And they're going to be on vacation next week. So we're going to be doing the worst of all next week. And I figure I'm going to throw on a few bits between now and 7 o'clock that we won't play during the worst of. So make sure you're listening next week as we go through a totally cool week of worst of ONA stuff. But again, the guys are live at La Barbatte, 57th Street between 8th and 9th from now until like 8 o'clock. Go down, drink heavily, and have a good time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 57th Street between 8th and 9th, Anthony. This place is absolutely insane. All we've had so far is a bunch of cans, a bunch of girls getting up and wowing. This has been great. More women are showing up than I think have ever shown up at all of our appearances combined. They're here today. This is great. A lot of wowing. Come on! Hey, Anthony, as we're on the radio here, why don't you ladies get on the chair and live our lives and wow our radio audience? Okay, get on the chair. Come on! They're not wowing. They may not be, but they're not going to wow? No, they're not going to kiss. All right, they want to kiss. You guys want to see them kiss or what? Kiss! Oh, the crowd is very, very disappointed, Anthony. Very disappointed. Come on! Oh, the crowd is...the crowd speaks. Anthony, the crowd is starting to shed. We want gas. I don't know what that means. We want gas? Yeah, we want gas. I've never heard of that before. Is this an open wound? Yeah, it is. All right, ladies, why don't you make out for the crowd, at least? Make out for the crowd. Okay, horrific. Oh! Oh, God, they're tugging at each other. How disgusting. Come on! She's a chud? A chud! She's a chud? What does chud mean? Oh, I don't know. It's not like the spice kind of thing. All right, yeah. Did you guys like that or what, huh? No! Yeah, these guys are out for blood. They're not happy with the performance that we just saw here at the bar, man, Anthony. We want dice! We want dice. What? Dice? What's dice, Anthony? You know what's dice? Yes, they want a huge earthen wall to hold back water. My goodness. Hey, you guys having a good time here, huh? Yeah! It's kind of hard to do a radio show when they're just shoving beer down your throat like they're talking about. What? I can't hear you. I know. We've got to get off the radio in a few minutes anyway. We're going to make way for Don and Mike, and then we're going to be on vacation for a week. Where's Don? We are pretty much going to wait until Monday, I guess. We want beer! We want beer! Rumors that there's a couple of led beams at the corner bar over there. Oh, really? Yeah. I'm just, like you said earlier, I'm amazed at all the women that showed up at the bar back. We're very happy. We really appreciate that because usually when we're out and about, it's like a sausage factory. Yeah. These guys are losing. Show me Puddin'! Show me Puddin'! Show me Puddin'! Show me Captain Crump! Show me Captain Crump! Show me Puddin'! Yeah, I don't know. I think we need a few more ladies to come up. What's going on down there? What's going on over here? All the guys are pointing at two really hot, hot women that are making their way to their stage, Anthony. Two very hot women. They're not going to the stage here, are they? Yes. Get them on stage! Get them on stage! I think we might have some action. Get them on stage! Get them on stage! People can dance anything. I know. Get them on stage! We've got to introduce Mike D. Nicole to the crowd. They're going to freak out in a minute. Hey, you guys, that's the ladies making it to the stage. We want to introduce you guys to someone very special to the radio show. Have you guys heard the Full Blown Aids song by them? Yeah. Full Blown Aids. You guys, Mike D. Nicole. Mike D. Nicole to my right. The author of Full Blown Aids. He wrote Full Blown Aids with his friend Jay Moore. By the way, Mike whispered in my ear. In your ear? In my ear? You assholes gang. That old gag that Jay Moore just called and said hi to everyone. He's going to be back soon. Alright. It would be great if we could get Jay Moore on here, but we don't want that to be a mess thing. Here, the ladies making it to the stage because we only have a couple minutes left in our radio show. We are going to hang at La Barbe for at least another hour. Maybe longer. We'll see how it goes. What happened to the ladies? They gave up on us or what? They failed, Anthony. They failed on us. They're full of fraud. They all died. Alright. Hey, it happened. Alright. Well, there's not much going on that we can report as far as the radio goes. We have totally abandoned the radio show at this point. We have completely abandoned the show. Down here on the barbell. Done. Now they're chanting Paps Smear. I don't get what that's all about, Anthony. Paps Smear chant is. What's a Paps Smear chant all about? We'll have to get ourselves a gynecological chair. And it appears that we'll just do Paps Smear. Paps Smears? Wouldn't that be amazing? You might be onto something, Anthony. Get the colleges coming in. Yeah. Anyone wants to do live Paps Smear? I can still say it. I need another pep and beer. Alright. This obviously is just a mess on the radio. So why don't we sign off so we can do some true party with our listeners, okay? Put an end to your whole thing. You guys, thanks for listening to the radio show. We totally appreciate it. We're not going anywhere, but we gotta sign off. We'll be back a week from Monday. We totally appreciate the support in this goddamn sick day. And with that, we'll see you guys a week from Monday. Thanks for listening. Don and Mike are next on your radio. It's Opie and Anthony, LaVar Bat. We're signing off on the air, but we're still hearing you and party in here, LaVar Bat. 57, 58 tonight, between the air and come on by and have a beer with us, okay? See ya a week from Monday. Thanks, guys. Opie and Anthony. Jack, can we get these illiterates off of the air, please? We suck. If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 1027 WNEW.
