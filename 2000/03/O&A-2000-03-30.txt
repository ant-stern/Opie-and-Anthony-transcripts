 I'm used to the crazy people. Oh. Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. Are you mental? No! It's our show! I'm a mad man! I'm getting hit! Red drum. You sound like a stalk-raving mad person. No! She's hit! No! No! No! Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. No! Oh, she's an antin. How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? Say! 1027 WNEW. Bring on the heroine. Yeah. For once, we're both in good moods. Great. Great moods. Great moods for both of us. Yeah. Woo-ha! All right. The Open Anthony Show. Woo! Feeling good. Hang in there, pal. Oh, now I'm your pal? Why not? Now that you need a pal? Why? This motley crew rocks. All right, our phone line, 212-757-1027. Come on, y'all. Lots, lots, lots of things to do today. Goddamn. Why am I talking like I'm from the South? Well, Goddamn. You know what? Yes? Yes? This is going to be a fun show today, I guarantee it. Best show of the week right here. So if you missed the rest of the week, you didn't miss anything. Here's a little tip. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. You can't miss a thing. Here it is. Today is the show where people get hurt. Ernie, what's going on? What's going on, guys? How are you? Hi, Bill. This morning I was in the car with my wife going to Wilkerson. And she's got that new 103-point whatever station that is. I believe it's K2U. The one with the freak? Yeah, that new 60-year-old station. Well, the guy's coming on the show talking to that Rube guy, whatever his name is. The RuPaul guy. Yeah, I was talking to him and he said, OK, terrific. I'm like, wow. They're biting off you guys. Yeah, I heard on Nate. You know, that's funny you say that. I was in a car this morning and the driver had that on. Don't even start. Don't F and start. I swear I'll crawl and smack someone. The driver? Yeah. The driver had K2U on. And I'm not really listening. I'm just kind of looking out the window and I hear blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I heard they were using the OK terrific. Oh yeah. Other jocks doing our Britney Spears bit. OK terrific. Another jock. When I see him outside the Brooklyn diner, we'll get punched in the face. Yeah. Bring it on. Round one. We're having fun. Bring it on. Fun. Fun. I feel sorry for the first jock that I see around our building. Yeah. Bring it on. Round one. We're having fun. Bring it on. Fun. Fun. I feel sorry for the first jock that I see around our building. Yeah. He will get punched in the face. Punch him in the face. We have a bunch of enemies and we're not going to play little radio battles anymore. It's going to get personal. Enemies of the show. The one person who knows who they are and when I see them outside the Brooklyn diner, he eats there all the time, I'm going to shove them up against the wall, possibly through a glass plate window. Oh. It's nice. Bring it on. I'm from Redwood. I'll get some of the boys down there and you know, take care of the kneecaps for you. OK terrific. Simple as this. Simple as this. It sounds like Opie and Anthony are having a lot of fun every day, Monday through Friday, 2 to 7, but don't F with us. You do not want the wrath of us. For our listeners, you do not want it. OK terrific. Well thank you Ernie. Anytime guys. You guys suck. Be good. Alright man. Bye. He's near. God, and then I'm having an argument with Pete. What's the problem? Oh yeah, they want to take our mailbox. Take our mailboxes away. Something equally as ridiculous as that. Pete is spending the day rearranging the mailboxes here at AnyDub. Rearranging the mailbox. Rearranging the mailboxes. And for some reason, there's not enough mailboxes, so they want to double us up and triple us up like the Opie and Anthony show will get one mail slot. Yeah. I'm getting 10,000 magazines I never ordered on a daily basis. With the junk mail Anthony's getting, I don't want to share a mailbox with my bud. Is that a good thing? No. So we're like, no. Let's speak our piece here. And then Pete's like, well every other show has just one mailbox. Huh? What? What the who? Who the what the? Well when every other show has the ratings we have for any W, then they could have separate mailboxes for each member of the show. Exactly. Give us something around here. Give us just a little something. Now they're taking our mailboxes away from us. We don't ask for much around here. No. We will not be sharing mailboxes. Oh my God. Simple solution. Make a few more mailboxes if you're running out of room. Yeah. Well yeah. Not too hard. Oh my God. What a day. What a day. Not only is the stock not named Yippee, just dumping. I know. I saw that. I had some kind of announcement that said there was a problem. Like they're being looked into for some kind of consumer issues. So boom, ten points right off of that. There you go. So there goes my $600. So the $600 that I gave you. That you gave me to invest is now worth about $250. $250? Yeah, maybe three. I just swiped in half at the drop of a hat. Trader Jake, what's going on? What's up, O&A? Hey man, how are you? My screens look like a baboon's ass. A lot of red. Nothing but red. You're getting killed on the floor today? It's just been a disaster. I'm actually back in the office right now because it's just such a mess on the floor. Have you given up for today? I don't really have any choice. I have to stay here. Where are you hiding from your clients? That sounds a little bit more like it. Let the underlings take care of it right now. It's so funny when you stockbrokers are doing well for us. You guys want to be our best friends. You call us all the time, invite us to golf and lunch and dinner and drinks and stuff. When it goes bad, we can't get you on the phone. We don't hear from anyone. It's amazing how fast we become tied up. Sorry, I haven't heard from my stockbroker in two weeks. I'll figure out how well I'm doing lately. All tied up. I was concerned about yesterday's $600 transaction. I kind of followed it today. Well, it's really, really dismal. The only thing to do now is double down. Double down? You've got to. It's down like 11. Exactly. It's down 11 today. What are you going to do? Do what it takes. I need my $600 back. The whole week's been an 11. Why is it a day? This is retarded. This is retarded. I don't understand what's going on with some of these stocks. Think Abby Joseph Cohen the other day. Yeah, that big mouth jerk off. I'm taking some of the issues out of my portfolio. And what? Putting them in what? A mattress? Yeah, exactly. Please. That started the ball rolling. What are we on? A fourth day of NASDAQ being in the crap? NASDAQ's down over 11% from its high. This is ridiculous. Like they say, it's a buying opportunity. It's a correction. More importantly, what we're looking for here on the floor... It's a market correction. What we're looking for on the floor right now is for tomorrow... Is Valium. ...at 4 o'clock. Well, besides Valium, we need SPAS to do a really good report on the market. Oh, is that what it is? Yeah, and it's got to be after 4 o'clock so the rest of the guys can hear me. So would you like SPAS to talk about the stock market as part of his weekend review tomorrow? Yeah. Okay, we can do that. Yes. All right. Thank you. Well, Trader Jake, we're going to let you go, okay? Guys, good luck with everything. Hang tight. All right. Double down. All right, thank you. Take care. Bye. Thank you. All right, let's go to Stacey. Stacey, what's going on? Hey, how you doing? Real good. I love your show. You guys are awesome. Oh, thank you. And I really got to thank you for... I've had baby rapers stuck in my head. Yeah, who hasn't? This afternoon. What a catchy little day. What a catchy little day. Totally catchy. And Newborn Baby Soup, forget it, between the two of them, I'm like... Newborn Baby Soup wasn't that good. I thought it was pretty catchy. Yeah. But I also wanted to ask you... Yeah. Does it have to be an original song? Yes. It does, okay. It has to be an original song, but you could do it to the tune of a song that exists. Okay. By the way, we've got to put a time limit on getting these entries in. We can't do this forever. I think we only have about two more weeks left before we crown a winner in the most offensive song contest. Oh, yes. Right around tax day, we're going to stop taking entries. Cool. All right? You guys are awesome. Thank you, Stacey. Keep rocking. I'll be listening every day. All right, cool. Take care. All right, bye. Let's go to Vinnie on line 10. Vinnie! Hey, fellas. How are you, Vinnie? Hey, I heard about that somebody's going to be rearranging your mailboxes. I hope it's not all because it may take you a two-week job if you put him on it. I think you're right. But, fellas, I just want to ask you if you heard about that thing with Sharpton that he's suing the GOP? I haven't heard that one yet. You haven't heard that one? No. Yeah, he's suing the GOP for being liable for the stuff that I guess they said about Crown Heights and when that stuff went down in Harlem with Freddie, you know, when Sharpton was saying stuff about the White Interlopers. You haven't heard about that yet? No. Yeah, it's big news. I don't... I could care less about Sharpton in most cases. All right, so what do you want to say about it, Vinnie? Well, basically what I want to say is I think you know what I want to say. I think we should send that KKK song to Sharpton headquarters. I'll hand deliver it to them. Yeah. Yeah. That'll happen. Come on! Video tape me doing it. I'll do it. Get a copy off the radio and send it in to them, all right? I'm going to carry it to them. All right, Vinnie. I love you guys. Thank you, Vinnie. Bye. He loves us. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them.

I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I'm going to send it to them. I don't know what Anthony wants to talk about today, but all I can say is that Aunt needs some cheering up today. Our pal Aunt needs some cheering up today. I am sure to put a smile on that face of his. I took a beating and it's not even the market. Can I describe myself to you? Okay, go ahead. Okay, I'm 5'5", dirty blonde hair, nice shoulder length, green eyes. Some people say I'm pretty exotic looking because I'm dark skinned. Are you colored? No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm Turkish. Turkish taffy, huh? Well, anyway, I've got a 38C. You have 5. That's a big back, baby. I have a tight little butt because I work out. I can't stretch any further. Let me tell you, I'm into Tae Bo and I am so flexible. Tae Bo? Tae Bo. Tae Bo. Billy Banks, you know? Where are you right now? Where am I? I'm in New Jersey. It's going to take you forever to get here. Excuse me? Well, I thought we could have a little fun on the air. That never works. They have to have the mood. You know what? I've had my fill of women today. I would love to suck your toes. Women lawyers, women everything. I would love to suck your toes. Oh, really? Yeah. Thank you. I'd suck each one really, really slow. How about that? Hey, can I hit you on the back of the head with a shovel? Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Okay, enough of beating. Let's go to Scott. Scott, what's going on today? What's up? What's up, Scott? Hey, listen, I was in the stand this morning. He's playing Thank Heaven for Little Girls. He was singing himself. Maybe he's listening when he goes home, huh? See, we can't even comment. We can't even talk about that. We're not even allowed to comment. We don't even know that person he's talking about. That's a shame. We've been told they would dump out of our show if we... If we mention someone's name. Yeah, so we can't even mention his name. No. Whoever that was that person was talking about. Veronica! Hello. How are you, Veronica? All right, how are you guys? Great. Fantastic. Just wonderful. Are you on something today? You seem a little loopy. A little loopy? Yeah. Yeah, loopy is the word for it. All right. Well, I have a question for you guys. Picture a big, giant vacuum cleaner, right? Going through your pockets. That's why I'm a little loopy today. Are you being sucked dry? Pretty good. Okay. Well, can I ask you guys a question, and like your audience a question? Yeah, go ahead, Veronica. All right. Now, I shave already down there, I was saying. I already have... What, your knuckles? No. The little Hitler's mustache is like what I have right now. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, of course. Okay, so my boyfriend mentioned going completely bare. Just once for him. And I'd like to do it for him, but there's, you know, like nooks and crannies and things that I don't know how to get a razor into. But I'm weary of using chemicals around there. Right. Use an electric. Use an electric. Use a really good electric, yeah. Or tweezers. Oh my God. That's a bite of a... Rip it all out at one time, right? Nibble on it. Get it waxed. Get it waxed. You're like going to sit in a chair and have somebody wax you. She's talking about like the real intimate areas. I'm talking about the innards of the innards. Right, like a couple of the stragglers that are really in some of the folds. Yeah, get tweezers. No. Get an electric. You ever try an electric? Yeah, but that's bulky. Like a razor is thin, you can get into certain spots. Well, I guess Ronan brings up a good question. How do the ladies deal with that, Anthony? Exactly, because I have a lot of guy friends. Now, is the hair on the head of the little canoe driver? Yeah. Wait, on the head of the canoe driver? No, there's nothing in there. No, not in there. All right, so where is it? Well, it's... Like in the nether region between the two... Ah, the taint area. Oh, the taint. Yes, the taint. I didn't know if I could say that. Oh, you could say taint. Okay. Because the taint is a bad word. And how do you know there's hair there? How do I know? There, you're like... It's my body. You're standing on your head looking at a mirror? No, your hair and a wreath there, but it's like a region that's sensitive. You don't want to put something sharp there. I'm weary of like... All right, ladies out there, we're trying to find out how you shave the taint. Right? Yes. Okay. Yes. Somebody will call with that answer. Yeah. It's like, you know, guys know that girls just have it done. Right. But they don't know how it gets done. Right. All right. I think that you can do it with an electric razor. I don't think it's that sensitive. Yeah, not one of those electric razors that are kind of flat. You've got to get the one with the trimmer, you know? It's got like the sideburn trimmer or something. Yeah, I have one of them, but that doesn't get you there. Well, look at you pretty close there. I'm going to put you on the line with Mary. Okay. Mary, advice for Veronica? Mary? Mary. Oh, my God. Hold on, let's go to Sue. Sue, you have some advice for Veronica? The magic is in waxing. Wax? For waxing. Yeah. Really? Yeah, you're going to go into the city and get some Brazil waxing done because they get everything gone. Yeah, but you walk like John Wayne when you're done for a while, right? You hold on tight, you break a couple nails, but you're all right. Wait, so you have another lady wax you in that area? Another lady. Wax the hang utopia. What are you doing? You show up there and you're spread eagle and she's... There's more than one person. Okay. You go there, you make your appointment with one of these Brazilian women, right? You lay there. And Brazilians know all about hair and... Yeah. Unsightly places. So you go to the experts and they do a really wicked job. You got to consider it an OBGYN appointment. Yeah. How long does it take? And you have no problem with like your balloon knot and your whale's eye all exposed while they're like waxing your taints? Waxing it. Not at all. You're a beautiful thing. You ladies are weird. I don't know. I don't know if I can have another... Imagine a guy going to another guy to get his taints waxed. Come on in there, bub. Get in there. They don't even think about it. They treat you rough so it's okay. They don't even think about it. You ladies are weird. You have no problem being naked in front of each other but guys, that would never happen. I think about something else. Alright. For a good cause. So Veronica, you hear that? I don't hear it but... Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let's see if someone else could give her some better advice here. Let's go to Dana. Whoa. Yeah. Veronica, you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay, Dana. Alright, you have advice for Veronica? Yeah, wait. First of all, where does she live? Jersey. Jersey, because I had a good woman that she could go to. Yeah, just get waxed. Don't shave it because you're going to cut yourself and that would suck. Wait, Dana, you do the same thing? You go to one of these places? Yeah, I go to a woman who's like, you know, she wears like nurse whites and the whole... Yeah, but you're completely spread eagle and this lady has no problem waxing your taint? You kind of hold your leg up, like behind your ear kind of thing. Oh, what? Yeah, where you have the straps. Straps? Straps? What? No, okay, you're like on a medical table kind of thing. Yeah. You're laying down. Yeah, on your back? On your back. Okay. And then you take your leg and you hold it and she does it and it's over. That's a good position to lay straight up. It's really, it's not that bad. And you're not embarrassed to be exposed like that for another lady? No. Why? Because I make sure I'm, you know, I'm clean and everything. Well, squeaky clean? Yeah. It's not a big deal. She does it all the time. Squeaky clean. All right, Dana, thank you. No problem. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. That is weird. Bye. I guess the women are a little more loose than those guys. Hey, Sherry, what's going on? They don't care. I have an answer. You have an answer? Let's hear it. She can shave. You just take alcohol, pour it over the razor so it's all clean and shave it. It's better than waxing because you don't have to wait for it to grow back and shave it. You can shave it whenever you feel like it's getting prickly or it's bothering you. Just take alcohol, pour it over the razor and you're good to go. So Sherry, you, you, you shave your own taint? Yeah. Virgin. Virgin. All right. That's the best way to go. Well, thank you for that. Virgin. Yeah, Scott, so. Let's see. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's the pain in the neck. The phones today. Let's go to Melissa. Hi, Melissa. What's up? Hello. Hi. All right. I have the answer here. Okay. I, this is so bad. I can't believe I'm saying this. I take my father's ear hair clippers. He has like this electric ear hair clipper thing. Yeah. And you get down there. Oh, you're small. Because it's like electric and you can use it and it doesn't hurt. You don't cut yourself. It's really good. And it gets like where you can't see. Honey, where's my ear hair clipper? Oh, here it is. Here it is. Honey, have you been cleaning the trout with this? What's going on? Oh, my God. What are you doing with my ear hair clipper? Did you just gut a fish? Isn't that like, don't you find that a little disturbing that the same thing your father puts in his ear? It's disturbing either way you look at it. The father putting it back in his ear or the girl putting it down there near the tank. Yeah. I clean it, though. Then your dad's like, in his ear and it was right near your most intimate of areas. You know, those things are pretty small, though. They're very small. They're like a finger tip small. So you can get them there for like the things that you need. Yeah, but it was right near your rear. Yeah. Yeah, wow. Hey, dad, you put it in your rear and I put it near my rear. I really hope he's not listening to this because then I'll be dead. Now, Melissa, you go in the bathroom. What's the move, man? You go in the bathroom. You got to be like a contortionist. Like, I'm very flexible, so. Yeah, see, that's the thing. It's like the angles that you're going at, you have to be bent a certain way to have certain areas exposed. Exactly. You put your arm there. Yeah, like I did in the bathtub once. I almost killed myself. Like, I almost cracked my head open. And you ladies are all doing this for us, right? Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Love it? Well, you know what? One of my guy friends suggested that I have him shave me. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. So then you're back to putting a razor down there. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that? Doesn't work. All right. Well, thank you. I want to make, like, heart shapes and stuff. Thank you. Thank you, Melissa. You're welcome. All right. Bye. Making the heart shape. That is true. When us guys get shaving, like, hey, let's make it into a heart. Wee, wee, wee. Like a lightning bolt or something. All right. This is too good. We got to keep going. This is the first time the ladies have called our show all week. I know. I know. It's so exciting that it's always guys calling. You know, it's just a female topic. Well, we'll do a little female topic here. Now you get to find out how many women are listening to your show and you can, you know, mess up that demographic. All right. Let's see if Karen has anything to add to the taint discussions. The shaving of the taint. Karen? Oh, the taint. Hi. Hi, guys. How are you? I'm very good. How are you? Great. Okay. Now, whoever told you about pouring alcohol and shaving, you're insane. Razors and alcohol don't go into your taint. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. It's called sugaring. Oh, yeah. It's almost like waxing except you don't need that extra strip and it doesn't hurt as much. And it leaves it all tasty. It's completely clean. There's no itchy when you grow back. There's no... I meant something. It's like a sucrose. What is it? Some kind of a sugary substance. It kind of looks like... Proof post. It's almost the same kind of liquid that they would use in shaving, I mean in waxing, except it's all natural substance and they just... It looks like sugar. Like molasses and... Yes, just like molasses. They just put it on, they rub it a little bit and rip it right off. Lift your leg up like this and... Yeah, you're kind of a contortionist. And then rip it off? And they just pull it right off. You still go get that done somewhere? Yeah, I go in Montclair. They're all over the place. Any place that does your hair and nails, you just go and you get it done. I would love to see a girl shave her taint on our show. Yeah? Or wax it or something. Or wax it or something. I wonder if we have a lady that's braver than I am. I'm not braver than I am. I'm not braver than I am. I'm not braver than I am. I don't know if you really want to see that. Yeah, it's... when you're looking at it that way, I can't see how it's real pretty. Maybe when Jay Moore is in, he would like to do it. Oh, Jay, yeah, thanks. Yeah, don't do it for us. What are we, a bunch of swabs? Yeah, you don't want to do it for Jay. All right. Thank you, Karen. Or Opie and Anthony. Thank you, Karen. You're welcome. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Thank you, Karen. You're welcome. We got to go to Margaret. Yeah. A name like Margaret, this could be fun. Let's go to Line 3. Margaret! Guys, I am a lot of fun. Okay? Let me tell you. You just got one of those weird old lady names. Old lady names. ...the name there for my grandmother. Hey. My name's Margaret. Why would parents do that? Your grandmother's probably a lovely woman and she was named Margaret, back when Margaret was like a hottie name for a woman, like Mildred. I went out with a Margaret. Margaret. It was all weird, man. I am a hotty person. What do you call her? Hey Marge! Yeah Marge! Good Marge! Marge! Alright guys. Large Marge! Not for the bad guys, it is. Marge, I'm gonna F you! So what do your friends call you so they don't have to call you Margaret? Marge. Marge? Margie. And then they say, then they say Large Marge. No, I'm not Marge, I'm a little petite woman. Yeah, but I mean the name though, wouldn't, wouldn't, aren't you pissed you didn't get a name from this century? Yeah, Marge is a name for like a truck driver lady. I am, but I am unique. I met Marge at the USO show. We're back from Europe. I'm not, I'm not a European. I met Marge at the Speakeasy. Hubba hubba and 23 skidoo, that Marge sure knows how to shake a leg. Let's break out the patrol up. You guys are embarrassing me. Yeah, it's just your name. Parents are cruel sometimes. Yeah, the grandmother is cruel. And Marge, that's coming from a guy named Opie, so, you know. Alright, you guys are... Taking with a grain of salt, obviously. Alright, so you have some advice for Veronica. Yes, Veronica. Yeah? You can use a razor, disposable razor. Don't use an electric razor because you do nothing but pull on yourself when you do that. Right. The guy's like clean shaving, no grease on the infield. Go for it. Don't use any hot wax down there. You'll burn yourself. Let's go at it with a razor. A razor. A daisy razor with the aloe strip on the top of it gets you nice and close. Yeah. There you go. More advice. Yeah, for Margaret. We've got razor and sugaring. Use, not sugaring, not sugaring. Take a disposable razor with the aloe strip on it. Alright. And make that little patch. Margaret, you know, in the old days we used to just use one of those straight razors like they use in the old westerns. Yeah, they used to... Lather it up. The old days. Take it on the strap. Sharpen it up and then just go down there with just soap. Just soap. That's how Margaret used to do it. They only shaved it every ten years with a machete. Really? You guys are too much. A Gherka knife or something. Lift it up. Whoosh. One of those. That's great. Lop it off. Alright, Margaret, thank you. Have a good day. Alright. Bye. This taint discussion is way too much fun. I think we need to continue with this, right? Oh, yeah. Alright, let's take a quick break. We love the taint. Veronica? Yes. Alright, hold on.

And she had to put a hole in the middle of the mattress. She cut a big hole in the middle of the mattress so when she lies in her stomach her boobs hang through. Just pick your little mice underneath. I was thinking maybe you could cut a big hole in your mattress. Big hole in the mattress? No, no. I don't have anything to put in the mattress anymore.

And you're listening to Hopi and the Guy Who Wants to Be Me Show on WNEW 102.7. And you're listening to D. Green Day. Green Day coming to town, right? They're playing the Warped Tour, I believe. Yeah, July 15th at Randall's Island. We've got to get Green Day in here. Alright, it's the Hopi and Anthony Show on phone number 212-757-1027. Let's go back to the phones. The ladies want to discuss stuff today. Let's go to Juliana. What's up, Juliana? Hey, how are you guys? Pretty good. What's up? I have some advice for Veronica. Yeah. Okay. Well, what I do is I usually soak in a bath with bath salts and stuff. My skin gets really moist. And then they have a shaving gel for girls and stuff. So I use that. And then I put lotion on that smells like pears or raspberries or something. My friend Brandon really likes that. And how do you get rid of it though? I use a disposable razor right after the shaving gel. And that works really well if you get your skin really moist. That really works really well. Get your skin real moist. Very good. Okay. Wow. That's pretty nice. And you do the shaving in the bathtub with your legs up in the air or what? Yeah, basically. And it looks all nice down there. Besides just the hair, it doesn't look like an explosion out of kosher deli. I have a friend named Brandon and he thinks I really like it. Alright, Juliana, thanks for calling and acting all sexy and stuff. Bye. That's good. Let's go to Valerie. Hi Valerie. Hi. How are you? Fine. Good. What's up? You use those buzzers that you guys use to do your sideburns. Like when you go to a barbershop. When you use a razor, you get itches when it goes back. And when you use this, it's clean cut. No problems. No itches. Yeah, you got to shave one of those little sideburn razors or something. Yeah, and it's perfect. It's smooth. You can shave it if you want. No itches when it goes back. Nothing. You got to go there? What? That doesn't really get it there though. Yeah, you can get really close to those. No, you can get completely. It's not even close. You can get completely there. Maybe I need to do one. It's funny to watch you ladies in the shower shaving yourself. It's very entertaining. You watch? Yeah, man. You remember? Oh yeah, yeah. The window's behind us. The window's behind us. We watch the girls shower all the time. We haven't done it lately because the show's been busy. But yeah, right around 5.30, all these showers behind me, outside the window here, are filled with women that are shaving themselves and taking showers. Well, if you guys did one of these then you'd be all set. It's funny, the one girl lifts her leg all the way up in the air like she's a ballerina, and then she takes the razor to town. Yeah, but you see when you use the buzzer, you don't even got to do that. You can just stand up in the shower. You don't need shaving cream, soap, nothing. That's great. I saw her slip once when she had a leg up there near the window, and she stuck to the window like one of those Garfield cats. It was pretty cold, pretty fun to watch. All right, well thank you Valerie. Okay. Bye. That's sick. It's funny though. What a mess. Let's go to Michelle. Michelle, you're next on WNW. How are you? Hi, this is what I do. If you're really close to your boyfriend, Veronica, I have him get the shaver and shave me after I get out of the shower. Oh yeah? Yeah, we'll sit there after we get the shower so the hair is nice and moist. Well, he'll just get the electric shaver and shave me, and it gets really close. And he shaves your taint and everything? Everything. Everything? Everything. What floor? Everything. Just everything. I remember when Mary used to shave. Okay, Michelle, thank you. Thank you. Bye. Shave it bolder than Murray's head. Right, Mayor? Look, Lou's got wood. Hey, Lou. Jolene. Hey. Hey, how are you, Jolene? Great. Good. I have been doing this for a long time. When I first started, I used to use a buzzer. You can get your skin caught in between the little teeth and really cut yourself bad. It's not comfortable. Oh, cut yourself. Yes. The best thing I have found to do is that Summer's Eve makes a feminine wash. Oh, yeah? Yeah. How about that? So you want to be a little dinky with that. Nice. When you're in the shower, you turn the head away, you soak up, get really lathered up. Summer's Eve. I use the Sensor Excel for women. Yeah, that's brand new. It has to be super sharp so you don't get a dull neck. Right. You just do a little squat in the shower. You feel yourself where the hair is and you shave gently. It gets all the hair. I've never cut myself. It's the best way. A vag is like a Lamborghini. It's always got to be in the shop for something. It's like very high maintenance. Very high maintenance. Guys jump is like a Dodge Dart. It just keeps going. It's running. It's dirty. It can beat the hell out of it. It'll still get the job done. It doesn't matter. You're dancing. I hope you girls have a special badge doctor and everything. You're so lucky you're not us. A different color side panel. It doesn't matter. Yeah, we don't care. A different color side panel. I'm mad about it. The vinyl roof is ripped. Who cares? It's still driving. It does the job. It gets you from point A to point B. It may not look good, but it gets the job done. It works. That's all you got to worry about. All right, Julian. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Thank you very much. Primax, pre-mix, pre-measured, disposable, those who's going to keep them? Of course they're disposable. Paris. Hi. Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I just started listening to you guys about two months ago and I'm hooked. Oh, cool. Really? What were you listening to before us? Can I tell you I never listened to talk radio before in my life. No? This isn't really talk radio, though. I just, well, you know, it's thick radio. Yeah. What's your ethnic background? I'm black. I see. I can pick it out. Really? Are you serious? My boyfriend always says I talk like a white girl. He's like, yeah, they won't be able to guess. You do, but no. No, right there I heard another word. You can tell. Really? Are you cafe latte? Really. What you would call butter pecan, yes. Butter pecan. That's my favorite. Wait till you hear what I have to tell you guys. All right. This whole shaving thing happened. Okay, one night I'm in the music business and I'm hanging out with my attorney. I've known him for like five years. He's Jerry Curl down there? Ew. No. It's him. Check this out. He's like, okay, next door there's a place where you can go and get massages, pedicures, manicures and they stay open really late. It's really cold. Do you want to go hang out there? And at first I felt weird doing something like that with my attorney because it just was weird. But anyway, to be honest with you, I get over there and first the lady offers me to sit in the, what do you call it, the steam bath. So we're sitting in there hanging out, cracking jokes, laughing. Okay, so we go to get the massages. I don't want to get naked because this is my attorney. Right. So I have my undergarments on. I'm laying there getting massaged and I just have my eyes closed. I looked over to the left of me and this guy is like ass naked. Okay? Really? Okay, so he's naked, right? But this is the clincher. I'm like okay, I can deal with this. My friend is always saying you're such a prude. I'm like okay, I'll sit here and I'll just take it. I'll never come back but I'll just sit here and act cool. So I'm closing my eyes. I kind of drifted off. I wake up, no lie. I look over. These two Asian women are above him on the table giving him... Yankee cranky. It's the Yankee cranky place. I didn't know that. He didn't even tell me and I was mortified. I didn't even know what to do because I'm like in the same room with this guy. What? Yeah. How stupid was I? That's the Yankee cranky. He was getting the Yankee cranky and you were sitting there watching, huh? But I'm his client. I didn't watch. You're right. Well, first of all, I laid there and I kind of like... I was like oh my God, what do I do now? I would not turn down an Elise if that was his ultimate goal. It made me want to throw up right on his shoes. Oh really? Yeah, I freaking ran out. I grabbed my towel and ran out. What a coincidence. He was like... He was like are you okay? He had a big belly and he had some nappy hairs going on in the pubes. I was not feeling that. Nappy. Nappy. Nappy trappy. If a white guy uses the word nappy, we get in trouble. Let me tell you. They were making some egg drop soup. It was nasty. You guys left the place and what did you talk about? I left and he was like how are you all right? I was like what the hell? That's nice taking you there. I tell you, I had no idea what to say. To this day we have never really discussed it. It caught me off guard. I didn't want to seem like I was a person out of the family. On the proof? Yeah, there you go. But it was really gross. Maybe if he was hotter it wouldn't have been. It would have been gross. All right, Paris. Okay. We would love to check you out. We love checking out our black listeners. Well, maybe one day I can pop by. I'm not bad looking at all. Soul sister. Yeah. Soul sisters. Well, we can arrange that one day. Yeah? Yeah. I'm not a triple winged bat. No, it doesn't look anything like that. No. You don't misconception about us black people. I don't think you're like that. Oh my God. Virgin. No, Scott. Scott, she's not a virgin. You're not a virgin, right Paris? No. Okay, terrific. No. Okay. It's been a while since then. Yeah? Yeah. All right, have you had the balloon not violated? No. No. Hell no. No. Very good. No, I don't get that. No, huh? No way. Virgin. I was listening that day when the girl called me. Virgin. Oh my God. I was listening the day the girl called up about advice for having sex and everyone's calling up telling her to get the anal ease and stuff on her knees. What kind of crap is that? Hey. Hey. Virgin. Yeah. Okay, terrific. Yeah, terrific. No. Well, thank you, Paris. Yeah. Call back any time, all right? I will do that. All right. Thank you. Paris. Well, Veronica, we wasted 40 minutes getting you advice there, so I hope that helps you out. Well, I got like... Another lady said use a mirror so you don't break your neck. Then I got to put two hands down there and where's my balance? Yeah, sure. Well, if you want to come down here, we'll figure something out. Yeah, maybe. We'll do something with that taint. Yeah, we'll take care of the taint. Maybe someday I'll come by and you guys can take care of my taint. All right, thank you, Veronica. We have one question for you guys. Before you... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I know I used so much of your time, but you know how you play old sketches in the first hour? Well, I don't know what you're talking about. We're here every day, too. We're here every day. I know. I know. Like I said, we're here every day, too. Well, when you're on vacation... Yeah. Could you guys try to play the one... I don't remember if it was Opie or Anthony's brother was in. You're talking about the dad. Oh, my brother, Brett. He's one of the guys. He's one of the guys. Oh, my brother, Brett. He's mortified with that story. Oh, my God. And he tried to give himself oral favors when he was like seven or eight, and he was able to do it. And then his mom walked in on him, and he had to try to convince his mom that he wasn't gay. Yeah. He was doing that, and he wanted to receive it, not give it. But since you're doing it yourself, you're doing both. Well, and it's crucial to the story that my mom knocked on the door, and my brother Brett didn't answer, so she figured, like, he drowned in the bathtub, so she broke down the door basically, and he was like, oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is static action. This song is called Push It. This guys playing May 4th at Irving Plaza. Another great band that's out these days. Hey do we still have those filter tickets to giveaway? So we have more filter tickets to giveaway. We're doing that all week long for ya. Filter playing with Varukasalt. April 20th at the Hammerstein Ballroom. We have your tickets. Hey there was one high point in my day over at the courthouse there. Oh you went to the court today? Oh yeah why do you think I was late? Oh. Yeah. I didn't notice that you were late and that he came in. You didn't notice? No not at all. You didn't notice me coming in with three cigarettes poking in my head drinking a beer? No I did not notice at all. Yeah sure. Yeah one highlight in the courtroom. A guy was having a heart attack. What? Yeah. A real heart attack? I think so. We're all sitting there in the courtroom. And this guy just starts going like puking and drooling and they give him his heart medication and then the EMS guys came in and hauled him out of there. He didn't like his settlement either. I guess not. I was next. I was doing the same thing but it wasn't my heart. I was like eeeh. Yeah they had to take him right out. No kidding. Do you know why he was in court? I don't know. I think we were all in there for the same fun reason. Really? It was all the same thing you know. All I know. You reminded me of like when I was like 12 years old. I come from a really big family and when daddy came home from work in a really bad mood. You want to stay away from him. And mom had to go around to all the kids and go you guys behave. Daddy had a bad mood. Daddy's in a bad mood. Daddy's in a bad mood. And now I came in the office and I throw the jacket down and I'm like get out of my chair. So I'm whispering to everyone. I'm whispering to everyone. Anthony is usually in a good mood ladies and gentlemen but I think he's a little pissed off today so let's not aggravate Anthony. Good thing no one came in to one of those dopey like meet and greets. Like they're always dragging people into our office. Yeah. I'm convinced the only reason they haven't dragged anybody by to meet us is because they don't know where the goddamn our office is anymore. Yeah so that was fun. Guy having a little heart episode. In the courtroom. Yeah. I just feel like you need to get some aggression out. Why? I'm fine. Why? I just feel it. You know when they saw like I don't know 2020 those angry management seminars or whatever where they beat each other with like the big fluffy you know bats and stuff. Uh huh. Just to get aggression out so you don't really so you don't kill a real person. Yeah. You know you've probably seen that on TV by now right. Uh huh. I think you need to get some aggression out. We brought you in a computer keyboard. Yeah. This thing. Those things blow up real good. This thing will shatter into a thousand pieces and I think you need to smash this so we can get on with the radio show today. I don't know I'm not that angry like that. I don't smash things in anger. Are you sure? Yeah you know because I really don't. Are you sure? Yeah you're more angry than me. Come on because it's so much fun. You're just as angry as me. I'm just. For various reasons and uh you've been known to smash stuff. You're better off at that. I just like confronting the issues verbally. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like um let's just say alright we'll bring up uh ah the wife's lawyer. Yeah the wife's lawyer. Walk in there it's like was was it was that a lawyer or a Hawaiian Tropic model? You know how it is to walk into a courtroom. I got my lawyer you know guy. I look at her lawyer. Holy sma. What a hot piece of ass this chick is. What? That's strategy. Like yeah yeah you you take my money you bitch. Yeah ride that ass. Look at you. You didn't think they were going to send the bloated one into the courthouse did you? You know I think uh it's pretty cool too at one point she comes over to confer with my attorney. And uh she kind of leaned over to talk to him. I think I caught a boob shot through her shirt. Yeah. Know how much that boob shot just cost you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In your whole life I don't think you spent that much money in a damn uh strip clubby bar. So I hope you enjoyed the view. Yeah you go for that settlement. Yeah yeah you yeah you take it. You let me ride daddy. Yeah she was a piece of ass. The funny thing is we have some major problems behind the scenes with our radio show so I called aunt. But it has nothing to do with your pals opie. No no we'll always be together. We're all we got on this show. So uh as far as the show is concerned. So I called aunt and I wanted to rant and tell them what's going on you know. Me behind my big desk wheeling a deal and I had to give them the latest news. And I realized where I called them and I'm like I think I'll just take care of this one by myself Anthony. All I heard was I dial up Anthony beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. And the phone rings and all of a sudden I just hear Anthony answering with a huge echo. I'm like oh this ain't good. He's like where are you? Ah court. I'm in court. I'm like okay take care I'll take care of this little problem. This is a tiny little problem compared to what you're going through. Yeah. Myself. You handle it on your end, Opie. I'll be in about three. Right. Just in time for the show. I'll slap a smile on my face and plow through this crap one more time. So Ann, come on. I'm pulling Opie and smash this thing. No. You know me. Come on. I really don't. You sure? I'm not comfortable taking out aggressions. It smashes. Come on. I couldn't do as good a job as you. I really couldn't. Do it for me. Do it for me. I would enjoy watching you do this. See, this is where we're different. I like to crack skulls and you like get back verbally. Okay. Yeah. See, that's how it is. But I know you're in a happy cam for tonight, to tell you the truth. I heard you hang the phone up at one point. We have problems. I'm going to ask management if we could do like two radio shows a day. Yeah. That's the only fun I have every day. All right, Ann. Yeah. I'm going to show you how much I care for you. All right. I'm going to take out your aggression. Thank you. You got to describe what's going on because I got to take off my headphones. Okay. All right. Oh, wow. Look at you. The first time ever putting on safety goggles. And remember, when working on your own machine shop, be sure to use safety goggles. Will this counter survive a hit? Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. Will we survive a hit? Hold on. You want me to take it on the door? Let me tell you something. What? Computer keyboards come apart like anti-personnel minds. Right. How about the corner of the real heavy door? What do you mean? It doesn't go through the glass. Well, no. It doesn't go through the glass. Yeah, this is it, Ann. All right. It's going to go into the lobby area, too. You know that. You sure? Wait a minute. Smash. Oh, no. We'll do better. No? Like this. All right. Okay. Wait a minute. Wait. Turn it the other way.

There you go. Break it. Break it. Break it. Break it. Break it. Nice. That's coming apart. Wow. That thing is coming apart. Holy smoke. Oh, yeah. Peace just went flying down the hallway. Oh. It's still coming apart. Did you cut yourself? Are you okay? This is the dumbest show we've ever done. What's he breaking? A computer keyboard because there's plenty of expendable ones around the studio and they come apart real nice. Let me see your hand. Did he cut himself? Yeah, I had to dump out. He said the F word. Yeah, he got a little cut on his hand. Oh, boy. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Let me just ... I know we're on the air, but it's nothing major, but he just told me to relay a message to you that you all have some figures. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Okay. I love the keyboard. Is he like really ... Oh, he's not in a good mood. I don't want to frame him. This is scary. Oh, my God. You haven't gotten any of these letters, Anthony, yet? No, I'm too busy with the stack of other letters saying that I have to give money. You know what? Can I call up Apollo Air Conditioning? I want my old job back. I want my tin-knocking job back. Well, if you report less income, there'll be less to pay. I'll get my truck, my Apollo van, and I'll just ... I'll knock tin again. Go back to when life was simple. Tom Futty on the phone. I want my job back. Holy crap. I could be funny for the electricians and the plumbers on the spackle buckets during lunch. That's all I need. That'll be an outlet. The Opie and Anthony show is falling apart right in front of your eyes today. It's great. Oh, my God. I can't do a show now. I'm sorry I had to call you on this, but this is like important. Oh, man. They're sweeping up this mess. I might need a stitch in my thumb. Oh, someone out there better come up with a plan to cheer us up immediately. Man, because I know. I don't know what the hell is going on. We're a mess today. Oh, kill that thing. Rosie. Are you going to break anything now? Welcome, little ones. Come on, give me a kiss. You want a kiss, Rosie? Dreams come true with Rosie. Holy, you can't say that, eh? Oh, my God. You can't say that. I just called Rosie a nice word. Hello? Yeah. Are you there? Yeah. Can I tell you what they send you in the envelope? What? They send you a little booklet that tells you all about the IRS collection process. Oh. I want you to know. Come on, give me a kiss. Let me gut this bitch. Well, the sad news is I don't have what they're looking for. I know. Uh-oh. But if I, when I bring it, he'll probably, he'll probably straighten the whole thing out. Wow. Hey, look what fell out of the Rosie doll, Twinkies. Rosie, what are you doing? Come on, give me a kiss. Hey, Ann, I thought you never got violent before. Oh, hold on. Give me my safety goggles. Rosie. Come on. Give me a kiss. He's got the brain of the Rosie doll in his hand. What happened, Rosie? Oh, geez. What? Rosie. She's still alive. What a cute dream come true. She's still alive. Oh my God. You know what I. All right, all right, I think she's dead. I think she's dead after all. Give me one more whack. Oh my God. Let me tell you something, when I go psycho it's kind of expected and it's no big deal. That is scary to see. If you guys go psycho man. Oh my God. It's pretty good. Well, okay thanks sweets. I'm sorry but like I said I go to a sport and being that you already got tired of having a bad day I didn't think it would make that much of a difference. You don't even want to know what it's doing in this style. What? Hot it out man, you're freaking me out. No, I just want to see how it works. You're losing your F in mine right there. Me? Yeah. You're the one with keyboard and hand smashing it across the room. It's expected from me. You should see your eyes, they went back. It went back in his head. Like George. Eyes rolled back wide. Life is eyes like a doll's eyes. And then the horrible hype is screaming and hollering as they come pounding and pounding. Wow. I wonder if we can do the show from jail. Oh Jesus. You could probably do it from jail. I just have to call you there. May please. Oh yeah. If Hope is going I'm next. If he's going then you're probably not far behind. Yeah, we got to lift the drinking ban on the show. Okay, terrific. Alright, well I'm going to go. Oh gee, thanks. Okay, terrific. Hope the rest of your day goes better. Is everything going to be okay, Scotso? Okay. It's going to be okay? Okay. What do we need? Virgin. Yeah. Okay. Is it okay if we drink, Scotso? Okay. Alright. Alright. Where are the beers? Coming. Oh really? What about some more whiskey? Coming. Oh yeah, and we'll drink it all? Okay. Send in the... Virgin. Yeah, Scotso. We love Scotso. He's got the lip smack. Hey Scotso, you want a whiskey sour? Okay. Yeah? Where are those beers? Coming. Oh no, Mark has brought in a Gia Pet for us to smash. Dude, if you... If you take the hammer to that, I'm going to have to leave the studio. What, to the Gia Pet? Yeah. I'm done with the hammer. I'm putting the goggles back on. I don't trust you. Rosie's done. Can I go now? Yeah, bye Sam. Alright, bye. Let me know what goes on. What? Let me know what goes on. Yeah, I'll just give you a buzz later. Alright. Okay, bye. Bye. We're getting a little out of hand on this show today. Just a tap. It brings back memories. Peace! What are you doing? I'm putting the head on. I'm putting the head on. That's how you do it. Doesn't it bring back memories of our last studio? Oh, when we used to just completely destroy it every day? We were so pissed. You guys think we've been pissed the last two years here at NEW, even though things lately have been very, very good for your pals, Hope and Anthony. The last station we worked at, we were so frustrated and pissed off that we would beat up the studio every day. At one time, remember we used to have a tombstone? It was like a 40, 50 pound tombstone that held the door open? Yeah, it was like a doorstone. We threw that through a wall. We threw it through a wall and then hung up like a bulletin board or something to cover the hole. Oh, and the Green Day story is classic. Oh boy. Alright. Wow, Hope. I need a stitch in my thumb and look at my hand shaking because it's all f'ed up. Smash more stuff. I don't think I can. I'm serious. I don't think I can hold anything. Alright. Virgin. Virgin. Virgin. Yeah. Hmm. Okay, great. Let's, uh, can we, can we, um, can we have a fundraiser? I think we're gonna need one. Ugh. Wise ass. What? Cranky ass from midtown. Hey Anthony, you better cash Hope's check before it bounces. Okay, terrific. Yeah. Now see, see, this is reality. Oh, I'm shaking. Dude, look at this. I am completely shaking. Linda, I'm, I'm poor. It's a long joke. I think I should go to the hospital. Taking the knife out of a cheese. You think he wants some cheese? Oh my God. The penalty and the interest, I think, is only about 15, 16 percent on that too. I'm having a nervous breakdown. Shut up. I'll get a job. I'll work. That's it. We'll eat tuna fish sandwiches. And ride the subway. Oh, wow. What happened? I don't know. Things seem to be going pretty well just a week ago, right? Yeah, we were, we were like moving right along. Everything seemed cool. Taking vacation. Where's the next vacation gonna be? Face shore. Comeck Motorway. CMI can't do that. I'm gonna go to the airport. I'm gonna go to the airport. I'm gonna go to the airport. Comeck Motorway. CMI can't afford that. You crazy? CMI and Domino's. White Castle. White Castle, yeah, what the hell. Huh. Well. Alright, so that's good. What else is gonna happen today? Shh. Knock, knock, knock, knock. Ha, ha, ha. Virgin coming. What else could possibly happen today, Anthony? I don't know. Alright. Unbelievable. What a mess. I'm a little shaken. This is no bit. Yeah, we gotta take a break. Alright, man. 19,000? 19,000? I didn't even think I made 19,000 last year. Yeah, what is that about? Huh. Huh. Okay. Well, let's take a break and we'll get through. Oh, okay. And we'll get some more band-aids for the opster because he's bleeding to death. And we'll be back. 212-757-1027. I'm used to the crazy people. Oh. Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. Are you mental? No, it's our show! I'm a madman! I'm getting hit! Like a stalk-raising mad person. No! I'm getting hit! No! Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. No! Opie and Anthony. How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? 1027-WNEW. Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Yes. Stacker 2, uh, melts away the fat like, uh, like cash out of the Opie and Anthony show. It's amazing. I wonder how many Stacker 2 you need to take to OD. Until you whittle away to nothing. Yeah. Well, Stacker 2. Hey, Kim from New Jersey. I would like to donate $100 to the ONA fund. Yeah, I don't think so. I'd go for a BJ. I don't think we can. Yes, yeah. Oh. Well, Stacker 2 is the world's strongest fat burner. Alright, listen, listen, listen. No kidding aside, there's two things that have to happen here. We completely pick up the show and go to like Lebarbat. Or they, they, uh, they, they get us beers in the studio immediately. Yeah, I think we gotta lift the, uh, we need some, the booze band. We need some kind of exception made for the Opie and Anthony show. Can we do it? Can we do it in a way that, uh, wait, we gotta, uh, well, we can do one of those cool radio, um, things where you, you drink and then you do reflex tests to see, uh, the effects of drinking on you. I think they have to be monitored by a police officer though, isn't that how it has to work? We got a police officer. Hey, look at that. What a, what a stroke of luck. What a coincidence. There's a cop right here in our studio. We'll do, uh, sobriety testing. Yeah. You know what? The nose, the walking the line. In all fairness though, I mean, we're in, we're on good terms with the new bosses. We got to work out a deal because I don't need them pissed at us too. Why not? I think they're all that's left. Right. So what were the three things it does, Opie? What? Where? Who? Stacker two. Oh, we're talking about Stacker two? Yeah. Does it come in a real heavy bottle? So you can bang it over your own head? Yeah. Uh, no. No. Okay. But it will, uh, it will burn fat, build lean muscle. What's the opposite of Stacker two? Um, unstacker, uh, one. I don't know. Why? Valium, morphine. Yeah. Anything that would make you lazy and tired. So you could just lay there and gain weight. Yeah. I knew that. You want to do that? I knew that right now. You want to end up on the Jerry Springer show as one of those 800 pound guys that can't leave the house? Yeah. It seems a lot safer. It does. And no one will be asking for money. Oh, Lord. All right. Well, it, uh, it burns the fat. All right. To everyone who knows me, stop asking me for money because officially I have no more. That's it. None. Done. None. Done. Done. Yeah. Um, oh, burns the fat. Uh, it gives you boost energy. Yeah. And, uh, you won't have those cravings to snack during the day. So you'll be losing weight. Why are you so chipper? You lost more money than I did today. You know what I am? You know that open nerve? That's the only thing that makes me feel a little better, knowing that you got it worse today. You know the nerve that is like in an open wound and it really stings? Yeah. And then after a while the stinging becomes so bad that you don't even feel it anymore? Yeah. Welcome to my nightmare. That's you? That's me right now. So when does the stinging go away from me? Uh, that might take a little while. Really? You need a few more zeros before I, uh, you're really smart, man. A few more zeros. Before you really start hurting. Oh boy. What happened? What the hell happened, Opie? We had a really good show yesterday, right? Yeah. I don't know what happened. I just got a big huge envelope from a certain organization today. Organizations? Yeah. And, uh, from a mob family. Oh my God. And they, um, they want money from you. They want money from you. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Looks like we're all going to be eating french fried potatoes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You touch that boy. All right, yeah, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. It burns the fat, it gives you a boost of energy, and it, uh, crushes the cravings to snack in between meals. It all ends up to losing lots and lots of weight. Losing weight. Yeah, Stacker 2. Give them a call, 1-800-LIGHTLINE, that's 1-800-KILMDE. No, no, that's not it. Oh, that's not the number? No. You. I'm sorry, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Give them a call, 1-800-SUCKDI. Do you know the number? Because I don't have it in front of me right now. It's 1-800-LIGHTLINE, L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. All right. L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Okay. And, uh, they have a website, www.stacker2.com, right? Uh, what? Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Thousands have proven it works. Oh. I'm all for violence sometimes, got that right? Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies. God, I want to punch you in the face. Better leave a bruise. 1027 WNEW. The Reverend Al checking in, Anthony. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. What does Reverend Al say? Uh, you see, Opie, that's how demand sticks it to you. But it could have been worse. They could have shot you 41 times like a black man. Oh. Ouch. IRS checking in, Anthony, from D.C. Yeah. Uh, Opie, time to marry Sandy. Oh! Time to marry Sandy. Best tax break. Best tax break. Tax break. It's official. I'm never, ever, ever, ever getting married. Unless, uh, there's something called an ironclad prenup. No such thing. The one thing I do is pay attention and after listening to Ann for the last month and a half, there's no way in hell. Hell. Hell. Hmm. Interesting. Fascinating. Okay. I learned one thing in radio school, Ann. I'll share it with you. What's that? Um, they tell you in like college radio and stuff? Yeah. To leave your problems behind the door. Oh, that's it. Come in, because the people just want to have a good time while they're listening to you. That's right. So whatever problems you have on the outside world, you leave it behind that studio door there. You'll leave it behind until after the show. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What's a crap? That ain't working, huh? Not at all. I know. Okay, let's go to Greg. Hey, Greg, what's going on? Hey, what's up? How are you? I'm all right. Good. All right, I'm starting an opiate Anthony fund in my school. Nice. And I'm collecting $2 from each person and I'll send it into the studio. $2. Did you have like a bake sale? Yeah, I'll do that too. All right, Greg, thank you. All right, bye. Bye. Uh, Wayne, what's going on? Hey, how are you guys doing? Real good. All right, listen, I got an idea. Okay. How about you guys auction off a pair of tickets to go with you to WrestleMania over the weekend? Oh, I like it. We have tickets. Well, you just got to convince Vince to give you another set of tickets now, don't you? No, I will personally give you my trip. Sure. Let's see, two plane tickets to LA. Two tickets to WrestleMania. Yeah. Two tickets to the VIP parties. How much do you think we could get? A lot. Really? How much? I'm not submitting whatever you feel like starting in that, no? A few thousand? Is there any problems if we do that? Probably. Probably. I would think so. I remember a gentleman calling up yesterday, something to do with scalping. He said if we sold it for more, it's actually scalping, isn't it? Yeah. Sean from Jersey, looks like Opie's going to have to sell that classy cabrio. All right, guys, good luck. So much for the opster getting his brand new SUV. Thank you, Wayne. Yeah, come on, Rambler. All right, let's go to Karen. Hey, Karen, what's up today? Hey, guys, what's up? Hey. How many listeners do you guys have? Do you know? Yeah, a couple million. All right, if you had every listener, because a lot of your listeners are really devoted to your show, you know that. Every listener, if every listener sent in a dollar. Let me, Suppy Sales tried that and got more trouble than Karen. There's nothing wrong with that idea. Let me tell you something. There was a guy that did that and got an S load of trouble. Why? Because people will actually do it. I do it? Yeah. You guys are funny as hell. No, we got to... Please don't do that. You guys will get us screwed. Yeah. Why would you get in trouble? It's just against the law. Yeah. How is that against the law? It is. It just is. Sorry. All right. I appreciate it though, Karen. Yeah. All right, bye. Bye. Let's go to Mario. Hi, Mario, what's up? How are you doing? Yeah. Here's an idea. Yeah. All those songs you got, the contest. For the... For the songs. Oh, yeah, okay. Put them on a CD. I guarantee that goes platinum in a week. I was thinking of doing something like that. I wonder if we can. Probably not. Release a CD with all the most offensive songs on it. No, no. Sell it on the internet. No, definitely not. No, no. All right. Thank you, Mario. All right, thanks a lot. You guys rule. All right. That's a great idea. Oh, come on. Tim, what's going on? Hey, Opie, I just want to ask you a question. Yeah. Is Sandy going to have to start making you sugar sandwiches and give them to you in a wall bounce bag now? So far? Yeah. Yeah. I've never known riches, so I'll be just fine. Yeah. Yeah, we'll take you. You'll have to go back to the Army blankets. Go to the suicide, Salvation Army now. All right. Thank you, Tim. Over and out, Diamond Duck. Is that Tom from My Old Job? You want to go there? I said I want My Old Job back. All right, hold on, hold on. Let's go to... Hold on, Anthony. I'm out of there, O. Can you work the phones? No, I can't do anything now. You're a mess. All right, how's that? Hey, Tom. Hey. Hey, how you doing? Hey, how you doing, buddy? Hey, can I have My Old Job back? You can have it. You can always come back. It's always about 90 degrees and really hot on that roof, so you can really appreciate the hard work you do. Yeah. You know, I remember though, there's no more inside work where you can look in the ladies' bathrooms. Oh, what? It's all like outside now? It's all outside now. We haven't been doing any ladies' locker rooms lately. I know how much you used to like looking in them. Now... Drawing in the ceiling. Do I get my van back? Of course. How much would I spend you at 10.30 a night on Comac Road? Tell them you're going to practice. I'm going to practice. I'm going to practice. I'm going to practice. I'm going to practice.

Why aren't they simpler times, Opie? The best job I ever had was when I was a caddy. I'm totally serious. No worries in the world. Yeah. Drink all night, four or five hours of sleep, you're looping. Done. Loop in, talking to some interesting people around the course. Yeah, pro Jack. And all of a sudden, the Dalai Lama. It was so simple, though. Flowing robes to grace, bald, specking. All right, John from the Instant Feedback. Get the $20,000 reward for turning Psycho Mark into the DEA. Ooh, that's a good idea. That's a great idea. That might work. Thank you for that, John. Oh, no. All right, let's go to Joe. Why is he running in here? Because he knows it's true. Yeah. Joe, what's up? Hello, I figured out a way you cannot pay taxes. You've got to convert to become a heeb. And then you set up a synagogue in your basement and you don't have to pay taxes because it's religious organization. Oh, that old gag. I'm the furthest from a heeb. No, you just convert. And Anthony, you know what you can do? What? You can paint yourself black, have your wife, and say the Glovedilence. Oh, stop it. All right, Joe, thank you. Let's go to Michelle. Let's go to Michelle. We need the support of our listeners today. Yeah. Hey, Michelle, what's up? Not much. I would love to support you guys, but I was out of my car for like 15 minutes and I have no idea what happened. Wow. All of a sudden it was all depressing. That was a key 15 minutes. Let's give you a 10-second summary. Yeah, I guess. Anne, would you like to give the 10-second summary? I had my first day in court on my divorce. Uh-huh. Which is enough right there. That explains enough of Mike's frigging attitude. All right. And my 10 seconds, Michelle, I got a call from my house. Uh-huh. A big, huge envelope waiting for me. I heard the very, very end of Sandy's call. I didn't know what happened. Well, we opened it up and we discovered that Iowa, a certain organization, $19,000. Holy cow. Yeah. So we're in a very good mood because I don't have $19,000. You guys heard me pitch in a complaint about a $600 check the hand. Yeah. Yeah, today kind of sucks then, huh? Oh, you can say that. Yeah, you can say that. Hope you just give me the $19,000. I'll invest it and cut it into $200 like I did your $600. Dude, I have all the faith in the world in your day trading skills. Not the past two days. I'm going to hand you $19,000. You've got to double my money by the end of April. Oh, you're insane. Why not? If it goes away, then I just tell them I don't have it. Is the Nasdaq ever going back up? All right, Michelle. That dollar thing sounds pretty good though. I mean, you don't have to ask for it. We could just do it. That would really be awful. That's dangerous territory. A couple of jocks have lost their jobs over that. Yeah, you don't even joke. Thank you, Michelle. Good luck, guys. We love you. We're going to have a great show today though. Bye. Yeah, we were, weren't we? No, we're going to still have one. Looks like someone I live with is going to have to get a job. Whoa. Whoa. Wow. We need income. That's a bold statement. We're going to need some income. Ponto. What to do? Break into a dice impression or something? What do you do at this point? You know? I'm like, oh, I'm just like freaking. Nah, we're all right. Old dirty checking in. Oh, old dirty. Well, he's going to laugh at us. Oh, D. Yo, what up? I see you've run into a little financial difficulty. A little. Bro, 19 Gs. Back off on that receiver, yo. Yeah, yo. Yeah. Listen, listen. Yeah, what you got for me? I could flip your money, beef, quicker than the NASDAQ. And you don't need a laptop. Oh, yeah? Yeah. What's it going to cost me in the long run, yo? Not much. You got 15, you got 15, 20 vision, right? Yeah. Yeah, we need a lookout, yo. A lookout. Yeah. Wouldn't it pay more if I was the wheel man? What, I do the wheel man? I want to be a wheel man. Nah, yo, we don't do nothing in vehicles no more. No? No? Oh, D. Have you ever been in situations like us here? Yo, my answer to that is start having children. They're worth like 3, 4 Gs every time you file taxes. I'm going to have to have quintuplets. Yo, Antonio. Yeah. If you're what? Let me not say that. Can't say that over the phone. If a certain person is eliminated from the divorce proceedings, do they continue? Just stop. Nah, that's a joke like that, man. It's not that bad, yo. Oh my God. I'm in shock. You guys were on top of the world a week ago, man. See how quickly it... See what happens, bro? Quickly it comes tumbling down. What goes up must come down, bro. Alright. Yo, you guys want to flip your money, man. And it's tax free, bro. Yeah. It is. And then you end up like you. Nah. In jail. Hey, what do you mean you're going to end up like me? In jail. Yeah, man.

Alright, bro. Peace. Alright, bye. Yeah, you're loving it today. You bastard. Yeah. Hey, Mark, you're next on N.E.W. How are you? Hey, what's going on, guys? What's up? I have the answer to all your problems. Oh, cool. Okay, listen. What you need to do is start your own company, the O&A Entertainment Company. Yeah. Then you have an IPO and you guys make out. And you get the big nose off the radio. You'll have your own TV shows. You'll have your syndication and you'll have everything. Whew. These ideas aren't perking me up, Opie. Yeah, these ideas. How are they doing for you? These ideas blow. Yeah. Oh, well then. Thank you. Alright, thank you. Suck. Bye. On the instant feedback, Pesci writes, hey, O, in radio school, do they teach you how to be intimate with a 400-pound guy when you go to jail? Oh. That ain't funny. Why are you laughing? I think you're delirious. I have in mind that you're delirious. Oh. God. Everyone just wants to talk about that. It's so hard to move on. Other things. We'll move on. Okay. Hey, we could talk about your hands, making you gay. Yeah, we'll get into that next. We'll see some wacky news and stuff. We'll see who's gay on the show because I'm sure everyone put their hand down and went, oh, holy cow, I've got to make sure I'm not gay. Yeah, I know. Everyone did. Alright, we'll get into that next. Stay there. What's that, a train? What's that, a train? OP and Anthony, 1027 WNEW. Holy war. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The OP and Anthony Show, 212757 1027 as we try to move on with the radio show today. Man. And you were talking about the, where's the paper? Can I have the daily news and the post? It's in the post. No, I'm not, I don't want the papers to look in them. I want them to cover myself on the park bench tonight in a pillow. Yeah, here we go. Well, they'll be saying fingertips, your finger size, my tip is on whether you're gay. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see, they've fingered it out. Very funny joke. Yeah. Virtually all men have index fingers that are a little shorter than their ring fingers. Okay, let me look. Just, you know. But, but if a man's index finger is a lot shorter than his ring finger, he might be gay. So stupid. If your index finger is a lot shorter than your ring finger. Yeah, gay. What do you think? Let's say, come on everybody, hold up your hands. Go ahead. The funny thing, no, let's do one at a time. You can put it right on the paper and everything. The funny thing is, I mean, everyone who read this in the post today, the first thing they did was plunk their hand down to make sure. Yeah. And like, oh, thank God. Uh-huh. All right, let's, come on everyone, spazz, let's start with you. Now what's the deal, Anthony? If your index finger is a lot shorter than your ring finger, because most of the time it's just a little shorter than your ring finger. If it's a lot shorter, you know. Okay. Then you're gay. All right, I'm going to make a bet right here. I haven't seen anyone's hands. Give me a pen. What are you going to do? I'm going to bet spazz is gay. Has gay hands. Has gay hands. I'm going to bet that Psycho Mark has gay hands. Gay hands. And I am going to bet that you're hetero. I have hetero hands. Does Gary know what I am? Okay. Hetero. And Ben. Ben, I think I'm going to go Ben. No, I think I'm going to go Ben hetero. Hetero hands. Anyone else? Keith the Cop, you want in? All right, I'll play. Gay. Keith the Cop, gay hands. All right. Who wants to start? We've got to be gay on the show. Spazz. Spazz. Spazz doesn't want to lift his hands up because you already know the answer, right? All right, well, come over here. Not too close though. Hold up your hand. All right, hold, put your right hand on the post. I just want to see him hold it up. No, you have to do it this way. Yeah. Like this. Yeah. All right, hold it up toward us, okay? Oh. Oh, wait a minute. That's teetering. No, he's not gay. Gay. You're not gay, Spazz. I was wrong about it. I'm pointing to the finger. Look how excited he is. What, you weren't sure? I was sure. I don't know. I would have hated to have to start dating guys when my finger was short. Psycho Mark, you ready? Yeah, I'm a flaming faggot. Hold it up. Come over here. Come over here. Now hold up your right hand toward Anthony. No, come on, come on. What? No, the other way. Let's see. No, this way. The right hand. Oh, whatever. All right, Ant. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Dang it. Hey. Okay. That's a little shorter, right Ant? A little more than everyone else. Okay. Hey. You. Hey. Mark, gay. According to his head, right? I guess I'm burping. What about stinky? Well, you live with a gay. Oh, wait. And what's your bet on stinky? Now, I'll say straight. Straight? Okay. Show your hand to Anthony, the right hand. Yeah. Wow. Wait. Turn it toward. Yeah, you're straight. Yeah. Look at him. The clone spaz. What are you? You guys are idiots. Thank God. I just found out I'm straight. What about Obie? I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. I'm straight. What about Obie? Ant? Let's see. Flaming, flaming, flaming. Wow. Your index finger is all screwed up from basketball, but look. Your index finger is bigger than your ring finger. I know. You're like Superman. That's right. Look at how he bent the knuckle a little bit. No. Yeah, right? My hands are all effed up from years of getting popped in the hand with a basketball. What? That's probably what I'm talking about. That's probably why they figured this theory out. You're slamming butts so much with your, you know what, it's making your fingers shorter. I don't know if that made the radio, but okay. Keith the Cop. Let's see. So far the only one that's gay is Mark. Mark has the gay hand. Ant? I'm okay. Let me see. I don't know. What? Your index finger isn't shorter than, this has to be shorter than this. Wait, that has to be shorter? No, then you're over the top too. Yeah. Okay. I'm like, oh man. Very good. Ben? It's for you. See? He's straight too. It's a little short. Let me see. Not like Mark's. Look at Mark's. Put your hand up to Ben from a distance. Face Anthony. Put that gay hand up. Yeah, face Anthony with the other hand. Oh my gosh. It's so much shorter. Oh my gosh. Gay. How about that? Weird, babe. We did our own little gay test. We did our little gay test. What about John, our intern? Where is he? Let's give other people the gay test. Gay. How's your gay? Lift up your right hand. Face Ant. He's fine. He came in here all fast and everything. All cocky. The people at New Way might have a problem. We're like, oh no. Everybody that looked beforehand is holding up their hands. Look, I'm fine. The only one is Mark. Hello. Hey. Doug is saying we're doing the test wrong. Doug, what's up? Yeah, you guys are supposed to put your hand down on the table so it's flat. We did. Well, all right. If you're holding it up, everybody's fingers are going to be the same size because it gets crunched up. Well, we did the test accurately. Yeah. And it makes a lot of sense, the results. Indication to century, guys. Later. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. All right. What a stupid test, right? Yeah. I mean, I know. And they asked the- How do they figure that out? They asked people on the street, you know, what do you think of research that suggests the length of the index finger can indicate someone is gay? Let's see. Ivan, an artist from Manhattan, I don't think there's a physical marker for homosexuality. As he scratched himself with his very short index finger. I think in one of the papers it said it was only for the lesbians, actually. It really didn't have anything to do with the guys. Yeah, it was for Salads Sisters. Oh, yeah? Well, that happened. John Doe? All right. Well, that was a waste of time. No, we all took the test. And your stepfather's on the line. Sal. Hey, Sal, you're not yelling at me, are you? No, I'm not yelling. This is going to be an easy one. Okay. Am I on the air? Of course you are. Oh, okay. You've got to turn that radio down. Oh, that's the other side. Hey, look, this is your union delegate, slash your stepfather. Yes. I'm making you an offer you can't refuse. He really is. Starting tomorrow. Yeah. You start Apollo tomorrow. Uh-huh. Start 11 o'clock in the morning. You work at the one. That's like the old days. So one hour for lunch. That's like the old days. You get a 50,000 a week. You get a chauffeur driven a truck with the three helps. I don't want that much money. Guaranteed for life. I want my, like, what was I making? Is that all right? I could do that. Besides, I want to know how you make out in the court today. Oh, very well. Very well. If that's the problem, I take care of that for you, too. It's like the gym. I walked out a little lighter. A little lighter? How much lighter you want? A little lighter. Okay, we'll make that a whole lot lighter. Yeah, you just hold on, Sal, because I might need my old Apollo job back. No problem. I make a deal today for you. It was a lot easier. I made it a deal today. All right, Super Wop. Listen to him. I'll call you. I'll let you know how everything worked out. Okay. All right, Sal. You take care. Tell my mommy I said hi. Hi, mommy. Okay, goodbye. Take it easy, Sal. There goes Sal. Everyone's a comedian now. Okay, let's take another break here, okay? Oh, yeah? Yeah. It's break time. Are we slowly getting out of our hole? Yeah, I think so. Look at that. All right, we'll be back. 2127571027. Opie. Keep your hands away from your pants. Do it. And Anthony. I'm Mr. Flaming Fett. More stupidity on the way. 1027-WNEW. Hey, New York. This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio, Opie and Anthony on 1027-WNEW. Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career that you consider specifically to be in bad taste? Have you looked back on it? Maybe it's the time you thought it was a good play, but you looked back on it and you think that was in bad taste. Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that I like. One time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and there were all gay people in the audience, they told me. So I figured I'd do it. In San Francisco? No. So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate. Yeah, it's warm up. They love that. And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it there were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son. And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, because it's not an achievement. It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that. And I just wondered, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually bragging at work like that. Hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh my God, we're proud of him, Johnny. He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? And now he's articling over at a law firm, and oh yeah, he loves c***. You know? That's the shit. He can't get enough c*** in his mouth, his ass, his kids always c***. I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's c***. I want to show it to him. That never gets old. Arguing over at a law firm. Oh yeah, he loves c***. Kyle from Connecticut, on the issue of feedback. I bet Jay Moore's pointer doesn't reach past his pinky. That's pretty good. Very good. All right. Yeah. Well, we're having fun today. Oh yeah. Let's see what else is going on with the paper today, huh? El Dorado is a erotic homo film. What? The new Disney flick, El Dorado. Oh yeah? I saw the commercials for that when I was seeing the movie. Yeah. And I don't know why. Well, a lot of people are claiming that the two guys in it are like... Gay. Gay. They're hands drawn, you know, with a short finger. Because that might mean gay. Hey look, black girls in the studio. Hi, Errol. People are emailing us saying, how come we didn't check black girls fingers for the gay finger? Yeah, let's check for the gay finger. Hold up your hand. No, your right hand. Oh my God. The other way, the other way. Put them together, put them together. No, hold your right hand toward anything. Fingers together. Turn it around. Holy s***. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's gayer than black. Oh my God. Virgin. Wow. Virgin. Virgin. Gay. You have no idea what we're talking about? Virgin. There's a gay test in the post today and guess what, Errol? You passed. Wow. Oh yeah, I'm a meat plower. Errol, they say if your index finger, which is supposed to be the same size or just a hair shorter than your ring finger, they say if it's a lot shorter than your ring finger, you're gay. That's a kind of thing that I busted my pinky playing baseball. It's not the pinky that you should be worried about. I'm just saying. What finger do you pick your nose with? Right, okay, exactly. Unless you're digging really deep and hitting a back wall to make that thing shorter, you've got a problem. No, I'm just saying, not many times I've hurt my hand. Errol, if you could come here for a second. Errol, just come here and put your hand flat. We'll do it like this. Do it like this. So there's no doubt. No doubt. Put your hand flat on this hand and fingers together. Holy smoke. Dude, that finger is almost as short as your flat. The index is almost as short as his pinky. Holy smoke, look how short that is. Dude, look at this. Wow, that is the gayest hand ever. That explains everything right there. Now everything makes sense. Errol. Hey. Errol. Hey. Hey, Errol. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wow. Macho, macho, Errol. We've got to get a picture of that and put it on the website. That is, you have the gay hand. That is the gayest hand ever, according to the post. Is it more gay than mine? Yeah. Look at it. Oh my God, he's a baguette. Psycho Mark. Psycho Mark who passed the gay test as well. But that's nothing. But he's not as gay as Errol. Compared to Errol, I mean that is like ridiculously short. Errol, it's time to confess it live on our show. Oh, sailor. All the pieces are together now. The short finger. Yeah, like Errol, he's arguing in the long term. Wow, man. Oh, wow. He came running in like he just assumed he was going to pass the test. Wow. I had no idea what you guys were talking about. No idea. Errol, just a few questions. You've never gotten laid, right? Not in a while. Virgin. Okay, you're a virgin. When was the last time you were out on a date with a girl? Uh. Hey. 18 months. Hey. 18 months? Hey. Hey. Now, Errol. Have you, I don't know, have you had the opportunity in the past year to engage in any sexual relations with a woman? Yes. And you haven't? No. Okay. Virgin. Hey. Virgin. Hey. And why didn't you plow her? Virgin. I don't know, you know something, that hand. I'm a man, I'm stunned. We are all. Like, I thought we would. Yeah, even Psycho Marx is marginal. Now we know why you hang out with Rod and Fest. Hey. Hey. Hey. Bring the bell. Rude and rude. Rude. Rude. Rude. Really? No, we like Rod and Fest. Really? Errol, you have a problem there with your hand. What? It's my hand. The gay hand. You didn't jam it in a door or anything, did you? I had busted more. Jammed it in a bob? Busted more ass. Hey, hey. Hey, Errol. Ercol. Yeah. This one's going out to Errol. Errol wants to feel your body, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Okay. You can't help but... You can't ever leave me. He's a macho man. He can't help but... anyone he sees. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Virgil. Okay. Coming. Coming. Hey. Hey. Coming. Coming. Coming. Coming. Okay. Virgil. Okay, terrific. Virgil. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Okay, come it. Come it, come it. Virgil. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. It wouldn't be the Opiate Anthony show without a mix from Ant Boy Slim. It wouldn't be the Opiate Anthony show without a mix from Ant Boy Slim. Oh my God. Oh my God. That finger is a little rough there. Gay. Someone is saying you guys should make black Urkel. Urkel. Urkel. Urkel. Oh boy, look at my gay hand. Urkel. Well there you go, Earl, you're gay. The paper says it, it must be true. Yeah, it's in the post. You know that. You've got to believe everything you read in the post. You're gay. Hey! Tom from Teaneck, New Jersey writes, who is gayer, Earl or his husband? Erl. Erl. Erl swings both ways, boys and men. Did you expect the finger difference to be that drastic? Not that drastic. That's pretty drastic. That is funny. Let's go to Jason. Jason, what's up today? What's going on, fellas? How are you? I was just talking to my friend Johnny Cochran, have you already told me? Yeah. What's the end of the quote? You don't have a joke, do you? No. We're just being honest, we like that. Alright Jason, thank you. So there you go, we accomplished something on the show already today. We've proven that Earl is indeed gay. Okay, terrific. This just in, Doug from Jersey, Earl is the new president of NAMBLU. Wow! Jeez, that little finger. We're going to have to change the name of the Stephen Lynch tune to If I Were Earl. Earl likes man ass coming in. Earl's a kid toucher. Call Earl the Earl of Buttocks. That's a good one. Call Earl the Earl of Buttocks. Let's see what Antoine wants. Antoine! Yeah, Earl's gay, terrific. Oh, gay, terrific. Earl's gay, terrific. That's all I got to say about that. That's beautiful, thank you. Alright, bye. Great. No. Oh, no. Oh, stop it. Holy cow. The inappropriate gun. I apologize to my, to our African listeners there. There's a lot of hatred out there. I apologize to our colored listeners. A lot of, a lot of hatred. Jack from the City writes, Jay Moore has a strong pimp hand. Black Earl has a strong gay hand. Oh, someone warning me. Anthony, don't touch that bell. Earl molested it with his homo hand. Oh, gee. Do you have anything to say, Earl? The evidence is coming in pretty strong. No, I don't. You sure? Could we just see the hand again? One last look at the hand. Wow. Oh, my God. What? You know how many times I've busted this hand? Playing sports, playing baseball, playing basketball. Sports. Is that what you call it? Oh, stop it. Yeah. All right. Thanks, Earl. What? I'm going to defend the test against the post? The index finger has to be a little shorter, right, Earl? That way it touches the most sensitive part of another man's... Oh. Oh. Hope he's gagging. That's funny. I needed a good laugh today. Right, Scott? What's Earl, Scott? Virgin. Earl, are you a butt virgin? Okay. All right. Well, we'll get into the controversy over this movie next, I guess. Oh, right. I forgot that's where we were going originally. Yeah, El Dorado. I can't wait till this gay overtone is in El Dorado. Oh, that's where we were, right. Yeah. El Dorado. You ever see that, Earl? No. All right, Scott. All their fingers are a little shorter. Their index finger. Well, we could do it real fast. A lot of people are thinking that the new movie by DreamWorks, Disney flick, right, Anne? That the two main characters are gay in it. The film, which follows the adventures of Tulio and Miguel... Tulio? Tulio and Miguel, two con men buddies searching for the lost city of gold, features an erotically charged massage. Wait, they massage each other? Yeah, and a suggested sex scene between Tulio and his love interest, Chell. Wait, Chell, a guy? Yeah. And the two male leads, voiced by Kevin Klein and Kenneth Branagh, skinny-dipping a hot spring together before scampering naked through the rainforest. Scampering? If you're scampering naked... Another man. With Miguel flashing what has to be the first naked male behind to be featured in a mainstream animated movie. Cartoon man ass, Earl. Yeah. Look at that cartoon man ass. That's what I like. Cartoon man ass. I got to tell you, Bing. That's tight, that cartoon man ass. I'm not. Earl, you said that you broke your hand playing a lot of sports. I didn't break my hand. And that's the excuse for the index finger being drastically shorter. I don't know. Which means according to the poster gang. Well, Dave on line 8 wants to ask you, did Earl break his hand pitching or catching? Yeah, what was it, Earl? Pitching or catching? Be honest. This is so wrong. Could have been when he was switch hitting. The only spot Earl played is hide the salami. Okay. Okay, horrific. And that's it about El Dorado. A couple wacky scenes there. El Dorado. I saw the trailer for that. I really didn't pick up on the whole gay angle. Just looked like they were kind of having fun because they're cartoons. Yeah. Cartoon man ass. Gay. Alright, let's take a break, Anthony. And we'll be back. OPI, boring, Anthony, boring, producer rip, boring, spag. Gay, gay, gay. The OPI and Anthony Show. 1027, O-W-N-E-W. This is the Earl's hand on the unofficial website. So they're doing that in the back of the studio. They're getting a picture of Earl's gay hand. And they're also going to put a picture of the post article. Send it off to Steve so you guys can judge for yourself. Why are you taking pictures of us in the studio? Yeah, Earl, what are you doing, man? What is that, for your private collection at home? I need new spanking material? What's that about? No, we just don't have any good studio shots. I need pictures of that. Man, Anne. So, alright, you guys don't have good studio shots of OPI and Anthony, right? The ones we have are like you with your swamp lip or... So why did you pick the day where Aunt and I are probably in the worst moods of our lives? Do you know what time I got up this morning? 6.30. When was the last time I saw 6.30 in the morning? I'll tell you. When I was up from the night before and hadn't been to sleep yet. Earl, do you realize I got a bill for $19,000 today? Maybe today is not the day to take cute little studio shots of OPI and Anthony. Yeah. Here, we'll give you one. I'm not feeling too fun today. Okay. Maybe tomorrow would be a better day for something like that. Perhaps. You owe 19 grand? Yeah. At least I'm not gay. Yeah, it could be worse. You could have that short gay hand. Oh, yeah. So maybe today is not the day to click pictures. Alright, who broke the no crunching rule? I don't know. I went in there. Frankie, did you break the no crunching rule? I went in there and smelt crunch. I just smelt crunch. And in all fairness, you know, stinky, and I'm not gay. I just smelt crunch. And in all fairness, you know, stinky, who's the clone of Spaz. Yeah. The government has already cloned humans and his name is stinky. Yeah. Stinky doesn't smell anymore. He just happened to have a bad day the first day he started on the job with the OPI and Anthony show. That sucks. And now he's stuck with his bad nickname, stinky. But I got to, in all fairness for the kid, he doesn't stink anymore. You know, we don't have much time in between breaks to take leaks. When we go in there, it's a two second leak and all of a sudden you just smelt crunch. We told everybody no crunching in that bathroom. No crunching. I think it was the homeless guy. Really? Yeah. Really? Really? You guys might remember Grey Wolf from the homeless shopping spree. Well, Keith, why didn't you bring Grey Wolf down here today? Now the homeless guy just crunched in the bathroom. That's what you smelled, Anthony. We were on the way to Tavern on the Green to get something to eat and we figured we'd stop in and say, get Grey Wolf in here. Let's ask him if he crunched in our bathroom. We took Grey Wolf to Tavern on the Green. We were on the way. Here comes Grey Wolf. I am so much better than I am special enough. Hey Grey Wolf, talk into the mic. Oh yeah, man. Hey, what's up, yo? Grey Wolf, everyone. How you doing? Hi, everybody. Hi, great. New York City. Yeah. I really appreciate you for being there for me, especially for some special people, which I want to mention some names if it's okay with the radio station. Why? What are these other fellow street peoples? No. No? I want to thank you, Dave, which you appreciate. That very beautiful gift you guys made possible for my Christmas. Thank you to every one of you. And thank you, Barbara, for appreciating the carousel. And to little Rocky, which he received a Furby and those few special gifts. That was on the Exxon Key. And the radio station of 102.7 made my Christmas really a special one. Thank you, everyone. All right, now, Grey Wolf. Yeah. How much fire water did you have today? Yeah. None. None? Not a drop. Let me tell you something. I'm smelling some booze. No, you must be smelling somebody else. Now, Grey Wolf. You must be smelling somebody else. Grey Wolf, how do you pay us back? Huh? You pay us back by... By playing a very beautiful song. No, you pay us back by taking the nastiest crunch in that... Did you crunch in that bathroom? Yes, I did. All right. Now we know where it came from. Homeless crunch. You went in there at night and you must have been out of your mind. Homeless crunch. Homeless crunch. Oh, God. I'm getting a little cramp on the back. Grey Wolf, what have you been eating? Rats? No. Cockroaches? Eat a buffalo. Leave her. She can't be yours. She can't be mine either. McDonald's with a garbage can? Yeah. What have you been eating? What have you been eating? What did you have in the past? I had beef tripe with white rice. Beef tripe? Yes. And a cow's stomach. Cow's stomach. And white rice. But it was delicious though. Yeah, well, we could smell it. Oh, jeez. I'll get a sprayed... Sprayed lice ball. Hey, you'd probably up to this. That was great. You were wonderful and I'm glad that we're not mentioning... What? What are you... What is he showing us? That girl that showed her to him specially. We brought her all the way to the hospital. And she was like, oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

I have one song that I want to play for my little girl. All right. It's OK. I want to do it on the air. Sure. It's something that was done for Michael Jordan in the movie Space Jam that we saw together. Yeah. I believe I can fly. I believe I can fly as played. Hold on. I'm not jumping out the window. I'm going to your steering wheel, kids, on the hand-carved wooden flute thing. That gray wolf is a plane. I'm going to do it on the flute. OK. I believe I can fly. Follow me. Because my wife knows I always cry when I talk about personal stuff. Can I pull it all back? Love you, Bob. Me too. And happy birthday, Ralph Caparelli. I love you. There you go.

They were always scheming with the guys in F-Trope to make some money. I don't know what his name was when the chief came out. He says, what should we call ourselves? Where the heck are we?

I keep it real in my hand when it's close. Right. Gray wolf, do you have the gay hand? Let's see if you have the gay hand. I've been around. Hold your hand up like this. No, that's not a gay hand. My pinkie kind of separates from all the other ones. And I will not choose my other hand. Yes, of course. You're a wicked man. Why is there one on the floor? Oh, my God. He does a great show. I'm trying to take the show over. You two are talking. We do a great show. No, I'm not. I got an idea. We do a great show. I have an idea. Let's have gray wolf out of the studio.

Maybe. All right. That was almost as bad as yesterday. I went into the private bathroom there. Yeah. Where you need a key for it and stuff. Yeah. Remember how pissed I was? This is the worst. I don't understand what kind of slob does this. You go into a stall, right? You go into a stall and you're minding your own business. What do you do the first thing you do when you go into a stall? Sleep in the middle of the night. You have to look into the bowl, right? I look into the bowl. Just a mess. Like a crime scene. Yeah. And they got in flush. What the hell is that about? I hate that. What, Ben? You came in so pissed off. I couldn't stop laughing at you. You were so pissed. And then I'm like, I was so pissed. And I'm like, you know what? I'm not flushing it either. I want other people to be as pissed as I was. No, not my own whatever, but that stall. I'm like, I ain't flushing that stall either. Yeah. Jesus. All right. That is pretty bad. You're walking in like, oh, God, Dan. It's just an image that's stuck in your head. That's horrible. All right. Yeah, we got to take a break. All the phone calls suck, so everyone hang up. We're going to have to get back to work. We're going to have to get back to work. We're going to have to get back to work. We're going to have to get back to work.

As the chairman of the board might say, Opie and Anthony, you are two groovy cats. I love you, baby. You knock me out. Wonderful, marvelous, beautiful, cuckoo. Wonderful, marvelous. You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now. Please, Opie and Anthony, show. Thank you. 1027-WNEW. 212-757-1027 if you have anything to add to this mess today. Hey, do you want to get in more trouble? Do we have to? Why, why? I got the new Metallica song. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. Cool. Every radio station in America try to get a copy of this damn thing. I got it. I can't be hearing it. Yeah? OK. Ben, what's the deal on this song? It's from the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack. No one has this hand. No one. Really? The station that should have this, they don't have the balls to play it. Yeah, I don't doubt it. We're still getting trouble. Mm-hmm. We really don't care, so. All right, let's jam the new Metallica. Thanks for that, man. You're welcome. Thanks for the new Metallica. All right, let's jam the new Metallica. Thanks for that, man. That was needed. What's it called? It's called I Disappear, for Mission Impossible 2. Oh. Pretty much no one has this in the entire country. I'd like to hear some new Metallica. You're hearing it first on the Opie and Anthony show on WNAW, the rock and roll talk show that it is, OK? Crank it up. Let's check it out together. I Disappear, Metallica. Metallica. 1027 WNAW. And there you have it, 1027 WNAW, the latest from Metallica. I Disappear, for the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack, a song that no one has played in the country. No one, no one, no one. Mm-hmm. Wow, everyone's saying the song sucks. Really? Yeah. A lot of people say that. You can't listen to a song once. You've got to let it grow on you, especially Metallica. Let's go to Alana. Alana. Hey, what's up? You didn't like the Metallica song? It sounds like all the other songs, man. Well, come on. It sounds like the Sandman song they have. Sandman song. Well. Sounds like a real Metallica aficionado. It's a little different than that, but all right. Well, we thought we'd share with you. Smash or trash, what is it? All right, thank you, Alana. Let's go to John. John, what's going on? Hey, what's up? You didn't like it, huh? I think it sucks as much as Mission Impossible 1. I don't even know why they're making a Mission Impossible 2. Well, people say it, I think. Sequels never work. Except for like Austin Powers. I don't buy Tom Cruise as like a good actor. Everybody like, oh, they go crazy over the guy. They say like he's a good actor and stuff. I don't know. I think the girls go to see him because he's Tom Cruise. But as far as like action thing, like Mission Impossible, I don't know. I'm not buying it. I didn't see Mission Impossible. You didn't? No, I had no desire. It was OK. I'm not going to say it sucked. Was it so good that they needed to make a follow up? You know, might be cool to say. Yeah. I think. OK. I think. All right. I'm trying to fix my mic. Don't mind me. No one liked the Metallica song. Rob, what's up? That song really sucked, really bad. That's too bad. Usually movie soundtracks blow anyway. If you guys hadn't told me it was a new song, I wouldn't even have known because it sounds like all their other recycled junk. Well, it might be an outtake from one of their last albums or something, you know? That song really worked for my nuts too. It makes a good point too. A lot of these soundtracks, a lot of the rock soundtracks, they're never good. Yeah. So can I come down and hang out and drink some beer or something like that? No. Today would not be a good day. Why? What's the big deal? What's going on now? Put it this way. You'll probably walk in the door, trip on the doorway, fall down, split your mouth open, and sue us both. I turned on late. What's the big deal? What's going on? Why are you guys in such trouble? We're not in trouble. No. You said it before. You said you're in trouble. I owe a lot of money that I didn't think I owed, and Ann had a court appearance today. Sounds fun. Thank you. Oh, nice. All right. So stay out of court. All right. Thanks. Bye. All right. Oh, shut up. That hurt my ears. No one liked the Metallica song, Anthony. All right. All right. The song is gay Metallica. Metallica song blows. We tried. Metallica song is crap. All right. We tried. Anthony, guess whose birthday it is today? Hope. Our favorite person. Favorite person. Let me think. Bob Hope. Bob Hope. Bob Hope. No. Rosie. No. No. Whose birthday? How old is this person? I really don't even know. I'm assuming 31 maybe. Yeah. Somewhere around there. Maybe the big 3-0. Yeah. Need a hint? Yeah. Oh, oh. Virgin. No. No, no, Scott's out. She's not a virgin. Celine. She dates, she's married to someone as old as you, matter of fact. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I know. Yeah. She gets to hear that lip smacking. Yeah. From both places. Yeah. Now Celine Dion's birthday today, Anthony. Really? Yes. And she's, I don't know, 30, 31-ish. They didn't even print their age? No. Does anyone know how old Celine Dion is? Look at freaking Grey Wolf. I thought we got rid of him. What's she getting for her birthday? Grey Wolf, get in here. No, don't get him in here. I'm going to get him in here. I'm going to get him in here. I'm going to get him in here. I'm going to get him in here. I'm going to get him in here. Huh? I want... Whoa! Where? Ah! What's she getting? I was going to get him in here. He was going to do Celine Dion. And I was trying to do it with the flute. Oh, can you do it? Yeah, let's hear your... Let's hear your titanic... Play along. I sound like Ziggy. I can't do this. That was good. I'm out of here. Okay. That would be a good idea. I'll put it in the Oh! What is that? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! No! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! No! Thank you. Thanks. That was worth interrupting our bit for. That's great. No engines died on the Titanic. Don't worry. Anyway, Anthony, Celine Dion's 31st birthday today. Celine is 32. Someone is saying it online too. I am 32 years old. 32. And I am still trying to get pregnant with my husband who is 85. In my 32 year old womb, my eggs sit. Sit stranded in my womb much like the Titanic. Sitting there waiting for my husband's dead sperm to slam into the egg like the iceberg into the mighty Titanic. Celine blow out the candles with her gaping camel toe. I am here, Celine Dion. Where are you? Whoa! Whoa! Anyway, yeah. Anthony, there is an interesting quote from Celine Dion in the post today as well. Check this out. Okay. Please try to control your laughter. Celine Dion says, and I quote, I have my mom's lips. Yeah! And she has no lips. But I am a great kisser anyway. Wait a minute. That's a quote from her? Yeah. I have my mom's lips and she has no lips. Celine, believe me. You have lips. We see them through that jumpsuit. You may not have lips on top, but you look like you have black man lips in your pants. You may not have them on top, but you sure have them down below. I must take off my panties. She has a mother's lips, a sister's, everybody else. They are all down there in my huge camel toe. Happy birthday to me. My huge camel toe. I don't have lips on my face because I have more than ample lips down on my toe. Mom's small. My lips are so small. Happy birthday. They made me a big cake in the shape of a camel toe. And I slice into it. I'm cranking now. I'm getting pretty good at that song. So there you have it. Is that the best quote though? Happy birthday. Once again, Celine Dion. I have my mom's lips and she has no lips. They are huge. They are like Amadou Diallo in my pants. You ever see Amadou Diallo's lips? No, Abner Louima. I'm sorry. I always get them confused. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. Hey, an old friend is on line 6, Anthony. Who? Stockbroker Dave. Maybe he could give us some insight. Jesus Christ. Tom from Connecticut. Let me get some feedback. Celine looks like Mick Jagger down below. Mick Jagger is sleeping. Yo, yo, yo. God damn it. It's been a long time. What's up, boys? They just mop up the floor. I'm dumping out of any more remarks like that, Dave. I'm in intense litigation and you're going to get me killed. Why? I have a perfect plan. No, no, no, Dave. Please. Don't even joke. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. How about you, O? What's the matter with you? I just got a certain agency, $19,000 and I don't have it. Oh, man. Can I have a loan date? Of course. I knew you'd say yes. Of course. You know that, my brother. Dave, I know you're on the floor with the New York Stock Exchange and stuff, but what's up with NASDAQ? NASDAQ it. If it gets here tomorrow, buy it with your eyes closed. You've got another 3-4 percent. That's it. What? You've got another 3-4 percent correction. Correction, yeah. Well, that's what you know. What, you think it's going to go off forever? No, but every time it went down in the past four effing days, I'm buying. It's got to go up tomorrow. I'll buy more today. It's got to go up tomorrow. I'll buy more today. It should hit $4,200 and that's the bottom. God, that thing hits $5,000 and then tanks. Yeah. It's amazing. Things that go up come down. Yeah. How about on outflow? Are you doing anything there? Real stocks? Oh, the real stocks? The real stocks? No, I don't think I have one thing. Well, if the stock exchange... I'm doing my Mexican landscape. That's what I do. Hey, Mr. L.B., I love Nasdaq. What am I going to do? Watch one of those stocks from 50 years ago move 16th every day? What about my investments? We're maturing by the day. Hor up, hor up. Hor up, look at me. I'm in my brooch here. Look, I was up 16th in the sweet. Hor up, hor up. Yeah, that's too boring for a hand. I want to punch that thing up and go, oh no, it's down 50 points today. And then, oh good, it's up 75 today. And like seeing spikes like icicles. Yeah, I want that thing looking like aliens' teeth. I want the chart looking like the aliens' teeth. So when are you going to come down to the floor and visit us? I don't have time. I'm trading while you're on the floor. I'd go crazy. I'd be looking at the board going, ah! Yeah, you got a computer, Dave? Can you hook them up at a booth or something? Of course. I need something where I can trade wireless over like a Palm Pilot. Can you do that? Of course. Yeah, see I need that. I've got to trade while I'm driving. You can be trading right now, eh? Yeah, I know, after hours. Believe me, I'm hooked up. Dave, the funny thing is he does. I'm hooked up. I don't like after hours, though. No, but he's trading during the show every day now. Good opportunities after hours. Oh yeah. Well, we've got to see what happens tomorrow. It's Friday. I'm looking for a good NASDAQ rally tomorrow. I hope so. Come on. Are we going to have a straight week? I think so. Of crap? We should get here, but get ready to buy tomorrow. So what are you up to doing, boys? We're hanging in there. We're miserable today. Why? No, both of you. It sounds like... Well, we both got, I don't know, bad news today. Yeah. What can we do to make you happy? I was in the court of law today. Yeah. I was having lawyers talk to each other about my life. It's real fun. That's a picture. You know what's the matter with the Cadillac going over a cliff with four lawyers in it? The Cadillac? Five. I think you said F in scumbag. I started to, but I realized I was on the air. Oh yeah, what, did you leave the K out? Same word, pal. I'm sick of lawyers. I left the C out. I am sick of lawyers. Yeah, well. I got a nice, at least... I don't even know how long I got them in my life now. You got them till the day you die, buddy boy. At least the wife's is good to look at. She came walking in that courtroom. I'm like, that's strategy. The hell is this chick? That's strategy. I don't know. You think? Oh yeah. I'm just thinking it might backfire. It was an old judge, right? No, but it's a woman judge. I think you look at a woman judge, we're looking at an attractive girl, I'm going to be all pissed off at. Yeah. Get it out or she wants to shove it so far up your ass it comes out your tongue. Yeah, believe me. I'm feeling a little throat pain. You just saw how Ann walked in here today. Oh my God. I had to whisper to everyone, guys, Anthony had a really bad day. I needed the roid pillow that you sit on your chair with because I was reamed out so hard today. I turned on some Yanni in the office just to keep the soothing music in the background. We didn't want any problems with the head. He was ready to snap. Oh my word. Hope, you're such a good buddy. Yeah. I don't know what Dominic's doing over there. Hey, you ever been to a courtroom? You're attractive. You're hired. It was funny because I'm like helping out Ann today, trying to be there for him. And then during the show I get a call from home that there was a big envelope there with a huge bill. Taxes? Taxes. Wow, he doesn't want to be too specific. Yeah. 19 grand. Wow. Huh. I'm here, my friend, if you need it. Yeah. You know that. How are all the boys, man? How's Bowen, everyone? Everybody's asking about you, wanting to come see you. When are we going to get some of those fine steaks again? When are we going to go to the Devil Playoffs game? Lugers. We want to go to Lugers. Okay, cool. You think we may get Bow to pay for it again? Nah, we owe him one. That wouldn't be cool. I'll owe him today. Opie, please, can you please not be talking like we're going to pay for anything? Not after today. I can't pay. I'll take you through the drive-through of McDonald's, baby, as long as you get a happy meal. If we get really good steak sauce, you won't know the difference. How's Rick doing? He's on vacation. Yeah? Yeah. He's on vacation every month, it seems like. Well, he F'd us, too, which is another problem we're having, but Hope's a little angry with Rick at the time being. It's just been a cluster F of a couple of days. Oh, man, I feel so bad for you. What's the matter, Opie? Are you sweating? I am sweating. All the time you're sweating. I had a tough day. I need a stitch in my thumb. I'm almost convinced of that. You were smashing stuff, and I ripped open my thumb. The one on the palm's not bad anymore, but... Oh, man. You missed some fun activity before 4 o'clock, Dave. I know, I heard. That's where all the action was. I heard. Did you have Lesbians in a bathtub or something? Yeah. Oh, we did that a while ago, yeah. Yeah, we're going to do that again maybe as soon as next week. Could I come? Of course you can. You are more than well. You know you have an open invite to this show. I got to come. Everyone wants to come see your show, also. All the boys on the floor with the big box. Hey, the old boss is gone. Now you're allowed to come back. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Hey, the old boss is gone. Now you're allowed to come back. Dick. Yeah. You're still a dick. Just don't say his name. No, because he's another guy that wants a piece of our action. That's all we need. Hit me. Who's going to be the lucky millionth person to be in litigation with us? Dave, let me tell you something. There are so many... Oh, never mind. I've got a man for Britain, huh? We've got a few problems. Let's just put it that way. It's insane. I don't understand this anymore. That's why I said I'm going back to Apollo Air Conditioning. We have a talent. I swear to God. I'm going to swing. I'm going to hammer. Counting Anthony's problem, we got three? That's a good one. We got at least three pending and more on the way. We were much happier when we were making nothing, right guys? Someone sent me magazine subscriptions. Lots of bongos, lots of beers, nobody bothered us. They're mad. It barely had to work. Nobody cared. Dave, I said it earlier. My best job ever was when I was a caddy. No worries in the world. Lots of tax-free money. Lots of booze at night. It was great. Damn. All right, boys. All right, Dave. Good to hear from you again. Say hi to the family. Always a pleasure. Hey, can I say hi to my kids? They're probably listening. Really? You let them listen to this? Of course. What are you, crazy? Jamie and Jake, I love them with all my heart. We're going to come down to the floor when we can ring the opening bell. I hope so. I don't have Opie and Anthony wow hats and throw them out all happy. Do you know what the funniest thing is when they ring the opening bell? Yeah. And the futures are down and you know the market is going to open in a real crappy situation. Get your crash helmets on. And they're all smiling and having fun ringing the bell. It's like everything is going to tank. What are you so happy for? Fair value is way down. Give me a break here. What are you so happy about throwing your little hats to the crowd? Bastards. We want to ring the bell. Come on down. Make it work. Come on down. We're out of the area. Cool, Dave. All right boys. Be well. All right, Dave. Keep in touch. Cool. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye old buddy. Stockbroker diff. Yeah. Huh? We're just running for the show, recording destitute show. Easy. We'll make a comeback just like the market. We'll make a comeback. Is that it? Maybe we're coinciding with the Nasdaq, Opie. We'll make a comeback. We're tanking. This isn't the big crash. No, it's a correction. This is an Opie and Anthony correction. It's an Opie and Anthony correction. It's not the big crash, no. We need the people on CNBC to talk about it. It's just a correction Opie and Anthony are having. You notice they've been on a pretty good upswing lately and well it's got to come down eventually. A lot of people saying they're overvalued. Yeah, a lot of people have said that. There's been a sell-off. A lot of people have said that one. People are going into the more traditional stocks. Blue chips are taking off, Opie and Anthony. They're correcting. I think they'll rebound. Or at least have one of those dead cat bounces. All the other shows on this market, like the blue chips. Yeah, real conservative. They don't move up and down too much. What do we like Anthony? We're spiky. We're like eBay. We're like eBay. Oh my God. No, CD Now. There is some really poor shit. Oh boy. You look at the chart on CD Now, that would be a fun water slide. That's about it. Everybody in the room. That would be exciting. Yeah. It's like the last dip on that lost world ride. Oh my God. Okay, we're all right. Yes, we are. I think. We'll be back. You guys sometimes have fun. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you when we're back. Thank you. We'll see you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. You guys sometimes like piss me off, okay? 1027WNEW I'm on the... Alright, hold on, hold on. Ant, talk. Hey, what's up? So what did he say? It's the, uh, Amos and Andy show.

Don't worry about me. Ah, don't worry about it. He was with another client. This is a little more important than the other client, don't you think? Yes, absolutely. I agree with you. Uh, screw Anthony. It's not about Anthony this time. What about me? What about me? Hey, Hope. He's in that much trouble, Ant? Shut up. It's the buttocks. I'm listening to you. Go ahead. Dude, please. He's trying to goof on me like I'm in more trouble. I'm like the guy who has life that kills the guard. It's like, who cares at this point? Give me a break. Sam, what does it... What does he mean by don't worry? Don't worry. Is it don't worry or... Don't worry. Or is it don't worry? I hate when people say don't worry when they... It's your life. No, I hate when people say don't worry before they even look at the problem. Oh, that's not good. Call him up. Call him right now. I'm thinking worry. This has been a cloud, a black cloud hanging over the show. He's not panicking because, you know, it's not his money. Right. It's not him. He's not panicking. He doesn't have the right to check. Am I right? He'll handle it. Did he look at it at all? No. He didn't look at it and he said don't worry? Yeah. I hate when people do that. Oh my God. Can you talk to Anthony? Oh, no. Oh, no. You want to talk to Anthony? Why? Oh, God. I'm getting a phone. Jesus Christ. She's got a message for you now. Oh, my God. I'll be on the radio and you can talk on the phone. All right, so see you at the end of the show. 2127571027. What a mess of a day this has been. Yeah. Ann is now talking to... Oh, really? Ann. At some point I'll probably get the same letter. Make that a quadruple. But it'll go to my account. That'll end up in the shredder along with your clothes. It'll end up the same place your clothes ended up at. Yeah, there'll be a very important letter in the Goodwill bin. That's good. That's great. With your $1,500 mountain bike and all your clothes. What did he say? Don't worry about it? I hate when people say don't worry about it. You should have saw how big this package was according to Sandy. Great. All right. That's good. That's good. Hey, does the ex-spouse have to pick up the debt also? Like, do they split half the debt? Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. Hey, wait a minute. That was a joint account. Oops, sorry. Sorry. Oh, that was a joint return. Oh, guess who's liable for that? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, guess who's liable for half of that? Geez, how about that? Hey, great. Might have scored a good one. How does the I hope it's twice as much. How does this turn out to be good news for Anthony? It's horrible news for me. It's good news for Anthony if he's going to get the same thing I got today. Half. I'm only liable for half of that, my friend. All right, let me see. You know something, though? Some way? It ain't going to work out that way. I know it. I'm not delusional. All right, Sandy, here's Opie back on the phone. Please hold. Thank you. No, I don't think anyone's listening to our radio show anymore today. No, everybody probably dumped out very early in the day when we were very angry and breaking things. You have to tell me one more thing. Okay. I don't know. Our show is way too funny. Gee, thanks. Good. What do you find funny about this show today? Everything. Is it the wacky bit that we're doing that we're financially destitute? Yeah, that's a black riot scream a minute. She thinks we're real funny today, Ann. Oh, yeah. That's good. How's the job search today? Oh, my God! Oh, nothing, sweets. Nothing. I'm just happy that you're enjoying our pain today. Okay. Okay, terrific. It's very funny? Okay. Oh, you like to sling the... Okay. Your mom was laughing. That's... Okay. Let's make the 50-year-old ladies laugh today. That's good. Okay. All right. Okay. Oh, my brother's there? Okay. Tell him I said hi. Okay. Tell him I need some money. Yeah. Who doesn't? What? Stop laughing. She's laughing? That's great. All right. I'll try to do that. Oh, my God. Okay. All right. Okay. That's great. Okay. Don't spend any money. All right. Bye. Oh, I think... Wear a laugh. I had a laugh ride today. I'm in the same boat. I'm in the same boat, huh? That's what... Yeah, she was saying. Without giving out too many details, yeah. So your day just got worse. A little more expensive. How could your day get worse? Can you believe it? This is probably... This is like... It's Black Thursday for us. I'm ready to jump out the window. What? Oh, my God. This is like when the stock market crashed in the 30s. 29. Whatever the hell that was. I'll go as far back as October 88. Yeah. This is awful. I'm probably going to get the same letter. Yeah. Yeah, that's what you just said. Okay. Very good. That's nice. But the problem is you're never going to see the letter. I have a change of address in there. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I have a change of address in. I have a change of address in. Yeah. Well, it would screw her too, so she's got to realize that. Oh, now we got people that don't even know who... All right. Get them out of here. He's a psycho. Who upstaged... You know something? Holy cow. This is amazing that people are walking into this goddamn studio. Anthony, go grab him. I'll grab him. Be nice to him, though. What am I going to do? I'll get him. Just politely throw him out the door. How the hell did he get down here? How did he get in here? He said he snuck in the back way. He snuck in the back way? He snuck in the back way. Our doors are supposedly open. There's wide open. What doors? The doors upstairs. This isn't a radio station. Just say, everybody, come on in. All the doors are open. You got in through the door. All right. What do you mean all the doors are open? Up front? You mean you can walk right into... You can walk right in. Okay. Yeah. Well, come on in, everybody. Just walk up into one of the doors. Okay. Well, come on in, everybody. Just walk up into wins and steal whatever you want. Go ahead. Come in here and punch us in the face. You'll do us a favor today. It's no one's fault except security, I guess. Walk right in. There is no security at this place. I see right here by the studio. Mark comes out and says, what are you doing here? The guy goes, oh, I walked right in. I want to check out the show. That guy. That guy looked like he was freaking possessed. Yeah. We go to K-Rock. It's like going onto an LL flight. Why are you guys laughing? This is serious crap. You can't get in there. You can't get in there. You can't get in there. Why are you guys laughing? This is serious crap. You can't get in that place. There's metal detectors. I have said this is, compared to K-Rock, we have terrible security for a long time. K-Rock is like Sing Sing. K-Rock is like Fort Knox. We're like nothing. We're crap. They're hoping someone bumps us off at this point. So we're in hope. That guy's a total whacko. He's like, I want to be open and handy. I walk right in. Great. Great. I saw him. I was wondering who the hell he was. I thought he was one of PR's friends. That's great. That guy looked like a serious man. That guy's a psycho. That's great. My heart stopped. What a psychopath mother ever. Can we talk to somebody about this? I mean, seriously. We've got to stop. It's been a joke and stuff. We've goofed about it in the past. What the f- You want to hear what he says? He goes, I just passed the fire department test. I just wanted to come by and congratulate Opia and have them congratulate me for doing it. He just walks in. Walks through the test floor. Can we get some type of friggin' system here that they keep the doors locked at least? Dude, this is- This is bad news, man. Unbelievable. You guys have been to K-Rock and seen their setup over there, right? Oh my god, you can't even walk in that place. We were there when we were interviewing. Sure. Fort Knox. You can't even get in the front door. You can't get front door. You walk out of the elevator. That's it. You're done. You're done. You can walk space. You can walk right into the studio. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. How many locked doors are between here and the studio? Three. Three. Supposed to be three. They're all open. Oh, wonderful. Great. That means he got through this door over here and you got through the coding. How did he get through that? Yeah, how did he get through that? I don't know. Oh, find out later. No, you know, I haven't figured out. The other door to go towards our offices has been broken, so maybe he went through there and then cut through John's area and then came around. No. Someone opened the door. Who the hell opened the door? And no one questioned him. That's all. You know something? Look at that. You. This is out of control. I thought he was, because I said dispatching, I go, who the hell is that guy out there? Next time you're going to come in. I thought it was one of your friends. Out of control. Yeah. Out of control. PR, did you let him in by accident? No. All right. Dude, it happens all the time. People upstairs don't know who's who down on this floor. It happens all the time. How many times have we talked about this? Well, now I'm really pissed about this. We still have. If somebody Fs up upstairs, I want him fired. We still have a bunch of people that are incompetent that work for this radio station. That's all I'm going to say. Incompetent. There's not many left, but there are a couple of holdouts. They still think it's 1972 and there's a bunch of old boring jocks on the radio. Virgin coming. Where's Virgin coming? God. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Ridiculous. Harold's out there with the nightstick. We'll probably let him in. This is the goof station of Infinity Broadcasting. Welcome to NEW, the goof station. We'll throw some people on the air and goof. I was upstairs. I was upstairs. Oh, who's this? Who's this? Uh-oh. Someone's getting in trouble. Ben's going with some guy in a suit. Who's in the suit? What's he yelling at Ben for? He said, I was upstairs. I'm going to clarify this right now with you. He's pissed. He's pissed? We just had a serial killer ten feet from us. He was the guy who was upstairs at the time. Well, why did he let somebody down here? He's about to clarify with Ben. There's no clarifying it. That can't happen. He's pissed. Who is this guy? I put my application for security here. Well, what does he do? Hold on. Someone go get our... What? What does he control? All right, listen. No, seriously. Not locked doors. Seriously. Seriously. Listen, someone immediately go down and get our new boss to go upstairs for that meeting. Yeah. Because he needs to be in on that if he's still here and he has the ability. No ifs, ands, buts, or excuses for sending somebody down here that doesn't have the proper credentials or authority to be down here. The right side of his chest. It doesn't matter what he said while he was at the desk upstairs at reception. All right, listen. I'm scared. We have 35 minutes left in the show and the odds are pretty good someone is going to get punched in the face. If I was you, I would not leave. No. Right? This is going to be unbelievable. I don't know what the hell is going on on the show today, but in fact you're crazy. Turn the tile because that tension is mounting. God damn. Kevin, what's going on? Hey, what's happening? I was just downstairs with you guys outside your studio doors and I guess I shouldn't have been there so easily, but I was in the city today. I'm sitting outside your building now on the stope here. I took the physical exam for the fire department of New York and it was pretty tight because I got a hundred on it. Good God. So I thought I'd come down and see if I could get a little word out in the air to hear the other firefighters in the city who are friends of mine and help me, give me the encouragement to take the test and stuff. Well, you don't understand. You know something? You might be the nicest guy in the world, but there is no way they should have let you in this studio. No one let me in. The doors are open. I just kind of walked in. Well, there's no way the doors should be open. What door did you walk into? How did you get in here? I walked in. There was a door near the desk. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What floor did you get off of? I got off on the 10th floor. 10th floor up at when? Okay. There's a big glass door, right? Yeah. How did you get through that? That was open. I just. Open. Was anybody at the desk? No. No. All right. Door unlocked. No one at the desk. So that's the first door that's unlocked. There's three locked doors between the outside and our radio. So you walked down the stairs. Yeah, I walked down the stairs. And now there's another. There's two locked doors, one to the right, one to the left. Then what did you do? Somebody walked in and I followed them through the door to the left. Followed them through the door to the. Who? Who? Wasn't me. What did he look like? What did he look like? I think he had short hair and I didn't get a look at his face. I don't know how it worked. I just kind of carried the damn thing around. Was it you, Stinky? Yeah, I saw him. Are you kidding me? You might have had a baseball cap. I saw him standing by the door. Stinky. Wait, wait, wait. Baseball cap. This is not good for you. This is very not good for you. It's not yet. No, it's Stinky. Stinky's fessing to it, which is good. It's very honorable and it's good that you come forward. I went to put something in your guy's office. I came back and he was standing in. He followed you through one of the doors. With the lunch table. Yeah, and then there was a room with a couch and a couple guys hanging out there. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Is Stinky's mic on? Yes. Yeah. Okay, and what did you do, Stinky? You opened the door. I went through the door. He turned his back. I went to close the door and then I ran up here and he must have just before it closed because I tried to make sure. To your defense, he shouldn't have even been there in the first place to get through the upstairs door. But did you look at him and recognize him or anything? No, that's why right when I saw him standing here I went over to Mark and I asked him who he was. Very good. Okay, then you did it. Now, obviously there was a little slip up with you letting somebody through the door. I'm very sorry. But, like I said, to your defense, the guy shouldn't have even been down here. Someone's got to do something. Why isn't that door locked? Why isn't that door upstairs locked? I don't know. I didn't mean to cause everyone to panic down there. Everyone kind of got up in alarm to get me out of there as fast as they could, but I apologize for that. That's what we needed. And Kevin, if you're a faithfulist in the show, we apologize for treating you like that. No, that's okay. I mean, I know who you were and you looked a little kooky to be honest with you. Oh, did I? Just a little. That's cool, I guess. Did you carry all those hoses up the six flights of stairs and stuff? Yeah, well not today. That's another task, hopefully. But yeah, I was hoping I could come down and just hang out and watch how you guys do your show from that couch room where everyone kind of eats and stuff. He saw everything. I have a blueprint of the place. Yeah, right? I mean, if that's cool. I mean, right now I'm sitting outside your stove near, I don't even know where I am, but... Your scope, your elevator door. Great, better move. All right, Kevin, we overreacted. We apologized. That's cool. It had nothing to do with you, but there's a problem in our system here. Definitely a slip-up, a breach in security. Yeah, some of the tech pilots... Zips in the wire, zips in the wire. I don't know, what are we going to do with Kevin now? Now I feel bad. Snake and Nate, my paws. Well, we do have a cop here. Can you frisk him? No, I got nothing but a wire on the key that's on my phone. All right, we got a cop here. Kevin, come back up to the 10th floor. Do not walk in any doors. We'll come get you. We're going to frisk you, and sure, you can come down and hang. All right, cool, man. Thanks. But please don't do that again. Okay. We don't encourage anyone just to walk in on our show. That gave us a heart attack. Unbelievable. Unless, of course, they have huge cans. All right? All right, I'll be up in that later. Like if it was a chicken, it'd be like, hey, good thing she made it in. Hey, this is great. Come on in. We got huge cans. We won't even frisk you. We're just like, go on, go on, go on. Well, frisk her. Don't bring weapons, but torpedoes are fun. All right, and unbelievable. And now where's Ben? He's getting yelled at. No, you know something? If he's getting yelled at, I'm pissed. Because Ben should not be getting yelled at at all. Someone go check on Ben. Let's see what's going on with there. Upstairs at Winds, I'll tell you something. We're a brother and sister station, but those mother... They, at the drop of a hat, at the drop of a hat, they will bitch us out for having some of our guests in their waiting room. You know, oh my goodness, there's a girl here with tattoos. And she's been in the waiting room for an hour. We're a legitimate news organization. Yet they let every friggin' kook in that doesn't have any reason to be in here. I'm sick of it. Like their listeners are just knocking down the door to go check out the 1010 Winds guys. We're trying to get traffic on the ones, and there's a girl out there with tattoos. Give me a break. Oh, Anthony, just when you thought today couldn't get any worse... I swear to you, this is just amazing. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is just amazing. Okay, hold. Okay, go ahead. Because I'm just waiting here. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. From the law offices, blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah. We just got a fax. Oh, it's Isaac. Let me see. I swear to you. No, I'll just show you the letterhead. Turn it around. Letterhead. Okay. All right. Show that to me better. It's legit, too. You'll know in a sec. Okay. Okay, there's the letterhead. Wow. Seems like a pussy radio station that will remain nameless, tattled on us about playing the Metallica song. From the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack that our listeners thought sucked. Yeah. Oh, gosh. Remember I said no one in the country is allowed to play it? Right. So I'm sure those guys over at the other station quickly got on their phones to tattle on us. Yes. They just suck. Sir or Madam, the firm represents Hollywood Records, the copyright owner of the forthcoming Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack album. The album contains a master recording by Metallica of the musical composition I Disappear and a master recording by Limp Bizkit entitled Mission Impossible 2 Theme. Neither of the masters have been released for broadcast. Okay. It has come to Hollywood's attention that you have been broadcasting either or both of the masters. Okay, terrific. Without our client's authorization. Hey. It has come to our attention that means someone tattled on your pals, Opie and Anthony. Whoa. Because Hollywood has not granted permission for such performance by you and the masters have not been released, such performance violates the relevant provisions of Title 17 of the United States Code and may subject you to other actionable... Oh, legal talk. Under relevant federal and state law. Oh, my God. I just felt money fly out of my pockets when you were saying that. That's amazing. You don't have no money to work. Hollywood hereby demands that you immediately cease and desist from any further broadcast of the masters. Our client intends to hold you fully liable. Whoa. To the full extent of the law for any unauthorized broadcast of the masters. But we're just a goofy radio show. How does this happen? At this point we have no money left, trust me. Don't even bother. What happened to the fun? Does anyone remember laughter? What happened to the fun, Opie? Wow. Well, there you go. Very truly yours, douche. Douche, douche, douche, and douche. We have been ordered to stop playing the Metallica song. Oh, well. It wasn't that good anyway. Well, the listeners didn't like it, so... Oops. Right on. Hey, what was in the CD player? Hey, terrific. Whoops. Wow. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that was in the CD player. Jeez, man. Well, we should be allowed to play it shortly, right? Yeah. When it comes out? Oh, yeah. So I guess we should probably put it in a safe place where it will be readily available. But we are legally allowed to play this CD because, you know, you've got to abide by the rules. If they say we shouldn't play the CD, we shouldn't. Right. But... I agree. But when that date comes out and every station around the country can play it, we ought to have it readily available in a safe place so we can pull it out and play it. Opie, if you could please file away. I know sometimes a file cabinet throws off some flak when you open it. That's why you're wearing your safety goggles. Of course. What? We have the... We have the Metallica that we've been banned from playing until it's legally... Yes. Legally. So with that, Anthony, let me just... Correct the player. Okay, file that away with your safety goggles on. Over here, right? Yeah, right in the usual place. Right next to all the most offensive songs? Yeah. That we cherish for the most offensive song content? Right next to the CD from the guy that sings like Elvis, the other dead artist, like Elvis. Remember him? Sure, Anthony. Right next to We Deliver Keggers. Okay. You got it? It's ready. Put the mic by the file cabinet. Oh my God! Oh my God! The Enola Gay! That is ruling out the runway! The Enola Gay! I need another band-aid. Oh my God! And in goes the glorious B29! Oh my God! Oh my God, that's a good one! Oh my God, that's a good one! runway. You know the gay, Harold Emmett and his men ascending to the sky with the implement of destruction in her belly. I need another band-aid. Oh my God. Here she goes. A glorious B29. What a mess. Do you know how much crap we have broken today? A lot of stuff today. We have a lot of tension to get out of our systems. I think it's healthy. Excuse me. Unbelievable. We've got people just coming in the studio out of nowhere. We're getting letters from lawyers that we can't play records. At this point, that's a joke. Don't play that. Oh, I'm scared. Wow, this is the biggest legal matter I've had to deal with. I can't play a song. Trust me, we weren't going to play it again. Yeah, it wasn't that good. Being a huge Metallica fan. Ben's going to yell that still? Why? Is our boss here? Where's our boss? Back him up. The only assistant PD is here. What's the guy upstairs bringing about? And why are they yelling at Ben? Somebody F'd up upstairs. It's the door upstairs. The guy is giving a demonstration of how somebody can get in. Through one door on the 10th floor, there's a demonstration. Will you demonstrate? That the door wasn't locked and someone got in. We should put it on the website so everyone can come through. Yeah, sure. Come on down. Come to the line. Yeah, thanks. Demonstrating. He acted perfectly. Unbelievable. Hey, let's take a break. Okay. And let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show. Oh my God. If we didn't give you guys material today, then F' you. Yeah. All right, we'll be back. Opie and Anthony. Fun for you guys. You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. Go take a mitle. One Opie seven. W-N-A-W. It's the Opie and Anthony show. Smashing pumpkins, huh? Yeah. I was jamming the new CD on the subway today. Oh yeah? Someone has my Black Crowes, Jimmy Page CD, J.Mora. Why are we sending J.Mora free CDs? Why are we sending him my free CDs? Smashing pumpkins, playing April 25th, Hammerstein Ballroom. KISS coming back to town, Anthony, with Ted Nugent. Jones Beach. Very cool. Okay. Okay. Is this their third farewell tour? Pretty much. They didn't milk enough money out of us yet. What do they got that commercial with that little girl from the Pepsi thing? You see that one, J.Mora and Kiss Make? Oh, did I see that? That's an example of someone's 15 minutes being way up. The little girl. The first commercial was like, okay, kind of cool, cute idea. We talked about the Pepsi commercials with that annoying little girl. The dimples. Now the latest one, she's in Kiss Makeup with Kiss. With Kiss. I'm just like, we saw last time they were here and they were here live in the studio. We spoke with them. Man, they know how to milk a buck. Unbelievable. That jeans, and maybe they could teach us. We need to start milking some heavy bugs. I hope so. Something tells me that's the only reason they got back together though. It was because they were probably in similar situations. As us? Yeah, I don't think they really liked each other very much. Let's start selling Opie and Anthony crap. Opie and Anthony Master Cards. Maybe we haven't been around long enough to... Can we break up and then have a reunion thing? That's not a bad idea. Let's just do it for like a day. Let's break up for a week. For a week and then we'll have a big, huge reunion show. Right. Are we going to do it with makeup or without? Because I know we show up at the station every day with makeup on. Oh yeah, it's very important that we wear makeup. What a mess. Alright. Well, let's play... What did we learn today? Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. There's a lot today. Wow. Real deal. Man junk from the city checking in, Anthony. Man junk. I learned that your security is as tight as a hooker's... Yeah. You know the word. Thank you. That was very good. Charles Manson also checking in from prison. Hey, Chuck. I learned that when I get out, I'm going to just walk right in and hang out on the Lesbo couch. Come on in. The Manson and Kaczynski morning show. Lizard from Wonton. Today I learned that Earl is as queer as a tennis helmet and schools in the Bronx have better security than 1027. They do. That's very good. Today I learned that not even a bed from Rockaway Bedding can ease the pain of losing half your stuff. Wow. Hey, come here. That was Royal from Jersey. You got that right. Let's see. Hank from Jersey. Today I learned that when it rains it pours and pours and pours. Have a drink of me, boys. Let's go to the phones and see what other people have learned, Anthony. Jason, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? Good. I learned today that after looking at his hands, Earl's gay. Terrific. Virgil. Yeah. Hey! We all took the gay test today. It's in the post. Are we sending that to unofficial Steve there? Foundrymusic.com. We're sending the Earl hand with the post article. I guess you can tell from your hand if you're gay or not. And we all took the test and Earl failed miserably. Yeah. His index finger is a lot shorter than his ring finger. Almost as short as his pinky. Which means you're gay, according to the post. And Psycho Mark failed the test as well. And I hope he's still interested in scalping your WrestleMania trip. Yeah. I've been told that would be a problem too. All right. No more trouble. All right. Thank you. Bye. All right. Let's go to John. John, what did you learn on the show today? I learned that from now on today ought to be taking the keys to Thursday. No doubt. You know, you guys need like a tuba KY just to make tomorrow's broadcast a little easier, man. Thank God it's a Friday. Yeah, tell me about it. I never imagined that the show was going to get worse. You're bringing everybody down. Now, I think... I just want to curl... Go ahead, sorry. I just want to curl up in the fetal position and go to my happy place. Yeah. Like laying close from the big chill and cry? Go to my happy place. Pretty much. That's what I'm going to do tonight in the shower. We'll make it easy, guys. All naked and stuff, fetal position with the warm water flowing down on my naked body. Did you ever imagine the show would get worse? Like we were in the office, they and I talking, we're buds obviously, and I'm like, come on in, we'll make something out of the show today. Yeah. You had a tough day. Had a rough one. I never thought I'd get the phone call that I owe 19 grand, and then on top of that we find out that Anskins sent me a letter. So on top of the crap he went through earlier, he's got to deal with what I'm dealing with. Nice. Because we're like twins when it comes to this crap. I know. And then we get it like a lawyer, you know, faxing us saying they're going to, I don't know, take legal actions because we played a horrible Metallica song. I can see that happening. What are you in for, man? Oh, we played a Metallica song. We weren't supposed to. You can do me in the rear now. Scott, what did you learn on the show today? Yeah, I learned that Opie's going to be in the next homeless shopping spree. Oh, very good. How old are you, Scott? You guys still don't remember me? I called about the sex ed question. Oh yeah. Wait, seventh grade? Six. Well, close enough. Six. Opie, you should remember his age. Sorry, I was going to guess 20, Scott. See, if it was 19, it would be easy. That's how many thousands of Opieos. All right. Thank you, Scott. And of course, it has to be geriatric for me to remember. Hey guys, that's syndication, lesbian fantasies now. All right. Thank you. See you. Wow, Hal from New York might have hit it on the head today. What? This just came in on Instant Feedback, Anthony. Check it out. I learned not to play baby raper with an infant in the studio because God will punish you on the air the next day. See? Oh man. Words to live by, Lloyd. Words to live by. That's a little weird if you think about it because yesterday it was really ugly at the end of the show. Yeah, what did I do? I was calling you an insensitive F. You were an accomplice because only God knows that you had time to come over here and shut that song off. All right. You can say what you want, but you know it's true. I kind of thought it was funny too. All right. Gary, what's going on? Hollywood records suck. Oh, hey, don't say that. They'll sue you. They'll sue you. All right. Thanks, Gary. Sue. Hello. You were playing our Metallica song and I'm very angry. I'm suing everybody. You're not supposed to play it until the movie comes out and the album comes out so people can buy it before they realize it blows monkey ass. Hey, Len. Play it again. I'll take your shoes and your glasses and 19 grand and half your stuff. Okay, thank you. Len, what did you learn on the show today? Today I learned that the new Metallicas is gay as Earl's hands. That's pretty good. You have any Yankee tickets? No, we don't. That sucks. Anyway, guys, sorry about today. No, you know something? I had fun. It brought Ant and I closer together. Not in a homo way but it just got us back on the same page. You know, what were we going to do? Something happens like that and you sit and what are you going to do? Sit at home and you sulk. We kind of, you know, blew it out, got it out there over the air, kind of vented. Oh, we have problems. I'm just trying to figure out what both of you could do to owe 19,000 each. Yeah, well. Yeah, believe me. You have been listening to this show for two years, haven't you? The plane that was supposed to bring the coke crashed right over the Florida Keys and we never covered the stash. So now the Colombians are so pissed that we have to pay them 19,000 each or we're going to get Columbia neckties. I did say it was a big package at home. Remember I said that earlier? Yeah. Because there was a horse head in the package. So if I see that pilot, he's dead. Thank you, Len. Have a good one. Bye. Let's go to Jimmy. Jimmy, you're next on WNEW. How are you, man? All right. Hey, Jimmy. Lawyers, suck hairy open man ass. Yeah, all right. That's number one. Number two. And number two, I'd just like to say thank God I was the only one that had a bad Thursday. Yeah. I was just going around, man, like syphilis. I can't imagine anyone had a worse day than us. Dude, we have two teeth eating a bagel this morning. I go for six grand in bridge work. Six grand. Okay. I'm a lineup from the IOS. Me a bag of shells, Norris. Me a bag of shells. Six grand in dental work. Wow. That's the right thing to be in. You guys should have been dentists. At least you have teeth. Yeah, that's true. All right. You know, you've got something for your cash. Teeth. That's true. One of the things we're doing on the show tomorrow, I challenge you guys, I guarantee there's not one person that listens to this show that had a worse day than us. Yeah. Today. That's pretty. If you've got a story, save it for tomorrow. Tomorrow. We'll do that. All right. Jimmy. Take it easy, man. All right. Let's go to Jay. Jay, you're next on WNAW. Hey, what's up, guys? Hey. Hey, I learned today that your security is about as tight as Celine Dion's lips. Hey, you guys. Jay, you rock. Hey, you guys might want to pick about putting some money into that Ventric Band football deal. Yes. Vince. That's a guarantee, right? Who picked that up, NBC? Yeah. Yeah. How about that, huh? Hey, if you're in with them, who knows? Have their stock through today. They must have went up with that, right? Thank you, Jay. You got it, guys. You rock. All right. Bye. Later. Let's go to Chris. Chris, you're next on NAW. How are you? Yo, what's up? Hey. Yo, I learned that K-Rush got a small index finger. You guys rock. Thank you, Chris. Be good. All right. Heywood from Yonkers. I learned Gray Wolf was the most wood. I know. I learned Gray Wolf was the most financially secure guy in the studio today. Yeah. At least he knows where his assets are, his flute and his little mojo pouch he wears. You guys come up with the best stuff, I'm telling you, man. You keep us going with your witty humor. Why, if I'm one half of flute, I'm going to sound very high. My saw in half, make piccolo. Hey, Matt. Hey, man. What's up? Yo, I learned today that Anthony got the most expensive boot shot today. Yeah. That's right. I could have flown to Vegas, gotten hummers from 20 hookers and flown around the world the other way to come home and it would still have been cheaper than the quick boob shot I saw off my wife's lawyer today. Hey, boy. You got suck. She was leaning over to tell my lawyer how she was going to suck me dry out of my cash and she leans over and I caught a quick up the shirt shot. This is the highlight of my day besides the guy having a heart attack two seats down. What about the heart attack guy? The guy had a heart attack right on the bench. He was sitting on one of the benches. He had a heart attack. You know what's so funny though? As I'm watching any money that I have anywhere disappear and the woman that's like my wife's lawyer responsible for taking care of this, even though everything is going down the crapper, I'm like, oh my God, oh, boob shot. Oh, this sucks. Oh, I can't say, hey, boob shot. She's pretty hot. I got to give her that much. All right. Well, I wasn't expecting that to walk in. I only hire the hot liars. Revenge, revenge for my 1995 appearance on the Stern show. Coming back at me 10 F and fold, man. Hey, Bob. You thought it was funny making fun of me. You thought it was funny on the E show. I couldn't fit in the elevator. Here it comes. That's some great obscure stuff. Oh my God. That's classic. Hey, Bob. Yo, Anthony. I learned today that it's cheaper to keep her. The principle of it. All right, Bob. Thank you. All right, man. Have a good one. We got to get out of here. Yeah. How do you do that? You know, something after you like gone through certain aspects of a divorce thing, the beginning phases where it's really getting, starting to get ugly. And then you're like, okay, oh, oh, keeper. And then you're like, hi, I'm living with the extortionist. You know, that's the reason I'm with her. It's cheaper to keep her. That's why. Give me a break. Like I said, I'll swing on F and hammer and knock 10 for 250 a week. Chris from Staten Island, Dan. I learned that divorce is worse than taking a Tel Aviv cab. It's even longer. We got to go. Last long and I'm waiting for him. We got to go. Dynamite. Yeah. Tomorrow's after you Friday. Oh, what a warm up day we had today. All right. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Thank you for listening to us. We well, you're all we got. We love you. Please don't leave us. You guys leave us too. Don't leave us. They won't take you away in the settlement. I promise. What do you mean you need room? What do you mean I'm too clingy? We need you. Yeah. Anthony, we're open. We've taken your listeners. No, we need the visitation rights. Please, please for the love of God. Nice people. Don't leave your pals in their time of need. All right. We got to go. See you tomorrow too. All right. We got to go. See you tomorrow too. Mar.
