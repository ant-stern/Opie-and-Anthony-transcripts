 Alright, here it comes. Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler. We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Kool and the Human Show. 1027, WNEW. Hey, I'm John Stewart and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027, WNEW. These guys have problems, but you know that. Opie and Anthony. There's no level too low that you guys won't stick to. That is the final level. Please stop. 1027, WNEW. Okay, terrific. Hey, hey, hey! Okay, terrific. Alright, another way to kick off the show. Another way to kick off the show. Okay, terrific. Yeah, we're rockin'. Never hear an Un-Village people out there. Oh yeah, Anthony. It's the O.A. Show! Any guy you can. Well, what's up, Anthony? Hey, man. It's the O.A. Show. Yes, it is. It's a great day, Anthony. Beautiful day. It's unbelievable out here. Had that spring smell, didn't it, when you went outside? Oh, that's what I was smelling out there. Oh yeah, I thought I was smelling... Too fat. No, it is great out. Spring fever has hit, Anthony. Beautiful. You can feel it in the air. People driving around with their windows down, maybe. Sun roof open. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm thinking we should preview Whip-a-Mow Wednesday today. A little preview of the Wow-age? A little preview of Whip-a-Mow Wednesday. It is a little early in the season. It's early, but we have a lot of brand new listeners, Anthony. They don't know what Whip-a-Mow Wednesday is all about. It's like the preseason. It's a preseason, kind of like the Yankees. You know how they're messing up things down there in Florida. I hope they feel a little better than preseason Yankees have been doing. I love that, though, how the papers print that, too. You know, the Yankees have been having a little bit of a time there preseason. Oh, in five? It's not about preseason. It's not about winning, though. Yeah, don't worry about it. And people are like, uh-oh, is this spelling a bad year for the Yankees? If I'm not mistaken, I think they did the same thing last year. Yeah, don't worry about it. They had a really crappy spring. Don't have to worry about it. Spring training. We just all got to pray for Darrell. Oh, he's getting pissed, man. Yeah, I know. Steinbrenner walked out of a preseason game? Relax. I think this is the year where he finally loses it. He finally goes back to the George we remember from the 70s. This year, George Steinbrenner will fire Joe Torrey. Thank you. Really? Wow, bold statement from the Opster. Thank you. It's been way too long. I don't want him to fire Joe Torrey. I think he would be stupid to fire Joe Torrey, but I think this is the year. This is the year that George goes back to being the mean bastard that we all know and love. I'm going to cut him out of the Yankees like they cut Yacoulin out. Hey! I just had that feeling in my gut today, Anthony, that the old George is coming back this year. Yeah? You know, all of a sudden the Yankees start off a little slow. I don't think he has it in him anymore. He fires Torrey. I don't think he has it in him anymore. To fire anyone? Well, not to fire anyone, just to be that ball buster that he used to be. Yeah, we'll say it's preseason. Relax, Jesus Christ. Got to say hi to everyone. I saw the Knick game last night at the Garden. Did anybody comment on your faggy pink hat? Well, that's why I have to say hi to everyone that came by and said hi and said, wow, Anthony was right. Your hat is not pink. Thank you very much. It's a red hat. It's a red hat, yes. But, man, it was the earliest I've ever left a professional basketball game, and you know how much I love hoops. Very boring. I left late in the third quarter, Anthony. Now, why? To catch the 9.31 back home. But what was the problem with the game? Well, when you're at the Garden, you have to make some decisions. It's like, hmm, should I make the 9.31 train home or should I wait until the 10.02? Right. And the game wasn't going anywhere. They were up by 20 or so at that point. I'm like, you know what? This is boring. Up by 20? Up by 20? Yeah. So I guess they won because... No, they kicked serious ass. The team looked great. Yeah. But it was Vancouver, man. Vancouver, it seemed like they were playing an exhibition game last night. Yeah. Like, Vancouver has got to be the most boring team in the NBA. No standout stars. It just sucked. You could just feel it in the place. Even though the Knicks were playing great and kicking their ass, it was like there was no energy in the Garden last night. Huh. So I'm like, screw this. I'm going home. Wow. So I took the early train home last night. Were you sitting in the seats we usually sit in? Yeah. Those seats. Oh, yeah. Because I think we had the game on for a couple of minutes in the office and I think we saw you. Really? Yeah. I'm not a joke. All right. Here's the joke. No, I swear. It wasn't a joke. It was a hat. It was a hat? Yeah. Yeah. Because on TV it turned up a little pink. Shut up. I'm serious. You're such a dick. It's no joke. What a douche. At least I go to sporting events and stuff. I went to the Knicks game with you last night. And support the team and things like that. Aw, support the team. Like the Knicks care if you're there. You know what I mean. As long as big fat Star Jones is on the sideline and Spike, that's all they care about. The celebrities. Star Jones was there. Was she? Spike was there. No Tom Brokaw last night. No Woody Allen. She's one of those big fat Knick groupies. She goes to every game. Every game I've been to she's been there, yes. Some people like that. Like Star. I'm convinced she just wants to be seen there. I think that's part of it. Another part of it is it's a reason for her to talk to men. You know what I mean? Like if she goes to the Knick game she could start a conversation. Oh, how about the Knicks? Oh, I was at the game last night. Me big fat Star Jones was there. I'm a lawyer. But I think it just gives her something to talk about. You know? Like she's there at every game. Right on the sideline. Well, she's in the front row. Court side. You know those court side seats are just unbelievably expensive, Anthony. This is a great game. More chicken wing. Oh, that was a good shot. Right in my mouth. I'm not talking about the game. I'm talking about the guy throwing chicken wing at me. You know, people work their whole lives to try to get really good seats. When you're going for season tickets you know the deal, right? Sure. Very hard. Can you imagine after years and years you finally get court side seats at the Garden and you have to sit next to Star Jones? Because the seats in the Garden to begin with are so freaking next to each other. It's very tiny. They kind of squeeze as many asses in there as possible. Then you've got Star Jones' thigh on your leg as you're trying to sit down and watch the Knicks. She's like moving all over trying to see the game. I've got to see that game. Where's the ball? Let me look at the guy on this side of the court. Meanwhile you've got the big flabby holiday ham arm like bashing in the face. But I'm a diva so it's okay. Take all that money for those seats. That's tasty. What is that? Basketball? I hate the basketball. Look at that. I can't even tell. Can't even tell. Pay all that money for those seats and you only get to use a corner of them? Yeah. Gee, thanks. Star Jones' big giant hippo calf and thigh is right brushed up against your leg. That's good. That's a unique flavor. Oh, I'm sorry. That's your arm. I seem to have taken a bite out of your forearm. I like having a little Chinese here at the game. I just ate too many. Sorry, Woody. Woody couldn't be bothered. He wasn't there last night. Know who was there? Who? I spent half the game checking out one of my favorite actresses of all time. Uh-oh. And I didn't know she was either married or just hanging with... With a dude. With Kevin Kline. Kevin Kline? Let me see. Phoebe Cates. Are they married? Yeah. Huh. Does she look good? Huh. Oh, yeah? She was going through a phase. She hasn't aged a bit, Anthony. She's sitting there with Kevin Kline and I'm staring at her the whole damn time. Really? Huh. Where was she sitting? You know where Brokaw sits? Yeah. Kind of like... Why couldn't I be there to see Phoebe Cates? You know, I spanked out a batch just like Judge Reinhold did and past times when Judge ran high. Uh-huh. Yes. I love that one. Phoebe Cates. Phoebe Cates, yeah. Remember that scene where Phoebe comes out of the swimming pool? I always... Wait, tell me about that scene. Let me get the music for you so we can take you right back, okay? I'd like to make believe it's me. All right, here we go. Spanking out a batch in the bathroom. Oh, yeah. Here she comes. Yeah. Oh. There it is, though. She dives in the pool, swims up to the wall. Now she climbs out of the pool slowly, misting water behind her as she unbuckles her brazier and opening up between those lovely, eerie gaits and moves and says, Tom, you know I've always wanted you. Doesn't anybody freaking knock anymore? Those guys are fags. And then we're going to wig on over to Luzon and jam with the Stones. Awesome. Totally awesome. But isn't this our time, Mr. Han? Righteous Bucks. Hey, a nice jacket. I love those, dude. When it comes to making out, always remember, you're not going to get a good look at your face. You're going to get a good look at your face. You're going to get a good look at your face. You're going to get a good look at your face. When it comes to making out, always remember, side one of a low-ceiling floor. That's a very good job. I'm a big fan of Passide the Ridgeman High. That was great. I can fix it. I've got an awesome set of tools. Look at that. Look at that. Now I'm banging Jennifer Jason Lee in the pool cabana. Look at those saggy boobs. What's up with her? She's naked in every movie. She was naked in every movie. You're right, John. Looking very bad in every movie naked. But CBK is coming out of the pool. We all remember that scene. I remember leaving a little bash on the bottom of the NBC News desk after I saw the screen. I felt a little woozy, a little lightheaded, in Big Tom's head and Little Tom. Hey! Tom, big Fast Times fan. Oh, wow. Phoebe, wow. And she looks, come on. Phoebe looked so freaking hot last night. Just as good. I was dying. I can't accept that. I was dying. I was making believe there was a fly hitting the side of my face so I could turn my head real fast and do the look. Because you can't check out chicks when you're with your chick. Yeah. That always stinks. So you've got to make excuses while you're looking elsewhere instead of checking out Patrick Ewing down low in the paint. I thought you could use some help with your math homework on such a hot day. Hey, Rat, would you get that out of the hamper? You forgot the cheap trick. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You forgot the cheap trick. Mommy's all right. Daddy's all right. It just seemed a little weird. The dream police. Da da da da da da. Yeah, but Phoebe was hanging with Kevin Kline. Yeah, well, they've been married for a while. I did not know that. I assumed Kevin Kline was gay. Really? Yeah. Wow. Blow that assumption. They've been married long enough where it isn't really a beard. I thought he was into Tom Selleck. Well, they did kiss in that movie. Oh, boy, did they. Jesus. I don't know. There was a mouth kiss on an SNL I saw the other day. I saw that. Did you see that one? That was pretty funny. That was a funny bit. Yeah. On the airplane, spanking each other. All right, let's see. A couple of guys kissed. A couple of cast members. Well, it was Will Farrell. Yeah. Chris Cattain, right? I might have enjoyed it. Right. And then I was watching some of the old SNLs on Comedy Central. And it's so funny to see J. Moore popping up on those things because I swear they gave him the smallest parts ever. He did nothing. I mean, you thought Brewer barely showed up on those shows. J. Moore is on screen long enough to just go, J, what's with the effing hair? There's some wings going or something. It was pretty funny. He was one of the guys on the buh-bye sketch. Buh-bye, buh-bye. And they just usher him out of the plane. You know, buh-bye. You've got to remember all this next time J. Moore calls in. Yeah. We've got to abuse him. Hound him a little bit. Well, we're going to talk about Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, but we went off on some classic O&A tangents there. Always off on a tear. Yeah, we want to preview Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today. So we're encouraging the ladies of the Opie and Anthony show. Yes, ladies. To flash your fellow commuters. Your fellow commuters on the way home today. It's just a preview, Anthony. Yeah, the nice weather. It's a good way to get it started. By the time April hits, this thing is going to be huge. Huge. We're going to have brand new stickers and all that, but I mean, this is a great opportunity. It's too nice out today not to do something about it. So ladies, we do encourage you to flash your commuters today, okay? Absolutely. On the way home. And guys, if you see anything out there, please let us know, okay? Right. We'll go to the phones next. 212-757-1027. Hello? I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here. That has no place on this show. I know that. Opie and Anthony. More stupidity on the way. 1027-WNEW. All right, Anthony, Mountain Dew. Yes, Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew, yes, Anthony. I love Mountain Dew. Oh yeah. Remember drinking it when I was a kid? I drink it now. Good thirst quencher. We got a hell of a deal working with Mountain Dew, don't we, Opie? Uh-huh. Why don't you tell them about it? Oh, I thought you were going to tell them about it today. No, this is basketball. This is your thing. The only thing I have to say is go Iona. That's right. Anthony picking Iona to go all the way in the NCAA tournament. I'm betting on the retard factor. Now we got a great deal. A great deal. A great thing going with Mountain Dew, the NCAA, and the Opie and Anthony show, of course. Yes. We are going to send one of our fine, fine listeners to the Final Four to check it out for yourself. Nice. This is what's going to happen, okay? We're going to have all the teams, all 64 teams on the WNAW website, obviously looking for the college basketball fans out there, okay? You go to the WNAW website when all the teams are announced, which is going to be what, Monday, I think? Yep. I think Monday we'll start that, okay? And then you have to decide, Anthony. Yes. Who's going to be in the Final Four? And then we are going to pick a winner. Now what happens if like 20 people guess, you know, the Final Four teams? Winners will be picked by random drawing. Thank you, Anthony. I'm sure. That's usually the way it's worked if you have people that have picked the same teams. All right. So if you want to go to the Final Four, on us, and Mountain Dew, starting Monday, go to www.wnaw.com. You'll see where to go. And you pick the Final Four teams. You'll register. And then we'll pick a winner. And it might be you, okay? We now. All right. So do the Dew with Mountain Dew and listen to us to win a trip to the Final Four. Mountain Dew. The Opie and Anthony Show. It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting. Hail to the kings of the radio. 1027 WNEW. Who'd that be? That's lovely. Who'd that be? That's all we get to that. It wasn't chewed up. And we love Godsmack. Come on. Give it to me. There we go. Godsmack Moon, baby. One of my favorite albums of the past couple of years at this point, Anthony. What's your favorite album of the last couple of years, Anthony? Last couple of years? Yeah. Goddamn. Because I mean, you could easily say Kid Rock for the last year, possibly. But if you go back a few years, which one of your favorite albums? I have to say, your favorite album of the last few years. That's a tough question. Maybe Rob Zombie's solo effort. Yeah, that was pretty good. Dragula. Huh? Which one? Yeah, the new No Doubt album, Opie. That's moving up the Anthony chart. The Anthony rock chart. I would say I really like the Rob Zombie. That was a really good album. Yeah, I have to really think about it. Godsmack. It rocks from beginning to end. I think I'm boycotting them, though. Why are you boycotting Godsmack? Well, they punked out. They don't come to the show or nothing. I know. And them guys are huge friends of ours on the station up in Boston. Came on the show. Had a great relationship with them. And then they sell a few billion friggin' records and that's it. They forget they're friends, right? I think K-Rock's got them scared. Yeah, well that's fine and dandy, but you know something? See, let me tell all our listeners something that is the truth. Aunt and I know more about music than any jock at K-Rock and any jock at MTV. Simple as that. Hey, wait a minute. You know, Kane, come on. Kane knows more than us? I doubt it. He's on VH1. He's got to know a lot. Well, I guess we're really not allowed to have rock acts on here. Because, I mean, we've tried. It upsets them over there. It upsets K-Rock because if we take their rock acts, then what else have they got over there? Not much. You know, the tide has completely changed with VH1 and MTV. Like VH1's becoming cooler. You know when you used to... Yeah, like years ago... I hate to admit that, but the videos I want to see are on VH1. Years ago, you used to say, God, if I start watching VH1 and thinking it's better than MTV, it's going to mean I'm getting old. And that's not quite the truth anymore. It just means that MTV is really blowing... You know, what do you want us to... Listen to Britney and Instinct. Or you know what I saw last night on VH1? Henry Rollins. Rollins on VH1. I was dying. Doing what? Liar? No, like one of the new songs. A new album. Really? Yeah. It kicked ass. Henry Rollins, Liars. Such a great thing. I know. It was good. Rollins band. What in his brain popped when he sung that song? Liar! I started laughing as I'm watching it because I'm just thinking of the Beavis and Budhead episode. Who do you think would win in a fight? Danzig or Henry Rollins? Yeah. I'd have to give it to Danzig. You know, and they have this total argument going on. You know, Rollins is pretty big there. But... You're a dumbass. I'd miss Beavis and Budhead. Yeah. So Henry Rollins is on VH1, and you switch over to MTV, and you have 98 degrees. Holy mother of pearl. What the hell is going on? They're catering to the teeny boppers. Or another Britney Spears look-alike. Know how many Britney Spears look-alikes there are now? Christina Aguilera. Then they got... I don't even know all the names of them. Jennifer Simpson, I think, is one of them. And Mandy something, I think. Yeah, they're all pumping them out like the boy bands. You know, there's a bunch of carbon copies of those. No one will ever beat Britney and her breast implants, though. The breast is always the best. All the other ones need the breast implants. Yeah, unless somebody's willing to get breast implants at like 12. And start singing to really get the publicity going. Now that'd be interesting. That would be very interesting. But yeah, now they're running off carbon copies. And then you got Carson, who I know has to hate the image that he is getting. You see him on TV Guide and all these magazines. And it's like, oh, all the girls love Carson. He's just... ooh, he's great. He's like a teeny bopper idol. You know, they love him. And you know, he wants credibility. He wants music credibility. And it's killing him. It's killing him. Well, because he used to do a cool radio show out there in L.A. Now he's the teeny bopper guy who is getting lumped in with Instinct and 98 Degrees from all the girls that love all that. They're putting his pictures up on the walls. It's got to kill him. The backdoor boys. Yeah. I mean, that's the last thing I think he wants. He's the Dick Clark of our era. Ah, good. He is, though. You know something? You just got to open up the MTV yearbooks. Take a look back and please don't be too full of yourself. There's plenty. Remember J.J. Jackson? J.J. I liked Alan Hunter. Martha Quinn. Alan Hunter. Alan Hunter is my favorite. Jay Moore was a VJ? Jay Moore was a VJ? I don't know. Another question to ask him when he calls us again. He might have had VD at some point. I don't know if he was ever a VJ. Hello, Niko. Hey Sam, what's going on? Oh, I just got to let you guys know you guys rock, okay? Why? I just had an awesome incident. I work in the military. Yeah. I just came back from Fort Mama. Yeah. On the 18th of the way back, we're thinking, yeah, why not? Let's write something on a piece of paper. Wow, right? Yeah, yeah. Sure enough, these two girls ride past us. We didn't think nothing of it. We decided to give it a shot. My friend whips out this wild side, sticks it on the window. The girl starts laughing. Sure enough, I've seen a lot of it. I've seen a lot, and this one will be one of the most memorable scenes. And they just took everything off. And they just made our day. I just got to let you guys know, keep up the good work. Oh, cool, man. What road did that happen on, Sam? It just happened right on 18th. All right, well, thank you. All right. All right, man. They're very happy, Anthony. Yes, they are. We are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today because we can't help it. The weather is way too good out there. So ladies, we're encouraging you to flash your fellow commuters today. Please, just to give our new listeners a sample of what they can expect all summer long here on the Opie and Anthony show. Right, Anthony? Right. Basically, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, you put wow in your car, and then the ladies know that you want to see something. Wow, somewhere on the car. It could be written on the dirt and the big doors of your tractor trailer. It could be on the back window of your car. Yeah. A little bumper sticker thing, something just written. Bag of wow chips has been working great for the guys that have the wives or girlfriends that don't want them putting wow in the car. You get those wow chips and shove it in the, like, by the rear window, all of a sudden you got a wow in your car. Your wife is like, pissed at you. You go, oh, I forgot the bag of chips back there. And we're only going to preview because we know winter is going to kick us in the ass one last time. It always does every year. And then we'll break out wow for good, probably in early April, I'm assuming. Very good. Right? Yes. I'm encouraging the ladies. We're going to push it today. We're going to push it. Yeah. Ladies, flash your fellow commuters if you feel like it. Wow-age. Give them a taste of what, you know, the Opie and Anthony show is all about, all right? Taste the taste. All right, we got to take a break, Anthony. Wowed on train, wowed on the parkway. Wow. A lot of people checking in already, Anthony. It's happening. Nice. Quick break. We'll be back. Phone line 212-757-1027. And action. I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. Okay, terrific. And cut. Opie, Anthony, 1027-WNEW. Anthony Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner. Yes, it works. It does work, Anthony. And you might need it. What have you been doing? You've been eating, you've been hibernating for the winter. Well, simply. Like a squirrel, you've been storing your nuts. And now that we're getting a sample of spring today, Anthony. Uh-huh. You know, it's in the back of your head, oh my God, I've got to lose some of this weight before the warm weather hits for good. What happened? I didn't have a bunt when I put my coat on. Now all of a sudden you've got to burn that bunt. Burn that bunt. How are you going to do it? With the world's strongest bunt burner. Yeah, we want to talk to the girl that heard about Stacker II from our show and lost over 100 pounds. Is she too scared to contact us? Come on. Because there's a- Come on. There's a pre-recorded commercial that's running when we're not on the air where this girl brags about how she lost 106 pounds on Stacker II. She heard about it on our show. Yeah. And she basically wants to give us hummers. Really? Yeah, she's so ecstatic. We changed her life, Anthony, with this stuff. You know what's amazing? The station itself, N.E.W., took a Stacker and lost about 300 pounds of fat. 300? Try a couple tons. It was called Tom Likens. It's not 300. Oh, come on. It's about 180. Really? 185. He carries it like three. Maybe it's the Mongoloid hair to- All right, Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner, does the three things. It burns the fat. It crushes the cravings in between meals. And it gives you a boost of energy when you're petering out late in the day, okay? Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner, give them a call. 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner. Where thousands have proven it works. Hey, Pat, what's going on today? Hey, how you doing? Real good. Is that Pat? Huh? Who is this, Pat? Opie and Anthony, we're live on the air. Let's go. Hey, are you getting a little play by? You guys are 13. Okay. I'm a truck driver. I listen to you guys all the time. I just got wowed by a couple chicks in a red car. There you go! Hey, whip them out Wednesday. You guys are great. We're previewing whip them out Wednesday today because we can't help ourselves. It's so nice out, so. Well, congratulations to you, sir. Hey, thanks a lot, guys. All right, man. You guys are great. All right. All right. Definitely encouraging the ladies to flash their fellow commuters on the way home today. Yeah. As we give you a preview of what the spring and summer is going to be like on the Opie and Anthony show. It's one of the many things, okay? Mmm. Ah. You want to talk about Clinton real fast? This is great. I guess we could start doing new material. I've been on an hour and a half at some point. Oh, my God. All right, I'll read this one. Clinton finds screensaver amazing. I love this. This is the leader of the free world, right, Anthony? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. President Clinton, who likes to play up his fascination with computers while playing down his experience, was dazzled on Tuesday by a basic display of software, a screensaver. A screensaver. He was amazed by a screensaver, ladies and gentlemen. There's a quote in here by Clinton saying, amazing. Amazing. Clinton said, I was watching a series of coffee cups, deer, and a blackboard form and dissolve on a monitor during a visit to a computing class in a senior citizen center. Wow. Amazing. Look at that. Look, it's like pipes, and they're just making themselves go. I don't know where they're going, and then they disappear. Amazing. He's amazed by a screensaver. By a screensaver. Yeah. This just goes to show you that these jerk-offs have the speech writers and everything, and they're publicity people, and they make their speeches about the internet. He's been talking internet and everything, like he knows what he's talking about, computers. God doesn't have a clue. He's amazed by a screensaver. A screensaver. Amazing. Not by The Sims or some of the great computer games out there. No, nothing. He's amazed by a screensaver. Right. Oh my God. The low-key visit with about 30 participants in the class also got Clinton talking about computer games he used to play with his daughter Chelsea. They were Freddy's Rescue Roundup and the Carmen Sandiego series of educational games, Anthony. I just know porno. I like to punch up the pornography, like cigars and stuff. I like that. I like that. Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? I played that one with Chelsea, and Hillary played Where in the World is Bill's Penis? She wasn't really doing very well at that game right up until about a year ago, and then she won. I love it. I'm playing some new games. Womb Raider. Womb Raider, huh? Gash Life. New one. First-person load shooter, they call it. And it also says, Clinton does not use his office email that much, Anthony. What would he be doing? I'm 15. How old are you? Clinton in the chat rooms. That could be pretty funny. Good AOL's chubby chick chat room. I like this one. Do you like cigars? How much do you waste? Would you like to intern for me, the president? That is ridiculous. Clinton finds screensaver. Amazing. It's like magic. Look at that. And I turn the monitor around, and I don't see how they get those pictures in there. I'm amazed by the whole thing. Look, there's a picture of fire on the monitor, but I don't feel any warmth. How they do that. Amazing. Yeah, suck it. Go ahead. I'm amazed by the screen. Suck it. Oh, boy. You find these things out toward the end of any administration. The guy at the helm is a stark-raving lunatic. Yeah, they've run out of things to talk about, Anthony, at this point, so now they've got to dig deep, you know? Yeah. Well, maybe he wasn't really paying attention to the computer on the monitor when Monica's ass was up there. You know? I didn't really look at the screen saver when I was looking at a big brown eye. That's amazing. Amazing. Look at that big old brown eye. That's amazing, all right, Mr. Clinton. My God. What the hell? I was wondering what that was, a computer. Is that what it is? Yeah. What does it do? What does that even do? Suck it. I got the brown eye screen saver. It's amazing. Opens and closes. It's great. That's great. Amazed by a screen saver. Holy God. Oh, you almost cursed there. Oh, my God. I'm amazed that he's amazed. Even Gregor would probably... Yes, I know about screen savers. They don't amaze me. They amaze Clinton. Mr. 20th century, 21st century. Didn't Gore invent the Internet? Oh, that's what he should know about... That's what he claims, yes, Anthony. I want to know something. Did Clinton and Gore speak at all during eight years together as president and vice president? Have you ever seen them in the same room shaking hands, talking? No. These guys didn't say word while not boo to each other. Eight years. I didn't even think they knew each other. And Al Gore invented the Internet. Al Gore is my vice president. I'm amazed. That's amazed. I didn't even know what is a vice president. Who are they kidding? They're keeping Clinton as far away from Gore as possible. Well, Gore is trying to become president. And to have Clinton in there is... Those ads are coming though, Anthony. Oh, you know it. Now that we know it's going to be Bush and Gore, let's face facts here. Bradley, what? He's dropping out tomorrow and he's going to endorse Gore. Gore, yes. And Bush obviously just pretty much killing McCain at this point. Yes, McCain had a little rally there for a little while. It was kind of cute. Oh, look at the vet. He's there. We'll all get behind him and everything. But then it fell apart. He just doesn't have the support. I think it all comes down to cash too. And looks. Which is an awful thing because the best guy for the job might not be the most attractive guy. The best guy for the job is Bradley, but he looks like a slob in my opinion. Bush looks like a president. He looks like what people expect their president to look like. You could picture him as president. It looks like his dad, younger version of his dad. Very good. Get in the office. Hey son, can I maybe come in and sit in my old seat? Maybe put my finger back on the button? If Bush becomes president, does he sleep in the same bed his parents were stooping in? The White House? Oh my God. Call 1-800-TRY-A-VET. You know he's going to want to redo that room when he gets out of there. Rockaway vetting. He's going to need Rockaway vetting. You don't want the old stained Bush mattress laying out on Pennsylvania Avenue. Two big dents where Barbara Bush's fat ass is embedded in the bed. You don't want that. That's got to suck though. You become president, let's just assume. Yeah. And then you see the room where your parents were having sex and that's now your room. That's now your room. Yeah. Clown your own thang. You know what the thing is though, who really knows if that bed is still even in there? I'm sure the Clintons have been through it. A mattress is good. But I've got to tell you, if I was George W. Bush, who I would think would probably be the next president, just saying, he gets into office, the first thing I do day one after the inauguration, you move into the White House, I would get the most stained, disgusting decrepit mattress and just carry it out to the curb and leave it out there. And just like big stacks of porno mags and just pile it up by the driveway for the garbage man. Would that be hysterical? A couple boxes of cigars. Cigars. Old condoms and stuff. And just like lay all that crap right on the curb. God damn would that be killer. We should do that. Yeah. That's our bit, man. Let's do that Clinton moving day giveaway. Yes. A stained mattress. Oh man. A Clinton garage. Take it away. I have no need for this anymore. Let's do a Clinton garage sale. Clinton garage sale. We'll broadcast live in front of the White House. There's a park right in front of the White House there. Yeah. We'll broadcast from the park. We'll do that. Clinton's moving out and the savings are passed on to you. This old stained mattress. Some cigars. Sploot stained dresses. Very good. Amanda, what's going on? Hey guys, how's everything? Good. I was watching MSNBC last night waiting for the results to come in for the primaries. Can I stop you there? Sure. Why did you have to tune in yesterday and wait for the results? Why? I have to know now. No, I knew before Super Tuesday that it was all over. I was a McCain supporter and I just wanted to see how it would be pulled out. You are? Yeah. Why were you backing him? I was backing him because he was different, refreshing for the Republican Party. Like your shoulders. Well, anyway, they strategically placed Maria Stryver in the hallway waiting for McCain to come in to make his acceptance speech. Oh yeah, this is great. And he snapped her and said, get out of here. And she got all bent out of shape. But how else is this man supposed to act? He's just like... You know how he's supposed to act? He's supposed to act not like a sore loser and presidential, or at least presidential contender-ish. Because he walked by her and she was asking him, how do you feel? How do you feel? You know, prodding him and hounding him like reporters do. And he turned around and said something like, get away from me. Get off. Get away from me. I think it was very normal though. Yeah. Get away. You whore. He's got it in him to snap Amanda. That's why we wanted him to be president so he would snap in the Oval Office there. Well, he had a little bit of a preview last night. It was really funny because then whoever it was, if Brian, whoever the heck his name is on MSNBC, he's like, well, you heard it here. Get out of here. It was so ridiculous. Get out of here. It was pretty funny. All right. All right, guys. Take care. Who are you going for now that McCain's pretty much out of it? You're going to... All right. Well... She'd probably go for Bush. That's what I would assume. Darren, what's going on? Hey, guys. How are you? How amaze is Bill Clinton's son, Bill? How are you doing? How are you? How amaze is Bill Clinton about DNA? DNA. I can't believe they found me. I'm amazed. How did they find out that was my splooge? I'm amazed. Well, there you have it. The president amazed at a screen saver. A screen saver. That's something. You know something? I got to admit, I was pretty amazed when I went from like my Commodore 64 or my Atari 800 with my cassette load drive. Sure. You just have games on cassette tapes. I remember that. And it was a cassette load. You just have to type in C load. C load. For cassette load. So when the computers really... I got my first Mac and you see the screen saver on it and the graphics are so sharp and it's pretty cool. It's moving. It doesn't look like that pixelated crap you used to get on Atari and Commodore. I've got to say, I was amazed. I was amazed. Well, that's something to be amazed about. It was also 1983. I know, right? I don't get to be amazed at a screen saver. But it's the year 2000. You have to be amazed at a screen saver. I'm amazed. You know what else? Get this. You should have a screen saver of Monica giving him a hummer or something. I took this TV dinner. I put it in this thing that I like to call the cooking box in the White House. Pushed a button or two. Made these amazing beeping noises. And you know something? In three minutes, that came out hot. They called that a microwave oven. Amazing. Normally, it would take maybe 20 minutes to thaw and cook that Swanson TV dinner. Three minutes, I was amazed. I ate the whole thing in front of my screen saver. Are you amazed at beepers too? What the hell is that? You don't know what a beeper is? No, explain. You can have your girlfriend beep you? Whoa. You mean the little thing that beeps when she's calling you? Yeah. I am amazed. Jesus. God damn, there he is. The president that was talking about leading us into the 21st century. Amazed by the screen saver. Not amazed by MP3 files or... No. Or Voodoo graphics cards. A big lighter. And you move your thumb and there's fire. No more banging rocks. I am amazed. Let's take a break, huh? Amazing. Having lots of fun today. Let's not forget, we are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today. Ladies, we're encouraging you to flash your fellow commuters on the way home today to give them a little taste of what's going to happen in the spring and summer. All right. All right. We'll be back.

Previewing Whip-A-Mill Wednesday today for our fine listeners Anthony. Sure. Cranky ass. Cranky ass. You don't want cranky ass. Gotta make sure you clean up. Get every little nugget out. Another mess of a show in progress. What else did you expect today? Oh please. Hey we talked politics a little bit today. Ready? Sure we did. A little bit. We talked about the Knicks and the Yankees a little bit. Yeah. A little bit there. We don't go right to the gutter. But we always end up there. We always end up there is right. Oh brother. Alright I think we have to take another break. You want me to go to one of these? A lot of few calls coming in about Dice. I don't know what that's all about. Well we'll get into that next. I was wondering because did he have a pay-per-view? Dice on pay-per-view last night? Was that a brand new one? Why wouldn't he call and like come on the show so we could promote his pay-per-view? Does he think he's so big that he can still sell out huge pay-per-views without maybe a friend or two talking about it? Maybe he doesn't like us anymore already. What did we do? Listen Tusk you figure it out. Come on. Alright we'll maybe talk to Dice next then. More of your phone calls. 212-757-1027. OB. What is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point where you're going to change the station? That's what I need to know. Shove it. Boy it's easy to be a fag on this show isn't it? That's going to be trouble. OB and Anthony. We just received a PHD in stupidity. 127-WNEW. Whoa. Groovy. Little retro. Lots of instant feedback coming in Anthony. Luke from Jersey writes. Okay terrific. Almost got me fired today. Thank God the boss is a fan. Kept playing it over the intercom. And he came in and said, okay terrific. Do it again you're fired ass. Okay terrific sweeping the tri-state area. Oh yeah. Oh love it. But you got to know when to use the okay terrific. You can't just use it. No. Right Anthony? Well the best place I guess is the same place like Butt-Head used to just make that face where he would stare into the screen and not say anything. But his face was like. His mouth open. Like what? Horrified. I'll give you one. What? Hey Anthony I got cranky ass today. Okay terrific. Well it works right? That one worked right? And you try one. Let's see. Hey ever have your girl put on a strap on it do you? Okay terrific. I'm feeling a little bloated today. Okay terrific. Yes. Alright let's go to Jimmy. Let's see what this pay-per-view is all about. Jimmy what's up man? Hey what's up guys? How are you? Not much. Happened to be flipping through the channel last night and I saw his face on video. I'm like what the hell is this? I started watching. Who? You're talking to Dice Man. Hey. Yeah I saw the Dice Man. I couldn't believe it was like a train wreck man. A train wreck. It was his pay-per-view from last year? It was a pay-per-view. I don't know. It looked like it was from Vegas or something. It looked like someone was shooting it with a camcorder. It was so big. It was so big. Why would they play an old Dice pay-per-view? I don't know. It looked recent because he was fatter. You know he looked out of shape and you know his face. He looked older. But I don't know. At one point this guy got so desperate that he had to lay down on stage and start humping the stage or something like some girl was taking in the balloon out of him. Hey that's funny stuff Jacob Face. What's the matter? You paid for it didn't you? Did you pay for it? I didn't pay for it. Well you got illegal box? I got the scam-per-view. Hey could you send me five bucks if you enjoyed it? Oh well. I can't help you man. Well we're trying to get him back on the show but we can't find him lately. Well listen back in the day I got to give the guy his props. Back in the day he was funny. You got to admit that. The guy was probably the biggest thing that ever hit comedy. And I think that would ruin them. For a short period of time. Yeah he skyrocketed. I think that would ruin them though. And came down just as fast. I'm still there. I'm still there. I sell out the garden. The olive garden over there in Times Square. Yeah. Okay Jimmy thank you. No problem anytime. Let's see what Charlie can answer this. Charlie you saw the dice pay-per-view huh? Yeah I think Anthony should do dice because he does it better than dice does dice. Just pay Anthony to go on pay-per-view. Anthony doesn't do dice. Dice is really here when you hear it. Oh he is? Yeah when you hear the dice voice. What's wrong with you? You got a problem? Yeah you're funny you're on ONA then you're on your pay-per-view show. Hey take off face. Huh? I'm still relevant.

It's like a burger roll. No. Our phone line, 2127571027. Is this taken from songs from the glory hole? What the hell is this? Fax line, 2129579639. And we are previewing Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today, Anthony. Such a nice spring day, nice and warm. We want to give the newer listeners a taste of what they can expect when Whip-Em-Out Wednesday hits sometime in April. So we are encouraging the ladies on the way home today to whip-em-out to your fellow commuters, okay? Absolutely. All right, let's go back to the phone and see what everyone's talking about here today. James, you're next on NEW. What's up? What's up, Bowen-A. How are you? I'm doing pretty good. I was driving down, had a hard day's work today. I'm a union iron worker, driving on the yellow. Whoa, you can't say that. Oh my. Oh no. So you had a bad day. I had a bad day at work. You're in your car. And a girl in a black Jetta lifted up her top and showed me what she had. And it made your day, right? Oh, it made my day. Cool. Bowen-A. Yeah. I want to ask you, how could you vote for Bush when he's all against union workers? I didn't say... Well... I want a McCain. Yeah, that's what we all wanted. And I want... and I want Bradley. I know that doesn't make sense, but... Yeah, because he's trying to get rid of the union workers in Texas. No one's going to be able to do that. No one will worry about that. You don't think? No, it's like the abortion issue and stuff. Don't worry about it. No one's going to outlaw it. It's not even an issue. I mean, Bush doesn't blow me away, man. Bush? Bush? Yeah, not at all. I mean, none of these guys do. But Gore? I mean, ugh. But at least Al Gore used to be with Clinton, and he had the economy going. Everything's going great. Clinton didn't have anything to do with the economy. Believe me, it was riding a wave. He just got elected at the right time. Yeah, the economy was doing well. It was on an upswing just as he was being elected, pretty much. It turned during the election, I believe, right? Did Bill Clinton come up with all these new businesses that people started investing huge amounts of money in? That's true. No, he doesn't even know about a screensaver. Yeah, he thinks a screensaver's amazing. I don't think Clinton had anything to do with the dot-coms that completely helped our economy. I did. I turned on my computer the other day, and I was amazed by the screensaver. Screensaver's amazing. James, I think Al Gore is our next president. Yeah, let's hope so, man. Let's hope so. Al Gore? I want to feed my kid. I'm not saying... I just think that's what's going to happen. I'm not hoping. Al Gore, only if his running mate is Bill Clinton. That's it. Who's he going to pick? He might pick Bradley. You know? That would be pretty cool. Kind of pull their resources there. I don't know. Oh, Bradley? Bradley's got to scrote him under his chin? Easy, man. All right, guys. I just want to tell you, you and I work as erected fastest. Thanks a lot. All right. Don't mess with the ex-necks, Anthony. Oh, sorry. Don't mess with Dollar Bill. Dollar Bill Bradley, from the corner. From the corner? Wow. Can you name... Why? Well, you can give me back... I'm detecting my basketball. No, you can give me back, like, talking about cartoons and other things. I just want to ask you a question. Okay. Name two players that Bradley played with on the next... Don't write it down, Rick. Okay. Don't write it down. On the next... Two. Two. Two. Two? God, ponderous. I know you could do it, Ed. Come on. Two. Two that Bradley played with. All right. Two players that Bradley played with. See, we're trying to add a sports star show here. This would be a good thing to throw out there. Can you give me the years? Like, 72. 72. 72-ish. Bradley. Give or take a year or two. Okay. Did he play with Wilt? Wilt was with Los Angeles, right? They played during the same era. Very good. There was a couple championships there where the Knicks did play the Lakers, so... See, I knew he was with the Lakers. Okay. Okay. Let me think. No, in all seriousness... I'm thinking. Because it's funnier if you don't know, but I'm really curious. Come on, dude. Bradley and... We need sports on our show. Help me out here. I'm thinking. Basketball isn't all a sport, for the love of God. It's just funny because then when Anthony goes off on some cartoon thing and I'll just sit there like, Uh... Oh, yeah, I remember that, Anthony. Come on, two. Bradley. Um, was it a black guy? Wait, come on. One's a current announcer for Nick basketball. Oh, that guy. No, I know who that is. Okay. We just saw him the other day. We were going out the exit. Don't give him the answer. It's not fun if you're going to give him the answers. That huggy bear. Yeah, yeah, the tall guy. With the sideburns. And the gray beard now. He has a little gray... Oh my God. Come on, Ed. Wait a minute. Let me... What's his name? F-G-M. I can't remember his name. Should I give you the initials? Yeah. W-F. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Walt Frazier. Okay, good. I remember that. Okay, that's one. Very good. One more. Um... I know... Rick's writing them down. I know who they are. The guy with the big afro. It was the 70s, you ass. What, he played hoops with Oscar Gamble? I'm trying to get my... Oscar Gamble, the best afro in sports history. Um... Come on. One more. And I know what you're doing. You're dead serious too, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm totally serious. Oh my God. The other one is, um... Coaches 4. That's too obvious, all right? What, a coach? Like, I'm gonna know a coach? He's now a coach. Um... One's a GM for the Washington Wizards. Bill Parcells? Uh, let's see. Um... Uh... I had you with the Bill name, though, right? It's a Bill. Bill? Bill, Phil, whatever. Phil... Oh, Phil Jackson. Very good. Okay. Oh my God. Very good, Anthony. I done good. We're gonna be doing... I don't know basketball. We're gonna be doing sports on our show, obviously. Especially old basketball. Oh my God. I grew up watching DeBuscher and Bradley...

You're spraying mud? No, no, I'm actually a little constipated, so... Okay. I've been here a while. Did you hear Dice on our show today? Club Soda Kenny? The Dice impression or my real friend? No, the Dice man. No, I haven't spoken to him today. I don't know what's going on with his wife today. Oh, really? I thought you were with him all the time. Not the way you think I am. No, huh? No. Hey Kenny, you're with Jacob, okay? Oh, hi Anthony. No, that's not Anthony. I'm sorry. Come on. How are you doing? Don't blow our cover, Kenny. Tend to my business, ass. Go get me a gig.

Alright, well what's the possibility of getting the Dice on our show soon? Well, you know, I'll talk to him. He's exclusively playing Las Vegas at the Venetian Hotel. You know, we're there like one week in the month. We'll be there the end of the month, like April Fool's Day. Well, what do you want us to do? I'll fly out there and see him? Well, you know, you go see J. Moore, why don't you go see a Dice show? Well, the Dice has to play the area. Yeah. I told you, he plays exclusively in Las Vegas. Yeah, well fly us out to Vegas. Nah, I could. Yeah? Dice makes enough money, right? What's in it for me? He's got to be making royalties off of that cop movie I saw on the hotel TV a couple of months ago. You know, Robert Hicks with Don the Dragon Wilson? Yeah. Yeah. That was a good one. He's got two new movies coming out soon, too, Rodney and Michael Douglas. Rodney's still alive? Rodney's still alive. God, you can't talk about him like that. He just did. Kenny, we interviewed him a couple of years ago. Is he doing better these days? Hey, I just crept myself, okay? Who was that talking? That was Rodney. Rodney. Oh, I didn't recognize the thing. Kenny, you're pretty good, man. Hey, I've got to change my defense. I'm a good personality. All right. Pretty good. You're kind of going to get your personnel. Okay. Very good. Your timing was impeccable. He likes to die. You make me laugh, man. Kenny, you're funny when Dice ain't around. I'm very funny all the time. Yeah. You know, he's like an inspiration to me. He's the man. He keeps you down. Not he doesn't. I don't know. He treats me very well. Yeah. Are you still checking out our show from time to time there, Kenny? Yeah. I listen almost on a daily basis for like an hour or so, you know, whenever I'm doing something. Very good. Whenever you're constipated, right? I love you guys. You know, the whole Jay Moore show was terrific. Oh, yeah. He's another friend of mine. We love Jay. You know, I was almost thinking of coming to see you when you went to see him. Uh-huh. But I didn't. Well, come by next time, man. You can come by the studio anytime. You don't need Dice. No, you got to come to Rascals in West Orange. Well, we will. That's where I hang out. All right. Oh, yeah. Anybody that wants to see me can go to Rascals in West Orange. Can't you just pull your face out of Dice's ass and hand him the phone right now? Come on. Hey, don't curse. Don't curse, because I'll start cursing like him. Oh, yeah. And you won't be able to bleep me that much. All right. Well, Kenny, surprise us and get Dice to call us. Hey, get Dice in here. Oh, now that I got the hotline number, I don't have to call Rick's beeper or stay on the phone and beg Spaz to put me on the air. How pathetic is that, huh? Beeper says they're amazing. No, I actually got it right, too. I feel like really important this time. Yeah, hotline. Yeah, I'm Club Stardaketty, damn it. All right. Change the hotline number. We're going to change the hotline tomorrow. All right. All right, Kenny. Listen, it's a pleasure. Yeah, OK, Kenny. I'll call Andrew and I'll relay your sentiments to him. All right, very good. All right, you take care, boys. All right, take it easy, Kenny. He's done the good work, and as they say, you suck. All right, Club Stardaketty, everyone. All right, take care. There he goes. He'll get Dice to call us. Yeah, new movie with Dice, all right, huh? Yeah, I crap myself. It's the whole movie. Quick break, we'll be back. Good day, New York.

You want to know something, you're gonna laugh. Yeah. Because I was listening so hard to those greeting cards that Dice gave that I didn't make it to the bathroom to leak. And I'm pre-boiling right now. I had to toss my drawers in the can. You wet himself? I haven't done that in a long time. I was a little kid. You made me laugh that hard. Oh, that's good.

And why do you want to go to the strip club? Why not? You want to know what goes on there? I mean, why are you going? There's gotta be a reason. I want to go and see the girls. Maybe you're making a paranoid. Why, you get turned on by other women? Well, kind of. If they have me girls, they're attractive. All right. And he has a problem with that? Yeah. His friends will take me, but my boyfriend won't take me. Will his friends take you to the strip club? His friends would take me if he would let me go. Yeah, sure. And what does he say when you ask him? He says no. No way. But he has to give you a reason. I don't know. He doesn't give me a reason. He's more or less paranoid, I guess. Well, he should obviously bring you there. Especially if it's gonna turn you on a little bit. That's a nice little fantasy to check out, right? Our sexual tension all the way between both of us. Oh, yeah. Does he bang you nice or what? Excuse me? Does he bang you? Oh, of course. Yeah. All right. I don't know. Go yourself. I can't go myself. I gotta go with my boyfriend so I can go back and have sex with him. Yeah, but he wants to have sex with the strippers. Oh, hell no. No, I'm just kidding. Of course. I don't know what you mean. Maybe you can confide in convincing that taking a girlfriend to the strip bar is a good thing. Well, if he gives us a call, we'll talk to him about it. Great. I think he should bring you, though. Oh, I think so. Definitely. I think you guys would have a great time. I've kissed a girl already. I might as well go and see her strip. You have. Yes, I have. How was it? It was good. Very good. All right, hold on. Rich is gonna give you some advice. Maybe not. Hold on. Hold on. Where am I? Okay, let's go here and here. Hey, Rich. Yeah. You got some advice for me? Yeah, hey, don't go. Don't go. I took my wife there. I took her to the strip clubs and she left me for another woman. Whoa. Hey, heavy. No, no, no, I love men. So did she. Oh, no, I need men. So did she. So she met a woman. So Rich, what happened? You took her to the strip club and did she go away with one of the strippers or that just sent her down the path? Well, that just sent her down the path. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Well, that just sent her down the path. And she started hanging out with women. Oh, yeah. Once she got with the lesbian, that's it, man. Really? Oh, yeah, big time. Very, how can I say, militant group. That's going to suck when your lady leaves you for a lady. Why would it do that? Well, it's fun for the beginning, but when they leave you big time, then it does suck. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you, Rich. Hey, anytime. All right. Bye. Rich says don't go. Let's see what Alan says. He's not helping. Hey, Alan. How you doing, guys? Good. You took your girlfriend to the strip club? Yeah. I took her on Sunday to, when I went to Lenox City, I took her to a place called the Booby Trap. Oh, that's what they call it. The Booby Trap. Yeah. Great name. I love strip club names. They're the best. Yeah, right? Okay. And? It was also nudity. I sat down by the bar, by where they danced on the stage, and no girls would come up to me. But when she left, they came up to me. Doesn't that sound weird? So what, you're one of those guys that wants the girls to come up to you and stuff? Well, my girlfriend found it pretty hard for me to be giving those naked women money and stuff, and I was all thugged out. I had my hat come back with and my baggy jeans on. My girlfriend was like, oh, you look so cool, thug, give me money for these girls. And meanwhile, I was like, you know, not getting any girls to come up to me. But when she left, they came up to me. Okay, terrific. Exactly. All right, Alan. All right, thanks a lot. Thanks for adding to this discussion. All right. It was awesome. All right. All right. Bye. Bye. Wow. I don't know what the hell is he saying. I have no idea. Well, Marian, I think you're on your own. I was trying to get you some advice, but obviously it's not working. Well, thank you. And thank you again for letting me wow for the first time on stage at Mokey's. Which one were you? I was the one that was in the back bar. You pulled the spotlight on me. I had the yellow shirt on. Oh, yeah. You had some fine fun bags. That would be I. Yes. I remember you. Yeah, that's me. Yeah, he should definitely bring you to a strip club. Don't you think so? Yes. All right. All right, Marian. We got to let you go. All right. Bye. All right. That went nowhere with her. We got to take a break, Anthony. All righty. Couple more great stories to get to today. Diarrhea in Jamaica. Yeah. Al Sharpton going to jail. What happened there? Prankster sells girls' virginity on the web. And Thirsty Monkey's stone herdsman to death. Got to be story of the day. Who the hell is turning their dial now? Stay there. We'll be back. Hey, guys. What's up? How are you today? I am doing awesome. Oh, good. Listen to this. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. I'm going to be a great guy. Uh, J.C., what's going on? Hey, guys. What's up? How are you today? I am doing awesome. Oh, good. Listen to this. Uh, I'm up here at Westchester, and it really, wow hasn't gotten up here that much. It hardly ever happens. So, me and my friend are driving up the, uh, up the DeConoc State Parkway, get up a whole carload of, like, three or four hot chicks are alongside of us. They have a wow sign in their car. It's myself and my friend. We have all over our car. We have them all over. Two chicks in the backseat. They wow us. But now we're like, we're on top of the world, real hot. So they pull alongside of us again. They roll down the window and they tell us, it's your turn. Scream. We're like, we're taken by it. We're like, what the hell do we do? And I'm in the passenger seat. So I didn't know what to do. So did you return the favor or what? Whipped out the hog. Whipped out the hog. Whipped out the hog. All right. Uh, just one more quick thing, guys. Yeah. You got to let J. Moore know, uh, what are we going to do about this? That whole deal? Yeah. Uh, a friend of mine's little brother was having a problem, um, getting girls to, uh, get to the next level. How old is, uh, this kid? Uh, 16. Uh, all right. So he goes, uh, he has, he confided in me for advice. Yeah. And I decided to pull him off J. Moore's theory. So you gave the J. Moore advice, which basically is to expose yourself and tell the lady, uh, what are we going to do about this? Yeah. She slapped his face. Well, it doesn't work every time. It doesn't work every time. It was still funny though, because the guys who were listening were trying to keep a straight face. Yeah. So, and the kid took it for real and he did it and it was, he came back in, in a lot of disappointment, but then we, we let him in on the little clue. Well, I was reading a bunch of emails from guys that have tried the J. Moore move and, uh, it worked quite nicely. So, um, if you find the right girl, I guess. Yeah. You got to feel out the situation a little bit though. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks a lot, man. Thanks, JC. Congratulations on your wow. Awesome. Thanks. All right. Our buddy, Jeff Norris checking in. Hey, Jeff, what's going on, man? What's up, fellas? How you doing? Great. What's up? What's up, Ant? Ant? Oh, man. Listen to this, guys. Get a little bummed out. You know, I didn't get the radio chick gig, but. Well, you do know you were one of the finalists, right? Yeah, I do know that. I wish Chuck the best of luck, you know, but now I got to keep an Anthony's feeling, bust that damn pin. So, Anthony could be late, but I treated myself. I went out, I bought a Dodge Ram truck, waxed it today. Don't believe in putting stickers on a new vehicle, but I had to put the O and A sign on, you know. Yeah, the wow. So I'm driving down to Garden State Parkway. I get beeped at. I get beeped at. All of a sudden, I get a double. The driver flashes your cans. The cars just stand up, and it was W-O-B without beef. No, come on. I'm telling you. Did you pay for the beer? I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. Wow, come on. I'm telling you. Did you push it up against the glass? I was going nuts. I wanted to play and be like, well, gee, he's getting a truck there, huh? It was nice, man. All right on, man. It was cool. It was cool. You guys made the truck, and hopefully we'll get up there to see you soon. Cool. Yeah, we're doing a preview of wow today. Anthony's trying to knock down the webcam that is set up in the studio. Oh, man. You guys are nuts, man. I miss you guys, man, but we'll be up soon. Yeah, come on by and say hi, Jeff. All right. Keep up the good work. All right, brother. There he goes. Jeff Norris, a very funny guy. Go see him when you get a chance. Brian's next. Brian, what's up? Hey, oh, hi, Anthony. How you guys doing? Yo, what's up? Yeah, just a little update in the sports world. It seems that you guys lasted longer at any W than Boomer lasted at ABC and Monday Night Football. Yeah, I just read that. They're letting them go, huh? Yeah, looks that way. Oh, God, I feel very bad. What was the reason? How about ratings? They don't fire them for ratings. I don't know. Maybe he wasn't as good as you. Yeah, I think so. I don't think he was very good at that. Now, is he stepping down or do they officially fire him? Well, I think they're going in a different direction, which is a nice way to say we're letting them go. Yeah. All right. Well, thanks for the news. Boomer out. Yeah. Well, how did I get on the show today? Was it Spaz not picking up? Is Spaz not picking up the phone today? Spaz is just kind of walking around. I don't know. I don't know what he's doing today. Yeah, well, that's why I got on the show. I don't know. I don't know what he's doing today. I don't know what he's doing today. I don't know what he's doing today. I don't know what he's doing today. I don't know what he's doing today. Yeah. Well, that's why I got on because Spaz didn't pick up the phone. All right, Brian. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Bye. Be cool. Bye. Breaking news, Anthony. We had to stop the show to tell everyone that Boomer's out. Aw. What a shame. And we didn't get to interview Boomer about the time you and him fought. My old classmate from back in Timberpoint Elementary School in East Islip. Way back when. I believe that was, hmm, fourth grade, maybe fifth grade, something like that. I went to school with Boomer. He moved to elementary school. We've tried to have him on the show a few times. Yeah. To talk about how you broke your arm punching him in the head. Yeah, he won't come on the show. It's a true story. I wonder if he'll remember that. Probably. Yeah. The Boomer. All right, and you want to move on to other things here? Yeah, there's plenty of stuff in the news today. Do you want to hear about Al Sharpton? A prankster selling a girl's virginity on the web. Thirsty monkeys. Stone herdsmen to death. Or diarrhea in Jamaica. I like the diarrhea story. That's pretty funny. Diarrhea in Jamaica, okay? Let me see that. All right, let me read a little bit of this for our listeners here. Diarrhea, wave, hits prisons. Supper blame. In Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican prison. Jamaican prison. That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh? And all the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper. A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than a thousand convicts suffering. Doctors are struggling frantically to contain the outbreak, which inmates have blamed on their Sunday supper. The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering. Spicy crab soup. Spicy crab soup. Chinese cabbage. Chuk Choy. It's Chinese cabbage. Rice, peas, and chicken. No, no, they didn't have the rice, peas, and chicken. Sunday meal of rice, peas, and chicken. Opie, you're getting the story wrong. I appreciate that. Oh, they should have got the rice, peas, and chicken, but instead they got the spicy crab soup and the Chinese cabbage. And some kind of vegetable taro. Whatever that is. And... Oh, no. Diarrhea. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Angry prisoners on Monday dumped scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the cell blocks in protest. That's great. So they have the bad supper. Everyone has diarrhea. Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags. You know what's great? You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys. What do they do? They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages. Correct. Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons. No. Oh my God, throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea. That's great. Treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells for medication, fearing attacks from other inmates. A special security team was going to cells to give inmates on the spot treatment if needed. This medical team had to go from cell to cell to give them treatment as there's diarrhea all over their cells. I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked and ran away. That old gag. Alright, so they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the epidemic. But there you have it. A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica, suffering from diarrhea, Anthony. Diarrhea after a bad Sunday supper. Hey! Okay, terrific. Hey! Oh, spraying mud in Jamaica. Trust me. Hey! Hey, mine goes down there. I like the new Fab Boy Slim. Yeah, we're doing ONA pictures on the show every day. Hey! An outbreak of diarrhea in Kingston, Jamaica, Anthony. Come on, we're dropping you! We're dropping! Okay, terrific. Yeah! We're dropping! Well, they must not... They must not be married. You know how it sucks when you have diarrhea anyway, and you're in the best of conditions. Imagine that, a Jamaican prison. You're losing it. Don't put the fart down there. David, what's up, man? Yo, ONA, how you doing, guys? Good, what's up, David? I figured out, I know what happened in Jamaica. The wooden was at the bottom of it. He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there. Hey! That would definitely put a damper on it. Hey! Yeah, that would wreck the party, wouldn't it? Absolutely. You suck, keep it up. Alright, David. Hey! The prison looks like the mud people from Woodstock. O.P. and Anthony. Stupid! We had guys lifting stuff with their units. Pro-test. Excuse me, taking a big, tasteless... Scotty, you've got to get our protective membrane vaginal seal back up. That's the price, O.P. I thought I had no panties on! Hey, that is the rest of the kids' thing. We had guys come in that enjoyed getting kicked in the nads. Big belly! You really don't know where the damper is, do you? That's just... Ivory has reloaded. Oh, that one... Yeah, that one just over 8 feet. O.P. and Anthony. Dopey ass show. WNEW. Having lots of fun today. Hell yeah. Giving everyone a preview of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today. Couldn't help ourselves, it's such a nice day. Tanya, what's going on? Hi, it's Tanya. I just wowed this guy like three times. It was so funny. Oh, thank you. Where are you? I was driving and he was like chasing me on the Bronx River Parkway. It was so funny. I have a wow sign and he has it like on his dirty Chevrolet something. Yeah. I don't know what it was. He kept going, one more time, one more time. I didn't know what he was chasing me for. No, we don't want the other guys chasing our ladies. He was on a chase on the Bronx River Parkway. Now we're going to the White Stone Bridge. Just enjoy the wow and move on. And move on with your lives. Three times. I cut him off at the drugs. But you're flashing everyone out there for us today? For you guys. I went to you guys. Well, we appreciate it. We're hoping all the ladies do some flashing on the way home tonight. I love you guys. You know, I miss J. Moore. On Friday I went home and I rented Picture Perfect. I watched it Friday, Saturday and Sunday. My husband is like, you're crazy. Oh, really? Crazy. I miss J. Moore though. You're obsessed with J. Moore? I'm not obsessed. You should be checking in someday this week. I miss him. And Anthony, you are extra funny. My car is turning off the radio every time I got you guys on. Anthony is off the chart today. Look, I'm funny. All right, well, keep the flashing going out there for us, okay? Thanks. I love you guys. All right, we love you. Keep up with the show. All right, man. Bye-bye. Ladies, please flash the guys on the way home today. Little preview. Yeah. Little pre-season. That's it. That's all we're saying. That's all we're trying to say. If you think about it, really. Hey, what's going on? Hey, what's happening, L&A? How are you? Not too bad. Yeah. My work van had no signs on it. Wow signs on the van. So I had a sign just written and I was going past 22 and I just looked at the sign and thought, Carla, full of girls. And they just started wowing me, man. They started showing everything. It was great. Oh, awesome. Yeah, the girls are very excited to wow today, Anthony. Yes. It's a beautiful thing. I just want to say you guys are going to love your show, man. Thank you.

Go on for a couple hours, fellas. That's great. Thank you, Joe. Just try it out. All right, man. Take care, fellas. Bye. I don't advise you to try that out, right? Dave, what's going on? How you doing, O&A? Great. All right. I'm a new listener. Yeah? And I just got wowed twice. Oh, cool. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Well, we're trying to preview it today and it looks like it's working out there. Exactly. All right. Hey, listen. Yeah? I'm going to ECW pay-per-view Sunday. All right. I'm in the second row right on TV. What would you like me to put on my sign? Wow would be good. Wow? Yes. How about we deliver Keggers and a wow sign? That could work, too.
