 Hello? Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here. That has no place on this show. I know that. OP and Anthony, more stupidity on the way. 1027 WNEW. It is OP and Anthony. Hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us. There you go. Alright, let's go to the phones and talk to a few people here. Emily! Good afternoon. Hi, Emily. How are you? Emily. Oh, holly. What's going on? Well, I heard your bit last night about Star Jones and the Fat Lady during the halftime show. And when you talk about black people, when you talk about gay people, I never get the sense that you dislike them. I know you guys are not a radio show, but when you talk about fat people, whoa. I mean, I heard the discussion, Anthony's voice, and I'm a big person, hopefully not for long. Well, how fat of a broad are you? Okay, I am 5'3", two bills. Two bills. Two bills, no doubt. Alright, let me explain the fat thing. Explain it to me. Let me, there's a reason why they're saying that. There's two types of fat people, okay? There are fat people that really, really truly can't help it. Yes, that's true. It's in their genetics. It's hereditary. It's all that. I truly believe that, okay? Yeah. And then there are fat people that are just slobs and don't want to take care of themselves and eat themselves into oblivion and gain an S-load of weight. Which one are you? Well, maybe they can't help themselves either. Well, you know what was funny? I saw last night on the news, speaking about the radiation thing up there at the nuclear power plant, they went into a bar. There's a guy that must own this bar, swear to God, had to be 400 pounds. He's talking about, you know, an earlier warning would have been nice about this nuclear steam being released. I didn't know until hours later this could be a health concern. Health concern? I'm like, dude, I'm looking at the screen going, dude, never mind the radiation, how about your cholesterol? Right, put down the hamburger and the fries. That's a health concern at this moment in your life. That's true. Yeah. I don't know why. That's why I'm losing weight, but hey, there's got to be a reason why they say the bigger the cushion, the better the pusher. Well, that's, the big people say that. No, actually a skinny person told me that. Chubby chaser, chubby chaser. That's a fetish, like being dumped on. I don't mind fat ladies because they give the best hummers because they have to try harder. Why are you losing weight? I've got to ask you something. Why are you losing weight? Why am I losing weight? For my health, because I want to be around for my kids, kids, and I want to grow old with my husband. Not to look better? That's, you know what, I just put it out of side effects. Alright, side effects. When you lose weight and people start coming up to you and go, wow, you look great, you're not going to feel good about that? Yeah, I do. I do. I was much bigger, much, much bigger. Oh my God, really? Yeah. Now, is it in your family? Yeah, well darn near. Is it in your family or you just can't put down the 20s? To tell you the truth, I don't know about my genetics because I'm adopted. I have no idea whether it's a genetic thing. I saw a lot of anger, along with a lot of pepperoni pizzas. It was, yeah, it was some over eating and mostly not exercising. Really? Eating and no exercising? Exactly. You got fat, go figure that one out. Yeah, well. And have you always been a little chubbette? When you were a kid, growing up? Pretty much, yeah. Yeah? I saw my daughter laughing in the background, I'm going to kill her. Now, what's the problem with us? Is your daughter a little pudgy? Excuse me? Is your daughter a little pudgy? I don't want to bring her into that. Well, you bet, well let me tell you, whether you do or not, you better just. She's listening right now. Get her on the right path. Get her on a diet. Believe me, believe me, we are. You know something, because there's nothing worse than seeing a couple of fat parents with fat kids because you know something? But you know what, it's not so long. Well, let me tell you, you've got to get your kids on the right path because it's pathetic. All of a sudden there's a fat kid and then the parent teacher conference and everyone's like, look at the fat parents, the fat kids, a big family of weebles walking into the school and it's embarrassing for the kid. Okay, but let me ask you a question. Why, you know, I don't get that angry tone in your voice when you're talking about it. Well, because black people can beat us up, we can run away from fat people. That's pretty much it. That is the prime reason. We know we're pretty safe. We're frightened of the blacks. Not all the time, but you know what? We know we're safe when we're talking about the blind or fat people because they can't catch us. Oh, okay, that's your reason. It's cool with the blind people. You just be quiet and watch them walk around. We sad people listen to you guys. We want to know that we're loved too. Of course, you're just sitting there all day. Emily, I believe it's in your head. It's your insecurities because Aunt Nye, we really try to make fun of everything. Whether you think it's right or wrong, that's what we like to do on this show. Yeah, I know. My daughter and I were laughing our asses off too when you were talking about Star Jones. Yeah, let me tell you about Star Jones and the reason that I sound disgusted and I'm pissed off at her. Is it just because she's overweight because she's fatty? No, she tries to come off like a diva. She's calling herself a friggin' diva. Why is that such a bad thing? Because she's not. Let's call a spade a spade. Let's call a spade a spade. And that's not a racist comment. Literally. Not a racial reference? No. She is big. She is fat. But she's secure about herself. But you know something? But don't try to pass it down our throats. She's a diva. That's everybody kissing her big fat black ass saying she's a diva. And then what? When they turn around? You think when she's not in the room they're all like, isn't Star beautiful? No, they're talking about what a big fatso she is. And how she can't get away from the buffet table. But she loves herself. I mean how many skinny girls are in L.C.A. How do you know she loves herself? And they're beautiful. She could be putting on a front and then at home she could be crying over her yodels. That could be true. She could be putting on a brave front. But how many beautiful, wonderful skinny girls that come into your studio and wow you go home and cry themselves to sleep because they think they're ugly. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. You make a great point there. All I'm saying is people are full of crap when they turn around and people like Star Jones, self-proclaimed diva, when anybody who looks at her just goes, they don't go, oh my God, on the outside. And I'm just saying this is purely on the outside thing. I'm not talking about a personality. I'm not talking about anything. I'm just talking about when you look at somebody right on the outside when you see them the first time, they're not going, what a beautiful diva. They're going, holy crap, look at that ass like a truck. But not everybody. Maybe that's your opinion, but I'm sure it's not everybody. I don't know, man. That's a lot of women. Yeah, I know. That's just a lot of women, but. When was the last time she saw her patch? And all fat people are so funny. They're all, not all okay, then people call and say you said all. A lot of overweight people are always saying, oh, accept us the way we are. We're great inside. This is how we are. But what are they all trying to do? Lose the weight. None. And if one out of a million. Is Ms. R. Jones trying to lose weight? Definitely not. Yes, she's always talking about losing weight. She never does. But I mean, if they finally do lose weight, then they go on the, get on their high horse and start talking about how all fat people got to lose weight. They're like recovered alcoholics or smokers. You can't shut them up. You know, we could ask the question today to our listeners. What's the first thing they think? What? Shaved or booby-booby? What's the first thing they think? I wish I'd have gotten in on that contest, but I don't think my kids would have approved. No, they have to answer the phone too, honey. Let's ask this question to the listeners today. What's the first thing they think of when they see a fat person? Knowing the listeners, I know what their first response is going to be. What'll it be? It's going to be, look what a fat ass she's got. I know it. I get that response too. On line eight, Mike has a little compassion. Let's get him on the conversation. Mike. How you doing? Hello, Mike. Listen, you fat slop. Men hate fat women. The sweat in between the rolls, the more pushing, better cushion. It's like a wet and wild ride. You get on top, you don't know where you're going to end up. You need a little flower to find a hole. I mean, what's going on over here with you? Wow, I thought that was going to be a compassionate call. Compassionate? Are you kidding me? I see her in the Toyota. She's almost on two wheels. No, that's not me. I mean, this is why we're slipping and sliding in the snow, because she's sliding all around, because she's so fat. Oh, my God. She sounds like a nice person. Emily, I apologize. It says on the screen, Mike loves fat bitches. Yeah, I love them so much. They should be eliminated. Oh, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sure you can't pinch an inch off of him. I'm sure you can't pinch an inch off of him. Yeah, who's he? Oh, what's that? Yes. As we descend through the depths, we see the blue whale. Emily, what are they saying? I'm getting the abuse here. What are they saying, Emily? Hello? What is that? Uh-oh, my daughter's getting very mad with you guys. Why? Why? She's listening. She's listening on the other end. How old is your daughter? She's 17. And how much does she weigh? Tell you the truth, I don't know. She's not skinny. We're not built that way. She's not skinny. You know something? You can be. We're not built that way. I swear to God. You can be. Emily. Please, please, please. I do not do rich as feminine. God, I hate it. Emily, Emily, you can lose the weight. Emily, Emily, listen to this flaming fang. Emily, feel him, feel. Try my spray. I love it. It comes in a pump dispenser, my spray, for all the men out there. You spray it on your salad, and then I toss it. Okay. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. It's sweating to the oldies. Emily, you can lose the weight. You spray it on your salad, and then I toss it. Okay. It's sweating to the oldies. Emily, lose the weight. All right, line three swears he loves fat chicks. Mike. Yeah, what's up, Bowen? Hey, another Mike. Mike, you're on with Emily. What's up? I love fat chicks. All right. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, let me let butt out butt. No, no butt. He likes the butts, the bellies, everything. That's what he means, no butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. No butt. That's what he means, no butt. No butt. No butt. No, the tits, the butt, I love it all. I love it all. Oh my God. Wait. Oh, what's going on? Joy Brown, speaking of fat people, has this guy that has to be 800 pounds on a couch in her studio right now. Dude, is that a guy or a chick with a beard? I'm serious. 800 pounds. See for yourself, Joy Brown. That's what we don't like, Emily. It gets to that point. But that's not all of us. Are you going to lay in bed and eat until they got to pull you out with something they load small mammals with? No. Large mammals? No. Oh, look at the audience clapping. He's an inspiration to us all. It's okay. He's losing the weight. Oh my God. Oh, look, there's a big fat kid. Fat kid on Joy Brown up next. Fat kid to be mocked. You know what happens to fat kids in the playground? They get beat up. Nobody plays with them. Hello. Hello. Emily, you know what's going to happen? Your daughter's 17. You know how many good years she's got left? She's only got a few good years left as far as young high school banging goes. She's not going to get... She's going to be going to the prom, right? Emily? Let's hope so. Okay. Do you want her to go into a prom dress all fat with the tops of her feet looking like she's baking bread? Excuse me. I didn't say she was fat. Excuse me. Hello. I didn't say she was fat. That's your assumption. No, she's obviously overweight, Emily. Obviously. Well, yeah, you're talking about it. You said it. You said, we're not skinny people. No, no, no. I said we're not built that way. We're not tall, thin, leggy. We're short. You're built like a pear or a weevil. No. Emily, have you taught your daughter about bulimia? Excuse me? That might work. Chris has some advice for you on line 9. Chris? Yeah, what's going on, guys? You got some advice for Emily? Wait, she's short? Let me guess, she's five foot all around? I just want to come up to some of those people I see on the street and just slap to the doughnut out of them. Well, that's not nice, Emily. You're a nice guy, too. That's not nice. I don't care. I just cannot stand fat people going around and taking up all the space on the bus. Yeah, that's a big issue. That and the train, too. I go up at school. I try to go into the buffet line to get something to eat, and they're just sitting there and they're just sitting there and they're just sitting there and they're just sitting there on the blackboard. Right? And then asking about. Yeah, well, that's a really genuine uphill-handling. So while they say that. Mm-hmm, it's pretty good, too. Yeah. Not that you pulled it because, well, it makes for relatively good doubled. No no. No, yeah, seem like we got a tree tree in the bucket. Double- unlimited water. Yeah, that's plenty of water on their faces, too. I can't believe I know you- It's so hard to get the ball rolling in this normal length of time. Well, no, she's not a fat pig, but she's got a big butt. Big butt? Very big butt. She'll move you on it. Really? Yeah. Was she that way when you got married? No, I mean, yeah, she was, but you kind of get used to it after a while. She's kind of soft and everything like that. You move into it like a big pillow. You ever yearn for the skinny ass, Danny? Oh, absolutely. You look at the chicks with the skinny little ass and you go like, God damn, what the hell? I got to hop in the sack with this thing. Her ass looks like a big sack of onions. Hello, can I ask Danny a question? Yeah, go ahead. Danny, do you rag on your wife? No, not at all. I mean, she's great. Not to a face. Not to a face. No, definitely not. There you go. Thank you. No, I really don't. I love it to death. It doesn't matter to me. It really don't. But it's going well. We have a lot of fun. Yeah, Danny, it doesn't matter to you, right? Until you're out, maybe. It doesn't matter, but you're calling. Until you're out at a strip club and you're looking at one of those asses, you know, the way an ass is supposed to look. I kind of hang with it. It's all right. All right, syndication now. Thank you. Danny's married to a fat chick and he doesn't mind. Hey, Danny. He hung on. I wanted to know if he married her fat or if she got fat. Didn't you ask that already? Yeah, he said she was a little chunky. George, what's up? Hey, what's up, guys? Hey, you're talking to Emily. First time. You're talking to Emily. Let's go. Emily, what's up? Hey, who's going to make the kids prom dress? Omar the pet maker or what? Oh, Jesus Christ. Won't even dignify that with a response. Very good, Emily. All right, now I just busted shots. No, hey, listen. I was about 128 pounds when I was going into my prom and I did it. Your phone sucks. Oh, my God. All right, Emily. I don't know what else to tell you. Well, I hope our audience didn't insult you too much. Like I said, that's what that's how to be expected. That's reality, though. That's how people feel, though. That's how a lot of people feel. And I understand that. I mean, there are people that enjoy larger women. That's fine. I personally don't like it. It's like a freak show thing. See, now my daughter's all insulted over what they said about her prom dress. And it's not even like that. Put that 17-year-old piece of ass on the phone. Excuse me. Go ahead. You do it. Hold on a second. Put her on the phone. Uh-huh. I'll bang the fat right out of that ass. Jack Hammers should be sweating. He's sweating like Tyson's date. Are you going to be his? Yeah. I bet you are. What's the lovely daughter's name? Her name is Clara. Clara. Clara? What are you? What are you? Abusive parents? You even name them after cows? Who the hell is... Hey, wait. Wait. Hey, Emily. What? What family member was named Clara that you had to name your kid Clara? My stepmother's sister. I knew it had to be somebody. What? Has she got nude pictures of you? Why would you name a kid in this day and age Clara? Hello, first of all, it wasn't my decision. It was my husband's decision. And her name is Clara Jessica. So everyone calls her Jess or Jessica? Or CJ. CJ. Why would you give someone a name where... Just like CJ from Baywatch, I'm sure. Why would you give someone a name where they automatically have to come up with another name so they don't have to use the real name? Most people call her Clara. Nobody's ever tried to call her that. Clara? That sounds like that Mayberry. Isn't that the operator? Clara? Put me through to Barney. Why should you date yourself? Oh, please. We've told everyone how old we are. We're in our 30s. Dating ourselves? They don't show Andy Griffith on TV anymore? Yeah, I'm sure. Not that we want to. No, you just stop at the Drake's commercials. Are we done with Emily? I want to talk to the daughter, man. This hate in your voice, Anthony, is so disturbing. What did we ever do to you? Huh? This hate in your voice is really disturbing. What did some fat person ever do to you? Did they kill your pet or something? Let me think back. You obstruct my view of the skinny chicks. Put that daughter on the phone. Hold on. She needs a tongue lashing. Let's play Make Clara Cry. Hello? Hey, Clara. How you doing? I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. Are you hot? What do you mean am I hot? You've got a nice body. I have big boobs? Well, I bet. The problem is you've got an ass to match, right? How big are your boobs? I don't know, Mom. Can I say how big my boobs are? You've just got to ask a mom's permission. Right out of permission. This ain't a field trip, honey. It's the 38C. 38C? Baby's got a little back. Yeah, that's a little bit of back. When you're 38, it should be a D cup. That's okay, though. You going to the prom? Yeah, I think so. You got a date? Yeah, I do. Oh, your dad's not busy that night? Are you going to give him some action? No. You're not going to give him action? Every guy wants action on their prom date. I'm not like that. I'm doing your prom, not my senior prom. Are you going to drop some tonnage before the prom? I've already lost some weight. Why? You have? Yeah. How many pounds? I don't know exactly, but I went down like three sizes. Three sizes? How much you weigh? I'm 16. You're 16? Yeah. How many pounds? I'm 16. How many pounds? I'm 16. How many pounds? I'm 16. How many pounds? I'm 16. How many pounds? I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. Take the ballpark guess. I don't know. You weigh as much as a ballpark. No, ballpark guess. Go on. What? Ballpark guess. How much? Ballpark guess? 150? 140 maybe? 140? And how tall are you? And how tall are you? I'm 5'1". 5'1"? Okay. All right. Now, you know, that's not that bad. She's not like, she walks down the street and you go, oh my God. No, I'm a size 10. I mean, I'm a little chubby, but it's not... You got any cottage cheese happening? No, no. Tell me the truth. That's disgusting. No. Are you going to watch your eating from now on, knowing that you could be as big as your mom? Yeah, I am. Because, I mean, you're in danger of doing that, you know? Oh, I know. I've been told. You don't eat a lot of desserts and stuff, do you? No. No? Want to play What's in My Pants? No. No. No. That's terrible. All right. We're just messing with you. You sound like a cool guy, Claire. Yeah. You sound like a cool little girl there. We're going to try to make you cry, but obviously you're... You're too cool for that. ...very giggly. No, I'm not going to let you guys bring me down. Hey, I like that. Is that a challenge? No, it's not a challenge. Okay. We'll break out the heavy artillery here. I know you will. Don't you worry about it. We love a good challenge. I know. I've heard your show before. No, I think you're pretty cool. We're just messing with you. All right. All right. All right. All right. Use a condom on your prom night there. Okay. Did I put my mom on it? Yeah. Did I put my mom on it? That lucky guy. Yeah, I guess. All right. He's going to be banging that big fat one on your ass. All right. What? You're so mean. I'm fantasizing. All right. All right, bye. Smack that ass. Smack that ass. Yeah. Bye, Claire. Big red handprint on a big white ass. No, she's not white. What? She's not white. She's black? No. What is she? We're Hispanics. Oh, nice. You don't sound it. She's black. She's black. She's black. She's black. Neither does Rick. Neither does Rick. So you're a sorda-recon? No, I am a neurecon. All right. Well, you guys sound pretty cool. Yeah, well, maybe. Well, now that she's got an excuse for the big ass. Probably got 100 pounds just in that ass alone. What do you want us to do when we lose our weight, go down in a wow you or what? Now that I made that father joke, it doesn't apply to the Hispanic family. Do you have big boobs like your daughter? Where do you think she got that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I check out your boobs. Yeah. Wow. I like the big boobs. I know you don't. Are they all flat on top and stuff? Well, no. Unfortunately, gravity has taken a little. Oh, boy. What, the, what, Earths or your own? Well, that's a little gravity joke. Come on. Hey, you offered to pay for the Come on. Look, it shows I know about mass intensity. And operation. Well, what's your size? 38 longs, 38 double day. What do you get? What do you sport? Sporting a 40 D right now. 40 D, huh? Right now. What does it change? Well, I am, I told you I'm losing weight. Don't lose them in those. 44 double day. That's cool.

I think someone's got to get us lunch. I didn't eat much. I had like half a sandwich. Place me and Opie went for lunch was pretty good. Had half a sandwich though. That was it. Anyway, on with the radio show. Then we had a go. What? I'm talking about lunch. I know you're talking about lunch. I was... Yeah. What? Oh boy. Why is everyone tuning in our show today? I don't get it. Hello? Hello. Why are you listening? Nothing to see here. Go away. Move on. Move on. Shut up. Why is everyone tuning in the radio show today? It's kind of weird. Phone line 212-757-1027. The fax line is 212-957-9639. In all seriousness, someone's got to get Anton and I lunch. Our lunch plan's got disrupted a little bit and we're really hungry. We can talk about the fact that we can talk about the fact that we can't talk about the fact. Yeah, we could definitely say that's twice removed. We got to go inside jokes, please. We got to move on with our radio show, Anthony. Yes, we do. Moving right along. It would be best to do that, right? Let's go to John. John, what's going on? Good afternoon, boys. How are you? How you doing? Good. New York Radio Message Board. Yeah, we talk about them all the time, yes. Has you guys allegedly... Allegedly. ...being thrown out of some press conference? What happened to John? John! What happened? Why did they hang up on John? I don't know. Who was that? Guys, chill out. You're going to get us screwed, man. Yeah, please. Ugh. So dumb. What happened? We were all having so much fun. I'm really hungry, but Mellow Outguy, yes, I'm hungry. You're going to get us so screwed. I'm starving. Anyway, let's go to Brandon. O&A! Brandon, what's going on? How you guys doing? We're doing great. How was RAW last night? RAW was absolutely fantastic. They rocked. We were sitting ringside the whole time. We were sitting to the left of Jim Ross and the King. Jim Ross! And I got to say hi to everyone we met. Everyone was really, really cool to us. We took a lot of pictures. We shook a lot of hands. Yes. And we got to thank all the psychopaths for showing up at the garden last night with just a ton of O&A related signs. I was looking for you right before the mixed folie came. We couldn't find you. We couldn't see you. Half the place knew where we were. People were screaming from the other side of the garden. Yes, they showed one giant sign of 1027, Obey and Anthony. One? There were millions of them last night. There was one huge banner as they panned the crowd. I particularly thought. Oh, know who that was? That could have been Spazz. That was Spazz. He was getting on TV like crazy. And also the guy on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. He was on the radio. That was Spazz. He was getting on TV like crazy. And also the guy on the runway kind of where all the wrestlers walk out. We saw you, pal. And you should come on by the station. We want to completely hook you up with a ton of stuff. That guy was right on the ramp that the wrestlers walked down. And he had the biggest wow sign. And he was shoving it right in the rock's face when the rock was walking up the ramp. He was right on the ramp to the right when you're looking at the jumbotron or whatever they call it there. Can I ask two quick questions? Yes. Did you guys get to go backstage after all that stuff? To tell you the truth, they invited us, but we didn't want to push our luck. We had a ton of people from the WWF coming on over and saying hi to us and stuff. We were quite flattered. And we have an announcement on our show today. The feud with the WWF is officially over. Yes. It's officially over. They treated us really, really well and gave us a ton of tickets to give away to their upcoming events and stuff. Also, we made good with those guys. You guys going to do any bits for WrestleMania for the show? Well, they're flying us out to LA for WrestleMania. And yeah, we're going to come back with all sorts of stuff. One last question. I'll let you guys go. What happened after they went off the air last night with the Rock? Did they just end or...? No, the Rock kicked the crap out of Triple H. Cool. Thanks a lot, guys. All right, man. Let's go to Mitch. Mitch, what's going on? Yeah, Opie and Anthony. Yes. I met you guys today at the Howard Press Conference this morning. Oh, no. You guys are going to get us screwed, man. Oh, my God. Why? I don't know what you're talking about. Mitch, you're going to get us screwed. Yeah. Oh, man. This is what I told a bunch of people around here. This is what was going to happen today. I know. Anyway, phone calls. Let's go on to Peter. Peter, what's going on? You're next on NAW. What's up, Peter? Come on. You! He's listening to the radio or his name isn't Peter. Dude, it's you, the one that's giggling. No, it's Steve. Steve? Well, we're talking to you, obviously. Oh, it's not Peter. I'm not going to correspond. Well, it says Peter on the screen. What do you got? It was Steve, yeah, guys. I saw you last night on Raw, about 10.30. Oh, really? Yeah, there was, right behind the booth, a fourth row midsection. Yes. Yeah, there was a couple of big wow posters there. Couple? I couldn't count all the wow signage that was at the garden last night. We've got to thank the psychopaths once again. Yeah, it looked kind of cool. It was great. My favorite sign was, I love camel toe. That was on TV a bunch of times. It was really, really funny. Yeah, there was showing a lot of good spots over there, wasn't there? Right. Let's go on a prompt for you guys. Good luck. All right, Steve, thank you. All right, take care. It was a good Raw last night, too, huh? Yeah, we had great seats, man. Got to thank WWF. They hooked us up. Yes. Jeff from Rockville Center on the instant feedback, that giant 1027 sign, excuse me, held by Spaz, was given a full view right after they showed the McFauley match. Yeah, yeah. It was all over the place. Great. All right, and we got to regroup already. How the hell did that happen? We're going to have to get another phone screener because we like these jobs. Goddamn. Dude, chill. You're going to get us really screwed. That's all I can say right now. Just chill the F. Chill. All right, we'll be back with more of your phone calls. 212-757-1027. This is Opie and Anthony. Jeff, can we get these illiterates off the airfield? Please stop. If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 1027-WNEW. Opie. Opie. I have one other tension. Opie's on the rack. I'm feeling a little bloated today. Opie, you are such a woman. Oh, come on. Opie, we're calling any of you women. Call me a fag. Whatever. You wearing a bra? Yeah. That's pretty gay, man. Opie, you are such a woman. Why am I such a fag? Usually I have to go to Christopher's tree to see that. I feel so sexy. I'm a wimp. I'm a fud. I like my vagina. Opie, you are such a woman. I have water retention. I'm feeling a little bloated today. I have water retention. I'm feeling a little bloated today. You wearing a bra? Yeah. That's pretty gay, man. I want to give Al Woker the rusty tuba. Whatever you say on this ends up on some wacky promo. You got me. 1027-WNEW. Let's get working on a new CD, Anthony. Yeah. See what Fred Durst comes up with next. Also one of my favorite bands heading into the studio. New album out later on this year for Cool. That enigma of a band. Don't know much about Cool, but god damn do they rock. Cool. It's the ONA show. 212-757-1027 is our phone number. Yeah. If you're working and you want to send a fax, 212-957-9639. Let's go right back to the phones and talk to Tommy. Tommy, what's going on today, man? What's up? What's up? Dude, I went down to WWF Cafe last night. Yeah. Next best thing to buy is a new CD. Last night. Yeah. Next best thing to be in there. Cool. I'm sitting down, all of a sudden they rip off a section, one table in front of me. Waitress says, D-Lo's coming down. Oh yeah? Yeah, cool. So he walks in with Ivory. D-Lo and Ivory sitting at a table next to us. D-Lo's woman, ugliest piece of ass you've ever seen in your life. Ivory? No, D-Lo's woman. Oh, really? Yeah. She had three chins, a big ass, and he was with two other blonde hair chicks. Very nice. How hot is Ivory in person? Very. Man, unbelievable, right? I'll tell you. I was sitting with a girl, a girl with me, and we're watching, and I said, look at Ivory. She's like, yeah, she's pretty hot. Yeah. I was like, come on, I'll drop a line, we'll go over and talk to him. Talk to him. They were very cool. Very cool. Nice. Then ten minutes later, here comes Rokishi and Too Cool and By Christopher. Oh yeah? They're all over there, man. It was a big party. I felt like king of the world. Was this after Raw or? No, actually D-Lo and Ivory, they stayed during the whole Raw. Yeah. And then Rokishi and the boys came in after. Nice. It was real cool. Oh, well, very cool. I'm glad you had a good time. Yeah, she said, you guys, big ups to you guys, she said. Yeah, we had a lot of fun with Ivory yesterday. She enjoyed coming down. We'll have to have her on again, she was a lot of fun. All right, peace out, guys. Thank you, Tommy. All right, bye. Let's go to Paul. Paul, you're next on NAW. What's going on, Paul? Hey, you know, it's Fez. It's Fez. What is up with that show? What, Ron and Fez? Yeah, Ron and Fez. One of our new shows started last night, Anthony? Yes. They were talking about how they know Opie. He gave them a good greeting. Well, I was a little hammered after Raw. I came by the station, and I wished them good luck, sure. Oh, they're terrible. I was listening to my love line, they're like, Adam Crowl will be right back, and then Ron and Fez comes on. Paul, Paul, you gotta give people a chance. You gotta give people a chance. The first day I heard you and Ant, right? You were talking about Patrick Ewing and his big nose, and he's a monkey. It was great. I'm a tape of that. Yeah, really. The first time I hear Tom, I'm like, okay, Tubby Tom sucks, but at least he's interesting. These guys are horrible. No, listen, man, you can't crucify him yet. People crucified Ant and I. Oh, my God. They continue to crucify us, but no, in all fairness, you gotta give all the new shows at least a minimum of three months. Give them a chance. Believe me, if any of the shows blow, you'll hear it from us first. Don't worry about it. Listen, .2 slash suburban trash. Come on, give them a chance, man. I was listening on the way home last night, and for their first night, I thought they did a great, great job. And that's my God's honest opinion. Oh, you were hammered. Well, yeah, but no, man. I'm sure anything sounds good when you're hammered. No, you gotta give them a chance. No one gave Ant and I a chance at first, so we're not gonna be the ones that, like, you know, trash them after their first day. All right, well, just listen to suburban trash. Three months into it, then maybe we'll start trashing, but give them plugging. Like, come on, give them plugging, suburban trash. I know. We don't hear you. Oh, we got you. Thank you. Jesus. We hope all our faithful listeners give all the brand-new shows a chance. Yes. You know, we're completely into the Radio Chicks show. Uh-huh. We got a brand-new show starting at 7 tonight. Don and Mike, starting at 7 o'clock tonight. Yes. A much, much, much, much better show than Tom Lycus. It has to be said. Come on. A much, much better show. What? Compliments our show much, much better, and we are gonna support them and give them a chance to succeed here at N.A.W. Without a doubt. Trying to build the station up. We're gonna support Ron and Fez, we're gonna support Don and Mike, and we're gonna support the Radio Chick. I didn't come in last night to say hi to Don and Fez. Ron and Fez. Ron and Fez. That's Mike. Ron and Fez. I don't know. I can't even get the name straight yet. Yeah. You know what it's like for me, though? Like, I was in the back, and, uh, I don't know. It's sort of... This place has been like the NOM or something. You see people come in, you don't want to make friends with them. You turn around, you just see the back of their skull blow out, and they're gone. Yeah, you don't know. I'm waiting. I gotta give it a little time. Well, that's how it is with the salespeople upstairs. Yeah. I don't even bother to get to know the new salespeople. Because the odds are 70% of them are gone. Yeah. But Ron and Fez, I was listening, and I kind of wanted a computer in front of me. Yeah. You know, they start talking about a lot of online stuff. I love going online. They got a good concept. I guess their official time is gonna be 11 to, I think, 3, is what I'm hearing. And, uh, they got a good concept. You know, you hang out with your computer and you web surf with the guys. You turn each other on to websites, and it was interesting for the first night. It was something definitely different. Yeah. You know? Definitely. I kind of dug it. I wish that, like I said, I had a computer, because they were talking about that voyeur dorm thing. I want to check that out. I mean, anything's better than five hours of Lovelines. Yeah. Lovelines is fun to listen to for, like, 15, 20 minutes, but five hours? Oh, my God. How much can you talk about crabs? Right. You know, what's dripping out of places. And a very sad day, Tom Likus, officially not part of our radio station anymore. Very, very sad day for us here at NWF. Actually, maybe, uh, I don't know, maybe we could take Tom out to Columbine style, okay? In honor of Tom Likus? Yeah. Come on! See ya! Bye-bye. All he had to do was give us some respect, some recognition. Show a little respect for the guys that have been through hell at this station. Hell and back. But he chose not to, so... Bye-bye. Bye, Tommy. Jimmy, what's going on? Jimmy! Jimmy. Ella? You're up, dude. Oh, what's up? It's Jerry. Jerry. Wait, hold on. Get Spaz in here. Jesus. He's got to start getting this straight, because he's out of his effing mind. Spaz, get these names right! I'm trying. I thought I heard Jerry. I see. I'm trying. I didn't hear what you were saying. It's Jerry, not Jimmy. I thought I heard... And how do you confuse Steve with, uh, one of his peeps? I thought I heard... I tried to... Because these guys will not answer us unless we, like, got their name right. Well, you got to figure this is Spaz. Oh, that's better. Spaz. One more person gets the name F-ed up. Another shot of toilet paper. Another shot of toilet bowl water. It seems to be the only thing that really works. Let's pick something different. You really want me to pick something different? Because I will. It might not be as tasty as toilet water, believe me. No, something... It might entail something out on the street. I don't want to drink anything or eat anything. Well, then don't screw the names on. Just get the names right. Get the names right. Because we look like idiots sitting here going, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve. My name's Ron. Right. You know, you're like, what? So what's your name, man? It's Jerry. I listened to Ron and Fred last night, a little bit. I thought it was pretty good. You know, I listened for... I didn't listen that long. I listened for about 20 minutes, but I figured it a pretty decent job. Yeah. We'd really appreciate it if you guys gave all the new shows a chance. Give them all a chance. Like we said, if they blow, we'll have fun ripping into them until we boot their ass. Exactly. I don't think that Steve and Sue think this is the truth, but we did give them a very fair chance. Yeah. We waited a really long time before we made our opinion on that. And we're going to do the same with all the new shows that come in. All right. So be good. Please be good. Because we really want to stay here. And if we don't get some shows that you guys really like, we're all screwed. Yeah. All right. Thank you, Jimmy. Take it easy. Jerry. Jerry, Jerry. See, it says... Sorry. Sorry about that. All right. Let's go to John. John, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on today? What's up, O.N.A.? How you guys doing? Real good. Good. You see page eight of the Daily News today? Yeah. Open up my work. Love match for two athletes, a tennis and a hockey star. Oh, yeah. Who'd it be? Anna Kornikova is going to be fouled. I'm not a jury. She already is fouled. She's a hockey twat. What is with her? Did you guys see what the restaurant owner said? What? They're going to have beautiful babies, beautiful, strong, fast, and perfect. Good Arian. You know, she was going out with that Sergey for a while. Federal. Yeah. That was only a little while ago. Dumped him for another hockey player. Imagine that out on the ice. Eight days. Yeah. Her box has seen more action than these guys have seen on the ice. That's another meaning into the crease. You know, they're on the same team? Yeah. On the Panthers. Oh, my God. That's just got to be a little much. They live in the same building in Miami Beach. Yeah. In Kornikova. That's cool. That's awesome. Imagine having that as a neighbor? Well, it's a very, very sad day for mankind in general. You know? It's almost as sad as the day we all found out that Pamela Anderson got pregnant. Like we all had a shot. Well, it's nice to dream, though, Anthony. You never know, you know? You like to think you might have a shot, a slight shot, but... A shot at Anna. Yeah, we saw that on the paper today, John. All right, guys. See you later, fell out. That's us. Yeah, that's us, all right. The sell-outs. Let's go to Chris. Chris, you're next on any W. Hey, what's going on, guys? How are you? I've been listening to you guys for about two years now since I was in high school and now I'm moving to Georgia. Me and my buddy were both moving down to Georgia, and we want to say thank you for all the years of listening, so we got a nice little psycho army playing. Oh, what are you going to do down there? Well, we're going to do it up here. I've already gotten on TV with WOW before, but that was in another country. Yeah. So, can I say it on the air? Yeah, hit it. We're going to walk up and down the streets of New York with a gigantic crowd of people. We're going to walk up and down the streets of New York with a gigantic WOW banner. Oh, when are you going to do that? Either this Wednesday or next Wednesday. Do it this Wednesday. Do it tomorrow. Do it tomorrow? Yeah, you can start at the station. Psycho Mark will go with you. Okay. Maybe we'll have like a little WOW parade. We'll get others to do it. All right. All right. Okay, what time should we be there? Just show up around, I don't know, 2.30 tomorrow. 2.30 tomorrow at the station? Yeah, we'll remember you. Okay, my friend wants to say hi to you. Go ahead. Hey, what's up, guys? What's up, man? Thanks for all the listening. I don't even know what to say now. All right, well, have fun in Georgia, all right? Yeah, you guys going to get syndicated for us? We're trying. Trying? How about getting us going away on our... No, I don't think that's possible. All right, thanks a lot, guys. See you tomorrow. All right, bro. Bye. Can we get the radio chick in here? We got to get the radio chick and Butchi in here because I think she's responsible for Kathie Lee Gifford saying she's quitting in July. I was jumping up and down the street and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to get a radio chick and Butchi in here. I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to get a radio chick and Butchi in here. I was jumping up and down this morning. I watched the Regis the Kathie Lee Show every day hoping she's going to announce she's leaving that show. And you can just tell by looking at Regis that it was the happiest day of his life this morning because he doesn't need her anymore. He's got the ABC show. There's rumors he's going to make like some like 20 million dollars. 20 million? I don't need the whore. And he was acting like he was really going to miss her. No way. I'm going to get some young hot thing in there that's going to kiss Regis' ass. You know what? That doesn't tell all the stupid stories and all that crap. Bye bye, Kathie Lee. What is she going to do? That's it. She's going to fade into obscurity. She's going to be some little answer on the you don't know Jack computer game. She's convinced that she's going to be a Broadway star now, Anthony. She had a little taste of Broadway and she really thinks that she's going to have to be a star on Broadway. I think she's going to whore her kids out to the porno industry. That'd be something. What's up, Ben? See you on the way down. See you in Cousin Pussy. Double telling. Yeah. Getting banged. Let's go to Scott. Scott, what's going on, man? Scott? Hello? What's up? You're on the radio. This is Steve. Jesus Christ. Okay. All right. How do we know you didn't just say Steve? Huh? Spaz. Well, what do you got for the show, dude? We're not going to play this stupid game with Spaz today. I wanted to talk about Kathie Lee. All right, go ahead. Well, did you hear her today on the phone? She was quitting. On the phone. I mean, on the show. She said she was done in July. Yeah, we did hear that. I think that if you're going to have the parade tomorrow, I want to join the parade and have a banner with wow and having a supporting her quitting. All right, thanks, man. That obviously was somebody who was just trying to get Spaz in trouble. Well, we got to welcome the radio chick and Butchie on to our radio show today. Look at this. We're still bowing to them, Anthony. This is like when the Jetsons were on the Flintstones. It's kind of cool. Isn't it? I love it. It's pretty funny, man. Sort of weird. Well, kind of cool. Obviously, Butchie did the fine. Well, you want to tell a story, because I'm sure you're going to tell a story. The famous letterman. Yeah, she screamed at me after I was on with the guys Friday because I told her too fast or I didn't tell it right. Yeah, who has a gun? Someone had the gun and the hand grenades. It was a kind of assault with a deadly bra, more or less. But well, you heard the details the other day. We actually were talking about Kathy Lee the day before on our show and a listener called in and said we could have her tickets if we would do something meaningful with them. So we went to her and we talked about it. So we went and we got in line and we tried to get a whole bunch of people online to help us. Maybe we could recruit some help getting people to chant Cody, Cody, or put on a bra or something. But you know what's in the audience for Letterman with Kathy Lee hosts? Big fat ass pop-western women, mid-western housewives. And the other people were a bunch of gay guys there to see Linda Etter. So anyone we tried to recruit, they were like, screw you. We're really here to see her. So then we became terrorists. We're on our own. And Butch had been fortified with what, Butch? A couple beers and some Jose Cuervo. That'll do it. Yeah, I knew I needed a bottle. Did you get them juice stuff at a bar nearby? Right next door. Really? Yeah, right next door. That's really smart. I've seen Butch young to the influence. He's a lot different. Well, there's a lot more courage when you have liquid nuts. We all know that. They have tight security there. They know exactly who you are, what ticket number you have, what seat you're in. They know every single person in that studio audience every night. And it's like getting marched into a concentration camp. There's so much supervision there. So the Letterman show is like a concentration camp. Like Auschwitz. I've been there a few times. She's 100% right. You can't move. You've got to stay single file. And they watch everyone sit. And they're like, oh, I'm going to go to the hospital. And everyone's sad. And it's a pain in the neck. So we got seated in the middle of the aisle. Then Butch said to me, we've got to do the bra thing. Somebody called earlier during the show and said, you ought to throw a bra at her because everybody says she's not wearing one anymore. She's trying to get attention. So one of the listeners called during the day when we were talking about this, before we even knew we had the tickets, and said, you ought to throw a bra at her. So then when the booze kicked in and we're sitting in the theater, I said, yeah, you've got to have, there's nothing else we can do. I'm going to have to throw a bra at her. So give me a bra. Check my notes to make sure it was one I wanted to show. I thought it was one of your old bras or something. One of those creepy, you know, bad bras. One you just wear on the house. Right, one from like 1980. So it was an OK bra. And I had to take it off flash dance style. And some old guy from Wisconsin was sitting right next to me wondering what I was doing. So then I'm braless and Butchie has my warm bra in his hand. But we were in the middle of the aisle. So we had to keep trading with people two by two to move over. And people were wondering why we wanted to sit on the end. So the first, well, all of a sudden we're friendly New Yorkers. We're like, hey, would you like a better view? Come on here to the center. Sure. The next one, the next one pair of people, I said, you know, I always like to view things from the right. Do you mind if we switch? And they're buying it. I mean, I never thought you'd get a buy in. Oh, yeah, I understand. View from the right, sure. And then the last one, Butch turned to women and said, my wife is sick. We might have to leave in a hurry. Could we have the aisle seat? Perfect. Except she didn't sit in the aisle seat. I did. I'm not the one who's sick. So then now I'm three rows from the stage. Three rows from the stage on what? The door? The left side, yeah, right where the band is. Gotcha. And there's security lined up all on the edge and all along the front of the stage. And I was... Well, the security on the edge is those pages, those college kids in sweaters. What are they going to do? Right, and one of them was a girl. And I looked at them and I said, I'll blow right by them. You could take the girl out. Yeah, just hit her with an elbow. One punch, you'll go right down. So I knew they'd be no problem. But the security guard, there were two, and one was a big black guy, you know, standing right at the edge of the stage, right next to the camera. And I knew if I was going to get up there, I'd have to get around him. And somehow I managed to do that. Yeah, and I was scared not only because I was scared for him, but I was cold and my nipples were glazing. You know, they keep that theater cold. Yeah. It's a problem. How much you want to bet Anthony's going to have another dirty dream? Oh, no, come on. I'm looking at him looking at you. Rick, turn down the heat. Yeah, look at Rick, sitting there on his staff. Rick's turned down the heat. We'll stall, Rick. We'll get another 10 minutes out of him. Lock the door? Yeah, lock the door. So Butch rushed the stage through the bra, yelled, put on a bra, radio chick rules. And it was like the raid on Anteby. Oh, yeah. And he was Hinckley and she was Reagan. And the Secret Service were taking him down. What was going on in your mind at that point? I was really, I'm thinking, oh my God. You get it. Yeah, what did I get this boy into? Yeah. Yeah. And they took him and they, he makes light of this, but it looked nasty from my perspective. They grabbed him, a couple of burly guys grabbed him, pushed his face up against the wall. That's funny to the whole audience? Yeah. They grabbed me and pulled me back. And those doors are right there, you know, up you can. I know where the doors are. And they go right out to the street. The door letterman always goes out on the side there. Exactly, when he goes out to do those man on the street stuff. And when they pulled me back, my face was to the crowd and everybody was looking at me. And I told you this on Friday, they were horrified. Like, what did he do? What did he do? So I know I had to do something. I yelled radio chick rules. And then they pulled me out the door and shoved me right against the wall outside, not in the theater, but out in the street. Where they could work you over without an auditor. They really didn't though, because I didn't resist. At this point, the hard part was over. And I'd been in trouble enough times to know, don't fight back now, what are you going to do? So I just, I put my arms down by my sides, yes sir, no sir, that kind of thing. And eventually they realized I wasn't going to cause any more trouble. They just let you walk? Well, no, they bawled me out for a while. Well, they called the cops. Yeah. They called the cops. New York City's finest had to come down, which really made me feel bad because I don't like to piss the cops off. Especially in this city, you know, I don't shoot you. But he disappeared for a while. The security sat next to me and I had to hide my recorder and my nipples. What are you just like, did they ask you? Did you know who that was? About two more bars into her song. She had then paused and picked up my bra and put it on. And she didn't fill it out. No, I noticed that. And then I'm thinking, wow, what did I do to him? He needs bail money. I got to get out of here and help him. But I was trapped in by security. So I tapped the security guy on the shoulder and I said, you know that guy, that bald guy you just took out of here? He's my companion. Companion, that's good. Not too much commitment there if they want to drag you in. It could be anything. Did you know he was going to do this? How did you get in here? Where did you get the tickets? You know, look, I got to leave, I said. They wouldn't let me leave. But finally I prevailed. And then I started running the streets looking for him. And it's hard to run when you don't have a bra. And I couldn't find him. That's why you got black eyes. I couldn't find him because they had taken him away. And I didn't know whether to go to Midtown South or way out on the corner. Yeah, they just took me to the lobby, though. They took me from outside. They didn't want to make a scene outside on the street. So they dragged me in the lobby and started lecturing me, you know, what do you think you're doing? There was kids in the audience. It was a bra. I think they've seen a bra before. They told me it was trespassing, it was an automatic fine. How is that trespassing? I guess if you go on the stage, it's considered private property or something. You weren't even on the stage, though, right? Yeah, I was on the stage. I got as far as there's a partition that surrounds the band. So I got up on the stage. Oh, my God! And I got like this, right in front of the partition. I couldn't go any further. So I just threw the bra in. It actually worked out well because if you've seen the video, it drops right at me. I know. Well, it was perfect. Well, after our road show, we were watching Kathie Lee with half an eye with the sound down and also like, wow, someone threw a bra on stage. Because we didn't hear you that day. I had no clue you guys were doing it. I thought it was hilarious. And I thought... And just like everyone that probably called the show, everyone thought it was a setup, like the Letterman people set this little bit up. Yeah. But here's the kicker to the whole thing. Here's the best part. Before we go on the air this morning, Kathie Lee makes her announcement that she's not going to continue with Regis and Kathie Lee. Wait a minute. I still get all choked up. And we get a call from someone we know works inside that show who said, I don't want you to get too full of yourself, but the bra was a factor. Oh, that bra! You're my best friend now. Apparently, she's afraid for her safety, you know, so nuts like I can get at her, you know, and for her kids, which, you know, she should be more afraid of what she does to the kids than somebody like me. She saw Butch coming at her and freaked, and then afterwards thought, why am I on the show where I talk about my personal life and I open myself up to be humiliated by mental cases like Butch? And she was teetering anyway, but I swear to God, I'm told that the bra was a factor. That's like slaying a dragon or something, you know? You did it. You're everyone's hero. Yeah, in this entire town. How great is that? I feel like we performed a public service. Definitely. Putting an end to, like, cancer or something. You know? You guys are like Jonas Sahl with polio. Jesus. We got a call yesterday for someone that said the picture's in Time magazine. Yeah, the bra? Yeah, but there's no mention of us. Well, that's still cool. The picture is everywhere, man. Go figure, they don't give credit to radio people for a gag or something. We had a hard time. I think maybe we'll get something out of it. It's a good thing that she quit today. The timing couldn't have been better. It gives us, as you know, more mileage out of the story. It lets us tell more people about it. Especially now that we're credited. I feel proud. It sucks when you pull off something like that and don't get credited. God. It used to piss us off all the time. Remember that when we shot the president? He's some other guy. But we can't thank you guys enough for helping us out, putting it on the website and getting to know about it. We've heard from tons of ONA listeners. That's a great story. You know what I'm going to do for you guys too? Hold on, because these guys hate this sweeper. Oh, yeah. Let me play it one last time. We were playing this for a while. Static. Both B and Anthony, 2 to 7. Then more static. That's true. Look at you, ONA. See, we were just meant the morning thing. Hand it over to the cart. Hand it over to the cart? That's it. We're all a team. Smash it in front of me. Give me a piece of my own medicine. I can't do it. Stop on it. Come on. It's like a snuff film. Make sure you clean your ex or something. Break it. There you go. We're officially at the clean table now. I don't want to hurt anybody. I'll show you what... You can bang those carts, stomp on them, and nothing happens, but if the heads aren't clean... There it is! Thank you. This thing will not break. Get a hammer. You want a hammer? You're asking Psycho Mark to get a hammer. That's not a good idea. What does he have? It's not going to break. Protect your eyes. He's stabbing it. This thing will not break. That's amazing. Bionic cart. The thing will not break. There we go. Who has a headache now? I know. That's what I needed. Well, guys, thank you so much. Thank you. Just following your lead. We can't believe you killed Kathy Lee. We're just the grasshopper. You are the one who learned from you. It sucks. You're going to make us try to do something to top that now. Please do, because I think I'm unofficially retired. No, man. You got a taste of it. Now you've got to keep going. It's a little like a drug. There's someone on the line that has tickets for Regis on Friday. For the Millionaire Show? You're going to have to go incognito. You're going to have to grow hair. You know we can't do anything like that. Yeah, we're really not allowed anywhere. We get thrown out. All right, guys. Thanks, guys. The radio check on before us. Check out her show. She's very, very good. Thank you, Butchie. We'll talk to you guys soon. Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding. Oh, yeah, these are the people you've got to see. You need a bed.

Paul from Rocklin on the Instant Feedback. Actually, it's Sky from Brooklyn. Sorry, Sky from Brooklyn writes, if you want to outdo the radio chick, you're going to have to have Rosie have sex with a guy. Oh, yeah, that'll happen. Not. Let's go back to the phones if you got something. 212-757-1027. Let's say hi to Max. Max, you're next on the radio show. What's going on, man? Hey, O&A, you guys suck today, really. I got a couple of good news for you. Number one, Kathy Lee. She has nothing to worry about. You know why? She has that sweatshop business to fall back on. She has no problem at all. Come time when she leaves that show, she'll fall back on that sweatshop business. All that cheap labor, no problem. She'll be making millions. And the other thing is, she was on the last night together. Was he trying to do a monologue or something? I think he was. It seemed like he had jokes written out. Don't you hate when Christopher Reeve falls on you? You don't want Christopher Reeve falling on you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. God. You hear his delivery, he was reading jokes. I gotta tell you, how about that Pamela Lee? I hear Pamela Lee and Tommy Lee are breaking up again. Really? Yeah, the latest National Enquirer has them separated again. Really? Yeah. Has he been pounding on her? They got a picture of Tommy Lee in Australia on a cell phone supposedly talking to Pamela back in the state. And there's this girl next to him completely complimented. And it looks like a recent picture. Rock. He can't drink or party in the state, so he's going elsewhere. Yeah, he goes to other places or else he gets arrested. And then they had Pamela having a picnic with her two kids with an unidentified guy on the lease. I think it was the Enquirer. The rag magazines are the best. They get the story right before anyone else. Yeah, no matter what they say, people get all pissed off at the Enquirer and stuff. I don't know. That stuff comes true. Let's go to TJ. TJ, what's going on today? I have to check out Alan Smith and show on the internet from the New York Radio Message Boy last night. Yeah, I guess now he has a little radio show where he discusses radio. It's got to be the worst thing I've ever heard. I actually made two out of the four pranks that were made last night. People were pranking him? Actually, there weren't that many. There was maybe four. I was listening from about 8.30 to about 10. And there weren't a lot. I got two on though. One was a fake name and one was my real name. Yeah, let's check it out. Well, if you want me to stop at any point, just let me know, all right? Yeah, one bit's 42 seconds and the other one's a minute and 30 seconds. Look at this. I got a 42-second radio. I have it on the computer. Okay, let's hear it, TJ. We have T.J. on the line. Good evening. Hello, TJ. I'm okay, how are you? Pretty good. I don't mind being had by... I've been had by a lot more than Opie and Anthony, believe me. But until Opie or Anthony call me, I don't really think I've been had by them. Now, is there any truth to the fact... Come on, TJ, you can come up with something quick here now. The pressure's on. I've been had by Opie and Anthony. You've been practicing this all afternoon. So here's your chance to try and get Alan Smith in. So let's go. Come on, TJ. Come on, TJ. What was that, TJ? Tell her! The Tuesday Night Hummer Club is a very large group. The problem, TJ, is that it's a very large group. It's a very large group. And so to be a member of the Hummer Club that involves me, involves women who have to really, really vocalize very clearly because you need that kind of surface area. You following me, TJ? You following me, TJ? Okay, TJ, you've been practicing all afternoon. I know you really wanted to get at me here. So you've got to make a prediction now. If we had a drumroll sound effect, I'd like to hear it now, please. Alan, stick to Rue Knaus, pal. I'm going to send Opie and Anthony fans or some of my favorite people to talk to. So that would be great. Where are you going? I'm going to go down and sniff and join this Tom Likens team. Guys, was that Tom Likens or what? Wow, he's really taking that Tom Likens persona. Yeah, I heard you say something about the dentist. That was my second thing. I called back on John from Manhattan or something and I have that one if you want to hear. No, we've heard enough. And Alan, trust me, we will not be calling your cute little radio show that 10 people listen to. Ever, ever, ever, you will not hear us on your little radio show. And guys, about half the teachers I have in my high school listen to you guys like religiously. One of my teachers came up to me and he told me that he heard me on the show a few times. So in effort to help my low grade I just want to say hello to Mr. Lynch. Very good. You guys rock. A smart guy there. Well, thank you. Pete, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on? Oh, I'm sick after what I just heard. Why? Oh, that whole thing with the Alan thing. Anyway, Pam and Tommy, they're in the paper tape. The dog bit the masseuse. I read that too. The dog bit the masseuse on the ass or something. Yeah, real quick. How gay was that thing at the wrestling? With them dancing in the ring? Well, with Rakeishi. China and the Rakeem. Rakeishi and Y2J. It was fun. I had a great time at Raw last night, I gotta say. Yeah, real quick. Come on. We're dying to know. You're gonna get a screw. Come on, you guys got some clout. You think you can get down with trouble? Nah, they're talking about it as we speak. We have clout, but someone else has more clout than we do. We're gonna recruit a Jew. Nah, that's a problem. Take care, pal. Don't worry about the Jew. He ain't nothing. Take care. Why does it always have to turn ethnic or racial? My God. We would talk about it if we truly believed that our jobs weren't in jeopardy. Trust me. Yeah, I kinda wanna stick this out a little longer, at least. A little longer would be nice. Oh, boy. Well, look at that. We gotta take another break now and get another phone screener. We've been through two today already. My God. We gave the bosses our word that we wouldn't be talking about what happened today. Yeah. All right, we'll be back. Stay there. We'll be an entity. This is debauchery mania. Frosted exams for everyone. Oh, those guys are fast! It's the Opie and Anthony show. 212-757-1027. What's that? Backline 212-957-9639. Let's see if the new screener's gonna do a good job here. Anthony, what's going on on the phone line there? Anthony, what's up? Yeah, that guy Allen Siffy, he's still saying these guys are going to mornings. That we're going to mornings? Yeah. We're not going to mornings. Sorry. Anthony, what the hell is wrong with you? What? Are you fucking insane? What are you talking about? A hundred grand? What do you mean, what am I talking about? Yeah, we are testing new owners, man. Oh, there's an old bit. There's a voice that doesn't want to hear. Where did you get that from? That was from Boston. Yeah, when we gave away the hundred grand and then... Somebody called old Matt at me for going along with the bit that you came up with, Opie. Because they didn't want you to get fired. Yeah. Okay, that's good. That's good. Alright, let's go to Tom. Tom, what's up? Hey guys. I hope you can talk about what it is that you can't talk about. Freaking people. I told the bosses this would happen to them. I hope they understand that we're just trying to do our radio show. Yeah. Go to Chunk. Chunk. Yo, ONA, my two new favorite whores. What's up, man? Is this not freaking America where you guys can't talk about this? Yeah, but within America, there are things such as, I don't know, institutions or corporations that you are in that are not a democracy. Yeah, I understand that, but it's better to hear it from the horse's mouth than to read some fabricated story. From the horse's mouth? It's really no big deal, to be honest with you. Yeah. The bosses... Rick, go ask Jeremy, our new boss, if it's okay to talk. Will do. Hey, real quick, I appear every weekend at exit 17 on the Turnpike every Saturday and Sunday. And this Friday, I'll be with the Dice Man at Chavity Hall and Bayonne and the Knights of Columbus. Thank you, Chunk. Peace! All right, Anthony, Celine Dion's suing the National Enquirer. For what? Remember, we reported, I don't know, it had to be about a month and a half ago that Celine Dion was pregnant with twins, Anthony? Yeah. Well, she's suing the National Enquirer for $20 million, alleging it said she was pregnant with twins while knowing the story was false. Really? Yes. Pregnant with twins? And she said, oh, she's not. She's not pregnant. The National Enquirer said she was pregnant with twins. The story was false. Celine feels like, well, you know what? I deserve $20 million for that. Oh, man. Like, she needs it. $20 million. Well, they've been having a problem, her and her husband. What's that husband's name? Renee. Renee. I've been having trouble getting me pregnant. Well, we can play it from the ONA archives. Yeah. When we announced that Celine was pregnant with twins. Uh-oh, I hope we don't get sued. Well, we were just reading about what we read in the paper. Yeah. So I think we're safe. I hope so, but I guess this story is now false. Celine Dion suing the National Enquirer for $20 million. All right. And that is a no from our new boss. Okay. We've got to regroup. What, Rick? Exact words? Stay the course. Stay the course. Stay the course. From the ONA archives, when we found out that Celine was pregnant with twins, even though it's not true as we're finding out today. Anthony, did you read about Celine Dion in the paper today? Yeah. I read the comments on Celine Dion. It's being reported in the papers today that she is pregnant with twins, Anthony. Now one paper is saying that she's pregnant with twins. The other is saying it's false. It's not true. I would like to think that it is true and that Celine Dion is pregnant with twins. Twins. What, did they freeze her husband's sperm or something? Did you see that? He has cancer, so they froze his sperm and she was impregnated with her husband's frozen sperm. Yeah. I guess because what kind of cancer does he have that he can't just give her the high, hard one and do it that way? Well, they wanted to make sure they were going to have kids. Right, with no good. Wow, that's something. His sperm live on. I am pregnant. Finally, we have been trying for so long to get pregnant and finally my husband's sperm slammed into my egg. Much like the mighty Titanic slammed that iceberg, splitting it open and fertilizing an egg to make another Celine, hopefully. Hopefully my legacy will live on as will my camel doll. It is such a happy moment for my 58-year-old husband, René, when he found out I was pregnant with twins. Do you know twin hippos could fit side by side in my camel doll? But these are just twin babies. All of this sperm that was swimming around in the ice, it was so beautiful. It was so beautiful. It was so beautiful. These are just twin babies. All of this sperm that was swimming around in the icy waters of my uterus. You know, most of them die. Most of these sperm never make it. They die there in the icy waters of my uterus. But two, two sperms lived on, swam, swimming, using all of their might to find the egg. The egg to cling to. These sperms are the ones that fertilize the eggs. While the others died, these sperms were true survivors. You know, my twin children can grow to adulthood and still fit out of my camel doll. That huge crevasse between my legs. You should see. Do you know the reason it had to be artificial insemination? No, why? They say cause Rene has cancer and they froze his sperm and put it in. But the truth of the matter is, he could not even feel the sides of my mighty camel doll. I am so huge. He kind of slammed it against the side a couple of times, but it did not work. So they made a sperm popsicle. Now this frozen sperm, was it as blue as... As blue as the Caprio at the end of Titanic? Yes, that's what they looked like, this sperm frozen like Leo at the end of Titanic. My sperm will go on. It was like having an ice pop in there. The frozen sperm of my husband Rene. But I can have twins now. And I will dress them in little jumpsuits to show off their tiny little camel toes. Just like mommy. My camel toe will live on. My camel toe will go on. Alright, it's a happy day for Celine and Rene. Yes, congratulations Celine. Pregnant with twins. Boy, that's got to be something for the OBGYN checking her out. Alright, Celine hop up on the table. Alright, why don't we take a look at... Oh my... Look at the size of that. Let's just... Oh, hello. Echo. Celine, wow, you got a lot of room in here. Yeah, let me... You know, I don't even need instruments. I'm just going to crawl right in and take a look around firsthand. We don't need a sonogram or anything. Wow, here deep inside Celine's womb. Look at the size of this place. Is anyone in here? In here, in here, in here. Mano-chio. Mano-chio. Oh, man. It's freezing in here. It's like a Venus fly snatch. You got to watch out. Scoop me right up. Where the hell's the light switch in here? It's pitch black. Oh my God. Goddamn. What's that, trout? I'm going to climb way up here. Yeah, I could open up a water park in here. People could just slide right back down. Wherever you are. I'm playing the snatch flute. Wow. Oh my God. What is that? Oh my God, it's a T-Rex. What the hell's that doing in here? Let me just walk over here. Oh my God, this is disgusting. Who the hell's that sitting there? Buddy Edson, what are you doing in Celine's womb? Oh my God, look, it's that little Kitner boy from John. He wasn't a shark after all. You're swimming, you got sucked up by Celine's huge cage. Can we see your stuff? Oh, hey, how you doing? All right, we're just going to go for a little pap smear here. It might feel a little pressure. There we go. I've got to get another one of that. Wherever you are, I believe. All right, I've got to get out of here. Oh my God, look at this. This place is huge. This place is huge. It's coming right for us. I don't even know what it was, but I'm safe and sorry. Oh, very good. I've got to do a little bombing. I see a light. Oh my God, it's a tractor trailer in Celine's womb. Oh, there it is. There's the little baby. Look at the camel trot. Can you walk out of her womb and step out of her pants, please? I'm going to get out of here. I'm just coming up to the end of the aisle. I'm not going to go in there. Oh my God, that's amazing. I feel much better. Hey, it's coming after me. Is that a Apache attack helicopter? All right, well, there you have it. Celine having the twins. Congratulations to Celine and her husband there. Maybe that's where the CBS FM broadcast from, Celine's womb. Elizabeth. Yeah, why don't you guys diss someone who deserves to be dissed? What is your problem, man? How old are you, Elizabeth? That's irrelevant. We're in the middle of a commercial break. What's your problem? Why don't you guys make fun of someone who deserves to be made fun of? Like Backstreet Boys? Elizabeth, how old are you? No, why do you make fun of... Are you pissed off because you just made fun of Celine Dion? Yes, I am. I am a huge fan of your show. I've been listening for a long time. Blah, blah, blah. Why are you defending Celine Dion? No, no, no, you guys are so cruel. Why do you guys pick on someone? Do you know anything about her? She at least has been honest about who she is and where she comes from. She's been honest about other people. Honest? Yeah. That husband of hers had an eye on her when she was like 13. Right, and the record... Don't you find that disgusting? Yes, I do, but the record executives made them be quiet about it. And I do think it's disgusting, but I don't think he was... What? What? I don't think he was diddling her when she was 13. How do you know? I don't know. I think that whole... At least she wasn't putting lines up her nose. The whole story is disgusting. Relationship is a little questionable. Yeah, he was in his mid-30s. She was like 13 when he first met. And what relationship? And like everyone has, we had a questionable relationship. Come on, guys. Why do you make fun of someone who is... Elizabeth, shut up. We're in no mood to listen to you today. No. We're in no mood. You're obviously not a fan of our show. I'm a huge fan of your show, but you guys really... We crossed the line by making fun of Celine Dion? Yeah, no, you just... You know what? The whole WWF thing that you guys pussied out and gave in and went through the show pissed me off. I've got to ask you how old you are. Come on, tell us. Why? Just because I'd like to know if you're a very stupid adult or a very intelligent kid. Why am I stupid? Tell me why I'm stupid. Because I don't understand why you're sticking up for Celine Dion of all people. I'm sticking up for people. You know who I really want you guys to make fun of? Linda. Yes. Talk to Elizabeth. Shut up. It's a radio show. Get a grip. I am so cool and chill. That's not the point. These guys just... I don't know. Today they just pissed me off. It's the only thing that pissed me off. You're like 13, right? No, I'm 9 1 2, actually. Why do you let the children on the show? She's about 19. Really? Yeah. Elizabeth, how old are you? 19, right? You can just keep guessing. Linda, what do you have for Elizabeth? She's got to get a grip. She's a public figure. If you guys want to make fun of her, Celine can deal. Yeah, please. I'm sorry. She annoys the hell out of me, too. I'm not saying she annoys me. It doesn't annoy me. I'm saying that these guys... Boy, Celine, can you punch your chest one more time for me? Just go off on... Why don't you go uncover Rosie's past and get your stuff on Rosie? Thank you, Elizabeth. We've messed with Rosie. We've messed with everybody. I know. Do you know who you should mess with? Mariah Carey. Mess with Mariah. Stop. We've messed with Mariah Carey and she's sloppy. She's a sloppy trash. She's a sloppy trash girl. We've talked about it, sure. She's from my high school and we've talked about it. What else? I want you to do a whole bit on her, then. If you're going to get... Give fair play to people that... Why the obsession with Celine Dion? Do you want to munch her pots or something? I am not obsessed with her at all. You want to bump donuts with her? What's the deal? That's it. You figured me out. You want to bump donuts with that skinny bitch? Yeah, that's exactly what it is. With that camel toe? You're right. You like the camel toe. What is your problem? I need to know what your problem is today. You guys, just piss me off today. You want my camel toe, don't you, Elizabeth? Elizabeth, we're in a bad mood to begin with today. We don't need your crap. Come on, guys. I listen to you. Put on a strap-on and slam into me like the mighty Titanic slammed into me. Just piss me off. I just... You know, you would... Elizabeth... You've pissed too many people too many times. Are you on the rag today? Yeah, that's it. They got a heavy flow today? You're flowing like the water was flowing into the watertight compartments of the mighty ship. I shouldn't let you guys get the silkset, really, is what it is, but... What type of tampons do you use? People wish it here. You don't realize it's influential. OB, designed by women gynecologists. No applicator, you use your finger. What kind are you using today? Elizabeth, do you have seagulls following you today? Are you flying on the wings of a maxi? I don't even... I don't understand why you're so angry over stupid Celine Dion. I'm trying to make a point to you that it's just... You're laughing in your head. Why don't you talk about something of substance and then go off about it? We talked about the whole Diallo case. What kind of news is it that... We talked about addiction yesterday with Dallas Strawberry. Talk about Diallo. Go off on... You know, I mean, talk about... You don't even know what's going on in small burbs on the... About Diallo. There is a wake. There is an aftermath coming to this. White kids, white middle-class kids, it's just enough. I'm trying to get you by train. You guys are going to be in the car. I'm trying to get you by train. You guys kicked me off tonight. You both are listeners. And I'm going to try and... I'm going to go again. I'm just... That's the end of it. Elizabeth? Yeah. Go to hell. Thanks, Alphys. There she goes. Hang up. She's all upset. Hang up. Bye-bye, Elizabeth. You're on the rag today. It'll pass, okay? Yeah. You'll call and apologize. No, I won't. Yes, you will. Elizabeth, I've got to hang up. Tom Green's on the line. Much more important person than you, you bitch. Tom Green. Hello? Tom? Tom, is it you? Yeah, how you doing? Is it you? Tom? What's happening? Are we on the radio right now? Yeah. We're on the radio, Tom. We're actually on the air. Hey, I almost got your voice down. What's up, bro? We're big fans. Oh, wow, thanks. That's exciting. You know, I'm excited today. Do I sound excited? Yeah, you do. You sound very excited, yes? Because I'm excited because we have this... Because we have a big special on our show tonight. Yeah, I know. You got Monica Lewinsky, I hear. Yeah, it's, you know... Did you get a Hummer? Did you get a Hummer offer? What's that? Did you get a Hummer? Did I get a Hummer? Yeah, you know, a Hummer? No, we didn't get a Hummer for this one. If you're that close to Monica, you should get... You should get, you know, whip it out. See if she'll hobbit. Did she get... Does she like Hummers or... No, she loves it. I didn't even know she liked Hummers. See, I screwed everything up. I didn't even know that. Not the vehicle, Tom. We don't have like a lot of sort of... We don't have a budget for like researchers and stuff. We didn't even know she liked Hummers. It looks like you don't have a budget for much on that show, but we love it, man. We're just gonna, you know, make it up as we go along. What's the term they use in Canada for a BJ? See, in America, we like using Hummer. Oh, really? Oh, okay, I've never even heard that term. What are you doing with the fat whore? Hey, hey, Tom! I thought you guys were talking about the car. Tom, it's not. It's Andrew Dice Clay. I enjoy your show. What are you doing with the fat whore? Huh? Is that really Andrew Dice Clay? Yeah, he stops saying every so often. Yeah, he has nothing better to do, Tom, so he stops by our show. You got Monica Lewinsky! What do you do with the whore? Huh? Yeah, I know, I was excited. I took her to my home town. You banged that fat ass, Tom! Is that what you do on your show? You bang a big fat ass! Wow, listen to that. What are you guys doing there? Is that OP or Anthony? That's actually Andrew Dice Clay. Oh, is it really? Yeah. It wasn't OP doing an impression? I tried dropping to do plugs for my gigged bananas and rascals and I'm playing I'm playing ass wipes up in Poughkeepsie. My career's flying. I once sold out Madison Square Garden and now I can't sell out the Olive Garden. Oh! Seriously, which one really was it though? That's actually Dice. No, it's not. No, it's not. Don't you hear us all talking at the same time? I was drinking water while Dice was talking. Oh, it's like a ventriloquist. Yes, exactly. I understand. I'm not stupid. I don't know what Homer means. So Tom, tell us about the show tonight, please. I took Monica Lewinsky up to my home town for five days. Yeah, you're Canadian, right? Yeah, I'm from Ottawa. Ottawa? Yeah, it's Ottawa. C-A-W-A is a Native North American Indian term for a man who chews tree bark. I took her up there and we actually went around the town looking for fabric, but the fun thing that happened was the Canadian media kind of went crazy because they wanted to get a picture of her. So it turned into the Tom and Monica Lewinsky get chased by a crazy reporter's show. Were you finding fabric for her bags? Yeah, she's got this handbag company that she's doing. We're sort of... We actually are introducing a new handbag line. It's called the Richard and Mary Jane Green handbag. Oh, no. My parents. Yes, of course. We went into my parents' room sometimes at 4 o'clock in the morning. Yeah, we've seen that. We like to have... The Cow's Head is my favorite episode ever, man. A message from Don Corleone! Thank you. We brought Monica Lewinsky this time into the room. Yeah. And my parents were surprised. Did your father get a Hummer? Yeah, you should have got your father a Hummer. A Hummer? I like that kind of... I'm just going to ask some here. Chris, you're from Wisconsin. Have you ever heard the term Hummer before? Really? I don't know what that is. How about this? How about hob some knob? I've heard... I mean, you said hob some knob. Hob a knob. Yeah. Yeah. God, was your dad freaking when he wakes up and there's Monica in the bedroom? He looked surprised. I guess. Yeah. How's she looking these days? What's kind of fun about the show though is that people are going to... They're going to kind of look at Monica Lewinsky a little differently. I think it's the first time you've really seen her. I mean, it's an hour-long special and it's just me and her sort of traveling around the city and she's actually pretty funny. You can see the fun side of her. Yeah, the fun side instead of a back side. Huh? So she's selling bags now? She's selling bags now. Yeah, she's had a few across the bridge of her nose. I guess she's an expert. Oh, Dice, come on, man. Sorry about that, Mr. Green. That's fine. He's got to calm down. That's fine. Doesn't get out. Hey, how are you liking LA? Because you used to be right around the corner here in New York and you wouldn't come and see us live for some reason. I don't think I was ever invited, actually. Yeah, we called up MTV and got them all pissed off. We said, we know Tom Green's there. Get him on the phone now. We want him to come over. And they're like, you know, you got like 50 people between you. So they're passing the buck and they wouldn't give you the phone. Yeah. Wow, well, that's too bad because we're not around the corner anymore. I know. I know. How are you liking LA, though? It's pretty warm. It's warm and it's pretty fun. I mean, I was just up in Canada and down here it's a lot warmer. So that's nice. I got to ask you about the last week's episode. It was an old tape when you were on a talk show and you brought the dead raccoon out. Oh, yeah, that's true. I mean, I was just up in Canada and down here it's a lot warmer. So that's nice. And why didn't you puke? Well, I'm used to the smell of rotting carrion. Did you see that episode? Yeah. It brings out the raccoon. After a while you kind of just get accustomed and acclimated to the smell of rotting flesh when you're around it a lot. But we, it was actually a three month old carcass too, I'm proud to say. Yeah, it was a three month old carcass. And you were in the car. Yeah. And you were in the car. Yeah. And you were in the car. It was actually a three month old carcass too, I'm proud to say. I know, I know. Yeah, you do a couple of things with dead animals. And when you brought the cat to the vet and it was dead in the carrion, it was a dead cat. I mean, there's a reason behind that. Can you save my cat? You know, we go on all these road trips with the show. We're always kind of driving and sometimes we kind of run out of ideas because we're making a lot of stuff up as we go along. And there's always these great prompts just lining up. Just dead prompts. You're driving around with a video camera making wacky TV and you see a dead moose. Yeah. You pretty well have to get out and hump it. I saw that one as well, man. You can't really look yourself in the eye in the mirror that night if you don't get out and hump it. Anytime, you've got to be making some good money these days. Why the bad phone? Does the phone sound bad? Because I have a hard time hearing you guys too. It sounds like one of those Sports Illustrated football phones. Yeah, I know. I mean, I don't know what's going on. A second ago, I don't know, it's a Panasonic. And a second ago I hit a button on it and it started playing radio out of the speaker. It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to turn it off. Maybe I'm just stupid. I don't know how phones work and I don't know what Hummer means. Why'd you leave New York though? It was just kind of, I don't know, I love New York too. It was just kind of, ended up the whole show ended up moving out here. I'm not even sure of the reason to be honest. You just left. You just left. You had it with the New Yorkers, huh? No, I mean, I was enjoying it a lot because there was a lot of people over there. I mean, a guy in Long Island tried to hit me with a hammer once. That's not a reason to leave. I mean, that's great when people are trying to hit you with hammers. That's sort of a free bit for us. Right, right. Sometimes we have to head up to the East Coast a little bit on road trips now just because people are a little bit too relaxed down here. Will we be seeing any more of you puking? Jesus Christ, you have more vomit on your show, man. That's pretty frigging rank. My favorite Tom Green show is when you drove some of the audience members home. Out to Rockland. Rockland County and then you were taking showers and stuff. God damn, was that funny. They all got mad at me. Yeah, they all got mad. They were calling the cops on you. I don't know what, it was kind of a weird sort of transition that night because everyone was sort of all gung-ho. They were all a bunch of kids that had come down to our audience and they were all really excited to be getting on our little school bus with a little trip. I guess it took about six hours to drive everyone home. They all lived in different parts of town. By the time the last kid was there he was ready to kick the crap out of them. Wasn't it like 3am or something like that? Yeah, it was pretty well 3 or 4 by the time we got the last kid home. That was very, very creative and very funny. Hey, what happened on the Donnie and Marie show recently? You were cutting up their wardrobe or something? Oh yeah, because part of it was sort of the whole fabric thing. The whole fabric thing. Monica wanted some fabric for her handbag company so I did cut the back of Donnie and Marie's jacket off. I think we're going to make a handbag out of them. Very nice. Handbag. Alright, so the show's on what time tonight for everyone that doesn't know? 10 o'clock on MTV. I mean we're really excited about it because it's the first time we've had an hour long show. It's also the first time we've had a high profile guest. Oh yeah, this is huge. Miss Lewinsky, so it's exciting. Do you kiss her? Do you kiss her on the mouth? I don't actually. Well, I don't want to say. Tom, I think you failed. I think you should have got someone a Hummer. I think you owe it to your dad. You should have got your dad a Hummer. Chris, from what? What's a Hummer? You know, the hob of a knob Hummer? Oh, come on guys. A knob hobbin'. Or you should have had her bumping donuts with your mom there. I really didn't know, but I think you guys, when you see the show, when you see the show, I think you probably won't be as hard on Miss Lewinsky. Hey, you said hard on. I do, I do, right. Sitting here with the former head writer of Beavis and Butthead and they just said, you said hard on. He knew, he knew, he was saying it at the same time as you. Oh really? Yeah, he worked, our head writer was, he used to be the head writer of Beavis and Butthead. Oh really? Yeah, Chris Brown from Wisconsin. Wow, he's like a hero. He's another one of our heroes. Hey, Tom, you can't be a stranger, man. You gotta call our show from time to time. We got a lot of fans that listen to us. Oh, well, okay, thanks for... You can't wait for someone like Monica Lewinsky to come on your show. You gotta just call us every once in a while. I will for sure. Let us know what's going on. I will for sure. All right, man. All right, Tom. Thanks, man. We'll check it out tonight, all right? Yeah, thanks, Coach. Thanks, Tom. Tom Green, everyone, from MTV. We gotta take a break. We were in the middle of commercials there, weren't we? Yeah, we were. All right, we'll be back. Stay there. Well, that was cool, huh, Anthony? Oh, what? You never know who's gonna like call the radio show. Tom Green, of all people, had no idea he was calling it. Yeah. If any other celebrities want to call the show today, by all means pick up the phone and dial away. We'd love to hear from you today, okay? We love you, celebs. Or if you're in the area, just stop on by the show. Yeah, pop in. Yeah, pop in. We don't care. All right, phone line 212-757-1027. We're in the middle of spots here, Anthony. It's Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. We've talked about Stacker 2 for over a year now. Sorry, I'm eating. Are you gonna need a Stacker 2 after slamming down that huge sandwich of yours, Anthony? No, I don't think I'm that fat a guy. No, okay. But if I was, I would take Stacker 2. I'm just really famished after being chased away from where we were eating after a mere couple of bites of my sandwich. Yeah, we did have lunch plans, but they were rudely interrupted today. Oops. Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, Anthony, it does three things. It burns the fat off your body. It crushes the cravings to snack in between meals. And it gives you a boost of energy when you're feeling a little sluggish late in the day. You know what I'm saying? It adds up to losing weight. Losing weight. Losing weight. Lots of people have tried. Thousands of people, matter of fact. If you want to try this for yourself, give Stacker 2 a call. Their phone number is 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Or check them out on the internet, www.stacker2.com. Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Thousands have proven it works. Give them a call, 1-800-LIGHTLINE. What is it gonna take for us to piss you off to the point where you're gonna change the station? That's what I need to know. Shut it. Anthony. It sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it? That's gonna be trouble for both me and Anthony. We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity. 1027. WNEW. I like it. I like it a lot, man. We're always into checking out new stuff. That's a New York City band called Dope. And everything sucks, Anthony. That's pretty good. I like the groove. Sounds a little bit like Zombie, right? Yeah. A little bit. They've been on tour with Megadeth, Orgy, Static Axe, Cold Chamber, and Power Man 5000. Which is Rob Zombie's little brother's band. And Everything Sucks is off their debut album. Felons and Revolutionaries, Anthony. Now available at all 63 Sam Goody locations in the New York area. Dope. Check them out. All right? Pretty good. I was only gonna play like a piece of it. Put it rock and we had a... Yeah, you can't cut that off. No, you can't cut that off. I mean, the song's not as good as We Deliver Kegger's and a Sandman. No, that has a nice little attitude there. Yeah. All right, let's go back to the phones. If you got something for the show, 212-757-1027, facts line 212-957-9639. Once again, I want to thank Tom Green from MTV for checking on in today. The lovable, flaphead Canadian. He has got an hour long show tonight with Monica Lewinsky. A special, a very special episode of Tom Green tonight on MTV. I bet they told him he couldn't do a few things that he probably wanted to do. With what? Monica? Yeah, you know, she's got people that say, you know, she's got a lot of people. Say, you know, don't mention the BJ. Yeah. You know, gee, what made her famous? She BJ'd the president. Oh, but don't mention the BJ. Imagine that. You're famous for something. Now you're all over TV and everything. You're famous for a BJ. And now you can't mention the BJ. To that person. And that's something. It would suck. It would really suck. Yeah, just talk about it. Hey, Monica. So how was the BJ? You know, that would be funny. Tom Green talking like that. And then he grabs a cow udder and starts maybe trading techniques. Oh, man, I want to talk to him about that. Yeah. The sickest Tom Green episode when he was sucking on the cow udder. It looked like a guy's thing, man. Yeah, it looked like he was doing the deed. I'm very surprised MTV allowed us to talk to Tom Green with all the abuse we send their way. Maybe they forgot. We better remind them. Maybe they know who reaches the 18 to 49 male demo. Explain it to them. All right, let's go to Karen. Karen, you're on NW. What's up? What's up, Opie and Anthony? Hello. How are you doing? Pretty good. Opie, I saw you on the wedding on Friday and I was going to ask you. I kind of chickened out because Sandy was standing right there. But I want to ask you about Lesbian for a Day. You want to be lesbian for a day? Yeah. This girl is hot, Anthony. I was at this wedding on Friday. My cousin's wedding. Really? I didn't know you went that way. She related. Opie was kind of a Walsh flower a little bit. He didn't really dance that much. But he was kind of crass because of the road show, I guess. I was exhausted at that wedding Friday. I was surprised I was still on my feet. I danced one dance. You had like 30 seconds. Well, I didn't even talk about the wedding, Anthony. My cousin Jimmy's wedding on Friday. It was a great time there in Smithtown. I was really, really tired. But there's a couple things I want to mention. First of all, to my relatives. You've known me my whole life. You don't have to sneak pictures of me to bring back to your coworkers. Just ask me and I'll take a picture with you. That's pretty funny. Do you have that happening at distant relatives and stuff? No, most of my relatives will just drag me over. My cousins and stuff will put me in my place anytime, and my uncles. But it's like the distant relatives that I see maybe every five years. Snapping pictures. I'm eating some of the wedding cake and stuff and all of a sudden I see a flash. My brother goes, you see that? Uncle Wunt Wunt is sneaking pictures of you. I'm like, why is he sneaking pictures of you? Just ask and I'll take a picture with the guy. So that was going on. Then I got talked into going on the dance floor to do one dance with my 90-year-old grandma. We had the cute grandma dance where she was dancing on the dance floor, Anthony. And then all the... I have to speak in obvious defense. He did not do the electric slide or anything like that. So I'm just sticking... Karen, did I do any of that? No, he did really seriously only dance like 30 seconds to a minute. Yeah, and that was just for my grandma. She's going to be 90 in like two months. They thought it would be cute to get all the grandkids dancing around grandma. There you go. So I did that for a little while. But they started the conga line. Yeah. And a bunch of people were laughing at me because they all know how I feel about that stupid dance. Yes, the conga line. And they had to take it out of the reception hall and the hallways and stuff. The conga line's wacky. It's going out into the hallway. Look, oh no, it's in the kitchen. No, I... You have to admit that DJ was pretty good. Yeah, he was cool. He was all right. Did the DJ come and talk to you? No, no, no. That was pretty good. He was... They do that. He was really, really loud though. Yeah, he was. He needed to turn down his microphone just a little bit. We could hear you quite nicely there. Yeah. When I was the best man at Joe Curry's wedding, the DJ comes over and he gives me the mic for the speech and goes, here you go. He goes, try to hold it a little bit away from your mouth and tip it down a little. I'm looking like, dude, I think I know how to use a microphone. It's like, thank you, Skippy. That's like my job. I don't tell you how to put the damn fryolator basket back in the oil. So, Karen, you want to be a lesbian for a day, huh? Sure, why not? You want to come down here so Ann can get a look at you? Now? Why, you're close? No, I just had some work to do, but I can put it off. Not a relative, is he? No, I'm his cousin's best friend. Oh, I thought you were doing my cousin. No, no, no, no. Actually, I'm doing his other friend. Oh, wait a minute. You're doing Ope's cousin's friend? Okay, so no, there's a long story. You go to the wedding with the cousin? Anthony, there's a long story there. I actually met Ope's cousin on the internet of all places. Who, Michael? Yeah, Michael. What, is he a serial killer? No, he's been in here. I'm just saying. He has like five screen names and stuff, and he goes and tries to pick up chicks. Oh my God, the internet. He's definitely related to that. He gave it up. He gave it up. He went to the Navy, he gave it up. He's stationed in Chicago now, Anthony. Ah, he's in the Navy. So he picked you up on the internet? Yeah, he picked me up on the internet, right? And then I meet his best friend a month later, and I start going out with him. Actually, I broke up with Michael to go out with his good friend. They're not friends anymore because of me, but whatever. Did you hob my cousin's knob? Yeah, actually I did. Oh, wow. He's probably going to listen to this. I don't want to be like... I'm making tapes to send to... Oh, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are. He misses the show. I'm going to send a few tapes to Chicago. Oh, wow. You really hob this knob? I was dating him for like a month before I met Matt, his other friend. And then what happened with this Matt guy all of a sudden? I'm actually still with Matt, and it's going to be, I think, a year and three quarters. No, but I mean like all of a sudden you met Matt, and then what made you stab Obie's cousin in the back and go off with Matt? No, actually the relationship wasn't really going anywhere. We just kind of like... We liked each other, but there wasn't anything happening. Does my cousin have the family blessing? I don't know. I haven't tasted any other family members, so I really wouldn't know. No, I mean like the family blessing. I mean, how big is he? Oh, he's... I don't know. In my experience, average. There you go. I'm not... I feel like more than average. And now with the new guy, have you given up the balloon knot for him? Actually, yeah. All right. All right. I'm making a tape right now and I'm going to send it to him. He lives in Long Island and I live in the city. So we don't get to see each other, so like in honor of the Tuesday night hummer, which he never gets, I figured I'd be lesbian for a day. Very nice. Give up the balloon knot. This girl's giving up the balloon knot, man. She's a wholest. And she's hobblin' her own knot. Maybe like once or twice, but special occasions. Yeah, that's a special occasion. Special occasions like Christmas and leap year, which is today, so get your ass down here. Yeah, it's kind of like turn around, honey, hey, why not? Groundhog's Day, you see if it pops out, have a shadow or something. Every Monday. Well, very nice. Yeah, you can come on down. All right, cool. And then you can be a lesbian for a day. Okay, awesome. I'm going to need your reaction, though. Reaction? Yeah, get your reaction to the studio. You'll have enough erections. You know what? I mean, this show is going nowhere fast today. If you want to get down here today, we'll set up lesbian for a day tonight. No problem. All right, if there's any girls out there, I did see this girl, Karen, at a wedding last Friday. She's definitely cute. She's got some big fun bags. Yeah. What size? It depends, because I go in and out, but I'm like 36C to 38D. All right. How tall? 5'9". Karen, I got to be honest. Yeah? Someone smelled really bad at the wedding. You're not implying. I don't know. Did you have a little odor going on? Actually, I don't have a sense of smell. What? I wasn't born with one. You weren't born with a sense of smell? I wasn't born with a sense of smell. I died. Defective olfactory, whatever. He explained it to me a long time ago. Okay, that was not great. You wouldn't even have to say it. If it was me, I'd apologize. It would be ugly. I'm sorry. That would make sense. I don't think it was me. I showered and I deodorized. You could just blast farts in front of her. She wouldn't know. You can't smell anything? I can't smell anything, dude. So... There's only one thing I can smell. I can smell a room filled to capacity of smoke. If a house is burning down, I'll know it. But I'm hopeful it'll kick in before... Hey, screw the Lesby for a day. Someone go out and get some White Castle, man. This is more fun than doing Lesby. So, like, when you cut one, you know, when you blow... I don't want to cut one. I have no idea. But if you do, you don't even know what it smells like when people are going, oh, that's terrible. You've never smelled anything in your life. Never smelled anything in my life. So you don't even know what it is to smell. Nope. Do you taste stuff? Yeah, see how it works is, like, the part of my nose that would work when I smell is defective. So, like, everything else works as if I have smell. But when it's... I'm supposed to smell, it doesn't work. I wonder if she gives up the balloon knot. That area is nothing for her. You know? Guy, girl, it doesn't matter. It's all the same to her. You obviously would have no problems giving hummers then. Rusty trombones. Rusty trombones you could pretty much go for. I've actually never done that, but... Oh, wow. You're holding out. I'm holding in. Well, all right, let's try to set you up. Any girls out there want to go out with Karen today on the Lesbian couch? How old are you? You're like 20? 20. I was going to say 21, 22, yeah. Yeah, I couldn't go out to Russia. I wanted to come out, but... All right. You don't do anything cool for us. 20 years old and no sense of smell. That's great. Well, so far we have no takers, Karen. I can't understand that. Aw, man. She's definitely cute. She can't smell. Do you get, like, handicap plates for that or something? That seems like something that's kind of a handicap. We should have her smell stuff that we would never smell. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm sure someone just blasts one right in her face. Rick will do it. All right, Karen, hold on the line. Okay. All right. We're trying to get Lesbian for a day happening today. The Lesbian couch hasn't had a workout in a while. I bet Stinky wasn't here. Karen is definitely a good candidate. She could rub his armpit in her face. She sounds like she'd be a lot of fun. Any ladies in the area that want to come on down, we want to try to make this happen today. All right. Rock. I can't read that, Rick. You can read that. What did he write? Just over the top. Chris from Jersey on the instant feedback. Oh, Rick. I believe what Rick is trying to say is that with Karen having no sense of smell, hygiene isn't much of an issue with the girl if she wants to come down here. Oh. Well, she came over with a bunch of friends to meet me at the wedding. Yeah. And someone in that group really smelled. Like what, B.O.? So I couldn't get past the smell to check her out until later on. Was it upper body smell or lower body smell? It definitely smelled like underarms. Upper body. Upper body. So we got instant feedback here from Chris from Jersey. All psychopaths. All psychomarch psychopaths. Yes. Attention. Channel 2 and Channel 4 are going to be on campus of Mount Claire State University. There is a fire in one of the dorms and the students are complaining about unsafe living conditions. Channel 2 and 4 will be at the campus of Montclair State University, probably starting at 5. Yeah. You know what to do. You know what to do. Rock. The psychopaths, we're out in force last night at Raw as War at the Garden. I want to thank all you guys for helping our cause, okay? Sure thing. Yeah, we need our first live wow on TV. We got to bring this to the next level. Females. We need some females to do some wowing when you see the live shots going on. Live wow. Yes. All right? Moral and the other thing. Yeah. I got to go back to Karen. No takers yet. Oh. Karen, it's not looking good. Oh, no. Maybe I made you sound too, like... Too sweet or something? Not too sweet. No, I think the whole body odor thing might be turning off some ladies. But I can't say for sure it was you. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to go with that then. Have you ever kissed a girl? Oh, absolutely. You have? Actually, my first experience, I was 16 and I was actually dating, quote unquote, whatever you can call it in high school. This is a 19-year-old. And she, you know, it was the whole like she taught me everything I know, showed me the ropes kind of thing. And then when she was bored with me, she just, you know, didn't call or nothing. Oh, really? Yeah. I was kind of scorned, so I didn't go that route for a while, but it's definitely been a while. Would you get real wild today? Yeah, sure, why not? All right, bring in the lesbian couch, boys. Well, Karen, get your ass over here. We'll try to figure something out. All right. All right. All right, no problem. Hold on, Rick's going to talk to you. We're going to do something. Okay. Sounds like she's willing to have some fun, Anthony. Yes. And we could use some fun today, can't we? Yes, we can. Relax, Psycho Mark, you ass. It's all wound up. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be back. Our phone line, 212-757-1027. Opie and Anthony. Who would you rather nail? I disqualified myself because I got them both. 1027-WNEW. It's the Opie and Anthony show. I'm percolating a little bit, Anthony. We have Karen coming down. She wants to be a lesbian for a day. And she has no sense of smell. We want to test out her smelling abilities, Anthony. A lot of guys donating their services. One guy on the instant feedback. Where is it? Dan from Staten Island. Hey, guys, I've been wearing sweatpants all day in my... As a strong vinegar odor. Oh, man. Ask Karen if she thinks the stench would reignite her sense of smell. That's friggin' disgusting. But very, very funny. She could date Ziggy. I'm Ziggy. That's what we should get. That's perfect. Get Ziggy down here. If we could get Ziggy down, when is she coming? By 6 o'clock, let's say? She's going to be here in a half hour. Where's the Zigster? Rick, go out on the streets of New York and find a smelly bum. I'm serious. Yes, find the smelliest one you can. Is Opera Man out there today? No, he left earlier. He left today? Smellier than him. We need someone that's really, really smelly. Mmm. Ziggy. I know, Ziggy would be perfect, but I don't know if we could get him in time. Call up Ikeet the Cop. Call. Put the bat signal out for Ziggy. It's a big light, like trash can. I think. That's an amazing thing, being born without the ability to smell. A sense of smell. That's kind of important, you know? I would have had a lot more fun in college if I had that ability, not the smell. With that one girl where you had to try with your hand out the window the whole way home. All right, all right, let's say. You know? That's a horrific story. You'd miss a lot, though. A sense of smell is kind of important. I don't know. Think about it. Why? That could be a cool thing. It gives you a memory of something. It smells like a school cafeteria, lunch box, and it brings you right back. Stuff like that. Grandma's cooking sauce in the kitchen. I like walking around the streets of Manhattan and you pass by a girl that's wearing a perfume that some old broad used to go out with. Used to wear? Something like that. You're just brought right back to that time. You're like, oh, yeah, it smells a weird thing because it could. I think that's the only thing that can be exactly the same as it was in the past. Like sight isn't because time has passed by and touch, I don't know. It's kind of different because time has passed. Well, we have no takers for carrot. Lisa! You want to be a lesbian? You wouldn't know if you had dog crap on your shoe. Just keep walking around. Hold on, Lisa, your phone sucks. It's your clothes. Put up, let's try this again. Lisa! You want to be lesbian for a day? Why not? Today? I can't get there today, I'm on Long Island. I tried to get there, the guy that answered the phone. We need to make it happen today. Can't we make it happen tomorrow? No, because I think we've got enough ladies that are listening to the show that want to be little radio stars. We've got the lesbian couch. I'm not going to be a radio star, I'm looking at Karen. What we'll have to do is hook you up with someone else in the future. Karen's definitely cute, she's coming down and we're going to find a lady to be lesbian for a day with her today. Alright? Phone number? Oh my God, what is with her? I want to be lesbian for a day. I want to be lesbian for a day. Let me put another in. Jesus. Hey, who's this? Hello? Yeah, what's up bro, you're on the air. Yeah, it's Bobby from Sign Out, how are you guys? Hey, thanks Bobby. I had a little solution, but you guys are going on it. Maybe for a lesbian for a day, you can find a girl that's good looking but doesn't have, let's say, better roses down there and see if she would be able to smell that. Because that's sometimes pretty nasty. Well, that's kind of what we were thinking a little earlier, you know. Well, we'll have to see what she's all about when she gets down here. I appreciate it, you guys are up. Thank you. But we definitely need to get a lady down here to the studio immediately to hook up with Karen. I saw her at the wedding this past Friday, she's not bad. What's with that on my side? Oh, I thought maybe she was coming down. Debbie! Yeah? Do you have no sense of smell either? No, I never had one. I couldn't tell you what anything smelled like. So you have no clue what smell is then? Perfume, flowers, food, anything. And you never had it, so you're not missing anything? Nope, not that I well. I can drive through Pontus Staten Island without being sick, but other than that. What do you think smell is? What do I think it is? Yeah, if you've never had it before. I don't know, I always wonder because people smell, like they say, I smell bacon, I smell this, I can't smell anything. And my sense of taste is off too. Really? You must be a cheap date, because if you can't smell, you really can't taste so we can just put any type of food in front of you. Have the chunk of soy on the steak. I'm not blind. No, but it's the most unusual thing, but I'm not really missing out on too much that I'm aware of. You can't smell cologne. You could be blind, Jesus. Having a sense of smell is a pretty cool thing. Well, I wouldn't have anything to compare it to. Makes changing my son's diaper all that much easier though. I can imagine. No, you couldn't. And you were born without what? What do you mean? I don't get it. It's neurological. Actually, my dentist was amazed by it and he said you can't even get it checked out because it's neurological. It's not like you have deviated septum or anything. It's in your brain. Is it your brain, your olfactory? I believe so. I guess mine are not functioning. Someone know what a clocker in the head. You know, outbring back amnesia or something. Are you volunteering? Yeah, we'll crack it with a 2x4. We'll see if you get your smell back. Iron Mike will be cracking me? Yeah. Wow, that's something though. Hey, you ever take like a big nasty dump in the bathroom and then somebody passes by and goes, I'll take the fifth on that. And you wouldn't have a clue. No, I wouldn't, but I'll take the fifth. How do you know if you stink? I don't. That's why I don't wear perfume. How do you know if your most intimate of area smells? I get feedback. You get feedback, huh? And what do they say? Haven't had any complaints so far. You know, cleanliness being next to godliness and all. Yeah, you better keep scrubbed up. I certainly do. Hold on, Karen's calling back here. I just wanted to call and tell you guys I was listening to the show and I was getting ready to come over. There's no way I'm telling you I'm dating Ziggy. What, are you crazy? You're not going to date him, we just want you to smell him. Okay. Let me tell you something. When we had Ziggy come in for the homeless shopping spree, it was the worst smell Aunt and I have ever smelled in our lives. It was beyond belief. Like we couldn't even be in the same room with him. No way. So we're trying to get him down here to test out your lack of smelling. But even without a sense of smell, you can still taste if something smells bad. Oh, is this my perspective? Say what? Is this my perspective, girl? No, not mine. It's another girl that can't smell. She sounds cute, too bad. Karen, when are you going to get down here? I'm getting on the NR as we speak. Okay. I'll be down in 15 minutes, 20 minutes. All right, cool. We've got a bunch of girls starting to check in now. Oh, yeah. We're hoping a few show up so you can have your choice, okay? All right, cool. All right, see you in a little bit. Debbie, we've got to let you go too, right? All right, thanks guys. All right, let's go to Irene. Irene, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? All right, I'm going to actually blow off my class at Montclair State. I was going to go there and flash the cameras, but I'll come down and be lesbian for the day. All right, hold on. We need all our soldiers all over the place. We'll get another lesbian for a day today. We need you to flash some live TV cameras. No, I want to come make out with some girls. I don't want to get arrested, man. You're allowed to walk around topless in New York State. Just flash the camera. And run. And then we'll have you on the show and we'll let you have your pick of lesbians. All right. Because someone's going to beat you too because we need a lady to come down here within the next half hour. Okay, it'll take me about an hour. All right. Can we count on you as far as trying to get on TV today? I'll try. Cameras going live at Montclair State a little while. That's me, I'm like a minute away, so I'll be there. All right, be incognito. Five o'clock news coming up. Don't be obvious because they're looking for all you psychopaths at this time. I'm going to be looking for all you guys. Where's something convenient? I was walking through Times Square last night on the way to Raw and there was a couple news crews and I noticed a lot of the news crews now have armed guards around them. Armed guards? I swear to you. I don't want to be taken out by some armed guards. So just be incognito. Yeah, I can pull it off. All right, we'll be watching the TV to see if you pull it off today. All right, have fun with lesbians. Thank you, Irene. Bye. What's that? Oh, you girls come down here. Eve, what's up? Hi there. So yeah, I saw you calling because I had no sense of taste or smell. And I lost in a car accident, so I had it. In a car accident? Wow. What, did you bang your head and that was it? Well, my head hit a stop sign. How did your head hit a stop sign? I mean, I don't mean to laugh, but... No, believe me, they called the big one in my family. I got thrown out of a car and... No seatbelt? No, it was in 89. Really? So how would they have seatbelts in 89? It wasn't the law. Oh, seatbelt. I am the biggest seatbelt advocate. Let me give you the other side of that, Anne. I went to college with two girls. They would be dead if they were wearing their seatbelts. I love those stories. They would have been though. They were thrown from the vehicle, their car was completely destroyed. The cops even said if you had your seatbelts on, you girls would be dead. I'm sure the odds are in your favor if you're wearing a seatbelt. Of course, but... I mean, I'd rather take the chance with the seatbelt. Take the chance, yes, with the seatbelt. Because most people just fly through the windshield, out of the car, and they're dead. And hit stop signs. What part of the body hit the stop sign? My head. Your head? Flat? The way I call it today, because it's worse when you have smell and then you lose it. Yeah. Because there are so many things that you miss. You don't smell anything? No. Nothing? And I can't taste anything. Oh, wow. What do you miss the most? The ocean. The smell of the ocean? Low tide? Something we all take for granted, I guess, when we smell the ocean. There are a lot of things that you think about that you just never would even think about. Fresh cut grass in the spring, a fire when it's in a fireplace and stuff. All those kind of things you don't even think about. I should kind of imagine it though. I'm not smelling fresh cut grass. You know what it is? I can imagine what fresh cut grass smells like right now. Yeah, but you smelled it what, like a year ago? Or whatever. 10 years, 12 years, it's going on. You lose it. Wow. That's it. Don't you feel so sorry for me? No, I mean you're alive. No, I mean it's not like Christopher Reeve is crying for you. No, I'm... If you've got to lose something in an accident, the sense of smell is like, ah, okay, I have to deal with it. No, but there's a bad side too. I moved into an apartment a month ago and had a gas leak and I didn't know. Wow. That's pretty wild. Yeah, you know, it took a friend of mine coming over and be like, oh my God, get out of here. Really? I'm not a match. All right, Eve. Well, thanks for sharing your little story today. I just want to cheer you up. Did anything else happen to you in the accident? A stop sign. No, I mean, what, did you fly through the... hit another car? He hit me and the car spun around. Oh, you weren't... wait a minute. You weren't in the car? I was in the car. That's what... they thought I was a pedestrian, but my car... I was driving the car and the guy hit my car. The car spun around and when it spun around, I flew out. Out the window? Out the open door. The door opened up. Oh, the door opened and you flew out the door and hit the stop sign. Oh, man. So everybody wear their seatbelts. Okay. That's our lesson today. Thank you, Eve. Bye. Wear your seatbelt. You don't know what smells you'll be missing. Sue, what's going on? You're next on WNEW. Hi, Opie. How are you? Good. What is it? Antchop liver? Yeah, thanks. I'm sorry that maybe you'd be interested in... Yeah? Yeah. Okay, let me just change my template and go ahead. This is a little different than the fresh cut grass. Loose Lesbo? I was away recently and I had my first experience with a girl. Oh, yeah. Okay. And? You can continue. Sue? Yeah. I was in the middle of a night out in the park and we were laying by the pool and he was reading some magazine, some local magazine that was advertising for some sort of club they had, scrub club or something. Oh my God, listen to how this... And he was telling me that it had always been his fantasy to see me with another girl. Okay. I was an original thinker. I went to this club and I really was very nervous about this and I don't know, the whole scene was sort of... I got to help you along because it sounds like there might be a payoff here. You're on vacation, your husband always wanted to see you with another girl, you're away from home, no one's going to know who you are, you're now in a club. What happens? Well, we left, we went back to the hotel and he was so disappointed so he called. He called this place and asked them if they'd send a girl over. What place did he call? This club. It was this club. Was it a strip club? No. It was like a massage club or something. This is what they sort of called themselves as. And they said you could call up and we'll send chicks over? Well, they didn't say that but he called and determined as he was and they agreed to do it. So I had agreed... How much? How much was it? 200 and then you had a tip. So they sent over a girl. And the only thing that I'd be willing to do, they advertised a sort of like hot lotion massage with light touching. So I said, yeah, I said okay, that's about as far as I'm willing to go. Anyway, he called, he said don't send anybody over here who isn't pretty because we'll send her home. And anyway she came and she was very pretty. She came to your hotel? Yeah. And well, it went further than the hot lotion massage. And further than light touching? Yes. Did your husband bang her? No. He just watched? Well, first he watched. Were you both on the bed? Yes. She started massaging you with the hot oil and the light touching? Yes. And then what, she carefully touched your balloon knot or what? No. Your whale's eye? Were you on your back? Were you on your belly? Yes. So I took off my dress and I left on just my panties and my underwear. And then I was, I got on the bed, I was on my back and I sort of bent over and put my dress on the floor. And as I was doing that she unhooked my bra. Big boobs? Me, I'm 34C. Okay, all righty. Nice little size there, sure. And so then she was just kind of rubbing my back and she was saying, you know, how pretty I was. And she was really happy to come because, you know, she was, I guess they don't always get people that they're into. Right, meanwhile your husband's tugging the taffy in the corner. No, you know, he was still dressed. And you were pretty much naked at this point? I had just panties on. Was she hot? With the girl? Yes. Big boobs? Yeah, I'd say she was about the same size as I was. Mohawk, triangle? Nice, okay. You, Mohawk, triangle? Triangle, yeah, but very groomed. And yeah, so then she took off her pants and her panties and then she said to my husband, you know, you look pretty warm over there. So it took him all of five seconds to get his clothes off. And then the two of us were on the bed and I was very, very nervous. And then... Oh, she's got to move along over here. Yeah, you've got to move along. You had her moving. We're trying to hang with you, man. That train is coming. That train is so close to leaving that station. The 506 is coming, babe. Okay. Let's go. Well, she went south and I have to say, I really didn't think I would ever like that. Right? Well, doesn't your man go south? Yeah. And she knows exactly what to do. I have to agree with you on that one. Okay. I never kind of believed that. She's probably a little softer, a little lighter, right? Yes, very much so. She wasn't like painting a fence, right? No. So she was doing that. Thank you, Sam Kinison. I was giving my husband a homer. You've got to write the alphabet. Thank you, Sam Kinison. All right, go ahead. So she was doing her thing. I looked over and I was, you know, doggy style. She was underneath. He was from behind. It was pretty wild. You didn't slip one to her by accident? Oh, sorry. Look where I ended up. Maybe next time. A lot of the listeners are complaining. This is the first lesbian story that the listeners are actually complaining about. Why? Because you took a little too long, I think. Oh, I'm sorry. She took off for a little too long. Well, Joe says Sue is boring. Another Joe, Sue is too slow. Scott, get Sue off the air. Were you pumping donuts with this girl? Yes. How did that feel? Good. Well, thank you for sharing. I enjoyed the story. Take care, guys. There she goes. There she goes. She saved her. That's the cowbell Bill checking in from Daytona. Jabil. Hey, what do you say, boys? What's happening? What's shaking? Are you hammered down there in Florida? Well, I just got here, but I'm playing on it. What are you doing down there? What are you doing down in Daytona? Well, I'm on my way to Naples. I came down to tune up my golf game. Oh, yeah. Bill, a huge golfer, very talented. He's got a big magazine. I think Big Bus magazine must be having a convention here today. Unbelievable. All different colored bikinis. From my perspective, looking down, it looks like somebody knocked over a jar up. Beach balls, Bill? Beach balls? Peanut M&Ms. You're a mess, man. Unbelievable, man. You went down there to play some golf? Yeah, I'm going to be down here for about three weeks. Three weeks? Look at this guy. Must be nice. Nice vacation, Bill. Yeah, man. So listen, I'm looking out on the beach and as far as stacker two goes, you guys got to address a group of people that you're kind of missing out on. What's that? People who are in denial. All right, this is this guy out on. Walking around in a thong, thinking, hey, you know, I'm looking pretty good. There's one problem there, buddy. That's the standard bathing suit you got on there. Okay, it's acting like a thong. Off the beach for crying out loud. He's blowing the whole picture here. So you're going to be scoping for some chicks there, Bill? Yeah, I plan on shucking a few clams there. I'm working on it, brother. I'll feel you guys when I get back. Hey, what's the story? You going to the mornings or what? We're just messing with everyone. Oh, okay. I heard it from your brother. I guess I got to call my brother. Yeah, give him a call. All right, Bill. All right, boys. I'm sure you'll have some more stories soon. Absolutely. All right, there he goes. Cowbell Bill. I'll get back. All right, cool. Later. My brother things are going to morning. We're bringing the lesbian couch into the studio. If you're in the area, we need you to show up immediately. Okay? All right, let's take a quick break and we'll be back. Stay there. You call us all up, you treat them like good people, you don't talk to them. Hey, f*** you. Jesus Christ, shut up. You idiot. You're such a loser. Hey, f*** you. What a retard. You're high. 1027 WNEW. OP and density. Who would you rather nail? I disqualified myself because I got them both. You're such a weirdo. 1027 WNEW. All right, Anthony, what else is going on in the world around us today? We discussed the Donald Strawberry thing. Yeah, boss praise for straw. Did Steinbrenner find Jesus or something? Is that what it was? Well, now that he's older, he's an emotional guy, Anthony. I mean, did he really get into it or something? Because that's not the George of old. He's got a lot of World Series ranks now. You gotta pray for straw. Man, poor guy. We'll give him another chance. I'm always into giving people more chances. Not in the old days. So we discussed that. Yeah. We discussed Kathy Lay quitting Regis and Kathy Lay, finally. A lot of rumors that the bra incident from Letterman had something to do with her quitting the show, Anthony. Put her over the top. So we gotta thank the Radio Chicken Butchy for pulling that off last week. Eventually everyone will know it was the Radio Chicken Butchy that threw that bra on the Letterman stage. A lot of people talking about it, but no one knows the details. I think the newspapers were talking to the Radio Chicken Butchy today, so maybe they'll finally get some ink on that. We discussed Anna Kornikova marrying. Ugh, that kills us all today. And we discussed all the other things. She's a little bitch rag. Anna Kornikova? Yeah. She knows she's hot. Yeah. You ladies that are hot, that's the biggest drag, knowing you're hot. I think she does, I don't know though. And that whole, where's she from? Russia? Yeah. Russian thing. Good looking Russian. I don't know. Seems like she'd be a real handful. On a godspeed. Have fun. Have fun, Pavel. Have fun deflowering our princess. Shots scored! She's got a little light up on her belly. And he nails it. Unassisted goal. Let's go back to the phones, Anthony. Joe, you're next on WNEW. Yo, 119, what's up? What's up, what's up? Yo, listen. You better not be going to mornings. I'm wasting time. I look like a big dick telling everybody that you guys are going to mornings. Yeah. Anyway, you're one of them guys that can't talk without cursing. It looks like you have 10 F'ing heads. Okay, yeah. And you know, we're not going to mornings. No, we're not going to mornings. We just felt like messing with the stupid press that think they know everything. Not even a consideration. I was ready to come in. No, we got a bunch of new radio shows starting and we hope you guys give the new shows a chance to, you know, develop here at WNEW. I was ready to stop listening to Howard all together. No, we love Howard. Oh yeah. We absolutely love Howard. Tune in in the mornings to Howard on K-Rock. We love Howard. I'm telling you, we wanted to see what his new TV show is all about. Very curious to see if that's going to be a good show. Doesn't matter, we don't get FX on here. Alright. We want your cable company. We want some more last night. Everyone should watch Son of a Beach. Son of a Beach. What is it? Son of a Beach, right? Son of a Beach. This guy doesn't shut up. I'm sorry, my bad. Alright, so you were at Raw last night? You weren't at Raw? No. He's an idiot. Joe, I'm trying to work with you today. Alright, I gotta go. Love you guys, always listening. Hang up on him before he hangs up. John, you're next on NW. Oh, and A. Yo, what's going on? First of all, before I tell my story, I'm on the LAE getting off at Hicksville Road, 106107. And there's this amazing hot chick in a black Honda Accord with a big ass wow starting on her car. And I want her to pull over and wow me. The story she's listening to. You have to help support a wow in progress. Is she close to you? She just turned her head around and looked at me. She's getting ready to pull over to the light. Let's see if I get something. Alright, why don't you roll down the window, live on the air. Let's talk you through it, man. Alright, hold on. She's turning. There she goes. Come on, pull over. Alright, she's looking. Not looking good? I don't know. What's he mean? Oh, wait. She's got a big ass wow in the background. Here she goes. Come on, lift them up. Oh yeah. Alright. A live wowing. Very good, man. What's she mean? Give Christine a big, big shout out for what she just did. Big nipples. She just wowed you, huh? Oh man, fun, bad, and galore. Well, Christine, thank you very much. Oh, beautiful. Anyway, I was getting a Hummer today in a movie theater. The Hummer Tuesday. Wait, wait, wait, you can't say that. Just as I was about to finish the job. You're at a movie theater getting a Hummer just before you finished. The usher came up and caught me and my girl doing it. But just as he did it and finished, so do you ever hear a story when you're in a cafeteria and milk comes out of someone's nose? That's kind of what happened. Alright. That's how shocked she was. What movie was it? I don't even remember. What was it? Alright, John, thank you. Alright. John got wowed. Let's go to Kevin. Kevin, what's going on today? Kevin! Hello? Hello, Kevin! Dude, whoever's on the... God damn it, Spaz. I'm gonna get a fight. Ahhhhhhhhhh! We sit there yelling someone's name and it's not them and they don't answer. Alright, wanna bring Karen in? God, that pisses me off. I'm getting no sense of smell either. You look sick. Oh, dude, I'm getting something. Hank gets sick like every two years and he's coming down with something. I don't know what it is. The girl with no sense of smell, huh? Smell or ant? Hi, how are you? She really overdid it on that perfume. Oh, really? You got paranoid? Wait, come over here. I wanna smell you. Well, she doesn't know. She puts perfume on and she can't smell. I wasn't sure if you were the one that was smelling at the wedding. Wow. She smells really good. What happened? Did you wash under your arms before you got here? This girl is definitely voluptuous. She wants to be voluptuous. She is. You're voluptuous. That's a good word, right? Or voluptuous. Volump, volump, volump you wish. Stop spilling. Oh, shut up. I might want to smell voluptuous. How are you? Hey, am I good to do? Hey, baby. I'll punch you in your old factory and you'll smell again. I think we scared off all your potential dates by saying you might smell. Ladies, let me rephrase that. She does not smell at all. What perfume do you wear? Ralph Lauren. And she smells the same. Listen, you don't smell it. My roommate gave it to me. You don't smell it at all? Hey, Psycho Mark, have her smell your smelly feet. I wanna see if she can smell. Get Spaz? Spaz has some rank feet. Well, I don't want it in here. Way in the corner, man. I'll puke. Cause I'll puke if I have to smell Spaz. Karen must be a lesbian for the day. If there's any girls close to the station, you're crazy not to get your ass down here to be lesbian for a day. Alright, Spaz is taking off his shoe. The one thing about Karen, if you weren't listening earlier, she cannot smell. She was born with no smelling abilities, right? Okay, she's on her knees. She's in front of Spaz. Hold on, I gotta do this. I'm pulling off his sock. Mark, are you serious? It smells that bad over there? Get your shoe off the thing, you meathead. She's gonna be cured. Oh my God, look at those toes. Look at those toes, God damn. You're gonna lose that toe. That toe looks like it's gonna fall off. You're gonna lose that toe. I'm serious, look at it, man. You're gonna lose that toe. Alright, Karen, smell Spaz's rank feet. She's all over Spaz's foot. Nothing? Nothing? Isn't that disgusting, man? Come on, you can't smell anything. She's asking a blind man to eat. Alright, Mark just scratched his smelly, you know what? Just stick your finger out to her. She's smelling his finger. What are you doing? What are you doing now? Oh, Rick does have a rike smell too, man. I've smelled you sometimes. I'm not like a good guy. I'm not like a good guy. I'm not like a good guy. I'm not like a good guy. You're not a good guy. I'm gonna vomit. Alright, now she's smelling Rick's smelly underarm. Go ahead, smell. Get your nose right in there. God damn, that is so weird. Nothing. Nothing? Everybody's pulling off their clothes. Smell my ass. Smell the sack. The LIE, you know, 6107. Kristen? Christine, what's up? Hey, thank you for wowing that guy. I was at your road show, I was wowing everybody at your road show. Were you really? Yeah, it was right in the corner, by the back door. By the back door? Oh, OK. Right up there. That was one of the most flamenc times I've had in a long time. Steve from the Unofficial Opioid Anthrae website put up a ton of brand new clips today by the way. Really? over 15 video clips, at least like a dozen or so still pictures. So check out what you missed at the road show www.foundrymusic.com. No dad, I won't say you're welcome. I wow anybody when they pull me over. Really? Do you wow guys all the time on the road? Hey, if they listen to all of it, they deserve a wow. Thank you. Thanks for the support. We really appreciate it. No dad, guys. Alright, man. There she goes, Christine. Alright, so Karen, we've got to try to find you a girl. Yeah. Hmm. The girls are like chicken today for some reason. Is that chick the school? It's Tuesday and they're not giving hummers or what's the deal? I don't know. Maybe they're busy. Busy giving up the back door. Are you guys still doing Anal Tuesday? We only pull out Anal Tuesday like once a month. You like the back door, huh? I don't think it's a show. Come on. Can we see your hooters? Alright, why not? I'm only in the name of my boyfriend now. Alright, of course. Always for the boyfriend. No one's going to be flapping them around or nothing. It's going to be on the website. It's up to you. We can't put them on if you don't want to. Let's see. Very nice. 20-year-old girl. 34 Cs, right? 34 Cs? One of them's a D. What? Whoa. Holy cow. Turn this way. Wow. Let me see that. That's very nice. Oh my goodness. Those could be the nicest natural breasts I've seen in a long time. Which one's the C? Which one's the C? It's obvious. The right one, man. That's a C. And that's a D. And that's a D? Yeah, get closer to that so you can check it out. That's a C. Wow, look at that. How'd that happen? I don't know. Wow. She's got huge pink nips, man. Yeah, it's very hard to distinguish nip from boobs. No, she's got the nice nips though where they go for the slow fade. The slow fade. I love the slow fade, man. What do you got, Rick? Mustard. You got mustard? She can't smell mustard. It smells. You can't smell it? Get some of the food out of our fridge. Oh my god. Oh, we got some food that has been in that fridge for like months. We'll cure you. Well, any ladies want to be with Karen? The lesbian couch awaits. Very nice breasts there. Hmm, hmm, hmm. Danny. Danny. What, you're cold? She's not shy. I like that. I know as soon as we turn off the mic she puts the top back on so we got a stall here. I got my new Victoria's Secret Desire wrong. Oh really? Breaking it in, yeah. Damn, good ladies. We're the lesbians today, man. We got a good one for you today. Yeah, y'all have fun with them fun bags. We got an hour and a half left in the show. I think we can pull something off. Yeah, someone will come down. Someone will come down. Look at the guys. They're begging. Mark, you want to give out a plea? A plea. I'm speechless. All right. All girls, we need you. Come down. Your country needs you. This could be the first time we're not going to be able to pull off lesbian for a day unless a lady comes out of the woodwork today. If you're in the area 57th and 7th, Karen awaits you. The lesbian couch awaits you. Her lopsided boobs awaits you. Can you work that other one? Can I work the other one? Yeah, maybe. Like Elvira? No. There's an exercise or something. No, I can't. Maybe I am Michael Punch. I believe if it swells up a little bit, it'll match pretty good. It'll just be a little black and blue. That nipple will be the slow fade, believe me. It'll be purple. All right. Well, we'll go to the phones and see if we can find someone for you. All right. The phone line is 212-757-1027. The Opie and Anthony Show. Drone men jumping all over each other. Okay, terrific. 1027-7WNEW. Come on, Ann. I got to bring it up. I got to bring it up. It's rare we ever get anything on Anthony. What's the problem? Why? Ann just asked Ben, who's our ticket broker. Oh, no. Come on. Ben's our personal concert ticket broker for the ONA Show. Just a little helpful reminder. Why? So there's all these great concerts coming to town. Let me just read down the concerts coming to town. Okay, let's play a little game with the listeners to see what tickets Anthony needs. You are a... Oh, man. I picked one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine fans coming to town. You guess which show Anthony wants to go see. Does Anthony want to go to see the Allman Brothers? 13 nights in March at the Beacon Theater. Does Anthony want to see Lit? March 4th at Irving Plaza. Does Anthony want to see 311 March 4th at Roseland? Or could it be Ann needs tickets to see Typho Negative and Cole Chamber? Now that's a show that rocks! March 14th at Roseland. Does Anthony need tickets for Cracker? That's a cute little band, too. Cracker. March 20th and 21st at the Valerie Ballroom. Or does he need tickets for John Paul Jones? March 28th at Irving Plaza. Must be corn tickets, right, Ann? I know you love corn. April 1st at the Continental Arena and April 8th at the Nassau Coliseum. Or does Anthony need tickets to see No Doubt at April 6th at Roseland? Or could it possibly be tickets to see Bruce Springsteen? Bruce coming to town for like 10 dates. Let's play What Does Anthony Need Tickets To? Allman Brothers, Lit, 311, Typho Negative, Cracker, John Paul Jones, corn, No Doubt, or Bruce Springsteen. Now if it was up to me, I'd have a tough choice there. Do I go see corn or do I see Typho Negative in coal chamber? Of course. Let's go to Roger. Roger? Yeah. You want to play? Sure. Okay. What does Anthony need concert tickets to? Britney Spears. Shut up. Wow, there's a huge wow banner on Channel 7. Holy cow, who was that? That was the guy we hung up on because Freak and Sparrow didn't have his name right. Son of a bitch, the wow banner was you! They're going to probably go back to the live shot. You think they're going to go to the live shot? Channel 7? Very, very good, whoever you are. Call the radio show. A huge wow banner behind the reporter, Anthony. Lovely. The story's over already. Another psychopath has struck Channel 7 today. Nice. Every day someone's striking. No, it's not Britney Spears, believe it or not. Anthony does not want tickets for Britney Spears. Nice. All right, man. Later. Let's go to George. George, what does Anthony need tickets to? The fag wants to see in sync. Get out of here. What do I win? Let me go on the ski trip. You'll see, you'll get nothing. It's got to be one of the shows we named. No doubt. Is that your answer? Yes. Is that your final answer? That is my final answer. You bet. You bet. What do I get? Let me go on the ski trip. Shut up. Come on. Nothing sacred. Come on, Anthony. They have like two good songs. Nothing sacred. Are you going to get in the pit and mosh to this song, Anthony? Yes. That part, you can have your lighter out. Very good. Very funny. You really don't want tickets to see Cornyn? Come on. Go to Typo Negative in Cole Chamber and hang out with a bunch of 20-year-old guys. I'll go to No Doubt and be surrounded by chicks. Typo Negative, good choice. I'm getting a pair of tickets off you. Does that make sense to you now? I understand why you're getting them. Alright guys, I'm out of here. You really let me down. Alright, hold on. We've got to give you a prize for playing What Concert Ticket Says Anthony Need. What do you want? We have a ton of stuff to give you. I want to go on the ski trip, man. Alright, where's the ski trip folder? Oh, we're done with that. We gave away all those spots already. You could have wrestling tickets or the new album from Smashing Pumpkins. Wrestling tickets. Alright, hold on the line, man. Nothing's sacred around here. George wins a pair of tickets to the WWF Saturday, April 15th at Madison Square Garden. Before you can buy them, plus the WWF t-shirt. Tickets go on sale this Sunday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster. Yes, Ben? I think he's an actual fan because remember the night going to Rick's bachelor party that no doubt CD was in his truck? Alright, Ben, you're really funny. You're all a bunch of fools. I understand. Look, look, look. Before you give your explanation, we also have to mention that we did find an in excess CD in your car in Alanis Morissette. Alanis Morissette. See, when I used to drive into work with him, we were rocking to like zombie. Come on. I left my towel. I don't get to commute with him anymore. He's rocking to no doubt. In the cars. You are the worst, man. Come on. It's been a while since we've gotten something on you, Anthony. No, you see, you don't seem to understand that this... Look, look. Let's not forget the time you called me to talk stops and I heard this song in the background. No! We will admit that that was playing in the background. Look, look, I had the goddamn radio and I'm scanning around and finally you picked up the phone and that's where the radio was stopped. And I started talking to you. It was. Oh man, there's no explaining it. I'm stunned. I wasn't... Shut up. I wasn't listening to this. Oh man. I can understand if it was like Bye Bye Love by the Cars or something that almost rocks like this. Oh God. I wasn't listening to it. It just came on. This happened to come on the radio. Yeah, it was on scan. And it stopped on cue and you picked the phone up. What am I going to do? Hold on, I've got to get a cool song on the radio so you don't think I'm a fool. Well, if you knew the show, yes. In hindsight, I guess I could have. You see what I've been doing now though whenever I call from the road? I try to find a fanciest song to put on the radio. When I call you, I make sure I have my anal-c CD. Anal-c. Can't say the real name of the band. Hey, Ant, just hanging out with this hardcore band. What's up? Just wanted to check in with you. To see what we're doing on the show today. Look. You want to dig up crap like this. What? You want to dig it up. Who had to get an autographed Ricky Martin CD? Come on. Come on. Who had to get it? Was that Anthony? No. I think that was open. Oh my God. You know it was for Sandy. Okay. I'll buy that. Okay. Alright. That's fair enough, right? Fair enough. Okay. Sure. Very good. Okay. Are we understanding each other? Sort of. While I'm still in litigation. So it's someone else's CD collection that happens to be in your car. What's his name? What's his name? Jack Gough, man. You are the worst. Alright. We were just having fun and all of a sudden I'm the ass wipe. Wait. Vito's checking in. Vito? Yo. What's up, Vito? How you doing, guys? Hey, Anthony. I need my warranty back. You guys suck. Syndication now. Alright, man. Bye. Bye, bro. Oh, man. I gotta just take one of these calls. It wouldn't be fair if I did. Fred. Fred, what's up? Oh, it's just a girl. Fred! You're a fag! Come on! I knew it. Ben just can't keep a secret. Hey, guys. Yeah, what's up, man? Got those Yanni tickets you wanted there? Easy. I actually went to see Yanni at the beach. Ah! And we're gonna be honest here today. What happened there? Oh, they're so hot, Anthony. Yeah, Yanni. I'm gonna get a little culture in my life. That's a culture. No, that's a few years back. Yanni. What was the worst show you ever saw? Ooh, that's... I saw REO Speedwagon. Jackson Brown. Oh. I had to say Jackson Brown. That was pretty bad. Yeah. Look at... Span just ran out of here. He almost knocked Matt over. Alright, let's go to Rob. Rob, you're next on Andy W. What's up? Hey, what's up, Opie? I called you guys yesterday. Hey, Opie, did you just go jet skiing with Ricky Martin to get the CD set? Alright, easy. We just asked to find people at Sony to help me out for a Christmas present. Yeah, yeah. That's the truth, man. Yeah, you're not off the hook either. Going to see No Doubt? You gonna wear some suspenders and checkered pants? Yeah, it's gonna dye his hair. It's gonna put a little purple in it. Oh, come on, I'm just going, cause Gavin might be there. Come on, man. Alright, Rob. Disappointing me, guys. Oh, come on. Alright, let's go... Disappointing. Let's go to Chris. He's one of the Psycho March psychopaths. He was just on Channel 7 with a huge wow sign. Chris, was that you? What's up, boys? Was that really you or you just... That was me doing it. It's like I just got back from the car. That was a huge wow sign, man. They were chasing me. Did you see my buddy on the other side? Yeah. Yeah, they were freaking cops. They must have been torn to the show because I had the walker on and it hurt me. They were chasing us to the car, bro. You guys rock, man. Oh my gosh. It sounds like you're out of breath. Oh, forget about it. I'm like full to break up. I don't want to lose you guys. Well, we saw it, man. Thank you very much. Psycho Mark, the field brother. Yeah, Psycho Mark is bowing to you right now, man. Great job. That was one of the many disciples. That was a huge wow sign. You might want to make the wow sign a little smaller so we can read it. I think we had like a W and a half an O. We got about the tapes, so... We're going to review all of the tapes from all of these wowings on all the live shots and hand out Psycho Mark psychopath medals. Yes. We got it. We're going to review one of these people as they should be. Chris, come by tomorrow. We'll give you a bunch of stuff for doing that. Bro, can I score some wrestling tickets? You want some? Yeah, if you just did that. It sounds like it was you. Yeah, hold on. We'll give you some wrestling tickets. Thanks, boss. We got to reward the psychopaths. Thanks, boss. All right, hold on, Chris. Thanks, buddy. And very good job. Thanks, buddy. It's for you guys. All right, cool. We're still waiting for the first girl to wow the live TV cameras. An actual wow would be the next step at this point, right? Are you going to get them pounding on the instant feedback yet? Rob from Long Island. Hey, Ant, maybe Lilith's fair will hit town soon. You better get your Backstreet Boy tickets before all your homo friends get them first. Anthony, are you looking forward to the Mike and the Mechanics reunion? It just sucks when you say something. I guess it's Ant's turn in the barrel today. Yeah, yeah. You couldn't take Ben to the side and say, hey, Ben, don't tell anyone, but I really need, you know, no doubt tickets. And I'm just going to call your Barry Manilow tickets are cool. Shut up, Barry Manilow. Jerry, what's going on? I hear AMBA might be getting back together. People are pounding me, you bastard. Hey, Jerry, what's up? Hey, how are you guys? Good. There were two wow signs on Channel 7. Really? There was one in the back, it was like a black sign with white writing on it. Yeah. And there was another one in the front. Oh, nice. It was like white with black writing on it. There was three? Psycho Mark's saying there was three. There was an orange one as well. There was three of them together. Oh, there were three? And the sign that said Anthony on it. It said there are three huge wow signs in the background. Do we really have a pay for that? Three. The biggest must have been about 15 feet wide. Cool, Jerry, thank you. Hey, you hang in there, guys. We love you. We're trying. Later. Having a little rough one today, but we're trying to get through it. Kevin, what's up? You're next on NDW. ONA. Yes. We have a big wow sign in the front. You just gave anything? No, we gave that to Chris. That's a big black one. I had the big white one. All right, hold on. I have a sign right here. I have a tape, and I know what happened to the girl. What happened to the girl? They told us that they were going to let us know when they were going to go up. Yeah. And then they didn't do it. And he was like really quiet. But before he went up, he turned to us and he said, now don't do anything crazy or wacky, because we're here for your school. Oh, really? Yeah. And so he said, I'll let you know when we're going to go up. And the camera guy just checked the shot, and then he just walked away from the camera. So we didn't know that they were going up. So the next thing we know, we're putting our wow signs up, and it's like we didn't know if it was on or over or what. And the girl's standing like 10 feet from me, and they turned the lights down. And she goes, what happened? I was all ready. She had her bra off and everything. She almost got to Wild Life TV? Damn it. She had nice cans. Oh, really? Yeah, she did. All right. Kevin, hold on the line. I believe you. All right. I have a sign. We'd appreciate it if you guys didn't lie to us. I want to give you some wrestling tickets, man. OK, cool. Kevin, another Psycho Mark Psychopath. Hold on the line. Thanks. All right. There he goes. Also, still looking for a lesbian for Karen, who we did not forget about you, Karen. She's there in the corner waiting for a lesbian to show up so we could get the lesbian couch in here and get a little workout going on for Karen, who's very nice, right, Aunt? Yes. Nice, firm hooters. I'm just going to see you in a day. Getting severely pounded on this. What else are they saying on the instant feedback? Oh, God. I'm with the Fag Police. I want to warn for Anthony's apartment to search for Liza Minnelli CDs. I'm just glad it's not my turn today. I don't think I could handle it today. Hey, Anthony, you going to the No Doubt Show with Gay Marco? Gay Marco hasn't called us in a while. No Doubt. Anthony's a fag. Suck, man. All right. You got it queued up, Mark? Yeah, queue up the tape. You want the tape? No, I'm going to check it out. I'm going to say it. What is Nick Carter calling for? I don't think it's that Nick Carter. I think it's a different Nick Carter. Oh, I thought it was our buddy in Boston. Oh, all right. Nick? Hello? I'd like to invite Anthony down to my special show. I'm from the Backstreet Boys and I'd like to show him what I've got playing in my pants. Okay. I want you sideways. Okay, very, very funny. Just hysterical. That was great. All right, end times up. Very good. You handled yourself quite well there. Thank you. I made that up. I'm going to go to the No Doubt Show. I'm going to go to the No Doubt Show. I'm going to go to the No Doubt Show. I'm going to go to the No Doubt Show. Thank you. I made the mistake of actually trying to explain myself the first couple of minutes. Oh, yes. I realized I was completely insane. You never explain anything on the show. You just take it. Yep. Going to No Doubt. All right. Okay. That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay, good. Uh-huh. Going to be looking forward to hearing this song. Everybody. We deliver keggers. Vanessa, what's going on? Hey, how you doing? How you doing? How you doing? Anthony, I like No Doubt, but I'll get you a George Foreman grill if you go and see Barbara Streisand. Barbara Streisand. What do you think? Get out of here. What are you, insane? Barbara Streisand. All righty. George Foreman grill. Thank you. I got the reference. Thank you, Vanessa. Bye. All right, bye. All right, Anthony, let's take a quick break and we'll be back, okay? Please. All right. I can't even get up. I'm going to go to the No Doubt Show. I'm going to go to the No Doubt Show. I can't even believe these morons. He's a disgusting little man. What a douchebag. Trainwreck Radio. Bang Bang Book. This is sicker than faces of death. All right, we checked it out. There was a wow on Channel 7. There were three of them. Three of them. And a girl that almost flashed. Yeah. Almost. You could tell she was scared. You could tell she got a little nervous and didn't do it. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You got to be careful. You could tell she got a little nervous and didn't do it. You got to be quick if you're going to try to do that on live TV. Those are huge wow signs. What was that one? I saw my name on one of them. It was four signs. It said Anthony something that we couldn't read. Good job though. The psychopaths. Out in full force once again today. All over the ball field. We were all over Raw last night at the Garden. Yeah. Got to thank the WWF for treating us very nice yesterday. So many signs. So many signs. And we announced early in the show that the feud with the WWF is officially over. Yeah. They made good. And they're making good for our listeners as well. Giving us a ton of tickets to give away to their future events and all that and so. And maybe other things in the near future. Alright let's go back to the phone. Susan you're next on WNEW. Susan. How you doing? I'm trying to defend Anthony on getting the No Doubt ticket. I think it's a very sweet thing that he's doing. I thought we were done with it. So did I. Well you had all of those opposing views. You're the only view that I thought I'd go in and defend. So you want to defend Anthony because you too like No Doubt. No I don't like No Doubt but I think it was nice that he was by the, he would try to get something that hopefully he's not really interested in but is getting them for friends. Susan what do you like? Corn? Kid Rock? Maybe some Tool? No I don't like all that heavy stuff. What do you like? Well I kind of like jazz and I like some classic rock. Classic rock like what? Like Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Yeah Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Yeah so you didn't get tickets for that Anthony. Okay. Not your taste? Sorry. Alright well Susan you did a great job. Thank you for standing up for me Susan. So Anthony are you going to give me some wrestling tickets for defending you? You'll get nothing unlike it. That's right. Oh good thanks. We're only giving them out to the people who are on live TV today. Alright. Alright. Let's go. Thank you Susan. Bye. Let's go to Laura. Laura what's going on? So there's chicks in typo negative concerts. I think so. And the dress is all in black and they got the vampire thing going on and you know they're still happening. That's a great look. You could get some action there. I think you'd get wowed there. I'd rather have the Gwen lookalikes than the goth chicks. They're a little frightening. Oh come on you don't really, I mean I am a brand new listener. The guy at my work listens to you every day and finally I started listening yesterday and I said these guys are cool. And then I find out this Ricky Martin in No Doubt. Ricky Martin. Don't tell me in there. I'm not just trying to figure out your format. Like I said yesterday I quite immediately heard something about the wheel well. The guy was hiding in the wheel well and I thought it was hysterical and I said alright these guys have it going on. Did I hear this? Now what were you listening to before us? Oh you know just whatever was on and the guy Warren Beatort at my work he listened to you every day and I started hearing this and you know he's laughing and laughing and I said I got to listen to these guys. Ah cool. We appreciate it. I did listen to Stern but then I heard today that that's supposed to be like a taboo thing. No that's not true. That's totally not true. It's the listeners that are making up all that crap. Oh it is? Well you know like I said I'm brand new. Brand new format. We support Stern and his endeavors. We're trying to support it. Oh never mind. Yeah I heard a person next to me tell me that you're not allowed to talk about it which I completely understand. So you guys are really... We just thought we'd show some support today. It blew up my face today. Oh I see what's going on. I get you now. Alright Laura thank you. Alright listen I'm going to keep listening to you guys so you can listen to the Whip it on Wednesday huh? Hell yeah. It's all over the country now. Yeah well you know I see the wow everywhere. It's on video games, it's on the Dreamcast what Crazy Taxi or whatever. Yeah on the back of all the trucks. Well anybody that could come up with that format has got to be okay so I guess I could overlook the Ricky Martin and the No Doubt for that. Alright thanks a lot guys you're great. In time you'll find out that we're actually pretty cool. Alright well listen it's been two days. I'm just sounding a little faggy today but... Well it's been two days and so far I think you guys are excellent so I'm looking forward to listening to you for a real long time so keep on the air. Laura we should put some of the people that have been with us for the last two years? Today's not one of our better shows. Yeah we're pulling this show out of our butts. Well you know what it still sounds great though. Well thank you. I mean it still sounds great. Alright thanks a lot. Okay bye. Bye bye. Let's go to Frank. Moving on to other things of course today Anthony. Frank what's going on? If my chippy wants to see that I'm going. Frankie? Yes, yes does Rick still have his Camaro? Because I heard Loverboy is in town and you know Rick and Anthony carpooled Loverboy. First of all Rick's driving the Miata, the yellow gay Miata from Go. From Go. Remember that car Jay Moore and... That's right. The name Scott Wolf was in. Right. So you guys did carpool together at Loverboy huh? Well actually you know we could make it a threesome because Opie's got the Cabrio with the back seat. I love how Rick tries to defend himself. Trust me I know the Cabrio is gay and I'm trading in my Cabrio. You actually like your Miata. I do. I'm trading in the Cabrio, it's someone else's car and I'm getting my own car again soon. Getting your own Cabrio? Yeah, yeah Rick obviously. Oh my gosh. No, no Rick you went out of your way to buy a yellow Miata. No, I was presented with a great deal. That's a lot different than driving it. That's a lot different than leasing an S10 Blazer for the last three years. The lease was up, didn't know what I wanted next so I traded it in. I don't have a car now, got to get around town so I'm driving the chicks Cabrio. That's okay, you should have an Explorer. That's the exact story. I gave it up when my lease was up, big deal. You gave it up and you bought it? So it was a deal, then I went to my Toyota pickup, gave that up too. And you gave it all up for the freaking Miata? Yeah. Which you drive around town. Which is a collector's item because they only made a certain number of those colors. Why yellow? What does certain number of those colors mean? What does it mean? That's why yellow. So are you going to cash in eventually and make a fortune out of your yellow Miata? I could probably make five grand. Five grand to drive around like a fag? Look Mr. Bon Bon. You know, it's my little car. You don't like it, Tom. You love your little car but I... I'd take up my hot chick wife with that thing. You don't have a lot of ammunition though. Yeah, I do. We've discussed my Cabrio dilemma. I'm not happy about it. I drive it on weekends, tops. Maybe five miles a week. And I'm not proud of it. To and from the glory hole. Shut up, you ass. Okay, let's go to line eight then. Aw, come on. I'm kidding, man. Jimmy, what's going on? Jimmy! How are you, Jimmy? Good, buddy. Hey, I got something for both of you. First off, Anthony, I got those Night Ranger tickets you wanted. Also, Opie, John Tesh was sold out. So I couldn't get that for you. You guys rule, man. I'll talk to you soon. Thank you, Jimmy. Can we get another girl in here for Karen who's just pacing around outside? Huh? There's one on the way. We have a girl on the way? On the way. She jumped on the end train. The end train? Where's she coming from? Downtown? Queens. Queens? She should be here in about 15, 20 minutes. She left about 10, 15 minutes ago. Is she hot? I have no idea. Doesn't matter if she smells because Karen can't smell. Right. I'm getting roasted. What do you mean? On the instant feedback? Yeah. Come on, share. No doubt, Anthony's a guzzling balloon, not liquor. All right. Hey, Anthony, don't speak, you tool. I heard that. Don't worry, Anthony. My girlfriend turns me into a homo, too. No, that's not the case. Oh my God. I heard that Peter, Paul and Mary are going to be at MSG in the summer. I'll see you there, you fag. It's from Mike from Jersey. You're getting pounded, dude. Pounded. Say this guy, Anthony, I've seen No Doubt three times. I don't go for the music, but the girl's in the little tight belly shirts. Okay. We're 12. Shut up, Rick. Hope he has a Volkswagen. That's good, Ben. Ben from Garfield gets the credit for that. Does Rick have Sammy Sousa's number on the back windshield of his Miata? Boy, we're getting pounded. Between Ant with the Cars and No Doubt, Opie with Ricky Martin, Rick with Loverboy and Spaz with Man Breath on his unit, you ought to be broadcasting from a San Francisco bathhouse. Come on. We did a good job getting all the gayness off this radio show. Let's continue down this path. All right. So I guess we got another girl wants to defend you. Joanne, what's up? Hi. How are you doing? Great. I have to defend Anthony. Thank you. I think deep down, everybody, no matter who they are, like somebody that's a little odd to everyone else. Deep down, you guys, like Opie, you got to like somebody. I mean, Ricky Martin. Come on. You've seen him before. Let me think. The faggiest thing I've listened to recently. What? I'm thinking of the faggiest thing I've listened to recently. OK. So you're forgiven. No, I'm thinking. The latest back CD, checked out the new Smashing Pumpkins. All right, I guess. Everybody likes somebody. I haven't listened to anything. He's being a man for admitting it. Oh, great. That's what it is. Thank you. All right, Joanne. I got to ask you a favor. Yes? My niece's ninth birthday is coming up and she loves WWF. Is it possible? I would never ask you guys, but... Does she want to go to No Doubt? She loves... She loves these guys. She loves China, that manly looking one. You know, I got to tell you something about China. We were in the fourth row last night. Why, really? She's a lot hotter in person. You know, she didn't look bad last night. I mean, she's still... I have to give her that much credit. She didn't look bad, but some of the pictures of her out there... She's still manly. Let's not, you know... Yeah, she's a grand little girl. She doesn't look as manly in person. I know I'm going to catch hell for saying this, but... I heard she looks like she weighs a lot less in person. Yeah, yeah. She's got a tiny little waist, huge, huge boobs, but... Well, they're fake. I know, but then the arms, though, are just... She's just got man arms, man chin. Yeah, that she does. But everything else on her is like, wow. Yeah, but would you want her? Come on. Huh? Would you hit on her? Would I go there? Yeah. I'm a guy, yeah. Oh, come on. What? She kicked your butt. Huh? Did you imagine? She kicked your butt. It's okay. That's okay. Little roughhousing never hurt anyone? Okay. You're sure we want a roughhousing? No, we'd go there. I mean, come on. If it takes her this much to a good, can you imagine what you'd be waking up to next morning? Well, there you go. All right, Joanne. Do we have any wrestling tickets? Spaz? Spazzy? Do we have any wrestling tickets? Give away our film for today if you want to give away another pair of stuff to you. Yeah, give them to Joanne. She sounds cool. Joanne, hold on the line, all right? Thank you. All right. We'll talk to you soon. You guys are great. I listen to you guys all the time. You and the radio chick. I love you guys. Yeah, please support the radio chick. Oh, I do. All right. I'd love to be her sidekick. Let me tell you. I think they might be making an announcement about that very soon. Yeah? Yeah, so thank you, Joanne. No problem. Have a good night, guys. And check out the show on After Us tonight. Okay. There's no more Tom Lycus. Okay. We're going to try... You guys are the best, though. All right. Well, thank you, Joanne. Thank you. We're going to be trying out another radio show tonight at 7 o'clock. Yes. And we're going to give them a chance to shine before we criticize. That's it. Got to give all the new shows a chance before we criticize. Gee, I wonder what happened to Tom. Just didn't work out. Didn't catch on, I guess. Kind of sad. No, New York. All we were asking for was a little respect, and he didn't want to give it to us. Today, um, he said, we're still here in New York. He's not. Yeah, he said about two weeks ago that he wasn't going anywhere. Or three weeks ago, he wasn't going anywhere. Mm-hmm. But the show was here to stay in New York, so... Mm-hmm. Oh, well. Well, look at that. How does that happen? As happens. Oh, well. But check out the new show tonight at 7, okay? Right. All right, Ann, let's take a quick break. Hopefully this girl will come down here so we can finish this radio show in style today. Yeah, please. Um... We got some girl on the end train somewhere. Oy. What a mess this has been today. It's 1027WNEW. In my day, radio was boring all the time. And we liked it that way. And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath. 1027WNEW, it's the Opie and Anthony show. Okay. Line two is good, you think? Go to line two. Hi, who's this? Hi, it's Taylor. Hi, Taylor, how are you? I'm fine, and you? Real good. How are you guys? I just wanted... First of all, is Karen still there? Yeah, Karen's still here. Yeah, hi. Hi, Karen. I wish I could be there because just as I was pulling away, I had heard that she's looking for a girl. And about 5 o'clock tonight, I had my first lesbian experience. Good for you. Absolutely incredible. We agreed to meet, but we couldn't, you know, have too much time together. So Thursday morning, we're planning to meet at a motel, and we're just going to be together all day. All right, hold on. First of all, what do you look like, Taylor? What do I look like? Let's see, I'm about 5'6". I know you guys judge by the size of the breasts. No, not really. They come in all sizes and shapes. But I'm a 38 day. Whoa, hello. That's the size of the breasts I have. I'm medium build. I have short brown hair. Very bubbly personality. Very bubbly. Yeah. Yes, very bubbly. I'm married. Uh-huh. And my husband's totally loving the fact that I was with, you know, going to be with a woman. How did you get together with this girl today? We just had met through mutual friends, and it was just that, I don't know, this conversation came up about being bicurious. And I had said, I'm very bicurious. I've been for a long time. And she's like, so have I. And then I found out she's only 19. And how old are you? I'm going to be 28. Nice. So I was like, I'd love to meet you. You know, maybe... Maybe they could be arranged. Maybe something could happen. And she was like, sure. And then I heard that Karen was looking for somebody. And all women out there, if you're curious, go ahead and do it because it's amazing. So where did this take place today? It took place, I'm in Jersey. It took place, actually, we met at a restaurant. We were just having coffee. And then it was in the parking lot in the car. You just went to town? We made out for like 15 minutes. Did you pet any poodle? A little bit. We couldn't do so much, but we were touching breasts and it was amazing. How big was she? She was about 36. 36 days she said she was. She was cute? Very, very cute. Adorable. Were you guys bumping donuts in the car? I don't think, J. Moore, that's the best way to describe it. I'm just telling you... Well, were you bumping donuts? No, no. We didn't have... I mean, it was kind of confined. We were out in the open, in the car. You were a little nervous that you were going to get caught, right? Yes, exactly. We kept looking. You know, some of the foreign dishwashers were coming out and smoking a cigarette and we kept looking and turning around. But somebody has to go see Karen because it's amazing. I can't even tell you how great it is. Well, we have some girl on the end train, was it? Coming from Queens? Yeah. So hopefully they'll get here in time today. Wow, that's a great little story. You're a bubbly little girl there. Yeah, it was incredible and I can't wait to do it. You want to be lesbian for a day in our studio? I would do it. I was just telling Rick that I would do it. It's just, you know, I wasn't too sure. Like... Anything is fine, trust me. You know, meet somebody and do it. I wanted to get to know the person but then I'm thinking it was incredible. Absolutely amazing. I can't even believe how good it was. It's a very comfortable atmosphere when you come in to be lesbian for a day. We've got a couch, we turn down the lights, we put some nice music on for you. Yeah, I've seen some of the pictures on the website. Very interesting. And then like 50 guys just check you out. Yeah, that's great. I'd let anybody watch. That is cool. So you had a little fun in the restaurant park a lot and now you're going to spend the whole day in a hotel with her, what, Thursday? Yes, in the morning. Before work? Actually that day I'm off. Nice. So I can't wait. Have you guys been discussing what you want to do in the hotel room? Oh yes, all the time. Because we talk on the computer and it's intense. What do you want to happen to you? Everything, whatever she wants, anything and everything. Toys, games, whatever. Oh, you're open to it all. Shoots and ladders. Yes, open to it all. I'll bring the shoots and ladders. What about Candyland or Uncle Wiggly? It's a total fantasy. I've got my Uncle Wiggly in my pants. I just wanted to come true and of course it's going to happen. I can't wait. That's great. Her tongue was so soft. Amazing. What was she thinking about tongues? Was she exploring your boobs? Yes. And you enjoyed that? Oh yes, very much. Much better than a guy going at it with you? My husband is an excellent lover. Being with a woman reaching that level is just, you can't even imagine what it feels like. It's intense. Incredible. I wish Karen the best of luck. Go out there ladies and go find Karen because it's great. Well, Karen called last minute. If it doesn't happen today, we'll get someone else to call. Well, good luck. Love you guys. You guys are great. Well, thank you, Karen. You're welcome. Bye. Let's move on to Sarah. A lot of women checking in today. Hey guys, I have a big dilemma. I don't know whether or not I give my boyfriend a hummer the right way. The right way? I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything right. When I ask him, he says I'm doing everything right. How do you spell X? Act. No, no, no. When you question somebody. Ask? Yes. A-S-K. How come you said it like that? Ask because I'm Hispanic. Oh, I thought you were Irish. So now you don't know if you're giving hummers properly? I mean, I know I'm doing it right. Okay. And I vary a lot. I'm doing it and doing it and doing it well. Doing it and doing it. But the thing is I don't get a big reaction out of him. Only once have I gotten this kind of reaction from him. You've got to play porn star. You've got to give the look up. What are you doing? Just kind of... I pluck the hair. I look up. I make sure he's seeing me doing it. Yeah, that's very key. You've got to get that eye contact going. I do. And then if I'm doing it from the side and he's looking down, I make sure I put my hair the other way so he can see the action. Wow. Very good. You're not using teeth, are you? No, no way. You're making the Charles Bronson face, right? No. For the older audience. Wait, wait, wait. Why aren't you making the Charles Bronson face? What's the Charles Bronson face? Where you put your lips and over your cheeks. Oh, like... Charles Bronson. Charles Bronson. Like Charles Bronson. I must dig a tunnel. Well, I make sure I use motion lotion, everything. And only once have I gotten this kind of reaction from him. Do you complete? Hold on. She completes it. She's talking about anything. Well, her lunch. Do you... No, no. She completes everything. Everything. And... Wow. And there's no huge reaction, huh? No. And it's very disappointing to me. Because he said he enjoys it a lot. He always loves to get one. Are you working it all over the whole thing? Everything, you know. Yeah, yeah. Top to bottom, right? Everything. Everything. Varying speeds. Licking everything. I even had sun pierced. Twig and berries? Everything. And you have a tongue piercing? Yeah. And he's not into this? Yeah, that might be it. He said he loves it. And every time we see each other, he's like, oh, you know, whatever. You know, to do it. And I do it. You know, is there any guy... And I don't get a big reaction from him. Is there any guy that, like, is into the tongue piercing for oral? You want a metal thing slapping around on it? No, because you... Or all tongue? Underneath. Yeah. It's very useful when you use it underneath. I take it out sometimes, but... What's good with the metal ball or something? The way it slides, you know, under the... Yeah, OK, we can figure it out. And, uh, now they'll just be all beef. All tongue. Maybe he's just not into the hummers. But he acts for it every single time. Hmm. I just want to know if... I don't know. It sounds like you're giving him a perfect hummer. Maybe he's just enjoying himself and he's lying back. Maybe he's too shy to express himself. Maybe he's gay. Maybe he's doing your sister. No, he's not. Oh, OK. How long have you been with him? Um, it'll be seven years. Six months, yeah. On the 18th. Maybe he's getting a little bored. Wait, how old are you? Me? I'm 20. Oh. You guys started when you were 13? Yeah, we started going out when we were, like, in junior high. When did you start hobblin' the knob? Uh, let's see, when I was... 16. When did you give up the blue nut? Never. Ah, still uncharted. He wants to do that, but I'm scared. Yeah? Just drink a lot of wine. You get really drunk. You just get really plastered. You get snotted. Only I'm ready. My blue nut's ready, baby. Just stick that big old ass up there. And I ax all my friends. You ax them? You're ax-axkin' again. I ax all my friends what I might be doing wrong. Punch him in the testicles. They'll make a sound. Right in the middle of it. Just wham. Yeah, hit him hard. I don't know. I'm very good-looking. I don't need to be conceited. I'm very good-looking. Conceited. So what part of Queens do you live in? We live in Richmond Hill. Okay. That was hard to figure out. I don't know, Sarah. I think you're doing a great job. He should be fortunate to have someone like you hobbling his knob. Right? Absolutely. She's making the Charles Bronson face. She's keeping it moving. She's all over it. She pulls the hair out of the way so he can check out what's going on. Yeah. I don't know what to tell you, Sarah. Thank you, Spaz. Spaz runs in with the bullhorn. Alright, Sarah. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you for sharing, though. I think Mike Tyson's getting some kind of a cold and cough and sore throat. Yeah, you don't look good. Dave, what's up? Hey, guys. I was yesterday on a show. I'll tell you why I'm banging the mic. The phones suck. The phone is alright now. Yes, it does because you go like this and then it pops on nicely. But everyone at home has to hear us banging on the mics. We just showed Peter huge hooters. He should fix our phones now. Dave, what's up? We have to bribe the engineers around here. They don't fix stuff until we show them hooters. I'm glad I could be of service. Thank you, Karen, for showing everyone the hooters. Now we'll get some equipment fixed around here. Thanks. What's up, Dave? Okay, guys. One of your t-shirts were on eBay? Yeah, I heard something like that. Okay, why would I want to surf around and stuff like that? And guess what? Some dude has recorded five weeks of your show and is selling them on CDs. Really? Yeah, not good, eh, guys? That's not good at all. We don't mind you guys bootlegging the show and sending it all over the country. But don't make money off it. Yeah, the guy's going to the red on eBay, man. 15 bucks for a CD. Really? I thought you might want to know about it. It ain't cool. No, it's not. I mean, we hate to be pricks, but we really don't appreciate that. If you want to make tapes and send them for free to people, that's cool. Absolutely, I agree. But man, this dude's making money off of you guys. And you also need to syndicate, you know what I mean? All right, Dave, we'll take care of the problem. Okay, check it out, guys. Thank you. Bye. Marilyn, you're next on N.E.W. You got some advice on giving hummers. Last week when Jay Moore was on and explained how to give a hummer, it worked every freaking time exactly the way he did it. I'm convinced he's done it. Really? You're not the first. It worked for me every time exactly the way he explained it. Now, can you sum up what he said last week? Well, sure. You have to use your mouth and your hand. Okay, you have to grab onto it nice and firmly. Wait, you can't be so... I'm not going to be so... I'm not going to be so... I'm not going to be so... You can't be so... Just keep it very vague. You have to hold the stick very firmly and you have to bring your mouth over the stick. Is that right? Can I say that? You can be a little more vague, but we... Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to get like a lollipop, kind of. Right. You have to feel yourself holding the stick and your puppet going over the round tootsie pop. Right. We got you. Okay. And your hand and your mouth are moving. Sorry. No, it's not you. It's the phone. Oh, sorry. You have to move at the same time. In other words, can I say up and down? Up and down at the same time. Right. She's still lost. She doesn't know if she can say up and down. I don't know what I can or can't say. I know. We screwed you up, man. Well, anyway, it works exactly the way and I'm convinced he's done it. Okay. Thank you, Marilyn. Thank you. All right. Bye. Let's see. I'm on eBay. Yeah. Let's see what we have listed under Opie and Anthony. We have We Deliver Keggers T-shirts. How about that? We also... There's a picture? Mm-hmm. Picture of what? Of a T-shirt. We Deliver Keggers T-shirts. Okay. This Opie and Anthony Wow Car Magnets for $5 each. The T-shirts are going for... Let's see. One of them is going for $25, another one is going for $15.26. And then there it is. The CD. What's on the CD? Anything good? Let's see. Some of these bits we're embarrassed about. This is possibly the funniest CD you'll ever own. Hey, how about that? Full five weeks of radio broadcast from Opie and Anthony. Let's see. CD contains over 10 hours of listening. Commercial-free. Two hours of listening per day. That's a total of 50 hours of commercial-free O&A. There are several bonus bits from December featuring Jim Brewer. The files are MP3. Buyer pays actual shipping. And then there's the CD. And then there's the CD. And then there's the CD. And then there's the CD. And then there's the CD. The buyer pays actual shipping. And happy bidding. Jesus. We don't even try to make money off our stuff. We don't even try to make money off our stuff. Want to bid on it? Want to bid on it? Buy them all back. Buy back our material? Yeah. We'll have to let the lawyers know. Maybe they can finally help us for once. I doubt it. Alright, we gotta take a break. Pictures? Pictures of what? I don't think we made these. These aren't official, are they? No. That's not the official We Deliver Keggers t-shirt. No. Great. And the other ones look like, let's say. Because those aren't the official We Deliver Keggers t-shirts. And the same ones. Alright. Let's take a break, and we'll be back. Stay there. It's 1027 WNEW. Hey kids! It's your old pal Krusty. And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy, I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show. Syndication now! Fran is 84 years old. Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran. I'm sorry. No anal is okay. Brainwreck Radio. The Opie and Anthony Show. 1027 WNEW. Alright Anthony! Yes. Hang in there my buddy, my pal. Anthony getting sick. Yeah, as we speak. I feel like I'm going to start throughout the picking up. I feel a bit of a... I feel a bit of a cough. Anthony rarely gets sick. Oh no. Let's go to Tim. Tim, what's going on man? How you doing? Good. I learned something on the Opie and Anthony Show today. As a matter of fact, I did. I learned a new word. Phelumptuous. Hey yo! You would say the same thing if you saw what I saw. I was stuttering like a bastard over here. Hey, I'm the same guy who called and gets stuck driving his girlfriend's cabrio. Oh yeah. And if Anthony needs to borrow it to go to the No Doubt concert, I mean that's okay with me. Alright, funny. Okay, thank you Tim. It's not fair because I don't think Anthony has the strength to fight back today. I just see it in your eyes. It's done today. Symmetra out guys. Thank you Tim. Well, we got Karen in the studio who's very nice. She's got big hooters. She's cute. She's got a C boob and a D boob. And a girl has come down to try to be a lesbian for a day with you. Now you can say no to this girl. Are we bringing her in? I just feel like you're like, I feel alright. You mean like nah, that's alright. We like when people are brutally honest on the show. So if you don't like her, you gotta make sure you tell her. Alright. Alright. Are we bringing her in? I don't know. It doesn't seem like it. She was in the bathroom for like 10 minutes. Doesn't seem like anyone's working for the show today. I'm gonna go with some coke. Yeah. Yes. Ben's holding the door open. There she is. Alright. Why don't you sit down right there. Right at that mic. Someone in the studio's rolling their eyes. I've seen you before. What's your name? I was with Psycho Mark. Talking to the mic so the audience can hear you. I was with Psycho Mark when you first started. While we were on TV. Oh yeah, outside channel 2, right? What's your name? This is the lovely Karen. Nice to meet you. Do you like her big huge boobs? I'm like really nervous. Have you ever kissed a girl before? No. But there was one time though when I was in a club and I was on E. And that really got me into it. So I don't know if I can really do this. You gotta lose the gum. Okay. Right behind you. Well it's up to Karen. Karen? I don't know. I don't know, I've been waiting here a while. I don't know, I think I lost my... I was all excited when I came here. Good answer. I think I lost my drive. You don't have a love connection? Is that what you're trying to say Karen? I came on here last minute. I don't know. Well look, don't film the video. I'm sorry. Is there a problem? No, it's just... I don't know. I'm having second thoughts. It's gonna make you puke! Me? I was trying to hit the... Do you see your stuff? So there's no love connection? No, I think my boyfriend will be kind of mad. Ahhhh! Wait, he's on the line. Matt, right? Hey Matt, what's up? We got Karen in the studio. Hey! So what do you think of this? I don't know. I don't know. Matt, what's wrong? Just unexpected. Oh, you didn't know she was coming down today? I caught her on my cell. She told me she was gonna, but... It was quite a surprise to see she actually did it. Oh really? And now you're bummed that she's here? No. Are you bummed she showed everyone her hooters? Well, that's what she wants to do. I'm in trouble. Matt, talk to us. What's the problem? No, there's no problem. He's not a talking guy. He doesn't... Oh really? Matt? What's the problem? It's just you and I. It's open Anthony, come on. You and me in the whole New York metro area. No! Especially today, I don't think we have a lot of listeners that stuck with us today. That's comforting. No, not because of you. It was just, you know... Matt? What's the problem? No, there's no problem. Positive. I won't... I'll leave her alone now. No, no. It's cool. You sure? Positive. She's got really nice boobs, man. Yeah, well... She's OP, man. What? Does that bother you, Matt? No, you can comment all you want. I get to comment on your girlfriend in front of you. Okay. That's fair. If you went to that wedding, you would have saw my girlfriend. Yeah, I know. I don't think other parties would have appreciated my friend though. Yeah, I might have been invited because of extenuating circumstances. Oh, that's right. Alright, Matt. So I don't think we got a love connection today anyway. Oh, well. Alright? You only get so many chances in life. Well, no. I mean, it's up to you. If you'll allow her to come back, then we'll get another girl. No, that's fine. She can come back. Yeah, he wants to share. One that doesn't look like the one her one. Uh-huh. I'm just kidding. I'm joking. It's a joke. Right, Ed? Of course. Don't get yourself upset. It's a joke! What did you say? I said I know how you guys saw us. I'm not going to let it get to me. I'm just kidding. There's a lot of scabs on your arm. What's that scab right there on your right arm? My cat. Oh, okay. Looks like it might have been from something else. No. Come on, I thought we were all having fun. She knows I'm kidding. Alright, well, Matt, thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Alright, I guess you guys can take the lesbian capture out of the studio. Yes. We didn't get a connection hard in a way. She wants you guys just to do it. Jen, what's up? Hi, how are you? Good. I'm going to make you just do it. Get it over with, already. You got enough guts to go down there. You got enough guts to show your faces. You might as well do it. Well, I don't know if they want to do it. You want to like maybe do a little kiss? Go at it. What's the big deal? You know, you're a big shot. They don't know who you are. They just hear your voice. Yeah, how about a quick kiss? Galaxia, would you want a little piece of Karen? She doesn't look too sure. That's what hit me off. It's my first time. I've never actually done this before. Oh, okay. That's why we do this lesbian birthday. Yeah. They're trying to get the music going in the background. They're trying to get the music going. The lesbian couch is there. They're trying to get the music going. The lesbian couch is there. The lights are down. There we go. Oh my god. It's up to her. It's really up to her. Karen? I'm trying to be honest. You do it. No amount of Al Green could ever possibly make me do this. Why did you go down there? Why did I go down there? I don't know. I don't know. Usually they have five or six of them down here. It's like a party. So you're not into the one we brought you is what you're saying? No, I just thought it was going to be different. That's all. I wasn't coming home from work right now. I'd be down there right now. Jen, there has to be some type of chemistry. We can't just completely throw them out. You got any other girls to go down there? No. This is about it today. Oh. Yeah. All right, Jen. I'm going to go down there. All right, Jen. Bye. Not looking good, Anthony. No, not at all. We want to thank Galaxia for stopping by again. You all right, Galaxia? I'm okay. Actually, it's funny the way it happened. I actually called Stats to break on Anthony by this little... No doubt? Yeah. He tells me the first thing he says is someone said he asked for the phone. Hey, Paul, what's up? Yeah, what's up? Yeah, Galaxia. Hey, do you still work on 4th Street? Oh my God, yeah. Yeah, guess who this is. I know who this is. Who is it? It's Tom. You used to be in the manager, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is it, Paul? I'm not going to say which business it is. Galaxia. Can they get you to take off your clothes? She's got a tattoo, man. Yeah, I'd be interested. I don't remember. Galaxia, what's the tattoo? It's Tom. It's the taz cutting off Bugs Bunny's head. Yeah, you know... And where's this tattoo? It's on my chest. We got to see it. At the very least. Here, stand up and get naked for Karen. Yeah, I'm serious. Turn off the lights. And what's 4th Street? Drug den? No, it's the whole job that I used to work at. What is it, though? It's a store. And you used to get naked in the store? No, nothing unseedy. Alright, here, move over. Let me see what you got going on. Alright. Wow, you got some nice abs. Very surprising. Looks like you need a sandwich, but... I'm not a boy. Dude, there's scabs all over your body, man. This is my cat. He's very mean. This is one and this is the other. Very nice. Alright, I see the dragon's head, yes. This is a very old, very old cat, so I have to get it touched down. Alright. Can we see your, like, boobs? They're tiny! I don't care, I like the tiny ones, too. Alright, let's go. Little Flash. Oh, those are nice. Surprisingly nice. Karen, you want to reconsider? That's nice, right? Put a bag over her head. Sandy, you gotta give me a little help there. Thank you. I'm just kidding. Look at her head. I should be joking, I'm kidding. That was a joke! Paul, help me out. She's really pissed. Wait, what happened? Help me out, I just pissed her off. No, Galaxie, I think you're very nice. You got a smoking body, that's for sure. Thank you. Alright. Oh my god. Alright, I'll make a deal with you guys. I will do one thing, and I will do the other. I will do the other. I will do one thing Galaxie wants me to do. And that will be anything she wants. Whoa, whoa, really? I think you're impressed by the body, right? I give her that. Alright, anything? Anything. Galaxie, well, we have to... We have to suggest some things to Galaxie. Oh, from the listeners? Uh oh, here we go. Okay. Galaxie, what do you want to happen? I want to come from her. Alright, you want her to do something? You want her to do something to you? Whatever she wants. Anything she wants to do to you. Anything she can think of. Wow. Galaxie, what do you want to do? Show off your wares real fast. Oh, me? Check these out Galaxie. One's a C and one's a D. Oh really? Check these things out. This one too? Only the best. What do you think? She has to be all greener, honey. What do you think of those? They're nice. They're real nice, right? You can't really tell, that one's bigger than the other. The right one's obviously bigger than the left. Yeah, you really got to stare at them. Okay, yeah, the right one is a little bigger than the other. Okay, now I see it. Galaxie, what do you want to do to Karen? She's just sitting there waiting for you. I don't know. I mean, it's my first time. She's going to let you do whatever you want. I want to give you confidence, because I know that's my first girlfriend. Oh. Wow, Karen is just... She's giving up her body to you. We're not going to get this chance again. Do it up. What do you want to do? Suggest that, Psycho Mark. Well, to her. Any suggestions? I don't know. Psycho Mark, what do you want to suggest? Karen, why don't you... Play face and practice my Spanish. Play 19th century photographer underneath her dress. Karen, get on the couch. Karen is completely topless with her huge hooters. She's now on the couch. Galaxia, who has a smoking body, is working her way over to the couch. Wow, Galaxia is just taking off her clothes. This is nice. Everyone's feeling very comfortable in the studio. Psycho Mark, put your pants back on. Take your bra off, Galaxia. Turn down the lights. Wow. J. Moore would be proud. Yes, working the pimp hand. I'm going to go to the bathroom. He would be very proud. I didn't think we had anything going on. Yeah, I see. I told you. Alright, Paul, let me tell you what's going on here. We got Karen, who's willing to allow Galaxia to do anything. She's just staring at... Uh-oh, they're making out. Whoa, are they making out! Paul, both girls completely topless on the lesbian couch. Wow. Karen is... Karen is very aggressive. She just grabbed Galaxia and started just putting her clothes on. She grabbed Galaxia and started just making out with her. Oh, I always knew she had an inner. Wow. Galaxia, how did that feel? That felt better than a guy's kiss. That felt better than a guy's kiss, huh? Would you guys like to bump some donuts a little bit? A little donut bumping? I don't think we've ever had totally nude lesbian couch, to tell you the truth. Never had it. Alright, uh, well, let's continue, man. We only have like five minutes left in the show, and then we're going to step aside for a brand new radio show. Alright, let's continue. We're going to step aside for a brand new radio show on N.E.W., Don and Mike. Hey, this is almost as good as Mr. Mr. in concert. Alright, Paul, we got to let you go. We got to describe what's going on, but thank you, Paul. Hey, I helped you out. Can you guys hook me up? Call us tomorrow, we'll forget you. We ran out of everything that we were giving away today, alright? Alright, I'll call tomorrow, man. Alright, peace. Thanks. Thank you, Paul. You get the assist today. Alright, listen, girls, we only have a couple minutes left, so... Now, did Galaxia decide what she wants yet? No. Galaxia, grab that mic. Oh, she just pulled her hair out. Now it's flowing nicely. Now, Rick is playing porno director. Yeah, as usual. He's got Galaxia on her back, propped up on a pillow. Karen is over her with her huge boobs. And what does Galaxia want over there, Rick? I'm smothered to death by regret. I'm going to be smothered to death by regret. I'm going to be smothered to death by regret. I'm going to be smothered to death by regret. I'm going to be smothered to death by regret. I'm going to be smothered to death by regret. Alright, it looks like she wants to be smothered by the huge hooters. Karen, just get in there. We only got like four minutes left. There they go. Major make outage. Oh wow, Ant. Yeah. What's the view from your angle, man? Um, well, Rick is trying to manipulate some hands. Yeah, I see that. Alright, there's some placement there. They are really going at it now. They are rubbing fun bags. Yeah, look at that. Wow. They are really getting into it all of a sudden. Both of them are feeling much more comfortable, Ant. I didn't think so. I didn't think we were going to pull this one off today. Galaxia exploring. Karen's back. The side of her back. Her belly. There's still too many clothes on. Karen's on all fours above Galaxia. Karen is working her neck. Karen's working her fun bags. Karen's checking out the Taz tattoo. Oh wow. Oh, Galaxia is really getting into it. Oh my god, there's um, okay. Wow, okay. There's some nursing going on. Little nursing going on. I think we could say that, right? Come on in, guys. Wow. Ant, what do you got over there? Well, uh... Yeah, there. The lesbian couch is going to get great workouts going on. Little tongue bath. Yes. Thank you. Karen's done this before. Yeah. Eric, that was a smooth move. You bastard. Pretty good. Oh, look at that. Wow. Galaxia now exploring her. Karen's entire body with her hands. Yes. Galaxia, grab hold. Grab hold. You know you want to. Okay. She's pulling Karen into her. Very nice grip. Grab hold. Wow, we're getting some great pictures for the unofficial Opiate Anthony website. Can you see that grip? Dan, we could sell this damn video and make a bloody ford shit. Donuts are popping. There's some doughnut... There's some doughnut popping. But the doughnuts are still wrapped. That's okay though. Oh my god. They are really, really getting into it. We didn't think we had a love connection. I'm waiting for that Karen to make the move with the button. Here we go. Whoa, look at that. Shake your bonbon, shake your bonbon, shake your bonbon. Shake your bonbon. You're singing Ricky Martin there. Dude, look what we're checking out. Yeah. Alright, we got two minutes left before we have to step aside for the brand new show here on NW.Mike. No more Tom Likeus. Come on. I must say this is a very sensual lesbian for a day. Yeah, this isn't a bad one. Very erotic, very sensual. Didn't look like we were going to have a love connection. Then all of a sudden a little nudity and they hit the couch. Both girls topless. Galaxia has some really nice smaller firm boobs. Karen has the huge firm boobs. And Karen just worked in the chest area of Galaxia. Galaxia, grab hold right there. You got it. Oh yeah. How do they feel? Yeah. Very nice. Galaxia, would you like to kiss Karen somewhere else? And ask her that. You're a little closer. What was the question? I'll ask her. Galaxia, you want to kiss Karen somewhere else? We only have 40 seconds left in the show. There we go. Karen is leaning back on the couch. She's propped up. Here goes Galaxia. Rick offering the pillow. And there goes Galaxia. Very nice thin little body. She's exploring with her hand. Holy Toledo. Karen's moving. Looks like a kid bringing a grapefruit into the house. Wow. Okay, there she goes. There she goes. Little nursing coming on. How about that? I don't know if Karen's ready yet. Oh really? Alright. Wow, another successful lesbian for a day. Yeah, bravo. We got a digital camera and a video camera. We're going to get some footage off to Steve from foundrymusic.com. And you'll see what we just saw. We'd like to share with our listeners. As the bumping of donuts continues Anthony, we've got to step aside here. Yes. We're just hearing for a brand new radio show here on NAW. I want you guys to give these guys a chance. Don and Mike coming up next. Stay right there. We'll see you guys tomorrow too. Good day New York. I, Mayor Quimby, would like to be your senator. If elected, I would use your tax dollars to put Opie and Anthony on radio stations across this great land. Syndication now.
