 A gigantic boombox is coming down the street. Hand me the RPG-7. Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW. It is Opie and Anthony. Hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us. All the Mary and Rhoda thing is on tonight, Anthony. Are you going to be watching? Yes, I'll be in front of my television to watch the Mary Tyler Moore reunion show with Rhoda. They haven't acted together in 23 years. There are so many unanswered questions from when I watched the last episode of Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda. Is anyone caring about this? Who's going to go out of their way to watch this? No one in the country is going to be copyrighted. Is this the song? Are they going to change the words? This is the old one. They updated it for tonight with Joe Jack. Mary's daughter's on a boat. She's hobbling knob across New York. Girl, it's time you were all alone. But it's time you started living. It's time you let someone else do the things. Bring it on home. It's interesting about this reunion show though. They do it to all our sitcoms that we grew up watching. Mary Tyler Moore show, that was a sitcom, that was a comedy, right Anthony? Yes. They bring back the reunion show and they always turn these damn things into dramas. With the Mary and Rhoda thing, Mary's getting over the death of her congressman husband Anthony. And Rhoda's getting a divorce from her husband. That sounds like a scream. It's hysterical. But they do it with all the sitcoms. Remember the Brady Bunch reunion? The Brady Bunch, very light comedy when we were growing up and stuff. Never got too serious. The most serious thing, I think Cindy got the sniffles. And Jan rode her bike without her glasses and crashed into something in the garage. Don't forget about the smoking episode with Greg. That was pretty serious, tackling the huge drug issue. Greg's smoking cigarettes. They're not mine. And then they did the reunion show and what happens? It turns into a drama. Poor Bobby is now a race car driver and paralyzed from the race car. That's a joke. Why can't they just stick to the comedy? Because they have to, you know what it is, they did the been there done that thing. They're like, oh it was a comedy but we could take these characters that the country has just embraced and tackle the serious issues facing today's youth. Mary's got a daughter in this? Is she a coke whore? That would be a good one. In a very special Mary. Mary's daughter is a coke whore. She's hobbing knob in the bathroom at the tunnel to get money for her next jumbo. Yeah, I bet you Ted Knight's thanking God that he's dead and doesn't have to be in the middle. God, thank you I'm dead. Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary. Who is alive? Let's see. Mary's still alive. Captain Stooping is still alive. Who's Captain Stooping now? What about Lou? Lou is still alive. I saw him recently. He's so old he doesn't even look like Lou anymore. Lou, you don't look like yourself. What happened Lou? Ted Baxter with the news. Lou's a big bloated mess. Lou, Lou, Lou, Mary, Mary, Mary. Well what happened Mary? Mary. Look at Lou's hairy. Lou, this just in. Ted Baxter with the news. Lou's hairy. Lou, big hairy ass. Lou, Lou, Mary, Mary. It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat. But the man that's worthwhile is the man that can smile when his shorts are too tight in his seat. Okay, pookie, Chris in the boat. Lou, Lou, how about a fresca? You'll get nothing in life if you're spalding. Hey Mr. Knight, what do you think of Mary? She's looking pretty hot these days. Hot? What size are those boobs? 48 longs? Mary, Mary, how would you like to mow my lawn? Does weed wacker boobs? I'm your pal. I'm your pal Mary. Mary News is fine but winning the caddy tournament is what really matters. Lou, Mary, Mary, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou. Ted Baxter with the news. This question I pose to the audience. What does Mary Tyler Moore have between her boobs that a young woman doesn't? What Mr. Knight? A belly button. Mary, Mary, join Dr. Beeper and I. He's club champion and I'm no slouch myself. Oh my God, very funny. Oh my God, very funny. Lacey? This is the first time he did his Ted Knight on the show. Lacey! Lacey Underhalls? She was so hot, wasn't she? Who's banging Lacey? I would like to lose for my scratch mark. I love that movie. I want these shoes cleaned and bumped with a fine chamois. Now get to it, chop chop. Yes sir, yes sir. Why you son of a bitch? You hear the one about the colored boy, the Jew. Colored boy? Why you son of a bitch? I got her in Caddyshack again now. And he just started talking about that. I got it from a Negro. I see one more golfer on the golf course. I'm going to get a new greenskeeper. Is that clear? Mary? Look at your boobs Mary, what happened? I'm glad I'm dead. You'll get nothing and like it. Faulty! You're no gentleman. Hey, I'm no doorknob either, alright? You're something, huh honey? You must have been something before electricity. Last time I saw a face like that it had a hook in it. Oh, I should have said two. And I never slice. Faulty and Anthony. There's no level too low that you guys won't stick to. I have a scanner, I've had one for years. And yeah, you can pick up cell phones and cordless phones. And the conversations I've heard over the years, hysterical. I heard, I was out in the Hamptons once, listening to phone calls. And a couple of, you know, a gay guy talking on the phone, you know, as they were. Gay guy. Now they were talking about fisting. Really? Yeah. It was hysterical. Sitting there like, listen to this guy, going, you know, I'll bury it up to the elbow. Whoa! Whoa! Wow! I heard break-ups, drug deals, affairs. It was great entertainment. You'd have to sift through all the crap, you know. I'll be home in an hour, honey. Oh, great. Good call. Tell them about the call. We heard that one night. Oh, what up? In the apartment? Yeah. We're all hanging out drinking at Anthony's place, checking out the scanner. Yeah. Checking out the scanner, you know, and got a nice strong signal. Heard some girl talking on the phone. And she's talking to some guy about how her boyfriend sucks and how she kind of wants to get together with this guy and blah, blah, blah. So at one point, we're listening to the scanner, but we're also joking around, laughing. And at one point, I guess we were laughing and I slammed the floor with my foot. Opie stomped on the floor. You know how you do that? I was laughing so hard, right? A real knee-slapper type thing. So all of a sudden, the girl on the phone that we're listening to on the scanner goes, Oh, people upstairs again banging. Like, holy jeez, it's that person downstairs. And then she starts going, oh, it's not the first time they walk around up there like elephants. I think they must weigh 500 pounds. And then she starts saying, this is me, Jen, Opie, and his girlfriend Sandy sitting there. I think there was another couple there too, making it more embarrassing. And we hadn't been on the air long together, so it's not like we had a friendship, really a good friendship. You're still getting to know each other. Yeah, still getting to know each other. This goes way back. Go ahead. So then she's like, and their bedroom is right over mine. So all I'm hearing at night is, ah, ah, ah, ah, boom, boom, boom, the bed. Ah, ah, ah. I just heard Beat Rad. I'm looking, Opie's laughing his ass off. All night long. Ah, ah, ah, ah. It's disgusting. Right. Oh, well, maybe it's not downstairs. But it was downstairs. It was, because then we started effing with her. Because then we decided to play interactive phone call. Phone call. I believe it was Halloween night. So she was kind of scared to be alone. She was talking to the sky. Well, and I mean, your apartment complex, pretty much everyone was scared to be alone on Halloween night. Oh my God. But when you look outside and you see somebody just bagged a zebra and dragging it back into their lean tube, I was in a bad neighborhood, man. When it would rain, I swear to you. When it rained? It was the highlight of the day for the six billion little children that lived there because they could play in the pothole puddles. It was like a little pool for them. I was just waiting for one of them to go to the shores of one of the puddles and have a croc come and grab them. Drag them in. I swear to this neighborhood. There was, there were people, it was an apartment building. Right. Outside of the little porch of your apartment, someone had fenced off a whole area, planted grass, and was raising chickens. I swear to you. It was the community property. Yeah, it was, like you took up three people's backyards because no one had a yard. You had a cement patio with a wrought iron fence around it. That's your yard. This guy decides, you know, I'm going to make a fence. I'm going to make a fence and raise a chicken just like I did back in Puerto Rico. And they would fence off the area. Beautiful lawn. I mean, he had it well kept. Raising chickens. So freaking funny. A frightening neighborhood. The second I moved in, like what floor do you want to stay? What's the top one? I want the high ground. Love the high ground. Every night the police were there. There was something going on. Some domestic dispute going on. Someone's head was going through a wall. It was wonderful. So we listened to the lady downstairs on the scanner. So she's kind of scared and she's talking to this guy. So we decide to go out onto the porch, which is right above her porch, three high, and throw things at her sliding glass door from our porch. So we take a little piece of candy and stuff and lean it over, winging it. So we hear it hit the door and hear her go, my God, what was that? It was just so much fun because we're listening to the conversation and controlling what she's saying. Then we decide we were going to ring her buzzer and run. So it was down on the first floor. I'm on the third floor. So Opie goes downstairs to the buzzer. And after coaxing him for a half hour, come on, you got to do it, you got to do it, buzzes it. I hear him start running up the stairs. You can hear it on the phone. On the phone. And then I just hear this horrible, he tripped going up the stairs. Some getaway. Because she was on the second floor, so we had to run past her floor to get back upstairs before she opened the door. Because we were paranoid, convinced that if she opened up her door and I'm just casually walking like I'm there visiting you, that she was going to bust us. And it turns out, the whole end to this whole thing is we got the guy late. Because she got so scared at what was going on, she said, you better come over here. He's like, oh really? She's like, yeah, I'm very scared. Well, it's important to the story. The guy talking to this lady was trying to pick her up the whole time. And she's like, no, no, kind of give him the brush off. My boyfriend's driving by. We got her so freaked out by the end of the conversation. Yeah, she invited him over for the night. Scanners are fun though, man. They just have a blast with those things. That's a great story. We forgot all about that. Opie and Anthony. It's Kevlar kind of day. 1027 WNEW. Hello? I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here. That has no place on this show. Opie and Anthony. More stupidity on the way. 1027 WNEW. Yeah, I almost didn't make it in. What do you mean you didn't almost make it in? Very close. Well, I was on my way in. Again? Again? I know. I'm like Rodney King these days. Jesus, you're way in the lead. We used to have a competition to see who could get pulled over the most. Yeah, but as far as getting tickets, you're still in the lead. I talked my way out of it. I just don't drive anymore, so I'm saving myself a lot of money. I'm driving down Broadway in a black car. The light in the windshield pulls me over. Pull the truck over. Pull the truck over. How close to work were you? Very close. Like a block or two? Why do we always get pulled over right around our neighborhood? I was going to stop at the bank real quick and do some banking. I wasn't even going to double park. I was waiting for one of the cars to leave so I wouldn't have to double park while I went into the bank. I was sitting there. That bone sucker! That sucker! I'm like, what did I do? He says you've got to brake light out. I guess I did. I didn't know. I'm very grateful if an officer points that out to me. What a kiss ass. Shut up. I could have been in jail. Shut up. I could have used the day off. We have a new policy. One of us is sick or in jail. The other guy doesn't have to work. Do you know what the hell would happen if I was in jail? And the listeners find out the barrage of abuse I get? Forget about it, man. Bubba would love you in jail, too. I don't think I'd be going to that jail. I don't think they send you to that jail. Don't worry. I'll mix up, you're saying. Before you know it, I'm the queen of the weight room prom. I get pulled over. Brake lights out. Sure. Give them my license, which is still a mass license. Jesus Christ, I've got to get this straightened out. With mass plates, too, right? Yeah. He says that's another reason they pull people over. You get an out-of-state plate here in the city. You figure you're out of state to get new plates because you've got a problem here in New York. So they run my license. He comes back. You've got a suspended license. Like what? I pay my tickets. I know you hear that all the time, but I paid my tickets. It's not December, you've got a ticket and a suspended license. Okay, very funny, Opie. So, you guys are really funny. So I said I paid it because, no, I didn't pay it. You're going to have to come with us down to the precinct. I'm like, oh no, I'm going to jail. Oh no, this isn't happening. Wait a minute, I almost got away from those chicks when they tried to handcuff us here in the studio. Maybe I could get away from these two big guys. And I'm looking at two uniformed guys on the sidewalk. I'm like, if I make a run for it, I could probably disappear into Times Square. They'd never find me. I'd be face first before I even passed my wheel well. I'd be like, in the pavement. Why are you wearing a white beater T-shirt today in the studio? I didn't do nothing. You didn't see any kiddie pulls on the streets of Manhattan to hide under? F you! Should I hit? I should have ran. I'd be in the police car, the backseat handcuff banging my head against the window trying to get out. Yeah, you effing cops, man! I've got to go to work. I've got to go to work. But then I have to play the card. At that point, it's like it's not just getting out of ticket. I'm going to jail. So I go, I can't go to jails now. I'm on the air in a half hour. I'm on the air on the Oprah and Anthony show on the air radio, N.E.W. Thank God one of the guys knew who I was. Yeah, yeah. I know those guys. Yeah, well. So they say, well, I got to get, they quizzed me a little bit about my license, date of birth, where I went. I guess they were from the island because they were quizzing me about Huntington, what school I went to, what year, blah, blah, blah, everything, the whole thing. He goes, all right, well, you better get this taken care of. You know, some guy might pull you over and really arrest you. He's like, oh, thank you. Thank you. But he goes, you better mention this on the air at two o'clock because if you, if this isn't you, because they didn't know. He goes, how could he prove that it's you? You know, what am I supposed to do? Go break into my Dyson presence? Hey officer, huh? You should have done some of your voice. All right, you pulled me over, huh? What's the matter, slow day? Where's the crack heads? All right. Yeah, I didn't want to get into that. But, uh, oh, mucho apreciado, officer. And then I find out because I come to the station and I try to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. Smart guy. I call up motor vehicle, they punch up the ticket. You actually got through? Yeah, I know. That's a miracle in itself. They punch up the ticket. It was that seatbelt ticket I got in December, remember? That we talked about. Sure. I paid the $45 that it said to pay. $55. For 10 bucks, I'm ready to get hauled in. So now I got to go to motor vehicle and pay the $10 that are left. But probably now it's $110 because I didn't pay it. But, uh, and now I can't drive. I can't drive until I get this taken care of. Oh, yeah. If I get pulled over, I'm screwed and I got a brake line out. I might as well just down a 50 jack on my way home, too. You're like, you're not driving home to Brooklyn tonight. Who are you kidding? Dude, thank God they didn't see the kilo of coke in the back. Shut up. Oh, my God. It was like right underneath the carpet in the back. Kilo of blow. And the dead hooker beneath the back seat. Well, the shovel should have gave us gave that away. I was kicking it away with my foot. You could smell dead hooker on the whole vehicle. I was amazed. You got to get the secret compartments like the rap guys. I need the trap. The trap. The trap like Puffy. It needs a trap. And you know me, you know, the way I look and stuff. I'm reaching for my glove compartment to get the Reggie and I got like both hands up. Hello. Not going for a weapon. Don't worry. Watch. I could take my wallet out without my hands. So we got to thank New York's finest. Yeah, thanks guys. That was pretty cool. You know, they could have brought me in and stuff. Because if it wasn't for them, we would not have a radio show today. That's the truth. No. Yeah. God, I would have laughed my balls off if at 2 20 when we had to go on the air. I'd call up. You'd call up from like to join your one phone call. I know. Wouldn't that be great? Um, Alpie? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What's up? Not much. Um, you want me to check your stocks for you? No, no. Um, you usually call this time to check your stocks. Oh, I'm in jail. I got locked up. But, uh, woof. All right. I dodged the bullet. Must have felt like old dirty. This is, this is debauchery mania. Prostate exam for everyone. One one one one two seven WNEW. Alpie and Anthony, in my day, radio was boring all the time. And we liked it that way. And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath. What the hell is that? That's the dude from the Simpson. Rock. How cool is that? Gotta thank, uh, gotta thank Psycho Mark and Jimmy. Uh, that's Paul right? Cast uh, I wanna say Castellano. No, Dan. Dan Castellano. I'm thinking like, I'm thinking like cartoons and maw figures. Yeah. Well, you know the deal. The guy that's like half the voices on the Simpsons was in here today. Psycho Mark and Jimmy, uh, they were in here today. And they were like, uh, they were like, uh, they were like, uh, Psycho Mark and uh, Jimmy, totally taking care of the radio show for once. Nice. And got, got him to cut some, uh, some nice liners for our radio show. What other ones we got? Oh, you wanna hear all of them? I haven't heard them yet. Alright. I wanna hear them. Let me get in here. What's this music in the background? Yeah. It's a little weird. This is a little too disco-y for me. Yeah. Sound like we ought to be a carat. Hold on. Let me get rid of this stupid music bed. Thank you. I don't know if I like that one. Alright. Here's our Simpson, Simpsons liners. Hey kids. It's your old pal Krusty. And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy, I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show. Syndication now. Wait, he'll say anything, huh? Who cares, man? It's great. Alright. We got that one. We got this one. Quimby. Good day, New York. I, Mayor Quimby, would like to be your senator. If elected, I would use your tax dollars to put Opie and Anthony on radio stations across this great land. Syndication now. Syndication now. That's great. What else we got here? We got Homer. Whiff em up, Wednesday! Woohoo! That's you. Homer. We have another Homer. The Tuesday Hummer Club? I'll be sure to bring my kazoo. Bring it, Homer. That's great. My kazoo. This just made my day. One more here. Opie and Anthony. Those guys are likewits. I can drink em both under the table. That's pretty cool. Gotta thank Psycho Mark, man. Good job. Thank you, Mark. And Jimmy. I said Jimmy, too. Awesome. So what's up, Anthony? What up, man? How was your little weekend? We weren't here yesterday, were we? No, we were not. We finally took a day. Yeah. Very relaxing day. Very nice. I stayed in the city. Did you? Yeah. I've been here since Sunday afternoon. Wow. It's been a freaking fortune, man. Yeah, it's not cheap staying in New York, man. That's for sure. That's what you gotta do after you check out strippers all night long and you wanna make good with your woman. I wasn't gonna touch on that subject. Well, everyone else is touching on it on the email and the instant feedback. Call me a pussy. That's what I had to do. But whatever. I guess a lot of people are curious as to what happened Valentine's Day. It seems there was a little rift in the Opie-Sandy relationship when we last checked in with you guys. Last week you had gone to the booby bar. Privilege, right? And I don't know, the way you were talking about it, you got a little upset. It was a hangup on the phone and that's the last I heard. So you had a good Valentine's Day? I had, to be totally honest with you, the best Valentine's Day. Really? Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. Can't really make a radio bit here. Just had a really good time. Oh, cool. It cost me a fortune, like I said. But I figured I had to step up. Step up. Once again, avoiding the whole engagement ring thing. Very good. What did you do this year? Well, you block the thoughts out of the head when you start throwing nice hotel rooms at them and this and that. All day massages, you know. Oh, really? All these things you could do to get out of that. Did she go to the spa? Well, she will now. I got the certificate, like I said I was doing, for Maximus. Maximus Day Spa. Where? Westbury, right? Karl Place. Karl Place? Nice. So I got that, the hotel rooms. She surprised me, though. Why? It takes a lot to surprise me, especially in a relationship. Yeah. You know? And I mean, I'm usually happy, but it's nice to get a surprise. And she had a little envelope. I opened it up. Tickets to see Beck last night. Hey, look at that. I don't know if many people know about my music taste, but Beck is one of my favorites. Yeah, by far. New album's great. Odellay, in my opinion, the best album to come out in the 90s. So where was he? Radio City Music Hall. Oh. Bunch of freaks, though, man. Yeah. I'm starting to get out of touch, I think. Because we consider ourselves hip, right? No. We don't have it going on, man. I wouldn't sit there and call me and say I'm Mr. Hipness. I know I'm... Well, we try. We try, you know, to stay on that level, but... Try to at least stay in touch with what's going on. Oh, man. I went to the Beck show last night at Radio City Music Hall. Yeah. Oh, a freak show. Really? We are on freak shows. The styles. Styles I would never be caught wearing, even on Halloween. Oh, yeah, I don't know. That's the younger generation, I'll think. Well, that's what I'm starting to realize. We're losing touch in our 30s. There's like a generation gap happening there. Sure. You know? Well, that's all right. But no, Beck was unbelievable last night. Awesome. I saw Sean Lennon there. Oh, yeah? Five feet away from the guy. Yeah? Looks exactly like John, with Asian features. With the Yoko thing thrown in there. Yeah. It was cool seeing him. Should have asked how Yoko was. Yeah. They get along really well these days, don't they? I was going to yell, duck. God damn it. That's awful. Oh, Jesus Christ. What the hell is that? So how was your weekend, Anthony? Great. Yeah? I had a great weekend. A lot of fun. That's Anthony's life. Fun. Fun, fun, fun. What did you do for Valentine's Day? Check this out, ladies and gentlemen. Well, first, of course, Sunday night, I had a pisser at the J. Moore show. Fair rascal. Yeah, we got to talk about that today as well. I think J. Moore's coming in today. Really? Yeah, because he wants to recap the whole weekend. That's cool. And we got Buddy Hackett's number. Yeah. All right, well, you want to talk about the J. Moore show? Yeah. I'm going to talk about the J. Moore show. All right, well, you want to talk about the J. Moore show as well here? Well, little Bill, just talk about what I did. Okay, good. We had a great time, rascals. Man, did they hook us up. Huh. Huh. You're a pisser, man. The limo's out back, parked out back. We go to walk out and stuff. Me and Opie, they gave us two limos. Yeah. What's up with that? Because it's like, I am so not used to that kind of treatment. And we usually go together. We're like John and Paul now from the Beatles. We're getting our stuff from the Beatles. Get away from me, Paul. Yeah, so we don't get limos often. That's the truth. No, it was cool. And it was kind of a truck, kind of a long trip. So it was nice to have the limo in the back and stuff. And leaving the club after a great time. Did you have the listeners waiting outside in the rain for you too? Yeah, it was kind of cool. Signed a few things, a couple of pictures, you know. And then I'm like, look guys, you can only sign a few here. I got to go. Rushed off into the limo. I only could sign a couple. That's it. I'm only good for a couple tonight. No, the only reason I said that is because there were two people out there. I had some of that good limo sex. Did you really? Oh, partition went right up. That's dangerous, man. No, it's fun. Windows all steamed up. You know what that does to the limo? Got to the house, the limo driver has to crack the door a little at the back because he's not sure what's going on back there. Because he knows what's going on there. They could feel every pounding in the front seat. That was good. Had a good Valentine's Day, went shopping. That was Valentine's Day. Got a foosball table. Not kidding. My buddy Anthony is turning into Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. What? You've traded in the old model for a new model. Oh my God. You traded in the knickknacks for foosball tables and large screen TVs. You've got the biggest bed known to man now, ever. We've got to call the Guinness Book of World Records because I'm convinced you have the biggest bed in the entire world. And it's not only big, it's very thick. The thing is like 15 inches thick. It's a sick mattress. And that's just the mattress. You're just like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. I need like a step stool to get up in the bed. You've got a foosball table for Valentine's Day. Foosball table. Dude, great. That's hilarious. Play some foosball. Why not? Yeah. I can't wait for you to throw your first like little party over there. Toys. That's the key. Toys. All right, Kevin Spacey. Love it. You can trade in your radio job to work like the drive-thru? Don't be silly. Don't be silly. The foosball table, please. I love foosball. I used to play all the time down there. It was a people's pub down there in East Northport. I played all the time. And I always said, you know, I would love, dream would be to have a foosball table. Why didn't you get one the last 10 years? Well, I'll be on a foosball table. I didn't quite go with the motif. The rest of the house, I wouldn't think. You know what I mean? I don't know. You're digressing. That's hilarious. Digressing? Is that it? Well, from what I am accustomed to seeing you, the environment I'm accustomed to seeing you in. Oh, yeah, you're digressing. It's fun. Your old house had nothing that was related to you in it. The computer. There was a computer, but everything else was knickknacks and... Right. Pottery and knickknacks and little things to make the place look knickknacky. Right. Nice. And now your new place, you've got pretty much a... Toys. A sex bed, a large screen TV, and a foosball table. Computer room. And a computer room. And let's see, big TV. Oh, PlayStation games strewn about the place. It's hysterical. Yeah, videos, computer games, and yes, when it gets delivered, because I don't have it yet, but two weeks, get delivered, the foosball table is going where normally there would be a dining room table. But since there's no eating like in the traditional sense, you need the foosball table. So basically you've got like the Joey and Chandler pad. Yeah! From friends. Yeah! That's pretty much it. The Joey and Chandler pad. You have the big recliner too? Oh no, that comes soon. A little sectional couch with two recliners. And a thing that folds out so you can put your drinks on? No, I don't have that. You don't have that? Got some kind of wacky table though for the sectional couch. It's shaped like a pie wedge so it fits in the sectional thing. And the whole top of the table comes up and towards the couch if you're eating off of it. Since you can't even eat in the dining room because there's a foosball table there. That's great! It's kick ass! That rocks. It would be the pride of any 15 year old. I swear to God. Where's the pinball machine? Hey Lou, what's going on? Yo! How are you, Lou? Anthony had a little fun in limo, huh? Yeah, he had to share with everyone that he had limo sex on the way home from Nebraska. He said he put the partition up. One thing you might not know, I drive for a living. I limit it. There's also an intercom. Oh yeah, I don't care. You want to listen? Good, have fun. Just make sure you drive while you're spanking one out. Who cares? I don't care if he's holding a straight line. I don't care what he does. Alright, I'll let you in on that. Not too many people know about that. They put the partition up, they start going out, you feel it up front, the intercom goes on, you hear everything. Wow! Just fill you in on that. I didn't know you knew. Thank you, Lou. Alright, take care guys. Alright, man. Later, man. Let's go to Eric. Eric, you're next on WNEW. What's up? Hey guys, how you doing? Eric calling. I want to know if you're allowed to spin the foosball guys. That's the number one rule. Oh no. Eric, Eric, are you a foosball player? Well, you know, it's been a long time since college. Sometimes you go into the house, they let you spin. There's no spinning. No spinning. No spinning. No, wait, wait. There's no spinning in foosball. Hold on, hold on. Cute chicks can spin. Okay. See, see. I'll tell you. That's it. What can I tell you? You're face to face with a guy at the foosball table. He spins it. You call him a pussy and grab your beer and walk away. Yeah. No spinning. Especially if he's winning at the time. There's no spinning. Isn't that great? You're playing foosball, you calculate, you know all your cool moves and everything and the guy at the other side is just spinning and he's knocking him in left and right. Look, I'm beating you. Yeah, I'll be beating you. Shut up. You're not playing right. Oh, lovely bank shot from the rear. Oh, wham. We had similar Valentine's Day, Anthony. Yeah? I spent my day with my wife, I mean my TV. That was the best Valentine's Day I've ever had. All right, Eric. Thanks a lot, guys. J. Moore rules. He's coming in again today. That's the best thing I heard all day. I heard it. Rand told my partners. The best thing. I don't know when. I think sometime in the four o'clock hour. Excellent. Thank you, Eric. Thanks, guys. Bye. I was with that. Check. Please. I think they can figure that out at this point. I don't know. He seems to think I was sitting in front of the television. No, you were playing like solo foosball. Dan, what's up? Hey, guys. I applaud you, Anthony. I've got a similar setup to my pad. Oh, yeah? It has a buddy of mine pool table and a dining room, 60-inch TV, DVD, VCR, a computer game room where my buddy and I are playing Team Fortress online together. Oh, rock. You know something? You know how close I was to buying an air hockey game? I swear to God, but you know why I didn't? There's only one reason. I didn't buy the air hockey game. No room. No, no. There's room in the dining room for foosball and air hockey. We have a little Italian landlord living downstairs. He'd freak out. What's going on upstairs? Because the foosball doesn't make as much noise as like air hockey. Wham, wham. It makes a lot of noise. Just turning it on. Just the noise factor. That was the only reason, or I would have also had an air hockey game. You are Kevin Spacey. Why? I'm convinced. American Beauty. You're losing your mind. Games, fun, toys. Come on. That's what it's about. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, guys. All right, we've got to take a break. We're just getting warmed up, obviously. A lot of good phone calls on hold. Please stay there if you want in on the conversation. 212-757-1027. We're going to pull a call up. You treat them like good people. You don't talk down to them. Hey, f*** you. Jesus Christ, shut up. You idiot. You're such a loser. Hey, f*** you. What a retard. You're high. You stupid. Hey, f*** you. The Opie and Anthony Show. 1027-WNEW. I really like the production Jimmy's doing for our show lately. Funny. Very good. Our phone number, 212-757-1027. Fax line is 212-957-9639. Just getting back into the radio show after taking a long weekend. A lot of partying was going on over the weekend. Had a lot of fun with J. Moore at Rascals down there in Oceanside. What a pisser, man. Awesome. We kind of wrecked this show though. The second show Sunday night. It turned into like Opie and Anthony debauchery. It was the Opie and Anthony J Show. We ended up on stage with J for like 15 minutes trying to convince a girl to show her boobs to the whole crowd. She did. I look to my right. There were a bunch of girls that were there with dates and stuff. It was their little Valentine's Day celebration. It was pretty obvious to me. They were horrified and pissed off. They were just pissed. They were like, no, we came here to see some good solid comedy, which J did. He delivered big time. But in the middle of the show all of a sudden it's you and I up there drunk with our Budweiser trying to get a girl to flash the crowd. I'll tell you though, I had to prove that I could work the pimp hand and get that girl to take her shirt off. You did a fine job, Anthony. I mean, it took some coaxing, some talking, but she did. Yeah. Finally showed the crowd. Yeah. And they dug it. Yes, they did. She's on the wall. And then J got right back into his show. You want to talk to the girl that flashed the crowd? Oh, yeah. Kristen, what's up? Hey, how are you? Hey. What's going on? Not much. You were the girl that flashed everyone on Sunday? Yeah. My aunt was very horrified. Oh, yeah, your aunt was there and stuff? Yes. They came upstairs, like the backstage area after the show. Yeah. And stuff were hanging out. Yeah. You and your aunt. Yes, my aunt. That was fun. Did you have a good time? Yeah, whatever. I'm good like that. What's the matter? Are you pissed off or something? Yeah, what's the problem now? No, no, no. I was just running in the house because I'm on my cell phone. Oh, I see. She sounds a little aggravated, I'll think. Yeah, you called our show. What do you got? What do I got? I just wanted to say hi. All right. Well. I hope you enjoyed the show. Yeah, we had a great time. You were definitely a hit down there, rascals. Oh, thank you. And I guess we're going to have you come in for Lesbian for a Day soon, huh? You can have me come in. I don't know about Lesbian for a Day. We'll talk about it off the air, I guess. All right, Kirsten. All right. Well, we've got to get back to our radio show. No problem. Well, thank you. No problem. Talk to you soon. All right, bye. Bye. Goddamn. Yuck. Porn teeth. Hey, Ralph, you're next on N.E.W. What's up? Hey, what's up, boys? Hey. I saw Louis Black this weekend at Bananas and Hasbro Kites. Oh, yeah? Unbelievable, Ralph. Is he great? I still haven't seen him do his act. I hear he's just unbelievable. Oh, so intense, man. Yeah, the guy's like... Pinching our pants. There's like six of us. Yeah. A whole bunch of people took a girl on a date. Great date. It's like he's having a stroke up on stage. Totally. I was waiting for it. I hear it's like... He's having a stroke. I hear it's like he's having an epileptic seizure. I hear it's like he's having a stroke. I hear it's like he's having an epileptic seizure. I hear it's like he's having an epileptic seizure on stage. He's just like freaking out. He does this thing with his fingers? My friend Jenny wanted to give him finger puppets and make them fight. Yeah, we've seen it here. When he goes off on a tear and he's feeling like passionate about a subject, his fingers start twitching all over the place. He's convulsing. He was unbelievable. I mean, he's funny on the show and he's funny on The Daily Show. I hear his stand-up is just... But live, he was outrageous. Yeah, really smart guy, too. Something happened in his ass. Yeah, cool. It wasn't like, you know, bs. You just said the S-word. My bad. That's all right, Ralph. It sure beats seeing female comedians. Yeah. Who are you, Jerry Lewis? Well, we admitted that on the show for different reasons. I hate female comics. We have a female comic that just comes out when she comes on the air or on TV, sitting there watching. You have to tune away instantly. See, I was reading that thing in the paper today. I'm like, well, what's the big deal? Until I realized that he took it a little further and said he can't get past the fact that they're just baby-making machines or something like that. Whoa, Dean. Whoa. That's what he said, right? Yeah. Jerry Lewis, totally bashing female comics. I was applauding him at first. I'm like, yeah, I agree. The female comedians just blow. I mean, they all do the exact same act. Yeah. And don't tell me Margaret Pio or any of those are good. Jeanine Garofalo. Jeanine Garofalo. They all suck. The only one that's kind of amusing is the deaf one. Oh, she is so bad. But because- Margaret Pio. No, because she's deaf. Ma'am, I go out there. I want to tell them I'm deaf. I think they can figure it out when you go, hello. We interviewed her in LA a few years ago. LA? A few years back. And I purposely made sure I was turning my head away when I was asking her questions just to hear her say what. I was practicing my ventriloquism. Because she reads lips, you know? Yeah. So watch it. This is really good visual for radio, but watch out. Here's me. Here's me that. So what's it like, Dean of Stand Up Comic? You're not moving your lips. Nothing. Yeah. And I'm making a puppet voice. I can't understand you. You have to move your lips. Hey, how you doing? Nice can. I'm looking at you, you deaf bitch. Get out of here. Now I'm talking to you, do you? I'm just smiling at her. Like I'm doing that ventriloquist smile. They got a smile. Hey, you effing C-word. Wow, you did that pretty well. Yeah, I've been practicing. That's bizarre. I'm going to get a dummy to play foosball with. And then she just stares at you like a deer looking at headlights. Yeah. Trying to figure out what you're saying. I can't understand what you're talking about. Hey, you're deaf, huh? So she's kind of a mute. Yeah. I'm not a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute. I'm a mute.

I'm a mute. The only reason I didn't go down the floor today is I forgot my suit and they don't let you do that. I'm going to get jacket and tie. Oh really? Yeah. Oh I would have went then. Oh we could do it that way. I wanted you to come too because I didn't get to see you last time you came down. Well we'll be down there soon. Why don't you come this week? I might be in the city later this week, maybe. I thought you guys work in the city. We do but we commute. Ah. Yeah. Is this on the air? Yeah it's on the air Amy. I'm a fast worker. What do you do Amy? I'm a fast worker. You are huh? So why aren't you working? I just took a break. I said I was going to see you this evening. He said they didn't come. It's a close up. How does a stockbroker take a break with a half hour left before closing? What do you mean? That's how the actions happen around now. I'm quiet today. The last hour is where all the action takes place. You don't see stockbroker Dave on the phone with us at 3.35. Sorry Dave. He's going to dial you. Oh Amy. He's right here. I'll call him right now. Amy. Yeah. Give me your whole take on E-Trade on the stock. Oh on the stock exchange? What's the problem with it? I don't follow those kinds of stuff. What do you do? You know what? I just got an order. Hang on one sec. Oh see she's bugging out. Who's this? This is Timmy. Timmy what's up? What's up brother? It's Opie and Anthony. We got you live on the radio. Really? Yeah. What's going on man? Are you a stockbroker on the floor as well? I met you guys man. I told you about the world hidden old joke. I remember that. So what's hot today down there on the floor? I've been busy man. I've been busy with all the crap. Really? Yeah. Hold on. No one wants to give any info down there. Hello? Hello? I think he hung up on us. I'm not sure though. What did he say? He goes, yeah they did hang up on us. Alright we've got to move on. That's fine. Jesus. Let's go to Jamie. Jamie you're next on WNEW. What's up? Jamie! Hello? Jamie! Stop listening to your radio. Oh. Jamie! We were off one day and everyone forgets the rules Opie. They're listening to us. What is your name? You! What is your name? Hello? What a loser. You've got to wait for the delay to catch up to the radio so they know that we're talking to them. Hello? Listen to the radio. Listen. Hey douchebag. Oh hello? Douchebag! The guy who wants to talk about female comedians. Oh my god. Why would you just call the show and sit there? Goodbye. Good day sir. Charlie from Jersey, Gilda Radner. The funniest woman ever on TV. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The funniest woman ever on TV. She was funny on SNL. Never saw her stand up though. I'm talking about stand up comedians. Yes. That's not like a stand up thing. That's sketch comedy and stuff and that's fine. But stand up comics. You go to the club. James what's going on? How are you doing? Yeah what's up man? Yeah we're just listening to the E-Trade thing. Yes. Let me ask you a question. How many people do you know that any day traders that have passed the series 7? Huh? Did you ever hear of the series 7 for stock brokers? Yeah. Probably the third toughest test in the nation. That's how stock brokers become stock brokers. Right. No day trader is really knowledgeable on that. Uh huh. I mean it's got to be ridiculous to see an E-Trader or look at the Atlanta thing. But James he's talking about E-Trade as a stock. I'm talking about the stock behind the company. Right. I want to know why it's been pegged down to 20 for a good month. You can pick up shares of E-Trade. That's what we're talking about. Why is it so low right now? I thought I couldn't help you on my end. I'm not just not an analyst. Alright man. Alright thanks. Thank you. Thank you for your call though. Boy that helped. Patrick you're next on any W. Could someone put a crowbar over my head today? I want to go home and play foosball. I think everyone took off yesterday. We took off. Our listeners took off. Yeah. Patrick! Yes how are you? Hey good what's up? Um I was watching on Comedy Central at Polar Pound Stone Jack. Yeah? She's a female comedian. She's not that bad. Oh and thank God she's so attractive. Well that's another story. Well I don't, my comedians don't have to be attractive. No I just have to be funny. Yeah. I don't find it's actually distracting if a girl comic is attractive. You know? I don't find it. You don't listen to the jokes. I don't find Polar Pound Stone funny at all. No. I can't think of one female comedian that I saw you know on stage that I thought was funny. Can't think of one. Yeah it's hard. It's tough. Elaine Boozler a little bit. A little bit. Alright that's all I got. Alright man thank you. Yep. Now people are going to argue what you know their favorite female comedian. Yeah that's ridiculous. Martin what's up? What's up man? You're like Margaret Chubb. Sorry sorry. Oh you're cursing. She's got good ass you should say okay? Alright she's got some good ass. The bit about the drug dealer have you ever heard that? No I'm sure you'll translate it just fine. Mine will suck but she talks about how you have to make fake conversations when you're trying to buy drugs. Something we can all relate to. Yeah a long time listener man. I remember when you had like semi-sonic in the imaginary ballroom. Oh my god. Wow. Alright Martin thank you. Alright bye. Bye. He redeemed himself there. Brett Butler is good. Good comics are dykes. We don't want to talk about female comics. We just kind of agreed with Jerry Lewis except for the line about being you know baby making machines. Baby making machines. Monkey from wherever. The only funny female comics are the dead ones. What does that mean? Alright we better take a break and regroup here. My god man. Carol wants... Hey Carol. Carol. Yeah. We're going to come to you right after break alright? Okay. Stay right there. Okay. Carol went to a strip club for Valentine's Day. We'll get into her story next. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to go get some food. Get to the swing of things. It's weird when you take one lousy day off, man. I know. 2127571027 is our phone number. Lots to do today. Lots and lots of stuff. Jay Moore is stopping by. He's going to be leaving us soon and then we won't see him for another what? Four or five months. Yeah. It'll be sad. We should throw him like a going away party or something. Because he's just a huge friend of the show. Back out to Hollywood. Back out to Hollywood. In Vegas. He's doing a new movie and stuff. We're filming a movie with Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and the little kid from Sixth Sense. Yeah. Sixth Sense was nominated best picture this morning, by the way. Oh yeah? Does everybody by now know the ending of Sixth Sense? I hope so. Bruce Willis did through the whole thing. Best picture nominations, okay? You ass. I'm sure someone will go, dude, I was waiting for a video. The nominations, American Beauty. Yeah. I absolutely love that damn movie. The Cider House Rules. Chick Flick, right? Yeah. Kind of, I don't know. The Green Mile, which was pretty good. I didn't see that one either. Don't worry, people, I know the ending. The Insider, pretty good. Dry Sponge. The Insider was good. What? Did I say something? Yeah. And then the Sixth Sense. Yeah, it was good. I think they're going to give it to American Beauty on the Sixth Sense. Yeah? I think so. I didn't see American Beauty, so I don't know. I think Kevin Spacey is going to win Best Actor. I think Annette Bening is going to win Best Actress. And that's it. There you go. There's our conversation on the nominations. On the nominations. Now, there is one other thing we should talk about real fast. Do we have it queued up? Tell Carol to hold on. We're going to get to our strip club story in a second here. The Oscars nominated. Original song, Anthony? Yeah. They got a song from Music of the Heart. They got a song from Magnolia. They got a song from Toy Story 2, Randy Newman. Oh, please. And a song from Tarzan, Phil Collins, okay? Also nominated in the original song category for the Oscars coming up in March. Trey Parker. Really? For Blame Canada from the South Park movie. That was nominated? Yep. And just in case you forgot what that song is all about, let's play it real fast here, okay? Nominated for an Oscar, this little thing from South Park. Check it out. Uh-oh. There it is. Wow. Academy Award nominee. All right, so they're not going to win, obviously, but it's kind of cool that they're nominated. It's funny that they probably have to play a little piece of it, right? They're going to give it to Phil Collins for that stupid song from Tarzan. Guaranteed. God, my wife Phil Collins used to be relevant. I used to like Genesis growing up, too. Now it's like it's an embarrassment to even admit that Tarzan soundtrack. Let's go to Carol Anthony to get the show going here. Carol, you're next on any W. What's up? You were talking before about Valentine's Day? Yes. So my husband took me out for Valentine's Day, and then I took him out for Valentine's Day. We did it on Saturday, and I took him to a strip club. Oh, yeah? Which strip club you go to? There's one that didn't open up that long ago near Kennedy Airport. Okay. Do you know it? Is it one of those sleazy places? No, it's actually really nice. Should I tell you the name right now? Yeah, we don't care. It's called the Airstrip. The Airstrip. Oh, we've got a couple of the girls call us for the Airstrip. See, it's near the airport, and the girls strip, and the planes land on an Airstrip. It's a very clever name, Airstrip. And all the girls have landing strips in their pants. Yeah, landed on the grass runway. I'm sure my husband is probably listening right now, and he's probably freaking at calling you. That's kind of cool. That was your present to him, huh? And then I got a lap dance for him. You guys obviously went together. Did the girl lap dance for both of you? No, she lap danced for me. For you? For me. Did you check it out? Yes. Did you enjoy the lap dance? Yes. You're like just a few months away from a little threesome action. It was a gift for him. A romantic gift. That's pretty good. Well, congratulations. Thank you. There she goes, Carol, down at the Airstrip. She had a little different Valentine's Day celebration. Lisa, you're next on the show. What's up? Hey, guys. How are you doing? Good. My question is this. Who do you think they're going to get to sing this song? Every song that's nominated is sung on the award show. Oh, yeah? And how are they going to do it? That's a good question. There's a curse word in there, too. I know. A couple of them. A couple of them. And I'm really interested to see how they can play. They have a performance of every nominated song. Well, there's also another problem because the lady that sung the song, isn't she? She's dead. She's the dead one. A lot of times, they'll get somebody to perform it that didn't necessarily perform it. Well, they're like the bad version of it. Remember what happened to Phil Collins because he wasn't popular enough and he was nominated for one of these songs and they got someone else to sing his nominated song because they only want people on there that the audience really, really knows. Yeah, right. I mean, I could see them getting a group because it's kind of a group song. You know, but I heard the bleep and all of a sudden I'm like, how are they going to do that? Yeah, I'm amazed that it got nominated. We'll have to wait and see what they do. It should be interesting. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Lisa. See you later. Bye. Let's go to Jake. Jake, what's going on? Hey, guys. What's going on? Hey. Just forgot to share what I got my girlfriend there for on Valentine's Day. The clap? No. I got her a pair of boxers, her to sleep in, some shirts and the wackiest of things, but apparently she liked it. A bowling ball. You got your lady a bowling ball for Valentine's Day? A bowling ball. Very romantic. Hey, what are you going to say? That's good. Write that. What trail apart do you live in? Come on. A matching bag? No, she has a bag. It's a history place. Is it a pink bowling ball? Actually, it was only a glow in the dark thing. Are you guys in leagues and stuff together? No. Is she in a little league? No, not at all. It's something we do occasionally. It's not that bad. You go out, have a couple beers. You're not an occasional bowler if you have your own ball. Yeah, you got your own ball. You're bowling. Once, twice a month. You're a bowler. You got a ball. You're bowling. When I go to the bowling alley, which is rare, first of all, I drink more beers than balls I throw. Right? Yeah. What do you say? I used to be on a bowling league with the place I worked. God damn, a long time ago. Nav Tech Industries. I was on their bowling team. You were on their bowling team? Right up until the day I got fired. No, I had to leave that job because they were coming to repo my car. Remember that story? Yeah. That was the job you had when you were sleeping in your car and you weren't making your car payments? And I was all bummed, not because I lost the job, but because I was a bowling player. I was a bowling player. Yeah, it definitely brought my average down when I had to quit because repo man was going to take my car the next thing. That's funny. I knew where I worked. All right, Jake. Well, that's a good Valentine's Day gift there. Hey, man, I got to try. Hey, real quick. Do you guys catch Millionaire Sunday night where the guy called Rosie? Millionaire? Oh, yeah. I gotcha. He's calling Rosie. That fat pig. Who's that? That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. That's the guy who called Rosie. Who's that fat pig? Who's that? You're category eating. The question's about food. Call that fat slob Rosie. All right, man. All right, bro. Got a fax here if you want to send a fax, 2129579639. ONA, thank you. Because of you guys, I ordered a Vermont teddy bear on Sunday for my girlfriend. Well, it came yesterday, and you know what I got? A big, long hummer. Thank you. Wow. Thank you very much. Syndication now. We told you guys if you got the Vermont Teddy Bear for Valentine's Day you would get a Hummer. Yeah. There you go. A happy customer. Did you hear about that whole thing with Millionaire? There's a problem now that the insurance company that pays off the Millionaires, because that doesn't just come from the show. When they have to pay somebody, I think it's between the half million and a million dollars when they get up into that, the show doesn't have to pay. There's an insurance company. Sure. And if on the off chance someone gets over a half a million bucks, the insurance company has to pay out. They're all pissed because the English version of the show has never had a Millionaire. Because it's a lot harder, the questions and all that. So in the US I think they've had two so far. Plus there are just a bunch of limy, trunk bastards over there. They're retarded. I've been there. But Regis is bitching that I'm not changing the show. They want less insurance. Less intelligent players. That's harder questions. That's what they said. They said that the contestants are too intelligent. The insurance company said that. I need retards. Right, they can just have the short bus drive up. Drive it. I want someone in a hot seat with a hockey helmet. Get me Mongoloids, Gilman. I want to be looking at a line of down syndrome haircuts. When they spit that answer out I want to get hit with drool. Come on. I need tards. Get me Corky. Well that's celebrity millionaire. I want Corky. Get me pinheads. Pinheads anything. Deletamide babies. I need retards. Brain damage. Get me that chick that got the nail gun put through her head at the mall. That's pretty retarded. Yes, and bring them here. Retards. Get me that spaz kid from the Opie and Anthony show. Now that's pushing it. Very good. All right, we got to take a break here. Oh yeah? Steven Lynch made a paper on Sunday like we told you guys. Yeah, you see that. Article in the Post. Lame story. Julia Zabow, whatever her name is, she should be ashamed. That's one of the worst articles I've ever read in my life. Zabow. Stupid, doesn't go anywhere. And we'll read it next to just show how bad of a writer she is. In my opinion, Julia, you're a sucky ass journalist. Horrible. You should go to like the Globe or the Inquirer. I'm glad we blew you off ten times. Write about Batboy. Batboy scene. It's all about that killer kitten song. We'll get into that controversy next. Real fast as we take a break here, Ant. Very cool. There was Opie and Anthony signs all over the ball field yesterday. Last night at the WCW at NASA Coliseum, Spaz was there with a huge ONA WOW banner. Cole, also last night there was an ONA banner, well actually a bunch of them, at the Continental Arena for the Seton Hall-UConn game, which was a huge game last night. And all flags are courtesy of apolloflags.com or give them a call. 973-256-8362. Opie and Anthony. 1027-WNEW. Opie and Anthony. Those guys are lightweights. I can drink them both under the table. I love our new IDs. 1027-WNEW. It's the ONA show. J. Moore, a little later this hour, stopping in. He's going to be leaving us soon, for a while. He's got to go back, come back and make a movie. Go back to being a Hollywood star. Yeah, he'll be back in the future, I'm sure. Also a little later on we got to talk about Stephen Lynch. The article made the post over the weekend. Pretty much a non-article. It's an embarrassment to this writer, Julia Szabo. I'm so glad I didn't talk to her. She called our office about ten times. We blew her off. Thank God. They really don't want to be a part of this stupid little article she has. But real fast, Anthony, on the instant feedback, John from Karl Place. Anthony, please talk about The Sims. This game kicks ass. I got it over the weekend and I can't help tormenting these little creations of mine. Best game since Kingpin. Yeah, it's... We've been having fun with it in the office and then at home. Well, let's talk to Bill real fast too. Yeah, I'm going to fail this semester because of you, Anthony. I can't stop playing it. I've got two lesbians right now at home making out. One goes to work, the other bitch works out. You've got them to make out? Yeah. One of them just works out as the other one goes off to work? Yep. Hey, Bill, I've got to tell you, after Anthony talked about The Sims on Friday, one of my brother's friends ran out and got the game. I spent ten hours with a lesbian couple trying to get them to make out over the weekend and I didn't accomplish the feat. You've got to start slow. Well, I did start slow. A little talking first, maybe a little back rub, telling a few jokes, maybe complimenting the other one, and then slowly go to hugging and a little kiss and then before you know it, they're sharing a bed. Are they sharing a bed, Bill? Yeah, they share the same bed. Oh, that rocks. The first day, you get them, all their power levels are all up. All you do is you spend all the time just on social, nothing else, they fall in love with them like ten seconds. I've got to remember that. A couple of lesbos. That's great. Because my chicks, they got all depressed and stuff, the room wasn't right, the plants were dying. You've got to water those plants. You've got to keep them happy. The food had flies around them. Yeah, they're not cleaning up that good. The plumbing sucked. Well, thank you, Bill. No problem. All right, man. Well, and you've got to explain Sims again because honestly, God, this is like crack, this game. Yeah. Well, this is more addicting than Half-Life, even though Half-Life is a shoot-em-up type of game, this thing is just mental. I've got to explain because I've heard from a lot of people going, oh, dude, what are you talking about? That doesn't even compare to Half-Life. They're not meant to compare. They're two completely different types of games, completely. It's like the difference between an off-road vehicle and a roadster, you know? They're made for different things. I love Half-Life. I still play it all the time. I love to shoot them up first-person action. This, it's not an action game. You're not sitting there staring at the screen with the, sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. But like Opie said, it is crack. It is frigging crack sitting there. So far, I've concocted a couple, made everything from scratch. You could make everything from scratch, like Ann said. Or you could pick them out. You could give them different personalities. You could make the house and set it up any way you want. Yes, that's what I did. You could even pick their jobs. Yeah. They look for a job in the paper. You pick it or you don't pick it, you know? They're either nice people or not nice. They're neat or not neat. There's all the personality traits you could put in these little people that walk around in this little house. You buy them stuff. Make their lives a little easier. You upgrade their stoves and refrigerators. Maybe blow a wall out of their house and make the living room bigger so you could fit an electric train set in, keep them happy. Pinball machines. Pinball machines. All kinds of fun stuff. Fushball table. That's my house. And so what I've been working on is just a couple. Just a man and a woman in a house. Got them to fall in love. Now they're sleeping in the same bed. I'm getting all kinds of cool stuff for the house. Burglar breaks in. Steals the computer and the stove. So I had to get a burglar alarm. You live and learn. So then one day it's like, oh, the stork is coming. Going to bring a little bundle of joy for my little couple. I'm feeling great. I'm like, I'm working this game. It's coming out perfect. This is how this will go. Procreation. So a little bassinet. I'm moving into the bedroom. So they're close to the little kid. Kid starts crying. I send the mother over. There's a couple of options. You can either feed it, play with it, sing to it. So I'm feeding and singing to it and stuff. Eh. Beep beep. The car horn out front blows. You know what that means? Time for work. So I send them both off to work. Yeah. You got to make sure they get their carpool. Because you got to explain too that you send them to work. And every time they come home from work, it adds money to your bank account. Yeah, they make their money. And that's how you could expand your house and stuff. And buy cool stuff. And move forward with the game. Well, I got to tell you something. This was awful. Yeah. I totally didn't. I got so used to them just going to work that I didn't stop her from going to work. So the kids in the house all alone for eight hours screaming. A newborn. Wah! Wah! You know, a little prompt comes on the screen. SimCity's social services is taking the child away. And this big fat black lady walks in the house, grabs the kid, and walks out the door while they're at work. And then the husband and wife come home. Or the man and woman. They're not married yet. And then the woman gets all depressed because now the kid's gone. Of course. And that affects the game too because you got to keep these Sims people very happy. You got to keep them fed. You got to keep their hygiene. You got to keep them well. You got to keep them healthy. You got to keep them fed. You got to keep their hygiene up. If their bladder's full, you got to make sure they go to the bathroom. You got to pay your bills. Oh! I was playing a game this weekend, right, Ant? Yeah. There was two things I didn't do. One was I didn't check the mailbox. You got to check the mailbox every three days for bills and you got to pay the bills. And if you don't pay the bills while the couple is sleeping at night, there's this big black guy. Why is it a black guy? I swear to God, the black guy in the Sims game that comes to your house, not breaks. They just know how to get into your house and they repossess your stuff because you didn't pay the bills. Yeah. So he repossesses the stove in my game, all right, but they have to eat. So the lady is freaking out and every six hours she's calling the pizza dude. Yeah, they go to the phone and order pizza. And it takes like 40 bucks out of their money. And then the pizza dude comes up and there's a prompt that says, Oh, it only took me an hour to get here, dude. Are you sure that was a repo guy or was it just the rock coming in to rob the place? And the other thing that I did during my Sims game over the weekend, because I ended up getting a couple like you, but I just took over one of the families they have, which was a couple with this kid that was about 10, 11, 12 years old, that range. And you got to send them off to school every day. Sure, the school bus pulls up. You got to send them. Well, the best part of this game is just creating havoc. I mean, you could go and try to like pay the bills and keep the house clean and make sure the Fed and happy and, you know, kept comfortable, you know, putting them to bed when they're tired and stuff. But the best part of the game is just creating some type of havoc and seeing how it plays out. So I decide, you know what? The kid doesn't need to go to school anymore. So day after day, the school bus is pulling up in front of the house. Beep, beep, beep, beep. And it'll only wait, what, 20 minutes or so? And then the school bus takes off three days in a row. All of a sudden there's a prompt on the screen. Jimmy's missing a lot of school. And if he misses another day, there's going to be a problem. So I'm like, oh, cool. You got to hold him back. Oh, yeah, you got to hold him back. So the bus goes and Jimmy doesn't get on the bus. So it turns out that they're going to send him to military school to teach him some discipline. So all of a sudden he's in a military outfit and the mom and dad are like saying goodbye and crying and stuff. And next thing you know, he's out of the house for good. Gone. He's at military school. No more kid. You just lost your kid to military school. I wonder if he comes back later on. And then you got to keep up their skills. Yeah, their skill level. They got to read and sit down and read books on things to get their skill levels up and their social skills and build relationships with the neighbors. All of a sudden they're working around the house. You're pointing and clicking, making sure they're keeping the house clean, keeping their hygiene good, making sure they take a leak and stuff. And what happens? The neighbors come to the door. They want to visit. So now you've got to entertain the neighbors because if you just send them away they get pissed and your social standing in the neighborhood goes down. You run around like a chicken without a head pointing and clicking realizing this is what amounts to a digital ant farm. It's pretty much what you're doing. It's ridiculous. But it's like Opie said, it's like crack. It's so addicting. We were playing for two hours before the show today and we just started this family. We wanted to see how far we could take it because eventually I guess you build a huge mansion, you have other people living with you, as your money goes up. Unbelievable. I was playing over the weekend and I'm sitting there and the girlfriend goes out, comes back. I'm still playing. I go, oh that was quick. She goes, I've been gone for two and a half hours. I swear to God I thought it was ten minutes. Ten minutes. I've been gone for two and a half hours. Two and a half hours? Gee, I've been out there that long. You want to see your little people freak out and start a fire in the house. That's hysterical. That's something else too. You've got to read the books to get the cooking skills up. Because if the guy tries to cook without cooking skills, like one out of every four times he cooks he's going to start a fire. He's got to get his cooking skill level up. It's the funniest thing when that stove burns into flames and they start, they run around the house with this little bubble over their head with flames in it. They go, ah, ah. You've got to run to the phone and call the fire department. Or you do what I do and you just take your time going to the phone until the fire is so out of hand that one of them is going to lose their life. It spreads to all the other appliances and the walls. So the wife lost it, she's dead and now there's an urn in the middle of the room. Oh yeah. But then when they die you really feel really bad because you really start getting attached to these little creatures. I know when they die you move the urn outside and it becomes a tombstone and you can send them out there to mourn. Yeah and they'll sit next to the tombstone and just cry and stuff. Nick, what's going on? Yo, you guys are not kidding man. What, Sims? I played that game. And by the way this is not even an advertisement. No, they don't advertise on this show. This is just another one of those games that I came across and thought was great. Yeah and got me hooked on this damn thing. I got that game. I was waiting for something to come on TV. They kind of know it was ending so I'm like alright I'll keep playing. It was four hours later and I was like ah this game is boring. I'm not going to play no more. It was like four hours man. Yeah. You guys know how to get a ghost? No, you can get ghosts? If you got someone died right? Yeah. You bring the urn outside before anyone can mourn and a ghost will come around the house and scare the hell out of them. Oh wow! Are you serious? Oh yeah. That is awesome. Cause one of my guys fell in love with the other dude's wife. So he kept slapping the dude every time he kissed her. So I let him burn. And the guy burned and died and I put his urn outside and he had a ghost coming around. Wow, that's awesome. You go on the website and they'll tell you all kinds of things. You guys know how to get money? We just know the job so far. If you hit control, shift and C. Oh cheat codes. No we don't want cheat codes in this game. No, it's unlimited cash. I know you can build like this huge sprawling mansion. Yeah, I couldn't build a decent house so I had to cheat cause I wanted to get some good stuff. I've been building it slowly. I couldn't afford a hot tub. I'm looking around the house like it's mine. I'm like, yeah I'm going to in time blow that wall out so I can fit a hot tub in the bathroom. It's going to be a little while. I can't afford it right now. I was telling someone there's not enough hours in the day. They're like, yeah isn't it true? And I was like, holy crap. It's just like real life. It's crack. It's crack. Alright man. Thanks guys. Thank you. Bye. Let's take a couple more of these calls. I'm an idiot. That many hours in front of this friggin' screen. Hey Jay, what's up? Hey. You know, I just got the crack pipe out of my mouth. I just decided I'll give you a ring. I've been having fun torturing them as of late. You know how you can download extra houses off the website? Oh yeah, you can go to the website I think and get houses and other models and a lot of the... I get this big crime boss and his like little frizzy bitch wife. I put them up in a house and she sets the house on fire. So I let him die. I take her and I decide let's torture her. I stick her in a four, like four by four room. No place she can walk. I put a refrigerator in there. Let her eat. She starts pissing all over herself. Then there's garbage piling up. I don't let her sleep. And this is going on about 15 days for her. Eventually she just teels over and dies. Then I bulldoze the house and like, you know, I don't know, have somebody else move in. It's just great to cause the havoc, you know. It's so addicting. I just got in and I've been playing it for like three hours. I didn't even realize it. Right on, man. Well, thank you. Hail Satan. All right, bye. Dean, what's going on? What's going on, guys? All right. You guys got me hooked on Half-Life. And then I heard you guys talking about with the Sims. And I looked all over. Couldn't find it. I finally found it in a place by my house. This game is unbelievable. I can actually manage my own neighborhood the way I want it. Do you make them all Hispanic? Oh, yeah. I'll do everything. Legal prostitution and everything. Anything your heart can do is I can do it legally. They don't need no jewelry. I'll tell them what to do. I want this one. Baseball's been very, very good to me. I hope they put this online now. Play this online. That would be cool. That would be wonderful. I think there is an online option. Yeah? So you can interact with other neighborhoods from people that made their own. Yeah. The Sims is a habit for online. The book that comes with it says it doesn't mention anything about that though. Yeah, I don't know. Well, do a search. We're just getting into it ourselves. Okay. And just discovered this the other day. Yeah. We're passing on, buddy. Thank you, David. Cool. All right. Let's go to Shannon. Shannon, you're next on NAW. What's up? Hey, guys. I think I've lost my husband to this game. To Sims? Yeah. Yeah? He plays until I'm leaving in the morning. He stays up all night and plays it. It sucks. That's the mark of a good video game if you like, you know, give up sleep to play it. Yeah. It's a good game. Exactly. All right. Well, thank you, Shannon. Thanks. Bye. Yeah, it was a lot of fun, man. Yeah, people are hooked on this. A couple more and then we've got to get Jay Moore in here. Chris, what's up? Yo, what's up, man? Hey. How are you guys doing? Great. You got to throw like 10 people in one house. I got like a bunch of frat brothers, right? I got like eight people in one house. You just let it run. Now they're starting to fight. They already kicked two people out of the house. They're killing each other. Like every time I turn, I go up to the guy, slap him in the face. Yeah. And he says, yeah, you compliment him and then you slap him in the face. And then next thing you know, they're rumbling. You got this big cloud of smoke. They're all flying all over the place. Nope, everybody lost their job already. Nobody wants to go get the paper because they're too depressed. Yeah. Hey, once you get them depressed, it sucks. They don't do nothing. I know. That's a good part of the game. Like the chick kept getting depressed. I had to buy her a stupid dollhouse that she sits in front of and plays with. Oh, wee, go, go. It's like laughing and stuff. I had a husband and a wife. They both had jobs. The guy lost his job. And then she's sitting there and she's the breadwinner now. Really? The guy's sitting there. He's all depressed. He doesn't want to go get another job. And now she dies because she's earning all the money and he's so depressed he doesn't want to get another job. So he's sitting there in the living room. He just stares at the air and he's crying all day. He doesn't do anything. This game is messed up. Thanks, Chris. All right, man. Bye. Dave from Jersey on the Instant Feedback Ant. Go into build mode and remove all the doors and windows and watch what happens. Also, crank call the police over and over for no reason. I guess something happens after you do that a few times as well. Yeah, I started a fire just before. Uh-huh. And I ran to the phone to call the fire department and I couldn't because I forgot I had installed a smoke detector in it. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And I was like, oh, I'm going to get a fire. And so I figured, oh, I better call the cops. I called the cops. And the fire department showed up, put the fire out, and then the cops come and yell at you for calling in a fake alarm on the cops. Ron, what's up? Hey, man, what's up? Hey. Hey. I don't know if you guys found us out yet, but you take the family that you start with, there's like three Chinese people, family, Mortimer and Bella and all them, and you take in the two girls, you invite them in, and I broke up that Chinese family, and I got some lesbian action going on there. You guys try that out yet? No. Yeah, a couple of guys have been calling up saying they put the two girls in the house and then just let them go at it. That's awesome. They broke up their family, got some lesbian stuff going on. I had the traditional family over the weekend, you know, the mother and the father and the kid, and the father was going off to work, and then all these other guys were coming to the house, and I was trying to turn the wife into like a horny housewife, giving back rubs and stuff, but none of the guys were going for it. Horny housewives. Thank you, Ron. All right, man, thanks a lot. You guys suck. All right. Brad? Yeah, man, I hate that game. You know why? Why? Because my girlfriend's on it 24-7. Yeah. Oh, yeah? I crack. Honey, come to bed. No, I'm playing The Sims. Honey, how about a Hummer? No, I'm playing The Sims. Never. It's addicting. Never. I hate that game. All right, Brad. It's a bane. Take care, guys. Thank you. We're just about done with this. We'll talk about it again because it's going to be something we're going to watch for the next few months. In the office, we set up a man and a woman so far in the house, built the house up, you know, made the kitchen bigger, put in some better appliances for them, and we'll see. We'll keep you updated on how they do. Yes. With all of us effing with them. Well, that's not a bad idea. Right now, yeah, just like you said, we got the, they're not even a married couple. No, they're two separate beds. Two separate beds, kind of like the I Love Lucy beds happening. Yeah, small, small house. Small house. Pretty small. Starting to expand it a little bit, but they're both working. And that's trying to get them to eff. Yeah. I got to get them to socialize a little more. You got to get them to eff before we go on the air tomorrow. All right. We'll be running a little soap opera with our Sims family. They'll jump into bed. I'll try to get that out. But right now, they're just sharing a house with no kids and no relationship going on yet. No. All right, and we'll update you tomorrow. A couple fires, Anthony said, because the guy didn't know how to cook, but... Guy's been working on that. Sending them off to read the books on it. All right, Rob, what's up? Hey, yo, guys. You guys suck. Thank you, Rob. I'm sorry, but listen to this beautiful description. I'm on my way to the crack dealer. See? You're going to go buy it? I am on my way. They're not even advertising on this damn show. But it's that good, you know? We can't wait for an advertiser. If we like something, we got to talk about it. Thank you, Rob. I can't wait to hook up some lesbians. Well, let us know what you think, all right? Yeah, we'll do. Because this is going to be an ongoing discussion for a while, because it's just so damn fascinating, this damn game. I can't wait. I can't wait. All right, man. I name the families fun, too, you know? You make your own families from scratch. So I'm making the guy, and it's like, pick a last name. Oh, this is the ass wipe family. The ass wipe. It's S-Head Ass Wipe, is the guy. And then there's Limp D and C-Word Ass Wipe. Hey, Mike. Hey. What's up? You're the last call for this break. Well, it's a good one, because I already found an X-rated patch for this. What, where they don't cube out when they're showering? They don't do nothing. I mean, you can make them run around naked, and you can actually see, like, you know, the little pixelated sex act. It's a variety. Hey, where's the... It's a mile long. I'm going to email Dean in about two minutes as soon as I hang up this phone. Okay, dude. You know, so-and-so, so-and-so, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Dude, dude. Xims.com. Mike. Yo. Hold on. Don't hang up, because I will give you an email address. Okay. And if it works, we'll put that on the unofficial website so other people can have fun with that, all right? Cool. Thank you, Mike.

And I told her I had jungle fever. And I said I liked the big black sister ass. Yeah, Jay, he was trying his best to get her to whip him out, but he wouldn't go for it. Yeah, I did. But you missed it down the shore on Sunday night. Sunday, we had it working. Sunday, Rascals Ocean Township, Kristen came up on stage and whipped him out. I got his foot. They were lovely. Jay, I was working the pin pan Sunday night. You were? Hey, my man. I was. Your pin pan was strong. Thank you. It was strong, right? Thank you, my brother. Yes. What's with the holly holly shoes? I can't get on the stage of any comedy club without a little dice coming out. Here's what happened for the listeners that weren't there. People over there, it was a very special night for them because they got to see LNA in person. Hey, we're looking for a quarter of the door, Jay. I think you did a quarter of your show on Sunday. I didn't make it for that weekend. I didn't make it. I think you need to get a guy like me mixed in. I don't know. Just to get your name out there, right? Yeah. To kind of practice up, keep your chops. Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, what would you say? I don't know. I couldn't even know. I had some figures in my head. I don't even know what they would give you. I was driving home and thinking, I wonder what these guys think. All right, how many people were there? Like 300? 250. 250 a night, 10 shows. But I don't get 100 percent. You think I'm going to get 100 percent of that door? All right. Oh, only on Monday? All right, so 2,500 people saw you for 10 shows. I'm thinking you made, honestly, like 25 grand. 33. You're so honest, man. In West Orleans, it was two nights, I made 22. Wow, get out. If you made 33 and Ann and I did about 15 minutes of your act Sunday, someone's got to do the math for us. We did 15 minutes. I'm going to give you $100 each and we don't talk about it. Okay. Don't tell what. That's for you right there. No, you just buy... That's okay, keep it. What a jackass. Buy yourselves some beer. No, just buy the beer tomorrow at the Knick Game, all right? You got it. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah, for those of you that weren't there the night ONA were there, this girl, Kristen, was like, I'm never going to get on the show. Remember me? You know me. You know me. I'm like, how do I know you? I'm like, I'm the girl that... Her name is Kristen, right? Yeah, we talked to her on Friday. She goes, they thought I remembered and they hung up on me, blah, blah, blah. I'll do anything to get on the show. And I'm like, really? And then all of a sudden from the corner of the room I hear, AJ, what does she look like? I had 250 heads turn and see the gorilla sitting to my left right here. I see Anthony and they go, how do you get recognized from the radio? It's the voice. He's like, AJ, what do you look like? And they're just like, it's got to be him. Enough with the drama. And then they go, hey, it's Anthony, everybody. And the place goes bananas. Then Opie comes up, the place goes bananas. Krabette's there, the place goes bananas. So they're going absolutely bananas. The girl comes up on stage, whips out her jugs for like 50... I mean, she took them... I said, hey, don't do that like flip-flop baloney like... Roll those babies out. Let them air them out. Air them out. There's sweat under there. Get the sweat dry. I like, keep them out there for a while. She goes, all right, as long as they get on the show. She's like, they're not going to let me on the show. I go, look, I know these guys. They're my boys. If they say you're going on the show, you're going on the show. She took them out. Those things, I mean, they were out for a long time. And then you guys go off stage and I look at my watch and I realize I have 45 minutes left to do. And you've just showed live boobage. I just showed live nude women. How are you going to beat that? I go, I'll beat Anthony. Wait for that. Kristen's breasts. I have 45 minutes. I'm going to die. They're going to kill me. I'm dying over here. Did you notice the looks to your right when we were doing that whole breast thing for like five or 10 minutes? There were a few couples that were just pissed. They're like, we came here to see good solid comedy. And there's Opie and Anthony trying to get this girl to flash. It's a solid comedy, too. Hell yeah. It's something for everybody on a J.M. Moore show. The funniest was a mind and Anthony's left. The whole side of the room was like, get out of the way. Lock down Norton and walk in that door. We were in the way. Just take it out Norton down in front. They lost their... Yeah, they wanted to see. It was like a table of like 50 people. It was like all one party. They lost their... We thought they were cheering. So I look over to give them like the thumbs up and they're like, move on. Get out of the way. Yeah, we're like the coolest guys in the world that we're going to get a girl naked for them to see. And they're really enjoying it. They're like, this is great. These guys will... And we turn in a split second to the two biggest a-holes. Hey, these guys will... Hey, they're in the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. These guys lost their minds. Kristen's on the line. Kristen. Listen, I'm back. Hey. Hi, Jay. Is this the Kristen? I can warn you, she's a bore on the radio. Oh, please. Listen, can I actually tell you what happened? Yeah, go ahead. Spass puts me on hold, says he's going to get Rick. Next thing I know, I'm on the air. I had no idea that I was going on the air. How about that? How come Spass put a little sad face next to you? Yeah, and it says, Jay is making this up. What's that about? Oh, please. Like, I came... First of all, I said you knew me, and that was it. You said, let's see what she looks like, because you said I was good looking, and they had been calling me a pig. What, Spass says that I'm making this up? No, Kristen doesn't like your interpretation of the story, of the events that unfolded that Sunday night. Your breasts did not see daylight that evening? Did I? I didn't say that was the lie. I said I wasn't saying I'd do anything to get on the show. Well, you came on stage and showed your breasts. Yeah. Because I'm a fun-loving girl. Because that was what you were going to do to get on the show? Who? For Opie. For Jay. Oh, I see. We'll have to discuss that up here. For Jay. You're right, she is dull. Yeah, but Kristen, we've got to let you go. Oh, God, you guys are... Unless you're showing your cans, I'm sorry. We all have one special talent talking to the wonderful three of you. What? Yeah. All right, bye-bye. Such a diss. Goodbye. We all have one talent. She goes, oh, that's not the way it happened. She did say I'd do anything. She said it. Hell yeah, she did. A crowd full of... A club full of people saw that. Because I remember my joke was, anything, really? No, I can't do anything with you. I'm married. And then I looked at her and went, no, but I'll fool around. No. And I kept doing it. I did it like ten times. I go, no, I can't. No, for real. Meet me at the show. For real, you mean? I'm just joking. I did it like ten times. She said I'll do anything. Roger, what's going on? Hey, guys. Hey. I was at the show Sunday night. Jay, you were frigging awesome. Hey, man, thanks a lot. It was very fun. It was terrific. I had the best time. The funny thing is, I took my girlfriend there and we were one of the people to the right. Yeah, because I saw some of those women to Jay's right when we were doing the boob thing. We're not happy. Well, the funny thing is, first of all, I didn't think that girl was anything special. I mean, it was funny and all, but I was looking at her like two deflated sweat socks on stage. No, no. I didn't like them too much. Okay, to each his own. Well, you know what? She was bragging a lot. I thought she was going to be... To each his own. Those were natural and I really thought they were really fantastic. No, but I'll tell you this though. The thing is, exactly what Opie said, that she was bragging a lot during the week prior to that and all of a sudden she's there and it's like, ugh. But the funny thing is that I was watching the show and I was laughing. I turned to my left and my girlfriend is there and she's got this face and I'm like, oh boy. Let me turn back and watch the show. So you had to make a bet that you weren't enjoying watching the show. You're like, this is repulsive. You had your hand over your eyes and peek into the middle. All right, Roger. All right, thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for the compliment, man. I appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Yeah, I've got to say, I was laughing my ass off. And two shows, you know something also, you did two shows that night. That were completely different. Yeah, different. Except for... Jay Moore, baby. Except for the bisexual tunnel story, but that was worth hearing a second time. And walking, I had to do because they chant. I like how you open with that. Well, I had to do it because the second time I lose my voice, so I got to do it first, otherwise there's no impression. I'm like, it's funny, it's not your dog. I thought it was just like walking. It sucks. It's my dog's tail. Next time you come to town, I'm going to suggest everyone just stays for the two shows. Just make a big huge party out of it. Go to the bar and then get the second show. Fifty dollars a ticket. Next time, give me fifty? Well, it's two shows. A hundred percent goes for three more. You don't have to do the show again. Now we're talking. The show you guys were at, my Aunt Sally was at. And my Aunt Sally is a special ed teacher. She's a real nervous Nellie. And not a fan of the Opie and Anthony show we found out. No, it's not. Wait, I've got to say real fast. It's not that you didn't think it was funny. It's that she's real nervous Nellie. No, that's okay. Right. Overbearing. He's always really cool to us before the show. We're upstairs. He's introducing us to his members of his family and we can bet and all that. And we meet Jay's aunt and Jay goes, this is Opie and Anthony. She goes, hi. I don't listen to you guys. Yeah, well that's my family. She made it clear though. I appreciate that. She doesn't shine. She says, but that's how, it's not her style. She wasn't saying, I think you guys are bad. Trust me, we've heard a lot of wars. I just thought it was funny that she had to go a little away. She knows because my uncle Donnie listens to you guys religiously. He was really cool. He had to turn it off when I was whipping Marco. He said he was working on a roof for construction. He said it was so gay that seven construction workers on a roof at once looked at each other and went, you know what, turn this off. I'm going to jump off the roof. But when my aunt was at the show, I told you she's like real prim proper and she's the best. But then I thought you guys would come to the second show. So I go, you know what, I'm going to go straight clean total like the litter box, the kitty, the dog, all that stuff up front. The litter box. And then second show, I'm going to be, you know, it's all going to be about, you know, rims and being careful. Fur hoops. Fur hoops, and whale eyes, and maps of Hawaii, you know. But you guys all showed up at the same show. So I go up on stage and I'm like trying to keep it clean for my aunt. And then I saw you guys in the corner. I said, you know what, my aunt's going to have to suck it up. I'm going to be a lot more than I get impressed. My aunt will always be my aunt. But I like this open door policy. I just started going, how many guys here like to eat blank? I remember my wife put her finger in my blank when she was blanking me. It was still, did you see the look your aunt was giving you? I didn't know what she was saying. But then afterwards she goes, that was the best. Oh, cool. She loved it. Well, if I knew you didn't care, I would have just let it all hang out. You know, it was great. Actually looking at Wayne Krabette's face when you use Wayne in your act. I was dying. Because I did it once in another club that wouldn't give me a door deal here in town. And I did that joke, I do a joke about my wife, how do I say this, putting her finger Well, I think people can figure out. Someplace while she's forming all the sex on me. And that's when I knew I wanted to marry her. And I go, you can't break up with a woman that puts her finger there because she'll tell all her friends and she won't say it was one finger, she'll say it was both hands and she's clapping. And you were bending over and you were enjoying it. You were going, and I just usually just pick a name like, oh, Lionel, Lionel. But one show Wayne was there and so I go, Wayne, oh, Wayne. You just got to see him shake his head and look. A week later I'm talking to him on the phone and he goes, dude, why you gotta use my name in the joke? So then when I knew he was there, I bent down and I was like, oh, Wayne. Wayne's just disgusted. What did he do? He was shaking his head, man. Yeah, he looks up at you, he's like shaking his head. Completely defeated? Yeah. That's bad. Looking at you like you ass. How hot is Amy? Oh, God, she's girlfriend Amy. I'm not saying anything. Glenn Foley was there. Glenn Foley was there last night. She had chats with his wife. Cool. Oh, God, she's beautiful too. Well, let's take a break here. How many chats have hot wives? You should see Vinnie Testaverde's wife, Mitzi. Oh, how cute, Lord. You believe that, Henry? A juke, Lord. In this day and age, you're practicing at the time. A juke, Lord, Henry. In this day and age, you're practicing. I'm playing a banging sport, Henry. You want to help me out? That was from the in-laws. All right, we've got to take a break. I've got a ton of people who want to talk to you about your shows down there. We should call Hackett. Can we call Hackett? We've got to tell the... I told him. We've got to tell the Bunny Hackett story next. Good stuff, right? Can I just say for once, real fast, before we break? Yeah. It's so good to see you guys again. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I know, I love you guys. We were doing worse stuff yesterday, and you heard Tourette's Warhouse? I was on the toilet in my hotel room, and it actually made... It helped me. I was laughing so hard, and I could not believe... Let's just listen to it and try to get a little bit of a sense of it. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. Could you hold on a minute? I'm sorry. I have Tourette's Syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate. Oh, no problem. Do you need prices, hon? Yes. Okay, well, house minimum starts at $100, and that's for a basic one activity party. $100? Well, that's pretty cheap. That's where the prices start, and then from there the sky's the limit, because all the ladies are independent contractors. You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a... That's no problem, hon. Handicap's no problem. Oh, good. So I could come down and get a girl and climb aboard and start going... Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady. So for $100, could I put my head between her... Could I do that? Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone. You have to discuss that with the lady, okay? Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I can get a little wild, you know, when I get... Is that okay? That's no problem, hon. Do you take the fees? A mess card? Yes, we do. Could I bring a muzzle? So I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't. That's fine. Do you think a girl would mind when I start... She spanks me. You have to come in and discuss with the lady. Are they pretty women? Very pretty. This might sound... Take your time, okay? This might sound like a strange request, but... Do you have any girls that aren't that attractive, babe? All of our ladies are very nice. I have jungle fever. Do you have any black girls? We have black ladies, we have Asian ladies, we have Oriental ladies. Just depend. I have to go now because I'm very busy. Do you have a dwarf? No, we don't. Not at this time. Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me... Goodbye, okay? I'm all for violence sometimes. Hey, you guys are a bunch of fools. God, I want to punch you in the face. That'll leave a bruise. Anthony Fidelity Diamond! Yes, the engagement ring specialist. Yeah, guys, did you miss the deadline for getting engaged on Valentine's Day? Uh-oh. Congratulations. They're talking to people that are truly in love here. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if you really want to shock her, give her the ring this week. Oh. If you want more action and you want hummers, go to Fidelity Diamond and get the ring. What? Supposedly, because last time we said, you know, guys, if you get the engagement ring, you're going to get a Hummer? Yeah. Ten guys called Fidelity Diamond to get their rings. Diamond does equal Hummer. I would think so. You know, get the ring, get engaged, that's cool, and go to Fidelity Diamond because they're not going to rip you off. You know, they explain the whole process, they explain why a diamond is good and all that. You can pick out the diamond, you know, and they'll take care of everything right in front of your eyes. It's not set. So you can see the underside of the diamond, they teach you about it. They educate you. There's no trickery at Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. J. Moore is doing like three stooges at Prashen's in the hallway, he's distracting me. But I was going to say, though, you get the engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond, but make sure your engagement lasts a really long time because the hummers definitely dry up after you get married, I believe. That's what all my married friends have told me over the years. Okay, here's the deal too, Anthony. Buy your diamond engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond and get a platinum engagement ring setting for free. That's a $500 value. Jay, does the hummers dry up after you get married? No, my wife is, you know, Chris Frogs, there's three kinds of women. There's one woman that don't do it, we don't need you, and there's one woman that do it just enough to shut you up. And the third kind of woman is the best. The woman who's never happier, you know, when she's got that in her mouth. So, which one is your wife? My wife loves to do it. Very good. She enjoys doing it. With you or? Who cares? All right, call Tom Colosino, the president of Fidelity Diamond. We're recovering from the Tom KKKKKKKKK. For a confidential appointment for Fidelity Diamond 201-261-6555. That's 201-261-6555 for Fidelity Diamond. Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. Oprah and Anthony. Can we get these illiterates off the air, please? We suck. If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 1027 WNEW. WNEW, yeah. Jay Moore in the studio. Hey, Jay, when are you going home, by the way? I'll be in LA like the 25th of the month of February, Black History Month, I like to call it. Yes, my African brother. When do you leave for good, though, as far as New York? The 25th. Are you going to be in town until the 25th? I'm going to Boston, up at Faneuil Hall, to comedy connect. Comedy connection, yes. I might be in Boston this weekend. You should pop in. I might be like a deadhead, just follow Jay around for a while. I'll be at the Boston. I'll be at the Boston either. I sound like the stutterer. I'll be at the Boston. That's so freaking ridiculous. Defied every law of comedy. When you broke into the Three Stooges and she didn't hang up on you, like, in the back you're going, what? What? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Clang, clang, clang. In the back you're going, clang, clang, clang. In the back you're going, what? What? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. That's why I got to break into her early, that I had a problem. You have a bye-bye back. You have a muscle. I hate to clamp down on one of the girls. I'll be at the Boston audience if you come up. Give me a... All right. We got to get Bruins tickets or Celtics tickets. Either or. Anyone have connections in Boston? Really? Nigga, please. We don't want to be in, like, the nosebleeds, though. What kind of tickets? Anthony the limo driver. Let me call Nomar. What kind of tickets can you get us? I'll try my best. Not the upper deck like the Mets, I promise. We'll try to get you in the lower deck. This guy, this guy, he gives me tickets for a Met game? Dude, I don't think anyone has ever sat that high at J Stadium. You with the Connets and the Kits. He was with the lights. Pretty much. Give the puck to Mario. The sniper was right above him. The sniper is below him. The planes are flying. There's some hairs on a 727 from Opi's head. I was going to say that we were so high up that, you know, when the planes flew over, I was ducking because I thought I was going to get hit. Thanks. Thanks for the picks, Anthony. I was at the Garden once and I was so high I was actually looking down at the scoreboard. Oh, no. At a basketball game. That's pretty bad. I remember, like, the Knicks back in, like, 93, the Knicks Bulls, like, the classic showdowns where you get the ball and everybody goes, Scorsy! I had to go and I scalped them. It was like 200 bucks each. And I go in and the guy goes, these are counterfeit next? I was like, I'm going to bury him. I was like, he just looked at it for like one second. That happened to me too. And he just ripped them up. What if they weren't counterfeit? What if the guy made a mistake? He just destroys them, right? He goes, counterfeit next. And I'm like just standing there and there's a sea of humanity. Then they send you down. And you're nobody. There's a playoff fever behind me. Like, I'm getting steam. I'm like, but I'm going to go back in the street and scalp them again. But, you know, Jersey guy, the first thing I'm doing is trying to find the original guy to beat the sniper. Oh, God. You know, he's still hanging out. He's a show road in a buddy book. Making the Aleutian Islands on the floor. I can't change it up. You guys think you're on my trail in Aleutia. You think you're right there. You think you got me and I slip away. Patty, what's up? Hi, how are you? Hi. How are you? Hi, I just wanted to know. This is where, let me explain it to Jay more, okay? Jay, this is Patty the stalker. Not a real stalker. Who does she stalk? Me. Well, she's a very handsome man, Patty. She loves hoping. I love everybody. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think that's what they said on Bill. Oh, no, you know, Buddy Hackett said that line in the Abbott and Costello story. He said, I love you, Lou. He goes, I love you too. I love everybody. Wow. People can't laugh when you're breathing in. When we call Buddy Hackett a little while, could you talk to him as Buddy Hackett? Yeah. Okay. Now, and explain to Jay more, Patty, how she just happens to be always around. Yeah, this is hysterical. She loves Opie, sends him cards for every occasion, writes little notes of congratulations when the ratings are good and everything. Like, all of a sudden, sounds like a pretty good fan. It's so bad, all of a sudden, it's like. A whore with a fizz? That's a joke. Oh, is it? I just hit button. I just hit button. You're playing with Anthony's little machine over there. Excuse me? But Patty kind of forgets that it's like. Shut up. Patty forgets it's the Opie and Anthony show. So I get congratulatory like. No, she's totally stalking Opie. So then she just happens to always be within a block of this building. Doesn't matter. Where are you now, Patty? Yeah, where are you right now? I'm a block away. I just visited Reynolds. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. I just visited Reynolds. She's a block away. She's a block away. I just visited Reynolds. She's a block away. She's a block away. She's a block away. Then that's her other excuse. She visits one of the guys that does the news at 1010 wins. In case you thought we were kidding. So now she is upstairs. Excuse me? Have you ever seen her? Yeah, we. Oh yeah. They bring her in just to make me really uncomfortable. Excuse me? Patty like supposedly has a friend upstairs that works for wins and that's her excuse for getting in the building every night. I go up to her and I say, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse for getting in the building. I go up to see Reynolds. Help me. It's Patty. I want to come down and meet Jay Moore. I was getting a haircut and so how and on my way back I realized I was only 14 blocks from the train. Which gets off at Penn Station, which is only a 17 block. We can sing together. We can't talk together. Yeah. And then it's right next to me by the way. Oh, yes. Yeah. He's got a little bit of a beard. He's got a little bit of a beard. He's got a little bit of a beard. He's got a little bit of a beard. He's got a little bit of a beard. He's got a little bit of a beard. He's got a little bit of a beard. Which is only a 17 block. We can sing together. We can't talk together. Yeah. And then it's right next to me by the way. Oh, yes. Yeah. He just came in. He's back in. He's here. Who? Who? I don't want to sleep with him. Listen to Reynolds. All right. Yeah. Put Reynolds on the phone. Yeah. Reynolds can't understand why she won't leave him alone. Hey, what's up, man? Oh, not much. How you doing? All right. So Patty came out to see you. Reynolds, get the bitch out of there. So Reynolds. Enough's enough. How many times has she seen you in the last week? Well, I've been real busy. Yeah. So, but Tuesday, what's it say? Tuesday? Yes. So only yesterday. So I constantly hear Reynolds' name on 1010 wins, by the way. I think that's why she's stalking you. I think so. Because you have name recognition. What's your last name, Reynolds? Joseph. Reynolds Joseph? Reynolds Joseph. They say it on wins all the time. Reynolds Joseph. Oh, yes. Leave the last name out for saving. Yeah. It's just Reynolds. Yeah. There's only one. Like Reynolds rap. Oh, no. That's what they ask. Hey, so you love when Patty comes and visits you, right? Yeah. It's a diversion. It's a kinky diversion. Now, Jay doesn't know what Patty is like or looks like, so I guess we're going to send her down. Put it this way, Jay. She would win a Joey Ramon lookalike. Swear to God. Swear to God. Baby Joe's cat. She's a good one. Listen, we're not getting into that today. But why not, Diamond Duster? Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Give me my money for appearing on your stage. Why don't you turn it down? Okay, I'm going to send it down. All right, hold on, Reynolds. So what's the deal with Patty, Reynolds? No, I asked. Reynolds, no, I asked. So now that she's awake, if I can be... Wait, this is the best one. Reynolds could talk when she leaves. Now, Reynolds, tell us the truth about Patty. Yeah. Is she stalking you? No. Unfortunately, we went to high school together. Oh, you did? Yeah. Look at that. You end up... 10-10 wins. And she ends up French fry girl with McDonald's. McDonald's. Is she an info? No. She's not even like a good stalker. No, that's probably... No, this is the kind of stalker that, like, if you say the wrong thing, she'll probably be there with a high-powered rifle to take out when you leave the building. She's coming down. She reads... She's going to be so impressed you're a stalker. She reads books in our courtyard outside the building. When I arrive to work, I'm like, oh, hi, Patty, how are you? Yeah, you walk in, there's a door that you sit in. That's creepy. Oh, it's a witchy scene. All right, well, she's right outside the studio, Reynolds. All right, Reynolds, go write some news. I will. All right, thank you, Reynolds. Good luck to you guys. Reynolds-Joneson. 10-10 wins. I love when people add an S to a name for no reason, like Reynolds. I'm trying to be like, did you see... All right, here it is. Was it Spike Owens last night? James versus stalker. Uh-oh. All right. Up to the microphone. It's Mark Davis. Hello, Patty. It's Mary David Chapman. I'm not a stalker. Why is she holding Catcher in the Rye? The favorite book of all stalkers. Since high school. I've read that book since I shot John Lennon. Excuse me. I don't have to read it. I read it 500 times. You got balls. I know it by heart. You got balls making fun of her in person. Hey, come on. Opie's trembling. Look at his hand. He's actually shaking. Yeah. Patty, I think Opie needs a hug. No, no, no, we're not doing the hug. Why not? You had Marco kiss you. He just decided we're not doing the hug. We're not doing the hug thing today. I took more fag stuff over the weekend. Listen, dude, what was his name? At my live shows, people were going, fag Marco. And then one of my friends, Billy Mac, the cop, he downloads all the pictures from the unofficial website. It's a picture of Marco kissing you. Yeah. And everyone's going, you're a fag. You whip a gay guy. Marco nailed him, man. Right when the flash went off, he leaned over and kissed Opie on the cheek. And Marco's face is blacked out because he knew what he was doing. Yeah, put my face on to be recognized. Thank you. Can they black out my face? I don't want to be recognized. You can black out your fence, too. Fence, Sarge. All right, you know what? I'll black out the fence. I'll black out the fence. Chalk up the fence. Chalk it up, Norton. Hey, Patty, Patty, have you ever met a Hollywood star before? No. Oh, I believe you need to give Jay a little hug. Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on, take her headphones off. Go hug Jay. Patty, what movies have you seen that Jay's been in? It came out like a year ago. Which one? Go? I don't remember the name, but I mean I've seen him in a couple things. He gets little bit parts and stuff. Don't get excited. Oh my God. But I can't remember. It isn't something about a fairy. It's something else. Where he kisses the Scott Wolf? When he kisses the guy? Go. The yellow meada? Go. All right, you want to give Jay a hug? When's the next time you're going to get to hug him? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Go ahead, take your headphones off. Let's go. Oh, no. Rick, take your headphones off. I'll do it just for the website. Okay. All right, Patty the stalker. I'm the chief player I am. I'll do it just for the website. Grab her ass. All right, Patty. Oh my God. Okay, Patty is getting to meet Jay. Oh, look at that. Oh, exciting and new. Oh, I love it. Oh, exciting and new. How did that feel, Patty? Your hair smells delicious. Oh, thank you. I just washed it. Good. Gee, your hair smells terrific. You just washed it? Yes. It's not Wednesday. It's good. I'm all wet. Hey, Patty. Thank you, Jay. I'm all wet now. I'm leaving a trail like a slug. Hey, Patty, Mohawk or Triangle? Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah. Looks like Don King's head in a leg lock. He's funny. He's funny, right? Good. When do you have to give Shawn Lennon his glasses back? What? When do you have to give Shawn Lennon his glasses back? Excuse me? I don't know. By the way, who won the eye procedure? Because I didn't answer the contest. No, huh? You didn't win some other guy. In a good place, they gave you the sweater. So, Patty, what does it look like? Like surplus of chess king. What does it look like when you pull your drawers down? Is it Fidel Castro eating a London broil? It's a black cat with a throat slit. Nothing like the thing you've seen before. Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby. She had a patch of gray. Is that it? Is it gray? Maybe it looks like Phil Donahue's head in a leg lock. I saw Marlo Thomas today. Did you? Where? I met Martin Bregman, the producer of every Al Pacino movie ever, at a general meeting. I'm walking out, she's sitting on the couch. I was like, man, what am I meeting these people for? I should just get the part. And then I'm like, Marlo Thomas is sitting there. Wow. Is she auditioning for something? I guarantee it. Are you going to give us a part, Jay? Yeah, right. We want you guys to play wacky DJs. Yeah, we'll just be in the background. Just be ourselves. Better yet, it'll be out of a car radio. Yeah. You'll be driving somewhere. You'll be like the Mad Dog in Bad Lieutenant. Yeah. They lose four games in about seven games. They'll go back to the finals, they'll boost the base, they'll boost hell yeah. Pretty good, Mad Dog. I have the approval right? Let's take a break. Those guys have a commercial, every commercial. We'll be back on the fan, Mike and the Mad Dog will be back after this. Long time listener, first time caller. Is it everybody? Oh my God. Every game that the Reds win, the Mets will get tight, we'll be back after this. Strawberry will break out, Guerrero is going to break out. Remember when the Dodgers had all those guys who couldn't pronounce X? Strawberry will break out, Guerrero will break out. Jay's got that lisp. You're on radio with a speech impediment. That's great. That is why it's from Tar Router. Don't forget after us, stay tuned for Nick's update with Droopy Dog. You know what? Patrick Ewing sucks. He looks like Dionne Warwick. She shouldn't have done that. Patricia Ewing. I like that Patrick thumps his wife for a Nick City dancer. There's a guy. There's a choice. Let's see, this is the woman that knew me when I was illiterate. No one. Illiterate. There's a woman that knew me when I was selling fruit in Cambridge. The woman that taught me what speed stick is, that you don't actually eat it. I thought it was like a push-up from the good humor. I have my children, I make $18 million a year, let me stick it to a four-foot ugly girl up close. I don't know if you see those dancers, they're really hot from far away, I go to the Laker games and I'm in the tunnel and I see them walking by and I'm like, what happened? There's little kids smoking freckly four-foot midgets. Well, Patty, are we done with Patty? Patty, what is your goal as far as the whole OP obsession? I'm not obsessed, I want the smoke. I'm not obsessed, you turned it off on me. I've been turning it off. Every time I reach for it, OP turns it off. Very shagadelic. Very shagadelic. Commenting on Patty's glasses, very good. Shall we shag now or shall we shag later? Yeah, baby. Patty, would you like Jay to put a bullseye on your ass? Oh, man. I only do that to men. Well, that doesn't be hairier. Well, Patty, good segment, thanks for coming by. How is Reynolds? Reynolds, fine. Oh, my God, can we like, you know? Yes. Come on, Patty, let's go. Chalk, chalk. Have a good day, Patty. Bye, Patty. Where are you going? You're going bowling. You run a league? What are you, a pin? Patty, what are you looking at? You're crotch-o-fake. No, she looks right through you. What are you looking at? She's an hourglass figure, but there's only 20 seconds left. Patty, even you laughed at that one. That's a good line, right? I came over and hugged you. I like you, Patty. I think they'd rather have that crazy opera guy in here than an opera man. We're trying to get him on the show. It's either Jay Moore or the opera guy. Bye, Patty. Bye, Patty. Say hi to Ronald. You're a nice little figure. You like a dumper? I had to say something positive, but she left so she wouldn't stab me. Help the Skelter. No, no, no, no. Hey, there's someone that went to your show that's a little pissed off. Dana? Hi, guys. Yes, I did. Well, first of all, I think he's awesome. I left my five-month-old with a hundred and three fever to go see him. Didn't you say negligent parenting? Yes, I was. Social services took your kid and then what? It's the Sims. I was controlling your life the other night. Jay, you are awesome, except up until the point where you got to the mermaid and the algebra joke and you picked on Whippany. What? No, first of all, that wasn't my joke. Well, but you picked on Whippany. I might have mentioned Whippany. I don't know Whippany from Adam to actually stand there and make fun of you. Are you from Whippany? Yes, I am. What did I say specifically? Well, you were talking about the algebra and then you were, god, you know, now I can't remember. But you were just making fun of us. No, that's false. I don't make fun of people. I told you in my act. I hate when comics make fun of the audience. I hate when you're in the front row. I was in the audience that wasn't talking back to you. So what was the problem there? Oh, no, don't count me out. What? All right, Jay, you're also going to hang up before they get me out. What? Ah, she went. We'll be back with more of the 72nd Annual Oscar Award. She was on to it though. I know exactly what you're talking about. The algebra joke is hilarious. I was doing that joke and I go, you know who needs algebra? I was doing algebra teachers and some lady screamed and I looked down and she was an algebra teacher. And she goes, you know what algebra is? It's what a mermaid wears. But I didn't get it. I'm in like crazy comic mode. I'm like, what? She goes, algebra, bra. And I go, comedy's not easy, is it, lady? You tell that to the kids, huh? What are you teaching algebra in second grade? And then so that's what she's talking about, the mermaid. She goes, then you did your mermaid bit. The school teacher did it. Alright, people get so freaking confused. Is this the famous Ingrid? Yeah. Hold on Ingrid. Ingrid, you were so popular. Every show I did, someone would go, Ingrid! Guys, take it out, wax it up. Yeah, we've got to take a quick break. Get Mr. Grugg sex wax and start chalking up your board. Chalk your board up. Chalk it up! Alright Ingrid, hold on, okay? We're going to talk to Ingrid next. She's a 19-year-old bisexual. We've got to call Hackett. And we've got to call Buddy Hackett. Lots to do on the show today. J. Moore in the studio. In the house. God, when is he going to go home? Oh man, don't get in my head, I'll be embarrassed now. I don't want him to come back. We'll be back, stay there. Opie and Anthony. Who would you rather nail? I disqualified myself because I got them both. 1027 WNEW. Opie. Sometimes like piss me off, okay? Opie. 1027 WNEW. Alright, we're back. J. Moore in the studio again today. We're wheeling and dealing while we're trying to pay some bills there, Anthony. That's alright, pretty funny. Letting us in. Nah, I'm not going to say anything. The private world of J. Moore. Kind of fun. Nothing for bet-esque. Nothing for bet-esque. Now. Alright, you want to talk to Ingrid? You guys got Courtney? I met Courtney. You want to say hi to Courtney? You gave her tickets last week on our show. That's the girl you guys thought was a hog. Hey, come on. Why? Hey Courtney. Is this Courtney that I met? Yeah, this is her. You guys dumped her last week when I called you guys and she was on the phone because she thought she was lying about her rights. Because what? You tell her, Courtney. What, last week? Yeah, they dumped you because they thought what? No, they never dumped me. Well, you were on the air with us and then Jay called. We blew you off so we could get an update from Jay or something. Oh yeah, no, it was, you had me moaning for him and then he was getting off the phone. And I got the tickets and then you just put me on hold so I could talk to someone. So I didn't really talk to you guys for a while. You told me when you came backstage that they dumped you because they thought you were lying about your looks. What? No, no, I didn't. Look, I don't drink, I don't do drugs, all I do is, I tell jokes. I'm not high, I remember what you told me. Right. I know I didn't do a mermaid joke. Anyway, Courtney's pretty hot and she's got a very, you know how they're called Barclay, the round mound of rebounds? She's got very round mounds and I would like to rebound. Nice Jay. Those things are gigantic. How do you harness those things? She's a double D. No, 36C, like a full C. A full C. You were resting your chin on them. You were pushing them up. The miracle bra is for A-cups, honey. You know what we should play today? Bra bingo. Oh, what's bra bingo? We make these little bingo cards with bra sizes and we play a game of bra bingo. We have the girls calling with the bra sizes. It's a good little game, Jay. Only we're buying for money. Yeah, we can play for money. Did you enjoy your show, Courtney? Yeah, it was great. It was actually the second time I saw him. I saw him at Florida State like a year and a half ago. 8,000 students standing ovation got it on video. Nice. No, it's hard for a white guy to get standing ovation, especially in Florida. You know, he said the same thing last night. Tell them, Barry. I don't know if the black audiences stand right up. Yeah, they stand right up. It's unbelievable. This is Barry Katz. My manager has been fired by some of the biggest names. Really? Yeah. They all cut him loose. Is this my resume? Well, Courtney, anything else? That's about it. I wanted to call in and I actually wanted to thank you guys for the tickets. You're welcome. You gotta hear his voice because Anthony will be doing an impression of it. No, like I've been in comedy 20 years. There's only been like five standing ovations I've ever seen by a white guy in front of a white audience. It rarely happens. You have black guys that get standing ovations. He does sound very Jewish. Hi, Papa. Hi, boss. Barry. Let's talk to Ingrid. See what's going on in her world since we last talked. Ingrid! Yeah. How are you? Hi. 19-year-old bisexual female. Hi. Ingrid, every show I did, somebody screamed your name out in the audience. I'm not making that up. Really? I'm a medical this weekend, so I didn't get to go. That boy sounds sexy. You haven't had sex with that loser, right? Since Jay told me not to have sex with him. No, actually, you know what happened? Yesterday, he went to go see his girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Me and Kristen were here doing our thing. Hold on, you can't just say doing our thing. What were you guys doing? The doing our thing part of your phone call has got to last 20 minutes. Well, you know, we got each other presents and stuff. We went out shopping and we bought each other lingerie and stuff. Wow. Her and her lesbian roommate. You bought her lingerie, she brought you a black guy. So, you know, we did like the little, we didn't give each other the presents, so we did a little modeling thing for each other. We just ended up having full out lesbian sex again. Really? Bumpin' donuts. Did you get to the whale eye? Yeah. Oh, God, take it out. Who's with you now? Nobody, actually. Order takeout and whoever shows up is something. Are you on a food? That's a great idea. Order a pizza and then just like go to the door naked and see what he does. That'd be interesting. Yeah, it'd be real interesting when he like kills us. Right. And it's Opie, Anthony and Jay Morris fall. I know what you're talking about. But we had a relationship. There's more inside jokes. I know. That was great stuff while we were doing commercials. All right, Ingrid, go ahead. All right. So I guess Paul went to go see his girlfriend and it turns out that she had heard him on the radio the other day and she broke up with him on Valentine's Day. He deserves it. So he came home and he walked in on it again and he tried to get in on it and I wouldn't let him. Yeah, bravo. All right, you're a smart girl, see? I forbade you for doing so, right? I know, that's why I did it. The guy, we should update the big Jew. There's girls having lesbian sex with a roommate. There's two girls and a guy. She shaved into a Jewish star? No. Can you shave into a Jewish star, Ingrid? Huh? Never mind. There were handcuffs involved and the boy roommate walks in and he did not have sex, like caught them on the couch. One was handcuffed, both naked. Ingrid also, the bisexual, said she wouldn't have minded having sex with him and he didn't do anything. He went in the other room and just started beating his mate. He didn't join in. And then he started talking like, well, I'll do it the next time. He goes, oh, the next time. It's like, oh, oh yeah, I'll catch Halley's Comet the next time. He didn't understand it doesn't happen twice so we made sure it didn't happen twice. Ingrid has been forbidden. A moratorium on heterosexual sex for Ingrid. How do you feel about that, Ingrid? Yeah. And Ingrid, you're alright with that, right? Yeah, I'm alright. Well, you know, I wouldn't mind having a guy. No, no, we've got plenty of guys here. Yeah, there's plenty of guys that will throw you the banging of your life, Ingrid. The limo driver wants to give you his tuna can. Are you naked right now? No, I'm in boxer shorts and a little baby t-shirt. Oh, boxers? Can you masturbate for us? Yeah, I can. Are you wearing any panties under them? No. Can you rub the phone up and down your... Mohawk? Thank you. Let's do it. Let's hear some kind of stumble. You're being serious. Yeah, of course we are. Everything we do on the show is serious. I think you guys really turn Ingrid on. Yeah, we do. Alright, get the phone down there. And go back and forth. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Kind of like that Gillette commercial. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Wait a little more. Yeah, because Ann was talking. I was just getting into it. Ann, I'm not done yet. Yeah, get the phone in your pants again. Okay. Okay, here we go. Okay. You can tell where the rough ends. That's great. It kind of like goes from rough to green. Rough, fairway, green. How big is your phone? How big is my phone? Normal size. You're not going there, are you? I might. Which part of the phone did you use, by the way? Which part of the phone? Which part of the phone? Yeah, the part you talk into? Yeah. How many guys want to make a call off of that phone? I just know you so. When your girlfriend comes home, do you say you've been on the phone all day? Dude! What are you doing? Just warming up your dinner. Wow, that's pretty good. On a scale of 1 to 10, how horny are you right now because you're talking OP and Anthony? 10. Minor 10, yeah. Could you slide those boxers off? I just said I cut to the chase. You're stuttering. Yeah, I could do that. I think you already are a little bit. So you could tell what the ass is like if she takes the boxes off, puts the phone near her ass and smacks her ass. You could tell by the sound whether it's tight ass. You're welcome. You'll hear the echo if it's a flabber. Let's do that big ass. We've had this argument before. Let's take the boxes off. At 19, Jay, there's plenty of years left for it to get big. At 19, it's got to be like a snare drum. Like Jerry Lewis's hair. Like the smallest tom-tom on Neil Peart's drum kit. The one that goes... Where he goes... Like the little one. Don't fool around with Neil Peart. Don't mess with Neil Peart. Neil Peart is terrible about the cancer and him dying, right? You heard about that? Like 15 years ago, Neil Peart's dying of cancer, man. No, that was Neil Young with the throat cancer. They all had it. They all miraculously have it cured. Where are we right now? Are we naked? I am half naked. Can you do some kind of rhythm thing? With the bush and then with the butt. Get some kind of rhythm going. Like we will rock you. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, let's try that. Okay. So the muff would be the... And the butt would be the... Okay. How many times? Up to the chorus. Oh, I won't be able to hear you. Don't worry, as long as we can hear you. Okay. That is one tight ass. Yeah, wait a minute. You got a tight ass. Put that phone closer to the ass and just smack the ass. Okay. We got to hear that. Smack it like five times in a row. Okay. Oh, listen to that. That's way up there. What do you weigh, 80 pounds? That's not... That's like she's just slapping a pelvis bone. Her tailbone is sticking out. She's taking a sleeve stack. No, I'm a very curvy girl. All right, let's replace the phone with your hand now. A little spank on the butt with your hand. Just to get the full effect here. Okay. That's what I was doing. Oh, I thought she was hitting herself with the phone. No. Oh, wow, okay. That's good. Yeah. You've been touching yourself, haven't you? A little, yeah. Yeah, I know. You've been touching the little man in the boat. Playing a little pre-knuckle shuffle. Rubbing the lamp to see if the genie pops out. Little DJ Pete Caprice. Chugga-chugga-chugga. Do it for real. Come on, do it. Don't forget the turkey pop-up timer thing. What turned you on? What turned you on about these two? What is it about this show that gets you so hot that you cry? I like their voices. We've got the Barry White going, don't we? He's got great voices. As soon as she said that, we all brought it down to the bottom. I like Anthony's voice. Yeah, you're a dirty girl, aren't you? A little. Aren't you? A little bit. More so, though, you'd like to be a lot dirtier than you can be. Where do you live? You live in Long Island, right? Yeah, I do. If you need... I'm a millionaire, Ingrid. He's a Jew, bro, from Long Island. In this day and age, pretty much. Henry, you want to help me out? Rub it, Ingrid. Do the right thing, Ingrid. Put the phone down there and do whatever you want to do. Let's just listen in. Quiet. This is the one that made me hit the retard button. Actually, you want the phone by your mouth, don't you? Shut up, big Jew. Oh, my God. I was going to town. It was getting wetter and wetter. Bell Atlantic. Yeah, I like that. All right, Ingrid, you're well endowed, right? Yeah. Could you give us a motorboat? She's a big penis? Yeah, you got about seven and a half. Do you know what a motorboat is? No. You've got to put your lips between your breasts and kind of... Oh, let's not make her a five-year-old now. That's fun. How do you go from rubbing the mohawk to goofy party tricks? Ingrid, pull my face. Ingrid, pull my finger. That was pretty hot. Ingrid, do you like comedy? Yeah, I do. I'm going to do a private show for you. Oh, God. She is going to want 100% of the door. Yeah, someone 100% of that door. Seven o'clock show with Ingrid. I think I went out to Long Island. Ingrid, come on into the city. Yeah? Ingrid, why are you not here tomorrow? I don't have a ride. We have a limousine courtesy of... Anthony, get on. She's in. Top Notch will pick her up tomorrow. She's in and Jay, you're in too. I can't be in. In that sense of the word. Hold on, there's a girl that's freaking out. Sue. Hello. Hold on, hold on. We had to dump out of that, Sue. Sue, you were pleasuring yourself listening to Ingrid? Absolutely. And you finished the job in three minutes? I finished the job. Three minutes as you're driving? Women are the best. As I'm driving on 280. They can just crank one out whenever they want. They lean up against the washing machine the right way and then crank it out. Well, Ingrid, you're turning on everyone, guys and girls out there. I know. Ingrid, if you come in here and you're ugly, I'm going to punch you in the face. I'm going to punch you right in the face. That's why I don't know if we want her in here, man. That's going to wreck the fantasy. Ingrid, are you hot? Be very honest. Yeah, I've been told so, yeah, by lots of people. Yeah, but if it's right before they go in, you might just be saying that. What do they say after they orgasm? What? No, I can't describe myself, but I have big brown eyes. I've got full lips. I'm sweet. I'm doing. You're Swedish. Yeah. Nice. Sue? I want to know how many people are crashing their cars right now. Yeah, you think Ingrid's got it going on again today, huh? Absolutely. What's the name of the limo company? Top Notch Limo. I might have to pick up Sue, too, and you guys can bump donuts in your way here. Oh, listen to that, Sue. Now we've got Liana on the line as well. Liana, what's the problem? My thing is, I don't like talking dirty to her, so I can get off while I'm driving home. Whoa. I think he loves Anthony. But Anthony says this great, dirty-girl voice. Please, Anthony, please! Girls love it. Why? Because you're a dirty girl, aren't you? Good, I love that! You like being bent over, don't you? Yeah. You have somebody bending you right over the dresser in the bedroom, just slamming your ass, right? You like that. You're dirty. You want me to pull the hair out of your head, don't you? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Then I'll flip you over, just grab your ponytail as I smack your ass. Beat that ass, because you are such a dirty girl, aren't you? Yeah. But don't worry, there's some rewards to being a dirty girl. Yeah. Going south on you. There we go. You're filthy, you dirty, dirty girl. And then I'll punch you in the uterus. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to smack you. Oh, man, why'd you do that? So close. That ruined it. That was just payback for when I was in junior high. I'm finally getting some back. You did just like me. You did just like me. Well, Leanna, did you enjoy that? Yes, I did. Thank you very much. All right, don't crash your car on the way home, all right? I got to. Don't hit a retard bus like I did when I first listened to Ingrid. Sue, any last thoughts there? Tell Ingrid I've got to meet her. Say that? I've got to meet Ingrid. All right, hold on the line, OK? Yep. We're going to try to set up. The limo can fit 10 people. Yeah. We're going to set up Sue and Ingrid. Do you want to get set up with a girl? Yeah, sure. Will your girlfriend get mad? She's not my girlfriend. She's just like my... She's just my girl. I go down on her. Yeah, she's just my roommate that I bump donuts with. How old is Sue? Yeah, Sue, how old are you? 70. Sue? 29. 29? 10 years older. You like the older women, Ingrid? Sometimes, yeah. They guys are very... I think Sue could teach Ingrid a thing or two. Yeah. I'll probably teach her a thing or two too. Oh, well, challenge. Hold on, let me get them back here. I had to go. We got to know what Sue looks like. I had to get rid of the bad phone. Sue, what do you look like? Yeah. Um, 5'5". 132 pounds. Double D breast. That's it. That's good. That's good. Everyone... Okay. You can't laugh when you're breathing in. We weren't breathing for a second. Yeah, yeah. We held our breath for a second. Oh, no. Oh, no. You did, John. We can take a few pounds off that, okay? That's very good. Do the math, okay. Do you consider yourself hot, Sue? Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, I think I'm pretty. What could you think you could teach Ingrid a thing or two? Um, after hearing her, she might be able to teach me a thing or two. I think it'd be sexier to see the 19-year-old pin the 29-year-old down a letter. Yeah, yeah. Be like, you're my little bitch. Yes. I'm 19 and I'm going to make you my little bitch. All right, hold on. Another girl wants the dirty voice. Uh, Barbara? Yes. Hi. Hi, oh God. I finally got through to you. Anthony, I love you. Your voice is gorgeous. The girl frequently does this, doesn't she? Oh my God. Isn't that the most ridiculous thing in the world? I'm sitting right next to him. I have an erection that goes away when it goes. Exactly. I have an innie. If I get an erection, I've got a stomach ache. Anthony, you're just beautiful. You are gorgeous. Well, I'm not going to do anything for you. Why not? Because I'm being a holdout.

If you know a friend that might not have their radio on you might want to wake them up and get them on. This is it. Alright, we need girls to call that are willing to rub their you-know-what with the phone so we can take guesses on how you're trimmed, okay? And Buddy Hackett is going to play with us from LA. Oh my God. We'll be back. I like when a functioning idiot without a high school diploma can get a job in a radio. O.B. and Anthony. Be a girl of the mindless. O.B. 27, WNEW. Alright, it's O.B. and Anthony J. Moore in the studio. A bunch of girls on hold that want to rub their you-know-what. Guess what I got? Guess what? We're playing Guess What I Got in My Pants today. Brand new game. Brand new game on the O&S show. I want your transvestite to go up. No, no, no. Rub, rub, clang. And we're going to get Buddy Hackett on the line to help us out. He's going to bet all the way from LA. My father's college roommate was at the second show Sunday at Rascals. Yeah. And he showed me pictures of my father in college. And he goes, you know Buddy Hackett, you know, like how you were. You were like completely starstruck. Yeah, because I love Buddy Hackett. Well, this guy's like Buddy's age and loves him, you know? And he goes, I remember I was drunk coming out of the Waldorf Astoria and a cab was in front of me so I punched the cab and I heard a voice that said, what are you in a cab for? Are you just going to hurt your hand? And I looked up and it's Buddy Hackett. And I asked for his autograph, blah, blah, blah. And I go, well, let's call him right now. And the guy's face goes white. And I put Buddy on speakerphone. I go, Buddy, you're never going to guess who I have here. He goes, let me guess. I go, you're never going to guess. He goes, is it a man or a woman? I go, it's a man. He goes, well, you're never going to guess. He goes, what in the world is it? I go, it's my father's college roommate. He goes, oh, you mean Al. No, he made it. It's just funny. And then I put him on the phone with the guy for like five minutes. And then he hangs up the phone. He gives me the phone. And Buddy goes, Jay? I go, yeah, he goes, that's not him. He was taller. Buddy Hackett. What are you doing with them Opie and Anthony guys? Hey, Buddy, what's up? It's Jay. Hey, yeah, I know. You're on the air. How's everything in Mayberry, Opie? All right, Buddy, come on. He never heard that one before. I know. That's the first time, Buddy. Yeah, you know, Andy Griffith was a good friend of mine. Yeah? What happened? He's still alive, right? Well, he's starting to get fat. There's no sense two fat guys hanging out together. Hey, Buddy, you're going to love what we hooked up today for you. What do you got? We got girls on the phone that are rubbing the receiver end, the speaking end of their phone on their crotches, and we're playing a game, and we're all guessing if they're shaved into a mohawk, a triangle, or a Hitler mustache. Never mind that. I like to sell them new underwear. He sees a business opportunity. He's a crafty man, that Hackett. How are you, bud? I'm all right. We're sure. The joke you gave me killed every show you... Buddy, for this... I got another one for you. All right. You ready? Yeah. Wait. Okay, yeah. A guy said to his friend he's going to Mallorca. He said, do you speak Spanish? He said, no. He said, just speak very, very slowly. They'll think you speak in Spanish. He said to the clerk, I want a room. The clerk, would you like a view? The tourist, yes. The tourist, where are you from? The clerk, Ohio. The tourist, do you speak English? The clerk, yes, I do. The tourist, then why are we speaking Spanish? Ladies and gentlemen of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Philly. Buddy Hackett, my friend. Are you going to tell that tonight? I don't have a show tonight. I'm resting my voice by going on the radio for two hours. Yeah, well... I'll tell it in Boston. I'm up in Boston next. What place? The Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall. Oh, Faneuil Hall, yes. That used to be a good place to eat years ago. It still is. It still is, yeah. They redid the whole place. I was there for four months in 1946. That's when you met Brando, right? Yeah, me and Brando hanged out. He was at the Plymouth Theater. He told Tallulah... not Tallulah. They told... I forget her name. What, did you have a stroke? What happened? Yeah, yeah, it was Tallulah. Oh, okay. He said... Oh, tell that story. That's a great one. Yeah, in the middle of the show, he looked at it and he said, you have the worst breath. And that night he was replaced by an actor named Helmut Dantien. And I said, as it could be, he learned a part on the train coming up. They called him and told him while the show was still on. They called him. They took a train up from New York and played the evening performance. So they'll mock. Marlon started hanging out at my place going with a girl named Gina Belkin. Yeah? Yeah, and I believe they were doing all sorts of naughty stuff. So he got fired for telling the star that she had bad breath on stage. Well, she got rid of him somehow. Wow. Hey, look at me. I got fired last week just for telling him a funny line to put in the show. Well, for the listeners, Buddy Hackett was to appear on King of Queens. And Buddy showed up Monday and had some great ideas. Thought maybe his character should speak in Yiddish with subtitles. No, no, I didn't tell them that. I told them that. I'm just telling you what I heard, Buddy. Well, I told them that on the phone. When I first got the job, I told the agent. The agent called them. They called me. They don't even want to hear that. So I just had lived a couple of jokes in English. And then... Well, why didn't they want you on the show? I think that would have been a pretty big without a ratings for it. Well, what they said was, their reason was that I was intimidating because my persona was too big for the part. I said, how about my ass? I think that's what did it. Hey, so, Buddy, you want to play... What's in your pants? You want to guess how these go? Oh, sure. Is that, wait, what is it? Triangle, Mohawk, or what? Or Hitler mustache. Or Hitler mustache. A Hitler mustache. Yeah. Let's start. Well, I would like to meet a girl that wears her muff in a Hitler mustache. Yeah, huh? Yes. Where is her muff? And you just yell, Hile hump. Hey, Lynn. Yeah. This is the best radio there's ever been. We got Buddy Hacker 3,000 miles away guessing Bush. How are you, Lynn? I'm all right. This is Linda, but that's all right. Oh, Linda, I'm sorry. Hi, Linda. You're on the air. Hello, Linda. Hi, Linda. Hi, Buddy. Hi, James. What city are you in? What? What city? Oh, I'm not in this city. I'm in Jersey. Jersey. That's what I'm asking you. Which city in New Jersey? He's going to hear her. Jersey has no cities. Yeah, good. There used to be a cop in Fort Lee. Oh, well, I'm here. Don't make him mad. Don't make him mad. You'll fall out of a window. Per se. Per se. Oh, God. All right. You got a rub pretty hard so we can hear it through the phone, okay? Pretty hard. No, it's like Jimmy Valentine. Can I think of J. Moore while I'm doing it? Oh, yeah. Oh, he's so hot. You just got hotter. Can you tell Buddy Hackett how hot he is as well, please? Buddy Hackett, you are just incredibly hot. I would love to take your skin, unwrinkle it, and lick every inch of it. Yeah, could we make that retroactive about 53 years so I can feel it? All right. The big, Barry Katz, the big Jew, just added something to the equation. What about completely balds? Of course. Of course. That's going to be obvious. I can guarantee you I'm not completely bald. You can't help us. No help. No helps. Okay, we're going to let Buddy have the first guess. So, Lim, when you're ready. And, Lim, don't reveal any secrets about how you are groomed down there until we all vote. There's four votes, Lim. All right. Buddy, listen closely. She will now rub. Okay, hold on. Okay. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Lim, one more time. Yeah, I don't have another time. How about another time? Okay. All right. Very natural in the center, trimmed on the side. And you must have gone out with a fireman because there's a brass button at the end. Yeah, don't say it. Don't say anything. That was very cute. But don't let it all be right or not, Lim. Yeah, well. All right, Lim. Buddy has four separate times for you guys. That was Buddy's guess. Very natural. Okay, now. My guess is very natural. Rub again. Don't give us any clues. And I guess who's up next? He was the data of the fireman because he's got a brass hand. No, that's sick because my father is a fireman. Oh, my God. There you go. All right, Lim. They're freaking me out. All right, Lim, one more rub there. One more rub. One? I'm going to give you one more. Well, who's up? The rest of us. We just want to hear one more time. All right. All right. Hold on. Oh, yeah. That's long. Oh, yeah. That's long. Okay. All right. Now I'm thinking Ulysses Grant long. No, it's not Ulysses Grant long. I'm going to go. No, it's not Ulysses Grant long. Don't say anything. Lim, you got to play by the rules. I mean, okay. There's like 30 girls on hold, Lim. Don't break the rules. Can I go? Yeah, sure. I'm going to say pool rack filled with Afro hair. Thank you, Cal Bell Bell. Pool rack. Filled with Afro hair. I'm going to say the same. Really? I think I'm going more with a couple of pieces of silly putty slapped together thrown on the barbershop floor. And Lim, what's in your pants? Let's see what would be the closest to that. Obviously natural big. It's natural, but it's triangle. Yeah. That's what I said. That's natural. Buddy said natural trimmed on the side. Yeah, trimmed on the sides. I'm not going to go with Harry down my legs or anything. No, no, we didn't mean that, but the hair is, even though it's a triangle, it's a big triangle. That boyfriend likes it natural. It's a pool rack. So we all win. Yeah. It's like Anthony. Like to run his fingers through it. Harry. You know, when I first heard it, I thought it was a hat for a guy who graduated from Rutgers. Hey, my friends go to Rutgers. You leave them alone. You're a big furry hat. All right, Lim, thank you. We're all in. Anthony's down in the hole now. Yeah. Damn. Anthony won. I'm undefeated, baby. Let's go to Crystal. That could be a fun one. Crystal. Hey, Crystal. Hi. Hi. How are you? Let me hear you. Oh, good. Your phone's okay. All right. Are you ready to play What's in Your Pants? Of course. Okay. You're going to think of a better name. Really? You want to say hi to Buddy Hackett, the famous Buddy Hackett? Hi, sweetheart. Oh, hello, Crystal, dear. How are you? Very well. I certainly hope to enjoy you someday as I did your mother and your grandmother. Oh, my God. Okay. You all remember Buddy. It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world. Of course. Crystal, is that your real name or your escort name? No, that's really my name. All right. You got your pants down? Well, I got to pull over if you can give me a second. Oh, you need to pull over? I'm going to pull over. All right. All right. You're in a car? Yeah. You should have pulled over while you were on the road. Yeah. What highway are you on? I'm on the New Jersey town bike. All right. You hear that, guys? If you see anybody pulling over, help her. It's a girl that has her pants down. On the bank, extension. All right. Are you pulled over? She wants someone to help her. Listen to her. I mean, can you imagine if a cop comes over and she's got the phone down there on her pants and he says to me, don't tell me you pulled over. Are you ready? I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. And he says to me, don't tell me you're making a phone call. All right. For all of our listeners, I should point out. I pulled over. Hold on one second. Hold on, Crystal. We can sing together. We can't talk together. All right. You ready? Hold on. Hold on. For all the listeners, you absolutely, it's a moratorium. It's forbidden. You may not interrupt Buddy Hackett. You can interrupt anybody. Absolutely. When Hackett speaks, people listen. No stepping on Hackett. No stepping on the master. All right. All right, Crystal. All right. Hold on. All right. Here she goes. Little rub. Whoa. All right. All right. We can do it again. Yeah. One more time. All right. Hold on. I'm going to pull over again. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Have you got a sheep in the car? I'm going to guess first. Buddy guesses first. I think you win a case of Woolite. All right, Buddy. What do you think? I think there's nothing done. It's just very, very normal the way it is. And it hasn't been trimmed or shaped or anything. Very natural. All right. Completely natural. Go ahead, Jay. I say she is a very tiny Mohawk. Oh, really? Go ahead. She is a very tiny Mohawk. Oh, really? Go with the Mohawk. Like a two-finger Mohawk. Yeah. But a long one. Like an aircraft carrier. Yeah. I'm going to go with the aircraft carrier, Seth. You should just gravy train and everything. No, I didn't go with you last time. I'm going to go fine-trimmed two-finger Mohawk. Same as me. Yeah. So Buddy says natural and the three of us say Mohawk. A bunch of people saying Hitler mustang. Yeah, screw them. All right, Crystal? Mohawk. Yeah. Wow. It's a Mohawk. I'm three for three, everybody. Yeah. Jay Moore, bush expert. I guess I'm only talking from memory. All right, hold on, Crystal. Buddy, back in your day, girls didn't really shave into a Mohawk, did they? Who knows? We didn't even know they had fur there. Didn't you look? Not in the dark. No one went around in the light. Really? If you just set them up, I'll lock them down. Don't worry, Anthony. All right, hold on. Let's get Crystal's card. Wait, we need a scorecard. We got to keep track of this. You and I are even. Get a blank piece of paper. You and I are even. You guys are two and O. Buddy and I are one and one. No, you got three. I got two wins. And Buddy and Anthony got one. Hold on, let me write this down. O, B, Anthony. All right, let's go to Joni. Joni, say hi to Buddy Hackett. Hi, Buddy Hackett. Hello, Joni. How are you? I'm great. Are you cold? I'm really cold. All right, this is Joni. Are you calling me? Oh, listen, I've got a phone. Joni, I hope that isn't the sound to take in. You might want to see a gynecologist. All right, Joni. Yeah. Okay, are you in a car? Where are you? I'm at home in my living room. And your pants are off? Yeah. Okay, so you're in a car. I'm at home in my living room. And your pants are off? Yeah, I'm actually a Rutgers student for that girl who was calling before. Oh, very good. Okay. Oh, it's going around. Yeah. And since you're at home, do you live alone? No, I live with my boyfriend and my best friend. Are you alone now? No, my boyfriend's here too. Okay, so what you could do for us and for the listeners that drive and get horny daily on the O, B, and Anthony show is since it's just you and your boyfriend and your pants are off and your underpants are off. Right. Right. I think you should just spread them really wide on the couch. Okay. And that is hot. Okay. Buddy, what do you think? Good idea, right? Well, you know, I'm always in favor of that because I used to be an upholsterer. And every time a couch gets a little syrup on it, we get to do it over. Okay. Oh, man. All right, Joni, you got the phone. Okay. Let's give it a good rub. Okay, get ready. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. He's all cocky now. That's easy. Buddy, you're up. I think it's just she's faking this out with a Brillo pad. Let me ask you guys a question. Yeah. Has a sound come out of his mouth that wasn't ten for ten funny? Everything he said is funny. Buddy, you are on fire. I'm going to give you a little bit of a Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Are you hitting somebody's head? My boyfriend says he wants to rub it on his face. No, thank you. Alright, J, it's to you. Wow, I'm 3 and 0. Yeah, you don't want to screw up now. She's bald. Wow, you're going for bald? Oh, gosh, I tie you here. I'm going triangle, finely trimmed. Alright. Buddy? Don't say buddy for last, go on. No, no, I said it already. He said the Brillo pad. I thought you'd take the shot with the Brillo pad. You're going for you, Brennan there. I'm going to go with Hitler mustache. Okay, so you ready? Yeah, I'm going to get Hitler mustache. It's wood floor. Wood floor, she's bald. Oh my God. Are you serious? The guy can't lose. Hey buddy, have you come across hairless in your day? No, never have. What about men? I don't know anything about them dudes. Alright, Joni, thank you. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye bye. I have four and everyone else has stuck it too. We've got to take a break. You know something? You screwed me up because I was going to say bald but I didn't want you going, oh look, you're just latching on. Go for what you know, man. That was good. Buddy, are you going to hang with us for a while? No, I think I'm going to get off and go take a few of them injections to see if you get an erection. I'm going to tell you something, I've been on a lot of radio shows. The last time I did one, you weren't allowed to say I pulled a hair out of my nose. So could you imagine? It's been a long time. Oh now, forget about it. The whole world has changed. Wow. You like it, right buddy? Do I like it? Yeah. I want to get in on it. It was guys like you that paved the way, pal. A little bit, yes I did. Alright buddy. I remember asking a woman in the front show, I said, could you show us your bosom? And she said, no. I said, right, we're only curious, could you just show one? And she wouldn't do that either. That was very bold in those days. Buddy, we love you man. I love you. Love you guys all. God have a wonderful life. But I think you've got a hell of a jump on the rest of us. Alright buddy. Bye bye. We would love to call you again someday. Oh, by all means. Alright buddy, hack it everyone. Thank you buddy. Very good. Legend. And we'll be back. Stay there. What's that? A train? What's that a train? OP and Anthony, 1027 WNEW. OP, you're a sick ass man. Anthony.

You're not a jackass, you're obviously a star. OP and Anthony show. It makes me sick. Yes. OP and Anthony show. Having a lot of fun with Jay Moore and Buddy Hackett. Playing What's In My Pants with Buddy Hackett today. What's in my pants. What's in my pants with Buddy Hackett. That was about as funny as it could ever possibly get. God damn. Whoever thought you'd be playing What's In My Pants with Buddy Hackett when you're growing up watching him on TV and stuff. You pulled into 70 and over audience. Yeah, see. Pretty much. That'll pull it off. I could see my mom. Hey, hey Fred. Buddy Hackett's on. On the show today. Watching Carson. Anthony's parents were here when we had Lesbian for a day. That's true. Yeah. God damn. See, I don't know why. You guys do it every day, but when I'm here it makes an indelible mark on my landscape because I've never had more fun in my life. I actually remember every single thing that goes on. Yeah. So do your listeners. When I'm on stage they scream out like. They just yell out like a sentence I said over Thanksgiving. Yeah, they got sponges for memories there. They remember it all. Hey, you gotta tell your Jimmy Schubert story. Yeah, Schubert is a comedian and he was in Go. He was, if you saw Go, both of you, he was the bodyguard that got shot in the strip club when Taye Diggs and the English guy go to the strip club and they go, no matter what you do don't say you want champagne. And Jimmy Schubert had a lollipop and he goes, it's a gentleman's club. You act like a gentleman, touch the girls and break your arm. That was his line. And they told him, when you do a movie like if you're a low man on the totem pole, Jimmy never done a film before, they kind of saved you the less. Like when I did Jerry Maguire, they just got to meet at the end of the day. What am I going to complain? It's Tom Cruise, you know. So 11 hours go by, they're in Vegas and they knock on Jimmy's trailer and like, Jimmy, we're not going to need you today. Sorry about that. You come in tomorrow, 7 a.m. Is that all right? He's like, yeah, of course. You know, he just doesn't want to make waves. He's in a big, hot movie. It's a shot, yeah. So he's leaving and the guy who plays his father was like this Vietnam vet, like this crazy actor. And he goes, Jimmy, where are you going? He's like, oh, they released me. He goes, you want to smoke a joint? So Jimmy's like, I guess this is what you do on movie sets, you know, because we know Jimmy doesn't drink or do drugs, right? Right. Jimmy's listening right now with a joint. So the guy, Jimmy goes in this guy's trailer and he smokes like the guy just keeps passing him the joint. So Jimmy just keeps smoking. This is a true story. And Jimmy gets so, you know, when you're so high, you get like that panic attack and you're like, this guy's going to kill me. But they're in like a little tiny like a little like, you know, like a one like a little trailer. Yeah, he's a Vietnam vet. He's a Vietnam vet. He's like, so one time I'm in Cambodia and this Chinese broad tried to shoot me. So I cracked her head open and I still got the skull. He said it's an ashtray. Someone just stoned here and that freaks you out. And this was like hydro weird that this guy had. This guy's been smoking every day since now. So Jimmy's so stoned he can't even feel his legs. He's completely freaked out. There's a knock on the trailer and one of the assistant directors goes, is Jimmy in here? And they're like, yeah. He's like, all freaked out. She goes, Jimmy, turns out we are going to need you. So if you watch Go and you see Jimmy Schubert with the lollipop in his mouth, just know he probably has a lollipop in his mouth to keep from biting his own tongue off. Stone that was good. Stone that was mine. First film ever. First line. First time ever on camera. Jimmy, you know what? My bad. We are going to need you. And with that, let's go back to what's in my pants. Who's leading? What's in my pants? I got four. Everyone else has two. But Hackett is, I guess, an honorary judge. So we'll just hold him at two. OK. And you know what we'll do? Every time you guys play, I assume you'll call me in LA. Oh, yeah. So you can be in on this? So we'll just give Hackett a point every time we play. We've got to get Kevin Spacey in on this when you're filming the movie with him. OK. How about the little kid for the six heads? Get the little kid. Hi, thanks. I didn't want to finish that. Liz, what's up? Hi. Hi. You want to play What's in My Pants? Yeah. OK. Where are you? I'm in New Jersey. All right. I'm in home. Oh, in my boyfriend's house. We want the single checks. But OK. All right. Is he there? Yes, he's here. Oh, he's like, he made you call, didn't he? Yes, he did. I'm done. I just did 10 shows. I know you're listening. All right. OK, our pants are down, guys. I love these guys. Cool. All right. You got the phone? Yes, I do. All right. Let's give it a good rub there. All right. Here we go. OK. OK. I got it. Yeah. I hate to hear it again, but I need you to rub it. Ladies, if you're listening, of course you're listening because we've got the whole 55 freaking bros on hold. They can't. Out of all the games that you think you get people to rally behind. Yes. This one. I'm going to go sideways. Go sideways? Real fast. All right, hold on. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. I'm going to go sideways. OK. Come on, Ann. Now you have to do it again. OK. Ann went for the funny. Yeah. Now that hack is gone. It feels like he's going to feel his shoes. OK. Go sideways. Go sideways one more time. OK. OK. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I think I do. OK. Someone's holding up a swastika. No, I don't think she shaved it into a swastika. Now remember, don't give your answer until we are all done. OK. OK. See you. Mr. Mate, one more time, up and down, up and down. Everybody quiet, please. Quiet, please. OK. But you can't answer until we're all done. OK. Everybody knows the rules now. We don't have to repeat them. OK. It's a very, very short mohawk. Is that your final answer? That's my final answer. Who wants to guess Gash? I'm going to go longer mohawk, but thin. Longer mohawk, thin. Thin how? What do you mean thin? It's definitely like a finger and a half mohawk. Oh, mohawk. I'm sorry. But it's a little longer. Longer, narrow. You said short. Very short triangle, I meant to say. Oh, short triangle. Did I say mohawk by accident? Yeah. I was wishful thinking. All right. For the record, my guess is a very short, like, putting green triangle. I'm going one and a half finger mohawk, kind of long. I am going to say that I think any sound being made is merely a receiver on skin. I'm going to go shaved completely. You're right. Oh! Yeah. That got me out of the hole. Do it again. Let's hear it again. I'm not really good at it. Again? Hold on. Okay. No, no, no. I didn't hear anything. Up and down slowly. Okay. Yeah. Man, you're right. How did I miss that? That's like a big head. How did I miss that one? All right. Well, Liz, thanks for playing. All right. Thanks a lot. Okay. Bye-bye. We got a barber that wants to play. What time are you going to get up? I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. I'm going to get up at 8. In my day we never looked right at it because it would bite you. They call it beaver because it could chew wood. Hello? Barbara? Yes? You ready to play What's in My Pants? This is Celine Dion. I want to play too. Bye bye. Oh boy. No, we can't just be... This is not Rascals. She's being wacky. Leave the jokes to me. Let's go to Rain. Rain? Hi. You want to go to Rain? That's our porno name. Rain, can I have your stripper name? It gets worse. I think it's Bo. You're Rain Bo? No, Rain Bo. Rain Bo? Are your parents hippies? What? Are your parents hippies? I already know the answer to this, man. Really? Wild and wooly. Like a mammoth. It's got busts. All right, Rain, you want to play What's in My Pants? Where are you? I am on my couch. Okay. Who else is there? Nobody. Spread them. I spread. Really? I spread. Are you getting ready? No, I'm not. Why don't you pleasure yourself a little bit getting ready? I always do when I listen to your day. Wow. What about when you listen to Opie and Ethel? What about when you listen to Opie and Ethel? Hey, you guys got some, Ron, don't worry about it. Don't be jealous. I got a boss in two days. You guys get to stick around. You got to say hi to us on stage and see what the crowd reaction is. That'll be huge. I know. I will say hi to Mark Parento. Hey, Rain. Who? Yes. Okay, you ready? I'm ready. What's in my pants everyone? It's tricky with the static. Okay. Whoa. Wow, your phone's a little wacky. My phone? I thought it was my headset. I thought it was static. I thought I was in the space shuttle and it's not functioning. One more time, one more time. Okay, hang on. Take it easy now. Yeah. What are you blowing into it? No, I'm rubbing. Rolly fingers. I just raked it out of a sign that said, Rolly fingers. Wow, that's a bold statement you're saying there, Psycho Mark. Really? You think so? Look at what he held up. I know what he held up. That's crazy. But you know what? If you guess that and you're right, he's going to be like, I told you. Yeah. All right, it's to Jay. No, I can't go. I'm not sure. I'm on the fence. Well, you've got to make some rules. I guess whoever, no, because there might be multiple winners. Who's away? Yeah, I hope he's away. All right. With a name like Rainbow, you're one of those wild hippie chicks. I've got to go pool rack filled with afro hair. Jerry Garcia's head in the leg lock. Yeah, pretty much. Hold on, don't give her a cure. Badge. All right. All right. Oh my God. You know the Psycho Mark. I don't like that. You know the dude from Boston. You know the dude from Boston with the big, huge afro. Sib Hashen. Yeah, his head in a leg lock. That's wrong. I don't like that. That's Psycho Mark. That's not good. That's not good. That's the biggest rages on the face of the earth. All right. Anthony, it's to you. Okay. Can I hear it one more time? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Up and down, very slowly. What kind of phone are you on? I have a cordless. That's our phone line. It sucks. All right, wait, hang on. All right, she's going to switch phones and I have to change my guess. Sorry. Is that better? Oh, I hope he was talking. Sorry. Do it again, please. Again? Yes. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm going to go. No, I'm not saying that. I am saying ... This is Cyprus. No, no, no. I will say Mohawk. That's what I'm saying and I'm sticking to it. Jay, you are up. I am absolutely perplexed. It is a tough one. You want to ... For view to try and go ... Jay, if you need time, we could go to Kitty Carlisle first before we go to Anthony. Okay. I'm going to go to ... I'm going to go to Anthony. Okay. I'm going to go to Anthony. Okay. I'm going to go to Anthony. Okay. I'm going to go to Anthony. Okay. I'm going to go to Anthony. Okay. Jay, if you need time, we could go to Kitty Carlisle first before we go to Anthony. Let me hear it one more time. Okay. Hang on. Everybody be quiet. Don't even pull papers or write. Genius at work. Okay. I'm going to go with what I said with the other girl, a very putting green triangle. All right. That's three guesses. Rain? All right. Rain? What's in your pants? I'm going to be safe. Oh my God. Psycho Mark was right. Completely safe. I don't understand what that sound is coming from. Were you blowing in the phone? No. Hey, are you stumbling? That's right. The razor stubble is throwing us off. When was the last time you ... I saved this morning. God damn it. It must be a diamond. There's a sound of ... I can't tell you. She's got a five o'clock shadow on her Fred Flintstone face. She's got a crucifix around her waist. Oh wow. You know, we live and learn. Thank you, Rain. No one picked the ball. Rain, thanks for playing What's in My Pants. Psycho Mark, not only does that offend me, but I can't even look at it like when you're just holding it. You just got to rip that up and throw it on the other side. Rip it up and just put it in the trash. Because I saw it out of the corner of my eye and it bothers me that much. What's the score? It's still four years away. Four three. It's still four or three to me. All right. This could be the last one. If Jay gets this, he wins. For now. Yeah. Tonya. Hi. Hi. Are you ready to play What's in My Pants? Yes, I am. Where are you? You sound like an older one. I am home. I'm what? How old are you, Tonya? Oh, I'm 35. I knew it. How could you tell? Because I'm the pimp. Okay. 35 is not old. 35 is not old. I didn't say old. I married to a 24-year-old. That's a lucky one. I'm going to do a guess without even ... Oh my God. Go ahead. Do a guess before. Hold on. Let's parlay this. That should be worth two. Three? No, two. He only has two. You can take ... That's all right. I'll go for two. All right. He's going for the triple. Okay. Wait a minute. If it's three, if you get it right, if you're wrong, you take one away. Fine. That's your game. Fine. Okay. 35 married to a 24-year-old. That's right. Without hearing it. And don't say if I'm right because everyone else has to guess. Go ahead. And don't be gross. Well, that could be gross. It's ... Oh, that helped me right there. Hitler mustache. Don't say it. You just take a point away right now. All right. Okay. Take a point away. I'm going to go for the V, but ... All right. We would like to hear it. Yeah, because we're not stupid. If you would take the phone ... I had a gamble. And rub ... Okay. Ready? On your most intimate of areas. Yes, please silence, please. All right. Here we go. Horace? What's in my pants? You hear it? Oh, yeah. Mark has been ... I'm going to go with the V. Okay. You hear it? Oh, yeah. Psycho Mark has ball in the brain. No, you know why? There were two distinctly different sounds in that rub, Psycho Mark. Two distinctly different sounds. Let's hear that again. We are experts. We thought we were part of the game. Okay, hold on. Okay? Origami. Got the New York Times in your lap? It feels like she's crumbling those ramen noodles. All right. Who's up? Robin. Who's holding that game for me, Robin? I will say a natural triangle just ... No, don't do yourself because then it's not what you're going to do. Okay, you're right. Some guy on the Instant Feedback wrote, it's anal fuzz. These guys are nuts. Yes, I will say natural triangle. I'm going to say the same. You're saying the same thing. I'm going to be training you this time. Okay, and if we could have your answer, please. Who said Hitler must die? Yes, I'm in the lead. Who said it? Opie. All right, Opie. Opie, you added on the ... Oh my God. He took three. Why did he get that? Why did he get that? Why did you guess that, Opie? Older lady trying to impress her man, so I'm thinking, it totally takes away from the audio purpose of this game. That was his answer. All right, I understand. I understand. You're getting the hang of it. I understand everything, but this game is supposed to be purely audio. I would even go on a limb and say you might have a piercing down there. You'd be wrong. Take your point away. Let me hear it. I never heard of Hitler Mustache before. Let's hear it. We've got to say, we're buddies at Hale Humph. I should have known because there were two distinct sounds. All right, go ahead. One more for the encore. Hold on. What's in my pants? What's in my pants? How long are the hairs on the Hitler Mustache? About a quarter inch. Not even a quarter inch. I keep a really close shave. It sounds like Yosemite Sam. You varmin! No, no, no. That's probably where I'm hitting my leg hair. That conjures up an image. You deserve it, guys. Well, Tanya, thanks for playing What's in My Pants. You got it. Thanks for blowing me out of the lead. Damn it. We've got to take one more. Let me get the lead back. You guys agreed? I know we agreed, but in hindsight. Okay, Opie, you pulled out at five to four. We have one last lady on the line, I believe. Damn it. Well, next time we play, we'll just go with audio. No, no, no. Now I want to play the Opie rules. No, no, I think that's very good. If you ever played Spades, you can go blind five, choose your books. Okay. I could have lost. We got card references, golf references. Jen. Third Reich. Did we lose Jen? Hello. Hey. Hi. How you doing? Do you want to play? This is a guy. That's a guy. Guy got past Spaz. Spaz, you're retarded. I'm not a guy. You sound like a guy. You're a guy. I am not. You're a young guy. I am not. I am not. Where are you from? What? Hello, is this Jay? Listen to that. Get out of here. Kiss my ass off. Hello. I can hear your atoms. I am not a guy. A guy. I am not a guy. Let's see. Now he's a black guy. That's Michael Jackson. Yeah, that's a kid. I hope it's Mike from Brooklyn. Come you nut. Come you nut. Unless another girl calls within the next minute.

Well, I have the lovely, beautiful Anita Cox here, and she would like to play a part of the game. Anita Cox? Yes, her name is Anita. Oh, no, Anita. Anita, Anita. Her last name is Cox. Right, we get the joke. She's interested in playing the game. Is she going to be there tonight? Absolutely. Because I'm coming down tonight with a couple of... Well, she's waiting for you tonight, and there's a couple of the girls that were asking for Opie. All right, there we go. Lashlaw, you don't even know how much trouble I'm in.

Alright, and then I'm going to update the guys tomorrow on what you look like and see if you're really Italian. I'm going to look at your driver's license where it says Vicky Donatello on it. Instead of Anita Cox. You don't want to be disappointed? Alright, Anita, we're going to let you go. Okay. Alright, um. I'm happy to the game. Oh, we forgot about the game a while ago. But Jay's going to be down there tonight, okay? Okay, that's great. Alright. Bye bye. Miss Cox, everyone. Wow. She's impossible to play the game with. Yeah, it's just going to take too long. You know what happens? Because you know what? We go ahead and she'd rub the phone on her foot because she refused. What? She rubbed it around my pants, on my pant, on my ankles. So I rubbed it around my foot. Alright. What? We've got to finish up the show and this game with. Oh, what a good time. We're going to play with Donna. One more here. Donna? Yes.

I'm going to see if I can swing some privilege tricks up here to see if we can do it live with our heads. As long as you have room at your bachelor pad. You guys are the absolute best friends I've ever been. We really got to go. You guys, we'll see you tomorrow at 2. Thanks for listening. Joe Rambeau, Jay. Always a pleasure. We'll see you. I love you guys. Bye. We punish ignorance. Hey, ass, turn down your radio. 1027 WNEW.
