 That's it. Ladies and gentlemen, the following statements did not necessarily reflect the opinion of anyone in his right mind. Now Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. Please, hold the internet for a show. 1027 WNEW We like to tear away the walls, the curtains, the mystique of the stripper. Wouldn't it be cool to backstage at the strip club or in a room full of strippers and hear what they talk about? I bet it's hot. I bet it's... No. You know what it is? It's this. Well, not any of all that hair. I'm just looking at him. Are you my summer? I need to shave your... I'm like, yes, but he... They want you to know that he shaves his hair. That'll save my hair. I'm giving up strip club and train wreck radio. OV and Anthony. 1027 WNEW It's FU Friday. What a week of radio we've had. Oh yeah. I say it has the potential to be the best show of the week, Anthony. Yeah. Real fast, Andrew's on the line. 2127571027. Andrew, first call of the day. What's going on, man? Yeah, I got to give an FU after those strippers from Wednesday. I'm a little underage and I was kind of looking forward in a couple years to getting into one of those strip clubs, but those girls, man, they turned me off completely. Well, I mean, they're still good to look at. Just don't have a conversation with them. Oh, of course. By the way, all you girls out there? Yeah. It's okay to wow someone underage. It's okay. We've got wow signs, we've got tweens, and we like to use them. It's not illegal, right? Right. Yeah, I wish I had Whipped Him Out Wednesday when I was growing up. Yeah, see, we're giving everybody things that we didn't have when we were kids. That's right. I hope you appreciate it. Real live boobs. All right, guys. Syndication never. Yeah. That's okay. Thank you, Andrew. All right. All right. There he goes. Andrew, first call of the day, Anthony. All right. And wow, we've got a great show for you all. We actually planned today's show. FU Friday. FU Friday. Jim Brewer coming in. He's a very funny guy. Yeah. A good friend of the show. Slowly but surely becoming our favorite guest. Yes, he's getting close to Jay Moore territory. And he doesn't plug as much. And of course, I believe Adam Ferrara. Adam's coming back today. Very good. Appearing at Governor's all weekend tomorrow. And also we're doing Stoner Spelling Bee. Our favorite when Jim Brewer comes here. Yes. That's kind of his game. Yeah. We've decided to give him his own game. Every comedian that we really like, we give them a special game, Anthony. Yeah. That one's fun. We're running out of games. We could give like a bra bingo to one of our favorite comedians. That one's still up for grabs. I don't know. Who could that be? The next comedian that starts coming in a lot and giving us really good radio. We'll give them bra bingo. Yeah, well today it's going to be Stoner Spelling Bee. We get to have fun and you at home get to smoke pot. Yeah. So that's kind of cool, right? So don't call now. Don't call now. We're not getting contestants yet. No. We'll do that within the hour though, okay? Mm-hmm. And also, Anthony. And how do you tell if you have good pot, Opie? How? I got it from a negro. That's right. All right.

Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please? We suck. If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 1027-WNEW. And action. I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. Okay, terrific. And cut. Opie. Anthony. 1027-WNEW. Did I just miss something good? Oh, God, yeah, that's good. It's the O&A show. Look who's in the studio. Brewer. He doesn't feel like sitting down. That could be scary right off the bat. Jim Brewer in the studio, everyone. Brewer, let him rip. Brewer quickly becoming our favorite guest. Yes. The listener is really digging the Brewer. We have a lot of fun. The Brewer appearance is on the show. A lot of fun when Brewer's on. He would have been on for the first break of the show, but he had to check in with the wife. Checking the wife, make sure it's cool. Now, what were you telling him? Wait, lift up, lift up, lift up. Am I there? Yeah. What were you telling him? Well, we go way back with Brewer. I started talking to Brewer when I was working at VAB in Long Island. Really? Oh, yeah. I did knock in the back door. Yeah, when he was knocking out the back door. Oh, Opie here, man. Tell him the comedian, I'm playing at the brokerage. Right, the brokerage. This was before SNL and all that stuff. Oh, yeah, before all that stuff, when I was just like the pigeon guy. I must say, you haven't changed much over the years. It was nice. Because there's other people we've talked to and watched your career blossom and they don't want to know us anymore. I've changed. I'm a real son of a pigeon. You're an a-hole. What happened to you, man? First time I was on a show, you were a nice guy. Now you're just like a dick. Goo goo dolls. Anyway, goo goo dolls. What? They're like, oh, I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. Anyway, goo goo dolls. What? It's true. I know. We had the goo goo dolls on the show up in Boston a few times when no one knew who they were. You guys are so great. Thanks for having us. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. They hung out. They were cool. When that song name was out and they were just finally getting some airplay and they did an acoustic version for a CD we put out and stuff. And then that was it. And then they started getting huge. And then like every visit, it just got worse and worse. We'll be on next week. We'll talk next week. It just got worse and worse. And then they just flat out stopped coming around because they didn't need us anymore. It happens all the time with you big shots. Well, hopefully. You know what? What happens is these people and I tried telling them, yo, no bug out, man. You know? Dude, you got to do, but. Stay grounded, man. Yeah, you know what I'm saying. Keep it real. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm still fat. I'm playing soccer on Wednesday. I've got my med socks. Come on. And I'm sliding hard, Hammer. We're not taking our shirts off. I was telling Brewer during the commercials, like I said, we go way back and when we're doing our radio show in Boston, Brewer checked in and he was doing some, I don't know, an interview for something live from his car. Yeah. He was driving. You were driving from his car. You were driving on the LIE, matter of fact. You had your wife in the car and you were driving on the LIE, and you were driving on the LIE. And he was driving on the LIE. And he was driving on the LIE. And he was driving on the LIE. And he was driving on the LIE. and we were getting into some just wild discussion. And obviously your wife and the parents couldn't hear what we were saying. So you said something just completely outrageous, I forget now. your wife in the back of the car go, what? And all of a sudden you let his wife defend you, you go, but honey, you should hear what they're saying on the other end of this line. I'm not on here with Larry King right now. You're talking about something that was just so wrong. Shicks will challenge that point. Girls, you know, you've been married 50 years, they were like, right before you got the big gig. And I know you've been knocking at the door. And this is like the show. This is the show we send the whole movie. Right. The big gig. And there she is. Hold on a second because I'm not feeling great about our last topic and I really think we should finish this. I know you have to go in 30 seconds, but I really need to talk to you. Perfect timing. I'm going to film a movie this way. That's when you tell me to go in 30 seconds. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm going to film a movie this way. I'm sorry that I leave this shirt on. It's been three weeks. I know! And not like there's a whole film crew waiting for you to get there and stuff, right? Can't you tell them to wait? You're the star. It's more important to talk about why you can't pick up your goddamn underwear and put it in the hamper, which is right over here. But, honey, I'm going to film a movie. Do you have to leave this toothpaste in the bathroom sink? Is DeMiro going to send your mother mother's day card? Is that what he's doing? Oh, I didn't know you guys were such close friends. They really care about you, idiot. What could you do? Because I know it's in there. If I have another cheesy gun, then have you have the yam sack. Yes, and tell me that you didn't like the card I picked up. Well, f you, Brian! It's funny for me because it's addicted memory. I'm sweating in my swamp ass. That's what I realized. You heard that the other day. Bro, keep it up for the show. I like that. I realize with... Yeah, man, dude. Yeah, you're in it, man. I need that. Now you're in it. It's like crack now. See? The show's like crack. By the way, my brothers do want to play a Whiffleball. Let's do that. You want to do a Whiffleball game together? Does Adam play? Yeah, Adam will play, sure. He runs real funny. We've got to have him run in the studio. Here's Adam running up the stairs. Now, it's great. It's radio, so no one can see this, but his legs will fly out to the side while he runs. I know people that run like that. We used to laugh at him all the time. We've got to make him run when he gets here. Run, Adam, run. Run, Adam, run. I can't take that shot yet. No? You can. Come on. Yeah, you can. The guy was banging my sister for a while, so I can say anything I want. And he flirted with my sister, too. Wow. Yeah, when he was playing Fast Eddie. Get out. In Huntington. I love the guy like a brother. Like a brother, I love Adam. But he is one of the stupidest individuals when it comes to certain things. He's going out with my sister, right? He's banging my sister. But then he's hanging out with me and my brother Joe in the bar talking like guys talk about how he was sucking face with this other chick. And my brother's like, Adam, I will break your effing face open, you stupid son of a bitch. So of course my brother went to my sister and said, you know, Adam's a great guy. We love hanging out with him and stuff, but I don't think he's really a good guy for you to maybe get serious about or anything. Because, you know, we're out there. This is when he's doing stand-up. I mean, he still does it. This was three days ago. This was three days ago. This was last week. This was a big old Georgian ass flunked over a table. Left some knuckle marks in her buttocks. Man, it was great. How's your sister? Oh, it's great. Now this has gone back maybe ten years. Smacked her in the head, came back. Got caught in the undertow. It was like ten years ago. So it's a while ago. You know, we could all look back and laughter now. I had no clue you guys were tight like that because Adam and I, they grew up together. Adam, I, Kevin James. Kevin James, yeah. And his brother. We were all down at Eastside. The Eastside crew at Minervini, man. You know, I broke that. You ever been in Eastside? Remember the Eastside with Minervini? Yeah. Well. Richie, huh? Remember? Hey, guys, I'll make it real tight tonight. Make it real tight tonight. Hey, get some Thomas Stegg's ass. Make it richie, man. Wow. There's the man, Richie. I can give you $40. What about Gary? I don't want so many people in the door. He watches out. He watches out. Well, they had a big glass, um, glass, uh, glass. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, last, um, remember there was like a booth, like a disco booth in the back? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, all eight of you, welcome to the Eastside Comedy Club, where it's bring whoever you want for free night. Get drunk and urine on the opening act. Let them know his mother likes being kidney punched. Welcome. So anyway. The home of Eddie Murphy. I don't think, I don't think Eddie stepped foot in the plays after like 82. 82, probably in the late 70s. They would always say that though, the home of Eddie Murphy. Yeah, that was like the big famous guy that came out of it. And what's his name? Bob, uh, come on, the guy went, my number 42. Bob Nelson. Bob Nelson. He's been playing that act for 15 years. That was funny for five minutes. You could get seriously killed. Okay. I remember. So they had this glass mirror thing in front of it. And now we can tell the truth. Doesn't matter anyway. Ah, time. I'm trying to think of Adam was there that night. I don't know. I was all hopped up and I was showing my friend. Oh, I was imitating this brawl. I got a brawl in Virginia. You know, I smack myself around. Anyway, I'm sitting on my cat. It was crazy. And I used to take karate. So I start imitating the thing. All of a sudden my foot. You know, I hear it. And we all just stood there. You know, and my one friend's like, God, I didn't see nothing, man. We were just hanging out. It exploded. I didn't see nothing. And we're the only ones in the place. It's like a Tuesday night or something like that. How many times have you used that line before? I didn't see nothing. All I ever heard after that was like, and that thing cost me, how do you do it? It cost me a lot of money. Bring the nice things in here. Try to keep the place nice. Hey. It comes in here and he's smacking his face. I was wrecking a joint. I'm trying to make a respectable comedy clubbing. Yeah, but I tore the place up. I ate his chicken wings and I broke his window. And this was going back, like you said, Adam was just starting in comedy back then. But I knew him years ago, man. Yeah, yeah, the walk. There's the walk. That's how you walk. Another big walk. Big walk out on stage. How you doing there, pal? Sure. Another great visual for the radio audience. I'll have to put a little MPEG of it up on the website. It's pretty funny. Yeah, I knew Adam when he was still in high school. I knew Walt Whitman in Huntington and then you're selling water filtration systems trying to get me into that business. Oh, man, this is the best thing. You're going to love this. No money to start your own business, pal. It's like Ralph Crandon coming up to me. All you do is turn a wrench, Norton. And you're making millions. The next thing I know he's doing an open mic night at Eastside Comedy. They love him. And that was it. Do you remember the magician dude? The guy that his whole act was like a fake magician. He'd come out, he'd take like Superman, he'd go, stronger than a cat. He'd throw Superman against the floor. And then he'd try to do like real magic after like 20 minutes. I was like, no. No one wants the real magic. Oh, dummy. There are a couple of things you just don't want to see when you go to comedy club. And a magician I think is one of them. But he was funny. And female comics. This is an outrage. On Comedy Central tonight, comedy twats. Jim, we've talked about this many times on the show. Aunt and I will go to Caroline's and as soon as they go, please welcome Melissa, whatever, as soon as we hear the female name. Nothing. We're not going to take a leak. Let's order another round of beers. I really want to hear the PMS bit again. How my mom doesn't like the men I go out with. Let me tell you about the last guy I dated. You know I have nipple hair? I hate that. I can pluck them and it gets me between your thighs. I hate that. I'm having a problem keeping my weight off. Can't you have a notice? Okay, we'll laugh at your fat hips. Great. He's always one of your friends going, no, man, I totally do her. She had the best looking but there's something about her. I wouldn't mind just leaving a nice red mark on her forehead. Oh, come on. That's wrong. Dude, what? Come on. The worst person is sitting around and go to see, hey, it's Adam. Look at his funny walk. Adam Ferrara. We've already been through your funny walk and how you banged my sister. And we're following up the next with Hospitaliano. So we're trying to play Ope here and his family. Yeah, we're going to do a wiffle ball game. Play the wiffle ball game? Yeah. Which wiffle ball? The one I saw in the office. No, no, no. We need a new bat. We need a new bat. Yeah, that's where the buying fell off. If there are any ladies out there that want to set the wiffle ball bat record today, please give them an open invitation. Come on, we're almost there. Relax. Let me get the aluminum. Oh, that's cold. Once again, Adam's evil twin here in the studio, the goateed Adam. Wow. See, I'm trying to do that too. That's the first time I've seen you in years with facial hair. It took me years to get here. You've been growing it since high school. The voice just finished changing last week. Are you kidding me? How was Governor's last night? A wonderful experience was had by all. The room looks good now, don't it? Nice, yeah. Jimmy got the home loan approved. They brought him plants and everything. Oh, nice. I saw that. Yeah, he did it. Spursing up the joint. Because they got the stage now with the dressing rooms behind it so the comic doesn't have to walk through the crowd. Because I already traced. You used to have to do that, deliver drinks. Deliver some drinks on your way up. Jimmy the owner. Do me a favor, drop these off at table six before you come to the way up. This is Jesse Brassi's doing out in here before you. That escalator bit kills me. Hey, I've got to say, I ripped off the Minnivini impression from Adam. Adam does one of the best Minnivini impressions. I'm not really sure. I'm really not saying anything. I'm sorry. Feel these sidekicks. Get me a little ball back in the camera. When Adam was doing Gilligan's Island jokes. Don't start. We're starting already? I'm toying with a pal. You're just not even warming up. Just jumping around and running for it. You're all there, man. Come on. I'm doing White Castle making for it. Dude, I swear to God, one of my big toys. That's right. I'm having to close that there and go over there. So I get pulled over after eating some White Castles. And the cop goes, you've been eating White Castles? I said, no, man. So he said, you're going to have to fart into the balloon. I'm like, good night. You've had three cheeseburgers. You should be on the road. Good night. Follow that, Adam. Closing strong, man. I better open my Gilligan's Island material. We were all there, man. Oh, come on. Sure. Sure. They must have seen something, though, Adam. Why? Years ago when you did the open mic night. God knows it. Then all of a sudden they put some papers in front of you. You signed them and didn't see a dime until about two weeks ago. Let me tell you something. We all did that. Are you kidding me? Comics are nothing but little hookers. You realize that? Really? That's it? You come in and your wife, your family can say, don't sign this contract. You're signing your whole life away. But they said they'd never see the picture of Eddie Murphy. He knew him one time. And he said, I'll sign it. Yep. Now go on down and pay the price, you dumb little whore. You'll be playing in Texas this week. You're another crime to mine when I painfully skimp this back. So fuck you, pooper, that you'll hear your heartbeat. Oh, I'm sorry. Have I not paid you in six years? Take it, bitch. I've got to deal with Disney for $10 million to develop your faggot ass. What are you doing with that wiffle ball bot hanging out of your ass? I'm playing chuckle. Dude, I know, man. We were all there. I know what you're talking about, too. These managers are come to you. Any wannabe comics out there don't ever, ever, ever sign anything, period. It's like the Colonel. Sign here, Elvis. You know what happens, too? It's early in your careers where you're just starting to work it right. And there's probably no effing reason to sign anything at that point in your career because you're still working it, you're still trying to get recognition. You could book the goddamn clubs yourself. You get your little brother, yo, man, let me give you $10. Can you call this dude and just tell him? Call you and tell him, right. Call my agent, but don't call after six because his mother's making dinner. You know, that's what you need. But they wrap you up and there they are, pecking at 10% or 15% or 20% of your 20 bucks you're making that night, maybe. And I don't care. It's a fat business because they had a whole bunch of you guys. A stable. But I had, there was a crew of us, too, that were on the other side of the ocean. And you were on your side of the ocean and we'd constantly meet each other like, yo, man, are you getting... Yeah, me too, bro. You know that show that's on now? Dude, that was mean. And you wonder why I limp. Dude, we get hardcore rents. There's so many vultures in it. Behind the music is the whole story of everybody. They signed it all away. It happened to them. They sold platinum, triple platinum, and all of a sudden they saw two cents and he's driving his Buick LeSabre. And it was his own mother to say that. I'm like T-Boz from TLC or something. Let's die. I burn the house down. Then wonder why Martin's walking around the streets with a gun. From behind. He's trying to find his agent. He's bound to hit him eventually. But the funniest part is once you get to a certain point and we know each other and you're walking through with all the suits... Like I walked in on your last Fox pilot you had when I wanted to... I walked in to read for him and we're hugging. How you doing? They're all sitting there going, I guess they know each other. That's right. You came in and they go, they like you by the way. They're like, he's really, really nice. But the walk. The walk. Was he shocked? And we have sisters that we're concerned about. I didn't want to hear about that crap anymore. Cole, are you pulling that now? You're pulling that? That we can't talk about that? Alright. Let's go to the table. Play me some as is. No, I don't want to talk about it. Play some as is. We all had our little music careers early on. We were playing the clubs. Dude, we all want to be bad. I was just smart enough not to put anything on tape. Oh, I'm close to it. You know something? There's a few of those gigs that we did up in Poughkeepsie that I'm sure are on tape now. At the Rocking Horse Ranch? And let me say something. No matter how bad we were, your band opened for mine. That's right. So I don't want to hear it. What did Adam play? What did you play? I played guitar. Yeah, badly. Everyone was drunk. It didn't matter. The best part was the best trick. Anthony's brother is a great guitar player. And it was funny. Kid, you know what you've got to do? You turn your monitors way up, put your foot on it when you play the solos, because the vibration makes your balls hum. So at least you're getting something out of it. So then you don't care if you're sucking. And then Adam wakes up with a pig the next morning. What? What? What? What did I say? You know, we have a guest. Mr. Brewer's here. Oh, I know. Whatever you've got to do, Adam. I do have a lot of fun, man. I just needed a bit of a ride. All right, we've got to take a break. This is going to be a lot of fun today. Hell yeah. We've got Jim Brewer and of course Adam Farrar in the studio. Brewer, we're playing a stoner spelling beat today. Yeah. You want to do that? All right. We've got to get some of our listeners stoned again and try to spell words. It's funny. We'll do that in a little while. Also, we're doing another WOW sticker stop today, Anthony. Where is that? RC Edge Maximum Power Cola. If you want to get the WOW stickers, we're going to be at 69th Street Beer Distributor. Corner of 69th and Grand Avenue in Masbeth, Queens. Earl, Tony and the Invisible Man will be there at 4 o'clock. All right? Yeah. Come to Queens, get your WOW stickers. OP and Anthony, 1027-WNEW. Anthony, time out New York. Oh yeah.

Yeah. Simone from Jersey writes, Hey guys, I want to send an FU to my bitch boss. She told me the shirt I was wearing today was a little too revealing. Wow. She says I'm violating the dress code. I guess she's mad because I'm a 34D and she's a 34 board. Oh. Wow. That happens in the workplace. A little pissed off. She's a dancer. Yeah, right. She could get away with it there. In the strip club. All right. I think we're going to play stoner spelling bee in a little while. Yeah. After we riff with these guys a little more, Jim is like, Jim, are you on like crystal meth or something? Look at you. Repetually. I'll play. I'm up with the times hammer. Yeah. Nice head, Opie. You are nothing. Thank you. Thank you, Benadryl Boy. Don't you hate guys when they go, they go, hey man, what do you want? You go, I'm on natural high. Come here, dick. What is a natural high? Pop your snot. I'm high on the floor. I'm high on the floor. Pop your snot. I'm high on life. Nice head. Nice head. And I was paying for my drugs. All right. I saw Jim Brewer on Comic's Come Home a couple of weeks ago, and he was freaking historical. Yeah, that was a good one. Can you do some Joe Pesci for us? Do you get requests for Pesci like in bars and stuff? They come up, I tell you, man, they come up drunk. Hey, dude, I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. I'm going to go to the bar. Hey, dude, this is the guy, man. You're lying. This is the sheep. Dude, do it. Tell me you're the sheep. You know what the millionth of people are doing? You can't do a sheep now. Hey, what Pesci say? Oh, is that messed up? What's it like working in the bar? Oh, it's like a What's it like working with the black dudes? Is he like, he's crazy, right? Yeah, man. Yeah, it's all crazy. Yeah, do Pesci, faggot. You're a faggot, right? They say you're mad, but that's because you're a faggot. Anyone who tells Pesci is a faggot. But the second you say anything to him, all of a sudden you're the a-hole. Yeah, I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. I'm the faggot. Anyone who tells Pesci is a faggot. But the second you say anything to him, all of a sudden you're the a-hole. Oh. You know, the guy that, I met that guy and he bought an a-hole. Dude, you want to step up? You want to step up? Tell you what, dick. Okay? I play softball on Saturdays, Sundays. Dude, I'll wipe you out. I play center field, a-hole. Step outside. You want to play this week, show the manhood? You know, we used to like you. Okay, you're the a-hole. We had some guy at Sergeant Pepper's a couple weeks ago. A guy that was licking his finger while he was trying to sing on stage. What? Occasionally, I like getting together with my brother. This guy was out of his mind. Bill Brady, Joe Curry, an occasional bass player. And we do cover tunes. A couple of local bars on Long Island. It's a lot of fun. Nothing serious, just having a lot of fun. Some of the listeners came down and stuff. 99.99% of them, fine, great. Had a great time. There's always one mother-in-law. This guy just makes you leave the place. The second we walked in, he's like on me. Hey, dude, man. Take a picture with me, man. Which is fine. Starts off real good. Give me your hat. Give me your hat. Dude, I'll change you my hat. His hat looked like the hat Quint was wearing. Jaws. It could probably smell the same. Little Brownie who comes out of the cave. He had like three teeth in his head. And now I'm his pal for life. The whole time I'm there, I'm his pal. So we're playing. He gets up right next to me as I'm trying to sing. And tries to lick my ear. I'm like, dude, get the... Get the f away from me. That same guy came up to me. And he was just hammered. And his friend comes up to me and goes, Oh, watch out for that guy. When he drinks, he gets gay. Is there something? Is being gay when you drink? Wait, wait, wait. What are you drinking? Cosmopolitan. And then the same guy followed me out of the place. And he's like, huge fan, man. Huge fan. Just like Anne said, he goes, can I have your hat? I'm like, dude, it's my only hat. I love this hat. And I wouldn't give it to him, right? So he goes, you suck, man. I'm going to start listening to blood, shit. You're an ass. You should get cancer. I hope you get cancer. Oh, God. King of comedy. Oh, man. Talk to my brother. He's in the hospital with cancer. Jerry, please. No, I'm very busy. I'm on my way to the hospital. Jerry, please, just two words. I'm really busy. I got to go. I hope you get cancer. I hope you get cancer. Are you probably going bald, faggot? That's your problem, faggot. Faggot. Got a hair on your head. Where you from, freaking Suffolk? That's an insane ass hole. At least you don't have to take responsibility. Olive Garden food sucks. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot. Hello? It's the first one. Thank you. Mike, they put a new day going there. What's going on, Hope? We're trying to do two different things here at the same time. Hold on. It was the December one. All right, Mike, what's up? Mike, how much? I was at Sergeant Peppi's last week, a couple of weeks ago, and he said, that guy looks like Slots from The Goonies. He gets up in front of the microphone, and he's like, hey, man, do this, do that. It was all messed up in the head. And then the second you sort of go, look, dude, I'm doing a gig here. I'm trying to do something. I really need a couple of minutes over here. What an a-hole, man. You're such a geek. You know, the guy wouldn't say boo to me. I tell him what a big fan I am of the show, and he told me to F off. You know, that's how the story gets translated to his drunken pals and stuff. Next on News Channel 4, Anthony goes crazy. He goes postal on a huge fan. Yeah, man, that happens real quick. Yeah. You know, he tried to give me his hat, and I said no. I don't want your hat, man. I made the mistake of like, because right when I walked in, he was like, let me get you a beer, man. Like, oh, OK, cool. Gave me a beer, and that's it. It's just like a chick. What it is is that when fans, fans, when they're into you, it's just like when you used to go out in the bars, and you're the chick now. He buys you a drink, and I got to go home and do whatever the fuck I can. That's one tall guy. I got to spread him. What you drink, man? Help me paint my basement. Do Joe Pesci, balac a goat, and paint my basement. Bend over the table, I'm going to rail you. What's the problem? You ain't Long Island faggot. Oh, you drank my beer, though, didn't you? Yeah. You drank my beer. I see what you're all about, man. I know what I used to do to chicks. What a dick I am. I bought you a beer and suck it. Come on, the man's on the back. He's put on. Tracy Oldo does it. She just turned 18. What's the big deal? Whatever, dude. I bought her a drink, too. It wasn't even a beer. Charlie, I ain't paying for that. All right, Mr. Brewer, you want me to take the paint back? No, I'll find someone to help me. There's a guy that works with you, Anthony, in the band As If. As is? Yeah, they got it spelled wrong. Who? I don't know. Let's see if this goes anywhere. James, what's going on? Hey, James, man. James. Hey, Ann, what's up? Hey. Listen, me, Foot, and the Chief, we were like, why do you keep ripping on As Is since the... You, Foot, said it. Why not? Well, because it sucked. Yeah, of course. I understand. Well, we had a bad time back then. Of course. It was a lot of fun to a very bad music. Okay, good. Well, we agree on that. Well, we had a blast. We used to blow stuff up. Adam was real good at blowing stuff up. Yeah, pyrotechnics are always a plus. Yeah. We'd gather up some gunpowder from various locations, shove it in a pipe, and light it in front of drunks. The instructions were great. Anthony would rig up this stuff, and I'd have to blow it up, but the instructions were like, All right, wait till the last song, and wait till the owner pays us, then hit the button. Hit it. Hit it. Just make sure Joe Bok's face isn't over the pot. Oh my God. The pot's hot. Well, we did a backyard party one time, and it didn't go off. Yeah, sometimes there was some misfire. That was a scary moment. When you pushed the button, it wouldn't fire. It's like, okay, who's going to go over there again? That fire cracker, that M-80, that fuse just went down. All right, don't go near it, man. Get the... Send Nubby. He did it last year. So you go in there like the bomb squad with a pillow or something in front of you. You get really close, and the one mother's going, Get the hell away from there! What's wrong with you? But there'd always be one of the crazy bastards that would walk right up to pick it up. It ain't even lit, man. Look, there's still some fuse here. Let me pull it out a little more so there's an eighth of an inch. Now light it with a sparkler so I can't tell when it's lit. I'll throw it. I'll lose my hand. All right, James. All right, guys. Good luck. Tell everyone I said hi, man. Thank you. You got it. Later. Tom is claiming you never finished the Sears story last time. What? I think he did. That went way beyond... Yeah, that was like a Sears-Iraqi connection. Sure. He gave up on the show because that story took about an hour and ten minutes. He finally said, Screw it. That was hilarious. That was a hilarious story, though. I used to wear TZI Fridays, too. Get out. Were you the guy with the little badges on it? I wouldn't, you know, because they... Wow, what a rebel. You wouldn't wear the badges? I'm not wearing the badges, man. I wouldn't wear a hat. I wear the suspenders. Screw you, man. I'm my own person. I'm not wearing the flair. Oh, that's funny. Once I felt really degraded there, I felt like I had to get him back. So this is a true story. I'm leaving and this other guy, this is a big stoner, this guy Joe. Joe, if you're out there, man, dude, you've got to call him back and be up here. He comes out and he was... One day, I was just sitting out back and he goes, Dude, why can't we all just hang out in life? So he's one of these dudes. So we go out and we're leaving for the day. And the ice cream truck was delivering. And he's like, y'all, let's stay and go on the ice cream bins. I'm like, no, no, he quick grabbed the bin and I grabbed the bin. I shoved it in my car and drove home. But their ice cream bins are like huge garbage barrels. Full of ice cream. So I'm going home and Valley Stream like 20 minutes later, it's melted. And I can't shove it in any of my freezers. I went over to my sister's house and she's like, let me get some Tupperware. We had like 40 things to come wear ice cream. What a bunch of jackass. You must have been stoned. That's the only time you want to... I was like, really? I was like, why are you stealing ice cream? I'm making a statement again. Take that, TGI fries. Make me wear buttoned pockets. What is this? I leave it in my Judas Priest jacket. I'm coming back for the moose's head. Wild man. That is funny. Yeah, but they make you train for two weeks. For what? You have to learn like, oh man, it was so annoying. You've got to go with the TJ. And there's always one guy who's been out about seven years. He's going to tell you. I, Philadelphia, Len, and everyone in sales. Whatever, dick. Tell me about the citizen. Can you believe this guy? He's got 98 buttons. He's the 98 button guy. I got this one when I was camping in Alaska. It's like his whole life, man. I started out as a busboy. Nice head. This guy, man. The red stripes were my idea. So what the hell did they teach you? You've got to learn the menu. You have to take a test on the menu. A test? Yes, you have to take, hey, what's in a fajita? Fajita, guacamole, and chicken. And sometimes, oh man, steak. Very good, Mr. Brewer. Don't call me Mr. Brewer. God, you're a faggot. I'm 19, man. So I sat there. So my first, and you have to learn drinks. Like, I still don't know to this day. Certain drinks are called like. Blue Hawaiian? No, you can't call it like that. You've got to go. I'll have a high ball to the third power. That means they've got to use the blender. Oh, all colors. Oh, you've got to order the drinks in colors. Yes, you have to order the drinks, and you have to get the glasses. Right. And you have to get the. Now, I'm in line with these people. It's busy now. There's 50, there's six people in my whole area, but I'm stressing hard. Just bring your drinks. Only one mozzarella sticks. Nothing more stressful in the food service industry. Soup, bro. And all it took was one jacket to go, I'll have a blue nipple. I'll get my hair. Hold the ice and throw in some bourbon. Dude, screw me. I am humped hard. They're really, really serious people. And they're all like. I'll have a blue high ball to seventh power. Okay, next. I'll have a. What do I use? Get me in line, a-hole, until you learn how to call the drinks and yourself. Here's a thing to study. And that's what they used to make me do. And I go, someone take a table in my. I'm like, well, you should have learned when you passed the test, maybe if you didn't. Oh, they suck. Needless to say, I lasted like two weeks after I stole the ice cream. Like, I'm out here throwing in jail for the ice cream. That's like high pressure, though, the food service industry. Because around lunchtime and dinner time, it never stops. And you can't just. I like a job where at any given moment, if you're pissed off or something, you just sit down. Take a breath. But what are you going to do? There's people screaming for stuff. Oh, it's disgusting. I know you're hungry. I need to chill. You guys are really pissing me off, man. My girlfriend's all annoyed. I got to learn these baggy tricks. I don't know. I just make it. Jerk, you know what I want? Full CP3 power. Everybody's getting the fish. It should be like an airplane. You get two choices. Why would you go TGI Fridays and order anything but like a fajita or a burger? Right, right. I'll have the sea bass. Well, then you're an ape. There's a great wrong seafood place up the road. A trash night out. All right. You're all decked out to get some sea bass. You idiot. There's a nice seafood restaurant you can go to. There's so many people checking in that worked at Fridays. Yeah, I'm sorry, guys. No, I'm not, man. Well, let's see what they're going to say here. Scott, what's going on? What's up? I used to work at TGI Fridays. What a pain in the ass place to work. Was it? You had to take 20 packs to make a burger. Yes. Tests. Tests. Tests. How many tests? You had to pass the bar test. I had to run around the building in the first two weeks and sing Back to the House. What? Because there were some people with the servers in the bar center, the people that were cooking. It was totally ridiculous. Happy birthday to you. Come on. You had to do that? No. Did you have to do that? Tell me you failed that test. I definitely had to learn, but they hated me. Happy birthday to you. Oh, no. I was there, just going, and looking around the other room. Look at the breast on that horse. It's so cute. Never mind, I'll get her rolls. Play on the burger. Have some rolls anyways. Who are you? Around here? Professor Pequod? They were all at the other table. Happy birthday. I always disappear. I'm making some ice cream, man. You're the guy in the back of the crowd. That always just looks like the most degrading thing. Why would you have your employees do that? Does anyone really enjoy that when they're sitting down? Because it's never the person's birthday that's having the birthday's idea to have that done. It's like, when they go to the bathroom, they'll call the waiter over and say it's their birthday. They'll send over the little cupcake with the candle, and the whole cast of a-holes will come out and say, Happy birthday to you. And the guy sits there going, you bunch of motherfuckers. Now I've got to sit here like an idiot. My favorite is the guy from the kitchen with the accent, Happy Buffet to you. Happy Buffet. I like it. I make it. I make it with my feet. That's to me, especially when you get the guys and girls in there, they just want to do a job, get their money, get the hell out of there. I think it's equal to a secretary in an office and the boss going, Hey, why don't you hike that skirt up a little bit, honey? I think it's just as degrading. They're there to serve food and do that, and they've got to sing goofy songs to people. However, it is hilarious when you're a hammer and you bring like that one guy who knows he'll go to blows. These bananas come off. You know you're done like this. They're gathering with the balloons over there. Cool. I believe you don't see them. All right, Jakes, who did this? Oh, man, I did. Happy birthday to you. He's just sitting here like, I'm going to bust you. I'm going to kill you. Is it funny? Go away, please. Blow out the candle. There was that one place that they take out the moose, a big moose. That was up in Boston. And you had to kiss the moose. Kiss the moose on your birthday. What? I think it was like the outback or something like that. And it's like, now kiss the moose. Like, I'm going to stick my stuff in the moose's face. And if you don't pull that goddamn thing away from me, I'm going to get a moose job. That's when you're drunk, friend. Remember this old one? Remember when you pull out your little kisser? Pull out your pocket. You want to kiss a bunny? Who wants to touch the elephant's trunk? Touch the elephant's trunk. Pull your pocket. Yeah, you stick them out. You ever kiss a bunny? No. Well, here you go. You pull your... What an end. Jim, Jim, John from Amityville. Oh, man. John from Amityville writes... Who did that? No, I totally did that. I think I did that on stage. You only kissed the bunny rabbit? Kiss it. Good night, Fall Out Adam. See you later. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. John from Amityville writes... I used to work at Master Peak with Fridays. Ask Jim to sizzle one of the meals. Sizzle one of the meals. Is that a code word for Fridays? Yeah, I don't really remember. You're talking AT in my mind. This is some scary... Okay, good. I was coming down from Mescaline from the ACDC concert. I was in dark places. Did you say ACDC? He's off. Brewer played air guitar. He was in the fourth row. Right after In V Mountstein. Yeah. In V. Yeah. Great guitarist. Well, yeah. Come on. I want you to play guitar. I need some words. I'm going to see Yin-Bei. When the cannons are coming up. Yeah, yeah. Go, man. You can high-five. Got it, bro. You're gonna... Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Hey, you don't have to know the words, which is a great thing. I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a We are the deers We're giving everything I need I got three minutes in me I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a We fucked out the air, hit a fucking bus, like, Yo Ralphie, you gotta fight, dude! Gotta fight with a black dude, that was crazy, you shoulda done your drinking. And we were like, he's like, yo, my people are in a dangerous, dangerous, like those cops, who's totally cool, and shoulda done it, but he took them out, man. We didn't back him up, we felt like dicks, we were like, Yo, chill out, he's like, no man, this is the one thing, like, no, no, no, it was a good call, you missed it, you missed it. BAAAH! Oh my God, oh man, man. Man, yeah, good boy, concert's still on. A little different back then, because you didn't even have to bring anything, you just sat down, and a big joint would just get handed to you, by this guy next to you, the wine sack, Hey dude, I got the wine sack, so it's a little into your mouth. And even before that, you had the beach balls? Yeah, yeah. Look at that, dick, oh dude, I just missed it, I just missed it. I was just close to the beach ball, man. Oh, did you touch it? Dick, go on, go on, touch it. Here it comes again, here it comes again. Oh, that's a good shell, man, my face, dick. You want something, that's all, bring it on, bring it on. And who is insane enough to go to like a Charlie Daniels or Molly Hatchett concert around the Fourth of July? Oh, you knew M-80s were flying from the top rows, onto the floor. Look, dude, I'm going to throw it, don't worry, I'm going to throw it in the air so it blows up above the crowd. I got it timed out. Yeah, because these fuses are so accurate, there's some rang in China that's just going, He's shoving gunpowder in this little wax tube. He doesn't know, if you think it burns in two seconds, it can burn in 20 minutes. And they're lobbing them over the crowd. It's okay, it blows up in the air. The guy that would have the Roman candles at the end of the night. Roman candles. Where's the picture of the dog? You pussies don't know what it's like now. What, you think laser pointers are bad? So what, you got a little red dot on your head? Get it on, how about a frigging blockbuster going off a foot above your head? I can't believe in like a fog hat contest with the shock syndrome. Frigging shell shock. You're right, man. I went to my first contest, Coliseum Judas Priest. Oh, God. With Iron Maiden and like my city of Maggie. One, two, three, four. Five, six, seven, eight. Who was the guy on, oh, Eddie was the guy on the cover. It's Glutton Eddie. Eddie. It's Eddie. You're in the toilet. We're missing Eddie, man. You're not out. What do you think you're going, son? Eddie. It's Eddie. One, two, three, four. The pal that would always like, dude, I'm Bolton because I'm getting up front. And there's security at every stairway. He's trying to talk his way back. Oh, there he is. Need to hear just a bit of this. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Where is it? Here we go. Yeah, now it's rocking. Right to theitz analyses and one to theZ Libya. Redан?? Come on, pay a stomachful of ivory. The answer is no. Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

Yeah. Seriously, do the guitar, dude. Let's do that. Alright, yeah. Main's better, whatever. Oh! Oh! Yeah. Main's better, whatever. Oh! Oh, that was horrible. I gotta... can you fast forward to that ending where you go... That's near the end, right? Yeah. Oh god, you're killing me. We're gonna get your Ronnie James Dio away. My favorite part, I think I rewind it a thousand times and my dad would walk in on me. What the hell is that noise? I'm at my headphones and I'm going... Scream! Hey, bro. That's not even plugged in, you're just... Just losing it. Just sweating. Yeah. This was before he was gay. That was before you knew he was gay. When you walk the spikes on Rockaway Avenue... Oh yeah. ...some shop on Rockaway Avenue, Valley Street. To the spikes, yeah. I used to walk to Green Acres, check out my spikes! Shake this down. Here we go. Here it is. Scream! Scream! I'm a man! Bravo. You little cavern, man. Wow. Me and my nubba white friends, we used to imitate this... Because if you remember, this concert was shown on MTV a bunch of times in the beginning. Yeah. And this was the first real concert thing they ever had. Remember that or not? Yeah, no, hell yeah. I was an MTV addict. Yeah, and they had Judas Priest in concert at, like, I don't know, Atlanta. I'm sorry, I remember. It's like, this is the green monolies here with the tape. Bam, bam, bam! No, man! These holey are the band of the 80s. Oh, wow. Yeah, man. Whew, she just took me back.

I'm going to be a good boy. I'm going to be a good boy. You know his family? You realize it's not a joke. He's just reciting verbatim things that happen in his house. My mother actually asked my father, Joe, how come you felt angry? It helps to hold down the rage. I swear to God. Now you know my father. I'm kidding. Sure. Ma, pass me a pen. I need that line. Hey, your TGIF friend's on the line, Jim. Joe, you yelled out to Joe before? No way. Yeah, let's put him on real fast. He seems really him. Joe. Hey. Hey. Who's this? It's everybody. Hey, O.P. and Anthony. What's up, man? And Brewer, of course. Jim! Is that you, Joe? You want? This is him. You know what I still have? I was taking a look through the other day. This guy's the craziest bastard. I got a photograph of you when you were doing Moses on stage. Oh my God. And you're sitting in the front row. He's talking about in high school. We had to do sketch night, whatever. And one of our friends was like, oh, you got to do the sketching. Being nowhere, and I was like, no, no, no, no. And me and this guy, Joe, we were just jackasses. We were sitting in class. What a show. You're like, wah. And that was our thing. Today in math. Wah. He's doing that, Joe. Do you remember taking a big spit? Joe, on the line, he peed outside of like a car. He was like, oh, I'm going to die. Joe, on the line, he peed outside of like the second floor boys' bathroom. Hey, Tim, you remember that social studies test we threw out, the third floor window? No. Listen, Jim, no joke, guys. Jim is as nuts. Oh, man. I don't doubt that. Yeah, we don't doubt that. Joe is just driving around. I remember when I was driving up on Valley Street, and Joe pulls out this big looking thing. I don't know what it is. He goes, check this out. It was like a very powerful spotlight. We drove around the spotlight. Just for the hell of it. It's true, man. We used to sit in the bathroom trying to make each other throw up. We'd be jingling our fingers down our throats, laughing our asses off. Why the hell did you get your punch? We were bored. We would do nothing but make each other throw up. Hey, Hans, man, you're a good guy. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something.

I'm going to tell you something. And of course we took the best possible picture of your... We can't feel it. It's a cheap camera. So we went into the bathroom. I drop my drawers. He takes a picture of my hand. And he puts it back in. He's spreading it out. Like a cat. Like a week later, my friend Scott comes up to us. He goes, you'll never believe it. The weirdest thing happened. My mother's sitting there looking at this picture. And her face turns white. She looks at it, this big hairy rear end. So me and Joe, we fell on a poor ramp. We're like, yeah, isn't that funny? I'm like, yeah, you don't know how funny it is. Dude, I'm not lying. We is the last. Remember we finally drove that one poor teacher. She turned around. She went, shut up. And I found her on the ramp at the top of my lungs. And it took us about five seconds. It was silence. And then... That was at the time we used to listen at Cheech and Chong house. That Cheech and Chong album. Yeah, we all did. We grew up on that album. Yeah, I exploded laughing. We both got thrown out. And that poor lady, she turns around to where she goes. You're going to have to stay for detention. But I don't believe in suspension. We both looked at each other like, oh, my God, this poor lady. I don't believe in suspension. I believe you should come here three. And we come in every day three. Listen, we're really sorry. And it's just we don't know why we do it. It's just two really idiots who totally apologize for our actions. The next day she would be up there. We take entire pieces of paper and shove it in her mouth and wait until the end of class and just whip it across and it hit the blackboard. And it would make like a 20-inch diameter spit. Now this is so childish. So childish. We were a little off the wall. Oh, wow. Yeah, but we had a lot of fun. The one thing that blows my mind to this day, Jim, how did we pass that class? How did you? Because she had a heart. That's right. Yeah, I think she passed the class. She didn't want you to get left behind. She quit that year, too. We did literally for three quarters of the year. We did nothing but sit, laugh, throw spitballs. Bust on Dina's head. Whatever, Dina, nice face. How ugly can you be? What did you want to be again? She wanted to be Madonna. Yeah, right. She wanted to be a fashion consultant or something like that. And we just sat and laughed at her. Oh, no. She's a horror. She's probably a crack whore now. Yeah, right. I am pretty ugly. I'm a bad guy. I'm not even good. You destroyed her. Those memories are probably still in her head. It's not a sock on my head. Whatever. Yeah, right. It's a fashion symbol. Remember Hickey Hirsch? Weren't you in my class with Hickey Hirsch? Oh, yeah, Hickey Hirsch. Well, Hickey Hirsch, well, he had this big red spot on him. You know, he'd come in here. Draw attention right to it. Like kids can do. Steve, I forgot. Oh, Steve R. He sat in the back row. And Hickey Hirsch is checking out, what does it say? Cousin Strawberry. Oh, okay. Thanks, Hickey Hirsch. Strawberry, Nick. Anyway, Hickey Hirsch came in. He had a crazy hairdo. Poor guy had nothing going on. Ruthless. Him, it was the Twitch guy. I think every skull has one. And if you piss him off, you're like, yeah, whatever. Keep your head still. You sure you didn't go to Harborfield's high school? I remember all these characters. Yeah, everyone had the Twitch guy. This is how immature and retarded we were. Hickey Hirsch is checking homework. And as he's just about to get to me, remember Steve R.? I won't say his last name. But he reached out with his finger and he's pretending he's taking a shit. And he's going, and this is when Hickey Hirsch turns around and he goes, well, did you get any? Oh, he laughed. He had two reeks. And then we see Steve, we just look at him, and we're like, that's when our finger goes, did you get any, Steve? Very. You got caught, Dick. Oh, my God. That's why you don't confess you're a dick, because you get caught. Wow. I'll never forget, I'm going to the bathroom and I'm on a urinal. And I turn around and there's Joe and he's up on the ledge. Hickey, what are you doing? And he goes, well, you got everyone waiting to come into lunch. Joe, what are you doing? They're all looking up. He went, in back of Valley Street Central, there's this little lake with all the real tiny frogs. I don't know if they get bigger, but they're only the size of the top of your pinky. And he and this other dude, I'm not lying, would get like bundles of bundles of these frogs. And then the bell would ring and they'd shove them right by the door, so you'd have to step on them. Oh, no. And everyone knew who it was. Those are the guys that you used to, if you didn't have the balls to do something but you had the materials, you would give it to them. Oh, yes. Like if you came in with a 10 ounce or 12 ounce bottle rocket and you didn't want to set it off, you knew who to go to to set it off right down the hallway. The lunatics, the ones that would flush the blockbuster down the toilet. Distinct bomb guy, the guy that was being brought out by the police. So that guy was no fun than being dragged out by the police. Or brought out, I remember one kid, in a wheelchair because he was so effed up. Like he went under the bleachers and was drinking and he was so effed up in class that the ambulance came with a wheelchair and the sight of him just rolling out the front door of John Glenn in a wheelchair. And that never leaves you. Like if I saw him tomorrow I would go, oh, it's the wheelchair dude. It's the drunk wheelchair guy. No, that's our congressman. He could be now but it doesn't matter. He's a drunk wheelchair guy. There was one guy, slow in our class, I think it was county or something like that. And I always felt, I always had, you know, when a kid was a little off, it always really pissed me off when everyone was making fun of him. Making fun of him. That's the only place where I'd feel him come like, yeah. Even you had a lot. Yeah, like, come on. And they'd call him like Roy Zero. So one day they talked him out. They're like, Roy, you want to be cool? Jump out the window. Sure, he goes to the bed. It was only on the first floor. You know, it would be cool. And he opens up the window and the count is sitting out, Roy, you jump out that window, Roy. Roy, don't jump, Roy. If you want to be cool, jump out. We won't call you that anymore. Sure enough, out the window he goes. Terrible. Jim, admit it, you're right. Enough, honey. Ow. Jesus Christ, man. Drew, you want to buy some candy? No, I don't. Ow. Allison. How are you doing? Great, we're having fun today. This is the funniest ass I've ever heard in my life. I feel like I'm living through high school again. Everyone went through it. I used to cough the foot of the pantyhose, like right at the thigh, and wear that in my hand. I was a Madonna wannabe. Yeah, Madonna big. It was the patron sustainable slut in high school. All right, were you a slut? No. You just wanted to look like one. No, I wanted to look like one. Yeah, now I am, but back then... All right. All right. Take care, guys. Thank you, Allison. Yeah, we had a gym teacher named Gil Lilienthal. Gil Lilienthal, big guy, huge, big fat guy. And the story was he was on the Denver Broncos... Yeah, we all had him in the house. ...until the tragic leg injury reduced him to a high school gym teacher, and he has the bitterness to prove it. Yeah, he played two games. Yeah, the guy was like breaking records and stuff, and then all of a sudden the hamstring went. Dude, he's pissed. That is so funny. We had a teacher the same thing. Dude, he had a tryout with the New Jersey Nets, man. Yeah. And he f'ed up his knee. And that was huge. Yeah. Please. All right, kids, I'm going to take out all my hostilities on your sorry little asses. Punch jumps for no apparent reason. Our gym teacher never made it to that point. He gave us like the birds and the bees talk, the hell talk. Oh, yeah, that one, yeah. Because he had to. The guys were climbing the ropes. Come down, Billy. You're not going to knock yet. You know, like this duck girl. He had like scotch on his breath. Like, man, I know you've been experiencing some urges. Ignore him. Because if you don't, you'll knock up a cheerleader and then you'll have to marry her and become a frigging gym teacher. Yeah, this big guy was, he would get so pissed off. If you were smoking, he would give you a choice. You could either go to the principal or he will punch you once. He would drag you in and punch you in the stomach. Really? He would punch you. You have a choice. You go to the principal. Here, put on this mask. It looks like my wife and I'll punch you in the stomach. I'll punch you in the stomach. You'll bite my leg. I was a Denver Bronco. And then he was like so pissed off. And then the rumor was, I don't know what the true story is. It might be true. It might not. I don't even know. Is that he hit some kid with a pipe and then he disappeared. He was gone. It was just one day, Gil was gone. Gil was gone. And the story was, dude, he caught Tommy Slater. Tommy Slater smoking and took a lead pipe and smacked him over the head with it. But what made him do that, dude, was when Tommy said, F. What a pisser, man. I remember that. We had a fat guy. I think he passed away. But he used to call everyone banana. Hey, banana. We had whatever known as, hey, you're a banana. Come out there and play with me. They're wacky little names for you. We had a music teacher that had such bad dandruff. It was like all of like snow drifts on his shoulders. And he would come in and if we were too rambunctious during bugle class, he'd be like, Addie's disease. That was like his big catchphrase. Addie's disease. Every day he would use it like it was the first day he ever said it. And he thought it was the funniest damn thing. They're rambunctious acting up. Addie's disease. You're beating the bat going, yeah, whatever, dick. Dandruff head, dick. He's going to say Addie's. Addie's disease. Hey, Chris, what's going on? Hey, I got a question for Adam. You went to Whitman, right? Yeah. You remember the two dyke-y ones, Rabidu and Hoenrath? The two dyke-y ones. Rabidu and Hoenrath. What year did you graduate? 1978. Dyke-y female gym teacher at Dunton. No, I graduated in 1984. They were gone, I guess. I guess they left together. Maybe. I was dating a Zuzai chick and she said, Those are guys, man. Well, female gym teachers, come on. That's another one. All right, girls, we're going to do the balance beam. I'm going to spot you from beneath the beam. It's pantyless and you'll be wearing skirts today. There's nothing wrong with field hockey. All right, we should take a break. Oh, look at the time. I've got to go. Where are you going? Wow, look at you. What do you got? I've got to get out there. What are you, high? I've got to get to Jersey, man. Where are you going? Everyone's going to... Man, I've got to get away on Jersey. It sucks with traffic. I thought you were in the traffic. Not anymore, man. Oh, forget it. You can't get anywhere in this. I have a flight next week. I'm late already. I can't get anywhere. You can't go anywhere, man. The last time I was here, I left here. I think I got home about 9.30. It's one of the hardest lives. I got maybe two miles from the Lincoln Tunnel. I moved about 20 feet. I'm like, go, Aston! Now the Aston's coming! Aston here again! This place, Aston, sucks! Honey, I'm really sorry, but why didn't you leave early? I don't know! All right, I was having a good time. Gosh! I'm stopping to get something to eat, then I'm leaving. All right, well, that's what I told you. We couldn't even get across the map. Let's just get something to eat, man. All right, let's go. Go ahead, get some meat. Adam Farrar at Governor's all weekend long. Oh, God, how much fun was this? Long Island! Adam, I'm going tomorrow night. Not tonight, so put me down. Whenever you want to come. Tomorrow night. Cool. Tomorrow night. What's that? Two and Sunday, too? No, I'm not doing Sunday. Friday, Saturday. We'll do the early show on Saturday. Go, man! Go, man! All right, but we're not turning the heat on. Come on out. Come on out. They opened up a new one in Medford. Did they really? There's one out east now. Does he still have the bar? I didn't because I came in late. Right. Is it the bar area? Yeah, the front, right, when you walk in. The front bar area? That's the place to hang. Yeah, that's where you hang out. That's where you fire you back. That's it. You watch all the girls in the Tri-County Flee Market parking lot. You see those guys? Hubba hubba. All those guys at the Budis Priest Concert are now in the Tri-County Flee Market. That's right. They're in the parking lot. You guys going by in Godzilla? Yeah. She's with me, man. Her name's on the side of my Camaro. Stop looking at her. You understand me? No, no, no, no, no. This is my bowling alley. I'll spray paint what your girlfriend's name. Sharon, what's your name? Joe? Joe and Sharon. I'll put two hearts on the little... T-shirt. I'll put a license plate on the... I'll put a license plate on the... With the chains because nobody can break that relationship. I have six dollars. The airbrush T-shirt. I'll put a license plate on the... I'll put a license plate on the... I'll put a license plate on the... That's when all your friends go, dick. Could you write, filthy whore, sea sucker, and put that in a heart, please? That's so long. They re-ran something. Did you get a Louis Anderson show? No. Remember that thing we did? Yeah, yeah, turning tragedy into comedy. Louis Anderson, my father used to hit me with a whiskey bottle. Fat and everything. I was like, what the fuck? I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Louis Anderson, my father used to hit me with a whiskey bottle. Fat and everything. Now there's this implication that I might be gay, but who would think a big fat guy with overbearing mother, enabling mother, and an abusive father would end up sucking the big piece of man meat? Louis, and people are always emailing us and saying, do you see Adam hugging Louis? And we're like, of course we do. And I'm like, oh my God, we can't even have a son. And we're like, well, we can't even have a daughter. And we're like, well, we can't even have a daughter. And we're like, oh my God, we can't even have a daughter. And we're like, oh my God, we can't even have a son. And we're like, well, we can't even have a son. father and the abusive father would end up sucking the big piece of man meat. People always email us and say, �Did you see Adam hugging Louis on that special Comedy Central thing?� He went up on the iPad. �You're just his type, a guy.� I swing both ways, boys and men. What did you say? We did some show about the... Me and Chapelle at some theater in Glenmail. I still had that Jeff Connell taxi hair. Wait, wait, wait. Remember that long island hair? Sure. That's what you can see. You go, �Dude, I left Long Island too and I cut the hair.� Did I say that? You said it to me. I first called you a dick and then I laughed for a week. Then went right to the baller. He's such a dick, but he's right. That's a great line. Well, now owners have got to keep each other sane. If you stay there, you'll get sucked in. You're out of the same mold. You do get nuts. There are some parts of Long Island that are like those black holes. You never leave. You can't get out. What's the strip bar? There was a brass monkey. There was a club personal touch. The carousel. Tender trap. It moved. It did? Yeah, it's not a jerk anymore. The brass monkey is pretty far out there. I remember that years and years and years. But there was like two girls. Yeah. One was a big Latino woman. Yeah, a big Latino biker woman. A biker 40 and blonde with a scar. Have you ever gone to Bird's Place in Ron Conkoma? No. That was one place. There was bikers all over the place. If you looked at the chick wrong, they would wrap your head in. You would just sit there with your dollar in your hands. Please don't look at me. My friend took his dollar and he'd lick it and put it on his forehead. Don't you use your breasts to take it off. This is the way to get your dollars worth. Come here. What's your name? Cheryl? Come here, Cheryl. Do you like baseball? Do you want to go bowling out today, Cheryl? I swear to God. I swear to God. It was one night and he came. I can see the scar. We were the legends there. Me and my friend Phil, we already backed away. I think it was my bachelor party and we were always like, because you got the bouncer guys, they're all staring at you. I can't even lift his head up. And you already did the dollar thing on the chick before that. I'm an Argentinian. She comes out and he goes, hey, what's the most foul, erotic, disgusting sexual thing you could do for me for a dollar? I swear to God. And she smacked him. Well, they would always, guys would come up to you with all these stories. Anytime you go to the strip club, especially on the Long Island, you'd sit there, the girls would dance, you'd toss them a box. Occasionally they'd put little matches on their nips and light them up. That's a great trick. That cost you five. Your friend would always tell you this story. No, dude, I know this place where the chicks pick up caddies with their snacks. It's like, great, man. And you go there and it's the same thing. I've never seen it. She's shooting eggs out at the bouncers and I'm catching them in Martini glasses. They're handing out winning lotto tickets and giving everybody BJs. They quip them right out. Slicing each lead second. And then when you get there, what do you get? An $8 warm bud that you nurse for three hours. Because the new chick just came in the door. I can't leave. You're just ready to leave. You nurse that one bud. It's just like spit at the bottom of your glass. You're like, well, four hours. I've got to go. Oh, look who just walked in the door. I'll give the new girl a shot. She smells like soap. She's clean. And then there might be the chick that just walked in or the one that's tending bar. There's a perfectly good naked chick up there. But you're looking at the one girl going, I wish she'd take her clothes off. You're looking at the girl that's dressed. You're never satisfied with that. Never satisfied. We conquered that one. You lose that one friend in like 10 minutes, comes back, Yo, man, let me get 20. She's really, really into me. I know I say that every time. This chick's really into me. The bachelor parties are the worst, man, because they were trying to get the bachelor to do something. Come on, man, look at the way she's looking at it. You've got to go with her for the guys. She likes you for you. It's not the fact we gave her $200. She likes you as a person. Nothing's better than watching her dance, too. And then she'll start dancing to a song and just stop. Cover up, because now she's modest. Stacy, could you reject this one? Reject it. Reject. Pretend you didn't see my ass yet. Yeah, then they cover up. They're all shy. Like the music stops for some reason. Then it's back on again and it's poll time. And you've got to tell Jim about the rug act. Yeah, a dying heart. I swear to God. They don't do this anymore. Yeah, out on Long Island, you go to the Tender Trap or any of the numerous clubs out there, you would get the rug act. They put on a slow song, take the quilt off of their bed that they've had since the ninth grade. We've got tonight. Who needs tomorrow? We've got tonight. Who needs tomorrow? Let's make it land. And there she is, just doing the rug act. She's laying down now on the floor. Just spread eagle right in front of you. And that was the rug act. And you don't see it anymore. And then you roll over on the stomach. We've got tonight. But then you're just like, oh, the love tune. With the lotion. Then the lotion comes out. She's like doing things, arching the back. Push it right at you. And the best thing was to get next to the guy that was spending all the money. Because you're honing in on his view. Yeah, we used to call that the pilot fish. There was the shark and then the little pilot fish. The pilot fish. They would swim alongside. Come on over, Anthony's pilot fish. Here you go over there. Scavenger. Yeah. Oh, here it is, yeah. She'd take her little blank. Oh, look at her. And she's pointing that thing right at me. She likes me. That's a comfort. There's one angry guy at the bar. I know you're going to pay attention. That's okay. And then there's the regulars in there. There's the guy in the suit. He just came from work. The old guy. Yeah. The old guy. I know her. She ain't nothing. The one black guy in the whole white bar. Yeah. With the white chicks and everything. And the naive guy who will just keep pumping bucks out thinking he's going to get lucky. I tried it last week, man. She doesn't, whatever. And then she'd do all those moves that she thinks are dancing, you know, like rolling around and getting the little leg shuffle thing. Yeah, though. Yeah, yeah. Her feet are stuck on. Yeah, why is she doing that? Interesting. I showed her last week. That one. And then all of a sudden they're on their side. They're on their side. That's the split. They try to point their legs so that the little fat on their ass doesn't show. They point the leg and almost everything else. Yeah. Show me some meat cartons. You got to cut his cheese on your ass. What's that, a golf ball? Hey, I paid to get in here. So what's your problem? Get your hands off. I'm drinking. I'm drinking. Do I have a beer? Yes. They would do that every two seconds. You want a beer? You want a beer? You want a beer? Oh my God, I just drank this one ounce of beer that I spent $8.00. $1400. Oh, wow. Buy me a drink. Oh, yeah. If you want to impress me, why did you tap dance? No, that's dancing. All right, do that, high heel whore. Can you fart dance? You do it all the time. Why don't you stay in traffic? Yo, your nipples are crooked. Looks like gravy stains. All right, what are we doing? We want to get Adam out of here? Yeah. All right, champ. Rue, are you leaving us too? I'll hang out for a little bit. You get sucked in. You didn't even try. I was listening. You didn't even click. What was that? Adam left. Adam had no problem leaving. You sit there and you're like, can I stay? We've got to get some pot smokers online. They will play some stone or spelling games. Rue, that was the day I knew we all bonded because you stopped by for a quick five minute visit and you were here for three hours. That's what I said, you know, I think the guy likes us in the show. It's the whole Long Island thing. I remember you pounding. You know, we're all from the same frigging mall. We all did the same things in different towns. But we made it out. All right. Yeah, somehow. Oh, man. Huntington 88, I was there. Hope you're still there. Not real. Come on, man. Come on. I'm standing upstairs. I'm standing outside. Do I still have to do it? Landlords get like the tube top. Six feet of nipples are hanging out. You're the last in line. Dang dang. Ding ding ding ding ding ding. That's Anselt Cog. He moved out. Well, it's been a while. Four or five months. And asked never to return. Come on, man. I like how you do that. And these two radio hosts. Wait, where's the, remember the once you. Every Long Island once checks out Amityville House. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That was a big event. You just stand there. You feel it? Dude, I totally believe it. Look at those windows are evil, man. They're like little pie shaped things. One time. Dude, I see an eye, man. You know, everyone, when you drive by the Amityville Hottel House, everyone thinks they see something. We drove by at night after playing Amityville High School in basketball. Yeah, that's exactly. It's a little. Oh, my God, dude. Something moved in the top. Where's that? Ocean Avenue, I think, down there? Somewhere, yeah. They've changed the house, though. It's not the same. It doesn't look like the movie. It doesn't look like the movie. Yeah, those two windows that look like eyes. They're now like one window. That was the whole house. Who would remodel the goddamn Amityville Hottel? Here's where we used to keep the spirits. All right, listen, we've got to take a break. We're so freaking late now. Adam, thank you for stopping by. Good seeing you, bro. Look at them hugging. Adam, playing governors. Don't miss the shows.

Yeah, we've got to get our ulti-checking. We're doing a wow sticker stop. They're like walking in the van. They won't come out. Why? There's like a crowd of people around the van. People are banging on the van. I think Earl's inside. There's a lot of people there. Yeah, there's tons of people. All right, cool. Earl's checking in. We're going to talk to him next. All right.

Where did you get that phone, Earl? I got it from an e-book. You know, someone get to him. We need a phone. Why are we sending him out day after day with that same piece of crap phone? Un-effing-believable. I'm going to bring down my buzz I'm getting from hanging out with my pals. I know. All right. Well, anyway, they're doing it at the 69th Street beer distributor. Go say hi and grab a wow sticker. Corner of 69th and Gretton Avenue and Masbeth, Queens. They'll be there for a while. All right. You've got time to get down there. Looks like they're throwing a little party, all right? Cool. All right, man. We'll be back with more Jim Brewer in just a bit. Stay there. Opie, you scum. And Anthony. Your new name is Dick. Opie and Anthony. What changed you into such a demonic little bastard? You sick-ass. W-A-W. We are hanging with Jim Brewer today. I'm laughing so hard I got to swim. I know. We're going to trip down all of our demented memory lanes, isn't it? Yeah. Anthony, it's FU Friday. We want to read one here. It's from Jersey. Yeah. A big FU goes out to my period. Whoa. Cool. This is pretty funny. She goes, it's been almost two years since I had sex. I meet a great guy a few weeks ago, and he's taking me to a place in the Poconos this weekend. Ah, you're going to get in the champagne glass? Why do you have a mirror on top? I plan to F my brains out all weekend and I got my period. Yeah, you're not going there like as a business trip or something. It's been two years for me, and that's all right, man. It's meant to get through it. It's been two years? It was two years? We've all been there, too. We've all been there, too. It's like, well, how bad is it? Is it like first day or second day? Is it like near the end? Well, yeah, I don't know. I'm just going to try it. I'm going to try it and see. I just checked and there's barely anything there. Wow! It's Friday. It's like, all right, let's go. Well, I've got to go to the bathroom first. Oh, boy. I told you so. Sorry. Wait a minute. It was her that went two years without sex? Yeah. Wow. She's got the period and she's going to the Poconos. And he's taking her to the Poconos? That's like... Poconos. It's like, okay, we're going to have sex. Where's the spontaneity here? They're going to the Poconos, one of those rooms with the heart-shaped bed and the champagne glass with the bubbles. I got the best room. And the pool. It's just the F Hotel. Yeah, why else would you go there? Why would you go there? The $110 suite. We're just going to hang out? What are you going to do? I have. And they haven't yet? That's kind of an odd first place to screw. But that's the night when, you know, if he is really taking her there, that's going to be a defining moment in the relationship. She's either going to go buck wild or, you know... But he's got to deal with the whole red tide thing. That's what I'm saying. It could be a big defining moment for them. I say he goes for it. We've all done that, right? Why not? Why? We've all done that. You know, you don't want it at peak tide. Wow, we're getting dark. Come closer to my side. What line can you possibly cross over? I'll throw up another one. Let's see how long it takes you to cross the tide. You're right. For us, it's normal. We forget sometimes we're on the radio. I know. We think we're in a bar just drinking beers and stuff. We're just kind of chatting. Oh yeah, we're broadcasting this. It might be a couple million people listening. We've got to check in with Earl real fast. Earl! You! All right, Earl, don't yell into the phone. I'm sorry, you had it before. I just couldn't hear myself. I know, but when you start screaming, no one can hear you because the phone is really distorted. I'm sorry, guys. Remember, proper modulation. All right, so you're at the 69th Street Beer Distributor, corner of 69th and Grand Avenue in Masbeth, Queens. Yeah, we're giving out laugh stickers, WWF posters. We're going to give away some tickets a little bit later. Okay. And it is a madhouse here. Queens loves O&A. Well, don't make anyone yell because the phone screws up when it hears too much noise. Yeah, everything's kind of calmed down right now. Right before, it was just rabid. Cool. How long are you guys staying there? We'll probably be here for about another 20, 25 minutes or so. All right, very good. I mean, the traffic is absolutely just backed up. Every construction truck has come up and asked for wow stickers. There's this huge sewage truck with wow on the side. They're like, we need some stickers for all of our trucks. Well, here's somebody that got a sticker. Sir, where'd you get your sticker? I got it from a negro. Oh, really? What? I got it from a negro. You did? Very good. All right, Earl. Some audio of Earl getting trampled by people trying to get stickers. Help me! Help me! Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! Help me! All right, Earl, thank you. All right, man. Earl doesn't even deal with it anymore. He's just like, oh, okay. All right, is the abuse over? Can I leave? Hey, this lady's getting her ass tattooed in the other studio. You're getting an ass tat? Really? What's your name? My name's Candy. Candy? Two Ws on each cheek? You don't look like a candy. I don't? No, no. I don't know. You look like a girl that would not be getting a tattoo on her ass. That's the perfect way to put it. And that's why you're doing it? Have guys been looking at your ass and saying, hey, this looks like a good place for a... Not a stick up show. I don't know. A good place for a tattoo. Really? And who's the tattoo artist? That's way up. He looks like a game show host. I'm like E. Johnny, tell them what she wants. You look like Candy looks like an ant. Yeah, you kind of look like... You know what I mean? Like I come to you for advice. Candy, they are... And she tells you to get a tattoo on your ass. You need to be crazy to get a tattoo on your ass. Are you going through anything now? Some kind of a crisis where has there been a recent breakup? Where you feel you want to unleash some new freedoms and get a tattoo on your ass? Are you married? No. You're divorced? How recently? Yeah, how recently? Eight years. Eight years? Is he still paying? Who's the dude behind you? Is he? Tattoo artists make it hurt. I gotta know. I didn't know that relationship so what lines I can cross. Who's the dude? I was bugging out. I'm getting hit. Is that the boyfriend? Yeah. Okay. Now how long have you guys been seeing each other? How long? Two weeks. Oh, that's it? Two weeks. Two weeks. And dude, was it your... He's got some good dope. He's got some serious dope. What you need to do is just be free. Look at that cloud. Do you see a reindeer? There's a tattoo of a reindeer on your ass, Candy. Was it his recommendation? No. How long have you wanted a tattoo? For a while now. Do you have any other tattoos? No. This will be your first one. You want it on your ass. That's right. Do you have any ideas of what you want? Oh yeah, an angel. Yeah, we got started already. Oh really? Can we see what she's sketching or something? She brought in the design. Do you remember the Van Halen 1984 cover? Yes. Similar to Angel. Right. Okay. Rock and roll. Tim, where's your place and what is it called? It's Fun City Tattoo. 124 McDougall Street. Hey McDougall Street. Yeah, next to Alibaba. That's between... Alibaba the guy? I think it is. Let me tell you something. The prophet is coming here next Wednesday, people. Thank you, Alibaba. And you better wake up. In the name of Alibaba, that's me. If you go down the street, you get chicken wings. Tell Alibaba he sends you. You get 20 cents off. Oh my God. He can touch you, yes. Whatever you do. Take your shirt off. Well, can we see what's going on down there? Let's see how far we've gotten. Now, how do you get that design onto our ass? You make a carbon stencil. Carbon stencil. Basically, it's just tracing. How long have you been doing that tattooing? For four years. Wow, look at that. Whoa, you've already gone at it with the gun. It's like a baby type. A cherub. A cherub on your ass. With a cigarette. With a cigarette. A bottle of Vinyekin. Is that what's going on down there? Let me get a look at that again. I haven't really seen... Angel with a cigarette and a bottle of Vinyekin. Finsta smoking a cigar and drinking. Maudie Finsta. Are you from Bayshore? It is. Look at that. Let me see the bottle. New Jersey. It's got the bottle and smoking a butt. It's a nice line. Very nice. Are you putting an O&A on there too? Yeah. Or on her ass? What about that? What are you going to do if Ann and I split up though? I'm going to have to find somebody named Hubert. We could just put a... Alright, well you guys have fun. It's the aura of Dolan and Anthony. Well, thanks for coming in, Candy. She's getting her ass done in the other studio. Hattu-ed.

We have to quickly pick up my brother because he's got this... Not yet. He's got this phone that he hooks up. I swear to God it's this through the internet phone. And he keeps calling everybody and saying this is great. It's totally free through the internet. But this is the call. Okay. I'll call you back. I'm not paying attention to this right now. I'm calling you. I'm just going to put this on my computer right now. This is technology. I'm not paying attention to this right now. I'm not paying attention to this right now. I'm not paying attention to this right now. You want to pick up your brother? Better communications, the first moon flight. He's been on hold for an hour and 17 minutes. First time I call him, he's on hold. First time I call him, he's on hold. I'm calling from my computer. I'm calling from my computer. Our listeners get pissed off if they're on hold for 15, 20 minutes. Anthony's own brother Joe has been on hold for an hour and 17 minutes. One hour and 17 minutes on his free phone. Joe. Joe from Venus. Can you hear me okay? See? Am I joking? Is that bad? Oh my God. No, no, no. Your heat shield. It's coming loose. Leave the retro-tac on and it will hold it, John Glenn. John. John. This is the lamest phone ever. Ever, ever, ever. It's worse than the Sports Illustrated football vote. There's a delay like we're talking to Sarajevo. An hour and 17 minutes and that's going to cost me a dime. Yeah, obviously. It's worth every penny. It's the worst. Let me mess with the mic volume. What? What? Now he's tweaking it. He's tweaking it. He's punching brother. He's sucking my dead. Now why would I go to the N.P. When I could go down five miles to the next town and get a 12-pack for $3.99 a bushelite? Now why the hell would I do that? You're out of your mind. That's what he's doing. Joe. Hello, hello. We have to say over so he knows when to talk? Break a breaker, Joe. Wait, wait, he's trying to talk. Joe. Look at the delay. Joe. Is it that bad? Oh, is it that bad? If someone on your system is downloading porno, we can't hear you for two minutes. Let me call you. I told you. Dude, I swear to God I get phone calls at night at home. Anthony. Joe. You won't believe this. I'm on my computer. It's all the internet. It's force.com and I call the man and it doesn't call. Oh, now my girlfriend wants to go. It's a cable. It's a forum. They don't have a cable mode in there. They have a cable mode. They have a cable mode. They have a cable mode. Joe. They don't have a cable modem out here at the forum. I believe they don't have a cable modem out in quorum. So he's using his 56k modem to make phone calls. That's right. Pull the can. The string isn't taut enough. I'll laugh a minute later. Tom Brokaw in Baghdad. I'll call on the regular phone. I want to play Stardust Spelling. I want to play. It's for people that can't function very well on time. You've had much too much experience smoking weed. I just smoked a quarter ounce of at least an eighth of an ounce of a Mishul Khan. What is that? Mishul Khan. Weed. Joe's always been very picky about his weed. This guy we used to know. Larry grew his own pot and came over our house with lunch bags. A paper brown lunch bag full of pot and handed them out. We didn't care. It was just massive amounts of pot. My brother was like, no, dude. This is nothing. I'm getting some Thai weed with the crystals on it that looks like it's been salted and kosher salt. I'm like, sorry, I'll just smoke eight of these and be just as hot. I don't care. It's free. We just got to drive to Ohio. Can I borrow your car? I'm driving to Ohio. Can I borrow your car? I'm driving to Ohio. 10 hours, 10 minutes, boy. I'm driving to Ohio. I'm driving to Ohio. I'm driving to Ohio. All right, Joe. Go tweak that system. I can't play, huh? No, you're too functional on weed. We need some real dopes. I want to win. I'll send you a prize. You brother of a bitch. It's so funny. Family and friends of Opie and Anthony, can I please the owner spelling bit? All right, man, I'll give you a call. Are you going to see Adam tomorrow? Yeah, I'm going to see him. Over. I hear the storm's real bad. Over. I'll be a co-purn. All right, Joe. Brother Joe calling from the planet Venus, everybody. Joseph. The funny part about this is he waited an hour and 17 minutes for that. He is so excited about that it's free. The fact that it's a free phone call that he's calling. He's like, dude, I can call anywhere. Watch, I'm going to call California. I'm going to call California. I'm going to call California. Unbelievable. Howdy, Ian. Can I help you? Joe's phone connection. The girl's getting her butt tattooed. Oh, yeah, there she is. We can see you through the window there. That was really weird. She's getting stuck in the rear right now. Can they hear us in there? Yeah. Oh, hi. I wanted to know because we could see you over here. How's your ass feel? Okay for now. Is it tingling or anything? Yeah. After having that done? What? Butt sex. None of that. Butt sex. Stick to your vagina. There's Candy getting it in the... Pulper. Thank you, Jeff. The pulper. We'll fade her out. He's working over here. Someone bringing up the most pathetic thing that my brother was doing. Calling for free. Very excited about the web phone thing that sounds like this. We have a toll free number here at the station. When you call it, you don't pay either. I called the toll free number with my free phone and they actually have to send me money now. It's amazing. Well, do you want to play stoner spelling babe? We've got like 50 people that want to play. Who wouldn't? Brewer, you want to play a little bit? Sure, let's do that. I haven't got paged yet. I'm waiting to see it. I left a message saying we're cool for hanging out. So you did everything right. You called her. You played by the rules. I'm playing by the rules. She'll get you back later. Brewer, it doesn't matter. The rules change. They'll change on you. I thought I played by the rules. No, you didn't. Do you ever see those movies where you make a deal with the devil and you make sure every detail is hammered out so it doesn't screw you? Yeah. And then all of a sudden you get what you want but oh my god I forgot that and you get screwed? That's what it's like. It's tough now because it's a baby. When you have a baby and you leave the baby with the other person for more than three hours, you get the feeling that you will never leave me alone. This child has shoved everything in its mouth for the last eight hours. I couldn't crap. I couldn't shower. I couldn't even fart. Well you had a nice time. All right, you have the little chick with the tattoo in her ass. Put your child to bed, Mr. Responsibility. Oh my god. Yeah man, it's tough. It must be. Baby, I'm sorry. Wow. That'll help. And you know she's listening. Yeah. God. She's listening to the guest session cracking. Oh my god, how do you get anything talking about Reagan and his little sput with the nation? Hello Nancy. Something about the head. She goes, what was it? Ask him what the big head was. Nancy. My wife Nancy has a huge head. I wake up every morning and I have to stare into the heartless eyes of a goddamn Mardi Croft float. That big, big Nancy head. The Mardi Croft float. I feel like a big remax balloon floating over my bed. Yes, Nancy. Don't have a hemorrhage. It's okay. See, sometimes it feels like your head's going to explode. Yeah, right, Jim. Did he just do a brain freeze or something? No, I'm laughing too hard. Sometimes it hurts. I go home tired from just laughing. I've had swarms since I've been here. My ass, my face. Everyone's going to have to scrub their asses before they see their significant other. I'll play the thing. Uh-oh. Did I hear a pager? Let me check it. You got a page? There's the bell. It's over. It's over. I don't think it is though. Come on, Jim. I'm working this place for free. I'm using the computer. I'm not Anthony's brother. This is my Commodore 64. Go check it out. We've got a ton of stoners standing by to play stoner spelling bee. OP, Anthony. We hate each other. This guy's in safety certifiably insane. Thank you, Anthony. Shut up, you jackass. OP and Anthony. Two ignorant jackasses who someone was brain dead enough to give a radio show to. We just found out Jim Brewer's free. He can hang. We just found that out. We've got to talk about Stacker 2, Anthony, the world's strongest fat burner. Oh yeah. You've got to lose the weight. Nice weather right around the corner. You're going to be all... Brewer's just grabbing his belly right now. How do I get rid of this? Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Start by putting your shirt down. Wow. You're going to whoop your behind in little Whipple Balls. My pros are ready. It burns the fat, cuts down on the cravings to be snacking during the day, and it gives you a boost of energy when you start petering out. It's like drinking a few cups of coffee. You feel like... You'll be going crazy. Eat what you want, still lose weight, no mid-dead cravings, and like I said, boost energy. During the day, Stacker 2, it works. What does it say? Banana Hammock season is almost here. Yes, remember that? So if you're going to be wearing your Banana Hammock, your Speedos, nothing better than going down to the beach and seeing the guys in the Speedos. It's always the European guys. It's not Europe. Put on the goddamn long shorts. Please. Who wants to see that? You ever see that? It's disgusting. The big fat guys. Remember when you first got an issue of Nudist magazine? When the web, when you first started getting into the web, it was like, oh, Nudist. So you'll check out the nude people playing volleyball on the beach? Bunch of fat slobs. Where's the hot chicks? Was it Jones Beach that years ago, I don't know where it was. I think I was living in Florida. There was one section that was Nude Beach. Robert Moses, Field Boat. Robert Moses, Field 5. Yes, I must have walked about two hours to find the Nudist beach. I never saw one thing. I was most annoyed. I was fried for a week and a half and I came back in one of them little crab, horseshoe crabs. The horseshoe crab. I come back with something. I got a horseshoe crab. All right, so if you're going to be on the nude beach this summer, get some Stacker 2. Stacker 2, give us something to look at, people, please. Yeah, all right. Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. Give them a call. 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. OPNN. Brilliant radio, I expect. Oh, God. All right, it's FU Friday. Hanging out with Jim Brewer today. Having lots and lots of fun. We're all checking out Britney Spears on TV. There we are. Right there. All right. I want to say hi to everyone that's listening to us all over the country. Illegally. Yeah, take your shirt off, Hammer. Well, we got a lot of high people that want to play Stoner Spellendood. This is Jim Brewer's game. Yeah, wow, wow, wow. All right, we got to find some really good people, though. Yeah, last time it was some funny people. Yeah, we need some real Stoner. Dave. Yo, what's up? Hey, Dave. Brewer! What's up, man? Where are you from, Dave? I'm from Westchester. Yeah? I got a question for you guys. If I spoke to weed, I spoke to joints, and I took two perks because I got the pins taken out of my ankle, and I took Stacker 2, is that bad? Oh, my God. What language are you talking? You might be a perfect contestant. How high are you, man? You want to know? I got to have spoken to joints, talked to perk assets, and took a Stacker 2. I don't know if that means anything. What is that? Well, that will take the edge off. Yeah, it's like mixed, whatever. Here's a go. Well, we have to give the thumbs up or the thumbs down. I'm going to have to say thumbs down, man.

On the patio is a homer, but it has to go over the top railing. On the roof is a grand slam. We have the short porch in right field too for the homer. Oh, that's ... I'm a lefty too. Alright, Jim Brewer everyone. Thanks a lot Jim. And we'll finish the show next with a quick game of What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show, 212-757-1027. The Opie and Anthony Show. Oh, stupid, wow. Boo, boo, boo. Or stupidity on the way. Oh my God, what a day. I've never laughed that hard in my life. I've got to just go on record and say that. Just sitting here and watching Jim Brewer perform like that. The visuals are twice as funny. Unfortunately this is radio but I think it comes off very funny. I hope you guys had a good time listening. We certainly had a lot of fun today. Brewer, Jay Moore calling in on the phone. Of course my pal Adam Brara tonight at Governor's. Yeah, Adam at Governor's all weekend. We'll see you there. We're going to catch one of the shows, two shows tomorrow. Jay Moore on Politically Incorrect Tonight. He told us he snuck in a couple OK Terrifics. OK Terrifics. OK Terrifics. We've got to get out of here. Someone's got to tape that so we can get those dropped. And Jim Brewer not plugging anything, just coming in as a friend. Having a good time. We really like when people just come in to hang. God damn, he is fun to hang with. And that's just hanging out for the show. We have to go out and have a few beers with that son of a bitch. That would be scary. That would be scary. Hey Hammer. Hey Hammer. Hey, nice head. Anthony, remember the strippers from a couple of days ago? Yeah. Well, Jimmy was hard at work putting some sweepers together. We had the hidden microphone on the strippers. Yeah, and we learned what we always suspected, not a brain in the head. Yeah. Well, Jimmy, put some sweepers together. I want to check them out here on the air. Here's the first one. Behind the Genius. Hold on. This is the most evil special device. Here we go. Finger. Behind the Poiful Dog. Do you know how many guys with the perspective? Behind the Glamour. We leave you with the sounds of a sea in the mouth. Behind the Whore with Opie and Anthony. You'll never look at Gash the same way again. On 10270 WNEW. Wow, that's pretty good. You put another one together real fast. Behind the Genius. Come on, read it. It is against the law for animals to copulate each other and stand still in the open. What is copulating? Behind the Playful Dog. I hate geniuses. Behind the Glamour. I just got a bug out of my mouth. Behind it all, there's Opie and Anthony. No wonder whenever they find the dead strips, they got their mouths duct taped shut. Behind the Whore with Opie and Anthony. You'll never look at Gash the same way again. On 10270 WNEW. Bravo, Jimmy. Jimmy works his ass off behind the scenes putting those things together. That's funny. They had no clue there on the radio. That's what makes that really, really good. All right, Anthony, let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show and then we got to get the hell out of here. All right, we got a couple on instant feedback. A Jim from Jersey, he learned that my brother Joe can do a mean imitation of Alexander Graham Bell on the first telephone. Very good. Pete from Rockland, I learned that I want to be a WNEW. What I learned is that I am just stupid. I am just stupid, sober, cannot spell a word and chicken wings make great apples. Let's go to the phones. Mike, real fast, we only have a couple minutes left on the show. What did you learn today? Oh, I learned that I'm taking the day off. Next time I find out, Jim Brewer is going to be on your show and I'll never look at a chicken wing the same. Yeah. Without laughing. Very good. Syndication on my ass. Thank you. I learned that apropos, a real word, however it is spelled. What I learned on the ONA show today that Brewer is the guy who took a leak out of the building's bathroom window, ought to spazz his head. I learned I never laughed myself so stupid before. It's definitely time for a Jim Brewer suite. Yeah. All right, let's go to the phones real fast. Charlie, what did you learn on the show today? I learned I'm not the only one who used to steal donuts and rolls from in front of 7-Eleven. Very good, man. Can I say hi to my daughter? Yeah, hit it. Hey, hey, some chicken wings. Thanks a lot, guys. All right, man. You rock. Thank you. He's on that free phone. Oh, my God. I'm exhausted. Yeah, all right. There's a ton of people, but we're running out of time. Jenny, what did you learn on the show today? Oh, yeah, I learned that you think that chicken wings are fly like boring, but they really just kind of freak people out. Yeah, very good. It was a very funny day. I laughed my ass off. Yeah, we had a lot of fun. Thank you. I was trying on the belt park bike. Cool. See you. Thanks, Jenny. Bye. Buttnut from Jersey checks in every day. What I learned today, I thought only Rob Halford could sing the lyrics of Screaming for Vengeance. God bless Jim Brewer. Brewer, another amazing performance. Dave from Chester, New Jersey, I learned that if you could get a chick to get an ass tattoo, she might consider butt sex. I learned today that drunk guys at Anthony's Giggs request his baseball cap. Yes. Uh, Ed, what did you learn on the show today? Hey, guys, how are you doing? Good. I learned that J. Moore was addicted to the Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks, Picks. Hey, you know what you always have to talk about? The Tic Tac Toe one. Yeah. You never talk about that one. There was a Tic Tac Toe, Picks? That was the first one they ever did. I just remember the basketball one and like the Pong one. Right. And quickly also in the cartoons, everybody used to do the commentaries every week and they used to have the same guy and then at the end you say, what's your opinion? We'd like to know. We'd like to know. Yeah, yeah. Why the hell did they show that? Who the hell can it? I don't know. I think it was the law. It's kind of a public service thing, sir. Ed, going Tom and Jerry. Ed, no one else. We'd discuss it for the next hour, but we're running out of time. Sorry, guys. Have a great weekend, though. You too, guys. Later, man. Later. Uh, John, what did you learn on the show today? John, hello. Hey. Hey. Hey, man. What's up? I learned that if I fart next to my teacher and throw chicken wings at people that maybe someday I'll get pussy whipped by my wife to get home on time. Very good, man. Bye, Precious. All right, bye. Precious. Evan from Jersey, I learned high people are pretty good spellers. Yeah. Luke from Yonkers, I learned two things. One, that you could get better reception on the moon than from the internet. Two, I actually never, ever, never, ever, ever, ever really learned a freaking thing. That's true. From your show. All right. Ah, I think we're done, man. Yeah, please. Huh, Joe on line 10, I learned that Adam Farrar takes two days to plug his gigs. That's not true. He's just in front of the show, in front of Anthony's. He comes in when he's in doubt. We're going to check him out tomorrow. Yeah, we'll see you at the Governor's tomorrow for Adam Farrar. Yeah, check out Adam. Hey, guys, we had a great time this week. I hope you had fun listening. What a piece sir we had. Uh, some guy from Glendale. I learned Jim Brewer sounds more like Norm MacDonald than Norm MacDonald though. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
