Exclusively. 2 for Tuesday's ours, God damn it! Here on... N-H-W. We need our 2 for Tuesday back. I feel so bad they took it. We can't be a radio station without 2 for Tuesday. How will we go on? Haha, 2 for... Take your 2 for and shove it up your butt. Keep it... But-sick! But-sick. Where's a good but-sick to start the show? Here it is. But-sick! Ahhhhhhh! Hahaha! What's better than... Ahhhhhhh! Okay, listen, we gotta get some people in here, Anthony. Yes, we do. Our phone number is 212-757-1027. Helmet rocks, by the way. Helmet! Helmet! Helmet! We gotta start the show with some helmet. Maybe tomorrow we'll do it on song or something. I got a lot of flack for playing at Owekomeva yesterday. You certainly did, Owekomeva. I thought I would try something a little different. A little different. You know what the people want to hear. You can't be stirring up the soup too much. I thought that was a goof. Alright, Psychomorph, what's going on? Owekomeva. Alright, listen, you guys, we got a situation happening at the radio station. It's never a boring day around here. I got Owekomeva. Yeah, if Erika's listening, we've been trying to get a hold of you, Erika. We need to talk to you on the air. Beba is in a coma, basically. Beba is in a coma, basically. Beba is in a coma, basically. Beba is in a coma, basically. Beba. Erika's on her way to pick up Spaz. Hey, Beba. I'm in a coma. Spaz is out cold on the couch outside. You taking a picture of him? He's a mess, man. I got into work around 11.30 and Spaz was, he looked absolutely horrible. He's sick today. So I'm like, go home, man. You're going to get me sick. You're going to get everyone sick. He's got blisters on his feet from his brand new $200... The boots that he bought on his credit card. He's got blisters. And he feels like crap. Great. We're going about our business, trying to get the radio show together. A couple hours go by. We all start looking at Spaz and we realize that he is sleeping with his eyes open and not talking to anyone. Just in a chair. It didn't even look like sleep. He looked like somebody who just OD'd on heroin right before they die. That face they made. So I started singing in the office. Spazzy, can you hear me? Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy. Spazzy, can you hear me? Spazzy, can you hear me? Spazzy, can you hear me? He's completely out of it. He's completely out of it. So then we had to scream. I'm like Spaz, what is wrong? I just start screaming the famous OP scream. To wake him up, I'm like Spaz, what is wrong? Look at you. What? At one point he rolled over to his little area and put his head down on the desk and just was laying there. Like F'd up. You might be hearing a mic in the other room. Well, because we're going to try to wake Spaz up. Tommy can you hear me? Can you feel me near you? Can you hear me? Stop that! Can I help you hear you? Stop that! Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy. Tommy can you hear me? Can you feel me near you? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Tommy can you see me? Stop that! Can I help to cheer you? Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy. What's that? Can you feel me near you? Ain't nothing. Tommy can you see me? Let me out, let me out, come on! Can I help to cheer you? Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy. Whoa! Tommy, Tommy, Spazzy, Spazzy. Be quiet sir. Alright, so he's really, really out of it and Erika's on the way to pick up Spazzy. Spazzy can you hear me? Erika please call the radio show, this is kind of serious. So we woke him up enough to get two words out of him. Took Sudafed. Took. He didn't even make a sentence. Took, took Sudafed. Took Sudafed. So I scream at him like Spaz where are the pills? I got it. Like the guy that OD'd. He's incoherent right? He's so out of it. He took two Sudafed. F'n ponderous. Wait, wait, wait. So it turns out, first of all it's not the non-drowsy Sudafed. No, no, he took the drowsy one. And Spaz is drowsy in life. Picture him with a Sudafed. One will just knock you out on a day like today. He threw two in his body. Two Sudafed so he is out. Out cold on the couch. Now who's got the portable mic? Chris. Who wants to go out there? Or you want to get Psycho Mark? I don't know, I'm not close enough with Spaz. Get Psycho Mark. F'n harassed. So I mean. Wait, that was him? Huh? You mic'd him? You mic'd him? An inch from his mouth. Who was talking to him? He's mumbling incoherently. He's like, rawr, rawr, rawr. He's out cold on the couch. He's drooling on himself. And he cannot keep his eyes on whoever. You guys take some pictures? I have a couple pictures of him. Get a pic with the mic right there. He's so effed up he can't even talk. When you guys are drooling so. I hear you. He's mumbling. Like he can hear you guys. I think he said, oh, oh, oh. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz, can you hear us? Spaz? What are you crying? Spazzy. Spazzy, can you hear me? Spazzy, can you hear me? Spazzy, can you hear me? What, Mom? Huh? Spazzy, can you hear me? Is Mommy molesting you? Spaz? Spaz. Just kidding. Kevin? I'm sick and you just leave me alone. Oh my god. You're whining like you're in the back of a cop car. Ben! Kevin? Kevin, how many SudaFed did you take, Kevin? Two. Two SudaFed. Oh, he can hear us now. Are you awake, Kev? I've been awake. Have you ever taken SudaFed before? When I was a kid. When you were a kid. And you know, uh, you should probably take one to see how it hits you. I'm going to throw up. Spaz is cursing. Spaz, you're on the air. Spaz, we're out of dump. You curse one more time. You're really going to cause some problems here. You're really going to be sick. Yeah. Alright, so what is wrong with you? What happened? You were fine yesterday. I've been sneezing for the past few days and everything just caught up on me. So you decided to take two two SudaFed? Two! And two aspirin. Anything else you throw into that body of yours? Any heroin? No. You smoke a dupe with Psycho Mark? No. I'm also hearing that it hurts when you take a leak. Yeah, it does. It hurts when you take a leak? It's because I can't feel anything. What do you mean you can't feel anything? I can't feel my muscles. Oh my god. What did you... Is anybody selling this stuff on the streets? Because it sounds great. Where's Erica? Why isn't she calling in? Huh? Skip the mic away. I'm just going to go home. Well, alright. We're just making sure you're okay. We had to wake you up. You were comatose on that couch. I was awake the whole time. No you weren't. Do you know all the pictures we took of you? I saw flashes. You saw flashes? Did you see the fake penis next to your mouth? No. I didn't know what it was. I guess you weren't awake then. Dude. What happened? It doesn't sound like somebody with a cold. I don't have a cold. Why don't you go to the doctor? I have no benefits. You have benefits? You want us to get the stinky bag to wake you up? I am awake. I just can't move. Okay? If you get a whiff of the whiffle ball bat from last week's show, you'll be wide awake. Look, if you want me to work, go sit at the phones. I can't get up. Oh yeah, that's what we want our listeners to have to contend with when they're calling in. Hello? What do you want to talk about? I guess you might hear from me. How are the blisters on your feet? They're horrible. You are a mess. Hey, I heard you guys had fun at wrestling last night, huh? Not that much fun. You drove the van? I didn't drive the van. Mark drove the van. And what was he? Was he scaring you? No, I wasn't in the van. Well, Spaz, why do you have blisters on your feet? Let's get back to that. Because of my new boots. Your $200 boots? Yeah. Are the blisters big? As soon as one pops, another one forms right over it. Are you sitting up? We can't see him. I mean, there's a mic outside the studio that we're listening to. Are you sitting up, Spaz? No. Would you like to talk to the lovely Erica? She will not call the show until you say it's okay or something. Yes, she wants to. Erica, why don't you give us a call real fast? I would think. I think you need to talk to him. Spaz, you're stupid to take two Sudafed. I needed something, okay? Well, now this seems to be worse than the cold you were trying to get rid of. You're like a drug addict or something. I feel like crap. Well, you look like crap. And it hit you that fast? Yeah, he was sitting in the office. He wasn't moving. His eyes were open, but he wasn't home. It's just been a long time coming. He's just been building up and just hit today. Wait, wait. Is it the sick or the Sudafed? The sick has been leading up, so I take the Sudafed and now I feel like this. Yeah, the Sudafed has just knocked him completely for a loop here and there. Is it the long commute getting to you already? No. Someone said he could be getting that equine encephalitis from the giant mosquito. Maybe you have that. Yeah, maybe it's not blisters on your feet. Maybe you got stung by a mosquito or something. Hey, that new place that you have in Slotsburg isn't underneath any cancerous live wires, is it? No. Okay, just checking. I'm going to go check on the other guys. Okay. Anything else, Spaz? No. How are we going to get you downstairs? I'll limp. You're going to limp? Can you even stand up? I don't know. I haven't tried in the last hour. Why don't you try standing up? Yeah, give it a whirl. Can you get the microphone out of my face so I can get up? Okay. Can you get the microphone out of my face so I can get up? Okay. Is he up? He's moving. Some people checking in with their diagnosis. Maybe he has a urinary tract infection. Does he have a fever? Spaz, do you feel like you have a fever? I don't know. You don't know or no? I can't understand. My head is pounding. Your head's pounding? Does it really sting when you take a leak? At first. At first. At first. Burning when he takes a leak. Blisters on his body. On his feet. And he's comatose. My throat hurts. His throat hurts bad. Do you have anything? Did anyone look down your throat? No. Do you have any kind of like white marks in there? Like a strep throat or something? Yeah, well we know that. Do you want to drink some toilet water? No. Make you feel better? Spaz, why would you come to work feeling like this? We appreciate the dedication to the radio show but this is a little loud out there. We have Stinky, we'll be fine. Yeah, Stinky will step right in once again. No more sick days for another couple of months. Why did you use all your sick days up? Because he didn't think he was going to get sick. He's such an idiot, man. Look, everyone is just shaking their head. Like every day it's something different. Look at Sam from upstairs. People think we just write this stuff every night. We sit in the office and like, okay, what can we have Spaz do today? His life is a drama. Well Spaz, you obviously have to go home and get better. Oh, wait, wait, Spaz is going to get up? Okay, well we got a mic on him. Oh, Spaz? Yeah? Spaz, when you go home, I got to tell you this is another great opportunity for Stinky. Yeah. I'm Karen sick. You certainly are. Oh my God. We can't get Erica on the phone. I think she's going to be pissed at us that we put you on the air in this state. I'm trying to figure out if he's like this because he's sick or from the medication. Oh, you didn't see him earlier. He looked horrible when we first saw him this morning and then he took the Sudafed and made it worse because he took two instead of one. Well Spaz, perhaps instead of going to Schlotzberg and maybe checking in with Doc Baker, maybe you should go to a doctor, a real doctor, and see if there's something wrong with you. No benefits are set up yet. Oh, oh good, good. So if you're dead, at least you won't have to worry about paying any bills. You know what I mean Spaz? I got no money. Well people with no money go to the doctor all the time. In this country there are laws that they have to treat you. Regardless of your financial status. Stinky, take that mic. Stinky, are you ready to step up for Spaz once again today? Right away. Are you willing to fulfill the obligation as Vice Spaz to come forward? And take the office of Spaz? Someone is saying that Spaz was wasted at wrestling last night. Were you drinking last night? Be honest, we'll get people that'll tell us. I swear to the Lord I was not drinking. You didn't have anything to drink? Were you smoking dope? No, I never touched the stuff. No? You had no beer? Why is someone yelling liar in the background Spaz? I experimented once. With what? Pot? Once. Well your lovely girlfriend should be here soon. Where's Joe's garage? Do we have Frank's app as Joe's garage? There's a song I want to play for Spaz on there. See if you can find that. We might as well cheer him up with a little music. You know? Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Let me see the CD. This is a verse from the movie. This is a worst... It probably isn't on there then. Come on, we're the largest Rock and Roll library. We don't have Joe's garage. Part one. I think we gave it away when we were turning to talk. God damn it. Spaz, you think Eric is going to be pissed that we're talking to you on the air? I don't know. Because we begged her to call in and she hasn't yet. Because her cell phone has got no minutes left. Her cell phone has no minutes left? Are you kidding? Why? It's prepaid. And you used all your minutes? Yeah. Spaz, I heard you leased a car. Eric leases a car. How many miles do you get a year on the lease? 15,000. How long have you had the car? Less than a year. Like six and a half months? Yeah. How many miles do you have on the car? Close to 30. Oh my God, do you know how much they pound you for miles? You have close to 30,000 miles in a little over a half a year? What's the going rate for mileage on cars? 15 cents a mile. 15 cents a mile. So let's do some quick mathematics. He's already like, what did you say, 26? He's got two and a half years left. 26 you said Spaz? He's got 28,000 miles already. Yeah, so he's well over 1,500 in the whole. So already. About 2,500. About 2,500, 2,800 dollars already in mileage. So he's got two and a half years to go on the lease. If it keeps going this way, let's see. It would average out to over 4,000 for the year. Extra mileage. I don't think it would be anything to do with the lease. Spaz, a lot of people think you might have VD. Yeah. No. Huh? No. I wanted to play Why Does It Hurt When I Pee. From Frank Zappa. Why does it hurt when I pee? I love Zappa. It jumped right up and grabbed my meat. I got it from the toilet seat. My balls feel like a pair of maracas. You alright? Spaz, someone thinks you might have ovarian cancer. I don't have ovaries. That's right. You don't have ovaries. We taught you that, remember? I have toxic shock syndrome. From the tampon. I don't know what I have. Alright, well we were stalling, hoping that your lovely girlfriend would call in, but it doesn't look like she wants any part of this. Blisters on feet, sore throat, lives in Slotsburg, Jim from Jersey says you have hoof and mouth disease. What the hell is that? I don't know, but Slotsburg. Have you been sticking your feet somewhere that they don't belong? No. His boots hurt. Listen to him whine. Alright, well Spaz. It's sickle cell anemia. You got sickle cell, Spaz. I don't know. I need a blood test. You need a blood test. Listen to him. I know, he's going to get us all sick. You got Legionnaires disease, man. Don't breathe. Oh no. I don't like it. There's nothing in my bladder. No. I need water. I was saying somebody painted Save Spaz on the Slotsburg water tower. Like Ferris Bueller. Are you sure? Yeah, don't give him toilet water. Kelly, I was sitting next to Spaz at Raw and he was fine. He must have done something hardcore. And somebody else writing, god damn it, I bought him a beer. I didn't drink it. Maybe you have the love virus. Computer virus? Somehow I still got it though. Alright Spaz, why don't you lay back down on the couch. Thank you. Alright. John saying he might have caught gonorrhea from the girl he cheated on Erika with. Now he can write in his calendar, March 6th, got the clap. I swear to god I'll burn out the Earth. What? So you're a little worried about your weewee aren't you? No. Is there anything happening with your weewee? I've been tested, it's clean. No, I mean it burns when you leak but is there anything happening? It always happens when I get sick. Are you ovulating? No. Be serious. Peace Nile virus? You didn't get bit by a mosquito did you? No. Alright, well we've got to take a break Anthony but Spaz is very sick today. Mad cow disease? Did he eat any beef? He ate a lot of meat. Lupus? Everybody's just coming up with things he has. I'm going to guess mad cow's disease. Do you have the HUNTA virus? Were you near any rodent feces or HUNTAs? You know what I have after you've tested. I think he's got the HUNTA virus. People are just screaming quarantine, quarantine, quarantine Spaz. Quarantine, yep. You never woke up and just felt like crap. You woke up and just felt like crap. You never did though. What, woke up and felt like crap? Yeah. But sex! Maybe. But sex! But sex! That's not what I'm talking about. A lot of people are trying to figure out what's wrong with you Spaz. I'm going to test his shell. One of the Yankee Bleacher creatures. This is the same kind of stunt he used to pull at Iona. Anything for attention. Spaz do you have the swine flu? What's the swine flu? I don't know. It's a flu. It's a flu that you get from pigs. Maybe you have a yeast infection. A yeast infection? No, that's the only way we get those. People checking in. This is totally impossible. No one can be this pathetic. Spaz you got anthrax. How's your prostate? I remember most of the day at school whatever I got really don't shake it for. Spaz do you have Lou Gehrig's disease? Do you have Muscle's ache? Bob from Jersey. More coherency came out of the mouths of a person who did a bottle of Jack and a handful of Lou. Spaz do you have the bubonic plague? I have no clue what you're talking about. Do you have the Ebola virus? Where's my Ebola thing? Get the Ebola thing. We got all the symptoms of Ebola. It's on the card over there. You might get my patient's blood. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Spaz are you faking cancer to help the Mets? The Mets have been in a little loop. The Mets have been losing lately. Are you faking cancer to try to turn them around a bit? Spaz Mike from Long Island checking in the stinging may come from spanking it in the shower with liquid hand soap. I think every guy has had that problem. Spaz you don't bother us when we're sick because we don't come in. I'm pissed because you're going to get us all sick. I'm like the boy in the plastic bubble. I can't be around sick people. My sick days haven't been reset yet. Spaz do you have cranky ass? What is that? I guess not. Could be meningitis. You need to pass a stone? No but it runs in the family. Ah. Daniel wants to know if you've had a breast exam lately. Well we got the commercial for Ebola virus. See if you have any of these symptoms Spaz. Do you have a stuffy nose? A scratchy throat? And a cough that just won't let? E-Bola! Cancer diarrhea? E-Bola! Blood oozing from every armpit? Black virus oozing out of your mouth and nose? E-Bola! Ebola! The itching, scratching, sniffling, sneezing, coughing, and coughing, and bleeding so you can die virus! Anything like that Spaz? Not even close. Alright we're just checking. We're trying to be doctors here. Fitz wants to know if you're laying there counting your ribs. Of course from the FBA side. Are you counting your ribs Spaz? So skinny and carrying. Spaz you may have encephalitis. Do you have any allergies Spaz? You could be allergic to Sudafed you know. I'm allergic to bees. Bees? You haven't been stung by a bee have you? If I was my head would be twice the size it is. Wow that's got to be some sight. We'll put a little carnal hat on you. Spaz you want us to get you a gynecologist? I'm just gonna break. Did you eat any of those elastra chips? Those could do that. A burger from New Rochelle said King Gimp had the same symptoms. Eric from Mesa Pequo is saying don't let Spaz go home. He'll infect all 50 trains he takes. Spaz you may have captain trips. Have you been dreaming about a fat black woman in Nebraska? Or a devil guy out in Las Vegas? The stand right? Very good. Is your neck blowing up? I don't know. Is your neck blowing up? Like a tire tube? Spaz would you like to take a leak? No. You sure? Alright. Alright I guess we'll just have to wait for Erica. Is she going to come upstairs to get you? That's her prerogative. Her prerogative? If Erica is listening please come upstairs because she can't call us because they ran out of minutes on their cell phone. Who are they calling? You know how many minutes you get these days on phones? They're so competitive now that all the phone companies are giving away service. Who are you two calling so much on your cell phone? We're getting things ready for the new apartment. Phone company, cable, everything. How many minutes you get? We keep buying 50 at a time. 50 at a time? By 50 I mean. I mean you're buying 50 at a time. I mean you're buying 50 at a time. I mean you're buying 50 at a time. I mean you're buying 50 at a time. 50 at a time? Maybe you should get a little more than 50? Maybe you should get a little more than 50? Yeah. Did a rat bite you in your new apartment? Did a rat bite you in your new apartment? Mice free, roach free. Yeah right. Were cockroaches nibbling on your wiener? Were cockroaches nibbling on your wiener? No. Alright Spaz we'll let you go I guess. Thank you. Maybe Regis Fillman knows what you have. Got it. Joe from Jersey writes, The problem with Spaz is reality. My diagnosis is that his first credit card bill came in the mail today. Yeah. Thank you man. He got a touch of the reality it's called. The reality bug. I don't get mail yet. What? I don't get mail yet. Hey Mike's a big Spaz fan he hopes you feel better. Mike what's up? Mike A? Alright we should take our first... Hey Mike. Mike.

It's pretty cold. After work everybody hangs in the office. Stinky's right there. Bud in hand. We're just hanging out. Shooting the crap.

So Psycho Mark was at the Coliseum yesterday for Raw's war. Yeah. I want to say hi to all the guys that showed up to the van yesterday. I heard there was a lot of supporters out there. Tons. A lot of fun to be had by everyone. Tons of fun. I heard you were organizing the troops. I was reading email. That was hilarious. I had to pull them away from the other station's van. They're chomping at the bit. It's getting scary. It's to the point where if Psycho Mark says something, it's all over. You have too much power in your van. No. They absolutely don't. They don't realize it. There was one station there. I don't care. Use call letters. We don't really care. We showed up. BAB and BLI were there. They both had their vans. I pulled up and slammed the brakes and read the engine right towards them. I was like, I'm coming to get you. I pulled up right behind the both of them. The BLI guy is up on top of the van. I was in front of the Colosseum. How are we doing everybody? Hello Colosseum. Hey. Wacky radio people. I just jumped out and gave him a .50 caliber for about 30 seconds. He was louder than his loudspeakers could ever be. Everyone is just laughing. I jumped back in my van. I was like, that was really cool. It's another wacky radio band. Just idiots. Within two seconds everyone came right over to our van and ignored them. I heard we had a huge crowd around the WOW van. The WOW stickers being handed out. Like crazy. What happens after the Rod's War event at the Colosseum? All you had to say was one word and the van was going to be tipped over. This is great. It was pandemonium. Naturally everyone is out of there and there are thousands of people milling about. We've got probably 200 to 300 people surrounding the NAW van. The geniuses, and I mean geniuses from BLI and I know who they are, decide, well, let's top the guys from NAW. This will be a gag. They get up on top of their vans with their speakers and they start playing some stupid disco music and start trying to taunt us. Within about three point two seconds. You don't want to taunt us or our listeners. No, no. A little warning to every station that listens to us every day. Do not taunt us or our listeners. You ever see the scene in The Godfather where they're trying to tell that producer guy to play ball with the mob? Sure. He goes, I don't care how many of you Guinea grease bald egos bastards come out of the woodwork. You're just sitting there at home going, oh no, no, no, no, no, you shouldn't say that. Oh bad, bad. That's not good. That was exactly the same. They decide to get on their van after the event and start taunting. One guy screams, let's get him. In the low crowd it looked like LA. LA and Somalia combined. I heard the BLI van was like a little piece of cheese in the park with just a ton of ants all over it. Oh my God, the two guys on top of the van turned white. The thing's shaking back in the voice. They start shaking the van, the guys on top. All Mark had to say was go for it or whatever and they would have tipped the damn thing right over. They would have tipped it, burned it and had a barbecue on top of that stinking van in about a half a second if I gave the orders to do so. You felt pretty good about yourself because you were able to say, look guys, no, that's okay, calm down. I really ran over and started peeling guys off the van. I'm like, guys, please, let's not destroy their van. If we're going to go to war it's got to be something really good. It's going to be worth it. Not a wimpy disco station from Long Island. No. Well, needless to say that their van was covered in probably 150 sticks. They spent the next 30 minutes peeling them off. I'm like, see what happens when you left with us. What an idiot. Idiots. See, we're real here. I mean, they're going to go on top of the van and taunt and act like a DJ all the time. We'll get them. We'll get them. Here we go. We're going to get them. We're going to taunt them. We're going to try to do stuff with the crowd beforehand. You know, like, you know, guess this trivia question for Britney Spears seconds. Whoa, you know. Yeah. Well, very good job. General Psycho Mark everyone. Say hi to all the guys that came up to the van last night. Y'all know who you are. You guys are completely out of your minds. There was, I've never seen so many drunk fools in my life. I heard there was an O&HN at Raw. Is that true? Here we go. Matt, what's going on? Hello? You're on the air, Matt. Let's go. What's up? Matt, turn down your radio. Turn the radio down, Matt. I'm listening. What do you got for the show, man? What do we got for you? Yeah. Yo, we were there last night at the Coliseum. We hung out with Psycho Mark before. Psycho Mark, Psycho Mark, Psycho Mark. Don't remember exactly who we are. All right. He heard you, man. We chilled with him. And then after we came outside, I started an O&HN. We got everybody riled up. That's what everybody wanted. They tipped the van, we were going nutty. It was ridiculous. You don't even know. We were going crazy. These guys from PsyOscid were completely out of their mind. Right on, man. Well, thank you, Matt. All right. All right. Peace, Matt. All right. No doubt. Later. The PsyOscid what? Boys? They call themselves. Okay, brother. Okay. Lou, what's going on? All right. What you doing, bro? How are you, Lou? Listen, they had the classic sign. I think Dice was there. They had a sign that said, I'm over here, farmer. Oh, I saw that live on TV. I'm over here now. That was great. They knew when they went to the wide angle, they had Paws of Salad. Yeah, there were so many signs that were associated with the radio show on Raw's War last night. You guys are great, man. Thank you, Lou. Syndication on the ground. All right. They confiscated a bunch of signs. As a matter of fact, a lot of people got their signs confiscated out. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Unfortunately. John, what's going on? Hey, what's up, man? How are you? Pretty good, man. They tried to take my sign last night. Why? I had to show me your meat curtain signs. They tried to take my sign. I tried to take my sign, so I'm pulling on my sign down on the ring side, and we're fighting for my sign. I finally start beating my head with my sign, and I take off. I go running upstairs, and then we got all those girls who start wowing. Oh, very cool. Yeah, we were over there with the yellow brigade. Everybody was wearing their shirts over there. Kind of. Then we chased Spaz out of his seat. Oh, really? Spaz would have moved to begin with, so then we're like, yo, come on, man. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. We're like, yo, come on, let's go, Spaz, let's go. He's like, nah, I'm not going anywhere. So then, all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ha, ha, you girls. All right. We chased him out of his seat, bring him outside, and just, yeah, man, it was crazy, dude. Cool. I'm glad you had a good time. Oh, it was crazy, man. It was great. We had the wow going inside there. We had the chants going. All right. Everybody, man, a rock. All right, cool, man. All right, dude. Thank you, John. No problem. Be good, guys. You too, man. All right. There was a huge success yesterday. John's saying Mark sounds different. Is he sober? I lost a little bit of my voice last night screaming. Yeah, because you do scream really loud. You're not going to start. I don't feel good. I want to go home. Baby, baby, pick me up, baby. Yeah, baby will be here soon, Spaz. Where's baby? Oh, no, Spaz is baby. I can't see you, baby. It's getting cold, baby. Come, precious, where are you, precious? Easy, easy. There you go. Easy. It's funny. All right, now let's regroup. All righty. Let's clear the phone lines and get something else going on here today, okay? Did anyone else see the big yellow, precious loves Nana sign on Raw? I did see that. It was also another one. I'm over here now, precious. There's a bunch of precious signs. I just didn't feel like bringing that up today. Picking up the ball and running with it. We appreciate that. That's funny. Oh, about that precious break yesterday. Yeah. So my mom, she doesn't really listen to the show a lot. Good thing. Just not her type of thing, you know what I'm saying? I hear you. So I'm home last night and the phone rings. It's my mom. She goes, heard your show today? Uh-oh. And I'm like, I stopped breathing. I'm like, oh, you did? What did you hear today? I heard you talking about your sunburn at Grandma's house. I'm like, oh, my God. But that was definitely close to another break. That was the break right before the precious break. Yeah. So I quickly call up my brother because I guess my brother was driving around. And he goes, dude, I can tell it was starting to get ugly. And I went to my Jimmy Buffett tape. So my brother, who's listening right now, you shaved my ass. Thank you very much. Yes. Wow. So all right, let's take a break. You want to give out some tickets to see Dope, Anthony? Dope. This band Dope is really, really cool. We play them every once in a while on the show when we take music breaks and stuff. They have kind of a, I don't know, like a Marilyn Manson zombie thing happening. They're their own band. They're, you know, if I had to describe it, I would use like a little Marilyn Manson, a little zombie in there. Definitely. But they're definitely doing their own thing. This band Dope is playing the Bowery Ballroom May 31st. If you want to check out the show, we got a pair of tickets to the 10th caller at 212-757-1027. You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now. Please, hope you enjoy the show. Thank you. 1027-WNEW. Anthony. Yes? This just in from Marco from Long Island. I fooled around with Psycho Mark in the back of the N.E.W.D. van last night. He knows how to suck wank. I love him. Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fad burner. Yes, it works. It works. We've heard from listeners all over, all over the area. They've lost a lot of weight with Stacker 2. Maybe Spaz needs a Stacker 2. Maybe that's all he needs today. Well, yeah, I think if we pop the Stacker 2 in him, he would wake right the F up. Yeah, he'd take the edge off whatever he's on. Stacker 2 does the three things. It does give you a boost of energy late in the day. It crushes the cravings to snack in between meals. And of course, it burns the fat because they do call it the world's strongest fad burner, Anthony. Yes. All that adds up to losing weight. As this heat wave continues, you're going to want to lose weight, right? Got to shed the clothes and you don't want to be a big... All right, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fad burner. Give them a call. 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Stacker 2, the world's strongest fad burner. Our listeners have proven it works. O-P-E-N-N-E-R, Anthony. We punish ignorance. Hey, ass, turn down your radio. 1027-W-N-E-W. Ah, Tower's ass five star, mister. Let me out, let me out, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let me out, let me out, come on. I'm over here now. I'm over here now. It's the ONA show, 2127571027. Let's go to Foals. A lot of people checking in today, Anthony. John, you're next on NAW. Hey, Foals, what's up? Hanging out. Yeah, hanging out. Did you check out the Daily News today? I sure did. Front page, going. Did you get a wow on it? Wow made the front page today. I couldn't believe it. I had to call you guys and tell you guys about that. And it looks like whoever works at that, I don't know. It says Fort Lee, I think. In Fort Lee, it looks like they wrote the wow on there for us. Oh, man, that was perfect. That was perfect. You guys made the front page. Yeah, we're talking about the lottery thing. Yeah, the notification on the ground. All right, thank you. Thank you, John. 325 mil, I guess. Yeah, up for grabs. And there's a picture on the front page. It shows 325 mil. And then under it says, wow. Yeah. It looks like one of the workers just kind of wrote wow. I think wow is self-explanatory. A lot of people didn't see the front page of the Daily News today because they had that special wraparound. Oh, I thought it would never end. That covered the Cardinal's funeral, Anthony. How many times do we have to see the one-legged kid? Well, on your nose. You want to bring up the one-legged kid thing? It's a cute little story and stuff. Cute, touching story. Let me tell you something, man. There's a picture on the paper of the Clintons hugging the kid. Yeah. Kneeling down and talking to the kid. Yeah. That is called a photo op. Right. They don't give a flying F. They don't give a flying F about one lousy crippled kid in St. Patrick's Cathedral. You got one leg. I have three. I'm like the human tripod. You know, Giuliani and his people are like, son of a bitch, get me the one-legged kid. Right. Because it looks good for Hillary. There's a picture of Hillary kneeling down with the one-legged kid from the Cardinal's funeral. She outdid me. Get me a kid without a head. Right. I want a headless child to hug. Oh, Hillary's always seen hugging and kissing things. It's a PR move and the paper, enough with this one-legged kid. Yeah. They're explaining how the one-legged kid, when the coffin was being carried downstairs there at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Anthony. How to get the wrap around. They were explaining that the kid jumped into the aisle and saluted the coffin. Yeah. And he was wobbly because he only has one leg and he needs both hands to keep himself balanced. But he let go of one crutch to salute the Cardinal and he almost fell over and everyone's like, oh, look at the cute little kid with the one leg saluting the Cardinal. Why don't you help him out and give him a seat? Everyone's just staring at the kid as he's wobbling and almost falling over. Help him out. Did it, was it made to look like some spontaneous thing? Like he just all of a sudden walked in the aisle? Yeah. I don't think so. No. I think they told him, you know, you hobble out there. And with all the politicians that were in that damn church yesterday, I don't care if you don't have any arms or legs, you're not getting close to all those politicians. Has he started the talk show circuit yet? I'm sure somebody will be interviewing the cute one legged kid. Cute little kid going to pop up on Letterman's chair or something. You know, I feel sorry for the kid's plight and all, but don't be fooled. What happened to the pig? He has a disease that I forgot the disease a little about today. Maybe Spass has that. He was born without a leg, Anthony. Oh, he was. He's got some liver problems. Poor little kid. I mean, his plight is pretty sad, but the politicians just with the photo ops. I mean, I hope you guys see through that crap. There's the picture of Clinton. Clinton has time to bend down and hug the kid and say a couple of words to him. How you doing? Look at the picture of him. And Hillary's smiling like, oh, I win. I win. Yeah, because there's a picture of Hillary next to the one legged kid. That's going to help her in the race. They have the whole layout of who's who at the funeral of who was sitting where. Look at that. Let's say first lady Hillary behind Hillary was a Pataki. Gore next to her. Clinton next to her. Where the hell is Rudy? No, Rudy was sitting pretty much right next to the president. I think there might have been one person in between them or something. Who's that? George Bush was on the other side of the aisle. Yeah, they wouldn't know. Look at that. Isn't that funny? They popped him over there. I can't find out where Julie Haney is in this. He was right there. I believe he was right next to the president. Yeah, that's what I think. This is a little weird. You think they would have put him on the other side with his big, palugal whale head. Look at that. Hey, you know what's funny? They were showing some old clips of Cardinal O'Connor. And they have some old clips of him with his big, palugal whale head. And they have some old clips of him with Julie Haney. And oh my God. I mean, you look from years ago, you kind of forget. He had a little more hair covering that big balloon head, that light bulb head. And now it's just in full retreat. That Simon Barsinister globe of his. Now his head is a light bulb. It is shaped exactly like a light bulb. Where's a light bulb? I want to draw a little Julie Haney face on it. It would look just like him. Poor guy. I think that's going to hurt him. His chances of winning. But just the way he looks, you know? I don't know. He's going to... He's got that prostate thing. It's just a mess. Yeah, but he's more human than Hillary. Believe it or not. I know that's a scary statement, but he is. I guess they're saying during the debates and stuff, he's faring much better than her because his human side comes out. Yeah. He has emotion, whether you like it or don't, he at least has something you can understand. Human emotion. Yeah, Hillary just stares with those big eyes and you can tell she's just not there. Like it's like... Sideboard. Like Louis Black says. Yep. She doesn't have an emotion in her body. Yeah, sideboard. She doesn't care about the people of New York. She just cares about her own damn career. No. I swear to God. Is that breaking news? Breaking news. The police commission has prostate cancer. Howard Safer. Howard does? Howard Safer has prostate cancer. Is he a MetFan or Yankee fan? Does anyone know? I want to see if he spazs his theory. All right. So enough with the one-legged kid. Yeah. They're going to be parading him all over the place now. Talk shows. We'll be on the lano, Letterman. Letterman will have the one-legged kid. Can we get him, Rick? Book the one-legged kid. I want him on this show. Yeah, that'll happen. All right. We got to take a quick break, Anthony. Wow. The phone's going nuts. Well, we're trying to catch up. The whole spaz sickness thing put us behind here. It certainly did. We're going to do another wow sticker stop today, Anthony. But we have to be incognito today. Yeah. So... Oh, really? I'm trying to give out a hint. We'll be somewhere between like 530 and 630. Can't say where, though? Hmm... We can't say? What? Where are we going to be with the sticker stop? Well, how the hell is anybody supposed to get there? Well, it's going to be at an event. Okay. Let me see. Let me see. Ah, screw that. The cops will help us out up there, right? They're worried about the cops up there. We just want to give out our wow stickers. You're not going? No, just slow. The sloth. The sloth. The sloth is going to give out some stickers. The sloth is heading to Yankee Stadium today. There you go. Yankee Stadium, before the game tonight, get your wow stickers. The sloth. We're going to be incognito, though. We're going to have some backpacks because we're just going to be walking around hanging them out, okay? All right. All right. Speaking of the sloth, has he made it to work today? The three-toed sloth. We have Earl's Air Check. We have Earl's Air Check tape from Saturday. Ah, the sloth live on the air. Yes, the sloth show. A lot of people said that Earl did a rock and roll radio show Saturday night. Help me. Help me. Help me. Somebody help me. Help me. Help me. And a lot of people said it was very entertaining, so we searched all over the damn place and we found a couple breaks, Anthony. Oh, Lordy Long, he's desperate. Do what he says. Do what he says. So Earl's Air Check from Saturday. Excuse me while I whip this out. We'll do that next. Stay there. Some days, you know, for a laugh riot and other days we just flat out suck. We know it. Interesting. Interesting. Hopefully he has answers today. Oh, 27. It's the Ominous Show. Russ from Jersey Rides. Hey, fellas, welcome Trent Reznor in New York City for me. Nine Inch Nails at the Garden tonight. It's going to f'n rock. Yeah. And Nin playing Nin. Nin. I did that. Oops. Nin, dude. Just trying to be cool and rock. Nin playing tomorrow at the Coliseum. I can't believe I said that. Nin. Nin. You rock, dude. Yeah. Maria just got wowed. Maria, what's going on? Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm okay. Look at the nastiest thing happen to me. First of all, I was in my sister's car. I was somewhere in the Bronx. And I had given her, I had written down wow on a piece of paper, real pretty. And I said, just put it on your windshield. She goes, so what for? I go, if they see it, they're going to win $1,000. So she put it on and she goes, oh, okay, we'll see. So we were on the freeway and the nastiest thing happened. This old lady drove by and honked her horn. And she pulled out her thingy. It was so nasty. And my sister looks at me. She goes, what was that about? So then I had to tell her about the what. She got pissed off at me. All right. So you got wowed by an old hag. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you. That was a great little story, Maria. All right. All right. Earl in the back office, hard at work getting those wow stickers out. The self-addressed stamped envelopes just coming in like fan mail for the Hanson Brothers, man. It's just ridiculous at this point. Hanson going for a new image, OP. Yeah, I know. Did you see that? They're all over all these magazines now trying to make their big comeback. Yeah. With the fickle 13 and 14-year-old girls who have gone over to all the boy bands now. Yeah. Now Hanson's got to come out with a new album and they have a new grown-up image, OP. I've been keeping tabs. They cut their hair and stuff, Anthony, to try to help them. I don't understand how bands think it's going to help their popularity when they cut their hair and stuff. Yeah. Like Metallica went through that whole thing. Now let's change our image and they come out with short hair and stuff and that's supposed to make the album rock that much harder or something. I don't get it. Yeah. The only difference I see is Frank and Hanson's got his braces off. Mm-hmm. And the young one looks more like Shaka from Land of the Lost than ever. J-Mor brought that up and I looked at the magazine that they were in and it was like, oh my God, he's a TV guide or something. Yeah. It's like, oh God, he's right. And they're all like Christian and stuff. They're all Christian and stuff. I'm not laughing at you anymore, Anthony. I know. They're going to be pissed when they get older and realize how much quim they turned down. Yeah. Earl, what's wrong? Earl, what's the matter, man? Earl's in the studio. He's giving me this look like he's going to get to me. Oh, wait. What are you holding? Put down the knife. Oh my God. It's a letter opener. Oh my God. It looks like a knife. Put down the knife. You could do damage with that. Oh, help me. Why the nasty look, Earl? I think I caught what Spaz has got. What? What? Ouch. Oh, man. Oh, come on. Man. I'm going to get paranoid. Why? What happened? I'm just feeling a little sluggish. Sorry. Feverish. What? Sluggish and feverish. You killed him. I killed him. Earl, just so we know, how can we tell if you're sluggish? Just so we know. There may be a day you're sluggish. If we know the telltale signs that you're sluggish, then we'll know to leave you alone. What? Stop stabbing the console. You don't threaten me. So what? How would we know? You are awful, man. What? I thought we were all just having fun, right, Earl? You want to have a stare down? No. I'll take you on on a stare down. Just trying to fight this thing off. Huh? Just trying to fight it off. Now, how does it feel like? I don't understand. No, I'm just like, I'm losing my voice. You're losing your voice. You're feeling tired. Sneezing fits. Sneezing fits, uh-huh. And very sluggish. You're a little bit... So is this sickness hindering your job today? Not at all. No. You're able to open up the envelopes and put the wow sticker and the self-addressed stamped envelopes that our listeners are sending in. I'm almost finished with today's batch, actually. Are the batches getting more or less? About the same. About the same every day? About a box a day. About a box a day. Very good. Nice. A few hundred stickers going out every day, right? Yeah, easy. Easily. All right. Any suggestions if people want to get their wow sticker to make your job easier now that you're a little sick and under the weather? Just a little more sluggish than normal. You don't want to go up to Yankee Stadium tonight? Is that why you're sick? I'm going. You're going? Mm-hmm. To hand out the wow stickers? Mm-hmm. Go visit the sluggish Earl at Yankee Stadium. The sloth. Oh my God. I don't think he appreciates that name. Well, I said that we would stop calling you the sloth after today, right? Earl. Tomorrow. Yes. Tomorrow. Earl. Yes. Know how many people are calling me precious? If I can handle people calling me precious... I think you can handle people calling you the sloth for a few days, right? Easy. Hey, precious. Easy. Easy. Hey. Easy. She sent me to high-bemond and sweet-tale-can-share Shut up! Why are you moving like a sky? I'm all over you Shut up! And if I can't find my way back home Why can't you see me there? I can't find you! I can't find you! I'm all over you Can we see your stuff? Enough, cut it out, man. See, I'm taking my abuse, Earl. I saw you smiling over there. Smanky, it's time to take your medicine oil. Earl, we found your radio show from Saturday night. You're going to get prime time today. What? I told you where it was. It was off the skimmer. Well, we found it. Earl did a shift, I guess, Saturday, was it? I smell an ambush, but... Whoa, an ambush? We're going to be bushwacked! Mike, what's going on? Hey, what's going on, guys? How are you? Not bad. I know why Black Girl's feeling sluggish today. Why? They had blue on all those self-addresses and bomb-blobs, just like on Seinfeld. He's probably licking too many envelopes. Better watch out. He's going to pass out soon. He's going to be all fallen over, falling down. He's not going to know what to do with himself. Earl, is it bad glue? No. I think it's more allergies than anything. More allergies? The pollen in the air is getting to you? Yeah, right. That's what they all say. Earl, do you want to go home early today? I know you put in a solid hour already, but... Two days in a row. Do you want to go home early? Do you want to work to five? How many hours a day do you put in, Earl? I put in eight. I'm here until 11. I run down to Mike. Three to 11? Yes. All right, so can we play your air check from Saturday? We heard you had a really good radio show. From Saturday, yes. You want to be a rockin' old DJ? No, not at all. Really? I was absolutely terrified Saturday. You want us to call up the Q for you? Maybe you could get a half hour shift? You can do it right after Scotso's show. Right. The Scotso and Earl hour and a half. All right, I'm leaving the mic now, handing it over to the capable hands of Earl. On the Q. Hey, Earl. Coming. Virgil. Yeah. That's what we're calling the Earl show. Virgil. Virgil. Okay, coming. That letter opener is a jazzy bit. Well, we're going to take a break, Earl, and then we're going to play your radio show from Saturday. I hear you were howling after Guns N' Roses song. You got so excited you had a howl. Oh my God, no. Stop it. Stop it now. You know what actually happened was? A K-Dog type howl? Maybe K-Dogs got rabies. Are you a K-Dog wannabe? Hurt. Oh my God. Imitating the spazmeister? No, that came after... Howl! That came after I finally got an answer from someone regarding what to do because... No, I heard that you were... this is what I heard. I heard that you had a problem in the studio and you were blaming an imaginary person. What? An imaginary person? That's what I'm hearing. I haven't heard any of this. No. What happened? Is that true or what? I heard you had some type of technical problem or something in the studio going on and you figured I better blame someone because I look kind of stupid here. So you were blaming an imaginary person. You were yelling at someone. They can believe they were the problem. And John was here, the dumb guy, and said that there was no one in sight. Is that true or not? Oh. Like he screwed up the buttons a little bit and he's yelling. Right, right. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what? Wait, what? No, you can't do that. Cut it out. I'm trying to do a show here. Bob. Bob. Who was this person that was wrecking your radio show? Wasn't wrecking. It was a friend of mine. Oh my God. And his name? I'd rather not say. Because there was nobody. Someone go get John. John can. John the intern. John the intern? Yeah. John. You have an imaginary friend, Earl. No, I don't. John, who was Earl yelling at Saturday? No, he was the only one in here. You were the only one in here. You were sitting there playing air guitar. Oh, Tony Pegg was in here and he was the only other person. But he left early. So when Earl was yelling and stuff, blaming a screw up on somebody, that person wasn't in the studio? Wasn't in here. I didn't see anyone. I was in the other studio. I saw him playing air guitar through the glass. Why were you playing air guitar, Terrell? I was having guns and roses. I like guns and roses. Yeah, alright. That's okay. He was playing some good music, though. Alright, we'll get into Earl's air check next. Earl. Earl, can we hear the howl? Yeah, go ahead. No, a live howl. I can't do a voice laugh. I can't even do it if I wanted to. A virgin. Alright, let's play his air check next, okay? Yeah, I want to hear that. Earl, would you like to stay in the studio for this or would you have to open up more envelopes? Just asking. Want him to go out today or not? Oh, I get threatening me. No, I'm just, no, I'm not meaning it. It's not meant as a threat. I probably would finish. Well, it usually takes you how many hours to put 200 envelopes in the mail? It's more than that. I'm telling you, we're getting a lot of mail. Which is a good thing. Alright, Earl. Did you have this kind of energy during your show? I'm not feeling well. I'm just trying to find... What the heck? Is that what it is, Earl? Earl, you're certainly living up to your new nickname right here. Just a little sluggish, a little slow. Hey, it's Earl on the morning zoo. Hello? Hello? He's not going to help you. Thank you, Lord. Praise Jesus. Is the pressure of the job getting to you, Earl? Not at all. No? The ridicule is, yeah. Ah, the ridicule's getting to you. All of a sudden, if you get a certain amount of ridicule on this show, you get sick, physically sick, and you've got to go home. A lot of people going home lately because of this show. I'm just tired. Are you going to be the next one that runs out of here? He already has. Oh yeah, you have done that a few times. Alright, now I want to take a nap. Thank you, Earl. This was a good segment. I told you how I feel. Could you leave your phone off the hook so we could at least call you as you're doing the wow envelopes? So we could make some comments about your tape to you? I can tell you everything that's wrong with it. Almost everything. I'm not wrong with it. We just want to hear it. What is Judy saying really fast? Judy, what's going on? I was listening to a show. I don't know. Another DJ came on when he was playing from pretty heavy stuff, and he goes, yeah, I'm an in-the-closet headbanger. An in-the-closet headbanger? An in-the-closet headbanger? Anisey! For the love of God, I hope we have that on tape. He said he's an in-the-closet headbanger. Oh yeah. You're a closet headbanger? Penises! Yeah! Butt sex! Penises! You're gonna have to find it. Butt sex! All right, Judy, we will find that. Okay. Thank you. Bye. A closet headbanger. Ouch! Do you want to come out of the closet and admit that you bang heads or what? Penises! I'm gonna go now. Okay. Earl, everyone. There he goes. There he goes. Earl, everyone. Headbanging closet. I'm gonna... All right. It's already taking ten seconds to get out of the studio. Earl, everyone. There he goes. Ladies and gentlemen. Oh, Lordy Lord! He's desperate! Do what he says! Do what he says! Penises! And finally, Earl, everyone. There he goes. It took him 25 seconds to walk out of the studio. It's very hard, the three-toed sloth. It's a seven-foot walk. Do you ever watch a sloth on the Discovery Channel climb in the tree and you're just like, huh, get off the goddamn tree already! One hand over the other. Ooh, there is his little three fingers gripping the branch ever so slowly. Back leg, let's go! Up above the next back leg. All right. A bunch of people from this radio show got some good things going on tonight. Jay Moore on Politically Incorrect Tonight. Yeah, I was pissed off. I turned it on last night. I never watched that show because that host, what's his name? Bill Maher. Bill Maher is a C. He's just an ass. Yeah, he's a douchebag. He's whatever. Louis Black has his special on Comedy Central tonight. I don't know what time that's on. Ten o'clock tonight on Comedy Central. Otto and George playing Rascals tonight, right? I'm not sure if it's a sold out show, but I believe it probably is because no one has called us on it. And I guess it's going to be on the internet live tonight as well, Otto and George. So a bunch of people associated with the show having some good stuff happening for them tonight, all right? Yeah. All right, we'll play Black Girls Radio Show from Saturday. We have like three quick breaks. Yeah. Like a total of like four minutes of audio, but I hear it's pretty good. We'll do that next. Stay there. How you doing? Hey, it's Clay.

Oh, hey, what's going on? Hey, how are you today? I just wanted to thank you guys. The woman talked me into the Tuesday Night Homoclub today at lunch at work. Ah, very good. Yes. And guys, be yourself a favorite. Check out Holloground and lestonswing.com. All right, cool. Later, boy. We'll do that. Thank you. There's a little website plug. One of the salespeople have ran down from upstairs. Ah, panicky. They're panicking a little bit. No, he's shaking his head. No, not me. We just don't know what it means. Check what local listing. All right. The salespeople are running around panicking a little bit. Feverishly going over the coffee. I mean, please. All right. The day goes by that we don't piss someone off around here. I don't get it. We're just trying to be a successful radio show. Giving it a whirl. Taking a whack at it. Yes. Oh, you got the headbanger comment from Earl? Here, put that on the shelf. Oh, cool. Is Earl coming back? Nope. He said he wouldn't come back? Stinky? He said, I ain't coming down there. Oh, are you doing an imitation of Earl? That was his exact lines, and I said they want you down there, and he doesn't want to go down there. Could someone get Earl on the phone? It'll take him a while to crawl back up the hall with those short little steps. All right, here's the headbanger comment from Earl from Saturday. Okay. Okay, Tara really knocked me out. I'm a headbanger. I'm a closet headbanger at heart. So we're going to crank it up even louder now. But, there. A short break. We're going to kind of have the unofficial start of Saturday Night Rocks. We got some cool stuff going on tonight. You can tell that he's like, Earl, keep your head down. Okay, terrific. Eddie Trunk sounded thrilled. Earl's a closet headbanger. Turn it here first. Penises. Butt sacks. Yes. Indeed. Oh, oh, help me. Butt sacks. Oh, lordy lord. Butt sacks. Oh, lordy lord. Penises. Earl. What? Oh, wow. The angry Earl. Hey, Earl, you got some energy to you there. All right, you woke up. What's up? You coming back down or what? We're just having fun with you. Huh? No. Why not, man? Come on, we'll listen to your show from Saturday. Yes. Some of your show. Why won't you come back down here? Well, I want to finish this mail. Earl. What's his name? Penises. Come on, Earl, that was funny. Come on. That's a little play on the word, M-A-L-E, Earl. You got it? Penises. Yeah. Earl, are you starting to feel like you're the only one that takes abuse on this radio show? No. Okay, so everyone's turning the barrel. The virgin. Didn't I take about an hour and a half of abuse yesterday? Yeah, but you called that self-inflicted. Precious. That's all right, though. Nothing like therapy on the air. True. You want to call me Precious? No. Want to get me back, call me Precious? I'm not going to call you Precious. Okay. We've got to get this thing done here. Earl, why can't you make a concerted effort to come down to this studio and where's Don? Is that Don on the phone? Come on, Earl. We heard the first part of your tape. We thought it was pretty good. Thank you. I just want to finish. I just want to knock this out. I'm Earl Kasem and now a long distance dedication. Earl, how are you going to play your tape if you're not here? Go ahead. Have fun with it. Can we keep you on the phone, maybe? Sure. It's a song about a dead sloth named Earl. How am I supposed to come out of an up-tempo number because I'm a closet headbanger into a goddamn sloth dying? Hi. We've got to play that now. Earl, I can hear that you're a little bit... It took Earl two hours to hang a picture, too. Ponderous. Earl. Earl, we can hear you opening up envelopes in the background. Yes, this is true. All right, Earl, let's play your little show here, okay? You had a little problem coming out of the Black Crow's record, didn't you? Yeah, they sequenced the record pretty poorly, so it just cuts off at the end. They sequenced the record poorly? The Black Crow sequenced their CD? The first pressing of Jake, your moneymaker, has bad sequencers. Isn't that called a cold ending opening? Yeah, in the biz, sure. A cold ending, and you have to be ready for it. Out cue. Cold. Right. Well, when the ending sustains and it ends cold... Heart to Handle doesn't end cold. It sustains. But let's hear the end of that. Can you get right to the end? I got it here. There's two copies in there, an old copy and a new copy. Well, I got the old copy. All right. Let's hear... No, hit six. First Earl had a problem. Track six. Go ahead. Hit end monitor. Here we go, Earl. It's a fade! It's a freaking fade! Earl, that's what we call a fade in the... I couldn't... I didn't hear it. Honestly, I didn't hear it. That's a fade. I didn't hear it! That's a fade. That's a fade. I didn't get a... I didn't hear it, guys. And why are the Black Crows cutting their goddamn son's head off? Hi. Earl. God, I wonder... All right, hold on. Where does it get, Earl? Listen closely. It's a fade. That gives you enough time, doesn't it? God, I didn't hear it. But whatever. Okay, very good. Maybe we can hear how Earl handled that. This is the legendary WNEW we're working out, right? Yes. No, I'm just asking. On the weekends, still probably proud to be the Rock of New York. Sure. Hey, anyone else want a radio show out there? At this point, we're just letting you know that we're going to be doing a radio show. We're going to be doing a radio show. We're going to be doing a radio show. Who's out there? At this point, we're just giving anyone a radio show. All right, Earl, let's play your tape. You're coming out of the Black Crows here, okay? All right? Earl? Yes. Okay, here's Earl from Saturday Night. Wow, that ended abruptly. Wow. Wow. Earl, could you cover yourself a little bit there? Just make believe it didn't happen in the background. Well, you just hit the room, man. Guys, I'm not a DJ. What are you on on WNEW in the number one market in the country? This is the legendary WNEW. I explained this yesterday. You know how many years and I had to wait to work here? Oh, my God, the dream of coming to WNEW. Boy, was that dream shattered quickly. I explained this yesterday. When I did the shift, I wasn't supposed to be doing an air shift. I was supposed to be running the best of a certain show. Come on! Where's my tape? Earl, you didn't hear the fade because of the invisible man that was helping him with the radio show? The invisible man, Earl. All right, here we go. Did you see Jesus in your sticky bum? Oh, yes. All right, here we go. 1027WNEW. Wow, that ended abruptly. 1027WNEW Black Crows with Hard to Handle. And we heard some zeppin' before that. Of course, Jimmy Page and the Black Crows coming to town. June 30th at the Arts Center down in Jersey. Jones Beach, July 10th. And there's a Ruhmert date in October at Madison Square Garden. Looking forward to that. And I'm looking forward to tomorrow, the Hoboken Spring Arts and Music Festival featuring Patti Smith and Ronnie Spector will be tomorrow. That's from 11 to 6 down in Hoboken. The van will be there. I'll be there. We'll have plenty of stuff to give away including... Whipple ball bags. No, not whipple ball. That's whipple ball. Soda. Wild stickers. T-shirts. We'll have a bunch of stuff. Make sure to stop on by the NEW van tomorrow at the Hoboken Spring Arts and Music Festival featuring Patti Smith and Ronnie Spector among many others. It's going to be great. The weather is going to be great. It's supposed to hit 94 degrees tomorrow. So if you've got nothing to do, come on down to Hoboken, check out the great music and hello to us at the NEW van. Coming. And coming up in a few minutes, actually I might play some Patti Smith, so stand by. Oh, wow. I got to stick around here. T-Smith, huh? Love radio T-Smith. Look at you, Earl. Earl, I must say that's not a bad break. That wasn't bad. Not bad at all. See, you're expecting us to abuse you, but it was pretty good. What was the thing with the whipple ball bats? Well, yeah, it sounds like you had a rocking party out there in Hoboken. Whipple ball bats and soda. Soda. Well, we had a couple clients had products to give away. We had these... What's that? Smart... SmartWorld.com. SmartWorld.com. SmartWorld.com. SmartWorld.com. Okay, terrific. Yes. And one of our clients, Sobe, we had cases of... Cases of soda and I think it was fruit juice. Earl's gay, terrific. So I heard you were throwing whipple balls out to the crowd, huh? Yeah, man, we were having fun with it. Okay, very good. Pretty good. A lot of people asked for you at Hoboken. Yeah, well, I don't think we're invited back to Hoboken. Well, they were saying, where's Sobe? He's probably watching a Nick game. Yeah, pretty much. I watched him lose this weekend, Earl. That wasn't a bad first break. Don't you like to mow by law? Earl, Jason from River Edge, New Jersey wants to ask you, did it take Earl six hours to do a three-hour show? All right, Earl, your first break is very good. We got two more to go here, okay? You think he can handle it? Go ahead. Well, on the Earl show, he teased that he's going to be playing some Patti Smith, you know? That's going to make me stick around through commercials and stuff. Yeah, you throw out something like that to the people, they're not going anywhere. You know, when the DJ says something from Boston's first album, Anthony, I'm glued. I can't go anywhere. Got to sit through those spots. I got to sit there and wonder if it's going to be four-played long time or peace of mind. Yeah. Or maybe even more than a feeling. Well, that would be nice. All right, Earl, here's your second break from your show Saturday night. 1027, 1027. WNEW ACDC, Who Made Who. Told you we were going to play a couple of guitar heroes. Ted Nugent, Steve Ray Vaughn Van Halen, and Angus Young & Company, ACDC on NEW. This is Earl Douglas. I kind of flew into the ship somehow, but I'm having a lot of fun. He said ship. Oh, he didn't curse? He said ship. Oh, you're cursing on the air? No. He said shift. He said shift. All right, I want to hear it again. This is Earl Douglas. I kind of flew into the ship. So I'm having a lot of fun. I'm going to try to get to some of your requests a little bit later on. If you want to make one, give us a call at 212-757-1027. 10 o'clock tonight, 80 Trump. Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere. Dinner! I just got distracted. I'm sorry. Oh, wait, Earl, is that the invisible man distracting you? You use your tongue prettier in a $20 hole. Hey, Earl. Earl? Earl, was that the invisible man distracting you in the middle of your radio show? Do we have it on tape? We got the invisible man on tape, Earl. No, a friend of mine was mugging me in the corner. Oh, bloodstains. Bloodstains? Bloodstains. Pain in the ass. Dinner! All right, Earl, we've got to play this again. Now explain what was going on. You were in the middle of a pretty good break there, right? Yeah. You seemed focused. You were talking about the Eddie Trunks Saturday Night Rock Show. Things were moving along there, right? Yeah. And then what happened with the invisible man in the corner? I was getting mugged and he was making funny faces at me. He was making funny faces? He was just like, I just lost my concentration. Do we know the name of this person? I thought you had to have something before you lost it. No, honestly, I promise not. I know this is going to come out. I promise I'm not the same. What was it, Scott Mutie? No. Coming by to visit his old haunt? Crap. All right, listen to Earl as he merges, as he gets distracted by the invisible man, Anthony. Here it is. We're going to try to get to some of your requests a little bit later on. If you want to make one, give us a call at 212-757-1027. Ten o'clock tonight, Eddie Trunks Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere. And I just got distracted. I'm sorry. But that'll be in around ten o'clock. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. I got to hear that again. Earl! You were being mugged? You know, when guys make funny faces. The invisible man was touching you? Stop it. I heard you were the only one in here, dude. Everyone is saying you were the only one in here and you were talking to yourself. No, that's not true. Liar. Liar. Were you there? Earl, here's the thing. It looks like that scene at the end of Fight Bill. Were you here? Ed Norton's pulling himself around the room. Help me. Help me. Help me, please. We need the invisible man on the phone so we can talk to him. He's kind of tough because he's not. Earl, here's a doll. He's not here. He's the only guy in New York. Opi, his name is George Glass. Not in New York. Well, John is screaming. Our intern John is screaming. He said he was here. He's a witness. I know he was here. He said there was no one in the studio. Oh, I saw you from the other studio. You were the only person in the studio at the time. There was no one else here. You were in here too. Yeah, and I came in how many times to get carts from the... He was on the air. He's like Jim Carrey in Liar Liar beating himself up. How many CDs did I come back and forth to get? You were the only one in here. Earl, the invisible man was touching you. Here's a doll. Show us on the doll where the invisible man was touching you. Did he touch you where your bathing suit covers? Let me hear that again because I want to hear how he really plays this off. All right, Kaelin from Brooklyn. Hey guys, I'm a 16-year-old high school student with no radio experience. When do I get my own show on any WNBA? Hey, come on in. All right, Earl, we're a little worried about you. You got invisible men distracting you and touching you. All right, I backed up the break. Everything was going okay until the invisible man showed up. Here we go. Later on, if you want to make one, give us a call at 212-757-1027. Ten o'clock tonight, Eddie Trunk, Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere. And I just got distracted, I'm sorry. But I don't be around ten o'clock to play the best hard rock and metal for you right here on any W. And we'll come back. Little deaf leopard. Earl, come on. Earl, what was the invisible man doing to you? What kind of face did he make? Butt sex. Ouch. Butt sex. Ouch. Earl? Earl? He's getting mad. Earl? Pain is in. Earl, this is too good. Do not become silent now. Tell us what the invisible man was doing that distracted you to the point where you had to tell him to stop it. Earl? Earl, come on. Come on, man. Well, maybe could it be that John didn't see the guy because the guy was under the console on the other side? We couldn't see what he... It's a possibility. Earl? Are you just staring into the receiver? Earl? Earl! Come on! Tell us what the invisible man was doing. You can be honest and tell us that there was no invisible man. We'll be okay with that. Earl? Earl, we'll just play the break over again. Earl, come on. Earl? Is he there? Earl? He's not coming up. No, he's still there. Earl, come on, man. He does this all the time. He gets really mad. He did five envelopes. He's on a union break now. He's got... All right, we're going to have to play the Earl break again with the invisible man. Here it is. Ten o'clock tonight, Eddie Trump, Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere. And... I just got distracted, okay? But, uh... Right here on ADW and we'll come back with a Death Weapon. Ouch! Ouch! Earl? Come on, Earl, I know you're there. Earl, can you hear me? We make more people run home early. I mean, no! What is it? Come on. Well, Rick ran down the hall to see if his phone is still off the hook. Now where's Rick? Whose microphone was Earl talking into? Well, all right, let's take a break. Yeah, we gotta find Earl. We gotta find Earl. This is a little weird. Oh, right, Rick's calling in, I think. I know it's Rick. Just put him on hold so we can talk to him. Thank you. Earl, what happened? I don't know. The phone hung up. I don't know. We just got it cut off. All right, we just need to know what was the invisible man doing or what kind of face he was making that would make you stop your radio show and say stop it. It was just, you know, like a silly face. Like what kind of silly face? We all know silly faces. Which one? You know, where you put your thumbs on your ears and do the... Yeah, that one. That one? Yeah, just very cynical, like, yeah, right. But yeah, right, and I'm like, not that. Hey! No, man, you reacted like he was tickling your kiki or something. No. Hey! I'm not going to even dignify it. Who is this imaginary friend? Hey, I'm not illibiting you to say. Are you sure? Why is that? You know you're not allowed to just have anybody come up here while you're doing a radio show. Is it somebody that used to work here? No, not at all. No? Do you see this person often? Actually, he's in for the weekend. He's in for the weekend. Is he near you now? No. Are you sure? Is he on the air here at any time? No, not at all. No. White or black? White. Guy? Yeah. Well hung? No. Mark Pereno? Stop it. All right, do you want to play the third break of Earl's show? Yeah, I got to hear the rest of this. Is the invisible man chiming in anymore? Yeah, is that it with the invisible man, Earl? Earl? You. We'll agree to disagree. We think there's an invisible man. If this is somebody that's really real, okay. Maybe we get the mummy or Nosferatu in the next break. Right. All right. I think this is the last Earl break, right? We only have three. WNEWAB. NEW1027. What? Was that you? Was that you wooing? Yes, that was me wooing. Wait, I got to hear the woo again. That was pretty good. We almost missed it. Here it is. B-W-A-B. Hey. NEW1027. Hey. God, I missed that band. Paradise City. It was a great piece in Rolling Stone. I believe it was. It was a great piece. It was a great piece. It was a great piece. It was a great piece in Rolling Stone, I believe, two issues ago. What Axl Rose has been up to. Apparently, they're making new music. Not the original band. Axl is making music and four producers, several band members, and what, about two years later? We might just actually get a new Guns N' Roses album sometime this millennium. Stay tuned. This is Earl Douglas, sitting in for Tim Tyrell. Eddie Trunk will be in at 10 o'clock. It's Saturday Night Rocks. The best variety of hard rock and heavy metal. I'm out of breath. I was playing a guitar in the studio. But Ed will be out at 10 o'clock. As usual, every Saturday night. And make sure you get this number down, 212-757-1027. Or if you want to call us, call 3877-6921-027. We'll take requests until 10 o'clock and even after 10 o'clock when Ed gets on the air. Why don't you get up? That was a good radio break there. Thank you. Georgia! It's Georgia! Pearl, are you thinking about teaming up with the Invisible Man to do maybe like a duo show? There's a lot of duo shows here at the N.E.W. Yeah. You need an on-air partner at this station. You've got Scott and Sid, Opie and Anthony, Don and Mike, Earl and the Invisible Man. Kimmy! Kimmy! Earl? The slot show. Earl? Earl? Earl? Earl? Hello? Earl? Hi. Hi. You're sounding good. Thank you. The Invisible Man thing was... I'm getting the hindsight here because I've got to go up to the stadium. The Invisible Man thing is a little wacky, but yeah. I mean, guys, I'm getting the hindsight to go up to the stadium. Unlike Psycho Mark, I've got work to do. Unlike Psycho Mark, you've got work to do. I can't go. I've got to do stuff for Ron and Finn. All right. Earl is going to be heading up to Yankee Stadium to give out wow stickers. Really? Earl, that shouldn't take you too long to get up there, right? I'm going to jump on the train. Oh, the train? Mm-hmm. Eddie Trunk from Saturday Night Rocks wants to comment about your show Saturday. Okay. Eddie? Kimmy! Eddie? Eddie? Yo. What's up? First of all, I just got in the car and I just want to say thanks. This is the most promotion I've gotten in two years. Yeah, there you go. I never had this many high profile mentions ever. I'm just trying to get a handle on when exactly in the show the Invisible Man break took place. The Invisible Man break? Yeah, Earl, was Eddie Trunk around when your friend was in here? No. No, huh? That's why I asked because I got in about 9.39 o'clock and Earl was solo at that point, so I just didn't know if that break was recorded earlier or later in his show. So Earl, all right, so let's piece this together. The Invisible Man was in the studio and he distracted you to the point where you had to tell him to stop it, so we're assuming he was fondling you or something. No, he was not fondling me. And then all of a sudden he... did he leave the station? It wasn't here that long. It was here five minutes. I thought he was in town for the weekend. Yeah, he was here for five minutes. So the Invisible Man was here for five minutes to distract you and then he left. Heard me on the air, popped in. Heard me on the air, popped in, said hello, left. All right, everyone... someone's got to go downstairs and check with the lobby, the records who signed in. Yes. We'll find out who this mystery man is. Yes. Eddie, we have a witness. John, our intern, was here and he was watching Earl as he was doing the Invisible Man break and said he was talking to himself. There was no one here. So that break had to come in the first half of his program then because I was driving in, and I punched on the station and I heard Earl on the air and I called him up. And, you know, normally I'm hearing, like, it's not that, you know, that's what... Well, anyway. Come out. But I said, Earl, what happened to Lycus? Because I knew he was running it and he said that the disc didn't show up, yada, yada, yada. And then I got in there and when I got there about 8.15, he was solo. So I don't know where that break took place. Earl? Earl? Yes. Any thoughts? No. When was the Invisible Man in the studio? I have no idea. Everything was just happening so fast. The Lycus disc didn't make it because they're not allowed to mail narcotics. Or the mail. Anything that might make you drowsy. Wow! Between 7 and 8, Earl? No. I don't know, guys. Earl? Do you see dead people? Thank you, man. I believe the Invisible Man was Martin Landau. All the evidence, Earl, points to an Invisible Man in the studio. Do you agree with this man? Oh, Earl, one more thing. Who were you having butt sex with? Oh, we lost Earl. He hung out. Did he hang out? He hung out. And who is this mysterious Timmy? You guys don't have the crossover break when Earl asked me to cross over with him, do you? Yeah, we do. Oh, God, I got to hear that. We said how thrilled you sounded, Eddie. Because I was just... First of all, the thing that I was... I'm coming in and basically most of the music that was on prior to me coming in was a recreation of a lot of the stuff I had planned on playing. I had to scrap a lot of stuff in my first hour because there was a lot of stuff that had started early. And the other thing was that I was like, hey, man, I spent 11 years making minimum wage and suburban radio. And Earl's doing six to ten the shit before me. I know. Well, Earl did a pretty good job. The invisible man thing was wacky. Obviously he got distracted. He was trying to cover himself up. And he's not man enough to admit it. A lot of people want to know how a three-toed sloth plays air guitar. In a lot of ways, you're right. I heard some of the breaks. I thought that he did do a pretty good job. But I did not hear the invisible man break. And that's why I was just curious if that was when I was there. It's funny because he starts giggling like a schoolgirl and says, stop it. We got the crossover with you, Eddie. When Earl admitted that he was a closet headbanger. Oh, really? Yeah, here it is. That terror really knocked me out. I'm a headbanger. A closet headbanger at heart. So we're going to crank it up even louder now. We've got a lot of these commercials. After this short break, we're going to kind of have the unofficial start of Saturday Night Rocks. We've got some cool stuff going on tonight. There you go. You sound so thrilled, man. It's like Earl's getting out of my studio. You didn't get the earlier part when I asked him how he was doing this. And my jealousy is that he just jumped right into a prime time weekend shift. Well, anyone could have a radio show at any W. Yeah, obviously. All right, Eddie. So we'll check out Saturday Night Rocks Saturday at 10. Thanks for the plugs, guys. All right, Eddie. Appreciate it. All right, there he goes, Eddie Trump. Come on! All right. Well, there's Earl's little radio show from Saturday. He took a lot of abuse. He did a very good job for a last minute filling in all that. I've got to find out who this person is, though, that he says was in the studio. There was nobody. There was nobody. There was nobody. There was nobody. It's a ghost. It's hilarious. The invisible man. All right, we'll take a break, right? There's a man on the wing. There's a man at the mic. There's a man in the studio. Can't believe it. All right. All right, man. The Opie and Anthony Show. You're never going to mount anything. It's awful. It's awful. Very, very effective. Just follow the straight to the airway. I cannot believe that those morons are on the air. I don't know, Anthony. I think this is better than a rock block, don't you? Only half as nauseating. It's the O&A Show, 2127571027. That was funny. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah, the Earl thing was very funny. Joseph Brino from FoundryMusic.com writes that Tom Likus discs did show up. Earl was just too lazy to get them, so decided to do a radio show Saturday. Very good, Joe. Hey, Peter, what's going on? Hey, what's going on, guys? How are you? Check it out. I look like Edward Norton's character in Fight Club. Talking to himself, hitting himself. Yeah, maybe he's got like a Tyler Durden. There you go. It was Tyler Durden in the studio with him. With Earl. All right. Got to be careful. Thank you. He swears there was somebody in the studio. Yeah, sure. Just like Tyler Durden was the same guy as Edward Norton. I can't say who it was, but he's a guy that sells soap, makes soap for a living, sells soap. My friend, we live in a house on Paper Street, falling apart. All right, thank you, Peter. Hey, can I get a plug? Yeah. My band, Stage, is playing at Bowery Bowl on May 25th. All right. All right, everyone check out Stage. Thanks, guys. Take it easy. Thank you. All right, Anthony, tomorrow is going to be a very exciting, wow day. Yeah. I mean, with this heat wave that's upon us. Yeah, now what is it supposed to be tomorrow? Have you checked the local weather forecast? I would assume like today. Tomorrow's weather, we'll be back later on the program to tell you. In that time, you could have told me. Here's the weather. Tomorrow, just like today. Yeah. Now let's do sports. Cool. I hope so. I hope it's blazing. Girls just walk in the streets nude. They're pretty much doing that right now. Yeah. I saw some sights at lunch today. Man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man. I love this time of year. I got to bring my night shot camcorder in again and try that again. With the girls wearing the black? Yeah, girls that are wearing the really, you know those very form-fitting black summer dresses? They're very tight. If you look through the night shot, which is like the infrared that I have on the camera, you're supposed to be able to see right through the clothes. See them naked. I have to do that. Have to do that. It was funny because when we used to drive in, you would drive and do that at the same time. Yeah, I was trying to drive and look at the same time and beeping at cabs. Yeah. Yeah. All right, but wow tomorrow is going to be huge. If you don't have your wow stickers yet, well, make the homemade wow signs. We love the homemade wow signs. We took phone calls from ladies last week for, I don't know, it had to be 20 minutes straight that swore if they saw a wow sign on the highway, they would wow. They just don't want to just wow. They don't want to just wow cars that don't have the stickers on it because they don't know who they are and stuff. Right. But if you get the wow on your car, you have a very good chance of seeing something. The ladies proved it last week. Yeah. You know, they're like, I even dressed appropriately to wow, but I couldn't find a sticker on my way home. No. So that's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow. And Paul, the pilot is coming in tomorrow. Yeah, the guy that Sky wrote wow over Manhattan. Over Central Park. It was huge. It was absolutely huge. Probably the sickest thing anyone has ever done for our radio show. Even though most visible. Even though a lot of people are trying to beat Paul already hanging banners over highways and stuff. The expressway. That's great. I was hoping Paul was going to do it again tomorrow, but instead we're going to like have him in here and treat him right. That's cool. For going the distance for the show and writing wow over Manhattan. Yeah. So he's coming in with Shannon, the hot wax girl, is coming back tomorrow. Oh, really? And Paul's going to be aiming on her belly. Oh, we're going to see how good he is at pilot to bombardier kind of thing. Yeah. Dropping some wax bombs on. We're going to see if he can like, you know, write wow in hot wax on her, the Norden bombsite on her belly. Releasing the big bomb out of the anode again. I got to say hi to a couple of cops that I passed on Coney Island Avenue. They didn't pull me over. Oh, my God, dude. I'm just getting brazen now. It's just a matter of time. Get this. I'm driving on Coney Island Avenue. They were in an unmarked car, which I thought was one of those goddamn cabs, you know. So a bus pulls out into the two lanes going in my direction, pulls out, takes up both lanes. He stops in front of me. There's a perfectly good left turn lane to my left. So I just pull in there, gun it, pass the cops and the bus and a couple of trucks that are in front and then whizz back into the lane. It gets right up on my ass. That's going on like, oh, oh, oh, oh. And then he kind of passed by next to me and stuff. And I guess everything is cool. Well, he saw what you had on your windshield. I don't know. Yeah, bastard. Hey, thanks, Frank. Where was all this? Get out of jail. Free car. Where was all this? This stuff when I was driving? I don't know. I'm just I'm minutes away from just driving down into the subway. Just trying to squeeze the truck down there. So subway platform. Anthony, this just in. Yeah. Black girl has officially been syndicated. No, in this company, black girl can be heard over the Westwood one radio network in every major city across the country. Yes, everyone gets syndicated except you and I here at any W. We'd like to welcome our affiliates in Los Angeles, California. I want you to know I'm a closet headbanger. Earl syndicated. Earl is officially syndicated, Anthony. Great. Yes. The Earl radio network on the from the top of the Earl building. That old gag. Oh, what a busy. All right. Well, Earl will be at the stadium for the Yankee game, handing out the Wow stickers today. A lot of great email that came in. I want to read a couple of these really fast. Someone wants us to play the Green Bay prank call funeral parlor. They want to get a copy of that. Oh, great. What? Where I look like a bad guy. What? Is that the one where I look like a bad guy from RCD to Menoworld? No, that's a great one. Oh, that one. I thought you meant the other one. No, we don't. I can't. I cannot find a copy of that. I'm really pissed off. Thank God. Because I always look like the psychopath on this radio show, but you've done some things in the past as well. We've said it many times. And Jay likes to go through the obituaries in the paper, find out where people are being laid out to rest. Well, I don't like to do this. It's a prank that I used to do as a kid. As a kid? We did it two years ago and I had a tape of it and when we got fired I couldn't get it out of my desk fast enough. And if you look in the obituaries of the newspaper and you see who just died and where they're going to be laid out and when, you wait until that time is happening. You call up and if the guy's name is John Smith, you just go, and a somber voice, is John Smith there today? Yeah. And they go, yes, yes, he is. You go, could you put him on the phone, please? And then you just wait for the uncomfortable silence. It's very uncomfortable today. Especially when the son of the deceased picks up the phone and starts really laying into you. There's a couple of websites that have it. Yeah. I will find a copy of that. Definitely. Oh, it's no worse than... That's me, Bill. I don't know what you're talking about. But I was just talking to... Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright. Bill? Oh, God, I love him. Did my condolences to the children. Okay, we played that one enough. I know, I love it. Yeah, that's great. Earl Tiller. Oh, he tells a woman that her friend is dead when she calls the cop. It's so bad. I got enough checks in the psycho column. Thank you very much. The management of Bell Atlantic has decreed that the posting of wow paraphernalia on company vehicles to be a violation of company policy that would lead to termination. Please inform the faithful followers of the Opie and Anthony show that the Bell Atlantic logo is the equivalent of a wow sticker. Oh, there you go. I like how you guys think. So, ladies, if you see the Bell Atlantic trucks and there's a guy that looks desperate driving... Bell Atlantic, whip him out. Help him out. He can't put the wow in his car anymore or on the truck anymore because he's going to get fired, okay? Cool. I don't want to play Bill's dead. Bill? Oh, God, I love him. Well, we do have a lot of new listeners. This is great. This is brutal. You know something? The whole concept of this is just part of the beauty of this whole thing, Opie. The woman's voice is what kills me. Once you hear it, you'll be doing it for years as a goof. Yeah, we do it all the time. Oh, no. Whenever something happens, like we get news that we're not going to be syndicated for another six months, we just look at each other and go, oh, no. What happened? We were just doing so well. You know, it could be incorporated into your everyday life. It's great. Oh, no. All right. Well, here's... But you said the reports weren't due until Saturday. Now we want it sent to me. Incorporated into your daily life. All right, here's Bill's dead, you bastard. Hello? Hi. Hi. Bill. Who's this? Pat. Hi, Pat. How are you? Now, this is the wrong Bill. Well, Pat, I have some bad news. What? Bill died today. You're kidding. Oh, my God. Yeah, tragic. Who is this? He was in a car accident today. Oh, no. Oh, no. Who is this? Who is this? John. John? Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, my God. I don't believe it. Yeah. I was just talking to him. I know. Oh, terrible. Where did this happen? This afternoon. Where? On the highway. Oh, God, love him. Yeah, big pileup. Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences. Okay. All right, John. You are awful. Bill. Oh, call up them. I was just... Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, precious. Is this precious? Oh, no. Precious. Where are you, precious? Shut up. But I was just talking to you. Precious. All right, let's try to do a mix here. Mix. Yeah. Let's start with this. Precious. Where are you, precious? I can't see you. Precious sent me you by the morning sweetly to Canberra. Hello. Hi. Hi. Bill. Who's this? Pat. Hi, Pat. How are you? This is the Varned Bill. Well, Pat, I have some bad news. What? Bill died today. Oh, my God. Yeah. Who is this? He was in a car accident today. Oh, no. Who is this? God. Shut up. Shut up. God. Oh, boy. Oh, my God. I don't believe it. I just turned into him.

Shut up. Touching. Yes. Very, very touching. Okay, terrific. Okay, horrific. Oh, my God. You have some issues. Aye, you brought it up. Bill. You're mixing in all the crap. Bill. Bill. Oh, man. Yeah. Oh, man. Yeah. OP, how could you be so cruel? Why? It happened years ago, right? Of course. Right? Of course. Right? You guys understand, right? OP, by far the most effed up individual on the ONA show. Oh, on the ONA show, yeah. I'm not even the most effed up one in my family. Gets a lot worse. I'm one of seven. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Wow. We go to some dark places in our family. Paulie, what's going on? You guys just made that song up on the radio now? Yeah. That was the sickest thing I've ever heard in my life. You guys are crazy, man. You could almost put that on the album and sell it in the store. Almost. On publication today. Yeah, that'll happen. Thank you, Paulie. Take it easy. Bye. Oh, my God. Look at the things coming in all the way. Oh, my God. Look at the things coming in. Opie has no soul. Opie going to hell. What? What happened? I don't know. It strikes a nerve every time we play that. All right. We'll go to the phones next. Stay there. The Opie and Anthony Show. Prone men jumping all over each other. Okay, terrific. 107. W-N-E-W. And a lot of people ask, where did the okay terrific come from, Anthony? Yeah. It came from that little sweeper you just heard. Okay, terrific. Jimmy put that together. He puts like hundreds of those together for our show. Yeah. We just casually threw it on the radio. I didn't think much of it. And then all of a sudden everyone started saying, okay, terrific. Okay, terrific. Where is he? There he is. That ain't it. I just scared myself with you getting shot. Okay, terrific. Wow. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Retard on Family Double Dare. Come on, people. We had a dump out of the show. Let's go to Daniel. Daniel, what's going on? Yeah. I was just flipping through the channels and I go to, and I'm just like flipping through and I see Nickelodeon as Family Double Dare. So of course I just sit down and I watched like four or five minutes of it. And so they got this girl and we didn't like know it at first that she was retarded. But they said Special Olympics and my brother and I just looked at each other, cracked up, and she was trying to get through that obstacle course at the end. Oh, no. And it was just so funny. Oh, you fool. Because everyone else was like diving, people were trying to walk. It was hysterical. It was hysterical. What are they doing that for? Let's do a pressure for the retarded. Yeah, I know. It's not right. You know, like the Special Olympics, they're pretty easy, right? Yeah. You know, it's like you run a race. You point them in a straight line and they run. I actually got a little joke for you guys. Yeah. What's better than winning gold at the Special Olympics? Not being retarded. Walking. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. All right. Syndication win. Spaz uses 8% of his brain. Okay. Bye. Is there something like Family Double Dare? You ever watch that show? It's a little too confusing. It's hard enough for people of normal intelligence to get through those obstacle courses. And then the host is like going, okay, now this one. Now, grab the flag. Grab the flag. Can you imagine a poor retarded kid trying to get through that? Yeah. I know it's not politically correct, but you see, you know, a retarded kid doing that on TV? Yeah. I hate to say it. You're going to laugh. Yeah, you are. You're going to make believe that we're all mature enough not to laugh and watch it for what it is and stuff. But the fact is you're just opening yourself to be laughed at. That is horrible. I know that's really harsh, but that's the truth, right? Who in their right mind watches something like that and goes, oh, isn't that wonderful? Yeah. Isn't that wonderful? Look at that. What a courageous moment that is. You're laughing. It's wrong, but you're laughing. Yeah, that's probably why they put him on. Jimmy! Oh, yes, Jimmy. Let me out, let me out, come out. All right, quick break. We'll be back. What's that, a train? What's that, a train? OB and Anthony, 1027WAW.
