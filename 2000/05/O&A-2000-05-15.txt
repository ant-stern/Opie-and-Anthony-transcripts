 OP and Anthony, 1027 WNEW. 212757 1027 is our phone number. Jeff's on the line real fast. Jeff, what do you got? Hey man, great joke. Hey, thanks. Hey, I got a joke. What do you call an Ethiopian with a yeast infection? Uh, what? Quarter pounder with cheese. Did we ask for Ethiopian jokes today? Huh? Very good. Thank you, Jeff. Alright, thanks man. Alright buddy, there he goes, Jeff. We're not going to be taking Ethiopian jokes all day, are we? Uh, no. I think that's the type of things they do on morning radio in the middle of Ohio or something. Hehehe, wacky. So Anthony, did you see Jay Moore on Politically Incorrect Friday? We finally got to see Jay Moore. Yeah, it was on Friday. No one knew when Jay was going to be on, so we all painfully watched Politically Incorrect every day last week. I watched it right up until when they announced who was going to be on. When I saw Jay wasn't going to be on, I tuned out because that show is a waste of time. Bill Maher is just a jerk off. He's just not a nice guy. He doesn't like anyone out staging him. Yeah. Doesn't like anyone that gets big laughs over him on the show. And he's horrible. He does that monologue at the beginning of the show. Well on Friday he did a monologue dressed as a gladiator. This thing was so freaking painful to watch. Yeah. It's not even funny. I mean you and I, we're off the cuff trying to be funny. We know there are a lot of times we just don't hit the mark. We understand that. But Bill Maher, you know, this is all written beforehand. Yeah. Doesn't he read the material and go, wait, this just isn't funny? I didn't even get half of the things he was trying to do. Was he trying to be John Rocker dressed as a gladiator? Like was that kind of the premise of the bid? I didn't even know. I don't know. And it was just awful, painful to sit through. It was horrible. And then he has this psycho babble. He doesn't know much about anything. No, and he's holier than now because whatever his opinion is, is the right opinion. Yeah. Like everyone else can add in their two cents on the panel, but his is the right opinion to have. The most important. Yes. What a tool. Jay saved that show. Oh, without a doubt. I was on Friday because, god damn, he was funny. Yeah. But you could tell Bill Maher wasn't happy that Jay was getting all the laps. No. But we have a couple of OK Terrific mentions from the show, Anthony. Yeah, Jay said he was going to do a few things on the show, reference this show, OK Terrifics. Well, the first one, I guess they were talking about condoms. Yeah. And Jay came up with something that was pretty funny where like, you know, no one's in a four-year condom relationship. Yeah, yeah. You know, after a few times using the condom you just go, oh, this chick's okay. Yeah, this chick's cool. You know? Yeah. Or she's from Minnesota. What can she possibly have? You know, Jay Moore, not a fan of condoms in general. So I guess we pick up the discussion in the middle of that and check out for the OK Terrific here. You talking about a good game, man. No, no, no. Let's keep it real. You said after the eight time, now let's keep it real. After you live with somebody, that's when you say, oh, she's cool. No. That's not what people are doing, no. He's right. People go, they use a condom. I don't think it's eight. I think it's once. It's three or four. I think it's like they use it once and they go, well, I wouldn't. And then when she walks in the bathroom, you see her ass going in the bathroom like, I don't have another condom, but look at that ass. You're like, okay, terrific. You got it, you know. Oh, it's like that, huh? Yeah, what's up? Hey, why? Why? I guess unless she's a black porn star named Velvet. Then you don't even wait one or two times. Then you don't need condoms whatsoever because she's obviously safe. Coolio had some chops to him. Coolio, keep it real. I would love to get Coolio on the show. Keep it real. He was funnier than Bill Maher. He's not even a comedian officially. Let's keep it real. No, when you live with somebody, it's like Coolio, but wait a minute, Coolio. That isn't the way it is. You know, Coolio is talking about the way maybe it should be. But that's not the way it is. People aren't using condoms. All right, and then the second, okay, terrific, which was the highlight of the whole show because it worked perfectly, Anthony. This is how you use okay, terrific in a sentence, okay? Let's go to the tape here. I mentioned in our last segment, in the womb premature babies, that stuff. Interesting, there's a big study that came out this week that said, you know, they've had technological advances in recent years that have allowed these preemie babies very premature, up to 14 weeks, to survive. And now they're finding that when they keep them alive by these heroic means, they grow up with incredible problems like cerebral palsy, autism, learning disabilities, blindness, deafness, you name it. And, you know, I just think that that's playing God. People say the other way, you know, that if you stop a life, that you're playing God. But aren't you also playing God if you enable a life that apparently, God never meant to happen? Well, if you go into labor, it's kind of meant to happen. No, I mean, if a woman goes into labor, it's coming out. But hold your applause. Don't all clap now, it'll screw up the time. Okay, terrific. Yeah, no, that's right, now, God wants to kill us, God will kill us. Okay, terrific. Oh, Bill Maher, what an idiot. Okay, terrific. Is it back playing God? If you were born premature, you weren't supposed to be here. What an idiot. I got two kids in my family that were born premature and they're perfectly healthy. Well, then Jay went into the whole thing of how he was born premature. Yeah, supposedly, Jay Moore, when he was born, like, his body could fit in his mom's hand. He was like a baby kangaroo when they're born and they have to crawl all hairless up into the pouch. They have to make the journey from the vag to the pouch. They're all looking blind, just crawling, looking for a teak. Looks like he was really premature. I think he said like two and a half months premature. It was ridiculous, premature, yeah. His lungs weren't working, he had pneumonia all the time. And there's Bill Maher saying that, you know, they shouldn't live. And I just flat out hate Bill Maher, hate him with a passion. I'd like to have hit him in that big wall forehead of his. He thinks he's the funniest guy on TV. Funny yet knowledgeable, L.B. He's so smart. Craig Kilborn's funnier than him and that's not saying much. I think Jay needs to get back to the NyQuil because he was shaking and twitching like a crackhead in Harlem. Well, let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. They caught the famous Jay Moore twitch on live TV. We see that in the studio all the time when he comes in to see us. All of a sudden he'll just do that on my face. Maybe that's the premature thing. Yeah, I don't know. He killed though Friday and it was great to see that. Funny. All right, let's move on to other stuff here. 212-757-1027. Don, what's going on? Hello. Hey, Don. I was at the Knicks game yesterday and Tom Brokaw was there. Yeah, Tom, a big Knicks fan I guess. We saw him when we went. I went to the one and only Knicks game I ever went to in my life. He was there with some young lady and she was following him out to the concourse area. Then they were following him back after about 20 minutes and he couldn't find his seat. He was like, so like... Where's my seat? Yeah. So you're trying to say that Tom Brokaw was drunk at the Knicks game. He looked good. No, that's just him. That's just Tom. He just gets woozy and working so hard. I'm going to go do some shooters. Hello, here's the Knicks game. Hey, give me another beer. Beer man, get your ass over here. I'm Tom Brokaw, here's the Knicks game. Hey, I'll chug with you. Come here. Holy crap, I'm snotted. This is just in. I'm drunk off my ass. I'm going to puke on Star Jones' head. He was sitting behind Star Jones when we went. Well, that's where his season tickets are. And he looked all trashed and everything. He just looked... I think that is just the way he looks. You know? He's got that drunken... Well, because he just works his ass off, man. You know? How about that Charlie Ward? Yeah, he saved the game yesterday, Mr. Brokaw. Saved the game? I was kind of dozing. You were dozing? I'm probably pushing it again. You had no idea that Charlie Ward was the hero of the Knicks game yesterday? Actually, I wouldn't even know who that is if you didn't write the name down. All right, well thank you, Don. We lost Don? Yeah. Knicks looked good yesterday. Ewing didn't really help us. Blah, blah, blah. Useless piece of crap. Tom, you all right? Hello. Tom, you all right? Yeah, I just scored some heroin. I was shooting up some H before the... All right, let's go to Bert. Hey, Bert, what's going on? Hello. Bert? Yeah. How are you? Hey, Anthony, how are you? Good. You're on the air, man. I was watching that film, Boss Show, and I noticed that that tight-butted, in-coster was looking at your boy up and down, especially when he said he was born... I was wondering if he'd be there after the show. Bert, I've got to ask, and don't take this personal. Is it your phone, or do you have a stuttering problem? It's a phone. Oh, okay. I couldn't tell. Part of me thought you might have a stuttering problem. I could. All right, so what were you saying? I wanted to know if your boy drilled Ann Coulter. Oh, you wanted to know if he drilled Ann Coulter? He was working those two chicks. He was totally working those two chicks. He was a tight-ass Republican Christian, and as soon as he told that he was a millionaire, he arrived lit up, man, so I was just wondering if he was... Yeah, he likes telling everybody he's a millionaire. Yeah, huh. All right, take care. I think he has a stutter, Opie. Yeah, when that one chick said that she had a gun, Jay was like, oh, you just got hotter. And then he turned to the other chick next, and was like, oh, you're hot, too. I know, he was trying to work both chicks at the same time. Completely working it. Hey, Brian, what's up? I think he told Coolio he was hot at one point. He never knows. Brian? How are you doing? Good. I just want to find out how I get in touch with that hit, Bill Maher, because of this comment. I was born with a congenital heart problem, 23 right now, and I got some problems, but I'm perfectly fine. I go to work every day. What, were you preemie? Yes. I had a couple of heart surgeries, and you know what, I'm fine. You're fine, and you're working, and contributing to society. He's just an idiot. Yeah, I wouldn't put too much into what he says. Don't even worry about it. He's trying to be controversial, I think. I don't know. Ann and I interviewed him in LA, and it was the lamest celebrity interview we ever did. That show should be off the air. We're like, hey, Bill, your show's called Politically Incorrect, you know? Who's your most politically incorrect guest you've ever had on the show? I don't want to talk about anything. I don't like talking about the people on the show. Politically incorrect, you shoot from the hit, Bill Maher, you'll say pretty much anything. You're not one to shy away from a subject. Who's the biggest a-hole in Hollywood? Who would you think is the biggest a-hole? What's this line of questions? What are you talking about? I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything about anybody. It's like your show's called Politically Incorrect. Don't think so much about yourself. Get off the shit. Yeah, probably because the answer was him. He couldn't say himself. All right, Brian. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you. This was during the time when the OJ trial was going on, and he wouldn't even give us a, do you think OJ's innocent or guilty? Right, we asked everyone out there that question. And he's like, wow, you know, I think we all should wait for the... No, no, no. What do you think he'll be acquitted or found guilty? What do you think? What do you personally think? I'm not going to get into the whole thing. Oh, wow, you're real politically incorrect, aren't you? That Bill douche ass. That was scary when we were out in L.A. during that whole thing. Every single celebrity we asked that question. They would not. They refused to answer the question. They refused to answer the question, I think. Yeah, Paul, he didn't care. Oh, he's guilty. Guilty? Oh, bro, a guy who's guilty is sin, bro. It's obvious. He's a weep. So... Yeah, he was the only one that would actually fess up. But everybody else is so, well, I think we ought to wait for the jury. No, who cares what it's going to be? What do you think? We're all a bunch of friggin', like, pussies. We're just scaredy-cats. Say the wrong thing and what? You'll be blackballed? Don't worry. Please, Joe Piscopo still has somewhat of a career. If he does, he really got to commit career suicide. You got to say something about the blacks to get thrown out of show business. Please. Chris from Jersey went through a taping of Politically Incorrect Once, and the applause light is like the no-smoking light on an airplane. You'd think there'd be a time when it goes off, but it just doesn't happen. Damn things on all the time. I know, they're like trying to pump you up and everything. Let's go to Jennifer. What? Jennifer, what's going on? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold it, hold it. Oh, you're not playing by the rules. You're not playing by the rules. Did you talk to the police? I'm playing by the rules. Did you talk to our screener? Yes. And what did you say when he said, what's your name? He said nothing. What did you say when he said, what's your name? I said, no, my name's not Jennifer, it's Lisa. Listen, are you changing your name now? Yes. Okay. All Jennifers from now on will be known as Wendy. Okay, I'm Wendy. All right. So if you're Jennifer, your official name for the ONA show is Wendy. Okay, I'm Wendy. Hi, Wendy. How are you today? I was listening to a party morning. Wait, wait, wait. You've got to make believe your name's Wendy, so you've got to answer. Wendy? Hello, Wendy? I think we just lost Wendy. We lost her cell phone connection. She will not respond to that name. Our buddy Joe Lyons from Calming Central, you've given Bill Maher too much airtime already. Yeah. We just hate the guy. We hate this guy. We begged Jay Moore to just go at it with him on the show. I was pissed that Jay was supposed to be on like Tuesday and then Wednesday, and we were saying like Jay's going to be on, and it gave the show publicity. For like two days, you had to sit through his doping monologue before you realized who was going to be on. Yeah. Ugh, a monologue. Speaking of Calming Central, someone came up with something really, really funny. I want to read this. It's from Vinnie from Rosedale. He writes in an email, I'm starting to see similarities between the Opie and Anthony show and South Park. Try and see if you guys can catch on. All right? So each character of our show is very similar to a character from South Park, Anthony. Opie is Kyle. He learns something new every day, the reasonable one of the group, and is always trying to help his best friend Anthony stand out of any situation but ends up in more trouble. Case in point, the IRS, $19,000 she owes him. Anthony S. Stan. He's always throwing up at the sight of a certain woman. Let's call her Wendy. Since that is a name we could use on the air, very good. Psycho Mark is Cartman. Always has to be the center of attention, loud, mugs for the camera whenever he can. Thank you, Noah. Hooray, Jesus. Stinky is Pip, always getting in the way. J. Moore is Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat. You never know which way he's going. Loves to blurt out other names for penises and vaginas. Penises, vaginas, butt-secks. Spaz, Timmy, enough said. Timmy! Let me out, let me out, Timmy! Dice is Chef, where all the words of wisdom come from. Jim Brewer is Mr. Mackey, Anthony. Everyone knows Mackey has to be a closet stoner. That's good. And then Rick, Rick is Jimbo. He overreacts to everything and isn't used enough on the show. Rick doesn't overreact? No, never. And then that leaves just one person. Because there is something happening. Earl is Kenny, Anthony. You can never understand Earl on a cell phone. And you guys are about to kill him off. Very good. Hey, we're still not allowed to talk about the situation? Vinnie from Rosedale. Rick? I thought it was all out in the clear. The listeners probably, I mean, I've gotten emails and phone calls. Oh, here's how it goes. You know, remember that, Earl? Remember about how long ago is that now? Two weeks? Let's take a break and we'll get something out of Rick. Yeah, let's see if we can get through this without any outbursts or flying crows. Is there a bathroom stalled doors or anything? I can't believe this. Somebody actually asked on the New York Radio message board if they had Opie's address on Long Island. Un-f'ing-believable. That's great. When are you moving? Soon. Are you? Yeah, to be honest with you. Out of the tree house. I've got to figure something out. The tree fort. Opie's house is like a tree fort. You ever go to Disney and go to the Swiss Family Robinson tree house? That's what I'm living in. And you're walking up the stairs. It's like wacky. All you need is mirrors and that's a fun house. I live in the house of the seven gables. Yeah, there's one part of the house where you walk up stairs to go to this room and you have to walk over a little bridge. It's like a stair bridge. There's no apparent reason. And then you're back downstairs and then you walk to the left and there's a room. I think Midgets... Yeah, I think Midgets used to live in my apartment. It's like some kind of wacky, wacky layout in there. All right, wait, this girl dated Bill Maher. Really? Laurie, what's up? Hi, how are you? Real good. I've got to tell you something. I've heard you guys a couple of times. I just moved Jeanette back to New York. He's such a dick. I'm sorry, but I couldn't take it any longer. Bill Maher? Yeah, oh, Beth. And he has these, I guess. Do you think he produces the right material about people being born prematurely? Yeah. I was born prematurely and you know what? I think he was, severely. Now you're saying you went out with Bill Maher? I went out with him four times. Four times? Yeah, contaker. Where, out in California? Yep. What, did he like date you and stuff? Well, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey, Laurie, Bill Maher here. Do you want to go out tonight? I'm having flashbacks, they're bad. I think we'll go to Spago. We've got a table over there at Spago. We could go. He was very good friends with Wolfgang, you know. Yes, Wolfgang talked. It's going to be great. I'll have him cook a special meal for you. And then you could hob the Bill Maher knob, if you would, please. No, no, you don't do that. Was there any sex? No. No sex? No, would you? You went out with Bill Maher four times and didn't have sex? No. I hear he likes just banging broads. Yeah, he does. Yeah? Yeah, but you know, he's a little curricular guy. Oh, really? Yeah. Hmm, interesting. All right, Laurie. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Well, there goes Laurie. You guys have a really cool show. Keep it up. We're trying. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we've got to take a break. We'll see if Rick wants to talk about the situation. I know, we'll get to... All right, hold on. God damn it, we've got to take a break, though. Jerry, what's going on? Jerry! Yes? You're on the air. We've got to make it fast. What's up? Yeah, I got myself a dress stamp envelope back for the Wow stickers. Yeah. They're invisible. Who packed them? The invisible man? What, you got an empty envelope back? Wait, you've got an invisible man? You got it. You got an empty envelope? I got an empty envelope. I thought it was a man. Those are the special edition. Because they have about 12 of them. Invisible Wow stickers. That's it. You did it. You got them. The invisible man. Oh, that's funny. Wow, that sucks. Yeah, it does. I have to go through this whole process again. Send another envelope and everything. Yeah, send another envelope. We'll make sure you get your sticker. All right, Jerry? Okay. How hard could it be to put a Wow sticker in a self-addressed stamp envelope? That's how Earl's making up for lost time. Some of the envelopes he just opens and sends them. All right, Jerry? Okay. I thought it was a man. Because he had about 12 of them from my friends. I didn't get nothing back. All right, send something. We'll send it back out. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Jerry. All right. Speaking of Wow stickers, we're doing another Wow sticker stop today, Anthony? Yeah. We will be at the Staten Island Ferry. Oh, that's going to be a long scene. Yeah, Staten Island Ferry. If you're on your way home, you're going to be at the Staten Island Ferry. I'm going to be at the Staten Island Ferry. All right. I'm going to be at the Staten Island Ferry. All right. I'm going to be at the Staten Island Ferry. All right. All right. All right. All right. Anthony? Yeah? We will be at the Staten Island Ferry. Oh, that's going to be a long scene. Oh, yeah? Yeah, Staten Island Ferry. If you're on your way home and you're taking the ferry tonight, make sure you get your Wow stickers, okay? Yeah. Earl and who? Invisible Man. Oh, and the Invisible Man. The Invisible Man. We'll be there at 4.30. Cool. Obviously, on the Manhattan side. Staten Island Ferry, Manhattan side, 4.30, if you want to get your Wow stickers, okay? All right. Quick break. We'll be back. Hey, New York. This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio. OP and Anthony on 1027 WNEW. Anthony, Rockaway Bedding. Yeah, I got a Rockaway Bedding bed. You going to get hooked up? Yes, I'm going to get one very soon. Seems like you had a good experience with Rockaway Bedding. I'm going to follow your lead and have them take my old mattress out. Yeah. Get rid of it and give me a brand new one. I just sit there and watch them do the whole process, right? They will do that. I went to one of their fine stores in Brooklyn, OP. They have 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey. I picked out one of their brand name mattresses. I got the Stearns and Foster, king size. They delivered it, set up the free steel bed frame, set up the entire bed. It was perfect. Everything but the sheets was wonderful. And yeah, took care of the old bedding, so you didn't have to worry about that. Yeah, you can buy anything there. You need a headboard, metal beds, futons, daybeds, electric beds, bunk beds, anything you need to sleep at any Rockaway Bedding store. So what you do, you just go there, try out your bed, pick one out and that's it. They do the rest. And they got prices up to 65% below department store prices, Anthony. You can shop in one of Rockaway Bedding's area stores or give them a call. 1-800-TRY-A-BED. That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED. If J. Moore and Anthony sleep on a new mattress from Rockaway Bedding. Two separate mattresses. Yeah, whatever. So should you. 1-800-TRY-A-BED. Call system is gone, over. Until you have any self-respect, aren't you embarrassed to yourself, to your family? Open the air vents today. You inhuman slime! 1027-WNEW. 212757, 1027 is our phone line. Rick ran out of the studio, Ant. Where'd he go? I don't know, we got to confront him about the situation. Absolutely. It's been a couple weeks now. Let's see if he gets his ass back in the studio. Mike, what's going on? Yo, yo. How are you, Mike? What's happening, fellas? What's going on? Hey, listen, Anthony, I caught Adam Ferrara Saturday night. I had a governance. Yeah. Well, what, you mean? You said you were going to meet the 8 o'clock, right? Yeah, I was. You were there? Yeah. I was looking around for you. I was in the back. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, yeah, you were hiding, huh? Did you hand the plunger up to him? Somebody did. Yeah, that was hilarious. Hey, listen, you guys remember me? I went and handed out flyers when you guys first came to New York. Of course I remember you. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, I've been throwing tremendously since then. I can't even get through anymore. I don't know. I think the phones are all screwed up today because there's like ten lines that aren't ringing. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, I know when I was down there, you didn't have no broads on the couch. You know what I mean? No, we've worked on the show a little bit since you started listening. That's what's going on. Big time. Big time. You know what he was even calling when I went on. I mean, to be honest, you know what I mean? No, you're right. I mean, when we first got here, people just called in for requests. That's right. You know, and that drunk woman that hated you. Oh, yeah. That's still one of my faves. All right, fellas. Good talking to you, man. Good luck. Thank you, Mike. All right. Bye. Let's go to Eddie. Eddie, you're next on any W. How are you? All right. What's going on? Good. I just received my, I thought it would be Wow stickers in the mail. Yeah, you sent a self-addressed stamped envelope and Earl sent you a Wow sticker back. Great. No, I got somebody else's self-stamped envelope with no Wow sticker, but I sent his. I didn't open his. I just sent his one long. Oh, my God. I mean, what? I know how to kill off black girl. Wow. I'm a fellow. Send a little bomb and let it explode. No, no, no, no. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. All right. That's right. Send this crazy. Yes. Send in another self-addressed stamped envelope and see what happens. All right. Right. This time you get make sure you put one in. Yeah. You can write that attention, Dick. Whatever. All right. I love you guys. You're great. God damn. That is the cheapest phone I've ever heard. God. Little high-end a little bit. Andrew. Hey, what's up? Oh, and hey, what's going on? How are you? All right. This happened twice to me now with black girl. What happened? Not once. I sent the first time and I got the same one with no sticker. The second time I sent two and I got two of them back with nothing. So he sent back empty envelopes to you as well? Twice. Not once, but twice. Oh. All right, Andrew. Thank you. I think a certain amount. He's just like, just throwing them back in the middle and back in. All right. Now everyone's just complaining about their stickers not being sent to them. Great. Well, if you want to try to get a WOW sticker, self-address stamped envelope, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10106. Just write attention WOW sticker or whatever on there, okay? Right. That address is on the unofficial Opium Anthony website and the WNEW website. Okay. Everyone's just bitching about not getting their stickers. Did you guys check out Brittany on MTV this weekend? The new look. She looks like a crack whore. So dirty, so doable. And what's up with those fags in the audience screaming like little girls? Brittany was all over the tube this past weekend, Saturday Night Live. MTV's doing all sorts of things. Yeah. I'm digging her new look. Is it a new look? Yeah. She cut her hair a little bit shoulder-length. Uh-huh. God, they want us to want her. Wow, that's... And I hate them for it. I absolutely hate them for it. Well, you're a little smitten with her. I think everybody is. Did you see her on SNL? She looked great. Yeah. She looked great. You're not into the Britney Spears hit? Um, yeah, you know, she's hot. But I mean, the music. Can you get past that? The whole image and everything? I don't watch her for the music. I want her to totally dirty herself up. I watch her for the cleavage shots, the mid-trift. What is she saying about the lip-syncing? Oh, the delay on the screen above me. So if you listen to the music and watch the screen, they don't sync up. You ever go to a show and you watch the big Jumbotron behind the artist, and if you're sitting toward the back, the sound from the stage takes a little longer for you to get there. It's like watching the carpenter banging the nail with the hammer from a distance and makes a sound when he's pulling the hammer up. Yeah, that's a little weird. Yeah, and she's saying that's what it is? Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. Well, you think she's lip-syncing? I think so. I could care less. As long as she looks good. Why, are you planning on going to a Britney show? I would definitely stalk Britney Spears and stalk her and do some hard time. Yeah. I don't know. She's going to be on TRL tomorrow, I believe. Can... And of course, yeah, playing Jones Beach June 27th through the 30th. Can anyone say overexposure? She's getting there, sure. Let's enjoy it, though. Okay. And then she gets overexposed, and then she's going to have to jump-start a career, and she's going to have to get like the Mariah Carey breast implants or pose naked in Playboy. It's all coming. She won't do that until we don't want to see her in Playboy. What the hell happened to Mariah Carey? Mariah Carey is doing everything now to try to get attention away from all these young Britney Spears singers. It's... Mariah Carey's new video, she has her big sloppy breast implants. She might as well be naked. She's dancing around some kind of penthouse suite or something. They're just like, whoa, from side to side and stuff. Oh, just sloppy, messy. She's a... Like a mournful, like a whore. Now you got like Christina Aguilera and Britney, all the new young whores for the new millennium. Mariah's going to be in Penthouse. You think? She's not even going to make the cut for Playboy. Nah. She's going to be in Penthouse. And she wants to be... Doing a pee spread? Oh, she wants to be in those magazines. You can just tell. Swank. Swank? Yeah, being like Swank or Cherry. Biggums? She's going to be in Biggums. She couldn't be in that one. No? You're not big enough. What was that? Christina Aguilera wrecked our prom. Teen pop star Christina Aguilera, seniors at Augusta Georgia High School were delighted when one of their students won a contest to bring Christina to their prom. They always do those wacky things like that with these little poppet stars. But when the Genie in the Bottle star showed up, she acted like a full blown diva, ruining the entire gala. She performed only two songs, ordered a flunky into the crowd to remove any CDs of archrival Britney Spears, and virtually ignored Colin Shapiro, the youngster who won the contest. What's she supposed to do? Hob his knob in the limo? Well yeah, if you agree to go to the prom with the guy, you gotta make an effort. Christina was rude, crude, selfish, and disrespectful. Baebae Ballas, who helped out at the prom, said, Huh, well what the hell do they expect? I think she should have made an effort. I could not have been. It's no big deal if she hobbed his knob in the limo. It was clear that the prom was the last place Christina wanted to be. While getting ready she kept hissing, I can't believe I'm going through with this. I can't go out there. You sure this wasn't part of a wacky radio promotion? It probably was. This is like something the old management would have got us involved with. Bring Opiate Anthony to your prom! To your prom! Ho ho! Win the chance! Christina, her road manager, had a huge fight over whether she'd do two or three songs. She gave strict orders. If the DJ plays a Britney Spears song, I'm out of here. Boy, they hate each other, huh? That'd be a great one. I think Aguilera hates Britney. Britney's much more successful than Aguilera. She was so busy complaining she was 45 minutes late to the stage. A prom guest fumed. After her ridiculously short performance, Christina was ushered to an interview area to meet with Colin. He gave Christina a rose, but she barely remembered this poor guy who was supposed to be her prom date. She said, oh, you're the kid who won the contest, handed him one of her CDs and moved on. The whole visit amounted to two quick songs and a cloud of dust. Christina may be a big star, but she's a real zero in Augusta. Well, come on. It's one of those dopey promotion things. She shows up, but if you're going to agree to do something like that, you've got to play it out. You see this dopey kid. I can't believe I'm going to the prom with Christina Aguilera. He's got all these images in his head the night before. Without a doubt. I'm going to be in the prom. What's my move? I'm going to give her a single rose, and all of a sudden we're going to talk, and she's really going to be into me. We're going to last after this prom, and then we're going to drive home, and how am I going to make the move for the kiss? You're like, he's working it all out, and she just hands him a CD and leaves. You're the guy that won the contest. I picture how many times do you think he spanked it to the thought of him in the limo just pounding her. Just plowing her. Probably had bets with all his friends. Dude, what do you think? What are my chances? She needs me. She needs me. Little Colin. Colin Shapiro. Oi. Oi, Zay. I'm going out with Christina Aguilera. I'm going to wear my dress yarmulke. Yeah, maybe a little futseg. That's what these things are, though. They're those dopey promotional things that the companies hook up, a radio station or a record company, and they even honestly want to do this? You think Christina Aguilera wanted to spend a night at a prom, a high school prom? Then she should have said no. With Colin Shapiro? Well, a lot of these people can't say yes or no to things. They're roped in for a year or two. Christina? Hello, Christina. It's your new promotions guy. I want you to appear in front of the giant black clock. There's a free satellite dish in it for you. I got one for free. I run it like any other guy. When our old promotion guy sent us to a Super Bowl party, Anthony, we played it out. Yeah, we did, though. But, you know. We didn't stay there for five minutes, have a beer and leave. We realized it was a really stupid promotion, but we said yes, so we worked it. We ended up having a good time. I hear the picture. Let's see. Contest winner Colin Shapiro got the cold shoulder from Christina. Look at her. She's wearing... It's a prom and she's still got the belly shirt thing on. Look at her. Imagine that. She shows up. Look at the picture. I see that. She shows up and this guy's like, oh, man, I'm going to school. She's wearing the belly shirt just for me. Yeah. Christina, could you go out to the limit? You think you tried pulling something like that? Christina, do you want to go out to the limo for just a little bit? I really got to tell you. Oh, Colin, no, I can't. No, my manager told me to stop just trying to blow off and he's trying everything. Christina, I got some good pot. Can I pin the corsage on you? Here, let me put it on your chest. Oh, sorry. I caught the feel of Christina. Yeah, you want to smoke some pot? Yeah. Let's fight the punch. Christina, if we could go outside just for a minute. Christina? What are we going to do about this? Christina, look what I did to you again. Again. That's what those things are. What do they expect? Anthony, what does a girl want? Um... Pain is it. Pain is it. But is it. But is it. That's right. I was supposed to go out with her. I'm Colin Shapiro, damn it. Christina showed up and blew me off, well not in a good way. She just gave me a CD and left. I bought her a lovely corsage. I'm Colin Shapiro. I shined my shoes and wore my brand new glasses. She wore the belly shirt and I thought I was getting laid. She gave me VD. I know it. I got the crabs from her. And I'm itching. And I got genital warts. I even spanked out a batch before the prom so I'd last longer. Cause two pumps and I'm done. Now my yam bag is all itchy and rashy. She's a hot tamale. She wouldn't put out. I shaved my yam bag for her. I made it all smooth. And have a hair on it. Looks like a nine year old, like a clam shell. Like a Pidou oven stuffer. I was just fantasizing about putting a map of Guam on her belly. And she totally didn't pay attention to me. I'm Colin Shapiro. The contest winner. Show me that balloon knot. Yeah, I had all my lines set up. Like, here's your corsage sweetie. And here's a rose. And suck it baby. Everything pre-planned. The whore. Genie, rub my bottle. I got a bottle. Whore bag. Get a genie in my pants. And a rash from you. Where's Britney? Most likely to dance with the pole. Britney Spears or Aguilera? I don't know. This is almost shaping up to be one of those Debbie Gibson Tiffany battles. Where one will kind of have a career that will go on a couple of years longer than the other. Who really won that one? Well, you know, in the long run neither emerged victorious. But at the time, it was definitely Debbie Gibson that won. Because I think Tiffany was back in the malls but working, you know, at a gap or something. After like a month. An orange Julius. Yeah. Hey, weren't you Tiffany? Shut up, shut up. What do you want, large? Yeah, large like your ass. What happened? Did you see that Whatever Happened To show? Yeah. And they had Tiffany on there. I was like, oof. She was cute for five minutes. You know she just had that fiery red batch. Looked like she was perpetually on the rag. Come on, come on. Hey, Jeff, what's going on? Hey guys. I found out according to her website that the guy who didn't want to be with her, the guy who was acting like a... Oh, please. Any one of us would bang a teen slut. It's either that the website is lying or he's gay. I don't know. That's a crack of crap. You're 17, 18 going to your prom with like a Christina Aguilera. You want action. Definitely. You definitely want action. Look at this guy. He's in his little tuxedo or little suit. He's got Christina Aguilera in front of him. What, you think he's just going to say in a belly shirt? I didn't want her. And we all know she goes. You can just tell she goes. Unless there's something wrong with him, then yeah, he would. She went out with like Fred Durst. You know she goes. Please. He does it all for the nookie. The nookie. Hey, Aunt. That cookie's like a chocolate chip now. Hey, Aunt, what... Eating it in rag and melted. Hey, Aunt, what does a girl want? Huh? What does a girl want? Half. Alright, Jeff. Alright, syndication now. Yeah, sure. Jeff, what's going on? Yeah, how you guys doing? Good. I don't like you guys making fun of this Ronald Shapiro character, to tell you the truth. What, Colin Shapiro? Yeah, you guys... Colin Shapiro! Shapiro? To you, dammit. She gave me genital warts and I had them burnt off with a laser. Oh, it's tearing the ass out of me. I'm dying over here. That's crazy, yo. I was very injured at my prom. She injured me. She kicked me in my yam bag when I went to Copperfield. After Fred Dirsad, I don't think he left anything for us. Yeah, I think I can kick your ass. If something tells me Fred Dirsad leaves... He's one of those scorched earth policy guys. You know, where you move on, you don't leave anything for the enemy. You just burn it and move on. Yeah, absolutely. Butt sex. Butt sex. Fred Dirsad is like the locust. You know, just sleeps in, there's nothing left but dried up stalks burning in the sun. Just tattoos her badge. Fred Dirsad is here. Oh my God. We gotta do a remix here. Until he gets into the nookie part here. Yeah, Fred Dirsad having sex with Christine Aguilera. Here we go. Get ready. Butt sex. Butt sex. Butt sex. Butt sex. Hope you like them all by and large. Please. Christine Aguilera is a type of girl, this is from Scissor. Type of girl you want to get a hummer from and then once finished... Punch her in the head. Oh my God. Alright. Butt sex. Yes. Uh oh. No, I like that Fred Dirsad but I think he's a little too rough on the women. You think Mike? Mike Tyson, everyone. Yeah, that's a little, you know, I like a little foreplay myself. Yeah. You know, a little bit of the rice and laughs to the vulva and uterus. But that man is out of control. I like that Christine Aguilera. You do? I would like to date her. Yeah? Yeah, I take my big boot and stick it on her rectum and turn it around. I do like a pirouette in her butt. And then of course I would go with the usual beating of her breasts and then punch her in her face. And you know that belly that's always exposed? Yeah. That thing would look like a skating rink when I was done with it. I and Mike would unleash a skating rink. And I like to finish it up with a tender moment with the girl after I'm through. Right before she slips into unconsciousness, I beat her over the head with a spade shovel. That's how they leave knowing that it was with I and Mike Tyson. What the heck? Jesus, man. Was she really with Fred Durst? Fred Durst says no, I believe. A lot of rumors. Carson? Supposedly Carson got his knob hobbed. When is the devil supposed to come up and take Carson's soul? Is that happening sometime in the next few years? I don't know. When did he ink that deal in blood? He's a star. He's a star, he's a star, Anthony. Getting all the hot women in Hollywood. I think he T.F.ed her. Jennifer Love Hewitt? Are you jealous? There was a time you liked her. Yeah. But you know, you've got to look at every ad that was out for that I Know What You Did Last Summer movie. They just showed her breasts. And Carson, you know, to be able to walk around New York and see those poses and just go, Yeah, I T.F.ed that. I T.F.ed those. You know? Again! Look what I did to you again! I'm sploogin' over here now! All right, we've got to take a break. Again? Yeah. Again, we haven't broken like 40 minutes here. We talked about Christina Aguilera today, Britney Spears. Christina, a Hitler mustache? Triangle. Mohawk, wood floor. What do you think? She is wood floor all the way. Britney Spears, very innocent, well-groomed triangle. You think? Oh, yeah. Only in Hollywood can you have somebody else do everything for you. Even adjust your bra. Jennifer Love Hewitt gets a realignment while filming the movie Breakers at a downtown L.A. gas station. Yeah, look at that. Some chick is like tightening up her bra. She's got her shirt pulled up. How big do you have to be to get a realignment of your bra? Look at that belly on that chick. She could take two or three punches before she pukes, I bet you. All right, now we've got to regroup. If you're heading to the Staten Island Ferry, we're going to be there today, giving out the brand new Wow stickers. Earl and the Invisible Man will be there at 4.30 on the Manhattan side. So pick up your Wow stickers, Staten Island Ferry, starting at 4.30. I hope Earl left already. All right, now let's take a break. We'll be back. What's funny is a sinking school bus. I have a strong stomach. You guys made me bloat some snot. The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. O&A, my two new favorite hordes. You guys are really horrible. Hopefully you have them today. What a couple of asswipes. 1027. WNEW. All right, Anthony, one of these days we'll have it all figured out around here. We've been announcing for the last two hours that we're doing a Wow sticker stop for the Staten Island Ferry. On the Manhattan side. He said that Earl and the Invisible Man would be there at 4.30. And what's up? Well, as we take a break there, I walked into the hallway and bumped into Earl. What? He hasn't left yet. They've only been talking about this for the last two hours. What's going on? Is he leaving now, Rick? He said he... He's frustrated just having to think about the conversation with Earl. Go ahead. He talked about saying how he was thinking of leaving at 3.30, but then was told by someone to wait till people start leaving work. And he should probably leave about 4.45, but he wasn't sure what he should do. So why wouldn't he ask someone from our show? Because it's all about our radio show. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. And why would he leave at 4.45? Midtown is a complete nightmare at 4.45. He wouldn't get there. And what else is he doing that he can't just leave at 2.30 and then hang out there all day? Like leaving in the heat of rush hour. So, I don't know. Screw it. If you're going to be on the Staten Island ferry, you might get a wow sticker. Why bother? Why even bother trying to do stuff? No one communicates with anyone. We're announcing for two hours that he's going to be there at 4.30. I walk in the hallway. He's hanging out. He's hanging out. And then he gets pissed when we ride him. Goes and cries and hides and stuff. Hides in the stairwell. Hides in the stairwell. Stairs off bathroom stall doors. Oh, wait, no. That was Rick. Sorry. So, I don't know. Staten Island ferry, Manhattan side. Eventually, Earl will get his ass down there with the brand new wow stickers, okay? Eventually. And I'm sure we can all look forward to another great phone call from Earl from the road. From the crappy phone? With the distorted cell phone that we've been talking about for three, four weeks, but no one has done anything about that either. We've even had people from companies that want to help out. Offer free cell phone to Earl. I think the problem is Earl. I think he doesn't know how to use a cell phone. He yells into it. He screams into it and he has a right of defense as well. I don't know what he's talking about. He's too old for Earl. What? What, Earl? So, lots of stuff to look forward to today. Another horrendous, horrendous call from Earl. Earl is still... We've got to kill him. What are you leaving? Earl, what are you doing here still? He's in the hallway. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for Mark. You're waiting for Mark? Morpheus, how the hell are you going to get down there in 20 minutes? How long is it going to take you to get there, Earl? Take the West Side Highway down. Take the West Side Highway down. So you'll be there by five now? You don't know. I've been waiting for an hour. I'm sorry. What have you been doing? What have you been doing? Sending out wow mail. You've been sending out the wow mail. Here he is. Supposed to be somewhere else. But he's here. Earl, you've been doing the wow mail, right? I just got to ask this. And this is not even going to... I'm not trying to bust on you, okay? Just answer honestly. You've been doing the wow mail, right? Everyone's sending their self-addressed envelopes for the wow stickers, okay? Yes. Have you been listening to the show while doing that? Yes, I have. How many times did you hear us say that you're going to be at the Staten Island Ferry at 430? To which I... at 3 o'clock... No, no, no. Answer the question. Did you or did you not hear us say, Hey, Earl's going to be at the Staten Island Ferry at 430? I heard it a couple of times. So why wouldn't you come in and say, Look, guys, you're saying 430, but I haven't even left yet, and I was told to go later. Why wouldn't you like at least work it out to see what the hell's going on? I heard Rick that we were going to be later. People are waiting there now for you. They're waiting there for you, Earl. It's the biggest part of their day to meet Earl and the Invisible Man and get the wow sticker. Seriously. If you're listening to the show and you hear us say that you, the person listening to the show, is going to be somewhere at 430, and you know because you're the person that you're not going to be there at 430, why don't you talk to someone about it? I did talk to somebody about it. Who? You! Just now! Just now when I saw you in the hallway and you're arguing instead of getting the bad man going. I'm going. And Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Earl! Earl! Earl! Alright, listen, when you use the cell phone, don't yell into it. Don't yell into the phone. He's going. Oh my God. Oh my God. I just asked him. Is Psycho Mark going with him? I don't know. He's saying 330? That's the fastest 40 minutes I've ever seen in my life because when you said, hey, hey Rick, Earl's still here, and I'm like, oh, I'm like, Earl, what are you still doing here? Our 330 conversation. Didn't that just happen during the last pop right? Yes, of course it did. So they ended at 330. That's a lie. Oh my God. Oh. Jesus. He'll be there by 6. He won't get there. Be fair, guys. Earl probably wasn't paying attention to the show. He was very busy mailing out empty envelopes. There are people waiting at the Staten Island Ferry. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. I want Earl's job. Just fire Earl. We've got to write him off the show. Send Earl to a Latino neighborhood. The invisible man that's just in from Frank, the invisible man, is at the Staten Island Ferry and yes, he is handing out the invisible wow stickers. Oh, cool. With the invisible man and the invisible man. Nobody's there. Anyway, like you said, he's listening to the show. He hears that he's supposed to be somewhere at 430. It's now 10 after 4. He's got to get down to the Staten Island Ferry. Not only that. In 20 minutes. Not only that, but where's the van? Downstairs. Downstairs. That alone takes 20 minutes just to get the van out of the parking garage. Exactly. Yeah. What, Ben? What? You got a microphone in front of you? No, he asked him what the hell he's doing. He's going to go, oh, oh, oh. And then he gets mad at us. He said he didn't know what time he was supposed to go. That's what he told me. All right. Well, Staten Island Ferry eventually with Earl and Psycho Mark on the Manhattan side handing out the wow stickers. Can't wait for the call in there. The call in. We'll take place. We look forward to it every day. We ought to make sure we remember where those are taped. So we tape Earl's phone calls and send them in because we might get an award for that. Best remote phone call. Best remote broadcast. Yeah, we may maybe get another Air Award. Yeah, we'll send it into the Air Awards. We should do that. Earl's on the spot reporting. On the spot reporting. All right. Bob, what's going on? And Earl Douglas from WNEW's Opie and Anthony Show against all the people from WINS that like go to fires and do broadcast live. I'm here at the scene of the high rise fire. No, Earl will win. And here's Earl's submission. I'm here at the last stop. Can't call you. And Earl's calling in. I don't know why. He just left the studio. Earl, where are you? I'm over here now. Okay, very good. He's over here now. Help me. Help me. Help me. Somebody help me. Help me. Help me. Yes, Ben. I've been informed that Earl's real reason he has left is because Mark is running light and it's Mark's fault. I'm told. Ah, yes. Of course. Always someone else's fault around here. Pass the buck. Earl, what's the problem? Stop that. All right, Earl, a little pissed off. Oh, no, no. He's desperate. Do what he says. Do what he says. Earl. What do you want on this wall? There's somebody where I'm talking to somebody that's at the Staten Island ferry right now. Did you get a sticker? I got it from a Negro. Oh, maybe he is down there. Where did you get it? I got it from a Negro. Hey, who's on the line? I'm seeing him. Hey, Bob, what's going on? Hey, Anthony and Prash. On CNN right now, they're talking about having a press conference about Bobby Knight. Yeah, he's going to keep his job. You sure? Positive. They announced that earlier. It slipped out. Why? What are they saying on ESPN? Well, they're just kind of going a big long route, long about route, saying that they actually have the videotape of Neil Reed. I'm just waiting for the final conclusion. We were watching before the show today, and it leaked out. One of his assistant coaches said something to someone and said that Bobby Knight is going to keep his job. Well, I guess we'll find out in a few minutes. Yeah, no, they said okay, that he's going to keep his job, but he's going to be under firm guidelines on sanctions. Oh, yeah, right. Whatever. Now he's going to keep his job. No, you know, more entertaining basketball. All right, Bob, thank you. Okay, bye. We should play some of our Bobby Knight clips. Keeping his job. He is keeping his job. It's official, right? Under, just what the guy said. Under what? Specific guidelines. Under specific guidelines? It's a slap on the wrist. They don't have the balls to fire him. They'll take a chair upside their head or something. Or take some duty and shove it in their face. He's a mad man. We got some great Bobby Knight clips, Anthony. Yeah. A few new ones. I collect Bobby Knight clips at this point. I see. Trade them with your friends. We'll play the best one last year, but let's start with Bobby Knight talking about fat officials. Fat officials. Fat officials? Yeah. He has a problem with fat college officials. You know, we've got more fat ass officials in college basketball with pants that are two sizes too small for them. I mean, they look like they're almost reformed prostitutes trying to make a comeback with how tight their pants are. It's amazing. You know, you see this big fat ass guy out there and you want to say, what are you wearing 36s for? God, why don't you get a pair of 42s? What could possibly start him on that tirade? He really is the best. He is the best. That's pretty funny. He's looking at the officials. Fat ass officials? You think he's checking out their asses and stuff with the tight pants? Well, you know, the fat officials must really love them. Yeah, look at the yam bags in the front of their pants. Boy, way to get the officials on your side, huh? Yeah. Here's another Bobby Knight clip. My time on earth is gone and my activities here are past. I want they bury me upside down and my critics can kiss my ass. Whoa. Wait, he's got some issues. Oh yeah, he does. Why is he so angry? Is there anybody who knows? He's obviously not getting laid. Now, if you're getting laid and hummers and stuff, you're just not that angry. I guess. You're not getting it. You get angry. This clip, someone asked him about being a time bomb. He's all over the place with his answer here. Is Bob Knight potentially a time bomb like Woody Hays? Well, I think everybody is. I think there are circumstances that could develop surrounding any human being that would set that human being off in an abnormal way. I think that we all hope that when such a situation would arise that we can control our emotions or we can react to the circumstances in such a way that doesn't put either that person or people surrounding him in any kind of a highly embarrassing or difficult situation. What? Huh? What? I have no idea what he said there. Why would they? See, I don't know much about basketball, especially college basketball. Why were they thinking about firing him? Because of all the allegations coming out. They got a video of him choking one of his players. Choking one of his players? We got the hidden audio from the locker room we're about to play here. How come a player can choke the coach and keep his career, but a coach if he chokes a player, it's a bad thing. Wow, look at you. Oh, no, I remember that one. I always remember the chokings that go on in basketball. Up close with Anthony. Yes. On ESPN. Who cares? Whatever. I just want him in the game because he's too entertaining. He's too colorful. He is funny. And here's our famous Bobby Knight clip. It's all over the Internet. It's hidden audio from, I guess his team lost again in the locker room and he just lost it. Check this out. What a boy that I'm getting the f*** out of here. I mean, if you're not going to recover great grand, if you're just going to let him drive by you, if the rest of you are going to let him drive by you, you're going to be the one who's going to get the f*** out of here. I'm sick and tired of an 8 to 10 record. I'm tired of losing to Purdue. I'm not here to f*** around this week. Now you may be, but I'm not. So I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we lose this week, we're going to be able to get the f*** out of here. I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we lose this week, we're going to be able to get the f*** out of here. I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we lose this week, we're going to be able to get the f*** out of here.

So I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, you're not going to believe the next f***ing day. So I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday. Now you better f***ing understand that right now. This is absolute f***ing bullshit. I'm not here to f*** around this week. I'm not here to f*** around this week.

No, I think it was practice on that one. Yeah? Yeah. I want to see that. The president of the college is telling Bobby Knight that he's got to be nice to the press and the IU employees. If not, he will be terminated. That's the conditions of keeping his job. He's got to be nice to the press. Well, then he will. That ain't happening. He'll get fired.

Think your radio station just got infected by Earl's disease the stations coming in all fuzzy sounds like Earl's cell phone It's really annoying that would make sense because they usually wait to we're on the air to start tweaking with the signal It's not many people are listening. What's up with your signal? I feel like I'm listening to Earl's phone. Yeah our signal screwed for some reason Do we have an engineer who's working on this or is the coffee machine? refill oh My god the sound coming from the radio for you for like two minutes Mm-hmm was like some electrical ass was going around Really they're like a storm or something coming up.

We didn't we were we had a whole lot of hours You guys are sleezing out Was we had to get rid of a girlfriend and a wife Everything would have been fine. Yeah, a little Johnny Walker black and we're showering Well actually Sadly because we were all very attached truly back in the day Yeah, she and I had a sort of a not pleasant parting of ways my headphones are really like staticky and bizarre Something's happening here Equipment we'll get to know that blows monkey ass To have choked for you guys because our friendship was very strong and I think so strong into it to a certain degree when it Came down to business commerce art and and intense friendship and being tied to the hip every day and basically being semi-sidies twins that we just couldn't sustain it and And I'll boil down to just having had a lot of time together being under a lot of pressure together and having great great times together which you guys really remind me of and then And then just like that that time coming to a close and To certain to rear that time having exhausted itself, which I wouldn't trade for anything and it has propelled me into the next phase and Thank God for that Hmm. You had nothing to do with like banging the same guy Of the Rukas all nothing no no no guy That's what all the rumors were, you know You probably read them all she thought of that answer for a long time. That's a great I was a prepared statement I've been asked this question a hundred times and I'm here like this Wow, yeah Very close friends and I think we both let each other down in some ways and that's that sort of the that was sort of The grieving part of it afterwards just feeling like you know, we were carrying a torch for Girls aligned with girls and I feel like we kind of choked And the fact that our friendship didn't sustain itself over, you know The entire course of our lives and I hope that in eventually that we can come together in some to some degree someday Again right now, we're you know, mildly in touch, but we're working on very different mildly and my We've communicated some but we're not hanging out, you know, she's she's made a record of her own continue for her consult obviously and Fighting the sea there. Yeah And I'm you know, if you have the same problems I understand that but we we know like, you know We can't stand each other as it is, but we know we walked away from each other It would be yeah. Yeah detrimental. I was doing purely for the money. That's right. And that's it So much money Clothes you guys are rolling I'm Would you get this guy? So what happened to you like to know what you battle it out over the Veruca salt name and everything? It was just a legal understanding really now if you leave her assaults We're not gonna leave the name to like a row something Yeah, because I'll tell you piss me off and I went to go see fog hat and found out that a roadie owned the name And it's not fog hat man Yeah, you know, it's like some guy that used to carry around the drum is drum key and he's now fog hat Slow ride is one of the best jams ever come on, but you gotta see fuck. I do it not like it. That's weird Yeah, it happened a lot of the bands do that now really they give their name to the roadie or whatever I like Veruca salt would be like some former Mouseketeers. They'll get up there I Have enough testosterone in my life every day. Yeah overloaded with it right now. How is that for you? Well at best Interesting and worse or if I Not really have anybody to share those girly moments with anymore I have Suzanne Yeah for some time after after Nina and I split up I didn't want to play with another woman just because Home So you could like yeah, okay Because it cuts you off We like we like the cops on the air that's for the professional broadcasters, yeah, you know, it's like hey It's 452 time for the news Ten wins the wrong all call buttons all the time. You got a real cough like something with cough I don't know sound effect. We got a machine for all that. I got other stuff. Yeah, we got good stuff over here Yeah, so yeah, if you don't get off like hello ten ten wins We got All right, so I need Here what happened to us in Boston I heard that you guys got fired obviously as we're here and you moved on. Yeah, very good I like that answer. We told the whole city that the mayor died in there You know is killed in a horrible car crash and wasn't dead. We found out a lot of people didn't have a sense There's a purple so we figured we'd do a joke and the joke is on us a week later when they throw something Well, I think you guys are the coolest thing that ever happened to that station. Oh look at you. Thanks, you know boy They didn't think so They hate us now we're gonna come back on another station kick their ass, but that's a story for another day All right, so Nina left the band now you got to tell us what's going on You got Jimmy over here and I got Jimmy I got Suzanne. I got Stephen and And We are just touring I have a new album resolver. It's out in stores tomorrow Tuesday, May 16th it's also my brother's birthday, so it's a very poetic moment for me and I Love the record. I went straight. I went straight into it after touring on eight arms We took like a month off and then me and I split up and I had about 15 songs ready to go and so I Thought for a bit about whether to keep going through assaults, maybe a day During which time I talked to some people I respected a lot in the industry who gave me some really solid advice about why I Should keep going with the name when I was sort of Feeling like I like I didn't have a choice but wanted to really understand Why you know to go forward with a good feeling about it? I needed to talk to people and gather some good information and sort of advice about it So I went to the studio I decided never to turn back to you know Reform and make this band stronger than it ever has been and of course, it's different and no one is being replaced But I had about 15 songs we went the studio For first I went with a drummer from Los Angeles formerly the band failure which you guys probably know and His name is Kelly Scott and he played on a few demos and then What happened there oh he was great but he lived in California So a friend of mine said, you know, they're great drummers in Chicago Louise And I said like who and they said like Jimmy and I've been I've known Jimmy from a bunch of parties in Chicago and Bar scene and stuff and you Exactly. Actually, he's a great chef. So I had heard he was a great chef. Hence his name Tasty J word word Told you that was because he was a chef Mind you Anyway, so so like I called him up and I was like Jimmy you want to come drum for me with me and Incidentally every time I saw him at a party. He was always he'd always end up in the dress of whoever was having the party He always oh really? Darth Vader helmet on And somebody's like bar and panty. Yeah Okay terrific Actually one time he dressed up my Marilyn Monroe lingerie that I hadn't even worn yet and that is the brand name by the way Really? Yeah, it's very pink and very very flowy very frilly And Jimmy was very nice in it But I was very disturbed when I saw him at a party one day and he didn't have a dress on I was like Could you please go put a dress on or something a dress? somebody's like nightgown He's become a you know, I told dude and I've gotten used to it But initially I wasn't sure anyway came in and played and it was just like a no-brainer So I fit the costume so she's yeah, Johnny Bravo Really hard and he plays great and we are very happy together as we are with Suzanne and Stephen Totally kick-ass and We're I feel like this band right now is more this our incarnation of a reversal is so focused dedicated and Committed and like communicative in a way that is is unprecedented And that is psyched psyched for the band. Yeah, you're gonna combine like play for us next time Well, you know, I could play this I can play my sunglasses I would have you know last time I met the last time I saw you guys you guys used to play for us all the time Yeah, and um, I would have brought my acoustic but no one told me to oh really?

Well, I was excited to know it's gonna come see you guys today without a doubt It's weird to say that publicly because I would say to you off here, too. Yeah Like okay I mean this band is one of the greatest moments ever Dedicating a song to us in front of 20,000 people. Yeah, that was pretty cool when you guys were warming up for Bush Remember that yes I do a book show where it was just like at nine about 20,000 girls under the age of 14 Right and you know what the cool thing is that much of those many of those girls who were wearing the I love Gavin shirts Yeah, the homemade I love Gavin tees.

It's funny because it was written everywhere. That was like what was written Well, that's an unfortunate right isn't it? It must be Because you must have had it just like pull through that for a while Yeah well I basically just sort of like didn't I didn't like tuned out the rest of the world because I Went through two very publicized splits that year.

There he goes, Earl All right, um, I guess it's time for spaz's idea Yeah, we couldn't make Louise from Veruca salt weight So let's uh, let's bring in spaz now. It's bringing spaz, you know, um When when doing this show we love to get new ideas for new things to do on the opium Anthony show and We'll take the ideas from anyone listeners Each other the people that work here and of course the interns if they come up with a good idea Who are we to say it's not a good idea we don't care where the ideas come from right? It is the people's radio show I'll go on record and say we get most of our really good ideas from our listeners from the listeners Absolutely get a lot of the funny lines from our listeners and we rip you guys off all the time Yeah, comes up on the instant feedback if it's funny, we're using it. We're using it and not giving you credit now We may and hope you fight over your stuff sometimes Look at Bob from Jersey's got a great line. It's mine. We try to give you guys credit It's so funny though If we don't you guys are right on top of it. Yeah, and then they write back on the Institute like that was mine You know rip me off That's why you wrote it so it would make the air shut up. All right So so we got another idea from spaz now Usually you would think somebody would have an idea and just kind of walk up to you and go hey I got an idea right and tell you the idea right and you'd go. Yeah, that's cool You know maybe not spaz presents these ideas all Printed out on the computer like an outline. It's it's it's presented like somebody would present an idea for IBM or something and we appreciate the effort we don't oh we do yeah I didn't realize he knew how to to type but you do spaz Any what was the last one mats it all out. What was the last idea you gave us? I can't remember. Yeah, neither can wait Can someone check line to see what that's all about Somebody might have just saw a lady get hit by a car that's sick wicked. All right, so spaz Mm-hmm your latest idea for the ONA show. Yeah is the porno casting call. Yes Don't say anything we'll tell you when to speak Please it's a you you did a one-sheet for us. Yes to explain exactly the concept the film bonuses He's got a little subjects and everything. Yeah. Yeah little has it's like an outline So it's spaz's porno casting call. Yes now he presents these things to Hoping hoping they make their way to like Jeremy and they're very nicely printed out and stuff And I think he has this whole image in his head that Jeremy will read it Ken Stevens will read it and spaz will be accepted as An idea man as you're lucky that the bosses didn't get a copy of this. Yeah spaz I gotta say after reading this I had to read through this twice I swear to you that saw it in the office and was dumbfounded. I had to read through this twice to Maybe see if there was a punchline to it or or Just to grasp it in my head This could possibly be the most ridiculous insane idea I've ever ever read To be presented on this program. You truly think this is a good idea for the show I just need to know I know this is a lot of work involved that it could be no no no work involved We don't care if we have to build a spaceship and fly to Venus for a good idea I mean, we'll try it. Yeah, we'll go the distance for a good idea I mean we'll try it. Yeah, we'll go the distance for a good idea. It's nothing to do with work involved Is this worth a lot of effort? I believe so. Okay, you see nothing wrong with this So you handed this in and you were all excited, right? It's right up your alley, but you're all excited, right? You're like, I can't wait for them to read it. They're gonna go for it. This is perfect, right? Yeah, but I mean i'm trying to get inside your head and oh he thinks it's right up our alley Yeah, like this is the kind of stuff we should be doing on this program All right. Well, let me let me read a little bit of this and we'll stop as we move along here Okay, uh spaz is uh, oh and a show idea porno casting call the concept anthony Yeah Do an open casting call for women who want to be in a porno of all women gotten from the opium anthony show First of all, the grammar there is fantastic And uh do an open casting call for women who want to be in a porno of all women gotten from the opium anthony show Now what you're trying to say here is We open up the phone lines And say okay girls, uh call up now We are producing a porno movie So we want uh, it's a it's a forno a porno movie featuring you the girls that listen to opium anthony. Yes Okay Only women would be allowed up into the studio. No men would be allowed in because of the number of people expected So you're you're expecting a lot huge turnout if we said we are casting for a porno You're just convinced that there's going to be just hundreds of women showing up at the station, right? Yes, because I believe that there are a lot of girls out there who want to do this But just don't know how to go about doing it. Okay, and and why no men? Why well because you know, they would just be in the way and everything plus you You always get upset whenever you see men when you have girls on the lesbian count true Okay, that is a true thing right there Okay, if the men are interested in getting into the film Send their lady to be evaluated and if the woman makes the cut I will speak with the men myself after the casting call. Hey, hey, hey, what the hell does that mean? So you're going to be the porno director, right? Uh, actually you want to take this idea on so you would be the porno director Yeah, all right. So you want to interview uh guys girls. Yes girlfriends, right? Yes So how do they get in the film if their lady's uh been evaluated and is going to make the cut Well, like they you know walk on scene or something like that If if they if they're interested in getting into this line of work, then we talk them off because they wouldn't actually be making in studio Because we don't have men in the So you will speak with the men myself after the casting call now see if they'll be part of the the film What would you speak to them about? I don't even get like okay a guy says hey I want to be in the porno movie and then and you say well Let me see your hot girlfriend, right and then you evaluate the girlfriend Yeah So then what are you going to say to the guy after the girl is like makes the cut? Though we might be able to work you went into a walk on at walk on part. Um We'll take a look at you know Your resume I guess and then we'll get back to you Okay, all right, you know, uh, we should give uh craig from belmore a prize today He remembered spaz's last idea Oh, what was it? Remember ant the eight man fight club between show regulars. All right, that was it and then craig goes what a loser Craig we we know your email address. Give us a phone number because we're going to give you a prize. Okay? Because that's that's good. I forgot all about that that spaz idea I will uh, I will speak with the men myself after the casting call The women will be expected to get naked be evaluated describe past sexual experiences Answered questions of a sexual nature and at the very end all interested women that make the cut will take part in a mass lesbian for a day casting couch audition Now without getting into the wwf or something. It's like some battle royale with lesbians without getting into any uh details uh Women expecting to get naked and be evaluated describe their past sexual experiences Does that sound vaguely familiar of another program that airs in this city vaguely sure in the morning Don't you realize like we like we try to do stuff that uh that is a little different So it's and and even try uh harder than usual so as to avoid any comparison Have you ever seen a program where maybe a girl gets up takes her clothes off and is evaluated by the members of this other program? And that's why I don't think we've ever used the word evaluate on this program But he's never had it on film No, not on film not on two tv shows. No, no jesus jesus h christ All right. All right to guarantee there will definitely be some action that day. Well, this is way back up this Yeah, this is this is when they're doing the lesbian for a day casting couch audition. Yes, and no they will be taking part in a mass lesbian for a day Casting couch audition. How many how many lesbians are you going to get on the couch at one time? I I figure we can fit as many thousands open well on the couch around the couch Okay And then as and said to guarantee that there will definitely be some action that day I will supply some ringers who will definitely perform Spaz where are you getting ringers? I know of a source to get ringers. Where where's your source anthony the limo driver, right? No, not him. Oh, it's a friend of mine. What's your source a friend of mine johnny action. No Who's your source? I am the invisible man earl's friend. I have a source What's your freaking source? Do you my friend? Don't you think we wouldn't ask you if we actually considered this idea for a? Nano-second we wouldn't ask you what your source is my source is a friend of mine who's who's done a film before your friend gary Let's just yes gary who did the porno movie with me in it for 10 seconds and with you in it for 10 seconds Where you were what just a I was a cop you were a cop. That's right Spaz is like trying to be larry flint So he'll supply some ringers spaz is casting for uh, colegula two The film itself will be shot here in new york city. Oh good We want to fly off to an exotic location The film itself we shot here in new york It would be done in the gonzo style Allowing for more free-form Freewheeling anything goes style you effing moron. What the hell is that? What is gonzo style? It'd be like anything goes what do you mean anything goes? That's what happens in every porno It's just called porno. It's not called gonzo porno. It will be done in the gu I prefer making films in the gonzo style Lovie You know who and the muppet show gonzo style and who's your influence like the gonzo style Now are there people you respect in the porno business that you follow there are professionals But the thing is like usually there are restrictions like it'd be like Anything we can use like tools like I don't know they can Within this there are usually restrictions on a different portal. Okay in this porno. We're not going to use toys It pornos are like that But this would be opening whatever the girl wants to do she could do it She said what if a girl wants to take a shovel and then slam it on the back of the head of another lesbian Well, no violence, of course. I'm talking about sexual a lot of sex they want to take one of the cars. How about bloodletting? If that's what they're into oh Oh my god, dude, but in the sexual nature, whatever's ironic to them All right. So all right. So you want to have an open casting call for uh for Will be called the opiate anthony porno Will our names be associated with this or will it be dispatched porno? No, if you choose you have a name for this film not yeah But you guys could be associated as much as you're right. Well, we all strive to be porn directors and producers That's really our goal here. But you kind of do it. It's not like we get in in trouble Uh for explaining too explicitly Genitalia or anything. We'll just film a porno and put it out there. Yeah, we have like 10 women that listen to us We'll convince them to come in here for this mass lesbian for a day casting couch audition And then the girls are allowed to do whatever the hell they want. Yeah Yeah, i'm sure the phones are going to ring off the hook with ladies that want to want to do this. That is jerk diggler You never know oh my god taylor what's going on? Hey guys, I got a great idea for a contest Yeah, what? Yeah, it's called the beat the crap out of spaz contest. I like it already Open the phone lines and the first 102 callers Get to kick the crap out of spaz. Yeah. All right. Thank you taylor later brother God damn you get people so freaking pissed off. Ah, jason did you think this up on your two and a half hour train ride today? Jason what's up? What's up guys? Yeah, i'm just wondering is spaz like gonna go for the uh retarded pizza boy delivery guy in this? Very good jason very good god All right. So we got to move on this is this is just explaining the film So you you haven't really explained the gonzo style pretty much anything goes is your answer to that, right? Yeah, pretty much everything. All right. So the film itself would be shot here in new york city It would be done in the gonzo style allowing for a more freeform freewheeling anything goes style It will only star women gotten from the casting call gotten from the cast There will be multiple scenes shot with a variety of different things to highlight each scene Right. Yes. Okay, and you explain some of these uh different highlights of your porno film, right? Yes, one of them being both opi and anthony are invited to come and direct the scene either together or separately Yeah, what does that mean? We come down and direct a scene. Yes You're out of you lost your mind somewhere, right? You can direct is there going to be a thrilling scene that I can direct where a boyfriend gropes his girlfriend before he goes on a Two-hour commute. That's a fun. That'd be a fun scene, huh? Are you insane? We have we have a studio location where you guys can go unseen about here. Here's what happened. All right, here's what happened Spaz and his porn frigging want to be director got together for a few too many beers Uh and spaz decided that he's gonna hook this guy up with a way to sell his porno He's gonna use opi and anthony Crap, you're flattering us by saying we'll direct a scene So, of course if we direct a scene in a porno, you don't think we're gonna be talking about like crazy on the air So spaz is sitting there with his buddy going. Okay, how can I get oh i'll entice opi and anthony say yes But i'll invite them to direct the scene. They can't refuse that I'm appalled that you would even say that are you i'm appalled That you would come up with this I think it was right up your alley a great idea and you know, at least i'm trying with ideas It's just because I have the spaz moniker. It doesn't mean that every idea is stupid A lot of these ideas could be good Are you kidding this idea i'm telling you it's golden tommy. What's golden now? It's golden tommy. What's up? What is his definition of gonzo? Uh gonzo. Wait, I got it gonzo style. Uh, it would be done in the gonzo style allowing for a more free-form freewheeling anything goes style It spaz can you name me? One porno that you know that is done in gonzo style I don't know i've been spoken to the directors because you don't know what gonzo is gonzo is amateur porn It has nothing to do with freewheeling anything but man you guys heard about man, right? Yeah, the adventures of butt man Yeah, of course that's gonzo gonzo So gonzo gonzo basically means amateur, correct Okay, so I guess spaz could probably do it being an idiot amateur. Seymour butts gonzo amateur gonzo Uh, i'm the biggest debbie. Uh debbie does dallas What's that debbie does dallas? No, not not gonzo. Okay tracy lords films. Uh, not gonzo not gonzo. Okay Now that we have that straight very good like we said he doesn't always talk about the baz is going to film it in bozo style The pam and tommy lee tape Okay, there you go now we're understanding that at least thank you tommy. All right, you got it. Thanks All right Let's go to glenn real fast and we got to move on with the idea because just another proud day in iona college history Right right here right now. Uh glenn. What's up? Hey guys, i'm looking for somebody to back me in a new stuff snuff spaz film Yeah, that's my proposal. Yeah, I want I want to do a spaz a snuff film Yeah, spaz if you would help out here's my proposal We do an open casting call to murderers that want to come down here and blow your effing head off live on film But first they have butt sex with you and opi and I can be invited into direct this scene And you know, I think I would uh, I would go for that one On So both opi and anthony are invited to come and direct the scene either together or separately. Yes Jesus christ Pazzoid mind trick ona will direct the scene. He's trying to do a jedi minecraft. Yeah. Yeah, you want to direct the scene, right? These are not the porn stars you're looking for All right, check this out more about the film anthony besides us directing Have one of the non cbs contracted people associated with the show actually appear and perform in a scene example old dirty He's dragging old dirty into the porno If he wants to be in it was all dirty in the meeting with you and your uh, Porn, I want to be guy.

There's more there's more to the concept Uh, we're talking about spaz's idea. He wants to have a uh porno casting call and he wants basically an open anthony porno But he's not saying that but spaz would be the director um Okay more about the film have some of the sexual positions discussed on the show performed in the film Example the rusty trombone the wheelbarrow So, uh the girls that come in for the open casting call will be doing the rusty trombone on the likes of old dirty Not in the studio but in the disclosed location at what's this undisclosed location not disclosed location Undisclosed i'm sorry at what at the uh at the guy who's filming it.

Yes, so you've already Just in case it was a go Just in case it was a go I am Just when you think he can't do it just when you think there's uh, the giant mosquito or the cancerous live wires Just when you think he cannot get stupider come up with something that will just mesmerize you Uh michelle says michelle says she's interested michelle. Are you interested in the spaz porno? Hi, yeah, I am can I expect the spaz hear me? Yeah Uh, I had a fib a little to get on the air But I was just wondering if he liked his girlfriend a little bit and even cared Even cared what she thought about with his ideas. Yeah, have you run this past erika? She heard me and gary talking it over. And what did she think about the one god? If erika's listening, please give us a call Give me her number erika would never agree and i'll stay on the line and no erika would kill him for it All right. Thank you michelle. Thank you. Not one lady's calling saying that she wants to be in this spaz porno Uh, this just in from the unbelievable the invisible man checking in from uh, from the statin island furry Her name is spaz kush kush hainston Earl and I want to direct the scene too. Oh the invisible man wants to yeah, can we have the invisible man? We'll just have some chick like uh Uh, what oh my god Okay, spaz is writing something say no What what not a good time to call erika easy why uh personal personal problems What you have another personal problem. There's nothing to me. No it has to do with erika's family Okay, all right personal family problems. Sure. All right. We'll get her on another time. I'm sure i'm sure she would uh, just be thrilled That you're you want to go through with this idea? Uh, well, she actually didn't say anything She just because she was storming out and discussed probably Really? Oh my god. All right. Uh, well, there's uh more to the porno casting call anthony. Oh really spaz does slotsberg But not from jersey who comes up with funny stuff every day the name of the spaz porno should be called spaz does slotsberg Very good. Okay. Uh now the porno names are gonna start coming in unbelievable Uh, all right the bonus of doing the are we calling it officially the opium anthony porno or the spaz porno? Whatever you want to ask by opium. What would it be called? You must have knocked around some names with gary and then Whatever the other porn guys you were with Basically, we would leave it totally up to you what you want to call it and how much you want to get involved with So basically we would do all the work and you would get the credit, right? No, no, no, everybody would get credit for their we would promote the hell out of this opium I know as to uh, you know get our name in the porno industry That's exactly it's not it's not hard enough showing up at the goddamn uh Thanksgiving dinners with my family for what we're doing here on the air as as we speak Yeah, but you know if I could just add Porn director and porn my resume porn promoter onto my resume my life would be happy That's one thing. I really want to get into Pornography, you don't have to promote it. You just direct the one scene This whole thing is promoting a porno for one day for one day I asked one day this is all going to happen in one day filming everything one day We can't get through those spazzes. We can review in one day. I beg you to do a porno We'll have nothing to do with it, but I beg you to do it because I I need a good laugh It would be the funniest thing I ever see in my life. We film we want the director's cut too Who the hell are you hanging out with? Who are your friends are you on the pipe you're hanging out with with uh, moronic Extreme wrestlers that pound each other's brains in with two by fours and and want to be porn guys You know what he was in a film. How could it be a wannabe if he was already in a film that's been released By the way and selling copies Selling copies selling copies speaking of that. What would happen? With this porno, where would it end up? It would end up in the porno stores and selling Uh uncle john wants to say some real fast uncle john. Hi guys. How's it going? Great Hey, I want to volunteer to buy drugs and plant them in spaz's house We can like have a lottery to call the cops you get some mustard What do you think? I like the idea man. All right, cool. Rock on guys. Fuck you. What What I want to say was give john some credit he comes up with good s every day I'm effing believe will there be a scene where a giant mosquito Comes in and and starts up railing this woman with with the proboscis If you want that in the film we can have somebody get wouldn't that be funny a big giant mosquito comes in with the nose Like a dildo That would have to be some wacky cartoon porn. Yeah. Yeah And just starts going at oh All right, um allen from england, new jersey. Holy f Earl may have an invisible friend, but I think that spaz has an effing invisible brain. Yeah Yeah All right spaz admitted you used to write for the mason kolinsky show, right The anti-brain All right. Listen, all right. So let's uh, all right now he has bonuses anthony to this whole All right, it has opiate anthony porno, whatever. Now he's going to spell out the upside to this whole thing Okay, this is the big pitch Right where he he you know was going to get us with his pitch here it is just for allowing the casting call to take Place I will supply you with two dozen videos to be given to the audience So wait, we're going to get two dozen of the finished product. Yes to give out his prizes Yeah, because you did the uh, the opi's uh, porno you you did that as a giveaway So I figured if you could do that and you do this is good All right. All right And uh, if we are allowed to shoot the casting call and include scenes in the movie I will try to get at least a gross of films to be supplied to the show Oh, you're gonna try to get a gross and how many isn't a gross? I don't know I really don't It's sounding good also No, it grosses but he's gonna try to get us one No, but gross is like the full amount of gross is that you have a brain in your head that you ain't using And a poor retard is walking around drooling on himself Also a live event can be planned to coincide with the release of the film good And we have all and we can have all the players involved appear Yeah, well, it's it's like a like a release party Yeah release Any questions contact me 9 1 7 4 2 2 6 1 8 9 We could have porno sticker stops We'll put the the wow stickers at porno locations now speck are you getting uh, are you getting uh, Beep there spaz you getting beeped. No, my pager goes on and off from time to time. All right, so um, Do you have a basic idea for this porno you get all the girls involved our listeners? Yes, it'd be basically a lot of girl on girl scenes a lot of girl on girl scenes right spaz jeremy Me We filmed just one scene here of the lesbian couch of all the girls involved Well, if we can't film it here, then we just film everything in the undisclosed location We just have the casting call here. It's the undisclosed uh location your apartment. No, where is the undisclosed location right here? Manhattan it's in manhattan. We need to know because i'm convinced there's a girl tied up there right now. Just waiting for rok, right? No All right spaz Now you got you got 60 seconds to give us the final pitch The final what else can you add before we give you our answer? Okay, um, I think it's right up your alley you guys going to talk about porno a lot you guys have lesbian couch I figure spice it up by having more than one or two girls on the couch at the same time And they'll be they'll be doing everything but you probably can't describe it on the air But for your amusement off the air on the air did just stick your tongues anywhere they want And um, I just think it'd be uh good and it'd be something a little spin-off a little different from just doing the ordinary lesbian On the couch and would it be more good more good? Okay? Yeah, good. It'd be like a spin-off of what you what you're really doing it, you know, just to take it to the next level Yeah, spin-off opi a little cute spin-off show Spaz. Yeah When you when next time you get together with your uh porno friends your friends in the pornography industry. Yeah Uh, please don't bring up our names. Don't bring up the fact that uh, you're going to be like You're going to try to be the big guy that you're going to promote them His spaz is going to be the big guy He's going to be the big shot and go into his porno friends and say guys I got a way where we can make a porno we're going to uh, uh Advertise it on the opi and anthony show And uh, we're all going to get rich and i'm going to pay off my forty seven thousand dollar debt with pornography With the help of opi and anthony because that's it spaz. That's what you were doing Why else are you going to sit there? What then why not just get together with your friends and make a porno and not let us even know about it Never mind try to drag our names into it because I thought that I could bring a show idea to you You think we want to endorse porno? A porn movie you did the opi thing. No, that's not endorsing anything Did you give an orno that came out called opi does south south south central or something like that all of a sudden So it was it was a stupid quick little idea. Let's give out some to people of age. That's all Yeah, and they had to come down here live and in person produce id showing that they were 21 and then we gave them the uh, The tape but you have listening on the couch So what's the difference if we just spaz not one girl good not one girl is called That one girl was interested not one girl is called she wasn't interested she wanted to abuse you I just figured just have more than one or two girls on the couch as usual. Uh laura what's going on? I just want to know if spaz really thinks that even if us girls would want to do a porno Would we really do a porno with his name on it? I mean after everything that I mean, I don't mean to like, you know, diss him or anything But I mean he talks about giant mosquitoes and things like that I really wouldn't want to be in a porno that has to do with his name That's not good publicity, you know That's why he was trying to get us involved We yeah, if anything, yeah, exactly the publicity That's why he wants to do it on the show believe it or not and I still have our good names barely but we do Yeah, I think you guys are you guys are doing really good If this would be a bad idea for you guys to get into I think all right laura That's what we would love to do and boy the company would just yeah again Hey, god, could I get my name on that porno? That sounds great Now you boys are talking that's about a smart businessman, right? I want you open Anthony To help out the company by doing a porno Do you honestly think That that would fly you honestly you you printed this out. Do you want to go to ken stevens? Maybe no No, no, no why? Why it's a great idea for the show Why wouldn't you present this to the big boss here the general manager the one that you want to bond with and get closer with Ken steven and show him what a great idea you have so he can embrace you as an employee of this company I'm gonna put a copy my copy in his mailbox coming back tomorrow. I want to send one to mel Can we do that? We'll just throw one off in that direction and end up at black rock and uh, he could read through this. Sure. Okay I it was a maybe ken could come in and direct the scene Maybe ken stevens would want to come down and direct his own scene I'm trying uh, yeah chris from stan island writes spaz can make a golden showers video girls getting leaked on from the roof of The ww building Uh Oh my god, so if you think it's such a good idea Why wouldn't you want us to give this to ken stevens because you never give any of the other show ideas to ken stevens before we do it Usually give it to him after we do it. He actually has a good point there. Well, you know why That's us spaz. Did you fall off the train this morning? No rolling behind the train Spaz you you got it you have to without naming the station Or anything else? You got to tell anthony the other show idea you had in the office last week. Oh my god, what are the one? About the power grid Oh, oh, come on. That's a good idea too. You were serious about this. Where's better? You were honestly serious about this Get ben and rick on the mic dead serious. All right. Listen, don't name the station Don't name what power company that you have friends at Yeah, but explain there's so many of them explain your other show idea. I met somebody at uh, The wrestling who works for a power company And he said that he could shut off the grid that a certain other station belongs to and just during I guess whatever time of day we choose Uh-huh Do you know how many years in jail you would get if you pulled off that in jail? Not not just fired fired from this company Which I think now uh would do we own baskin robbins now, too You wouldn't be able to sling ice cream at this point You won't even be able to work at blockbuster after you got out of uh doing 10 years If I let me let me Let me see it again spaz came to us last week and had an idea of turning off a power grid power grid right Here in the city to get rid of our competition for a day Or you can shut down just the building itself Only an idea. Oh really? Right dying in elevator. You would be arrested so freaking fast But I would have nothing to do with though because i'm not the one pulling the switch Oh when they come to anton I very suspicious you think we're not going to you know So you don't have nothing to do with with throwing the switch But the guy that approached you if you said yes, he would do it But you had nothing you did there's not nothing uh like a conspiracy Do you know what the word conspiracy means to conspire? I said I said you could do it But I don't want to I don't want to know what to think about it. We'd all be uh thrown in jail thrown in jail fired and just Do you remember a few years back where you probably don't because you for some reason I don't know how you even got into the radio industry because you probably haven't heard any lessons There was a woman That cut a power line to a remote broadcast. We're not talking knocking out an entire portion of a Of the biggest city in the world. We're not talking about that. She cut the power line Of a a very popular radio host Uh during his show so only his show got knocked off the air They brought her up on charges that she had to get a lawyer and fight uh criminal charges and she was just fired Fine she did the actual cutting Right, so she that's why no, I actually uh, whatever. No, she didn't no she didn't it was her idea But it wasn't my idea was his idea. I said I could do it, but I don't want anything about it You can't even tell him you could do it. Don't tell anyone to do crap like that for our radio show. I I Don't want to know anything about it quickly becoming a liability You got to be smart enough to say dude, you're insane.

Yes, you know, we wanted to talk to our spaz Why would you get on the phone and give her a hard time because like I criticized for for not Protecting her and dragging her through the air and now what I do know is that that was in the beginning when I was being called Like a sudden whore, okay Right now this is like innocent little what I think about your porno idea. All right, and What do you think? I am just shocked. I am stunned that he Thinks it would be okay with me to just check out naked chicks And what was it evaluate them? Well Evaluate them. I wouldn't be doing the evaluating No, no, no spaz. Let me let me read from your uh from your one sheet here The women will be expected to get naked be evaluated describe past sexual experience answer questions of a sexual nature And at the very end all interested women that make the cut will take part in a mass lesbian for day casting couch audition Yeah, but gary would be included too Gary erica, what's with gary's what's this gary guy like? He's really nice. I is it Well, that's interesting All right. Now mr porno and and spaz mr porno will supply some ringers too erica. Yeah Spaz is going to supply some ringers that'll get the uh action hot and heavy what i'm confused about is He's very very protective of me right doesn't let me do a lot of things and Checks up on me constantly. I don't understand what meeks Can think that that would have been like, okay cool with me And you don't check up on me i'm not saying that kevin because You freaking cheated on me. What do you want you to do? I love you. You're driving me crazy like with this crap like And of course I because we have new listeners to the show the only reason erica found out that spaz cheated on her was Because he wrote it on his calendar The calendar they they share it in their apartment The only reason why the whole world knows is because erica decided to announce it Oh now he's getting down on you. She was she was hurting Spaz you you cheated on a girl and wrote it on your calendar. Yeah, but still you don't announce it to a million people I know you just write it on your calendar might as well just add some skywriter write it outside your apartment Uh, that could be arranged like You're turning on me kevin. It's not don't get on erica about this Ask erica nicely. There's one what she thinks of spaz's porno idea If there's one ass you should just be making out with it's erica's i'm amazed She sticks by you i'm not making out with any other ass. I don't mean it in that way I mean it as you should kiss her ass I mean she you you should be blaming her for for any messes. Uh, you get yourself into For the love of god the girl is i'm amazed at her power. It's erica. Do you do heroin? No, okay, i'm trying to figure out how the hell you do it I don't really know Honestly, the poor girl is like stands by you for everything rick's puking Can't hold And the first chance you get you're trying to blame her or or turn it on to her i'm not blaming it for anything All right, uh justin wants to ask erica does spaz come up with great ideas at home Oh, yeah tons of them. Yeah. Yeah Never see the light of day like what any you can tell us Uh, no, not really. No, okay. I'd be curious though if he evaluates me you evaluate me kevin What do you mean when i'm standing there nika do you evaluate me your head when you uh when you maul her in the morning Did he maul you this morning? Uh this morning this morning a little bit a little mauling What is he doing like reach under the sheets and cop a feel what what is he doing? Yeah Is that what you do?

Yeah Is it true that spaz bought a really expensive scale for your for your apartment? Well, yeah, he bought a scale and said like buy another stuff that we needed What kind of scale is your 40 scale? Why why do you need a 40? He's the cheapest one there. Why do you need a where did you buy a scale a drug store bed bath and beyond? Bed bath and beyond you can go Jesus christ, do you know spaz you can go? To like k-mart and pick up a scale for about five bucks It might not be as accurate but unless you're weighing cocaine to sell to the homies. I don't think you need something Plus or minus, you know a gram It's it's scale 40 bucks, maybe you ought to cut some corners, but you know And and try to save a little cash unless of course you think that the boat is going to be coming in with 47 grand On this porno project porno Erika, he wants to go into porno. I know I know He's got a great opportunity here He's he's in at the ground floor At a radio station that's just starting to make a name working on a show that is pretty hot in the city and He he wants to go into porno.

He's spaz is the guy that like let me tell you takes the brunt of of of the crap at work And then goes home Come on Fast your lovely girlfriend has done nothing wrong here Just mellow out. She should be upset. It's a crazy idea I don't think my girlfriend would be thrilled if I told her hey, uh, we're gonna We're gonna make a porno and i'm gonna direct it. Yeah, and i'm gonna evaluate the girls beforehand I'm gonna try to use the show i'm on uh to uh promote it because that's what you're doing. That's not it Oh, come on spaz. I just thought I present a nice idea for you guys to participate in if you don't like it Then that's cool. Here we go spaz. I we read through this already Give me one frigging upside to doing this on this program one upside one. Go ahead. You get to see porn chicks So who can we see? Every day we see girls in here. They're usually like what we saw with the strippers the other day It's a different spinoff of how to do a different spinoff. What's the upside for this program? Now even though it wouldn't be an upside on a personal level for us to see this Uh, which you seem to think it would be I mean for a show for this program to progress from the point It is now of working its way up doing very well. How does this help the show? Because okay. Yeah, okay. Well today what do we got for the show? Let's be on the couch. Ho hum again But this time it's different. When was the last time we did that? We haven't done it in a while. We haven't done that in a while because we do things we rotate stuff But it's a repetition though of okay We got two girls who let's be in the couch and then we we elaborate on it by doing what we did We drip the candles on it. It's acceptable. It's uh good for the spaz cam. It works as far as uh, nobody getting Communicable diseases. I mean there's This it does not help this program. You know who this helps your porno buddies and it helps you maybe maybe Doesn't help me at all. I don't benefit at all from this All right, and you get two dozen videos to give to your audience I don't maybe a gross but I gotta see how much that is the company controls that not me And is there any kind of a partnership? What did they offer you? What did they honestly offer you? I see you friggin smiling. So I know they said something What did they offer spaz personally? I get to approach us with this idea. I get one thing I get I get the um But then I presented the idea and what do you get in return that I get the recognition you get no cut of Videos made I get the recognition the recognition of the idea recognition You get the but but your friends that are going to produce this video package it and market it offer you not dime one No, because it belongs to a production company owns the rights to the film. So how much is your buddy getting? So how much is your buddy getting I don't know how much he gets because he's he's the one it's going to be You know, uh, I know the producing for it. It's with a company's with a production company No one said spaz look you'll get like uh, two percent of of the gross They don't control that the company does I haven't been in contact with the company.

So I guess relatively speaking it's safe, but you can't tell that to the 17 people But uh this one they they bungee jump out of a cable car 30,000 jumps successfully made out of this cable car and what they do they could move the cable car I guess to a different location jump Further or or not for they did that as part of one of the road rules Yeah, where they put the cable car in the middle of a gorge or whatever And then a chasm whatever and then they jumped out. Sure. Yeah Well, uh this guy bungee jumper falls 300 feet to his death Head he did a header on the pavement on the pavement, man That's pretty terrible Uh, yeah, he's dead They're trying to speculate as to what happened And they say uh, well, it was pretty safe shortly before the man's death two other groups made a 540 foot jump out of the uh, cable car at a different location and uh, they're looking into whether they failed to change the the bungee cords From the 540 foot jump to the 300 foot ones oops That's about 240 Too much 240 feet. Yeah 240 feet a cord too much head first into a parking lot Pavement man, you know what a head sounds like when it hits pavement from 300 feet You ever see those big light bulbs and it used to throw on the ground and they go And that's what they sound I was I was at a uh football game when I was in buffalo Saw a guy there was like a hill They they used to play some sick games while the bills were playing they would they would play king of the hill Yeah, all right. There was a sick hill that was all ice and snow And basically there were a bunch of idiots up top and and you would attempt to climb up And become king of the hill and hundreds and hundreds of people would do this and people would slide down and just take your legs Out from underneath you and stuff. It was the sickest thing But one guy was like halfway up the hill so he might have been 10 to 15 feet off the ground okay, and this guy just runs full speed from the top of the hill and just takes him out and Tackles him and I saw live this guy's uh coconut just split wide open because right the bottom of this hill is just pavement I saw that from 15. Just this guy falling 15 feet His uh noggin, you know split wide open people were sick for like hours after that I got the dry heaves immediately because the sound it made it popped it pops people's heads popped So continue this story just under there just imagining, you know A guy has seen a guy hit uh pavement from 300 feet Yeah, they they actually it was so bad.
