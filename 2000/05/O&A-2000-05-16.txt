 Opie and Anthony. Unfortunately, guys, you guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. Go pick a mitle! It's the Opie and Anthony Show! Hell yeah! For this fine Tuesday, May 16th, 2000. What's happening? Full line 2127571027. Lots to do today, Anthony. Oh yeah. Otto and George stopping by in about a half hour. Yes. One of our favorite, favorite, favorite comedians out there. Makes us laugh our damn bag off. We love Otto and George. So he's coming in. Actually, it's Otto and his pup George that are coming in for a quick visit today. Yeah. In about a half hour. We gotta find a place to do a road show next week. I thought we were set up. What happened? The gig fell through. The gig fell through, is right, Anthony. The gig fell through. We're going to the air full site. Seems like a lot of people a little timid. Little frightened? Little frightened of you and I and our listeners, Anthony. Why? Just because like a year ago we had human beer cozy on stage? Well, yeah. Is that one of the reasons we won't be returning to that venue? We honestly thought we would return to the trade winds this year. Yeah. We gave you guys a ton of money last year. That was a hell of a gig. All I'm going to say is it's not looking too good to go back to the trade winds. No. We want to throw a summer kickoff party next Thursday. Summer kickoff party! We obviously need a place that can hold at least 1,500 people. We need a place that has a lot of outdoor space. Yeah. Because if it's nice and sunny next Thursday because we want to broadcast live. You know, we want to be outside catching the rays and drinking the beers and stuff. Sure. So I don't know, man. We thought we had some locations. We're not happy with any of the locations presented to us. So now we're screwed because I mean last year we had a great time the day before the big Memorial Day weekend. Yeah. And I don't know. We're trying to pull this out of our butt. We have like nine days to figure this out. What happened? So if you know of a place that is willing to accommodate the show. On the beach. On the beach, close to the beach. On the beach, huh? Some place that has that kind of summer feel to it. Please, please give us a call. Mm-hmm. We'll go to Long Island. We'll go to Jersey. We'll go to Westchester. We'll go to Connecticut. We don't care. It's just got to be the right place. Right. So we're going to try to figure that out today. Good luck. Also another wow sticker stop happening today, Anthony. Yeah. Did Earl leave? No, he's right there. No. Earl, will you get there at 430 today? Where is he going? Come on, Morpheus. Morpheus? Yeah, you're looking like Morpheus more and more every day. Morpheus. That's a good one. He really is, though. I've never heard of that one, yeah. With those shades and stuff? Yeah. My favorite Earl nickname, though, is Earlco. Earlco. Remember Urco? We got to put the view. We got to put down all his nicknames someday. Put Mook on there. Mook. Mook. The Sloth. Black Earl. The Gimp. The Gimp. Gero. Gero, personal friend of the Invisible Man. All right, listen. So Earl, you're leaving soon? Yeah. You're going to be there by 430 today? Absolutely. So I can announce that you're going to be at this place at 430? Mm-hmm. So we're going to be going down to the Lakeside Deli, Anthony. Yeah. In Verona, New Jersey. Verona. The hometown of J. Moore. Yeah, it's a bunch of pig farms down there, huh? I'm over here now. It's what, on Bloomfield Avenue down there in Verona? Okay. Lakeside Deli, Verona, New Jersey, hometown of J. Moore. This is an RC Edge sticker stop. We're going to have the brand new Wow stickers. Nice. Earl's going to be on hand. He's going to also have some of the RC Edge posters of The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Autograph posters of The Rock, The Edge, China, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. That's huge. Yes. And WWF tickets for the June 24th show at the Garden. So there's a lot going on with this Wow sticker stop, okay? Yeah. Are we going to encourage the ladies to come down? They're a little intimidated. Ladies, don't be intimidated by our listeners. They're harmless. Yeah. They're crazy, they're wild, but they're harmless when it gets right down to it. Oh, I worry spas won't try to cast you in a porno or anything. No, no. You don't have to be fearful of that. All right. And we've got to take one more quick break, and we're going to start the show officially. But the Wow sticker stop today is at the Lakeside Deli, Verona, New Jersey, Bloomfield Avenue down there in Verona. Earl's going to be down there with a ton of stuff, including the brand new Wow stickers, okay? Right. If you're on hold, please stay there. We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back. As we go to commercials, we had a few requests for this on the email. And we'll be back. Good afternoon, library. Hi. I was wondering if you could help me. I will try. Okay. My son came home with a list of books that he needs to read for his fourth grade class. Okay. Why don't I switch you to the children's and she can see if she can help you with one you might need. Ah, thanks a lot. Sure. Hold on, please. Children's, Department Kieran speaking. Hi, Karen. I need to come into the library and pick up a few books for my son. Okay. He came home with a reading list from his fourth grade class. Uh-huh. Do you have Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach? Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach. Doesn't sound familiar. Doesn't mean we don't have it. Is there any way you can look that up? Yeah. Okay. Do you have others that you're looking for? Yeah, I guess there's a whole Harry Beaver collection. Okay. Now, he doesn't sound familiar, but that's not 100% certain. I guess he's a new author out of Seattle. Okay. Writes children's books. Okay. It's Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach. Uh-huh. Harry Beaver on the Dyke. The Dyke. Okay. Harry Beaver Gets Wood. Gets Wood. And finally, Harry Beaver and the One-Eyed Wonderworm. Okay. Why don't you hold on just a second and I'll check the computer to see if we've got any of these, okay? All right. Thanks a lot. Sure. Harry Beaver collection. Thanks a lot. Harry Beaver collection. Thanks Max. Thank you for waiting. I checked our computer here and we don't own any of them and I also wanted to see if anybody in the region has any of them. And nobody's coming up with any of the Harry Beaver books. And I also looked in our children's books in print for 1997 and I didn't come up with any Harry Beaver in there either. That's awfully strange. If it's really new, it may just be that nobody has it yet. So no one has Harry Beaver yet. No. It doesn't look that way. Harry Beaver doesn't come up on the computer. No. All right. Do you have any of the Bobby series? Bobby. Now, I'm not familiar with Bobby either. There's one book on this list. It's Bobby Goes Muff Diving. Do you have an author for these at all? An author? Yeah, let me see here. Oh, Anita Buschlicker. Is this the best radio you guys can come up with? 1027 WNEW. Let us now sit back, relax and enjoy the sounds of Kathie Lee Gifford off of her new album, Born For You. Yes, this is the title track, Anthony. This album put out as a message of love to Frank, I want some anal Gifford. We got a special copy of this CD as you're about to discover along with us today.

There's a picture of her in the tub There's a picture of her in the tub with Cassidy Gifford all covered with bubbles and they're kissing each other while naked in the bathtub.

I tried to learn from you guys, you know, but I think you should do the same thing to her CD that you did to the Elvis that you made stay in the bathroom. Oh, there's an idea! We should file it?

I was starting to enjoy that. Wait, wait, I think Cody's still twitching. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! The Vulcan Cannon! That's just god awful. Yeah, that's pretty bad stuff. Well, let me, um, congrats to you there. Let me just file it. You want to file it away somewhere where, uh, we can somewhere say, well, let me shield myself. Yeah, no, no, and there's no reason to. I'm sure we're going to want to put it in the CD player and find it some more. Is it going to go next to the, uh, the Elvis Guy CD? Or is it going to be in between the Elvis Guy CD and the We Deliver Keggers? Um, in the same pile as the We Deliver Keggers Elvis Guy. Yeah, okay, sure. Well, file that away. What's wrong, everyone? What do you mean? Why are you covering your face? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just going to put it over here, file it. I'm going to file it. Oh, there we go. Holy s***. You ever see a CD come apart like that? Hey, Manny. Ow, I just ran over it. You hear that? Listen, let's do the whole effing village. Listen, I'm going to run over it more. With your chair. Whoa! Nice. Oh, he's going crazy on that thing. Oh, my God. Boy, you really enjoyed that one. That's great. I wonder if it would be even possible to add a CD to that. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I wonder if it would be even possible to have sex to that album. It would just be like trying to like use a piece of rope. Wet noodle. There's no one out there brave enough to tell Kathie Lee to her face that that is just God awful. Johnnie from Queens checking in, time to get drunk. The drinking game, finish a bottle if OP cracks a CD. Thanks, now I got to get wrecked. Oh, yeah, we got to take a break. Oh, yeah, we got to take a break. We thought we'd share the musical stylings of Kathie Lee Gifford today. When Frank sees my buttocks, I open up wide. Issues and Anthony show. His yam bag is like Turkish taffy on a hot summer day. Yeah, Rick took a hit. Rick took a hit. Good one. There's still some big, still some pieces that are bigger than one square centimeter. These are the boarder pop, and I look buttons are coming off of the board. I broke part of the board. What did you do? You just hit your hand on the mic? Slam it. That's a very expensive piece of equipment. Very sensitive piece of equipment. Yeah, those are like thousand dollar microphones. 1700. Great. Oh, dear. What's wrong with the little anal, Kathie Lee? Give it up for Frank. Little Cody, start looping now. I can't look. I'm trying to... Oh, he's just smashing. He's like, oh, hi. All right. Yeah, that was great. Chris, what's going on? Guys, you've got to do me a favor. It's bad enough that you have spaz on the radio. But now you're putting Kathie Lee Gifford on. The next time you play that song, I'm going to send you a bill because I'm taking the largest metal object I can find and I'm digging it through my radio. Doesn't that sound like one of those like a horror movie things? My God, it is atrocious. Do me a favor. The next time you find a Kathie Lee CD, only play it if it's the sound of somebody's large hairy banana choking up. Banana juice. Someone's got to send another one over here because we want to track through a couple more songs. PR's checking in. That is the worst CD I've ever heard. I'd rather listen to Joe Pesci and Johnny Bravo all day. Yeah. Johnny's back. We're running the rock. Yeah, that's great music to touch kids by. Come here. Come here, you little whore. Watch the ambag. Johnny Bravo's coming in tomorrow. Prison KY. Please don't play it anymore. Well, we can't. We broke it.

Otto and George playing Rascals Ocean Township tonight at 8pm. I highly recommend you go see Otto and George. Hell yeah. One of the funniest acts out there right now, Anthony. I left till I wet myself. Really? Very funny, very funny. Yeah, I know. I don't understand. They give them water and then there's a roll of toilet paper in front of them. Three cups of water and toilet paper. It's like some science experiment we're supposed to be performing. Absorbency. We're going to learn about absorbency. Man, the cab was flying up here. I took a cab up 8th Avenue. It was really flying. They're out of control. I felt like I should be shooting at the car behind me. George, calm down over there. The shows at Rascals went great. Yeah, we had a few empty seats though. I noticed a dead Cardinal was sold out every night though. He didn't even do the Anthony Show. He's sold out. I'm going to have the dead priest on stage tonight folks. Come on down. I tried to get the Cardinal but he wants the door. You know, screw him. Wow, George. A little uptight once again today I say. I used to drink, I used to curse, I used to do drugs, I used to cop some coke. Alty and Anthony rule. What the hell does that mean? What is this, ancient Rome? We don't have rulers. Come on, George. Give us some props. We're giving you some air time today. Yeah, cut them some slack. Man, it's dead in here. Yeah, we need some whores today. We need some whores or something. We need some whores up here. You scared them off, George. Did I? Yeah, you scared them off. I'm trying not to curse today. How am I going? I think you need a curse. Alright, poosah! Ah, poosah! Well, we were tracking through the brand new CD from Kathie Lee Gifford. Oh, man, I heard better sounds in a public toilet. What an un-talented whore. Take those little children and smash their heads on the edge of a sink. Crack that skull in the porcelain. Of course, it's George the Puppet who's very angry. Are you angry because Kathie Lee has a career and you don't? Oh, well, I don't know. She's just an annoying whore. Isn't she? I think we all agree with that one, George. She should goggle with Santa Flush. Dirty little whore. And her husband was trying to get some butt sex. Oh, really? Yeah, that seemed to be what tipped her off and she was all pissed. And then she put this album out, Born For You, as like a tribute to her family and how they were able to stay together even after Frank Gifford wanted butt sex from a prostitute. God, she's got to live with that. I love it. No matter what she does from this day forward, she's always got to live with the fact that her husband tried to get butt sex from a whore. George, do you try to get some butt sex every once in a while? Yeah, I know a prostitute. I need that. She's got a breakfast special. Lady! I think we lost that one, George. That's a funny joke. If you didn't gurgle. That's a bad word. I'm going to lose like ten seconds of airtime. Otto, you can't control your puppet over there. He's out of control. I stopped trying a while ago. Is he wearing a new shirt? I swear. Wait a minute. I think he's wearing a new turtleneck. Not too bad, huh? Yeah, the puppet's got a brand new shirt on today. Roll the towel. 50 cents a liar. Otto, do you dress him up in different little outfits? Not really. I'm looking at him. I'm not sure if that's a new shirt, is it? From the last time? I don't think so. No? Okay. It might have been buttoned, the jacket. Maybe the jacket was buttoned. That cute little denim jacket. Do you shop at Baby Gap for George? Take it easy now. This guy better be nice to Anthony. He's kind of a stiff, ain't he? You got Phil Hartman over here in a stiff. They're both good. Wow, George. Look at him looking right through there. Anthony's talented. Not that good looking, no. He's got a complexion like a Thomas's English Locket. Leave him alone now. I had my bouts with the zits back when I was a kid. Sorry, I don't have a face made out of smooth paper mache like you, George. Sandpaper, pal, it works. Do you pay anybody here all these lost children? No, they get paid a little bit. They don't? Not this guy. No. How old are you, pal? 22. 22? Why are you answering a puppet's thinking? You must masturbate constantly, huh? All the time. Hitchhike to heaven. You're doing wrong with masturbation, right, pal? Do you do Baywatch? No. No? What do you like? Videos. Oh, like X-rayed videos? Yeah, those are good. Did you see that 3D porno? I saw a guy leaving the theater with mayonnaise on his head. How was it? Very realistic. All that jizz. George, half this stuff's not even on the radio today. No. My eyes are tired. Tired? Yeah, I'm exhausted today. Why? What's on your mind, George? I couldn't sleep last night. I was watching cable. Look at this guy. Nice glasses, pal. You looked at all you could see, Jupiter. That's bad. He works hard for the show, George. Hi, Ben. You're helping out a lot like a band-aid on a dead body. I'm wandering around looking busy. Ben, get on mic and say hi to George. Benny! George, of course, the puppet. Otto, the normal nice guy here. Hey, Benny. How are you doing? How are you? That's nice material. You should make a sweater out of it. Oh, my God. Well, we've got to get Spaz in here so you can say hi to Spaz, too, George. Why do you call him Spaz? Oh, my God. Otto, you don't listen to the show, obviously. No, I listen a lot. I just never caught the ice Spaz. Hey, how are you? How you doing? You're a star. Take your hand out of your pocket. Stop playing with your baby brother over there. Are you reaching or scratching? The guy walks in here holding his testicles. Testicles? Well, he came to us with an idea yesterday. He wants to film a porno. Really? Yeah, like an Opium Anthony porno. Sex with these two guys? No, no. Just have girls in here just going at it and have Opium Anthony direct? Brain surgeon. That's your plan, huh? Yeah. You should move to LA. It's easy to spell. What are you going to call the porno? Tell us about your career, slugger. I haven't come up with a name yet. No? No. Are you going to star in it? No, just produce it. He's going to be like the foreign director. He's going to be the producer. The foreign producer, great. You don't want to be on camera. I heard you hum like a wild field mouse. The doctor looked at his penis and said, is it an Indy or an Audi? That was good. You said penis. Very good. And George, that's Rick who produces our radio show. Rick, I know. He's a good guy. Reliable, friendly, gay. I'm just kidding. He's not reliable. Tom, what's going on? Hey, what's up guys? We're hanging out with Otto and George today. I saw Otto and George on Check It Out in Rockman County. Yeah? Public Access, the funniest show I've ever seen in my life. The telecrappies? Oh, thanks. Remember that? Yes, I do. I live about five minutes from Slotsburg. Oh, you do, huh? And my best friend, Liz, there. Your spaz has moved to Slotsburg. Oh, that's great. Yeah, we've been trying to find him. The P-Stop on your way to upstate Slotsburg. All right, Tom, thank you. All right. Otto and George playing today at Rascals Ocean Township, 8 o'clock show. It's going to sell out, so I would call immediately to get tickets. George, this is one of the sales guys that sells the radio show. How are you there, young fella? Not too bad. All right. What do you say to a guy in a tie? I know. You get all nervous when you sell the tie, George. Let's get some whores. What do you say, pal? You're buying. Get the cold card. All right. All right. So you sell what? Commercial tie? Yes. Really? Oh, this guy could put a cup of coffee to sleep. Yes, I know. All right. He's nice to the man. Yeah. He gets a lot of money for our show. Really? That's good. Yeah, yeah. Cash, pal. Yeah. All right. Come out of here. All right. There he goes. He's chasing everybody out of the studio. Get busy, mushy, pushy. Get out of here. Get your little tie on, your little mustache. You doodstead. Get out of here. All right. Oh, my God. Now you're brave when he left the studio. He's that guy. What did he do? Oh, man. He sat down left. What's the corp button do? Just makes a corp sound? No. It cuts off the mic, so if you have to cough, professional broadcasters don't want to go like, and today in the news, cough, cough. Really? Yeah. You take X-Lax. You'll be too scared to cough. All right. See? That's pretty good. Yeah. It comes in handy. We never use a corp button. Well, listen. We've got to take a break. I know George hang with us for a little while here. Wow stickers. Yeah, wow stickers. You've got to call Rascals. Ocean Township, one show tonight, 8 o'clock. It's going to sell out. Big, big show. Chips Cooney. Chips Cooney and Gorilla Boy. Gorilla Boy. Gorilla Boy. We know him as Jeff Norris on this radio. Jeff Norris. A Gorilla Boy will be opening up for Otto and George tonight. The phone number is 732-517-0002. All right. Okay, that's easy. Yeah, sure it is. Just look up Rascals, get the tickets. Ocean Township, more with Otto and George in just a bit. Stay there. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. What's up? The Who the hell is he? Yeah, she's hot though. Swearing on those little shirts, showing her brand new boobs. If all hookers look like that nobody would ever get married. You know what I'm saying? Right? All hookers. George, you get anything that looks like that or what? In your dreams! Well, we've got just a sick story that has been brought to our attention, Anthony. Wow, it's just something you never hear about. A 15-year-old learning disabled boy found locked in a bathroom stall by the child's father after he didn't return from the bathroom. They were at some men's room at Taube Beach in Massapequa. And guess who was in there with him, locked in there with him? A 69-year-old retired priest. Isn't that great? A 15-year-old learning disabled boy. And then his father, you know, he went to the bathroom, he hadn't come back for a while. So he goes to the bathroom to check. And he's locked in there with Andrew Miller, a 69-year-old former priest, retired priest, who has been charged with sodomy. Yeah. You've got to love the sodomy. Rush this drool over to forensics right away. Ah. Look, the Catholic Church denies these guys sex. They can't get married. You can't blame them, you know, dying a retard once in a while. George can't say that. It's not his fault. It's not his fault. It's a basic human need. Why do they always pick boys? That's a good question. That's it. I don't know. They might be a little fun to you. You're kind of a little guy. I don't know. It's kind of hard to hang out in a ladies' room for two hours waiting for a retard to walk in. George, you're out of control today. You obviously didn't get to sleep last night. Yeah, he makes perfect sense. My eyes are tired. I thought you'd be a little more sensitive about this story. Oh, yeah. I'm going to laugh a minute. Bring him in the bathroom. I'm amazed the father didn't kill the guy. Yeah. I've been walking in and you see some 69-year-old priest over here. Your son? Yeah. For real. Slamming the back door or whatever he was doing. I don't know. He might have been getting a hummer or giving a hummer. Right. They ought to be more specific as to what form of sodomy people are getting in these news articles. I don't need to know. You don't want to know? No. You want to know. Why would I want to know? Because either the priest was going south on the little retarded child or he had the little retarded child receiving his form of communion or he was slamming the back door or he had the little retarded child slamming the back door of the priest. So there's a lot of options there and I don't think they're that clear as to what was happening in the stall. Ask George. He might know. That's a busy bathroom. I had no idea what he was doing to the little retarded child. What do I care? Jesus. And the priest? Dr. Zachary Smith. Young William O'Gear. Young William. Dr. Smith, remove your penis from that boy. Spare me the poisonous box. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. I'm going to get a little angry. That's poisonous, Bob, you buttheaded booby. That's wrong. Yeah, that is. Certainly is. You can't, like you said, you can't blame the Catholic priest. You can't blame them because they are kept from having any kind of sex. It's a basic human drive. Right. You need it. Let's go to the phones and talk to Dylan. Dylan, what's going on? We've got Otto and George in the studio today. How does it feel? Hey. Hello. You're on the air, man. Hi, my name is Joe. Dylan. Oh, all right. Whatever. I wanted to know what Otto thought of that guy as the other controller, Christina. Right. He's excellent. I mean, it's a G-rated show, but you know, it's an excellent show, one you can bring your parents to. He's really good. Nothing bad to say. Boring. Yeah. Well, he's my peer. I got to know him. No, that's all right. We'll save. We'll save for you. Yeah. All right, Dylan. We'll save. That's what we're calling it because it says it on the screen. Let's go to John. John, you're next. Hey, John. Hello. Hey, buddy. Whatever your name is. Is this... Harry? Harry. It says John. Yeah, it's Harry Beaver. And Sonomy is getting it in the back door. No, not necessarily. Why not? Because oral is considered Sonomy. Anything that's not... In what state? In the whole country, I believe it's considered Sonomy. Sonomy. Yeah. It's not... If it's not intercourse, it's Sonomy. That's right. Anything outside of straight intercourse is Sonomy. Yeah. What, even like mutual masturbation? If you're jacking it? Yeah. Is that like Sonomy? I don't know. I don't know. But, no, everybody assumes it's back door action. I don't know. Every time I hear the spares in the back door, he calls it Sonomy. I don't know. All right, buddy. Thank you. All right. All right, man. Hey, George, you have any thoughts on the mayor? Yeah. He's got a little honey on the side now. Yeah. He's sick, right? Yeah. He's got the prostate cancer. Well, you know, he's a tight ass. He won't let you smoke a joint in the park anymore. Him and the commissioner are both sick because they're sick anal-repentant boos bags. The two of them. So they deserve this cancer? Yeah. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve it. They deserve this cancer? Yes. Yeah. Oh my God. Wow, George. I saw a Mr. Softy guy outside selling Viagra. Did you get that? Yeah, we got that. Jason, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? What's the name of this puppet again? George. Yeah, I got a question for him. Okay. All right. I want to know if it's like you're the expert on starvation. You have a hand up your ass 24-7. That was good. You got the puppet, Jason. All right. All right, bye. Just dump the block of wood. Steve, what's up? Oh, and hey. Hey. Yes, I'd like to speak to George. I have a question. Yes, sir. Hey, George, what do you think of female puppets like Lamp Chop? What would you do with her? Put her on a gyro. A gyro? That big wad of meat that spins around to slice it off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys know how long I've been... Oh, you're hurting me and you're hurting me. Stop it, Sherry. Sherry's dead. Now the sock is laid, man. What are we going to say, Otto? Or was it George? Do you have any idea how moronic your listeners are? Have you ever seen the people that listen to the show? Yeah, a lot of them came to the last show, right? Oh, man. Yeah. They're our listeners. We love them. Truthless, drunken, white trash. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Oh, and I know. Come on, they're all our pals. They supported you. They went out and saw you, George. Yes. Yes, they did. And they might be there tonight at Rascals. Every drunken one of them. 8 o'clock, so... I think Otto, it's radio, but he still works the mouth of the public. Well, you guys are just grown-up children. I've got to create the illusion for you, you know? Of course you do. It would suck if the puppet wasn't moving his mouth. Well, we're pathetic too, because we're just staring at George. We're not looking at Otto. Last time we tried to give him a microphone, the puppet. He was real. The priest is a retired priest, Anthony. He could have gotten some gas if he wanted, but... I don't know. I think even if you're retired, you can't just start getting laid if you're a priest. Did he lock the kids' wheels? I wouldn't say he was in a wheelchair. I think he was learning disabled. It could be anything. It could be totally normal, aside from maybe dyslexia, if he's learning disabled. Let's say the priest was banging a profoundly retarded mongoloid. For the love of God. Is that the proper term? Mongoloid? I think that's like the 50s term. Like when they were calling black people colored. You know, the mongoloid child. Down syndrome. That's it. That's it. GAYMORE RULES! ONA RULES! STAS RULES! JULIETTI RULES! I'm still convinced he got that because he doesn't use the prostate enough. You know, he wasn't getting laid. From his wife, anyway, I guess. I think those girls that he's seen with are just friends. You know? Why not? I think if he was getting some, the prostate gets a workout. And it keeps things moving. Keeps the fluid through the pump. He's banging. You think? He's banging. Without a doubt. Big light bulb head between some thighs. That's right, honey. You're getting some mayor right now. I'm the mayor of New York. Suck it. Suck it. See that? That's a pretty bad word. He's sitting down on the big beluga whale forehead sonar echo thing that he has on his head. Goddamn. Who's getting it from the mayor? Even the mayor needs some loving, Anthony. That's right, you bitch. I closed down the strip clubs. You dance for me, you twat. I asked Stas how far he went with his girlfriend before he got married. He said, to Kitsy, New York. Well, Spaz is living in sin, George. He's not married yet. Oh, he's not? No. Oh, there goes that joke. He's still funny, huh? There's a young girl upstairs, George, that wants to wow you. Oh, really? Yeah. Not you, Otto. She wants to wow the puppet, George. Really? Yeah. What does she look like? We'll soon find out. She coming down? Yeah. If she's ugly, George, don't be kind, okay? Okay. Well, first wait for her to wow and then rip it. Let's see. All right. We always got to see it first. All right. She's walking down the hall. She looks like she could be 15. Oh, wow. She's pretty hot. There we go. Did you check her ID, though? Hello, darling. Here, grab that mic. Here, man. Grab that mic. What's your name? Julie. Hi, Julie. I'm Opie. That's Anthony. That's Otto. And the puppet is George. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. And how old are you? 21. 21? Did we check for your ID? No, you look 21, right, George? She's nice. Would you like a cocktail? Yeah. Oh, you just like cruising by and figured you'd stop by and give a wow to the puppet. You are 21. I could see through your little tank top there that your nips are nice and high. Yeah. Are those all natural? They are. Wow. How about that? Look at those chugs. I think she's a honey. And what do you do for a living? I go to nursing school. You do? Well, George wants to do some nursing. Some nursing, yeah. Wow. What do they do? Like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're They send you to nursing school. Is the final exam just eating a whole bunch and hitting your head with a hammer so you're big, fat and ugly once you're a nurse? Because I've never seen a nurse who looked like you. I need an enema. I need an enema. I would get sick tomorrow if you were going to be my nurse. George, you're just stunned. Yeah, she's gorgeous. Yeah? You want to see a little something there, George? You strip? Strip? Yeah, strip. You're not a nurse yet, honey. George, calm down, man. She's going to run away. You're going to be nice to the ladies when they come in here. Are you going to put the bedpans in the freezer? I like how they just shake when she laughs, huh? Yeah, this could be very nice. Wow. All right. Yeah, let's check them out. You got to wow the puppet. Goddamnit! Wait a minute. Wow radio! Wait, hold the phone. Those are real? Those are real? Stop it. You got to be kidding. Those are all natural. Wow. Wow. Those could possibly be, let me say, the most amazing natural boobs ever. They look like they should be fake, but in a good real way. Because the nips are like high and stuff, right? George? No, they're high in a good way. Who's that, your boyfriend? Why do you girls always bring your boyfriend? Oh, that just did it. Even Otto's disappointed. He's got to be a real fan of the show, huh? If I was dating you, I'd strangle you in the parking lot. Who are my tits? All right, Neil, come on in here. Yeah, oh, the salesman. Wait, get in here. All of a sudden there's 60 guys in here. These guys never come down unless we have nudity in the studio. Neil? Insult me. That's George the puppet. That's Neil. He also sells for the radio show. Hey, Neil, how are you? Doing great. You? Not too bad. He doesn't want to look at you. A lot of water. I don't even know if that's Navy Air, but that was fun. All right. Neil, would you like to see her boobs? Well, I'll see them in the neighborhood. Yeah. What else are you doing down here? Getting a cup of coffee? Get another. I love her. George, when we have women in the studio, all the sales guys line up for coffee outside the studio. Yeah, I noticed that. All of a sudden they're thirsty. All right. Can you show Neil? Look at that. Wow. That's unbelievable. I love the seat. I didn't get in here like that. I love the seat through bra too, man. Let's talk to the boyfriend. What's your boyfriend's name? Who cares? Well, I'm sure George is going to have something to say. Can you bring him in here? Are you crazy, man? I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Can you bring him in here? Are you crazy, man, to bring her in here? That's the only way I can get up. Really? What's your name? Rodney. How long have you two been going out? Two years. Two years, huh? I wonder when she was 18. We're going to share the wealth. Man, that's nice. Pretty impressive, huh? Yes, without a doubt. Did you say hi to Otto and George? George is the puppet over there. What do you guys hope to accomplish by this move? Jesus Christ, what was that? That's it? Okay. You took the train in? Yeah, we took the train. Wow. All right. Let me tell you. Wow, that's something. Yeah, could you leave so she could show us again? Absolutely. He goes, absolutely. George, you like our job, don't you? What a sick fan. That guy's got problems. Isn't that something? Jesus. The fans of the show, they bring their ladies by to flash us. Isn't that nice? They're going to be happy. They're going to be happy. They're going to be happy. They're going to be happy. They're going to be happy. They're going to be happy. They're going to be happy. Yeah, man, I mean, I'm a fan of the honeymooners, so I'm not going to have my grandmother... I hope that made the radio. Oh my God. That's very funny. So, George, you don't have many girls flashing you when you're doing your act with this deadweight auto? Never. No? Never. Never. Sucks golfing a radio through nothing to get naked women. I get a kill on stage every night. I get nothing. I get Angelo calling me. Angelo's on the phone. Man, she wears something else like... What kind of pants are you wearing there? Just some kind of... Yeah, what's under that? Nothing else. I'm not going to flash the knish. She's waiting for the ratings to go higher. Take out the... All right. I want to see the knish. You want to see the knish, huh? She wears the boobs very well on the... she's got a very slender body. What size are those, by the way? They're R-D. They are R-D. 34-D. All right. Well, let's see them again. Look at those. Now just put the bra down. The see-through bra. Get a picture of the see-through bra, too. Wow. That's even harder with the see-through bra like that. That's something. She looks like a dark haired Britney Spears. Look at Rick trying to make some moves. Rick, shut up. Rick's trying to make moves. Her boyfriend's right there, five feet away from you. Go home and watch a wedding video, Rick. Wow. Man, boobs always bring this show to a halt. Oh, screeching halts, man. Screeching halts. Absolutely, but who cares? Yeah, who cares is right. Well, we want to thank you for coming by. That could be the nicest set we've seen up here. Very nice. If any other ladies are in the area and they want to try to beat what we just saw, come on by. I don't think it's going to happen. Look, everyone's shaking their head. George, any final words for the lovely lady? Next time, can you see the Kinesh? Is there any chance he'll avoid them putting his testicles on the console? I'm getting the louse stick in. Hey, is there any way we could play Guess What's in My Pants? Can we do that? Ask the boyfriend. Why, she can't make up her mind for a second. Oh, I think he's saying no. He's saying no. Oh, look at him. Go back to Fairfield. Is he saying yes or no? It's up to her. You ever hear of that game? It's better with the microphone. It's hilarious with the microphone. They're converging like vampires over here. It's just anything else, anything to prolong it. It's like the seagulls at the beach when you throw a piece of bread down here. A naked woman shows up and then guys come from all directions. Something tells me she's trimmed down pretty good. That's what I would guess. Do it! Do it! What, are you going to sit in Fairfield for the rest of your life and watch the lawn? We have some lovely prizes. Wow stickers. That's okay. We don't want to force it. Well, then can we just ask what are you sporting? I would say just by looking at her, wood floor. I'm going to go with Hitler mustache. George? What do you think, George? What are you sporting? Wood floor, I'm hoping. Mr. Wood floor? I'm sorry. Angela, you came on the wrong day, pal. Opie and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. In the studio, I'm going to enjoy this for just a couple minutes. I've got to catch them. I didn't mean to laugh. He's driving faster. I take the train. I've given up on the car. Do you want to take him on the bus with you just like that? No, he's in a bag. He's in a bag. Yeah, I would say that would kind of get a pension. Definitely. The bus, what a load of material. I went to Los Angeles by Greyhound when I was 15 to street perform. That almost killed me. Four days in a bar. I took a Greyhound from LA to New York when I was 15. Yeah, it killed you that ride. There was a Greek ouzo bun in the back just drinking the whole time. There were two prostitutes that were going from LA to Chicago to hook up with the new pimps. There were three of my brothers who got arrested when we got into New York because they thought we were runaways. My brother had a suitcase full of tie sticks that he brought with him from California. We had to give that bag to this girl we met on the bus while we went and got arrested. They went to search the bag and find tie. What a cluster that was. We were telling the guy at the cop, okay, look, my mother's supposed to pick us up and run on the railroad. Please, when you call her up, say the first thing out of your mouth, your kids are fine, they're here with me. Do you have son's name blah blah blah? He doesn't. Hello, New York Police Department. Do you have two children? Did you have two children? My mother's having a heart attack on the other end. They really got treated with the utmost act. They made a place for people on the bus. Unbelievable. Bus terminals are always in the worst part of county. The crummiest section of New York. You can't stop over, your head falls asleep on the friggin side of the chair. It was like 50 bucks anywhere in America. I'm going to LA and I'm going to the GON show and I'm going to street perform. I didn't get on the GON show and the guy who went to LA got arrested immediately for soliciting downtown, passing a half an hour permit. I had $50 taped to George's ass and I think I had like 200 bucks emergency money taped to the puppet's ass and bailed him out of jail and came back to New York. That was your LO experience? A horrible failure of a trip. Four days, yeah. Four days in a bus, my tailbone hurt, my knees hurt. They had the whole plan where you could get off the bus at any time and then get back on the bus if you wanted another bus that was coming by without having to pay any extra. But like you said, the bus stops were all in the worst parts of county. We didn't want to get off the bus for anything. And now to even get food. To break the fear for your life. Go Greyhound. Go Greyhound. I had a problem with that. That was many years ago. Leave the tie stick with us. I guess we've got to get you guys out of here. Yeah, I don't, George. Thank you, New York. One of our faves, I'm telling you. Absolutely. You guys were whacking nuts off your yam bags off tonight. I was a little low-cheap today, huh? A little low-cheap. That's okay, save it for the show. I'll save it for the show. Okay, you are. I'll see all you scumbags tonight. George, you can say scumbag. Thank you, scumbags tonight. This is a big push right here to try to get people in the seats tonight at Rascals Ocean Tonight, folks. Come on down. George, say something nice. Maybe the people will want to come see you. Tracy Esposito, Rob Falcone, go f' yourself. Are you going to get some sleep before the show tonight, George? My eyes are tired. I want a cheeseburger and some Clavo. That makes no sense. I was going to come by the meeting. It doesn't matter when the bumper says it. It's funny. Wow. Cool. Catching my eye tonight. Tonight, Rascals Ocean Town. Thank you so much, guys. 8 o'clock show. Thank you for going fast. Syndication, when is it? Syndication summer? The next millennium. I got a call from a radio station today in Seattle. You want to pick up your show immediately tomorrow. I just start laughing into the phone. Like that's going to happen. Yeah, it's going to happen anytime soon. We'll just stay here in New York for a while. Thank God we're in New York. Imagine if you want to be syndicated. You're broadcasting out of Omaha, Nebraska and they won't let you. This is the greatest city in the world. You guys are on top of the hill now. Yeah, but like AIDS, we want to infiltrate other cities. We want to spread this filth everywhere. It's a disease. We want to spread the Otto and George filth. What fun is a disease when it's all contained? It's true. It's like killing people when they're all over the place. It's true. They're wowing on Channel 2 right now. Anyway, well guys, thank you so much. Otto and George, tonight, rascals, ocean township. Thank you. Actually, it's 8.30. We're going to get the girls to flash it, George. Really? Yeah. Can you do what? Thank you. Thank you everybody. Here we go, Otto and George. You guys are like a black eye for old man kind. I don't think they're very nice people. The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on Carol and... O, B, and S. You know, I mean like one for all of us. This is Otto. This is George with Otto and George and you're listening to ONA on NEW. Suck my ***, you losers. We're in the middle of the spots, but we're getting some bad news. What now? Well, the picture floating around of you and I naked. What? All the papers are calling for a copy. We're going to have some explaining for daily. No one's going to believe us. That's what's going to suck. Why? Well, I guess David Hinckley had something about it today in the daily news. Does someone have a copy of that real fast? I know we're in the middle of commercials. That's why you can't tune out ever. We jump back into the show sometimes when we have to. I thought we were going to get away with this, Ann, but it's going to be ugly. Hinckley's radio column today, it's real fast at the bottom of this column. It says, WNAW's Opie and Anthony are naked this week in the trade magazine FMQB. Most terrifying radio site since Dr. Dre and Ed Lover naked on Hot 97 billboards from years ago. Ann and I are with a cover story for this trade magazine called Friday Morning Gossip. We're not talking about it because the average listener cannot get a copy of it. It goes down to all the radio stations, record companies and whatnot. It goes all over the country. Every single radio station in America gets it. All the record companies get it. Anyone in entertainment gets it. Ann and I have improved the site. What the hell? We'll give them the picture that is supposed to be our next album cover. Cringe. The cover shot from Cringe. Remember the controversy of that one? So we gave it to them and they decided to put it on the cover. It's a cover shot, Ann. It certainly is. The papers are calling like crazy. I think this chance thing is going to be the paper for everyone to see. Oh no. Not good. Just have an open mind when you see the picture whenever it appears. We'll explain exactly what we did. It does look really bad. My eyes are naked next to each other. No, no, no. I have a little trick to talk about. I can prove it. We'll let the people see the picture. You'll abuse us for at least an hour or two. Then we'll try to explain ourselves. Right, Anthony? That worked so well. It's supposed to be the cover to Cringe. The cover on the CD that never came out, Cringe, that we're hoping to get out eventually. Yeah. I'm surprised that David Hinckley and John Minnelli from the Post have picked up on it. Now they're all fighting for it to put it in the paper. Oh, great. This is going to suck. That's good. That's good. Ouch. Always, always just a little too far, I think. All right, Anthony. So that's something we have to look forward to. Probably tomorrow or the next day. Yeah, we'll see, I'm sure. Oh, right. Oh, no. Oh, no. That's not good. The abuse was very bad. Matt's saying we should just confess. No, we can prove a lot of things about the picture. Let's just put it that way. Hey, how are you doing? Don't be an ass. Look at the picture and then you can call us and abuse us. I just want you to give me the opportunity to come clean on the radio. Just do it. Come on, come clean, guys. What's going on? No. I just want to be the first one to bust on you, that's all. See, at the time, when we were looking to put a good CD out, we decided to get really outrageous with our cover. And, yeah, well, I don't know. It's out of... I know. I know you guys will come to it in your manhood. Sure. Thank you, Matt. We decided to send this picture like, what the hell, let's just send a mess. We thought it would be like a one inch by one inch photograph in the middle of the article they wrote on us. It would almost be like, what was that? Oh, okay, no big deal. It's on the cover. It's a cover shot. It's as big as today. It's quite frightening. It is quite frightening. My heart stopped when Rick told me that the papers were pulling like crazy. They're all trying to get the picture. All right, anyway, Anthony, EarthLink, 1-800-EarthLink. EarthLink provides you with fast, reliable internet connections. Isn't that right? Sure. What else, though? I'm sweating. They have free customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, toll free. They got the new 5.0 software, which is now even easier to use. That's very important. They're an award-winning service, Anthony. They're winning all sorts of awards. They take pride in what they do. They're just a great internet company, simple as that. And if you call EarthLink right now, 1-800-EarthLink, that's 1-800-EarthLink, and sign up, they're going to give you the first 30 days of service for free. That's right, 30 days of service for free. If you give EarthLink your call, 1-800-EarthLink. Tell Loken Anthony to send you, right? Yeah, 1-800-EarthLink. Don't go to CNN for dick jokes. Don't come here for the news. We hate to be lonely in Anthony's show. I like it when you show me George. 1-800-EarthLink, 7-9. What would you rate it at W? Ah, Otto and George made it in one of our promos there, Anthony. Oh, yeah. We love Otto and George. He'll be at Raskin tonight, Ocean Township, 8-30, one show. I'm telling you, you'll love it. I'm telling you, you'll laugh your yam bag off. Yam bag. All right, we're just getting pounded. You guys, hey. One of Anthony's most famous lines... What? ...is this. Explaining stuff on this show never works. Yeah. It never works. We should just keep our mouths shut. Bart from Jersey. Ah, nice picture, fellas. We gotta get John Minnelli on the phone to see if he's gonna print this damn thing in the post. Yeah. If he does, we're screwed. We were trying to explain ourselves a couple minutes ago, and, uh... I don't know. Oh, look at this, see? It didn't work. What? ONA gate, horrific. Backstreet Boys of radio. Ah. When you guys are naked together, you're supposed to be the cover of the CD, and that's what Anthony called Opie Wendy. All right, it's true. There's a picture out there that looks like Aunt and I are naked, yes. It was supposed to be the cover of our CD, Cringe. Cringe, because you would cringe looking at it. Yes, because we're naked, we're crouched, we're in a subway, we're next to each other, yes. Almost in a fetal position against a wall. It's a very disturbing photo. Very dark, very grim. Horrible. We know that we want it to be on our CD. Yeah. But now it's the cover of a trade magazine called Friday Morning Quarterback this week. OK, terrific. And I guess these magazines go to all the newspapers, Anthony, because they're all calling and trying to get permission to print the damn picture in the paper. And we gave them the picture because we're like, yeah, whatever, this is what our CD's going to look like, here's the cover. Because they did a whole article on us, it was like four or five pages long. We didn't really talk about it on the radio, because you guys can't get it, it's more for all the radio stations out there across the country and the record companies and media outlets. But now it looks like everyone's going to get to see it real soon, Anthony. Great. Just great. So, I mean, we're giving them pictures of everything, the road shows and some of our guests and this and that. We're like, oh yeah, and here's a picture of what our CD cover's going to look like if we ever put out French. I don't care, if you can't look at that picture and figure it out, you're F'd. They decided to make it the cover of the magazine. Paul from Whitestone, Queens. Is Anthony going to use the same trick photography so he and Jay Moore can do a Rockaway Petty commercial? Funny. Anthony, what's going on? Well, OP, we're hanging out during the show. Oh, no. Why? Anthony, hold on. What's up? Is this Siegfried or Roy? Who's with the White Tigers on the cover? Have your fun. We'll get you bastards back tomorrow. Hey, are we going to get to be able to play what? Guess what's in you guys' pants when you're on the cover? Oh, boy. Thank you, Anthony. Have a good day, fellas. Thank you. Have your fun today, guys. We'll get you back tomorrow. Scott, what's going on? I'm curious. Can you guys picture a worst-case scenario for the two biggest homophobes on the planet and be having a deal with people calling you fags for the next week? I'm not homophobe. I'm not homophobe. Anybody comes in and tries to do you, you're wrong. That's all right. That's cool. Can I add one more thing? Under only what I learned today? Never ever take promo pictures unless you absolutely know it's going to be released on time. Yeah. If it was just the cover of our CD, the picture could be, you know, here's the picture from their CD. Yeah. But it's not. Now it's just like a picture of us that people use when they need a picture of Opie and Anthony Gray. Well, that's why I'm trying to get... We're trying to get Minnelli on the line from the Post because we're going to beg him. We're going to grobble. We're going to tell him, look, if you do print the picture on the Post, please say this is, you know, their CD cover. From the forthcoming CD. The grand change that will never ever be put out along with our syndication. I understand we've said a lot of nasty things about John Minnelli and David Henkeley and the rest of them, but we're begging. You better print the picture to say this is their CD cover, the cringe that should come out soon. Or eventually. Something like that. Mark, what's going on? Mark? Yeah. Just the proof you need for the show that the Rockaway Bedding Guy was mistaken. Anthony with J. Moore. Anthony with Opie. Oh, Jesus. Hey, I knew this. Uncle John, what's going on? Hey, how you doing, guys? Hey, I just wanted to let you know as far as trying to explain the situation, you have a better chance to instruct my lightning. I don't think you guys just been waiting for me. I wish you guys luck, guys. I appreciate your help. Thank you, Uncle John. See you guys. Andrew! Hey, what's up? Listen, first thing, I just got to say how much fast is an A-hole. And second thing is I already know what you two are thinking in that picture. That's that! Great, thank you. Anthony, from our favorite newspaper in the Tri-State area. New York Post. John. Hi, guys. How you doing? We're on your good side, right? Are we in a good relationship mode? I'd like to think so. I think so, too. Well, first of all, John, we want to praise you on that fine article you did on Ant and I about two weeks ago on the Post with our pictures and everything. Yeah, thanks. You're welcome. I had fun doing that. That was pretty good. That was a positive piece and it was nice that it didn't have a headline, you know, Dopey Duo, Dopey and Anthony, something like that, Opie and Dopey, Dopey and Ain't Funny, you know. Very good. I appreciate it. I think I'll write the headlines. And then I know, I think, Anthony, you posted something that I should at least know what they are, but I don't even go into the paper. I work out of my apartment, so I have no idea what's happening until it hits my doorstep. Yeah, all right. You got wind of a picture of Ant and I naked? Well, I heard FMQB did something and they'd asked me if I could get the pictures from the Post and I said, well, the Post doesn't like to do that. Oh, yeah, because we were going to send the pictures you guys took for that article. Oh, and I wish I, you know, but I would have given them to them, but the Post, you know, doesn't do that. So, yeah, I called them today because I want to read it, so they're sending me a copy. Normally I don't see it. What's more incriminating, the prostitute Frank Gifford photos from that hotel room or the Opie and Anthony naked pictures? Well, I haven't seen the Opie and Anthony. I mean, are you guys actually completely full-bore bare? Well, you're lying. It's curled up in the fetal position, but if you look down at the package area, there's some floppage there. You can see some junk. There's junk hanging out. Pretty rude. It was supposed to be the CD cover. Yes. For Cringe, the CD that... The CD that they won't let you release. Right. Fantastic CD. Right. But, yeah, so we gave it to them. We thought they were just going to use it inside and passing, and it ends up on the cover. So we're a little embarrassed about that. But then we heard from one of the guys over at FMQB that somebody over at the post was inquiring as to where they could get the photos. And we thought maybe if it's going to end up in the post, we might have to do a preemptive little call with you. This isn't working. No, I didn't know that somebody had asked. Normally I would know that because nobody does radio, but me. There's a bunch of media outlets calling us for that picture right now. It might have been page 6. Oh, good. That's not good. You don't know who or when they called? No, I guess we could ask... We'll ask Rick. Yeah, and we'll ask what's his face is there. Jay from FMQB. Yeah, because he's fielding a bunch of calls. So what are the odds of that picture being in the paper there, John? Do you want it to be? Obviously they'll bleep the packages. Right, yeah. I don't see a problem with it. What is this going to cost us? We'll be nice to you. We won't trash you on the radio in the next few months. Oh, you want me to see what I can do about keeping it out? I don't know. I think it's good publicity. I don't see... The funny part is that everyone's been trying to get that damn picture. But when we were talking about the CD about six months ago... I'm in litigation. If a nude picture of me shows up in the paper with another man this could really, really affect my case. Oh, you mean over your split, eh? Over who? What? That. John, can we invite you into the next Lesbian Per Day segment? Sure. No, I was thinking about dropping by your show sometime, you know, one of these days just to kind of see how you do it. I'm really curious to watch you two in action. You know you're cordially invited. And I was actually going to do it before I did the profile on you but I just had so much and there was kind of a pressing need for it for that particular day so I just went ahead and did it. Right. It was a good job. We liked it. Yeah, we did like it. It was one of the most positive pieces we ever read about us. Actually, you know that now that it's out, I know the Daily News mentioned they'd seen it. So anybody could just grab... In fact, they could. They could just grab it and Xerox it or whatever they do. Yeah. Alright. Looking forward to opening up the paper over the morning coffee and seeing well our hairy asses. It'd be just great. Well, when you get the picture, give us a call and tell us what you think. Well, I hope the company stands by you guys. You know, I would have written this. Do you have a moment? Yeah, sure. I would have written this but there's only so much space. In the paper, I always want to write more than they print but you know that I think there's a little bit of a danger in your guys' case and that you won't necessarily be as protected as you develop as Stern was. Yeah. Because in Stern's day of growth he was all Melcharmerson had. By the way, I know that certain people aren't supposed to talk about certain people but I didn't get that memo. This is true. And so I think and I'm sure I will write about it as soon as it fits or it's appropriate that if you guys were ever out in the morning I think you guys are the only team I can think of that could give him a run for the money. Yeah, that's what I've heard. But now, Carmesan, I mean that. Carmesan is so big and the company is so big that even a Stern kind of person who's already established that way in the morning isn't worth going to the mat as much for as he would have once. So I just think that's kind of unfortunate for guys like you who are making your name in the world big time and fast while you're growing you're still a little more vulnerable now than I think anybody in the old days was. Well, John, I guess we can tell you this first, you're the first reporter that we're going to tell us. We've both been offered $100 million each for five years. Each, huh? Each, yeah. I'll take a tenth of that. But we'll be broadcasting, we have to broadcast from Venus and we have to get our own transportation. And John, thanks to you, syndication pushed back another three months. Well, to me that's really amazing. All I have to say is I love CBS. No offense to your company, but considering some of the shows that are up on the bird and the fact that you're not, it just boggles the mind. Yeah, it dumb-founds us too. But we're team players and we understand, right? Absolutely. But I'll tell you this, the minute that they flip the switch on you, sorry I almost said pull the plug. It's one or the other. You guys will be in virtually every town worth being in overnight. Yeah, we're like aides. Especially since your afternoon, you know, and all the other shows are fighting for morning. Well, we know there's someone out there that's ready to put us on. Strategy or laziness? What was it with Opie and Anthony in afternoon? See? All right, John, you're going to get us in trouble, so. Well, I don't want to do that. All right. Tell Alan, Sniff, and I've been flossing. And look, no cavity. I will tell him that. And I'll try to find out who wants that photo and what they're going to do with it. Okay, please. I'll call Rick back if I find that out. All right. Thanks, John. Thank you. Take it easy. I'm going to call Rick. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him. Chris from Jersey, guys, I admit that I won't find the picture gay as long as it's done in the Muganzo style. Yeah. I guess the picture's done in the Muganzo style. There's no real story to it. No, it's... This cover would be more offensive than the Blind Faith Little Naked Girl CD, or more offensive than the John and Yoko Naked Together in Bed photo. Let me tell you something about the Blind Faith Naked Girl CD cover. Yeah. That girl looks just like Spaz's girlfriend. That's a lot. Am I lying? Am I lying? Blind Faith, look at the Blind Faith. Let me see. No, I'm serious. If you guys want a picture what Spaz's girlfriend looks like... Naked. Well, all right, this girl is a little young on the cover. But the girl is like 14. All right, all right. So add like four years on to her. She'd be a little bigger. There'd be a little more maturity in there. That's what Spaz's girlfriend looks like, though. I mean, she's hotter than the girl on the Blind Faith cover, but that's pretty much it, right? Get Spaz in here. Because now you guys can look up the Blind Faith cover on the Internet and see what Spaz is like. Spaz, grab that mic really fast. Be honest. Have you ever seen the cover of Blind Faith's self-titled album? I haven't even heard of Blind Faith. It's a very old band. The Laker. Yeah, I mean, it was like a supergroup pretty much. Never heard of them. Be honest. Does the cover look like a young Erika? I need to look. Ready? It does, right? Don't lie to me. It does, right? If you add four years on to that girl, that's Erika, right? Could be Erika's younger sister. You know, everybody's just going to go out and buy the album now. They ain't going to buy it. They'll buy it. They only had one hit on it. And what was that? I can't find my way home. Yes. That's pretty fun. Yeah, when she was 12. Well, yeah, I mean, the girl in the cover is younger than Spaz's girlfriend. You get the idea anyway. She's a little nub. All right. Wow, we got a girl that wants to be evaluated for the Spaz.0 video. Oh, great. Didn't realize that that wasn't going to work? Yeah, we did. Anthony, we definitely have to tell you Anthony, we definitely have to take a break. Anthony, we definitely have to take a break. I got some homo. Homo with a cat voice. Oh, run. Gonzo radio. Morning. All your garbage should generate gas around the world. Let me touch my phone. Oh, yeah. It's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them. It's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them. I want to strip it. I want to run. Anthony, rock away better. They have over 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey, Anthony. You're saying all the branding practices. I don't need to name them all here, do I? Psyllable, prosperpete, externaz, and foster, Sinus, beauty rest. The price is up to $6.5 or $10. The store regular prices, you know. Okay. Rockaway betting, you know. They're paying good money for this. I know. Come on. I talk about rockaway betting all the time. I talk about rockaway betting. They gave me a bed, a huge king-sized bed. They delivered it upstairs, a thin, narrow little stairway, impossible passage. Yet their delivery men were kind and courteous and delivered the mattress, set up the free steel bed frame. It was great. And now I sleep soundly. They took away your old bed? You didn't have the old bed after. Someone else took away my bed. Wendy, rockaway Wendy. Took away my bed. Took away my old bedding. So you're a different case here. They didn't have to take an old bed away. No, no. Unlike rockaway Wendy, rockaway betting only takes your old bed, not everything else you own. It's great. We're talking about beds here still, right? Right. Okay, so. I know there was a time there where you were in between beds. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. What was I sleeping on? Oh, someone else's bed. It was like a futon. A futon. But it was a pain. It hurt. It wasn't comfortable. There was a thin little mattress on it. But rockaway betting, they ruled, delivered the mattress. You heard it from Anthony. Rockaway betting, they rule. It's not rockaway Wendy. No. Rockaway betting is more good. More gooder. If you need a bed, give rockaway betting a call, obviously. They make it easy. A lot of our sponsors make it easy for you guys. The number is 1-800-TRY-A-BED. That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED for rockaway betting. If Jay Moore, Anthony, and Spats can sleep on separate mattresses from rockaway betting, so should you. Spats now has a rockaway betting bed. Yes, he does, Anthony. He's an English kid. He loves rockaway betting. Give them a call, 1-800-TRY-A-BED.
