 Opie and Anthony. Come on, those guys are fast! 1027 WNEW. It's the O&A show! I don't know, I hope you got the phone number by now. 212-757-1027. Fax line if you're working, 212-957-963-9. Let's say hi to my buddy, my pal, Anthony. What's up? How are you? Just reading some instant feedback before we... What are they saying? Are they happy? I just started reading it, just got the computer online here. Okay. I'm in pain today. What's the matter? I got my teeth scraped today. Scraped? Clean? Nah, they used to call it a cleaning. It's just an all-out scraping now. When you were a kid, it was easy. They put that little rubber thing, they put some bubble gum flavored stuff on it, kinda went around your teeth. Okay, rinse. Now they use a big ice pick and jets of water that taste like salt water. And if you're like me and you only get your teeth cleaned every two years, there could be some problems in there. Were they pulling out smurfs? Boulders, man. So now they're holding off the exhaust floor. And then it hurts for a while. Yeah, it does hurt. Spitting out these big things, big globs. What's up, Ben? What's wrong? I was just coming down the hall to come down to the show. And I'm coming around the corner there by the printer and stuff. Sam from sales is sitting there reading something. I almost got taken down by spaz going about 120. He literally almost crashed into me. He was running so fast I was coming around the corner. He's open, he's a one-chute right now. I really know. It's funny. I love spaz though. You tell him to do something, the guy is right on top of it. He runs like a maniac. He runs like a maniac. He's stupid and all, but he works really hard. I just casually said, spaz, I need the one-chute for today. We put a one-chute of things we want to talk about and this and that together. And it wasn't in the studio, so I go, spaz, I need the one-chute. I'm like, oh my God, I need the one-chute. I was just like, yes, spaz, when you get a chance, get the one-chute. We're getting the show together here. And I guess he almost took you out, sprinting down the hall. Cool. I'm going to get the one-chute. You didn't go to New York Radio. You didn't go to New York Radio message boards. Alan Sniffin for your cleaning, did you? No, but if he's part of the after plan, I'll go to him. You should go there. That would be good. You could discuss radio as he scrapes your teeth. Please. No one's worse today. So I'm getting my teeth scraped like crazy. And the lady doing my teeth, she's watching Martha Stewart. I'm like, oh, can't you put porno on or something? Oh, yeah, at the dentist. Anything. Can't even get good music. No, but Martha Stewart. But it's between that and I guess Regis and Kathy Lee. Come on. Oh, well. Let's go back to Robert and put him on hold here. Hi, Robert. What's up? Hey, how are you? Good. What's up, Robert? I just got a quick story. First of all, I've been separated about 14 months. Anthony, it only gets worse, man. Cool. I had a quick story about my girlfriend. I was supposed to go see her and I was late. But she called me on the cell phone, the car, I was going upstate. She says, where are you? I said, well, I'm on my way. She said, I just got out of the shower. I'm lying here on the bed with just a towel on and nothing else. And I said, I'm on my way. I'm going. I'm going. I take off. I'm doing about 85 miles an hour. I get pulled over by a local gendarme. And he says, do you know how fast you were going? I said, yes, I know how fast I was going. I said, I'm going to see my girlfriend. He says, yeah, right. I've heard that. I said, no, no, really. She's lying on the bed. She's almost naked. She's waiting for me. And I say, listen, Carla, we'll find out. So I get on my cell phone. The car gets on the cell phone, talks to my girlfriend, hands it back to me and says, follow me. He gave you a police escort so you could get laid? To the exit. That was the greatest. Where were you? Like what town? I was actually just past Slosburg. Slosburg. Slosburg. He gave you a police escort to get you laid. He gave me an escort to the exit. Yeah. That is awesome. That's why we love the police. That's a cop that understands. Who's a cop? Your phone's breaking up, but thank God you got the story on the air, man. Yeah, thank you. That's a great story to start the show off with today. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Robert. Love you, guys. All right. We like you, too. Hey, yum. Another man buying his freedom, huh? Freedom. That's great, though. Cops have a sense of humor out there. They certainly do. They understand. Wade, what's going on? Hey, guys. I wonder if these new WoW stickers work. Yes, they do. I was reading a ton of email from people before the show that got WoW'd yesterday. Okay, well, here's the deal. It's like, I got this guy working for me. I'm older. I'm married. I get WoW'd when my wife is crunching in the bathroom, so I don't need to worry about it. But I got this guy working for me. 23 years old. His name's Ralph. Wants to get WoW'd. So we go out to Ranch 1. We get the stickers. He's driving around all day yesterday waiting to get WoW'd. He's listening to your show, hearing that there's girls wanting to find someone to WoW. Yeah. Can't we have a WoW dating game and send them to him? Because he's driving around wasting gas. That's what WoW's about. It's the randomness of it. Yeah, we'll be honest with you. That's the one problem with WoW. There's a lot of people with WoW stickers and a lot of girls that want to WoW. They just have to hook up on the high. Can't you guys publicize a centralized WoWing location and we can all go there? Well, you know what? Yesterday we didn't really focus on WoW because Barry Williams was here, Greg Brady. Yeah, I heard that. And we had like two and a half hours of fun with him. We want to thank him again for stopping by and getting our show and having fun with us. He understands the Opie and Anthony show. He was able to come in and participate. That's a good thing. And he didn't really mind the way you were picking on the Johnny Bravo. No, not at all. He's got a sense of humor about it. That's pretty cool. A lot of those people from Child Stars and stuff, a bunch of a-holes. They can't take a joke about themselves. Well, the deal is though, because we spent so much time on Barry Williams, we didn't We didn't focus on WoW yesterday because usually we'll have the girls call and say, Hi, I'm on the Jersey Turnpike at exit blah, blah. So we can narrow it down a little better than just randomly like it happened yesterday. All right, then the other suggestion would be how about we do a whip them out all week, a W-O-A-W. I don't know how you pronounce it. A lot of people confused. A long time ago we changed it to whip them out whenever. Oh, okay. But it's more or less on Wednesday we'll focus on it. We can't spend every day focusing on WoW because then it's going to get boring real fast. Yeah, you got a point there. All right, listen, syndication whenever. Take care. Thank you, Wade. Let's go to Frank. Frank, you're next on N-E-W. How are you? Hello? Hey, Frank. Hey, what's up, Ope? What's up? I got a quick question for Anthony. Yes. Did you watch Brady Bunch the night of the Nicky? What? Brady Bunch and the Nicky. Anthony? Brady Bunch? It was on Nickelodeon the night of the Nicky. Oh, no, I thought you meant the movie which is what, Sunday? I did watch the Brady Bunch a little bit because I was flipping around like crazy because the Knicks were driving me nuts last night. Oh, my God. I could not watch the Brady Bunch after listening to Barry Williams yesterday. Yeah, it's kind of funny now to turn it on. You just picture him banging Marsha or trying to bang his mom. Yeah, it was just a little too real or surreal I should say. A little frightening. He was funny yesterday. Yeah, he was a lot of fun because a lot of you guys said, oh, man, Barry Williams, Greg Brady coming into the show, this is going to suck. Yeah, what are we going to do? But a lot of you guys got turned around and said, man, that was some fun radio yesterday. Yeah, it was good. So, cool. All right, guys. What about the Knicks yesterday, bro? Oh, my God, they gave me a heart attack. Man, what's... Do you think they're going to win tonight? No. They lost, didn't they last night? Yeah, they did. Oh, they did. I see. I knew that. I got Patrick Ewing out there. I killed him. Boy, what a surprise. Ewing letting us down again. I think he shot 36% from the field last night. He's horrible. Thanks, Patrick. Nice brick at the end of the game from the foul line when it mattered. He has a deal like our old boss has. You can just keep effing up and not performing and not giving what is expected of you and you just linger. You're the missing link. All right. All right, guys. Take care. Thanks, Frank. Bye. Yeah, you can put that in there. Justin, what's going on? What's going on, guys? Yeah, I've got to ask you a question. Yeah. All right. I think I saw this Spanish girl on the show and she was telling you how she does favors for her boyfriend but he never makes any noise or something. So she was asking you guys what she does wrong, right? Yeah. And I think it was obvious on me. He's asking. He's like... No, it's Anthony. I know what you're going to say. What? It's Anthony's... Charles Bronson face. Oh, the Charles Bronson face. What is the Charles Bronson face? Driving me and my friends crazy. You ever see Charles Bronson in a movie? Yeah. He puts that face on where his lips are like pulled over his teeth. Yeah. So his lips are covering his teeth. Oh, so it's that. All right. And yeah. Yeah. I like working on giving like a gum job or something right there. Yeah. You just, you know, want to cover those teeth with your lips. It's the Charles Bronson face. All right. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. So we encourage the ladies to do the Charles Bronson face. One, two, get out. So I dig. I dig when they're going to give the hammer. Oh, yeah? So, yeah. Definitely. All right. Cool. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you. Bye. Can I just do an open phones here? We've got a lot of things to do today. Not much, man. How you guys doing? Great. I was at the Yankee game yesterday and I started to bring a wow sign. I was right down in front by the White Sox bench. Finally started to get some girls into it and I get them to basically wow me with just a broad first. So security comes over, threatening them, threatening me. And then finally I guess the girls got a little more rowdy, take the tops off. Then they're getting escorted out. I'm saying that basically I might be charged with inciting a riot, but they let me stay because I calm down. Then I got an Attica chant going and claiming that the Yankee Stadium was not located in the United States anymore. Basically by the end of it we were escorted out by the fine people of the NYPD for wowing. Brian, one question I got for you. Yeah? How many beers did you have last night? Oof. Yeah, lots. I mean, it was definitely alcohol induced. Did you have fun? Oh, it was a great time. Great time. And I just wanted to say sorry to the girls because I felt horrible for getting them to show us and then they get booted. Clemens looked good last night, huh? Beautiful, beautiful. I hate it. Right at the height, you know, the grand slam and then just basically chugging more beers because they wouldn't serve you. It's kind of odd. They don't serve you more beers until you finish the one you have. So if you have a half a beer and the guy passes by, you end up pounding that one to get to the next one. So they're making you drink more. It's their fault. All right, Brian. Thank you. Have a good night. Thank you. Can you get them back to basketball? I believe it was Houston that really killed them. Yeah. Well, I'm going to give Aaron a chance to abuse me because I said the wrong thing. Aaron. Aaron. I don't know anything. Yeah, Ewing did shoot better than 32%. You're right. Thank you. Sorry about that. No problem. I just got so pissed off. I just started babbling. It's all good. All right. I love you guys. Thanks. Bye bye. It still sucks. Everyone knows I'm not a huge Ewing supporter, so. True. Everyone does know that. You were seven for 12, huh? Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good shooting for the field. Actually Houston let us down last night, but. But you just like bashing Ewing. Yeah. I blame all the Knicks problems on Ewing. It's just easy that way. Wow. And you were like the mad dog there with the stats. That's right. I pull them up there. Well, I got an email. What do you think? I know that stuff. Offhand? I never understood how they did that. I'll be Ewing seven and 12 on the field at 16 points and 10 rebounds. I think it was Houston that disappointed the team and the fans. Andro. Andro. Hello, boys. Hey, man. I sent in an envelope to Earl. Yeah. He sent me like 30 stickers in like four days. Right. And I had them all out yesterday. You're like the sticker of the month club. He keeps sending them. I was on the road yesterday. It was like a friggin' sausage party. I did not get wild with all the stickers I have, man. Just have patience. Put it on your car and just go about your business. Hey, guys. Yeah. Calm a chameleon, baby, when you're playing that thing. I got that all queued up if you want it. Yeah. Please. All right, man. Thank you, Andro. Joe would like to blame Van Gundy. Joe. How you doing? All right. I would like to express about Van Gundy because he didn't put in Charlie Ward how he's been doing so great. My man, think I'm doing what about a jolly ward? Yeah, Ward's... I believe that one of the cup-top-donuts. Well, Ward's on fire. You got to keep him in there. Oh, yeah? Oh, my God. You got to. He's been doing so great, even on defense. I got a better question for you, though. When is Jeff Van Gundy going to get the rest of those hair plugs? He started the process about two or three seasons ago, and it's just kind of sitting there. It's like, dude. I got to do something with him, too. It's like, are you going to commit and go the distance and get the whole head filled up, or are you just going to leave it like you just went through chemo? Oh, no, I'm serious. It's been driving me nuts. Like, two seasons ago, he started getting the hair plugs, and he stopped. Did he run out of money or something? Maybe his job's in jeopardy. No, I don't think so. I think we got him for a few more years. A few more years? Well, then he better start playing Charlie Ward. All right. All right. Thank you, Joe. Thanks a lot. Bye. Amanda. Hey, what's up, guys? How are you? Good. I was just wondering, were you guys listening to Don and Mike at all yesterday? No. Because at about, I'd say about 7.30, they're pretty much whining about Ron and Fez and Scott and Sid getting an ad in one of the trades, and then they started whining about being chaste-alate in New York City. Well, you know, that's where they stay. And they were whining about how they have the greatest ratings, blah, blah, blah. You know, I'm not trying to turn it into you guys versus them or anything, but I just felt that they're so high on themselves, and them whining about you guys being in their slot isn't going to get them anywhere. No, they're broadcasting live from New York today and tomorrow, and the fact is, you know, we have better ratings than them, and it's the Opie and Anthony station. You know, they were saying, oh, we're number one in this market. They're doing great where they are. You know, but why should they bring their pompous attitudes on us? Like, I really don't care for it. Right. I don't know. They shouldn't be bashing everyone, though. We're trying to make a go of it here. It's a one big happy family. Oh, yeah, right. For now, it is. All right, syndication, whatever, guys. Thank you, Amanda. Bye. Bye. All right, everyone wants to talk about the next. Go to the fan. No, no. They lost. I'm frustrated. Yeah, I know. Houston never showed up last night. It is Ewing's fault. Someone is saying it's not the fan over here by Ewing a ring. He'll never win one. I know. I know. I'm sure the fans been talking about this for 15 hours straight. Go over there. I want to apologize to Patrick Ewing for any racist remarks I'm out of. Yeah, it's the new sensitive Don Imus. Yeah, that's what he's saying in the paper today. Yeah, yeah. So you won't hear any racist remarks from me. And shut up, Bernard. They'll be talking about the colored or nothing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And my fag cowboy hat. Whoa, whoa. My homosexual cowboy hat. Baby. I can't say fag, baby. The new sensitive. No, you can't. You can't. You can't go in the paper and say you're toning down the show and making it more sensitive and stuff. Toning down the show. Quaaludes. Tell your critics to, you know, go F themselves. Yes. And just continue doing your show. Absolutely. Anthony, let's take a break. All right. All right. We're just getting started here. See you in a little bit. I'm here. See the list of restaurants and the daily news and what's going on at some of these places? Yeah. We could talk about that. That's frightening. Every single one of them has vermin. What's vermin? Rats and mice and vermin. That's frightening. And some of the other things like and these are places people eat at. Hold on. Hold on. Let's take a quick break. Yeah, we'll come back I guess. Talk about that a little because that's scary and they're popular places. Yeah. I guess you could start. All right. We'll talk about it next. Stay there. Phone line 2127571027. No more Nick Talk for now. We'll be back. Stay there. Hey, this is Barry Williams. You're listening to OPV and Anthony. Hey, Anthony, I got news for you. I made out with Marcia. So bite me. OPV and Anthony. OPV and Anthony. OPV and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. Let's go to Laura real fast. Laura, what's going on today? Not much. Yesterday, I was in the bathroom. I was in the bathroom. I was in the bathroom. I was in the bathroom. I was in the bathroom. I was in the bathroom. Hi, my boyfriend and I, we work at a flower shop. I went into them. I followed them into the fridge and he said, you know, it's Whip It Out Wednesday, right? I said, yeah, I know. So I whipped it out for him. Nice. There were a lot of people there. I was a little worried about the danger, but I did it for you guys. Danger is all good. Danger is great. Danger adds to the excitement. Oh, it made me so excited. Not knowing if you're going to get caught or not, you know. It's really cold in that fridge. It's really cold in that fridge, too. You were nipping out? Yep. Well, Laura, thanks for helping us out with Whip It Out Wednesday. No problem. All right, man. Thanks. There she goes, Laura. It's happening, guys. I'm telling you. Yeah. Just get the wow on the car and wait to see what happens, OK? Yeah. Anthony, we got to talk about Fast Times. The Ridgeway and High real fast. Yeah, true. We're in the office. We didn't get to watch much of it, you know? Yeah. Because we had to start the radio show, but... We just checked out the scene. Yeah, we got to check it. Well, Spaz, he comes in with Fast Times and Ridgeway and High. We bring in movies all the time. And he waits to almost showtime to tell us he's got Fast Times at Ridgeway and High. Yeah. So we are able to, you know, cue up the scene, the greatest scene in movie history, before the radio show. Phoebe Cates. Moving in stereo, the cars. Coming out of the pool. Oh, man. Oh. On desert top. And it's just the best scene ever. Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Perfect. How many times do we see the scene before the show? Perfect scene. We just kept rewatching. That's all we watched. Yeah. It was amazing. Yeah. Oh, God. Fabulous. Yeah. Remember that? Mm-hmm. She dives in the pool. Slow motion comes up the ladder. Gives that little smile. Shakes the water out of her hair. Yeah. Climbs out of the pool. And there's the mist going off behind her. She's walking. And then she just opens up the top on her bikini, revealing those beautiful Phoebe Cates boobage. It's got stuck in my head right now. And then idiot Brad is whacking it in the bathroom. Oh, come on. Anyone knock? Wasn't anyone effing knock anymore? Yeah. Anyway, I don't know. We thought maybe we could do a little Fast Times of Ridgemont High trivia today real fast to give out some prizes. Yeah, we got some stuff to give away. We got like wrestling tickets. We have Warped Tour tickets and Open Anthony prize packages. We got to make it hard, though. What do you mean? You got to make the questions hard because everyone has seen the movie a million times. Well, the deal is they have to stump us with a trivia question from Fast Times of Ridgemont High. Yeah. They stump us, they get a prize. So it's up to how hard the questions are. Most people come up with the same questions. They're pretty easy. So if you wanted to try to stump us with Fast Times of Ridgemont High trivia, we'll do this real fast. 2127571027, Asia, what's going on? Hey guys, what's up? How are you? Good. Good. I just wanted to tell you, I was up in your old stomping ground yesterday in Boston. Yeah. And I never waved before and I saw a truck with a wow sticker on it. I was like, well, why the hell not? So I whipped them out. And how did it feel? It was a little hard, I didn't want to tell you. Very good. You got to do it down here in the New York area for everyone. I know, I have to. The problem is I drive too fast. It's a little hard for me to do it on a regular basis. Well, you've got to slow down every once in a while and flat those boobies for us. Did you see a wow sticker up there? Was it one of the ones from down here? Yeah, it was one of the new ones. I was surprised. I think he had a New York plate. It made sense. But I was like, hey, what are the chances of me seeing a New York license plate and a wow sticker in Boston? So I tried it. Hey, cool. Why the hell not, right? Nice. Well, thank you, Asia. Thank you very much. All right, there she goes. Another Lady Wow and it's happening. Yeah. Andy said you forgot something about that famous scene in Fast Times. What? Andy. Yeah, what's up, guys? Hey. Remember that you got, it's the best part of that whole awesome scene. When she's coming out of the water, she brushes her hair back. Oh, and she... And a little bit of water comes off of her lips. She opens her mouth. Everyone has examined that scene frame by frame. Everyone did exactly what he did in that scene. That was great. Hey, that's good, Andy. Later, guys. All right, bye. The water coming off her lips. We all remember the details. Yeah. All right, let's see if anyone could stump us with their Fast Times original and high trivia. OK. Let's start with Kevin. Kevin, what's going on? Yeah, how you doing all night? All right. I got a question for you. Yeah. Was Biscoli's father's occupation? Oh, that's easy. Come on. Dude, my father's a TV repairman. Oh, man. He's got an ultimate set of tools. The stickers. Oh, you're cursing on us, Kevin. All right, so I'm gonna think about it. You're waiting for the Wow stickers? Yeah. You sent the self-addressed stamped envelope? Two weeks ago. All right, man. Well, you'll get it. All right. We've been backed up a little bit. All right, dude. All right, man. All right. That was easy. You gotta get a little harder than that. Seth, what's going on? Not much. How are you? Great. All right. All right. What was spray-painted on the dugout when Jennifer Jason Leigh's having sex with the car stereo guy? All right. There's a few. Couple of things. I'll go with Disco Sucks. All right. No, right above her head was a surf Nazi. Yeah. Son of a gun. That's the one. All right. Thank you, Seth. All right. Take care. Bye. Let's go to Tony. Tony, what's going on? Hey, what's up, buddy? How you doing? All right, man. Who's the director of the movie? Oh, man. We didn't know that. Oh. What? We're just talking about things in the movie. Yeah. It's gotta be something in the movie, but we're trying to figure out who the director was. The director? There's some chick. Hold on. I can't remember her name, and I used to know this. It's kind of a weird name. Give me a hint. What? What do you want? You want a hint, or you want her name? Give me the first letter of her name. A. Yeah. Amy. Amy. First letter of her last name. Oh, man. Come on. It's not like... H. H. Amy Heckerle. What is it? Amy Heckerling. Heckerling. Yeah. With a G. You were right there. That's not an easy question. Yeah. No, that's not... We were trying to figure that out today. She did a couple other movies, too, but that was her first one. Yeah, that was a good one. All right, Tony. That was her first one. Thank you, Tony. All right. Bye. That's... We want questions about the actual movie. Movie. Nick, what's going on? There's a very famous actor that works in the restaurant with Brad that's like flipping burgers in the back or something. What was his name? Nicholas Cage. What was his name in the credits? In the credits? Yes. Stoner Budd. No, no. His real name. Oh, yeah. Did he do the Coppola at that point? Yes. Yeah, okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. Nick, what's going on? Nick, what's going on?

Oh, God damn it. All right. Good job, guys. Brad dropped her off at the bowling alley and then she ran across the street. Yeah. All right, man. Thanks a lot. Bye. All right. No one has stopped us yet. Chris, what's going on? What's up, Owen? Hey. How are you? I got a question for you. What was the woman's name that they kept delivering the pizza to? The woman's name that they kept delivering the pizza to? Yep. What movie are you talking about? You're not talking about Porky's, are you? No. Fast Time to Mr. Marhide. Yeah. What are you talking about? My nuts, nigger. Oh, see? What does that even mean? Did we just get pranked, I think? That was the sorriest attempt at a prank I've ever heard. Ever. Like, at least have a real quest. Did a guy just come off like a tool or what? Janet, what's going on? Hey, what's up? I love you guys. All right. When Brad gets a job at the Fish and Chips place, what does he have to say to the customers when he takes their order? At the Fish and Chips place? Yep. What does he have to say? At the Hook's Fish and Chips. Oh, God. What does he have to say as a waiter to them? That's a tough one. Rigged. I can't remember. I can't remember. Aye, aye, sir. What does he have to say? Actually, I don't know. Does that matter? Oh, God. Get out of here. That's why, you know something? I don't think that's a question because I don't think he has to say anything. He does. He does. I know he does. No, he's just got to wear the uniform. No, he does. Oh, get out of here. He does. I just can't think of what it is. Goodbye. We need the answer. What a douche. No one has stumped us yet. Rob, what's going on? What's up, Bowie? Hey, listen. What kind of tickets was Jefferson looking for from the mall that he didn't deliver? Earth, wind and fire. You guys are too good. Earth, wind and fire. And little brother. You guys are the best, man. Take care. All right. Let's go to Gary. Gary. Hey, how are you doing, guys? Good. I have two good questions, if you don't mind. All right. The first one is, what was Brad's boss's name at the fast food place, the hamburger place? Dennis. Very good. Dennis Taylor. Dennis Taylor, that's right. The second question is, what was the name of the fast food place? Dennis Taylor. Dennis Taylor, that's right. The second question is, what rock band had a cameo? Rock Chick? No, a band appeared in it. Was that at the prom at the end? If I tell you the scene, you'll probably get a guess. The two guys at the fish and chips place. Right. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, I can't remember the name of the band, though. Are they the English dudes with that one-hit wonder? No, very, very popular in the 80s. Hooters? No, I guess late 70s. They were considered like a new age, a new wave band. Yeah, like twins. I don't know. Yeah, who was it? It was Devo. That was Devo? Mother's Bar is in the credits. Read the credits. What? Everyone's shaking their heads. Dude, you're out of your mind. It was Devo. Read the credits. You were good friends with the director. I'll read the credits, but I'm taking it. Hold on.

do with this radio show on live TV you come down and hang with us that's the rules huh well yeah you made good he stole one sign and then put a sign on TV what could I tell you we're softies at heart yeah so everyone wants to know about Rick's car Anthony that seems to be the thing everyone's curious about we've been talking about it for quite a while this happened what three weeks ago yeah and Rick was in such a tizzy that we couldn't even discuss it but it seems things of the air is cleared a little bit and people want to I guess know what happened he destroyed a bathroom he destroyed an office he was so pissed off that he stormed off the show wouldn't even talk to anybody went to our office in the back just started throwing stuff went into the public bathroom here in the building tore a door off of the stall threw it out the bathroom door into the hallway he was so pissed because a this thing happened and B we talked about it on the air and he said don't talk about it on the air because I think someone's stalking me well there's a C too well there were pictures all over the official website yeah yeah pictures of the incident were all over the unofficial website well we could we could tell the story yeah if Rick wants in then you could come in here if not whatever three weeks ago no it goes back a month and a half two months ago well do we even have to do in that order hell yeah why not tell what happened and then discuss why it happened well no I cuz you got it you got to tell the story from the beginning okay Rick was part of a prank against at night mm-hmm he went against the show you went against the show that's not even that's not even an issue everyone knows except Rick Rick you went against the show you knew something you knew of a conspiracy against it and I and Anthony yep and instead of informing us you let it go which in my opinion is turning on us right not it's the famous Billy and Paul J more prank right where there was a fake fight and stuff and Rick knew about it Rick knew about a couple days before and it got so ugly that I punched someone in the face yeah because I thought it was still real I think it I didn't punch Paul because you know I was so pissed that they got us I punched him because I thought it was still real and he was coming after me yeah so Rick no didn't inform us so we could have turned it around on them some way shape or form okay all of us could have put our heads together yeah now let me let me give you a little background mm-hmm you remember back to the homeless shopping spree show yeah what was I getting railed on I don't buy Jen I can't no clue Jake comes on the air Rick said not to come down because you guys are doing the homeless shopping spree and blah blah blah and you guys you know we had a lot of stuff going on in the studio and what did you say don't ever listen to Rick just do what you want to do no no we were basically first of all that's a that's a whole different issue we worked we worked that whole thing out here's what leads up to my decision was you made a horrible decision with that because we're talking about Jay more a Hollywood star and and you know you want people like that on our show as much as possible and it came to our attention that he called the show a few times and you didn't put him through because you thought that we were too busy for Jay more a Hollywood star that gives us good radio no we worked that part out I did say to Jay don't listen to Rick you know do whatever you want right then I went back to you and I explained exactly how important it is that Jay gets on our show because he puts you know what's some good radio and regardless how does that explain how you didn't tell us about the prank well it quickly goes to the fact that how fast things will turn around against me if I decide something either against you or against Jay so Jay comes in and says oh well Rick the biz and then you guys jump on me for that we're gonna get mad at you for going against Jay on him pulling a prank on us here that doesn't no no no no no you're on some thin ice I sell Jay out then you guys can turn it around easily by going oh well that was a great prank why'd you do that? We would never do that you don't know us! How do I know? We would never ever do that dude stop it like we would say oh boy that was setting up to make us look like jerk-offs boy you should have let it keep going no we did we did brainstorm and figured a way out to totally turn it around and take the wind out of their sails but you got to see where I'm from no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm going to have this stuff going okay now Jay has free range you're trying so hard and I'm being told on the other hand that you know what you do make the decisions tell him to come at a certain times if you think it's now one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other has all the bottom line right we knew we didn't ready we're hung out to dry you've been working for us for two years you don't know the first rule of the show yes which is very simple it's us us if you're a part of us against the world well you see right you can't we can't have we can have we said it's you two against everybody oh no we're allowing we're allowing everyone that is part of the show on a weekly basis to be part of us but you're saying but with that said us again the world so if someone is conspiring against us the family and I whatever whatever you want to call it but you have to it's a no-brainer to come to us and say dude they are planning something what can we do but with that said with what we can't said you cannot you can never be a part of us if you're going to conspire against them right you just said then why would you turn against me if I tell Jane not to come in on a certain day that's not you're talking about something totally different I'm talking about levels of where things are going to turn you're talking about a secret being kept from this program to be sprung on us at a later date not a guest calling up and arranging guest scheduling right that's something completely different that it doesn't even make sense that you're using that to argue this point right and then I'm on and I had something to do with the lack of communication that was happening a long time ago I think we have settled that since then no no Rick that had something to do with the lack of communication we finally worked that out I believe between us and so that's not even an issue anymore to bring that and compare it to what what you did to us is is it Lord Chris guest scheduling and a conspiracy against Opie Anthony are two different things right there's a lot of misunderstandings that go on behind the scenes that was one of those misunderstandings where I was pissing you because I found out Jay Moore called the show a couple times or let's say even once and you didn't let him through because you thought we were we were too busy and no one ever came to and I said you know what Jay's trying to get in on the show do we have time you know to get him on the air or not but it never could that that was never brought in front of us so I got pissed well he called that's what that was about and that's a behind-the-scenes thing that we worked out since he called me the day of just before we were about to leave to go down to the bus and said hey I want to come by I'm like I don't think it's a good idea we got a lot going on today it goes right back to where somebody stands no it doesn't do that dude if anybody involved in this show got wind of a prank or a conspiracy against anyone else on this show it's a no-brainer that they immediately go to that person and explain what's going on so we as a team can just get together think up a way to turn it around and told and twice as bad screw the other person and wait and let me clarify that even better even further here if it's if it's a prank we're doing other because we're part of the family that's one thing but you're talking about someone from the outside coming in here and pulling one of the craziest pranks on us and we could have stopped it that's not what I if it's if it's us getting together and pranking spaz for good radio that's great that's the family messing with the family right you're allowed to do that right Corleone's play with each other yeah right but not without any occasion you said Jay is a part of the show not with Barzini Jay you said it Jay's a part of the show but the family he's not part of the family absolutely not a part of this program the people that are in this room right now spaz stinky the interns are part of this show part of the family he is a fantastic guest on this program a big part of our show but he's not part of the show I don't understand who is loyal to this program who is involved in this who is a part of the show and who guests I trust I trust stinky more than Jay more as far as far as being part of the family right because it were if this if this show went down the crap or tomorrow I don't think it would affect Jay Moore's career it would affect everybody else in this room right now is career right no I understand it's all about the guys that spend you know three four hours before the show in the back office you know trying to make something happen on a daily basis that is part of you pulled a Frado you watch the Godfather Frado remember remember Frado he said he never met Johnny Ola before shook hands at him hey this is Johnny Ola hey how you doing like they never met and then they went to a club later on Frado got a few in him and he goes yeah I've been here Johnny Ola took me here a while ago I was like oh but he said he didn't know Johnny Ola right that's what Michael knew but that's not that's that's not even right and when his mother died they took him fishing we've known Jay more for a while so I can't you can't even use that analogy oh my god I'm using the analogy that you conspired with outside forces against this program you absolutely did all I did we're gonna move forward you gotta accept the fact that you did all I'm saying is what if another radio station you know calls you and say hey Rick we want to we want to pull a fast one in open Anthony well absolutely not that man oh how do we know how do we know that's a no-brainer this one this should have been a no-brainer because to be honest with you those guys did make us look pretty silly you honestly feel that way yes if it was you if it was you and spaz and psycho mark and Ben trying to make it and I look silly and you're within the family you got us what can I say I can't some site what someone just emailed me what look at this site I don't know what this is hey Mark don't you have work to do it's 20 minutes after Carla we're sending you to Vegas you'll have nothing to do with the family remember that scene well anyway this is what happens that part right this is what happened this is how we perceived it I believe it's an accurate assessment of the situation regardless of Rick's argument but can you can you at least see my side where it's like all right I'm in a bad position if I don't know no I can't see your side at all attack the listeners are going to attack and then you guys are probably going to jump on I'm saying that it is such a no-brainer that you shouldn't even consider it for a split second right should instantly if someone approached me about playing a gag on oak the second that person left the room I would go to Opie and say oh this person wants to do this they said this blah blah blah what are we going to do about it right and that's what we do and then I'll do the same thing that's not even what happened it was three days later that they're like hey Rick we got to tell you some three days into a seven day gag on Opie and Anthony so you knew long before it wrapped up you knew well they wanted to wrap it that day doesn't matter you knew and you didn't tell us you knew didn't tell us because I know we we could have pulled a fast one on them absolutely and then it would have still had the same result there would have been unbelievable prank but we turned it around when it came out on top all you had to do was give us a little info be little loyal to the family and we could have turned it around Bozzini, Tattaglia. Who was it Carlo? Who approached you? Who approached you about Sonny? You figured Sonny didn't you Carlo? It was Bozzini. Okay Carlo here's two tickets here's a plane ticket to Vegas you're out of the family business go out in the car Clemenza's waiting in the back seat with a piece of piano wire your shoes can go through the window hello Carlo and Fish and also involved in the conspiracy. Could you get me off the hook for old times sake? Can't do it Sally. Well in fairness to Rick there's a couple people that think Rick is in the right here. Who? Well let's talk to Bob. Hey what's happening? Hey Bob. How you doing? Good. I tell you guys are fantastic yesterday was awesome. Yeah I got a stick up for Rick man. How? Because you guys just don't like being on the fuzzy end of the stick you know I mean it was a great prank and you guys said it was the first time you guys have ever been pranked. Yeah but we didn't. You don't like it you don't like being on the fuzzy end of the stick. We don't like when it's one of our own people. If Rick wasn't involved we'd have reacted the same way we did we'd have said oh my god they got us wow good but to know that Rick was in the fold there and he's involved in this show personally ah. Guys you got to say it was awesome radio. It was good radio. It was great radio. We're not saying that. We're saying that the loyalty lies with the people in this program period period it's non-negotiable. If there was another radio when you guys brought up the radio station I had to agree with that but this was totally out of left field and it had me going like crazy and I thought it was you know legit until the end. Bob either way it would have been you know good radio it would have been nice if we came out on top and we had that chance. Yeah but you guys they laughed in our face they had t-shirts already made and we looked silly right we look silly. I don't know if they were laughing. You don't like they were laughing. After you blocked Paul everybody was laughing because you hit Paul. Well yeah it was that was an it was awesome radio man you couldn't you guys couldn't have done it better. Alright. Fantastic Rick thumbs up man. Thank you Bob. Well see people are thinking that I'm involved from the start. I'm not. It doesn't matter when you were involved though. It doesn't matter. Totally done. We had a chance to really pull one over on those guys and we would be sitting here to this day with no one pulling a prank on us. Right. And we pulled some amazing pranks in our career. We've gotten everyone. Rick is a tool. Never trust a spick. Oh my God. I'm throwing race into it there Ray. My goodness. Rudy what's up. Yeah man. He's sold out. Yeah. The play though man. You know. Yeah. I could do it. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm smart. I'm I'm on that but it's within the family. Right. It will never be an outside force trying to use me. In other words, you will never conspire with Jay to do something to Anthony. Absolutely not. No. Or vice versa. No, we're not. In most cases, I would probably tell Anthony they've got something planned for you. Within the family even. Alright, yeah. I don't want to hold it up too much because I'm the one who wants to know about the car. Okay. Because the car comes into the whole thing. Because the crap, Ant, and I have been through over the years and now these guys are all part of this as well now. We like to feel that nobody can come into this program from the outside and pull one over on us ever, ever because we're all loyal to each other. That's the way it is. If someone pulls something over on us, it is because nobody inside the family that is the Opie and Anthony show knew in any way, shape, or form before or during the event. No one should ever, ever know and not tell us. And Rick? You didn't. You didn't tell. You didn't tell. That's enough. That is enough right there. Even though Cousin Jay... Cousin Jay! Jay is a fantastic guest on this show. Has carte blanche to come in here whenever he wants to. To call whenever he wants. But as far as being a part, a member of the Opie and Anthony show, yeah, we say, yeah, Jay is a part of the show. Notice he hasn't said Billy and Paul once. Ah yeah. How about Billy and Paul? That argument isn't as strong. Jay is closer to the show than Billy and Paul. Let me just make that point. If it was just Billy and Paul and a few other people, then no, they're hung out to dry. Oh stop it. They're hung out to dry. But because I know the tie that Jay has with you guys, I've got to sit there and go, what the hell do I do? I sit on my hands, what the hell do I do? You can't let a Hollywood star get the best of us. It's a no brainer. I'm serious Rick, it's a no brainer. You guys have turned on me with him before, so what am I expecting to happen? What so what? He's feeling like Freda, like we turned on him. We passed him over as Don. Rick, answer this honestly, okay? I'm smacked. So let's say the events were different. You went, oh my God, I know that this is all a prank. They're trying to get one on the guys. And you came, Tuss and told us that. Do you honestly think Aunt and I were going to go, why did you tell us? This was going to be a great idea. Oh Rick, you wrecked it. Why did you tell us? Or would we have said, oh my God, thank you so much for letting us in and then we would have said, I thought that something was fishy. Alright, let's all get together and see what we can pull on them. At some point, yeah, you probably would have said, oh man, that's great. But okay, now that we know, let's get them. I would have never said to you, Rick, why did you tell me? Never. I didn't say you wouldn't say why did you tell me. You would have acknowledged that. That was a great thing. But that was one of your concerns. It was. We were going to yell at you and go, why are you telling us this? This is too good. Shouldn't even be a question. Shouldn't have been. Shouldn't even be a question. No. No. Alright, so anyway. So that's where that stood. Regardless of how you feel about it, the rest of the people on this program feel that you should have come to us and said something. But put yourself in my position and if I was Rick, I swear to God, two seconds. As fast as I could carry myself, I'd have told us. Yeah. I would have. Especially how intense that was and we really weren't sure if it was fake or real for a while. Hindsight is always 20-something. Come on, Rick. That's not a hindsight thing. It is. At least admit it. Come on. At least admit it. There are certain things that there's no hindsight on. It's an insinuation that you make and that's it. There's not even, there's no hindsight on something that you should decide like that. If it was anybody else. Oh. Oh. No. No. Kathy, what's going on? I don't know. You're beating up Rick. It seems like you're taking it all too personally. Well we are. I'll admit, we are taking it personally. We don't like when people get us. Well, it doesn't feel good. It's embarrassing but I think you get it for the good of the show. Good of the show? What is this, morning radio? No. The good of the show. Yeah, but it was great to listen to. Well, who knows what would have come out if we knew and were able to turn it around and pull something on them. I'm not saying, it might have ended up being lousy radio. It might have, the way it turned out, could have been the best thing as far as what it sounded like over these airwaves. Which is fine. But, it doesn't matter. But it doesn't matter. You've got to admit it wouldn't have been nearly as funny for the listeners. That's not the issue. To play the prank on them as it was to hear it. It doesn't matter. You know what, I'm not even going to admit that. I have confidence what Ant and I could come up with and we were to come up with some. And the shock in their face when all of a sudden they realized that we knew. Ha! It would have been funny for you, but for the listeners, I don't care whether they were embarrassed by it. I don't care what you did to them. I just thought it was funny. Alright. The way it worked out. That's all. Well, I'm not going to deny that. It was good radio. That's not the point here. No, no. You've got to give me some credit. Thanks, Kathy. You threw a punch for the first time in years. Credit. Credit? You think I felt good about punching someone in the face? Yeah. Well, part of me. Alright, you got me there. See, at least I can admit it. Alright, we could argue this for eight years here. Alright, let's fast forward then. Alright, we've got to take a break. No, we do. Ant, look at the time. I'm not doing a radio. And then we'll talk. No, I mean this is the setup though. Right. This is the setup and part two is next, okay? Okay. First, Michael Lookingland checking in. What? Alright, we'll be back. 1027, tell you next. Opie and Anthony. And the story about Rick's car. Next. It's the ONA show. Our phone number 2127571027. Russ, what's up? Hey, you guys have beat a bunch of pansies. Why? Because today they've got a good hook on you and you just let it go. Are you totally missing the point here? No, I'm not missing the point. I'm not talking about- I'm not missing the point. What's the point we're trying to make then? You explain the point that we were trying to make. Go ahead. That he went over your heads and didn't let you know what was going on. Okay, is the point at all the outcome of the gag here? That it was good radio or bad radio or anything? That we're being pansies because we got taken? No. We're talking about people on the show telling us when somebody is trying to do something to us. That's all. That's all this is about. So you agree it was a good prank though? Yeah, we said that a thousand times. We patted them all on the back. I went out to dinner with all of them. You're a baby. Alright, Russ. You're being a baby about it. Thank you, Russ. I'll fix something in that chick's mouth to shut her up. I guess a lot of these people don't understand the world of radio. I guess not. I don't know. There's a lot of people in this industry that are out for our heads. They're missing the point. You know? We always have to be on guard for people trying to get us. Trying to prank us, trying to get us. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well, you know, regardless. There's a lot of people saying, hey, what are you talking about this for? It happened months ago. We were just trying to fill you in on what happened so we could tell you what happened after this. Right. The thing about Rick's car. Right. So about what? Three months ago? Three weeks ago or so? Yeah, about three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, I guess. You know what it was? Yeah. We find out that somebody went up to Rick's car. And this was... I don't want to say it in a way that... I'm going to get mad or anything. I'll just say it at this point. You already beat the hell out of the whole place. It wasn't in front of your house, was it? Right? Close enough. Okay. All right. Well, anyway, took his car, wrapped it in newspaper. Totally. Like there wasn't one piece of car left sticking out of the newspaper. But didn't get any tape on the car or anything. Wrapped it up very nicely. It was a great wrapping. Yeah. It really was. Then took a pile of newspapers, put it on the hood, the car all wrapped up, and then put a fish on that pile of newspapers. Right. And then took a ceramic... A real fish, by the way. Yeah, a real fish. A ceramic horse head. What kind of fish was it? I'm not trying to make jokes. I'm just curious. I think it was like three feet long. Yeah, it was huge. And took a ceramic horse head and put it on the hood. And a big black letters across the windshield that said, Fredo. Mark, you still work here? And a note. A cryptic note. Right, where all the letters were cut out of magazines and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, it was written out of magazines or something like that. Right. So I'm trying to find it. Yeah. And these pictures ended up on the unofficial Opium Anthony website. And Rick had no clue. And when he found out, he completely lost it. Here's the note. Fredo Rick, you're like our older brother, but don't ever take sides against the family again. ONA Flipmo Squad. Signed it, I guess. And there was a wow sticker on the fish. Yeah, there's a wow sticker on the fish. And the car just completely wrapped up. Right. Well, Rick, needless to say, freaked the F out. Like freaked out. Thought that somebody had stalked him down or something and wrapped the car up. He's very upset wondering how they knew it was his car. Just a whole bunch of things flashed in his mind like, oh my God, there's a stalker or something. Well, and in fairness to Rick, I will stick up for him. His wife got really upset. Okay. Because she was the one that found it. And obviously that's not cool. We're not that sick and twisted around here. And she got really upset because she really thought it was some psycho. You know, that was just taking it way too far, obviously. And we knew nothing about this. Wow, listeners aren't like that. So I understand why Rick got so pissed. You know, when your wife or your girlfriend is that upset and really worried and thinking that someone really is out there stalking you. Now, during the course of the day, we got certain information. The day after, correct? Yeah, the day after. Now, Rick called me at home and stuff. And I swear when you called me, I had no free flow that it was an inside job. I really did not know. And that's the truth. Didn't know. And Rick was starting to think Psycho Mark was involved at some point. And Psycho Mark, you weren't involved, right? The best part is I had nothing to do with it. He's convinced. You were already ratted out. Dude, he's so convinced that I had something to do with it, which is the best part. You were already ratted out. Rick, I didn't do anything. You're the worst liar. Don't worry. Rick, I took so much joy in this because you thought I did it and I had nothing to do with it. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I knew about it, but I did not do it. See? That's why you were already ratted out. I knew about it two weeks before it happened. See? And the problem with that. See, that's where I have a problem. See, that's the problem. I definitely have a problem with Psycho Mark because of that too. Now wait, if it's a payback. Yeah, but they should have let us know. But guess what? The prank wasn't pulled on Psycho Mark. Well, Psycho Mark didn't know about the J. Moore air sick prank. Now this was a retribution for that. That's why this person did this to Rick's car. So now Rick thinks it's just some psychopath stalking him and tampering with his personal goods and stuff like that. Freaks out. And why do I think that? Because of all the weird emails we always get. Right, right. Of course he should think that. And we had the discussion before we even started the show that day about all the weirdos out there. We talked about Ope's problem and your possible problem that was floating out there. Now this is where it gets really weird though because we all agree we weren't going to talk about it on the air. Exactly. Because it was a lunatic. So you don't want to talk about it on the air to give the person any publicity, to maybe entice that person to do something else or something. It's just best left off the air. Which of course we didn't talk about it on the air until... We found out it was an inside job. It was an inside job. It was a retribution for what you had done. So even though you did not know yet, we then knew and were going to present it on the air. Alright, see that's where I had a serious problem. Of course you did because you still were under the impression that it was a lunatic when we brought it out on the air. So your impression is, oh my God they're talking about this and it's a lunatic. Our impression is we know who did it, that's why we're talking about it. Well you know what? You guys, I wasn't informed. Why? So to me it's still a problem especially, hold on, especially since we had an agreement that it was not to be talked about. I told my wife, I called her, I said look I talked to the guys, they said they weren't going to talk about it. So now she can just relax and not worry about it. So now you think we should have come up to you and said, Rick, it's a gag off the air so that way we could spring it spontaneously on the air. That it was a joke. It wouldn't have worked that way. The only way it works is on the air you freaking the F out thinking we're talking about it because you think it's a crazed listener or something. And when we did bring it up on the air we made it apparent very early on that we knew exactly what was going on and it wasn't a psycho fact. Well Rick lost his mother F-ing mind. He ran around this place destroying a property. Pretty much everything in his sight. Everything was like a tornado. They still haven't fixed the bathroom door on the nice job. The hardware is still up on the shelf by the soap. It was like the Tasmanian double. Yeah, just spinning around with stuff flying. We were sitting in the office at one point and you just heard like things banging and blowing up. I don't know what you were thinking. But see, your problem obviously was that you thought it was a nut. We knew it wasn't. It wasn't even that. It got to the point where we had an agreement before we went on the air that day not to talk about it. That was the problem. That was my big problem. But then when we knew it was an inside out. And if we could have just gone over things quickly beforehand just to say, Okay, look, it wasn't a wacko. We'll tell you all about it. No, no, no. You know why? No, no, no. You know why? Because I'm still thinking of the person who doesn't know anything. And who would that person be? When we made the agreement. Who is that person? When we made the agreement with you. Who is that person really? We made the agreement with you, Rick. I'm answering for that question. We truly did not have all the funds. I understand, but who would that person be that still would not know anything? What? Who would the person be who was involved and still did not know anything? You, but... No, no, no, no. Oh, Linda. Exactly. No, we made it very... But the way we were talking about it, we instantly made it known that it was an inside job. Within minutes of talking about it on the air, it was obvious to everyone it was a gag and that it was an inside job. We didn't just start talking about it and make it still seem like it was a crazy listener or something. No, not at all. We were saying that we know who did it and blah, blah, blah. I understand that. But still, my whole problem for waking out is we had an agreement and you guys broke it. The agreement was based on the fact that you didn't know who it was. Yeah, and the agreement was... And why was that? Because my wife was freaked out. Because it was a joke. It was a gag. Yeah, but who the hell knew it? Not you, that's why it worked. Only you guys. Yeah, and who knew about the air sick general thing? You did. Who didn't know? We didn't know. And it was retribution for that? I mean, the prank you were involved with with the air sick guys got so serious, I punched someone. So what's your point? That's how pranks work. People don't know and then you spring it on. My point is we had an agreement beforehand and it should have been stuck to. Even if it was just saying, look, we're about to talk about this. You know, you might want to call Linda, let her know that we're going to talk about this and she can find out everything. She doesn't have to worry. The rules changed midway when we found out who did it and that it was an inside job. And that's when the rules changed. I got to protect my wife and what she feels. Well, that's why we went on the air and didn't... You don't have a problem with that, right? That's why we went on the air and didn't make it seem like it was a listening. But that's why I didn't want it on the air. But Rick, you can't tell somebody about a prank off the air and then get on the air and it's not spontaneous. Right, we don't do fake radio. You guys wanted me to tell you about the prank that was being pulled on you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's why it got pulled on you. That's why it was pulled on you. It's called retribution. It's called retribution, yes. If you were part of the family, we would have never done that to you. And we didn't do it. And believe me, we didn't know about it before it happened. We only found out after it happened. And you know why else I didn't want it on? Because of the people who were involved. It had nothing to do with the show. There were certain people involved that nobody knows. Right. That live in that area. And that's the last thing I want is to point out directions as to where the hell I live. Well, somebody took the initiative to pay back, to do a little payback. You had the police involved. Yeah. What's up? You had poor Keith calling me five times that night to apologize and beg not to say anything because he didn't want to lose his job. I called because I felt that with Linda, I didn't want her to worry about it. I honestly didn't think that when the prank was pulled that you were going to get upset about it. That's why I called Linda and I called you to apologize because I felt bad that she thought that she'd gone that way. I told him, I go, dude, I applaud the prank. I go, I think it's hilarious. I go, but not in front of my house. Right. If it was done, if my car was in the parking garage and the guy pulls up and the top is down and everything's covered with paper, I'm laughing my ass off. Because I don't have to worry about anything being done in front of where I live. That was my big problem and that's what I was upset about. Steve from the city, hey, Rick's gone soft since getting married. That's what $700 pots will do to you. I have to say that I didn't know that you lived right there. I knew that you commuted from the train station and it took me two days driving around with that dead fish in the back of my truck looking for your car. I looked in the train station. I drove through every parking garage in the area before I finally started going street to street looking for your car with this dead fish in the back of my truck. I believe we have found the obsessed fan. Yeah. What the hell's wrong with you, Keith? And, you know, it was payback because I felt that the family is the family. And although I'm not an immediate family. Well, Keith, you're not part of the family. Right. I will have to say that. I agree. I'm a guest on the show. And I felt that it would be good radio. It would be a good prank. And as, you know, somebody who's, you know. Now, Rick, here's where this all comes into play. Let's say that the prank with Jay never happened. Or, on the other hand, let's say the prank happened but you did come to OPI and we tried to work something out. But you did come with us with the information. The second I found out that Keith was responsible for your car, I would have come right to you and said, Rick, this is the deal. But then you went right on the air with it. No. I would have come to you off the air and said, Rick, I know who did this. Don't worry about it. Here's the deal. But since what happened happened with Jay, why am I going to say anything? Well, how do I know that? Because that's how we work. That's how OPI knows it. Yeah, I could just look at it and know he's not going to be a nut to me. Ben knows it. That's the agreement you two have with each other. No, that's the agreement this whole program has. We're allowing it all. We are that tight. You're saying that now. The whole show is. The whole show is. That's what we're saying. Right. So that's the point. So he was freaking for like days. We couldn't even talk about it. I mean, we couldn't even mention it. Even though he knew at that point it was a gag against him. We didn't know up until after it was done. The day we mentioned it on the air. That's when we found out. And believe me, one of the reasons for bringing it up on the air was so you wouldn't go home still thinking you had a nut. We figured we'd do it on the air and let you know that it was indeed a prank. And that was it. But for a week straight, oh my God, walking on eggshells. We won't even mention the car. Are people replacing things around the... What happened to the trophy? Oh my God. It fell all right. Off of what? The top of the building? Yeah, I mean the old N.E.W. staff worked hard to get that trophy. I hit a triple to bring in... So are we finally done with all this? Yeah, that's what happened with Rick's car. And he was just flipping. So that's it. Now, are we all on the same page? I think so. Are we all on the same page? We know that if we're ever approached by anyone else for any gags, we tell the other people. But on that note also, it wasn't even that good of a prank. No, that was pretty good. That was good radio. It freaked you out, man. It freaked you out, we got some good audio. No, it was good stuff. That part... but the prank itself, it's like... It would have been better if you allowed... It would have been better if you allowed the pictures to stay up on the unofficial website. You should at least let that one picture up there for a day. No one knows what kind of car it is. The close one? Well, we haven't mentioned it. We haven't mentioned the car. Oh my God, you could plunk down any car. We haven't mentioned it. We'll probably know it. Whatever. But it doesn't... It's part of the ONA trivia for Christ's sake. It doesn't show it in that picture. That's what I'm trying to say. It could be any car under that newspaper, the picture I'm looking at. Yeah, whoever knows, knows. But you can't tell from that picture. But we didn't even mention the car once during this whole break. Anyway, so it's simple. It's us against the world. And when I say us, it's not aunt and I, it's us! We've all been working our balls off on this radio show. Even Stinky's part of us now. Even that idiot over there is. Even though I got problems with him. F you! So... Alright, well that's it. And that's the end of the story. There you go. You see, it wasn't even that good of a prank. It was a good idea, but it just wasn't done in a good way. No, it was good. Like I said, if it was done... The confrontational radio is very good. I'm just saying the prank itself. And I told Keith, I said, it was a great job. The fact that you were able to do all that stuff, that's fine. I didn't have a problem with that. And he knows what the problem was. But if it was done in the car garage, and you know, somebody parked downstairs with a video camera, when I come up... It was good payback. But the fact of the matter is, you had two teenage girls who had nothing to do with anything getting grilled by the cops over it. Alright. You had another lady who lives down that street being visited by the cops at all hours of the night to talk about it. Like I said, we had nothing to do with that. Those people aren't even involved. But it was good radio. Yeah. On many levels. And good payback. I expected more. You're absolutely right, Rick. Everyone knows. That's all that's coming in on the instant payback. Well, we shared too much on this show. Everyone knows where Spaz lives. A lot of people know where I live now. They all know our names. Well, so... Alright, we gotta take a break and regroup. Alright. Are we all on the same page? We're all a family now again. We take care of this. Everyone's loyal. Stinky, you loyal? Yes, I'm very loyal. There you go. Stinky, someone comes to you on the outside and they have an idea for a prank against the show. What are you gonna do? I'll hide it from you guys. Alright, you're fired. Wrap your bicycle up. Wrap a skateboard. Alright, let's take a break, Anthony. We'll come back, okay? Right. Do we have info on the next roadshow? No? Nothing confirmed, but we did find a place last night. I thought we were gonna... But as soon as we get the paper in the next day or so, we should know. Alright, I guess we can say this much. We're hoping to throw a huge summer kickoff party next Thursday. We really are hoping. I thought we could talk about it, but we're waiting for people to sign stuff and things like that. It's not that close yet, okay? Yeah, man. See, everyone knows what car... there's my car. What? Yeah, but... Yeah, that's true. Dude, I... There are a lot of those around and... A lot. ...and give me more. Not when I'm at a traffic light and people drive right up to me and start honking just to say hi. Well, turn the Riffy Martin music down. Alright, we gotta take a break. We'll be back. OP and Anthony. Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding. Yes, I love my Rockaway Bedding bed. Rockaway Bedding has 140 stores throughout New York and New Jersey.

Smack my bitch up. Send this out to Sean Connery. Yeah, they want to... Smack my bitch up. I guess they don't want him knighted. They want to strip him of his knighthood. Yeah, I guess it's a big story in what, the post today? Yeah, even after he's... Let's see, yeah, he's supposed to be knighted by the Queen, but they want to strip him of it because, well, for years it seems he's just been smacking his bitches up. Oh. Oh my God. What's wrong with that? Come here, come here you lovely little thing. Come here, come here, give us a kiss. You stupid bitch. God, Sean Connery is... Well, it's quite an honor to be knighted, and they feel like they shouldn't give him to someone that beats his women. Yeah, you know? Well, there was controversy with him back in, I guess, the early 90s. He was on an interview with Barbara Walters and said he could imagine hitting his wife. Two years after he said that, he tried to justify the statement in Vanity Fair. Well, let's be honest. I think we could all imagine hitting our woman. Oh my God. There are times you really do want to do it, but there's something that tells you in the back of your head that it's not a good thing to do. Well, he tried to explain it by saying... Sometimes you do get pissed and you imagine a lot of things, Anthony. He says to Barbara Walters, about the Barbara Walters interview in Vanity Fair, I was really saying that to slap a woman is not the coolest thing you can do to her. It's much more cruel to psychologically damage someone. I'm not right, you slut. I'm going to take a crowbar and smash you in the face with it. I told her to shit. What? In the chair. Oh, sit. Sit down. You say sit very unusual. I am the speech impediment of my essence. I said, come here, you're lovely. Now sit. Sit down. Before I smack you. Bloody bitch. Yeah, yeah. This is a great little... Little, uh... Like a story of what happened years ago. His wife at the time, the sultry Diana Salento, became friendly with a hotel waiter. The actor ordered her to go to the hotel suite. Go back to the suite and shit there and wait for me. You're saying sit, right? Shit, that's what I said. Sit. Sit in the chair. Diana Salento, she became friendly with the hotel waiter. So I said, go back to the hotel and shit and wait for me. She went there. The actor returned to the suite and allegedly... Allegedly... Delivered a brutal beating. Connery hit her, not with the flat of his hands, but with fists, full between the eyes. Jesus. Another blow follows the first and then another and another until Salento falls back onto the bed. Her face a bloody mess. The next morning, the hotel waiter is in the hotel room. The next morning, the face of one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation was ballooned up like a puffer fish. He'd feed the crap out of her. What a douche. Thank God. Talk to a waiter. Now get back to the suite and shit there and wait for me. You just don't know. I'm losing my hair and it pisses me off. That's what it is. Going bald. Hands falling in my face, you bitch. Your fault. Goddamn. That sounds pretty brutal. You know, in a face like that. My women, I like to actually hit them with phone books about the body so they can't tell. Ike had a good idea. Remember Ike Turner? Yeah. She would beat her with a car antenna on her body so she could perform later that night and not be all bruised up. See, Sean Connery doesn't know that the finer arts are beating your woman. You've got to punch her internal organs like the universe, allegedly. But I like the hotel room thing. That's good. Ike and Mike likes the hotel because then he doesn't have to ping the blood above his own floor of his own house. What does Sean Connery think of Mike Tyson's advice there? Mike, just go shit in a corner. Sit, right? That's what I say. Why do you keep questioning me? I just want to make sure. Of course I'm saying shit. Sit down. I don't want them dumping out the show if you're really saying sit. Sit down, yeah. Shit, that's what I'm saying. Right. Like in a chair. It's that speech in front of you, right? That's what it is, something with my S's. I have a hard time saying shit. I like that O.J. Simpson. A good man. What's wrong with that? Sometimes you just imagine that. You have to shit and concentrate. Sit down in a chair. Sometimes I just like to sit down on the toilet. Yes, I guess they're going to try to do it. I think they're going to try to do it. Wow. Yes, I guess they're going to try to take his knighthood away. I don't think it means the same thing these days, people. What's the big deal? Didn't Paul McCartney get knighted? Let's see him on armor on top of a horse jousting or anything. Maybe it meant something in the old days. Anthony Hopkins, right? Yeah. He's a knight now. Sir Anthony Hopkins, knighted. Yeah, now could you send them all into battle? Like the old days with big maces and swords. Could you see that? Get over here. Wow. Chopped my hair off. It's only a flesh wound. The queen will give me a sword and I'll beat my wife over the head with it. Bitch. Sit here. Sit. Paul McCartney going into battle, swinging a big battle axe. Please, what does the knighthood mean anymore? Swinging the spike ball. Can't you see that? Yes, I can see that. You know what the old knights used to do? Lock up that snatch. Remember that? That's not abusive. Used to put this chastity belt on when they went into battle so the farm workers and stuff couldn't come by and bang them. Well then maybe Sean Cowdery should be knighted. It's chivalry. Generally I've heard of this piece of allies support the KSус. Is this connected to old BulletSheep magazine? heartbreak big hammer from Braveheart. Remember that big hammer that came to guy's head in? I smacked my bitch up with that one. Go with your waiter friend you whore. Wait for me there all bloodied and I'll slam my yam bag against your ass. I'll be at laugh your balls off and shitting on stage in a stool. I said why you keep correcting me? I just want to make sure. Well thank you Sean Connery for stopping by today. Elton John's a knight. Jesus Christ. He's going to go into battle with a dildo. Big dildo. He should be a dame. Elizabeth Taylor became a dame. Do you see her staggering up to the Queen? She was claiming in the paper that she's not old yet. And the people still call her one of the most beautiful women. She always makes the issue of like people's most beautiful women. Honestly shouldn't the most beautiful women be based on looks? Has that gotten so politically correct now you can't even say when you're basing something on beauty it doesn't matter if they got a brain in their head or not or if they've been around or it's green legends. It's time to use the past tense. It should be. Maybe she was beautiful years ago when Mickey Rooney was banging her. But now? You should judge that on the fact that would you like to rip her clothes off and see her standing in nature. Picture that one. I'd rather see the Queen mum. That big head of black hair all dyed on her head and the big patch of grey down there. Dude come on man. I don't need that visual. I'm going to beat that bitch out in the jaw. Come here Elton. Yes. Talking that way to get back to the suede shit and wait for me. Oh look who's on the line. Nikki from We Deliver Kegras. What does she want? Nikki. Hello lovely Nikki. I'm only calling because I'm sorry. You know Nikki I would love to come over your house and smack your face. I'm sorry to say thank you even though I got smacked. Nikki can I? You wait. Shut up you bitch. Wait in the hotel suite. Sit there and I'll come over and beat you. Tell me about the task gun. I'm very interested. Shut up boy. Shut up. Shut up. Totemic twat. Alright fine. Fine you're obviously still pissed about yesterday. Have you seen her? Are you a big James Bond fan? Do you remember 007? I got a hundred thousand and I just wanted you to know I stole the task gun. Thanks for the effort. So I'm saying goodbye. Boy something's going to win. Talk to her you kind of agree with John Connor. I'll stick a gold finger in there. I'll gold fist. Money penny. Money penny get over here. Sit there and let me smack you. I like my martinis like I like my women. Shaken. And then punch. Shaken that's the cue. What kind of inventions do you have for me today? Something I could remotely beat my wife from miles away just with the push of a button. Or an ejector seat so she can sit there and I can eject her right out of the car. Cue suck it. Give me a pad. We still have Sean in here. Give me a pad. Quick go. Write faster. I'm reading. Money penny look what I did to you again. Oh. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm over here now. He got jacked. Do we have to take a break. Gary can you wait I'm over here now. What sex? Yeah, bald sex. Alright, do we have to take a break? Gary, could you wait before you give your 90210 review? From yesterday? Alright, hold on. We're going to take a quick break. I know, we'll play for them after the spots. Oh yeah. Yeah, 90210. Okay. Gary from upstairs is going to give us his review on the final episode of 90210. Rock.

In the studio, Gary from upstairs. Yeah. He's pretty much in charge of the sales force here at WNEW. And we also found out that he's a pussywhip. You said it yesterday, not me. Of course, Gary was on the show yesterday, Anthony. Yeah. He had to rush home to watch the final episode of 90210. Yeah, we were talking to him toward the end of the show, and he said, I got to go. I got to watch the final episode. And it wasn't even him that has to watch it. His chick is going to watch it, but he has to sit there with her and watch it. With her. She made you watch it, right? I wouldn't watch that. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wouldn't watch it, but you did. Because you don't have two TVs, obviously. I saw David and Aaron Donner, so that was the only thing I saw. Oh, no. You watched. Is that how the show ended? And Kelly with Dylan. But that dish bag, Brandon never showed up. Were you disappointed? You were expecting him to show up? I was hoping Brandon would make an appearance. Hey! It's been on the show for... So you watch every week. I don't watch that. Oh, sure. Listen, he knows everything about it. I thought they canceled that show years ago. I know. I really can't stay too long. I got an aerobics glance. You're lying, aren't you? Are you lying? No. What kind of aerobics are you doing tonight? Are you carrying that aerobics? No, I'm not carrying that aerobics. How the hell are potential clients supposed to come to the table and bargain with you? They'll come here because they'll think he's a pushover. So what type of aerobics? Water aerobics? No, I do it. You mean like synchronize the swimming? You do some of that Tae Bo? No, just regular aerobics. With your girlfriend? With the girlfriend. No, by myself. You're lying, man. Guys don't do aerobics classes by themselves. I'm sorry. I'm sure there are guys out there that go with their girlfriend or wife, but if you have the choice, you don't go pick up an aerobics class. It's just for coordination. Is that it? Yeah, that's all. Your girlfriend's on line. She's tough. Is she going to kill us today? I don't know. I'm going to get picked on. Is Gary there? Lizbeth. Hi. It's open Anthony. We got you on the air, so don't curse. You can say whatever you want besides I'm home. Oh, because I needed him to bring something home. What? That's what he brought home last month. The same brand. Have to go out and buy some effeminate stuff? Yeah, I just need the same brand, but I really need them tonight. So could you just tell him because they told me that he wasn't in his office, that he may have left, and then they transferred me downstairs. Well, he's right here. What did you say before? So you go out and buy... Who is this? It's open Anthony, and Gary's in the studio with us, Elizabeth. But I'm sorry. He doesn't have to bring that home. Well, he has to bring it home, but don't talk about it. No, Elizabeth, Gary enjoy the final episode of 90210. He always makes me watch that. Come on, you're making me look bad. Is it either that or Ali McBeal? Get out of here. Any guy that could sit through an episode of Ali McBeal, I swear to God that you would have to be gay. No, he's not. He loves Ali. You like Ali McBeal, Gary? Too skinny. I think he has a crush on the Asian one. Oh, well we all do. So you sat and you watched, he got home in time, you're all excited and sat there. Yeah, he made me sit there and watch the whole thing. Yeah, but then you also watched the last half hour of Nick Dane. Yeah, well I made you watch that. Yeah, Dan Marley killed us last night. Does he buy feminine hygiene products for you? Well, I need him to do it, you know, when he has to. Would you go into the store with a big box of maybe Tampax or something? Come on, there's nothing wrong with being sensitive. He's very sensitive, he's really a great guy. You know, his macho stuff. Gary, Eddie on line 8 wants to know if you have a sundress on. Eddie, no, he's not wearing a sundress today. What are people saying about him? Oh, he's getting killed. Oh, I'd better not, he's going to get really mad at me. Tex on line 2 says, doesn't Gary have a line dancing class to get to Tex? Oh, come on, he's really a good guy. He likes to golf, that's a guy thing. Sure. Has he bought you $700 pots yet? $700 pots. Nobody would do that. Well, Rick, whatever. Yeah, but if you can just have him come home as soon as possible. Alright, yeah, he looks like he's ready to leave. Listen, I could do the other stuff. I could not come home, I could not help with the dishes, all the other stuff if that's what you'd like. Oh, so you'd do that too? You'd do the dishes and stuff? Oh, don't get mad at me. If you don't want me to help out. Oh, you're going to ruin the whole night. Gary, what you got to do is lead with your left. Oh, no, really honey, I don't mean it. Yeah, right. Steve on Line 1 wants to know if Gary has a Kathy Lee CD yet. He's always using mine. Just kidding, just kidding. Alright, well, he's on his way. Yeah, he's coming up. What's on the TV tonight? Let me see, it's Thursday. Oh, he likes Friends. No, I don't like Friends. I watch Popular. Popular? No, I won't let him watch that. Teenage girls look good in that show. That might not be all that bad. I got to agree with Gary on that one. Nothing wrong with teenage moths. Yeah, no, I don't like him looking at teenage girls. Followed by Charmed. Charmed? It's that one, yeah. Alright, so I'm going to go now, but if he could pick that up for me, I'd appreciate it. I'm going to kill you when I get home. Alright, Elizabeth. The lovely Elizabeth. Give me my yule hook. Okay, bye. Gary, Mike on line 9 wants to play What's in Gary's Pants. What's this? Mike, what's going on? Gary's going to play What's in My Pants a lot. He's a homo. Alright, thank you, Mike. Vaginas. It would be different if he was in David's calling asking What's in My Pants, but Mike? Vaginas. I hope I don't have to explain that to you, Gary. He's assuming you're a woman. Bobby, what's going on? Gary, you big pussy. Hey, do you know Gabe Markle? He might be your sex partner. Hey! Hey! You missed the whole Nick game practically. Yeah, that's the man support. So what's on the Lifetime Channel tonight, Gary? I don't know. He wanted to tell you. I have no clue. I don't usually watch that, but the Chicago Hope. Let's go to Dennis. Dennis? Hey! Hey! What's going on? I wonder if Gary's going to earn his Red Wings tonight. You know, it's that time of the month. You've got to earn those every once in a while. I think your girlfriend shared a little too much today. I think so. Thanks a lot, guys. Syndication, huh? Yeah. Tonight on Lifetime, Just for Gary, a special movie with Markey Post and Linda Carter. As two women wondering if they're more womanly than Gary. Hey, Frank! Hey, how you doing, buddy? Great. I just want to know, does Gary sit to pee? Thank you, Frank. Take care, guys. All these guys worried about their manhood. And then you got Dan. He wants to know if Liz borrows your tampons, Gary. How many guys watched the show last night that listened to the opening? 90210? I don't think there's any guy out there brave enough to admit it. Gary Boxer's brief or a thong. What is it? The people want to know. Matt, what's up? Yeah, I just want to know. What's up, precious? Anthony, Gary, Gary, I just got to ask you. Is that some of the hygiene product for you or your girlfriend? Because anybody who watched the Beverly Hills 90210, whatever the hell that show is, I mean, are you just, are you pee-whipped or are you just complete homo? Not a homo. Listeners chiming in. Boy, oh boy. What a brutal bunch this is. Just because you're not a read? Just because you're sitting there and watch a show. Well, listeners know how to read. You calm down and you sell that show. Oh yeah, I forgot. Matt, what's up? Yo, what's up, guys? Hey, Gary, you want to be a lesbian for a day? New nickname for Gary is bitch boy. Bitch boy. Does he let you first do the dishes before you are? Before you get to your shows? Before you get to your serials? Yeah. Watching the dishes real quick, hurrying. Oh, turn the volume up. I'm going to miss the beginning. Well, Bob saw 90210 last night. Bob? Hello? You calling from the village? No, not exactly. I didn't watch the dishes last night, but I watched 90210. I did? I'll tell you why. And I haven't watched it for years, but I just had to get one last shot of Donna Martin's fun bags before they went off the air. I don't even know who Donna Martin is. She's a Tori Spelling. Wait, she has the worst boob job in the history of boob jobs. Yeah, but they're huge. It looks like she's got a divot between her boobs. There's nothing natural looking about those things at all. All she is is one big set of boobs on top of some little skinny body. On top of an alien body. Alien face, we should say. Yeah, I know. Well, anyway, the other one's not so bad either. All right, thank you. Bye-bye. You think Tori Spelling's hot in? Oh, no. Not at all. And it just got worse as time went on. And the boobs don't help. It's like the worst boob job. They're all stretched out. And like I said, her breast bone, where it sticks out, there's a big divot there. I know, I know. Like they put too much in. I'm sure her career will flourish after this. Hey, Wendy's going to stick up for Gary. Wendy. Wendy. Hey. Wendy. Oh, her name must not be Wendy. She didn't answer to it. All right, Danny, what's going on? What's up? I think Gary has a Hitler mustache. What is he, gay? He's making a rear end? Hey, what's your problem? I was. How do you know about that? You're gay, asshole. How do you know about that? All right, Danny, thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. Spit or swallow, Gary? Spit or swallow? Little thing. I can't believe you're sitting here and taking this. It's just going to get worse, you know. Mike, what's up? Hey, how are you? Good. I just got a question for Gary. I wanted to know if he's on the same cycle as girlfriend is. Same period. What brand do you use, by the way? You're killing me. All right, Mike, thank you. This is the best one from the Instant Feedback. Steve from the City. Gary is like in charge of the whole sales force pretty much here at WNEW. Steve writes, how can Gary sell airtime if he can't even sell watching the Knicks game? Oh, you can't even convince your girlfriend to watch the Knicks game. How do you convince people to buy this show? Bravo to Steve. Light of the day. Did he promise him he would do the dishes for you? Go buy your parts. All right, let's go to JD real fast. JD. JD. Yeah, a little bit of advice for Gary. You can swim in the Red River but never drink from it. Oh, boy. You're just getting nasty. TJ. Yo. Hey. Owen, hey, what's up? Hey, I've been watching 90210 for the whole 10 years it was on. Okay. All right. You had to watch it last night because it's the end of an era. Sure. You had to watch the last one. Yeah, it was lousy though, right? Yeah, it wasn't that great but, you know, it's the last time you're ever going to see it. Did your boyfriend like it? He loved it. Yeah? Actually, my wife liked it. She was crying on the couch. What's his name? Michelle. Michael? I don't think I... Come on, you guys are great. You had to watch the show. All right, TJ, thank you. All right, guys. Bye. Later. I don't think a lot of who cares about watching 90210. Like you said, I thought it was off the air already. I don't even think I ever sat through one episode of that show in the 10 years it was on. Gary, when you were... You were, you know, doing it under a blanket. Wacking. Wacking. Yes. Gary, when you exfoliate, do you use a loofah or just a washcloth? A loofah, yes. Yeah, okay. Do you wear his and her shirts? Her and her shirts. Her and her shirts. Jesus. What douche does Gary like? I'm a fag like Gary. Okay, let's go to Dennis. Dennis, what's going on? You're next on NEW. There you go. I must be just as gay as him because I've been watching a trope of five years straight now. You have. I'm straight. Is that your own opinion of yourself? No, I'm just straight. We're thinking... But why? I just... Because I moved to an apartment. I didn't have cable anymore. I had to watch basic cable and get into the show. That's it. I don't know if that's a good enough excuse, pal. I found myself needing a beer. I was in the village. I went to a bar. And next thing I know, I was getting into a keister. I was also miserable and party-fired. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. I was in a bar. There's a real bang up show I would want to tune into. The guy's got Hodgkins. How did you watch that one? Did you watch Party of Five, Gary? Oh my God. You're a big softy. Gary, you going to be turning in the WNBA next week? All right, Dennis, thank you. Hey, but you know what? I'd rather watch Soap Bobbers than the Knicks game last night. Well, the Knicks are a soap opera. Ba dum bum. You guys take care. All right, man. Bye. Just wait until I get you on the basketball court. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. John wants to know if you're a pitcher or a catcher. There's a bunch of guys that did see 902.1 last night. Dan, what's up? Yeah, I actually watched 902.1 last night. You did? I did. But with the celebration. Oh, yeah? The celebration was that I never have to watch that stupid show, Party of Five, or what's that other stupid one, Melrose Place, ever again. Did it get ridiculous? Like, I didn't even watch it. I'd never watched it. But didn't 902.1.0 start when they were supposed to be in school? So now, like, years and years later, how ridiculous was it that they still had no lives? Was that the fact? Because I don't even know what the storyline was. But how could you? Like, even Saved by the Bell had to go off the air when they left school. You know, they started high school. Oh, is it, Gary? I wouldn't know. I don't watch Saved by the Bell. Is Saved by the Bell really still on? Yes, it is. I love Screech. Do they have a whole new cast or something? They have a new Saved by the Bell. Oh, I don't know. I love it. Great show. There you go, but I'll have to watch it. All right, Dana. All right, thank you. Zena, Warrior Princess. Well, now we're starting to get on the same level. Zena's got that pull to watch. There are some girls on that show that are dressed in pretty much nothing. Kim, what's going on? Not much. You're going to defend Gary? I was going to, but then he started talking about Party of Five. Why? What's the matter? That's a little too far for me. Oh, you wouldn't even watch that, and you have a vagina. See? Most definitely. Most definitely. I started watching it years ago. What do you call it to Gary? You have a lot in common. No testicles. This is true. This is very true. But in college, it was fun. You drink to it. You go away from it for a little while. I came back to watch the last season of CDN. I don't understand how you girls talk us into watching these girlie shows. Well, my husband actually wanted to watch it too. He doesn't have the balls to tell you he doesn't. Well... Because I've got to admit, when I used to have to go home after the show, when I had a home, remember that, Opie? I remember that. I used to drive out to Long Island when I had a home. You used to live very close to me, man. Yeah. We used to commute together. It was very nice. I used to get home, and I don't even know what night it was, but that goddamn party of five was on. That friggin' party of five was on. And I'm like, why would you sit and watch a show where the guy has got Hodgkin's? You got your own problems that you've got to sit around and watch a crap show like that? And then, Wendy, love you. It's cancer beyond the screen. I'd forget everything for two seconds. Oh, man. You guys are brutal. Adam from Manhattan. Where you crush when Felicity cut her hair. Rob from Sederage. Does Gary buy teen beat at 17 so he can pin up posters of Dillard? Gary, Backstreet Boys are in sync. Who do you like better? You actually... Ah, Ken. You actually have an opinion on that? Yeah. Ken, how are you? I can justify watching 90210. Yeah, you can. That's it. Three years ago, my wife made a deal with me. I'd get a Hummer and I'd sat down and watch the show. So I've been a faithful viewer for three years. Well, how many Hummers did you get? The one? I could read a magazine during the show. I just had to sit in a room and pretend I was watching. But you only got one Hummer and then had to watch the show for three and a half years? Oh, every show. Every time I came on. Oh, every show. I think I can understand that. So I've been a faithful viewer for three years. All right. Thank you, Ken. Thanks. Chris wants Gary to go for the Whiffleball bat record. I see that. I just got that. Go get the Whiffleball bat in a sharpie. Uh, Gary's penis checking in. Gary's penis. Hi, this is Gary's penis? Yes. I'm just wondering where the hell I am. Did I get lost somewhere? Wait, it's a tag team. Here comes Spaz. That's funny. Thank you, guys. Did you watch Seventh Heaven, Gary? No, you know, I only do beginning and end. What are you going to do? You're going to do aerobics and then what? And then I'm going to go, I've got to go meet my honey. And what are you guys going to do tonight? I don't know. Is there something on TV? I told you, it's popular and charmed. That is a joke. That is a joke. Re-runs of Golden Girls. I just like nothing on them. All right. What's going on? ER's there. What are you doing today? I can sympathize with Gary. I had to watch it last night also. Wasn't something that I wanted to do. It's one of those relationship have to do's. I had to watch it with my new girlfriend, Jane. Yeah, but do you have to bring home tampons? No, that's Wendy, pal. My new girlfriend, Jane. That's Wendy, pal. Well, she used to be your Wendy. She's now my Jane. Good luck. Have fun. Hold on to your stuff. Oh, boy. You know what's so funny? I wonder if he actually thought that would annoy me. I think he was trying to get to a date from Manhattan. Can Gary show us how to give a hummer on a carrot? That goes back to the whole Fast Times of Ridgemont High from earlier. All right. I'm getting out of here. I've been abused enough. You do that. Thank you, Lord. Crazy. Tom's got a question for you before you leave. Tom? Yo. Yeah. Hey, Gary. What happened to the days of our lives today, bro? What did you say? What happened to the days of our lives? Are you serious? I listened to them all day yesterday. I came home. I walked upstairs after working all day with them on TV. I said, are you out of your mind? They changed the channel. I said, get out of the room. I said, get out of the bedroom. That's nice. You've got to sit there. What else do you do to her? What? What else do you do to her? I drive a truck, bro. Yeah. I said, what else do you do to her? Huh? Gary's... Gary's... What do you do to her? I throw out of the room. You throw her out of the room. I need to go to sleep. You throw her out of the room? What? What floor you live on? Like the second or third floor? I can't hear you. This phone's crap, Tom. All right, Tom. Thank you. You got it, bro. Bye. I'm just not good at relationships because I just can't do that. All right. I can't sit in front of a TV and watch something I'm not into. No. No. I'll admit it. I can't do it. You just don't watch. No, you just... I don't know. I understand making sacrifices, but the Nick game was on and I went upstairs. The Nick game wasn't good until the last half hour. How much time do you actually spend together at the house because of TV, like differences in TV? No, most of the times we agree on what to watch, sure. Like, Sandy wanted to see that Jesus movie last night. I ain't sitting through that. Same ending every time. Right. Gary, can we drip some hot wax on you? I want the Quentin Tarantino version of Jesus. Oh, God. That would be a good one. Like you said, the same old ending. Gary, did you get tickets yet for the vagina monologues? She's not in anymore, right? You're brave, Rudy's ex-wife. You're definitely brave. Most people would have left 10, 20 men's ago. Yeah, well, there's nothing wrong with it. How far can Gary shoot a ping pong ball? Gary, hurry up. You're going to miss your nail appointment. Wendy, what's up? Yes, I just want to say something in Gary's defense. Yeah. I'll tell you, Gary, you're playing your cards just right. Your babe wants to watch this stuff, and you watch it with her. And you know what? Whatever you ask for, it's yours. Anal, oral, whatever it is, it's yours. I think Gary knows exactly what he's doing. All right. Is your real name Wendy? It is for the time being. Then we don't want to talk to you anyway. Oh, is that the case? All right, Wendy. Thank you. You're right. Absolutely. Now, if there's something you want to watch, does she sit down there and watch it with you? Absolutely. She lets me watch it for like five or 10 minutes. Oh, my God. I'm getting mad at you. All right, Gary. You've abused me enough. If you want to buy advertising on the Open Anthony Show, who's the guy to talk to? Yeah. Going home for a little butt sex. All right, later. All right, Gary. One, two, three, four. Is that a purse? He's got a bag. Okay. All right, Gary. Bye. Take it easy, Gary. There he goes. Gary, being a good sport today, I wonder what he's going to watch. That's pretty funny. All right, Anthony. Oh, let's take a break. Do we have anything else to give away? Sure. Let's give some away because that's all Gary abuse. WWF awards. Let's do more WWF tickets.

Gary, there are two things a man should learn about watching homo shows. One, do not talk about watching homo shows. Two, do not talk about watching homo shows. Very good. EarthLink, we were talking about there? We were talking about there? I wasn't paying attention. I was reading the stuff. Yeah, EarthLink, 1-800-EARTHLINK. The OP and Anthony Show. Let me let you ladies in on something. Oral never gets old. Home of the Hummer. 1027-WNEW. Anthony, we've got four guys outside. We've got to let them in and say hi here. Yeah. They've got a few signs on TV today. Dan, Jason, Josh and Anthony. Wow, there's the famous sign installed on MTV today. There it is. Outside TRL. What's your name in the red hat? I'm Josh. Hey, guys. Hey, Josh. Josh is holding the sign that was on MTV today. It says, Precious Loves Britney. Psychopaths all the way. Psycho-monk all the way. You like Psycho-monk? You like Psycho-monk? You're the Psycho-monk guy. Psycho-monk, yeah, he's out of his mind. Very good. And who's the other guy with the sign? I'm Dan. I'm Anthony. Hey, man. I called this morning. I was the guy this morning. Dan, the sign guy. They said, bring the sign. It says, Who is Hain? And I brought it in for the guys and I made the wall sign with Precious on it. What does that one say? This one says, Who is Hain? That's what the morning, Chris. It said in the morning, Chris said to go on the F. So I said, all right, guys. What, are they telling people to go to TRL? No, they saw me there with the Britney one. Britney Spears was there because I had my sign and I made a... Wait, wait, I'm hearing rumors that the... I'm a little confused. The new morning guy Scott and Sid who, they're sounding good, by the way, are starting to tell people to hang out MTV and TRL with signs. We might have a little problem here. We're trying to... We don't want to sound like that. We're trying to be cool with all the new shows and stuff. We could have a little problem here. It's a little weird. Yeah, we're... A little weird. A bunch of people did call about that, but now we got proof that the guy's in here with the sign for the new morning show. All right, the wow guys get prizes, but you don't get anything for that song. No, you should have seen it. We were at Monday Night Raw, we get the wow shirts on, we would run around. We had the whole thing, we had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. We had the whole thing. Hold it up, sign. They took our ID and they said they were going to arrest us if we didn't leave. So we... And the cops are around the man. They're totally creative and they're going to pressure us. First of all, the whole thing with MTV, they gather up a bunch of people with signs and then they tape them. What, if the sign isn't acceptable to MTV that they're going to have them arrested? Screw you. Wait for the A-bomb. Yeah, wait. Yeah, they don't want the A-bomb. That's what happened at WWF. I had my wow sign. I said I was making too much of a scene. I was causing too much of a ruckus. I said causing too much of a scene of a wrestling event. I didn't want to throw you out. I didn't understand it. That's what frustrates the news crews and MTV and everyone else because this is legal. You're allowed to put a sign on TV as long as it doesn't say F. One great thing about WWF, I went over there yesterday with my wow sign, which the girl called from Florida about. I was the one on the TRL. I went over there with the wow sign and they had Stephanie McMahon, Kane, Mankind, and I was the one on the TRL. I was the one on the TRL. I was the one on the TRL. I was the one on the TRL. I was the one on the TRL. They were all really great with the sign. They were really cool. This is during a press conference. They let us come down and go to wow. Yeah, that was at the restaurant, right? Yeah, they were really cool. I was the one on the TRL. I went over there with the wow sign and they had Stephanie McMahon, Kane, Mankind, and a couple others. They all signed mine right away. I'm at that. Stephanie McMahon, she's walking by. I was like, come on, it's time. You're going to get on the radio show like on Friday. Yeah, Stephanie McMahon is going to be on tomorrow. They were all really great with the sign. They were really cool. And this is during a press conference. They let us come down and go to wow. Yeah, that was at the restaurant, right? Let's make sure everyone understands. You're allowed to put signs on live TV. Absolutely. I think they would have a problem if you were cursing yourself. I don't even think that's against the law. I don't even think that's against the law. The reason they got pissed with me was, you know how they do the street interviews and they, you know, what song you want to hear. I jumped in front of the camera and I screamed wow as loud as I can right in front of the camera. Do you know how many people called with that today? That happened on MTV today. You guys are going to say that. There's like this lunatic jumping in front of, who's down there, Fat Dave? No, Fat Dave. You know, it would be fine if it was just some jerk off going, oh, Britney, Britney, Backstreet Boys. They know that ONA will upstage MTV any day. There was a whole bunch of little twerps in there and he was talking behind the cops. He's like, grab these guys and the cops like that they didn't do anything. No, the cops can't arrest you for that. And most of the cops are on our side anyway. They have a job to do but they turn their backs and start laughing. I think it's hilarious. They love it. Yeah, that red lobster thing that pulled up, they put that right in front of the wow sign for me. They had the whole truck back up so I could get on TV. See? There was one guy up there telling, you know, giving us the thumbs up, the thumb down, telling us to get away, move away, the guys were coming. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. I was just one of the guys. Yeah, the atom bomb. Rolling out onto the tarmac. Oh look, it's Foxcar falling along. Alright, we got Andy from the NYPD. Info on signs at events. Andy, what's up? Yeah, listen, this sign, it's within the First Amendment. You can put up signs. Sure, yeah. We hear you. Yeah, okay, no, a little traffic on the verizono. Basically, as long as it's not offensive, it's within the First Amendment. Okay, it's freedom of speech. And they're not obstructing. If the signs are offensive and it caused a riot, then they would have a problem. They can put them up. They're not obstructing. They're not blocking anybody. They're not inciting a riot. Yeah, we already knew that. But that's why everyone gets so pissed off, because there's nothing they can do about it. Yeah. They can threaten our listeners and stuff, but there's nothing they can do about it. Yeah, we're not going to do anything about it. Well, thank you, Andy. Yeah, you guys still rock. Alright, man. Indication out, boys. Yeah, we're trying. Hey, listen. Yeah. I got a new name for Spass. Huh? Scrum and bitch. You guys rock. Take care. Alright, Andy, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. The qualified secretary. So we're going to hook you guys up with prizes for helping us out. You guys rock. You guys are awesome. Thank you, man. Thank you. Thank you very much. You guys are sitting in my car fun all day. Cool. You guys want to give out some plugs real fast? One at a time here? Charles, you want to say hi to anyone? Any pals, something? No, I just want to thank WWF. I mean, like, they're the best. They're the best. Alright, thank you, dude. How's it going, everybody? Adam, what's going on? Micah, Mom, Dad, how's everyone doing? Hey.

It was D-Z-Z-S-U-X. It was D-Z-Z-S-U-X. It was the license plate? It said it was a New York license plate that says Spaz sucks. Now that's funny. Yeah. All right. That's cool to tell you guys. Thank you, Mark. Thanks a lot. If that guy's listening, send in a picture of that. We need to see a picture of that. All right, Anthony, we got to go to break here. Yeah. We got a bit from the ONA archives here. It was reported in the paper today that Sylvester Stallone. Yeah. Plans to do. Right. Yeah. We're going to go to break here. Yeah. We're going to go to break here. Yeah. We're going to go to break here. We're going to go to break here. We're going to go to break here. Sylvester Stallone. Yeah. Plans to do Rocky VI. Rocky VI. Tipping into that, is he? That old gag. Oh. How old is Rocky? How old is he? He's 50, 51. Maybe even 52 at this point. He can't fight? He can't box? What is that? Rocky VI. Rocky VI. You can smile a little bit. After two, it was done, right? Did you like Rocky III even, Anthony? Three was just clever. Three was clever. That was good. Hey woman. Is that you, woman? Once you come over, I'll show you a real man. That was a good one, but then it got ridiculous. You're right. I must break you. Dolph Lundgren. That sucked. Then the other one with the guy with the AIDS. Isn't Dolph Lundgren supposed to be the next action hero? What happened? Didn't quite work out for him. Didn't quite pan out for him, huh? I'm trying to think of what this will be. Is he going to fight or is he going to be like take a young boxer under his wing or something? No, he already did take the boxer under his wing. Tommy Morrison. That was Rocky V, right? With his son and all that? Rocky VI. I come out with a little rascal. Oh my God. Mickey's dead. Oh Mickey's dead. Someone changed my Depend undergarment. Changed my Depend undergarment. Come down in the Depend instead of the boxing trunks. I'm the champ. I don't know. Yeah, I don't think that way. I'm the champ. I'm the champ. Paulie, change my underwear. I don't think it will gross like the first one. I don't think it will do that well. Come on. I would never go see Rocky VI. Not in the theater anyway. Who the hell knows? It was on HBO2 late at night. You might check it out. Maybe. Maybe it's going to do the whole Muhammad Ali thing. Didn't he do that too? Or he was already getting all punchy. Have me tired of you. Have me tired of you. But how can we tell Rocky? Me. Me. Ah, let's go to Ray. Ray, what's up? Yo, what are you talking about? Rocky II is one of the best Rockies. Hulk Hogan, the ultimate male versus the ultimate meatball? That was pretty good. You're 100% right. I got confused with two. I'll be honest. But you know what? Rocky II, you tell me like every time you see it, no matter what, that last ten seconds they're both on the floor. You're screaming one Rocky to get up there. I liked one, two and three. Right. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I mean four was cheesy at the end with like Sylvester Stallone talking about all the, you know, I don't know. Yeah, four kind of did blow. How many times can you do it? Okay, Rocky gets another shot. Oh, he loses confidence in himself. He can't do it. But Adrian gives him the frigging go ahead and he goes and kicks it. I can't do it. I can't do it. Rocky, you can do it. Oh, okay. I can do it. And Paulie's going to be like his son's going to become a boxer now or something. Yeah. Paulie's going to be drunk and screw something up. Rocky's going to have to defend him and his honor and maybe it is his son. You think it'll be like Rocky's son will be the boxer? Yeah. I can't picture it. They already did Tommy Gunn. I mean, what else could they do? Yeah. Who could forget the great music that came out of this Rocky film? This is Rocky III, Eye of the Tiger. Go for it. Eye of the Tiger Rock. I can't do it. I can't do it. Keep me left out. Not jab one more, go to the body. Eye of the Tiger. Eye of the Tiger. All right. All right. They got him dancing to the music. Remember that? Yeah, I do. He's like jumping back and forth. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to do this. This damn song saved Survivor's career. Survivor? Survivor was done. Rocky VI, the Rocky lean mean fat burning grilling machine. It's good. Look at him. He burns your fat right out of you. Yeah. Rock. Maybe he'll be fighting Adrian in Rocky VI. That's a good one. He's just a... Give her a punch in the face. He's just a drug-fitter, ex-boxer. That would be a good one. We didn't want to do that though. It'll probably be a son. Or he opens up like a boxing school and there's the next hard-headed Italian guy that wants to fight. They kind of did all that in V though. I mean, the boxer, Tommy Morrison. Yeah. Taking him under his wing and the son getting involved. Stefano, what's up? Yeah, what's up guys? Yeah, I know. Supposedly, from what I heard, too, they could be training their son. They showed up on 7th and Rocky V. Where it's almost training. The son could be like a tiny, tiny junior or something. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Yeah. Well, that's the bit we want to play for the O&R, guys. Thank you, Stefano. All right. No problem, guys. Very good. Oh, I'm sorry about that. Let's go to Matt. Matt, real fast. Hey, what's up? Hey, what are you going to do? I have a balloon knot next. I'm going to throw a balloon knot next. Yeah. You did that. I'm going to throw a balloon knot next. I'm going to throw a balloon knot next. You did that. I'm going to throw a balloon knot next. I'm going to throw a balloon knot next. Hey, real fast. Tell Fredo to suck it up. He did fine today. All right, man. We're all on the same page now. I hear you. Again. Rock on, bro. Thank you, Matt. Tell you, Shire. Jeez. How old is she now? Tell. Someone is saying that Rocky is going to come out of retirement for this movie. Is that the chunk? Are you just saying that or what? O&A, I read it on the web. I go to a movie site all the time. And that's what they said. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. He's going to come out for it. Hey, that blew too though. No, I liked it. I liked that. And I liked him in it. There's a lot of good actors, but... There's a lot of good actors and you're like, there's no way he fits in with this cast, but he did I think. Yeah, I don't know. All right. Oh, look at Pete saying he dies. Thank you, John. Hey, real quick. I appear every weekend at the 17 on the Turnpike. I always got my wow sticker up and no, yeah, right, unplugging. And then I'm going to be with Dice that laughs your balls off. All right, thank you. My God, peace. Thank you, John. Rocky dies. Rocky dies. Come on. Rocky IV set up Rocky VI. Let's see. Fred, what's up? Yo, ever since Rocky IV, like before Rocky IV came out, everybody would say, no, his son's going to be a boxer. His son's going to be a boxer. It's not going to happen. Everybody's been saying that for the longest time. Why? Of course, every time another Rocky came out after III, everybody thought it was going to be his son. He's going to train his son to be a boxer. Yeah, but now he's like in his 50s. He can't fight. I know, but they're going to do something stupid, but there's no way they're going to make his son the boxer. Everybody's been expecting it. That would be stupid. It would be the worst movie ever. Well, yeah, it's going to blow. It's definitely going to blow. I'm also working on Stop or My Mom Will Shoot II. I think that has a better chance of getting some people in his seat. I have the age spots. I have the liver spots. Dave from Jersey, Rocky VI. Sean Connery wrote it. Rocky comes home to his cheating wife. He throws the babysitter out and beats his wife with a sit and spin. Yes, she's playing with the children on a sit and spin. They make up in the end. The babysitter. Sean from Jersey, Rocky IV was Spaz's favorite. The big white guy kills the black guy. And Ron's saying on line nine Rocky fights Muhammad Ali in Rocky VI. Yeah, pretty much. There is a Rocky movie flub. We like film flubs. Tom, what's up? Hey, how are you? Hey. What's up, man? It's Rocky and Paolo. Hey, how about Rocky against Hock, Joe Morton, man? Fight Bob Barker. That's what it's going to look like. I'm telling you. If Rocky fights. Do you remember when Paolo died? Yeah, Paolo Creed. And they gave him the red, white, and blue shorts? Yeah. And Rocky's thinking back about how he fought Trouble Wang. Yeah. And in one or two of those scenes he wore both. After one or two of them he had red, white, and blue shorts on. Yeah, he had the shorts before Paolo gave them to him. Yeah. I want to make sure you pick it up because I know you're good on that. I remember that film flub, yeah. Tell me about that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. I remember that.

Top 10 sports films of all time according to USA. 10th place, Raging Bull. 9th place, Anthony, Slapshot. That should have been higher on the list. Raging Bull should have been higher on the list, I think. 8th place, Chariots of Fire. 7th place, Caddyshack. Top 10 sports films of all time according to USA. Number 6, Brian's Song. Who could sit through that? Number 5, Bull Dorm. Number 4, Rocky. Ant thought Rocky should be number 1. Hey, I heard you. I got a glass table. Why don't you squat over it and take a dump? I'll be underneath it and you can grab on it. Mickey, grab on me, Mickey! Yeah! Wasn't that written somewhere on some horse book? We interviewed the horse from that book. And they claim, according to their book, that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it. But you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know? And like watching this f***er open up and just dump it on me. I'll grab on your face! I'll grab on your face, Mickey! Oh! Come on, baby. Why don't you open it up and give me one over the glass table? Oh, yeah, baby. That's how I like you, sloppy. I didn't start this. You started this. Yeah, good stuff. Oh, look at that. There's some corn in there. That's what I see. Oh, look, I see some peanuts. Mickey! She had peanuts, Mickey! You know, when a girl squads over a table like that, you're hoping it's a nice, sloppy dump. You know, you don't want anything to get past you, girl. Yeah, baby. Oh, that's a new driver. Oh, my God! You know, I don't know where Adrian went. Adrian must have left the building. But, hey, Paulie! Paulie, get over here and squat on the table, Paulie. Paulie, squat on the table! Oh, Paulie! Give it to me, Paulie! Big fat ass, Paulie! Hey, Paulie, where you going? Now we're going to squat over the table. That'll do it. Hey, Mickey! Hey, Mickey, come on over here and squat on the table, Mickey. Oh, Mickey! Oh, no, look, it's first blood! Mickey, you drew first blood! Not me! I just started! You started! Mickey! Mickey, grab on! Table, Mickey! Now he's going to grab now! Oh, good. Okay, where's my check? Oh, whatever. Virgin. Scudzo! Grab on me, Scudzo! That's wonderful. Okay, terrific. Okay. Hey! Okay. Hey, good job, boys. How about as funny as a sinking school bus? I have a strong stomach. You guys made me bloat chucks. Great! The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. Oh, and my two new favorite horns. You guys are really horrible. Oh, be out of them for me. What a couple of ass-whites. 1027. WNEW. Anthony Paizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. We love it. We're there all the time. Yes. I haven't been there in a little while. Ever since he's put the Anthony Fried Ravioli in the appetizer section. I haven't gone down to see that in the menu. Live. Or maybe the Opie... What did you get? The eggplant parmesan. Yeah, you don't pay attention, man. I'm sorry, I keep thinking it's the veal parmesan. No. That's what they should have gotten given me. Anthony veal parmesan. I guess we've talked about it in the past. Yeah. I love going out to eat with you when you order the veal. Well, some people are a little touchy about veal. And you like to... I want the veal. You like to order it nice and loud. And even though the waitress is working for this restaurant, she's still pissed off at your original. It is so funny. Every single line, man. Who cares? Anyway, Paizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. Yeah, great atmosphere. Good place to take the family or a date. Great food, huge portions. You get it all at Paizano. And if you ask Joey, the owner, you just say, Hey, Joey, Opie and Anthony sent me to give you a glass of wine on the house. There you go. Paizano of Mulberry Street, the heart of Little Italy. 136 Mulberry. Give them a call. 965-1188. That's 965-1188. They're open seven days a week, weekends till 2... 2? Ponderous. F'ing ponderous. And of course... That's a good thing. Yeah. If you're in the area during lunch, huge pasta lunch specials. I love the people. We get there early, usually 8 o'clock, let's say, and we stay for four hours. And people coming in at midnight to eat. I know. It's amazing. It really is. All right, it's Paizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. Hey, kids. It's your old pal Krusty. And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy, I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show. Syndication now. 2127571027. Oh, man. Is it like storming out now? Yeah. Ah. Is it? I'm looking forward to hitting the pack. Do some blading. I don't know about that. I wrecked my blades last year. Could be nasty. Ah. Farmer, man. It was nice all day. Now when the storm hits... Let's see what the weather looks like here. Uh, thunderstorms. Look out the window. It's dark as night. I'm going to the Doppler radar here. Yes, yes. It does look like some red moving in. With some green and yellow. All right. Let's go to the phones, Anthony. All right. It's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony show. What did we learn? Eli. Hi, guys. What's up, man? I learned on the show today that movie trivia is Opie and Anthony's Van Halen song when they run out of material. Ha ha ha ha ha. Run out? We did it at the beginning of the show. We didn't run out. We didn't run out. We just never had any. We ran out of gas early. No, we didn't run out of gas early, but you got us, Eli. We didn't have much planned today and we went to the trivia thing. Yeah, it was dangerously close to wacky morning show territory. No, it was fun. We could do that every once in a while, right? I also learned that Anthony needs to work on his Sean Connery. Why? Sounds suspiciously like a modified Charles Caroll to me. No, I thought... Oh, yeah, yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah. Man, you're real picky today, Eli. Hey, hey. Someone's got to do it. I want to keep you guys, you know, on guard. Go back to listening to the fan. There's a famous Eli that calls in all the time on the fan. Not me. Didn't they even give him his own show for a while or something? I don't know. Thank you, Eli. Hey, guys. Take care. All right. Bye, bye. Bye. Very picky. I don't like my impression. God, you tried to do this every day for four and a half hours, man. Oh, geez. We thought we had a good show. Oh, no. Uncle John, what's going on? Hey, guys. How are you doing tonight? Great. I learned two things. I learned that dead fish wear wow stickers. Yeah. And also I learned that Gary from your sales force has a yeast infection. Anyway, Anthony. Yeah. Litigation now. Yeah. It is. Litigation now. Uncle John checks in every day. Dave, what's up? Yeah, I learned today that you guys are the kings of the Fast Times, the Reef, My High trivia. Well, we did pretty well with that today. Yeah, you did. I think the next one we're going to do, I mean, don't worry. We're not going to do this every day. But I think we're going to do it every day. Yeah. I think we're going to do it every day. Yeah. I think we're going to do it every day. Yeah. We're not going to do this every day. But I think the next movie we take on is Caddyshack. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, that'll be a couple weeks down the road. Okay, guys. Indication when a pot is legal. Okay. Bye. Let's go to Paulie. Hey, Paulie. Hey, Precious. What's up, Wrangler? Hey. Sorry, I learned that if you speak with an Irish accent, you're a lot of curse on the radio. Did you wear that or what? Exactly. Yeah, that's good, Paulie. Thank you. All right, guys. Indication when Statt finishes his commute. All right, bye. I'm telling you, they picked up on that. It's funny. Jonathan. Yeah, I learned that not only do steroids make you destroy pathogens, but they make you dumb. Wow. All right, Jonathan. Let's go to the instant feedback. A lot of good ones coming in today. Don from Staten Island. I learned that cashmere has nothing to do with side two of Led Zeppelin 4. That always bothered me, Joe. Joe from Bridgeport, Connecticut. I learned that Opie and Anthony's Doppler radar consists of an open window. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It does look like thunderstorms moving in. Of course. They've been talking about it all day, hail and all that crap. But usually it's like, you know, you get the alert. You ever go on the Weather Channel? It is a weather update from the area of northwestern New Jersey, northern and central Connecticut. It's like never the city. But it looks like it's kind of coming this way. It is coming this way. Alex from Brooklyn. I learned that Opie likes to watch porno while a dentist is in his mouth. Thank you. That's pretty bad. Let's see. Okay. Buttnut. Always checking in. What I learned today, the name of the dog is Gypsy. Very good. Yankee Bleacher Creature. He checks in all the time, too. Today I learned Marco has a new map of Hawaii, Partner and Gary. Syndication when 90210 runs a new episode. Joseph Prano from FoundryMusic.com. Today I learned Sean Connery and Mayor Giuliani go to the same speech therapist. I'll smack you. It could be worse than smacking her in the head. We'll leave you. Billy Hayes. What's up, O&A? One of Jay Moore's friends there. How are you doing today? I learned that Rick's loyalty to Jay Moore are as strong as mine. It looks that way. You got that right, Fredo. All right, syndication over here now, fellas. All right, bro. Bye. Bye. Over here now. Dave, what did you learn on the show today? Yeah, I learned that this loyalty to the show, you could wind up with a fish in your car. Very good. Over and out there, precious. All right, blind Dave. Bye. Bye. I'm talking about precious. Dan from Stanford. That sucks. I'm never going to live that one down. Today I learned how to get a police escort if I ever get pulled over for speeding. Yeah, we did learn that today. Today I learned Gary's girlfriend's menstrual cycle. Yes, we did learn that today. I learned Gary's going to replace Stacker 2 and WWF commercials with Mydol and Lilith Fair spots. Brian from Jersey. I learned Gary can take abuse better than Nicky from We Deliver Keggers. Mike from Staten Island. I learned that Uncle John has no effing life. Dan from Jersey. I learned that Eli should go back to his cotton gin. God, now people are abusing listeners. That's great. I learned today on the show that Mike Tyson should be knighted. Syndication, okay, pathetic. That's from Jeff from Jersey. Yeah. Let's go to Eric. Eric, what did you learn on the show today? I learned that there's Anthony separation. There's a lot more girls named Wendy. Yeah, I imagine that. Imagine that. I picked up on that very, yes. See you later, Dreamweaver. Bye. That's you, Anthony. No, well, Dreamweaver wasn't me. I was the Wrangler. You were Diamond Dust. It's associated with you. I say. Lewis, what did you learn on the show today? Hey, dudes, I learned a whole bunch of stuff. Firstly, I learned that Rocky 6, in Rocky 6, Rocky will be fighting his giant enlarged prostate. I also learned that if you fail at everything you've ever done in school, but you can remember inane, insignificant movie trivia, you still can be a success in New York radio. Very good. And most importantly of all, I learned that Fez is still the dumbest ass in all of radio. Yeah. I heard the guy pick up the phone when I called in once, and he got half of WNEW out before he dropped the phone or hit the button and clicked off the line. The dumb ass couldn't pick up a phone if you gave him a third arm. Poor Fez. He wasn't even on the show today or yesterday. Do you guys still abuse him? Oh my God. He deserves to be abused. He's an abortion that didn't make it. All right, Lewis, thank you. Take care. Good job. Hey, where's Fez? Fez is doing his weekend review this week. Why is he pissed? Why are you pissed? What's the matter? There's nothing good for the show. That's why I hang up on the pricks. Whoa. Why? You recognize that voice? No, I'm just tired of getting abused. I get abused by these callers all the time now. There's nothing good for the show. That's why I hang up on you. Get the message. Fez, can I tell you something? You truly are stupid. And I'll tell you why. Oh, Jesus. No, and I'll tell you why. You rant and rave like that. Now they're going to come out of the woodwork. That's the only cause you're going to get now. Soon as they know they got you, they're going to hit you twice as hard. You should have did the famous opi line. That doesn't bother me. That doesn't bother me. That doesn't bother me. That doesn't bother me. There's nothing good for the show. Soon as you come in here and rant and rave, now they're going to pound you. I'll just hang up on them. They're going to pound you. Now, are you doing the weekend review? Yes, I am. It's not going to be racist, right? If it's racist, it doesn't have to be. It's not going to be racist at all. Because two weeks ago, it was just out of hand. I was a little over the top. It's not going to be racist this week. What are some of the subjects that you're catching on? I haven't written down somewhere. I don't remember off the top of my head. I like to keep it, you know, suspense. Oh, yeah, suspense. So tomorrow we've got Spaz's Weekend Review. We've got Stephanie from the WWF. We've got Stephanie McMahon calling in. And Monday, some special ed teacher is going to give you a special test. What is it supposed to test about me? Your intelligence. I'll pass it easy. You know what? I think you will, too. That's the scary part. Because it's the common sense thing you have a problem with. I think deep down, you're book smart. What? Dude, book smart? Yeah. How do you define book smart? What would be like? Spaz is like Rain Man. Spaz? I think Spaz will do well with a test. I think when it comes to discussing issues that affect all of us, talking about the mayor and this and that, he's a complete retard. But when it comes to like just flat out facts and stuff that is written down in a test, I think he'll do real well. I'm willing to bet you. Really? Yeah. I think he's Rain Man. He'll drop anything on the floor. He'll be picking it up. He'll tell you exactly what's on it, where it goes and everything like that. But as soon as you ask him what's going on. I mean if they're common sense questions, no way. Absolutely no way. Probably just intelligence questions. You know, if a train from Chicago, blah, blah, blah. Can you answer those type of questions? Those are simple. I don't know. Those are simple? Who's on the train? A train leaves Chicago going like 90 miles an hour. Okay, a train leaves LA heading east going 50 miles an hour. Okay. A train leaves New York going west. It is going 20 miles an hour. As they pass each other, which train is closer to New York? As they pass each other? Yeah. They're both at the same distance because they pass each other. Very funny. He got it. I'm telling you. Trick question. I'm telling you. I think he would do well. I think we're all going to be disappointed at the results of the test. Who's Barry in Grant's tomb? Grant. What color was George Washington's white horse? I know. All right, Spaz. We'll see you tomorrow, all right? There you go, Spaz, everyone. Scott, what did you learn on the show today? I learned that precious love is Britney Spears. That's right. Hey, I got a question you can ask Spaz. Yeah. Ask him how many pounds of potatoes it takes to make potato chips. Later. All right, man. Let's go to Wolf. Hey, Wolf, what did you learn on the show today? I learned that the Wild Sticker actually works. Of course it works. Yeah, I had my first Wild experience. Nice. You went today? Yeah, that was incredible. Congratulations. Where were you? I was in Northport. Oh, really? Yeah, up in the work truck heading home. Nice. Out on the island. You guys are gods, thanks. Hey, thank you, man. Bye. All right, let's go to Matt. Is it true Spaz has a gig tonight? Yeah. Matt, what's up? I learned that after 90210, Gary's girlfriend said, look what I did to you again. Indication, what are we going to do about this? All right, Matt. Very good. Hey, he's a funny kid, man. Come on. We've got two good lines out today. Spaz will be appearing at Privilege tonight. I'm going to be dancing. Now, Spaz is at Privilege. I think he was there last night, wasn't he? He had a go. I hate to talk to him so much. He said it went well. Yeah? But we don't know what well means. Were some of the people ragging him or anything along there? I have no idea. Maybe we can hit on that tomorrow. Spaz coming in here now. Spaz at Privilege. There, you can see. So you did Privilege last night? Yes, I did. Had a go? Look at the smile. You did very well. Yeah? What did you do? I went up on stage. I loved the OMA show. I got ragged a little bit. That's the tab. I introduced the main attraction of the show. Yeah. And she was? And she was the same girl that was here yesterday. How did you do it? Give me the whole line and the enthusiasm and everything. Let's see if I can remember word for word. I said, what's up? How's it going everybody? I'm Spaz from the Open Anthony Show. Boo! Boo! Tool! I'm the guy that hangs up on each and every one of you. Whether the fans like me or not, I know you're going to love the main attraction tonight. Oh, corny. And then I was getting lots of things. Waxing or effing bad. I hope they're paying you well for this, guys. Woo! Woo! Yeah, all right. Give it up again. Go ahead. Woo! What's up, everybody? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Now, what's up, everybody? I'm Spaz from the Open Anthony Show. I'm the guy that hangs up on each and every one of you. Whether the fans like me or not, I know you're going to love the main attraction tonight. Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Be quiet, huh? Yeah, exactly. All right. We're going to bring her up. Thank you, Spaz. Whether you like it or not, you're going to love this act. See the way I tied it in? All right, Spaz. Thank you. If you think I'm an a-hole, wait until this dance of Ben's over. See the way I tied it in? All right. I'm quite a jerk off. But after seeing this beautiful girl, you're going to want... We got to get out of here. Yeah. Don and Mike from New York next, Anthony. Yes. They just completed their show in the other studio, and now you get to hear the whole thing. Yeah. In a few minutes here. We'll see you guys tomorrow for FU Friday. Stephanie McMahon checking in, and of course, Spaz's Week in Review. See you tomorrow.
