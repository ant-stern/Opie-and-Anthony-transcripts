 Booze, the world's universal language. I use my breasts to get other people's attention. Rumble out, Wednesday! Opie and Anne Rae, the brain is in their pants. 102778, your boy. Birthday. Yeah, the first time you hear. Whip a Mal Wednesday, Opie. Yes, it is, Anthony. And God has endorsed Whip a Mal Wednesday. The greatest radio promotion ever invented. Oh, we didn't rip off Whip a Mal Wednesday from anyone, Anthony. No. The greatest radio promotion of all time, Whip a Mal Wednesday. What other radio thing you don't have to call in on? You don't have to know anybody at the stage? You don't know anybody at the station? You just put a wow on your car and you're involved. Wow, Whip a Mal Wednesday. I'm seeing a lot of them out there. Sorry, I'm enjoying the helmet. Yes, it's Whip a Mal Wednesday. It was supposed to rain this afternoon, but look at it out there. The Lord endorses Whip a Mal Wednesday. Finally, right, Anthony? Yeah, he's finally given in. We've even worn down Jesus Christ. He said, okay, I give. I give, okay, you're going to do this. Is Jesus Christ seeing a therapist because of our show? God loves boobs. Have you gone to a therapist, Opie? I don't need to go to a therapist. How's the couch? I'm very happy with life. I'm very happy with my career. While other radio stations complain about people doing their stuff, we just continue moving on, doing great radio day after day after day after day. See, I can't agree with you. What? I've got to go the other way on this. What's the problem, Anthony? I understand the pain and hardship that certain people are going through. Maybe we're just the straw that's breaking the camel's back, but I understand when you have a significant other that is... Let's just call her Wendy. Pick a name out of nowhere. Wendy. Wendy. Let's say you have Wendy, right? And you tried to build a career, and Wendy wants half. I understand how maybe you might take it out on other people or other radio shows or whatever it is. You might sit there and lay on the couch when you're having your session with your shrink, and other things might come out because the true thing, the thing that really is getting you, you can't really say or talk about. That might be why other people in this city are upset with us. You know? I understand. I was in court today. See, I got my court clothes on. I see that, Anthony. I got my court hair. I don't think I've ever seen you this well dressed before. I look like a Gap ad. Yeah. Ha! Crazy! Cool! Crazy! Cool! You do have Gap clothes on. I didn't think I'd ever see the day where you'd be wearing... Where am I going? Wallocks? Where am I going to get a suit? You're going to get a suit? The only people who wear suits in court are the ones that are going to be dragged away in cuffs. Take off your hat. I want to see your court hair. Okay. Here we go. Ann's got court hair today. Look at this, Rick. Court hair. Look at the court hair. Look at the court hair. It's all greased down. It's greased back. I look like everybody that was in court today going to jail. But no. Yeah. Anyway, we're in a good mood. But yeah, I got my court clothes, my court hair. And your court butt? The easy access pants I see. Yeah. Court pants. It's got the flap in the back like those... Like those feetie pajamas so you can take a dump. Right. But this is so a big fist can fit right up your hynix. Butty. That's right, Dominic. Keep pounding. What a treat today in court, Hopi. Had a lot of fun, huh? You seem a little drunk, Anthony. Go f yourself, Hopi. Go f yourself, Hopi. I might have stopped on the way for a bud on the way back. I think we all can understand that, though. I think, let's see, the court is at 60 Center Street. I was at 62 Center Street getting a beer. Now, you know, you got it once you get... Yeah, I'm taking off tomorrow. I'm too drunk. What do you do? It's like there's certain things that you do in life that when you're done, you have a beer. Sure. When you lose your job... You have to have a beer. You gotta have a beer. Your chick dumps you, you have a beer. You're going to court. Yeah, you get out, you have a beer. You get great ratings. Well, that's a good thing. You have a beer. You know, there's things you have a beer about that are good. It's a fine line between good and bad when it comes to beer. Knowing you're getting under other air personality skin... Yeah, you have a beer. You have a beer. Right. My God. Oh, look at this. Jesus Christ checking in, Anthony. Jesus is listening. And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breast. Yeah. Let me tell you something. If you guys don't see anything out on the highway, I don't know what else to tell you. We're getting reports of wowings all over the place now. Yeah. It's getting out of hand. Yeah. Get your sticker on or get a wow on or something. Yeah, get a wow on your car before you hit the highways today. There's a ton of ladies that are more than willing to show their boobs if they see the wow sticker on your car, okay? It is Wimpermau Wednesday, for Christ's sake. And if you need a brand new wow sticker, Anthony, we're doing a wow sticker stop today. Where are we? Well, we picked a place nice and close to the station to guarantee that Earl will be there. To guarantee that Earl will be on time. He'll still be late. We're going to be at Ranch 1, Anthony. One of the big, huge sponsors of the Wimpermau Wednesday sticker. Yes. He'll be there at 430, Earl. We're going to be at the Ranch 1 on 8th Avenue and 50th Street, right there on the corner, right? And try the coupon on the back of the sticker to go big. They got a Ranch 1 coupon on the back of the wow stickers that we're giving out today. And 8th Avenue and 50th Street at 430 with Earl. We're looking for a huge crowd to show up there today, okay? Please, yes. Wimpermau Wednesday, the most original radio promotion ever invented. Yes. Ever, ever invented. So huge you'll be on the analyst couch after you put a wow on the back of your vehicle. I would love to know where we ripped this one off from. You ain't going to find it. The original pal came up with this one. Oh my God. Try to figure it out. Try to figure it out. It's not going to happen. It's an O&A original. We killed the mayor of Boston. Don't affle us. It's the greatest, the greatest promotion ever. Ever invented in radio. Let's talk to a radio personality here in New York. Okay. That loves wow but is a little leery of Opie and Anthony. Okay. Hello? What? Sounds a little disturbed. God damn, that's funny. Anyway. I'm in a court of law and I should be listening to these things going on open. That's all right. I missed the whole thing. Hey Anthony, Nicky from We Deliver Keggers is outside the studio. I know, I was accosted on my way into the studio. Yeah. Most times you're greeted by guests. I was accosted. Well, we'll talk to her next, see what she's been up to. We haven't had her on the show in a while. All right. I think Kid Rock is wondering where his hat went. Does this have the Kid Rock hat on? Well, I got to give Nicky credit. I think she had it before Kid Rock. All right, Anthony. Well, let's take our first break. We're just getting started today. Is it true that Greg Brady is going to be in our studio today? Stop it. I didn't know. Wait, come on. Barry Williams stopping by today. Johnny Bravo? Johnny Bravo in the flesh. Finally. And I'm ready to rock. Johnny's back. And ready to rock. Yeah. Yeah, we'll be talking to Johnny Bravo. Let me go on record and say. Did he bring a guitar? I wish he did. I would love to sing along with him with some of the favorite Brady tunes from the Brady Six. Johnny's back. You know, that would be great. That would be cool. He can't sing with the artist. You know what? He can't sing with the artist. The artist. Yeah, you can't start singing with the artist, Anthony. That's a blatant rip-off of another radio show. It's going to take so long to come up with things that other people haven't done in this city. How are we going to do it? Been here two years, ripping everyone off, and now we've got to come up with new stuff? I don't think we're even allowed to crap anymore. We're going to have to figure out a new way to get rid of our fecal matter, I believe. It's been done. How else are we going to get rid of our fecal matter? God. Someone has done that before us, Anthony. Whoever. Maybe we could have like a bag that's just kind of hanging at our side. Yeah. Yeah. We could crap out of our hip. Colostomy bags for everyone. That's been done by the old people. Anyway, Anthony. It is Whip-A-Mill Wednesday, the greatest radio promotion ever invented. You know what this show is like? You know what this show is like? Remember throwing eggs at the old guy's house down the road? Yeah. And he'd get all mad? Yeah. But wasn't it so much fun? Yeah. Of course. I'm not going any further than that. I'm just saying. We used to throw rocks at an old bat. Really? That used to rake her leaves, yeah. And run away. It was so much fun, like you said. It was fun. Until you start really thinking about the person, then you might feel a little bad. Well, you feel bad if they have to go to a therapist or something. Yeah. Then you feel like, no, that's horrible. Absolutely horrible. God damn. Am I getting paybacks tenfold? God damn. And a number of years ago, and it was all funny to make fun of Dominic and stuff. Well, we could get into that next. You want to get into that next a little? Oh my God, was it so much fun? You've got to sit back and think about what you could say and what you can't say about your situation, Anthony. I'll be honest with you. I've got the goddamn thing I want. Well, within reason. Ant, you need a sea breeze? Yeah, please. Get me a sea breeze. I need it. I understand. I just want to say to somebody who's listening, dude, you're a Jack and Coke guy. No, Jack. I never want to smell Jack Daniels again. Captain Morgan and Coke? You're not a sea breeze type of guy. No, not sea breeze. Captain and Coke, man. Sea breeze with a little umbrella and stuff. Captain and Coke are just a bud. All right. Just give me a bottle of bud. All right, Anthony, let's take a break, okay? All right. Greg Brady in studio. What time today? 4.30. All right, and we're going to mess with Nicky from We Deliver Kegers next. We're for my Wednesday now. We're for my Wednesday. We live out. Let's come out. Come on, come on, come on, come on, ladies now. Come on, ladies. Come on and open your blouse. Open your blouse. Splash your boobies at girls. Splash your boobies at girls. Show your balance to guys. Show your balance to guys. He's going to think below the dashboard. Below the dashboard.

One oh two seven WNOW. We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. What is this happening sound? We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. I think it's the new one from Baruchasalt, right? We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. We deliver keggers. Of course, Baruchasalt playing at the Bowery Ballroom tonight, Anthony. No, this is not Baruchasalt. We deliver keggers. It's Nikki's song. I'm bringing NYPD. It's really offensive. Why? It will allow me because it's sort of offensive against the police. Nikki, did we introduce you yet? Yes, we did. You just stepped onto the mic and started talking. I haven't said hi to you or anything. Just settle down over there. You're supposed to wait until we say. And in the studio now, it's Nikki. Oh, I have to get used to this hat. Is that a new hat? Yeah, Kid Rock called. He wants his hat back. Yeah, that's a new hat. I'd like to do a... never mind. See, I know that you wore a new hat. I got a new hat. Now, Nikki, it's Whip of El Wednesday. So show your boobies. She's got her own belt. That's right, I got my belt. And I'm giving it to Black Girl and I'm done. Oh, no, no, no. Black Girl can't have a belt. No, I just want to say. Why you? Wait, wait, wait. Before you start gender-adding things. Is it the Opie, Anthony and Nikki show? Or is it the Opie, Anthony and Show with Nikki as a guest that's going to have her mic turned off if she doesn't show? Put on your headphones. Put on your headphones because then you would have been able to hear that we turned your mic off. You're going to put them on over the cowboy hat? All right, now why the belt? Let me see your hair. No, I'm not taking my hat. It's your hat, it's not your shirt. No, take your hat off and take your top off. No, I'm not. Nikki, we've never seen the top of your hat. Wait, I just have to say something. Give us some head, Nikki. I meant the top of your hat. Last time I was here I had no hat. Are you losing your hair? No. You didn't have a hat on? It's my trademark. Spaz said he likes the whole cowboy hat. Oh, Spaz, well, fashion guru. Well, there you go. I should talk Mr. Gap. Thank you, Nikki. So because of Spaz you weren't wearing a hat? No, I like the hats. They're fun. Last time I was here I didn't wear a hat. Come on, Wednesday, can we see your boobs? Oh, Rick just took her hat off. She's freaking out. Wait a minute, Nikki. No, that's nice. You've got a wild hair look going. My hair is all like half hair. Let me see. See, look, that's good. She's better, Nikki. She's already running around. Rick shouldn't be touching people. Rick, you shouldn't be touching people. Shut up is a bad word. Did you get that outfit from your aunt? No, it's from my aunt. Oh, you mean my sweater? I have a sweater around me. You have an aunt in like Astoria? I'm like, you know, here we go. I'm thinking you wear the sweater. I'm wearing the sweater to cover myself. Exactly, it's beautiful weather out. And you've got this big, it looks like you just killed a lamb and put it over your shoulders. No, actually I'm not doing the sheep thing like everybody else. No? No. Nikki, we will allow you to do whatever you want on our show as long as we get to see your boobs first. We're never seeing Nikki's boobs. Then why is she in here? I don't know. Well, because I had a, well, if you let me speak. Okay. First of all, I came to say hello. And I also came because I had... We the Liver Kegers! We the Liver Kegers! Come on, come on! We the Liver Kegers! Kegers! All right, Nikki, what? NYPD Don't Shoot Me is totally different than that. What, a new song? NYPD Don't Shoot Me. You're the latest hit? You know we support the NYPD. I know, and you may not play it because it is offensive. And I know that you have like the soul... Are you implying that the NYPD shoot people at random? I don't know, the song's not done yet. Well, why are you coming in if the song isn't done yet? Do you have a copy? No, I came for something else actually. To show us three things now. Say hi. www.ray... We the Liver Kegers! We the Liver Kegers! You can't plug a website. RaiseHell... Your mic's not on! Hold on. Hold the phone. Before you give it out, I gotta check it out. Yes it is. It's just... You stupid bitch! Oh, that's messed up. RaiseHell... How do you spell your name? R-A-Y-Z. Hell. N-I-K-K-I. N-I-Y? K-K-I... Oh, that's an email address. I thought you had a website. Why are you plugging an email address? Because I have this TazCam38 I want to sell. She's selling stuff. Nikki! Wait, you're coming in here to sell stuff? Nikki, we really try to have you come in here and have some fun with us. And all of a sudden she's selling stuff. What is this? The bylines? No, you just... We have a TazCam recorder from Nikki! Yep, and if you want... Me dialing. Email me if you want it. Oh my God, like Psycho Mocks ready to just storm in. No, that's not the only reason I came. But then you start using words like bitch because you hate women. You hate women that don't comply. You stupid bitch! But-sex! Vaginas! We love women. No, you don't. We love women. Lose the sweater, Nikki. Lose the sweater. She's got a tie around her shoulder. She's got a big knot where the sleeves are right over her boobs. Psycho Mock, get in here. Take off her clothes. No, don't you dare! Psycho Mocks chasing her around. She dug behind the equipment again. Oh my God! Oh my God! There's an assault going on behind the equipment. Give me a little stick! You alright there, huh, Nikki? It's because you're gay, doesn't mean you should take it out on me. Wow! Oh, okay! She runs away screaming. Where is she? Alright Nikki, you can come out, it's safe. No, I don't want to come out. I love women. Get over there. You know what he did to me? Shut up! You gotta get on mic or else no one's gonna hear you, Nikki. I want to find out what I did to her off the air. We deliver lithium. You know what he really thinks? What? He thinks that if a girl wears a certain outfit that it means she wants to be sexually abused. Oh my God! Psycho Mock, take her! Take her now! No, no, I swear to God I'll shoot. I'll smack you! Get off me, you freak! So Nikki, why do you dress up and wear like... Stop it! Nikki, why do you dress up and wear pants like that and stuff that accentuate your figure? Because Ben is gay. Ben's gay, Psycho Mock's gay. Thanks! Alright, get back on the mic. Nikki, if you don't want to be seen as a woman, as a beautiful woman, why do you wear clothes that accentuate your lovely behind and your midriff is showing under the little belly shirt? You stupid bitch! Alright, let Nikki... Why don't you just join the nunnery or something and become a nun? No, because if you wear an outfit that makes you feel feminine or sexy, it doesn't mean that you want to be called bitch, whore, slut, you don't want to be... No, but there's a fine line. You don't want to be told to wear your clothes... Alright, but there's a fine line. You could wear that and then if we compliment you on how you look, you could take it as a compliment. You take it as abuse. Nikki, get on the mic because someone wants to buy your... RICK WAS UNDER THE COUNCIL WHEN SHE SAT DOWN! Alright, Nikki, Rick is walking away. Look, look, get over here! We need you in front of the mic. Look, Rick walked away. Rick walked away. Go that way and get back over there. Go this way. You won't have to go near him. Get back on mic! There's someone, honestly, that wants to buy your camera or whatever it is. Look, look, guys, guys, go against that wall, please. I want to talk to Nikki. Yes. Alright, Ben... Alright, Ben, yeah, please, leave the studio. Rick, don't move. Spaz, stay there. Nikki, come back around this way. No, get in there. Alright, here, listen, listen. I know, I know, I know. Alright, Nikki, listen to me. Get behind Anthony. As soon as you get behind Anthony, Anthony's going to protect you. We'll get rid of Rick and Spaz, I promise. Spaz, Rick, leave the studio. Not Spaz, just Rick. Rick, leave the studio. Alright, Rick, leave the studio. Leave the studio. Alright, Rick has left the studio. Nikki, come back around and sit down. We want to talk to you. Wait till second Mark gets them. Please, pull up a chair. We want to talk. Alright, Rick's out. Rick, leave the studio. You want Spaz to lock the door? Spaz will lock the door. Watch him lock the door. Now try to open it, try to open it. Alright, now Spaz, step up. Now please sit. Alright, wait, no. No, it's locked. Spaz, walk away. Walk away. Okay, alright, now sit down and please, we want to talk to you. I know. Now, wait, wait. The only ones in the studio right now are our aunt, myself, Nikki and Spaz. Nikki, please, we're sorry. Okay. We don't mean anything. Alright. See, they're out there. They can't get you. They're all locked up. Okay? Now Nikki, now what is your problem with guys? I don't have a problem with guys. Okay. When we got off the air last time I was here, Opie said, If you don't like the way we treat you, why do you dress the way we do? I know. Psycho Mark is under the castle. Chase her, chase her. The door's locked. She can't get out. I'm not going to be alive here. Goddamn, Nikki, you're a pisser. Ben didn't do a thing. Psycho Mark is under the castle. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. I'm not going to be alive here. Ben didn't do a thing. Psycho Mark's the pervert. God, that was great. Mark, that was perfect. It smells good between your legs. He put his hand right in her lap as she was talking. She didn't even see him coming around. You're a pisser, man. He's wearing a star t-shirt. I guess he's going to be stripping. Nikki, the sweater doesn't quite cover your ass. And we're looking at it as you walk by. All right, now sit down. But you're dressed in a way where we're kind of looking at you. You can't accept yourself as being a girl that guys might want to look at? Isn't that horrible that you can't even accept that? Anthony, David wants to buy... What are you trying to sell? Oh, TASCAM38. Oh, we got a buyer. Yeah, why don't you put your headphones on and we'll talk to David. No one's under the console. No one's under the console. Off the air. But on the air he's stripping. He's pulling his pants down. He's pulling his pants down. Oh, my God. David, what's up? I want to buy her a camera, but she'll tell me something. She can get her to sit down and tell me about it. All right, Nikki, sit down. All right, Psycho Mark, let her sit and talk about her TASCAM. All right, can I sit down? Sit down. So don't call it a camera. Okay. All right, Nikki, sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Dude on the phone. Yeah, I got it. All right. Nikki, we're wasting valuable radio time. Sit down. Sit down. Over there. There's a guy here. You came here to sell your TASCAM. Oh, my goodness. She's locking the door herself. She's locking the door. There it is. You're totally safe. You're totally safe from our wackos. Okay. We deliver Prozac. We deliver Prozac. Everybody knows that when you get attacked, it puts you in a very odd situation. An odd position? Doggy style. All right, David, David, what do you have for Nikki? She's selling this eight-track recorder. Well, tell me something about it. Like, is it a really good word? Does it use much? This guy doesn't know. What do you do with a TASCAM 38? Do you know? You record stuff. How many tracks on a TASCAM? Eight. Okay. We all know. Hey, hey, look at that. It's the bass. Everyone knows. Everyone knows. Nikki, I've got cold hard cash. What is it, the millionaire show? No, no. Come on, tell me about it. Like, how old is it and stuff? Oh, it's not, it's got 500 hours. It's about a year and a half old, and it usually goes for, I don't know, two grand, something like that. Oh, yeah? I'm selling it for 900. And you really need the money, right? Well, I'm going computer-based. I don't like, really, I'm just going logic. Because you might be able to cut a deal, like if you let me tie you down and eat your pie down full, then I'll buy it. You wouldn't know what a TASCAM 38 was if it fell on your head and now you're talking about a TASCAM 38. I'm not talking about a TASCAM 38. I'm talking about a TASCAM 38.

It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Only she's taking off her bag and leaving. They hate women. Yeah, that's why we invented Whip-a-Mow Wednesday. Maybe I won't buy your TASCAM. You can't be nice to any alt. Nicky, my dear, can I buy your TASCAM? It's the weight, what is it, the weight room prom queen? What, yeah, the queen of the weight room prom. I'm going, Nicky. Mike Tyson would like to buy your own loop-the-thorns lock. Where are you going, Nicky? If you really want me to play... Nicky, don't turn around. I'm not going anywhere, you f***ing whore! I'm very serious. She's going to sue. I will sue you. Shaka Mark, let her go. But first push over here so I can punch her in the uterus. Get away from me. I'm very serious. We deliver blows to the rover. We deliver blows to the rover. She's screaming down the hall. She's screaming down the hall. No, she has her own belt. Alright, another... She goes, you guys are a bunch of gay a-holes to Rick as he walks down the hall. And groping checks. Another great appearance by Nicky. Nicky, we love the girl. She's amazing. From We Deliver Kills. She's down the hallway just like screaming. I'm not swearing. She's crazy. Get a cell phone on her. What? Now she's coming back because she really needs to sell us a track recorder. Nicky, please Nicky. Nicky, some of our staff get out of hand sometimes. Whoa! Whoa! Sometimes our staff gets a little out of hand, Nicky. You've got to understand. We're a bunch of guys. No, he can't touch me. We're a bunch of guys. He can't punch a guy in my ass. He can't punch me. Oh, look at that. She went inside the knot. Yeah, you have a nice set there with that. Nicky, why are you so ashamed of your body? I am not. Why are you ashamed of your body? I am not ashamed of my body. If he, if he, what does the matter with him? All right, listen, Nicky. What does the matter with Psycho Marks? You know, outside of the house, Psycho Marks do not get along. Oh gee, he's not called a mentally stable Mark. His name is Psycho Mark. It should be right there on the name. I'm here to say that their psychosis is all real. This is not an act. It's like biting into a peanut brittle and saying, why isn't it marshmallow? It's called peanut brittle. It's Psycho Mark. We have another guy that's willing to buy the time to talk business. All right, Mike? Here we go. Mike? Yeah, Mike? Yeah, listen, Innscript, that thing has an oral punch in punch out. Does it have an oral punch in punch out? It does, but it looks like Ricky Martin. Oh, she's telling a joke now. It looks like Ricky Martin. It looks like Ricky Martin. It's taking the time to sell your equipment. You don't even know what a Tazgam 38 is. Oh, please. I have a FosTex right now and I don't like it. I mean, you know, I've been interested in buying it, but... Well, email... Look, if you're serious, email me. I'm asking, does it have a punch in punch out with a footswitch or no? Yes, I have a footswitch, yes. Does that come with it? Well, for the cables and the footswitch, I might be able to throw the footswitch in, but the cables would be an extra hundred because the cables really cost us about almost $300. Really? Yeah. Well, what do you think, Mike? I'm not buying it. All right, fine. Because I have $900. I'd give you $700 cash right now for it. I'll come down and pick it up right now. I don't have it with me in the studio. I'll tell you from the studio. I mean, I have only 20 minutes outside the city. I'll come get it right now. $700 cash. I'd have to make an arrangement with you if you're serious. All right, can you... I'll give you my email address off the air. All right, give me your email address. If you're serious, I'll hook up with you. And if it's $700, I think we could work that out. I just have to talk to two other members in the band. $700 should be okay, but I can't make that... All right, I'll give you my email address. It's Mike at the CCO Inc. Can I just... Can you give me your email address off the air? Yeah. If you're serious. Will you give him a Hummer? No, I won't. Will you give him a Hummer? I don't think my wife would like that too much. So you can't tell her. All right, Mike, hold on. All right. Hold on, hey. All right, we have another taker for the task jam. My God, it's Anthony from the I'm going to go and speak into it. What is she doing? Hey, you're touching Anthony. Don't even get near me. Don't touch Anthony. Look at this alcohol on his breath. Don't even get near me. Don't touch Anthony. Nikki, I swear I will punch you in the vulva. All right, listen, you touched Anthony. Psycho Mark's allowed to touch you. Mike Tyson at your cervix. Go ahead. Hey, Psycho Mark's allowed to touch you because you touched Anthony. Yeah. No! She loves Psycho Mark. All right, get her out of here. I detect some sexual tension. Get her out of here. We're bored with her. All right, Nikki, thank you for your appearance on the program today. It was a great one. We'll forward any emails referring to your task jam to Nikki's email address. Which is? I'm not showing my ass. www.raize.com. All right, guys, you know what to do. Oh, I know. He's going to be in the whole app. No, no, you're going to get some very nice emails from our listeners. You'll only get legitimate inquiries. Give it up one more time. What's your email address? Onlyraize.hellnicki. Right? At hotmail.com. And how do you spell raise? R-A-Y-Z-E. R-A-Y-Z-E. What is it? What is it? I said it. Get out of here. See, you hate women. I don't hate women, but you're boring now. You can go along with what you want. No, we've got some women. You're boring now. You can go along with what you want. No, we've got some good stuff out here. But I mean, unless I do exactly what you want. All right, bye, Nikki. There she goes. There she goes. Nikki, we deliver keggers, Nikki. Bye. What's your email address? www.raize.com. There's no www in email. Yeah, it's email. Oh my God. R-A-Y-Z. Some guy has become a homo just from listening to you. R-A-Y-Z-Hell, Nikki. Steve. Hello. Hey, Steve, what's up? Yes, I've been married for 11 years. I have two beautiful daughters. And after listening to this woman, I just want to tell, sweetheart, children, I am a homosexual. This woman has made me gay. I have no reason, rhyme or reason ever, look at another woman. I am 100% Spagola. Nikki. This woman made me a homo. Can we play What's in Your Pants? Well, I'm sorry. This woman made me a homo. I apologize to your wife. Can we play What's in Nikki's Pants? I do. You are a disgusting bitch. No. Please. No. All we got to do is we get a phone. Do you know how the game works? You're a blob. You're a blob. You're a dope. Thank you, sir. Oh, thank you. That means a lot. Nikki, do you know how the game works? We take a phone. Do you know how the game works? Okay, you explain. People have to go in there and take a phone and rub it on themselves without their pants or underpants on. Okay. And I'm not playing. And we guessed what you have in your pants. Why? Why is it that you have skin for an extra sandbag? Would you throw us one friggin' bone? Just do it. No. Throw us one friggin' bone here. Does Mandy love it when the women come in here and do that? Sure, she loves it. Does she love it? Yes, she does. Why? I bring half of them home for her. You do? Really? Can I, seriously, can I have that verified? No, you don't. Say it because it's BS. Nikki. Let's go in the other room. Paul. It's not me. Why can't I be an individual? Then Nikki, get out. Because you won't do what we want. You want to know the truth because you're boring. Okay, then I'll leave. I thought it was funny, but all right. What are you packing? You think you're in here for your musical talent? What do you got in there? All right, well, you know. Pool rack full of afro hair? We're just trying to get the best out of what is given to us, okay? All right. Congo rainforest? Are you in here? What are you packing? I'm packing a bag. You're packing a bag. You're packing a bag. You're packing a bag. I'm not discussing it. Are you in here to perform for us with an acoustic guitar? What's in there? I said I would bring NYPD Don't Shoot Me. If you wanted the band to come for the road show, I would do it. But I mean, just because I know why I got in here. Why? I know if I was a guy, I wouldn't get in here. But that doesn't mean... We have guys coming in here. That's not true. There are plenty of guys. Look at all around. What do you see? Guys. They work for you. No, there are plenty of guys in here. Whatever. I'm sure you'll come with us. Nikki, what are you packing in your panties? Oh my God. What do you got? The thing is... Triangle, wood floor, Hitler mustache, Mohawk. What do you got? What are you sporting? Just because I don't want to do what you want. Nikki, what's your thatch? Whatever. What do you got? Whatever. I mean, Opie, Opie. I'm not Opie. I figured him out already. Alright, you got me figured out. Of course. Yeah. Of course. What are you sporting, Daphne? She's really into... I'm sure that when you go home, you talk really nice about the girls that comply to your wishes. I'm sure you talk about them like princesses. Yeah. Princesses turn on and we have great sex at home. Now, what do you sport? Well, I'm not doing it. But that's not me. I'll mention your name tonight when I'm banging my girlfriend, okay? Well, because you're Sandy. Okay. Bye, Nikki. She must have that. Okay. Yeah, she does. See? He's now fine. Oh my God. She's all pissed off. I'm not pissed. I'm not as pissed as Opie is. I'm not pissed? Oh, right. Look at you. You're leaving. I'm not as pissed off as Opie is. Wow, Nikki, those are tight. Wait a minute. I'm seeing a little something. Camel top. Okay. Can I have your pants? I'm going. Okay. Bye. Okay, Nikki. See you later. Look at that. My camel toe. She's pointing at me going, yeah, she's pointing at me going, you're pissed. You're pissed. Sacramarket. Get some camel toe footage. Yes. Go look at that on the website. Russell, first of all, I did come in here with the song, and I did come in here on that premise. You guys are total hypocrites. Why? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Because you said about the road show. Rick said about the road show. Did you say July? And also, the way you genderize music. The way you genderize music? Yes. I usually listen to it. No, you talk about Stone Temple Pilots. Like, they're totally cool. They are cool. And they're macho. And I like them too, and I went to their concert. By comparison between Stone Temple Pilots and a stupid song called We Deliver Keggers, you had fun with your goofy little song. I wasn't even about to talk about it. But the fact is the song sucks. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks. We were positive about this. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers. We deliver Keggers.

We deliver Keggers. She's loony than Fiona Apple. She's loony than Fiona Apple. Why did a man get on stage at the Beacon and French kiss the lead singer and dry hump him? I was there, I saw it. And the problem with that? You're a homophobe or something? Nikki, go away. Go away. Nikki, you're a man. I'm a man, but you are. You're a man. No, I'm not. I said your song sucked and you can't handle it. Alright, bye bye. Wow. Okay. Nikki, I can handle it, believe me. Okay. Because I know who I am. I know what I've done. Nikki, what did you have for lunch? I got to ask. What? What? It's food. What? Because Opie's pissed. So now he's going to try to look really pissed. Ann has known me for a long time. Do I look pissed, Anthony? Opie is absolutely not pissed. You should see him pissed. I could care less. He's at the I could care less phase. You're just some broad with a bad song. Why am I going to be pissed at that? Steve from Foundry wants to talk to you. Steve. Now Steve is a guy that runs the website. He's put pictures, sounds, songs of you up on the site. He's got me a lot of publicity. Steve. Yeah, hi fellas. Hey man. I've been on the record executives. I don't care. Shut up. He's pissed. He's pissed. He's going to diss me now. You're making yourself look even dumber. No. No. Steve. Nikki. Are you listening? Yeah. I'm listening. Look. I listen to a lot of music from a lot of people that send me demo tapes. Your song blows. All right? Well, you're going to back Anthony no matter what. No. He's had a website devoted to music long before us. This guy knows more about music than me. That was a song that was done to be funny. Oh, now you're saying it was done to be funny. We deliver migraine. The first time I came on I said it was supposed to be a funny song. Nikki, are you wearing a thong? Are you wearing a thong? No. Really? Because I don't see any panty lines. The point is that it's one song that I did to be funny because I thought it was appropriate for the show. You can say whatever you want, but that's a fact. Look at her crotch. Nikki, what? You wish I was crying. You know what I'm doing? I'm leaving. Bye, Nikki. Nikki, I don't see any panty lines. You're wearing a thong, aren't you? Look what we did to you again. Again? Ripcoats? No, we don't want to know anything. Why does she keep coming in there? I don't know. It's amazing, isn't it? She subjects herself to the same ridicule every single time. Even a dog knows. And a dog walks in like the same yard and gets pounded. It never comes back. You beat the crap out of a dog enough, they will figure it out eventually. Steve, it was really funny when Psycho Mark was hiding under the couch. Oh my God, you should have seen her face. You freaked out. That's got to be priceless. It was fun. She's an idiot. Alright, Steve from www.foundrymusic.com. Steve, if you could, just to help Nikki out, she had a little bit of a problem here on the show today. She's trying to sell a TASCAM recorder. Yeah, what, you got an 8-track recorder she's trying to hook? If you could just put a link on the website to her email address. Actually, I was just in the process of doing that. I was going to let her know that... It's Rays Hell Nikki. That's spelled R-A-Y-Z-E. You sure it's with an E? Is it with an E? I don't know now. I think because she said I was wrong. I'll do both. I think it might be R-A-Y-Z Hell. R-A-Y-Z Hell. R-A-Y-Z Hell. N-I-K-K-I. Uh-huh. At Hotmail.com. Oh, she wasn't getting an avalanche in about five minutes. Rays Hell Nikki. If you could do that, just to help her out, because I'm sure our listeners will be. Only serious inquiries, please guys. Don't get out of hand. We don't like it when you send emails that aren't, you know, as per what the people want. I consider myself a Samaritan of sorts. Thank you, Steve. I would certainly be happy to do that. All right. There he goes. Okay, guys. From FoundryMusic.com. F-O-U-N-D-R-Y. Music.com. Did you see the camel toes? Yes. She wears the tight pants, but she doesn't, and she wears a shirt that doesn't cover her belly and something that's a little tight around the top, but she covers it up with a sweater that she's tied around her neck and she bashes people for looking at her. Yeah. It's amazing. I'm glad I wore that same outfit in 1961. All right, Anthony. A wow sticker stopped happening today at 430, believe it or not, with her. Yeah. We're going to be at the Ranch 1 on 8th Avenue and 50th Street, right there on the corner, pretty much. Just look for the van and the crowd and get your wow stickers, okay? Rock. Yeah, it's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday. It's a gorgeous day. I mean, people are calling like crazy. They're getting wowed left and right, but it was tough to get to you guys because of what was going on here in the studio, all right? All right, we've got to take a break. We'll be back. Whip-A-Mow Wednesday. What is that, like some kind of guy thing, like some kind of sexist guy thing? Yeah! You will not get away with this. I wish you could just shut your bitch up.

Xavier what's up? How are you bud? You're calling from Florida? Yeah I'm calling from Florida dude. I've been out here for about a month now. Right on what's going down? Nothing I saw you guys had a wow sign on MTV on TRL. Today? Yeah about 20 minutes ago I saw it as soon as they opened up. Was it a big wow sign? Yeah it was a huge wow sign. It looks like they just cut it off a box and put wow on it. Cool. Yeah so by the way I've got to send you guys a pic. I've got a big wow sign on the back of the plane that I fly. I'm a student pilot out here. Oh right on. Yeah so I'm going to send it to you so you guys send it okay? You've been gone a couple months huh? I've been gone since March 26th yeah. Wow well thanks for calling. How's Florida treating you? Pretty good so far. It's a lot of work out here. Yeah. Anyway you guys take care alright? Alright man thanks. Later. Here goes Xavier. Mary what's going on? Hey. Hi Mary what's up? Hi. Nothing. Alright. I just wanted to let you guys know that I saw the wow sign too. It's like white, neon, green or whatever. Oh nice. It's like a huge sign. You can see it. You can't spot it anywhere because it's so bright. Wow everyone's calling in with that now. Cool. Yeah it's really awesome. Well thank you Mary. Well I just wanted to let you guys know that now that I saw that sign I'm going to wow somebody. Oh please do. First car you see on the way home tonight with the wow please wow them okay? I will. I'll do it just for you guys alright? Thank you Mary. Alrighty bye. I'm more than willing to flash their boobies if you have the wow in your car Anthony. Yeah. The most original radio promotion ever invented. Yeah we didn't get that from anyone I guess. I don't think so. Everything else is a blatant rip off. Yeah our whole show is a rip off except for wow. And what's in my pants? I don't think anyone has ever done that one before. No? No. No way. No. No way. Homer 2's I don't think anyone's done that either. Uh Rick what's going on? You look like your head's going to explode. Shoot me. Why? If you make me deal with that chick one more time just shoot me and then wheel my body out. You were the one. Let me say something. Before the show Rick comes running into the office all excited he goes I wasn't excited. Yes you were. Like Nicky's here I think we could have some fun with it. You're all happy and stuff running up and down the hallways. You couldn't wait for us to get her in here. I was positive. You know how it always ends with her crying on your shoulder? Was she crying again? No? Yeah? I was I'm exasperated. Yeah. I swear I thought she was going to try and just jump into the elevator shaft. You know what fascinates me about her? I don't know what she wants. She comes in and there's no set thing that she wants from this program. Like she comes in and she's trying to sell something but I have no clue. But she's telling me again saying Opie doesn't know music. I've been on scholarships. I had to listen to that whole thing again. Who cares? She might be a very talented lady. The fact is the We Deliver Kegger song is very 80s. I think she needs a hot knob. It seems to me like it's been a while. I mean the song isn't going anywhere. She's really got a problem with you dude. I know. He hates me. Why does he just say he hates me? Because he knows he hates me. This is what I've got to listen to. She wants to sue Psycho Mark. I'm like talking her down. Sue Psycho Mark. She's like no that's manhandling and I can take him. Manhandling? She manhandled Anthony. Yes. She was all over Anthony. I was hiding. By the way you were right she does have a team back. Yeah it's obvious. You know she wears these thong and tight pants but the second you mention it she freaks out. Big Kev. Hey what's up guys? You've been waiting for 55 minutes. This should be good. Wow. Actually two things. One I want to say what a. Absolutely I've got to agree with Opie that Otto and George the finest stand up performance on the road right now. Yeah. They were tremendous last night. How was the crowd? Nice. Great. Great crowd. Big crowd. Oh good. And a lot of ONA fans. Jeff Norris also very funny. And Chips Cooney there also. So listen one other thing I have this old fish tank. It's an Aqua Hut model 63. Yeah. And I wonder maybe if you guys could say something about it maybe I could sell it. Well Kev does it come with gravel and a pump? Yeah it comes with all the wires. I spend extra on all that stuff. Will you charge 100 extra for the heater? No I'll throw that all in. It's an Aqua Hut model 63. And it's a classic. Thanks man. We'll sell that for you. Hey Kev. Yeah. Do you work? Do I work? Yeah I work. More for the show than I do at my job. I understand that and we appreciate all the help you're doing. Are you wearing tight pants and a thong? No. But I could if the show required that. I don't know what else to tell people. I don't know George. I mean you'll laugh your yam bag off. I believe they're coming around at the end of June again I'm not sure. Cool. I mean I think he's hilarious on the radio but I mean to be in a comedy club and see the visuals that go along with it is just amazing. Oh yeah and the two guys with him too. Jeff Norris very funny. We love Jeff. And Chips Cooney. Chips Cooney. Alright. Very funny guy. Thank you Big Kev. Hey take care guys. Alright man. Bye. Bye. Chips Cooney with you here on Rock 93. Gil checking in Anthony. I can't believe it. It really works. I just put the sticker on today and got wowed by two girls in a VW convertible. One was hot and one was fat but it goes to show you that it works on all women. You guys are gods in my eyes. The boob magnet. Very cool. It is Whippin' My Wednesday. The boob sighting index is at a fine 8 Anthony. Yeah it is. It's very nice out there. We were predicting a 7 yesterday and it turned out to be an 8. Yeah. Let's go to Matt. Hi Matt what's up? Hey what's up guys. Hi. I just want to let you know Stern he never mentioned any names but it sounded pretty much like he was talking about you guys this morning. Oh yeah. You know. That old gag. Yeah we heard. I couldn't fall asleep this morning so I put on him. You've heard about that. Help me out. Nah no big deal. Yeah. Nah. I don't know what his deal is. He thinks you guys are all imitating him and all that but I don't know I think you guys are guilty of being men. You know being men. Alright. Yeah I know. That's what you're ripping off. That's the original right? Well thanks man. I appreciate it. Alright take it easy guys. Yeah I've heard a lot about that. It's just the same old gag. Kenny what's going on? I was too busy with litigation up here. Hey what's going on? Hey. I was mad. Same thing as the other guy. I was listening to him this morning. He was making me sick. Eh nah. And he specifically mentioned something from your show yesterday. Oh yeah. What? Yeah. About the Cathy Lee. Cathy Lee gifted bit. What no one else could figure out that she sucks? Is that what it is? Yeah. Can you talk about the fact that she blows? You know anybody was going on how he's God and how he created radio. What did Marconi do? Like he's the only one that could be on radio. It's that old gag. What can I tell you? I think it's obvious to everyone that we're doing very different shows. We just had an article in the, where's the Friday morning quarterback? There's a great quote in there. You got past the picture enough to read it? Yeah. No seriously. What a mess. Take a break. Jeremy's got it. PIP I mean. PIP's got it in his office. What was the word he was using? Turade. A turade. Turade. Do you know what a turade is? When you throw a turade or you go off on a turade? It's like a hippie fit. It's a tirade. A tirade but he calls it a turade. I was born in England. It's really funny. We just discovered that our new PD, who we really like a lot, he's really helping out the show and fighting for us unlike Ice Cream Boy, the PD before us. We found out today that he was born in England. His dad was from the States. He was born in England so he had one of those nasty English accents. He came back to the States. He came over here, what was he like, 11? Yeah. He was in school. Hello. My name's Jeremy. How are you? I come from England. Why are you punching me? We learned today he was pretty much pimp of his school. He was the English kid trying to get along. He's hid his accent pretty well but today one of the words popped out. Instead of saying tirade, he said turade. A turade. A turade. Hello. My name's Jeremy. Pleased to meet you. I'm from England. Stop that. All right. Well, thank you, Kenny. No problem. All right, man. All right. All right, man. All right. Greetings and salutations. It's Jeremy. Thank you for welcoming me to these United States. Ow, ow! Why are you punching me? Just because I talk a little different. Don't throw it. Tiree. Tiree. Don't throw it. Tiree. A turad. They were dying in the office. What? And I wasn't even going to call him on it. No, he turned around. What? What? Chris, what's going on? You almost threw a pot at me. Hey, what's up, Chris? Hey, I heard that old guy this morning. That old tired guy. Don't say that. You'll get us in trouble now. That's what we need. You guys have totally different shows. You guys have a lot more energy. That's all. All right, not today. I had it beaten out of me. It got destroyed today in court. Education underground, by the way. Education. No, I mean, let me just read something. This went to every radio station in America Monday. It's an article we did for the Friday Morning Quarterback. It's a trade magazine. It's the... A little radio industry magazine. We have a front cover this week. I don't know, I think it's going to be in the paper very soon. You don't have to say that. Let's see. They always ask us. The reporters have to ask us about a certain individual. Oh, yeah, it's like the big question, you know, when I'm in New York and doing radio. Howard's rabid loyalists have accused you of ripping him off and have called Opey Nancy a copycat act. How did you deal with that? Our answer. Oh, no, is this going to be graded on a curve? It wasn't as strong as we thought it would be. It wasn't like we were getting pounded every day or anything. We had a few, but Aunt Nia used to that, and we just moved forward. I think they liked this show as well. The diehard radio listener really, truly sees the difference between the two shows. It's so easy to quickly go, oh, they're Howard Stern wannabes. But if you really listen, we are definitely doing very different radio. And then the interviewer goes, I heard D. Schneider when he was on the show saying, people don't get pissed off when a band says that they're influenced by somebody. But when a DJ or an air talent says they've been influenced by somebody, everybody's up in arms about it. I answered this one. I said, Aunt Nia admitted on the air that Howard was definitely an influence in our careers, but he wasn't the only influence, that's for sure. I could think of a bunch of other guys that influenced me and they embrace it, which is cool. I worked for Brother Weez in Rochester, and he's my mentor. I talked to him in the past and told him what he's done for my career and he loves it. That's all I have to say about that. That's it. We're doing our thing, man. Well, no matter what you say, you can't win. Doesn't matter. You can't win. Let's go to Nobu tonight, Aunt. Yeah, need to see Breeze. All right, we're trying to catch up here. We've got to take another break. Greg Brady coming in in about 20 minutes. Barry Williams? Yes, Barry Williams, I'm not sure he wants to speak. Just known as Greg Brady. He's multifaceted. He's Johnny Bravo also. Johnny's back! We should either call him Johnny or Greg. It all depends because he's got a CD out as Johnny Bravo. So are we going to get Johnny Bravo? It's like having the rock in here. Is it the rock or is it Dwayne? Right. We met him briefly recently and he was very cool to us. He likes to show. We'll see if he's willing to play along with us today, Anthony. All right, real fast. Earl should be at the WOW sticker stop in about 20 minutes. Where is it? Like downstairs? Yeah, good luck.

Psycho Mark heading down to Ranch 1, 8th Avenue and 50th Street with Earl to hand out the Wow stickers today. They should be there in... They're going to be late again. Who are we kidding? Always. They're supposed to be there at 4.30. Hoping for a nice big crowd there today, okay? Yeah. Alright, George on line 10, Anthony needs a little advice. Yeah, guys, hold up. A friend of mine is getting divorced. Can you hear me? Alright, a friend of mine is getting divorced. For no apparent reason, his wife is going to leave him. I kind of feel what Anthony is going through here. I'm trying to console him. 10 years married and for some reason she says she doesn't love him anymore. Interesting. We're trying to figure it out. What's going on? Why is she leaving? And we can't figure it out. That doesn't sound anything like my situation. She's about to get the divorce papers. He thinks it's going to be a nice clean divorce. Oh yeah, it always works out that way. I'm trying to be a cool friend here and try to help him out. He's like my brother. But I kind of want to tell him that I think there's someone else in the picture. There's no proof of it. They have a storybook marriage. Everybody loved them. They were a secure couple. Yeah, a storybook. Horror story. Just um... screw this guy. Just tell him to turn the gas on on the stove and just stick his head in. Yeah! George, we got to go. Barry Williams is right outside the door. Come on in. Look at you. Look at you all smooth. George, call back, right? Were we keeping you waiting? What are you crazy? We don't keep you waiting. We're keeping you waiting in the outer office there. Can we call you Johnny? Can we call you Johnny? You're whisked right in. But it should be. Of course! Big star, come on! I met all the news girls upstairs. Yeah, you like that? They all needed to touch me. They all wanted me to get some on them. They all needed a little photo and a little signature. They made me to know that they are totally groovy and to be endorsed by the only one who can make them totally groovy. Where the hell did you get those brushes from, man? These are not... Please do not say sunglasses to me. What are they? Shades. If you had your own radio show, you'd know that. If he was walking in with those, he could just go to his parents and go, Mike, Carol? You know, I'm kind of over the nice guy, all American, kind of. Are you going to let go bad boy now? I'm going bad. You can do a couple of pornos. I'll get you right in there. Yeah, what's this? Some of the people that call in here, I think are ready for a shot. It's insane. I can't get past the shades, though. Can we see your eyes or what? I'll give you a little glimpse. You get those from one of those Nigerians downstairs? You've got to be drinking with somebody. I'll give you a little glimpse, but that's all. You have to beg for more. There they are. That's him. That's Greg Brady. I love when you say that. Call me Mr. Bunch. It's more formal. I don't know you that well. Mr. Bunch. How are you doing, Barry? I'm hanging. That's good. I was in the studio a couple of months ago and I was listening to you, somebody about Midget World. Yeah, we had a midget in on the show. Wasn't she a porno? Yeah, a porno. I said, I have to do the show. I was out there, and I said, I have to be a guest on this show. We should have had the porno midget on when you were on. That would have been great. A Brady moment. How was she going to dress up like Jean Bonet? Yeah, a little Jean Bonet. A little cowboy outfit. That was too good. Calm down. I am going to take the shades off. I think I've made an impression, right? You have. I can see it. Alright, let it go. Now we're rocking. Feel it. I could not get this f'n song out of my head. For like a day. I was hearing it. There it is. Improved over the old Brady days. I can tell you that. Standing in line. Every moon. It's a sunshine day. Everybody's smiling. Sunshine day. I've got to ask you something. Who's supposed to buy this album? Anybody. If I bought this and I was tooling down Broadway, I think I would get beat up. Really? I heard you like that. Some people do that just to get beaten up. Spin a little bit of Johnny Bravo and take your shot. Take your best shot, man. I don't know. I think it kind of rocks. I like the Queen cover, actually. Here comes my favorite lyric. Still breaking hearts there, Johnny. You got that right. You go, Johnny. You know, some people seem to miss that there is a little bit of humor in this particular song. Of course there is. If somebody gets a goddamn bummed out about it, they'll say, Hey, man, you're not serious enough about your music, so please, you know, just get that CD out of my face. Okay? What's that all about? You were just Johnny Bravo because you fit the suit. It's like lighten up, man. Have some fun. Have a party, pour another piña colada. You know, Barry, we smashed a lot of CDs on the show, and we haven't smashed yours yet. Can I help? How do you do it? Do you push a button or do you really get a small camera? No, it's usually Opie just going crazy and smashing. I mean, I think the album got just nailed yesterday. Oh, yeah, I would definitely be around for that. But for some reason, I mean, we've played Johnny Bravo, Johnny's back a bunch of times on the show, we haven't smashed it. I want to keep it. There's something about it. It's like a car wreck for some reason. Speaking of Cathy Lee, who is one of my favorite personalities, I would just like to get a diversion of her singing the national anthem at another football game real soon. Oh, yeah, of course. She's so talented. On DVD, because you've got to get the eyes going on, you know, with a little bit of that helplessness and looking up into the sky, pondering the question, from all of America with the flag, and have Cody and Cassidy singing backup. Yes, that was always a good thing. With choreography, which is a little weird, you know. And Frank in the background having anal sex with a hooker. Whoa, that's really good trying for that, didn't it? I spent so long while at Guess What. The other funniest part about that too is like, if you ever get turned down trying to have anal sex with a girl, it's really bad, and you're like, I'm going to have to do this again. It's really bad, but it's just between you and whoever it was. This was out in the public eye. I mean, everyone knew he was trying to get the anal and got turned down. Well, you know what Frank doesn't know? You're not supposed to go for the anal on the first loop over. How long before you and... You're supposed to introduce these things slowly. How long before anal with a marshal? How long? Well, do digits count? Or I guess yes. Or I guess yes. She was an easy sell. You know, like about two pictures of margaritas and you are mine. There's been so much said about that. She is the only girl I ever let call me Greg during sex. Oh really? That is sick! That was just a little... We were pretty bored as kids. Before mom and dad come up and say, who gives a better hummer, mom or marshal? You know what used to be really cool? It's watching the show while you're making out. Oh, very hot! I know, it's a little incestuous. That is really bad, but something really hot about it. When you're a teen star, you've kind of done it all and been there and back. You need things to heighten the emotion and heighten the effects. So I used to just crack that old theme song up and go. Here's the story. I'm a lovely lady, and I'm bringing up every lovely girl. Or just the music like when the kids are walking downstairs. Oh, we've got to play the Brady Bunch bits. Oh, we had a lot of fun. I can hardly wait! Well, we've got some really sick ones. Let me guess, you do a little goofing on the show, a little goofing, a little sarcastic. You're missing some of the wholesome qualities. We just figured because... It's not like zoo radio around here, Barry. No, our bits are a little more intelligent. No bells or whistles. They came up with a great concept. We figured because Robert Reed, who was your pop, right? That would be right. I knew that, but go ahead. I was just quizzing you. Designed the house, he was an architect. I just figured this out, by the way, because I've only been listening to you guys. And the whole time I've been in here, I'm going, okay, now which is OP, which is Andy? Andy, we always get that. Who looks like an Anthony and who looks like an OP? You're right, and Ed, but I've been listening. I finally figured it out. Anthony. I got that right. Let the stenographer record I am pointing at the right person. It sounds like you've been in some litigation yourself. Hey, don't talk jail to me. I didn't do it. I wasn't even there. And it's not my car. Really? Well, I want to know the story about that one. So we were talking about you going down there. Robert Reed played pop, of course, and designed the house, and he designed the stairs from the bedrooms with no backs on them. And then the underneath part was enough room for someone to stand and look up under the stairs at the girls' addresses as they came down. Only Anthony would like that. He's got freeze frame on the television, and he has place transported himself underneath the staircase. What I want to know is who is walking up the stairs when you, Anthony, are underneath looking up. Oh, Marcia. I can just play by play the script. You saw her develop and everything, didn't you? I did. And in one night. It seemed to happen overnight. The whole flowering process. All of a sudden she went from the kid with the wacky crying face, I hate you! I hate you! To the hot girl that the quarterbacks of the rival high schools wanted to date. In one hiatus. She went from young girl to sweet young thing. And what happened? You came back to film and you were like, yeah, Johnny's back. He's ready to run. There's a lot said about that. I wrote the book, Growing Up Brady. I was a teenage Greg, but one of the working titles I had was Growing Up Brady Inside Marsh's Marsh. Whoa! We felt it was a little too edgy. I think she had it. Well, listen, we've got to take a quick break. It wasn't the first time she got hit in the face and said, oh, my nose. What the hell's happening there? We have to take a quick break. That damn football spit at me. I like you, man. You're alright, man. We've got to take a quick break, Anthony. Yes! Kleenex! Go ahead, I'll shut up. Please don't. It's going to be more interesting than whatever you're going to read. No, we're going to play a song for you. Which one's this? The Marsha Brady song. Oh, yeah, I was inspired by Marsha. It's a quick city. This we used to do. The guys in the band? You know, you understand the Brady 6. Silver Platters. Whatever you want to take care of the name. Alright, cool. Turn it up, man. Alright, my guys. Alright, here we go. Okay, we've got to jump back. See? See? Sorry, he's doing the dance. The Brady 6 dance. The Brady 6 dance. True. Very first boner. Watching Marsha. He's in shock, Anthony. I know. I'm just thinking, it wasn't my first boner. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. Philmore Junior High. FFFIL. LLMMO. ORE. Philmore Junior High. Hawaiian episode. Great one. Thank you. I could have used this for the soundtrack of my movie. Yeah. Hey, Anna. I think I did. Well, not after Barry got thrown away by me. Yeah. Catchy. Right? See? Yeah. See, how could you fit a boner into a song? I feel we're bonding. We have something in common. It's catchy, right? See, look at him. God damn, I hate you. I hate you. You're the guy that got the chick that I wanted. Alright, listen, we do have to take a quick break. We got Barry Williams in the studio. I gotta talk about that. I wanna know. We'll do it next. I've got to know. I gotta run. We hate each other. This guy's so decertifiably insane. Thank you, Antoine. Shut up, you jackass. Two ignorant jackasses who someone was brain dead enough to kill. I'm out. AnthonyPriceline.com PriceLine. Yes, PriceLine.com It's bigger than big. PriceLine for groceries now. Of course they did it for airline tickets and what else? Hotels, of course. Gasoline they're coming up with soon. Yeah? Groceries. That's what we're hitting on. You know, you don't have to send Alice to the store anymore to come back with the three bags of groceries that will include out of the top celery stalk, maybe some carrots, and big French bread. She still has to make the meatloaf though. Right, she's still got to whip it up. You know, you used to see the little blackboard behind her in the kitchen that said pork chop and applesauce. Pork chops, applesauce, and stuff. But now you can name your own price for pork chops and applesauce with PriceLine.com. Go to PriceLine on the web www.Priceline.com Name your own price, shop wherever you want. Whether you've got King Collin, Gristini's, Walbaums, Agostino's, ShopRite, Food Emporium, hundreds of stores, anything you want to buy. You name your own price, save up to half off your grocery. And I will personally come to your abode and deliver it to you. Well, the way you delivered the blueprints for your pop there, I wouldn't trust you with the groceries. You get some chick, you put it in the back of the station wagon, they pull away, it's over. You're not getting your meatloaf that night. You were the most incompetent son of a bitch when it came to delivering those prints. And he gave you a second chance? You F'ed it up again! You are living in the past, man! I've learned my lesson, okay? Don't forget the Yogi Bear poster, too. Oh, the Yogi Bear poster. That wasn't his fault, that was Jan's. He left it in the goddamn log for me. I just went out and found it, and then I had to wear that stupid costume. This costume because, again, trying to get the chick. Always trying to impress the... You almost cut yourself off on a coral reef because of the chick. I know, I know. Well, I was a randy teenager, what can I say? No, Barry Williams will not be delivering your groceries. You will actually get them. That's good news, yes. Or maybe in his groovy ride, that piece of crap car. Caveat, I am sorry, my friend. Come on! I want that car. Let me touch something. Anthony knows more about the Brady Bunch than you, Barry Williams. I'm not going to take that bet, but I'm going to test him. It's almost pathetic. I might give you a little test here. Throw out some questions or something. Hey, let's do a trivia contest! Wow, he hasn't done that in a million times. We won't do that to you. I want to talk about Marcia's dash. Yeah, we'll do that. All right, Anthony, we've got to get out of commercials here so we can continue with Barry. So it's on Priceline.com or give them a call. 1-800-Priceline. You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now. Thank you. And we're back. 2127571027 at the Opie and Anthony Show. This is definitely a thrill for Anthony and I. We've got in the studio Barry Williams. You can call him Craig Brady. You can call him Johnny Bravo. You can call me Hey You. Or Hey You. One friggin' episode of being Johnny Bravo and years later it still sticks. Well, the suit still fits. Oh, does it? Of course I had to have it made for me, but that is short. A good snug fit. Who could forget, adios Johnny Bravo. Not me. Say, bueno dias, bravo Johnny Bravo. Yeah, what happened there? You were all dead set against it. Adios Johnny Bravo. Johnny Bravo returneth. Sold out the siblings, you're going solo, blowing off college. I had the right idea. I had the right idea. And then in a twist of just horrible fate, Greg gets the idea that changing the world is a good idea. Yeah, yeah. Who's to say? I mean what is the sound? Say my sound. It doesn't even sound like me. Good thing. It's not about me, man. That one guy, hey Greg, it's not about me, man. There could be a lot worse things than fitting the suit. A lot worse things, which is why I have set out to write that wrong. Yes. A little later. Bringing it back. Bringing it all back. You're doing a book signing tomorrow, Barry, huh? I don't know. I just point and shoot. You are though, and people should show up and hell yeah. And give you love. It's going to be at the NBC Experience at Rockefeller Plaza tomorrow, right? Yes. Have you seen this place? No. It's incredible. I was up there actually today. It's two floors, it's interactive, they've got video things. You can sit down with Jay Leno. You know they do a little thing and he's there and he kind of pops the questions. They have an audience that laughs. Like the king of comedy. Exactly. It's a little scary. I did it twice because I can't get on his show. So I wanted to get the full experience. It was a little creepy. Why the hell wouldn't Jay have you on? I don't know. I don't even know if it gets to Jay. We have to talk to the people. Well, it's Barry Williams, Jay Leno. He's about four layers deep in people, right? And then you get on the show, Barry! It's Barry, man! Here you are! It's going to blow up on Britney Spears! I did Rosie O'Donnell's show about a week and a half ago. I love the Rose. I'm sure she's very big on the old shows. She says to me, I can't believe that you haven't been on my show before. I've been calling her every time I come for a year. I say, Rose, you take your time. The CD just broke. The movie's coming out, Rose. I'd love to come on the show. And if she can't believe it, I want to know. Hold my calls! I'm eating a Twinkie! I'll be right back. Oh, look, see? We found his soft spot. We found Barry's edge. See, he's friends with her because he can't bang her. That's what it is. Don't think she's interested. Don't think she's interested. I completely understand. So the book signing's happening tomorrow. And you're signing the Johnny Bravo CD, right? The CD and the book will be there at 10.30 in the morning. Tomorrow morning, NBC Experience, Rockefeller Plaza. And I'm staying until I run out of ink. Very good. Did you happen to catch on Fox last night? They did a little Brady Bunch movie. Oh, Fox did a little Brady Bunching? Yeah, yeah. A little Skimmin' movie? Oh, you weren't a part of that one, Barry? I think they called it the unauthorized. Yeah. Do you know why they called it unauthorized? Because it was. No one had any say in that one, huh? This is something that they extract from what we call in the business public domain. Which means they go through a bunch of clips from Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood and Star Magazine. And based the movie on that. Oh, by the way, did I mention they borrowed liberally from my book? Oh, really? Oh, sure. But just enough to keep the facts straight, then they delivered it completely botched up away. But you know, it really would have sunk if they didn't get such fine actors to portray it. I know it. And look alike. I swear to God, I turned it on and I said, I am seeing myself. Here I am, in all my glory. A little fatter, a little taller, about ten years older, and smoking the wrong cigarettes. Here I am, being very cool, stuck up and conceited. Well, they got that right. But the rest of the people... Well, everyone knows you smoked a valiant cigarettes. No, no, man. That's a big V. I'm talking on the show when Greg got caught smoking. Shit! A big V. I can't stand it! Valiant cigarettes, but it wasn't your jacket. It wasn't your jacket. It was your pal that you were in the bandwidth. And can you believe my mom believed that? What a line of crap. And that stuff shirt, mother of your friends that came over the house like, We're doing a meeting about smoking in our high school. The PTA lady? What a stuff shirt. And the pal sells you out. Hey, dude, you left these cigarettes. It's not my jacket, it's your jacket. Oh, Greg, thanks. And then you ratted him out, though. Of course I didn't. You noticed he wasn't on our next episode. That's the good thing about having your own series. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't real. Stop. You just stop. I watched it like 80 times. I know it happened. It wasn't real, Anthony. It's a TV show. They found out because he had ripped it. Alice sewed up the jacket. So that's how I know it was his. Speaking of Alice, here's the litmus test. Speaking of Alice, now we know she made the meatloaf and the hot Christmas turkey dinners and stuff. And we know that she actually, and I know this was a trick of double photography, but she was actually Sergeant Emma and now same person. Yeah. But she also, our beloved housekeeper, had a last name. Yeah. And I'm just searching for that. Searching for that last name. Oh, god damn it. I can help. It's the short-term memory. Think Ozzy. Oz-board? No. Harriet? Yeah, Nelson. There'll be more. I'm only giving you half a point because I can see that it was turning around in the upper part of your brain. I'm trying to think of where that name came out in one of the episodes. But I can't remember. The short-term memory is shot. Well, now that you have the next two nights of reading worked out for you, Yes, yes. You'll be able to get that fact and many more. Growing up reading, I was a teenage Greg. Yes. And we've gone through it. I actually read one of the books. Was that your book talking about how Robert Reed was upset with a lot of the episodes and storylines? Yes, yes. In fact, I interviewed him over several days and he supplied the actual memos. The memos are great. In fact, he was dying at the time. I didn't know it at that time. He went up and got these memos and maybe that was part of it. He wanted to share who he was and what he was about with the show. I think he actually improved the show. Some of these memos were un-made believable. They would write these episodes. And Robert Reed, I think he wanted to be accepted as an actor. As a thespian. Well, no. Thespian, lesbian. I don't want to get into that. But he wanted to be accepted as a lesbian. I don't want to get into that. But he wanted to be accepted as an actor. They would come up with these ludicrous episodes sometimes and he would be upset with the storyline. Like, no, my character wouldn't react that way. And write these memos to the producers. It's like, it's a pretty bunch. It's like fluff fun kind of show. Sure. It doesn't have to be serious. He was coming from a completely different place. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was classically trained. He was accepted as a thespian. And did a lot of Shakespearean plays. Or the tights, you know. The whole thing. And he was nominated for Emmy awards with E.G. Marshall. So he did have that whole thing going on. And of course the other thing he had going on. Now did you know that he was a gay man? After our second date. Yes. How many times has he said that? I make like good kisser, by the way. Just not after 5 o'clock without a second shave. No. I mean at some point you do. I mean you know kind of what's going on with your co-stars. Right. I mean you know, you know, let's say which time of the month to stay away from. Marcia for instance. Really? And you know what's going on with Robert Reed. Because you know when to make the move on Florence Anderson. Because she's vulnerable and feeling lonely. Now as per the Fox little TV movie, you got two of the best actors in the world. And you know what's going on with Robert Reed. Because you know when to make the move on Florence Anderson. You got turned down by Mrs. Brady. Yeah I mean that's accurate. That's accurate? You went out on a date. Right you know and I was throwing out all my best great Brady moves on her. And I had my imagination going, a little bit like a bottle of Westin Oil in the backseat. In case. With protection. And by the way, if you ever use Westin Oil, never heat it beyond 82 and one half degrees. Burn the heck out of your back. And so I was doing all... I had all my childhood fantasies, my teenage hormones were raging. my teenage hormones were raging and what have you and you must have gotten so much young i haven't tell that you finally decided you wanted some i needed to have any experience i needed to have you experience i was tired of training all this you know this one of the you know griffys and i do not feel that i was missing something out there's there's florence you know what their you're missing here uh... uh... uh... and then you're right not the razor blade and so i was you know i was hoping i'd get a little you know a little a little instruction but you know she was not she was not in that uh... in that uh... that they're not saying that you know i'm from she let me kiss her she let me give her she did not she let me kiss like a passionate care of her actor or what no i don't know i didn't get past her tonsils or anything i don't know a little like wet lips that the other must've just like was good it must have just open a lot of it was fantastic and what's it is so i'm happy and it looks fantastic and i'm not going to be able to watch great what is your movie is that that one sunday sunday night on nbc nine o'clock and you believe i squeezed a movie out of the steel to wow talk about the milk wagon others of course i have to say what can we expect uh... and moving ever well that all the dark areas and this movie for you did you know that this movie for me because because any particularly if you like heard some of the rumors may be even read the book that kind of thing this the movie won't disappoint but instead of just describing like little roms in the swimming pool or or in in the bedroom and you actually see like tops coming off a whole twine intertwined in the towels and use it going on and tongue going on today did it did it didn't yeah use some of the brady went to the did it a little version of the same time cool tunes going on in the background you know like crystal blue persuasion and they might have been a bit of a chance of the time of the time right now that's something you kind of forget uh... yeah marcia i think i'm having an acid flashback and i think we can put on your film or junior high cheerleading outfit run through the a drill for me and then you spent a little bit you know where she does not begin to realize from the issue really came off as a tool lindsay jen light on the job just like a off has she has she got to the point where she uh... doesn't want to be associated with the things and as you know she doesn't have i can't get it you know he doesn't want to do and that's how you know it's hard for her because even though she she looks the least like which is she's from here and yet i did read that book is a good dawn in portrait of a teenage runaway yes jam brady reyes all the sense is like this runaway i did this was surely after the show on our she's a i don't prostitute getting back you know cycle where do i go to get a piece of that for a buck it's jen brady for god's sake and she wasn't charged enough you know fifty bucks really kind of a great everybody has a great job uh... fifty bucks an hour anyway he has a and a and

A wheelbarrow full of money? We're going to Cleveland, kids! Gee, thanks, Pop. Gee, can we go to a new, underdeveloped amusement park that ABC needs to promote so that they can get some money? Is that what that was? Of course it was. Why the hell Oslo would be out there in the middle of nowhere? They would send them to Cleveland. ABC owned the place and they couldn't get anybody to go so they made a two hour commercial on our show. God damn it! That's great. That's awesome. Everybody thinks we're having a great time out there. We're just doing their leg work. Wow.

Yeah, but if you want that hot body, Stacker 2, world's strongest fat burner, it burns the fat, cuts down on the cravings to snack during the day, and gives you a boost to energy.

I'm going to have a great time. I'm going to have a great time. I'm going to have a great time. I'm going to have a great time. It's so good. They couldn't leave that as a cliffhanger where you didn't pop your head up at the end of that episode. No, I held my breath for a week. But you know what it is? After that episode, before it ended, they showed that you were okay. Do you know they almost didn't even use that piece of footage because they explained to me after all this method acting that I had endured. They said it looked... We're not sure we can run that piece of film because it looks a little too dangerous for a Brady episode. I said, go put a toilet in the bathroom. A little dangerous. A little dangerous for Brady. We have to go to the phones, Anthony, before we do though. We want everyone to show up tomorrow at 10.30. Barry Williams will be signing his new book, Growing Up Brady, and copies of his CD, right? Absolutely. You'll sign just about anything, right? I sign arms. I sign arms. You'll sign breasts? I will. Because ladies will come by and wow you. It is Wednesday. What day is it? I don't know. Please. But tomorrow, 10.30. I will be walking home a little later this afternoon. So if people want to come down and hang out around Carnegie Hall here, I'll be carrying a little black case. If anybody feels like wowing me, it would actually make me feel like I had made my mark here today. I feel like I would be a better person for that. Bring in the surprise. The image thing has gotten a little old. It's a little vanilla. How many years have you gone with the good boy, Greg Brady image? You got to burst out of it. I don't know. I've been at the S&M bar for four years. I've been bad. It's a long... I should be punished. It's been a long time here. Oh my God. Life is good. Hello. Life is good. Hello. How are you doing? Oh my God. Do you know who that is? Yeah, Greg Brady. How are you? You are the one person I am going to let call me Greg Brady. Do you know who that is? That is actually Cindy Brady. All grown up. Baby talk, baby talk. It's a wonder you can walk. Wow. You shut up, buddy. Barry has forgotten all about us. Is there anything you'd ever wanted to know? Could I... I was a former child star. But I'm a successful one. I'm not a bitter one. This is the lie. I'm not bitter. I'm loving. And I'm attracted. Wow, look at that. Why is she wearing that? You're right next to her. What is that, Barry? First of all, it's just a bunch of straps. That isn't even clothing. It's kind of X-y and it's black and it's shiny. Can I touch it? Yeah. Oh my goodness. And now it's missing altogether. She's taking a photo for you. Give her the real or fake test, Barry. All right. Very nice. I don't care if they're real or not. But I'll tell you, something suddenly came up. Wow. What is your name, darling? Anna Romero. Yeah, she's appearing in Privilege, right? Right. Tonight, tomorrow? Right through Saturday night. Right through Saturday night? My God. Look at you, Barry. You know, I listen to you guys and I say, I wonder if this is really going on in the studio. This is too amazingly hot. Let's start at the top with the snake skin cowboy hat and down to the feather... You can take the stuff off. ...feather turquoise boa with silver in it. A tinsel kind of thing. And a beautiful pose. And this is... Whoa. Oh gosh. This is a fine... I'm in love. That's balloon knot. This is not... This is not leather. This is kind of a vinyl stretch. PVC two-way stretch. PVC two-way stretch. Wow. Oh, I must say that it does wonderful things for your form. And you do wonderful... You have a wonderful form. Now, do you feel the same way about her as you did that teacher you had a crush on in that episode, remember? But she was in love with the ball player. I'm tethered into a little stir. This seems to be much more powerful. Somehow. You really are a beautiful, beautiful woman. Great staring after for extra help. I get to see you. A privilege. A privilege. What a privilege. West 23rd Street. She's the featured dancer there. I imagine. Through Saturday night. You slinging tap gears behind the ball. Do you ever watch porn movies? Well, sometimes just passing by on a channel if my changer gets stuck or something, it might stay on for a while. That's what I did. I did a really big one called Zazzle. I did Zazzle. Zazzle. Zazzle. Zazzle. I'm going to have to write that down and catify it at Blockbuster. I did a scene with two girls. We had dildos on our boots. Oh, dildos on your boots. And then I did a scene with two guys. And that was a double penetration scene, which was very difficult since everybody was still an amateur. That pays extra, doesn't it? Double? Yeah. It doesn't. No? True to the price of one. You have to be really relaxed to do that, don't you? Yeah. Wow. You have to be really relaxed. Do you have a little glass of wine or something? No. Do you practice a lot? Uh-uh. The anal loop has a... A stretcher? No. It numbs you. Oh, I see. It's a benzocaine. Can it hurt yourself? You want to know. Stop! Stop! It's hurting! It's hurting. You've got that nummer in there. No, you know, you want to be careful. But I see. I didn't know that. Do you have a question for Greg Brady there? You must have grown up watching the Brady Bunches that we all did. How come I have a Barry Williams the whole time? Now we're getting somewhere and we're back to Greg. Jeez, guys. Please give me some respect. That's true. Thank you. Did you grow up watching the show? I did. I did. Who was your favorite? Greg. Well, look at that. See? It's working. I have grown up just watching you in the last few minutes. Remember when Greg went deep into the canyon? The Grand Canyon episode I'm talking about? No, I don't remember that. No? You didn't see that? Well, you know what? We should go because it involved donkeys. Yes, it did. It did. Which you won't see a privilege. Not the donkeys. She keeps going. We should have music or something. Yeah. Something from Johnny Bravo. I don't know. Oh, hey, play some Johnny Bravo. We're the champions. Come on, man. We are the champions. We're the champions. Yes, some background music. Grab something out of there. Some music. Oh, yeah. It's me and you. I do. Have you ever had an upside down split? You're not talking about cake, right? No. No, I have not had an upside down split. Do you want to try it? Say yes. I'm quite sure that I would like to do that. Did you want that dressed or undressed? Undressed. It would be important to me that it was undressed. I think it would be important to our listeners. I'm doing it for the listeners. This is such deja vu. This is just like episode 24. I swear. I'm speechless. This is like when Greg had to judge. You got to do a cheerleader final. You got to do a cheerleader final. This woman is nasty. She's taken off some of the strap work. Look at what she's wearing now. She's got nothing but a G-string on her. She only has one breast cupped and the other one is completely exposed into the wind. They both are now. She is topless. Completely topless. She's wearing this little G-string bottom with a studded belt. If these are not yours, these are the best I've ever seen. Oh, my God. Wow. Hey, Barry. Look at that. Wow, look at that. Do you need help with that picture? Is this for the web? May I say that you pose very well, too? Look at the way she gets that. You can drop right into a pose that I could see on page 162. All is good, but this is better. Look how well-groomed she is, too. I like the belt. It's all she's wearing right now. It's just a belt and a little something on her forearms. Look at that, Barry. You're a good girl. Kyle Hitler. That is nice. All right. Hang on. What are we going to see again? Upside down split. This is a first for me. I've never seen the upside down split. It's totally safe. Don't worry. Do you need Barry to help you out with this? Nope. You just sit there. You push the mic away. Upside down split. I have an idea of what it could be. Greg, what are you doing up there? Do not do this at home. I love where you put your head. Oh, my God. Greg, what are you doing up in the attic? Oh, my God. Look at that. We have met before. I recognize you now. Wow. You've got to love the upside down split. That beats pork chops and applesauce. May I just say that you are lovely from all angles. Thank you. Wow. I think you've seen just about every angle now. You could call that an eye-to-eye confrontation. I am red. Yes, you are. I am red as your beautiful lipstick. It was winking at you, Barry. Oh, my God. You don't have any of that anal-sloop going on there, do you? No, I'm not kidding. Okay. Good sport you are. She's beautiful. Wow. Featured attraction. You can see why. Quarter of 11th and 23rd Street. Unbelievable. Sweetheart, go out and marry a millionaire. You deserve it. Oh, there you go. Rick, what are you practicing gynecology? Jesus. Wait a minute. I'm the gynecologist here. We'll have these pictures up on the website. Wow. So you don't have a question for Greg Braden? All the years that have gone by. All the episodes. All the shows. What do I most want to know? Some advice, probably. I get all that Big Brother stuff. Deep, profound wisdom. Offer me. You're sitting there, you had a question, and you didn't know who to go to for the answer. I just like watching her think up the question. We don't even care at this point about a question. We're just stalling. Long, straight, dark hair with highlights in it. Beautiful makeup. Unretouched. You must have gotten a lot of ass like that. Come on. No. Come on. This is special. Being a child star and working on the set, you spend a lot of time on the set, right? All day long? Sure. Did you do when... I know that teenage boys get erections a lot. I know that they get... Not just teenage boys, I might add. She's just like Katie Couric. Especially teenage boys. Just teenage boys. I'm sitting on an awful lot like a teenager. Spending all that time on the set, where did you have time to masturbate? Now that's a damn good question. Anna, where on the set in the Paramount lot did you get a chance to spank out a bench? I also might add, this is not a question I have, but I'm sure you have. I'm sure you have. I also might add, this is not a question I have been asked before. A first time question. A lot of firsts on the show today. And it took your lovely creative mind to come up with it. Tiger's dog house? No, no. Sneaking into the clubhouse? I actually used to go to Bonanza's Western Street and go up where Miss Kitty lived at the top there. Bonanza was being filmed? My private area. I could smoke my cigarettes and be alone with myself and think of lovely people like you. We had not yet met, but you embody the picture that I would think about. Are you going to come down to the club? I think I must. We have a special room just for you. She definitely has the centerfold look, doesn't she? I've been in magazines. I did the centerfold for Hustler and Gallery. I was in Pantos, but it was with another girl. Was there any urination in Pantos? No, no. I was in the clubhouse. I was in the clubhouse. I was in the clubhouse. I was in the clubhouse. Was there any urination involved in the penthouse? No, that was before the whole urination thing. Now you open a penthouse and all you're seeing is people taking a leak. I don't know. Not an either. If you're under it, then you're under it. Just look at it. Greg! I want to see you in the bathroom. Golden showers for everyone. Well, wow. Maybe that's why we didn't have a toilet. There's no toilet. Get out of there. Girls always brushing their hair. No time for Greg to go in there and spank out a batch. Anything else for Greg Brady? That was a good question. No follow-up question. Now are you married? No. Are you? Today. As he sneaks his wedding ring out of my pocket. I am. And I'm very happily married. That doesn't mean anything. Can you keep it a secret? No. Things have a way of getting back in. It's not like we're talking to anybody here. Enjoy. And I do enjoy the female form. And yours in particular. The heels are great. You could have turned Robert Reid straight. If you would have brought her in the house instead of that redheaded bitch you took to the drive-in. Remember that? Robert Reid. Put away the boys. Everyone, it's Millicent. Millicent. Millicent. That was the ugly duckling that I think Marcia Brady transformed. The woman was Millicent. Wasn't Tom Hanks wife on one of the episodes? Yes. She was the cheerleader. She was the cheerleader or something. How was she in Bad Bear? She was a little young for me. She was a little young for me. I'm so shocked. Usually something like this happens and you come in and you just tease the guest. We start describing things and she starts taking them off and handing them to me. How good is that? You should have been here the other day for the Whipple Ball back. That was the show. I want to know. We'll show you the bad in a little while. Don't touch it. I think Barry needs to see that upside down. They're going to kill him. You should have a heart attack. I'm going to go to the bathroom. They're going to kill him. You should have a heart attack on our show. Maybe Anthony. No. I'm in litigation right now. You've been through that once. I missed that. Anything with a previous band around your finger? That thing. I don't need that action. I'm right in the midst of it as we speak. Any naked women flinging at me should be kept away. Have you had a lap dance? Today? I have not had a lap dance. I've never had a lap dance by you. How about a lap dance to one of Johnny Bravo's songs? That could work. This is kind of a... Something with a little bounce to it. Something happy together. Johnny's back again. We'll be quiet. The hit. Johnny's back. What's that? So he doesn't get any on you? Groovy. A little lap dancing going on in the studio today. That's what was happening up in the attic. Wow. Wow, look at the moves she's got. Wow, Mary. Johnny's back. Johnny's back. Ready to soil my underwear. Johnny's back. Johnny's back. Get ready to dig and move and be... You go, Johnny. Wow, look at her go. Look at Johnny go over there. This girl can give a lap dance. ...just to keep on keeping on. Johnny's back. Ready to rush this pound of night. Look how she holds on with her legs. I see that. Isn't that amazing? Get ready to soil my underwear. Johnny's back. Yeah. Johnny's back. Wow, man. Woo! The star is on the rise. God damn. Wow, wow, wow. Let's hear it for Anna. Did she give a lap dance? That's a Hollywood star you gave a lap dance to. Give me a cigarette. I'm going to start smoking again. She's a wonderful dancer. Isn't she? Who's your new best friend? Anthony and Anthony. Yes. We definitely have to take a break here. We still have to get to the phones. A lot of people want to talk to Barry Williams. We're having fun today. We have to give Anna a Romeo. She's appearing in Privilege through Saturday. She's absolutely smoking. You encourage everyone to go down there. She's being featured down there, right? Yep. She is smoking. You are smoking. That's great. In some countries you're married. Of course Barry Williams signed copies of his book, Growing Up Brady. The Johnny Bravo CD and whatever else you want him to sign. NBC movie, Growing Up Brady, Sunday, 9 o'clock. But tomorrow at 10.30 at the NBC Experience Rockefeller Plaza, Barry Williams, Great Brady will be there live. Also, Barry Williams.com has got going. The website. Gotta break the code. Don't be going down that Great Brady Road. You gotta go right to Barry Williams. Barry Williams.com. Check out the website. Pretty good for the Brady Bunch fans, I guess. I think I'm going downtown tonight. I think you are. I think we have one last break left with Barry. We'll go to the phones next. Okay, cool. Stay there. OVN Anthony. 1-800-CAR-CASH Anthony. That's 1-800-CAR-CASH. Well, I really don't want to have to refer to another Brady Bunch episode. But you all remember the episode where Greg bought the car from one of his friends. The caveat emptor episode. He paid good money, hard earned money. And what did he get? A piece of crap. A lemon. And he was going to turn around and sell it to one of his friends after he fixed it up with some bubble gum and paint. Had the other kids work on it. And it was crap. A very well respected actor, by the way. Charlie Martin Smith. Was that who that was? Well, he was ready to get taken. You're going to get taken if you answer an ad in the paper or try to sell the car to one of your friends or something. Car cash. See, if they had car cash around back then, in like 69, 70, Greg could have just dialed up car cash and gotten top dollar for his jalopy. That's right. They take care of all the paperwork. They make it very easy to sell your car. Not have to listen to his father ragging him about caveat emptor. Shut up, Pop. Where's the pot? Go back in your office. The boys. I want to watch myself in your den. Leave me alone. Turn on my lava lamp. Give me my beaded curtains and my black light posters and a little bit of fringe on this vest and just leave me the heck alone. Hi, Carol. I got to call car cash. Yeah, car cash. They'll buy anything. Fancy cars, bands, pickups, 4x4s, least finance cars if you can drive it. Car cash will buy it. And they'll give you top dollar for it. Like I've said real quick, it's easy. It's not a pain in the ass like taking an ad out in the paper. Give them a call right now if you're even thinking about selling your car and see what they'll give you for it. 1-800-CARCASH or visit the website www.carcash.com or stop by car cash on West 55th Street between 11th and 12th Avenue in Manhattan. 1-800-CARCASH Give them a call. 1-800-CARCASH We're back in two minutes. Stay there. What country are you from? What ain't no country? Listen, what? English, mother f***. Do you speak it? Then you know what I'm saying. Say what again. Say what again. I double dare you, mother f***. Say what one more damn time. Okay. What? Destroy, destroy. What much? 1-027-WNEW For when we lose only a number. Alright, we gotta go the phones now with Barry Williams. 2-1-27-57-1-0-27 Yeah, a lot of questions. I had one, but you answered it in your book. But for years there was no internet or anywhere to go to answer a question about a god damn episode you saw on television. For years I was trying to figure out what the hell was on your lip during the UFO episode. You had swamp lip. All of a sudden there's Greg and he's got like a thing on his lip with a white thing over it and it's like they don't explain it, they don't refer to it. Something about cutting yourself, shaving. I was retarded and for years I'm like what the hell was that? I'm seeing a couple of people have that question. I will tell you what that was. What did you think? I couldn't for the life of me figure it out. Most people think STD. It had to be some kind of herp or something. A little volcano there on the lower lip for the Greg man. The Gregster. I noticed Robert Reed had one same episode just on the show. Get out of here. This is not caused from the sun or anything else. I was in a head on collision. I had a collision in my car. In your groovy Volkswagen? No, I had a 356 Porsche. Look at you! I got a lot of money, I'm a teenager, what are you going to do? Run around a Volkswagen. Kind of a babe magnet is that. Now it's okay, but the end of the day. Porsche. So anyway, going down this lady, she's a teenager, she's driving a station wagon with the wood on the side. Talking to her dog in the back seat, which is always a good thing to do when you're driving. While she was turning around, she was having to drift over to my side of the road. This is residential now. We're down 25 miles an hour, 30 miles an hour, and I'm coming to a screeching stop. But not in time. I'm going to have to force me against the steering wheel where I tore my lower lip from my lip down almost damn near to my chin. Now when you see your life flash before you, is it your life or Greg Brady? I'm wondering, do you see the wedding of Mike and Carol, Tiger and Fluffy running through the cake, or is it your life? Good! I didn't have time for any of that. The next thing I knew, I had my teeth embedded in the windshield. And fortunately, it didn't break my jaw, it didn't even knock out my teeth, but it tore my lip down. It was all in one straight little line, easily covered with a tiny band-aid. So that's on Thursday. I show up Monday for work, and it was Thanksgiving. I show up on Monday for work, and they go, oh my God, because now it's swollen, and I've got these stitches, and it's a little oozy, and stuff like that. You're shaving his mouth. Like, how are you shaving your lip? I wasn't buying that. So the idea was you just downplay it, and no one would ever notice. And the worst part was the whole episode was you doing, so you were using your mouth on the little flute thing. And it hurt. Another Robert Reed reference. You know, you do something like that, and you think it's going away, then it turns out that they have shown a hundred thousand times. A hundred thousand times. And so it gets reinforced a little bit. I always wondered what the hell it was until the book came out. I've got a question for Barry Williams. Can I smell your chin? Oh, man, I'm going to be in more than hot water. Worth it. I have done a lot of things in my career, fellas, but this has not been among them. This is a very special episode. A very special episode of the OKAA. This adds a new W to Wow Wednesday. I put a Y right in it. Barry Williams in a very special opiate amputee show. That upside down split thing. I need to smell your chin. I don't know what that was. And you know, so glad it wasn't a tease. How that came out, come in, and she's standing around. They barely take anything off. No, she's totally naked. Very squared away. I'm sure she's very popular. She's going to be featured at Privilege Through Saturday. I don't know what else to say about her. I'm certainly Privilege Through Wednesday. Let's finally get to the phones. People have been waiting a very long time here. Mike, you've got a question for Barry Williams. I wanted to know what kind of hairstyle Marsha Brady had downstairs. I think we covered that a little bit earlier. The little upper lip thing. I called it sort of the Hitler thing. The Hitler mustache thing. They made out and stuff, but they didn't have sex, we found out. Heavy petting. I think Barry was petting the poodle. You got the ham down there and stuff. Jesus. Oh my God. Let me just bask in that for a minute. Laura, what's going on? I wanted to play What's in My Pants. Oh right, Celebrity, What's in My Pants. I love it. Get the theme song. Sure, Laura. I'm going to learn this game as we go. No, definitely not. Let me play the theme. It doesn't explain anything, but it's kind of happy. We love this game. Guess What's in My Pants. Who am I speaking with now? This is Laura. We play this game, guess what's in my pants. This is how it works. Laura will take her phone. She will rub it on her most intimate of areas without any underwear, pants or anything. This is for real, Laura, right? Yes, it is. You wouldn't try and fool me right now. She will do the up and down. She will do the side to side. She will do a circular motion. From us hearing what it sounds like on this end, it's triangle, wood, pool, those are the alternate ones. Triangle, normal, natural, shape, Hitler mustache, mohawk, which is sort of like the Hitler mustache, but a little more elongated, the wood floor, which is also known as the jambonet. The triangle could have variations The pool rack full of afro hair. You see that with the rack of balls on a pool table? Full of afro, the 70's earth mama muff. They also call that. But we don't come across many of those these days. I just have one question for Laura. In all of those descriptions, has at least one fit the bill? Yes. Laura, you understand the rules. You rub the phone as per our instructions. We didn't get to know Laura a little bit, what she looks like, where she's calling from. Sometimes no. Judging from her voice, I say yes. Laura, where are you? New Jersey. I'm in my house. All alone? Yes, I'm in my room. Mommy downstairs? No. How old are you? 24. What do you look like? I'm 5'5", about 115 pounds. Reddish brown hair, less than it. Boob size? 38C. What kind of panties you have? Victoria's Secret, thong. Thong, that's telling. That's very telling. That's why we like to get to know the contestants. Vaginas! What? Baby blue. See? Now I have the picture. Now all we need is a little audio. The panties have to slip off. Yes, they are. Remember Laura, after you rub, as per our instructions, you don't give the answer until we ask you. Everybody has given their guesses. So Laura, if you would please first up and down. Okay, here I go. Now side to side. Now if you would please in a circular motion. Barry, do you need to hear anymore? No, I think I've got it. Barry, as a guest of the show, your guest will be first. Suddenly I just want to work for AT&T. I think with the up and down, it seemed to be pretty constant. Then when we went side by side, it was kind of smooth, furry, smooth. And then when we went circular, it was smooth, furry, smooth, furry. So I'm just going to go out on a limb here and say Mohawk. Mohawk is my guess. That is my final answer. Okay. Don't tell us yet. I'm going to need another pass. I was thinking of myself. If you would please side to side once again. I hear what he's saying. I need a circular one last time. You need a circular? Interesting. Can I go? You're saying wood floor. Thinking that what he was hearing, what Barry was hearing, was maybe labia. That could be a wood floor. I'm going to make a guess. It might not be popular, but it didn't sound like enough volume for a wood floor. But it did sound kind of constant aside from maybe some folds in there. No, natural ones. I'm going to say triangle. Yes, not a popular one. Maybe trimmed up, but still the same shape. So what do we got now? We know she's trying, but she wouldn't be on the phone. She's wearing Victoria's Secret panties, so she takes care of that area. It's kind of hard. It's like putting a little bonnet on the link from the Mod Squad. Putting Victoria's Secret on something un-groomed. It would look like she's making Jiffy Pop popcorn in her underwear. Barry, what was your guess? I'm sticking with it. Mohawk. Okay, Laura, what's in your pants? A wood floor. Oh, Opie got it. You guys were listening to a 5 o'clock shadow. Just this morning. That's why I didn't hear the volume I usually hear on a wood floor. You should be proud. Very good. I haven't worn one in a long time there. Laura, can you mail the phone into the... I'll press it against my chin and then let it have it. I was going to say that phone has something in common with Barry's chin. And you have to get some more world stickers in New Jersey. I'm just waiting to wow and I haven't seen any yet. But as soon as you see the wow on the car on the highway, you will whip them out for us. Very good. Well, Laura, thanks for playing What's in My Pants. Celebrity. Yes, I'm so happy. Very good. Bye. It's time to play. It's time to play. It's time to play. Hey, guess what's in my pants. Vagina. It's time to play. It's time to play. It's time to play. Hey, guess what's in my pants. Very nice. Very nice with Barry Williams. You do this type of radio every day, right, Barry? I just wanted to get down here and share it all with you. All my good fortune and stuff. Just another afternoon drive home. Sure. Hey, how's it going, man? Great. We're having fun today. Cool. Hey, the Brady sucked, but I liked Greg. He was pretty cool. That's pretty good. Hey, man, what happened to Oliver? Oh, who cares? Oliver. He grew up to be John Denver. Exactly. Did you ever smack him? What a bad idea. That's when it really took a turn. I mean, you knew from the first episode, our show was going off the air. Why are they bringing him in? That was one of those ideas. They wanted to young up the subjects of the episode. Young it up? Yeah, they started, like you guys were starting a little old. Here's what's interesting. He is, Robbie Wriste is his name. He's actually a cool guy. He's an alternative rocker, for real. They all turn into punk rockers. He absolutely is. He's got three colors of hair. He plays for alternative bands on the LA band circuit. Oh, really? And he does voices for cartoons. Bob Reed must have loved him. As a matter of fact, Bob didn't like him on the show. It wrecked the story more than Bob thought it was ruined before. It was terrible. Then we really went over the edge. Let's go to John. John, what's going on? Hey, how are you doing? I wanted to ask Greg a question. In the Hawaiian episode, you were talking about the Did he spray a map of Hawaii on Marsha's back so he could find his way around the islands? Leave a map of Hawaii on Marsha's back? Did you hear that term? The important thing is you can't just spray Oahu. With her you've got to use Maui. Somebody wants to know, Greg, does Marsha's carpet match the drapes? Oh, blonde? Yeah, in a word, yes. In a word, yes. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. In a word, yes. This always comes up. I get all shivery again. Let's go to Tom. Tom, what's going on? I just wanted to tell you guys that you guys are like the WWF. You've got all the cool guys and all the new stuff. Barry was on that old guy show. I don't want to say his name, but he didn't have him do nothing. Now he's on your show. He's freaking hysterical. Barry's funny, man. He's killing me. We're like, all right, we'll just do five minutes with him and get him out of here. Oh, yeah. He's just going to come down and throw a little bit of a back of my face. No problem. You're right. Well, thanks for that, Tom. Thanks, Tom. Yeah, man. That was just a joke. Question for Barry. What we really want to know is about young Oliver. No. Did Mike Brady have a camera underneath the trampoline? That old gag. You were the one who was underneath the Brady staircase an hour ago. I always thought, because the backs weren't on the stairs, that they were built so you could see up the girls' dresses. It was built for you so that you could see the girls' dresses. From the first episode I thought that, I was like, God, I can't believe I got to go upstairs. I got to tell you something. I went back and we filmed this growing up Brady movie. It was going to be on Sunday. We created that entire set, including the stairs without the backs and steps. That was the most popular spot on Paramount Studios. We had secretaries and people and visitors and dignitaries. Everybody wanted to jump on that staircase and take a picture. It was hysterical. Yeah, it was. And size order. I don't mind telling you that I was underneath that staircase looking up. You are. See? I know it. This says it all. I can't believe I'm saying this. Greg Brady is pretty f'ing cool. I'm sort of like your listeners. Sure. They're hard to come around, but once they do, faithful. Faithful to the end. That's nice. I'll take faithful. Let's go to Ken real fast. Ken, what's up? What's up? Shut that radio off, god damn it. What do you got for Barry? What happened to Dog? We can cross the street. Flower truck? No more Tiger. Tiger. Oh, come on. It'd be 180. Save your tears, okay? He'd be dragging his butt across the carpet at this point. They had to bring in a fake dog to finish the episode too. That happened in one of the episodes that Tiger was in. That's how I remember the Flea Powder episode. Oh yeah. We had two Tigers. One in the beginning of the show and one when we were saying goodbye. Oh, in the middle of the episode. I was strapped into the sound stage and did nothing. Are all of you pooling your money to pay off people to keep from putting on the Brady Variety Hour that was on during the episode? We're pooling our money to bring a lawsuit against everybody involved so we can get some more money out of it. Jesus. They run these things 100,000 times. Just a nickel, folks, would be good. Right. Help us out. I'd take a nickel. That Brady Variety Hour was on? Oh my god. They were singing and dancing and doing little skits? We had the coolest guests. Tina Turner was on. Farrah Fossey was there. They'd pop them in these Brady... You would call each other by your Brady Bunch names. Which is better, don't you think? You don't want to get tagged doing that stuff. I did it. It was Craig. It was Craig in that jumpsuit. There he uses tag. Oh, by myself. Oh, by myself. Oh, by myself. Oh, by myself. Oh, by myself. Oh, by myself. They were singing popular songs for the time. Very badly. Faded from the past. You had great choreography, too. Covered up with lines and creases. Tickets torn in half. Did you go through any drug phase or anything like any of the childhood stars usually do? No. It was a good one. No. Not me, man. You didn't find me in the sidewalk waking up after a long Saturday night, Sunday morning. That never happened for me. Now straight arrow all the way. Sure. I had my rebellious period. That's what I refer to that period. My rebellious period. You came out of it well, Barry. Thank you. Once I got the debts paid off and the bets were all good, that helped a lot. Now that I have officially put the Brady Bunch behind me, check out the movie. It's going to be so sailing. We should get you out of here, man. It has been real. This has been a thrill for us. Absolutely excellent. There's a bunch of things going on. The movie is Sunday, NBC 9 o'clock, but tomorrow you can meet Barry Williams for yourself. He'll sign everything. He'll sign the Growing Up Brady book, the Brady Bravo CD, Balloon Knot. Don't forget, ladies, that Wild Wednesday extends all the way through tomorrow morning this week only. Do you want beer too? Beer and boobs? I don't think I need to get too early for it. 10.30, Barry swinging beer. That's all he needs. In some sense, that's known as beer 30. I think I'm going to pass on that. I want people to be able to read my name. If you had fun today, go support Barry Williams tomorrow. He's going to be at the NBC Experience Rockefeller Plaza 10.30 tomorrow. Be there. I'm a guy named Opie. He was hosting very boring radio. It was lame and we get sad. On Long Island. And he was all alone. It's the story of lazy Anthony. Who was knocking tin and living in his car. He was very drunk and always high. A very funny guy. And then one day when these losers met each other. They disappeared. And then one day when these losers met each other. They disappeared. And then one day when these losers met each other. They decided to make a better plan. Let's make a living watching porno. And getting women to whip out their cans. O and A. It's O and A. That's the way they became O and A. Anywhere in the middle of a break. Oh, he's just listening to Johnny's band. I know there's a lot of faithful listeners still listening. Yes.

I'm going to be a chicken. Ah. One of the sales guys. The sales guys that come down here and say goodbye at the end of the day. Yeah. One of the guys he was, uh, he was bitching and complaining to Anthony because he's got to go home and watch the final episode of 90210. I guess that's happening tonight? Yeah. 8 o'clock. 8 o'clock tonight? And, uh, the final episode. He's all bummed and stuff because, uh, the lady in his life of course wants to see 90210. The final episode. So he's like, I'm not looking forward to it. I'm just going to... Who cares? This sucks. I've got to go. And I'm like, then why are you watching it? And he's like, well, you know, she's, she's... She, uh, you know, she wants to see, uh, 90210. And then he goes to me, you have that problem at home? And I'm like, no, that's why you get two TVs. Ah, yeah. You just get two TVs. But then you're not hanging. And then the final episode of 90210. It's like, you watch this... What, that show? I thought we were talking about 90210. Oh, whatever. 90210. 902... 6-12-5. Why do you have to, like, hang out and watch TV together if you're in a relationship? I mean, if it's something you both want to watch, that's one thing. So you could watch a show and put your hands down each other's pants. You're just a horny dog, man. I'm just not used to the new Antennae. Why? Anyway. No, I'm happy for you, Anthony. I'm just not used to it. Never talked like this when you were, uh... Whatever. Anyway. I was very busy on the computer. Yes, I know. Anyway, I haven't played a computer game at home in months. And that's all you used to do is the radio show and computer games. Yeah, go figure that one out. But now you're playing What's in My Pants? The home version. Yeah. Go on, laugh. That was funny. It only cost me half. The sales guy's bitching and complaining. I understand when it's something you both want to watch, but like Sandy and I, it's an understanding. She'll watch that. I mean, she's not even going to watch that. But you go, look, you watch that. I'm going upstairs and watching the Knicks. I'll see you at 11 for the news. Whatever. Right. I don't know. I guess he's pee-whipped out there. And he's going to have to sit there and watch it like he's interested? Yeah. Oh, I have to... Naked! They're yelling at him now. He's too scared to come in now because he's going to get in trouble. I'd rather watch something else if she wants to watch it. He probably watches the Lifetime Channel too. Ah, that's the worst. You've got to get an adult block in the Lifetime Channel. The Lifetime Channel. What? Now you're in trouble because now the lady knows which sales guy it was. What? We just told the whole 90210 thing. The two-hour episode you're going to see tonight? The final episode? You told the world I'm a wussy? You're going to have to sit there and watch it? I can't believe it. She makes me. Don't you have two TVs? She makes me sit there with her and watch it. Now you've seen a few episodes so you know what's happening, right? Not really. Yeah, you do. No. No Rose Place I knew. It's supposed to be a tearjerker so you're going to comfort her? Isn't Star Trek on tonight? Why don't you have two TVs? We do but she makes me sit there. She makes me sit there. What do you mean? What if you go to get up to do something? I ask her, can I get up and do something? Oh my God. This is what we have to look forward to? Does she give you your penis back when you get home? Is it waiting for you on the kitchen table? Yeah. Oh, that is funny. Can I get up and go do something else? No. Gary, we feel bad for you. I bet you half the guys that are listening to the station are going to be forced to watch that tonight. Well, you might be right. There's tough competition tonight. The Knicks are playing. Yeah. I thought you were going to say Ali McBeal. I don't watch any of that crap. What guy has to sit there and watch Ali McBeal because this chick does? Come on. I'm disappointed in Opie. If it's true, I don't know. Opie just sits there and waxes it to NASCAR Racing. Well, I don't like NASCAR. That's a great story. We haven't told that story in a while. Did you hear that story? That's when you got caught, right? Yeah, Sandy goes to bed, right? I just needed to go and play with my yam bag. So, I mean, we got so much fine porno around here. I brought one of them home, snuck it home. I had to sneak a lot of it home. And she went to bed and waited like the, you know, the 15 minutes. I made sure she was out cold and I put the porno in. I'm on the couch with a blanket, right? And I went to town, sure. And all of a sudden, Sandy had a bad dream. It came back downstairs. She had a dream that someone was spanking it down stairs. So, I heard her at the last second. I was able to grab the remote and quickly turn off the porn. Now I'm under this blanket on the couch. The remote, the other remote, because this was for the VCR, was way across the room. And what was on the tube? NASCAR Racing. And Opie never watches NASCAR. Ever, ever, ever. So now I'm sitting there looking guilty as hell under this blanket, obviously nude, watching NASCAR Racing. All sweaty. And she finally put two and two together. She looks at me and she starts telling me that she had a bad dream. And all of a sudden she looks at the TV and goes, wait, this doesn't look right. So then she looks back at me, looks at the TV, and then runs upstairs all pissed off. She figured it out, yeah. Well, have fun with 90210. Oh, what? Go, Dale Earnhardt! Go! Hey, Fred, what do you want to say to Gary? He's a friggin' what? Dude, you gotta be kidding me, man. What are you talking about? Are you serious? Did you ever watch any of those? Hello? Oh, wait, I gotta turn this off. Now I can talk to you. Did you ever watch any of those episodes? They're great. Oh, come on, man. Yeah, I know. We look up to this Gary guy here in the studio. Dude, Anthony's got it. Dude, you got two TVs, you watch the other one. There's a couple guys that have to do the same thing tonight. Jeff, what's going on? Hey guys, what's up? Faithful, let's go. Love you guys, but I gotta confess that I am watching 90210 tonight and I'm going to tape it. Because my girlfriend wants to see it because she's working. So I'll probably spend more nights watching it as well. I'm not wussing out on you guys, but I'm just saying. It's not a bad show. I love it. It takes a real man to admit it. Oh yeah, that's it, Gary. John, what's going on? Hey, how's it going? My old lady used to make me watch it with her. And what you do is you sit there and just bitch and complain about every little episode. And just be like, this is BS. Who cares? And eventually she'll be so pissed off that you're watching it with her that she'll just be like, I don't even want you to watch it with me. Just watch your show on the other TV. 902, home-o. Yeah, you gotta draw the line there. Alright, over and out, precious. Lewis, what's up? Lewis? Yeah, man. Watch what this pussy-whipped jack-off. I can't believe it. He's going to watch 902, home-o? Hurry up, I gotta get home because he's waiting for me. Yeah, just out of curiosity, do you also nip on the weekends when you have spare time? Your freaking wuss bag? He's watching it with his chick. Yeah, he's watching it with his chick. He's watching his chick. Hey, you want to know how to get out of it? You moron. I can't believe you're watching 902, one-o. This guy's better. Oh man, 902, one-o? Why don't you just go ride your tricycle in the street, you home-o? Boy. God, you're almost as bad as that big wuss Precious there. Who's your favorite, Gary? Jason Priestley or Luke Perry? Oh, sorry, Dad, I mean to cut you off. Doug, what's going on? Hey, how you guys doing? Gary, can you make change of a nine dollar bill? What is this, 902, one-o? Are you kidding me? Alright, man. Be a man. Later. Hey, Wood from Yonkers. Gary, on Thursday I'll be watching SmackDown. Can you tape Popular for me? I can't, I'm watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson's Creek. Very special, Dawson's Creek. No one's life will be the same after this episode. Well, someone wants to confess here on our show. Doug, what's going on? Hey guys, how you doing? I am a 902, one-o, Ali McBeal sufferer. Ali McBeal? I don't think I've ever watched an episode. I got a bargain to get WWF on. Okay, alright, I'll switch to commercials, I swear. It's horrible. I think the only time I got roped into the Ali McBeal was for the Lesbo Kiss episode. It sucked so bad, I was totally pissed off that I even bought the hype. Yeah, because it looked like that lady was making out with a scarecrow. Yeah, she is kind of twiggy. Yeah, I'm not into that. But you're an Ali McBeal 902, one-o sufferer. I am a sufferer. Alright, man. Thank you. Thanks. I'm hugging a bag of chips. Just hear it crack. Oh, I broke your spine, sorry. This guy Lenny's got to go to a 902, one-o party. Lenny! Yeah, I've got to go to a stupid party for this stupid show. I'm going to bring a casserole. Why didn't you get out earlier? I'm trying to go see that U-Boat movie instead. Chips, dips and butts. You got it. I'm trying to... maybe I'll do a power outage. Blow up a fuse box or something. Alright, Lenny. Alright, guys. Are they all going to dress like their favorite characters? Hey, Greg, you got some advice for Gary? Yeah, you want to get out of watching those shows, sit there for every single one of them and tell your girl what filthy, terrible things you want to do to every girl in that show with your penis. Describe every little detail and they will throw you out of that room so fast you won't know what hit you. She'd never believe me because it was that girl, Donna. I still got bruises to show for it. Alright, Greg, thank you. No problem. Let's go to Larry real fast. Larry, what's up? Hey, Larry. Alright, what's up, buddy? There is what you got to do. You got to tell this guy to spend some of his money and put a TV in every room. And you got to get a good one in your living room with picture in picture. You swap back and forth so many times that your wife will get up and go on strike because she's so pissed off. But then you get to stay in your own living room. This guy is getting pushed out of the King's room. Unbelievable. Who pays for the house? You or your wife? Wow, that's another story. Come on. You got to spray glue with some cash. Picture in picture. You'll drive a baddie. And then you screw it and you leave the picture on. You put the sound on to the Yankee game and she'll run out of there. Take it easy, ONA. Do shout. Oh, am I missing Felicity? Yeah. Rob, what's up? Hey, guys. How are you doing? Hey, Gary. I don't want to blow your cover, but let me just tell you guys. I work at one of your sister stations in the sales department. I know what Gary is. I'm just amazed that a man of his power in the CBS empire is so pussy with it. It's sad. It's just what he said. I mean, I don't know if you know who this is. I'm at FAN. I've had many conversations with you about opportunities. I was even thinking of looking up to you one day and even working for you, but now... Just don't tell everybody about it. ...I'm going to go grab a scoop ice cream. Thank you, Rob. Rob on our phones here at the fan. I'm going to end the calling. Wow, this is a twist. This lady... I've got to get home and watch 90210. This is a twist. Marybeth. What's up, Marybeth? Yeah, hi. My husband is making me come home from work early tonight so I can watch 90210 with him. That's in the water. Wow, that's a little weird. What are you going to do after that? Put the strap on? Get behind him? I didn't realize that show was still on. Actually, we... Didn't that show end like two, three weeks ago? Yeah, it was. No, actually, I've been watching it since forever. I was like, I really don't care. I want to stay at work. He's like, no, come home. We've got to watch the last episode together. And I'm like, all right, I'll come home. So I'm going to come home from work early so I can watch the last episode of 90210. He's probably cooking quiche right now for you. Actually, I have to bring home McDonald's. All right, Marybeth, thank you. Let's go to Barry, another 90210 sufferer. This was just supposed to be a quick one. I'm going to go to Barry. This was just supposed to be a quick little thing. It seems a lot of people are in this boat. It's become this. Barry, what's up? Yeah, I hope Gary doesn't think he's got it bad there. I only got one TV in the house. My torture starts on Tuesday with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, then it's 90210, then on Thursday it's Popular and Charmed. Oh my God! On the fag network! What if you want to watch something else? What if you want to put the Hitler Channel on and watch him throw some Howitzer shells at people? I've got to wait for commercials, man. Oh, wow. Justin from Deer Park has a good idea for you, Gary. Maybe Gary can have Spaz shutdown Fox's power grid. All right, guys. Thank you. Bye, man. Sounds like fun, Gary. Yeah, well, you better rush home. Yeah, I'm going to go home. She's cooking now. No, really. We still look up to you. You've got to make the salad, put a little apron on. We still look up to you, though, Gary. Things won't change. No. Then I have to make the bed. Next on Felicity. Wow. Victor! You're on the air, man. I've got a great idea to keep her from watching the show. Just give her a karate chop to the back of her head. Knock her out for two hours. And watch the game during the whole time. Come on! Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It's just... I'm driving. I'm going to crash. Yeah, you better watch yourself. I don't like you almost so I crashed you. All right, Gary. All right, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. I've got to run. Yeah, you get home. I don't want to be late. I feel sorry for you, man, because she listens to this show, too. You don't really want to watch 90210 with me, do you? No. I heard you on the radio. We'd have a private night together. Who's this one? What's this guy here on the show? And what does she want? How did this one get in this position? Would you shut up? I'm trying to enjoy the last episode. Why is this one mad at this one? Yeah, but this girl's hot. Why? All right. What else is going on tonight, guys? We've got people so pissed off at us. Why? Line 4. I've heard this for days and days. Mike, what's going on? You guys let... Yes, last night before you went off the air, you were like, we're going to tell you guys about Rick's car and then you just ignore it. Yeah, see?

Tomorrow? We said today! Why tomorrow, Rick? Yeah, why tomorrow, Rick? If you have a good reason, we'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, because it could take a little while. Oh. It would cut down on his hair. Now people are going to think we're teasing again. It will take some time, though. Yeah. All right. You won't hold it against us if, Mike, we say tomorrow? All right. You guys definitely do it tomorrow. Well, we really forgot because Barry Williams... We did two and a half solid hours with him. We did the, you know, Nicky from We Deliver Keggers. You know?
