 You're listening to OPM Anthony's year in review, 1027, MWNEW. I like, I like, I like small boys. The OPM Anthony Show. You are officially out of control! You're breaking. 1027. M-E-W. Oh my God. Ha ha ha, you hear it? Does anybody hear you? When did you sneak into the studio? When I brought you a bottle of champagne. For what? You know that you want to patrick you and you'd be out of here. Oh, look at that. Anthony rules, man. I don't care what you say about him. By the way, I need a card tonight too. Good ball. My truck is still, is still laid up. Because I took it in for the tires opening. Yeah. You know my exploding firestone tires on my SUV? Yeah, exploding firestone tires. Yeah, all of a sudden, the guy that's, he runs a check on the vehicle, whatever. He goes, oh, there's a couple of other recalls that have popped up that I just forgot about or didn't get the notice on. The cruise control cable tends to stick, that make the throttle stick even when the cruise control is off. Thank you, Mercury. Also, the hood latch. That's been recalled too. And of course, the exploding tires. So theoretically, I could be driving down the West Side Highway. The throttle will stick, the hood will flop open, and my tires will explode. And it'll just be a fabulous day for everyone involved. That could be a cool new contest. Yeah. And my wiper motor doesn't work, my driver's side door lock. And of course, I'm not under warranty anymore. And were you like me though? When I had my Blazer, when these recalls came in the mail, I just threw them away. Yeah, I really don't care. There's like a new recall every other month. It's like, ah, whatever. What are the odds going to happen to me? And unless you get a letter that says, we have a recall. Instead of an airbag, we put like a spike in your steering column. So if you hit something, a big spike will come out and stab you in the head. And even then, I'd be like, I can feel when I hit me. I might not hit something. Yeah, oh, the seats, we've made the seat filling out of a nitroglycerin. So if you hit a bump, it could just explode. And you'll be up all right. Well, no, and I don't even get drive. I'll miss the bump. I don't even get past that point. You know what it says? Recall, and then you have to read to figure out what's going on. Like for exploding tires, it should say recall and just in huge letters, exploding tires. Right. But if it's like stupid windshield wiper might whatever. Yeah, it's like, oh, the wiper might not work in the rain. Don't bother me. I could deal with that. It's working now. Who cares? Exactly right. But exploding tires, it should be right on the envelope. Recall, exploding tires, open now. No, no, they didn't want to even word it that way. The recall, and I never got a recall notice for my exploding tires, mind you. I just heard about it on the news. And all the numbers came out. I can't win an effing lotto. I can't, I buy lotto tickets. I play that God effing crack in the bars. That, what is it called? Quick draw. I can't hit worth of crap, but I sure hit on those tires when I took the numbers out to my truck and looked at it. Oh, wait a minute. I even got the bonus number. They just explode in park. I can't win a lotto though. Too funny. Yeah, so they're still working on it, Anthony. So if you can hook me up. Thank you. Karen, what's going on? Hi, guys. How you doing? Good. Good. Anthony, I want to talk to you about the recall on your car. Yes. One of the many. One of the many recalls. I'm a lucky owner of a Ford Explorer and got the same recalls that you did. And let me tell you, you can't win for losing with that company. Oh my God. It's a joke. How the hell do you put out a vehicle or anything for that matter that doesn't work? They're broken. They're selling you broken goods. And then these recall things are just patchwork. Oh, it's ridiculous. They're not locked in. The acronym Ford is just a fair daily. The Explorer was our first that we ever owned. Well, this is everything. They try to get these. It happens with everything. With cars, they try to get the new models done, designed, built, and out there before competition does so they put out inferior goods. It happens with cars. It happened. Remember that game I got yesterday? Oh, be Crimson Skies. What's the problem with that? Microsoft's new game. You already have a problem with it? Well, when I got home and loaded it onto my computer, it was crashing my computer every time I tried to play it. So I go to their website, their official website, nothing. I go to the fan site. There are a list of message boards complaining that this is the buggiest program of a game that has been out yet. They get it out there because they have to get it out and sell it quickly to make their money back. So they put out a game that isn't done. It's buggy. It hasn't been debugged. And then they say, well, in a couple of weeks, we'll have a patch for you. A patch. All these games that they put out now that are buggy, you know that they're putting out and that in weeks to come, you're going to have to download patches. So it was crashing my computer. I couldn't even play the god-effing thing. Did you set it back yet? No, I'll wait for the patch. I'm an idiot. But you know something? For somebody that doesn't make a lot of money, that goes out and spends 50 bucks on these games, you want to play the goddamn thing. You don't want to sit and wait for a patch. Microsoft, suck ass. Suck ass. It's inconvenient enough to get a notice from a company saying that they have a recall on a cruise control or a door latch or something like that. How many times are you going to bring it in? How many times do you have to bring in this goddamn truck? When these companies announce a recall on a truck or a car, they should show up at your goddamn house and fix it. Fix it at my house. You're absolutely right. Two days without my truck. And if I would have brought it in as the recalls came in, this would have been the fourth time I would have had to bring my truck in and leave it there for God knows how long. I just happened to blow the recalls off and now they're doing it all at once. Well, we shouldn't announce something that's wrong because the day after we drove it off the lot, we used the back windshield wiper for the first time and the thing flew off the car. Thank you. We had to bring the car back to the company for that. Well, my rear windshield wiper doesn't work. They have to fix that. My driver's side door lock? Why? I unlock the car door? Every other lock goes up except my driver's door. So now I have to open the back door and reach over and grab it like I'm driving a 56 Rambler. You know? What is this? The General Lee? I got to jump through the window? Yee-haw, boss hog! Well, at this point, we're hoping that the tires explode because we just need to be put out of our misery with dealing with this guy. Yeah, I think the lucky ones are the ones that died. I guess, yeah. They want to make it a hassle to bring the car in because they don't want to lose all that goddamn money to fix your car. Firestone's blaming Ford. Ford's blaming Firestone. They're all in cahoots. F them all. I'm going to get a bicycle. They take forever to fix anything with it. We had the hose for the windshield wiper fluid came undone. So every time we put windshield wiper fluid in it, it would just drain right out the bottom of the car. So we get it fixed. They fill it up. They said no problem. I'm in the parking lot. I'm putting all the paperwork in the glove compartment and I go to use windshield wiper fluid and there's nothing in there. It drained all on again. The hose came right off like it had done before. And I drove it back around into the service entrance and they told me I had to make another appointment and leave my car for another three hours to get it fixed. Great. You know, and it's like... You know, just... On my car. On my car. I'm on a ball and motor all the time. You have better luck with yours. All right. Thank you, Karen. You know what the bottom line is? If you got these firestone tires on your Ford, yes, you're screwed. Just drive into the service center like you're some kind of a Hezbollah. Oh, yeah. Allah! Just drive into the side of the service center. Allah! Someone's about to go postal on one of those service centers. I need to phone up to it. It's not me. I'm talking to someone else in soon. All right, Karen. Thanks a lot, guys. Oh, my God. Very good. Someone's got to recall her jaw that keeps running even after you try to shut it off. Bill, you're next on WNEW. What's happening, guys? Hey, man. I bought one of those 98 ML320 Mercedes. A Mercedes? Yeah. Yeah. Which you would assume would run well. The day I drove it out of... Wait, wait. Hey, wait. Do you have a Mercedes? Yes. That's not true. Yeah, you're listening to us. They say our listeners don't drive Mercedes. We're just dealing. Well, let's not discuss that. So what happened? It's driving out of the lot the following day. It's a rainy day. I go to push... You know, they have the automatic push down on the window. Window won't go up. Would not go up. Pouring rain out of the lot. A recall? No. Two years later, it's happened four times over the last two years. Which had to be replaced six times. Six separate times. They put out inferior goods just to get it out there. Well, they built a car in Alabama. I would love to know what a Mercedes recall notice would look like. A wedding invitation, you know? You are cordially invited to bring your car to a service center. You know, I was... You have a bit of a problem with the ignition system. That was another problem I had. I drove it in front of the door of the dealership, locked it, took the keys and put it in the car and had my wife drive me home and I left it there. The service centers are just hailing by all this. So they are not giving you the best service. No. And then what they did is if you had Mercedes, they tell you to call Mercedes. Like the corporation because each office... What is your problem? Exactly. Mercedes did not put out inferior goods? That's what the guy sounded like. Of course. They are all a bunch of reformed Nazis. They tell you if you have a problem with the service department, you call Mercedes and they'll straighten it out. I'm sorry we were only following orders. We put in the ignition wrong because we were told to. Where are the pensers? They are supposed to be at Normandy. Anyway, the guy loses his effing mind on the phone. I cannot wait to see her. He is the only one that can release the pensers. We need to have to get the pensers to Normandy. Yeah, well basically. It's an ongoing... I'm just waiting to find out that the tires are going to fall off the damn thing. The poor guy. You are driving your Mercedes to get fixed. He bites a cyanide cap. It's above the visor. They didn't tell you that since there. Alright guys. But it's a recall, right? Hello? Who is this? Yep, bring it in next week. Yeah? Something with a drag train? Really? There are some happy, happy Mercedes people right there at the last sales meeting. Alright, later guys. Thank you. Alright, we gotta take a quick break. We'll be back. 212-757-1027. Wow. OP. What did you learn on the show today? Really, not too much there. Really beautiful anyway. What did you learn on the show today? I learned absolutely nothing. I actually lost brain cells today. What did you learn on the show today? What I learned today, this bit still sucks. The OP and Anthony Show. Back to you. Shut up. My God, listen to this people. We gotta go right to Old Dirty Anthony. Yeah. What I, what I, what I learned. Wow, Old Dirty. What I learned. Old Dirty, how many minutes left on your card? We made you wait a long time there. I got to this lady's phone line from upstairs. I got unlimited calls, my brother. I gotta explain Old Dirty to the brand new listeners. He's not BSing when he says all this stuff. No, this is how he gets through life. This is how he gets by. He hasn't had a job since he left prison. Eight months ago, he left prison. It's going to be a year. This is my prison. It's already a year. A year already? Yeah. You're out of the joint a year and you still don't have a job. No, I got a job. But I got a job. What are you doing? Yo, I got a job with a major telecommunications. Again? Yeah, but another one though. Another one? Yeah. It starts with an L. Yeah, an L. Losing your life. Losing your life. Losing your life. Losing your life. You're an idiot. Loosen? Yeah, yo. Loosen technologies? Yeah. I'm selling my stuff. How do you say? Everyone sell your stuff. Yeah. I got a beat for about the Olympics too, my man. All right, hold on a sec. Yeah. Woo. Sorry. All right, so you have something about the Olympics? Yeah, yo. Yeah, you'd be feeling that DMX. Yeah. It's a good thing you got a chance to win. Yeah. I'm going to go with a good one. Yeah. The good one. Yeah. The good one. Yeah. The good one. The good one. The good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You'd be feeling that DMX, right? Yeah. I like that song a lot. You know what I'm saying? That's pretty cool. You find yourself singing that when you're in traffic. Yeah, yo. Yeah. What's up with all this swimming, man? Every time you turn the candle, they're swimming. The Olympics. The 4K, the V.A. Polo. I thought Rob Floan was going to be in the pool. They're going to play water polo. Right. They're playing with a ball trying to shoot it into a net. What kind of game is this, man? What's your life like? What's up to? You want to be our Olympic spokesperson for the Olympics? That's my word. I'll be watching my word. This is your new job there. Wait a minute. We want you to watch every day and you report back what's going on with the Olympics. Yeah, bro. Don't you think that listeners would be better served if I get a first class ticket to Sydney and catch them live? You're always conniving. You know what? I would consider that, but I know you would freaking sell that ticket. You know I wouldn't. Yeah, you'd go. Oh, there it is. Why don't they have a wilding, a pool wilding event? That's what that is. Where they get around a girl, get her in the whirlpool. Remember that old gag in the city pool? There you have it. Get them in the whirlpool. They should have like a grumping Olympic event, yo. Yeah. How many groups per second? It's a Puerto Rican Day parade. All right. So you don't like the water polo because you think Ralph Laurence should be in it? You know what? I don't get it, man. You don't like all this swimming that's going on. Yeah. What's up with all this? What's up with all this swimming? Yeah, but did you see the volleyball yesterday? No. No. Yo, they be wearing some tight hats. Yo, they be wearing some tight shorts up in that piece, man. Yeah, but then the volleyball chicks are pretty good. They got some big legs, too. Yeah. Yeah, B. How about, did you watch all the swimming? Yeah, man. I'm water-loved. I'm tired of watching swimming. Oh, very. Did you see Misty Hyman? Yeah. Misty Hyman from the U.S. upsetting Australia and winning. I guess it was that butterfly or the flopper. Yeah, yo. Yeah, she won the gold, right? Yeah, she won the gold last night. They showed it. Misty Hyman. Yep. I hope. The best name ever. What kind of shrugs were her parents on? Coming in second, Foggy Snacks. And of course, partly cloudy gash. Coming in third for the bronze. Yo, but speaking of swimming, man, they might as well have the camera on the water all the time, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. See the puffy vagus flowing in the pool. My God. Misty Hyman, though. Come on. Misty Hyman. Who else wasn't cracking up when they saw that on the tube? Yo, and then they have equestrian. I mean, why should the guy ride in the horse with a medal? The horse should get some great A type A or something. You know what I'm saying? What about the decathlon? Yeah, 10 events. The decathlon. 10 events. Yeah, isn't that like the decathlon is in it? Like you should participate in 10 events like the javelin and then the running and all that other crap. Yeah, you got a few things. You got to do the pole vault and a few other things. Yeah. Yep. Hey, who's that announcer they got for the mention? Yeah, who? Tim Baggott. Oh, my God. Tim Baggott. You know what I'm saying? Oh, my God. Did you hear him just drooling? Yo, we're going to see another wonderful routine now. Hi, I'm Tim Baggott. Hi, I'm Tim Baggott. And this is wonderful. This reminds me of four years ago, this routine. Look at the way he's working the mat on this one. I've worked mat too. I remember Matt, Jim, and Bob and all of them. This is wonderful. With the music in the background. Yes, it's fantastic. Look at how he's doing on the pommel horse. Look at that, the way he grabs it with his hands and mounts it. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he's looking at his unit, B. Him, Daggett. Yes, I love when they walk off the mat and you can see their junk. That's the best part of the Olympic event. I bet you he gets into the Russians kissing on the lips. Oh, man. Oh, not bad. I thought they were going to be stuck tonguing. I thought they were like one of these tough, timiness nations. Yeah, it's over over there, Johnny. Yeah, but they've been kissing for a long time. That's true. Yeah, they've been kissing on the lips. Yeah. They like that. They're not as hung up, Opie. They're not as hung up as us Americans. Yeah, that's why they... Men can just walk up and kiss on the lips. That's wonderful, isn't it? That's why they got that undefeatable form of tuberculosis, B. Yeah, on the real. Yo, Ant, on the real. Yo, you a Brooklyner, son. On the real. Yo, you better wear like a mask and all that, yo. You better drive with your windows up with that Ford, whatever you got. There's a lot of Ruskies where I live, sure. And Brooklyn's got a lot of Ruskies. Yeah, yo, you know, not just in the Russians and everything, but you know, like, their medical advancement ain't like over here. They got some undefeatable form of TB, son. Yo, you better wear gloves. Yo, Anthony, B. Yeah. You better wear like a whole... You better just put yourself in a bag. I'll be the boy in the plastic bubble. That's what you need, bro. Yo, what else I was going to tell you? About the Olympics? Wait, while you get your thoughts together, a great instant feedback coming in from the English language. Yo, where are you? I quit. Between Clubs Soda Canyon and Old Dirty making a mockery of me, I officially quit. The English language actually emailing. I didn't realize the English language wasn't for the show, Anthony. Yo, on the real, man. Yeah. Let me tell you, yo, but, oh, yo, did you see the midget that was weightlifting? Yeah, I did. Dude, he's holding that back 30, and he was pushing up some weight that was like 430 pounds. Yeah, you know, and those announcers are saying snatch a lot. Yeah, yeah. The women have to actually do the lift called the snatch. Yeah, and they're like, The lift called the snatch. Yeah, it's called the sniff and snatch. No, just it's the, I don't know, what is it called? The clean and snatch. No, they got the clean and jerk. And then they got the snatch. Clean, jerk, snatch. Yo, you got to kill because you got to pardon me, B. Yeah, why? What's wrong? The high school girls are calling out here. You hear the cops? What's going on there? Yeah, you know, there's little ruckus going down the block. Ain't nothing. Ain't nothing. Ain't nothing. Yeah, the 10th graders and the 9th graders is coming out. Boy, you got, my goodness. Looking good. You got to make a videotape, my man. 10th graders and 9th graders in your neighborhood, what is that, 25, 26 years old? Childbearing age. Childbearing age. Childbearing age. Hey, old dirty, one more thing before we let you go. Hi, baby. Ewing, traded. Yo, you ain't, and I heard you happy, man. You ain't grateful, mother, after all. What? Come on, man. 13 years the man took us to the playoffs, man. They never built the team around the brother, man. I know your math is bad, but it was 15. All right, man, 15. Two years I wasn't in New York, so it didn't count. 15 years of pain, man. We didn't get there. We didn't get there. We didn't get there. Let me tell you something about what's going on over there with the Knicks, man. Let me tell you something. The last four, four to five years, we definitely had a team good enough to go all the way. And what happened? Ewing didn't step up. Yo, my man, he didn't step up. Bro, that guy was putting dyes of ice on his knees after every game, bro. The machine was breaking down. Can I tell you something? It's very simple. You have Jordan on the Knick team the last four or five years. We got some championships in our... We wouldn't have had him. I'm telling you right now, that's the difference between these star players. There is not going to be a go-to guy... You got to step up. There's not going to be a guy like Jordan, my man. Maybe Anthony, and maybe Anthony Sun will be that man. But he ain't coming in your lifetime. Well, we're going to make another trade, though. It's obvious. We need a center. Yeah, I heard they're going to give it a free will. Ah, man, I hate to see that. That's a bad move. That's right, that's a bad move. You got to understand the kind of people that are running the basketball operations for the Knicks. They did all of the other things. They got the Paramount Theater, they got the winds. They know we're basketball people. I'll go to the park right now. I got five brothers, and we'll turn that team around, kid. Yeah, these suits, they don't understand chemistry. That's right. They don't know. They don't know. It's like, no, you need Littrell in this town. Right. What is Glenn Rice going to do? I mean, what is Glenn Rice going to do? I pray they trade him. He's a great outside shooter, but I don't know. Don't we got shooting? Don't we got brothers who can take the shot in Houston and Spreewell? Where are you going to put Glenn Rice? All right, let me tell you something. I know Ant's bored. Ah, that's okay. Now, Old Dirty. Yes, sir? We got to face reality. We are going to lose either Houston, or Spreewell, or a couple of those guys. Don't get rid of Camby, because he's a work in progress. If they put the brother into play, and they give him some minutes, man, and let him, you know? I like the Camby. That's right. I like Camby, too. He used to be going in with up in Boston. What do you think of getting rid of Val Houston? Hell no. Well, then who are you going to get rid of? We got to get together. No, you got to package up Childs and somebody else. You're not getting rid of Ward. No team's going to take Childs in a package. You know why? Because the Knicks have made him untradable with the salary that they gave him. You know what I'm saying? Seventh, eighth man off the bench is giving the brother millions. Well, it's going to be interesting. I say by next week, we got a quality center in New York. Who's that? They're starting to say Matumbo, possibly. Come on, Matumbo's even older than you. Yeah, he's up there as well. You see? Yo, I don't know, man. We'll see what happens. Yo, I don't know, man. It can't depend on Luke Longley. Who? Jab or something. Luke? Yeah, but you know, he's got some size to him. Kenny F. with Shaq down low? I don't think so. No, no, no. He's nothing without Jordan. Hasn't proven anything without Jordan. Why didn't we try to go get that other cat that was playing with the Sixes? My man from Corny Island, bro. What's up with him? What's his name? He got the cornrows in his hair? Iverson. Oh, Iverson? Yeah. Let's get you Iverson Sprewell in Houston, bro. You're out of your mind. That's what I'm saying. That's an ill combo right there. That's an ill combo. If you get that combination, there's going to be no pot left for anyone else in New York City. What you mean? Oh, yeah. What? Marijuana? Yeah, man. All right, we got to go. All right, yo. Because now you're out of your mind. No, I'm not. All right, remember your homework assignment. Yo, I'm watching you today at 7, and this ain't a plug for NBC, bro. All right, watch the Olympics, and you give us your observations. Very good. All right? Peace. Misty Hyman things. Where is it? Misty Hyman. Little Misty Hyman. That last name of Hyman, that's got to be a bitch growing up. Jesus Christ. You know when kids make fun of your name because it sounds like something else? I mean, that's just Hyman. Hyman? Is Hyman Misty? Misty Hyman. Everyone loves it. Hey, Misty Hyman. All right. Just hearing the name Dick when you're in third grade was funny. Yeah. Dick? He said Dick. His name's Dick. Yeah, it's like being named Ass-F. Right. Hey, Ass-F. You might as well. No, I'm Misty Hyman. Misty Hyman. Misty Hyman. Jesus. Hyman. All right, we got to take a break. All right. 2127571027. We'll be back in just a bit. Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot. Come on, mom. Don't bang open. You f*** my mom, I'll f*** yours. Oh, disgusting. I say lay back and enjoy it.

CK from Jersey writes on the Infant Feedback, Britney should auction off her virginity. Yeah, and she could retire from the music business if she did that. Some guy offered 11 mil or 14 mil. Oh, yeah, we had that story on the show. Yeah. To take her virginity from her. She didn't even acknowledge it. I'd like to see the home shopping guy. Britney Spears' Virginity. Try to get someone to buy Britney Spears' virginity. Let me tell you, people, coming up next is going to be one of the best things we've ever seen. One of the best things we've ever had on the program. F. Sammy Sosa, F. Mark McGuire, F. Michael Jordan, A. Rookie Cards, who cares about them? Britney Spears' virginity.

I swear to God, you're going to have trouble getting into this thing. I'm going to tell you, it's going to be work the first couple of times. It's going to be like trying to get into her mouth when her jaw's wide shut. That's how sad it is. It's going to be like a shop life. Hammered shut with a mallet. You're not getting in here easy, people, but it's going to be worth it. Have you ever been to a Clam Bake? What are the best tastes in sweetest clams? The tight ones that are hard to shut. And believe me, you'll be adding your own cocktail sauce to this one, people. Me, darling. I swear, you're practically going to have to file your junk down just to get it in. Nothing going in here wider than a wild piece of goddamn paper. Oh, now look, you get a McGuire rookie card and I defy you to slide it in me. I defy you to slide it in. Look how tight it is, people. Unbelievable. And look, who knew there's barely any hair on this thing? My God! Look at that, a brand new Yo-Yo, people. Brand new Yo-Yo Beatdown. We're never going to have this again. It's truly one of a kind. One of a kind, people. Whoops, I did it in my pants. Just imagine it. What's this going to be like? Me, darling. And we'll throw in a 98 set of Flair Ultra. No extra charge. You can't pass it up. You've got to be a mad man. Me, darling. Get on the phone. Get on the phone now. Dial the number, but don't hurt your finger. You're going to need them all just to open your eyes. You're going to need them all just to open this up. I swear to God. This is like a goddamn eclipse. Once in a lifetime. Me, darling. I bet you're going to hurt yourself just trying to get into this thing. You know, usually with the cards that come in, I open up a box and show you what's inside. We can't open this box. Believe me, I'm trying, people. You're going to go through, I swear to God, you're going to have to get a case of Foxhead Oil just to get close to this. I swear to God. Doc, get over here. Give me that thing. Let me show you how tight this is. Look. There's no getting in it. There's no getting in it, people. No getting in it. It's like Fort Knox. Me, darling. Not only do you get the vag, not only do you get uncharted territory, but we're throwing in the balloon knot for no extra charge. Can you imagine? Imagine. Imagine. Britney Spears' bum. B-dialing. And two boobs that look like goddamn flotation devices. People, you're insane to not go there. Go there. Go. The white flag has gone up outside the studio. They're saying enough. Stop, please. Her blue wings, she lays on her back. These things look like swimmies. They look like water winds. Unbelievable. B-dialing. We're going to throw in the paramedics that's called the throwing in the jaws of life to pry this bitch open. Because you're not going to get in. This is like a head-on collision in 60 miles an hour trying to get the goddamn door open. You're not going to do it. You're not going to do it. You're not going to do it. You're not going to do it. You're not going to do it. You're not going to do it. B-dialing. B-dialing. Head slam shut. Head slam shut. Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones.

You've got to have the side of your head pigtails. You've got to get the pigtails on the side. You can check her out on the Spazz camp, WNEW.com.

I'd just like to thank you guys and Corinne for catering to the needs of the children today. Just leave the spaz cam on for a couple more minutes and I should finish. Yeah, Mike is saying the camera is like the perverted make-a-wish foundation for kids who are more sick in the mind than in body. Sean from Long Island wants to know if she's ever had thousands of guys simultaneously ur-er while staring at her. I don't think so. No. Welcome to it then. Alright.

Oh, you're very naughty. Yes, very naughty indeed. Everybody's writing so quickly here. I'm Cuckoo for Cocoa Puff. No, Daddy, it doesn't hurt. You people are horrible. Let's see, we need to see another ass shot. Oh, you guys. I shouldn't read somebody. Oh, I know. Daddy, look what I did to you again. Too friggin funny. Daddy, I love when you touch my bed, please. We're going down. Daddy, I'm under here now. Daddy, I'm under here now. Well, Anthony, what a nice surprise today. Fabulous. We still haven't even played Guess What's in My Pants. No. The whole reason that you came down here. After just tuning in, 19-year-old Corinne is in the studio, Anthony. Just 19? Just turned. Oh, I didn't even know that. Just turned it. Daddy, show me your monkey. Okay, terrific. Well, are we okay? No, are we okay? Well, people keep asking us time and time again, what are you guys going to do next? Hot team sex. Daddy, I'm really hot. This is wrong. Yes, it is, Anthony. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's a good one. Line 12, but you can't... Come on. No, they won't let that one go. You think? I don't know. Give it a try. Write it down, man. Now we're playing Guess If It'll Even Get On The Air Or Not. Let me see. I don't know, technically. Daddy, it won't fit in my mouth. I have no idea what she's saying, Anthony. All right, give her that one. That's going to be a showstopper right there. Listen to this one, Anthony. I'm going to be a showstopper. I'm going to be a showstopper. I'm going to be a showstopper. This tastes so good. She's talking about the blow pop. We went down to the street and got her some blow pop. I know. Daddy, my poopy hurts. That didn't make the air who you're getting. It does, though. We're not even writing them anymore, the listeners. No, the listeners are totally, like you said, total request live. Daddy, what's that in a popcorn bucket? All right, Anthony. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's... Everyone's all distracted. Daddy, can I eat some meat? All right, let's take a break. Okay. And we'll finally play What's in Corinne's Panties. She's in a bra and panties. And we'll play that next. Stay there. This is not the Discovery Channel. This is the Opie and Anthony Show. The Pooties and the Wacko Show. You can watch them on the show. Yes, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. We're hanging out with Corinne. Look at the picture on the cam. She's live on the spaz cam. Coming up on the nmw.com. Click on Opie and Anthony. There's a picture of her. She's 19 years old, Anthony. Really? Just turned. Got pigtails. Just the detail that's lit by. She's got a lollipop in her mouth. She's in her bra and panties. And she's got a stuffed animal. And the listener is just flooding the studio with things for Corinne to say, Anthony. Wow, wow, wow. Someone's got to write it down. Oh, okay. This one, right? Daddy, you still have to look at him. This is wrong. Daddy, why are you sneaking into my bed again? It can't be that obvious. You never wrote that, Rick. I guarantee you wrote that. That had to be, Rick. Boy, this will be harder to do when I get my permanent teeth in. Okay, fine. Grandpa, you're so much bigger than Daddy. Oh, no. That was a horror. Am I bad? Well, that could mean anything. You're a good boy. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. That could mean anything. Right? It could mean many things. Well, okay. If it will get me an A. Here, try this one. This will make it through. I thought you needed a thermometer to take my temperature. Daddy, can I come too? Boy, the guy's going out and then she wants to go with him. Sure, maybe your little brother is playing T-ball or something. Of course. Anthony, this is Justin from Zavia from Port Chester. The Open Anthony formula. One hour of worst of plus 30 minutes of racism plus three and a half hours of boobs, badge, and gas equals a number one afternoon drive. He hit it. He found the secret formula much more quickly than I did. He hit it, yes. He found the secret formula much like the extra crispy recipe and the recipe for coke. That is truly the recipe for this program. A little bit of racism, a lot of underage sex. All right. All right, Anthony. You know, yes, Opie, yes. We've done the pre-what's in my pants interview like we do with all of our contestants. We spend this much time with everybody who comes in the studio. How do you see why I was so lackadaisical about Rose the other day in the suit? Rose Rock, though. I understand, but you know, it's going to ever forget about the bottle rocket trick. See what she had to do? Set explosives off in her crotch. All right, let's play What's in My Pants. Yes. Corinne and her boyfriend came down and played this today live. Play that snappy tune. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, yes, there you go. Whoa. Okay. How would you like to mow my lawn? Huh? Yes. Well, here we are. We finally made it to the game, Anthony. Guess what's in my pants. Cowbell Bill is sitting in with us today. He'll be guessing. Can I? I'm going to play a different game. I'm going to play Guess Who's Going to Lick the Microphone. And it was like a mock with my pit. So we explained the game to Corinne at this point, right, Anthony? What? I bet you will. Oh, yeah. Well, you know what the rules of the game are. She will take the microphone, rub it on her most intimate areas, and we will have to guess what hairstyle she is in possession of in her most intimate areas. Yes. A lot of people checking in before they hear a sound saying, wood floor, wood floor, wood floor. Don't say a thing, Corinne. Or as they would like to call it also, the Jambanee Ramsey. All right, I guess we're ready to play. We're ready to play. We're ready to play. Corinne, why don't you stand up? Let's check the camera, make sure our listeners. You know something? We are so good to our listeners, aren't we, Alvin? Look at us. We're giving them a video of this. We give you stuff. There she is with the little bun bun and the blow pop in her mouth. Pig tails. Now she's standing up and we are going to play Guess What's in My Pants with the lovely 19-year-old Corinne. Wait, I mean I want to look but then it would wreck the game. Boy, that's bittersweet, isn't it? I think I cheated. Yeah, I think I cheated too. I think I got an accident. Who cares? I don't even give an F if I get disqualified. Okay, we're going to play Guess What's in Corinne's Pants. All right, you know the rules. You rub it on the most intimate areas and we guess what you have in your pants. Well, you've got to turn around. Okay, I can turn around. There we go. I turned completely around. This is rough. I can't see the bunny rabbits in the way. Good. Get out of the way, Mr. Bunny Rabbit. I want to see Mr. Beaver. All right, she's got the microphone. Let's make sure. All right, rub up and down first. Interesting. You've got to get used to the acoustics of the microphone over the phone. Go side to side. Side to side. Little more. Little more. Indeed, yes. Rick. Now the circular motion. I moved the camera around my head. All right, you know something? Do we even have to challenge here for the love of God? Dude, the dispatch can just crashed. It's gone, man. I'm sure someone out there is getting something. Sal from Huntington with a pertinent question. Isn't this illegal? Sal, we don't know and we don't care. When was the last time we cared? That's it? That's it? Do you really need any more? Are you ready? For now, for a while. I bet it would be easy for you to play what's in our pants right now. Easy, my pockets stop making noise. You always come up with the best lines, man. I'm making do. You know, I don't know. If I go first, everyone's got to follow suit. We're all going to say the same thing. Do you want to say it on three? One, two, three, wood floor. Or in this case, the Tweety Berry. Yeah, we all have to say wood floor. Just from your personality and the way you look, I would feel that that would be how you're groomed. Also, the sound that was made or wasn't made was truly indicative of the Jambanee Ramsey. So, should we get the answer, I guess? I'm saying she's packing an Olsen twin. All right, Corinne, what is in your pants? A wood floor. Oh, it makes it even better, doesn't it, kid? 100%. Wow. And how do you groom that? I just shave it. And when did you shave? When? The last time? Yesterday? Yeah, there was a little flapping. There was a little five o'clock shadow thing happening there. Was there? Tiny bit. We're going to give her some Mujan, right? Does she need Mujan? Wood floor. When did you shave? What's shaving? What's there? What's there? Well, very good. Wow. That's fascinating. Yeah, of course. Okay. Okay, terrific. Oh, you're getting naughty. Wow. Wow. Wow. Okay, terrific. Nice. That was... A little prison loop. That was terrific, Anthony. Mommy, why does Daddy keep playing with my cabbage patch? Oh, my God. That's a good line, Rick. That's a good line, Rick. That's a good line, Rick. That's a good line, Rick. You're pointing at Phil like that was a bad line. That's a good line. I left that down. Very nice. Well, Anne, unfortunately, I guess we've got to thank Corinne for coming by for the last two and a half hours. Why? There's still another hour and 20 minutes left of the show. Why would you have her leave? And her boyfriend, take that mic there. What's your name again? That doesn't matter what your name is. That doesn't matter what your name is. No, what's your name? Just kidding. My name's Paul. Oh, damn. All right, it's Paul. Oh, you got that out? Yeah, unfortunately. We're going to play the limo game with you, but the vital limousine game. No, Paul and Corinne Anthony. If we could figure out other stuff for her to do, we'll do it, right? Yes. How long have you two been an item? Four months. Four months. Wow. That's it, huh? Yep. You're banging? Yeah. You said he was trying to get anal from her. You don't go there first. That's not the first stop on the train. Yeah, prom guy is going to try to get anal. Trying to get anal. Hope you got a shoe horn, my friend. 19 over there. Jesus. It's going to sound like tightening up a two-by-four on those old wooden vices. You know the squeak sound those have made? That'll be like, well, good luck to you. Yes, good luck to you. In your venture for anal. What do you think? Do you think you'll ever give that up? It ain't happening. Ah, ah-ha. Has he tried? You know that little move where it's like, what? I didn't know. It slipped. Exactly. That old gag. It slipped. Yeah, so did this. It was my knee. They tried the slip move? Yeah, that doesn't work. But isn't that look on their face bright? Did you try to have another hip move? Yeah, I tried booze. That's a good one. Daddy, I don't like anal. Oh, come on. Rick, come on. Rick, that isn't even a double entendre or anything. It's called double entendre humor, Rick. Oh my goodness. That's why we got away with it today, kids. Well, we'll find out what we did tomorrow. Don't go counting your chickens now. All right, well, I guess we'll unfortunately let her leave. Yeah. That was great. Thank you. Say that one. Yeah, that'll work. Don't even. No, don't say that. Don't even say that. That's where I struggle, right? Oh, yeah. With anal and that. Go ahead and see how it looks. Yeah. Okay. She does the other thing, right? The oral thing, right? Oh, really? She grabbed those pigtails like a handlebar of an old Schwinn. Frank? The tassel's hanging off your bike. The tassel? Just put a bell on her head so you can, clink, clink, clink. Oh, really? She completes to full completion. Yeah. Let's go to feel like latex paint. Easy cleanup. Frank, what's up? How was your day? Was it bad? Yeah. But I don't know now. Yeah, well, that's how the show goes. Right when you think we've gotten as sick as we possibly can, we take it to just about illegal. Just keep up the good work. All right, Frank. All right, bye-bye. Let's play that audio from Friday. Where is that? It's only two minutes, not the whole bit. Well, we're going to have to say goodbye to Corinne and the guy Tony or Bill. What's his name again? John. How long before you had sex? Not too long. I'd go a third date. No. How long? Yeah. Was he your first? No. Did you get the oral thing first? Yeah. Days later, he moved on to the sex stuff? Yeah, with slow progression. Slow progression. Does he reciprocate? Yeah. Very nice. How about that? Wow. It's like shucking a little neck, right? Come on. Everyone's gone to a clam bake or something. All right. It's truly time to say goodbye. Time to wrap this up. Unfortunately, now it's an hour and 15 minutes to show up. It's Corinne and... Dan? Whatever. We'll be able to call in your services if they are needed in the future for anything, maybe a live show or something like that. You can get in front of a crowd of 2,000 horny guys. Well, believe me, it's all hands off. You're on a stage under the protection of the fine gentleman here, Michael Mark. Don't worry. All right. It won't look like you fell into some pancake batter. Don't worry. So it's Corinne and Paul Anderson. Very good. Bravo. That's two hours of great radio right there. You've got to love it. The crowd on their feet. Would you come to the live show and dress in the JonBenet Ramsey cowboy outfit? With a garret around your neck? A garret. All right. Very, very cute, Anthony. We'll be back. There's something wrong with us. Can we play What's in My Hand? There's something very, very wrong with us. Let's go a little into the delinquency of a minor. The OBS Amsterdam show. It's really bad, but it's really good. 1027. There was an article in the paper today, Hollywood, just freaking out because they see what's going on with Napster and everyone burning their own CDs and stuff. They don't want the same thing to happen with DVD. Oh, it'll happen once... I guess there's what? There's code on the DVDs or something? Mm-hmm. There's supposedly programs out there or websites that you can go to and figure out how to get rid of the coding? Yeah, and you could download full movies off the Internet. It sucks now because of the bandwidth problems. It's hard to transfer that much information. It's just not as easy as doing the music thing, right? But music was almost impossible just a year ago. A year ago? Yeah, maybe six months ago. They're coming up with new ways to compress this stuff and get it across. And before you know it, sure. All the time movies will just be, you know, you'll do what you do on Napster. You hop on a site, you pop in an actor or a movie title or director or something, and all these choices of movies will come up. You punch down on it, and there it is. Yeah. You burn it to a disc, you pop it in your DVD player, and there you are watching a movie at home. Who does that screw? Everyone. Blockbuster, Hollywood, F'em all. F'em all. I love this. I got a message today from Steve C. Yes. Got a thanks, Steve C, from Found Your Music dot com. The Jaws DVD. I heard you guys talking about that the other day, so I figured I'd do it. I watched it last night. He's rolled back. I was laughing because they were doing the whole autopsy on the doc scene. Oh, yeah, where they cut it over there. This is amazing because I got the speech pretty close, but Ant's got it word for damn word. Oh, the mayor. Yeah, do the mayor. Let's be reasonable. This is not the time or place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish. And I will not stand by while you cut that thing open and watch that little kitten boy spill out all over the doc. Little kitten boy. That's good, Anthony. I want them strung up by their Buster Browns. He's the best. The mayor's the best. And the great part. We might have to get some mayor clips from Jaws. Yeah, we should. It's a good one when the mayor finally realizes that there is a shark problem. And Brody gets him to sign the paper. And he's just in the hospital all, I thought it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, Brody. He's all screwed up and everything. He's just wandering around. I can't wait to see this. I'm going to definitely watch this tonight. It was cool. It was definitely cool. And what have they got on here besides making of? There's like an hour long. And it's like a little shark was. Yeah. Mechanical. No digital enhancement there. It just shows you because we, all of the movies that are being released now have these elaborate digital effects. And this thing was this huge rubber shark. Yeah, it was a huge machine on this huge metal pulley contraption. And it would sink every time. It went in the water. It didn't work for like the first three months of production. You know, and I was watching jaws last night and I was looking really close to the shark for, for when, when did I come out? 75. You did a damn good job. It doesn't, it still holds up to the test of time. That damn shark. The little video game doesn't though. Remember that? The little kid playing the video game. No, I don't attack or something. And cartoon shark. The making of it is really interesting. You know, the shark cage. Did you put a midget in there? Yeah, I put a midget in the shark cage. Did you know that? I had no idea. And yeah, so that way the sharks that were swimming by would look bigger. They would look just absolutely different. You're playing Hooper. Hooper, ain't you watching it? Now I want those little paint happy bastards caught and hung up by their busker brown. I love that guy. We gotta get, we gotta get the mayor drops for our radio show. That's our latest project. That's a swimming with bow-legged women. Don't drink that. Alright. City ends. I'm cutting money all your life. So you'll enjoy that Jaws DVD. It's right up your alley. Yes. You want to talk about the Jaws exhibit at Universal Land. How lame is the Universal Studios tour? Jaws? The whole tour is pretty lame. Sometimes if you've never done this, I think everyone's done it at some point in their life. If you've ever been to California or what's even worse than the California one. At least the California one, I think they actually used some of the sets. I don't even believe that. The car from Back to the Future. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that obviously isn't the one that was used. Oh yeah, that's the Blues Brothers car. Yeah, I believe that. On the Universal lot, they did have Leave It to Beaver's House in California. Now I think, Steve, do you know anything about that? The Universal, I took that tour actually last October. In California or Florida? In California. Okay, and I think a lot of those sets were used. Are legit? Sure. They got like the facade from Psycho. Yeah, yeah, they got the psychos. With the little motels down below and stuff. It's not like these full-blooded houses. No, we know that. Oh, and boy the tram driver doesn't let you forget that. These of course are called façades. As we drive around the back of the house, you'll notice that, oh look, no wall. I guess June Cleaver couldn't get dressed in here. Which means false front façade. And now the Jaws exhibit. Look, here we are in the lovely town of Amity. There it is. And look, there's the fisherman out there. You catch anything? He's got his bow turned over and he didn't even move. His legs didn't flail or nothing. He just turned right over and still holding his fishing pole. And then he got sucked into the water. Oh my God. Oh, and we're heading right for him in our tram. Gee, we're really scared. Because you can see Jaws head. You see the Jaws head right under the surface of the water not moving. So that big machine behind him pushes him right towards our tram. Those of you that left might want to get your cameras ready for this very spontaneous opportunity. It wasn't even working the day we went. No. The tram just kind of drove by and you saw the limp Jaws just sitting there out of the water. It's like, oh great. Now we're turning down New York Street, which is an exact replica of New York City. Yeah, bull. Not even close. Where are the Nigerians? The Nigerians. Yeah, the funny thing is Rick was one of the tour guides at Universal Studios. He used to do that. Do you remember any fun line? Yeah. I got to hear some of the real ones. How many times a day did you have to do this? Five times a day. Basically once an hour. 25 times a week. All the rooms loaded on the tram. Let's hear. Okay, let me get in the mood. I'm sitting in the tram. Universal Studios, I've been in a hot line for like two hours waiting with screaming kids. And I'm finally on the tram. And here's Rick to entertain us. And what kind of fun? Okay, we're in California. Oh my God. Come on, Rick. You remember. Yeah, take that off so it's more like it was. All right, welcome aboard the Universal Studios Hollywood Super Tramp presented by Texaco. You dick. The Super Tramp presented by Texaco, isn't it? Let go. Universal Studios tour guide. I'm your tour guide, Rick. Did you say that? Come on, give it to us. I love it. I know I wasn't a tour guide. It was a studio guide. I'm going to be your studio guide. And here's your driver. Give us a horn, Bob. I'm so excited to be here. This is great. I got my camera ready. I want to hear everything our studio guide Rick has to say. So don't be talking. I got my disposable camera ready. And I want to see the psycho house. I'm on my honeymoon. What? I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. Both windows are made with sugar. Do we have the bus sound over there somewhere? Where's the bus sound, Rick? I've got to get the whole thing. I'm almost feeling it. Like I was there. That's amazing that he remembers that. I'm starting to flashback. I'm remembering the whole thing. That was so cute. It's horrible. It's horrible. Alright, let's pull away now from the western street. Here we go. Ah, in our little tram. As we pull away from 5.6. Don't laugh. We'll be coming up on a small town you might know as Amity. Now the music would start, right? Yeah, then we'd have a little thing with a soundtrack. So you could play different music from different sections. Ah, yeah. Right. So you go through Amity. And we see Bob. Hey Bob, how's the fishing today? Uh oh, there goes Bob. Oh, the chainsaw would eat this up. They'll snap and dig it all up. Oh, George. Well, as we make our way around, we'll let somebody know that Bob's having a problem. Oh, what was that? And then the shark comes up. And starts like chomping at the side of the road. Yeah, I remember that. But then it's real believable when George backs up. Yeah, yeah, if you look behind you, you see George backing up into his original position. Now what about maybe the Battlestar Galactica portion? Did they have that? The little tunnel? Oh, the tunnel. Oh, the tunnel, yeah. You might remember this tunnel from the six million dollar man when he ran after Bigfoot. And you know that wasn't the tunnel they used. It's been on that damn tram ride. And then the King Kong. The King Kong ride. They had the earthquake. So with the, when they went to King Kong, the whole... King Kong was on there too. You come into the studio, they open up the doors, and then it closes behind you. Now we're in New York. Tell us about the flood that comes down the hillside. Tell us about the flood that comes down the hillside. And then the water opens up from the Ten Commandments. Well, the flood is earthquake. Right, right. So we pull into stage 54, I think. Yes. Which was a two-story stage. One of the only... one of a kind. There we go. As we pull in... Are you stoned, Mr. Died Man? You're laughing an awful lot. My young son here is saying you're stoned. Well, don't worry, Hiroki. This thing will get very interesting in a minute. As you see, they've been doing some filming here. That's why you see some of the sets that have been set up. That was always a line of crap too. They would never film on the tram line, would they? That's retarded. Actually, no, they did do filming for like the... What was it? Beverly Hills Cop 3? The real bad one? Did you see like the Battle Star Galactica roll out? Yeah, because it was supposed to be on the floor. So of course it was going to be filmed there, but none of them actually... I remember the first time I was on it, they go, and look, running in the background, that's Rock Hudson. For his Joe McMillan and wife. Like what? That's crazy crap. There's Peter Falk filming Columbo here at Universal. So now we're in the... we're in the earthquake stage. Yes. And you have the doors closed. You know, this is where we're doing some filming today. What was that? That was just a little rumble. Those are tremors. We get those all the time in California. A clever ruse. Yeah, because then all of a sudden it becomes like this big shaking thing. The truck from the top comes down. Yes, and bursts into flames. Right, and then the water comes and it floods it all out. And it's like, driver, get us the heck out of here. What the heck, because you can't curse. You just be like, oh my God. Oh my God. Holy shit. They were telling you you can't do that because some of the people will actually freak out. Oh, you should have done that. Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't fake. Please get out of the tram and run towards the flaming truck that just fell. And all the working machinery. Run for your life. Hiroshi. That's good and Jimmy. Jimmy, what's going on? How are you doing, guys? We're doing well. I've actually done that tram ride myself and it was pretty damn lame, I have to say. But there was one piece of that whole thing that made me turn white as a ghost. What? Do you guys remember the bridge? The collapsing bridge. Let our tour guide run us through the collapsing bridge, if you would please. Now, as we come around to this bridge, you'll notice it's one of the oldest bridges here on the Universal Studios back lot. Built in the 1920s and it looks a little creaky but we're going to try and speak across it right now. I remember that. As we come across it, then the trick is to keep talking like nothing's going on and all of a sudden the bridge drops. Oh, yeah, yeah. Because a couple of pieces of lumber kind of fall as you're rolling up to it and you get right on it and the bridge kind of drops a couple of feet if you ask why. Probably like six inches. And then you come off and go, that's just part of our falling bridge. You may have seen this on the Six Million Dollar Man 4 at the Bionic Woman. Remember when she jumped backwards but her hair was going up while she was going down? How did they train you for this, man? That's what I want to know. Dude, it was an intense four-week course. Really? Four weeks with a book about six inches thick that you had to memorize verbatim all for $5.50 an hour. It sucked. Well, it's all struggling actors anyway. Right, right. They were going to make their mark. So they could care less who they got because everybody's just like, oh my God, we're going to be working in a Hollywood studio. Oh, a Hollywood studio. You're on the transport. I'm getting churros for $1.50 less than the other guy. Churros. That's our bungalows. How about the bungalows? That's bungalow 54. He knows it all. This is a Lucille Ball, I would say. While she was getting banged by Fred Frenner. You should just lost your mind and read the whole thing. That would be great. Run for your life, people. Let's see, what else was there? Oh, this was a favorite. The tanks loved this one too. If they could understand you. As we come up, this is what is known as, what was it called? It was where they did all the horror movies. I forget the exact name of it. And you'd be like, right through those walls, that's where the Hunchback of Notre Dame came walking through. And that's where we first saw Dracula. And if you look up there right now, there's one right now. Wave to them, everybody. It's the Invisible Man. Oh, that old game. Wave, wave. And they gave everyone to be waving. All the rooms. That's the Invisible Man. Oh, she got everybody with the camera and she goes, where is he? Click, click, click, click. Did you just want to shoot someone? Did you want to shoot yourself? And then of course we get to Anthony's favorite part of the Universal. That's where Moses parted the Red Sea. Oh, it looked just like it did in the movie. It's like a fountain you drive through. It's a freaking fountain. It's pretty pathetic. Many gallons of water had to be used and pumped out of this. Did you have to do the tour during Gay Day, Rick? I don't think they had a Gay Day when I was in the Universal. Oh, that's Disney. Look, Rick feels at home talking into his little microphone. But the funniest part is, can you totally picture Rick doing that? Yeah, with a big smile on his face wearing a Universal Studios uniform. It was a name tag. It was the only time in my life I read a word named Rick. Wasn't there a break that you took where you got out of the tram and went into the props little soundstage and walked through it and then got back on the tram? No, no, no. They stopped that two years before I got there. Why, people pilfering the props? I remember they would just parade a bunch of people through these things and this, you might recognize this lion or this jaguar figure was used in Back to the Future next to the big clock on the clock. They actually charge extra for that now. When I was there they had like for $150 a person. They take you to the individual sets where they're filming these. The personal tour. Ah, great, great. Anthony? Yeah? What's going on, guys? Hey man, I thought those rides were pretty damn good except for King Kong. You thought the Jaws ride was good? Yeah, with the gasoline exploding all the way. Are you insane? It doesn't take a lot to entertain you, huh Anthony? No. Alright, man. Thank you. Hey, send a case when Scott gets to the radio show. It might happen. He's good. Alright, thank you buddy. Jim, emailing in. Hey Rick. Hey Rick. Hey Rick. I'm going to get you. Hey Rick. Where is my lame clip today? Ah, forget it. Alright. Oh, this guy Dave knows the revolving tunnel Lee Majors fell into. What? On line 8? Line 8, look at 8. Dave, you have information on the rotating tunnel? You remember the tunnel that spun around with the lights inside? Yeah. You know, at one moment a girl was giving the tour and said that Lee Majors got so disoriented that he couldn't shoot the whole scene and he kept falling down. And that's a true story. That is hysterical when you drive in that thing and you start looking. It's pretty confusing. It totally flips you over and makes you feel like you're rolling. That was the only part of this whole tour that was actually exciting. Yeah, because it did kind of do something to your senses. But the rest of it, I love when they just drive you past their junk. And it's like, and this, yeah, some of these props, you see a plane here that was used in an episode of the Six Million Dollar Man. Or the Giant Shoe. The Giant Shoe, you might recognize from the Incredible Shrinking Woman that was filmed here on Universal Studios. And right there, there's the Red Ferraris Magnabuse in your eyes. And it's just like this piece of crap laying on the side of the road. It looks like cardboard. It is not. They don't even take care of the props. It is not. I think you're lying. Did anyone call you a liar? No. Did you ever get anybody rambunctious? No? Pretty boring. Pretty boring, yeah. Most of them couldn't speak their language. Which is funny because most of the people that couldn't speak their language were the ones on the side that sit right in the first car with you. So you're trying to throw out your best stuff. Your best stuff. I'm riffing. I'm riffing on the Cleaver House. Right. I didn't get anything from the little Asian family or the Spanish people because they don't understand English. You might recognize this as Delta House from the movie Animal House. And right there is 1313's Mockingbird Lane. Oh, I've got to get a picture. Can you imagine going home and pulling these pictures out in front of people? This is the house. Meanwhile, it just looks like you're taking pictures of people's houses. It doesn't look like anything. See this house? Yeah, please. Could you put the goddamn pictures away? It's another thing. The advent of the video camera. Do you ever see people in wherever? Wherever. Right here. They videotape the Hard Rock Cafe. We're right across from the Hard Rock. People will sit on the side there and they'll get footage of the Hard Rock Cafe. And you're saying to yourself, does he go home, pop this in and go, gather around people, gather around, check this out? This is the door of the Hard Rock Cafe in New York. Okay, it's on a little longer. Hold it. See, I panned to the car trunks sticking out from above the door. Do you see that? You see? It's a little longer, a little longer now. Just be... There you go. Now here is a shot of my wife in the subway waiting for the train to come. Here it is. Oh my gosh. I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a I'm going to be a little bit of a You're not going to get hurt cause易 You're not going to get hurt cause易 You're not going to get hurt cause易 He's alone. I have my camera 5,000 dollars away from my house. I have it all ready. So I called and studied for 5,000 dollars. Hey, you're even hurrying behind the curfew. Have you come up with your own little closing line or did they give you a closing line? No, we just kind of stole it from everybody else. We kind of had a bunch of people who were using it so they would just pick whichever one you wanted to use. So you're like a wannabe. You used that one. You didn't make that up yourself? No. You ripped some poor guy off. Some poor Universal Studios poor guy got ripped off. He fucked up the back trap so I took his cake. Right. Rick, the Universal Studios poor guy. Alright. So you went pumpkin picking with Sandy. You drove all the way back with your booty of pumpkin. That sounds fun. No, that's a fun joke. No! Who is the man who goes medieval on your ass? Damn right. Who is the guy who's pumpkin picking on the fly? Can you do it? Who is the dude who gets you on the check for money? Diamond dust. You can call it misfit. Banging the produces dick. Careful. Reach around. Booty. And Anthony. 1027 WMW. The Tone Institute, New Jersey's Mawa, Edison, and Mount Laurel campuses open. Can prepare you to enter the in demand and lucrative computer career field.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Yankee Stadium. Oh, he's got some flim work in these days. Welcome to Yankee Stadium. Bob Shepard. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Yankee Stadium. I'm going to cross the street now. I'm going to cross the street now. Hey, how about the Mets not crying after they won? You know, the Yankees being the older team, I think they're getting a little sentimental in their old age. Why are they crying and getting them all... It's not like they haven't won a championship before. What's wrong with Cory? Now Cory's weeping openly. We got some Cory clips. You know what the Yankees are getting like? I love the Yankees. But they're getting like the uncle. Remember the uncle in your family that used to be the young, cool guy who was with the chicks and everything in his younger days, let's say maybe the 70s? And then all of a sudden now you see him at the holidays and he opens up a card and he's crying at the birthday card. And it's like, wait a minute. What happened? He's crying because he knows he can't get the young things anymore. Yeah, the big pork chop sideburns. You're talking about how many kicks you've railed. And now you're weeping over a freaking Hallmark card. What the Yankees are now? Why is Cory crying? Seriously. I don't know. No more of a Yanke fan than I am. Maybe he was soused. I don't know. I was crying on the Rotten Feds show and that was due to my drinking. So maybe I was confused. I thought I was in a coma for the last two weeks and then I woke up and Tory just won another World Series. I'm like, no, it's just a freaking playoff. Right. Calm down. All right. Here's Joe Torrey. You got a kiss from your manager, Joe. Let me ask you, obviously a very emotional time right now. We're just talking to Tino about this team being counted out by so many. What are you feeling right now? I can't talk. I'm choked up. You know, I got so tired of hearing how we turn it on and off. This ballclub comes to play and I don't think there's any ballclub that I'm more proud of than this one. That's not because it's the most recent because we had to go through a lot. And, you know, we're going to find out how good we are. But right now, I don't think anything can top what this feeling is. His voice is cracking. Okay. We're getting choked up. Wait a minute. Okay. A little more audio. Michael, I can't tell you. I don't think I've been more proud of any other team than this one. It's been a roller coaster ride. And, you know, getting to the postseason wasn't easy. Sounds like you just won the World Series. I know. You know, no feeling is better than this. No. How about if you win? When? I'm sorry. You know, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? He's going to curl up in the field position, suck his bum on the mound. We won. We won. I've got to give it to your Bobby Jones there. God damn. Great job. Great job. That could have been a no-hitter. Yeah. I would say two inches away from a no-hitter. Perfect game. Nice to see a pitcher go all the way through the game in a playoff. Very nice. Ped it. I'm like 6-0. And then I tune back in the game an hour later. I'm like, wow, they're chipping away here. I say one shut up. Ped it gets that look on his face like a serial killer gives a hooker before he chops a head off. Yes, yes. Look at him. Look at if they catch you. Yeah, I could kill you. I'm going to pull my hat way down and barely see my eyes. But there's hatred in these. And then he talks and he's like, you know, Jesus Christ, my personal relationship with the Lord. Right. If I didn't have that, I'd be killing people. Sure. Who let the dog down? Oh, my God. If I hear that song one more time. Unbelievable. Bobby Jones is going nine, nine, nine. This is a real match. Unbelievable. I'm listening to the fan just laughing my balls off. Bob Murphy is one of the best Bob Maradio announcers for baseball. I know he's old, but he sounds like he's drunk and he has a really bad cold. And he pronounces nine and five like no one does on a face of the earth. Five, five, nine, nine. Oh, that's a nice. Why? Yeah, he is good though. He's an old man. This is great. Well, that's moving on to the National League Championship Series. Taking the Giants Giants. Taking the Giants. That's great. Nine, five, nine. Moving on. Now against St. Louis. He was great when he was teamed up with Ralph Keiner and Lindsay Nelson. Keiner's now a state tourer in the half of the game for Keiner's Corner. How many beers did that crew have during the game? Remember that? Keiner's Corner. I think Lindsay Nelson was on acid when he was doing the games with the stuff he used to wear. Moving on. Both teams one game, one series away from a subway series. You don't know how good that is. Yeah. Rich, what's up? Yeah, he's got him down great. I was starting to roll him when I was in my car. But he's got to put the gurgle like he's trying to drown on his own phlegm. Yeah, that's what's going on. Like his teeth. Yeah, but he's got like a gurgle in his throat like he's got some phlegm caught in there. Moving on. Oh, sorry. Well, that's picking hells with that. Bobby Jones running right here in the game. Moving on. Take it away. All right, guys. It's fucking disgusting. Hey, Joe, what's up, man? I'm checking in on Murphy. Yeah, he's like, on Wednesday it's going to be Hampton, on Tuesday it's lighter. Thursday. Tuesday. Yeah. All right. Yeah, when it says Wednesday, it's going to be Hampton. Yeah. That's right. Right. We are doing a little bit of we're right now short of time between because we're going Yeah, when he says liar, liar. How many syllables is that? Lies. Lier. Monkey and toosby and wenjby. Come on, he's a great announcer. You guys suck. No, the scary words are the best. Oh my God. What I think is worse is that he plays the owl. Disgusting. What a joke. Disgusting. Look, I cut it all off my shirt and it fell in my pocket. Sorry about that. I've been up early. Been up since 5. I didn't go to sleep until 9. The blips had wide for balls too. Only black ham and a little word for butt-liders and a jigger-boo. Well, the blips are winning by a lot. Hey Sean, what's up? Oh man, do you ever listen like it could be snowing and anything during the baseball game? And Bob Murphy. Bob Murphy here, playing D for baseball. That's always a beautiful day for baseball. Temperature about 12 degrees. 12 degrees below zero. Hopefully going up to 9 as the MetLife Snoopy Blimp takes his pictures high above JZ. Goddamn, you got a new voice there. That's funny. That's funny, Sean, going 9. 9 innings. Now, now, because I was 8 years old. My thumb is foaming up because now it's ginger ale and not coffee. Did you know what you could do, Bob Murphy? Powering high-flying ball. It's soda. Eat my ass. You go far for your art, man. Yeah! Goddamn, you think we're going to get a song? There he is. Little book back of the best. From 1986, Let's Go Met's Go. There's a girl being raped by the 86-pound. East Bay. Yeah. They got the teamwork for snoring cocaine. East Bay. Look at that. What the Met's are doing now is called unconsensual sex. Or rape. There goes Darrell Schubber and Keith Hernandez fighting again. What a close team. Bring me home. Look at that. Look at that poor young girl being assaulted. Come on. Let's go. Are they going to have a song this year? Let's go. Let's go, Met's Go. There's no job in us now, unless we get arrested. Come on. Here they are throwing fireworks at the fans. Howard Johnson and Howard's real quick to the second base. And Backman on the first double play. Here's the big one, the late number three. A cow and all a mountain of a fly ball. Keith, the life center. Remember that one? He'll be celebrating that with some cocaine and whore. Let's go. There's Ricky Henderson and Bobby Bonilla playing cards. Easy. I hope he's dead. And smoking in the dugout. We got rid of all of that. Who's that in the disguise? It's Bobby Valentine. Let's go, Met's Go. Bravo. We got the teamwork to make the dream work. Any radio station playing really stupid Met songs or Yankee songs yet? Has anyone heard any yet? I guess... I'll give them a plug. I don't care. A plug? I wonder who let the Met's out. This is like they must have gotten their crack production team together. To wheel out this piece of crap. If this song doesn't spell gay, I don't know what does. This is like the soundtrack to a glory hole. Right here. It's got to be. Ready for a douche chill? You are really going to freeze up on this one. Oh my God. This is it. Maybe it sounds better with a big swan singe. I don't know. Let's take a listen to who let the Met's out. Now way the movies come down to the crowd. Everybody in the obligatory live clip. Longboard Week. One, two, three. The ball game is over. And the Met's have licked the wild card in the National League. After the first time in Grand Tide's history, the Met's are going to the postseason for the second and second of the year. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Excuse me, but I do believe that's just Ed. Oh my God. That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard. Oh my God. Wow. They can't be playing that as a real song. This is so gay, even for the 100. People are like playing that as a real song, huh? To get the city routing. Oh, yeah. That ought to make you proud to be a Met's fan, guys. Oh, man. That makes you, how you doing? You seem like a Grammy winner. I would have to admit that, being a Met's fan. Come on, guys, quit it. This isn't a real song. You're pulling our leg. You just wrote this during commercials, didn't you? That is being played. Kelly. Hey. Hey. You know what I think of? I just think of like all the Met's jumping in a gay bar up and down to that music. And Marco, Jay Moore, and Fez all standing there just watching their asses, just snapping their fingers over their head. Yeah. That's the image I get. Who let the Met's out? Go Met's. Go you Met's. Who let the Met's out? That is so bad. I just hope the guys over there are playing that as a goof, like they make fun of it every time they play it, right? I doubt it. No. You don't think so? You really think they're playing it and they're taking it serious? Hey, everybody. Coming up, we're going to be playing our favorite, our most requested song here on Z100, Who Let the Met's Out? Come on, go Met's. Someone's hilarious. All right. Let's take a break. We'll be back. Give us a call. 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. This is O.J. Anthony's hearing review. 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. We're talking about O.J. This is going to be a story toned out, what, The Inquirer? Yeah. Because O.J. broke up with his girlfriend? Well, it seems that girlfriend broke up with O.J. Yeah, sorry. She broke up with him and she started seeing things and really seeing the light. Well, I guess first of all, she's an accomplice. She's a good friend of O.J.'s. Yeah. She's a good friend of O.J.'s. Yeah. She's a good friend of O.J.'s. Yeah. Well, I guess first of all, she's a Nicole Brown Simpson look-alike. Uh-huh. They were doing a lot of blow together. Yeah. And she's starting to see the light, like you said, that, wow, this guy may have killed Nicole Brown Simpson after all. She's convinced. I mean, she is 100% sure that O.J. killed those two people, just like everyone else. Does she feel stupid now? Like, that everybody from the second she hooked up with him were like, what are you, insane? This guy's a murderer. But no, now she realizes. Yeah. His legs are just slowly rotting away. And now I hear things like she's saying that he leaves messages on her answering machine. Mm-hmm. He broke into her house to try to erase one of the messages because they were very incriminating. Yeah. Very angry. And then he's been peering through her windows there. Yeah. Well, she says he's stalking her. Sure. Hello. Hello. Hello. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Please, look, please pick up the phone. It's the O.J. I'll wait. Hello? Hello? You goddamn bitch, pick up the goddamn phone or I'll cut your mother's head off. Oh, damn, I'll put that on tape. Okay. I got to break in. Oh, damn, I shouldn't be saying this on tape. Hello, pick up, please. O.J. O.J. I didn't do nothing. So it gets crazier, though. Oh, there's drugs involved. I guess this ex-girlfriend's going to tell the inquirer that O.J. blamed Nicole for her own death saying she drove him crazy. This girl, Kristi Brody, the blonde, Nicole look-alike. And yeah, it seems that O.J. gave her these graphic details of the murder and stuff that she says only the killer would know. Second by second synopsis of the murder by O.J. during all-night cocaine binges, she says, O.J. would maniacally reenact scenes from his murder trial, pretending to cross-examine witnesses. Like all coked up. All right, here's how it works. Now, I've got a condom to my left, right? And I'm over here. And you know, the rest of the Dream Team is over here. And there's a witness on there. Now, let me ask you, Mr. Fong, what did you do with the blood evidence when you picked it up? And now he's got no answer. I put it in a bag and brought it to lab. See, now he put it in a bag. But where did that bag come from? A sterile bag, another sterile bag. Ah, but you know, where's the sterilizing company? My blood could have dripped on the sterilizing companies. Where's some more cocaine? Hello, pick up. Pick up. I need more cocaine. I need more cocaine. Oh, damn, I should have said that on the tape. This isn't the OJ. This is an OJ. This is Pedro Guerrero. Please pick up the phone. That's bad. Pedro Guerrero. Oh, my God. He got a cook problem, Pedro Guerrero, because whenever he has some, he never gives me any. That's a problem. Pedro Guerrero. Remember that, like months ago? It turns out that a 911 call was made by OJ saying that his chick, this chick, this Christy Prati girl, was fighting with him. I love the OJ prank call thing, the 911. So he calls 911 and says that there's a problem at the house and she's all drugged out of her mind and it was Pedro Guerrero that gets her the cocaine. Pedro Guerrero. Hello, 911. Pedro Guerrero's got the cocaine. He's a bad guy. And let me tell you, he cuts it too with that beta laxative. I'm crapping my brains out. Yeah, OJ blamed the call for her own death, saying she drove him crazy. OJ insisted that Prati abort two of his babies, then completely forgot about the first abortion, saying he blocked out unpleasant events. Oh, good. Good. I blocked it out. What baby? What fetus? What abortion? I blocked all that out. I blocked out unpleasant things except the time I slipped my wife's throat. Who is OJ? I blocked out unpleasant things and I'm pretty damn unpleasant. I'm the OJ. She also says Simpson has a lump on his kidney and his health is so bad, Prati believes he'll be dead in three years. Think we'll get a deathbed confession out of OJ? I doubt it, but that show would be good. Wouldn't that be great? But I think he's so pompous that he would never do it. Hi, this is OJ. I know I'm dying and I want to come clean. Nicole and Ron, it was Pedro Guerrero. Goddamn OJ. He ain't setting up the crap. Prati also says they have to break it up with the OJ out of fear that she'd end up like Nicole. Prati claims she broke into a suburban Miami apartment and has been peering into her windows, stalking her just like he did to Nicole before her murder. Oh, man. He's doing the same thing. Doesn't anyone? Who still thinks this guy didn't do it? Prati says a coked up OJ told her over and over as a count of what happened the night of the murders. In Simpson's scenario, he described the culprit as two killers. The culprit. While he never flat out admitted to her that he was the actual killer, the two killers, OJ often referred to himself in the third person. Saying OJ is this, well OJ did that. Well, OJ needs to get coked from Pedro Guerrero. There were two killers, I swear. It was O and J. I swear, O grabbed Nicole. Then J came up and slit her throat. And while she was falling down, O grabbed Ron Goldman as J was in hot pursuit. They killed and then O went to Chicago and J. Chips got balled at his house. Hello, pick up. This is O. J is very, I am a nice guy and want to warn you about J. J is a murderer, but O is a nice guy. O is that fun loving guy you see on the naked gun movie. But J, ooh, he's a bad man who cuts people up at night. Watch out. Oh, here comes J. Shut up, you whore. I'm the J. Shut up, O, you pussy. Yes, it's looking like he is coming apart at the seams physically and mentally. Doing coke, how old is this guy? 57 right? At this point, 52 or so? And she claims he's doing the coke. Well, now that I've seen how OJ is stalking me since I left him, I realize the truth. And it was in front of me all the time, she says, but I was blinded by love. I see now that all during the course of our relationship, OJ was confessing by telling me details only the killer would know. I don't know. I just know this from testimony, but it appears that Nicole said, oh damn, OJ, please don't kill me. Just for detail that I may have picked up in the trial. And Ron said, oh my God, OJ, what are you doing? What are you doing? Put that knife down. Small detail. Oh, why am I on the phone? Oh, a racist. I got to bring him to your house. Damn, why did I pick this up? Yeah, so she's out and scared and she's talking to the Inquirer. Cool. I can't wait to read that. I love that stuff. That should be out real soon, huh? Yeah. Hi, this is Pedro Camero. Can I please have OJ's answering machine tape? I'll give you some coke. Pedro Guerrero. We got to find the long version of that bit when it first came in. Pedro goddamn Guerrero. Hanging him out the drive of the police. Do we have the long version of that? The O is the smiling one. The J wears a French beret and a goatee. It's the evil J. The Pedro Guerrero stuff is really funny. Pedro, no, no, no. This is the story where the actual 911 tapes, because this girl, the one we've just been talking about, was doing way too much coke with supposedly Pedro Guerrero. This is OJ actually calling into 911 because his chick was so drug fueled and crazy that she took off at the car or something. Some kind of story that he gave the police. But just the fact that OJ was calling 911 and he was probably all coked up at the time. Here it is, okay. With a 911 call. Let's check out the 911 call. All right. State Sheriff's Police Require, where's your emergency? We have a problem here. I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab. I've been doing drugs with Pedro Guerrero. Did anybody get any drugs here? No. I've been doing drugs for two days with Pedro Guerrero. We just got arrested. It's like cocaine. And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now. Is anybody getting anyone right now? No, no, no. Does anybody have any weapons? No, no, no. Does the girl be in a dress? No. That's my favorite. Anybody have any weapons? No, no, no, no, no, no. Not this time. She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons. Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody? No, not this time. I've got to hear that again. That's cocaine. And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now. Is anybody getting anyone right now? No, no, no. Does anybody have any weapons? No, no, no. Does anybody have any weapons? No, no, no. Does anybody have any weapons? No, no, no. Does the doctor have any weapons? No. She's got to let me know if she has any weapons. No, she doesn't need a red light bulb. She has to tell me when she gets it. No, no, no, no, no. Now, don't get started on that again. No, no. No weapons. That's in a golf bag. I mean, I don't know where the knife is. That's in a lake in Chicago. Don't make me get on a plane. Oh, I cut my knuckle on the 9 when I was dialing 911. That's where the blood's from. I swear. Where's Robert Kardashian? Help me please. But no. No, no, no, no, don't think that. No, no, no, no, don't think that. Has anyone hurt? Need rescue? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I love it. Don't make me get into Broncos. Now what is he doing? Does he call 911 back? Oh no, 911 calls his home I believe. I guess they were disconnected or something and then 911 usually calls back. Okay, so here's the second. Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is...

Hello, OJ, how is... Hello, OJ, how is... She's a white girl. Okay, thank you. I got to go and see if I can find her. Okay. All right. That's all I do to a white girl. This has got to be a comedy routine. I believe Al Cowling's driving. OJ calls 911. It's OJ putting out a prank call tag. Is that what's going on here? The best OJ. I call 911 around the country. Get my 911 comedy tape. OJ calls 911. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. I call 911 around the country. Hello, 911? 911 operator. Is your refrigerator running now? Yes, it is. Well, you better catch it. 911? 911, what's your emergency? Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a can? What do you mean? Do you have Prince Albert in a can? Yes, we do. Well, you better let him out before he suffocates. That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape. Audio is not. Hello, is this 911? Yes. Do you have 10 pound balls? Yes, we do. How do you walk? You'll skip the best of OJ Simpson. I gotta go now. I gotta find her. I think he's all concerned. Man, is he bored, huh? Oh, man. I was hoping he would do the same as butt plug, try calling. Hello, 911? Yes. I'm looking for Michael Hunt. Is he there? He goes by the name of Mike. Is he there? He goes by the name of Mike. Come off along with your favorite murderer, OJ. Number one? Yes? Uh, buttplug. Bug-bug? Buttplug. What are you looking for? Buttplug, buttplug. Don't make me cut your throat, mother... Does OJ do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape? Kind of like the Jerky Boys? I come down there with my tube box. I bash your head in with a ratchet. Or a knife. I'm OJ. Oops, I just put myself on a piece of foam rubber. I better fly to Chicago. Oh, man. That's the OJ Simpson 9-1-1 comedy. Audio's not. Friggin' OJ, man. He's back. I like him. Thank God. There you go. From the LNA archives. One of our faves, by the way. I love that. I love the fact that he's still in the news every so often. Just pops up. But OJ... So Pedro Guerrero was caught with 15 keys... Pedro Guerrero caught with 15 kilos of cocaine and a dead hooker in his trunk. And the story never made the regular news. No, no, no, no. Because OJ knows this. No, no. That's right. Pedro Guerrero. And then OJ said she bought a Mustang... Mother Smith just carjacked me. I swear. Mother Smith... Oh my God. Wait a minute. I just heard shots fired and I see Deacon Jones running down the street with a gun. I swear, you know Deacon Jones. He was accused of killing two people. I swear, Lawrence Taylor smoking crack. Oh wait, that's two. Oh, let me know. Oh my God. Oh my God. All of the Dallas Cowboys are raping women. Hello? Hello? I just saw Brian Piccolo shooting somebody. Oh, wait a minute. He's dead. Who killed him? Are you talking about a Mustang? Yeah, was it a Mercedes or a Mustang? What kind of car was it? No, no, no. He gets everything all screwed up. Yeah, this Enquirer article. I can't wait. That'll be good. Right from the bitch's mouth. Well, there you go, Anthony. Brilliant. Another OJ story. He makes it interesting every day. All right, we gotta take a quick break. We'll be back. 2127571027. You guys in conflict, piss me off, okay? 1027WNEW 2127571027 We have to talk about our third contest that's running right now, Anthony. We're contest crazy. In an O&A sort of way. Right. Let's not forget we're also doing Mommy, What Would You Do for NSYNC Tickets. I hate to be biased because our contests don't feel like our children. But I do have a favorite. And it is Mommy, What Would You Do for NSYNC Tickets. Nice. The concept is great. You got the mothers of young daughters that want to see NSYNC very badly. The young girls. Right. And the mothers will do anything to make their little girl happy. Absolutely anything. Because the ages of the girls that usually want to see NSYNC, it's just when they start buttin' heads with the mom. Right. Trying to make it their own ground. So the moms will usually do anything to make their girls happy. And what better than NSYNC Tickets? My God. Well, we got to figure out how to do this contest the right way this time. Yeah. Because our Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears contest fell apart. Will it? Yeah. But I mean it turned out okay because we finally got one mommy to come down here and shoot bottle rockets out of her... out of her... Okay. Look. What? You can't say that word just not in that context. Oh. Like I could say, you're being a stupid twat. And that would make the air. Right. But you can't refer to certain parts of the female anatomy. So when I said... That word. That a mommy came down here and was shooting bottle rockets... Stop. Out of her... Oh God. Jesus. What? Look, I'm out of dump now. Oh, all right. No, I'm just trying to learn. Well, why don't you sit down with CBS lawyers and they can beat you about the head and neck with phone books. I've been doing radio half my life but I don't know all the rules. Yes, it's all... So I'm glad you're teaching me this one. It's all in the context, open. Yes, I know. I could say, you're being a dick. Right. But then you can't use that same word to describe a certain part of the male anatomy. Ah. See how it works? It's so simple, plain and clear. Well, the fact remains that mommy came down here and shot bottle rockets out of a peach. There you go. Out of a peach. Yes. Out of her whale's eye. Uh-huh, that's also good. Okay. So we saved that contest but barely. Yes, because we had a bunch of contenders that were going to come up. Remember anal sex? Yes, I remember. We're going to have a couple come up here and have anal sex. Yes, I remember. What is that about? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. See, what does that have to do with anything? They were going to have anal sex so their young son can see Britney Spears. Correct. Right here in front of everybody. Correct. They blew us off. Yes. The mother-daughter queefing team blew us off. But they did queef over the phone which is very good. Remember the daughter had the high piccolo type queef and the mother was more like a bassoon. It was cute. Yes, it was a family moment right out of the Waltons I would say. Very, very quaint moment. Right. We just need more people. Instead of like setting a day aside where we have all the mommies come down and then we look like losers when only one mommy shows up. I think we should just say contest is on. Oh, that's good. So now if somebody has an idea they come down and do it. They can come down tomorrow and set the bar. Okay. I like that idea. That's much better than a one day no one shows up thing. Oh, because those days just suck. Yes. So contest is on. Yes. What would you do for Nsync tickets? Yeah. All right. And also feel free to call. Let us know what this is before you stop that. Ah, Jay Marco. What's up? Oh my God. I have to have these tickets. Please. Oh my God. I love Nsync. Oh my God. I should have. Three simple words. I am gay. Oh my God. I should have said good morning America on Monday for six hours in the cold and I just felt the top of their head. That's all I can see. Marco, Marco, give us a hey. Hey. It's him. I just have to confirm it. Do you want to confirm the hey to make sure it's him Anthony? Hold on Marco. Let me get my hey. I got the hey. Oh, okay. Here is your hey. Here's Marco doing the famous hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. That's him. Gay. Hey. All right, Jay Marco. Oh my God. Hey. Oh my God. I have fantasies of having an orgy with Nsync. Oh, God damn it. Jesus. Justin Timberlake on the bottom. Ben me. Ben J.C. Poor guy. Ben Joey Orale. He's right. Ben Lansing Chris in each hand. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. I love him. You have everything working. Hands, feet, mouth. It looks like a puppeteer. Love him. Love him. That's unbelievable this guy. That's no strength. Oh my God. It's the no strength. All right. You're very excited. Marco, even though there's no chance in hell we would ever consider you coming down here and doing something, what would you do for Nsync tickets? I would give all sex to a woman even though it would make me vomit. Yeah. That's disgusting. You know something? I would do it. Now that might be funny. I would do that. Oh my God. That's as bad as asking a straight guy to do it to another guy. To hobnob. Oh my God. This guy is so unbelievably gay that the thought of a lady naked in front of him disgusts him. Oh God. The smell of it. It was just like. Marco, just imagine it. We bring in a hot 19 year old lesbian with huge 34 D's. You pull down the tight cotton panties and they're staring you in the face. Oh my God. I have shrinkage. They're staring you in the face in the sweetest, youngest, ripest peach peach. Then you slowly approach it getting that nice unbelievable fragrance. You know you're close. Then after a little nuzzling, your face peaked my friend. Oh my God. That's right. You take a taste of the peach. All of a sudden you hear her say. Now that would be a hell of a sex campaign. What do you think, Marco? I would do anything. I would succumb to anything to see him say, I love them. Hey. Hey. Baby, you're not the only one. You don't have to be afraid. Is he hearing us? I would sing all the songs. Hey, why don't you sing along to this song for us? Yeah, sing along. I can't hear it. All right, you fag. Hold on. Hold on. You should be able to hear this. Ready? Go. It's tearing me apart when I'm with you. Hey. When we are apart, I feel it too. And no matter how much I try to hold you, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. And no matter what, I can't. I can't. Come on, sing. We're going to win out here. Sing, you homo. Come on. All right, now wait, then I have to get out, you guys. What? I have Nets tickets for Sunday night. I'm already going. My boyfriend dumped me this week, so I'm so sad. He took a dump on you? We broke up. I have nobody to go with to the game. I'm so sad. Yeah, like it's so hard to find another fag. Pull out your fag bait and troll around Christopher Street. Everyone is begging us to have Marco eat the peach. Well, that would be funny. Marco, you're dead serious. You really want these N'Sync tickets. I want these tickets so bad. Oh my God. I have to see them. I have to breathe the same air as JC. Oh my God. All right, listen. Listen. Let me put the plea out there. We need a lady. If you're a faithful listener to this show, we need a lady to take one for the team. Marco, can I ask you something? What would be more heinous to you, a very hot looking girl or an ugly looking, maybe out of shape type girl? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's equally as disgusting. I guess that's like asking us what would be worse, a hot guy or a hot girl. Or a fat guy. Or beer-bellied guy. It's like how do you make that choice unless you're Rick? Hey Marco. Yeah? What if we found a girl that is willing to have you take a taste of her peach and then she gets you to go to N'Sync with you? Oh, I don't care. Fine. Yes. That is very interesting. I don't have a boyfriend anymore so it doesn't matter. The only thing is it really takes out of the mix the doing it for your child's sake because the mother now would have to go. Or send her daughter with Marco. Sure, I'll babysit. Which is probably a safe date. That's a very safe date. Unless you've got an ass like a nine year old boy. I mean come on, we'd do all the songs together. I could do her hair. Oh my God. What a fan. Oh my God. Do you think Richard Gere is cute? Oh no. No? No? Someone is moaning. Sadika? Yes? Why are you moaning? Because I want to see N'Sync. How old are you? I'm a little girl. How old are you? 18. You're 18 and you want to sing N'Sync? Yes. She's crying. Are you crying? Yes. Why? Because I love her so much. Alright, Marcelle cry along with Sadika. Oh my God, I love Sadika. I love Sadika. Oh my God. Hey. I want to see them so bad. Sadika, you love them, huh? Yes. Have you ever seen them? Yes, I've seen them before. Have you ever had a gay guy go **** on you? Oh my God. So now, why are you crying though? I don't get it. Because I love them. You don't understand. You don't know unless you're there. I've never been to any of their concerts. I thought you just said you saw them already. No, I went to their hotel. Oh, and you saw them going into their hotel? Absolutely, yes. And that's why this contest is pure brilliance. Absolutely. Mommy, what would you do for her in sync tickets? But now it's getting even more twisted. Yeah, because now this girl is 18. You're 18 and you're so like... How good are our seats? Great. We have great seats. Oh God. Is that the girl in one? I know, who was that? Right. Sadika. Yes? Great seat. Yeah. Really close. You'll get a great view. Who's your favorite? Joey. Oh. What's wrong with Joey? What's the matter, Marco? Eww, he's so dirty. No, he's not. Don't you make fun of Sadika. He's not hot. Well, calm down everyone because we got a proposition for everyone on the phone. We know they're all equally as hot. No. No. Joey's the cutest. Sadika. J.C. is most talented. No, Jake's the cutest. No, he's not. I hope... A fag and an 18 year old girl arguing over... Listen, listen, listen. Someone better make sure that Kristen on line one does not hang up. Right. She is willing to do this, but we'll give Sadika a try. Sadika. Yes? What are you willing to do for NSYNC tickets? Anything. Anything. Would you be willing to come into the studio? What do you look like? Yeah, give us a little description. I'm 5'4", brown hair, blue eyes, 125 pounds. Nice body? Yes. Young, firm, big boobs, small boobs. Big, very nice. Of what is your heritage? Huh? What is your heritage? What's your background? Hello? Yeah, what's your background like your heritage? What race are you? I know the word's a big one, but what's your nationality? Sadika. Hey, where'd she go? Sadika. God damn it. She's gone. Yeah, something clicked. Marco. Yes? I think she might call back. That's why I said make sure we don't hang up on Kristen. Kristen! Yes, what's going on? Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you the one willing to take one for the team? Yes, but I want something in return. I don't like them pink, so I don't want that. Can I ask for something? Oh my God, we got a ton of guys that might be able to... Okay, I have really, really good seats for Dice. I'm going to MSJ. Okay. I want to know if there's any way in hell I'd be able to at least meet him and say hi. Can we get this girl backstage to meet Dice? I think we can. I think we can. Okay. You would be willing to let Gay Marco taste your peach. Oh God. Yes. I even asked my husband and he said it was okay. Oh my God. Why would he say it's okay? Because the guy is gay. And he's so mine. Can you be in the room at the same time? No, Gay Marco, this cannot be pleasurable to you at all. Stop playing. I can bring three of my girlfriends with me and they can correct him while he does it. The three girls all have to be like topless and you're like bottomless and then Marco has to do the thing. Oh God. How bad do you want these tickets, buddy? Oh my God, I want them so bad. Kristen, describe how hot you are and listen to Marco lose it. Well, I have really big boobs. There you go. Boobs, Marco. Gay Marco. I have like blondest brown hair and I'm five foot one and. Nice shape. I have a nice shape. You keep the peach trimmed. Oh, yeah, very. And I have a tattoo right next to it. Oh yeah. So Marco is going to be staring right at it inches away from the peach, Marco. And then. I'll run my fingers through his hair. Oh yeah. How long would you allow him to taste the peach? As long as you want to put him through the torture to get a ticket. You are a trooper. You are really a. How I got it. I got it. How about for the duration of one instinct to. That ain't bad, though. That's like three minutes and Marco will even allow you to pick the instincts off. OK. But if there's not action going on during the whole song, they're out. Oh, my God. Marco, have you ever done anything with a girl? No. Never. Oh, my God. I love it. I think we don't have contest rules yet, and I think we might have to change the current day. Yeah. Could you see Marco getting finished and going, that was great, guys. Yeah. I'll turn him straight. When's Talek coming to town? Dan's got a great suggestion. What did Dan say? That might be hard to pull off. Listen to Marco yell. Dan, what's up? Hey, how are you? Good. Tell Marco your suggestion. Listen, the sad guy, wouldn't it be a little more torture if he had to have vaginal intercourse for a month? Impossible. Why is it impossible? Yeah, why is it impossible? Yeah, why? It's just not going to happen. Why? Because, I mean, right now I have shrinkage so much, I couldn't even have thought of this. All right. Thank you, Dan. Don't just stare at it. Marco? Yeah. All right. And the deal is what? Marco has to eat the peach. Yeah. Marco, who is just a flaming fag, has to now go south on a girl for the first time ever. To Marco, you guys got to understand this. For Marco to do this, it is as disgusting as one of us going south on a guy. There you go. Marco, are you going to be all right? I don't even know what I would do. God damn. He's never done this before. Yeah, he's going to be real experienced. All I know is like suction. He's going to kind of stroke something. Right. Only knows his suction. Oh, God. Thank you, Marco. Thanks for that visual. I think we got a connection. Yeah, let's arrange a date that we can do this. Marco, when can you do this? Well, I have to go to work and see what Dan did and get off. All right. Get off. Where? From the florist or the... The florist. Yeah. The florist. Yeah. The florist. Yeah. The florist. Yeah. So, you're from the florist or the interior decorator company? From the factory. Oh, that's right. The sausage factory. You work there? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Hey. Bye, bye, bye. He's so gay. Sing, Marco. Bye, bye, bye, bye. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Other side. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. listening to in sync and being f***ed out by a fag. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Yeah, we can't quite be so graphic. That was good, but yeah, it didn't make the radio. Oh, sorry. Yeah. You want to block out all the noise is what you're saying, so you need headphones. Yeah. You don't want to hear the music and you certainly don't want to hear Marco. Yeah, I just want to pretend I'm somewhere else. Okay. A better way of putting it. This is probably going to be the worst oral you're ever, ever going to have in your life because he's just not even going to know what to do with it. Oh, my God. If I don't vomit. Marco, I'll be dreaming about you. We got everyone's number and info and everything. And Marco? What have I done? Well, you're going to, hey, you're going to go to in sync is what you've done. Oh, my God. Yes, calm down. Marco, I got some audio of us the day you have to eat the peach. Don't just stare at it. Eat it. Right. We might have to brief them on some techniques. Yeah, we'll have like a bunch of guys call and help them out with some pointers and stuff. We'll walk you through it. There are certain, you know, little basic rules to adhere to. Right. There you go. It's not like painting a fence. It's not like a man either, so you don't have to use your fist. Oh. Oh. He's so happy. He's so, what's another word for happy? Gay. That's right. All right. We got to take a quick break. We'll be back. Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven. Oh, please. Anthony. Oh, and I rule. Conquerors, you bastards. One, oh, two, seven, w, n, e, w. N, e, w. I'm a listener for 20 years. Yesterday, I was working and I was in my car and I wanted to respond to something Carol Miller said.
