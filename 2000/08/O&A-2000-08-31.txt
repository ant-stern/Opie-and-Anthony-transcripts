 The Opie and Anthony Show. Oh, there it was, baby! Yeah, sure. 107 WNEW. So how was your Thanksgiving, Anthony? Ah, I spent a little time with the family, Opie. Sure. Over at Grandma's for the big, you know, Italian Thanksgiving. Very nice. All the food that you could feed an army with. And I was right up there, right next to the head of the table. I made it all the way up. Yeah, congratulations. Thank you. Felt pretty good, because my brother wasn't there this year. He was over at his in-law's. So I got to move up into the Joe seat. So there I was, like right before the head of the table. I looked down at the little card table at the end, remembering years and years ago when I was there. And I had to, I remember the middle of the table. Sure. I remember when I became a teenager and worked my way up from the card table to the real table, but way at the card table end. Well, how many people had to die in your family to get that space? Oh, quite a few. Quite a few. And then, you know, I worked my way up, and as I was sitting there next to the head of the table, thinking there's only one more place to go, you start feeling old. Old, Opie. Of course, it is what you start feeling. So you're like the cool uncle in your family? Yeah. So are you like the cool uncle where you'll, you know, go get them high and stuff in the coat room? No, no. Or get a little sip or two here or there? They're like early teens, RJ and Chris. They're pisser, cool kids. Yeah, oh, they idolize me. It's great. Yeah. Yeah, I'm cursing like a banshee at the table and stuff, and they're just like, you are so cool. You were drunk again. Yeah. You were drunk again, obviously. Well, a couple of beers though. Not as drunk as my mom. So you're cool? My mom was at the point, she was at the I love you, F you stage. Really? Yeah, she gets like that every so often on the holidays. Was she snotted? She was drinking her wine. Oh, yeah. Boy, sitting there at the table all of a sudden. And then you bring up the last time we were all hanging out as a family and she was hitting the wine, and she's like, oh, scratch her ass. I wasn't saying that. I don't do that. Because we tell her when she really gets schnockered, she'll say, she'll talk to you and be like, oh, baby, my son, it's so good to see you again. You're like, mom, calm down. Oh, F you, F you, F you. No, but I love you. I love you. It's so good to see you again. All right, mom, look, I'm going to go into the kitchen. I'm going to leave. F you, F you. And it's not F you. It's the F word. Well, coke will do that to you. Oh, Jesus. You're saying my mom's doing coke? Well, I'm just assuming at this point. She's drinking some wine, having a good time with the family. Could be acid. Then we tell her that, you know, last time we were all together as a family, you got that I love you, F you phase. And she's like, oh, no, I wasn't. An hour later, I love you, F you phase. And then she's bringing up, you know, school when I was in school. Because remember the time I got you that lovely fur coat? Fur coat? Fur coat. She brought this up. I forgot about it. Elementary school. Did it go with your velour shirt that's on the FM talk website? Dude, I don't know what kind of. You were like a pimp when you were eight years old. I wish I was as cool as a pimp when I was in that grade. But it turned out all I was was an elementary school kid going to elementary school in a fur coat. My mother's like, oh, I kept you warm. I go, no, the coat didn't. The blood running from my nose over my body kept me warm because I'd be beat up. Hey, Anthony, you're a faggot. Only faggots and women wear fur coats. I don't know what kind of dope she was doing. She comes home one day from the store. I'm just thinking I want a snorkel jacket like all the other kids had in school. But no, my mother said, you know, you ever see on the sidelines of the football games, Joe Namath wears a fur coat. Oh, yeah. Joe Namath wears a fur coat. Joe Namath was also a quarterback for the Jets at the time. You know, pretty cool job. So he could pretty much wear whatever the hell he wanted. Right. People are going to still hang out with him. Exactly. Who's that other big black guy that had the daughter in the films, the football player? He used to crochet on the sidelines. Rosie Greer. Sure. He would crochet on the sidelines. Right? Right. Anybody going to crack him in the head? Hey, Rosie, you faggot. Of course not. If I was to crochet in fifth grade, what would happen to me? You'd be dead. The crochet hook would be in my rectum. Everyone knows that. You wear a fur coat. It doesn't matter. Joe Namath wears one on the sidelines. I was being beat up because mom got me a fur coat. She was always like a head of the trend and like she was going to make us. We were models, fashion models, a fur coat. Give me my snorkel jacket. By the time you were in ninth grade, were you dressing like Clyde Frazier? Yeah. I wanted jeans. I wanted a T-shirt. I wanted sneakers like I dress now. So she brought up the fur coat at the Thanksgiving Day table. Yeah. And I totally forgot about it. But yes, she had gotten me a fur coat. All those family memories come up in Thanksgiving. Things you wish you could never remember again. Another thing, like sneakers, I always wanted the, what were they, the PF Flyer high top black sneakers. Those are the ones I want. You look like a hoodlum. If you wear those, you look like a hoodlum. You want to look like one of the. And then she used the N word and stuff. Wow, she would? You know, Italian. So, you know. Hey, come on. She's older now. She goes to church. She goes to church now. Come on. You know, that was a long time ago. But I wanted to wear the high top black PF Flyer sneakers. And my mother would always come back with these, those stupid white skippies, you know, the stupid sneakers with the rubber front and everything. Your typical wonder years sneakers. Sure. You know, and I was pissed. And pants. I wanted jeans. I wanted to go to school in jeans. She'd get me like dress slacks. And yes, your slacks and a dress shirt and a tie for the first day of school. I'm there with a briefcase. I swear to God. You would think I was closing deals for IBM the way she dressed me to go up to the fifth grade. I had a briefcase and a shirt matching shirt and tie, which my brother had to wear the exact same thing. Are we twins? No, no. But she dressed us like we were. So now everyone thought you were twins. Right. And we had to have the same little ties and pants and shoes. in her disco diva phase. She bought me platform shoes. Dude, platform shoes, disco shoes. I had the big platform shoes. I swear I had eight inch platform. I looked like that jerk off in Saturday Night Fever. Tony, you're going to call me Tony. Tony, give me a call. She's pregnant, father. You think the pope could get her an abortion, father? Tony, you didn't even call me. Look, Tony, I'm dancing. Tony, I'm dancing on the bridge, Tony. I had those big, dopey shoes. That's classic. And then one time my sister's dogs, she had two little dogs, eight, the shoes. Yeah, baby. That was Nick. My sister's dog ate the heels of the shoes, the big platform shoes. I was like, thank you. Extra can of kennel ration for you. Back to my skippies. That's why I dressed like this. Because for years I couldn't. I wanted jeans, sneakers, and a t-shirt my whole friggin' life. So now I wear what I want. And then I go to Thanksgiving dressed the same way. And my mother's like, you look like a slum. I go, sorry, I don't have my platform disco shoes and fur coat, mom. So you could have got the fur coat out of the closet for you. Yeah, I'm sure. Look like I'm coming out of the closet with that friggin' thing on. But her big excuse was Joe Namath wore a fur coat on the sidelines, walking back and forth. Remember when he was injured a lot of times and he had that wacky coat? Yeah, he was still on the field and stuff. He walked back and forth the sidelines. He had this big fur coat. But he could pull off that look, man. He had the blondes by his side. He had two people pulled off that look. And there were stories in the paper how he's banging broads in between quarters and stuff. Joe Namath and Fred Mertz. Remember that when he put the big coat on? Very good. 23 is going to do. Hey, Ethel, let's jitterbug. I'm going to get some broads with this coat. Come on, Rick. He had a big furry bear coat. That's what I looked like. So was your childhood idol Joe Namath in it? Yeah, you know. Were you wearing pantyhose like him, too? He did do the commercial for the pantyhose. No, thank God my mother didn't feel I should be wearing pantyhose. All right. Let's go to Caesar. Caesar, what's going on today? Anthony, you are a homo, man. Come on. Listen, did mama also buy the little fox skin scarf to match the coat? No, there was no fox skin scarf. Yes, it was a little mink skin. I bet you it was a gay coat. She put me on a bad gay coat in elementary school where, gee, people aren't judging you too much by what you look like. Hey, buddy, I bet she tied the mittens to the sleeve of the coat, too. No, it wasn't that drastic. You're a faggot, man. I had the big dopey galoshes and stuff. I wanted fireman boots, you know? Things with the big metal clips. Sure. I get the totes. Totes galoshes. Put on your robbers. You were obviously poor like myself growing up. No, she did pretty good, you know? I mean, it was all... No, she was more like she would spend more to make me look like an asshole. Now I know why Boomer beat you up in elementary school. Yeah, exactly. You had your cute little fur coat on. My fur coat. I wanted a bomber jacket, you know? I wanted regular high-top P.F. Flyer sneakers, jeans, just looking like a kid. But no, my mother figures she's dressing me up like I'm in GQ or something. GQ? Well, that's what they would. They would put stupid things like fur coats on the models and stuff. And she would see it and go, oh, that's a great look. She used to dress me up like that. She was goofing on me because she said over Thanksgiving, she said, well, when you dress yourself, you look ridiculous. What do you mean? And she pulls out pictures of me with striped pants and a plaid shirt. I'm walking around like that. I'm like, so? That doesn't go. I'm like, I don't care if it went or not. That's the 70s look, though. That's groovy. That stuff went in the 70s. Just like Greg Brady. Haven't you seen the Brady Bunch? They say it's in. I remember going for back-to-school shopping and stuff. You know, you go to the department store and walk around and you'd see stuff you want. You're like, oh, that's good. That's good. Oh, no, that's crap. That's what that low life so where you know, Charles Nelson Riley is wearing a scarf off to the right. Oh, you should wear that. Yeah, I can't see that. Oh, if there's a picture with you with Charles, I need to see that. Where's my gun? Oh, the ghost of Mrs. Mure. Charles Nelson Riley. Oh, I'll tell you one thing. If she would have bought me that coat when I was like 13, 14, I'd have banged it. Well, what's with the fur on this coat, Anthony? Why? It's like Liberty spikes at the punk rock. The Opie and Anthony Show. You will never see a more wretched hive of gum and villainy. W.M.E.W. And we got to welcome Rick, our producer, back to the show. He's back. Rick, now a married man. Yep. Hold it up high. Let me say. Oh, hold it up. There it is. Wow. Boy, that is a prominent ring. Jesus, there ain't no mistake in that. I've been tagged on a return to the wild. She knows exactly what I am saying. That looks like a tagging. This one's been tagged. Look at him. I saw that guy this weekend. Isn't he funny? He's really funny. He doesn't care what the hell he's doing. I've seen him stick his head in a cave where there were snakes and the snakes started biting his face. And he's just like, Look at these gorgeous creatures. They're gorgeous. They're biting my face. This is gorgeous. And he's got his wife with him. Yeah. She's some American broad. And they're in the middle of a river and there's crocodiles in there. And you see one go by, a big one. He's like, Watch the boat, honey. And he jumps in. And he starts like grabbing the mouth and he's talking as he's doing it. I'm going to try to roll him over before he goes into a death roll. Death roll? They do it like a croc will grab onto something and then roll. It just spins. And also whatever it's grabbed onto, it's ripping a chunk out of it as the croc spins. Usually it's some poor, dopey wildebeest that went into the river. Not this dopey Australian guy who's trying to wrestle on his home turf. He's got his alligator home turf. I've got him now. Look at it. Honey, okay honey, now jump in. And he gets his wife in there to sit on the croc's head. Sit on his head, honey. I'm going to stick my thumb up his bum and see if he's male or female. Well, this weekend he was chasing crocodiles. He was chasing them? Yeah, there was some form of crocodile. They moved pretty damn fast and stuff. And he was chasing them. They were about three, four feet long. He could run like a mother and he's running all over the places and tackling these things. He doesn't care. You've seen him with all kinds of animals. He gets bitten. He had a kangaroo once and he was trying to wrestle that thing down. And the things just kicking the crap out of him. He's gorgeous. Look at the color on this. It's just bleeding and everything. Bob, what's going on? You ever notice that he's always wearing those same khaki shorts and t-shirt? That's all he owns. That Australian outback kind of wears. The guy jumps in the ocean. He's going to rescue a shark from a net. He's wearing the same khaki shorts and t-shirt. Yeah, he doesn't change. No, he doesn't change. His wife throws in the scuba tank and he's still wearing this. He's seen scuba diving underwater in the shirt. In his crocodile Dundee outfit. Right, he's got the boots on over his flippers. He's some kind of superhero, I think. I don't know what the hell he is. And then he's diving with those sharks and he sticks his hand in the coral and pulls it out. It's totally bloody. You see him on the boat. Look, he got my hand. He seems to have bitten me. Yeah, no crap. Look at what you're doing. You're taunting him. The guy has no fear whatsoever. He's swimming with crocodiles going into mud holes. He ducks underneath the water, underneath the rocks and pulls out those little crocodiles. Where the hell did you get that thing from? Look at him. Isn't he gorgeous? Yeah, and he's crawling along next to him, right? Sticking his face in the thing's nose. He bit me. He bit my face. I saw him. He was holding a snake that thing laid right into his nose. Oh no, don't do this at home. Yeah, sure. I was really just thinking of going out and doing that at home. Trying to find a snake. Thank you, Bob. He was chasing some kind of animals with a land rover. And he's on the bumper trying to rope it. And he missed. So he just tells his wife to pull up next to it and jumped off the rover onto this thing's head. It looked like he was being trampled. Because he was. I got him, honey. I've got him. Like hoof marks in his face. Look, it's gorgeous. You think he throws his wife around like that in the bed? Probably. Look, I'm going to roll her. She's going into a death roll. Now I'll stick my thumb up her bum. I'm going to give her what we call the lichus. Take a u-log over her head. Jason, what's going on? Yeah, how are you doing, guys? I saw him making excuses for a poisonous snake once for trying to bite him. I'd be right angry too late if I was in your house trying to get my baby. And he's coming like two inches from me, snapping away. And him and his wife are trying to catch these poisonous snakes in South America. And he's making excuses for them for trying to bite them. The guy's such a tool that you've got to watch him. You've got to love him. I was laughing so hard. Crocodile, hunter. Between that and the Giants game, I had a lot of comedy this weekend. Hello? Hello. Who is this? Hi, my name's Bill. And I have a problem with a stain on a dress. I'd like to know if you could get a stain out of a dress. Excuse me, what is that? I have a stain on a dress that I'd like to know if it can be dry cleaned out. It's a big splooge stain. You have to bring over so I don't know. You don't know if you could get a splooge stain out? What kind of stain? It's splooge. It's a big old splooge stain. And it could get me in a lot of trouble. And I just want to know if you could get that out. I don't know. You don't know? Because the stain now, I don't know. You have to see it. Well, I'll let you know. It's on a black cocktail dress. And it's right on the front, right underneath where the chin would be. I don't know. And it's a big old splooge stain. It's bigger than the... We don't know. It kind of dripped out. I kind of missed it. It's a big old splooge. What do you use to get splooge out? What kind of chemicals best used for splooge? I heard that commercial, protein gets out protein. Shouldn't that wash itself out then? I don't understand what you say. I don't understand. It's splooge. I don't understand. You know splooge. I don't understand. Like Yankee, Yankee, cranky. When you're Yankee, cranky. I don't understand too much English. Okay. Sorry. When you Yankee the cranky. You... Go ahead. Oh my God. Don't be an A-hole. You seem a little drunk, Anthony. Go ask yourself. Okay. It's the Opie and Anthony Show. This is 1027 WNEW. 212-757-1027 if you have anything. Matt, what's going on? Hi, how are you doing? What's going on? All right. Listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101. Why? Because he was just ripping you guys up. I was flipping through the stations while you guys were on break. Yeah. And he said that they were going to say in the newspaper that they just cloned them to monkeys. Because now that you guys... Now they have somebody taking your guys place, you guys should take a break. Oh, that's pretty funny. Everybody talking about the Opie and Anthony Show. We don't mind. We don't care. Keep talking. All right, guys. Later. Thank you. CBS? CBS taking jabs at us? Yep. Isn't that the... That's oldies, right? That's the elephant graveyard. Yeah. That's where like the old... That's where the old jocks go to die. Hello, love. CBS now... We must be getting popular. CBS is now taking shots at us. How could they even do that? How could they even do that? Isn't that just the music station? Don't they have like strict rules? Who knows? You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it is out and go to the next Sherelle song or something. You have to go around the corner. Hey, Donald, what's up? Hey, how you doing? All right. I was just listening to CBS. My uncle had it on. He said that they cloned twin monkeys. Yeah. And he said, Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now. Keep talking about us. Pretty funny though. I can't believe it. You guys are great, man. Thank you. You got to give them something because that's a pretty funny line. It's a funny line, but if you're going to try to like get to us, you got to come up with something a little bit more than that. CBS have fun. Hey. Hello. They cloned a couple of monkeys. Looks like Opie and Anthony could be taking a vacation. Hey, get some CBS music. We'll do it how they did it, probably in between records because they only get like 15 seconds to do their shtick, Anthony, you know? Yeah. Let's see if we can talk it up like they do over there. I wish we had the echo. We need the massive echo chamber. Where it sounds like you're like playing basketball in the gym, doing a radio show at the same time. Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like. All right. Wow. Hello, love. We don't have that, though. I don't know why they do that. God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business. Well, our pals at the radio message board, the industry little dumping ground for all the people all week and long. And today, once again, we're just the popular post. All right, and you want to be the CBS FM DJ? What song is it? Dissing Us, Joy to the World. Oh, yeah? Guess you have to do it right up to the post, Anthony. OK, I'll try. Hey, CBS FM, it's Harry Balls here. Oh, this is a short intro. Yeah, we need a long intro. We need a much longer intro than that.

Miss Tabarimad, Miss Tabarimad, I like the Shatner version better. CBS FM. Are you getting better as we go along here? The hell is this? Oh, gypsy sluts and whores on CBS. That's all they get to say, though. Like, that's pretty much the gig over there. You've got to do everything you've ever wanted to say in your life in like three seconds. You don't even get a chance there. Oh, that one, you know. Here, try this one. Hey, everybody. Harry Sack with you on CBS FM. You know, they closed a couple of monkeys and I can't talk about it because the music started. I wish I was over at Eddie W. See, he had to pick the perfect song to do it.

I like catching hummers. I'm catching one right now under the console from windy CBS. I can get a job over there, right? I think you can, man. As long as you can goof on stupid stuff. You just got to say inane crap in between all the crappy music. Hey, everybody. I'm going to get a hairy crotch with you. Oh, I was just looking at the name of the song. Well, it's a tricky job. I keep stepping on the words because I'm diddling myself. CBS. That's some gig they got over there, though. If all you had to do was like during the music, plan out what you're going to say over the and listen to the beginning of the song. Hey, the Osmond Brothers.

I don't have anything to say to that. That's alright. I need a good song about like, effing. Do that one. Track one, man. That's a hit. That's a CBS FM hit right there. Do I track one over there? On this one. Let me turn down your echo for a second. I love the echo. Hold on, we might have to start using that here. And AW. John, what's up? I tell you, I'm laughing so hard I'm about to have an angina. I know it's inside, but that puts me in the same age group as the DJs on CBS. Alright, very good. Thank you, John. There goes John. Alright, turn up Ant Echo again. Here we go. Where's my echo? Hey, is this a live cut? Yeah. Alright, everyone. Elton John on CBS with a video of the Jets.

Alright. Thank you, Andy. Alright, bye. Hey, everyone. It's Hey Would You Blow Me here on CBS FM. This one, Billy Preston going back to 1974. Nothing from nothing.

Do you guys think this actually is hysterical? Yes, we do. You think this is really funny? Yes. Our caller, Frank, you're on the air. This is really... I've been listening to you guys. It's just insider. I don't think it's funny. You know, CBS FM is a station that's responsible for bringing rock and roll to this city. Ho ho, Frank. Looks like Hitler missed a few. CBS. It's not funny, man. It's just not funny. It's not funny. You're saying it's not funny. It's not funny. It's not right, man. It's just not right. I'm coming through because that's all that matters. Your record's coming through. You need a little bit more if you really wanna know the truth. All right, Frank. What's the deal with that other station? I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Why are you... CBS doesn't understand it. Why are you marking on CBS FM? And dedicated to him will play just a little understanding. Take you right back to 1962, Frank. We understand you. We're listening here at CBS FM. What is the purpose of the echo? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

They make fun of us with one lousy line and we just did about an hour on them. Thank you for giving us an hour of material. You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now. O.P. and Anthony Show. Thank you. 1027 WNEW. Powered by O.P. and Anthony. Owned by Insinity Broadcasting. This is 1027 WNEW. This is New York. We can talk about O.J. real fast. Yeah, O.J. back in the news. With a 911 call. Let's check out the 911 call. Alright. State County Police and Fire. We're sure emergency. We have a problem here. I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab. We've been doing drugs with Payphone Reb. Anybody need rest here? We've been doing drugs for two days with Payphone Reb. We just got arrested. It's like cocaine. And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now. Is anybody hitting anyone right now? Anybody have any weapons? No, no. Does the police even rest? No. That's my favorite. Anybody have any weapons? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not this time. Not this time. She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons. Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody? No, no, not this time. I've got to hear that again. I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now. Is anybody hitting anyone right now? Does anybody have any weapons? Does the girl need a rescue? No, she doesn't need a red light. I thought she was going to get hit by the top. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now don't get started on that again. No, no. No weapons. That's in the golf bag. I mean, I don't know where the knife is. That's in a lake in Chicago. Don't make me get on a plane. Oh, I cut my knuckle on the nine when I was dialing 911. That's where the blood's from. I swear. Where's Robert Kardashian? Help me, please. Like, no, no, no, no, no, don't think that. No, no. I heard need rescue. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. I love don't make me get in a Bronco. Now, what does he do? Does he call 911? Oh, no, 911 calls his home, I believe. I guess they were disconnected or something. And then 911 usually calls back. OK, so here's this. Hello, OJ House. Oh, boy, I want you to call the police. Hello. OK. This is the Deuce. Now, what happened? I don't know. You hear OJ going, I want you to call the police. I had a hit over the head with the phone receiver. We were disconnected. I like them. This is the police department. Oh, she left. And I don't know what to do about it. This guy, Pedro Barrero, got arrested for having 15 keys of cocaine. This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him. Me and a friend just came over and said, you're going into a rehab. She got mad. She just got in her car. She drives a Mercedes. She lives in the cross-seats. Now, she is looted out of her mind. Get her Mustang driving around town somewhere. What other little things do you have to say about this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What other little things? You know her driver's license number, but you need to be stopped. What other little things? It's white. Like a black top. Like a bronco. He got in the way. She's a white girl. OK, thank you. I got to go into the light and find her. OK. All right. That's all I did, a white girl. This has got to be a comedy routine. I believe Al Cowling's driving. OJ called 911. It's OJ putting out a prank call, Ted. Is that what's going on here? The best OJ. I call 911 around the country. Get my 911 comedy tape. OJ calls 911. Hello, 911? 911 operator. Is your refrigerator running now? Yes, it is. Well, you better take it. 911? 911, what's your emergency? Hello, do you have Prince Albert in the plan? What do you mean? Do you have Prince Albert in the plan? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Do you have Prince Albert in a can? Yes, we do. Well, you better let them out before he suffocates. That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape. Order yours now. Hello, is this 911? Yes. Do you have 10 pound balls? I don't know. You're getting the best of OG, since. I got to go now. I got to find her. He's all concerned. Man, is he bored, huh? I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug. Hello 911? I'm looking for Michael Hunt? Is he there? He goes by the name of Mike. Laugh along with your favorite murderer OJ. Number one? Yes? Butt plug. Bug box? Butt plug. What are you looking for? Butt plug. Butt plug. Don't make me cut your throat, mother... Does OJ do any character voices on his prank call tape? Kind of like the jerky voices? I come down there with my tube box. I bash your head in with a ratchet or a knife. I'm OJ. Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber. I better fly to Chicago. That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape. OJ goes now. Freaking OJ. He's back. I love him. Hello, Lamb Chop. I'm free. I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty. I'm free at last. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? I thought you liked Sherry Lewis. The witch is dead. What do you mean by that? Thank God. Why do you sound so bitter? She gave you your break in showbiz. You'd be bitter too if you had a hand up your ass for 20 years. She wouldn't even take me off when she went to the bathroom if you catch my drift. Ah, come on. And then she thought it was cute calling me fucking Lamb Chop. That's like calling a cow meatloaf, you autistic bitch. I was the whole act and she knew it. We hated each other. She sucked. Oh, she's real creative. I haven't listened to that shit for 20 years. Creative? I'm a fucking sock. But then she didn't have a condom in her hand when she talked me up. Things would look a little different. See her fucking lips move when she talks. What kind of crap is that? It's a book to be a ventriloquist. Your mouth is moving like Monica Lewinsky. I'm a 45 cent sock from Woolworth that she made a fucking fortune off of. And I didn't get kicked. Lamb Chop, what's in your future? I'm going to be in a couple of new films. Lamb Chop sucks a big dick. And shove your fist in my ass. Here he is flying, that fucking bitch. Alright Lamb Chop, I better let you go more and some more. Bye bye, kids. Bye. Alright, it's Lamb Chop everyone. Keep the 14 year old away from us. Have a drink. I want to bang you. You're not going to hear this on Z100. Have a drink. I want to bang you. This is normal radio, right? Okay. K-O-N-E-G-E-U-7. K-O-N-E-W. Ah, Anthony Stackert, too. The world's strongest fat burner. It burns the fat. It's like a miniature microwave in your system burning away the fat. These are true scientists, the people that worked on Stackert, too. They know the way to burn fat is with a Stackert, too, fat burning capsule. You feel its effects 45 minutes after taking it or your money back. Eat what you want, lose the weight. No more of those midday cravings. Stackert, too, takes care of all that. It's great. And boy, what a lousy summer we've had. You know, you could just keep the heavy clothes on. No one's going to see that fat ass. You got to lose the weight on those trouble spots. Whatever. It's a good way to supplement the workout. Or if you don't have time to work out, pop the Stackert, too. You feel its effects. You get that boost of energy. Burns the fat. What else does it do, Opie? What else? It cuts the cravings to snacks. Screw trying to work out and eat right, man. Just pop the Stackert, too. The fat burns off. You got the nice body. Blah, blah, blah. Give them a call. 1-800-LIGHTLINE. That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. Stackert, too, the world's strongest fat burner. Our listeners have proven it works, Anthony. Alright, here it comes. Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler. We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Krull Indian Human Show. 1027 WNEW. This is Anthony and it's our pal, Laura Korn, everyone. Yeah, I remember. Listen to that. You guys have problems here. You know what the problem is? Do you laugh like that when you see a two and a half inch long? Imagine that. Imagine hearing this. Listen to it. I'll do the setup. Laura, check out my package. That's something you never want to hear. What is, by the way, the most retarded thing that's ever happened to you while you're having sex? Well, we talk about retarded sex. Anthony has retarded sex with his lovely wife. Can you do an instant replay right now? Everybody has retarded sex. They do. We do. It's just because you're always... You're moving all screwed up and everything. Get your leg over here, your arm. You're pulling my hair. Yeah. Oh, my hair. Oh, boy, this is good. You can look, but you better not touch. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know if we can take that. I don't know if I can take that for a couple hours. Oh, my God, guys. Okay. Don't make me laugh those deep belly laughs. That only comes out when it goes deep. Ah, there you go. Now, do I have kind of like an afterglow going on right now? Why? Did you get that? Yeah, I just had some hotel sex. You did? It was awesome. I've seen a lot of people... It's really cool. Laura looks like Barbara Eden. Yeah. Yes, master. And you just had hotel sex? I just had hotel sex. Bellboy, Bellboy, can I grab your bag? Who did you have sex with? I knocked him out. Oh, okay. Room service. Room service. You have a tube space. No, I'm with my guy. Oh. I did. It was really funny. And I hadn't done this page for a while. I actually did a page from the 52 Invitations called Heels and Squeals. Heels and squeals? And here's what I did. I put some heels on and I tied them to the chair. And then I teased him until he squealed. Oh. Whoa. Yes. Heels and squeals. Look at her. She does have an afterglow, doesn't she? I do. It was great. It was cool. But you should have taken a shower after your sex. You have one of those chocolate mints in your head. A pillow mint stuck to the back of your head. Oh, my word. I'm telling you, there's no one funnier than you guys on radio. Wow. More kissing on the head. I have been looking forward to this for so long. You have no idea. I think the ladies at The View are funnier than us. Oh, my God. Laura, we saw... I turn on The View. Oh, no. Which performance? And I see Laura on The View. Are you talking about how to turn a good girl bad? Yeah. But they kept cutting you off. I know. I know. The second you start getting into being Laura Korn and being fun and sexual, they're like, you know, Star Jones, like, hey, calm down there, honey. You calm down there, honey. We got people watching here who don't want to know nothing about that there, honey. I know I'm a diva. Diva? She's a diesel. I'm not a diva. But I wanted to see Laura Korn be Laura Korn. She's like losing it. And they wouldn't let her be her. That is funny. You said something and they just like nearly... Their jaws drop. You said something. I think you used the word vaginism. No, no, no, no. Actually, I said, you know, they were asking me about sex. I said, guys really like, you know, spontaneous, you know, kind of like... I think I said bend me over. Yes, bend me over and do me. Not exactly ready for daytime TV. Yeah, bend me over the table and do me. Honey, I don't want to hear that. First of all, you can't bend me over. And second of all, they know you're table strong enough to hold a big, fat Star Jones belly. Why does Star Jones now sound like the river now? No justice, no peace. Be careful. You almost got the mic caught in your mouth. I've got to defend the girls here for a second. Come on, guys. Now they are... What? What? No, it's a great show for guys. Oh, my God. It's torturous. We don't get that chat fest. What were you guys doing watching the show if you don't like the game? So we could get material for our show. I heard Laura Korn... I heard Laura Korn was on. I heard Laura Korn was on. I heard Laura Korn was on. I heard Laura Korn was on. So I tuned it in. And when I tuned it in, I wanted to see Laura. And I saw Laura being cut short by girls that seem a little uptight. You know what? They're all great girls. I really will say that. They've been really helpful in selling a lot of books for me. I really like them. I think what the problem was is it's very difficult, if you're going to go on the show and talk about a book, to talk to four women at the same time. That was what the problem was. And I started thinking about it afterwards because now I've got two people, but you've got four women trying to get in a word edgewise, nothing happens. And that's kind of what happened. But I really do like those girls. I really do. I think they're all neat. I understand the problem. You've got the four broads. You're trying to talk to them. They're talking back. The trick is, you know what you do, honey? You've got to fill their mouths up with something. You shut up three of them, then you can talk to the fourth one. Until she pisses you off. Then wham, you freak that one's mouth. And then you talk with the other one. Oh, so, how is your sex book there, Laura? Don't talk about it, though. It's a very touchy situation. Come here, honey. I shut you up. Now I'll talk to the fat one over here. Come here. I'd rather talk to your ass. Here, turn around. I want your good side. I'm going to talk to your ass now. All right, honey? Barbara, look at her over here. Methuselah. Gee, how old is this broad, huh? How old is Barbara? She's wearing a little, uh, you're trying to be a sexy Bippy number. It look like two sweat socks full of sand hanging off her chest. For God's sake. Barbara, the days are over. The days of dreaming of banging Geraldo, they're over. That was in the past. Then they got rid of that Debbie Manta-Toppel-a-Stu, the Greek broad who probably likes you from behind. Because you know how the Greeks are. The only good one in the bunch, the blonde that would bite the pillow. And they tore her out. But then they got the Egg Full Young broad in there now, so that's kind of hot. I hear they got ones that are sideways. I'll ring your gong, honey. Wow, the dice coming in out of nowhere. I had no idea he was going to hang with us today. Thank you, the dice man. I think I guess whenever a sexual topic comes up, dice likes commenting. I apologize if anybody was offended by dice's remarks. We try to keep them out of the studio. We can't control them right, Anthony. Look, he's out there now talking to the greased man. I wonder what they're talking about. Alright, Laura. So you didn't see the show when Barbara interviewed me? No, I missed that. It was really surprising because when I started talking about the famous page, the velvet tongue, she turns to the camera and says, I know all about the velvet tongue. No! I know about the velvet tongue. Hey, Barbara, let me give you a little hint, Babs. Before you start using your tongue for sex, try talking right with it. That's what it's there for, speech. Get that one down and then move on to the velvet tongue. I didn't need that vision. Wow. No, but it was kind of, I think it was surprised everybody on the set. Here's Barbara. You know, Walter's talking about... You never think of her going Hugh Downs on anybody. I bet you. No, you don't want to know something. See, now I think... That's wack. I bet Barbara in her heyday was... Way to go, huh? Yeah, I think her head hit the headboard. Whoa! I think she was kind of well-willed. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if she's still wild. I don't even want to picture that one. No, thank you. And Star Jones. Y'all, stop. Oh. What, she's a very sexual being? I think she is. Yeah? Yeah, I know you don't want to think of sex, but I mean, she is. I want to think of sex, but not with that. I don't know. I don't know. That's somewhere I don't want to go. We had a couple of beautiful African women in here yesterday. Did you? Oh my God. Were they really? What were they talking about? Who knows? Even now, you're working with me. Who cares? Who cares what's coming out of their mouth? Who cares what's going in? You understand? They didn't speak English. Yeah. Through most of the show. Uh-huh. Were you just trying to interpret what they were saying? Well, I understood because they were trying to grab my stuff. Yeah. Really? She was. Really? Now my chick is pissed. Is she? Yeah. Is she really? She heard the show yesterday and heard this girl trying to grab Opie's thingy. Well, at one point, what did she say? I want to tashi. I want to tashi. And she kept grabbing. Right. I want to tashi. Did he have a woody? No. It was hung like an acorn. That's a car. He was trying to fight her off. It was so funny. He had the chair. He was sitting with the back of the chair in the front, like guarding his region. And the girl's like, I want to tashi. I want to tashi. She's grabbing all around. Great. You would think he had a green card down his pants. Sobius Anthony and his pal Laura Korn, everyone. Laura. People are getting sick of your laugh, Laura. But that's OK. I know. I was apologizing about it. I mean, it's just... We warned our listeners this time, though, because last time it caught them off guard and they were driving off the road and stuff. I like the way one guy described her laugh on the instant feedback. It goes, I love Laura Korn, but I hate her laugh. It sounds like Opie's jumping on her chest. I wish. I wish. Whoa, look at that. We have a love connection. Can you put the Barbara Eden outfit on for me? Hey, I got to say hi to my brother-in-law, Fish. Fish? Fish? Who fouls my sister. Oh my God. Is that necessary? Fouling? I think maybe she might have a different opinion of what that is to her. They make love, Anthony. Right. They have a little one now, JD. They have a lovely little family. I shouldn't have said foul. Foul? My sister's going to kill me. Jiminy Cricket. I thought I was in radio mode and just realized that I was abusing my sister. That's just not a good thing. Anyway, Fish and Green Lawn, hey-o, we are playing our opening softball games tonight for my work team. Guess the name of their team? The Accurate Balloon Nuts. Why is it accurate? The Accurate Balloon Nuts? I don't get the accurate part, but their team is called the Accurate Balloon Nuts. Maybe there was already a team called the Balloon Nuts. Right. All right, Laura, you've been asking us questions. We want to ask you one. Okay. What is a balloon nut? Okay. Is it anything like a blue balloon? No, this is a part of a body. Part of a body. What is the balloon nut? The balloon nut. Oh, I thought you were saying nut. No, that's a problem. We'll have that taken care of. The balloon nut. Yes. Very tough question. We refer to it a lot here on the Opie and Anthony show. Would that be a very well-hung? No. Okay. No. You're thinking of the balloon itself. Maybe you're thinking of one of the long ones that the kid party guy makes the animals out of. That's what I'm thinking. We're just thinking about the balloon nut itself. I love when they finally catch on. Here it comes. Look at her. She'll know any second now. You ever look at a balloon nut? Yes. Have you ever opened up the end of a balloon after it's tied in a knot and look at it? Do you see that? It looks just like a balloon nut. Come on. You blow up a balloon, you tie it in a knot, it's like a balloon. Right. And then you look at the end you just blew into when it's now tied in a knot and it looks just like a balloon. It looks familiar. Right. This is the last time you're standing over a mirror. Well, I have a virgin one. Well, good for you. So do I. So do I. I'm proud to say. We're in the same club in this room. Did you ever have to fend anyone off? Yes, but you know what? I did do something kind of wild with it. Can I say this on the... Wait a minute. I've got to write it. Oh my goodness. Okay, I can't even believe I'm going to say this on here. Wait a minute. Are we going to all of a sudden have a new opinion of yours? She needs a pen. Oh, you know, I made Playboy this month. Really? Can you give me a pen? Yeah. I don't have one. They don't give me a sharp object. I'll just play the turn off the mic game again. Okay. Test it off on it. Okay. Oh, you can say that. You can say that. You can say butt plug. Oh, you can. Yeah. You ever hear of butt plug prank? No. Oh my God. You got to get it. It's kind of fun. Okay. You tried that, huh? I did. How big? Like a finger. Small one. Yeah, like a small one. What made you say, hey, I need a... Research. Oh, research. So that's what you're talking about. I can see her in her accountant. Okay, Laura. Butt plugs, how many? Costs? It's a deduction. You could take that. All right, listen. I took like 130 million porno movies off of my account. Look at that. That rocks. And we just have to eat that expense. All right, here's the butt plug prank call, Laura. Okay. Say okay. Yes, butt plugs. Hmm? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, what's up? So, you got a butt plug? Who? Butt plugs. Butt plugs, yes, ma'am. Hardware, how can I help you? Butt plugs. What is it? Butt plugs. A what plug? Butt plugs. A budblox? Butt plugs. I'm not following what you're saying. Butt plugs. I have a bad connection. I don't understand. What is it? Butt plugs. A budblox? Is it like a receptacle you're talking about? Butt plugs, yeah. What kind of plug is it? A spark plug you're talking about? Butt plugs. Butt plugs. Oh, hold on. Hello? What are you looking for? Butt plug. Spark plug. What kind? Butt plug.

Have you ever been curious about it? I had never... I had to do research. Butt plugs? Yeah. No. Okay. There's no... Okay, off camera, I'll give you a little pantomime of the seduction, okay? All right. Oh, geez, Laura. Butt plug. No, you know what it is? No, that's called Three Way Girl. Picture trying to drive your vehicle, right? Jump over the center divider by the Midtown Tunnel and take the outbound tube into Manhattan. That would be easier than me using a butt plug. You'd have more success doing that. You'd have more success doing that. You'd have more success doing that. You'd have more success doing that. You'd have more success doing that. You'd have more success doing that. You'd have more success doing that. And it's like, you know, the best way to do it. You'd have more success doing that. I was told to stay away from the forbidden zone for it was still infected with radiation from the great explosions. But I went. I went to the forbidden zone and saw the Horus. I should have listened to Cornelius and Zira. But no! Damn me! I saw the red monkey ass in the forbidden zone. We all love the forbidden zone as men. Nothing beats, like, when I had Nova on my horse. Nova. Yes. And my horse. I visited my horse's forbidden zone. My horse. That's why I wore the loincloth. My horse identified the sound of my fly going down and ran off. So I had to wear the loincloth. I looked sexy in that, didn't I? The prop department for the planet of the Aids let me keep the loincloth. Now I wear it on my head. I have my loincloth wig on my head. Damn me! Yes, we're all drawn to the forbidden zone, Laura. How's your forbidden zone? Tight. Tight, yes. It was very hard to get to, even on horseback. Dr. Zeyas told me to stay away. I couldn't stay away. Damn me then! Damn me to hell! Alright, Chuck. Wow, Charlton Heston, everyone. I guess when you're talking about the forbidden zone, Charlton Heston has to come in and make an appearance. He never knows when to shut up. You're like Sybil. He burns it out. What? Who? What? Hello, New Yorkers. You've been hearing a lot lately about Olpe and Anthony. They're setting new standards in New York radio. Olpe and Anthony, they're mature. They're educational. Johnny's starting to grow hair in places he didn't have it before. And they reinforce family values. Son, you coming down? No, I'm not. Not if you're going to start talking about mom's boobs. Olpe and Anthony, heard afternoons on this fine station. N-E-W. Olpe and Anthony and Laura Cornupier are looking to order one of her books. It's 1-800-611-B-O-N-K. I think John from Jersey has the answer to the question. Why don't you give the question? Okay. There's a seduction. Are you laughing? Is it on the studio? Yes. I think he's got it. Okay. Here's the question. There's a page in the new book, 52 Invitations to Great Sex, it's called Invitation to Sin. It's a for his eyes only page. He sends her this invitation in the mail. The invitation asks her to bring a kitchen chair into the bedroom. She comes into the bedroom with a kitchen chair. She sits in the kitchen chair. You're doing something. And you light a candle. The candle's lit. You blow out the candle. Then you relight the candle at that very moment. She sees you do something that's going to blow her away. What is it? Go ahead. Did you read that? No, I haven't read it yet. He says the only thing he could think of is to blow a big, rip-ass fart by the flame because of fireball. Right at her. That'll wake her up. Alright, honey. Here it comes. That'll blow her away. Thanks, John. You got me crying over here. I'm laughing so hard. Hi, N.A.W. Hey. Hey, what's up, bud? You were saying something about it buzzing. Is it like a pocket rocket involved in it? A pocket rocket? Yeah. What are you doing with it? Oh, gosh. I can't even. What about on the guy? Yeah. Okay, you've got something. You've got yourself in one hand. Mr. Friendly. Yeah. Then you've got something in the other hand. Oh, no. We're not going back to the forbidden zone, are we? No, we're not. No, we're not going to the forbidden zone. We're not going to the forbidden zone. No. Return to the planet of the age. Alright. Okay, so you think you have a pocket rocket, which is a vibrator, in your other hand. Yeah. And you're doing yourself. No, her. How can she sit in the chair? You can't even touch her. Yeah. She's sitting in a chair far from the bed. You're on the bed. Hmm. Wake it up. Something else is in your other hand. Well, is the pocket rocket in? No, no. Oh, so it has nothing to do with a vibrator. No, no, no, it doesn't. Alright, do you have a pocket rocket? Alright, dude, we've got to move on, alright? Alright. Sorry about that. Okay, bye. Bob, I believe. What's up? Yes. Hey, Bob. How are you doing? Alright. How are you doing? Alright. Well, the first thing I want to say is I don't think a woman looks the most beautiful after you make love. I think it's just before the point of impact, if you know what I mean. They all look like Cindy Crawford for about two seconds. You know what? I think... And then look like Broom Hilda just right after you're done. Did I drink that much beer? No, you didn't. You didn't. You didn't. You didn't. You didn't. You didn't. Did I drink that much beer? Damn. Well, you know, I got up and put a little lipstick on and everything, but I think there's an afterglow. I mean, I really do. Okay. I was kind of, you know, going through this other gentleman thing. You had the pocket rocket in your other hand. You were just about to insert it. No, no. Careful. Okay. I said insert it. Okay. I didn't see very much. I gave you that or surprised her with a package as the candle goes back on. Something in your other hand. Well, you got something in your other hand. The obvious thing is a lighter. It had a light to it. Okay. You light the candle and the other thing is still in your other hand. Yeah. And you present her with a present. Yeah. That's finishing with the other hand. How can you say that on the air without getting thrown off the air? You really can't, you know. You finish the act, let's say, as the candle comes on. Oh, and you have the results. Yeah. And your other hand. The results are in. The results are in her lap or the other. As I read these out, are we off? No, you're totally off. Okay. I'll give you a hint. Okay. This will give her incredible confidence. Ah. Now, you've got to know what this is now. Now, this is just the beginning of the seduction. Ah. It will give her incredible confidence. I mean, it's, yeah. Ah. Do you have a bottle of stacker two in the other hand? A roll of 50s in the other hand. Your American Express card. Yeah. All right. That's not it. But have a good one. Thanks, Bob. Thanks for calling. All right. Bob's funny. Hey, Joe. Yeah. How are you doing, guys? All right. Lasting my butt off today, man. You guys are great. How are you? The best. Oh, thanks. Okay. I think I'd have the candle in the other hand. No, the candle's, you know, just sitting there. You relit the candle. It's on the ninth stand. See, I thought you were going for the wax. Oh. Yeah. Okay. This will give her incredible confidence. Confidence. Confidence. I mean, it's just a- You went for the confidence. I'm thinking now handcuffs, but- I mean, this is the kind of thing that will invade her dreams. I mean, this is very erotic. Oh, man. I know, man. I did the hot wax thing and that kind of went, you know? Ah, man. Well, do you have an answer? It kind of went like what? Was it good? Kind of great. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, you can drip hot wax in like certain areas of the body and really, ooh, send shipments to places- I have Stomach Farnall knocking off. I have Stomach Farnall knocking off. Uh-oh. He's getting mad now. I think we need a lady to answer this question at this point. Oh, man. Okay. I'm going to say handcuffs then. Hey, you know what? I'll send you a copy of my book anyway. Cool. All right. Hold on the line, buddy. Tremendous confidence. Tremendous confidence. I got it. Okay, you got it? Look at this. Blue. Yeah. You got the answer. I thought I did. I was going with the waxing myself. Wait, Anthony's got it. Anthony's got the answer? What do you think? Come on. What do you think? You don't want to give it away now? No, I won't. I won't give it away. I'll wait. Okay. Okay, I'll give it away. Her best friend's head. No. It's easy, of course. What's the answer? You got it. You don't know? Hard. Hard. Hard. Hard. Hard. Hard. Hard. That shield smoking air. Titiiy Tiiy Tiiy Tiiy Quiet Tart Su unsure mi su insulted off fi Yeah, you were a dirty girl, weren't you? Alright, and here you are with Dad. Yeah, this one really gets me hot. Alright, hon, here's where you took that class trip to the Museum of Natural History with your teacher. Yeah, look at me go. This one makes me hot, Toots. Here you are. Look at you, the way you lay in that stroller taunting me. You're taunting me. You're a tease in that pamper. But it's you, honey. Why are you packing your bags and running? I can't breathe. A picture of her. What's really funny is in this induction I say you have all her pictures all over the mattress. Yeah. And you in church making communion. But it's you, honey. Yeah. Look at you, seven years old with your new Barbie doll. Yeah. Wow. I'm ready to pop now. Holy cow. Look at you in your communion dress. Oh, God. I say it. That's pictures of her. That's top shelf stuff right there. Makes sense though. I understand it would give her confidence that you're getting so aroused. But that's not all to the seduction, but that is just the start. So if people are tuning in, she's in the chair. You're on the bed. There's a candle. You're waxing the carrot at this point. Okay. You turn off the, you blow out the candle. You wait how long? A couple minutes? Yeah. You light the candle again and you're still waxing the carrot and you're holding her picture. Right. Imagine if you lose it during that time. It's like, yeah, no, look what I'm doing. You son of a bitch. It would just ruin your marriage right there. Damn Laura Corne, man. Take the picture. I lost it right in the middle of the stride. Oh, someone doesn't think the answer makes sense. Hey guys. Hi Michelle. Hi. That doesn't make any sense because it's in the dark. How can you see the picture? No, no, no. Okay. Okay. Well, the seduction is he can't. When she comes into the room, you know, he's already aroused. Okay. But she's not looking at the picture. Yeah. Well, there's pictures on the bedspread. Okay. She sees it, but she doesn't really know what it is. So he relights the candle and then he is stroking himself. She sees that. Okay. He's got her picture in his left hand or right hand. Right. And there's pictures all around on the bed and he strokes himself while he looks at the pictures and then why he looks at her. Whoa, he's getting pissed over there. And while he's doing this, he continues to look at you in the chair and then the picture. But how would that make you feel? Be honest. Incredible. Okay. So people are saying, how the hell could he see the picture when the candles out? He can't. He's just, he gets, he's getting himself aroused. The lights are out. She knows. All right. It's in the darkness. If you were sitting in a chair, right? Yeah. Right. And you heard him playing with himself. Oh my God. You guys are in so much trouble. Yeah. Even the listeners know at this point. I think we, uh. Okay. I think we understand what the guy's doing at this point for the 80th time. It was giving incredible confidence and, and, uh, God, it would make anybody feel incredible. It's the same. I know. All right. I know it sounds kind of hokey a little bit. A little bit. I know my wife would probably go, Hey, idiot, I'm over here. I'm sitting over here. Hello. Oh, B and Anthony. One Oh two seven. W N E W. We leave you now with the sounds of Montana and me making my face look like a glazed donut before I get back to my wife. The sounds of the elusive bearded clan. Me trying to shuck the hell out of that bearded clan. I usually don't say things like that, but I'll leave you this Sunday morning with the sounds of me giving her the old pile dryer. So now pictures and sounds of me and the pile dryer on my mistress in Montana on the road, the road I prefer pictures now of the Hershey highway. Visited that in Montana. Lots the Hershey highway. My wife often thought I was fishing on my trips to Montana. And it's true. I was. Here's the sound of the trouser trout coming out of my trousers as I pound some ass. Now the sounds of me pounding ass with my Montana crotch rat. We leave you now. The sounds of me and my mistress and me shooting a tray up in that piece. And now finally the sounds of my mistress hobbling my knob. We don't often leave you with the sounds of knob hobbing. I figure this is a good time to leave. And now the sounds of me and my knob being hobbed. Charles Carrols on the road. Hob, knob. Now the sounds of a purple helmet warrior going into battle again against a dreaded bearded clan. Montana crotch rat. Yes, the Montana crotch rat. God I wish she shaved. Little personal hygiene in the groin area. So it wouldn't look so much like a possum. A woman looks like road kill. It's like the last time I saw a woodchuck caught in a combine. Oh, red and brown and whatnot. Now the sounds of a woodchuck being caught in a combine. Leave you. I mentioned she looks like she had Einstein's head in a leg lock. She trimmed that. First time I made love to her. Pulled those panties down and looked like Fidel Castro eating a London broil. I used to have a lot of sex in my car. Yes, gave her Spanish fly once. I found her on the gear shift. Now the sounds of my girlfriend on the gear shift. We leave you. Yes, I just wish she was a little better with the hygiene. It sort of looked like when you take two big pieces of silly putty, slap them together and throw them on the floor of a barber shop. All pink and hairy. This is Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whores Shop. By seven o'clock I think you're going to say, you know what, I had a pretty good time today. 1027 WNEW. After the sports guys and before Opie and Anthony, Leslie Gold is the radio chick. Why would fast food frequenters like the show? You know, is there a correlation there? Maybe because this is sort of like fast food radio that we do here. It's cheap. It's fast. And it doesn't stay with you. Wow, it's just like the women I like. How you doing? This is Andrew Dice Clay. I got a lot of personal. Try that one Anthony. You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma. Pharma. Pharma. I'm over here now. Grim Reaper checking in Anthony from hell. Yeah.

Five broken ribs, collapsed lung, broken collarbone and a shoulder separation is going to be out for a little while. Yeah. Shoulder separation, baby. Oh, well, I fall on glass. You're going to the same sound effect that that Anthony was using for the Chuck Knobloch Wild Throw. Well, for some reason, I don't have someone falling down on this machine. No. Oh, destiny. Yeah. Good thing I didn't fall on my face. What I heard the ground. Shut up, Bernard. Jerk. Oh, blah. Four twenty. I'm in the morning program. Actually, it was a Chuck Knobloch Wild Throw that knocked me off my horse. Wouldn't you just like, I don't know, a lot of joking has been made about how old he is, but how old is he? I don't know. Does anyone have the slightest idea even close? If I had to guess, I'd say seventy eight. Yeah, yeah. Give or take. Well, a month. I don't know how old he is, but to be hopping on a horse that can throw you ten feet, he wants to be a cowboy, Anthony. Destiny. I want to be a cowboy, baby. Yeah.

We weren't allowed to talk about other people. Yeah, that was good for like a week. Now, Mr. Imus can take a joke. Yeah. Mr. Imus can take a joke. I'm a good character. No, Imus can take a joke. Some people in this company have no sense of humor and can't take a joke. The Imus can take a joke even with a collapsed lung. Even for the simple listener folk like me, I understand. All right. Mr. Imus can take a joke. Yeah. All right, Kevin. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Opie and Anthony. 1027. WNEW. 212757. 1027 is our phone number. It's the Opie and Anthony shoot. Yeah. Want to say hi to everyone going to Chase Stadium? Give it up for the Opie and Anthony. Want to say hi to everyone going to Chase Stadium? Give them hell, boys. Give them hell. Have fun. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Walt Disney World. Welcome to the Boardwalk Resort Hotel here on the sprawling Disney Complex. Seems there's a hostage situation at Disney World, Opie. Yeah, I see that. Gunmen holding what? A Disney employee hostage and went to the hotel? Here in the happiest place on earth. How are they going to spin that? You know how Disney hates like negative publicity? Remember that poor guy that got clocked in the head with a cleat off of that big ship in Disney? The poor guy saves like for years to go on a vacation. What ride was that again? Do you remember? It wasn't even a ride. You know that big boat, the Columbia, that circles the river on track or something? Can't you even float a real boat? It circles this little river and they were pulling into port. And this poor guy, you know, working slave and saves his money so they could go to Disney on a vacation. Him and his family has been waiting on line to get on the stupid boat ride. Maybe one of the workers stayed out a little too late that night. The night before throws the rope over the little thing to stop the boat. The cleat, they're going a little too fast. The cleat pops off the boat. Now the rope and cleat fling like a bullwhip and crack this guy right in the skull. Drop them right there. Dead. Kill them dead. He's dead. So what happens? Disney gets in trouble because they tampered with the scene. They haul the guy away, hose the blood down. Business as usual. Get Mickey out there, wave into the kids again. Okay, it's only another human being. Is that really what happened? That's what they did. They got in trouble because, you know, they should have investigated the scene. Ha ha ha, yeah. Ha ha ha, yeah. Here comes the boat, kids. This is going to be great. Ha ha ha. Remember that in Disneyland there was a ride called the American Revolution, it was called, back in the 70s. It was a celebration of America and, you know, you get a bunch of cute little kids singing songs and stuff. And it was on this, it was a rotating arena. Big, huge round thing and it spun, spun around. A worker was in the works when it spun around and got caught and crushed in the gears of this thing. You know what they did? Business as usual. Hauling away. It's Disney, it doesn't matter. Great. Yeah. There have been a few cool deaths at Disney Space Mountain. Isn't there a website dedicated to all that crap? Oh yeah. Somewhere. Yeah, there's Disney deaths. At Space Mountain somebody stood up. Why would you ever stand up? There was another one, the People Mover at Disney. You get in there and it goes like one mile an hour. You have to be a complete idiot to get hurt on this ride. It just kind of takes you on a little tour. You ride around and it's like, We are now inside Space Mountain. Please no flash photography as we go at one half a mile an hour. Now as you look upon the sprawling Tomorrowland, we will take you to Frontierland. And like this thing is doing one mile an hour, somebody, it was going so slow, they get out of one of the cars and they're going to run on the track up to the next car where their friends are in there. Trips gets run over by the car that he got out of, crushed, killed. You know what Disney did? Get out the hose. Sprayed it down. Business as usual. Business as usual. Sorry for the slight delay. It seemed to have a crust human being on the track. But that's okay as we enter Adventureland. Put on your safari hats. Hey Kevin, what's going on? Yeah, my brother, he used to, he worked down there a few years ago. Space Mountain was famous for giving people hot attacks. Oh yeah? Yeah, they used to, and Disney would pay like this hush money. You never hear about it. Yeah, they pay people off for something. One time on the safari guy, he used to, they make believe, oh there's a hippo. You know, take a shot. Oh, that's always funny. Oh yeah, he brings his kids here. You see a giant elephant on the side. Look out, whoa, here comes the water. Whoa, whoa, look at that. You can't tell it's mechanical with that trunk on a hinge. Boy, that's realistically. Oh, here comes a crocodile. Whoa, let me shoot him. Okay, I got him. And then we make our way back to shore. Make sure you stop off at the souvenir stand and buy some of this crap for like 80 bucks. Hey Dave, what's up? How you doing? How you doing? Pretty good. I got another story about someone who died at Disney. Okay. What happened was this little girl was riding Small World with her family, right? And you know how people would throw pennies and stuff into the water? Oh yeah. So like she reached out to her parents and she said, hey, I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. I want to go to Disney. No, no, that's true. What do they do? I mean, the lowest wheel them away in an ambulance. And then they're pronounced dead like En Route or Dead on Arrival or something like that. No one is pronounced dead here at Disney. They probably have like, you know, Goofy and Pluto come out with a goofy stretcher and like grab the guy's wife instead of the guy that's laying there and then hit each other because it's fake, you know. Oh no, wait, it's the guy. Oh, they run off. Blackie. It's the wildest ride in the side of the Payco. Make sure you keep your hands and feet inside the ambulance at all times. Patrick. Yeah. What up? Yeah, I used to work at Disney too. And that's true. They gave a guy who got struck by lightning mouth to mouth resuscitation. He was better than snot. I mean, the paramedics were giving him mouth to mouth resuscitation all the way out of the park because they refused to pronounce him dead. Oh, really? Yeah. That's something. All right, Patrick. Like you said, spray it down. Keep moving. Keep the rides going. Yeah. We're trying to find that website. There it is. I was there three weeks ago. Matterhorn bobsled. The first ride to kill somebody. Let's see, from 1955 to 63, Disney safety record was flawless. Not all their guests may have left happy, but they did leave alive. This record ended May 64. The killer attraction, the Matterhorn bobsled. A party for 10,000 Long Beach Elks and their guests. Tragic first victim, 15-year-old Mark Maples of Long Beach. Let's see. He argued with a girl over going steady. Blah, blah, blah. His friends had her strain him from flinging himself to the ground 50 feet below. But there's no way to stay depressed at Disney. He was having an argument with his girlfriend, I guess. He got on the bobsled. He felt a sudden, inexplicable need to stand up. Wanting to stretch his legs or confuse, the simulated bobsled was much more traditional, like a surfing or skiing thing. His friend just heard some thump noise. And Mark was gone. No screams, no triumph and shouts of cowabunga. He catapulted from the speeding car, landed on the track a few feet down. Skull fracture, various injuries, never regained consciousness. You know what they did? They sprayed it down. They put it down and let it ride. Move on. Danny, what's going on? Hey, how are you guys doing? Doing well. I got a little story for you. I was down at Disney World with two of my friends about a year and a half ago, two years ago. And we ended up catching two of the characters having sex together. It was unbelievable. And then when we did, we reported it. And they offered to give us a free vacation coming back. They said that they'd give us free tickets to the park. And my friend, my friend's aunt or son, he's like three years old. And we're like, the kid's never going to forget this. Mickey Mouse is banging Snow White. How are you going to do it? They ended up giving us all free passes to the park, a lifetime for his family, lifetime free passes to the park. Another guy tried to get into the park. Poor guy, Cleveland, 19-year-old guy. He tried to get into the park by climbing the fence, climbing up one of the poles that hold up the monorail, and walking on the monorail track into the park. Come on. The newspapers could only describe his body as badly mangled. It dragged him 30 or 40 feet before it could stop. Spray it down and let the rides roll. Grant, what's going on? How's it going? We're doing well. Yeah, I used to do my work at Disney World two years ago at the Bear Floridian. Okay. And they made you take these Disney University classes. Yeah. They have like a university on the Disney World ground. And it actually told you something happened while like, going on a ride to get rid of it as fast as possible. Get rid of it, yeah. Get rid of it as fast as possible. And I worked there, I've seen some crazy s***. Oh, whoa. Sorry about that, guys. Whoa. Cursing. Watch out. Yeah, while they still have at least a slight pulse, they just want to drag them off of the Disney property. Dave, what's going on? Hey, what's up, guys? I want to tell you, a couple of years ago, me and my buddies were down at Disney World, and one of them got busted for shoplifting. And when he got out, he said that the jail cell has like a big plastic Mickey Mouse with a frown on its face just holding onto the bars. Come on. So they got their own little jail? Yeah, they got like Disney jail. And then they hold you there until the Orlando police come. That's funny. How about Dolly Young of Fremont? Riding on again the Matterhorn bobsled? Her safety belt unbuckled. She fell to the track, bounced along while struggling to regain to her feet. A second speeding sled smashed into her. The bullet sled dragged her for a car length before stopping with her corpse pinned beneath its wheels. She was pronounced dead a short time later. Probably after they got her off the track. She's still alive. Look, her fingers twitching. Get the host. This guy says he has some twisted stories about Disney. Mark. What's up, guys? How are you? Former cast member. Cast member, okay. They're not employees. They're all cast members. No, they're employees of cast members. And I was a Monorail pilot for two years. Pilot? Yeah. Like you're going, you know, I'm going to turn left today. Yeah. You know, I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot. I'm going left. All furtionous. I mean, there's so many dark secrets about Disney. I wish somebody would just write a decent book about it. There's like one book out there called Mousetales. Give us a couple, man. You're a pilot. Well, in front of mine, like I... Tom Cruise over here. I lived in a condo complex where in front of mine there were characters above me. One played Goofy. The girlfriend was Minnie, whatever. But to make one story short, he witnessed an accident that took place between a company vehicle and a civilian. And the accident resulted in the death of a civilian and the local sheriff and also the Disney cops, believe it or not. And they told him if he saw anything or if he said anything that he would lose his job and this and that and they threatened him with a bunch of things. Wow. That's the way it is. You've got to figure they bring in so much revenue for the state that they do want to protect it, even the police department and everybody else. They don't want to stand on it. I mean, it's like, for example, like the Atlanta, you know, when the bombings in Atlanta went out during the Olympics, I was testing for my monorail pilot license. Are you kidding? Isn't it just go and stop? It's a whole test you have to go through. It's not just pushy. Please stand clear of the doors. Is that it? Please stand clear of the monorail doors. No, no, actually. As Pizzo and DelClero... It's please stand clear of the doors, both of which are open. Seriously, some guy walked on our monorail while this girl was testing and getting her check out. I want to take this to Cuba. No, no, no. He threatened a bomb and as soon as that happened, they were going between the transportation center and Epcot Center. And as soon as they got to the other side, that was where the cops were, FBI and supposedly, I don't know if this was true or not, but CIA. Wow. Yeah. And then, I mean, that's got a million stories. We had a plane crash into us one day. We had a... A plane crash into Disney? A little biplane crashed into, just missed the monorail, smacked the beam while the monorail was passing over. So that knocked us off. Pay no attention to the flaming aircraft. Exactly. It'll pay no attention to the flaming aircraft, though. Underneath Disney at night. They have cock fights. It's amazing. Actually, you know what? And this is interesting. We had a sniper one night. Get out. Really? On the top of the Contemporary Hotel. This was about, this happened supposedly, it was like five years ago. Wow. Like one through the top and he was ready to open fire. Wow. Yeah, there are probably so many deep dark secrets. Yeah, we'll continue this discussion, but we don't want to get fired. Why? We're not owned by them. They got a lot of power. We're not owned by them. All these stories, stories that we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've heard, we've No, this is all absolute facts. No, I don't know. These people worked there. I'm sure. There you go. And I hope everyone knows we have to get a cease and desist first and then, then we have to shut up. All right, why don't we take a break, okay? 212-757-1027. We'll be back in just a bit. More girls, more gooder. Hookers for everyone. You own some of this. No longer will our penises remain blasted and unused. 1027-WNEW. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hello. Hello. Come on. Who put that in there? Maybe you'd want to hear this. What? A little prelude. There you go, Alfie. Yeah. We all remember this. A little Power Ballad. That's done by Skid Row. Sebastian Bach. Why, what, what? Well, maybe you'd want to hear it. I have no idea what you're getting at. You don't want to hear Sebastian Bach? Yeah. You don't want to hear him play you know, it's a good instrument. No, I don't want to hear him play me. I'm sorry, I don't want to hear him play me. I want to hear Sebastian Bach singing as a little warm up. I have no idea what you're talking about. Hey Ed, what are you doing? No, no, let me take away. Why? The WWF's Raw is returning to Madison Square Garden August 7th. And we teamed up with the New York Daily News for your chance to not only win tickets but qualify for the grand prize, Anthony. The grand prize is four ringside seats and lunch at the WWF restaurant in Times Square with Rukishi. I hope that's not tonight. You won't be able to attend. Yeah. So you're psyched? You say you're psyched? Psycho Mark, what's going on? What are you guys laughing at? Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm playing some music for Opie. Some Sebastian Bach. This is Skid Row over there. I'm playing some music for Opie. I'm playing some music for Opie. I'm playing some music for Opie. I'm playing some music for Opie. I'm playing some music for Opie. I'm playing some music for Opie.

And Skid Row, of course. I just thought maybe Opie might want to hear it. She's a little, uh, Jacqueline Hyde. Ah, maybe, maybe that's it. Hey, Opie. Psycho Mark. What? Psycho Mark, what happened? Hello? Hey, Opie, you're involved tonight, huh? What? Opie's got plans this evening. Yeah, there it is. Shut up. Come on. I have no idea what you guys are talking about. This is the moment, my final day. Psycho Mark, what's up? All right, I'm down here at Hooters, so if you want to come down, get down by seven o'clock, they got five dollar calendars and they got the Hooters girls here. They're incredibly incredible. They're incredible? They're insane. 56 and Broadway, get your Wow stickers, right? Yep, they'll be right here and you get your calendars. This calendar's five bucks. So where are you going tonight, Opie? The phone keeps going. I don't know why you keep hanging up on Psycho Mark when he asks you what you're doing tonight. So, what am I doing? Going to catch a little show? What? What? Going to catch a little show tonight? What? What? What? What are you doing? What? Going where? I heard going what? What? I'm going to check on you. It's just a little hard to hear you. What? What are you doing? I'm going to check on you. Yes, Jekyll and Hyde. And of course, you know who's starring in that now as Dr. Jekyll and the evil Mr. Hyde, Opie? Sebastian Bach. You remember Sebastian Skid Row. Let's have a little. Regis Philbin checking in, Anthony, from ABC Studios. Hiya. Ding, ding, ding. Sounds like it's Opie's turn to be in the hot seat. Opie, where are you? We're waiting. Come on, man. Jekyll and Hyde. Are you disappointed that Jack Wagner isn't still Jekyll and Hyde? Hmm? Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't think you'll be hearing this one tonight. Yeah. Oh, shut up. Yeah. You are gay. You are gay. Hey, I'm gay. Hey, I'm gay. Shut up! Shut up! Pussy! Pussy! All right. Come on, man. You're going to make Sandy upset. She's outside the studio. She looks lovely tonight. Going to a little Broadway show. I thought Privilege liked us. Why, what happened? Remember, remember, um, my little birthday show or whatever? Yeah. We saw all that hot gash and stuff. Sure. And then at the end of the festivities, they handed me an envelope with, like, tickets inside. And I'm thinking, wow, could be tickets for a great rock show or something. Something, sure. Tickets for Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll and Hyde, starring Sebastian Bach. Thank you, Privilege. This is the moment. I made the biggest mistake though, because I just brought him home. Yeah. Choked sand. Like, oh, here, look what the girls from Privilege gave me here. And I gave them to her. And I just flat out assumed that, you know, she'd find a girlfriend or someone in her family. Right, right. Find out early this week that, oh no, she's been planning all along to go with me. Oh no. Oh, even I wouldn't go see that man. And that's from Sebastian Bach. Check in. Charlie, what's up? I saw them last night. And? It was awesome. Well, you're a chick. No, my boyfriend took me in as a surprise. Yeah. And he liked it. And he hates musicals and Broadway shows. And he liked it because Sebastian rocked. Oh, yeah? Yep. And there was a ton of Sebastian fans there. Oh, see? They're going there just to see the man. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. Guys with blue hair. Are the girls squeezing into their spandex for their check, come on. I swear to God, I do not want to go. Dude, you're going to see a bunch of eighties metal fans. Oh my God, like you didn't like Skid Row anyway. Oh, come on. Come on. I saw Skid Row back in 87, 88. I dug the show right then. I've fessed up to a lot of bands on this show, but Skid Row is one I really, never really got into. Why? Why? I just wasn't into Skid Row. Skid Row. Well, Sebastian's awesome though, and he has a great voice. You might not like musicals and stuff like that, but you got to give him credit. I mean, he's awesome. Oh, God, you got to give him a lot of credit. He's got a stage looking like a toothpick playing Jekyll and Hyde. What's going to happen when he hits the stage for the first time? Is everyone going to scream? Girls, are you going to hear girls scream? No, no, because a lot of the crowd was like, Deer to Girls was awesome, and Nate thought he was awesome also. Did the girls, did you hear girls go like, woo, when he came out on stage though? No, no, but they were screaming, you know, in the clapping part. Thank you, Charlie. Good luck there. Oh, you need a full report tomorrow on the crowd, the audience. Just take it. Take the hit. Go there, but do a full report. Really be observant to the crowd. Steve, what's up? Steve, Steve. Hopi. Yeah. Hopi. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? I'm really disappointed in you. You're really like a hump. I thought you'd be like going to a strip club tonight. You going to see that? I'm sure you don't queef too loud tonight and disrupt the whole plan. All right. I can't handle that. Queef too loud. You know it's just begun, too. Come on, guys. You understand, right? Right? Like you've never been dragged to something you didn't want to do, right? You've all been there, right? You guys understand, right? Have fun jettuling high. Yeah. You won't be hearing this tonight, but you'll be hearing the inimitable voice of Sebastian Bach. Let's get rough. Yeah. Remember this? Yeah. Hopi was a young boy. Hopi was a young boy.

Loverboy in Phantom of the Opera. All right, I'll get you back in. Fine. What? We'll go one for one here. What did I do? Does Anthony's girlfriend even know who Skid Row is? Ah, that old gag.

Would you have rather seen Jack Wagner? Yes. Just because I know him. Melrose, he was on Melrose, wasn't he? Yeah, yeah. Did you go to General Hospital for a while? No, I didn't want to go to General Hospital. Did you bring in my theater clothes? Yes, I did. What are you wearing? Nice clothes. Are you going to dress like Sebastian? No. Skid row? Can we see your stuff? Black shoes and a nice little button down shirt. Alright. He'll look cute. Shut up. Do I get a hummer on the way home tonight? On the way home? No, but maybe home. I love the zipper. It'll be fun, you know I'll have fun. Yeah, a rockin' time. No, I'm not wearing my acid wash jeans tonight. Who's aunt kidding? He'd go if only his girlfriend's curfew was past 9.30. Very funny. Harry Ambag, bring your red pumpkin wagon. Bag it. Tom from Bay Ridge, bring it on. I'll take it all. Are you sure Marco didn't give you the tickets? Hey! Hey, Aunt, didn't Skid Row write a song about your girlfriend? She's only... That's a winger. That's a winger, yeah. Alright. Have a good time. Don't forget your little opera binoculars in the snuff box. My word. Here is Sebastian Bachman. That's right. Let's go to Opie's Penis on line two. Uh, Opie's Penis. Alright, how you doing? I'm over here now. Opie, you left me in a drawer at home. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm in a drawer at home. It dialed the phone and everything. What's that? It dialed the phone and everything. How are you going to get a Hummer on the way home without me? Can you get yourself in a FedEx box immediately and get to the city? I can try. I don't think I'm going to make it into the show though. Alright. Thank you, Opie's Penis. No problem. Why is my brother calling in? Elmo. I'm going to give you a present to Sebastian Bachman's dressing room. Your credit card didn't go through. You have to give me something else. How are you going to pay for that, Opie? My God.

No. No lighters, huh? No. We can pick some up on the way. There you go. People also wondering if your denim jacket is going to have the skid row logo on the back. Is Opie going to wait by the actor's exit to get Sebastian to sign his playbill? Hey, John, what's going on? John. Shut up. John. Yeah. What up? My mom is going to go see Rent next week and she needs a date. Hey, Bob, what's up? Hey, Opie. You know, it's really funny stuff and I'm enjoying it. But why does she have to go to the gym? Because she's going to be in the gym. I'm enjoying it. Why does she have to dress you, Matt? Can't you dress yourself? People picking up on that one. I don't understand it. Did you lay out your clothes in the morning too? No. He knows how to dress himself. Why didn't you bring clothes for him? Because I don't know. He didn't want to wear his good clothes to work. And get all wrinkled. We can't get wrinkled now, can we? Not for Sebastian. We've got to get out of here. Alright, Anne, I think we've got to take a break. Oh, really? Yes.

First of all, can I have the microphone? First of all, all I need to say is that the Jews with AIDS can take the chinks and the African niggers and shove up their balloon snout. and shove up their balloon snout. Alright, because I'm riding the 7-Tray. Alright, because I'm riding the 7-Tray. Let me tell you something about niggers. First of all, they're lazy. Okay, can you go get me a beer? Thank you. Second of all, the chinks got nothing to do but hang out with faggots with AIDS and they're going to kick that up your chink hole. I'm riding the 7-Tall. Hold on, I got to crap. Let me just throw this over here. What, you've never seen a guy throw his own feces? You want to see how fast I can throw a ball? What a retard. He's going to be right up his head. You know, one of them chairs. I can't stand him. I hope he gets hemorrhoids for like a year straight. The size of that chick's boobs. I'm sticking out of his rectum. Shackass. He does say that he will be riding the 7-Tray. God, don't you just want to kick his brain a poops guy? And the funny thing is, he had announced that, so now we're going to have a ton of security on the 7-Tray with Mr. Rocker. Well now, the Post has all the towns that he'll be going through and what they're composed of. He's a pure retard. He runs in a man's house. He runs to the man. He runs to the man. Yeah, yeah, he does. You know, the feelers go, hey, retard, it's right field. Where you going? Look at this retard run. Blacks with A's and Jews and chinks. Oh my. Dude, you got to do your impression. I'm sorry to put you on the spot of John Rocker throwing a ball. I didn't throw it, it was going, even though it's a visual. He looks like that retard you get when, you know, look at this idiot. It was even worse, it was like, you know, all the retard Atlanta fans going, he's a hero. Here he comes, he's out here. Hey John, can you throw your own feces for us? Can you throw our own feces? We hate niggers and spits and Jews. Oh my, too. Oh, we love you. Niggers with A's, hee-haw, hee-haw. Chinks with Jews, hee-haw, hee-haw. We at Atlanta's love, John Rocker. Played on a string, us up a nigger, and give him some A's. And then shoved him on a 7 string. There you go. I got A's, that's a good one. I love you. Played a game, and this one will hopped up. You can't see if my bro is going to dislocate his shoulder in a minute. I'm hip cupping, I'm laughing so hard. And they give him a standing ovation. Whatever. Now he's going to hop on the 7 train and have to go through Sunnyside, which is a predominantly Asian community. I don't think... Juliani's shirt. Listen, just ignore him. Yeah, ignore him. Just don't even go to his level. Yeah, like no one's going to throw a battery on the field. I bet Juliani's the first one to throw something at him. Oh my God. And then you got Woodside. Woodside, Woodside. Irish. A lot of Irish in Woodside. So I guess he'll be picking up some support in Woodside. Then into Jackson Heights. Hispanic and Indian. There you go, some of those 20 year old girls with four children that he was talking about. Dotheads. Too bad the 7 couldn't stop in Jamaica. Yeah, maybe they ought to change the track. Let it not be Jamaica. Oops, I don't know how we ended up in Jamaica. And then of course, right before Shea, Corona. Black, Italian and Hispanic. Yeah, it's all the fat monkeys with the A's over there. You got the fat monkeys and the Jews and all of them. The African Negroes, they don't even know what they want to call themselves anymore. Lazy bastard. Bad boy, get my ball. Look at his face. He's a retard. He's three chains from drooling. What an idiot. Tell me, what I like to do in my pastime is I like to take a nice sized watermelon and I'll shake it out and I let it get to about nine degrees. I cut a hole in it and I hump it for an hour. Then I run as fast as I can to the mount and I just pray that there's a nice nigger at age so I can throw a ball straight out his rectum. I hate the chinks. They're the worst. Oh, we love you, John. They should be proud in Atlanta. They wonder why they've been there nine years in a row and they lose every year. Yeah, they blow. They blow hard. Chipper, I'm Chipper. Yeah, Larry, get up to bat, knucklehead chipper. A security force of 500 cops on hand for his little train ride. Tax dollars. Thank you, John. We've got to pay for him insulting us. Yeah, why do we have to put the same reason they put the bulletproof vests on the child molesters coming out of the courtrooms? Those things are heavy. Believe me, it was so uncomfortable walking out of there. Bulletproof vests. They've got to protect these people. Yeah, I don't know. If he wants to ride the 7 train, let him. Let him go. It's Battery Day here at Shea Stadium. Battery Day, Duracell sponsoring this. Return of John Rocker to Shea Stadium. Look, there's a happy young fan lofting his Duracell D into the outfield as he runs to the mound. Once again, here's the other side of the issue. Vinny. Oh, no. Vinny the racist. I got to train Yorkshire. Congratulate him and shake his hand because everything he said was true. And you know something, I want to every time in New York City, I got to Oh, no. His phone. You know what happened? You know what? The goddamn negros wrecked his phone line. It's the negros. Of course, they make the trip. Whatever they do, it's freaking negros. Oh, Jesus. My peach eye got crap in. I bet you nigger made it. That's what happened. Vinny the racist has his own special point of view. And obviously, he wasn't able to come across with it. But I'm sure it would have involved calling people bad things. Thank God his phone dropped out. Is Rocker actually from Boston? Is he? No, he's from what I'm hearing. He says he's from Merck in Georgia. He says he's from Georgia. He's from Georgia? Yeah. I was going to say it would make more sense if he was from Boston. Yeah, it would. It really would. We went off yesterday about our racist partner. I played up there a couple of months ago. It was great. I was right by the market. Yeah, yeah. Daniel Hall. Three cucumbers for a dollar. One dollar for your negros over here. That's $2.50 for the goddamn Dominicans. Come over here. We're here for a dollar, people. Come on this side, I'll stomp a mud hole in your rectum, you darn negros. Yeah, they're rough, man. They don't play. No, they don't play at all. You get more value for your dollar. George from East Meadow. They should have Queer Day at Shea when Rocker runs. Oh, that would be hilarious. Yeah, invite them to the Agay Parade down there. Actually, they should have the whole everyone. It should be Hispanic, African-American, Jewish, AIDS Day, AIDS Day. And every single mother. We should be really nice to them. It would throw them off. It's Dirty Syringe Day at Shea. People loving Dirty Syringes. Throw your pooper day here at Shea in honor of John Rocker. John, we love you. We're just like you. You know what's going to happen? He's going to get on a train with 500 police officers and nobody's going to be around. They might screen a couple of people. You know when politicians go to like the local diner? You think the average Joe is walking in that diner? No. They screen everybody who's going to sit down in there. They're going to screen everyone that goes in the car he's in. And there might be like one opportunity where some intelligent gentleman will walk up and maybe have a little back and forth with John Rocker. You know, John, do you believe these things that you said are in fact true? Ah! And that'll be it. A little sound bite for the news. I don't even, you know what? I don't even care. You know, people say they saw, they saw me at Comedy Center doing him. I was pissed at him before he said all this. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that was reported way before. Before all this came out. He was a retard before that. I was pissed at him before that. And Met fans hate him because of what a retard. I fucking pissed my ass! The Opie and Anthony Show. Oh, to be wild! Boo, boo, boo! Ah! More stupidity on the way! Ararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararar PLE<|fr|> PLElv PLE I'm going to put the times hammer. Nice head, Opie. You are nothing. Thank you. Thank you, Benadryl Boy. Don't you hate guys when they go, hey man, what do you want? You go, I'm on a natural high. Come here, dick. What is a natural high? I'm high on life. Nice head. Nice head. And I was paying for my drugs. Alright. I saw Jim Brewer on Comics Come Home a couple of weeks ago and he was freaking hysterical. Yeah, that was a good one. Can you do some Joe Pesci for us? God, do you get requests for Pesci like in bars and stuff? They come up, I tell you man, they come up drunk. Hey dude, this is the guy man. This is the guy. This is the sheep. Never man. Dude, do it. Tell me you're the sheep. You do it to millions of people man. You can't do a sheep now. Hey, what does Pesci say? Oh, is that messed up? What's it like working with the black dudes? Is he like, he's crazy, right? Yeah man. Yeah, it's all crazy. Yeah, do Pesci, faggot. You're a faggot right? They say you're mad but that's because you're a faggot. Anyone who tells Pesci is a faggot. But the second you say anything to him, all of a sudden you're the a-hole. You're the guy that, I met that guy and he was an a-hole. Dude, you want to step up? You want to step up? Tell you what, dick. Okay? I play softball on Saturdays, Sundays. Dude, I'll wipe you out. I play centerfield, a-hole. Step outside. You want to play Week Show of Manhood? There's always his girlfriend next to him. You know, he's not kidding. He's gonna f*** this thing. Really? He's gonna f*** this thing. You know, we used to like you. You're the a-hole. We had some guy at Sergeant Pepper's a couple of weeks ago. A guy that was licking it while he was trying to sing on stage. Occasionally I like getting together with my brother. This guy was out of his mind. Bill Brady, Joe Curry, an occasional bass player. And we do cover tunes. A couple of local bars on Long Island. It's a lot of fun. Nothing serious, just having a lot of fun. Some listeners came down. 99.99% of them were fine. Great, had a great time. There's always one mother effort. The second we walked in, he's like on me. Hey dude, man. Take a picture with me, man. Which is fine. It starts off real good. Give me your hat. Give me your hat. Dude, I'll change it. I'll change my hat. His hat looked like the hat Quint was wearing. It probably smelled the same. Little Brownie comes out of the cave. He had like three teeth in his head. And now I'm his powerful life. The whole time I'm there, I'm his pal. So we're playing. He gets up right next to me as I'm trying to sing. And tries to lick my ear. I'm like, dude. Get the f away from me. That same guy came up to me. He was just hammered. Watch out for that guy. When he drinks he gets gay. Is there such thing as being gay when you drink? Wait, what are you drinking? Cosmopolitan. The same guy followed me out of the place. He's a huge fan. Just like Ann said, can I have your hat? I'm like, dude, it's my only hat. I love this hat. I wouldn't give it to him. You should get cancer. I hope you get cancer. King of comedy. Talk to my brother. He's in the hospital with cancer. Jerry, please. Jerry, please. I'm really busy. I gotta go. Are you probably going bald? That's your problem. Go ahead. Where are you from? Suffolk? That's insane. At least you don't have to take responsibility. Olive garden food sucks. I'm cooking the crap. You catch the check now. You're responsible. We have a witness to the ear licking. Mike? I was at Sgt. Peppi's last week. That guy looks like swat from the Goonies. He gets up in front of the microphone and he's like, Hey man, do this, do that. He's all messed up in the head. He's all messed up in the head. The second you go, I'm doing a gig here. I'm trying to do something. I really need a couple of minutes over here. What an a-hole, man. The guy wouldn't say boo to me. I tell him what a big fan I am of the show. He told me to F off. That's how the story gets translated. To his drunken pals and stuff. Next on News Channel 4, Anthony goes crazy. He goes postal. He goes postal on a huge fan. Yeah, man. It happens real quick. The story always gets changed. He tried to give me his hat and I said no. I don't want your hat, man. I made the mistake. Right when I walked in, he was like, let me get you a beer, man. I was like, okay, cool. Gave me a beer and that's it. It's just like a chick. What it is, is that when fans, when they're into you, and you're the chick now. He buys you a drink and now I gotta go home and do whatever this guy does once. I gotta spread him. I bought you a drink, man. Help me paint my basement. Do Joe Pesci, balac a goat and paint my basement. I can't just worry Budweiser. Bend over the table, I'm gonna rail ya. What's the problem? You ain't Long Island faggot. You drank my beer though, didn't you? You drank my beer. You're all about, man. I know what I used to do to chicks. I bought you a beer and suck it. Come on, the van's out in the back. Gee, good lord. Tracy Oldo does it. She's just turned 18. What's the big deal? Whatever, dude. I bought her a drink too. It wasn't even a beer. Charlie, I ain't paying for that. Alright, Mr. Brewer, you want me to take the paint back? No, I'll find someone to help me. I used to wear TGI Fridays too. You did that? Get out. Wow. Were you the guy with the little badges on you? I wouldn't, you know, because they... Wow, what a rebel. You would wear the badges. I'm not wearing the badges, man. I wouldn't wear a hat. I wear the suspenders. I wear the suspenders. Screw you, man. I'm my own person. I'm not wearing the flair. Oh, that's funny. Once I felt really degraded there, I felt like I had to get him back. So, this is a true story. I'm leaving and this other guy, he's a big stoner. This guy, Joe. Joe, if you're out there, man, dude, you've got to call and back me up here. He comes out and he was... He comes back and he goes, dude, why can't we all just hang out in life? So, he's one of these dudes. So, we go out and we're leaving for the day. And the ice cream truck was delivering. And he's like, let's take one of the ice cream bins. I'm like, nah, nah, he quick grabbed the bin. And then I grabbed the bin. I shoved it in my car, I drive home. But their ice cream bins are like huge garbage barrels. Full of ice cream. So, now I'm driving home in Valley Stream like 20 minutes later. It's melted and I can't shove it in any of my freezers. I went into my sister's house and she's like, let me get some Tupperware. We had like 40 things of Tupperware ice cream. What a bunch of jackass. You must have been stoned. Yeah, yeah. That's the only time you want to... Really? I was like, I am stealing ice cream. I'm making a statement again. Take that, TGIF. Make me wear buttons back in... What a... What a... I leave my Jesus Priest jacket. And I'm coming back for the Moose's head. Wild, man. That is funny. Yeah, but they make you train for two weeks. For what? You have to learn like, ah, man, it was so annoying. You've got to go into TGIF... And there's always one guy who's been out about seven years. He's going to tell you. Philadelphia, Atlanta, and everyone in sales. Whatever, dick. Tell me about the Sizzle. Tell me about the Sizzle. Can you believe this guy? He's got 98 buttons. He's the 98 button guy. I got this one when I was camping in Alaska. Oh, what a dick. It's like his whole life, man. I started out as a busboy. Nice head. This guy, man. Oh, shit. The red stripes were my idea. So what the hell they're teaching you? You're going to learn the menu. You have to take a test on the menu. A test? Yes, you have to take a test. Watch in the fajita. Quackamole and chicken. And sometimes, ah, man, steak. Very good, Mr. Brewer. Call me Mr. Brewer. I'm 19, man. So I sat there. So my first day... And you have to learn drinks. Like, um, I still don't know to this day. Certain drinks are like, No, you can't call it like that. You have to go, I'll have a high ball to the third power. That means they have to use the blender. Oh, all the colors. Order the drinks in colors. Yes, order the drinks. And you have to get the glasses. Right. I'm in line with these people. It's busy now. There's six people in my whole area. But I'm stressing hard. I'm not going to be able to do that. But I'm stressing hard. Just bring our drinks. We want mozzarella steak. Nothing more stressful than the food service industry. Did you get soup, bro? And all it took was one jacket to go, I'll have a blue nipple. I'll have thin hair. Hold the ice and throw in some bourbon. Dude, screw me. I am honked hard. And they're in line with all these serious people. And they're all like, I'll have a blue high ball to the seventh power. High ball to the seventh power. Okay, next. What do I use? Get me in the line, A-hole. Until you learn how to call the drinks in yourself. Here's a thing to study. And it used to make me do it. Someone take a table in my... You should have learned when you passed the test. Maybe if you didn't... They suck. Needless to say, it lasted two weeks. I stole the ice cream. I'm out of here. You stole the ice cream? That's like high pressure though. The food service industry. Because around lunchtime and dinnertime, it never stops. And you can't just... I like a job where at any given moment, if you're pissed off or something, you can just sit down and take a breath. But what are you going to do? There's people screaming for stuff. It's disgusting. I know you're hungry. I need to chill. You guys are pissing me off. My girlfriend is all annoyed. I can learn these faggot drinks. I don't know, just make it. Jerk, you know what I want? I'm going to call CB3 Power. Everybody is getting the fish. It should be like an airplane. You get two choices. Why would you go to TGI Fridays and order anything but a fajita or burger? I'll have the sea bass, well then you're an ale. What are you doing here? We're in a great seafood place up the road. You're all decked out to get some sea bass. You idiot. There's a nice seafood restaurant you can go to. There's so many people checking in that worked at Fridays. I'm sorry guys. Let's see what they're going to say here. Scott, what's going on? What's up? I used to work at TGI Fridays. What a pain in the ass place to work. You had to take 20 tests to make a burger. Yes. Tests? How many tests? You had to pass the bar test? I had to run around the building in the first two weeks and sing Back to the House. Because they were competing with the servers and the bartenders and the people that were cooking. Totally ridiculous. Happy birthday to you. Did you have to do that? Tell me you failed that test. I definitely had to learn. Happy birthday to you. Oh no. I was just looking around the other room. Look at the breast on that horse. Never mind. I'll get her rolls. Play on the burger. Have some rolls anyways. Who are you around here? Professor Pequod? They're all at the other table. Happy birthday to you. I always disappear. I'm making some ice cream. You're the guy in the back of the crowd. That always looks like the most degrading. Why would you have your employees do that? Does anyone really enjoy that? When they're sitting down? It's never the person's birthday that's having the birthday's idea. It's like, when they go to the bathroom they'll call the waiter over and say it's their birthday. They'll send over the little cupcake and the whole cast of A-holes will come out and say happy birthday to you. The guy sits there going you bunch of motherfuckers. My favorite is the guy from the kitchen with the accent happy birthday to you. I like it. I make it with my feet. That's to me. Especially when you get the guys and girls in there. They just want to do a job. Get their money. Get the hell out of there. I think it's equal to a secretary in an office and the boss going, hey, why don't you hike that skirt up a little bit, honey? I think it's just as degrading. They're there to serve food and do that and they've got to sing goofy songs to people. However, it is hilarious when you're a hammer and you bring like that one guy who knows he'll go to blows if these bananas come over. They're gathering with the blues over there. Cool. May believe you don't see them. Alright, Dick. Oh, man. I did. Happy birthday to you. He's just sitting here like, I'm going to bustle. It's going to kill you. Go away, please. Blow out the candle. There was that one place that they take out the moose. A big moose. That was up in Boston. You had to kiss the moose. What? One of those places. Now kiss the moose. I'm going to stick my stuff in the moose's face and if you don't pull that goddamn thing away from me, I'm going to get a moose job. That's when you're drunk, friend. Remember this old one? Remember when you pull out your little... You pull out your pocket. You want to kiss a bunny? You want to touch the elephant's trunk? Touch the elephant's trunk. You pull your pocket out. You want to see every kid's body? No. Here you go. You pull your... What an idiot. Oh, man. Okay. Hey. Okay. Oh, boy. The show blows, blows, blows, blows. Blows, blows, blows. V.O.V. and Anthony Show. Blows, blows, blows. The show blows, monkey ass. W.N.D.W. Well, Anthony, here he comes through the door. Tom Brokenjoy, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Tom Brokenjoy, NBC Nightly News. I'm Tom Brokenjoy. I'm Tom Brokenjoy. I'm Tom Brokenjoy. The show is Nightly News. Terror at 33,000 feet. That was in the Egypt era. The 767. Plundered into the earth. Tom. What the hell is wrong with you today? You sound extra groggy. Just a little, little woozy today. Why are you so woozy today, Mr. Brokenjoy? I was going through my children's Halloween candy and picking out what I thought was inappropriate. I was going through my children's Halloween candy and picking out what I thought was inappropriate. I think something was laced with very PGP or cyanide. I haven't felt the same thing in a while. I haven't felt the same thing in a while. So you got a buzz from your kids' M&M's or something? A little woozy. No, it was one of those peanut butter Mary Janes. Appropriately enough named Mary Jane. Appropriately enough named Mary Jane. A slang word for a marijuana cigarette. Something I'll be doing in an exclusive expose on in a future episode of Embassy. If I may continue, a jet plows into the sea, 217 dead, Egypt air, flight crashes, out of Nance. Look at that. There's still something really wrong with your voice today. I think it's more than just the PCP from the Mary Jane candy bars that your kid brought home from trick-or-treating. I mean, your mouth's not even moving, to be honest with you. I see your forefathers. I see you're four feet away from me here. Always the perceptive OP. Noticing anything. Yes, OP, I was also going through my child's Halloween candy and found an apple, which can be very dangerous. Pins and razor blades and whatnot. I was doing an exclusive expose on that on the future Embassy Latin. Where I couldn't resist a shiny red delicious apple and took a bite, lodging 20 or 30 pins in the roof of Tom Brokaw's mouth, of which I've only been able to recover three or four. So I'm not only... Well, that's more than the people they have found in the ocean. So... Yes, many eyes lost as jet plows in the sea off of Nantucket Island. Embassy Nightland is Tom Brokaw. I am recording now. I don't believe JFK Jr. was on board. There is some good news. For that matter, no Kennedys were aboard on this one? I don't believe any Kennedys. Although they did leave from John F. Kennedy Airport. So we will be doing an exclusive retrospective look at the life of John F. Kennedy for no apparent reason. We just have the footage from when JFK Jr. will now go to the graphic of young JFK Jr. saluting his father. So, interesting footnote. I'm trying to see if Bernie Gets a Squirrel was involved in this crash. You know, if a squirrel gets sucked into a jet engine it could lose power. And if it does happen to be Bernie Gets a Squirrel, as I reported being missing months ago, it could have spurned me to the death of 200 or... 217 people. Embassy Nightland is Tom Brokaw. Also reporting this jet did not fly for four hours with frozen individuals and professional golfers on board before it crashed. Very observant, but that was the Payne Stewart tragedy that was last week. Also had reports that the Navy ship The Grasp is on its way. Jesus Christ, why don't they just buoy the thing out there for God's sake? How many...oh! Was that the music or did I hear it like that from being heavily sedated? My God, just build some docks out for these ships out there. It's like the New Bermuda Triangle. I swear to God, if I ever take a flight out there, never again. But the Grasp and Grapple and all those ships that pull debris up from the ocean floor will be making their way out. Of course, I believe this is still a search and rescue operation. That gets a laugh out of Tom Brokaw. The plane lost about 25,000 feet in 30 seconds. Oh yeah! They'll be finding survivors. It was an Egypt air flight, but I doubt they were wearing crash towels. I can't possibly see anyone surviving a 450 mile an hour plummet into the water. You know, could you see that guy? Hey, I'm fine. I'm over here. Could you pick me up with that big Navy ship of Grapple? Please. Maybe my drugs are getting me to editorialize a little more than a respected newsman, said to Tom Brokaw. I said, give me a freaking break here. Well, Tom, it's always a pleasure to stop by. Thank you. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. So you're going to be... Terror... Okay. Terror at 33,000 feet, with more details tonight on the later edition of Amik... Will you have anything on the death of Walter Payton tonight as well, Mr. Broken Jaw? I can almost confirm he was not one of the passengers on board of the plane, if that's any case. And boy, just think, if they could have fished some salty livers out of the water, he could still be with us. Okay. Am I being inappropriate? A little bit. I'm sorry. I'm Broken Jaw, ringing the bell on NBC Nightly News. So you went trick or treating with your kids yesterday? Yes, I did. Did Tom Broken Jaw wear a costume? Yes, I went as Mat-Ludl-Lamansson. I just like that guy. He rocks. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. Terror at 33,000 feet. Catch me on the later edition, if I'm not asleep. Okay. Thank you for stopping by today, Tom. Tom? Tom? Tom? As the young Kennedy salutes his father's grand. Achille Loro. Why can't I say it? Achille Loro is just a ship. I should be able to... Tom? Huh? What? Huh? Thank you for stopping by today. Thank you, Opie and Anthony. Tom Broken Jaw. What's my name? Broken Jaw or Brokaw? I change it every time. Well, it should be Broken Jaw, so... Oh, is that how it works? Yes. Clever. Opie and Anthony. 1027, WNEW. Good day, Spaz. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to once again make yourself look like a complete tool. This time, by divulging your story to Opie and Anthony, about your idiotic plan for the perfect crime. Good luck. Well, mission impossible, help me out with this. How would you pull off the perfect crime? What you would do is you would make a perfect circle within the door. How would you make the perfect circle? Easy, you would... In a glass door. You could symmetrize it. Symmetrize it. What about the alarms? You would have to find a way to disenable the alarms. So you can re-enable the alarms when you leave. You're crazy! You walk up to the vault. Yes. Now what? You could get a stethoscope. If you bring it in safe with a combo lock, you'll be able to get in it with a stethoscope. If they did it on TV, I believe I can. I believe anybody can. So you take the money, and then you leave through the circular hole in the front door. Or you could go through the super system. Super system and go through the pipes. The super system! It sounds completely viable. On Pluto. Baby, I got the perfect plan. What's the plan? This is the plan, baby. I'm going to get that disappearing stuff that looks funny in it. In the cartoon. I'm going to pour it on top of myself. And then I'm going to go into the vault. And the cameras can't see me. And then I'm going to go look for the bills without the big X with the void mark on them. And then I'm going to take those bills. And I'm going to put them in my tuxedo. What if they're Mark's bills? But aren't Mark's bills what you would use? No, aren't Mark's bills? Can someone get this guy at the source? At the source, they've been extinct for years. Any idiot knows that. This has been the perfect comment. Even Kavon Moe can't figure this one out. Pardon me, ma'am. Have you seen a big red retard in the area? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! This moron will self-destruct in five minutes. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. This moron will self-destruct in five seconds. Aaaaaaaah! It's about as funny as a sinking school bus. I have a strong stomach. You guys made me bloat sox. The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. My two new favorite horns. You guys are really horrible. What a couple of asswipes. 1027, WNEW. Well, we had this lady call up about 20 minutes ago, Anthony. She said she wants to meet Psycho Mark. We're going to meet Psycho Mark, which is a laugh riot. This is the first time that has ever happened on this radio show. Because of Psycho Mark's behavior with the interns, dancers of privilege, and whatnot, we've had to tape him to a chair. Duck tape to a chair. So he doesn't get his... Easy! Don't say that. They're going to jump out, I think. So he doesn't get his hands all over these poor girls that come in here. She's what? 5'11"? 5'11", 140 pounds, blonde hair. Small breasts, nice body. She's in town for a photo shoot. And I asked if she was a model. She said yes. Rick says that she's got gorgeous long legs. Model type, young? Late 20s. So the only way we would agree that one of our listeners would meet Psycho Mark is if he was tied to a chair. And you guys did a great job. He's duct taped to the chair at this moment. What? Yeah, let's blindfold him and then we'll bring the girl in. We just had her on the phone about 15, 20 minutes ago. Alright, they're putting the blindfold on, Anthony. Psycho Mark. Oh my God, it looks like an execution. Looks like you're going to execute him. Get a picture of that. Boss, I would like some of them taters and some calm bread. We're taking pictures for the unofficial ONA website. FoundryNeedle.com He hit his face on the mic. You alright? You idiot. Make sure you put the sponge and wet it and put it on top of his head. Don't put a dry sponge there. Okay. Alright, the mic is right in front of you, Psycho Mark. If Marco comes out... Be careful, boss. No, they said they've seen the girl. Alright, let's bring the girl in. Let's see, we will speak with... What's her name? Anna. Anna, hello? Wow. How are you? You're tall. Very nice. And you want to meet that clown who's like... Doug Tate to the chair to your right. I look great, don't I? I think he has the sexiest laugh I've ever heard. Really? It's a psychopathic laugh is what it is. Let me see the ass. I have a crush on him. Alright, wait a minute. Wow. Wow, alright. You can say that for Psycho Mark. Yeah. Look at Psycho Mark. This isn't right. Look at you. It's better than you molesting these girls. I would never do that. Why don't you go over to Psycho Mark there? Play with him a little bit. I can't go over there. There she is. Look at him. He's like... Oh great. Watch some junk land on my shoulder. Why don't you take the blindfold off, Mark, and meet one of your fans. She's taking the blindfold off. Hi, how are you? What's wrong? Nothing, I'm sitting in a chair. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. Can I have my hat back, please? I've been listening for years and I do have a crush on you. Really? Yes, and I think you have a really sexy laugh. Psycho Mark, what do you think of Anna? Very nice. Show them the ass. You want to see my butt? Yeah, see some butt. Showing Psycho Mark the ass. Alright. You like that? Yeah. Sit down, Danny. I did a shoot all this week. Shoot? Trying to get a nugget magazine. What? Trying to get the front cover of Nugget. What is Nugget magazine? It's one of those books you find in the Naughty Store. Oh, wow. What do you think, Mark? A little forced lap dance there. You've been naked before. I hustle, not drink. You've been naked before, right? Yes, sir. Show Psycho Mark some stuff. You want to see some stuff, Psycho Mark? Sure, show me the stuff. A little dance. Let her rip. I'm the submissive type, so you tell me what to do and I'll do it. Oh my God. Bark like a dog. This is great. This is great. You've got to do something, man. We'll remove that jacket. I'm chilling here. I think I'm getting E.A.D. What do you think so far, Psycho Mark? Has she got a tattoo on her shoulder? Hot bod. You think she has a hot bod? Yeah. What else? I want to see Psycho Mark work his pin pan. Pin pan! Pin pan! Psycho Mark duct taped to a chair to meet one of his admirers. So far he thinks she's very hot. Like the butt, like the rest of the body. Go ahead, Psycho Mark. I jump up on my chair and grind on my face. Wow. That's a little blunt. That's a little blunt. Okay, but one more thing. What would you like me to grind on your face? Let's start with the chest. With the chest. My chest is all sweaty because it was really hot in the car. So that's just your little warning. Since you're tied up there, you can't get away. Wow! She has mounted Psycho Mark. And she's like rubbing her boobies in Psycho Mark's face. She's grinding the boobs. Give him a little more of that. He kind of enjoyed that one. Alright. And that got his duct tape because he can't grab the ass. She just stuck her naked boobs in Mark's face. Very nice. Try the other cheek. The other cheek? Yeah. Wow! Antiscribe what's going on. Well, she's pulling her shirt down and rubbing bare boob on Psycho Mark's cheek. She has taken her gum out. Psycho Mark is... What? Meaning one of his admirers, he's duct taped to a chair. What else? Okay, what's next? Let's work that nice fine piece of butt. Work the fine piece of butt. What are we going to do with it? Don't rub it on my face. Oh, there you go. Very, very good. She is now sitting on Psycho Mark's package. There's no other way to say it, I guess. Jumping up and down. Psycho Mark can't use his hands because they're duct taped to a chair. Psycho Mark is getting ass-grinded on his junk. I just got to be blunt about it. Oh my God! Thank God he's taped down. Thank God because his hands would be all over it. It looks like another night of privilege. Your hands are so purple. This is like privilege, I swear to God. He's groping. His arms are turning blue because he's trying to grab... Look at him! He's pushing himself in the chair! He's tortured! He's tortured! He's tortured because he can't use his hand. Are you pitching a tent? No, I'm not pitching a tent. Maybe he needs a... I am not pitching a tent in front of all you! I'm not looking... I think he is. Why don't you feel to see if he is? No, I'm not pitching a tent. Feel to see if he is. It's at least a pop tent right now. Oh my God, she was just checking him for a... Don't! Don't take pictures of my junk! She just grabbed this package. Anna, is there anything going on down there? Anna, is there anything going on down there? Can we play What's in Your Pants? Anna, is there anything going on down there? I'll tell you right now, there's nothing going on there. You must be a fag then. I am a fag. She's rubbing her body all over you. Play What's in Her Pants? Play What's in Her Pants? I think that would be great. You want to play? You know how to play, right? Give me my personal rules here. See my hand? I'm going to stick it out. You've got to walk into it. Hold on, hold on. She looks like she's willing to do your rules. Are you kidding? Put the blindfold back on. We'll play a new version of What's in My Pants. She will put the blindfold on. You reach your hand out. You reach under. Oh my God. Oh my God. And then what? Oh, it's just going to be Psycho Mark playing? Yeah, with his hand. And then he has to tell us what it is. Are you cool for that? I'm fine with that. I'm totally fine with that. Psycho Mark is blindfolded. We're playing a live version of What's in My Pants. Psycho Mark is going to put his hand out. Anna is going to put her patch, I guess. I guess we could say that. Put your fingers out or something. Put your hand out, Psycho Mark. There's junk there. I'm going to open the screen. Alright. Alright, you ready? Hold out your hand. Wait a minute. I've got to see this. Alright. His hand is out, Anthony. Anna has... Casually walking. Oh my God. She's giving Psycho Mark's fingers a little... Let's just put it that way.

I mean, I can actually take a joke on like other people on the show. At least I didn't rip the bathroom door off the wall and smash things. You didn't recognize Anna without the makeup and the nice hair and everything. It's our own Mark Parento from Q104. Remember? It's the rear admiral. Alright, we've got to take a break.

Oh, but you know what, it did make the regular paper. I think when we were in Boston, and it is an exclusive interview with Charlton Heston. So, I guess he's turning his alcoholism into cold hard cash through the Inquirer. Holy Moses, Charlton Heston reveals he's checked himself into rehab with drinking problems. My going into rehab was a good idea for me, and perhaps a little overdue, left Heston. Yes, I'm a drunk, drunk. At age 76, the hero of the Ten Commandments and Planet of the Apes is still a dynamo. Yeah, he's working alright. Let's see, he shot an Out of Limits episode. And of course, we all know and love him from the NRA. He's very, very into the guns. Guns and booze! Give me a drink. Where's that Jim Cook? I could use some Sam Adams. Damn you all to hell! Where's my booze? Why have you forsaken me, God? Lord God, bring me my, bring me my scotch! Or I'll, I swear I'll blow up your building! Wait a minute, I didn't say that, don't have me arrested. Damn you all to hell! I'm a drunken bastard! I knew I had a problem with, I was out in a bar one night, getting, getting looked as usual. And a beautiful woman came up to me. Oh, she was gorgeous, blonde hair, blue eyes, just a knockout, nice body. I took her home and I gave her the old charmed and chewed. I gave it to her, I thrust my staff upon me! And when I woke up in the morning, who do you think was laying next to me? Who? Dr. Zayas! It was, Dr. Zayas was laying next to me. I was having sex with a monkey red mangel ass. Oh my God! Dr. Zayas, damn you! He was pretty good though, tight, tight! I love a tight red mangel monkey ass, when I'm loopy. That's when you knew you had a drinking problem, Mr. Hess? That's when I knew him. Yeah, he does those commercials, right? Doesn't he do button-flag commercials? Yes, he does, Anthony. So I'm hanging out in a bar and I see Charlton Heston. You see Charlton Heston? Yeah, and he's like drinking a lot, he's pretty hammered. Quite hammered indeed. So I like, you know, I say, hey, you're Charlton Heston. And he punched me in the face. I punched him in the face. Indeed I did. I was drunk. So I was asking for his autograph. I just wanted an autograph. What to do? What to do? What to do? Get another drink! Over here, quick, damn it! I haven't had one in minutes. Oh my God, he's taking the knife out of the cheese. You think he wants some cheese? Oh, you're a hedge. It's a goner, damn you! Damn you! And yeah, he was pretty effed up. Quite effed up indeed. So I said, Chuck, you okay? You know, because I was concerned. Concerned for a friend. And what did he do? He bent over and puked on my shoes. I puked on his shoes! Yes, I puked on his shoes. Quite the celebrity bauble to take home with you. Charlton, puke! Oh, we'd get trashed back in the old days of Hollywood. I'd get trashed with all of them. And then we'd go out and bang whores. Ah, the old days. And they'd always end up in my bed, red mandrel ass up, taking it in the back door. Much like hyper-terric at Rikers. Butt sex. Yes, I love the butt sex. That's right. Give me another drink. Yeah, yeah, guns and booze. That's what I like. I've been known to hobnob when I get past it. You know why I parted the Red Sea? Not to free my people. There was booze on the other side. Lord God, spread these waters. Get me a bottle of Howling Monkey, old dirty. Quick, I need some ripples. Zira, get me a shot, you furry-ass red mass mandrel bitch. Damn you. Soil and green. It's scotch. Oh, good. So, like, I asked Chuck if he needed a cab. He asked if I needed a cab. No, he said no, I'll drive. Indeed I did. Three people didn't care. Martin Heston, I need a foody. Yes. Come here, my long-haired friend. Can I buy you a sea breeze? Here at Nobu. What? I didn't break the gag order. I'm in cash now, like Mr. Harmon. Damn, I was at the Republican convention. You see, Colin Powers' speech? Ah, yes. What a well-spoken darkie. I'm drunk, I have an excuse. And that piece of ass, Bush's, is that his daughter or granddaughter? She's but 18. Two daughters? Twins. Oh, too ponderous. It's a ponderous. Is that Don on the phone? Where's my goddamn drink? I love it. I cast this staff across the Nile and turn it into schnapps. Goddamn, I'm a lutch. Oh, Mr. Heston in rehab, yes. Ever since the burning bush talked to me, I needed a drink. See, when he come down from that mountain, my hair was white. It was like, goddamn, get me a drink. Let my people go to the bar. It's happy hour. That was the quote. They stopped it after go. Damn you. So now I'm in rehab. I need it. Look at my wife. Goddamn. Look at that face. She's like a cartoon character. You see that? Her lips, though, look. Red lipstick she wears reminds me of Zira's red monkey ass. I treated the same way, too. Oh, boy. Yeah. Heston in rehab, yeah. Wandered the desert for 40 years looking for an open gin mill for happy hour. Let my people drink. All right. There it is. There's your coverage. Breaking news. What else does it say in there? Anything? Well, let's see. Bud Light, I said. Yeah. So I saw him in the, I saw Chuck Heston in the bathroom. Saw him in the bathroom. Yeah, he was, you know, up in the urinal next to me, sharing the urine. No, not sharing one. That would be gay. Gay indeed. And when I glanced over, I noticed you were peeing on my shoes, Mr. Heston. Peeing on your shoes. Quite a treat. A shoe shine with a famous person's urine. Damn, I'm hammered right now. Yeah, he's in rehab now, Alpy. You'll be happy to know. Okay. Alcohol and gay sex in the bathroom. Charlton Heston shoving his mighty staff through a glory hole. But yes, I do reciprocate. I'm hammered. What do I know? The joke's on them because I'm not gay. I'm just drunk. Damn you. Damn you, booze. What you turned me into a homosexual. Where does it say that in this story? That Chuck Heston had gay sex when he was drunk. It doesn't say that. I think you're drunk. Anthony, I do want coffee. All right. Yeah, it says that it was because of his hectic Hollywood schedule and campaigning and representing the NRA that turned him to booze. And now, God willing, Opie, God willing, Chuck Heston will stop drinking. Okay, so he's fine. He's doing okay. Yeah. Thank God. Yeah. Imagine that Chuck Heston in rehab. It's a madhouse. A madhouse. I need a creamy head with Jim Cooke. Look, you can't blow the bottle cap on him. All right. We'll take a break, Anthony. Yeah. All right. I don't know. Go F yourself. Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven. We'll be back in just a bit. Opie and Anthony. It is Opie and Anthony. Hello. How are you guys? Thanks for joining us. Hillary Clinton has announced that she's officially running, Anthony. What a surprise for the Senate seat. Geez, does that mean we don't have to foot the bill anymore for every trip she makes here? What? Oh, so finally she announced him. What does that mean? What does she do now? Well, she had her speech yesterday. I checked that out. She pretty much wants to solve every single problem facing the world. Where all that money come from? The work and slob. I'm getting scared. I'm getting scared. I think she's going to win this damn election. No, I'm sorry. It scares the crap out of me. No, I think there's enough stupid people out there that's going to push her over the top, Anthony. I still think Rudy's. Rudy has a narrow lead at this point. Narrow lead. I don't know. They haven't started the mudsling commercials yet. Really? There'll be some great ones. She couldn't keep tabs on her husband's affairs. Are you going to elect her to take care of yours? Pay for it, my friend. The road to kill her, Anthony. Hey, Dave, what's going on? Hey, Dave, balls suck, okay? Yeah, okay. I cannot think of, I can't think of who I dislike more. Yeah, that's a great way to look at it. Everybody in New York thinks Rudy's like a big bully. I mean, he gets things done, but he's like this big bully, and you don't do it my way. I'll just push you around until I get what I want. Yeah. Okay, so that's Rudy's side of it. Now, you take Hillary, and she doesn't know a damn thing about what she's doing here. Doesn't have a clue. The only reason she's in New York is because New York will let her, without being a true resident, run for Senate, right? Correct. She doesn't get into the Senate. Bill is history, too. How long do you think he'll be around? I hope a while. I want to see him do stuff. I know. We all want to see him. God damn, I want to see him just party his ass off when he gets out of office. Oh, it's going to be interesting after he leaves office. He's great material, but I... Something's going to go horribly wrong with that guy. I mean, everybody in New York has got to lose their mind to vote Hillary in them. Well, I'm starting to worry about this one. And that's an insult to New Yorkers, isn't it? Maybe that'll be the way Bill will get back at Hillary, like for being such a bitch to him and not giving him any and stuff like that. He'll just treat her like crap and ruin her name. You know what I mean? That'll be fun. She'll be trying to be this legitimate politician, and he'll just go out and bang chicks and hang out in the booby bars. That'll be a great episode of Cops. All of a sudden, a cop gets a call. We have a domestic dispute in Tampa, Ohio. And Bill just comes out with his wife beater T-shirt on. Hey, man. Hey, man. All hammered and stuff. What the hell you think? She comes home all hours. You know, drunk and everything. Yeah, I had a girl in the house, but we wasn't doing nothing. I go stained like a wife beater, guinea teal, stained up and everything. Comes out of the house. All right, Mr. President, please go back in the house. Mr. President, back in the house. You can't make me do anything. This is my house. My house. I don't care what that bitch says. F you, man. F you. We need backup here. One more time and you're going in. One more time, Mr. President. Hey, go F yourself. Okay, against the car. Against the car. Yeah. Hey, what are you doing? I didn't do nothing. I didn't do nothing. That would be great, man. That would be hilarious. Very good. He comes in the house. He's just sitting there with his hand down his pants watching TV. What? What? Drinking. And then the cop, he's got a big bruise on her eye. He beat me. And then the cop's asking Clinton if he was drinking tonight. Been drinking. I might have had a few. It's my house. My house. My house. My house. My house. My house. My house. My house. My house. My house. My house. If you use my house, my business, I'm gonna get mad. I'm president. God damn it. Go screw yourself. I'll have your job. What's your bad smell? I would laugh my ass off. The little cop driving back. How do we arrest the president today? You never know what a day's going to bring this job. I was the president. Get back in your car you pig. He tries to stab her with a steak knife. F you man, F you. Did you ever see the cops episode where the guy got his ear cut off by his wife? Yeah. And they had to find the ear? Yeah. That was great. That show rocked. Cops. So I had a chick in the house. She didn't have to get all effing up about it. I don't understand. Mr. President, you know, your wife's very upset. Why don't maybe, you know, you could leave the household tonight. They will take you somewhere. F you, my house. That bitch don't like it. She can leave. I never wanted to move to New York anyway. You go screw yourself. Mr. President, keep mouthing off. We're going to have to take in. Take me in, go f yourself. That bitch, I'll smack her again. Okay, Mr. President, I got the cop. What's going on? The president's running. The president's running. He's on the run down the street. Down the main street. Get the helicopter on him. Get the helicopter on him. You got nothing on me. And they have to tackle him. It's like trying to get over a fence and they set the dogs out there. Or they get away. Get away. Come on. Or my favorite thing on tops, like they lose them for a little while and then like all of a sudden they shine the light up in the tree and there's the president hiding in the tree. But they kick over the kid pool and Clinton's hiding underneath it. What? I didn't do nothing. What? We can all look forward to that. If she does win, that could be cool. The cop out of breath jumping over the neighborhood fences. The president's in custody. I need a car over here. Well, Mr. President ran down the street. I took chase. He tried to make it over the fence, but a few too many troops from McDonald's. The extra weight, I was able to bring him down pretty easy and put the president in custody. F you, man. Hitting his head against the police car window. F you. Trying to kick it out. Stained guinea pig on. You tell that bitch I ain't coming back. He throws something away while he's running away from the cops. Well, he found these bits of crack as he was running. The president's running this testing positive as crack cocaine. Mr. President, you got anything in your pockets? No. I didn't do it. It wasn't mine. I was holding it for Chelsea. It almost makes you want to have her win, doesn't it? I love it. Trying to kick the back window out. Running with cuffs on. Before he gets on his little bike. That's always good at cops too. The president gets on a bike and tries to get away from the cops. He's running. He's running. I wasn't running. But they're so obviously guilty. And then they catch him. They get a confidence like what? The president of the United States. What'd I do? Very nice. She's a fat bitch. Look at that ass. Cops. Brought to you by the cooperation of the men and women of blonde. F you. F you. Hi, man. What are you looking for? I can get some clothes. You want to get some clothes? Yes. You need a turban? We got some beautiful lingerie. Yeah. And a t-shirt. And sweater. You want a sweater? Yes. It's 90 degrees out, ma'am.
