 Hello? I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here. That has no place on this show. I know that. Opie and Anthony, more stupidity on the way. 1027 WNEW. 212757 1027 is our phone line. What a day we're having. Woohoo! Yeah! Yeah, I got a jelly boy. Talk radio at its best. Superfly checking in, Anthony. Oh yeah? Brothers, the IRS. Lovely brothers. Brothers, lovely. Lovely. I love them, brother. Great. Wonderful. Can we play the Superfly ID again, please? Yeah, I want to hear that. What is the next ramble, Blake? Psycho Mark, you were in there with Superfly Jimmy Snooka. You asked him to put an ID for our radio show, and how was it in there? Torturous. Really? F-ing torturous. Ponderous. It was ponderous. Well, it only took a minute and 20. Yeah, it was a minute and 20 worth of joy. I hear this thing was twice as long. You just cut it out. It was probably about four minutes total. I'm just trying to get him to say 1027 and WNEW within a certain amount of time. Impossible. Alright, let's listen to this thing again. Ponderous. Okay, O.P. and Anthony on 102.7. 102. O.P. and Anthony, 102.7. Now, this is a Superfly Jimmy Snooka, and you are listening to O.P. and Anthony. On 102.7. On WNEW. Alright. Alright again, 1027. 102.7. Yeah, we saw 1027. Okay, 1027. On WNEW. 1027. On WNEW. Would you want to say his name instead of first? Yeah, say it again here, this Jimmy Superfly Snooka. One more time, and I'll edit that in. This is Superfly Jimmy Snooka, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony on 102.7. WNEW. Superfly Jimmy Snooka on your radio dial. Radio dial. Okay, brother. Okay, brother. Okay, brother. Wow. Wow. You gotta put that in your machine right next to, okay, terrific. Okay, brother. Okay, brother. Oh my god. I could have gone out for a coffee between the 102.7s. Who knew? What happened? Who knew? Yeah. One moment he's flying off that top turnbuckle, and the next? Scrabble eggs. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing we gotta play really fast here is the Earl Weaver. Oh yeah, I love Earl Weaver. This is great. Earl Weaver was the manager of the Baltimore Orioles back in the 70s there. Yeah, and the 80s. And he was doing some talk show. I guess he had a little bit every week called, I don't know, Earl's Corner or something, and he would do a little show, and they would ask him questions about the team and what he's thinking and stuff. Yeah. What an ordinary old aff. Oh, what an amazing one. They caught him on a bad day, and there's some great audio. Listen to the guy, the straight guy that's doing the sports show. He's not fazed by the whole thing. He just keeps plowing along. But here it is. Earl Weaver, everyone. Check this out. Up now on the Manager's Corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winning manager, the Orioles' Earl Weaver. And now to the Manager's Corner with Earl Weaver. Earl Weaver. Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Marr, who wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed. Team speed, for Christ's sake? You get, for God's sake, a little pleased on a f***ing basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you. You get them big b***hs because it can hit the f***ing ball out the ball bushing. You can't make any goddamn mistake. Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl. Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time. Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake. He was released by the Cincinnati Reds. He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves. We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing after 8 and enjoy watching a baseball game just like any other fan and has the ability to get up there and break one open in the f***ing night. So if this f***ing flicker 9 is on business and let me manage the f***ing team, we'd be a lot better off. Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, but let's get to something else. Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a Tabata player. Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lane's coming from. We'd rather wear her next goddamn tomato plant coming from. She'd get her ass out to f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street, she might get a f***ing stuck in her once in a while. I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom. That's about it for Manager's Corner. Go f*** yourself and the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole baseball f***ing network. Wow, that's awesome. I love that clip. Out of control. I love that clip. And this just in from Haywood. Yeah. Haywood? Yep. Did Superfly go to Iona College? Maybe that's it. We never thought of that. Superfly's Week in Review coming up Friday. Donnie Brosco wants to say hi. Donnie Brosco. Oh, hey, what's the deal? What's the deal, yo? Not much, man. You guys are the best. I just found you guys about four months ago. I went into jail in December and I found you guys in jail one with God. Along with God. You found us and God in jail. You got about a thousand faithful listeners in there, man. You don't even realize. The captive audience, we love that. I just got on a Wednesday to figure out how much you guys rule and suck and all that good stuff and you guys got me through my bid pretty quick. How long were you away? I was in there four months. No biggie, you know? Yeah. I thought I saw old Dirty in there but I wasn't sure. Oh, really? Yeah, I saw him at 72 actually. So how do you find our show and God at the same time? Well, it's key. A lot of people find God in jail and then everyone finds ONA in jail. I mean, I found them in there. I never knew they existed before I was in there. Yeah. You know, it's pretty crazy. All right. But you guys are great, man. Well, thank you, Donnie. Get me down there with some strippers or something. It's kind of a Wednesday. It's a deal. Get me some wrestling. It's all worked up. Get me some wrestling tickets or something, man. Have you gotten laid yet? Honestly, not yet, man. No? I got to deal with my probation and all that stuff. You know, I got to get all that stuff situated first before I start messing around up there. All right, man. All right? Well, thank you, Donnie. Keep in touch. We're doing a real radio show. We'll have you down here. No doubt. All right, man. All right. Bye. Yeah. It's been a mess of a day. Paul, you're next on WNAW. Hey, hi, Ed. Don't be. How you doing? Hey, Paul. What's up? Hey, not much. Yo, check this out. I was in Times Square before. There's a billboard in small letters. I don't know if you want me to give it a name or a dot com company. I don't care. It says Avenue R dot com in small letters and a huge letter that says, wow. Nice. With the finger tip tool underneath it, like the two O's being in a high. So there's a wow billboard in Times Square. Yeah, of course. I wish it was a quote from URL to teach them dogs the lesson. Yeah, that would be good. Hey, what happened to your friendship song contest? My phone's dying. I'll catch you later. All right. Bye. Wow, that's a good setup. We're about to play our latest entry. Oh, really? Yeah. And what is this? This could be the last entry. We haven't gotten many songs lately. Which one is this? Have I heard this? This is brutal, Ed. Oh, yeah? Yeah, so we got to preface the thing again here. We've been doing a most offensive song contest. Looking for the most offensive song out there. We've had some winners, that's for sure. We understand they're offensive. I wanted to end this thing weeks ago. You guys all called me a pussy. Yeah. Said keep the contest going. We understand that it's meant to be offensive and all that. Right? Yeah. What else can we say before we play this damn thing? Well, it's brutal. It's the offensive song contest. So if you're offended, then it's doing its job. Yeah. We're not playing this for the humor value, OP. No. This is a contest. And how are we going to get a winner? Because we're just about done with the contest. I don't think we're getting any more entries. This could be the last entry. I was hoping we'd do the final judging at a live performance. That's been put on hold. Oh, Jesus. Our whole lives have been put on hold. Hold, I know. I don't know. Then we're just going to have to pick something out of a hat. Well, I know. I think through the unofficial website. Yeah, the voting continues. Yeah, they're taking votes at www.foundreamusic.com. Are you ready for the latest entry, Anthony? Mm-hmm. It's called Stuck in an Oven with Juice. Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait. Oh. Already? That's that frigging crazy? Yeah, this one's brutal. I understand it's brutal. Who wrote this? Psycho Mark Ferman. Psycho Mark Ferman. No. Who wrote this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What sucks about these songs, you know, they don't take credit for them. They just send them in in a paper envelope, no name, no return address. Actually, no. We do have a... Oh, you have a name on this one? He calls himself The Maestro. The Maestro. See, no one uses real names, nothing. He calls himself The Maestro. And we do have a ton of stuff we're going to give away to the winner of the most offensive song contest. Plus, we're going to send it up to what? Guinness? Yeah, but no one has, you know, claimed responsibility for any of these songs, Anthony. Yeah, I know. Some of the names that have sent in songs, Q, Fuel, The Maestro. Suitenoms. Ants Brother. Ants Brother. Yeah. All right, man. I'm warning you. If you're easily offended, turn off your radio. I don't want to hear about it. We already understand how offensive this song is. Yeah. That's the purpose of it. All right, and with that, here it is, for whatever it's worth. Check it out. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, my god. Oh man, this is just bad. I told ya. Oh man, is that bad. Okay, terrific. Wow, I told ya. Oh my god. I told ya. Wow. Wow. Oh yeah, I love it with Rick singing along. Oh my god. Jake, what's up? Hello? Hey. Hey. I want to say, you know, you know Passover's in two days? Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. That's the best song, man. That is the best. That's the winner. Yeah, we should have played it Wednesday. That's great. I'm in this day and the rain with the unedited sound of the girl on the chair with her boyfriend the other day. The chair. Oh. You were playing Guess What Whoever's Doing? Oh, Guess What Jane's Doing? Yeah. That's an amazing thing. Can you end the day with that? I don't think so. No, we got a little trouble with that one. Oh, that was a great one. All right. Thank you, Jake. Thanks, guys. Bye. Eric is Jewish. Eric, what's going on? Hey, what's up, Bonek? How are ya? All right. The name of that song, I was expecting a lot worse. I thought that was a disappointment. I'm Jewish and I wasn't even offended a little bit. Oh, yeah? Oh, very good. I don't know. I think that's a pitiful loser right there. All right. Well, thank you, Eric. All right. Thanks, Bonek. You guys are awesome. All right, man. Let's go to Andrew. Andrew, you're next on WNEW. Andrew? Yeah. What's up? Andrew? Yeah? You're on the show. Let's go. That was too funny. Oh, you liked the song. Oh, you liked it. I'm a Jewish guy. That was just too funny, man. Hey, look at that. All right, Andrew. Thank you. All right. Thanks. The singing was very offensive, right, Ed? Yeah. Well, his harmonies were kind of there. You know, you gotta give him that. Drunk Ed? Hello? I like to say that's a very good song. Hello? Can we end the show like right now? Wouldn't that be nice? Can we like just go home? Is there something we can play? Wouldn't that rule? Let's just write off this show and start the week tomorrow. It happens sometimes. What a mess. Cluster F it's called. I'll tell you one thing. As much as you guys hate and complain about Spaz, he is the reason why the phone calls suck today. Yeah, he screens him and he's not here today. Spaz took the day off. I'm telling you guys you hate him, but the guy does a great job when it comes to screening the calls for our radio show. It's like a monkey. You're training him to do one thing. Nothing against Stinky who's doing it today and filling in and doing the best he can, but Spaz has been doing it a long time. He understands the show, believe it or not. And he usually gets rid of all these people. Why would you put a guy through that's doing a horrible Asian impression? Spaz wouldn't do that. Spaz is dumb, but you can't trick him that way. I don't know. But I'm telling you, as much as you guys abuse Spaz, he really helps the show when he's screening the damn phone calls. He does the job great. All right, tell Stinky to clear the lines. We're going to give out some tickets here. We got some tickets to see the Warped Tour 2000 featuring Green Day, the Mighty Mighty Boss Tones, and the Long Beach Stub All-Stars at Randall's Island. Saturday, July 15th. Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster, but we have a pair for you if you're the 10th caller. At 212-757-1027, there's only one other thing to do today, and that is play What Do We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today. Stay there. Please. Opie and Anthony. All right, it's time to put an end to this mess. Last break of the day. The O&A Show, 212-757-1027, time to play. We're going to put this show out of its misery in eight minutes, and then down to Mike, you're next. Yeah, 212-757-1027, time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today? Bunch of them coming in, Ed. Bill Clinton from Washington. Oh, I learned your show today was more boring than Al Gore. Ouch. Ben from New York. I think Superfly has been stung by the giant mosquito. Ben also learned that Superfly can't read. John writes on the Incentive Feedback, I learned today that when the show sucks, bring in an accountant to start things up. Yeah. The accountant. Oh, yeah. Jonas was pretty cool, though. He made tax talk pretty interesting. Yeah. You know, like, he is an accountant. I know. I mean, rather have nudity. Of course. All right, let's go to John. Hey, John, what did you learn on the show today? Guys, I learned that Snoopy is two chair shots away from Ronald Reagan. All right, burn in hell, ass wrangler. All right, bye. Ass wrangler. Whatever, I don't even... DJ, what's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? I learned that, what's it called, you guys sure you don't even bother getting on the air tomorrow because you'll be competing against the radio icon of Two for Tuesday. Very true. Yeah, we'll give them another plug. Q104 has decided to do Two for Tuesday. Also, guys, did you hear about the new PlayStation? Yes, I did. About what happened with it? Yeah, they're not allowing it out of Japan. And the reason, again? They said something because they could use it as a worship because they could make missiles lock onto visual targets. Yeah, the graphics chip that's in it, they can use it in a missile to identify targets. And one more thing, I learned you guys are the king of radio tees because I sat here all day waiting for Psycho Mark outtakes. Oh, we did... You're sitting here talking about how boring it is to bring in an accountant. You obviously have the drunk bastard all ready to go. All right, where is the Psycho Mark outtake? We'll just throw it in real fast. Is it an outtake? Yeah, it's the outtakes, but we want to compare it with his new drug commercial. That's funny. The problem was we couldn't find the new drug commercial. All right, awesome, guys. All right, we'll play it right now, DJ. Cool, thanks a lot. All right, here it is, matter of fact. We got Psycho Mark outtakes. He has the smoothest voice when he's completely sober. He does a lot of the commercials that you hear on WNEW. He does a drug commercial where he's very, very convincing. We have the other drug commercial, at least. Is that one of them? I want the one where he tells parents how to tell if their kids are stoned. I know, that's the best one. That's the best one. That was the one we wanted to play today. You can't find it? No, but I think we got Psycho Mark doing a drug read here, I believe. In order for you to help your children resist the pressure to use drugs, you must remember that your children need positive role models. Positive role models will help your children gain healthy habits and attitudes. The examples you said will help children resist pressures to use drugs, pressures they receive from television, movies, and perhaps their friends. Drug abuse is a complex issue, and by addressing all the potential causes, we can come closer to a total prevention. This important message is sponsored by the Concerned Pilots and Professional Staff with Excel Air Service in Runcocoma. All right, look at that. You hear how smooth he sounds? Very smooth. Nice and sober during the day, right? Yeah, that smoothness from all the marijuana smoke. Doing a drug ad? Yeah. And now here's that same person at two in the morning when he stops by the station after night out. Here's the- Muds Lies on TV here. This is a coverage channel. This is great, you know.

In order for you to help your children resist the pressure to use drugs, you must remember that your children need positive role models. Positive role models will help your children gain healthy habits and attitudes. And attitudes, okay. Same person, 2 AM. Here's a g- Here's a geeky. Mudslides on TV here in the Disco. Here's a geeky.

Today I learned that Opie can play a foreigner song with the best of them. Yeah. Dan from Long F in Ireland. I learned that I was better off doing bong hits. Uh, listening to Bob Buckman and Superfly jumping from that top rope. I learned that Superfly should enter the Connecticut School of Broadcasting. That's pretty good. Steve from Connecticut. I learned that stuck in an oven with Jews is almost as offensive as seeing Louis Anderson's pudding. Jumbo-pun! Max from Jersey. I learned that Psycho Mark is a druggy. That's great. Let's go to Brian. Brian, you're next on the radio show! What I learned today, what I learned today was Muhammad Ali wasn't the only one who left the ring with too many punches to the head. Oh my God, dude, he sounded like, oh, like Alzheimer's. He sounded like Ronald Reagan on marijuana, dude. One, oh, he couldn't say it, dude. It was horrible. It was horrible. I love that wrestler, dude. Ant and I looked at each other two minutes into that and went, uh-oh. Oh, boy. Oh. You're listening to... Opie and Anthony on... One oh... What is this?

Punch out, Maverick, punch out. Stoner, Matt from Jersey. I learned that Psycho Mark sounds like Jimmy the Superfly after a few mudslides. Tom from Farmingdale. I learned that the rock will be a retard in 20 years. The Rock. Pete, what's going on? Yo, Owen, hey. How are ya? Yo, I learned that you'll never find Muhammad Ali and Jimmy the Superfly in the same room together. Okay, very good. Alright, fellas, you suck. What's up, Joey70? Alright, cool. Let's go to Gabriel. Hey, what's going on, Owen, hey? How are you, Gabriel? Pretty good, man. Just wanted to let you know, I'm wearing today on the Open Anthony show.
