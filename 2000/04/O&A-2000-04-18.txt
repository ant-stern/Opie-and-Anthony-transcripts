God damn I love that one Alright well we could play this real fast Yeah it's all for our Domino World CD Yeah remember that When we actually wanted to put a CD out with a radio station And we put a bunch of bits together And put the CD out Oh what a problem Believe it or not It made it out there no problems made a s-load of money Yeah we didn't get sued for it A ton of people bought this thing about two and a half years ago We were supposed to have a follow up to this But for some reason The lawyers The lawyers think we have some problems with our material these days I don't understand it We were gonna have a double CD out called Cringe That was supposed to be out six months ago Yeah Six months ago That was before our lives were put on hold Everyone's laughing at us Who laughed with you Ouch Alright we could play this real fast We had a request for it I don't know it was When the Packers and the Patriots were in the Super Bowl A few years back And we called a funeral home In Green Bay Wisconsin Gee I'm trying to remember that game I believe the Pats did really well What a circus We actually were broadcasting live from some place Up in Boston during that game By half time everyone was just drunk Not even paying attention to the game Just a blow out And they still got blood sewed up there Don't they understand I like when he screws up Like oh and blood sewed throws Intercepted and he walks off the field smiling Like with a smirk on his face Cause he knows how much money he's making He doesn't suck so bad Jack off Our jets aren't doing much better At least they have a reason So off to Meta World we called a funeral home In Green Bay Wisconsin We're in the Super Bowl and This is pretty freaking brutal check it out Hello Okay my name is Artie Milo And my father recently passed away Did your dad pass away did you say Yes yes he did When was that I don't know 2 or 3 days ago Now he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family And we just want to know If there's a way you can come over And like you know temporarily You know prop them up In the big chair So when the family comes over he'll be okay Until after the Super Bowl and then we'll bury him No we can't do that Mr. Milo Oh it was his one dream to watch the Packers In the Super Bowl And we already painted his face green and gold No I You mean Not get him until then Yeah well you could come over and maybe Pump him with whatever you do And you know preserve him Until after the bowl No I'm afraid we just can't do it Why it was his dream You know to watch the Packers in the bowl And we've been holding on to him For a couple of days now he's been in the barn But you know the coyotes have been Anipping and I don't think he's going to make it till Sunday No he died Who knows that he has died Hopefully no one but we just want You to come over and you know prop him up in the chair And maybe open up his hand so we can put a beer in there And we can't We can't do that We can't embalm anybody at home Once they're embalmed they can't be In a sitting position Well he's been in a sitting position Now and he's getting kind of hard But if you could maybe do something And then lay him down later We'd even be up to you know if you've got to break something It's okay We don't do that It was his one lifetime dream You see the Pack in the bowl with his family And we got the big screen TV and the chair for him We will not do that If your dad has died And if you really have not notified anybody You do have to do that You have to have the medical examiner's approval To take him away Okay look what if we put the Coffin in the house And put the TV on the coffin That way he'll be with the family Is there a law or something? No if he was embalmed and if he was able If there's no problem as far as Preserving him Would you put like a pack banner in his hand? Because it was his dream to see the Packs in the bowl We could probably do that I don't know if we could have a visitation In the house depending on how Well preserved he was and if we could get a casket Into the house Once he's embalmed he is laying down Right Do you think that's like degrading if we put The cheese head hat on him? Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you? Oh no that might not be a good idea Try to explain where his feet went Bye Okay 212757 1027 is our phone number It's the O&A show Welcome back to winter Yeah How to break out the winter coat today Yeah we're getting these nice days and then all of a sudden It sucks again you open the door you don't know what to expect Cold I guess tomorrow it's going to be alright though We're doing weather breaks now?

I'm on the eBay thing I have no clue It's some guy from our old high school John H. Glenn It was probably somebody that Picked up a CD at a live show years back And now he wants to cash in on it Yeah he said I gave it to him Don't tell Nobody to bid on it for 30 bucks That's ridiculous you can get them for 11.99 On MP3 Oh there you go Go to MP3.com And type in Rockcut and there it is In fact all three albums are available MP3.com All three albums And most of the songs On those three albums are available for free Download Oh look at that Joe what do you do If you want to just hear Maybe Anthony and his brother Joe perform live Oh you go down to Sargent Pepper's Pub in East Norquist On Jericho Turnpike this coming Saturday night Yes are you showing up this weekend I can make an appearance Sure You've never seen the cover band though No I've seen you guys do the cover thing We do all kinds of covers from everything 60's 70's 80's I saw you guys do it at Watch Hill a few times We all get drunk we play music and we throw up At the end of the night And you can watch Cal Bell Bill Fall off his drum school Cal Bell Bill plays the drums My buddy Foot is a keyboard player I watch your show a lot It's everybody you know from the show Drop on down Sure drink some Jack Daniels Cool Joe And Budweiser That's MP3.com I recommend Primal Side That's my favorite rock guitar But Shanking in the Yard is pretty cool too Shanking Shanking in the Yard That's a little more like Kitty or Little Slipknot That was my crystal meth days Alright fellas Talk to you guys later Bye man Get him from my brother Back to the paper Anthony I'm pretty Pretty disgusted at this whole thing That pregnant nurse That the doctor that she was banging Got her pregnant And then sticks her with this abortion drug Yes So she aborts the Fetus So she's saying no She's going to try to have this kid Because I guess the married guy didn't want to ruin his marriage Have to pay out a portion Of his salary for child support So he figures I'll stick it with some needles She'll have an abortion And I'm through with it The guy's out of his mind, he's obviously out of his friggin mind I'm not siding with the guy on this so don't get me wrong But this woman Is a selfish slob Have The doctors terminate This pregnancy They're saying that with this drug And she got like five times the normal Dosage from this guy It causes some Radical birth defects You're supposed to take this one drug And then take another drug that aborts The fetus, this one just screws it up so much That the woman's like whoa Get this out of here This is a disaster I'm thinking of getting a baby With a head of friggin silkworm So the odds of her having a normal kid right now are very slim Slim to none It's slim that it'll even live but it might And you know My own opinion here I'm thinking maybe she might want to have this kid No matter what condition it's in So she can get the child support from this doctor Because he's making a bloody fortune I'm sure Right, right So I'm thinking you know if it's a head on a respirator With an arm sticking out where the neck is supposed to be I'm thinking maybe I love him Or her, whatever it is, I can't even tell But I swear 17% of this guy's income I think it's very selfish Of her And don't give me The god thing Because she says I'm leaving it up to god And she's religious and that's why she doesn't want to have the abortion She's so religious that One, she's already divorced And two, she's banging a married guy So I don't think the religious thing Really holds up too well I don't know, I think she's being selfish A head, there's going to be a head on a respirator A baby head How long is she right now? Two months They say it could take up to a month Before they even figure out if this thing is human anymore Oh my god Bring back the freak show You know what that thing's going to look like? It's called punk Worse than thalidomide When they had the kids come out with the flippers Remember that? You laughed, that was a tragedy man This is insane The flipper kids from Canada Did you ever see that documentary On TV about the flipper kids from Canada? The thalidomide babies? Thalidomide man They told all these ladies that the drug was Safe, right? Is that how it goes? Yeah, it used to be used to prevent miscarriages And stuff, you know, if a woman was at risk She'd lay on her back, they'd give her some thalidomide And the kid would shoot out with the fins Amazing They all had flipper Like a big sea lion So they got rid of that drug Lickety split And now they got some new fun drugs Man, she taught her just to have the abortion Greed I got a song queued up here, Anthony Oh really?

Bye And one of the other things we want to do today Yeah, we call we collect a lot of crap for our radio show I mean a lot of crap we go through like four or five newspapers a day We read I don't know 10 to 12 magazines a week Except yesterday except for yesterday. Well, I was in a lot of pain yesterday I don't even remember doing the radio show yesterday You know we surf the web and print out stuff and a lot of this stuff never makes it on the air It's just a pile of crap. Yeah, but some of it is worth going through So I want to go through the crap file and get some of this on the air The crap file yeah, cuz look how big this is the crap is all stuff we were supposed to do on the radio all this Yeah Wow, it's a little of everything like there's a there's a wacky story that we found wacky I don't even know where we found this damn wacky horn, but let's get it out of the way So we could throw it in the garbage and move on It's a it's a story from the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology back in 1987 It's a story about a concrete enema Anthony. Oh, we should put this on the radio months ago, right? Let me read the story. Okay According to the journal a 20 year old man came into the emergency ward complaining of rectal pain Anthony how Seems he and his boyfriend had been fooling around four hours earlier. Hey And after stirring up a batch of concrete mix the patient laid on his back with his feet against the wall at a 45 degree angle While his boyfriend poured the mixture through a funnel into his balloon knot After the concrete mass hardened it became so painful that the dude sought medical care Under general anesthesia the one was dilated and and Some catheters were inserted alongside the rectal mass to relieve suction So They had to get this hard and mess out of there and yeah, okay Uh a happy bouncing baby chunk of concrete was delivered without incident The patient was kept overnight and discharged no pen and pun intended the next day the doc recommended a psychiatric consultation, but the patient declined and probably rushed back home to stuff a Wow a dog up his balloon up coming coming coming. So there you go a quick story from the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology from 1987 Anthony What the hell? Wow, why would you even do that? I don't know. I don't get it at all There's something with but it has to be real. It was in the American Journal of Forensic Medicine Yeah, of course I don't know. It is that yes as gay people Always trying to find a new new a gay sick Whether it's a little gerbil like that. They put up there and then and fires out of their butt Yeah, that old guy all the in in retrospect lighting the match wasn't a good idea We've all gotten that email. Yeah Yeah, we've seen that one and what's up with that? Everyone is gay these days. Yeah, everyone's gay everywhere Look, everyone's gay. Hey Is it hip to say you're gay these days And in the paper today Elizabeth Taylor is outing James Dean saying he was a pillow-biter Well, what what James Dean was one of her neighbors or something? He was one of her gay pals along with Rock Hudson and Henry Clifton all that stuff Rock Hudson and and Mark Hmm so now we're finding out James Dean was a Pickle smuggler a lot of people a lot of guys that go into the entertainment field Are into the arts they're into you know they started out in the schools in the plays and stuff and whatnot and I think gay people gravitate toward that thing more than straight people. You know what I mean? so it's it's uh, I Think it's safe to say that a lot more people in the entertainment field a lot more men in the entertainment field are gay than in the regular working world Yes, ouch ouch Let's go to Joe real fast Joe what's going on? Thank you, thank you brother LA Times 96 that's a fake story. That's what we're talking about Oh, no the felching incident so fake that is so fake Are you kidding me it starts out in retrospect lighting the match wasn't a good idea No, no, no, no, no, no, no, there's nothing to do with it. It wasn't about a gerbil Okay, it did happen. It did not happen The doctor he went to go take a look the man passed gas the thing shut out broke his nose All right, listen that that isn't even the right story. You are such a tool man. Joe Such a friggin tool that's an urban legend that stupid story He's like the guy the doctor went to look and he passed gas and shot the gerbil out It isn't even the fake story of how it happened Don't have any stupid DJs have read that story on the air claiming. It's a real story. It's true No, we've all gotten the email it starts off in retrospect lighting the mining the match. It wasn't a good idea It was a gay couple and they decided to put a gerbil where the Sun don't shine Yeah, next thing you know, they can't get the damn thing out So the one guy lights a match to see what he can find in there next thing You know the other guy, you know had some gas build up Yeah, the the match lit the gas gerbil comes flying out breaks the guy's nose And people send this thing all over the country saying I swear. It's a real story. Yeah, here it is In retrospect lighting the match was my mistake. Oh, it says it was my mistake Now it's the burn unit in the San Francisco City Hospital when I read it. It was something from the LA Times Yeah Let's see is any emergency room attempted to a retrieve a rat My son left the kid. Oh, this is a totally different one This is a one where it goes up the exhaust pipe of a motorcycle And it builds up and shoots the rodent out into the guy's face Come on, but it starts the same way same way. Yeah this one They were doing the gerbil thing and they were trying to get it out So one guy figured he would light a match To try to scare the gerbil out or show him where the light was at the end of the tunnel And it ignited a pocket of gas in the guy and shot the rodent out in flames right into the guy's face And uh, he suffered a broken nose and burns on his face. The other guys suffered rectal burns And uh, they try to present this like it's a real story Every time you read it, the city's a little different. Maybe the name's different. The newspaper's different And you mean to tell me at a it says and it says The newspaper's different a little different and you mean to tell me at a it says and at later at a press conference the doctor Press conference. Where is this press conference? I've never heard of a press conference about something like this in my life You show me the footage of the press conference And I don't care if 800 people come forward and say they know the guy they read the story.

Yeah, what's up? Hey, you guys are like killing me today. Today at work, first of all, I heard your little thing in that playing cue-calls with the, with the hillbilly guy, whatever, about the roofer. Oh yeah. And I was already in a hot seat today at work. I did not need to start breaking out and lacerating. I suppressed lacerating for another hour. I got in trouble. Now I'm on the thinking highway. I can't, I have my six-pack. I'm like dying over here, crying. You guys gotta stop because you're killing me. What made you laugh? Anthony's outtakes today? Well, that was classic, definitely. Those are always fun. The butt plug thing almost killed me. Oh, the butt plug, yeah, yeah. It's like one thing after another. And at work, forget it, that roofer guy? Yeah. The roofer thing? I couldn't, you know, I was trying real hard to be good because my boss was looking at me. And it was like, it came out right through my nose to laugh. It was like, I got clawed down on the carpet. I'm like, they're like, why are you laughing at? The girl's very excited today, OP. Well, thank you, Laura. You're as excited as Marie was. Oh, man. Some earlier. You know, I started listening to you guys a while ago, like two months ago, and I caught this call the first time listening. And you were like, oh, we're having a bad day. Yeah, yeah. Let me tell you, you guys are fabulous. We say that every day. I will never stop listening to you. You're the best. Oh, thank you. And you know what? You gotta stop, because siren. The siren always creeps me out. Yeah, yeah, the siren, yeah. The siren, yeah. The siren, yeah. All right, well, thank you, Laura. Yeah, all right. Listen, you guys keep it up, all right? All right, bye. Bye, bye. All right. Let's go to Luke. Luke, what's going on? What's up, guys? We're talking to you. You guys feeling all right? What's going on over there? You guys seem a little out of sorts. You're not your usual wacky selves today. Oh, are you insane? Well, I mean, you know, you are, but, you know, I just, you know, it seems like, you know, I'm a faithful listener. I've been listening since day one, and it seems like, you know, you guys seem a little bummed out about what's been going on over there the past couple of weeks, you know, the things and all that. No, we're fine. Yeah. It's a great week. Yeah, like last week was great. Oh, it's not great. Yesterday was great. Today, it seems like, you know, I play a lot of recorded stuff and I'm not going to have a problem with that. Well, there's some laughs involved with today. All right. Yeah, I mean, not to be selfish, I don't care if it gets indicated, because I got you guys here already, so it doesn't matter to me. Yeah, well, don't worry about it. That's for sure. You guys keep it up. Don't worry about it. I don't want to give you a hard time, all right? Everything is fine. All right, good. All right. Take care. I'm glad I backed in her as much as it does. Yeah, I hope she's in some severe pain doing the show. It's like in a wheelchair. Well, practically. One of Jerry's kids. I'm waiting for you to just wheel into the studio. You know, you're a nice guy, though, because we're walking down the hall to, you know, get into the studio to do the show today. Yeah. And I am walking like an old man. I'm not exaggerating. He's hunched over. His arms are hanging. I pulled out my back so bad, and I'm like just slowly but surely walking down the hall, and I thought for sure you were just going to go, Well, I'll see you in the studio. Yeah, later. But it's like, you know, visiting like grandpa at the old age home, and you're walking. And I got to walk around the grounds with him a little bit real slow. That's what Ant was doing with me today. I'm like, hey, he is a pal. It's like when I went to, when I took my mother and grandma to lunch before the Broadway show, and like we had a walk with grandma. And you're walking, and then you realize, oh, we're walking faster than grandma. You got to slow down. And you got to really slow down. So I'm walking to the studio, and it's like, oh, oh, we can't walk. No, I cannot. I'll slow down. I wanted to take a couple days off, but I thought you and Rick would kill each other. And doesn't that suck? Yeah, right. That probably would happen. Doesn't it suck like there's plenty of time once you get old to walk like that? I said that to Ant. Oh, great. This is what we have to look forward to when we hit like, you know, 65, 70 to walk like this. And you got to bang some fossil. You know? Screw that. Oh my God. Imagine that. I screwed that. I guarantee I'll get hookers. Guarantee I'll get hookers when I get older. Opie's got line of the year. What? Talking about girlfriends and wives and everything like that. Oh, well, did I say that one on the air yet? I think you have. I don't know. It just puts everything in perspective. Because you're talking about marriage and everything, and Opie's just like, yeah, right. Because I've had to listen to Anthony's horror stories the last few months, and I'm like, you know, Ant, my girlfriend, or my wife, I should say, my wife, isn't even born yet. Now that's a way to look at things. Your wife isn't even born yet. My wife isn't even born yet. And you're laughing at something stupid like that, but look at Michael Douglas. He could have said that in his 30s. Sure. His wife wasn't born yet, and it was true at the time. Now he's got that piece of ass, you know, Zeta Jones there. So my wife isn't even born yet. Isn't even born yet. I just don't want to wake up at 70 next to a fossil where her private parts look like a cow tongue. Oh my God. It's like hanging. We've all seen that picture on the Internet, right? When did my wife get a sack? What happened? So yeah, I'm in severe pain today. Yeah, so you're walking around all hunched over. Jim, what's going on? Hey guys, I almost killed me earlier. What happened? I went off the road. I was listening to the outtakes. I was laughing so hard. I had my eyes were tearing. I'm telling you, man, I went right up on somebody's lawn. Ah, cool. Oh, it was great. Oh, that was so good. Yeah, so funny. Great. It's funny unless it's you, you know? Yeah, but Anthony's not laughing. I'm always getting slain. I don't know what it is, too. I think I psych myself out. I go into that studio. I really want to just blow through it and get out of there. And I cannot friggin' do it for the life of me. It's like whenever we're doing a live read here on the air and Hope goes right before we're doing the read. He goes, Anthony, we got a read coming up. We got to tape this one so we can play it when we're off next week or something like that. Or for the client. So let's keep it to a minute and let's blow it out. And it's like the first thing is like, I'm gonna get that bad dad. I F it up. I can't take the pressure. I choke. A lot of people want to know how I hurt my back. It's simple. Just bending down. That's all it takes. Bending down to get a shirt out of my drawer. That's all it takes. That's all it was. Well, we've all done it with the neck. You know, you're in the shower and all of a sudden you're just like, I don't know, do something stupid like you turn your head or we lift your arms to, you know, scrub your head with shampoo. And on next thing you know, you got a pinched nerve in your neck. It's like, what's that about? Yeah. But that's what happened. Rick, what's going on with Bridget and her waxing? Yeah. All right. She's ready. She's here. The waxing people are here. Virgin. And we got the other studio set up. All right. Can we talk to Bridget real fast or? Yeah. I want to talk to the two ladies that are going to be doing the waxing too. Do they speak English? A little bit. A little bit? Yeah. Okay. We can talk to them too. Jay, what's going on? I just want to know who the heck runs off the road because they're laughing. Yeah, I know. All these people I call about that drive me crazy. Listen, I got something else though. We don't know what they're going to say that, you know? Yeah, I know. Listen, I got a job for Spad. Yeah. You guys have been waiting hard on me. It involves him working in a factory with Bugs Bunny. Say that again? It involves him working in a factory with Bugs Bunny. Yeah, the bombs. We gave him a lug hammer and he's got to tap the heads of missiles to see if they're okay. Yeah, testing out the bombs. Righting dud on him. You guys write Spad hard, but he does do a lot of great things on the show. No, he does. He called earlier where, oh my God. Well, we were proving a point there. Spad, you know, what am I doing? Very well done. He pisses off a lot of you guys, but he knows what calls we need for our show. Yeah, absolutely. Like, he wouldn't have accepted this one. Well, I had a work job when I got on. I'm just kidding, Jeff. Very good. All right, thank you. All right, bye. Any Bugs Bunny references okay by me? Yes. Bridget in the studio, Anthony, from Make Bridget Cry. Hey, Bridget. She's back. How are you? Fine, how are you? How you doing? We were able to talk you into getting your virgin, your bikini line waxed. Right. Live on our show. Right. But you will not allow us to watch. This is a first. I was willing to back out. Yeah, but we're wondering, like, you know, if we could maybe see a before and after. No. Even just us, so we could tell the listeners? No. Boy, she ain't budging. How about just the hair that's going to be pulled away? No. How about just a little peak? No. To the top of the rough? Nothing. The top of the rough. Nothing. Nothing. How about, like, your hairy legs? They're not hairy. No? All right, so what are we getting done today? You guys want to say? Okay, what? It's called a Brazilian bikini wax. Brazilian bikini wax? Which is everything. Carnival. Wait, you're going wood floor? I think so. It's everything, right? It's almost everything. Almost everything? What is left? Except for what? Wait, wait. It's like a Playboy wax. All right, wait, we got the wax ladies in the studio. It's like a Playboy wax. It's like a Playboy wax. It's like a Playboy wax. It's like a Playboy wax. It's like a Playboy wax. It's like a Playboy wax. What does that mean? You should be able to wear G-string without showing hair. G-string without showing hair. So is there a line of hair left? Correct. Okay, so it's like a mohawk. Little mohawk. It's like a little triangle. A little triangle with a tiny little triangle? On top of the, yeah. On top of the... Right, that area. That's right. The shape is, or they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they The shape is, or they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they like, they Oh, you're very naughty. Yes, yes. Oh dear. I love it. Do you do this with young boys? Yes. Do you ever get disgusted at some of the messes that come see you? No, all the clients are beautiful. All the clients are beautiful, I see. No one comes there and wants a wax and looks like Fidel Castro eating a London broil? No, no. No? And how is this done? What do you use? Just wax. Just wax? Yes, pine wax. Organic wax. Organic wax? Yes. What's organic? Made from pine. Pine? Organic wax? Yes. Oh, so it's sort of like what, sap? Kind of, yes. How about that? And you guys just rip it off? Yes. Will she scream live in the air for us? Let me tell you, there's a lot of guys that go down there too to get the back wax. Ouch! Yes? Yes. Ouch! Oh my God. Well, I really wish we could see at least part of the procedure, but she's... Well, are you bothered to get it done? Well, no, no, I don't want to have it done on me. Could Rick be... Wax my sack. Could Rick be behind you where he doesn't see your ground zero? No, because she's going to be in a position that he can't be there. No, she has to be undressed. She has to be relaxed. She has to be relaxed, she's got to be undressed. Can we have the wax strips when you're done with them? No. No? We can't even see your hair after... We've got to auction that off. We've got to auction that off. No. Oh my God, you're like a... Wow, you are so shy. You're like a virgin too. I'm amazed how she snuck in here. How she wheeled in to get on this show. I can get my free wax. Wow. So you're going to take all her clothes off for this or just their bottoms or what? Just the bottoms. Just the bottoms? Yeah. Did you check out the area to see what kind of job you're going to need to do here? Well, whatever the job she needs to get done, she's going to be doing it on her. It doesn't matter. So I just had to check. Are you going to be waxing the taint today? Yeah. That's the whole area down below. Yes, the undercarriage. You're doing the undercarriage too? Yeah. That's got to hurt. It sounds like, but it doesn't hurt. Yeah, it doesn't hurt. It's not a pain. Yeah, the technique that we use makes something easy. And how long will this take? No more than perhaps 30 minutes. 30 minutes? Are either or both of you a Lesbo? No. No? I'm thinking that would be a who. What a job to get into if you're a Lesbo. Say that again? In my place, it can be in five minutes. Yeah? It depends, you know, like how much hair you are. If you were a girl and you were a Lesbo, wouldn't you get into this line of work? Would you just see him all day? Oh, yeah, I would. PJ wants to sniff the wax on line 11. Oh. Yeah, see, she won't even let us have the wax with her hair in it. It's not even part of you anymore. Why are you so shy? But there's something about this. She's so innocent and... I don't know. Yeah. Most girls we would blow off if we weren't allowed to check it out ourselves. Virgin. Yeah, that's why, Scott. Virgin. Yeah. Virgin. All right, well, we're going to set up mics in the other studio so we can at least hear Bridget scream when they pull the wax. Yeah. Do you mind a microphone? Not at all. Oh, thank God. You see? We can have the ladies explaining what's going on for our audience. Yeah. Okay. Like you're applying the wax and we'll ask you questions about what's going on, I guess. Okay. All right, we only have like a half hour left in the show so we better get going. Let's go. Get cracking. No pun intended. There goes Bridget. She has a cute little sundress on. What kind of panties are you wearing today, Bridget? What kind? What kind? What kind? What color? Can we see your panties? It's a thong. Just pull up. Let's see what color it is. Just on the line. Come on. Let's see your panties at least. We're getting you a free waxing. It's like wearing a bathing suit. Yeah, don't you wear a bathing suit. What are you getting to wax for? Who's going to see you waxing now? Yeah, who is going to see this? Who is going to see this? You're not going to show us? Who the hell are you going to show? It's like polishing up the Ferrari and leaving it in the garage. Jesus. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Jesus. You guys talked me into coming here. I know. All right. But who's going to see it? You're going through all this pain and this effort? You're going to see it. This is just ... And now are you going to wear a bikini this summer? Yeah. So isn't us underwear just like a bikini? Yes. So if we happen to be at the same beach you were at, well we wouldn't see through it. You're pulling up a little. Just show us the color of the ... You can put your hand in front of the patch area so we don't see through the ... I can't believe we can't even see our panties. I can't believe you guys agreed to this. I haven't had to beg this much since I told my little niece to keep it a secret. Virgin. Yes, Scott. Maureen wants to know why you won't get it all waxed right off. Maureen. Hey. I don't know what's up. I'm talking to you. What's up? I want to know why didn't you just get all waxed? What's the point of having a little bit there? Yeah. I thought it was all getting waxed. Well, maybe she wants it all waxed. Tell her why you let her see it. What's the big deal? Tell her now. Why is she on there then? Maybe she wants it all waxed. Oh, wait. She's going to go for the wood floor, Maureen. She's going for the wood floor. Oh, yeah. Really? All right. Good girl. All right. It'll still be fun because we'll have them all on the radio explaining what's going on, right, Maureen? Yeah. All right. All right, ladies, why don't you get going? Why don't you get going? Get started. There go the ladies. How would you like to mow my lawn? Yeah. They'll be mowing her lawn. How would you like to mow my lawn? Huh? How would you like to mow my lawn? Huh? All right. I don't know why we keep inviting Bridget onto our radio show, but there's just something about her because she's like, you know what it is. This virgin, this prude. There's this hope, I think, that one of these days she's going to crack. But she gets more and more conservative and prudish with each appearance on this program. Ben's all pissed. We're all pissed. Ben's like, what are you not supposed to say that? Ben's like, Ben just said. Effort. Effort. Right on my... And I don't think he was pissed off saying that. That's so funny. Oh, yeah. Yes, he keeps up. Like, like, dude, the hair that's left on the wax. I mean... Yeah, because she probably knows what's like a mark. I'll do with it. All right. How do we get him up in the other... I'm grazing off of that thing. Keep it like a Chia Pet in his house. Kid Rick, I want to know... Little red Chia Pet. I want to know how we get him up in the other studio because we want to see what's going on over there. Of course, she's a natural redhead also. She's got that Irish red hair. All right. Yeah, nothing's going on in there. They don't have the microphones on yet. Retards! Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Yes, so I guess we're hoping... Boy, I hear something there. Rick? Rick, I hear the microphones in the other studio. He can't hear us, though. Yeah, what's up? Hey. Yeah, we hear it. Where are you? Are you in the studio right next to us? No, I'm in there, too. Oh, okay. Yeah. Why are... They're in the studio that Don and Mike use when they're here, so everything's all locked up and the windows are all sealed up. Rick, why don't you explain what's going on? I mean, you can stay in there for a little while, I'm assuming. No, get out. No. Rick? I don't get it. Uh, Rick? Yeah, what? Why don't you explain what's going on? Because you can stay in there for a little while. Well, right now they're setting up like a paper. Like paper, like if a dog were to go to the bathroom. Okay. They're setting up the paper on the counter. On the counter? Yeah, because we're going to... Hold on, you can't say that word. Okay. Aw! She's going to put her private area up on a counter. Okay. She's going to be parked on the counter. All right, so they're laying down paper. Right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's where we're at right now. All right, let's take a break. Once you give one of the... You've got to give the lady some head... She's going to get dressed now, but I have to leave? All right, wait, before... Hold it. Hey, Rick, Rick. You're on zipper? Rick. Okay, Maggie's on zipping, uh, Richard's, uh, little son... Rick's not listening to you. I know. No, I need to get on track. Come on. Come, get over here. Don't turn back. I can't hear you. I hear you. Why? The matter of the headphones is... Well, that studio's going to be set up directly. Rick, don't turn around. I'm just listening in. I felt early as an idiot. I can't hear anything. Don't start it. I felt early as an idiot. I can't hear anything. I can't hear you. All right, you guys there? Yeah, we're here. Hey, Rick. All right, listen. We can't hear. We can't hear. Rick. Oh, I'm going to punch somebody. I'm in no mood for this today. Can someone make a concerted effort to make this work? Yeah, what? Dude, all right, listen. We've got to take a break. We need the headphones for the girls so we can talk to them while they're doing this. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. He's not even listening. He's not listening. He's not listening. He's not listening. Just turn him down. We'll go to break. All right, we're going to go to break. Tell them not to start because we've got to get headphones on those women. Tell them, it's real simple. Tell them to get headphones on the wax people so we can talk to them during the whole process. Very, very simple thing to do, okay? That's easy enough. Oh, my God. It's like brain surgery. Thanks. I don't know. Are all, what happened? Hi, this is Jim Brewer and you're listening to the new FM Talk 1027AW, Opie and Anthony. And they're part of my new class. Then we gather every Tuesdays of the first month and we talk about our past lives. And I used to be a butterfly and I'm flying away. Fly, fly, fly. Opie and Anthony. Unfortunately, John, you guys are going to be in a lot of trouble. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. Congratulations, John. You guys are really funny and stuff. But you guys are taking it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. Don't make a mitle. 1027AW. All right, it's the Opie and Anthony show. We have Bridget from Make Bridget Cry in another studio. She's going to get a bikini wax, Anthony, live in our show. God only knows why. She doesn't want anyone to see it, though, so she's locked away in another studio. I think Rick's still in there because she still has her clothes on. Yeah, I'm still here, guys. All right, what's going on in there, Rick? Well, she got into the robe. And actually, I've gotten to the point where she's going to give us the wax strips with the hair on it. Oh, really? Yeah, I kind of convinced her of that. All right. So we'll have that for the ONA auction. That's good. That auction's going to be great. Yes, it is. All right. Various hair products. And I can almost see her little boobs. What? She's covered up. Yeah. I forgot she's got headphones on. All right. So she's naked in a robe? Yeah, she's naked in the robe, and the ladies have the hot wax heated up. Should I leave now? Is that the deal? Yeah, give Bridget the microphone so we can talk to her. Does she have headphones on, too? Yeah, she's got headphones on, too. All right. And can the ladies hear us, the waxers? Can the waxers hear us? Yes. Okay. All right. Bridget, how do you feel? Bridget, how do you feel? I feel fine. We're just trying to figure out the headphones. I want to use headphones. You heard that? Yeah, I heard that. All right. So you guys got the hot wax ready to go? Ready to go. Yes, ready to go. And how do you apply it? With like a paintbrush or with your hand? No, come on, guys. How come it's going to be with her hand? Use it. You have a penis. You are unbelievable. How do you apply the wax? I'm serious. She's got like a large spatula that she uses for that. Like a tongue depressor type thing? Right. One of those ones that the doctors use when you go to sit down. When you say open up and say, ah. All right. Yeah. Is Bridget going to feel it when you apply the wax? Of course. Okay. Because it's a little bit warm, you know? Okay. So why don't you describe what's going on. And Bridget, whenever you want to jump in, you're more than welcome. Okay? All right. And also describe her pre-waxed area. Is there a lot of hair there? No, there's not a lot of hair. I'm not talking about you. Or at least somebody else to describe your... Rick's still in the room. They haven't seen... Rick, get out of there. What are you crazy? I'm just setting up the last microphone here. All right, Bridget. This is for you to hold onto. Okay. Okay. Now she can answer all your questions. All right. All right. So let's start the process. I hope they can hear me. Yeah. Rick, get the hell out of the studio. Yeah. Just talk? Okay. Rick's leaving. Okay. Rick's gone. Now... Get up and wind to it. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Rick. You got to keep going. Come on. Tell Rick... Lock the door. Okay. All the ladies are in the studio. That's correct. Okay. Now, describe Bridget's patch there. Is it normal? Is it a little hairier than normal? Yeah. What does she got down there? I'm not looking at her. Come on, Bridget. Answer that question. Aw, you're going to look. You're going to wax her. You're going to see it, right? It's not me. It's Johnny. Well, you let her talk then. Yeah. Johnny, they want to know what it looks like. Beautiful. Oh, is it? Is it very hairy? Kind of hairy, yeah. Kind of hairy? Yeah. Is it growing down her legs a little bit? Come on, guys. It is not growing down my legs. Okay. Are they applying the wax? Baby powder. Baby powder, now. How's that Hyman look? Virgil. Virgil. Virgil. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. It's really disturbing. All right, so you're applying the baby powder. Mm-hmm. Okay, very good. Now she's putting on the wax. She's putting on the wax. How's that feel, Bridget? It feels warm. Great, Bridget's losing it to a Yankee candle. Aw. All right, they're spreading the wax. Yeah, and she's putting the first strip on. All right. Right? Oh, how'd that feel? That was quick. She's very quick. All right, let's hear a few more little screeches out of you. Okay. Tell us what's going on. Okay, she's putting more wax on. Okay, the warm wax. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then she puts the strip on. Oh, yeah. She pulls it off. Oh, how does that warm wax feel down there? It feels fine. Yeah, does it feel good? It feels fine. Is it flaky? It feels good. Is it pleasurable at all to you? It's scary. It's really scary. Scary. All right, and how does it feel when she rips the strip? So far, it's not so bad. She's doing the outsides. The outsides. Oh, I don't think they wax the inside, honey. All right. Oh. Hey, I kind of like the way that sounds, huh? Okay, what do you think? I think we're moving closer. We're starting from the outside, moving to ground zero, right? Yes. Okay. All right, let's hear some more. Okay. All right, tell us what's going on. Well, she's got one of my legs at a 90-degree angle. Yeah. Which is letting her get more area. Okay, more wax is being applied. Yeah, it's on. Yeah, okay, here. This one should hurt. Here we go. Oh, no, that wasn't so bad. Okay. How would you like them all my long? Huh? How would you like them all my long? Huh? Virgin. So you have a leg up in the air? No, no, just off to the side. Off to the side. Mm-hmm. Okay. All right, how much have they done thus far? I can't, I don't know. I can't really tell. No? They're getting really close. Okay. Oh, my God. What was that? That hurt. That one hurt? Yeah. All right. Yeah. Ow. Oh, that one hurt. Okay. It's not that bad. Ladies, how's she doing so far? She's doing very good. Very good? She's very good. Okay. Okay, so we're going to have a little bit of a break. We're going to have a little bit of a break. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Very good. Very good. Very good. Are we halfway done? No way. No? No. Oh, yeah. That is just the front. She has to do the back. The back? Yeah. Oh, yeah. All right. Okay. That one hurt a little bit. That was just one side. That was just one side? Yeah. All right. You're moving to the other side. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. You're moving to the other side. Virgin. No, she's going to get the whole- Oh, that sounds pretty good. I believe we're deep into the forest at this point. Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's getting there. All right. Yeah. Going for a waxed floor. Let's hear. Let's hear. Okay. She's putting the wax on. Okay. The guys coming out. Ow. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That rocks. That is so strange. Yeah, it's very strange. That sounds like a thick strip. How does it feel to have another person's hands down by your area? That's the first time ever, right? It's the first time ever. Yeah. I'm going to try to do a little bit of a No. No? Just say yes. Yes. Well, that's the first time with another woman that close down. Virgin. No, doctors. Okay. Now, what are they doing? She's- I prefer to rip it out with my teeth. That's how I wax all of my girls. Hello. How are you, pretty? Remember me? I am Mike Tyson. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. I will wax you. Here comes another one. Are they going to- Oh, this one's going to hurt. All right, this one's going to hurt. Okay, she's putting the strip on. Strip on. Oh! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Coming, coming, coming, coming. Oh, wow. Coming. Are we almost done in the front there? Yeah. Okay, so we're going to go ahead and put the strip on. Okay. All right, are the waxing ladies still listening to me? One is. Yes, I am. All right, how close are we to done? Oh, my gosh, this one's huge. Wait, wait, this one's huge. All right, hold on, hold on. Be quick with that. That's the middle, you know, that's why it hurts so much. Ah, the middle. That's right in the center. Oh, the good part. Ow. Oh! I'm getting told to stop tensing. No. Remember that. Nice. Bridget, it sounds like it hurts. It's, yeah, but it's quick. It's not that bad. Yeah. Okay. I have a red manager. Oh, my gosh. It's a red manager. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I have a red manager there. So, with another 10 more minutes, she should be done. Yeah. Yeah. Just in the front or the whole thing? No, they're doing the back now. The back. She's doing the back. All right, what position are you in right now? Like I'm giving birth to the sky. Oh, really? Giving birth to the sky. Your legs are up in the air kind of. Right. It's really scary. Okay. They're putting wax on that area there. How close to the balloon knot? Right on it, I think. Ow. Oh, man. That's great. We have a virgin getting her bikini wax for the first time. Ouch. Ouch. All right, so is the front completely done now? The wax is hot now. Yes, it is. Oh, you're very naughty. Oh, my gosh. All right, what's going on, Bridget? Okay, I think she's almost done. She's rubbing that strip on there. This one should hurt. Here we go. Okay, she's putting wax on. All right, more wax being applied to the taint, I believe. Yeah, I think. Wax on, wax off. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. That one hurt. Oh, yeah. Virgin. Virgin. Oh, that one hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Wax on, hair off. Bridget, son. Wow, that one hurt. Okay, just one more of those and I think it's over. The whole thing is done after this next one? I think so. I hope so. Wax lady? Johnny, that's the last one? No, it's not. It's not. Virgin. All right, so what's going on in there? More wax. More wax to the area, okay? Yeah. You're giving birth to the sky. Oh, that was a good one. This is how Bridget's going to sound when she loses her virginity. This is great. Just like her first time, it's going to be fast. Okay, this is the last one. Okay, the last one. Let's get a good listen. Thank God. Ouch. Ouch. This is what you ladies go through? This is nuts. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. Not that bad. It is not. All right, so. Because she's on air, you know. So wax ladies, what's going on? Are we just about done? Yeah, two more minutes. Now, what do you do as a follow-up to waxing? Do you lotion the area? Yeah, I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. Do you lotion the area? I do. I do. Do you rub it in yourself or does she do that? Yeah, she would do that. She does it or you rub it in? No, she does it. She does it. Wow. Do you watch them? The waxing lady would do it. Do you watch to make sure she does it properly? No, I'm not looking at them. Well, you got to make sure she does it right. I'm not sure she would do it. You know what the best way to apply that lotion is? Oh my gosh. She's putting a stringent all over it. Oh, a stringent so it's stinging? Yes, it is. It's a sea breeze. It's a sea breeze. All right. You don't want sea breeze. It'll smell like it. Let's hide. All right. So Bridget, what's going on now? She's putting sea breeze all over it. This doesn't feel very good. Be careful. Yeah. Is it all red? It's pink. Yeah. It's all pink, Ophie. How about that? How about that? It's pink. It's pink. It's pink. It's pink. It's pink. It's pink. It's pink. It's pink. How about that? How about that? It looks very cute. Does it? It looks cute, huh? It does. Can you show us the final product? No. Okay, terrific. Can I get dressed now? I don't know. It's up to the layers. Are they done with you? They're done with me. Yeah. Okay. So you're completely bare. Yeah. Get dressed. Rick, go clean the hairs and the wax. Wait. Don't come in yet. Oh, don't come in yet. Jesus. Perish the thought. Anyone sees a precious Bridget naked? Jesus. Stop it. Okay. Oh my God. She's not bad. All right, get your goddamn clothes on. She is. Yes, that was very nice, lady. Virgin. Oh my God. So that's it. Who's next? One of the guys is going to do that. Who's next? I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. Who's next? The guy's going to do the back hair. Who's next? Yeah. What do you do when you wax the guy? What do they always ask for? A sack? No, the back. The back? Oh. Yeah. You never had any guy come in and wanted his genital area waxed? Yeah, but we don't do guys. I don't do guys? No, not that area. I have some back hair. You do? Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. What about ass hair? No, we don't do that. You don't do that? No. So how come you do girls, but you want to do the guy? Because we don't want to mix the clientele. Yeah, of course. I'm going to embarrass that thought. Why don't we get all the ladies back in the studio so we can take a look at you guys, okay? Okay. All right, come on back in. There they go. Bridget, I think she's 19. 19-year-old virgin getting her first wax job. First wax job, 19-year-old virgin. Keith, what's going on? Hey, what's going on, guys? How are you? I'll tell you what. I did an about face, man. I got on the phone. I wanted to tell you to get this girl off the air because she's not doing much. She's not letting you see nothing, but hearing her go through this makes it worth it. Every little bit of pain, she deserves it, all right? Didn't you like those little sleeves? That's great. That's what she deserves. She should have showed you guys something, man. Who's coming here and don't show nothing? What is that? There's plenty of other girls I'm sure will wax. They'll show you everything. Get you guys off a little something. I can at least see her hair embedded in the wax. Something very erotic about listening to a young virgin getting her first wax job in another studio. Yeah, well, she's really a virgin, you know? All right, we're back in the studio, Keith. All right, Rick is holding the strips. Yeah. Let's see, man. Before me, I am holding the shroud of Turin. Look at this. All right, let's see. Open it up. Lift one up. Lift up. Well, come here. Oh my God. Whoa. Wow, you're a redhead. Cool. Look at that, dude. Oh my God, I'm going to get sick. Why? It's a pubie hair. Yeah, but there's all sorts of other crap mixed in with it. No, it's just the wax. Yeah. It's natural. Wow, look at that. That is bright red, isn't it? It's like Bozo the Clown, head in the leg lock. Not anymore, though. All right, save those, Rick. We will auction them off. Well, don't save them near me. The wax lady is not amused. Sorry, Bridget. I'd rather see those things actually on the girl. Did you guys have fun in there? Did you have a good time? It was all right? All right. Yeah, she was good? Yeah, she was a very good girl. That's pretty good. Is her area nice? Would you consider her area pretty? Would you consider her area, is it cute? Is it pretty? It's normal. It's normal? Yeah. They are normal. It's a little smaller than most. Normal. Yeah? Tight? Oh, please. Come on. Come on. Virgin. All right. We want to plug you ladies. Where could other ladies get the wax job? Maggie and Jane, right? Johnny? That's how you spell Johnny? Yeah. J-A-N-E with that weird line above the E is Johnny? All right. It's the J sisters, is that true? That's correct. 35 West 57th Street? Yes. Oh, you're close to here, right? Yeah. 35 West 57th Street, New York, New York. Give them a call if you want to get waxed. 212-750-2485, right? Right, yeah. You did a very, very good job on Bridget. You're totally bald down there now, Bridget. I think so. Yeah? Yeah. Nothing down there. Smooth as a baby's ass. Right. How about a quick look? Yeah. She ain't ever... You know when you're talking, oh, and we've had some girls up in the studio and like you know they'll crack after a while? Yeah. Not her. No, I don't. It's done. It's just fun to have. Like there's no way in hell she is even showing like upper thigh. I know. Amazing. What could you show us? It's got to be something. What do you mean? Virgin. What do you mean? Give us something. Besides what you're showing right now. What's the most you could show us right now? Yeah. Yeah. How about your butt? How about nose? Bend over and pick some up. Yeah, just lift up your dress like it's a bikini bottom. Right, ladies? But it's not. Jesus Christ. Isn't that normal? You get bends all pissed off. Jesus Christ. I think everyone's pissed off. I'm sorry. All right. Frank, what's going on? What's up, guys? I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. What's going on? What's up, guys? How are you? That was so hot. Oh my God. I never thought I'd be into that kind of stuff, but I'm totally into SMM. SMM, I just found out. Yeah, the little moan screams were pretty good. Oh, is she still in the studio? Yeah. Bridget, I make six figures. I will make you so happy. Where's the decimal? It's where it's supposed to be, Anthony. I didn't lose any money like you. All right, guys. Take it easy. Thank you. Bye. Yeah, that was pretty good. All right, Bridget, you're clean down there now. Yep. Completely shaved. Done. And we're not seeing any of it, Jesus Christ. No comment. No comment. Oh, whoa. What do you mean by no comment? She doesn't want to comment. She doesn't want to comment. Okay. Thank you, ladies. Thank you. Thank you. I guess good job. We like to say, you know, we like to look and say, hey, wow, that is a great job. But we'll just have to take Bridget's word for it. Yeah. Jasmine, what's up? Hello? Jasmine? Yes? How are you? I'm fine. You're on the air. All right, what's up? Okay. I just wanted to say that I'm surprised that she wasn't screaming because when I first got it done, it was painful. I was screaming and hollering. I think it's all the pros, actually. It's amazing how she took it. I couldn't even walk, really. I didn't want to walk. Does everybody remember where Bridget first came to our show? Yeah. Remember this? Her boyfriend, she was with her boyfriend. She figured she'd give him a Hummer for Hummer Tuesday. And after she was done, the boyfriend pushed her forehead, knocked it to the floor and said, I hope you're, you know. I always knew you were a little what? Little what? What did he say? Little whore. A little whore. And now she's like totally clammed up. And it was the first time she ever, you know, tried to give one of those, right? Yeah. All right. Like a little neck clam. Like wham. Can't get in. Nothing in there. Well, thank you, Jasmine. All right, bye. I think your boyfriend wrecked it for everybody. Let's go to Tom. Tom, what's going on? You should have been in the recording. Hey, guys. How you doing? I love it. But you messed up. You got to remember for the next time, have the girls number the strips. Why? You can put it back into position again when you get it. Oh, like rebuild it? Rebuild it. Like a jigsaw puzzle. You got piece number one that fits in the slab number B and block number C and all of that stuff. There you go. You guys are great, man. I love listening to this stuff. And I love that she got what she got there. She should have showed, like the other guy said, she should have showed you the jump. Well, thank you, Tom. But it happened. All right. Be good, guys. Look at the time. Yeah, with that, we got to get out of here. Yeah. Well, Bridget, thank you very much. Thank you. Ladies, great job. The J Sisters 35 West 57th Street, if you want to get your patch waxed. Right? Junk waxed. All right. Thank you, guys. We got to get out of here. We'll be back tomorrow at 2. Donna Mike are next. Thank you, Bridget. Thanks a lot. Bye bye. There they go. And we're out of here too. And we'll see you guys tomorrow.
