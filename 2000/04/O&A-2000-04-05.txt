 Alright, here it comes. Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler. I feel a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman show. It's the Opie and Anthony show! Let's fight! It's the most talked about radio show in New York City, baby. Why is everyone listening to our radio show, Anthony? Go away, nothing to see here. Move on. Why is everyone tuned in once again to the Opie and Anthony show? Why, why, why, why? Move along. Move along, nothing to see here today. Move along. Move along. That's it. You're gonna have to disperse. Change your radio dial. Stop being paranoid. Nothing's going on here today. Move along, people. Move along. You're gonna have to disperse. Please move. Stay behind the barriers. Nothing to see here. Nothing to see. This was the song they were playing when they had a big radio show up here. Yesterday afternoon, Anthony? Yeah. I think we need to break this up today and we'll get the festivities going in just a bit. It's the Opie and Anthony show. On 1027 WNAW, crank this bad boy up. Opie and Anthony. I like that. This is debauchery mania. I like that. Prostate exams for everyone. I like that. On 1027 WNAW. Are we having fun yet? I think so. I have to check. Yeah. Are we allowed to have fun? Uh, no. We're not. Syndication never. What happened? Okay, horrific. I don't understand. What? What? I thought we were all just having fun. Yeah. What happened? We are. We were doing a radio show. People were enjoying it, right? Making people laugh. Making people forget about their horrible, miserable days. Right. That's all we do. That's our job. Right? Yeah. What happened though? What happened to the fun? Aren't we in radio to have fun, Anthony? That's what I thought. Oh well. I'm going to have fun. Syndication never. Alright, Ant. Well, well, well. Where do we start today? Where the hell do we start today? Yeah, that's kind of a tough question. We have so much stuff to go over. We have so many things to get to. We have three entries into the most offensive song contest. Yeah, the competition heating up, Opie. We've got some real contenders that have come in. We're going to definitely play three brand new ones today. Yeah. And I guess that's all we're going to do. That's it. I guess right off the bat we've got to find out how J. Moore's show was last night at Rascals. At Rascals, yeah. After leaving here in a tizzy, in a ball wound up. In a huge tizzy. He did a show at Rascals. I know when I saw him down at Rascals he was hysterical. Just wondering if anybody saw the show last night. Well, I got a few emails and like always he killed last night. Yes, very good. There wasn't any bloodshed, any brawling down there. That would have been interesting. There are some unbelievable clips from the mess that was the Opie and Anthony show yesterday. Well, we went back to the office and watched the video. Of Fat Guy and J. Moore just going at it. There's some great clips on the unofficial website. Unbelievable. I'm sure they'll be removed soon so you better hurry up and check it out for yourself. Well, let's go to the phones, Anthony. They finally got them working. We've been stalling here because they had to reboot the system. But it looks like they're up and running so let's say hi to Keith. Hi Keith, what's going on? Hey. How are you? I'm fine. I just wanted to make a comment about yesterday's show. It was the best damn radio I've ever heard. That was some day. Unbelievable. It was a lot of fun to be a part of. That guy got his balls beaten off. Well, I just don't understand what was going on yesterday. I don't know what the motivation was. I don't know what the motivation was. Well, he got up at J. J did the right thing. He went after him. Yeah, okay. All right, J. Ruel, you guys rock. Take care. Thank you. Our accountants online. Are we allowed to put them on the air? Let's see. Oh, man. You got me on the air? Hey, you're on the air. Don't say anything stupid. Would I say anything stupid? Yes. Right. Ladies and gentlemen, here's the reason why I owe $19,000. No, no. The gentleman wants $19,000. What? They want $19,000. Oh, they want. They're going to say you owe $19,000. Oh, I like that. After I get through with you, you're going to have to owe everything. He sounds like the guy at the NASDAQ board. Thank you. Always the upside. Always talking the upside to the whole thing. Anthony. Yeah. You owe me some information. Yes, I know. What am I waiting for? Don't you worry. I'll be. Oh, what? Your stuff is finished. Your stuff is finished, all right. Your stuff in 1999 is finished. Oh, the 1999. Oh, that. Okay. It's all done. Well, let's just put it this way. I owe $19,000 from some past information. Great. What do I owe total if you add in this year's information? You owe nothing from this information. They're going to owe you when I get through with them. Oh, awesome. You love me now? What? What's wrong? Hold it. Hold it. Rick is freaking out. See, I wasn't here last week when this whole account thing went down. Oh, yeah. You have no idea I owed $19,000? I heard it on a tape earlier that you owed $19,000. I didn't realize it was for past. I thought it was just from the past year. No, that's why I'm scared. Oh, what a... Dude, break up with my sister. You ain't got no money left. So, Benny, are we looking good? Looking very good. Who's going to pick it up? Sending in Sandy again? You got nothing to worry about? Yeah, you hit on her last time. No, she hit on me. She came in twice also. I wouldn't be surprised. No, no, she wouldn't do it. You owe me a visit, Opie. At least you got money. Yeah, that's why she hit on him. You owe me a visit, Opie. No, because then you're going to hit on me. No, that's what you wanted last year. No, yeah. Anthony came in because he liked it too. Yeah. Anthony, give me an information. I will. I'll call you right after the show. I'll be here until... I'll be here in time. So that $19,000 looking a little better these days, huh? Yes. No, we'll take care of it. This is what they say. They didn't say what I asked, but I say. Oh, that's it. They're going to listen to me. Oh, that's what you need is a cocky accountant. Yeah, one that can shove a decimal point over a couple of places. Absolutely. If it doesn't come out right, we don't file it. We do it over. You do it over, make sure it all makes sense, right? Well, did you save all the money you got back last year? No, that went into some high-risk tech stock center. And it's pretty gone over the past couple of weeks. You're investing in the market. You're good. Yeah, we'll keep losing money. It'll be a deduction for next year. You got that right. Benny, you see how I dress. You think I saved any money from last year? I know the way you dress. Okay. With all the holes in your clothes. I see all that. All right, Benny. All right, I'm going to work. All right, Ben. I'll call you after the show. Okay, guys. Bye. Bye. All right. There he is, Ben. Hey, look at that. We love him. Look at that. He's great. He's looking a little better for the upstart. Here's our ticket to the penitentiary. Let's move that decimal point over and everything will be okay. That's all? Okay. That's all? While you're writing the number down, you sneeze, the pen moves, you go, oh, look at where that decimal ended up. Now it's 19 bucks. It's funny because after Benny does our taxes every year, he disappears to the tropics for a while. Yeah, what's up with that? I don't know. Hey, where are you going? I'm small, tropical island, Iceland. Why are you leaving us, Benny? Hey, where are you going? We've got a relationship here. Right, this is okay, right? I can just mail it in, no problems, right? I won't get a bill for 19 grand, will I? Oh, no. All right, let's go back to the phones. What is so funny, Rick? You're laughing because of my misery, right? I'm dumbfounded how you could have something like leftover from God knows what year that added up to 19 grand. Not from God knows what year, it was last year. It was last year. It happens. It happens, right? A little oversight. I'm finding out you do indeed have to pay that capital gains tax. I thought that was just a goof. Well, it's gaining on you. It is gaining. All right, let's go back to the phones. 2127571027, let's go to Lisa. Hi, Lisa. Hi. How are you? I was trapped in my car yesterday. I could not get out. I was late for class because I could not get out of my car listening to those guys fight. It was amazing. I was a half hour late for class. I didn't even care. It was the best radio I've ever heard. It was amazing radio. I got to hand it to Billy and Paul for their last appearance ever on our radio show. They were memorable. They went out with a bang. You know what? I have two kids. A huge bang. All I had to do was just rub his back and just say, okay, baby, you can stop crying now because he was just a huge baby. Well, I kind of feel bad for Billy and Paul because they dug their own grave yesterday. I feel bad for Paul. I don't feel bad for Billy. Please. That seems to be the consensus. A lot of people sympathizing a little more with Paul than with Billy. Oh, God, Billy, what a crybaby. Good Lord. Yeah. Anyway, that's it. Love you guys. All right, thank you. Bye. Rich from Jersey checking in. ONA getting syndicated is like Charles Manson getting paroled. What an analogy that is, huh? Every time we come up to the parole board for syndication, we just sound like babbling idiots. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. I don't need to be paroled because I'm on the outside. You people are here on the inside. I'm on the outside already so I don't need to be paroled. That's how you sounded when you had to explain yourself to the boss today. I don't understand what you're talking about because what we did was what we did for the sake of doing what we had to do. Not what we did for the sake of what we might have done if we didn't do what we did. Ah, screw it. Who wants to be syndicated anyway? What the hell's wrong with you boys? I've had it last night. I've called everyone I could call. I've even called your goddamn parents. Trying to get you boys to stop. They believe you're very talented boys. I wouldn't have brought you on board if you weren't. But God knows you can't be doing this. How many times do I have to say it? What type of word am I going to spell it out? Am I speaking flat Healy? No. No, you're not. Okay. We kind of found out today that a month was tacked on to our sentence. Let's just put it that way. A month! Another month. We don't even know how long we have to wait for this so-called syndication thing. A month has been added on to our sentence. You know what it's like? Did you hear some of the experiences of the Iranian hostages years ago where they used to put the bag over their head and go, hey, you'll go home today. You'll go home today. And they'd bring them out and make them get dressed in their best suit because they were going home. And they'd drag them outside of their cell, let them see the car, drive them around for a while and drive back to the cell and go, you're not going home today. It was like psychological warfare. That's what they're doing to us. That's what happens with us. Syndication now. Yes, you syndicate today. No, you don't. No, you don't. Another month. Oh, wow. At least. At least. I don't even want to answer the phone. I'm expecting a call from Boston. That's not going to be pretty. What the hell are you going to do? You've got to keep your mouth shut. Anyway, let's move on with Roger. Hi, Roger. What's up? Hey, what's happening, fellas? Hey, man. Amazing show yesterday. I was cracking up in the car and the gym everywhere. Yeah, that was some real stuff. But, uh, quick. I think that beats the homeless show, the homeless shopping spree. Without a doubt. Another one Jay was involved in. I never thought the homeless shopping spree would be beaten, but it was yesterday. Just a quick thing I wanted to say about Paul and Billy. I mean, it was just unreal what I'm hearing from these guys. It was kind of like watching wrestling and your two favorite guys just turned. You're just like, no, no. What are you doing? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Yeah, that was kind of how it was. Yeah, like two good wrestlers going bad. Yeah. Because all of a sudden I remember. Yeah, their faces and they turned heel. Yeah, and Paul's face turned from happy-go-lucky to I'm going to kick someone's ass. Yeah. That was bizarre. All right. Thanks a lot guys. Thank you, Rod. Syndication, how? Syndication, how? That's a good one, man. That is good. We don't know. We're going to be like 65 and finally get syndicated. Syndication now, Opie. Right. We'd like to welcome our affiliate in Bangor, Maine. It finally happened. This is great. Syndication 2045. This is wonderful. This is a new technology. We're the last earth-based show to syndicate. That's great. They're all syndicated on Venus and Pluto. We got bang. That's right. Now we're in Bangor, Maine. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony family. Hey, honey, let me see your gas. This is a funny bit for our new audience, Bangor, Maine 2045. I'm going to punch you in the uterus. You're a whore. Ouch, my teeth fell out. It is killing me. Hey, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. I've been dead for 20 years, but I'm still doing the news. Dateline, Bangor, Maine, we welcome Opie and Anthony to affiliate WBMN. Finally syndication now. What are you boys doing? You can't talk like that. We're going to lose your affiliate. I'm sorry. What did we say? I know you didn't mention the name, but you mentioned the grandchildren's name. Oh, boy, now it's good. We just lost our Bangor affiliate. In the words of Robert Platt, does anyone remember laughter? I mean, come on. We're just trying to have fun here. It's a joke. It's a joke. Why not? Wow. It is what Mel Winslayer is, isn't it? I can't think about that, though. My butt's sore. Yeah, that's a meeting. I'm never on the phone at home, ever, with anything concerning the radio. I'm not. I just don't get calls at home. I don't make calls at home. We do all our business here at the station, and then I leave. I speak with Opie on the phone, occasionally Rick, but it's usually, you know, what are you doing? Yeah, that was a pretty fun show or something like that. I was on the phone today. Making sure you had a job. I was on the phone today with Ken on GM. That's just not like you. I know. And for once in my career, I'm like, ah, F it. I'm just like, I'm not even going to call. Usually I'm on the phone trying to see what's going on. I'm just like, ah, screw it. Yeah, what do we do this time? Always in it. Always bad. I think we still have jobs, though. Yeah, could be. You'll be waiting for syndication longer than Elion will be waiting for his mom to show up. Oh, his mom's dad. Chaz from Jersey. Thank you, Chaz. Did you see that protest for Elion? And they got all out of hand. They were riotous. Riotous. Riotous Cuban. They have this sign, what, pray for Elion, and they crashed a police blockade gate with it. What the hell are they doing? I can understand some people protesting and then crashing through police lines that are maybe blocking something they want to get to. What did they want to achieve by breaking through police lines for little Elion? Elion. Hey, we got us. The good Cubans, right? The cigar. Yes, we do, Anthony. But we've got to take a quick break here. Great phones on hold. If you're on hold, please stay there. We'll get to you next. I don't know why we always get ourselves in this situation. Stupid! You're so stupid! Okay, terrific. All right, listen, that's a little too real. Stupid! You're so stupid! Who had audio in the boss's office? Nobody can yell that. That's exactly what I heard today. Wait, let me hear it one more time. Isn't that funny when that word actually comes up in a meeting? Stupid! You're so stupid! You know, when was the last time you were called stupid? Stupid, okay. I swear to God, the last time I was called stupid, I had to be... I can't even think. Had to be elementary school. Yeah, definitely, like fourth, fifth grade. Stupid! You're so stupid! Actual audio of our boss, I swear. Stupid! You're so stupid! Prove it's not our boss's voice. I dare you. I dare you. That's what we heard. But we're just trying to have some fun. Stupid! You're so stupid! That's the voice of a guy that just has had it. You know what I mean? I'm not going to do that! I'm not going to ruin your lives! You're totally stupid! You're so stupid! Oh my God. We were called stupid! Stupid! You're stupid! I swear it had to be third grade. I threw a thermos, a classmate's thermos, the old glass thermoses, the plaid ones, they shatter inside, in the playground, against the tree. And I got called into the principal's office, and the kid that the thermos belonged to was sitting there crying, and the principal shook the thermos, and it was the broken glass, and he said, Anthony, why did you do this? I said, I really don't know. And he looked at me and said, you know, you're just stupid for doing this. It stuck in my head. Now, fast forward, fast forward, 20 frigging years, and all of a sudden, Stupid! You're so stupid! Stupid! Once again, I'm being called stupid! Or at least I have a pal that's also equally as stupid as I. Open. Stupid! You're so stupid! What do you say to that one? Someone calls you stupid? There's no response to it for the love of God. You can't say anything bad. Okay. I'll do it. You're right. I'm stupid. Stupid, stupid. But I got good teeth and good hair. Old Bill might be stupid, but he runs Old Bill's coffee shop. Okay. Scott's right. You're never called stupid. Okay. What do you think about that, Scott? They called us stupid. Okay. Yeah. All right. Okay. Terrific. Yeah. Opie and Anthony. Stupid! You're so stupid! N-E-W. All right. More with your stupid pals, Opie and Anthony. New York's Stupid Radio. O-N-A. Stupid. Let it be known, Opie and Anthony. Just trying to have fun. We're just trying to have a little fun here. I just hope someone out there gets it before we get fired. Stir it up a little. Have a little bit of fun. That's all we're trying to do if you think about it, really. I love your show. Thank you. Who's your stupid radio? O-N-A on N-E-W. Stupid radio. Stupid. You're so stupid. I love you because you're stupid. I love you because you never ever ever ever ever ever. We're just trying to have fun. Have a little fun. Give some people something fun to listen to on the drive home, Opie. That's right. That's all we're trying to do if you think about it, really. A firing offense? Maybe. I don't know. I need a box and a doughnut. We're not like the guy that spits in the trooper's burger at the drive-thru. We're just having fun. I don't know if we're hurting anyone. Sure, we might be. Stupid. But we're just trying to have fun. Hello, N-E-W. Hi, this is Corky. Oh, hi, Corky. You two are stupid. Thank you, Corky. Corky's calling us stupid. Everyone else is. Stupid. We had the worst timing in the world, too. I know. Tell me about it. I was on the phone. What? I'm looking at the C-Nightly News. This just in. Opie and Anthony dubbed stupid. Their boss is stupid. We have this clip of the boss. Stupid! You're so stupid! There's a piece of audio from the office earlier in the day. Merrill Lynch downgrading Opie and Anthony to a stupid. Oh, man. Stupid! I swear it was third grade. I was stupid. Once again, I'm revisiting stupid. Stupid. Let's go back to the phone. Hello, Opie and Anthony? Hello? Hey, Mike Tyson, what's up? You two are stupid. S-L-P-I-N. Stupid. Matt, what's going on? Hey, what's up, Bowen? How are you? Great radio yesterday. Thank you. I was fortunate to be at the courtyard yesterday to see that prize fight. Oh, you have a prize fight? Downstairs? Oh, yeah. Right around the corner. I had to check it out. Nice little crowd forming. Yeah, that was classic. And there it comes right out the door. Makes a beeline for the fat bastard. That was amazing stuff yesterday. Yeah, the funniest thing was after everything, they're all separated. That fat bastard made a beeline to the first bench he saw. Huffing and puffing. You faggot. I don't think anybody's denying the fact that he's overweight. Oh, a little bit. He could get winded like that. Yeah, I mean there's no need to hold this guy back. He wasn't getting up. But yeah, the gay thing. Wow. Just faggot and gay homo. Yeah, I mean, he's yelling at everyone, Bucket. Why don't you go up there with your faggot? Antisemitic words and then the other thing. I don't know. And it didn't seem to totally be in fun. It was worth the 30 seconds though. Yeah. Thank you, Matt. Someone has Jay Moore's Bucks hat that you wore. Let's see. Let's hit that. Bill, what's going on? Yeah, what's up guys? You have Jay Moore's Milwaukee Bucks cap from yesterday? Yeah, I got it. I swear. I swear to God. It's green. I even put it on. He's got a little tighter head than me and I got a big head. Where'd you get the Bucks cap? You're out. Look, some guy was there videotaping the heavy-set guy before it even began. I'm not sure what he was doing. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Well, listen, we got Jay Moore calling in. We've been waiting for him to call in to the radio show. I swear I'm not just doing this. Look at the time for yourself. We're running really, really late. We're going to take a quick break and we'll talk to Jay Moore next about his show last night and how he's feeling today and hopefully he's not pissed off at us. All right? Right. We'll talk to Jay next. Stay there. The OPM Anthony Show. Other debauchery on the way. Stay there. 1027 WNEW. All right. Let's go right to the phones. All right. Let's go right to the phones and say hi to our pal, Jay Moore. Hey. Hi, everybody. Jay. Jay, first of all, I want to apologize that I made you wait two minutes there. No, I hung up and called back. We usually whisk you right on the air. No, no. I understand. You guys have to run your spots. So I just hung up and made coffee and I called back. What are we doing, D? I smoked spaz. Spaz is like Jay Moore, but Jay Moore just called. What an idiot. Well, we apologize. You shouldn't be waiting too long. No, no, no, no. You got to run your spots. You got to pay for it. Those sponsors are wonderful sponsors. D, Betty and what is it? Mind Spring. Mind Spring, yeah. Lovely folks at Lowenbrough. Rockaway Betting, my personal favorite. None of them as good as the brilliant Jay Moore, though. Let me just say that. Jay, I am stepping aside. No comedy out of my mouth while you were on the air. Oh, I don't like this already. I wouldn't want to step on you. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I don't like this already. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. And we all know I'm the only one who's going to be on the air. I'm gay because I'm blonde? Alright, hold on, hold on. Let's go to Bill who has Jay's Milwaukee Bucks cap and he's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. He's going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. We're going to be in the show. you guys want to hear. You guys are very innovative. We were tired of hearing you. I was tired of hearing you. Jay too. Jay, you had your boys already set up on that. They were buzzing around you like bees. And I'm sure they knew if you got hit, they would have been fired. You're a sucker. I don't know about that. I'm sorry, Anthony. I'll see. I thought it. And then you know what? I thought Anthony later. He had a white baseball cap on. And he looked like a human lizard. Bill, put it this way. We have clips of the fights on the unofficial website right now. And it's clear that twice Jay got through the crowd and got to Fat Guy. Through the crowd, through his friends. That poor, heavy, sick guy was on his own the whole time. Bill, the fact is half those guys that were there were part of our show. Look, you guys can sing together. You can't talk together. One at a time. Bill, I'm going to do a duty in your hat. I've got a better stand-up than you. Oh yeah, sure you do, Bill. I need five minutes. All right, Bill. My material is five minutes, six. Bill, hurry up because your 15 minutes of fame has just got over. Where is it hanging? Anthony, you look like a human lizard with your big eyes. Hey Bill. You look like a nut. Yeah, that's me. I'm going to do number two in your hat, Jay Morrow. And I'm hanging up on you guys. Howard rules. Howard sure does rule. Of course he does. All right, what's up, Jay? Did he hang up? Yeah, he hung up. What a douchebag. I'm going to take a dookie in your hat. That's good stuff. I'm upset he doesn't find me attractive. You'll always be attractive to me, Dolly. That's hysterical when guys call up and they don't find me attractive. His hair is blonde. I'm very upset. Men don't find you attractive. And you do have a cute ass though. Thank you. What the hell is that about when a guy says you're not attractive? I know, like hairs. I'm in my apartment. Well, even if you're not invited to the party, you still want the invitation. Even if you don't want to go to the party, you still want the invitation. What's wrong with me? How is the show, man? Standing ovation, my friend. Let's back the truck up. First of all, let me start here. You never really said goodbye to us because you rushed out of here because you were so pissed off. I was pissed off because I didn't get a clean shot on the fat guy. So you left the studio and then what happened? I left the studio and there were people milling about the diner. You know, for the record, the people that were holding me back were not my friends. I brought two people with me and both of them I told them to let us go. And it was your guys. It was Kevin and Jeff Norris. And Steve. And Steve. All guys that most of our listeners have seen on stage at the road show. Those guys are big boys. And I only got through Kevin and Steve twice. Yeah, Kevin is huge. Kevin was at the show last night. Oh, was he? And the fact that I never showed up at the rest, I put out the APB for him. But anyway, that guy in my hat, that really bothered me more than anything. The whole thing that I took from the entire day and evening is that I lost my box cap and that pissed me off. And I was going to give that guy like a grand for the hat too. Really? How about I fight that guy for the hat? Let's go to the NBA store and get you another one. Oh, by the way, that shirt on eBay isn't the shirt because I'm looking at my shirt right now. Ah, very nice. That's a soccer bet. Don't take that shirt off eBay. Tell the guy he's a piece of garbage. It's all shitting that off because my Matt Paholaj shirt is sitting right here on my chair. All right, cool. Now, Jerry, so you go to Raskill's. I go to Raskill's. Dina Cole hits the stage and he can't get a word out. It's literally like when a pro wrestler grabs the mic and he can't talk because they're still screaming. Yeah. Like when they lower the mic. But they're on Dina Cole's side. Yeah. But it's like when the bad wrestler wants to speak and everyone's just going ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape. And then finally like literally four minutes Dina Cole's just standing there smirking and they just go, so what did you guys do today? The place goes bananas. People have signs. It's like the front row at WCW. They got ONA. They got SX signs. They got JK Fat Guy's ass. They got Marco and they got a bull eye on some guy's ass. The shelf life of the Marco thing. This has got to be bad news by now. Yeah, right? I think like last night was when you actually take the milk out and it is the day of the exploration. Can you use it anyway? It smells good. It smells all right, but even though it says to sit. Yeah, it's not lumpy when I put it in the coffee. It's got to be good. No, it's all right. It's got a cheese then. The show is great. Tonight, Stephen Lynch is going to come down and Corbett is coming down. Which rascal is it? West Orange? West Orange, yeah. I'm assuming. But more importantly, first of all, I'm gay because I have blonde hair. Is that guy Russian now? Yeah, I didn't get that either. He goes, I saw J. Moore. He really is gay. His hair is blonde. Woo, yeah. I got smoke coming out of my ass. I'm so gay. That's a large gay population. I have a leather pinata in my living room. I have an aquarium. It's filled with pink fish. Hey, I heard Shecky Green do that leather pinata line way back. Three times last night after a bit, as there had been the applause, I'd go, I stole that. That's the place it's gone up. Jay, let me put this on the record. I've been doing radio since I was 18. Best radio show I've ever been involved with yesterday. Yeah, that was something. I heard you say that earlier, and you know what? It flattered me the most. Go ahead. Second place, I was involved with also. Yes, the homeless shopping spree. We've got to do a homeless casino. That's going to be the best thing ever. I'll have to do that. You've got to be prepared to leave in cuffs. We're going to do that in the summertime, yes. You guys, I think maybe Friday, when I have nothing to plug, Friday, let's get everybody together again. Let's go out. Let's go out, yeah, totally, but let's get these guys in the studio again. Oh, really? No. Yeah. I think at this point we need the after-fight party. We need the swimming pool and the chicks. The lesbian kiddie pool needs to come out of hiding. Yeah. We'll get some girls in here to beat the crap out of each other. I said, I'll fight any chick in here. I met some chick in the front row, gigantic hands that went, wow. I was like, I'll fight any chick in here. It's not that exciting to fight me. What was going on with your manager who showed up very concerned late in the festivities? He seemed like he was really mad at Antoni. Oh, yeah. My manager and my agent were like, I was talking to my agent last night. He said he went up to Anthony and he was like, you call this comedy? This is comedy? For your little ratings? You let this go on for your little ratings? He was all pissed off and I kind of took offense to that because he's going, he's like, it was good for your ratings though, right? It's good for your ratings though, right? It's like, Jesus Christ. He just thought I was going to, he didn't know who was who and it was just a melee of big bodies. At that point you can't stop it. You've got to let it play out. First he was screaming at Anthony. He said, you little ratings? You proud of yourself? You little ratings? Are you coming? First of all, he wasn't screaming. Secondly, he didn't understand what the hell was going on because I was the one that was keeping, trying to keep people from actually punching each other. The ratings would have been, oh yeah, that would have been great if somebody would have bled, but it wouldn't have been very, very nice here in the studio. And then he demanded to talk to the general manager. What's up with him? The general manager was busy with other problems. In the case you never? Yeah. Don't even mention what you want to mention because we're in hot water. Oh man. Yeah. It is like Manson's parole hearing. Yeah, it really is. Hey man, I'm everywhere. I'm on the 405. I'm in the San Diego Zoo. Nixon was just kidding, man. Hey, who you stole that from? I stole that from Adam Sandler. It was a sketch he did when he imitated Manson. Very good. I did just steal those lines out of the mouth of a sketch. Wow. Yeah. But that's actually what Manson said. I mean, Sandler was saying what Manson said during a sketch, but I would not have remembered it had I not seen Sandler do the sketch. All right. At least you learned something from yesterday's show, Jack. Paul Bonds. I thought Paul Bonds was going to cry at the end of that show. Yeah, there was something going on there where I think he was starting to regret. It was starting to sink in that, you know, the last appearance on the Anthony show. He broke up, you know. Oh really? The two of them broke up. How do you know? Because Deena Cola called me and told me. How does Deena Cola know? Deena Cola and Paul Bonds called Deena Cola and said the two of them split up. Wow. Well, you guys don't see that. That's like big news. Well, it's not exactly a Lenin and McCartney. Wouldn't worry about it. Andy Kindler. Abedin Castellamayor. Andy Kindler. One more time. Andy Kindler has a joke. Because everyone thinks the Beatles broke up because of Yoko Ono. He goes, no, I think the Beatles broke up when Paul McCartney came downstairs and went, hey, gentlemen, how about this? Oh, bleep dee, oh, bleep dee. Oh, you know Paul enough. I can't take it anymore. Wow, J. Moore. Terrific. Andy Kindler. Oh, oh really? Andy Kindler. That's a joke I wish I wrote, but I did not. It was a joke that Andy Kindler wrote. Very funny young man. About five foot seven, brown hair. Yeah, give it to the script. Glances. About to plug his head. Saving Los Angeles. Another guy could confirm the breakup of the comedy team of Billy and Paul. Wow. Some guy, John, that's what Sude has to say. John, what's going on? Hey guys, well here's what I got at least anyway. Airsick.net is now offline. There's a note from Billy on there saying that it's being revised. They're probably taking your links off of there and stuff. That's all right. And please stay tuned for this great new website. You already took the Airsick link off the unofficial website. It only has one and a half million hits. So it's sounding more and more like it. Hey Jay, excellent job yesterday. Thank you. I wish to God I could have come and had you back for you. I wish you were there to take my bucks cap. Well, I would definitely give it back. I'll tell you what, marketing terms, if one person is thinking something and 50,000 people are thinking it, I'm thinking I want to come out swinging as soon as I see this guy on the street. No, he can't do that. No, he lost bad yesterday. He's in his own hell right now I think. I suppose that's true. I wouldn't worry about it. It just got me so revved up listening to that yesterday. Well, if anybody cares, I'd really like a bucks cap. I like the bucks. I like the Knicks. I just dig the bucks cap with that big pinpoint deer on the front of it. You know how many bucks hats you're going to get now? You know how many people are going to throw caps on stage at Rascals and West Orange tonight? I love $20 bills. I stole that from no one. You are the greatest, most original comic I've ever heard in my life, J. Moore. I know it and thank you. And someone just for a goof throw a blue boy on stage tonight at Rascals. Blue boy? You're cross-dressing the magazine on the front row. Here's the bit for tonight's show with J. Moore. Bring stuff to throw on stage tonight. No, don't throw it out. The guy's trying to do his ass. Not throw at J, but just make sure it gets to the stage. Just hand it to your fellow opiate Anthony Lester. I'm telling you, I know what it is. If someone's going to throw one, they're going to get a little car. I have to admit, J, I've been walking around doing a really bad Christopher Walk in these past few months. I promise I will never do it again. Stay at it, my friend. Stay the course, young Jedi. You're ripping off J. Who goes around comes around, I guess. That's right. No one will know. No one will know. Where goes John? If you encourage people to throw stuff on stage, someone's going to get it. I didn't say throw. I didn't say throw. Just kind of get stuff on stage. Not everyone's sitting right by the stage. If someone's going to toss it, and I'm telling you rascals, God bless them, the security there is tight, man. If someone tosses something on stage, I'm telling you right now they're getting yanked by the time that thing lands. They'll be wrestled to the ground like Mark David Chapman. Oh, yeah. They'll just be wrestled to the ground. By the time that thing lands, they're yanked out of their seats. Listen to me. Don't tell anything. Even if it's just for fun, do you want to show me something? Just pass it. Tell a friend. You'll get yanked. Yeah, just kind of, whatever. Hold it up. Be cool, right. Yes, I have the air sick side up due to certain changes within air sick productions. Really? The site is temporarily unavailable. Paul Bond called Mike DeNicola. Wow. This is like a WWF saga. Yeah, it really is. What did Nicola say? Like two good wrestlers going pan? More like when Jimmy Snuka turned evil and you were all pissed off? More like when Chief J Strongbow went... Hey, like Chief J? How could I get? Yeah, when he went... What about Jules? When he went against Bruno, I believe, right? Well, you're a little older than me. Come on. I'm going Morocco Snuka. That's pretty good. I'm talking more like Ernie Ladd, Ivan Putsky. Ivan Putsky, the Polish hammer. That's right. Haystacks Calhoun. That's what the heck I look like. You're more like the Hillbilly Jim. Me? Yeah. I'm going to Guerrero, brothers. Guerrero, brothers? Uh-oh. Last night my intro was Ann Middlewhite, champion of the O.B. and Anthony show. And then went on to the team for Rocky. Hey, how you doing? I was thinking that. That would be a good entrance. How did Jeff Norris do last night? He killed. Really? Because I just saw his face outside the studio. Get Jeff to say hi to J real quick. Jeff Norris destroyed last night. Karate guy, man. Would you even attempt to F with this guy? No. Jeff was the only one that... Jeff took the worst punch yesterday. I know. This guy is dead. The national judo champion. The brick S house. There's Jeff. What's up? Hey, what's up? Jeff Norris, grab that mic over there. Let's see your ear. Oh, it's still swollen. I'm going to the doctor today to get it drained. Drained? It's cauliflower, man. I got more cauliflower in here than a fat bastard got in his refrigerator. Oh, my God. I'm going to the doctor today to get it drained. Drained? It's cauliflower, man. I got more cauliflower in here than a fat bastard got in his refrigerator. Oh, my God. He's got to get his ear drained, man. That one's good. Go ahead. Drained? Yeah. What do they pull out of there? They stick a needle in it and they got to drain the fluid out. Fluid. Yeah. I think he's not picking for another couple days. Hey, Jay, what's up, man? How you doing, Jeff? Great job last night. You were excellent. It was a real pleasure. Thank you. Look at that, huh? See? It was beautiful. Comics getting along. It's a beautiful thing. I had a great time last night. Jay destroyed. Jay, I got your bucks, Cap, man. I'm going to the doctor today to get it drained. I'm going to the doctor today to get it drained. I swear to God, it's in my trunk. Really? Yes, I do. Well, you know what? It's fine with me. I do. It's not a gay thing, people. It's just a token of my appreciation for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime last night. I told you last night on stage, somebody said, we're Marco Gay. Something. I go, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'll be like, oh, be an Anthony. Me, Steven Lynch, we'll just get all the cavalry together and sell out like a $10,000 worth of stuff. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. I'm going to sell out the offensive. Hey, for that guy who called before who got your hat, he's a lying little... Can I say prick? Yeah. He's a lying little prick because I was standing right next to Jay and he threw some massive shots. He threw some... That was about as fake as nothing. That was true blue. Well, I learned a very valuable lesson yesterday. Yeah. Don't ever hit a fat guy in the stomach. Jay, you got to come down to judo school and sign up. Yeah, I might as well. Do you know Jeff's credentials? Yeah. He's a national judo champion. Yeah. He's kicked some serious ass in his day. Look at his arms. Who cares what he's done? I know. He's got these huge arms and then he's got karate tattoos. If you're making the commitment that you're going to tattoo karate stuff on your arms, you better be able to kick some ass. Sure. That'd be really funny to have a skinny guy like just a weakling guy walking around with all the karate tattoos. Yes, yes, yes. Karate tattoo. There's a skinny white guy on your plan that gets a Peck-A-Wood tattoo to his neck and then a Nazi thing on his back so nobody bothers him. He's skinny but he must be crazy. He's got Peck-A-Wood on his neck. All right, Jay, calm down. You're taking over the show again. Sorry. We don't need that. We don't need people laughing. Oh my God. I am sorry. We don't need people laughing because you're taking over the show. Another day of a gay more, I guess. I didn't know Jay Moore was gay. I didn't know he had blonde hair. Yeah, I got blonde hair. I swear to God, we're going to sell out. Well, you're a fag, right? Well, I'm gay on Tuesday. I'm not sure. I'm not real blonde. I'm dirty blonde. That's just Tuesday and Thursday gay. We're going to sell out the Beacon Theater and I'm just going to bang my wife for an hour and a half. Yeah, I like the idea. Can you know what will happen? At the end of the show, people will come up and go, hey, that was a great bang, you fag. You know, it was way better, but it was fake. I wasn't really stroking. Hey, can I bang your wife too? Sure. What a guy. Now, that's a friend. He can be sloppy 70 seconds. Oh my God. We'll pick straws. See who gets to go first. I go first. All right. I want to have you animals in there first. Unbelievable. People. Well, I'm telling you, I just said that on stage last night. I said that's all I have to do to prove I'm gay. And then people still won't believe it. Let's get Buddy Hackett to start the festivities. Well, I'll drop the flag, Scott's screwing. Well, he's a nice girl, but rest assured, he's more penis than potatoes. Buddy Hackett came out in the act last night. Excellent. I thought he was there. I swear to God, he was in the bathroom. I'm like, Holy Christ, Buddy's here. You ever hear that joke? Jay's mouth is on the side of his face by his ear doing Buddy Hackett. I was dying. The joke, you guys, is this guy goes to the doctor's office, he's got a lump in his forehead. You got to do it like Buddy Hackett. Well, I'm glad you're here. You got to do it like Buddy Hackett. Well, I got to go to the doctor's office because he's got a lump in his head. It looks a little bit like a coma and he's nervous. So, I'm going to the doctor's office. And the doctor says in all my years of medical school, 44 years to be exact, I've only seen this once before. It's not a coma. What this is is you actually have a penis growing out of your forehead. And the guy goes, What? He goes, Yeah, and over the course of time, it'll be just like you're going to adolescence. Three, four years from now, you'll have a regular-sized penis hanging off your forehead. It's really remarkable, actually. It's only happened once before in my entire medical history. The guy says, Well, cut it out. You got to cut it off. My head, you can't cut it off. Can't cut it off. It's attached to the frontal lobe of your brain. And the brain stem, if I cut it off, it'll drop dead right on the floor in a pile of bone. You won't even feel anything if it drops right there. Can't cut it off. The guy goes, Well, what the hell am I going to do? Every day I got to look in the mirror and see a penis growing out of my forehead. The doctor says, You won't have to worry about that. He says, Why not? He says, Because your balls will cover your eyes. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. On this show, I don't care what anyone says. Jeff, I'm glad you have our back. All the time. That's nice to have somebody with that Kung Fu crap. I was going to bitch yesterday with Paul and Fatboy up here. I could have said, I was the first guest ever. Where's my N.E.W. jacket? Yeah, right? We're handing out memorabilia. That was nuts. We don't need someone like Jeff Norris turning against us. No, man. That would be a bad thing. I'm going to sign up with Jay's bodyguard. Oh yeah? Big Billy, I think his name is Billy and Kevin. Man, I tell you. You would frighten me. I would just run as fast as I could. I'd just run screaming like a woman. Running away. That's me. Just running as fast as I could. I wouldn't care who was watching. It would be like girls watching. I have to stand up for myself. I have to stand up for myself. I have to stand up for myself in front of a crowd of people. But Jeff comes up and wants to kick my ass. I'm running away. Let's take a break. I just cleared the phones. If I hung up on you, I apologize. But we have to give away some wrestling tickets, okay? The winner receives a three-pack of tickets to the WWF event at the Garden. April 15th. We'll take the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027. It's Kevlar kind of day. 1027 WNEW. Anthony Paizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy there. Our favorite Italian restaurant. Why? Because, well, because we eat there for free. No, come on. You don't think Joey's going to turn on the show, do you? That's another guy we don't want turning on the show. No, we love Joey. Joey treats us great and we can't wait to see him. We're going to be there. We're going to be there. We're going to be there. Joey treats us great and we go down to Paizano. You've got to go down there. If you're in Little Italy, you need a great Italian food at reasonable prices. A lot of people have turned on the show, right, Anthony? Yeah, I know, but not Joey. Tara, Spike, Billy and Paul now. Joey is a loyal guy. And we are loyal to Joey. And Joey won't turn on us, right? No, I'm positive of that. He's okay. You want great Italian food? Oh, yeah. Nice Italian atmosphere. Great place to take a date. The family. And don't forget about their incredible pasta lunch specials. Look at this. All the time we've been talking about Paizano, I'm thinking like dinner. You go down there, dinner. Maybe, you know, it's late at night. Take the girl down there or something. How about their lunch specials? Incredible pasta lunch specials. And they're huge. You take them home with you. Have that for dinner. Also ask for Joey. Tell him, hey man, Opie and Anthony sent us to your fine restaurant. And Joey's going to give you a glass of wine in the house, okay? Right. And speaking of wine, Paizano's got a fantastic wine list. They really do. I've tried just about every bottle he has. He's staggered out of the door a couple of times. Paizano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. Give Joey and the gang a call. 965-1188. That's 965-1188. The Opie and Anthony show. Drone men jumping all over each other. Okay, terrific. 107-WNEW. We're marching. March into victory. Fight, fight, fight. Know what I like about our listeners? What? You said it in the back office, Anthony. Yeah. Our listeners love and want to fight. They love a good battle. They love a good battle. As we all do. As we all do. Whoa, Stone Temple Pilots on TRL. TRL, yeah. Cool, man. They didn't show up at Rascals. I think Baby J was lying. Don't put that. Scott Weiner looks great. He has J's bucks, Cap. There's the band. Wow, the first real band TRL has had on. Right? Yeah, you can tell because it's not like 100 screaming teeny boppers. Everything's sink. Oh. The grease. Oh. Rob's wearing the same jacket from the plane. Yeah, he is. That's what he was wearing when we were coming back from LA. Yes. We definitely got to get into other things today. We have lots to talk about. D'Arver Conger. Yeah, she's officially single again. She's getting her annulment. Who cares? She's a total media whore. She's a chick from Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire or whatever. She's now officially divorced. That story's ancient. Gone. There's a big piece of paper, sorry. Huge. Huge piece of paper. All the newspapers are calling us about the J incident. Can't do it to our pal. We've got to ask him if we should talk about it to the press because they're all calling now. Oh yeah? Yeah. We'll get him on the phone. I think it would be cool if we just told the papers all these nasty rumors about J. Don't print them. I don't know, he's a lunatic. I think he's addicted to crack. He always carries a gun and waves it around. And in the middle of the interview he went in the bathroom with a little boy. Oh my God. And made him do crack. Guy's going to be in a hit movie. He told us on the side that he's in love with Kevin Spacey. Alright. Well what do you want to do? You want to play one of the entries in the most offensive song contest? I think we can do that. Yesterday we weren't in the most offensive song contest. The most offensive song contest? Still on here on the Opie and Anthony Show. And the goal of this contest is for us to find the most offensive song ever to be played on the radio. And let me tell you, we've had some real contenders. Oh wait, we have the Daily News calling back. Oh yeah? He doesn't want to talk to you guys on the air. Some of them. We have to. We're on the air. We're on the air. We're on the air. We're on the air. We're on the air. We're on the air. Pick her up where she's not on the air. You are. Stand pulled. Alright, well tell her, I don't know, tell her we'll talk to her during commercials or something. That's why we're called stupid. When we do things like... Stupid! You're so stupid! That's us. Opie and Anthony. Stupid radio. Alright, we're going to have to do this. Opie and Anthony, stupid radio. Alright, the most offensive song contest. Yeah, so we're looking for the most offensive song ever to air on any radio station anywhere. Correct. And we've had some real contenders. The KKK song. What was the other one? Camp Concentration? No, the Horny for Little Girl. That is so offensive. For Little Girls. Where is that song? That's so offensive. Whoa, look at Spaz go. He is fast. Oh my god, he's like a duck with those feet. Does this take pro wrestling classes or something? What did I see yesterday? That went away. So we have these offensive songs. We had a couple come in yesterday and today. Contenders, man. Now if anybody wants to complain about these songs, because there are a few people that are offended by these. We totally understand that. We totally understand because the essence of the contest is indeed to have the most offensive song on the radio. Right. So you're going to be offended. What can I say? That's what we're looking for. We don't condone what these songs are saying. We don't agree with their content. All we can say is yes, they are indeed offensive. We agree with you. And if you're going to have a most offensive song contest, you can't really sugar coat it. You can't. It has to be offensive. When we're listening to these songs in the back office, it's kind of painful. If we took an offensive song and said we can't air this because it's too offensive. Right. Well that's the contest. Well let's play our last entry from last week. Okay, which one was this? I'm horny for little girls. And then we're going to play right after that, a twofer. A twofer because it is from the same artist. It's an offensive twofer. Right? The one from Q? Yeah, from Q. So this is what Q said last week. And right after this we'll play the one that we got today. It's brand new. You've never heard it, okay? But I think I'm horny for little girls is worth one more play in the most offensive song contest. Is CBS going to intro this? No. Each time I see a little girl, eight or nine or ten, I can't resist the urge to stick my tongue inside of them. I'm horny for little girls. For little girls have hairless little tw*****s. Virgil. I'm horny for little girls. I get them high on alcohol and pot. That little butt so high so tight and shiny. Makes you want to smash your junk inside her a**. I'm horny for little girls. I want to bang them all, sometimes as young as one or two. And then I kill them when I am a fool. I'm horny for little girls. I tape their mouths and tie them to the wall. I'm horny for little girls. I bite them and I make them lick my b*****s. Their little nips so helpless and appealing. I want to slice them off and mount them on the ceiling. I'm horny for little girls. I'm horny for them all, no matter where, no matter who. Without them my old b*****s would be blue. I'm horny for little girls. I'm horny for little girls. Come sit on my lap little girl, I have some candy for you. Okay, terrific. I think it's up to 775 votes. The closest one after that is 500. The audience seems to be composed primarily of racists. Interesting. I wouldn't say that. Let's go to Doug before we get to Q's latest entry in the most offensive song contest. Hey guys, you guys got really beat up bad in an article today in the Daily Record in Morris County, New Jersey. I know, but this lady was screaming about you guys picking on the guy that couldn't get out of the chair at the Oscars. That's what she picked from our show to light about? I know, she's got almost a half page ad about it. Can you send the article into us? Do you want me to give you the webpage and you can look it up yourself? Yeah, go ahead. www.dailyrecord.com, page A11. Page A11? Yeah. Good chair. Oh, you hurt us by writing bad things about us in the paper. I don't think anything was ever written good about our show in the paper. Never. You looking that up? Trying. While you get to that, let's get to the latest entry in the most offensive song contest. It's another one from Q. Do we even know the name of this one? I know it's done to John Lennon's Imagine. Imagine. Oh, imagine there's no... Yeah, this is... like I said, I can't stress this enough. Look, this contest is getting way out of hand, man. I'm serious. It's getting harder and harder to start these songs every day. Can you read the title? No. Imagine there's no... Ouch. Yeah, yeah. Now, you've got to understand, again, I can't stress this enough. It is indeed the most offensive song contest. So what are we supposed to do? We're supposed to put the most offensive song in and in the office, listen to it, and go, Oh, my God, that's too offensive. That's like somebody in a race in the Olympics. On track. Saying, Oh, he's too fast. That's... we've got to take it. We've got to play it. It's the most offensive song. And Q makes fun of a lot of different people in this song. Yes. Just starts off really, really ugly. It's going to get much better from there. No. Oh, no. Come on, Ant. What? What? I'm losing my balls. This contest just sucks now. It was all cute and fun at first, but... Yeah, I know, but... All right, well, here we go. It's the latest entry in the most offensive song contest on the Opie and Anthony show. Another one by Q. Q. Imagine there's no... Check it out for yourself. Me, forget about. Imagine there's no freaking niggas. Imagine there ain't no freaking jiggle bulls, no bulling yans, and no spokes. There ain't no big scary doggies running around out there. And of course, no freaking Arabs, no English, no Spicks, and no freaking bulls. Imagine, lots of what freaking Italian. Every freaking way you go. What the hell, man? What is that? There seems to be something underneath it. What's going on? There's a commercial in the background. Is someone using the other studio? Who did that? Ah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Now there's hell to pay. Who did it? Someone screwed up. Who did it? Another fight today. Yeah. There's a commercial in the back of the song. That would not be good. Yeah. That would be a horrible, horrible thing. Horrible? Horrible, horrible, horrible. We're gonna have to re-record it. Oh, my God. Now we're gonna have to take a break, Anthony. What a cluster F. Come on. All right. We got the gist of it, though. No, it balanced out after that. That's why we need to play more of it. I know. Why, it gets worse? Well, he moves on to, like, just other groups. Just about every ethnic group. Your song is hilarious. We played 20 seconds of it. All right, we'll try to get the... get the problem figured out and we'll be back after this, OK? All right. Oh, be it, Anthony. All right. All right, we're back from a little commercial break there. Yeah. We had to do a quick interview with the... What, the Daily News? Daily News. Yeah. About the J. Moore incident. I have a feeling our names are gonna be all over the paper tomorrow on many different subjects. A couple of subjects, you think? Just a couple. Ah, but the lady from the Daily News really liked our quote. Yeah. Yeah. We're very quotable, Anthony. Well, you know what it is? I believe we give one of the most candid interviews you will ever, ever read. We don't care what we say. I wonder if she's gonna print what I said. I said, I think J. Moore is on crystal meth. And then she was a little shocked when I actually outed him as a child toucher. She's like, really? I'm like, well, yeah, we can't confirm it, but he does disappear a lot. My God. That's insane. Can I quote that? Yeah, why not? Quote that. Quote whatever the hell you want. He's gonna be performing at Chuck E. Cheese. Yeah, he's gonna be in the ball pit. Kids coming out on that little slide with their pants down. No, come on, we're kidding. Jesus Christ, why is everybody so sensitive? You had the best sarcastic quote for the Daily News, though. The film, Kevin Spacey, face. Oh, yes, yes. That's what I said. I said I never knew or expected J. Moore, a huge Hollywood star, who's gonna be starring in a movie with Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey. Because they love writing the stories. And then in bold print now she can put Kevin Spacey. So it'll catch your eye. What, Kevin Spacey? A fight? Kevin Spacey's name is coming up? You were surprised that... I was very surprised that... That he would put his pretty face in danger. Right. Knowing that he's filming this movie with the Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey. That's what I wanted to say before Rick rudely interrupted me with a piece of paper in front of my effing face. Jesus. Yeah, so I was very surprised that he would do that. And then she was trying to... She was saying, what started the actual brawl? She goes, what made Billy take his headphones off? I said, well, at one point I believe Billy used a derogatory term at J. J referring to him as some form of homosexual. I believe the word was faggot. At which point J turned to Billy and called him a big fat F. And I didn't say F, I used the real word O. If you notice. I wonder if they could print that in the Daily News. She was horrified. Horrified. She says, this is great stuff. These are quotable in Swank magazine. We told her it was like recess in seventh grade. It was. Insane. Out on the football field. Let's go. I was waiting outside too long. Where's J. Moore? I want to kick his ass. My brother Joe made his way into the studio. He was here yesterday. But you actually... Look at you. You got bumped yesterday. I came in with your song parody. I got bumped for a comic. For a comic. Right? Yeah, usually the comics get bumped. Usually the comics get bumped. So he got bumped yesterday. He had a most offensive song that he wants to add into the contest. Two. Two of them. Two. Two. Two. Let's just say he has one. He found an anonymous one. I don't know where it is. But it's not him. He wants to stress it. Look who we brought with him. Our pal, Cowbell Beale. Hey, Beale. You're a papadugget. You were in Florida, and we were playing... I was doing a little imitation of you. I think we got a little piece of that. Oh no. I'm going to stress it to Beale. Because you weren't here. Take a listen to this. Great. As Cowbell Beale says, If you pop the nugget and then go for a long walk, you get cranky ass. You know, it's like you had to really force out that last milk dud. And then you take a long walk, you're going to get cranky ass. Sometimes you don't know that little milk dud is still dang it. And you get up. Anything over about a quarter mile and you got cranky ass. You don't want cranky ass. You got to make sure you clean up. Get every little nugget out. I'm doing impressions of my pal. How do you feel? It's like somebody took a fistful of corn fakes and jammed them up bad. God damn. Cowbell Beale, very quotable himself. Yes, we should have had Bill on the interview. The pool rack filled with afro. I'll never forget that one. To describe a very hairy woman. Take the pool rack off the pool table, fill it with afro hair and shove it down there. He's a silly putty that fell on the barbershop floor. Oh, we got a ton of them. Got a million of them. Jeff Norris, you leaving us? We got someone else to beat up or something? No, he's got to get his ear from the fight. You got fluid in your ear? I ain't commenting on that. So who actually stuck their hand in your ear yesterday? Billy. A doctor's going to stick his hand in your ear. And now a doctor's going to poke you in your ear. That's what I'm saying, your ear. So a doctor's going to take his needle and shove it in your ear and suck out fluid. Jeff, yesterday I thought I saw blood coming out of your ear. Well, I did eat a Taco Bell, so that might be true. That might be true. Man, that was pretty good, man. Your ear is red. Everyone was yelling, hit the one in the middle. But it was three guys, it was Billy. It's like you got takeout cauliflower. Yeah, that's it. That's a huge, huge ear. You've been knocked in there before, right? This will be the fifth drainage of this year. Really? Oh yeah. Left one's a bad one. I hit my left ear. Why are you always getting knocked in the ear? In your ear. Well, it all started when I did a show in the East Village. Slammed in your ear again. Competition. Damn. All right. All right. Thank you, fellas. No problem, man. I'm going to plug Jay Moore. Jay Moore played rascals tonight. Yeah, you got to see him. Fucking Jay Moore. Who hasn't? You got to go to rascals. He's fabulous. Take care, fellas. Take care, guys. All right, Ant. We got the situation with Imagine. The song done by Q. I'm distracted because Jeff is saying his goodbyes. The latest entry in the Most Impressive Song Contest by Q, who is the author of I'm Horny for Little Girls. He gave us another entry today, Anthony. Really wants to win this contest. And we started the song, but there was some kind of either complaint call or a commercial in the background. Some type of glitch. So we had to stop the song. We figured out the problem. And now here we go again with Q's latest entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest, a very brutal song. We understand that. This is bad. This is really bad. OK. All right. Check it out for yourself and then call us up and tell us what you think. Me you forget about. Imagine there's no friggin niggas. Imagine they no friggin jiggables, no bull and yans and no spooks. They ain't no big scary docks running around out there. And of course, no friggin Arabs, no Hindus, no Spicks and no friggin books. Imagine nothing but friggin Italians. Every friggin way you go. Mon honor would be great, eh? Imagine there's no homos. I hate those little fudge packing Nancy Boy Bricks. Oh mon honor. Every time I see one, I want to beat him in the friggin head. You know what I mean? Then I'll rip his heart out, cut off his friggin little ****. Imagine all the fennukias on the road. Just dropping dead from a friggin ass. You know what? You might call me a scumbag. But I hate those friggin kind of people. You know what I mean? I'm gonna go upstairs and get a friggin shotgun. Yeah, I know a couple of mulling young fags who need to get whacked. Imagine there's no quirkens. And none of those three-legged little freaks running around the floor look like friggin chimps. Mon honor and I hate those god damn friggin handicapped parking spaces. I want to kill those god damn little wheelchair gips. Imagine taking all the repugs and send them out on the PQE. That would be a pretty sad act. But you know what? You may say I'm a scumbag. You might have heard me in the book, but I don't give a ****. You know what I mean? Because if this is me all, I'm gonna take a friggin shotgun. I'm gonna go out. I'm gonna whack me a couple of lesbian, midget, Mexican, overweight, fat wheelchair bitches. Oh man. Wow. The latest entry by Q of the Most Impressive Song of the Year. Oh my god. I was tearing up a minute there. What a touching little tune that is. Let me tell you something. You can hear the humor in the song. Oh really? It's very offensive. It's a little challenge. Oh it's very... Okay, terrific. It's offensive all right, but you don't hear the hatred like the KKK song. You know what I'm saying? Well let me tell you, you definitely laugh a little bit. The rave's coming in. Whoa, let's go to the song. If you felt a little shaking there, it was Lennon just doing heavy RPMs in his coffin. Let's go right to the phones. Gino, boy I wonder if Gino liked this song. Gino, what's up? Hey, it's freaking hilarious. Frickin... It makes the KKK song look like a nursery rhyme. All right, very good. Thank you Gino. All right. All right, let's go to Pete. Hey Pete. Pete, you're next on NAW. No, we lost Pete. Okay, let's go to Brian. Hey Brian, you're next on NAW. Hey guys, what's up? Hey Joe. Hey thanks. Listen, I want to nominate that song as the new national anthem. Oh my God. Come on, Yankees game, everybody stands up, ball with kidneys, it'd be great. How you doing? How you doing? Well that was truly an offensive song, I gotta tell you. And for the offensive song contest, what the hell? Hope it wins guys. All right, thank you Brian. Thank you. Let's see what James has to say about the song. James? Yo, what's up man? Hey what's up, you're on the air James. The national anthem rules. You like it huh? How do we get a copy of that? That song should be played every minute of the day. I don't know man. Every morning show, the end of your show, every minute of the show, that song should be played. Man, all the Italians checking in at the end today. Keep up the good work man. All right, bye. Bye bye. Let's go to Donna. Hey Donna, you're next on NAW, how are you? Absolutely loved that song, that was just, I'm driving in my car just laughing hysterically. Another Italian, then it can't be offensive. It can't be an offensive tune, everybody loves it. No, but it is offensive because at the end he wraps it up and just knocks everybody. Ah, there you go. You know, he made sure he covered all his bases. All right, except for the Italians. Well yeah, but just look how bad it makes us look, you know, we use the word friggin' as an adjective. I know. All right, there you go. And who knows, we don't friggin' do that. Very good Donna. Okay, you guys are great. Thank you. Bye bye. Oh, George thinks the song sucks. George? Yeah. Hey, what's up? What's up, man? You don't like the song? I hate that song. All right, which song would you vote for? You've probably heard most of them. Oh, come on, what you're cursing now. Friggin', friggin', sorry. What song would you vote for in the most offensive song contest? Damn, I forgot the name of it. Well, give us a hint, we know the songs. Oh, man. Welcome to Camp Concentrator. No? It's the... The KKK, man? Yeah, that's it, that's it. That is a brutal song. That one you just played really blew, man. All right, thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Gina. Gina! Yes, I thought this was the most offensive song contest. That song is the best. It's not offensive. That's beautiful. I agree with the last guy. It should be the national anthem. That is not offensive. Really? All right. I'm stunned. Thank you, Gina. Anything coming on in the instant feedback, Anthony? People loving... Loving the song. Most people... Most people really in favor of this song. All right. As number one. As number one. Oh, yeah. To beat out the KKK song. You know how it is, huh? When you first play them, people love it. Joe, what's going on? Hey, this is Joey Carpenter on Queen. The song is Off the Hinges. Off the hinges, huh? All right, indication now. Oh, yeah. Take care. Jennifer thought the song sucked. Jennifer, what's going on? Nothing. That song really, really blew. I mean, it's not too original to steal off the KKK song to go into all this racism stuff. Yeah? Yeah. So you're still voting for the KKK, man? Oh, absolutely. All right. It ruled. Thank you, Jennifer. You're welcome. Greatest song ever played. Let's see. And you're not reading just the good ones because you are indeed yourself Italian. What, me? Yeah. No. No. I'm an Italian and loved it. It was very offensive and it was f'ing great. All right. Holy crap. Even more offensive than the KKK, man. Okay. Thank God I'm Italian. Ding, ding, ding. We have a friggin' winner. Oh, you ain't heard nothing yet. That was awesome. Jay, what's going on? Hey, guys, listen. That song wasn't offensive at all. That was probably the funniest thing I've ever heard. Really? Yeah, but on your show, if you want to make it offensive, I stopped breathing during baby raper for five minutes in my car. I didn't take a breath. You know, baby raper is the best. I stopped breathing during that car. Baby raper is getting beat by the KKK, man. Oh, it can't be. I know. The KKK, man, was great. That was great, too. Baby raper, when you stop breathing during a song, you know it's offensive. All right. Thank you, Jay. Jim from New York City, that song rocks. I Want to Be Italian should be the new Sopranos theme song. Very good. Let's see, a bunch of people saying that the KKK song is still in the lead, Anthony. Seymour? Hey. What's up? Definitely KKK. Yeah? Yeah, definitely. That one's kicking butt. All right. Did you like the new one, though? Yeah, it's great. I agree with the last quote that it should be our national anthem. All right. Well, thank you. You're very welcome. All right, let's go to time. Jason from the Bronx, my buddy Alfonso, who's Italian, thinks it's the best thing he's heard in years. He's crying. It's so friggin' beautiful. Hey, Tom, what's up? Hey, what's up, O.J.? How are you? All right, listen, the KKK song is more offensive than anything. Yeah? The Italian song, that's just hysterical, but not as offensive as the KKK song. Really? It really is a funny song. The guy's delivery is classic. Yeah, it's in some way the best one. You may call me a scumbag. All right. All right, let's go to time. Jason from the Bronx, my buddy Alfonso, who's Italian, thinks it's the best thing he's heard in years. All right, guys, you guys rock. Syndication yesterday. Now we got two great entries from Q. Syndication never. Syndication, right, when Manson's paroled. Yeah, that's pretty much what's going to happen. Glenn, you're next on N.E.W. How are you? Oh, but you friggin' suck. That song sucked, guys. Really? He was like talking the whole time. It was supposed to be the most offensive song. It was offensive, but it wasn't really a song. That's why. I think it's between KKK and Killefetus. He wasn't even singing. It's the second entry. This guy bites off at something that's already been done. That's called rap. All right, Glenn, thank you. Bye-bye. Yo, he was rapping, man. Yeah, he was rapping. You may call me a scumbag. That's great. You gotta love the delivery. No matter what, man. Let's see, Kyle says KKK man's still in the lead. Kyle, what's up? Hey, KKK's song's so much better than that one. That one was nothing. It wasn't offensive at all. Right. Oh, yeah? All right. Thank you. I'm just reading some. I can't even read that one. Thank you, bro. Kyle. Lots of feedback. I can't wait, man. I'm getting butterflies in anticipation. Oh, yeah. Well, now you've got a song like that to follow. It's going to be a little rough. Ah, yeah. We do have Joe in the studio. Anthony's brother, he's got an entry for the most offensive song contest. Yes. We're going to play a little after 5 o'clock here. Okay. Hey, hello. Yeah, it's Skantel. I want to put that new song on British biscuits on the show. I do that. Yeah, imagine I'm a scum man. Gino. Hey, Vinny for president, and this should be his campaign song, bro. That was awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Another guy that thinks the song sucked, and then we'll move on here. Steve, what's up? How are you doing, guys? Listen, I'm Jewish and I feel offended. Oh, really? Yeah, I was left out. If you're Jewish, you might want to turn off the radio. Oh, well. For all of our Jewish friends. Turn off the radio. We did say we had three new songs today. That was only the first one. Hang in there, Josh. Yeah, for our Jewish friends. Listen, I'm a paramedic and the other day I got caught singing Baby Raper on the ambulance. Yeah, that's not good. Ouch. That's not good. That never works. All right, Steve. Syndication now, baby. Thank you. We're not diamond dust. All right. Time travel now. Let's go to Vinny. Might as well just say that. Vinny! Opiate Antony. Oh, no. Hello, friends. Hi, Vinny. That song goes down as a masterpiece along with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the statue David, Michelangelo, the classics. Vinny, that's awesome. That's awesome. That's what I want to find out. Did he write that piece? No, just a very enigmatic name, just Q wrote that song. I don't want to try, I don't want to say, I didn't want to bring this up, but you see what's going on down there in Miami, Miami, Cuba? Yes, with the... Yeah, these people down there, these Cubans have declared war on the United States. I say we go down there with F-15s and napalm, that whole damn place. It's a disgrace what these people are doing. Half of them, most of them are all illegal immigrants. They come over here and they say, oh, we're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them. They're going to get them.

I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. I'm going to get them. Yeah. And that took up all our delay. Yo, I thought J-Maw threw Fat Guy. You know the room, like in the lobby, you know the room with all the amplifiers and all that? You know, every time I go there, I'm like, yo, you got to hook me up with one of the asses. I thought J-Maw pushed Fat Guy into that room and blew up the station, yo. How weird was it when all of a sudden you're hearing a great fight and the next thing you know you hear, ain't talking about nothing. Yo, I'm like spaghetti, yo. Somebody died. Yeah. I had to check in periodically. I wanted to hear what was going on. I'm running in and out of this lady's house. I come out and I hear this song and I'm like, uh-oh. Yeah. That's never good. Yo, so Billy's an amigo, man? He just cut himself out of the mix, right? I don't know. He just dug his own grave. Yeah, because he had a legitimate beef, you know what I'm saying? Even though that Friday, you know? I kind of agree with a little with what he was saying, you know what I'm saying? But then afterwards, yo, instead of carrying on a good conversation and ironing everything out, yo, he flipped, you know? He did flip. He lost it. He flipped down. He just flipped, man. Yeah. And he was cool people, bro. He was all right, man. Well, that's kind of... What are you going to do, bro? That's kind of sad. Yo, where's Vinnie, man? Vin, I'm stalling, but it looks like Vinnie can't get through on the phone line. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. I'm stalling, man. Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.

Rockaway Bedding, the official provider of mattresses for me, Anthony, and Jay Moore, Hollywood outlaw. My punching fat guy. All right, give them a call. It's Rockaway Bedding, 1-800-TRY-A-BED. That's not as funny as a sinking school bus. I have a strong stomach. You guys made me bloat some stuff. Great. The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. ONA, my two new favorite hordes. You guys are really horrible. OPE and Anthony. What a couple of asswipes. 1027. WNEW. It's the OPE and Anthony show. Sitting in Cowbell Bell. Hey! And Anthony's brother Joe. Who contributed a lot of stuff to this fun radio show and never complained. Oh, OPE, you acknowledged me. Thank you. Hey, WNEW, we'll get Jay Moore in here to beat you up. That's right. I had him around the waist in the studio, man. I had like a cross-body block going on the guy when he was running that fat bastard there. In all seriousness, Joe has contributed more to this show than Billy and Paul put together and has never said a word. Yeah, I know. Never needed his time in the spotlight or anything. Well, not in front of you guys, anyway. Yeah, it fits like a mother behind our back. Oh, you should see what I hear. I can only imagine. A lot of reaction coming in from the latest entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest, Anthony. Yes. We're listening to your song, getting lots of reaction on the phone lines. Carl, what's up? Funny as hell, but it was not offensive. Was not offensive? Not even close. Well, it was veiled in comedy. Yeah, veiled in comedy, but that's not what the contest is about. I'm just saying it was very offensive, though. Look at what he's saying. It was funny as hell, but that's not the most offensive. It's offensive, but not the most offensive one. I put it this way. As a black guy, come on. It didn't bother me. Baby raping rules. Baby raping you like, huh? Oh, hands down. Original music, original lyrics, offensive. That's what you're looking for. All right. Well, that's going to be up to you guys in the end there. So right now, it looks like the KKK man is in the lead. Yeah, it was good. It was good. We have another week or so left in the contest as far as getting your entries in. So we'll see what we find in the mail in the coming days. Okay. All right, Carl. Okay. Thank you. You guys suck. All right, let's go to Jonathan, a black guy. It says it on the screen. Jonathan, what's going on? I just heard that song. Yeah. Made me laugh because not only did he make fun of the black guys, he made fun of everybody. That's right. But he just made fun of everybody just so he could get in making fun of the black guys. Well, I was actually torn between Can't Concentration and the KKK song. But I like this one. I think you should go with this one as your winner. He's not black. You sure you're black, Jonathan? Well, let's put it this way. As I tell my Uncle Tom, you put me next to three white guys. Trust me, the client won't have problems with me. I was expecting to hear your lips sound like two kickballs having a head on collision. Oh my God. Oh, he's going to ring the bell. Come on. Cowbell bell. Wow. What the hell is that about? Jonathan. Two kickballs. Jonathan, I personally apologize. That's a freaking retard, man. Guys, I went to one of six black kids in an all-white Catholic school. I think I've just about heard it all. I apologize. You have never heard two kickballs in a head on competition. That is a little weird. You have too much time on your hands, Cowbell Bell. Come up with stuff like that. All right, Jonathan, thank you. Thank you, guys. All right. Let's go to Valerie. Valerie. Hello. I'm still buying over that last one. The Q song, I think that song really blows. You sound like a tired Andrew Dice Clay over there. It doesn't compare to KKK. Hey, that's redundant. It really is. A tired Andrew Dice Clay. Yeah, come on. He wasn't making it with his own song. He had to go steal another theme. That's not fair. One entry per person. That's it. New rules. No, because we're getting our best entries from the people that are sending in more than one. I think Fuel has like 10 songs in the Contest. Q's up to two. Joe has a few in by the end of the day. By the way, I don't know what to do with those. Oh, after that line, Bill? All right, thank you, Valerie. I don't think there's anything in either of those songs worse than what you just said in about two seconds. Yeah, keep these shirts on. Ash, what's going on? Hi. Hi. Great. Valerie's totally wrong. Those guys can give you 100 entries. Oh, really? I think it's funny that the song is a riot. I almost drove my butt off the road listening to that song. Which one? The one done to John Lennon, Imagine? Yeah, Imagine. It's hysterical. All right. And it's funny and outrageous. All right. And offensive. All right, thank you. Okay. I think it might be in contention, Anthony. Yeah. I think so. It's holding its own right now. Hey, Kevin, what's up? Hey, what's up, Open Hand? How are you? All right. All right. I'm telling you, Baby Raper is most offensive. People love that Baby Raper song. I'm with you. I think that by far is the most offensive song, but it's losing in the voting right now to the KKK, man. It was so messed up, and Anthony was going so along with it and how demented it was. Yeah. It was just, you know, not only baby raping in the song, it was eating babies, how delicious they were. I know. That threw it over. It was just, that was it, man. All right. Thank you, Kevin. See you. One more call and we'll get to Joe's entry. John, what's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Two-week listeners, seven-time caller. Huh? Two-week listeners, seven-time caller. Show us how many listeners we have. I taped that song, and I'm going to be listening to it while I eat my spaghetti meatballs tonight. All right, John. Thank you. Very good. Peace. All right. Peace out. We always take one, two, three. One, two, many. Which one are you guys doing first? We'll probably do the... Well, let me point. Okay. Are you going to acknowledge that you wrote this song? Yes. Okay. Will you acknowledge that you wrote this song? I'll tell you why, yes. I'll acknowledge that I wrote it, but the standard disclaimer. Oh, really? This is the standard disclaimer, yeah. All right. I mean, you know. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. I don't know. When Anthony told me that I was permitted to send in a couple of entries... Yeah, we have no contest rules like employees and relatives. But when he told me, I just... We don't even know what the winner... I've put out all the stops. He gave me a mission and I'll complete it. We don't even know what the winner is going to get, so... Yeah, we don't have any prize or anything. All right, Anna. We'll probably get the opportunity to write a few more parodies for the Opie and Anthony show. Yeah. I'll win anyway. All right. Well, let's play Joe's entry, Anna. All right. Which one are we going to start with? The one he wrote? I think you should start with Pearl Jam Necklace. Pearl Jam? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A song called... Oh, God. Just play it. This contest is just getting painful. All right. Here's Anthony's brother, Joe. His entry in the most offensive song contest. Right. Self-explanatory. I know it gets restless, so I violate my little girl's 10 years of love. My little girl's tender, a young girl, five or six, definitely creep you best son. And while her mother sleeps, I know it's kind of underhanded. She gets me around. So I stuck in and stroked her hair with my toes, then pulled down her under-roos. Just called my daughter. It felt good. It says it's best. It's all right with me. Just called my daughter. It felt good. It says it's best. It feels fine to me. Just called my daughter. Okay, terrific. Yes, ma'am. Virgin. Yes, ma'am. Virgin. Okay, terrific. I hold my hand over my heart and I take a prop in my hand. Give me. Give me. Virgin. Just called my daughter. It felt good. It says it's best. It's all right with me. Just called my daughter. It feels good. It says it's best. It feels fine to me. Just called my daughter. It feels fine to me. It feels fine to me. It feels fine to me. It feels fine to me. Rusty Trump. Oh, my Lord. Rusty Trump. Oh, it's a finish that's just like the real thing. Oh, yeah, just like it. You're listening. Wow. Oh, yeah, that'll put it right over the top, the end. Oh, wow, well, the review's coming in on the instant feedback. Eddie Vedder, eat your heart out. Joe should make a video and send it to the Benet Ramsey family. James on line eight says that you're ripping off Baby Rape. Oh, James, what's up? Yeah, hi, guys. Yeah, I'm not exactly rip off. The song's okay. Don't misunderstand me. But to me, all the songs in the contest are just copies of themselves. KKK Man and the last one, they're pretty close. This one and Baby Rape are pretty close. I mean, there needs to be a little more originality here. I put a subtle twist on it. Instead of just any baby, it's your daughter, you see. That's the difference. It's incest, man. All right. Well, thank you. Look at him justifying his song. Thank you, James. Yeah, hold on, guys. I just wanted to thank you. I won the tickets yesterday. Oh, cool. Congratulations. Okay, thanks. All right, man. Bye. Okay, horrific. Yeah, just found a winner. Rob, Rob, what's going on? I definitely think you guys just found a winner. I'm on my way to the YMCA to pick up my six-year-old. And I'm listening to this song and I'm like, my Lord, this is a sick bastard. I'll pick her up. And if I was you, you know, just deny the whole DNA thing. He's not really your brother. You guys are great. You guys suck. Well, Tom on line four says the guy singing is more offensive. Let's go to Simon. Simon, what's up? I almost threw up driving down the road. Oh, yeah. That is a wonderful song. That one wins, hands down. I don't think I can handle this contest anymore. Oh, the adulation. Oh, my God. Take it easy, guys. Thank you, Simon. We have Fox News on the line. We've got to get to them in a second. Oh, we do? Jeff, what's up? This song wins. Really? This song out. Underoos? Yes, very clever use of the underoos, John. That is a good job. Very good job. Good graphic and descriptive. Thank you. Who rhymes underoos in a song? John, Joe. Thank you, Jeff. Over and out, Simon. All right. Let's go to Bob. Bob, what's up? Oh, man. Wait a minute. Let me wipe my mouth. I just got some puking. Hold on. You guys, I'll tell you. I drive a rig for a living and I go all over the country. It's good to get back here to listen to you guys because you guys rock. I'll tell you what. I haven't heard the last couple ones except for today and that is by far the worst thing I've ever heard in my life. Wow. It's just the criteria. It's the most impressive song. That's got to be a winner by far. Thank you, Bob. You guys rock. All right. Let's go to Andrew. Tell the Fox guy we'll get to him in a second. Andrew, what's up? That is the worst thing I have ever heard in my life. That one's just like Bay Rapers except it's got to be at least ten times worse. All right. I just want to let you guys know, anyone out there who wants to take my title for a song called, I see I'm not really good with lyrics or anything, called God is a Fag. Oh, wow. Well, that's the one angle that hasn't really been tackled. How about that? Really. All right. Over and out. Thank you, Andrew. All right, let's ... Good. Our interviews with the media continue. Yeah. What is this about? It's about the J. Moore fight. Yeah. All right. I'm going to call the line. I believe we have Kevin from Fox News. Kevin. What it is, O.N.A. Hey. How are you, Kevin? How you doing? How you doing? Jeez. I don't know if I can have kids. That was pretty bad. Oh, my God. I'd like to thank everybody for calling in and also thank my wife and my three daughters. Oh, I got to tell you, my brother Joe was adopted, so it has nothing to do with the family bloodline or anything. And for the love of God, do not talk about that on Fox News. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. Let's get to the reason why you called. Yeah. We were calling because I was listening to the show the other day. I was supposed to go out running. I was sitting there for an hour and a half glued to the radio. I'm like, who's dead? I couldn't believe it. It was great. That had to be 30, 40 minutes of the best radio I've ever heard in my life. Thank you. So I went in and I told the producer about it and he was like, yeah, let's see if we can get some tape. So I called up to see if you guys had any video or audio of the brawl that you could send us. Oh, video. Yeah. Well, we just might have some video. This, of course, is Jay Moore, the actor who will be starring in a movie with Kevin Spacey, Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey. Don't forget Helen Hunt and the little kid from Sixth Sense. Right. Now, will there be a love scene with Kevin Spacey and Jay Moore, though, is the question. On camera or off? Exactly right. I've got to tell you though, Jay Moore has been to the Fox News studio for a morning show with a bunch of the guys there, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade. Yeah. I think it was Brian who challenged him to a wrestling match because he said, hey, Jay, I hear you wrestle. And Jay's like, yeah. The two of them went at it and Jay's fast. I've seen him fight. He's really good. I was like, I didn't buy anything Billy was saying the other day about laying a glove on him. Yeah. It was scary. I had a wrestling match with Jay at one point in the studio and he just like wrapped me up. I was done. It lasted three seconds. As a pro, he takes his money and goes to the high school he used to go to and buys a match. Yeah. It stands around. I think it's just so we can watch young boys touch each other. It could be that. But it sounds noble. It's a piece of action. That has something to do with it I'm sure. By the way, Kevin, before we go any further, we want to thank you for being good sports about the whole wow thing. You're the only TV station that has been good sports about getting wowed. Absolutely. Because I think there's no ... If you're going to do stuff like that, it's going to be on camera. It's funny. Fox has always been that way anyway. We're not like a lot of the other networks where everyone's going to start and you get shoved off the air by a producer or something that's on the scene. Yeah. A lot of the other TV stations show up tight. They have the reporters on top of the live trucks now so no one can get to them. When I use that, an NBC just sends out Roker out there and they just sit on him. Yeah. He blocks the view. You don't know if there's any wow signs behind him. Exactly. So what tape do we got? We got tape, right? Yeah. We have lots of tape. We have good tape. Can you send it to us? Is that cool? That's, I guess, the question. Well, we're waiting for Access Hollywood to call us back. Access Hollywood. Access Hollywood. Access Hollywood. We'll go lunch. There you go. But yeah, we thought it was great though. So I told my producer, his name is Rick as well, and you guys want to get in touch with him about hooking up or something like that because ... Paul did actually have to dump out of that. Oh, couldn't say that name. That's right. I forgot about that. We are in so much trouble. That name's not allowed. It is ridiculous. The amount of trouble we are in. I got you. And our listeners ... Hey, look, we just got a memo. Yeah, okay. Actually, the memo, I just hit the dump button and a memo fell into my hand. We are not allowed to F with that situation. Jesus Christ. I won't even ask about it. Forget it. Well, off you go. All right, cool. Amen. Yeah, so yeah, we could hook you up, Kev. That would be fantastic. Rick will get Rick's number. That's right. You're Rick. And we'll hook something up. All right. When are you guys planning on doing something with this? We're publicity whores, so we wouldn't mind. Well, it's one of those things where I'm hearing it, so I make a pitch and then they take it and run with it from there. I just think that you guys are great, so it's worth doing a story as far as I'm concerned. Oh, cool. Thanks. All right, hold on a line. Let's have Rick talk to you and see what we can work out. Okay, you guys are great. Thanks. There's Kevin from Fox News, everyone. We love Fox. Not an enemy of the show. No, no, they take the wowing very well. Like that NBC show, which is the one that was the really stuffy. Who was that? No, ABC. Was that ABC? Yeah. Good Morning America. Good Morning America. Oh. Yeah, they absolutely hate us. A bunch of uptight people. Fox has all those cool shows, too, all those like caught on tape things. Yeah. Yeah. When comics attack. You hear what Fox is working on? Still trying to do? They want to take a 747, get a couple of pilots in there, and then they're going to jump out and crash this thing into the desert. 747 crashing into the, with cameras on the inside, on the outside, chase planes. But they're having a problem with the FAA because you're not, you can't just say, hey, I want to crash a huge passenger plane into the desert. So they're trying to do some kind of ruse where they're saying it's to research structural integrity of the, what, the desert floor? I think we all know what's going to happen to this thing when it hits the ground. Forget about it. It's going to go Payne Stewart. What's going to happen to it? Payne Stewart. Yeah, what happens if they jump out? You put it in a dime, didn't you? No. Where's it going? LA. Oh, right. Maybe we'll put our own spaz right there. We'll strap them in. Hey, can I get a cocktail? Flight test dummy. No one hear me walk away from the wreckage. Okay. Where's my luggage? Spaz, you working on the weekend review? Yes, I am. All right. I forgot about that. Friday spaz is weekend review on the ONA show. Stacy, what's up? That's so long. Okay. Oh, yeah. Now we're back to Joe's song. All these songs make them laugh. I play them to torture my mother. I have a four-year-old and the whole thing I'm driving, all I could think is, number one, where do I pull over to puke? Number two, let me get home before my husband sees my daughter. And number three, don't ever let that man have kids. Because, oh my God, he's going to go to jail before this life gets better. Oh, this man won't have kids. Don't worry about it. Don't ever let him. That's disgusting. All right. Thank you, Stacy. I should see what he does to mine. Oh, man. I babysat Phil's kids one time. Oh, really? That's a whole other story. Wow. All right, listen. Are we going to get into the next song, the next entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest? Yes. It's also a twofer? Yeah. Yeah. Possibly. Possibly a twofer. This guy might sound like Joe. Okay. Wait a minute. I think on the way in, Joe found this CD laying on the side of the road, didn't you? And it just turned out to be an offensive song. This was first of all, the idea was planted in my head by Jim, a kid that I work with. Yeah, sure. He planted the idea in my head and I ran with it. I was only following orders. I'm still in here pretty much. All right. Let's take a quick break and we'll play another entry in the Most Offensive Song Contest. Wait till you get a load of this. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. This is a special one. Mrs. Edelbaum, now would be a good time to turn off your video. Okay, now. 1027 WNEW's new nighttime lineup. Pretty cool. It starts after Opie and Anthony at 7 with a Don and Mike show. Then at 11, check out two smartasses surfing the web. Most amusing. Ron and Fez.com. Right now on 1027 WNEW. Ah, yes, Anthony. Yeah, look at this. We got to welcome a brand new sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show. CarCat. We're talking about CarCat. Yes. This is a great idea. These guys, you know, selling a car is a pain in the ass. It really is. You got to take an ad out on the paper and then you don't know who's coming to your house. It could take months, years to sell your car. CarCat, they offer you top dollar for your cars. Don't even think of selling your car or trading it in. Before you check with the great people at CarCat, top dollar for your car. They'll buy any kind of car. New cars, fancy cars, bands, 4x4s, sport utility vehicles. If you can drive it, CarCat will buy it. This is the way to do it. They even buy leased or financed cars. Isn't that great? That is very great. Drive in, takes about 20 minutes. You could have an ad. We've all tried to sell cars in the paper. It is. It is a big hassle. It takes too long. It's a big pain. And then people get your phone number. They're calling it all hours. 20 minutes with CarCat. CarCat. You drive in, they take care of it. All the paperwork, everything. So if you've got a car that needs to be sold, yeah. What are you waiting for?

Once again, let's welcome CarCash to the O.B. and Anthony show. 1-800-CARCAT. We're looking for a few good enemas. What the hell are you talking about? O.B. and Anthony show. Crap, whiz and vomit. 1027-WNEW. All right, we're back. By the way, it is Whip from that Wednesday, but it's still early before we start really talking about that, right, Anthony? You know, it blows too. I'll tell you, we get back from L.A. the other day. It was like 85 degrees out there. I was on the beach. And I'm thinking, okay, it's April. It's shaping up here in New York also. I walked out the door today. Oh, and winter's back. A little chill in the air. A little nip. Well, we'll get into the warm weather soon. We've got the brand new WOW stickers on the way to be imprinted as we speak. If you send a self-addressed dance envelope, you can be one of the first on your block to own the new WOW sticker, Anthony. Yes, that address is WOW sticker, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York. 10106, I believe. Look at you. Not bad, huh? Rises courtesy of Spiegel Cadillac. Spiegel. Jay, what's up? What's up, guys? How are you? That song was disgusting. It's totally... Come on. This could be the most offensive phone call we've ever had. Yeah, I hung up on him. You're disgusting. That song was very disturbing, Anthony. One guy wants to lock you up, Joe, for that last song. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, I guess we could get into the next entry. Yes. This one taking a little different tack. We've noticed a lot of songs about ethnic backgrounds. Anthony, do you have a sister-in-law? Oh, let's say... Anthony has a sister-in-law. That would be Colleen. If it's... Oh, yeah, okay. She could have just said Joe's wife. All right, let's go to the phone here. Hello? Hi. Colleen? I did say Joe's wife. Hi, honey. You must be proud. Which I'm not going to be any longer, not after that song. Oh, Joe, let me start telling you about it. It's very expensive. I'm getting all of this stuff out on the front lawn. I did it down in the dungeon. She didn't hear it. Changing the locks. Colleen? The locks are a good thing to change, but then he could just break through the door and get his computer up and running. I got two still little dogs over here. Do it, Colleen. His breath smells like brownies. Oh, God. You guys. How can I face my family after that song? Oh, just wait until the next one. Yeah, this is good. Oh, God. You want to be able to drive near a synagogue after this next one. Okay, well, I'm going to turn off the radio now. That's a good idea. All right. Okay. I love you, Colleen. I'll see you later. Tell your friends. All right, thank you. Bye-bye. My lovely wife, Colleen. There you go. Speaking of facing the family, right after the show tonight, you're going to be on the show tonight, right? Yeah. I'm going to be facing the family right after the show tonight. I'm going to my brother's place, Baxter's Grill, Port Washington, for my grandma's 90th birthday. My whole family is going to be there. Okay. I know. I know. Just don't bring up any of this crap. Is she going to be dressed in like a prom dress? Is it going to be in a cute grandma dress? No, my grandma's still half in it, man. Yeah, at 85. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Are you just saying that because there are people that like... No. My grandma's 90 and she's got all her marbles and she's great and everything. Look at grandma sitting there and I look at the grandma and she's drooling. You know, there are certain grandmas that are still very up and alert and there are some that... Let's put it this way. My grandma who's 90 has a sister that is going to be 96. They still go to Atlantic City to gamble. Sweet. Okay. I swear to you. Does she go? I'm breaking out that med stuff in a second. She's on the bus. She goes on the bus to Atlantic City. She goes on the bus to Atlantic City to gamble. God, look at you. You ready to... Wow, she goes on the bus. I'm ready. Oh my God. And the Amalage. The instrument of death in her belly. Bombs for Tokyo. I'll break out that med bit so fast. I don't know what you're talking about. It's like an arms race around here. I didn't say anything. So I know the whole family is going to be there. They're going to look at me and say you're sick and twisted and demented. We all know that. So let's not even talk about it tonight. He going to these functions because they all... They're going to. They all look at me like what? You can always bring us and take the attention away from you. Yeah. Yeah. Joel will perform a song live. There you go. Hey, how old is she? She's going to be... She's 90 today, right? Yeah, 90 today. I wish a happy birthday to Buddy Epson yesterday. 92. 92. Yesterday. My grandma is in much better shape than Buddy Epson. Yeah. Should we play the well doggies? Do you have it over there? I don't think I have my well doggie. Oh, crap. I got to get the well doggie on this one. Here's the most recent well doggie we have like a year ago when he was 91. Yeah. He didn't sound too good. Here he is. Well doggie. You're going to lose it. You're going to lose it. Well doggie. He doesn't sound that good. Hey. Hey. Hey. You don't sound too good, dude. Well doggie. We got to call Buddy soon. Yeah. Granny Uncle Jed fell in the seaman pond. Well doggie. He sounds like a 14-4 modem, doesn't he? Well doggie. He does. Remember the handshake from when he was 14-4? Yeah. He signed on to American Online. Well doggie. Oh, and I can't. I just looked on to the mainframe of the CIA. And I do have my well doggie. Oh, good. My well doggie is when Buddy Epson turned 90. 90. Here's Buddy at 90. Well doggie. Wow. That's the well doggie we all know and love. Let's hear that again. Smooth. On his 90th birthday more or less. Buddy Epson. Well doggie. Yeah. And last year. Well doggie. We got to call him and get it from this year. We got to get it this year. I got to hear what he said. Wait, wait, wait. Rick. Sounded like he was doing shots of Drano in between those birthday. I think we have from this year. Here it is. If someone gets my book bag, I've got Buddy Epson's home number in my book bag, we can call him and get a brand new well doggie. I'd love to talk to Buddy. Really? We have the well doggie from his 90th birthday. Well doggie. And last year at 91. Well doggie. We got to get the third one. We got to get the third one. I have the number. They're running down to get the number. Come on, Buddy. We'll try to do that a little later this hour I guess. Yeah. All right. But in the meantime, Anthony, I believe it's time for another entry in the most offensive song contest. Yes. I don't know what else to say about this contest. I would say oy vey to this one. The opinions expressed in this next song do not necessarily reflect the views of, yeah, you know what I'm trying to say. Of this radio station, the Opium Anthony Show. Or Joe. Or Calville Bill. Or Brother Joe at Calville Bill. You wrote it. Oh man. I had nothing to do with this. Yes. See what happens just before these songs are played. Hey, only because. Everyone is like. Yeah, but it's because. Even the listeners like me. I listen to this one. The most offensive song. Right. This one, as far as I was concerned, I go for the jugular. If I do something, I go for the jugular. I go 100% right. Don't go at all, right? This one went for the jugular. If you thought the last one was offensive, it was nothing compared to this. Okay, terrific. Okay, horrific. Yeah. Virgin. Virgin. Okay. Okay. Let's get that uncomfortable feeling every time we have to play this one. Play a song. I know. It's just. My bunghole is popping. Coming. Coming. Coming. Is there anything you could say to make it a little smoother? All I can say is we have said in the past, this is the most offensive song contest. So what? How can a song be too offensive for the most offensive song contest? Let it ride. That's it. What's the name of this one? Wait until you get a load of this. It's called. It's called. Minefurer. Oh, Minefurer. Oh, Minefurer. Oh, my God. A little historical piece. It's some music right off the history. It was either Incest or the Holocaust and I did one on both of them. How about Incest and the Holocaust? There's an idea. Now you see I could have gone that route. Oh, that would have been offensive. All right. Here's the latest entry in the most offensive song contest. Can't wait for this one. Great. Here we go. Nine, zwei, drei, vier. Okay, good. Oh, Minefurer, build some ovens just to cook up Jews. We sweep them down and gas them good. Sold their clothes and shoes. With a big team here and a royal time is there. Here a type can enter a Jew, everywhere a dead Jew. Oh, Minefurer, build some ovens just to cook up Jews. Oh, Minefurer, vaunted lampshades. They don't even feel like we deal it. We put that hand to dry. We pour this through them ears. With an apple here and an apple there. Don't use skin with too much hair. Okay, okay, I can't take it anymore. We eat it lunched. They don't even feel. Oh, Minefurer, why did you not cook schwarzes and sticks? Oh, my God. You let them mongrels get their lazy meeks and wops and chinks. With an ach-tung here and a sig-heil there. Here a Jew's an Jew, everywhere a dead Jew. I'm not laughing. Here a man-fuer the needed parts just to cook some Jews. Dong-ga-shey. Oh, my God. I apologize. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I had a job to do. I had a job to do. Oh, my God. Dive, dive. There's some guy from the JDL down there asking for me. I don't know if I should come. Oh, my God. I don't know if I should leave yet. Oh, my God. Let the record state that Opie did not laugh during that song. Okay, terrific. Oh, my God. Why couldn't we have- Look, man, I was given a job to do and I did it. Why couldn't we have the Buddy Epson phone number? Oh, my God. Well, I'll tell you something. It could be the most offensive song I've ever heard in my life. It could be the most offensive song. It fits all the criteria. Hey, guys. Guys, that's it. That is the worst thing you have ever done. My grandparents who actually got toasted in those ovens are rolling in their grave. This is disgusting. That is the worst song. This is it. Please stop. You know, when I was singing Baby Raper at work and they told my wife about it, that was bad. But this is awful. For the love of God, we've got to stop the contest. Don't bring God into it, man. He ain't laughing this time. Someone's amazed that Joe was able to write a twisted Hitler polka song. I mean- He's going to get the 15th level of hell for this one, my friend. All right, David. Thank you. Uh-uh. Okay, you guys suck. Syndication forever. Yeah. That's how long it'll take. Oh my God, what have I done? Yes. Andrew. Yes. Hey, Andrew. Guys, I'm Jewish and I'm Cuban. Oh, no. Between this one and John, Cuban John, I'm about ready to go in there and pull a Columbine up in the- Yeah. So you're Cubish. Yes, I am. I'm very Cubish. Oh, my God. Once again, guys, I want to encourage anyone to write the song. God is a fag. All right. Now, let me tell you. I understand a lot of people are angry, but it is the most offensive song contest. Wow. Wow. Oh, my God. You can't read half of them, can you? See, I also played the numbers. Now, there's a very high Jewish population in New York City, so I figured the more people you offend- All right, Joe. I think we'll just turn your mic off. You've done enough damage. Nothing will ever compare- I don't want to talk anymore. Nothing will ever compare to that Hitler song. Okay. Done. That's what it says. I've done my job. Hands down winner. Oh, my God. Take some more calls, man. You've got a winner. That song is absolutely sick. This was horrible. Alex, what's up? I am shocked. I'm disgusted. I can't- I'm speechless. That has to be the worst song I've ever heard. I'm learning about the Holocaust in school right now. That taught me more in- how long was the song? 30 seconds? More than 30 seconds than I've learned in 12 years of Hebrew school education. Joe, you're worse than Hitler. I'm sorry, man. Joe, worse than Hitler. You can bring it into show and tell. Uh-oh. Is that the author of Camp Concentration calling in saying that Joe ripped them off? Oh, no. He's got to concede. Hey, what's going on, guys? Hey, Fuel. I just wanted to say I liked that song better when it was called Camp Concentration. Oh, look at a little rivalry going on here. And you made me wait like 10 seconds to get on Hall of I-Candice. I just can't do that. Hey, man, you want to fight? Come on down. It'll be pretty fun. No, I was going to come down today. But, you know, I didn't want to get another fight. Two fights, two days. Yeah, I know. Well, Fuel, it's kind of hard to write a Holocaust song without using some of those catchphrases, you know what I mean? Yeah, I feel like we need to go somewhere else with this thing now. Yeah, I understand. We're raping babies by the dozen now. I got to agree with you. Okay, terrific. Contest over. Did you guys get the last couple I sent in? I don't even know. Probably. I sent you one about digging up Jesus. Oh, man. Because my theory is if you're going to go through all the trouble to dig up Jesus, you may as well have sex with the body. You're the winner. No, I'm offended now. Without ever writing the tune. Now I'm offended. This contest is over. Yeah, we can't go on with this contest. I didn't think it would mutate into what it has. I thought it would be a fun little contest. We'll touch on some offensive songs. James, what's up? You hit me from earlier, guys. Yeah. Okay, so this is an interesting one. I need this to end. I can't take this anymore. Kyle Joe. This is it, man. It's painful. You're sitting in your car and you're thinking, should I listen to the next entry? It's just, I'm sweating over here. I can't take this anymore. I was playing basketball outside. I swear when I heard the first line, the ball traveled about a mile away. Oh, my God. Yeah. All right, thank you. Okay, so now, guys, bye. Mike, you're next on Indy W. What's up? Mike, I think that song's great. Great. All the lines must be going nuts with all the Jews complaining. That's all they need to know. I'm going to go to the next one. Mike, what's up? Mike, I think that song's great. Great. All the lines must be going nuts with all the Jews complaining. That's all they ever do. Well, look at this song. It was horrible. Here, boo. I didn't mean to hang up on him. What do you want him to do? Mike, you still there? Mike? Yeah. All right, you still there? Go ahead. It was 50 years ago. What are they still complaining about? All right, now you will hang up on him. Yeah, I got this. Get goofing on his great-uncle Adolf, you know? Adolf Hitler checking in, saying even I was offended by that. We have a war. We have a war. We have a war. We have a war. We have a war. We have a war. We have a war. Joe, what's up? Joe, you're going to hell in a hand basket. That's not the rules. But it was great. I got another question. Back to the first song, the ones about the niggers and stuff, if all niggers and Jews died and fell out the face of the earth, would it affect your ratings? Oh, my God. Unbelievable. I thought this would be fun and bring everyone together. An offensive song contest. We could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these bums and we could bring up these dated stereotypes and have a little fun with each other. But I'm seeing a lot of hatred here, Opie. Right out of my own brother. My God. No, no, no, no. I was given a job to do and I did it. It seems to be working. That's all. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hey, Noah, what's going on? What's up? I'm just hoping the song's not offensive. No? No? No, I think the KKK man was more offensive. All right. Thank you. You guys suck. All right, let's go to Tina. Tina, what's going on? Hey. Hey. You guys got a winner. That has got to be the most offensive song I've ever heard, even worse than the French guy. Oh, wow. Yeah. Not horny for little girls? Yeah, horny for little girls. What about the KKK song? The KKK song was bad, too, but... But this one's worse? Oh, my God. I called my boyfriend and told him to get out to the car and go listen to it. Thank you, Tina. Joe, I don't think you're a bad person. I think you were doing your job. That's very good. She gets it, see? Thank you, Tina. Thank you. No problem. How about this one? Matt checking in from my Glen Rock. No song needed for the last one. Fuel wins for spoken word. Yeah, right. It's like best spoken word offensive song. George, what's going on? Dude, Joe, I just chased three customers out of my business. No way. Guys, let me tell you something. I just had three Jews in my business paying for cars. They ain't never coming back. They ain't never coming back again. But I tell you something, I liked it. There you go. I liked it. Thank you. Syndication now, guys. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. No, don't... Let's see, Keith, hey, Ant, the excuse, but it's just the most offensive song contest isn't working anymore. I'm horrified. Yeah. You guys got some insight? This contest has got to end. Yeah. I guess we got to find a winner and I can't take it anymore. End this. I cannot take this anymore. Well, I just squeaked in under the wire, didn't I, guys? Oh, yeah. All right, there's a Jewish guy in the line. Evan. Yeah. What's up? How you doing? Hey. I just wanted to say I'm a Jewish kid and growing up all my life hearing about the Holocaust and to joke about it, it's extremely, extremely offensive. Yes. And definitely wins the contest, but I think if you go any further, you got World War III coming. Yeah. That's true. No, I ain't. Thank you. Uh-uh. No. Call me a pussy. We're not playing that again. B Miller's God. F guests, ah ah. Ah ah ah ah ah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 시� dessert We'll use your technique. You had to have how many black guys call in before you played the game. Well come on. You've got to have... You're so stupid! You've got to have 10 Jewish guys or 20 half Jews call in. Someone's got to make a stand, man. This contest is killing me. That contest is absolutely killing me. Joe, you can be proud in the fact that you've ended our contest. Oh man. Be proud. And hopefully, you haven't ended our careers. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy. Oh no! Oh my god. of contest. That's it. It's over, Jenny. It is over, Johnny. It ain't over. It ain't over. It ain't over until we got a song about the jinx. Alright, it's over, Jenny. Let's take a break, Anthony. Boy, thanks, Joe. You're welcome. I seem to have this effect on your radio show. No wonder you guys never hired me on it. Hey! Wow. It's a young cat. Any more instant feedback on that? Oh, yeah. Then my computer blew up. Phone's just going nuts. You mean it burns? You're pushing it, man. Yeah, stop. We're not going to keep our jobs for a while. Oh, my God. Alright, great. Okay. Okay, terrific. Okay, horrific. Oh, oh.

No. I'll put the Vulcan cannon on Psycho Mark. You know that's a gun? Yeah. I've seen those things fire. That's insane. When I was in the Army, I saw him work out of the side of a C-130. You have to see what it does to a football field. Here it is. The old days. New technology. Do you know how many shells there are? It covers a football field with shells no further than four inches apart from each other in like 20 seconds. Wow. That's how fast. And it's awesome to see. I mean, I saw it live. It's awesome. Psycho Mark, go on. Psycho Mark, put your pen down and your paper. Come on. Oh my God. Psycho Mark is out of freaking control. Leave the studio. You're so stupid. Is this real quick? Oh yeah. Go home, man. He's out of control. Psycho Mark has left the studio. Go back into your hole. Hello. How did you find out about Stacker 2? It's so obvious who was in the intense meetings today and who wasn't. I know. Yeah, Opie and I in meetings. Everyone else, no. Not in meetings. Not in meetings, obviously. They have no freaking clue what we went through today and are still going through. And you guys are just pushing it. Yeah. I'm a little joke. Yeah, a little joke, all right. Yeah, sure it is. So call me whatever you want, but man, that just ended the contest. It was screened, wasn't it? Whoo. You guys aren't directly responsible. I'll take full responsibility. So Ed, Mariah Carey. What a segue. Yeah. Well. Was she Jewish? We could talk to her. Psycho Mark is just laughing a little too hard, isn't he? What? A little too hard. All I can say is you didn't hear what we heard today. Oh, there it is. You'd be a little paranoid too. Mariah Carey canceled her shows. Let's see. Oh, Tuesday night at the Fleet Center in Boston. Right. She had food poisoning. Right. She sent it to Massachusetts General for dehydration. She ate some raw oysters in Atlanta and became seriously ill. Oh, my God. You know what happens when you eat raw bad oysters. I had some bad oysters, Stevie. You know what happened? That isn't like all of a sudden, you know, you're sneezing. You don't have the flu. Maybe you get a hive or two. That isn't where it ends. If they're talking about dehydration, that means she pretty much was dry heaving from both ends. Stereotypic. Sounds of Mariah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay, terrific. Oh, my God. How long does this go on? Oh, she's got a nice ass, huh? Oh, my God. Okay. Virgil. Bad oysters. How about that? Because like Tommy Mottola was throwing anthrax spores in our audience. Oh, my God. The concert will go on. Oh, yes, it'll make those days. Added sound effects. And a special light show. Man. Okay. Yeah. She's got a nice butt. A related story. Celine Dion has a yeast infection. It's on her head. Bake enough bread to feed all of Africa. She got a yeast infection in that camel toe. She's a survivor. Yes. I understand. I understand Mariah's pain. Let's go to Bill. Bill, what's up? Yeah, what's going on, fellas? Hey. I think that song is more, I think that Mariah montage is more offensive than Joe's song. I've been there, man. I know the pain. Yeah. Yeah, it's not fun. You don't know whether to jump off the ball to put your face over it or? No, you just got to lean over and do it into the bathtub. Oh, my God. All right. I never pictured her having cranky butt. Mariah Cramp. You'll be patient forever, fellas. Thank you. Looks like a monkey's ass now. A red mandarin's ass. Looks like a bad boy. Flipping back and forth there pulling 180s. Flip off the ball. Hot air balloon knot. That's pretty disgusting. Fully in Anthony. Stupid! You're so stupid! And EW. All right. Where's the Psycho Mark thing? We got to play that today, too. Oh, calm down, dude. Oh, it's on that one? It's on the other machine is what you're trying to say? Yeah. I have to do a transplant. All right. We didn't even get to talk about the opening day at Shea. Psycho Mark went there with like 100 of our listeners. Yeah. Completely wasted, it seems. We do have audio to prove that, Anthony. Yeah. Let me see. Blah, blah, blah. Oh, Johnny. Johnny's a faithful listener of the show. I was at the Mets opening day, seated in section 35E, right behind the Mets dugout. And we had the OK terrific sign in fluorescent pink with black letters and we were on TV. Channel 11 live right after Tom Terrific Seabird threw out the first pitch. The camera was on us for five seconds. We were also on Channel 12 News, CBS with WarnerWolf and NBC. I taped it. Very f'n cool. We had Chance going, high fives and lots more. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. And then we had the show. It was all over TV. We didn't even get to talk about it yesterday because we were so freaking busy with the J. Moore fat guy fight. Yeah. And I guess Johnny's going to bring down the sign and the tape because he's got footage of the OK terrific sign all over TV. So that's very cool. Yes. And Psycho Mark, how was J. Stadium opening day with a hundred of our listeners? I was there. Yeah. That's what we're hearing. Reports coming back, a very intoxicated Psycho Mark. We were, we had a great time. Yeah. I heard the seats were really high out. We were counting as Anthony said. I think it's on Elton 11. I think we waved to you when we flew over Shea Stadium on the way back from LA. Dude, I'm telling you. And that's where we're supposed to be. Yeah. One day one of those planes is going to be like, I'm sorry, we're losing power. Delta 635. Oh no, we're going down. They're going to go right through that stadium. Having the pitch high and wide for ball two as an Elton 11 comes crashing down in the outfield. We paused for these words from Budweiser. You know how they just don't get thrown. Jody's all over. Don't know if the ground screw coming out to cover the field. Flood, guts everywhere. Joey, what's up? Guys, I was at the game the other day. With Psycho Mark? Yeah. I was with the guy with the Hillary Clinton mask and the big bra on. Come on. Yeah. I had a sign that said, I'm not a carpet bagger. I'm a carpet muncher. Oh my God. Yeah. It was attached to a piece of carpet and I had a big wow sign. Oh really? What happened was I was going to throw myself on the grenade in the Army terminology there for the show and I was going to run out onto the field. I ran over the railing into the box seats, the ground level, and it must have been one of Giuliani's goons, but he got up and he caught me in the head while I was wearing the mask and I was getting ready to run down the rows. I went down and he yelled, not funny, get out of here. I had to run into the stadium to get away from him. I got also attacked by some news crews while I was jumping up and down behind the camera. So you were going to run on the field dressed like that? Yeah. I was actually going to throw myself in the grenade for the show. I thought it would be pretty funny. But yeah, I got beat up by a couple of those guys. Yeah. So what are you going to do? Did you guys get the tape? I sent it to you. Not yet. The TV show Extra. No, not yet. Yeah, I sent it in though. It should be there today. All right. We'll check it out. All right, guys. Thank you, Joey. Love you. All right. Well, they played a joke on Psycho Mark. Psycho Mark in charge of all the commercials here at NAW, carding them up and stuff and making sure that they're ready to be played on the radio, right? Right. And I guess Spaz, who was here for this? Spaz, Ben? Spaz, grab the mic. Spaz was running the show Monday. Grab the mic. And they decided to pull up a prank on Psycho Mark and call him at Shea Stadium and tell him that we were missing a commercial, which is a very big deal here at NAW. Yes. We can't miss playing the spot. So Spaz, you decided to prank Psycho Mark? Yeah, it was actually Ben's idea. And then Ben said, come on, let's just go. Go, Spaz. You're so good. And so I decided to do the call. And throughout the call, Mark was giving me a couple of lines to spit out. And I think it went pretty well. You mean Ben? I'm sorry. Ben, anything you could add to this little... I think it's all in the tape. Listen to how drunk Mark was. Well, this is after the game. I was in a bar. Got to give me a little credit. You sound hammered on this phone call. Of course I am. I went to the frigging Mets game. It seemed like you weren't buying it at first, and then you got a little panicky at the end of this prank call. Shut up and go to the tape. He's just belligerent. Yeah, it's what it is. Spaz now doing Jerky Boy phone calls. I'm going to show you I lost my glasses and my shoes. I went to the Empire State, but I can't see God damn it. I'm Frank Rizzo, opening your F&E S jacket. Alright, so here's Spaz trying to pull it over on Psycho Mark, completely wasted after the Mets game. Jerky Boy, but he's a true jerk, so it works. There you go. So here it is. Stop it! Let's go to the tape. I love that clip. Here we go. Mark? Yeah? Mark? What's up? Yo, you there, dude? There you go. Hear it? Dude, we got a major problem here. What's up? We're missing a spot, dude, and it's running in the next spot break. Oh yeah, is Ben putting you out of this? No, he's not, dude. We're missing PIX, spot 109. Is there another one in the cart? I don't see it. Lying. Come on, I'm not lying, dude. How the f&%k can you go to a Mets game if you're not going to get your job done? I need a spot. What am I going to do? Spaz, you know... Pick up a coffee and wake up. Maybe do Spaz radio. No, dude, I need a spot. How am I going to fill in the spot for PIX? I don't see another one. Do you see another one in there, Snake? A PIX one? Dude, there's no other PIX here. We need a PIX spot. It's a blue dotted spot. Oscar winning performances. And we need it to see the second one. Jim is going to be f&%ked, man. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I'm going to be f&%ked. I don't want my ass to be on the line for this if the spot doesn't run. Last time I didn't run a spot I got in trouble, dude. I'm not going to get in trouble for this again. Mark? Yeah, I'm listening. So what am I going to do? There's no one at the IX here. You've got to come back and get me one. What time is it? Well, it's running your next spot break. I could probably postpone it to the next hour by switching spots around, but I need you back to get it done. I have to run that spot. I'm not going to get in trouble for this, dude. Oh, well, it looks like you're f&%ked. What the f&%k? Get your job done before you go out and do sh&%t for promotions. No, no, no, no, no, sit it down. Wait, come on. You think you're going to be laughing when Jim finds out about this? Oh, f&%k. F&%k. F&%k. Eee. We've got to stop this here. Dude, you are so hammered, man. You are so hammered. Eee. Spaz. Eee. He's doing muony impressions and then he's doing tet night impressions. Oh, Danny. We have people. Spaz. Spaz. Sit down, Spaz. How about a brassica? Let's go back to the Spaz prank call with Psycho Mark hammered in a bar after the met game. Are you drunk, man? Are you drunk? Are you high? Excuse me? Are you high right now? No. Well, dude, I need you back here now. I need that PIX spot. You know what? What? You're not going to be there? I'm just going to get Jeremy then. Dude, I'm just going to have to talk to Jeremy because I need that f&%king spot, man. I need that f&%king spot. Jeremy's down. Dude, I've got to run that spot. We're always f&%king going down now. I don't need this. I don't need this. Dude, stop f&%king. You're not going to be laughing when Jim's f&%king knowing you about this. They told you to get your job done before you got left, but it's a damn met game. And now we're f&%ked, man. And you're laughing. Dude, I signed out. There were so many spots coming in. Tara did not tell me about no PIX spot. And if anything, it'll be put off tomorrow. You're lying to your teeth. I'm not f&%king lying. I've got to run this spot. Shut the f up. Dude, I'm in the... Retarded? Dude, this is my first time... I'm going to cut my ass. No way, because I'm not going to leave all my $&%t in that stuff. Dude, this is the first time I'm running worst stuff by myself, okay? All right, who came and gave you the orders to put it on? Dude, it's written here in the spot log. Oh yeah? What's the code number? 109. Oh boy, whatever. Dude, dude, dude. 109, Cart is in there, but there's a squiggly line through it, meaning it's not going to play. It says here in the log, PIX, Cart 109. As of 4.30, I called in and I found out if there was anything remaining for tomorrow. There was not. Therefore, I signed out. I said, that's it. I'm not there for now. Well, this must have been a late entry then. Something might have been overlooked. Something was probably overlooked. It's in the log. You know how sometimes traffic... I f***ed you out of Cart stuff up. Are you a cable human being? Yeah, but I don't know what to do for PIX read. I don't know what to read is. What is it, a read? It's a PIX spot, but I don't know what to do to put a spot together. I'm not in production. Put it on a cart. What is it on, a reel to reel? I don't know. I don't deal with commercials. PIX usually on a pad. It is? Where can I get it? It's usually right on my production table. So I got to look on your table then. Are you f***ing with me? No, I'm not f***ing with you, dude. If I was f***ing, I would have ended the joke a long time ago, but this is not a joke. It's my first time running worse stuff by myself, and usually Rick is here to spot these things, and I don't know what to do now. Is Jim there? No, Jim's not here anymore. What do you mean Jim's not there anymore? Jim's usually there until like 6 o'clock. No, Jim's not there. No, he left early. And Earl wants you to get in trouble. Right now he's trying to get into trouble with Jeremy. In what respect? He's in his office right now. He's trying to get into trouble about this. I tried to stop him. Dude, if you make him come down... No, what do you think I called you for? I am about to get on the train right now and be there in 10 minutes. Dude, why do you think I called you? I called you to get a heads up so we can solve this without Earl going to Jeremy about it, but he said no, screw it. Mark insulted me in the past, so I got to go to Jeremy now. I don't have to spend. This makes no sense to me. Is Ben still there? I don't see him. I tried calling his office about 10 minutes ago. He wasn't in there. Who, Ben? Yeah, Ben wasn't in his office. He said he... Ben? Where is Ben? Is Ben behind you tackling right now? No, Ben came in late because he had to be here a few days and now he's out again. He's actually behind you right now. No, he's not behind me. The only one in the studio is stinky. Trying to look for the spot that we cannot find. Oh, the spot. Well, you know, not for nothing, but maybe you brain geniuses. What the fuck, first of all... I got to hear that again. Jesus. ...you're breathing. I'm just trying to find the spot. Well, you know, not for nothing, but maybe you brain geniuses. What the fuck, get me the fucking production order, you piece of shit. Get me the production order. Get the production order. Get me the production order. Get me the production order. Get me the production order. Get me the production order. Where would the production order be? On my desk. It would say be on the air with huge highlighted marks. All right, I'm an air one right now. I'm going to put you on hold. I'm going to go look for it on his desk. All right, so keep holding. What do you got on him? What do you want me to tell him now? I don't know. He's ready to come back? He's not sure we can make him come back? No, no. No, just tell him it's a joke. I know. Let's just keep ragging him on for a couple minutes, and then we'll let him know. What am I going to say to him now? I'm running out of stuff. I think they're all saying I'm busted. Mark? Yes? I can't find the production order, and I also checked down. There's no production order. I can't find the production order, so I don't know where it was put. Write it up. And, dude, Stakey just ran down the... Write it up. Hey, Mark. Mark. Mark, Stakey ran down, and Earl has got the door shut in Jeremy's office. Well, then good. Earl, then tell Earl to go do the production, because he knows how to do the production. He can fill in for me, but I am not there. But he's too busy trying to rat you out and getting you into trouble. I let him rat me out, and I don't give a flying f***. All right, dude. All right. Dude, write it up. I'll deal with it in the morning. All right. I already signed out. I already spoke with my boss. You want to try and have with me? All right, man. Have fun. Bye. And there you go. You are a mess, man. It is, man. Genius. You are so freaking hammered. That's a good one. You're trying to mess with me? I don't give a flying f***. How many rounds did you go through while you were on the phone? Two rounds. Two rounds. Probably. All right, let's get on the phones. A bunch of people that were with Psycho Mark at Shea Stadium Monday. Hey, Chris, what's up? Yeah, actually, this is his friend, Matt. I was with him, too. We drove him home from the damn game. Are you serious? Yeah, we took him home. We saw him and we were sitting with you. Thanks for the tickets, by the way. Oh, cool. I hope you had a good time. Yeah, we did have a great time. Yeah, we drove home every day. Yeah. We had a grand old time. We're drinking a lot at the game, too. Obviously. Cool. Thanks for the ride, dude. I appreciate it. Yeah, don't follow that. Anytime. Anytime, whatsoever. All right, Chris. Thank you. Thanks a lot. All right, bro. Let's go to Tommy. Tommy, you're next on NW. Hey, what's up? Hey. Hey, thanks for the tickets. No problem. Oh, you were at the game with Mark, too, right? Yeah, I was right behind him. Yeah. Yeah, he was holding up all my signs. Oh, cool. Like, show me pudding. I had an FBA sign with a skeleton, which is pretty funny. And every time a plane passed by Psycho Mark, he was always going, I think he was drunk in stone before he even got there. We're doing the 50 Cal for the airplanes. All right. Well, thank you, Tommy. All right, thanks. Phones are crapping out a little bit there. All right, Anthony. There's Spaz doing a little prank call. Yes. You know what's weird? And I notice these guys doing it, too. After you get out of here, I find I go home. I'm hanging out somewhere. I'm talking to an old friend. I'm like, man, look at the F&N on that. Yeah, yeah, you don't curse for a little while after you leave the... Well, if you do it for a while, you're cursed during, like, breaks. Right. Doesn't matter. You know, you get used to it. Like, when we go back to that office, forget it. I just had to give a little example of some of the language that goes on in the back office. Oh, he just shakes his head. We have our own little way of saying that. It's more like, eh, eh, eh. Bill said that one time we were... Oh, man. Really quick story. We were in a car. I was going out with this girl all the time, and we hooked up with this girl and her friend. And Bill's in the back seat of the car. And the girl was in the back seat, and I'm driving. They wanted to stop at some bar to pick something up. And the girl was in the back seat, and the girl was going out. When the time gets out, they go into the bar, and Bill's sitting in the back. He goes, you know, he was trashed. I mean, he was twice as trashed as Mark. He goes, you know, that girl's a real... And I go, well, yeah, okay, so... And I'm going to say to her face when she gets back in the car. I go, Bill, no, don't. Bill, don't do it. The girl happened to be a stripper. It was a stripper's friend. And these girls would have tore him into one, right? And I see them coming out of the bar. I see these two girls walking out of the bar. Bill's in the back going, I'm going to call her in. Bill, don't do it. Please don't do it. For the love of God, Bill, don't do it. She gets in the car. The girl is going out. She gets in the front. This girl gets in the back. And Bill's tapping me on the shoulder. He goes, I'm going to do it. Bill, please don't. Hey, you know what? You're a real... Told you, brother. Told you, brother. Didn't have to work on that. So what happened after that? Oh, Major Melee. It was a brawl. Yeah. That's the atom bomb. The girl takes me back to the people's pub. So what the hell? Steve, you're next on N.E.W. What's up, Bob? How are you? Okay, I just got to tell you. I think Spar's got his credibility back. That was 40. He stood with it. I think he made up for all the mistakes he made. This is great. You thought he was convincing in his little prank call there, huh? Yeah, he was. That was fun to believe him. It was really good. All right. Spar's his dad checking in. Thank you. Spar's might have a future in the prank call circuit, Anthony. Turkey Spar. Turkey Spar. Should I bring my tools? I'll wrap you in the head with a ratchet. I'm Tom, I'm Steve. I'm Corbett. I'm Egyptian. I'm Mytooth. He hit me and pushed me. What's this Psycho Mark out takes from the St. Patrick's Day? What's this Rick? Why is Psycho Mark in shock? Because I don't think he wanted this to come out. But Earl kind of snaked him on this one. How bad is this? I guess you were out for St. Pat's, right, Partian? The barbat? And he went to another station event and continued to get hammered and then came back and proceeded to do some production at 2 o'clock in the morning. Why is Psycho Mark all depressed? Mademar. That's true. Earl does his show on Sunday mornings which I don't think even the crickets listen to. Hey, Earl. Crickets? He makes me do the community calendar on his show, his public affairs show. It's Earl. I'm here on N.E.W. Let me ring Anthony's bell. Truth is he's about to lie. He makes me do his community calendar and I came in and I was ass-housed. He couldn't put a sentence together. And we got a tape of this? How long is this? Two segments of about 30 seconds. Okay, let's take a listen. Psycho Mark, drunken out takes. Here's to hearing. Right from the start. Oh, please. You expect me to read this? I can't f***ing read this. That's why you're going to cut it. All right. It's hot. We're running hot. Oh my God. All right, here's the second part of it. Here we go. Psycho Mark. Here's the... You can't get it wrong, Walter. This is a great, Earl. I like watching mudslides and trying to read copy at the same time. Here's the community calendar on 1027 W.N.E.W. You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness. Claims to be an eye-donner and you may someone leave the gift of sight. This is f***ing torture. Absolutely torture. Torture! It's torture! I can't go! I can't go! I can't go! Holy s***! Oh my God! You know, you need a little contrast on how drunk he is. Where is the stacker read? Just one quick line from the beginning of that with him like, hi. There he's the smooth Mark. Shut up! No, no, because... There it is. Now this is Psycho Mark at his bed. This is him in production. Put it in five. The way he's supposed to sound. All right, here we go. On the phone today we've got Lisa from Staten Island. Okay. Very good, right? Well, a little more. He's going to talk today about her experiences with stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner. How old are you, Lisa? Okay. That's great. This is Psycho Mark at two in the morning. There's the big... It's like Buddy Hensley but more like... Oh, please. You need to read this? I can't... I can't **** read this. That's all right. We're running hot. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to go get some water. All right. All right. We're running hot. All right. Here's Psycho Mark again when he's normal. Normal? During the day. Day five. And how much weight have you lost with Stack or Two? 102 pounds. Lisa, how did you hear about Stack or Two? I heard it off the O.P. and Anthony show. So what made you decide to lose the weight? Family gatherings were miserable. I hated going out. I hated when people took pictures. I didn't have to diet. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to eat. I didn't have to watch what I was eating. I could eat cheeseburgers, french fries, anything I wanted. Now did you talk to your doctor about Stack or Two? Yes. I went to a doctor regularly. There were no health problems whatsoever. So Lisa, how has Stack or Two changed your life? I look amazing. I feel amazing. And I love to shop now. Hey Lisa, thanks so much for joining us today and talking about your experiences with Stack or Two, the world's strongest fat burner. Do you think you could give us the plug before you go? All right. There's Psycho Mark at his best. Now maybe a little bit of Psycho Mark after a few beverages at 2 a.m. Here's a... Muds Slides on TV. This is a recovery channel. This is a great year old. I like watching Muds Slides and trying to read copy at the same time. Here's the community calendar on 1027WNEW. You may have what it takes to cure someone of blindness. Pleased to be an eye donor and you may someone leave the gift of... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... What is that dude? You know where it is. What number is that? Come on, you know where it is Psycho Mark. You made it. Yeah, that is funny. I almost hit the guard rail the first time I heard this one coming out of Psycho Mark's mouth. This is even better. Psycho Mark's doing a Don't Do Drugs Ed. Raising children these days is no easy task and it wasn't easy for your parents either. The big difference today is there's a tremendous availability of drugs and alcohol to children of all ages and the pressure to drive them. As parents, you can help your children avoid the use of drugs and alcohol by helping them develop self-esteem and by teaching them about the dangers of substance abuse. For more information and or counseling on substance abuse, contact the local drug abuse center. This message is sponsored by the civil engineers and professional staff, Lichtenstein Consulting Engineers. I can't read this shit. I'm sorry, I got it. All right. Damn, that's hot. We're running hot. Mark, Mark, you're in the day. Raising children these days is no easy task and it wasn't easy for your parents either.

Syndication, in 15 minutes your pizza's free. Alright, thank you. No problem. The whole syndication now chant is like, going away. Syndication in 15 minutes your pizza's free. That's pretty funny. Alright. You're stupid, you're so stupid. Stupid, you're so stupid. Let's go to Johnny. Johnny, what's going on? Hey, O.B. how you doing? Hey, how you doing? Hey, Johnny. Hey, your brother Song, when he meets God, he will be Mr. Offensive. Yes, yes, thank you. Very well put. If he meets God, that is. This guy's too much for me. Get him off. Dave, you're next on NAW. Hey, what's up guys? Hey, I learned that Anthony's brother has some serious issues. Yeah. And that's the end of the contest. We didn't even scratch the surface. I think he put the contest out of reach today. Are you guys going to end it? I think Joe officially ended our contest. You've got to let him go one more. I'm going to try and send one in. I'm the guy who caught the egg, the blind guy. Hey, what's up buddy? How's it going man? During the egg shooting we had Dave, the blind guy, catching the eggs that were coming out of, what's her name, you know what. Hey, did you see the clips of Jay Moore? Yeah, good shot. Hey, you know, I've got a friend out in LA I've been talking to. They've heard of you. Oh really? Yeah, people have been playing your tapes out there. That's it, we're syndicated on cassette tapes. There you go, man. We're like the Grateful Dead bootlegs. Yeah. I got to be in Anthony Bootleg August 1999. Yeah, but they know of you, at least out there. Cool. Syndication yesterday, man. Ah, that chant is not happening anymore. Maybe. Maybe we could use them as a reference. All right. Keith from Seaford. Hi, my name is Mark and I'm an alcoholic caught in a mudslide doing anti-drug commercials. Doug from Bergenfield. I learned that Jay Moore is gay because he's got blonde hair. Yes, we did learn that today, Anthony, finally. Kyle from Westfield, New Jersey, open hand at the newest game for the show. What's wrong with Psycho Mark? I just can't figure it out. It's so f'ing hard, Kyle. Let's go to Joe. Joe, you're next on NAW. Yeah, how you doing, guys? Good. Yo, there is a winner for the most offensive song contest. I've heard all of these and I cannot believe what I heard today. Yeah. I just couldn't believe it. I'm walking out of my car, coming back from the car, coming into the house like, oh my God, I can't believe it. Yeah, these songs are just getting painful to play, painful to listen to. Well, hopefully that'll be it. Yeah, I don't know how we go on from there. Okay, take it easy, guys. All right. Doug from Staten Island, I learned that in 2045 you guys will be syndicated in Banger May. That's right. Tony from Bayside, I learned Spaz is better off with the Jerky Boys than Owen Hay. Yeah. All right. Let's go to 10. Craig, what's going on? Hey, man, I learned that Spaz is going to test 747s on Fox. Yeah. This is Spaz, your brother speaking. We're going to be plunging to an altitude of zero. Put all your chains in the upper division. Thank you for buying Spaz, man. And watch out for the Cancer's Live wires. We're going to be crashing into Cancer's Live wires. And if you look out the right side of your cabin, you'll see a giant mosquito following you. James, what's going on? Yo, what's up, Owen Hay? Hey. I learned today that after Hitler killed himself, he was reincarnated as Anthony's brother. Oh, yeah. No doubt. I think you're right. No doubt. But we definitely got a winner for the contest, at least. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah, I think it's gotten to the point where I don't think anyone really wants this thing to go on, man. Of course we do. Come on. Oh, it is so painful. No bit anymore. It's just getting so out there. All right, James. Thank you. Thanks a lot, fellas. On occasion now. On occasion now. Yeah. Sorry, I was just playing with my fun toys. Oh, and I learned something today. What? That we're stupid. Stupid! You're so stupid! Yeah. It's not good when your boss tells you you're stupid. Stupid. He actually called you stupid. That's the word. That's the word. Stupid. When was the last time you were called stupid? Third grade. I can't remember. I was in third grade. That guy called him principal and they said, why'd you do that? I said, I don't know. I just wanted to break him. They said, you're stupid. I don't think that word's been part of my vocabulary for the last 20 years, you know? Stupid! You're so stupid! When you graduate from grammar school, I think you leave the word stupid behind. Stupid. Yeah. All right. What do we got? I think we're done. Yeah, that's about all of what did we learn today. We got to thank Cow-Bell-Bill for checking in and stopping by. Not Cowboy Bill. Cow-Bell-Bill. I like when people call up and go, I'm real good friends with Cowboy Bill. If you're real good friends, you'd know it's Cow-Bell-Bill. Cow-Bell. Please. That's the lesbian Danielle I did. She wants to go in and be on the couch. Oh yeah? Yeah. Invite her in. Sure. Sure, why not? I love Joe. Let's not forget Cow-Bell-Bill's line of the day. Two kickballs in a head-on collision. Two kickballs in a head-on collision. I'm not even going to explain it, but that definitely was the line of the day. With that, we've got to step aside for Don and Mike. We'll see you guys hopefully. Hopefully tomorrow at two. Hopefully. We'll see you after the latest round of meetings that will occur very, very soon. It was actually two kickballs in a head-on collision. Alright, later. All to the head-on collision. We punish ignorance. Hey, Ass, turn down your radio. 1027 WMDW.
