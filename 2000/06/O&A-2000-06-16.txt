 Chill out you bastards, we're here. Abuse on the instant feedback. We're here, we want to just jam another song and we'll start the festivities. It's Friday, it's June 16th, we are live just like we told you yesterday. Ponderous. We told you we'd be here starting at two. Two? We want to start with a couple songs, relax. Relax you mother effers. The abuse we're getting on the instant feedback, Anthony. Start your show, you said two, effing ponderous. I guess starting at two means jamming a Metallica song, you whack bags. What's wrong with that? I'm just reading the... Every instant feedback is abuse. Let's punish him and play another one. Effers. 1027 WNEW, it's the ONA show. We're here, we'll be back, relax. Alright, here comes. Anthony is evil but Opie is worse than Hitler. We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman show. 1027 WNEW. Alright, mark your calendar, this is the first for the ONA show. Yeah. Actually being live in the two o'clock hour. Yeah, look at that. Just to prove it, it's June 16th, 2002 on this FU Friday. Of course, we're getting ready for the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony. Yes, a little serial killer segment. I got to use a line that the radio chick gave me down the hall. She comes running down and she goes, Guys, it looks like Joel Rifkin's basement down near the studio. Well, you can hear drilling going on. Drilling and hammering and there's all kinds of sounds going on that don't sound very nice. We met the ladies for a moment. Yeah, we should have met them because now I feel guilty. Yeah, they all seem really nice and everything. We got some lovely ladies in this contest. Yeah, now... Very nice. Now we're going to torture them. Yeah, maybe if we just refer to them as eggs, we won't think of them as people. It gets in the barrel. It gets in the barrel or it gets those again. We got some great contestants, Anthony. One of them weighs 250 pounds. I met her and I went, Whoa! We had to get a special barrel for her. Yeah, I see that. One of these things is not like the other going on. No. One of the barrels is just a little wider than the rest. Yeah, it seems that our big girl is truly a big girl. Wait, drill on the air just to give some sound. It's hilarious. I need to take a look over there. Listen to the drill. They're putting the air holes in the 55 gallon drums. Keep them up a little high. Yeah, there they go. Like a job site in here. Get me my sawzall. All right, very good. Where did you get the hole saw on the drilling stuff? He's got all that stuff. He needs that to clean the coffee machine. Amazing. That mic's not even on. That's why we couldn't really hear it. I think you've got to use one of the hand-helds. We have the lids to all these things and everything? Yeah. Why don't we put the girls in first and then drill the holes in the side? Check this out. Yeah. The metal strap around. Oh my God, dude. Look, it's got a locking metal strap. Yeah. Clips right into position. A drum guy just brought these in. They are going to be epic. There we go. Now we're drilling. Oh, this is sick. Are all the girls going to empty their bladders or something? Yeah, they're all going to the bathroom right now. Yeah, they're getting into their bra and panties, Anthony. Nice. We're taking a ton of pictures for the event. We've got to thank Scott Colombo. He's working his ass off. We should have our first pictures up on www.wnaw.com of the contestants, Anthony. Yeah. They're going to look a lot different when 7 o'clock rolls around. It's going to be a very, very long show for them. They're all nice and cute and pretty and all dressed up. Yeah, I'm very surprised at the girls that turned out for this. They are. They're like attractive girls. Everyone's screaming, get the girls and the drum now. Larry, what's going on? Larry. Hey, man. Larry. Whatever. You. Hey, Riley. What's going on, guys? Hey, Riley. Hey, first time calling here. Love the show. Got to tell you that. Thank you. What's up with this procrastination? We've got to get those girls in the drum past 2 o'clock. We're just about there. We're just about there. They'll be in by 2.30. That's fine. That's close enough. Damn. As you can tell, they're still preparing the drums in the background. Yeah. Any hints of what you guys are going to throw in, the secret sauce or the secret whatever it was? Larry. We are encouraging listeners to come down to the station with stuff to throw into the drum. We have to decide if your stuff is safe enough to put in the drum. Yeah. And there's already a line upstairs to come on down and put stuff in the drum. You don't have that. All right. I can tell you this. We have, we left milk out for the last eight hours on a radiator. Oh. Oh. And I hear, and I hear. That's just gross. I hear the chum has arrived, huh? The chum is here. Three buckets. Oh, guys. You got to take care. All right, Ryan. I'm looking forward to it. All right. Second mark. There's three buckets of chum. Three five gallon buckets of chum. Oh my God. Oh no. Oh my God. One dimension all the stuff we purchased last night. Oh no. Did you see all the stuff they purchased? I don't want to give it away. I'll just tell you, it fills up a shopping cart. We got some great stuff. It doesn't count what the listeners bring down today. Enough. A lot of construction going on around the building. I'm assuming like, you know, the building is going to be a little bit more than a hundred square feet. Yeah. I'm assuming like, I don't know, sawdust and all sorts of fun stuff. Are we just about done with the drilling or? Couple more. Couple more? All right. See, they made the holes in the lids. Now they're making a couple in the sides, I guess, so the air can circulate through. Hey, Ken, what's going on? Hey, listen, I have the best stuff for you. I work at a place called the Family Birthing Center in East Meadow. I want to bring down placenta. Oh my God. I'm dead serious. We normally send it out to drug companies because we do testing. No, no, we can't have any biohazard material being dumped on us. Yeah, we know they use that stuff in like makeup and shampoos. Yeah, but I think it's taken care of by that point. We might have to pass on that. We don't need any biohazard material. Because we got like four of them here. Dude. Oh, not to cut this guy off, but thank you, Ken. All right. You see what they're doing for the big girl? Yeah, I know. They have two of those big green pails that you see the landscapers use for the grass clippings in the back. They're going to put them on top of each other so she is encapsulated in two of these garbage pails. I believe that's the delay right now, Anthony. Yeah. You know? Usually you find nothing more than an El Salvadorian inside these pails in the back of the pickup trucks during a landscaping season. But you need two of them put on top of each other. I learned something today. What? You know, you never see fat victims of serial killers. No. That's true. Too much work. I mean, what serial killers are going to go through all the trouble that we are to get a big girl in one of these trucks? I know. We have big enough holes to dump the stuff in? Yeah. How are we going to dump the stuff in? We have big enough holes? Okay. Very good. All right. You want to talk to some of the ladies, Anthony? Yeah, we might as well. All right. Get to know them a little better before they are imprisoned and their drums full of crap. Yeah, let's get a couple of the girls in here. I want to talk to a couple of the ladies. Get a couple of the ladies while I continue. A couple of the girls. Yeah, we'll get a couple of the girls in here. A little talk though. Jesus, like a marauder. All right, Marks. Keep drilling them holes. All right, let's get the ladies in. Get them on that mic over there, Ben. That would be the easiest way. Get ready for some torture. Holy cow. Wow, what have you got on there? Well, let's see. We were going for one piece. We didn't want everything hanging out today. Okay. Now, what's your name? Christy. Hi, Christy. You're the reason we're building a special drum. That's right. It's a special serial killer drum just for you. I've been bothering you almost every day for that. I see. She's very excited to get on the drum. It scares me. And there's no problem with her fitting in this thing. No, not at all. This thing is gigantic. And you're wearing one piece. What is that? Look, a bustier. It's a bustier kind of thing. Scuba suit. Scuba suit. Scuba suit. Scuba suit. Scuba suit. Ponderous. All right. Okay, very nice. And you're ready for this? Yes. You think you're going to go the distance? Definitely. Definitely. Definitely. You weigh what, 250? Yes. 250? 250. 250. You've got huge boobs too, man. 48 triple D. 48 triple D. Do you wow at those things? Wow. Whoa, I guess she does. One word for that. Wow. Oh my goodness. Catch it or lose it, man. Catch it or lose it. Those are gigantic. I've got to say. Yeah. All right. Okay, so she's got the bustier thing. I think you're into like S&M and stuff too. Is he happy with her large boobs? Happy. No? Oh, you are, huh? Oh, no, no. I had her confused with something else. She says no. That means yes. Okay, great. So you're looking forward to getting into the barrels and being covered with all kinds of crap. And WNAW.com is getting hounded. Yeah. I'm trying to find where we're putting the pictures today. Let me see. I think it might be on the semi-nope. Ask Colombo where the listeners need to go to see the pictures. We're taking pictures as we go so you guys can play along at home. You're not claustrophobic at all? No. No. And I haven't met the rest of the ladies, but my money's on Christy. She's going to go the distance. Yeah. I've got to believe it. There's no doubt in my mind. What's going the distance? What do you got there? I'll give you this to play with for a little while. What the hell is that? What is that? I've never seen it. That's like a blouse. Wow, that's her bra. That's a bra. Dude, it's huge. Wow, look at this girl. That's a balloon launcher. Very nice, Christy. Very nice. You've all got little... What is that you're wearing? What's your name? Wendy. Wendy. Very good. You almost slipped. Okay, Wendy. Wait, tell Wendy to stand up. I can't see her. Look, she's got a little... Oh, I remember you. It looks like a pajama party or something. That's very cute. What are you wearing? A little baby doll dress. A little baby doll dress. Very cute. You're going to get into... Oh, yeah, I was going to say you're not going to get into the barrel and ruin it or something. No, they have to be in their bra and panties. She's taking off the baby dress and the water. Very nice. What do you think your chances are of making it through this? Well, I think I'm going to do it. Yeah, you're going to do it? Yeah, I have the height advantage because I'm not cramped up. I'm not claustrophobic. You're not claustrophobic. That's good because the barrel, the lid will be slapped on and the metal band will be put around and you will be entrapped in there for about four and a half hours. Four and a half hours. Now, can we put the names of the girls on their barrel? Yeah, we have to do that. Because each barrel is going to be miced and we're not going to know what we're talking to. We're going to be able to hear the show when we're in there, right? Oh, yeah. Here, you're the show today. You think we planned anything else today? Very good. I'm going to go a little faster. All right, well, we got... What's your name? Tabitha. Look at her with the little hidey hair doing her stuff. They're all so freaking hot. I feel guilty now. Yeah, you're... What are you wearing under that robe? She's got like Victoria's Secret. I know. I have to take this off now? Well, just open it up. Let's take a little look. Holy smoke. My Lord. Look at what she's wearing. You just come from a lingerie show or something? Look at that. That's my job, actually. Wow, look at her. I doubt it. Not bad. Very nice. All right, and do you think your chances are very good? Excellent. Yeah, not claustrophobic. You could take being cramped up in there. Not at all. You don't have a weak bladder? Not at all. No? All right. Okay, wow. They're very confident. Yes. And you, what is your name? Jane. Jane. What are you wearing in the barrel? Just a normal glove. She's got bra and panties. She's got a towel around her for the time being. Bandana on her head, very smart so her hair won't get all goopy. There's a bunch of perverts that are looking at you guys through that studio window. So you can wave to them because you can't see them? Whoa, they just got wowed. Look at all of these. That damn wow thing never gets old. I know, gotta love it. All right, and who haven't we talked to? Jane. Hi Jane, how are you? She's Jane. Oh, and then Kate. I'm sorry, I gotta get all the names down here. Kate. Kate seems a little shy, a little quiet. A little shy, a little quiet. That's okay. And she's like fully dressed at this point. I am, well when I get in the barrel I can just flip her. I don't know. That's fine. I just want to know what the strategies are here. Oh yeah, I know, I kinda sound. You guys realize what you're in for, right? Yeah. Really? Not really. She is a little... I think we have, this is the person that I got my odds on as the first one out. Do you think you're going to make it through the whole thing? I think so. All right, I'm going to... Not quite as confident. I'm going to guess she's out first, Kate. No, no, no, no. All right, now I'm definitely saying it. Kristy goes the distance. I think four out of the five go the distance today. Yeah, could look that way. You're leaving me out? That's horrible. Well, just on the first impression. Just on the first impression. These will change by the minute. Yeah, you can change our opinion as the show goes on here today. All right. All right. Don't you worry. All right, do you guys realize we have $2,500 cash up for grabs? Someone could walk away with $2,500 today. It gets divvied up between whoever's left at the end. Correct. You all get a certificate to Shrewsbury Bicycle for $1,000, right? That's guaranteed. $1,000 bike. That's guaranteed. And other stuff that we have later on, concert tickets and blah, blah, blah. I would think if one of you girls would be so inclined to psych out the other ones while you're in the barrel. You know, like the guy's in prison and stuff and there's the new fish next to him and he tries to get him to break down and cry. Like, you might want to try that to get the other girl to leave. Maybe talk about how horrible the stuff is and where it's seeping into in your body. Just little ideas, you know? Maybe if you want to walk away with all the cash. We've been working on that already. Have you? Yeah, we've been trying them with drinks out there so the bathroom problem is solved. Oh, that's good. See, look at that smart girl there. We've got a good... The before and after shots are going to be hilarious because they're all very nice looking. They're all very attractive girls. I was so surprised when I saw you girls walk in here and it's like, what is this? I thought we were going to get some homeless girls down here, but no. Very attractive, willing to go the distance. Do we have any of the pictures up yet? Not yet. Scott's loading up the pictures and the names. We've got the guys who brought some of the stuff down. We've got Captain Anthony who brought the chum. Arr! Captain Anthony, arr! How you doing, man? Good, good. You brought chum? Brought chum and a special surprise. Now what is in chum? Well, yeah, don't even say it. Oh, okay. I can give you an idea. We can put them in the soundproof room or something so they can watch. Most people have watched Jaws so they know what chum is all about. It's the stuff they ladle out into the water. Into the water to attract the fish. And it's fresh. It's nothing rotten. All right. Nothing unedible. Well, that's it. It's organic. Absolutely. It dissolves with water. Thank you, Captain Anthony. Arr! Arr! Arr! So, I brought Sal the drum guy. I brought the drums. Yeah, I brought the drums. My own private collection. My own private collection. And a blank panel van. Arr! I've got to keep a low profile. Yeah, when I drive it out to my shallow graves upstate. I don't want anybody. Very good. The drums are working out well. You girls are looking at the drums. None of you have a problem with fitting into them or anything? No. Oh, and of course we've got the industrial size drums. For Christy. For Christy. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. Too fitty. All right, we've got to take a break. And the cricket guys. We're the cricket guys. Right here. Hey, what's up man? How's it going? Good. Cool. Very good. Thanks for helping us out today. We've got two large green boats full of all sorts of insects. Now I've seen a few. It looks like some of the girls' faces. I said, you know something? It may not even get to that. Don't you worry. When I called in the first time, Anthony, you said no bugs and no snakes. I said, let's not even talk about the bugs. It probably won't get to that. All right, so it's like that. I understand. Don't worry about the bugs because it probably will not get to that. You're going to do it towards the end? Yeah, don't worry. Yeah, that's like a grand finale. That's a grand finale if it's like 640 and we've got all five girls still in the barrel. Has anyone been eating beans and broccoli or anything? Psycho Mark, do you think you're ready to charge up? I'm Mexican for lunch. All right, let's take a break. Okay. When we get back, the girls go into the drums. All right, we've got to get all the pictures of the ladies, the before shots and stuff. We've got the before pictures. We're going to take the pictures just before we close the lid. Did we get all individual shots of the girls that are going to be put up and stuff? Good, because we really want to show what they look like. A lot of these pictures will be on www.com. Yeah, so I mean the site's getting pounded right now. Oh my God. All right, man. We start the festivities next. Stay there. The OP in Anthony show. Oh, two feet wide. Or stupidity on the way. Yeah. Ah, yes, Anthony. We're back. 212-757-1027 is our phone number. We're getting ready for the 55-gallon drum challenge. Yeah, oh my God. I am so excited today. Anthony, before we move on with the festivities, explain the 55-gallon drum challenge real fast to anyone that's just tuning in for the first time today. OP, we have five barrels. I don't know how many barrels we got. We have five big, like 55-gallon drum type of barrels. We have four that look the same, and then one that's just... One is two of those big green garbage pails you see on the back of the landscaper's trucks full of grass clippings. Two of those that will have to be turned one on top of another to make a huge capsule to hold the biggest of our girls. Christy, I believe. Christy, who's the odds-on favorite at this moment. Yes, who is saying she is 250 pounds. A lot of instant feedback coming in after the people saw the pictures saying, closer to three and a quad. Three and a quad? That's what a lot of the listeners are saying looking at the pictures. But regardless, she will indeed fit in this barrel. But if you weighed three and a quad, why would you like fake your weight and say too fitty? Well, you know, I don't know. Might as well just go for the gusto. And then the other four barrels are your standard 55-gallon drum type barrels with a snap-on lid that cannot be opened from the inside. We've drilled some air holes in them out of the kindness of our hearts. And in just a couple of minutes, the girls will get into these barrels. We will seal them in so they cannot escape. And throughout the course of the show until 7 o'clock, we will dump some of the most heinous material known to man into these barrels on top of these girls. And they will have to stay in these barrels. If they indeed concede defeat and have to be taken out of the barrel, they lose their chance at $2,500. $2,500, cold hard cash. Now, if there's one survivor at the end of the show, they walk away with $2,500. If there's two, they split it. If there's all four of them last, five, excuse me, I'm looking at the normal barrels and the huge barrel, they must deviate a five-way. Five-ways. All the ladies will get a gift certificate to Shrewsbury Bicycles. $1,000 gift certificate for each lady for just going in the barrel. All right? Very cool. That is a very cool prize. I want to thank Shrewsbury Bicycle for coming forward. I think the only sponsor that came forward for this bit. I don't understand why. I thought this was just a tame little radio trick. Christy's pissed that Joey Paisano didn't come through with some food. Looks like. But like I said earlier, very surprised, lovely ladies coming down here for this event. They're wearing little baby doll dresses and some lingerie. It's just Psycho Mark getting in the barrel. Do you fit Psycho Mark? No, no. We can't fit in these barrels. Psycho Mark will fit. Wow, that's going to be painful. It's going to be painful. Come on, how the hell are we going to do this? There's no way. I don't think any of the girls can last five hours, Ann. Not even five. We're working on four already. Yeah. But that's okay. Why don't we get the festivities going? By the way, I want to thank Scott Colombo. He's down the hall. We are snapping pictures as fast as we can. We're running them down the hall. You can check out what we're calling the semi-live studio cam today. We're still picking up the event, updated as things happen. Keep checking back. It's www.com. Just go to Opium Anthony. You'll know where to go from there. All their names are being stuck to the respective barrels. All the barrels have been named. Oh my God. You ever go into a warehouse and you see like, barrels labeled sodium chloride and what not. They're just lined up. Barrels. Jane. Kate. Wendy. Tabitha. And we've got the holes in the top of the barrel. Is that how we'll be dumping the stuff through? This is twisted. All right. And we've assigned the girls a safe word like a real thing, which is basically, please get me the F out of here. So that's the safe code word. Please get me the F out of here. Okay. Well, let's parade the girls in. Who's first? Contestant number one, that would be Kristy. Kristy. Kristy. Come on in. Contestant number one. Here she is. Too fitting. Too fitting. Too fitting. Wait, wait. Give her the mic. Give her the mic. How are we sealing her barrel since it's two barrels together? We've got duct tape. We've got duct tape. Yeah. Duct tape. Duct tape. No serial killer segment is complete without use of duct tape. God, you've got to love duct tape. All right. Kristy, we're giving you the option. You could wow the radio audience if you like. If you don't want that on the web, that's okay. I think I'm going to pass on the web. Oh, okay. But Rick's got a picture of her in her one-piece thing. I don't know what you call it. It's a bustier. A bustier. A scuba suit. A bustier. That's boosted, all right. A bustier. Very nice, Kristy. All right. She is getting in. The top barrel is now being placed on top of the barrel. On top of the other one, Opie. Thus entombing Kristy in this landscaper's nightmare. Wait, wait. Is there enough air holes in that? Okay, there are. Sure. All right. It looked like it had just one little air hole in it. If they don't talk for like 10 minutes, we'll know they passed out from the funeral. Oh my God. She's having a tough time even. All right. She's in. Any final words? Bye. See you in a couple of hours. There she goes. The top being put on. Oh my God. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. Spin around so there's a hole in the front so we can see her. All right. Because all of the girls, we should be able to get a little look at them. A little look. We kind of have a hole we can peek in. And the inimitable sound of duct tape being ripped. All right. Rick, why don't we do this so we can move this along? Have someone else do the duct taping and you can bring the ladies in one by one. Okay? Next lady. Because all the ladies should be in at the same time or pretty close to that. Who's next? Who is next indeed? All right. Contestant number two, Wendy. Wendy. Wow. Lovely Wendy. Wait, Wendy has a nice baby doll outfit on. Baby doll dress on. Looking very cute in her little baby doll dress. Thank you. It's all pink. She's the one making me feel very guilty about this. A little baby doll dress, Anthony. Sorry. All right. She's taking the baby doll dress off to get in the barrel. Okay. What is she wearing? Boxer shorts? She's got little boxers and a little pink bra. Very nice. That's cute. I think I'm going to have to. Boxers are coming off. Boxers are coming off. Can you hear the duct tape in the background? There we go. She's got a nice little blue and pink panties on. Wonderful. All right. We've got a step ladder. You ready? Yep. A little step ladder. She's got to use a little step ladder to get into a barrel. All right. Rick, make sure you get a picture for the Internet. They're helping her in. Yeah, you're going to have to help her. Oh my God. Okay. Her leg is up over the rim. All right. All right. Get a picture of her standing in her barrel. Yeah. All the girls need pictures of them standing in the barrel. No wonder she looked a lot taller. Look at those shoes. You're a little girl. I'm only 4'10". You're 4'10". Well, that will be easier for you to fit in that barrel. 4'10". What a drastic difference between you and Christy. Christy is officially entombed, Anthony. Yeah, Christy is pretty much entombed in her... Let's get the top one. Ready? Can we get a picture of her? All right, we got a picture of Wendy in her barrel. All right. Let's... Christy, don't move around too much. That thing tips over. I don't know what's going to happen. It could be it. All right. Yeah, we're ready to go. Okay. Any final words, Wendy? I will survive. Very nice. All right. There she goes. She's too cute for this, Anthony. This is insane. She's in the barrel. All right. They're taking a couple of pics. The lid being slapped on now and locked on. All right. I mean, it's like a Houdini lock and everything. Oh, there it is. It is latched closed. Oh, my God. This is so... This is twisted. Wendy is now officially entombed in the barrel. All right. Ben, Ben, I want to say hi to Christy. I want to hear how she sounds in her barrel. Stick that microphone through the hole there. How are you doing, Christy? I feel good. Just do not turn it off. I'm trying to be like a girl. I'm trying to be a girl. I'm trying to be like a girl. All right. Let's see how it goes. I'm trying to be like a girl. I'm trying to be like a girl. I'm trying to be like a girl. I'm trying to be like a girl. No, we wouldn't do that. No, no. Not over Niagara Falls, okay? All right. You hear the echo of the barrel there? That's loud. I hear it. All right. Put the mic through the hole for Wendy. How is Wendy feeling? Wendy? Hi. Sounds like baby Jessica stuck in the well. Ed, she says it's really loud in there, so don't bang on the top. Yeah, don't bang on the top. It's really loud. Is it really loud? We have enough room, so it's good. Oh, you feel comfy though? Yeah. You think you'll be able to stay in there now for a remainder of the show? I think I can. After I'm finished with my oil, it's not that bad. That'll be okay. Psycho Mark, you are a frigging cruel bastard. Don't do that. Don't do that. He's so fast. Yeah, he is. No slamming on the top of the barrel. All right. Let's move on to the next contestant. Contestant number three, Kate. Kate. Kate. Yes. Making her way in. Kate is the odds on favorite to be the first one. No, no. That was our first impression. That was the first impression. We thought she'd be the first to come out of the barrel, Anthony. I might surprise you. All right. She is being helped into the barrel. She's a tall girl. How tall are you? Five-seven. Five-seven. There goes the other one. Very nice. She's got black bra, black panties. Very nice. Very nice. Very nice body. Yes. Oh, thank you. All right. A little photo op of her in her barrel. Any final words, Kate? Just leave me in here. Just leave you in here. Leave me in here so I can win. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Let's contest it. Let's duct tape her. Oh, no. They don't need a duct tape. Just slam the lid on. Wait. I want to hear the sound of the lid when you lock it. It's a Houdini lock. Oh, no. Oh, boy. I thought they were going to bother me. Oh, boy. The lid didn't even go on yet. She is still the odds on favorite. Okay. I got it. Yeah. She just cursed. Don't slam the top too much. All right. It's locked. She's in. It's not a happy minute. Here, stick the mic in there. Let's see how she... Kate? Kate? Kate. Hey. How are you doing? All right. Are your knees going to bother you? Oh, boy. What? Are your knees really going to bother you? I don't know. But they're going to pour the stuff through the holes? Yeah. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. All right. I need to stay in the middle then. Odds on favorite right now. Yeah. I know. Before the lid got on, she was like, oh, my knees. Only four hours to go. Any of the ladies feeling claustrophobic at this point? A little bit. A little bit. Is that right? Kate? Oh, my. She's done. Kate's a little bit claustrophobic. Her knees hurt, and she's asking questions about where the stuff's going to be pouring through. It's over, Johnny. It's over, Jenny. All right. Who's next? Contestant number four, Jane. Jane. Make your way in. her normal, everyday bra and panties, I guess. She's got a towel wrapped around her. And she's got a little do-rag on her hair. Yeah, she's got a do-rag to protect her hair. That's kind of smart. She's a little shy. She's ducking into the barrel before she removes the towel. That's all right. Whatever the ladies want to do. I mean, this isn't a little sideshow. All right. You're going to keep the towel with you? I'll take it off once I'm in the barrel. Oh, OK. Or cycle more. Just turn the camera off and let her be at peace. All right. Very good. There she goes. Towel is off. Hold on. It's really twisted. Rick's getting pictures from above before they put the lid on. That's going to make some good viewing. Now, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Jane, put your hands on your ears when they fasten this down. OK, thanks. Because it's very loud, and that was hurting the girls' ears. OK. OK, go ahead. Put your hands over. Fill it up. There it goes. The metal clamp being put on. It is locked. All right. You can uncover your ears now. I think Kevin scared me on how well he's good at that. He looks a little too proficient about locking girls into 55 gallon drums. All right. I'm a little scared. Put the mic in the hole. Let's see how Jane's doing so far. Jane? Jane? Yeah? How you doing? OK so far. Do you think you're going to be able to do that? OK so far. Do you think you'll be able to last now that you know what the conditions are? Yes, I do. All right. Bang on the side of the barrel. Me? Yeah. OK. Very good. Our last girl getting in, the lovely Tabitha. Rick's whispering her name, Tabitha. I think we all know who she is. Oh, she just took her lingerie. Oh my Lord. That's... Oh wow. Oh my God. This is the really rough... This is really wrong, man. Just because she has the nicest lingerie, it's like who would dress like this for this event? Yeah. I'll lift you up. Yeah. Big Kev, I'm used to putting them in in two pieces. I'm not used to just holding the whole girl in at once. Hey, by the way, we're the guys that paid money to be here today. They should be in the studio. They get all access for the show today, man. Big Kev's like, this is no fun. The arms and legs matching all the same one barrel. They're all still in there. Usually they're mixed and matched. All right, Tabitha, any final words? This is no problem. My first apartment in New York was smaller than this. Oh! Telling jokes at everything. There you go. No crickets on that job. We got pictures of her? We got one right now as she's going. Get some pictures. There you go. Did you get one with her standing up too? Okay, good. She's ducking down, getting in position. She is in the barrel. Bye bye! Oh my God. Now, plug up your ears so it doesn't hurt your ears. Big Kev, once again, very proficient in locking girls in 55-gallon drums. That's good. Where do you want to bury? I know how to do this. Look at Christie's barrel. Come on. Is this even fair? It's not like the other. It's already tipping over on its side. Can I have a tissue? A tissue? Yeah. A tissue? All right. You won't get a tissue, you bitch. Look at Kate peeking out the hole, man. She's freaking. Get a picture of that, Rick. A picture of her peeking her head out the hole. Look at Kate. A little nervous. Look at all the girls. Look at their eyes. Look at their eyes looking through the holes. It's so sad. All right. Last time you saw eyes looking through stuff like that, it was like slots on a box car. It's really sad looking. And the girls are in their barrels. We're all out of the barrel. We're all in their barrels. We're all being thrust up fingers through the holes. All the girls in the barrel. And look at that, Obie. It is exactly 3 o'clock. Very good. So we have an exact start time here. Where's the guy that paid $1,000 to be here? What's your name, man? Pete Marquetos. Pete, thanks for the money. We appreciate it. You guys are welcome. We're watching a documentary. It's really insane. And we'll let you dump some crap in the girls. We'll let them do it. We'll let them do it all they want. Thanks a lot. Do you have any plugs or anything? No, no. Don't want to plug your business or nothing? Do you want to stick your junk through the side? Jane was a pretty good looking one. We're all very attractive, girl. Oh my God. Psycho Mark, get away from Christie's barrel. If something tells me any junk passes by there, it's going to be like a London broil in front of the Tiger Cay. All right, Ed. I guess we've got to take a break. Yeah, we'll take a break. And then with no further ado, I think we should really start the abuse. Yeah, run the camera down the hall so Scott can get those pictures on. I'm ready. Already done. Very good. Doug, what's going on? Hey, man. Hey. Unbelievable. Awesome. I'm sitting here in traffic, man. I'm about to piss my pants. I hope for the girls' sake they don't have to... I feel really bad because the girls now, they're poking their faces out the little holes to see what's going on. It doesn't look at us. It doesn't look at us. It rubs lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told. Goddamn it. This is twisted. When we come back from break, we'll start with... Are we going to really get hard and heavy from the beginning or are we going to start lightly? No, we'll start a little lightly. We'll start right after a shopping cart just full of stuff from the grocery store. All the stuff you pass by in the aisles and go, oh, I don't know who buys that and who eats that. All that stuff. We can have a little side contest, too. We can dump stuff in there and the girls have to figure out what it is. That's a good idea. For bonus prizes. Bonus prizes. Yeah, for bonus prizes. Yeah, like CDs and stuff. Why not? And also we're inviting the listeners to come down with their own stuff to throw in the barrel. Anyone have to cut one? Anyone have to throw anything? If anyone has to fart, you back up right to one of the holes in the barrel of your choice and let it rip. All right. Let's take a break and we start dumping stuff in the barrels next. Stay there. Powered by Opie and Anthony. By Infinity Broadcasting. This is 1027 WNEW. This is award winning broadcasting, Anthony. Oh yeah. Well, we'll get the Edward R. Murrow award for this one. What is he doing? What are you doing, Rick? Tabitha's barrel. He needed a sip of water, so you're pouring water in the hole into her open mouth? Yeah. Dude, how hot is that? It's very hot. It's very hot. I'm going to get a little wet. I'm going to get a little wet. Oh, I'm going to get a little wet. You're going to get a little wet. I'm going to get a little wet. You're going to get a little wet. You're going to get a little wet. You're going to get a little wet. Dude, how hot is that? Her husband's out there. Watch out, man. I just met her husband. I just put my foot in my mouth. Oh, did you? I go walking out of the studio. I'm like, man, that Tabitha's a piece of ass. And the guy goes, thank you. I'm like, why did you? Oh, no. He goes, I'm her husband. I'm like, oh, wow. Oh, dude. So then I put your foot in your mouth. So then I shook his hand and said, congratulations. Congratulations. What else do you say at that point? Hey, Doug, what's going on? Hey, guys, how many of these girls you got in those barrels? We got five. Five girls. Five girls. Five girls. Where you got these barrels? They're big plastic 55-gallon drums. Hey, can I get some to live in my house? Sicko. Guys, I'm listening to this show. This has got to be the most awesome thing you guys have ever done. This is a lot of fun today. Thank you, bro. Awesome, dude. Awesome. Hey, do we have a group shot of the barrels that we can put on the Internet? Scott Colombo's trying to get new pictures on. I'm going to go get them. I'm going to go get them. I'm going to go get them. I'm going to go get them. I'm going to go get them. I'm going to go get them. I'm going to go get them.

Hey, can I get some to live in my house? Sicko. Well, let's start dumping stuff in there. Hey, Jane. How are you doing? Kate. What's up? Hey, Tony. What's going on? Sicko. I was fishing this weekend and I had to work with the chum. This is the nastiest, most repulsive stuff I've ever smelled. These girls are going to have a port on them. Yeah. I was dry heaving to this stuff. It is so repulsive. These girls are ballsy, my man, and they get propped, definitely. All right, Tony. Thank you. Later, fellas. Hey, Anthony. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sure it was some snide comment. We've got $2,500 up for grabs, Anthony, to the lady that makes it all the way to seven. If they all make it to seven, they split the prize money and they're all getting certificates from Shrewsbury Bicycle, plus other stuff. We've got a concert, take a CD's and all sorts of crap. They've been in there for 10 minutes or so so far and nothing's been dumped on them. This is just a travesty. Yeah. I think we're all just feeling a little weird and I think we just got to do it. Do we have a remote mic I could use? Let me go over there. Go stay over here for now and hang. We'll take turns. Hey, Anthony. Am I on? Oh, I got headphones too? Yeah. Well, this is almost like a professional broadcast. Oh, look. Oh, my headphones don't work. Now it makes sense. There we go. Wow. Oh, I like this mic. Yeah. It makes me sound like Barry Wayne. All right. We're going to start the pouring festivities. Okay. We're going to start, I guess, like you'd start any party, with a couple of beers. Okay. All right. Some Budweiser. That's a waste of a mighty fine beer, Anthony. I'm not talking about pouring it. Oh. I'm drinking it. Okay. All right. Oh, look at Kate. She's looking. I feel so bad. She's looking through the hole and I'm like, oh, sad. You okay, Kate? Yeah, you all right? Oh, she, you know why? She got me. I'm like, oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a headache. Oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a headache. Oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a headache. Oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a headache. Oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a headache. All right. Oh, she, you know why? She holds the bottle in front of the hole. She's drinking a Bud in there. She doesn't care. All right. That might work against you, Kate, because you're going to have to pay if you drink beer. You got to get a mic on it. What are you saying? I think the stuff that'll be poured on me will probably be worse than that. Do you think so? Yeah. Worse than beer? Probably. Are you willing, if you really have to go to the bathroom, to just go in there? Just lay on myself? Yeah. I don't know. I can hold it. Who is? Who said I am? Put the mic over by Tabitha. No, Jane and Tabitha. Jane, are you willing to go to the bathroom on yourself? Yes, I am. And Tabitha, are you? No way. I have my standards. Forget it. All right. What about Christy? Are you willing to go to the bathroom on yourself? No. Sorry. No? Are you willing to go to the bathroom on yourself? I don't think so. No? No. I'm fine, so I'm all right. I just poured the beer on her head while she was talking. Notice I started with Wendy. How are you doing, Wendy? Oh, good for the hair. All right. Well, let's start dumping stuff in there. Let's go. All right. Christy, how are you doing? I'm good. I'm fine. How are you doing? I'm fine. I'm fine. You're fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Woohoo! Here, Mike the girl is getting stuff dumped in. Tastes good. Wow! There you go. A little bit of beer on Christy. All right. The festival has begun. Hey, Kate, how are you doing? Be kind. What? Be kind. Be kind? I'm trying to look through this hole here. Hey, how are you doing? How's that? How's that? Goddamn, this is fun. Oh my God. Watch. Watch. Yeah, there you go. She keeps trying to move away and I see where her head's going and I just dump it in the other hole. After a while, you're just going to have to give up because they're trying to avoid the stuff, Anthony, as your point. Wait. You know, Tabitha and, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do this. Wait, you know, Tabitha and, uh, who's the other one over there? They haven't gotten anything yet. Oh, yeah. All right. How you doing, Jane? Feeling good? All right. The squirming is starting. There's a lot of squirming going on. They're throwing it in there. They're so twisted. Okay, this is so... They're like squealing as you throw it in. They're trying so hard to avoid the flow. You hear that, Mo? It's just the gas. She's just like, ooh. All right, well, nothing better than the sound of a girl screaming in a 55-gallon drum. Pour that in. They are... Just to give you an idea, we're starting off very easy, right, Anthony? Beer and water. Beer and water right now. Alternating beer and water. How's everyone feeling? How we doing? Good. Yeah? I feel like I'm getting abused the most. Wait, wait, Wendy, what? I feel like I'm getting abused the most. How can you tell? You're not looking at anyone else. Yeah, I'm looking at everyone. All right, the guy who... You shut up or you'll get even more. Pete? Where are you from, Pete? New Jersey. And Pete from New Jersey who gave us $1,000 to hang with us today, he brought some stuff. He wants some ports and power. Girls, this might help you dry off a little bit. Kitty litter, Opie. Some kitty litter. Just get it all in there. There we go. Oh my God. There we go. Very good. Not too much of that because the dust might be a little bit much, I think. Water down it. They're coughing in there, Anthony. They're coughing. Yeah. Okay, a little... Well, yeah, yeah. We got to ease the dust down a little bit. What? What? You okay? Oh, this kitty litter in her beer. She's complaining. I like her. You think any serial killer would even give you beer? Who's coughing? The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. The coffee. They're coughing. They're coughing. Maybe you need a drink. Do we have any of that Sobe beverage over here? Yeah, give them a Sobe or some water or something. Yeah. Oh, now we give them the goggles, you idiots. Who's coughing? Wait, Jane? Oh, both of yous? Here, you want a Sobe? It's good stuff. Why did we start with the dusty cat litter? What, are you guys nuts? Okay, here you go. Make sure the ladies are okay before we move on, Anthony. Okay. Now it feels bad. You idiot. No, I don't feel bad. What's that? You need some drink? You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. You okay in there? Say their names so people can play along at home. Okay. Christy, you okay? I'm okay. You okay? I'm okay. Can we rinse out my cleavage? Rinse out your cleavage? Yeah, try that. A little Sobe beverage. Keep the water coming. Now the other girls, you know what you do? Turn the fan so it sucks out and put it on top of the thing. That should clear out. That's going to bring all the dust out. Yeah, just leave it alone. That sucks it through the sides. Leave it alone at this point. Yeah, just don't push any more of that in. Okay. All right, where are we at right now? Just pouring a little more wonderful Sobe elixir. So far we got Sobe, water, beer and cat litter in the barrels. And I got to say, judging from the sounds coming out of these barrels, these girls aren't really happy anymore. Really. Is anybody... Let me ask one at a time. Dusty, is your attitude changing on this whole thing? Not yet. Wendy? Not at all. All right, Kate? No more Dusty stuff. Kate, is your whole attitude on this thing changing since you started? All right. You're all right? My mouth. All right, Jane, how are you doing with this whole thing so far? This is pretty much what I expected. Okay, and Tabitha, you all right? No problem. Oh, all right. Okay. I think we have time to drop some more stuff in there. Oh, no, not like that. You've got to do it like this. All right, we are cracking raw eggs into the barrels now. Where is she? Breakfast is over. All right. Oh, yeah, that was good. Have a little shell. There you go. Oh, you heard that, right? What? Oh. What happened? What happened? Thank you. What happened? There's raw egg being broken and thrown in on top of them. Hey, Jane, how are you doing? If you've got three cases, just start throwing them in. Throwing some egg right on your head? Psycho Mark, I was ready to put the raw egg in one hole, and Psycho Mark saw her head poking through another hole, so he points at it and put it right over her head. And of course, Tabitha needs an egg. Now, you've got to break them, guys. You've got to break them in there. There you go. That was a good one. Very good. Oh, they're fighting back. They're fighting back. They're fighting back. That will just make your torture that much worse. Okay. That's a juget for fighting back. You know what's funny? Opie, the side holes, you take a plastic bottle of water and just put it through the side hole and squeeze it, and it just goes shooting everywhere. It's great. Perhaps you need some water. Let's get all the eggs in there. Get all the eggs in there. Let's break them all and get them all in there. We've got three cases of eggs going in. All right, Anthony, we should take a break. Oh, my God. Opie, you should get in on this. This is really fun. I don't want to take a break. This is fun in the sickest way ever. Now the guys are just cracking eggs all over these girls. The eggs are going in four or five at a time at this point. It's the 55-gallon drug challenge, Anthony. That'll teach you to stick your face through the holes. Hey, what's she doing? She's fighting back. Tabitha's spirit must be broken, Opie. She's fighting back. Another egg right in her head. All right, she's coming down now. Tabitha's trying to throw stuff back through the hole. Now they're mixing the cat litter and the raw eggs together. Let me get that egg. Hold on, hold on. Egg effect! All right, do the side. I think you broke her spirit, Anthony. No, I don't think so. She's pretty rambunctious. You know what the best way to do it is? If you gently crack the egg, get hold it in the shell, and then wail it through the side. I got a little on me. I learned it from you, Psycho Mark, okay? Yeah, this is a little too much fun. All right, as the guys continue with the raw eggs, why don't we go down the line and see how all the ladies are doing before we go to break here. Okay, right before we go to break, Tabitha, Tabitha, how you doing? No problem. Tabitha still says, no problem. Jane, you, you okay? I'm fine, thank you. She's fine. Kate? Just banding. Are you taking a lot of hits with these eggs? They're loud and they're hitting me in the face. They're loud and they're hitting her in the face, Opie. Wendy, how you doing? All right, you should see it in here, though. Is it like a crime scene? Oh, disgusting. It is a disgusting mess in there. We've just begun. And of course, Kristy, how are you holding up? Well, I found out one egg and Kitty let her make a great exfoliant. She's exfoliating in there, Opie. Okay, yeah, let's take a break. So many things to keep track of, all the stuff we put in there thus far. And what have we dumped in there so far, if you can remember? So far, there's been, we started with beer, water, intermittent spurting of water, some Sobe, eggs, Kitty litter. Yeah, that's about it so far. We have just begun. All right, we've got to take a break. Bye, man. I've got to go clean off. Oh, this is disgusting. I have some on my hand. All right, we're putting a ton of pictures up on www.com. The website's getting pounded. Just remember to keep hitting refresh so you can get the latest pictures, okay? Also, we're doing a wow sticker stop today. Starting at 4 o'clock at New Rochelle, Toyota. Gorilla Boy, Jeff Norris, we'll be there handing out the brand new wow stickers just in time for this fine weekend we're going to have. New Rochelle, Toyota is located on Cedar Street, 47 Cedar Street in New Rochelle across from the Ramada Inn. So make sure you stop by and get your wow stickers. We'll be back. Stay there. The Opie and Anthony Show. Throne men jumping all over each other. Okay, terrific. 1027, 7-1-E-W. Hey, Anthony Pizzano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. You'll love it. We love Pizzano. Down there all the time, romance of Italy, warm, relaxed restaurant. Incredible authentic Italian cuisine made from old world Italian recipes. Perhaps we'll throw some old world Italian recipes in the barrels on top of the girls. We should be nice guys and get some gift certificates or something that we can give them too. I'm sure Joey would come through. Well, portions of Pizzano, huge, as huge as Christie. Yeah. Oh, come on. Incredible pasta lunch specials too.

Yeah. $2,500 up for grabs. Got a Shrewsbury Bicycle as well. Thank you, Shrewsbury Bicycle. I had to go into the bathroom and sponge off a little, Hopi. It was disgusting. I got a little egg on my hand and it was getting sticky. And then I did get some on my pants too, so I don't know. It was really disgusting. What are they pouring on the ladies now? A little water going into the barrels. You hear them squeak every so often. I'm going to go back over to the barrels to get on my remote mic. But I've got to get a remote mic. I've got to get in on this too. Buffalo Bill from West Islip. Psycho Mark, don't stick the butterflies down their throats just yet. All right. Here we are. Donald from White Plains. Remember, Christy was talking about emptying out her cleavage, whatever? Rinsing out her cleavage? Well, Donald says to rinse out Christy's cleavage, you would have to reroute the Hudson River. Oh, my God. That's not nice. Come on. All right, girls. We have another mic over there. I want to... You're doing all right? Wendy, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. All right, everyone's okay. Tabitha, good? Yeah. Jane? I'm all right. Okay, everyone's good. Kate? Dandy. Dandy. They're not sounding as chipper as they were, but that's okay. And they got what? Three and a half hours to go, Anthony. Yeah. All right, don't tell them what's being dumped in. See if they can guess. We're opening up the next group of stuff. All right. Well, they're looking out. Oh, yeah. Out the holes. They could figure it out in a way. So, hey, hey, how you doing? Oh, look, you're covering up. How you doing, Kate? Good? Yeah. You like that? Yeah. That's nasty. Hey, Wendy. Hey, Jay. How's that? Yeah. That's pretty good. Christy? Yeah. We don't forget about you. Hey, you're right. This is fun. Tabitha. Hey, Christy didn't really make that much of a noise. Tabitha talking anymore? You should see the inside of this thing. This is so funny. Hey, Jane. How you doing? Banana juice. What happened? All right. There goes the what happened, Jane? I just got some in my mouth. Well, Anne, I guess we could tell everyone we just poured a ton of corn oil. We just poured a ton of corn oil. We just poured a ton of corn oil. We just poured a ton of corn oil. Well, Anne, I guess we could tell everyone we just poured a ton of corn oil in. She's got it in her mouth. Yeah, okay. I don't think Christy has enough. You have to increase on Christy a little more. There you go. We got some through the holes like that. It is a mess in the studio, man. Yeah, it's really, really a mess. And I got the next ingredient. What is that? Let me look. Right on Kate's hair. Gross. That is gross. All right. Let's go to Christy. I got some over here. Did you get Wendy yet? Wendy. Wendy, you get any of this yet? It's lotion. It rubs the lotion on and skittles the hose again. That smells good. All right. Yeah, that's the nicest thing we've dumped into the town so far. so far Anthony, some lotion. That's not bad. So we got the oil in there. Wait, heavy out that oil. Come on. Oh, there's only a little left. Who should get it? I think Tabitha got enough oil. Kate got it in the face though, right? Yeah. Was that Kate? Did you get it in the mouth? Oh, that was Jane. Oh, then here you go Kate. You all right? All right. Very good. Are the listeners starting to show up upstairs? Yeah. Did they bring anything interesting? Bringing their own little goodies. Some eggs, some other guys have brought some other things. The egg's a very popular item. I'll bring them down in just a little bit to also dump their stuff. All right, very good. Oh, this is nice. Look at what we got here. Give me one of those. Look what we got here. Okay, we got our sexy radiant. Oh my God. Hello, Wendy. I see you with your hands and the lotion and everything. How you doing? Is that nice and smooth? Yeah, thanks. This, I hear, is good for your hair. Oh, did she curse? No. All right, I'm back near the board. Okay, Kate. Hey, what is that? They're dumping V8. Oh, it's like V8-er. Yeah, it's exactly what it is. It's V8. Little V8. All right. Hey, hey, Kristy, what's up? How you doing? I'm doing good. Oh, it's warm. Oh, yeah. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. It's warm and slippery. Yes, it's V8. It's V8. Look into it. All right, and of course, Tabitha, how you doing? Oh, are you holding up? Oh, okay. You're holding up okay? Yeah. God, it sounds disgusting. Now it's like puddling up on the bottom so they're just hanging out in this crap. Hey! All right, we good? The sounds have come out. It's just great, man. Yeah. And talk to the girls while the other guys, you know, pour the stuff. All right. Let's see how they feel. Let's start with Kristy. Kristy doesn't seem to mind any of this. No. You okay, Kristy? That's right. I care. He's insensitive. Oh, my God. Wait, wait. What's putting two? Two friggin' mics in on the barrel at once. Yeah, if you don't have headphones on, don't move the mics around. All right, they're throwing stuff back at us. All right. Tabitha's rambunctious. And start again with Kristy. Kristy, you're okay, right? Yes. And you don't mind any of this? No, this is cool. It's cool. You know what though? Kristy, even though she's a bigger girl, has a lot more headroom in there than the other girls do. All right. Then she should get more stuff thrown at her. Yeah. Wendy, how you holding up? Okay. Okay. Is that disgusting? No, it's not disgusting. I just have to try not to scream so it doesn't get in my mouth. Okay, I hear you. All right, they're just pouring like Kate, you okay? You're all right? I feel like I'm backing Kyle. Yeah, she's doing all right. Jane, how are things in your barrel? I can't see through my goggles anymore. That's a shame. That's a shame. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's a shame. That's too bad. It tag teamed her, that one, through the holes with two things. Now Tavis is back. I'm a little afraid to get in the air. She is truly the badger of this group. She's throwing things back. She's getting a little nasty. And she's like a monkey at the zoo throwing feces back at us, you know? Throwing feces. So I think the only way to really cure that is with applesauce. There you go. How's that working for you? Jane, you need some applesauce? There you go. The ingredients are starting to mix nicely in the barrels. Oh yeah, that's Kate. The studio is starting to smell a little bit. A little. There you go. Hey Wendy, what's up? Nothing. How's that? Oh. That was not... She might have enjoyed that. And of course, Christy, applesauce coming in. You might want to open up. Very good. Very good. Not much left after that. Okay. What? No cinnamon? No. Yeah. We'll put a little of that in. What is that? A little more sobe. Sobe. Thank you, sobe. I had to wash it down. Sobe is great. Okay. Wow, they are really... They are in a mess at this point. Oh, oh. Okay. A little more of that. You might need that. God, we're just getting more and more stuck. I know. This is so much fun. Girls? And that's part of the other things. Wendy, are you thinking at all about pulling out so far? Absolutely not. Oh. Christy, you? Not yet. No? Kate, how are you doing? Are you thinking at all about pulling out of this? I'm fine. She's fine. She's now thanking... I've heard hostages do this sometimes. They start liking their captors. Jane, are you thinking about any second thoughts now? You might want to get out. Oh, no. I'm sure it's doing wonders for my skin. Okay. And of course, Tabitha, any thoughts about getting out of this thing at this point? I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Not yet. Not yet? Not yet. Oh, she doesn't sound the same anymore, Anthony. No, not at all. See, she made the mistake of fighting back. Yeah. Psycho Mark just turned over a big thing of V8 right on top of the barrel, and it's just pouring in the holes now. All right. Anthony. Maybe we could pop this top off. Anthony, ask the ladies what it smells like in the barrels at this point. Yeah, how is Tabitha really bad? Let me ask Tabitha something, if I may. Tabitha? They are really bad. What does it smell like in there? Oh, man, I don't know. A lot of different things, dude. Yeah? You know what? I don't see any girls named Mary here, OP. No. How about we just make big bloody Marys out of all of them? We've already had the V8, right? And now how about a little Worcestershire sauce? Oh, that'll make it smell nice, Jane, a little bit. That'll mix well with the castor. Wendy. Oh, Wendy. And oh, yeah. Christy, a little Worcestershire for you? That stuff really stinks. All right. Hey, ask Jane what it smells like in the barrel. Jane, what do you think it smells like in there? Well, at first it was the overwhelming stench of tomato juice, but now it's the overwhelming stench of Worcestershire sauce. Yeah, that Worcestershire is hard. Kate, what do you think? It's smelling pretty bad in there? It's better than all the other mixtures. The Worcestershire washes it all out. The Worcestershire washes it all out. Wendy, stinking in there or what? It's disgusting. It's disgusting. And Christy, what do you think? It smells like a steak. It smells like another food reference from Christy. Very nice. Too fitty in her big landscaper barrel. It really stinks. And come back over here. I can only imagine being in a closed spot. Oh, were you flinging something at me, Kate? Kate, were you just flinging something at me? No. Your fingers didn't just, no. I think she was flinging something at me. She must pay now. You must pay, Kate. A little more beer. On Kate. They must learn. Ben is running out of the studio to get more stuff, Anthony, to throw in there. All right, I'm going to come back over to my mic. As Ant makes his way over here, so far, if I'm keeping track of this, we've got eggs in there, sobe, beer, water, kitty litter, V8, lotion, corn oil, and steak sauce. Ladies, just so you know, you are only 44 minutes into this whole thing. That's it. We're going to have to put in something very nasty soon. So far, they are really putting up with all this. Tabitha just fighting back. I think every hour-end is when we throw in something really nasty. Every hour. So at 4 o'clock, it could be the sour milk. It could be the chum. At 4 o'clock, it could be the fox. At 4 o'clock, we start getting really nasty, ladies. Or it could be the rats. What? What? All right, let's go to the phones. People are losing it. Doug, what's going on? Hey, Doug. Hey, what's up? How are you, buddy? Listen, three real quick things. One, I just want to say, look what I did to you now. Again. Again. Yeah. And the other thing is I'm doing the same thing to my housekeeper in the basement. Yeah. I want to keep real good track of what you're putting in there. So make sure you go slow when you read the list. All right. And I keep picturing that Bugs Bunny cartoon. Which one? When he becomes like the soup. I keep throwing it into the bucket. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys rock. Thank you. W and E double. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom.

As a matter of fact, when we get back from break, we're going to throw something really nasty that something really hannis. That may make one of the ladies quit, Anthony. They're doing the challenge for $2,500. Cold hard cash. Cold hard cash. All right. It really stinks in here. I know. It does, right? Yeah, absolutely. How are you guys doing? I can only imagine what it would be like in a closed barrel. Right. I mean, I couldn't imagine it. Are you guys all having fun checking this out? Oh, yeah. All right, Anthony. All right. Let's let's take a break. So gross. Let's play the serial killer song. Very appropriate today. Yes. And we'll be back. Stay there. I made quite a splash. I hacked and I slashed my way to the top of page one. The cops even checked, but they didn't suspect. I was carving up fellers for fun. Guess I never thought I'd finally get caught. I hope that they all rest in peace. Cause I'm locked away. What more can I say? Except what I told the police. Oh, I got friends in crawlspace. I got arms and legs and a few faces stashed all around in different parts of town. Well, I met them in bars on a friendly basis. Now I got them in jars and flower bases. Oh, I got friends in crawlspace. I know I was wrong. I just don't belong. I guess you've heard that one before. But the guys, they all dig me. I'm like Eleanor Rigby. There's a face in a jar by my door. I must be insane. Got an abnormal brain. What else could I do to get laid? The guys that I date had a terrible fate. They ended up lightly sauteed. Oh, I got friends in crawlspace. Is every shape and size and all races all blood and goods. Man, I must be nuts. Well, I got one that'll really kill you. I'm the poster child for necrophilia. Oh, I got friends in crawlspace. Oh, they're really good. Well, I got friends in crawlspace. I'm the b**** that made Milwaukee famous. Oh, I got friends in crawlspace. Oh, my God, it's starting to stink in here. Anthony, the razor roller board scooter from Sharper Image. Yes, we love these things. I drove in today and saw a couple on 57th Street.

Are we having fun yet, guys, or what? Yes, if you're just tuning in, it's the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony. Lots of great pictures on the WNEW.com website. Oh, yeah, I was just looking through them. They're pretty tragic when you just see a hole in the side of a barrel with a sad eye poking out of it. And maybe the other hole next to it has a couple of fingers, a couple of gooey fingers hanging out of it. It's kind of frightening. We've got to thank Scott Colombo working his ass off down the hall for the show. Thank you, Scott, for putting those pictures up really quick. The pictures are at WNEW.com, not at our Foundry Music site. A lot of people seem confused. Yeah, no, we'll get some stuff over to Steve after the festivities. Psycho Mark is taking a lot of great video for that, so don't worry about that. Go to WNEW.com today. There's Anthony. There's Anthony dumping some beer into one of the barrels. Yes. We've got 30 pictures up so far, Anthony. Yeah, it's going to be hundreds by the time we're done today. We've got fans in here. We've got the vacuum going. Right when you walk in, because I went to the office during the break for a little bit, right when you walk down the hall into the whole studio area, it smells like a steakhouse. It smells like a... It just smells like a whispershear. Yeah, that's all I smell right now. But that smells about to change drastically. Yes, it is, because it is the first hour of the competition. We've got four little challenges every hour. We're going to put something really, really nasty into the barrel. We've got to get some of these girls out of here, man. Yeah, this is just nothing. This is food products. I think they're getting lulled into a false sense of security. Well, you quiet them down, Anthony. They were a little out of function. They were a little rowdy at first. Damn you! Yeah. Damn you! But they're not saying much these days. They're kind of just mellowing out. Let me get over by the barrels again. All right. And I've got to say, we put the steak sauce in, hand lotion, V8 beer, kitty litter, water, sobe, eggs, and I believe corn oil. I think that's all we've put in thus far. Yeah, that's about it. Oh, my God. I see the assortment of goodies up here. And our special secret surprise. The secret surprise is going to enter the studio in about five minutes. All right, Anthony, let's make sure none of this gets dumped over. Why don't we get an update from the ladies? Okay, they've been simmering, marronading, as you will, for the entire break. Christy, how are you doing? I think I'm fully marinated. Thank you. You're feeling good? Yes. There's no chance of you backing out as of yet? No, none at all. All right. Anthony, this just in from the instant feedback. Christy's not making any noise because she's eating whatever's being poured into the barrel. Jesus Christ. People are awful. I can't. I've got my hands at the top. Yeah, I see that. Okay. Wendy? Yes? Wendy? Yes? How are you, Wendy? All right. Yeah? It's so nasty in here, but it's not going to get any out of it. Can I ask you how much liquid is at the bottom of your drum? Oh, I can't even see my toes. Really? It's just a big slimy slush pit that you're sitting in? So many colors in here. Every time I move, it just squishes. Yeah. Well, she's still motivated. Wendy's still in this game, Anthony. Yeah, I know. By the way, OK Terrific is pointing out that everyone has to drink if you're playing the ONA drinking game. I did do an impression today. Thank you. Oh, what did you do? I did the, it puts the lotion on. Oh, okay. Yeah, drink. Drink. It was a good one. So, Kate? Yeah? I'm fine. I'm all right. You're not thinking of backing out? No. No, huh? Definitely not. And you have a lot of sludge in the bottom of your barrel, I would gather? Yeah, quite a bit. I'm trying not to look, though. Why? It's making you sick? Probably. Wait, now Kate was the one we thought would drop out first. She's sounding a little more positive now. She is. Things change. Things change. And Jodie Foster checking in from Washington, D.C. We at the FBI are putting together a profile of you two as we speak. That's not too hard to do. Hey, Jane. Yes? How you doing? I'm all right. Yeah? Yeah, the steak sauce was kind of rough, though. That was rough? It burned. It burned? Yeah, we've got to stay away from the stuff that burns. I was thinking that, too. How does steak sauce burn? Well, it got in my eyes. Yeah, that's awful. I thought you had your goggles on. There's holes in the top. What's that, Wendy? It doesn't work. The goggles right there. Oops. We're cheap around here. We've got the cheapest goggles. Look, you're not getting hacked up. And of course, Tabitha. Tabitha? Tabitha? Yeah,IS having trouble. Tabitha's character has drastically changed. Tabitha, you are the perky one. You are really a psych for this. Now I'm detecting a change in your voice. How are you doing? No, no. No problem. She's not as happy. No, you were fighting back. Oh, I had to hear that. and you paid the price for that. Yeah, that's it. You're flinging it like a monkey flinging feces from his cage at the zoo. And you're having to be reprimanded. I would bet money she has more stuff at the bottom of the barrel than anyone. How much goop do you have at the bottom of your barrel? It's about six inches. Everyone else, their toes are barely covered. Yeah. Because she's up to six inches. I can see her bra. It used to be nice white color. Not anymore. You haven't had a really nice lingerie. Now it's a different color. How are you doing in there? I look like Carrie. Oh my God. She looks like Carrie. Oh God. We've just begun. It's only the first hour, girls. And this just in, I was just talking to the boss, Bruce Springsteen, and he's outraged and he's writing a song called Locked in a Barrel. Come on. Cool. All right. Okay. Well, one thing I've noticed with everything that we've dumped in there so far, it all has a common denominator in that it is not very sticky. Right. Nothing we've dumped in so far has really been sticky. They could probably, as we dump water in, just brush their hands over their head and wash off a lot of the stuff that we've dumped in there. This must end. Start over there. Okay. I won't say what it is yet, but it is an old favorite, isn't it? Yes, it is. Yes. Let's go over to Tabitha. Tabitha, how are you doing? Close your mouth. Oh, you're over there. Don't look up at me. Oh, gosh, she's not liking that. What is this? She's saying it. A lot of ewes. Isn't that disgusting? She's not happy. This is bad, right? It's got to be enough. No, no, there's plenty for everybody. I just made a beer. We have a full bottle for everyone. There you go. This is only 55 gallons. You're enjoying this way too much. That was good. Let's go to Jane. Jane, are you ready? Yes. Okay, here it comes. Yuck. Oh, my God. It's syrup. It is, of course, Aunt Jemima syrup. Yes. Oh, my God, I hate sticky. I hate sticky. I couldn't imagine this stuff all over me. Kate, how are you doing? I'm all right. You ready for this? There we go. Isn't that lovely? Does that feel good? Is it sticky? Actually, it smells better than the worst this year. Yeah, it does smell better, but believe me, after a few minutes when that stuff starts crystallizing on you, that's going to be pretty bad. I would forget about your sense of smell because that's going to drastically change. Wendy's up. Why don't we put the mic right there? How are we doing? You're doing okay? Okay. Are you trying to avoid me? No. No? Let me just dump a little in all the holes. It's so funny, and I've got to explain this. There's like six holes on the top of each drum, and the girls, they can look through one hole, and they're moving around trying to avoid the liquid as you pour it in the different holes. Hey, Kristy. Now we're up to Kristy. How are you doing? Good. That clutch sucks. Wow, look at her. She's like, oh, this is a perfect vantage point. How's that? Oh, that feels very odd. Oh, gross. That is gross. Oh, my God, that's gross. Okay. Aunt Jemima syrup. What are you pouring in there now? A little water. A little water. They need a little more water. Well, you know something? Water just doesn't wash away syrup. I like Mima syrup. What do we got next for the ladies? How about these? What do you think? Yes. Oh, God. The smell is going to drastically change. Ladies, this isn't the really disgusting stuff still. This is all just edible stuff. Right. All right. Let me talk for a second. The disgusting stuff is getting prepared outside the studio. Any of you girls ever seen the movie Tommy? How about this? Oh, God. Oh, gross. Wait, talk to Wendy. She's freaking out. Wendy, how are you doing? What's the matter? You all right? Oh, that's disgusting. What? I thought we were all having fun. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. She did not like that one, Anthony. No, that really affected Wendy. We don't want to give away what we've got. No, not yet. I think everyone can figure it out. All right, we're going to go to Christy over here. Hey, Christy, what's up? I'm not looking up. Oh, I'm looking at it through the hole. That is so sick. That is disgusting. Okay. All right, let's move on. Yeah, let's go. Who do we got here? Kate? Hey, how are you doing, Kate? I'm all right. Don't worry, because we're going to dump it right on Tabitha. The surprise. Tabitha. I was supposed to be last for a reason. No, see, I mixed the order up. It screwed them up. Okay. Who will it be? Jane or Kate? Hmm. Jane or Kate? Eeny, meeny, miny, miny. That's what serial killers do. They taunt their prey. How are you doing, Kate? What's up? Jane, how are you doing? I'm fine, thanks. You've heard the reaction of the other girls to this. It's pretty bad. It doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't, does it? No, no, no. You can skip me if you'd like. We'll skip you. All right, we'll go with Kate first. No, we won't. Oh, my God. Okay. Big beans being dumped on the girls. And one more can. Guess who's left, Kate? You. How are you doing? Are you covering your face? Ant, ant, ant, ant. Yeah. Just remind me of something. Do your scream voice. Hello, Sydney. Hey, what's up? I'm looking in the hole trying to get a good vantage point. That looks good. That looks good. Thank you. Right in the do. What the hell is that? What do you think? Sloppy Joe? Sloppy Joe. Sloppy Joe's waiting to come in. Wait until you see what he's got for you. Okay. The whole can. The whole can. Very good. All right. Big beans, Sloppy. That's what it was. Yes. And we're full of big beans. Let's get one more thing in there and then we'll bring in the surprise from outside. This is really, really bad because like I said before, I don't like sticky. Yeah. The Antimimus Syrup would have been great. This has got to be the worst thing yet. We only have two jars of this. Okay. I have to divvy it up. Yeah. Divvy it up. All right. Hey, Wendy. She goes, oh, shh. I know. She just cursed. She tried. How are you doing? You feeling that? What is that? Get the mic her. Ew. Ew. Wendy's saying, yes, ew. Okay. Ew. Without warning. Ew. Ew. They're not fighting as much anymore, Ann. It's just big globs. It is big globs. Hey, what's up? Oh, that's not a honey. Oh my God. Ding, ding, ding. Winner. Winner, honey. And you know something? That's the end of the first jar. But since you identified what it was, give me the other one. You get a little extra. There we go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There we go. That's good. We got. Who have I forgotten so far? Jane. Oh, I almost. Jane. Jane, I almost forgot you. Look at that. Damn me. How could I forget? That's pretty bad, huh? Oh, God, is that sticky? And of course, Christie. Christie, what's up? How are you doing? Waiting for the gutsy stuff. How's that? I would flow so slowly and you're putting it between my fingers. Ah! God! I'm just going to stay in between my toes, okay? Hey, Ann. Ann, ask Christie how many of the ingredients she's tried so far. Have you eaten anything that's gone in there, Christie? No, I haven't. I'm sorry. Ladies and gentlemen in the studio, please keep your hands and feet away from the hopper at all times. Right. Hey, Ann, Tom from Woodridge. Hey, guys, any chance of me getting a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little. Move around a little. There we go! to the stuff we put in. I can't get it off but it's still like ugh. I can't even describe it. See, it won't come off, Opie. It won't come off. I know. Look, I have a full thing of really cold water here and I'm just going to pour it in Jane's barrel. Oh, lovely! Hahaha! But it doesn't wash off. It's not washing off. No! I can't wait to see the after pictures of these girls. We got the before pictures on ndw.com. When they step out of these barrels it's going to be pretty funny to make the contrast. Alright, it! Woo! Look at Jane Hayden! Now they're screaming, now they're squealing. Hahaha! Dumped in a lot more water in there. Really cold water. Mix it up a bit. Woohoo! Hahaha! Okay. Alright. Oh! Hahaha! Anthony, we are time. It is time for the first surprise. Yes! We have three, maybe four surprises today. Mm-hmm. These are the things that are going to decide. Yeah. You know, the stuff we've been pouring in as of yet is one thing. This! Alright, oh, this is a deciding factor. Let's not keep this uncapped too long. Alright, hold on. Put the cap back on so we're ready to utilize. Alright, wait, wait, wait. This is how we got to do it. We want all the ladies to be surprised at the same time, okay? Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't take it. Alright, listen, we want all the ladies to be surprised at the same time so we need five guys over the barrels with the surprise to drop in at the exact same time. Oh!

We the last thing was the uh, huge kissing cockroaches And really and they they took it and uh, you know, that was it when when we had no more to give We had them out of there. We got them out of the barrels Yeah, they would all lasted to seven at that point I was sure that uh one of the three that were left were gonna Just freak out and say get me out of here. Wendy was so close. Did you hear her? I mean obviously, uh, you know us we'll play that 800 times I gotta hear her scream enough because that was authentic screams of horror.

Oh look who's in the studio Well, we got christy Is in the studio christy any regrets of um, uh wait get that mic grab that mic that works right now any regrets, uh Getting out of the barrel early Yeah, oh really? Oh, you're starting to regret it a little bit Oh, I regretted as soon as I said it but I couldn't say I yeah, I had to pass out. You're feeling better now Yeah, I would have gotten out and passed out and then you'd have to deal with me I am amazed at the the strength that uh, will you girls have because no f in way I would have been crying like a baby in there Oh when the bugs started coming in, I mean, oh, yeah Let's talk to the other the girls that had to deal with the hissing cockroaches, uh tabitha. Yeah tabitha was looking very uh, Pretty again. All you girls are looking pretty again. It's amazing what a little water will do Yeah, so so so what was going on three ahead when you're in that barrel Oh god, just get it over with and get us out of here as soon as possible. Basically, I mean there's no way you can Spin it and make it be a pleasant experience Right the first live bugs were the uh, not cockroaches the crickets right now All you girls thought they were biting you like biting bugs or something. Yeah when they're crawling on your skin Well, they have those little like things on their legs and when they crawl on you it feels a little pinchy Yeah, yeah, and then there were the meal worms and wax worms Of various types of maggot and larvae Larva larvae that was all over the uh girls How did those feel on you? Those weren't quite as bad because you you didn't look at them You really didn't know that they were right and I heard a lot of slapping who was no that was you No, no what? Jane right? What were you doing? Uh to try to get these bugs away from you? I just slapping them off me or you were slapping them killing them and that was the sickest sound coming from the bars I mean the screaming was sick But when you can hear the slapping of water just trying to kill bugs water. No, it was a slapping of goo goo It was very disgusting and then of course the grand finale the huge hissing cockroaches Uh now a couple of you didn't even know that that you that they were on you No, we knew they were on us. Did you know what they looked like and what they were? Did you know they were big? No, no. Yeah, i've seen enough of those nature shows to know exactly what that was crawling on me And let me tell you that was so awful. Really if that wasn't the last thing I probably would have hopped out Oh, really? Uh-huh. Look at that. Well, we couldn't think of anything else besides maybe live rats That was really bad.
