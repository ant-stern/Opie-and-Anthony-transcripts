 The O.B. and Anthony Show! Other debauchery on the way, stay there. 1027 W.M.E.W. 212-757-1027 is our phone number. It's the O.N.A. Show! How are ya? We had a run down the hall, we were watching Caddyshack in the office. You're getting nothing in like it. I've only seen it twice this week so far. Very funny, very funny. Let's go to Robert. Robert, what's going on today? Hey, hey Robert. Yeah, what's up? Talking to you. I can't believe you guys didn't get laid at the prom. Wow. Who said that? I never went to a prom. And never went to his prom. I went to my prom with a 15 year old girl. I was 18 and yeah, I did not get any action. Man, I really feel sorry for you guys. A little kissy face, I think I might have touched Patch. Prom night, that's about it. Really? At least I'll admit it. Oh man, I had a heart, dude. Dude, once in a bad way. Geez, we've been on the air like a few minutes and you're cursing already. Sorry. So you're a bigger man than me because you had your dates dress up overhead. Congratulations. I suck and you rock. Huh? Robert, the fact is most people don't get action at their prom. I find that hard to believe. Mark? I used to have a limousine service, man. Those kids used to give me big money to walk away from the car for a while. Are you talking about your prom or like the prom you went to last week? Oh my God, I'm going to freak out already. First call, let's just take a breath, write it off and move on. Move on. Mark, you're next on WNAW. How are you? Hey, how are you doing? OK? What's up? Love your show. I got a prom story. You might not believe it but I sort of got it. It's true. I graduated in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I went to an English school in Port-au-Prince and at our prom we all had our dates and we all drove our own cars and stuff. We ended up not getting any so like me and like four or five of my best friends hopped in my 83 Honda Civic station wagon and got us five hookers. We all banging the hookers on my trunk, on my hood, on the side. We found out at the end that the guy who promised to pay for it was broke so we didn't have no money to pay for them. They ended up chasing us down, throwing rocks at us and stuff. We driving off leaving them where we were at. We parked like by a hill somewhere and they're like breaking my windows and stuff and we trying to jet with our pants down, tuxes on. It was a mess man. That's what you get for not getting any at the prom. So you got hookers at your prom? Yeah, we got four prostitutes and didn't pay them. All the way in Haiti. Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Swear to God. Well I believe it. Anyone could happen in Haiti. I didn't even know they had proms in Haiti. You went to an English school in Haiti. Yeah, American school. And you guys had a prom. Yeah, like back in 87. I'm 30 now and yeah the story is crazy. I still remember like it was yesterday. Right on man. Wacky Haiti. Congratulations. Love your show. Hey thank you. Alright. Alright let's go to Neil. Hey Neil you're next on N.E.W. How are you? Hey what's going on guys? I think most people don't get action on prom night. I tried for eight hours in my prom to get some. Nothing happened. She wouldn't even let me kiss her. Yeah, because most people go to the prom with someone they don't even really know that well. I made the mistake of going with a girl who was my best friend. I thought she'd give it up easier. Yeah right. No such luck there. When you have a friend that's a girl when you're in high school you never got action off them. I got it one night on a weekend camping trip and that was it. I thought maybe the prom would be the lucky night. Yeah. You know what it would have been better off staying home watching Caddyshack. Alright thank you Neil. Anytime. Syndication when Mark finds a real female fan. Speaking of that there are some great pictures from yesterday's show on the unofficial ONA website. I got to pop that one. Foundrymusic.com and I think we're going to replay that segment today because it's too good. It was really uncomfortable. Yeah and the pictures are great. You know something I don't know how you can tell. I don't care how good they look. How could you not tell it's a guy. Yeah the face was a dead giveaway. Especially the hands. I didn't see the hands. Oh my god. It was just big man hands. You could palm a basketball. Really? That guy could have palm the basketball. We talked to Mark at the show. He had no clue. Big feet. Big feet. No clue. I mean and the voice. Dead giveaway. People on the instant feedback that could just hear it were going oh my god. Guy. That was cool. A lot of the listeners were in on this one because Psycho Mark didn't really get to hear us interview her on the phone. Yeah. I mean the longer you listen to her you know you can tell that it's a guy. So all the listeners were in on it. Psycho Mark was in the other studio too busy to be listening to the show. So by the time we got him in here to talk for a quick I mean we made it really quick. Like a minute. We were able to get away with it. We got. There's a photo up on WNAW.com as well. That's a guy. You can tell on Psycho Mark's face though he has no clue. She's a supermodel. Yeah remember. I can't wait to replay it today because we'll make sure everyone knows what's going on before we play it and listen to all the funny lines Mark was coming up with. Oh she's a supermodel. Look at. Hey Mark what do you think of her ass. Oh it's great. I'm looking. It's obvious. Come on. Come on now. Oh straddling Psycho Mark. I'm going through the pictures real quick. Yeah. Oh the boob in the face. Yeah. Actually boob the man chest. The man chest that probably had like razor stubble. There's a. Scraping against the side of Mark's face. There's Psycho Mark sitting there with the tranny squatting down on his junk. Yeah. And then he's like. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. That's our unofficial ONA website. There she is kind of dancing for Psycho Mark. Yeah. No, it's going to be great. Later on when we replay the segment, you can play along at home with the pictures. Be interactive radio for you. Yeah. You could go along with... There's the lap dance that Psycho Mark's getting. Oh my God. Get the picture of her, him, whatever, sucking his finger. That's a good one. What number is it? Number eight? No, that's like the chick, the hee shee on... Oh, there it is. Yeah, the sucking of the finger. All right. And look at the Adam's apple. Yeah, it's just like... Yeah, there's a huge Adam's apple. I mean, that's the giveaway right there. That is a dead giveaway. You always look for the Adam's apple. Dead giveaway. John, what's going on? John, what's going on? You know, as soon as I heard this one voice yesterday, I knew off the bat that it was definitely a guy. That's what was so cool about that. You could hear it, and I'm saying, can he tell... how could a girl that looks this good have a voice like that? That's what was so cool about it, because Psycho Mark didn't hear that part. And then when we got her back on the phone while we were taking a break, Rick was telling her, you know, to sound more, you know, feminine. Yeah, because as soon as you heard that voice, you knew right off the bat. How could a girl that's a gorgeous blonde have a voice like that and be gorgeous? Because the funny thing is, the instant feedback in the phone is just going nuts. People are like, oh no, I know what this is all about. Yeah, yeah. And then everyone on the phone screen here is like, it's a guy, it's a guy. And we're hanging up on everyone because we didn't want Psycho Mark to see the screen. Yeah, I knew that's why you weren't putting any call-less proof, because you didn't want to give it up. No, not at all. Take care, guys. All right. One of the listeners hit it on the head. They said, we knew something was up when the girl or the guy, whatever, walked into the studio and you and I had no comment whatsoever. Yeah, we weren't saying a word. Not whatsoever, because we didn't want the tape to be used against us. No, absolutely not. Whew, frightening. Yeah, check the pictures out on the website, very funny. And in case you missed it from yesterday, I'm telling you, it's one of the funniest things we've done in the last, I don't know, three or four months. We're going to replay it in the 5 o'clock hour. Yeah. If you have a friend of the show that didn't hear, please let them know, okay? Right. All right, let's move on and talk to James. Hey, James, what's up? What's going on, guys? How are you? Nothing. Do you guys see Survivor last night? Survivor? It's my new favorite show, Survivor on CBS. I'm telling you, I'm hooked. It's on what, Wednesday nights at 8 o'clock? Yeah, I get to see it end right when I get home. You got that Tivo though, right? I don't have it hooked up. I'm getting my wall unit Saturday, I hope. And I don't want to be fiddling with wires. Yeah. Actually, last night, I got really mad, like physically mad. Why? Because, I mean, that dude, BB. Yeah, I guess we could talk about it. I mean, every week they have to vote someone off the island. Of course, the last person on the island wins a million dollars. And last night, this one tribe, because there's two tribes, Anthony, they put them up into two tribes, they have to work together and stuff, blah, blah, blah. Then they have competitions. And if your tribe wins the competition, then you're immune from having to vote one of your tribesmen off the island. Oh, really? Yeah. And eventually, when it gets down to about eight people or so, they're going to make the two tribes into one. That's what I'm assuming. Yeah, they would hassle them. And this old guy, I mean, he's building everything. He's making chopsticks out of wood and everything. And this old, stubborn guy, 64. Is that the Navy SEAL guy? No, no, that's Rudy. I got all the names down and everything. I'm hooked on this show. I'm on message boards and everything. I'm telling you, this show is absolutely great. Absolutely great. It's only going to get better in the coming weeks. Come believe this. His name was BB, the 64-year-old guy in one of the tribes. I am BB. I am amazing. Remember him? He's as old as that BB, I'm sure. And this guy was doing everything for the tribe. Built this amazing hut out of like what? What? Just wood and leaves and stuff. You mean the guy was helping out thinking that was going to get him? He was doing everything. He did everything. Like he's screaming and yelling and getting everyone else to work. And a couple of them are real lazy and they didn't feel like working, so they're laying around. This guy built their shelter for them. They needed chopsticks to eat the rice and gul. They were cooking up. They made homemade chopsticks for the whole tribe. You know what really pisses me off is something. You got him working over here and you got that stupid black plot that is just laying on her ass all day. Ramona. Yeah, I thought... It pisses me off that she's doing anything when she's going out like BB. Ramona, the black lady, she claimed that she was sick. So while this guy, BB, the old guy, was working his ass off, she's just laying around inside the shelter that everyone else built. And they voted the guy off. Why? Well, he kind of hinted that he wanted to be voted off for some weird reason out of nowhere. I think he felt like everyone was starting, you know, even though he was doing a lot of stuff for his little tribe. So what they did, they had a bug competition. They had these disgusting... What was it? It was like... Like, oh, God, it was like this weird like... Larva. Larva thing, yeah. And it was huge too and it was like just withering in his throat. Let me explain it to Ann because he didn't get to see it. So the two tribes, they meet for their weekly competition. They had to eat these larva. They kind of looked like really fat caterpillars, like really fat, like an inch wide. Oh my God. Come on, come on. And they're moving around, right? So they got the two tribes sitting across from each other on this table and they had to go down the line. And each member had to eat one of these bugs that are moving as they're putting it in their mouth. Like huge, just gushy caterpillar looking things, swimming around. And if one member of a tribe refused to eat it, they would lose. So it turns out everyone ate them because, I mean, you don't want to be the guy that says, look, man, I ain't eating this larva thing, whatever. I got nausea looking at that. Wait a minute. You bite into it. It's going to be all bug juice in your mouth. Oh, yeah. Oh, you see the people just, their faces just making that face like, oh my God. A lot of people were swallowing them whole and stuff. Well, that would be the way to go. And this one black guy, I forgot, what's the black guy's name? You mean the YMCA dude? Yeah. Oh, God. Whatever. He's an African. He couldn't eat the bug at first, but his tribe pretty much forced him and he did it. And then everyone from each tribe ate the bugs. And now they're like, okay, now we have to figure out who wins and who loses. So each team got to pick the weakest link from the other tribe to eat more bugs. And then those two people that obviously had the hardest time with eating the bugs in the first round had to eat two now. Two? Two moving, huge larvae, fat caterpillar looking things. It just pissed me off that he didn't do a goddamn thing. And he's getting kicked off the island. So the team with Bebe, this guy 64, that did everything for the tribe, they finally lost. And they have to meet for like a tribal council in the middle, pretty much in the middle of the night in the middle of this island. They have to walk for a while where there's like poisonous snakes and stuff. They have to get to this tribal area and then they vote the guy off the island. And then the guy we talked on the air yesterday, he's the one that distinguishes the flame on the guy who voted off. And he immediately has to walk back to camp by himself and the rest of his tribe never sees him again. I'm making a prediction. Sandy was crying. It was hilarious. I was laughing. I'm like, this is so freaking sick. Because every week you got to vote one of your pals off the island basically because they're all bonding and stuff. And it's either you or them. So you got to vote for somebody. I'm telling you, that group will not make it, I think, without Bebe. They're just going to fall apart. So the 64-year-old guy, his flame was extinguished. He had to walk away by himself and Sandy's just bawling on the couch. I'm laughing. I'm like, this is awesome. This is wild. I am completely hooked, man. But what I don't get is that if one person gets the million dollars, right? Yeah. If they're doing that, then why are they having teams? I mean, if they have teams, that means they have to work together then go against each other? Is that the way it works? I don't get it. I think what's going to happen is they just got the two teams to start the whole competition and stuff. Eventually, they're going to just make it into one team. Yeah, there's a lot of weird things going on because you have to work together, but also you want to beat out everyone in your tribe. You want to be the last one standing for the money, too. So they're doing some bonding, but then they have to do some backstabbing. It's wild. It's a great concept. It's real world brought to the next level. I can't get past the bug. Dude, it was insane. Insane. Beetle larvae, everyone's saying it is. Well, thank you, James. Okay, man. You guys rock. Yeah, it was beetle larvae. Cindy, what's going on? Hey, it's Sandy. I was just calling to talk about the Survivor Show. Yeah. I was watching it last night. That guy, BB, that he wanted to be voted off, one of the problems was that he built the little enclosure thing. He built it right on the beach so the tide can come up and wash them out. Yeah, he built it too close to where the tide comes up at. So that was kind of a problem. So now people are like, what the F is this guy doing? People are starting to get pissed now. Even though he did all this work and built this incredible shelter hut thing, but yeah, he built it too close to where the tide's coming up. So now that's when they started having a little problem with him, like what the F? We just put all this work into this and this is going to be flooded out. He F'd up. And I think that's when he finally said, well, you know, maybe I should be voted off the island. Yeah, plus he was arguing with one of the younger guys on it, one of the young dudes. Yeah. I didn't get along at all. Yeah. Well, they say the generation gap thing is pretty big on that show. The young people getting pissed at the old people, vice versa. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So in the first week they voted this girl, Sonia, off. The other tribe did. She fell in the competition. That was hilarious too. I'm laughing and Sandy's crying, but Sandy's just like weeping at this program. She was crying last night when BB had to walk through the forest by himself after he was told to leave the island. But in the first week, Sonia, they had this torch competition. They had these like raft type things. They started in the middle of like this lagoon. Yeah. And on the way to shore, you had to light these torches as you go. And it's kind of like a race. Everyone's pushing the raft along. And then you get on the beach and then you have to light some torches real fast and then a final torch and whoever did it first wins. Okay? Okay. So this girl Sonia, as they're coming out of the water, she's like an older lady, like in her 60s. She completely falls, trips, and that's the reason they lost. Oh. So because she did that, they all just flat out said, okay, she's done. She's the weak link. The weak link. You could tell also in the beginning of the first show, they said that Sonia was just a musician. It's like, well, what can she contribute? Yeah. Some 65-year-old lady that's playing, I don't know, like some little guitar thing. Yeah, it's really, it's a really interesting show because like that one tribe, you know, voting BB off, the guy who did everything. Now the rest of the tribe, they're going to have to step up and start, you know, pulling their weight. I'm loving the show though. Cindy, you're loving it? Yeah, I think it's awesome. I love it. And next week? I'm looking at the pictures of all of the survivor people. And as you get the pictures up there, I got to tell you, next week? Yeah. They've already teased it. They eat rats. Ew! Because they need protein really bad. One guy, one guy on one of the teams, and they were all pissed at him. He built this like, this huge like fishing pole. Yeah. Like a homemade pole. It looked like something you'd find on Gilligan's Island. He spent like, I don't know, how many hours does that guy spend fishing? Like all day? Like eight or nine hours? Yeah. Didn't catch a thing and everyone was pissed at him. But he at least was trying to get some fish for protein and stuff. Right, right. Because they have enough fruit and all that crap. They need some protein. They need the protein to survive. Who is the guy that was washing his clothes and they were cooking and they were drinking water? I was just about to bring that up. That was BB too. That's another reason why they started getting pissed at the guy that did everything, that they voted off the island last night. BB. They come back to camp, I guess, or a few people away and they, you know, they come back to see BB washing his only t-shirt in the drinking water. Whoa. And they have this set up where like the fresh water that they need to survive is like, like it's a hike in the middle of the jungle, right? So you have to organize some of your members, right? You guys go get the water today. It's not just like running water somewhere. No, so basically, I mean, the point is it's a very, very valuable stuff. And here's this guy in his sixties washing his only t-shirt with the drinking water in the pot they were going to use to cook that night. So this guy had no problem with it either. He thought nothing wrong with it. They're all screaming at him. Yeah. So, all right. Well, thank you, Cindy. All right. Thanks. Have a good one. You guys are awesome. All right. We got Vinny the racist. Here we go. Vinny. Hello, fellas. Hey. Hi. I just thought this show is so funny in that how it mimics real life. I mean, here you have the hardworking white man. Then he gets no credit. Then you have the black who does nothing. Nothing. And she gets to stand the island. I don't understand. They're always getting like a break no matter what happens. I mean, what is it with these people? What's the problem? Vinny, there's a big hole in your logic. The white people voted the old white guy off. There's more white people in that tribe than black people. Exactly, Opie. That's what I'm talking about. These white people are like the liberals in this country. They don't see. They don't see what the hell is going on. Anthony saw it when he went to the movies the other day, right, Anthony? You saw exactly what this world is coming. I haven't gone to the movies since the raging bull in 1980 because of the blacks and sticks. They've ruined it for them. They can't go to the damn movies anymore. Oh, my God. Wow. There's Vinny. Vinny. I love how Vinny always tries to pull you into a circle. He's like, Anthony knows what I'm talking about. And like he's expecting to go, yeah Vinny, I absolutely know what you're talking about. Yeah, sick aisle Vinny. I know what you're talking about. Right, Opie? Right? You know it. I know you don't want to say it and that's cool. You can just sit there and not say it. But we all know you understand my point. That's exactly what he does. Vinny, wait a minute. He's trying to pull everyone into his circle. Sean, what's going on? Why is Spass hanging up on these people? Hello? Holy crap. I'm going to punch him in the head. He just hung up on a bunch of people that had good stuff today. Hey. Hey Sean, what's up? Head of the newspaper. Last night, that show, the best part was when that Navy SEAL found out the other guy was queer. He was talking about how he was talking to them but not in a queer kind of way. Yeah, that was pretty funny. It was pretty funny. The Navy SEAL guy on the other team, Anthony, the other five, he's... How old is that guy? 72 I think? Somewhere around there, yeah. He's 72 and six-shape. He's an ex-Navy SEAL guy. What's that guy, Rudy? Yeah, Rudy. And he pretty much admitted he doesn't really like queers. And which guy is that, right? That's what made it funny, the way you see the age difference. He goes, I'm not into these queers. And then he finds out one of the guys he's been hanging out with for the first six days or whatever, Richard from New Hampshire. I think that's the guy that beat his kid, right? Yeah. Richard looks a little off. Richard is one of those queers. Richard looks like the guy from that home decorating show, the interior decorator guy. Hello! We're going to do something with checkerboard, tablecloth. He's like the fat version of that guy. He said he was bonding with them but not in a queer way. Yeah, because then he had a little conflict. He goes, oh no, I've been bonding with this guy, not in a queer way. He wanted to make sure everyone understood that. And he goes, I don't know what my friends are going to think when I go back home. And then they have a scene where Rudy, the Navy SEAL guy, is putting lotion on Gay Richard's back. What? It was pretty funny. How did that come about? If he doesn't like the queers, that's where the conflict happened. He bonded with the guy before he found out he was queer. Oh, and then he found out he was also enjoying it. No, he was open minded enough to realize, well... Navy SEAL guy could have slit his throat with that copper-toned bottle. Right? So that was pretty funny too, yeah. All right, guys. Thank you, Sean. Take it easy. All right. Richard Hatch. I'm ecstatic. Tim, what's going on? Not much. How are you? Great. I would have killed BB for... He washed his shirt not only with the only water they had. They were going to cook rice with that water. And there was no way they didn't eat. Yeah, I know. That tribe that BB was in, they're never going to win a competition. There's going to be zero people in that tribe and everybody left in the other tribe. Really? Is that how it looks? No. They're awful. Right now, both sides have lost a member. Both sides lost an older member. Oh, did they? Yeah. Well, talk about getting protein. I'd give some protein to a couple of those chicks. There's a couple of chicks I was checking out, yeah. And forget the rats. Some of those guys should be donating protein. Next week, they eat rats, though, and they show them cooking them up and everything. Oh, God. I can't believe they were busting on the guy with the fishing pole. I mean, that guy, that was a pretty good fishing pole he had. It was good, right? Yeah. All day, he's just throwing the line out. He didn't get nothing. The eight-owl is not even a nibble. They've already used the rats on the island ant for bait in their lobster traps. Really? Yeah. They haven't gotten anything. The guy was like fishing in waist-deep water on a beach. It's just so funny. We were talking to the host yesterday, and it's interesting because they're living off the land, and the crew, the film crew and the host, you know, they're living in the land. They've got a clam bait going out in the back of the woods. Yeah, pretty much. On the other side of the island, they've got everything they need to survive. While the other people, the contestants, they've got to start eating rats to survive. All right. All right. Check it out. Thank you. Who's the hottie? Jenna? I'll tell you which one I thought was hot. Jenna, the 22-year-old. The 22-year-old. What's this Gretchen, 38-year-old married homemaker? No. From Clarksville, Tennessee, and they throw her in the mix. Yeah, they have all walks of life. That was the... Oh, she spent six years as a survival instructor for the Air Force. Okay. Nobody's hotter than Jenna, though, Anthony. Who? Believe it or not, I mean, the picture doesn't do her justice here. This girl, Colleen. All right. Let me see where she is. Okay. Whoa. Wait a minute. Really? Yeah. Like I said, the picture doesn't do her justice, but on the show, she's definitely looking hot. Let me see. Colleen, 23. Where's she going? Where's she from? It kind of looks... Yeah, that picture's a little weird. No, let me see the picture you got on yours. Well, it's the same one, only blown up a little more. Yeah, she's better looking than that, or she was last night anyway. Yeah, looks like a guy. She looks hotter without a shower, I guess. Now, is it true that there's another gay guy on this island, and could they hook up? I'm hearing there's another gay guy. They haven't... Some other gay. We haven't found that out yet. Mark, what's going on? I mean, I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question.

Well, sure. We need someone that... So is a corpse. This is what we need. I'm serious. We're putting out the word right now. We need someone that will be able to get us a couple live rats. We're fresh. And then we need someone that knows how to prepare them. Prepare. First you take the rat, it's got to be beheaded and gutted. Well, we need someone... And fillet it in the pan. Throw it in the pan and lightly sauté it. We need someone that is at least going to cook it a little better than we would by just throwing it on a barbecue. You know what I'm saying? Microwave. Nuking it. Jesus. Why is that worse than barbecuing it? Like barbecuing it. Ew. How about nuking it? Now that's really disgusting. Because everyone knows. Even chicken doesn't taste good after you know. Can you imagine a rat? A rat. Nuked rat. Barbecued, fried. Louis, you're in for this, huh? Sure. Barbecued with some marinade. Well, take some marinade and put it on the run. We got the building manager on the line. Hold on. Oh, really? Yeah, supposedly. Hey, Rich. Hey, guys. How you doing? What's going on? I have some property in the Bronx. Oh, okay. In the basement, I've seen rats. Basically like from your elbow to the tip of your finger. Oh, wow. That would be like a turkey. That would be like a full meal for this guy. What do you think? I mean, if they catch him, I don't know about catching it alive. No, we... Go ahead. Quickly killed. The only thing is I don't know what he's got in his system. Well, that's just... You don't know. We need to... We have to catch him alive? I saw one run between the super's legs. Oh, my God. All right. I'm totally serious. We need someone that knows a little bit about rats and how to cook them for these times. I'm cooking... Where are we going to get them? I'm serious. If you know anything, please give the show a call. We want to make this happen. I'm thinking a pet store. They got to have some big rats there to feed to like if you own a frigging boa constrictor that's 12 feet long. All right. All right. With that said, don't feed them little pinkies. All right. With that said, we have some pet stores that listen to the show. Give us a call. Tell us what the deal is. What's the biggest rat that is out there in a pet store? White Sour knows where to get rats. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. White Sour knows where to get rats. Sarah. Hello? Hi. Hi. What's going on? Nothing. If you could get the rat, like it's not... It wouldn't be hard to cook them, you know? You don't know what a rat tastes like. Nobody's really eaten one, so it might not even be that bad. Well, do you know where to get them? You can go to any pet store because people have to see them for like giant snakes and stuff. Yeah, well, that's just it. We can't get one of those little rats. We need a big rat. Well, these aren't really big ones. They're pretty big ones. I mean, people also have them for pets. All right. Well, this guy, Matt, will eat a rat for us. All right. Well, this guy, Matt, will eat a rat for free. Sarah, I've got to hang up on you because you had a radio on. That is so distracting. It might be the solar storms, Opie, affecting people's brains, I think. We've got to talk about that later. I'm a little frightened. We'll talk about that later. We've just got to get this whole rat thing on. We need rats. We need rats. We need a pet store to call us right now. And we've got Lou and Brian on the line that they're more than willing to eat rats on our show. We need a couple of pounder. We need a rat that's like as big as your fist. Yeah. Like something with some meat on it. We're talking, yeah, like an eight inch rat. I've done some hunting in my day, Opie, and I've bagged some dove, things like that, like some birds and stuff that you shoot with the shotgun. And they're not very big. You just get a few of them and you barbecue them up like that. And there's meat on them. So if you get a rat the size of your fist, that'll work. Okay. And then who's going to prepare it? The people that are going to eat it? Maybe we could get a chef down here that can cook it up real nice. No, we can do that. Because it's got to be skinned. I don't care how you dress it up, man. It's still a rat. Cooking rats and mice. Where'd you find this, Ben? God, the Internet is just a wonderful thing. Stewed cane rat. Skin and eviscerate the rat and split it lengthwise. Fry until brown in a mixture of butter and peanut oil. Cover with water, add tomatoes and tomato puree, red hot peppers and salt. Simmer the rat until tender and serve with rice. Roasted field mice. Skin and eviscerate field mice. Steal them and roast over an open fire of coals. These are probably greatest hors d'oeuvres with margaritas or softy gnomes. Grilled rat bordeaux style. Alcoholic rats and lamenting wine cellars are skinned and eviscerated. Brushed with a thick sauce of olive oil and crushed shallots. And grilled over fire with broken wine barrels. That sounds tasty. That is a tasty rat! Did you get that at Big Kahuna Rat? Hey, Reed, what's up? I got a way I can get you some rats. How? A buddy of mine traps them all the time and he skins them and that. You know the bar inside a glove? Yeah. That's muskrats. Well, muskrat is different. Muskrat is much different. When you trap rats, you know, sometimes real rats happen to be under the way into the trap. We're going for New York City rats. New York City scum rats. I don't get it off you. Alright, Reed. Bye. Alright, we'll figure this out. Matt says he'll do it for free. Matt? Yes, sir? You'll eat the rat for free? Yeah, I'm an ex-Marine. I've eaten worse. Oh, see? Ex-Marine. You're out there on Paris Island biting the heads off of those things. I'll hang out. I'll eat it for free. No problem. No problem? What does it taste like? Nope. It's just a regular brown meat. Tastes like chicken. I've eaten the grubs and I've done it all. I've eaten a lot worse things. So you'll come down just to eat it for free to hang out with us? You got it. Alright, hold on the line. We got rats and we got it. Hold on the line. Rick's going to talk to you. Uh, Brian? Yeah? I don't know if $1,000 is going to make it at this point. I'll still come down. I heard what the last guy said. I'll come down. I think we can get money though. I'm gaming. I think stockbroker Dave's game to give out some money to see somebody eat a rat. Probably. We're going to have to get a stripper to make it sexual in some way for stockbroker Dave. Yeah. I think we can figure something out. There you go. Get a little on there, man. I know. I was going to say something like that. That would be fine. Brian, Rick's going to talk to you. Hold on. Okay, cool. Okay. I think we're on, Anthony. Lou. Hey, Lou. Yo, what's up, guys? What's up? Hey, five bills, man. Okay. Because now we've got a couple guys that are willing to do it pretty much for free. Bummer. Is it a pet shop rat? Hold on the line, though. We might have a competition. First guy that does it gets cash and everyone else has to walk. Thank you. All right. Hold on. Cool. Rick will talk to you. Talk to Matt on line two, Brian on seven, and Lou on eight. We've got three guys that will come down and eat rats on our show, a la like the Survivor show on CBS. Okay. All right. Now there's diagrams on how to cook the rat and cut them up and stuff. Oh, my God. I can't look at this. All right. Now let's take a break. Okay. All right. Oh, wow. Yeah, there's little diagrams on how to cut them. Yeah. Rats raise delicious rat plate. Oh, look at that. They're just kind of filleting it. Oh, my God. Look how he's cutting it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Look how he's cutting it. I'm thinking we try to make this happen tomorrow. All we need is some rats and someone to prepare them. That's it. That's it. Yeah. Someone give us a call. That's a big rat. 2127571027. Anthony? Yeah. Stoner Amy from the other day is standing by to talk to us to tell us what happened after her mom grabbed the phone from her when she was ready to play Stoner Spelling Bee with us. Yeah. She had a rehab and cocaine and heroin. There was an ugly phone call from the other day. We'll get an update on that. And also real fast, if you want a wow sticker, we're doing another wow sticker stop today at Ranch 1, Anthony, 315 7th Avenue, corner of 28th Street, 7th and 28th Street. Okay. All right. Gorilla Boy Jeff Norris will be there at 430 handing out the wow stickers and having lots of fun with you guys. All right. Right. We'll be back to talk to Stoner Amy next. Boopie and Anthony. There's no level too low that you guys won't stick to. That is such a bummer. Boopie and Anthony. 1027WNEW. You'll love Pizzano. Yeah. Of Mulberry Street in Little Italy, Anthony. No rats there.

Very funny. How about that, Anthony? Very funny, man. Last time I saw him at Caroline's, I think that was like three or four months ago, I laughed so hard the next morning, I was like, wow, did I crack a rib last night? I couldn't figure out why. When's the baby due? When's the baby due? When's the baby due? When's the baby due? Where's Brian Regan? Where's Brian Regan playing? Because we've got to sell out that place. He's that good. Rascal?

Go see Brian Regan tomorrow night. You will laugh your yam bag off. Yes, your yam bag will fall off down your pant leg and you'll kick it with your sneaker. You'll be laughing so hard. Could someone tell Stoner Amy to hold on maybe so she can get some rest? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know. No, they've got to be alive. How the hell are we going to kill them? I mean, if they're frozen, are they fresh? Fresh, right! How flesh is this? I'm talking to the butcher about a pork chop. Is it fresh? What's the expiration date? I mean like we get in fresh, like live ones and also frozen ones like your feet to the snake one etc. See the problem is, alright now there's some ethical issues here. The killing of the rat. Now no, they're going to be eaten so it's okay. What I'm saying is a frozen one might be better for you because it's already dead. But you don't know, there's some neighborhoods that buy their chickens alive so. You don't know if it's frozen and it's good enough to eat for a snake which I think can ingest a few things that humans can as far as rancid meat goes. No, it's not rancid. We have like a big freezer we keep them in. And what do you put in there live? These rats already have their death sentence. They're going to be snake food. Right. These insane people who want to eat them don't eat them. Do you get the rats frozen or do you just put them in bags and freeze them live? We get them in frozen and also we have live ones but if you wanted them frozen we can make them frozen. How about this Anthony? A little rat electric chair opi is that what you mean? Okay. Let's put them in a microwave and watch their brains explode. No. How about we have Lisa kill the fresh rats and bring them on ice down to the state? Oh God. Kill the rats. Of course you get the only pet store manager that's scared of rats but I guess I could do it. Alright, hold on the line Lisa. Okay. Hold on. Alright. Lisa's on line three and now we've got another guy Mike that can get us the rats. Mike! How are you Mike? I'm fine. Where are you getting these rats from? A friend of mine on the pet store in Queens. Okay. And you know just like you said they come frozen or you can get the ugly looking ones the nasty ones you know? I think we need for you guys to kill them and bring them over here on ice for us. I think that's the best way to go about this Anthony. Freshly killed on ice rats. I could bring them with the ice pick still in their chair too sitting in the ice. No well we don't need to do that. No they can't see you can't just like whale them with with with an ice pick. I don't know how you would go about killing them. Alright. It doesn't matter to me. I would think the fastest most efficient way is a meat cleaver to the head to tell you the truth on a chopping block. It's no it sounds brutal but quite frankly that's probably the most humane and best for the meat as it were. Alright. Hey however you guys want it done that's how I'll get them there. You know what I mean? From Will DeWark. Alright hold on Mike. You got it. Fast tell them to talk to Lisa on line three and Mike on line four to get us the rats. One more guy is willing to help us out. Dave I want to make sure we get rats tomorrow. Yeah. A lot of people back out on this damn radio show. Dave. Yo what's going on boys? Great show. Thanks you can get us rats. Dude I can get you the biggest New York City rat you have ever seen. The nasty dank looking things. Why? Well actually you just go into any Bell Atlantic store and you pick out a manager and you'll have yourself the biggest rat in New York. He's making a joke of it. I'm not really a joker. What an ass. Come on. See I knew this would this is going to be difficult to get. No I think Lisa and Mike we got some potentials there Anthony. So now we got the people that are willing to eat the rats. Yes. It looks like we got two pet store managers that are willing to supply the rats Anthony. Okay. Now we need cooks. Cooks. We have a French chef on the line. A wee wee. A guy that just graduated culinary school. Okay. A bunch of them. Let's go to Steve first. We should get a bunch of chefs down here so they can do this together right? Right. Yeah kind of talk to each other and maybe it will be like that Food Network show Ready Set Cook. Yeah. We can have them prepare rats in different ways. Two different cooks. Hey Steve. What's up guys? How are you? Good. Good. I just graduated from the C.I.A. Culinary Institute of America. Yes. I'm willing to do them. You're willing to? We were taught how to slaughter too. Oh really? Yeah because you got to do it clean. Alright. You don't do it clean forget it they can develop all sorts of chemicals in their body. These guys would be like eating sushi that wasn't treated you know. Yeah because you can't like break open the intestine and have that leaking on the meat and stuff. It's got to be killed in a way and gutted in a safe fashion. Off with the head. Off with the head. Alright and you're willing to come down here tomorrow? Definitely. You want rat marsala? What do you want? Rat marsala? Yeah. Oh that's nice with some mushrooms and brown sauce. A little alfredo? Rat alfredo? Well I don't know. I had the alfredo sauce with rats. Let me ask you a question. What type of... That's disgusting. Yeah. Wait. What type of setup do you guys have there? What type of wine do you drink with rat, Opie? Definitely. I would go with a white. I go with ripples. I would go with a red wine. Yeah I'd go with some... I would think it would be more of a red wine. Cabernet? Yeah. A little cabernet action? Oh. I guess we need a chef that could bring down you know everything. I could do it. We don't even have a stove here. You're going to need some kind of heating apparatus. I could do it. I used to do catering. We'll make all the necessary calls we have to to get the proper equipment down here. No, I have to... No, we're going to have the chefs just bring their stuff. I have gas burners. Oh you do? Oh yeah. Oh man, this will rule. I used to do catering. Steve, I'm going to invite a few chefs down so you guys could do it together just in case someone backs out on us. Can I make a suggestion? Yeah. You ever see that show on the Food Network, the Iron Chef with the Japanese guys? Yes. Let me tell you, we should have a competition just like that. That's not a bad idea. If all you guys show up with your own equipment, that's a great idea. Then they could have a little contest on who makes the best rat dish. Yeah. Yeah, listen. Opie, if it looks and smells good, I might even enjoy some rat. You can garnish with the eyes. Ah, wonderful. All right, Steve, hold on. You're definitely in. All right, someone has to talk to Steve. We want him down here. Steve, the chef. Let's go to Scott, another chef. Hey Scott? Yo. Do you have your own equipment to cook up the rat and stuff? Yes, I do. Any suggestions of a dish you can make with the rat? Well, yeah, you'd want to prepare it like you would a quail. But I would suggest that you go with the ones that are already frozen because they've already been somewhat sanitized before freezing. Are you going to take a live one? You're going to cut it open and you don't know what it suggested before you cut it. A lot of these things get rat poisoning in them and they don't die. No, no, that's why we need rats from a pet store. I would suggest you go with the rats that the girl offered that were frozen, only because you're going to cut the heads off anyhow. Or if you cut the head off, then it's like cutting a lobster down the middle. Yeah, but what if the frozen ones still have the guts in them too? Because I think they do because they're just meant for... Yeah, but it's going to be easier to remove all of that in a frozen state than it will in a raw state. You're going to have a mess if you cut the head off a rat. Think about bringing a chicken into the studio. Oh my God, I'm freaking caught. Cutting the head off a chicken. I mean, you're going to have that mess. Here you've got a frozen rat with no head on it already. Does the frozen rat still have the fur on it and stuff? Yeah, it's a whole rat. It's going to be easier to skin that once it thaws out than it will to take a live rat and cut it. I'm fine with the frozen rats as long as the fur and everything is on it. But you don't know if it's been frozen, thawed, frozen, thawed. You know what I mean? I'm a chef at a place called the Colorado Cafe. We were associated with the Rattlesnake Ranch. I don't know if you've heard about it since Cedar Grove, New Jersey. But most of the rattlesnake and the boar and the stuff that we cook, all the exotics, they all come in frozen. None of that stuff is fresh. The rattlesnake meat always comes in frozen just to protect it from bacteria. Same thing I would say with the rat meat. So, you want to remove any liability of making someone even sicker than they're going to get from eating it. I'd be more than happy to come down and cook one up for you. And if you're fine with it, I'm fine with the frozen rats. I'm fine with cooking up whatever you want. How do you want it? Hold on, hold on, Scott. Want to flambé it? I think it's safer with the fresh rat. You don't know how long the frozen rat's been dead. Yeah, but what's the difference? It's frozen. Once it hits the temperature, you're killing all the bacteria. When something's alive and it's warm, the bacteria grows. I mean, these are just basic food principles. The guy who you talk to from the CIA would be able to tell you that too. The safety zone with food, anything below 40 is fine. Anything above 40 is hot enough. Yeah, I'm going. All right. Well, all we need you to do is cook the rats. So why don't you hold on the line? Absolutely. We might have a competition if enough of you chefs show up. You need all your own equipment. You know that, right? All you need is a portable induction burner and a frying pan. All right, cool. An induction pan. All right, hold on the line. You got it. That's our second cook, Scott, on line eight. Go to George from PETA. George! George! Jack! What's going on? You cannot eat! Eat! Rats! Rats are not to be made to be eaten! Blah, blah, blah. Let's go to Mark. Mark, you're next on WNAW. Hey, what's up? Hey. I am willing to cook anything you want. Alive is the better, anyway. You know what I'm saying? You have to have live rats. You have to know how to clean them up. Are you real? Very simple. Are you a French chef? Yes, I am, yes. Okay. I can prepare any way you want. I'm going to live. I kid it on the front of you. Very simple. Very simple to clean. How do you do it? It's simple. You break their neck so they don't move. Then you skin them. It's very simple. It's like rabbits. I used to clean rabbits. Rabbits, right. You hang them up. You pull the skin off. You pull the skin off. It's very simple. It's like a glove opium. It comes right off. You cut it around the top of the neck and you peel it back. And the gas is very simple to clean. Also, it's just like a little bag. If you don't pierce it, it's okay. You don't pierce any organs. It means something gets contaminated. Okay. Prepare the next step. I'm going to cook something. I'm going to cook something. I'm going to cook something. Prepare anything you want. French style. Any style you want. Oh no, we want French style. All right. I'll make anything you want. It doesn't matter. Look at you. All right. We need a French chef involved with this. Yeah. We definitely need one. Like I said, life is better. All right. Hold on, Mark. No problem. There goes Mark. That would be wonderful to get him down here. All right. We're getting them all? Okay. Justin, what's going on? Hello. Hey, Justin. How are you doing, Opie? Good. I'm working down here in Brooklyn at a place called Bonsoir Caterers. I've been on the chef for 22 years. Yeah. I'm willing to come down and cook it. I've got a great recipe, the lemon basil rat. Lemon basil rat. Lemon basil rat. That sounds so tempting, Opie. I'll even eat it after I cook it just to show you that it's good. Really? Sure. All right. Hold on. Okay. I think we've got four chefs, Anthony. Four chefs. Four chefs. Now we've got Joe who's going to suggest a fine wine for the... I don't know what the big deal is. We've all had Chinese food. Joe! Hey, Opie. How are you doing, guys? Hey. Listen, guys, as far as the proper wine, it really depends on which one of your chefs serve it. If you're going to go with the lemon basil guy... A white wine. ...I'd probably recommend not just a white wine but a light white wine because you really don't want to take away from the rat. So I might go with a Kendall Jackson Sauvignon Blanc. Oh, yes. Or a Fulme Blanc. Something to that effect. But now let's say it was more like a rat marsala. Okay. A rat marsala. I would use a red but I wouldn't use a heavy red like the Cabernet that he mentioned earlier. No. I'd probably use something with a lot of fruit in it. Say like a Pinot Noir. Oh, brilliant. Or even something from Australia like a Rosemont Chiraz. Yeah. Joe, would you like to bring some wine down tomorrow? I would love to bring some wine down tomorrow. I have a wine seminar. Appropriate wine. I have a wine seminar. I've got to attend in the morning. Okay. For my job. All right. What time are you guys planning on kicking off this dinner? We're going to get the festivities going right at 2 o'clock tomorrow. Right at 2 o'clock? Yeah. I mean... That'll start and then we'll probably be dining sometime around 5. Yeah, around 5. 5-ish? You've got a deal. That's perfect. All right. Hold on, Joe. Okay. We've got a dinner for wine. We've got a rat. We've got three guys. Do you got everybody, Rick? It's getting confusing now. It's very confusing. Are we having a rat cook-off now? Yeah. It's a rat cook-off and dining and now we have wine involved. It's going to be fabulous. Yeah. Give me your list. I'll tell you where we're at. It's an event. We've got the three guys that are going to eat the rats, right? These are the three guys that are eating. We've got one... Wait. Who's Mike? Oh, Mike could get the rats. What happened to Lisa? She's on there. All right. Lisa could get the rats. We've got the French chef, Justin the chef. Did you talk to those guys yet? I talked to Steve and Steve said frozen is not the way to go. You might want to talk to him again. No. Frozen is not the way to go. A bunch of the cooks are saying the French chef is going to come down and snap its little neck and skin it and do everything that it needs to be done. Yeah. So you need to talk to Mark the French chef on line 11. You need to talk to Justin on the hotline and you need to talk to Joe who's going to bring down the wine. We only have three chefs. What happened to the other one? I already got the numbers. No, you don't. Not on this list. Mike could get the rats. Lisa can get the rats. Three, four, five. Wait, where's the other two? I'm confused now. Justin and Mark, you're going to get there. Yeah, but you only have one of their phone numbers. Okay. Because that's Lisa. Right. But that's one, two, three, four, five. Four. No. Just don't do this now. No, you're. You're driving me nuts. That's why I'm trying to help you out. You're missing a chef. I'm trying to help you. You're missing a chef. I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help you. You're missing a chef. What's best? One hung up. One hung up, see? All right, so we'll have three chefs then because one hung up. That's okay. What about Joe? Where's Joe? Joe's the wine guy. That's why I'm trying to help you out here. I got it all figured out. We were speaking with the wine guy. So get his info. That's why you need to listen to me. I'm serious. I got this whole thing figured out in my head. Line 8, Joe, he's bringing down the wine. Okay? Proper wine for rats. Proper wine. Listen, just listen closely because we want this to work. We got Mark, the French chef that you have to talk to on line 11 and Justin, the other chef on line 5. So now we'll have three chefs. We'll have the wine. We got the guys eating it and we got two pet stores bringing down the rats. We're all set. You guys should have a theme to it, you know, like set it up like a little French restaurant down there. Oh, sure. We'll have like a table with a nice tablecloth. A table, an upside down garbage pail with a tablecloth. Call it Les Rodents. It'll be wonderful. Yeah, maybe we could get like some decor expert to help us out. We'll have rats on it, you know. Talk to Carl on line 1. We got another guy that wants to eat the rats because you know some of those guys are going to back out that we already talked to. We all said, Anthony, how about just like passing out samples to people walking down the street? You know how they do that sometimes? We'll set up a table with little toothpicks and stuff and some rat and some meat and some cheese or something and just have people come by and give it to them on a cracker. What do you think? It's a new product. People are so silly. Do you ever do that? Like you look at the mall. People will eat anything. Just some guy standing there with a dopey chef hat on or something. You can hand people pieces of crap on a toothpick. They'll be like, eat it right up and I'll have a side bet with you. What? You go down to the corner with a tray of rat. If you get someone to eat it, I'll give you $100. Okay. No problem. I will do that tomorrow. We will set out a little tray. We'll put some rat aside. We'll put a wacky chef hat on. I'll put the goofy chef hat on. From a restaurant in the area? Yeah. We'll lay out with some Ritz crackers and some cheese and some rat meat with toothpicks. Would you like to try a sample? Would you like to try a sample? Guaranteed. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. People will come up and take the toothpick and shove it in their mouth. Dude, if you put on a French accent in two minutes, too, you'll have a sample. I'm sure. I don't know how happy the Brooklyn diner will be about us being out right outside. Hey, Paul, what's going on? Hey, guys, what's up? What's up? I'm just getting nauseous over all of this. Oh, you're in the club. But I think that you really can't get those frozen ones. I don't think they're good. Yeah, I guess we're learning from the chefs that they've got to be fresh and alive. Yeah, because they're really intended for snakes and stuff like that. Exactly. Right. And you don't really know how long they've been dead and all that. All right. It's going down tomorrow, Paul. Thank you. Cool. Billy Mac is wondering if we need vegetables for this. Oh, what type of vegetable would be good? Billy Mac, what's going on? Hey, guys, how are you? Listen, you got everything now. You got the wine, you got the meat, you got the guys to eat it. But you need to garnish it with a little vegetables like carrots and asparagus a la Madison. Oh, God. Oh, Billy. Carrots and asparagus Madison. Marinated in her internal organs. Kind of like a news side joke, you know? I'm already flooded. If you're a faithful listener to the show, you understand what Billy Mac is saying. Yeah, yeah. Okay, guys. Good luck tomorrow, man. All right. Thank you, Billy Mac. Glenn from West Isle recommending that we shove the rat in Rick's George Foreman grill. That might be good. Leave me fat burning, grilling rat cooking machine. All right, Anthony. We're going to take a break here. All right. Stoner Amy, standing by to talk to us. Give us an update on her condition. Also, someone else that has to give an update on their condition. Stinky from this fine radio show. What the hell happened to Stinky? Very, very injured while doing our radio show, I believe. During the show. He was on the line when he hung up, so we'll get him back on the line. My arm. Yeah, it's not looking good for Stinky. He had a rough day yesterday. Very injured. All right. And just so everyone's up to speed because we're getting new listeners all the time. Yeah. This explains to two. I love this. Then you'll understand every time the number two is set on our show that we have to scream to. We'll be back. Now we're up to our long distance dedication. And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand whether we have kids or pets or neither. It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio. And here's what he writes. Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll mean a lot if you play it. Recently, there was a death in our family. He was a little dog named Snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of. Let's go start again. I'm coming out of the record. Play the record, OK? Please. See, when you come out of those uptempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions. And then you got to go into somebody dying. You know, they do this to me all the time. I don't know what the hell they do it for. But goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it is down on the phone. OK, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking uptempo record every time I do a goddamn death dedication. Now, make it. And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. This is a god last goddamn time. I want somebody who uses his brain to not come out of a goddamn record that is that's uptempo. And I got to talk about a dog dying. Hi, this is Casey Kasem. American Top 40 has moved to a new time. I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2 2. Ponderous man, ponderous, ponderous. Opie and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. Hey Anthony. Yes, Opie. The razor roller board scooter. Oh, come on. Who's having a pisser with this thing? These things in our own hallways. All of us now. Even you're jumping on these damn things, Anthony. Yeah, you know what? I kind of I was laying off them for a while and just watching everyone zip around. It looked like so much too goddamn fun. I had to jump on. I found out I had a break yesterday on the back. I never use it. I just run right into things. People laugh at me. I run full speed right into walls, garbage, pails, everything else. It's a pesser hottest new product this summer. Swear to God driving home last night saw five people on these things from kids to businessmen. I swear to God. And this is the hottest new product this summer. All the magazines are writing about them. They're really, really cool. They're lightweight. They're like an inline scooter. The wheels are really, you know, inline skate wheels. Yeah. So you're cruising nice, smooth, compact, sleek design. It's gleaming stainless steel and aluminum. They really look cool. It looks like something. It looks like the Terminator. It's pretty. Yeah, look at that. Rick's showing it off for the radio audience. And you see it, people. Do you see? Moron. You could like commute. And if you have an easy commute, like, you know, you do a commute where you have to walk 10 blocks or maybe you have a couple block walk to the train station. You could scoot to the train station or to the office and then just fold it up and you're good to go. Great way to attract underage chicks at the junior high. That's what Psycho Mark uses his for. He scoots in front of the elementary schools, giving candy to little girls. It's amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I said, sleek looking and a lot of fun to ride. Sharper Image. That's the people that put this thing out. I love the Sharper Image when the catalog comes. I'm like, I need that. I need that. I need everything in there. Give them a call. One eight hundred three four four four four four four one eight hundred three four four four four four four four four. And of course you can listen to our program because we give away these things every so often. Yeah, we're going to give them away a little later on the show. Matter of fact, Anthony, OK, the razor roller board scooter. If you do want to win one, all you have to do is visit any New York area Sharper Image store and fill out an entry blank. Each store will give away five razors on Sunday, June 25th. No purchase necessary. Winner need not be present. OK, it's the razor roller board scooter from the Sharper Image. Powered by O.B. and Anthony. That's right. By Infinity Broadcasting. Whatever. 1027 W.A.W. New York. Our phone number 212757 1027. Got to say hi to Foots. Hey, what's up? Foots in the studio. Sure, drop in to see my pal. Sure. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Love STK. Everything all right, right? If the lawyers squash this idea of ours, we are not going to be happy. Jeremy and I were just having that conversation in the other room and they're about to be on the CBS TV show and I guess some other people that have worked for the company that have been in the service have claimed to eat rats. So, yeah. See, that's true. CBS TV is doing it. Lawyers have a way of wrecking everything. I have no confidence in lawyers whatsoever. I don't care if they got us out of a huge jam once and saved us millions of dollars. They still suck. Tomorrow, the story is lawyers suck. We hate them. Ranch 1 today, 7th Avenue, corner of 28th Street, 430, Grilla Boy, Jeff Norris will be there handing out the wow sticker. So, if you're in the area, stop by and say hi to him, okay? All right, we got a couple things going on right now. We got Amy from Stoner, smelling big. We will talk to her, but first, really fast, we got to talk to Stinky, our own Stinky, Anthony. He didn't make it to work today. No, he didn't. Stinky is like the best employee ever. It doesn't matter. On his days off, he comes in. Ever. You know, he will never take a day off. No, because you just love this place, right, Stinky? Oh, it's the greatest. Greatest place in the world, right? Yes, it is. We're supposed to be blading in the park tonight. It looks like you're not going to join us, huh? I could still blade, but I'd rather not today. So, let's back up. I guess you got injured doing the radio show yesterday? Yes, right before the big Psycho Mark bet. Very injured. When Psycho Mark was in here and we got that transvestite and tricked Psycho Mark really, really bad. We're going to replay that in the 5 o'clock hour. It's really, really good stuff. Just before that, Stinky, you decided to run down the hall as fast as you can and try to jump over like a divider. Yes, railing. Like a railing. Right, Anthony? The railing's up to what, mid-chest? About stomach height. Yeah. A little higher than stomach. A little railing. Have you made this jump before, Stinky? Yes, I've done it before, successfully. All right, so yesterday, full speed, you run down the hall. I'm trying to just get the visual for everyone, Anthony. I mean, how far is the ramp before the rail here? Like 20, 25 feet. 25. So you can get a good running start. 25. You can get a good running start. So what happened, Stinky? Well, I was quick running to get release forms for the young lady, whatever. The special release forms. And there were people in the hallway where the ramp is. So I went around the other side of the railing and went to hop over it. And as I did that, someone came out the door. So I went to stop myself and I grabbed onto the railing. And one of my foot caught the top railing. I just hit the header right over the top. So you did a header over the top of the railing because someone opened the door, which is right on the other side of the railing. And well, what is your injury, Stinky? Well, the doctor said that I have a fracture in my forearm toward the elbow. The ulna or radius, as it were? I don't know. He doesn't even know the bone that's broken. So Stinky, you broke your arm doing our radio show yesterday. I heard after you did it all of a sudden you realized you couldn't write anymore and stuff. Yeah, it was hard to write. This is great. Oh, man. I thought Spaz would be the one that would break a bone first on the show. Not you. I remember when Spaz got hit by the car. That was funny. Yeah. He was riding his bike and he came and all shoot up and scabbed up and his arm in a sling or something. And road rash all over his body. That's how into this job Spaz is. He came to work looking like that. I was swerving to avoid a 14 inch U-Haul. I can't decide why. A baby. Yeah, what, Rick? So dude, I got to see this actually happen. Yeah, I remember because on the show you hear Rick scream yesterday. I'm like, dude, what happened? You go, man, Stinky just had the most nastiest film. He just bought it because here he is. I go, dude, because we're about to do the second. And you guys are just clicking on the lights. He sees the lights go on. To him it was like the starting gun just went off. He bolts down the hallway. He sees the people. He decides he's going to jump it. And I watch him and I see the leg just get caught and the door open and his head. It just went, woo. And I was pissing in my pants. Because no sooner did his head and his arm slam into the floor than he bounced off the floor. Then he bounced back up like Pee Wee Herman and started running back down the hall with his arms flaring to get the thing. Stink, when did you know that there was a serious problem with your arm? It felt a sprain and I got ice later in the day. And then I don't know, I started to feel, I could hardly move it when I got home and I got really lightheaded and stuff. Did the horticulture after the show help the pain? Yeah, I think it did. It used the pain a little. It's good for glaucoma and fractures. I couldn't use the lighters. You couldn't light the bulb? I'm just psychomarcus. They would have a lighter to help. So are you going to have to have a cast and all that? No, there was no displacement. I just have to keep it in a sling so no one bumps into it and stuff. Our own Cheech and Chong. You've got an idea. I got the guy who opened the door and made you fall and break your arm on the other line. Stink? Anthony the limo driver. Hey, what's up, Anthony? Sorry, guys. Hey, no problem. I was trying to get Shannon through the door and I didn't know the code and John was letting him in and all of a sudden you just see him jump and he gets sucked. Rick is hysterical and he just jumps right up and goes back into the back room and I was like, are you alright? He's like, oh yeah, nothing's wrong with me. He's a trooper. I'm sorry, Stink. I apologize. It's alright. It wasn't your fault. Stink, I will be representing you. Don't accept an apology. Oh, okay. You bastard. Anthony makes a lot of money. You could get some good stuff. Oh, really? Yes. Yeah. Wow. My lawyer will be calling you guys in a little while. Stinky's own vital limousine. Hear it now. Oh, boy. Just in time for promsies. Here you go. Stinky limousine. That's what they call it normally, right? Yeah. Alright, guys. Alright, guys. Thank you, Anthony. Thanks for that huge surprise yesterday. You got it, bro. See you soon. Anthony supplied the He-She or whatever you want to call it. Oh, you got it. You had to see it. I swear to God. When she was sitting on the corner yesterday, about 20 guys were checking He or She out and it was hysterical. I'm sorry, Anna. Yeah, going, going, whoa, what is that? And I never bought it. No. You never did? No, I swear. No, no. You could tell. You got to look for the Adam's apple. Right away. It's a guy. You could tell. And the hands. Did you see the lady with the butter neck girl or whatever she is? It's a guy, Anthony. Oh, I didn't know. She was standing in front of Grand Central and Shannon was walking around and I'm looking at her and saying, okay, and I see this girl in a miniskirt. I'm like, oh, she's pretty hot and everything else. And Shannon puts her... Oh, it's a guy. Man. I didn't know that. Man. I'm hanging up before I hang myself. Goodbye, guys. See you later. Alright. See you later. Alright. We're going to replay that. Hey. Around 5.30 or so. Hey. It's really, really funny stuff from yesterday. Well, Stinky, when are you going to be back? I'll be back tomorrow. Look at you. They give you good painkillers? No, actually they did. I wish they had, but I think I have some codeine left over from some other injury. You probably got a pot. Man, that'll help you. Plenty of pot. Alright, man. Take care of yourself. See you tomorrow. Alright. There you go, Stinky. Spaz's employee breaking his arm over this radio show. He's quite the trooper, isn't he? Yeah. Alright, let's get to Stoner Amy finally. Want to explain Stoner Amy real fast, Anthony? Yeah. Stoner Amy, we were doing Stoner Spelling Bee about a month or two ago, and she won. The object, obviously, you get as stoned as you can, and we give you words, and you try to spell it. Smoking pot as we go along. Well, we were doing it again a couple of days ago, playing Stoner Spelling Bee, and we wanted Amy to come back and try to defend her title. But as we were ready to start the game, Amy's mother got on the phone and got all pissed off, because it seems Amy had gotten out of rehab that day. Yeah. And we were having her smoke pot for this Stoner Spelling Bee, and then they searched the room and found some cocaine, and they immediately told us that what we were doing was horrible, and I hung up and dragged Amy off to rehab once again. Well, the sister hung up, because they were passing the phone around like crazy. Yeah. I asked if the sister was hot, and that's when she hung up. So now we have Amy on the phone to see what happened. Yes, let's go to Amy. Stoner Amy. Hey, guys. Amy. Oh, you're in trouble. I'm in a lot of trouble. Well, you sound, um... First of all, wasn't coke. What was it? That's what... Was dope. Like what, heroin? Oh, wow. Snorting the H-O-B. All right, so tell us exactly what happened. You could talk, obviously. Where are you right now? Well, right now I'm home, but I'm waiting any minute for my mom to be here, and she says I have to leave for 16 months, or I have to leave home, period. So I might only have a couple minutes to talk. So you're going back into rehab? No, I'm not going to, so I'll be pretty much homeless, I guess. Why aren't you going back into rehab? Because it's for 16 months, this one. So? Well, it's obvious you need the help, though, Amy. All right, guys, cut it out. Not you two, okay? I want to tell you something. Wait. No, we're just... All right, now we were just obligated to say that. I could give a flying F what you do with your life, Amy, to tell you the God's honest truth. Let me just tell you something now. Two drugs kill people. I don't care. My mom came out, like I'm sure she sounded like she was a horrible woman or whatever. No, she sounded like she cared about her daughter. All right, I just wanted to straighten that out, you know? Yeah, Amy, believe me, she sounded like a mother who was kind of freaking out at her daughter's drug use. Yeah, that's... What's with the drugs? You really like the heroin? I suppose I haven't done anything since then. What is it? Well, you had it on you the other day. I was doing it. I wound up having to go to ER because I OD'd that night. You OD'd on heroin that night? You would have played stone and spelling, but you would have just been smoking pot. God, we could have helped that. Wait, back the truck up. So after we talked to you, you OD'd that night? Yeah, I kept going because she took me to the emergency room and I was afraid to get caught with it because I never get more drug charges and stuff from the cops. So I just did a couple of bags at once and then... That's always good to do. If you can't get rid of your drugs, do it all. That's a good thing to do. I've already had charges on me. I can't get more. Right. Amy, how old are you, first of all? Twenty-five. And what happened in your life that makes you want to just do drugs all the time? I don't know. What was the first time you did the dope? First time? Yeah. The H. Horse. Horse. Smack. Smack. Sure. You think it's all cool and groovy with your friends to do smack? Actually, I haven't done that with anybody before I do that by myself. Starts out with a J, a marijuana cigarette or a joint. When was the first time? Cascades. When was the first time? Into heroin use. I was working day watch out of narcotics. We came across Amy, an attractive young girl who's on the smack. So what happened? How old were you when you first started doing the H? That was a couple years ago. Really? Yeah. Somebody's guy probably just came up and said, hey, do some heroin. Yeah, to get me off some other stuff. To get you off of what? To get you off of what, Amy? Crack. To get you off of crack, you got you on heroin. Yeah. Wow, that's good. Doesn't make much sense, I know. No. No, I hadn't done that in a very long time. When did you start doing the crack? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, none of that either. Well, when did you do it? How old were you when you started doing crack? Well, coke started at 17 and then crack was 20. Coke? So you started doing coke at like 17? Yeah. What is wrong with you? Don't you realize that stuff will kill you? Ah, you're going to die doing drugs, Amy. Thank you. Well, you are. It's horrible. We're all about the reality of everything. Yeah, what do you think? It doesn't sound like you're even giving a thought to maybe trying to get off of doing them. Your life sucks that much that like you got to do drugs, huh? No. Well, then what's the problem? I don't know. It just makes you feel good? Yeah. It really doesn't though, right? You kind of do it and then like 10 minutes later you're like, oh, I got to get doing more? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Doesn't make you feel better. It's just another problem. Jesus. But I don't care, like I said. Do all the drugs you want. You want to do some H-Live on our show today? We're going to do a heroin spelling bee today. Everyone get your works out. I could be campaigner on that one too. Amy, do you have an F'd up body from the H? No. Hey, did you look at that? No, I don't shoot it up. Did you look like that scene out of Pulp Fiction when you snorted it, No Deed? Were you bleeding out of the mouth and foaming and stuff and then John Travolta had a stick and needle in your heart? No, but they did have to shoot me up with some stuff over there. Oh yeah? No, I wasn't like... You're a cool drug fiend. Wait, I definitely want to back up again. So we talked to you the other day and then you OD'd on the heroin. Did your mom find you in your room or something? Yeah. And you were just like what, passed out? Oh, later on you mean? Yeah, when they found you, they OD'd. And that was at the hospital. Yeah, but... See, she took me because she knew I was doing something. And at the hospital I wound up doing everything. Right, she was at the hospital and didn't want to get nabbed with the H so she did it all. So where did you do it in the hospital? The bathroom. Amy, sex for drugs? Sit down. What? Sit down. What did she say? Wait, what did you say? Sex for drugs? Sex for drugs. Yeah, do you do that? No. No? That's messed up, man. That's messed up. She's been swindled, man. That's messed up. I just want to know if you like a coke or an H-Hore. No. When you were doing the crack? No, none of that. I will suck your... You guys are getting mean now. Man, I need the crack. Man, I will suck your... You guys are getting mean now. No, we're just going through the normal stereotypes of... No, that's not me. Okay. No, we have questions. It's not every day we talk to a heroin addict. Yeah, I mean, do you have a job? I have a job. Where do you get... So, what line of work do you have? Computers. Computers. And you're using all your money to buy the dope? No, not all of it. So now, as we sit here talking to you today, you're not going to go into rehab tomorrow for 16 months? No. So you're going to get kicked out of your house, and where, Amy, are you going? I don't know yet. You don't know. Do you have any friends? Not any that would have a place for me to stay. Because they've probably been run through that place. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do you look 25 or do you look like 35? No, I don't look like 35. I still get proof for cigarettes and alcohol. You have all your teeth and everything. I don't look bad at all. You know what's going to happen though? You keep doing heroin? Oh, shit. Look, you age like three years for every year that you age. By the time you're like 28, 29, 30, you are going to look like a 45, 50-year-old woman. Do you get laid? I don't sleep around. That's what you mean. No, I mean do you get it when you want it? When I want it? Yeah. I'm not in a relationship right now. You don't want sex? Well, I'm not in a relationship so it's not a question. I got an idea. She's a drug fiend but no whore. Amy, do you want to play What's in Amy's Pants? I always want to play it with a crack whore. That would be fun. Oh, hey. I would say a balloon's full of heroin, Opie. What? No, she's not a crack whore, Opie. No, I know. She's into the H now. She's a heroin addict. Why didn't you flush the heroin instead of ingesting it? I was messed up. I didn't even think about it. So you just snorted it up? Yeah, I was pretty much panicked. Now, Amy, you sound pretty sober today. I am. Last time we talked, you were really out of it. Yeah. And your mom's coming home any moment now? Mm-hmm. What time? She got out at four so she should be here any minute. Who sells you your heroin? It was somebody at my job. Yeah? At your job? Yeah. Wow. Like a co-worker, yeah? Mm-hmm. Heroin in the computer industry. An expose on the Opie and Anthony show. She says it so matter of factly. Yeah, we boot up heroin, we boot up discs. Yeah, you've got to boot up the operating system and then we boot up some H. Interesting. Man, Amy, we're going to be wondering about you now. Amy, you sound like you're really on the road to self-destruction. I've got to be honest with you. Now, don't mistake this for me giving a crap. I'm just saying it really sounds that way. Yeah, I know. Like, and I'm sure you hear that from everybody, blah, blah, blah. But do you see it that way? Yeah. You do? Mm-hmm. But you don't want to do anything about it or you can't do anything? No, I do. I just don't want to leave home. And I don't want to be in, like, this place for 16 months. Well, you know something? It might be the best thing for you. 16 months, like it's like a vacation. What? They make you make your bed, they make you go to these meetings and you meet a lot of people that if at the end of 16 months you don't feel like doing it, you met new people to get drugs from. The people are awful that you meet. Well, they're drug addicts, Amy. Yeah, man. You're not going to the cotillion. If they want to put you away for 16 months, I mean, don't you understand that that means you have a pretty serious problem at this point? Yeah. It sounds like, I mean, on the outside, just from the limited info we have, it really sounds like you're f'ed up. You're going to break your mama's heart. You'll probably end up dead is what it's going to happen, like relatively soon. Yeah, can we have a contest and have the listeners guess when you OD? Yeah, can we have your sister call us when you die so we can have a contact? You're probably going to get a nasty call because that's a messed up thing to say. Well, Amy, that's reality though. If you don't go get help soon, what do you think is going to happen to you? You're going to be dead. You're going to OD and no one is going to be there to help you and they're just going to find you covered in green vomit, all blue. Your hair will be messed up. You don't vomit or anything. You just pass out. We might as well capitalize on it if you don't care about your life. Yeah, we can give away some pretty cool prizes. We're like vultures over here. We see a carcass and we just start pecking at it. I can see that. You're going to be homeless soon. You're like our poor man's Dana Plato. Can we have that? Instead of the motorhome, you can put her in a wild van. You want to live in a wild van until you OD? Amy, we feel like we know you now. That's why I'm not going to lie. I'm a little concerned. Rehab is for quitters. Thank you, Joe, you ass. Flying A. That old gag. She's no quitter, Amy. She sticks right through it. That's cool. I didn't say I don't plan on not doing it anymore. You'll do heroin again. Think? Yeah, because you're not going into any program or anything. No, that's not true. I tried bargaining with my mom to tell her that I'll do an outpatient. But she said no. I understand why she said no. Let's back up again. A couple days ago when you called to play stoner spelling bee, right? Is it true you got out of rehab that day? Yeah. Is it also true that they found dope on you that day? Yeah. Okay, thank you. I rest my case. How long were you in rehab? It was 21 days. It was a terrible place, though. I've been in rehab before. That was not an normal rehab. It was a terrible rehab. What was wrong with it? It was bad. They had no eating, no drinks, no nothing. All you did was wander around. All you did was walk around. Really? Wander around looking for dope. So now maybe if you go into a long-term rehab program, you won't have heroin on you the day you get out. That's what they're probably thinking. You know, because you'll probably just fall, especially if you don't have a home now. That's the best thing. Somebody who's doing heroin, trying to kick it, and now they're homeless. You might want to pick out a nice shopping cart on this corner to sit on. Yeah, you'll be hooking. No, I won't be. And we've got to take a break. I'm not ready to let Amy go. We've got to talk to you a little more before you make your decision, okay? No, if I hang up, that's just because I had no choice. That's because your mom? Yeah, she came in or whatever. We'll get to you as quickly as possible. Just run through spots and stay on the line. We'll have Rick monitor the line. If something crazy is going on, we'll break right into commercials, okay? All right. All right, stay right there. There's not as funny as a sinking schoolboy. I have a strong stomach. You guys make me throw up. I'm great. The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. O&A, my two new favorite hordes. You guys are really horrible. Hopefully you have them today. What a couple of asswipes. 1027. WNEW. All right, Anthony, the Diamond Exchange.

What are you people? On dope? Yes, well Amy is. Let's go back to Stoner Amy. Amy. I'm not. You're not Stoner? No, I'm nothing like that. When was the last time you were Stoned? Monday. Monday? Monday. All right, if you're just tuning in, this is Amy from Stoner Spelling Bee. The whole scene a couple days ago, Amy's mom picked up the phone as we were trying to get Amy to smoke pot on our show. It turns out Amy was in rehab that day. Got out of rehab that day and was found with heroin. With heroin. And now her mom has given her an ultimatum. 16 month rehab or she gets thrown out of the house. Tough love. And Amy has decided to not go to rehab. Right, Amy? Right. A lot of people want to talk to you. Wow, I wonder why you're just going to hit the streets then? I don't know. I've never been on the streets before so I don't know. Well maybe you ought to go to the rehab. Just for the roof over your head. Let's go to Bevin. Yes. Hi Bevin. Hi, how are you? Bevin? Yes. What's that, a Beverly Kevin thing? Do you have like female junk and male junk? No. Okay, Bevin. Bevin, what do you have for Stoner Amy? I'd like to get on the bat with how long before she ODs. Well, we were thinking that maybe we could have a contest. If Amy doesn't care about her life, why should we? So we would give out a prize if you guess when Amy ODs. I'd give her four months. Four months tops, huh? Yes, well she'll be out on the street. Yes, so that's going to put some miles on her pretty quick. Yes. Maybe that will scare her straight. I think pretty much. Amy, you think you could last four months on the street? Don't know. Don't know. You've got to hook up with a good pimp. Exactly. That will put you out on the street and you could get some cash for banging or something. All right, let's go to Steve. Hey Steve. Steve? Yes. You're a professional psychologist? Psychotherapist with a special scene addiction. Okay, Stoner Amy is on the line with you. Amy, now you're using your best judgment right now. Why don't you take the suggestion of the people around you? You could always leave this long-term rehab if it doesn't work out. And go where? I'll be two hours away somewhere in upstate. If you were two hours away from heroin right now, you'd be able to find it if you had to. What's the problem with leaving a place that's two hours away if you don't want to be there? That's some good psycho stuff there. Why go in the first place? That was fancy. I know I'm not going to like it. If you were two hours away from heroin, you'd find a way. Amy, you're not supposed to like rehab. Yeah. It's not Disney-hab. It's not summer camp. If you keep on doing what you've always done, you keep on getting what you've always gotten, what makes you think that things are going to turn out any differently if you don't change them this time around? I don't know. I don't know. The psycho battle is not working for me right now. Well. No, Amy, your own thinking is what's not working for you right now. Amy, you know what it is? Everyone's pretty much right. But I can see your point on this whole thing. You don't care what anyone thinks. It's not that. I don't want to go to the 16-month program. I think you've put yourself in a position where you don't have a choice. How many rehabs have you been in, Amy? I don't know. Four. Four. What do you think is going to work for Amy? You need to look at the possibility of a compromise. She doesn't want to go to the 16-month program. Okay, that's understandable. A lot of people who don't have the ability to stay sober for but a few days are not going to commit to 16 months. What's a decent compromise? There are plenty of good programs in Florida that I could probably hook her up with off the air, and I'd be willing to do so for no charge, that are a very happy medium in the area of six months. Some of them are in Boca Raton. They're very nice. Imagine that. They're not nice to Florida. What do you think, Amy? My insurance isn't covering anything else. I have four days left in my insurance. I work for an insurance company right now. Believe me, I know how they work. I know how to negotiate them. I can help you with that. This might be a guy to talk to. Maybe if that was six months. Steve, would you do this for free, or would you want Amy to give you a hummer? What's the deal here, Steve? Just a concerned listener trying to help a fellow listener? Not that I have anything against hummers, but while operating in a professional capacity, that would be contraindicated via my ethics. Right, of course. I just do it because she's obviously a friend of the show. You guys are obviously a big asset for the mental health of the greater Tri-State. Yes, we do try. I'd be giving just a little bit back from where I've gotten. Amy, you would think about six months instead of 16? Mm-hmm. Very good. All right, Steve, hold on the line. Okay. Let me get Steve's info. We've got to make sure he's in. We'll give it to Amy. We'll give it to Amy. Let's go to Jay. Jay, you're next. A very special Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony, The Intervention, starring Amy. Stoner Amy comes back in her most challenging role yet on The Opie and Anthony Show as the heroin addicted girl. Opie and Anthony, the two biggest hypocrite asswives on the face of the earth, turn face and try to be good guys and get Amy off the H. Amy? And on to their Johnson's. A Quinn Martin production. Mom's not home yet, huh? Not yet. Okay, you're on the line with Jay, an ex-drug addict. Hey, Jay. Yeah, how you doing, guys? All right. Amy, listen. Jay, you want to buy some coke, man? Yeah, right. No, Amy, listen. What you need to do is get yourself to social services and get into the drug and alcohol counseling. Social services. That's what you need to do. That's what I did and it worked for me. And you also have to dump all the people that get you involved in that. Ah. That's the deal. That's the way to do it. And it's not easy. But once you do it, you'll be better off for it. And it's the people that you hang out with that bring you down. Ah, people who hold their own aspirations. Yeah. And you're never going to get out of it. And that's just the way it's going to go. Do your friends all... Amy? Hmm? Do your friends all like to do heroin and stuff? No. No? No. Well, what the hell are you doing? You mean you don't hang out with the fast crowd? No. The drug-doing crowd? No. Doesn't sound like you have many friends, though. You got the guy at work that sells you your drugs, right? You get the guy at work that sells you your drugs. And then you got... I have a couple friends, but they basically just drink and stuff. Oh. Well, that's crazy. What are they, pussies? They don't want to do some heroin with you? All right, let's... Do the horse, fags. We're getting every angle of this issue today, Anthony. Jack's on line 11 and he could give an F about Stoner Amy. Jack? Yeah, dudes, it's not Jack. It's Lois. Oh, no. Hey, listen, Amy, pay close attention here. You're calling the two nastiest bastards in radio who generally don't give a rat ass about anybody, and they're trying to help you. Speaking of rat ass... Speaking of rat asses... Good segue, open. Yeah, wait for tomorrow. Thank you. Jack, get down. Lois, go ahead. I mean, you can ask ONA what a nasty a-hole I am, how I rip Spazzy Blunder a new a-hole every day just for the fun of it. I'm telling you, Amy, no one is going to help you other than yourself. If you don't care about your life, I'm being totally serious now. If you don't care enough about your own life to help yourself, there's nothing anybody's going to do to help you. And if you're reaching out for help, then you know what? You got to open your ears and close your gap. And you got to do what is necessary to get yourself off of this. And if you don't want to do that, or if you think 16 months is too long to save maybe another 70 years of your life, then you know what? There's a nice bunch of bridges all along New York City. Pick one and do the swan dive. Woo! Yeah, job! Yeah, we'll be back with more Sally Jessie after this, when Amy will be confronted by a drill sergeant. Really? You know, this is quite a... They're like the old Geraldo show. They even have their own personal drug counselor. Yeah. After we exploit the guests, we get them help. That's it. Dude, this crap pisses me off. I'll tell you why. Because if an asswipe like Spaz with a loser life like he has can just keep going every day, and coming to work, and making an effort to make the show funny, even though he's the biggest douchebag walking, this woman, this girl, this ditz, I cannot comprehend for the life of me why the hell she's wasting our time when we could be doing something interesting like shaking girl boobs on the radio. All right, Louis. Thank you, Louis. True. Oh, God. There goes Louis. Yeah, we're just about done with this. Jay, you're the last call, I guess. Jay? Yeah, hi. How you doing? What's up, ONA? How you been? Great. Anyways, listen, Amy, just to let you know, I mean, basically, I'm going to give you like three months, because drug is basically the bad news. And let me tell you something. You don't want to mess around with drugs. I've seen people in the hospital. I sat with people who are on drugs in hospital, and it's not a pleasant sight. And they really want to try to help you. And the only best advice I can tell you is I'm telling you, get off the drugs, because that's no way to go. I mean, it's really bad news. I mean, in possibility to get caught with drugs, it's almost basically a criminal offense. She hasn't said anything in like the past three phone calls. I think she's OD'd. Yeah. Amy, you're still there. Yeah, I mean, look, Amy. No, shut up, Jay. Amy, you still there? Yeah, I'd like to say the call. He really told me, didn't he? He's a big pot shot, huh? This is the type of attitude she probably gives the people at the rehab center. I don't know, at her mom or sister. You don't want to tell me. I'll do my drugs. I can handle it. Right. Right, Amy? You're like a tough cookie. I never said I was still doing the stuff. You will, though. You were doing it three days ago. Three days ago, yeah. Don't get... Slow down. Slow down, is that what I mean? Yeah. I don't think you're... Amy, are you like a sports person? I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. I'm not a sports person. Is he a drug addict? No. No? Just left mommy? Huh? He just left mommy? Just left you guys? Uh, I don't really know exactly. Wow. You're not allowed to talk about daddy in the house? No, I just don't care to. There's an issue. Yeah, there's one. No, it's not an issue. He called here sometimes. No, believe me, it's an issue. All right. Yeah, it's an issue. Yeah. It's really not. No, Amy, it is. All right, Amy, we're going to let you go for now. All right, guys, good, because I just saw my mom pull up. Wait, what? Wait, we want to talk to your mom. No. No, I'm serious. Listen, I got to find out what's going on. Well, so do we. Yeah. We need some closure here. All right, well, maybe if you let my ex-boyfriend Billy through, he might be able to fill you in. Why Billy? Because he knows what's going on and stuff, and he listens to your show every day. Okay, let's talk to Billy. Are you, uh... You got his number? Are you going to keep in touch with us? No matter if you're homeless or in rehab? Hey, what do you want me to do, call you collect? Yeah, you could call me. I don't care. Okay. We need the stoner Amy updates. All right, well, I gave the guy whoever was answering the phone Bill's number, so... All right, now, Amy, what are the odds of you going into rehab tomorrow? At zero. Ugh. Pretty small. She's not going. No? No. Listen, listen. Is your mom getting in the house right now? She's going to be any minute. Any second? She's parked in the car right now, so I'm going to go. All right, guys? All right. It was nice talking to you. Well, stay in touch. Let us know if you die. All right, I will. Okay. Bye. There she goes. Stoner, heroin addicted Amy. All right. Cool. This is like, uh, Maury. Maury. That did a lot of good. And next guest, Amy. Doing drugs. We'll talk to her and then try to get her help. Like we care. All right, let's, uh... I mean, it's such a... it's so ridiculous. Let's change directions. Jessica. Hey, what's up? How you doing? All right. Listen, I was wondering if maybe you could change the contest. Yeah. You can change it to, uh, which happens first, Amy ODs or you guys get syndicated? Amy ODs. Yeah. Do you think so? Oh, yeah. Three months? Yeah, tops. All right. All right. Bye. And we got to take a break. Yes. We will continue with Love Line after this. Love Line. It sounds like, you know, when they get the drug chicks, they call up sometimes and they feign like they care. All right. We got an update on our rat thing that we're doing tomorrow. Yeah. We got Adam Farrar in the studio. Adam Poppin. We got Foot in the studio. All right. We'll talk to those guys next. Okay. Cool. Also coming up in a little while, uh, the Psycho Mark prank from yesterday. It's definitely worth a replay. A lot of people talking about that today. Yeah. Pretty funny. So lots to come on the ONA show. Stay there. Hello? I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here. That has no place on this show. I know that. O.T. and Anthony. More stupidity on the way. 1027 WNEW. Hey, Anthony. A lot of instant feedback coming in here. Uh, Rich from the City about Stoner Amy.

Home by Infinity Broadcasting. This is 1027 WNEW News. All right, we're back. 212-757-1027 is our number if you have anything for the show today. Hanging with Foote. An Adam Ferraro today, of course. Hello. Are you guys plugging things? Sure. Let's get some plugs out of the way. Foote? Sure. We're at Broke Ridge tomorrow night Friday and the next night Saturday with the guys from Air 6, so call up and make your reservations now. Very good. And Adam Ferraro, taping something for Comedy Central. I will be doing my one-man show at PS 122. What? 150. Wait a minute, I've got to read it off the card. It's career day. Wait a minute. You're at a school? No, PS stands for performance space, Mulan. Well, you're just talking about like a school. It is a school. It's career day. PS 122, performance space 122. What is that? I don't know. I didn't build a theater. PS is public school. Okay, I agree with you. Performance space? It says performance space 122. It's PS 122. That's a school. Don't blame me, baby. Adam's going to be a Christian. PS 122, here's to me. They're going to push the bye-bye birdie set to the side so you can do your set. I'll be playing an abscessed tooth in a dental hygiene play. PS 122. Right after Oklahoma leaves the space. Right after Powderpuff, Alomar will be performing. Don't blame me. What is that? It's performance space 122. No, it's a school. No, PS 122 is a school. No, it's not. Isn't PS for public storage? He's going to be playing with the couch. Public storage. I'm in him with the bodies from the serial killer. You sure that's a place? That's what the Toyota Comedy Festival told me. You're here at this night. And what is it? Is it a club? What is it? It's a source of embarrassment whenever I tell you stuff like this. Is it a club? No, it's a theater. A theater. Did you hook up with someone from the Internet and they're telling you to go to PS 122 tonight? I'm going to barrel your size. PS 122. You're going to go to PS 122 tonight. It's the most romantic place in the world. I'm going to go to PS 122. You're going to go to PS 122. I'm going to go to PS 122. I'm going to go to PS 122. I'm going to go to PS 122. A theatre! A theatre! Did you hook up with someone from the internet and they're telling you to go to PS122 tonight? You've got to barrel your size. PS122. PS122. It's got his own channel. Okay. Alright. That's great. You want the rest of the address? No, where are you shooting your next thing? John Glenn High School? No, that's a theatre! That's not a high school. It says high school, but it's just to throw the people off so they don't show up. Next week I'll be on the Circle Line. Yeah. I'll be performing behind that big steel grate that used to shut the hallways down at night. PS122, but it ain't a school. I'll be at the VFW Hall. The Sun's Italy dinner. I'll be at John's Deli. It's a hospital. Are you the entertainment for a prom? And you're not telling us? We wouldn't do that, would we? Like you're thinking, no. Maybe I... No. No. Okay. Performance Space 122. Performance Space? That's what they told me. Who's on first? A naked chick juggling candle sticks in a tutu? Performance Space 122. Performance Space 122. Area 51. Better known as the front of Trump Towers. There's only one explanation for white tile in a dressing room. He's going to pull up his... An olive garden! That's what it is! My school called it steel grates. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. I'm going to be a steel grater. There's only one explanation for white tile in a dressing room. He's going to pull up his... An olive garden! That's what it is! My school called its theater the auditorium. So it's marked with Staten Island. TJ, the rat skull of... Hey TJ. Adam Pruitt was coming to my school. Get out of here. You go to PS122? No, I just live nearby. I've seen it around. So is it a school? I think so. I've seen PS120 something. PS122 is a converted school at Nauvoo. It's a converted school at Nauvoo. It's a converted school at Nauvoo. It's a converted school at Nauvoo. It's a converted school at Nauvoo. PS122 is a converted school at Nauhaus's theaters. It does? I don't know. I read them as I see them. Terry on line three wants to know if they'll be serving hot lunches during your performance. It's the prep for the SATs. So that's tomorrow and Saturday? Tomorrow and Saturday, 8 o'clock, and it's on the corner, first ever United Street. We're actually giving away tickets. Ladies and gentlemen, put your number two pencils together for Adam Ferrara. That's funny. Don't turn the page until he's done. Why don't we give some tickets out now? How many you got? We got some here too. What did they send over? Saturday. We gave away five more pairs for Friday. Really? All right. We got five pairs of tickets to see Adam Ferrara tomorrow night at PS122. Bring a bag lunch and a permission slip. We'll explain where it is. We'll take the next five callers for the Friday night show, excuse me, Friday night at 212-757-1027. Oh, look at that. I'm on the PS122 website. Are you really? Performance space 122. There it is. All right. Ongoing performances. And if you can't get tickets for that, you can always come to the brokerage and see Joe Curry on Friday or Saturday night. You whore. Dueling plugs. All right. Anthony, I got some great news. Yeah. Adam joined the festivities late. Check out what we're doing tomorrow, Adam. This is sick. What are you doing tomorrow? Have you been watching the CBS Survivor show yet? No, I just saw the program. Great show. We found out that next week you're going to be eating rats on the show. Rats? So why wait till next Wednesday to see it on TV when we can do it on the show tomorrow? Look at the little dream in his eye. Isn't that great? So listen, we got three or four guys that will come down here. They will eat rats. We got four chefs that are going to prepare the rats. Wow. How does one prepare a rat? Well, we're going to have like rat marsala. Rat marsala we decided, right? Rat marsala and some type of lemon. Rat moulin. Rat moulin. We have a French chef coming in to prepare one of the rats. And then we got a professional wine guy that's going to come in with some wine that tastes good with rat. Look at this rat in cream. Gump and wash a fat rat without removing its head. Cover them in a pot with ethyl alcohol and marinate for two hours. Cut a piece of salt pork into small dices and cook slowly to extract the fat. Drain the rat, dredge them thoroughly in a mixture of flour, pepper and salt and fry them in the rendered rat fat for about five minutes. Wow. People actually have recipes. Yeah. Or rat. And the chefs will be preparing it tomorrow. And they get to choose. We're getting the rats from a pet store like the big fat, big ass ugly like city sewer rat type things. Four or five pounders. Big fat rats. And we got guys that will eat rat. Will eat them. Not only that, we're going to take some rat, maybe a little cheese and a Ritz cracker. Me and Albie have a hundred dollar bet. If I put a god damn chef's hat on and some whites and stand out in front of this building with a platter with rat meat, cheese and a Ritz cracker, I guarantee you some schmuck will take it and put it in his mouth and eat it. Because people just do it. You walk through the mall, you see some guy, you want to try some rat? And people are like, oh, I'll try some of that. And they pop it in their mouth, not knowing what it is at all. Dr. Rat, you're going to tell them it's rat? I'll call it something else. We'll get the French word for rat. And I'll say some, you know, raton, whatever they call it. Whatever they call rat. Le rat. What's rat in French, Albie? Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lewis. El rat. Le rat. El is Spanish. I don't know. Le rat. On a Ritz cracker, honey. Yeah. Everything tastes better when it sits on a Ritz. That barn and put a rat on that Chris Ritz cracker. Le vermin. Anthony, Rick's in the back room. He's making sure this is going to happen because a lot of these things fall apart on us. That's why we're overbooking this. We've got four chefs coming down, four guys to eat. A couple people to bring the rats. We need Brian the Eater from earlier to call in and Steve the Chef to call us. We want to make sure you guys are legit and we'll confirm for tomorrow, okay? Yes. And if there's any other people out there willing to eat rat, give us a call. You guys can have your own theme restaurant. ONA's Rat Shack. Doesn't look like a dumpster. Janitor from New York checking in. I can't believe Joe Curry is in a real comedy club and Adam is in a place where he gets served by ladies in hair nets. How did that happen? Must have something to do with the sun, Anthony. Maybe that's it. The sun is exploding. Is the sun exploding? Doesn't anyone... I would think this would be the top story. It seems, Opie, that there's been some bizarre, huge solar activity on the sun. I saw it on the CNN website. The sun has ejected massive bursts of charged particles, billions of tons of charged particles. And where are they headed? Toward Earth. PS-122. Right. Public storage-122. They're headed toward Earth. Headed right towards Earth. And the sun is exploding. And the sun is exploding. And the sun is exploding. And the sun is exploding. Headed right towards Earth. Really? Wait a minute, how many of them? How big? Huge. They said tons and tons of solar particles are traveling at millions of miles per hour and will reach Earth by sometime around sundown tonight and continue for a couple of days bombarding the Earth. What does that mean to you and I, Ann? Well, I'm trying to get some info here. It says the Earth's natural... The rads might be pushed off. They'll cook themselves on the sidewalk. Along with us from solar particles. They'll all get big cooked. But they're never really right. Remember Skylab? Run! There's a fire truck going to hit you in the head. It's coming out of the sky! Yeah, but who wasn't paranoid and kept looking up wondering if they were going to hit that? The sap that gets hit by Skylab landed up coming down in Australia, didn't it? But the Earth's natural electromagnetic field, OP, shields the planet from most harmful effects. But they put a button there. Inverse consequences may occur. What does that mean? I don't know. We're going to lose the Nashville network. Yeah, well that'd probably screw up your cable TV. They do say spacecraft may experience surface charging. So anyone flying around in your spacecraft out there, please pull over to the side until this passes. Those of you with shuttle tickets, you're going to be delayed. Yeah, damn it! Well, we all do have our Jetsons cars. It's the year 2007. There's something weird about Anthony. What about planes and aircraft? I don't know. They're not giving me any info. I think they're afraid. It's a conspiracy, isn't it? So maybe I shouldn't skate in the park tonight? No, I don't know. It's just a bunch of particles. And they say that the aurora borealis... It's just a bunch of particles. That's what the people of Hiroshima said. It's just a bunch of particles. My guy's Muran! Muran! Muran! Muran! Yeah, and they say that the northern lights, the aurora borealis, could be visible as far south as Washington, D.C. now because of these things. So be on the lookout for that as you fry your retinas looking up at the sky, even at night. Laugh than you ever see! Yeah, for all we know, this could be what wiped out the dinosaurs. I have no clue. No one's giving me information. I'm looking at a picture, at a film, on the website, the cnn.com website, of the sun that looks like... We're just doomed! It looks like it's exploding in front of your eyes. Is this the sun or the clip of the Death Star blowing up in Star Wars? I dare you to tell me the difference. That's the backdrop from a doors video. Coronal mass ejection recorded by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. That looks like my colon at the Taco Bell. I have never seen a shot of the sun like this. It's blue! Yeah, and the whole thing is exploding. It looks like that special effects they used in the 70s for music videos. Oh yeah, like the groovy overhead projector with some oil and water, that kind of thing. It actually looks like when the Wizard of Oz got pissed. Stay away from that man behind that... Or it looks like the burner we're going to be using tomorrow to cook the rats. Yeah, it looks like if you're looking down on a stove on a burner and then it blew up. If it just exploded on you. Where did they get it? From space, Adam. It's a picture from... I can't believe that. Actually, this was done in a Disney studio with blue screen photography. That's not the sun, that's goofy! Maybe the dinosaurs face like the deer drinking water. AJ, you want in tomorrow? You want to eat some rat? Yeah. We might need an extra guy. Where are you calling from? Trenton. Trenton. How old are you? 18. Is that old enough to eat rat? 18, I don't know, maybe 21. You can have the rat, you just can't have the wine. Yeah, that's true. And you're going to need the wine. Alright AJ, I think we're going to have to pass. I think we've got to go 21 and older just to cover our asses. Alright. Thanks man. Chuck saying cell phones, jets, satellites, TV reception will be affected. And it will look like a red aurora borealis. You know what really burns my ass? A solar flare 8 million miles long. What's Spaz's take on this sun thing? I think if we clone the sun, we'll have another one and we won't need that one. Last time the sun flared up like this, half of Canada lost its power. Remember that? What was that, 89 or something like that? Yeah, it's all Canada. Let's get Spaz in here. We're not doing as we can review it. Spaz can explain this. Spaz? Oh, Professor Spaz. Could you explain what's going on with the solar flares on the sun? Have you heard about this? No. See there's solar flares. Oh my God, look at his face. He's so boggled and bewildered. Look at this picture. This is a picture of the sun. This is what it did yesterday. See that? So all these particles, billions of tons of atomic particles, solar particles are heading towards Earth and they're going to hit Earth tonight. Tonight, in a couple of hours. At sundown and last for a couple of days, we're going to be bombarded by these particles. Don't look good. They're coming toward us at a million miles an hour. And we've had some emails. People want your take on this since you've done such a good job explaining giant mosquitoes, cancerous live wires, how to clone oil. There's a problem only you can solve. Yes. So Spaz, what's your take on this? We're patiently waiting for you. What can we expect? It won't be affected. It will not be affected. It will not be affected. Why? Because the coldness of space will crystallize the particles and then it will re-burn up when it reaches the Earth's atmosphere and just converting it to another form of maybe liquid or gaseous state. I feel better now. So basically it's just going to rain. The coldness of space? Now I'm thinking that these particles made up of x-rays and things like that, aren't really affected by temperature of space. I'm thinking they just hurtle through the cosmos heading towards us and temperature has nothing to do with what they do. So cold particles aren't as dangerous as warm particles? No, because when it hardens up it turns into another state and thus giving it another identity. And then when it goes into the Earth's atmosphere it's like, how do we put you in a freezer and get you a new identity? You're not a particle. You're an imposter. The particles are actually Clark Kent. That's going to happen. Where were those other particles? I just stepped away for a minute. Another state of terms of New Jersey. So you're saying we're OK because of the coldness of space. But don't you think that the sun is pretty warm? Yes. OK, so now the sun's rays can hit us and it's still pretty warm out when the sun hits us. So why doesn't the sun rays freeze on the way down here? Oh, no, because see, when something is blasted off from its original origin Right. OK, it looks like a ray but it's really like a really, really hot liquid form. OK. The sunlight is heated liquid. It's a hot liquid. You can maybe turn it, yeah, because you're talking about the sun. The sun is a rock, basically a very heated rock. What? OK, so when particles blast off from the heat of the rocks, it's rock. Oh, no, no, the sun isn't rock. The sun is a rock. The sun is a rock. You must have heard that when he was a kid. His father saying, my son's head is like a rock. And then he interprets the sun as a rock. My son's head is made of rock. The sun is rock. No, the sun is a big thing of just gas. It's just burning gas. It's a crap load of hydrogen and it's just burning like a big nuclear furnace in space. But that can be turned into really, really hot liquid which can turn, which rays are interpreted as in that area of space and then thus when coming into space, it uses the word thus to sound more intelligent. That's what I love it. You gotta love it. Thus, thus. He should make us say this. He just screwed it up. No, he uses thus to sound more intelligent. He's using like three or four sides. The sun is a rock. The sun is a rock. It's a very heated rock. You know what? Don't touch the rock. It's very heated. That's hot. Burn yourself. So why would liquid come out of a hot rock? Well, because when it's blasted off, see, when something heats, it pressurizes. Air goes. Yeah, so the pressure builds up so something's gotta pop. No, these are particles. These are like atomic particles. Like supercharged nuclear matter. I'm glad you brought that up. It's particles. I'm very glad you brought that up. Because, yeah, see, when I was back in science class in the old days when I was in school. When you used to suck on the gas from the Bunsen burner. Go ahead. Okay, see, it happens that there are electrons, neutrons and protons within your body. So you treat it, alright, let me do an explanation here. Let's just say in a comparison to sun to a human being. Human being has protons, electrons and neutrons. Right. So basically if some of those electrons bounce into each other, you can have an atomic explosion with your body and self implode. The same thing is happening with the sun. When is that going to happen to you? So the same thing can happen to the sun. It can be a self implosion with the electron. You're so stupid. So we have to worry tonight about the particles hitting our body and causing an atomic reaction and our people blowing up. So anyone on a bumpy train ride home. Yeah, look out for exploding people tonight. Now, first of all, the particles never reach us because of my explanation from before. But if they do, as per his explanation, please see. Okay, so we won't have to worry about the particles hitting us. But if they did. But if they did, it would land us most likely in liquid form, thus seeping into our pores. Seeping into our pores? And if like, I guess, same like electrons, protons and neutrons, so it's just two plus is smashed into each other, we could have a self implode. Oh my God. The sun is composed of helium and hydrogen, you tool. It's made of gas like the crap between your ears. I'm stupefied. Yeah, well, thank you for that explanation. As per spaz, whereas his explanation air to thus, we will not have to worry because they turn to liquid and freeze in space. Wow. But you do have to worry about those three criminals from Krypton stuck in that square thing getting blasted out and giving Superman a really hard time tonight. Explain that one spaz. Thank you spaz. Dr. Spaz, once again explaining stuff. Don't worry, we can review tomorrow with spaz. Spaz Einstein. Anthony, we got to take a break. Please. We got the Psycho Mark prank from yesterday. If you missed it yesterday, stick around. It's unbelievable. We'll explain the whole thing right after we take a break. As we go to break, someone that's going to be in the studio tomorrow with us, Anthony, a very funny comedian, Brian Regan. I believe he has some audio of spaz. Stephen Hawking just fell out of his wheelchair. After spaz explaining this whole science thing, here's Brian Regan, a bit called Stupid in School, and he'll be live in studio tomorrow. Cope and Anthony. The big yellow one is the sun. It's the sun. And it's big. The yellow one is the sun. And it's a rock. What's going on with the sun? It's exploding. It's a big blob of crap that's been burning for a few billion years. Who's to say it won't just go, pssst, at any given moment. Look how freaking out. You see the picture, that solar flare-up thing? It looked like the whole surface of the sun just left it for a minute. What if it doesn't relight? All right, cut it out. You ever see when the barbecue goes like, it burns out and then all of a sudden it goes and comes back again? What if it just goes and doesn't come back? Someone get Amy. I can't handle reality right now. We'll have to shoot a rocket into the sun. I like my space being about six inches from my body. I don't like thinking about anything too cosmic. Oh, he freaks out at this stuff. He doesn't like it. He doesn't like the whole concept of endless space. The sun and the planets just kind of spinning around it for a few billion. Who's to say it just won't just go, tomorrow? It ends tomorrow. The sun just goes, pssst, why do we take for granted that it'll just be there tomorrow? Cut it out. And there'll be plenty of time for us to just freeze to death. Don't worry, Opie. I'm sure the ensuing anarchy before everyone dies will clear out about half the population of people just being killed and raped. And then the rest of them will just freeze to death. Anthony, great segue here. End of days on pay-per-view. Ah, look at that. End of days. I've come to save you, Opie. This is great. This is great. End of days. Has anyone seen End of Days? We've got to talk about it for 60 seconds. I haven't even seen the movie. Now, Donald Schwarzenegger, Kevin Pollock. It is still a genuine fear of the unknown into the masses. What? Story takes the audience on a whirlwind ride from Vatican City to New York's sordid Times Square while touching on present-day topics that have engrossed the world the end of the millennium. The sun is a rock. The sun is a big rock in End of Days. And it's hurling liquid, the frozen liquid out of it. Let's go to your paws. Yeah, a whole bunch of things. Doomsayers predicted the Y2K breakdowns, planetary alignments, and destruction of the Earth by earthquakes, meteor showers, and a solar flare, Opie. Wow. The rest of the world lays in wait, unsure of the future, thus setting the stage for End of Days. Come see my movie, End of Days. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Pollock, in End of Days. All right, that's a minute. End of Days, today on Time Warner Home Theater. Comcast in demand. Order it now. And Cablevision, pay-per-view. Movies made to order. Check out End of Days and make these people happy, please. Please, I beg you. Hello. Opie. What is it going to take for us to fit you off to the point where you're going to change the station? That's what I need to know. Shove it. Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on the show, isn't it? That's going to be trouble. Opie and Anthony. They just received a Ph.D. in Cupidity. 1027. WNEW. Opie? Yes, Anthony? Because of the solar flares, I'm going to try to see if it works like the movie Frequency. Did you see that one? I was able to talk back in time with his dead father. I'm going to try to contact myself on a C.B. and tell myself not to go out with Dreamweaver. I'll just write the whole thing off. Very nice. Breaker, breaker. Maybe we could get in touch with Diamond Dust tonight. Or The Wrangler. April, help me out here. Hi, guys. This is April. I wanted to join your party tomorrow. You want to eat rats? Yeah. You guys need a girl. Will you eat the rats naked? Naked? Why? Like, eating rats aren't bad enough. Yeah, naked is fine, I guess. As long as they're cooked. No, I mean you naked. Oh, no. I don't think so. Oh, I don't think so. No. All right. Do we need a girl to come down to eat some rats? All right. Yeah, we would like a girl down here to eat some rats. Why not, man? All right. Hold on the line. Rick will talk to you. Okay. It is shaping up to be a fine day tomorrow, Anthony. Yes. Brian Regan in studio and people eating rats. All right. You want to play the Psycho Mark thing from yesterday? Yeah. I got to hear this again. Okay. Adam didn't hear that. I didn't hear it. Foot didn't. Foot heard this. All right. If you want to play along at home, there's plenty of pictures from this wonderful prank from yesterday. Show Anthony. Yes. On foundrymusic.com. F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com. Basically, the premise because we're going to pick it up when Psycho Mark is... Duck tape to the chair here. Yeah. Basically, this girl, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, called in and said she wanted to meet Psycho Mark. Oh, now Adam's... Okay. You got it now? I got it now. So, this girl calls in and says, hey, I think Psycho Mark's hot, blah, blah, blah, I want to meet him. Psycho Mark has this reputation with women and harassing them and stuff, so we tricked Psycho Mark by saying, look, we'll let you meet this girl that sounds hot on the phone. I don't want this to be used against me someday. So we said, Psycho Mark, you can meet her if we're allowed to duct tape you to the chair so you don't like harass her. That's how we got him. Okay. So he couldn't move. Then Anna came in. Anna? Yeah. Anna and messed with Psycho Mark. And then, boy, look at the shock on Psycho Mark's face when he finds out that it was a guy. Psycho Mark buries himself in this prank though. Yeah. You'll hear how hot he thought she was. So I guess we pick it up, Anthony, in studio with Psycho Mark in the corner, duct tape to a chair, waiting for this, this quote, fan to come in to meet Psycho Mark. We got him really good yesterday. Pictures, foundhermusic.com. You know, check out the pictures as the audio plays. Okay? All right. We'll be back in a little bit. Hey, Anthony. Mujan, Anthony, Mujan. Mujan. Yes, yes. Come on. How many times do we have to tell you people? The way to remove hair from around your genitals is with Mujan. And anywhere else you have hair. What, your face? Like your shoulders? Legs? Your back? Whatever, whatever you need removed. Everywhere you have hair and if you want it to grow back thinner and lighter than ever, use Mujan. Not shaving. Oh, it ends up looking like, oh my God, forget about it. I got to state the obvious, Anthony. No one else will. Go ahead. Why the hell are we talking about a wax removal thing? Because we like ladies that are well waxed. You don't want to go to the beach and see things poking out the side of a bikini like Larry Fine's head from the Three Stooges. So are we experts at this? What's our angle? Being a guy, I believe we are experts in looking at female crotches. Okay. Especially at the beach in bikinis. You can spot a well kept one. Right. You straighten up the front room. It's only polite. Exactly. Now if you see a bikini and there's hair bushy out the side, you get turned off, right? Well, likewise, if you see a whereas, if you see a two, thus, if you see a bikini and there isn't hair but there is razor stubble and razor burn and it's all red and rashy. You don't want your cheeks getting all rashy. No, no, no. It looks like somebody threw London broil on the barbershop floor. You don't want it to look like that. Mujan removes the hair, Opie. I believe we are qualified to speak about that. I'm assuming it's an easy thing. Very easy. You get a little container of this stuff. You can put it on hot or cold, rip it off, your hair is gone, nice and smooth, blah, blah, blah. Right? I have an applicator in my pants. If any girls need that. Then you tuck the rest of it under and you dance for Psycho Mom. Very nice. Hyperallergenic removes hair completely. No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate your skin and it leaves any region you want to remove hair from feeling smooth and silky. Wouldn't the logical thing be to like do it live on the air to a chick? Why don't we do that? Alright, if you want to get Mujan'd, give us a call. Mujan'd, the most desirable way to remove hair for the world's most desirable women, Anthony. Mujan'd is available at Dwayne Reid, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve's Drugs and Cosmetics Plus and if you don't see Mujan'd, just ask your store manager to bring it in for you. Mujan'd. Fran is 84 years old. Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran. I'm sorry. No anal is okay. Dwayne Rex Radio. The O.B. and Anthony Show. 1027 WNEW. 212-757-1027. Hanging out with Foot and Adam Ferraro today. We are rocking. We are rocking. Tomorrow's another big day on the O&A show. Brian Regan coming in. Very funny guy. You'll laugh your yam bag off tomorrow, I promise you that. And we have a bunch of our listeners eating rats on our show tomorrow, Anthony. We're going to have to get the spaz cam hooked up for that tomorrow. Real rats, man. We're going to cook them up. We have a couple of chefs coming down and they're going to do quite a job cooking these things. We're going to have some, I think, Marsala and then some rat in a lemon sauce. Paging rats. People are going to eat this. People are going to eat rats on our show. I'm going to try to get some people to eat some rat samples on the street. I'm going to have a goofy chef hat on and some whites and the big platter. Would you like to try some samples of some raton? We'll get plenty of video. Rat tattooing. Yeah, we'll have still shots of the whole thing. Rat T.O. and the spaz cam. So you'll be able to check out what we're checking out. Yeah, a lot of fun. Anthony, your favorite entertainer has made it out of the hospital after bleeding for a week from his ass. Was Adam Ferrara bleeding from his ass? He has all passed up and he'll be at PS122 in a diaper. Yeah, Bob Hope is... Yeah. A lot of people thought he was checking out, but he surprised everyone. He was released yesterday morning, I guess. Well, when you saw the pictures of him in the paper and everything and the tabloids have been reporting that he's ready to drop dead any minute, all his friends are dead. You know, Bing and Jimmy Stewart and all the people from Hollywood. Lindbergh. Jesus. Lincoln. They're all dead. And it looked like this was the final curtain for an old C-slope nose himself. What was it that caused the bleeding? I ate something. I don't know what happened. Here's a sample. Bob, would you like some rat tioli? Yeah. Give me some of that rat. I need to get some solids down in there. There we go. So, Bob, that's a gas. Now, when that gas hits the cold air, does it change to a liquid form? Yeah. It's like solar particles or something. Ah, there goes some of that. So your ass is basically a hot rock. Is that what you're telling us? Yeah, he's not dead yet. You can't count out old Bob. No, he's hanging in there at 97. He's like a star. Still alive. No matter what you do. I lay in the house, but I saw Bing and everybody else in the light. Sammy Davis Jr. over in colored heaven. Oh! What? Hey, come on. Come on, it is heaven, isn't it? Little blue human. I also saw that fag, Peter Lawford. Remember him? He was part of the rat fag. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was giving Sammy some skull. What? Yeah, Sammy was singing Candyman while he popped his eye out. Let Peter Lawford get it, isn't he? What about Brooke Shields? She's a little bit of a fag. What about Brooke Shields? She's hot, huh? How about that Brooke Shields? I liked her when she was nine. Really? And all my CBS specials I used to do. When I was over in Vietnam, boy, my ass looked like Da Nang. I gotta tell you. Napalm? Hey, Delarcus, you wanna clean that up? My wife of 78,000 years, Delaris. Gotta love her. She's stuck by me. What a tool. If she would have left earlier, is she gonna get money and spend it before she was a living fossil? Now she's probably gonna drop dead right after me. It could be as soon as a week. Oh, boy. Yeah, so he'll be with us a lot longer. At least another week. He went quick. Like, he went down the slide pretty quick. It seems like only a few years back he was still making some kind of appearances. Swingin' a golf club. Yeah. I still play golf with Ronald Reagan. Yeah, in the kitchen. Every week. Swingin' a golf club. We play one hole 18 times. Brand new does, every hole. That old gag. How many times you gonna make me say that? Wonderful. So, Godspeed, Bob Hope. Godspeed to ya. Hangin' in there. Old red eyes. Also, we're doin' a little mop up here. We gotta talk about other things in the news. Anthony, the serial killer. You guys have any thoughts on the serial killer? What does he survive? Gallon drums. Go figure. He sure didn't fit the profile of a serial killer. What was the profile? Big goofy guy. Got the girls through the internet. And they came up and, boy, how do you treat a lady? You cut her up and put her in a 55-gallon drum. What was the guy's name? Robinson? It was something like that. Yeah, Jack Robinson. So like Edward G. Robinson. Man. Man. Okay, Rocky, take the boys and sit on the house. Man. You got it wrong. If you put the girls in the drums, you can clone them. Well, it's a way of making fuel. Fossil fuel. Fossil fuel. Unleaded women. They got a picture of him in the paper. And it just, I mean, they should have picked this guy up just on the way he looked. Oh, he's got that pedophile gleam in his eye. Yeah. Does he have the three first names, Anthony? Yeah, he's got a middle name. He's got that wacky serial killer middle name. Not like John Wayne Gacy, the fun clown serial killer. Boy, a big fat guy that dressed as a clown for the children. Boy, you wouldn't suspect him as being a child-touching maniac. Person killer. Bunch of fags buried in his basement. They're still digging him up. They're still digging him up. I know. Like they filled up his basement and then they said, why don't we break up his patio and see if there's stuff under there? Oh, guess what they found? More dead homosexuals. Dressed like a clown. And people right up until they killed him were writing to him to get his paintings because he went into painting in prison, I hope. Yes, he did. There's a happy little tree. I'm just going to paint because it's our world. And look what's buried under that tree. A homosexual. Look at that. Look at this. Right here I'm going to dip into this skin tone and just paint a nice nine-year-old boy buttocks right here. Because it's your world. You put that penis anywhere you want. There's a guy dancing for Psycho Mark. Yeah, here it is. Now I'm just going to stick my stuff in this Lizarin crimson and blot it all over the canvas because that's human blood. A lot of that was around my house because I dressed like a clown. What, were the police stupid? How long did it take them to find me? It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Yeah, I sure hope they don't check my house. Yeah, I like dressing as a clown. Most likely to be a serial killer. Shelby Louis Anderson! I don't want to be exposed as a big puffy fag that I am. I've resorted to killing the people that I seduce with cash and booze because God knows I can't get with a body of mine. Well, they're up to six bodies and still counting. Dressed like a clown. They were all found in oil drums? Show me my ass! Five so far. I've tried to turn murder into comedy. Well, we're getting lots of requests for the serial killer song. We only play this when there's a serial killer that's been caught or on the loose there. I like anything that has food in it. It's a serial whatever. Show me Captain Grinch! Show me Captain Grinch! Show me Pony! Show me bunghole! Well, let's play this and we'll be back to play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show today. Very educational. I made quite a splash. I hacked and I slashed my way to the top of page one. The cops even checked, but they didn't suspect I was carving up fellers for fun. Guess I never thought I'd finally get caught. I hope that they all rest in peace. Cause I'm locked away, what more can I say? Except what I told the police. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. I got arms and legs and a few faces stashed all around. In different parts of town. Well, I met them in bars on a friendly basis. Now I got them in jars and flower vases. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. I know I was wrong. I just don't belong. I guess you've heard that one before. But the guys, they all dig me. I'm like Eleanor Reapy. There's a face in a jar by my door. I must be insane. Got an abnormal brain. What else could I do to get laid? The guys that I date had a terrible fate. They ended up lightly sauteed. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. In crawl spaces, every shape and size. And all races, all blood and guts. And I must be nuts. Well, I got one that'll really kill you. I'm the poster child for necrophilia. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. Well, I got friends in crawl spaces. I'm the **** that made Milwaukee famous. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. You want a little dose of honesty? You find it here on the O.P. and Anthony show. They're a couple idiots. Filthy, disgusting, greasy idiots. Anthony, Time Out New York. Weekend almost upon us.
