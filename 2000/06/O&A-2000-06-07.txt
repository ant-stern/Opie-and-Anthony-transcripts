More and more vehicles. Every day with the wow stick around. And then Wednesday, you just see them all. Thank you, thank you for the support out there, ladies and gents. So many. What was I going to say? Blah, blah, blah. Oh, yeah, I get a lot of emails from people. Happens every year. They're like, hey, I've been seeing this wow thing on cars on the highways. And I see your call letters. So could you please tell me what wow means? Oh, please. Somebody doesn't know? You put a wow on your vehicle. Either one of our stickers or you make your own. I've seen a lot of those. Just a wow written on anything. Taped to your window. Taped on your backpack. Whatever the hell. Wherever you want to put it. And if a girl sees it and feels so inclined, I'm going to show you her bare breasts. Ow! Oh, come on. Is she happy with my large boobs? Yes, she is, Dr. Smith. Oh, you're very naughty. Yes, she is, Dr. Smith. It is the greatest radio promotion ever invented. Yes. I challenge you to find something greater. It's one where everybody out there with a sticker can be a winner, as they say. You don't have to be searched out for your eyes or anything. You put it on your car and that's it. Yeah, we don't do stupid radio contests here where we try to pull you over and give you $100 for having the radio station bumper sticker on the back of your car. Yeah, that's stupid. No one wins those, please. Hundreds upon hundreds of our listeners every single day win at the Ripple About Wednesday concept. You win boobs. Seeing bare breasts in the comfort of your own vehicle. Hey, Mark, what's going on? Mark! Ah, our phones aren't working yet. The buttons all f-ed up again. Hey, Mark, what's going on? This is Bill from Westchester. Hey, Bill, what's up? What's going on? I just got flashed by two beautiful blondes in a Corvette going down to Taconic Parkway. There you go. I'm on my way to college right now for graduate school. I recently got divorced and that was the best damn divorce present I've ever seen. Is this the first time you've gotten wowed? This is the third time. Actually, this is the first time I've gotten through. Wow, you're doing well out there. I told them to pull over and unfortunately they just had to keep going. I would have been late for class for that, no doubt. He's in a teedy rich environment. He's doing well. There's a lot of people out there. We hear from you every week, Hey, man, I've had the wow in my car for five weeks. Nothing's happened yet. Just be patient. Just put the wow in your car and when you least expect it, you're going to see boobs most likely. Boobs! We hear from the ladies every single week. They're doing it all the time. I love it too. Some of the problems the ladies are having, they're just not seeing enough wows out there, Anthony. They dress appropriately for Whip-A-Mail Wednesday and they're on the highway but they're like, I would have flashed. I just didn't see any wows today. I don't see any wow stickers out here. What are you insane? If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling. Yeah. Trolling for breasts. Simple as this, if you're a fan of the show, just please put wow in your car. That's all. And just go about your business. Because it also shows who the other psychopaths are that listen to the Opie and Anthony show out there. It works both ways. He just farted. You caught that crap. There can't be any farting in this studio. You think he's funny, man. Why are you farting? A lot of people on the radio want you to put their stickers on your vehicle. That's just the way it is. But they don't give you anything in return. We're giving you nip. You know what I see all the time when I'm driving around with my wow sticker? What? And people don't know who I am, which is cool. You're on the highway and all of a sudden another person will pull up to you, they have a wow sticker and they'll just give you the thumbs up like, alright man, cool. You listen to those guys as well. Well, I'm one of those guys, but yeah, I do. Stop farting, man. Get out! Oh, you people. Hey, I've gotten a couple of emails so far. I had nothing to do with the five women found in the 55-gallon drums. I swear to God. Did you hear about that? Get the serial killer saw. First of all, yesterday we were talking, I forgot, to a couple of ladies and I brought up the fact that would you fit nicely in a 55-gallon drum. I remember you saying that. And then I turn on the news this morning and in Missouri, I guess, five women were found in 55-gallon drums. And believe me, I had no prior knowledge of this. I don't know, am I being blamed for this? I couldn't be in Missouri. Now, they already arrested the guy. Yeah, he was one of those internet freaks that was meeting, you know, women through the internet and then throwing them in 55-gallon barrels at them. And people wonder why when they say, oh, we met on the internet, people always give the look like, oh, really? Because what is your image of a guy that's looking for girls on the internet? Serial killer. Serial killer, pedophile. Right. Pedophile, mass murderer, something. Yeah, I don't know where you would even go to find legitimate people on the internet because you don't know who you're dealing with. You might as well, what, people thinking computers are different, you might as well just pick up the phone, dial random numbers and go, hey, you want to go out? Because that's what it is. That's a chance you're taking. And this internet guy there in Missouri, they're saying he's the next Jeffrey Dahmer. They found five bodies so far and they're thinking there's many more. What happens in your life that you're hacking women up and putting them in barrels? Psycho Mark. You know what? They found three in another one of those storage places. Jeez. Can you imagine the stuff that are in storage places that they just haven't discovered yet, haven't even seen yet? Because you could seal them things up nice and tight with a gasket. The smell won't get out, Hopi. I guarantee you that. Hey, maybe it was Spaz trying to make some oil. Use some crude oil. Oh, God. Unbelievable, though. I mean, what goes wrong in your life that you have to hack people up and put them in barrels? Bobby. Yeah, hello. How are you, Bobby? Fine, fine. Was that Hopi? Hopi, let's go. We're in a really good mood today. Okay, terrific. It's not like yesterday where it was a crappy raining day and we just flat out socked and then pulled the show out of our butt. I'm in a great mood today. We need your help today. Let's go. We're down by the East River. Me and my cousin Danny, we were just hanging out, lauding. We looked down in the water and I see this helmet floating. So I pulled the helmet out of the water and had that guy's name in it, Sadie Wade, whatever his name was, that guy that fell off the Williamsburg Bridge with that accident a month ago. We turned it into the police, and the police tell us that some kids were fishing there a couple weeks earlier, and they pulled a luggage bag out of the water, and there were three different parts of bodies in this luggage bag. Oh. That was down by Redhulk. All right, well, thank you for that, Bobby. All right, guys. Bye-bye. Did you see the instant feedback from Jonathan Slotsberg? No. You think it's true? What? I live across the hall from Spaz. He and his girlfriend went arguing for hours last night about her car. I heard yelling about him about smacking up the front right side of her car. I looked out the window and saw the damage. Hmm. Ask him about Baby's car. Is that true? Hey, Spaz, quickly, if it's not true, I just like... Yeah, quickly, because we got the serial killer sawing off. Spaz, is that true? Spaz, get over there. Get over there. I don't even think he heard you. I got an email over here saying that you and Baby were arguing last night about the car. No. No? No. I didn't get home until late last night. Oh, okay. Somebody said that they live across from you or something. No, we're isolated. Oh, okay. Isolated. Isolated. Okay. I just want to like checking these things, making sure it's accurate. If the authorities are listening, check. Check. Spaz's basement. 55-gallon drums with Baby number one, Baby number two. Baby number three is in two barrels. All right, Anthony. There's a serial killer that has been caught, so we have to play the serial killer song. We love when this one is able to be pulled out. We only break it out when there's a serial killer in the news, Anthony. Sing along. Sing along, if you will, and we'll go to the phones next. 212-757-1027. I finally get caught. I hope that they all rest in peace. Cause I'm locked away. What more can I say? Except what I told the police. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. I got arms and legs and a few faces stashed all around. In different parts of town. Well, I met them in bars on a friendly basis. Now I got them in jars and flower vases. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. I know I was wrong. I just don't belong. I guess you've heard that one before. But the guys, they all dig me. I'm like Eleanor Rigby. There's a face in a jar by my door. I must be insane. Got an abnormal brain. What else could I do to get laid? The guys that I date had a terrible fate. They ended up lightly sauteed. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. Every shape and size and all races. All blood and goods. Man, I must be nuts. Well, I got one that'll really kill you. I'm the poster child for necrophilia. Oh, I got friends. In crawl spaces. Oh, I'm really cooking now, huh? Well, I got friends in crawl spaces. I'm the b**** that made Milwaukee famous. Oh, I got friends in crawl spaces. Gentlemen, start your wacky. Are you mashing me naked? Overload. Pleasure overload. Oh, it just makes me tangle. K-Man from Jersey on the end of Feedback Anthony? Yes. Hey guys, no explosive diarrhea bits during dinner today. Is that too much to ask? Yeah, I was hearing that that was some pretty gross stuff to listen to during the dinner time. You know Steve from FoundryMusic.com, the unofficial ONA website? Of course. I was listening to it while eating lunch today. I was laughing my a** off, man. The echo makes it the ambient sound. Suzy from Jersey loving the serial killer song. That we only break out when there's a serial killer that has been found around the loose. Special occasion tune, yeah. Alright Anthony, I think we're still in the middle of break here. We've got to talk about Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment. Yes. Maybe if this guy had some things to do in his spare time, he wouldn't be putting women in barrels. Well in Missouri, what the hell are you going to do? Missouri? I don't think Missouri has a Time Out Missouri, do they? No, I don't think so. Best places for cow tipping. What's the best line to use to date your sister? Best place to dump a body.

That's against the law. It should be. We'll be at that meeting. Whip them up. What is that? I just love being naked. Oh, yeah. And E.W. Wow. Moby. Hey, what's up? What's up, all one eight? How's it going? Oh, man, great story. Have you ever talked about people who had the wow sign in the back? Oh, I never get wowed? Yeah. Yeah. I'm driving down, back from the shore Saturday night on a turnpike. I'm not saying things. I forgot I have a wow sign in the back. So right by the airport. I'm in the truck lane. I haven't come home. Oh, should I turn to my left? There's a little, not a little car. There's five boys in the car. I have to turn to my left. I got octisized. You got four women flashing. Four women. The driver is all fun. The four women stood up hanging out the window. They wowed me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ladies, for helping us out with the wow Wednesday. It was phenomenal. It was like I never got wowed before. That was great. They started blowing me kisses and I just got wowed. I was like, oh, I'm going to get a lot of people. I'm going to get a lot of people. I'm going to get a lot of people. It truly is one of the greatest things ever invented. Yeah. Right. That is sliced bread. You know, we don't pat ourselves on the back often, but we will. Oh, but it was, oh, man. Was that, was that something? You see the breastages slapping in the way was very loud. Breastages. And they were from Pennsylvania, too, so I don't know. I must say wow was brilliant. That's a high five, a little pat on the head. I am a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. I'm a man of the heart. Okay. Move about your business. Frank, you're next on any W. You guys rock. I swear to God. I downloaded the wild sticker from the website yesterday. I put up my truck last night. I'm up in Poughkeepsie so we barely get you guys so I'm thinking nobody knows about it up here. I go to the mall, I get out of my truck and I go into my shop and I come back out and there's these two girls standing by my truck. I swear to God and they're looking at me. I said, what's up ladies? And they, that was it. That was it. And they wowed you. Right there in the middle. I'm naming my first born regardless of sex, Opie and Dane. There you go. You guys rock. I love you. Don't change, man. No, we're trying not to. What's up with the syndication, man? Where's that taboo? Who gives a flying F? At this point, who cares? At this point, really. You guys rock. You guys rule. Thank you, Frank. Thank you. All right. Yeah, wow is definitely happening today. It's in effect. I think everyone's in a good mood after that. I think everyone's in a good mood after that. I think everyone's in a good mood after that. I think everyone's in a good mood after that. I think everyone's in a good mood after that. Crappy, crappy weather yesterday. Horrible. My God. Rainy, nasty. Now it's beautiful out. Absolutely beautiful. And some feedback from Matthew. Un-f-ing believable, guys. I have your wow sticker on the wall in my office. Today, a chick that works here comes into my office, shuts the door, whips out the fun bags and says, it's Whip-a-Mow Wednesday, right? I have always wanted to do this. Needless to say, it was f-ing awesome. The sticker also works well in parks frequented by chicks. I took the other sticker and stuck it to my shirt while jogging. About three miles out, a girl running towards me lifted her sports bra, showed the boobs and kept running going without missing a beat. You guys are God. Keep up the great job. It's an occasion when we invent cokehead spelling bee. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well, that ain't going to happen. No, no, no. No, no. Not cokehead. We haven't heard from Amy, have we? Or her mother. Her mother, the other day. I would really like to know what happened. Yeah, I think Amy's sister listens to the show. If you could give us an update on Amy, we'd appreciate it. We love Amy. She was playing Stoner Spelling Bee in the middle of Stoner Spelling Bee. She was the champ, as you remember last time. So we played the other day. She was coming back to defend her title and she got pulled before the festivities started to be dragged back to rehab. And she was released from rehab that day, but they found coke in her possession. Yeah. So they dragged her back to rehab. In the middle of the game, it was kind of an awkward little moment for the O&A show. I think we're putting some type of retrospect together. Oh good. About Amy's, in case people don't know the full story. Great. Hey George. Hello. How are you, George? Guys, how are you doing? You were talking about the Whip-N-Mount Wednesday before I get into what I wanted to say. Down at Storia Park, they call it the strip down there. The girls stand on the side of the strip and when people pass by with the loud signs, they whip them out like three, five girls at a time. Nice. Awesome. You guys are great. Listen, I'm pretty depressed and I don't want to bring down your show, but when you talk about how the guys get it in their mind to chop up girls, girls can make you the maddest on the earth. My wife walks up to me and I work 16 hours a day and tells me, oh, I don't want a divorce, but I want you to move out. What? What does that mean? That's what I'm saying. She wants my benefits or something, you know, so she can keep the medical benefits, but she don't want me around and keep paying the rent too while you're at it. So that's a little bizarre, huh? I'm like, you know, what, you got another guy? You could tell me I'm not going to freak, you know, which I'm ready to just bounce all over her. Right. You know, and she's like, no, it's not that. I don't feel loved. You know, you don't take me out. I'm like, I work 16, 18 hours a day. How long have you been married? Five years. Five years and it's already like that? Yeah, two kids. Oh my God. He's killing me. I want to kill myself, but I want to chop her up and put her in. I'm not going to do it. No, no, no. I'm crazy, man. No, that'll only be worse. I need help. I don't know that you're a psychiatrist or anything, but if there's like any women out there that want to console me, I need to bounce. I swear to God. Dude, punch out Maverick. Punch out. You got to bail. What do I do? I should leave? It's over, Johnny. Yeah, it's over. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? If a marriage gets to the point where your wife is telling you to leave the house, there's no counseling or anything that's going to make it better. That marriage counseling is a bunch of bull crap. Take your losses and move on. I bring home family. Take your losses and move on. I bring home flowers when I come once in a while. She lets them die. Well, they do. Oh, no, plants. Plants to put me yard. You know what I mean? All plants. Yeah. Nice house. I pay to everything. I come home. I dump the money. I don't even put any money in the pocket for myself. I dump all my money on the table. Should we call her in the house? No, dude. You'll kill me. I know you will. See, it sounds like you still want to work it out. I want to love her forever. I want to love her forever. Why is she asking you to move out then? She hates me. Well, it's all right. I'm going to move out. All right. All right, George, what did you do? What did you do? There had to be an incident where she now hates you. In the beginning, I mean, I was vulgar. I called it a C-word when I was mad. I stopped doing that. You called it a C-word? Yeah. Yeah, they don't like that. Being in that state does not help in a relationship. Anybody out there listening, don't ever use that word on your wife or somebody you plan on loving for life. We know that. That's it. I think that's what killed the relationship. But, yeah, no, you best cut your life off. You know, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.

I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. Let's go to Wendy on line four. Wendy, what's going on? Hello? Hi, Wendy. What's up? No, this is Lisa. No, it's Wendy. What's Lisa? Lisa. Lisa and Wendy from Valley Stream. Oh, okay. Hi, guys. I just want to tell you that we take a sailing class every Wednesday in Oyster Bay and we sail topless just for you guys. Whoa! Wow. I've heard there's wowing going on on the water too. On the high seas. Yeah, a lot of people are putting wows on their boat and stuff. Well, there's a street that's like that and everyone who passes by can see us. I know where you're talking. So a lot of people have seen your fun bags, huh? Oh, yeah. We were attacking the sky, the water, and the roadways. Yes. Yep. Well, air, sea, and land. We would love to see a picture of that if one of you ladies want to send a picture and that would be great. Send a picture? Well, I don't have any pictures on me in my booth, but I'll definitely take a picture and send it. All right. We love collecting the wow photos. There's a lot of them on the unofficial website and we need more. Okay. All right. You're welcome. Thanks, Liz. Wait, hold on. Oh, no. The hold on. Oh, not the hold on. The hold on. Keep a lookout. We're going to be flashing. This is Jen speaking now. No, it's Wendy. It's Wendy. Oh, it's Wendy. Okay, sorry. Yeah. Usually she'll flash and then I'll flash, but then she'll just flash and I'll just moon. All right. When are you guys going to be flashing? We're going to be flashing any time between four and seven. That's torture! That's torture! That's when we sail. Four to seven in Oyster Bay. All right. So we'll look at it. Sail close to land and if anyone sees you guys, please give the show a call later. Thank you, Wendy. Thank you so much. All right. There they are, the girls that sail topless, Anthony. Nice. Pruch. Pruch? Yeah, I'm here. What's up? Hey, what's up, man? We're just over here, barbecuing over in Creskill, New Jersey. You got to see it. It's crazy. We got like 30, 330 packs of Budweiser. Oh, it's nuts. About 20 people here. Girls going crazy. Wowing. Cool. You got to see, I got wowed twice on 17th South by the way over here before I hit Route 4. Sounds like a wild party going on behind you. Oh, man, it's crazy. You don't understand. Yeah, it's real crazy. First I got wowed by these three girls. But then I got wowed by this jimmy. What an idiot. Yeah. It's over, Jan. Yeah, you're gone. We finally got that sound effect for the show. I'm so psyched. I don't know if you guys are going to be able to hear it. I'm going to be like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be like, Remember that one? I just got a disk in one of my computer gaming magazines full of classic games and some of them are hysterical. You look at this and it was only back like 1992, 1993. Two? Two. Where's done? And some of these games are hysterical like Duke Nukem 2. It was like a scrolling game like Super Mario Brothers and then they show the new one? Oh, we've come a long way. But hey, you think it'll be fun to play them too? You're like, Oh, I remember this. I remembered Age of Darkness 1. Let me boot that up. Mario Brothers is still fun. Going from left to right. Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink. And then you boot them up and play them. Yeah. And you play. Yeah, you really need a Pentium 3 600 to play Super Pong on. But you start playing these games. It's like, Oh, hey, you know, this sucks. No wonder. No wonder we had such progress in the past 10 years because they get boring real quick. Then I go right back to Half-Life Opie where I can kill in peace. Anthony, we got a guy on the line. We'll talk to him next, Matt. He's upon his prom night and he needs our advice. Very good. You've come to the right place, man. Prom night advice up next for Matt. Make sure Matt stays on the line, OK? Also it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. We all know that by now. Lots of action on the highways today. I mean, people are calling in like crazy. More than past weeks. That's cool. The WoW thing is exploding all over the Tri-State area. Yeah. If you want to get a WoW sticker, Masbeth Queens was really, really good to us a couple weeks ago. We're going back there. Oh yeah? Taking it back to Masbeth. Yeah, because they've been nice and kind to the ONA show. So Gorilla Boy is going to be at Mid Island Electrical, 5415 48th Street, Masbeth Queens. I hope that makes sense to somebody out there, OK? He'll be there at 4 o'clock giving out the WoW stickers. Mid Island Electrical, 5415 48th Street, Masbeth Queens, OK? Right. All right.

We're talking about the Razor Rollerboard Scooter. Yeah, these things are a pisser, man. We are having fun with these. It's our transportation inside the building. Yeah. You know how a lot of people, you know, you walk around your office? There's no need to walk. We ride. We ride. We're riding on the Razor Rollerboard Scooters. These things are great. Gleaming stainless steel, aluminum inline scooter. The wheels on them are like inline skate wheels. Yeah, they're like rollerblade wheels. And it looks cool. It's like very polished stainless steel and aluminum. And the thing tools around, man. We go down the hallway. We're like hitting each other with a... It has a little brake on the back wheel so you can slow down if you feel like. Does it? Yeah, a little bit. I have never used the brake. You haven't discovered that feature yet. You know what I use for a break? See the closet down at the end of the hall? I slam into it head first. It's hysterical. It's the hottest new product this summer. There's articles about these things in all the hot magazines by the way, Anthony. And they're made for the street, really. I mean, we've been using them up and down the hallways, but... You're seeing a bunch of people using these damn things all over Manhattan. John, on instant feedback, no, we're not selling little rascals. This is not a little rascal. No, it's like... It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter. Yeah. It's almost like a thin skateboard with handles. With the little steering handlebar thing. But it's adjustable height and everything. It packs up to really compact size. And it's fun, man. We're having a blast around the office with this thing. A lot of fun. The Sharper Image. Yeah, available only from the Sharper Image.

We're going to be giving out wow stickers at Mid Island Electrical, 5th and 4th, 15, 48th Street, Madsbeth Queen starting at 4 o'clock, with Jeff Norris, the Gorilla Boy. Tom from Teaneck, New Jersey was in Manhattan today, had the sticker on the car, limo pulls up and a gorgeous blonde pops up out of the sunroof and wowed me. F'ing incredible. Thank you, thank you, thank you, guys. We're talking about old computer games, Anthony? Yeah. Mad Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey makes a very, very good point. He says, guys, you want to know what computer is in perspective? Watch War Games. Oh, yeah, it was on last night. When did that movie come out? 81, 82-ish around there, right? Yeah, early 80s. Okay, watch War Games and then The Matrix. How far we've come. Yeah, he was using the old acoustic modem. We had to plug the phone receiver and slam it into some styrofoam cups. Oh, remember that? Yeah. I unfortunately am old enough to remember that. You dialed up your phone and you had to plug it in. You dialed up your phone, took the receiver and shoved it into this big thing, like a cradle for your phone, after you heard the modem on the other end. Yeah. Connecting it a whopping, what, 2,400 baud. Oh, tops. You were flying if you had the 2,400. You were cranking text on the screen almost as fast as you could read it. All right, Anthony, let's go to Matt. Matt's going to his prom tonight. Hey, what's up, guys? Hey, prom night, huh? All right, give us the details. What high school? Cardova High School, Queens. All right, you got yourself a date, obviously. Yeah, I'm going with my girlfriend. We'll call her Wendy. Okay, and your girlfriend of how long? Not too long, about a month. About a month, huh? Have you gotten any action yet? Minimal. Have you gotten patch? Oh, yeah. What do you mean? I got some patch last week. You got to pet the poodle. I pet the poodle. Let's just say, did, um... Mm-hmm. Were you able to count all five fingers of your hand while you did it? I was not. Oh, okay. Very good, very good. But no sex? No, no. I don't think I'll be doing that tonight either way. What? The canoe driver on the head. No. You haven't touched his bald head? No. You didn't? No. Wait, this isn't making sense. Well, maybe he doesn't really know what's going on down there. Do you know where the canoe driver drives the canoe? The guy doesn't know what you're talking about. See? I thought so. It's the most sensitive... Oh, yeah. We're putting a visual on your head. There's a canoe, if you know what I mean, and a canoe driver. And he's always at the back of the boat. Have you touched him on the head? I believe I did. You rubbed that head for good luck, right? Has she reciprocated by putting her hand in places? That's the problem. Uh-oh. She hasn't put her hand down your pants? No. Have you grabbed it and tried to shove it down your pants, like Bill Cosby did? Did I check that went up to his apartment? Allegedly. Come here, baby, and grab my button, papa. Maybe I should have said, what are we going to do about this? Well, I don't know. That was the advice I was going to give all the kids going to their prom tonight. If she's shy enough not to touch it, I think you may frighten her if you just pull it out. Now, how far has she gone with you? Uh... Yellow? Hasn't really done anything. But you put your hand down her pants. Yeah. I didn't get the reciprocation. Any dry humping, as they call it? Oh, naturally. Where you get on a couch somewhere and you start rubbing against each other through the pants? Naturally. Boy, that leaves you hurting. You get the, what they call, blue balls hoping. It hurts very much, and then you get chafing. I've never heard of that one before. I'm explaining to everybody. So I can tell everyone what I learned on the show today. I'm explaining to everybody using you as the person I'm talking to. Oh, I see. I learned that in radio school, too. Put a picture of the person you want to talk to and communicate with. Put a picture in the studio. If it's a family, put a picture of a family that you cut out of a magazine in front of you doing the radio. And that's your audience. It gives you someone to talk to. Shut up! That's great. I like putting pictures of porn stars up. So that way you can talk to them. So, you've done that. Was she into it when you had your hand down there? Oh, definitely. She was into it? Definitely. This is a tough nut to crack. I understand this because she's kind of really shy. Obviously a virgin? Yeah. Maybe more liquor. Roofies. No, no, no. Does she drink? We'll find out later today. I don't think so. Wow, that's even tougher. Yeah. I would predict it. Has she promised anything for the prom or? Actually, she has. What? What? I should be getting hungry. Come on! She won't touch it, but she'll do that? Apparently so. How did she tell you that she was going to do that? She's a listener to the show. Hopefully she's not listening now. I said something to her that... How about you induct me to the Tuesday Night Hammer Club? She said, but I won't see you on Tuesday. I'll see you on Wednesday. That sort of sounds cryptic though. It doesn't mean she's going to do it. She just said, I'll see you on Wednesday. Well, let's keep our fingers crossed and see what happens tonight. Alright. I'm going to bet you're going to get some action tonight. Have you been obviously excited in front of her? Oh yeah, naturally. What does she do? Look at her and go, huh? No, she just... Have you rolled over and shoved it against her leg or something? Maybe I should. You haven't done the spaz move yet, have you? No. Alright. Oh my God, that's a tough one. Yeah, I'm going to predict him here, guys. Where are you guys going after the prom? To a club. To a club? Do you have hotel rooms or anything like that? No, then we're going to the beach. Oh, the old beach. Pulling sand out of your ass. I did the beach thing. It didn't work too well for me. That's the prom. Like 20, 30 years going to the beach? Yeah, pretty much. Probably half of school. Right. You might want to bring a blanket or something. Doing that, definitely. Wow. I don't know, man. This is the hardest advice I've ever had. I figured you guys would be able to help me if anyone would be able to. We have someone in the studio that might be able to help you. Hold on a second. Hello, Matt. Hi, it's I am Mike Grayson. Hey, I'm Mike. I've been with a couple of women that sound similar to your lovely girlfriend. What you've got to do is treat them with patience and tenderness and loving care and care and love. That's the thing about being a woman. I'm not saying that I'm a woman. I'm saying that I'm a woman. I'm saying that I'm a woman. I'm saying that I'm a woman. I'm saying that I'm a woman. And loving care and a right hook. Because once they're in drastic pain, bleeding, and semi-conscious, they become more receptive to the Louisiana black snake of I Am Mike. Should I punch you in the uterus, Iron Mike? Well, no. You're getting carried away, Matt. First, a couple of light body blows to the purposes. Use them like a speed back. Watch, I'll demonstrate on my new host back. I'm here in the hotel with. Here, like this. Shut up! And then some light body blows. Working your way down, lovingly. You know, you start with the face. And then the body. And work your way down to the uterus and wind up. I mean, pull this punch from Mississippi. And then, swim right into the uterus. And then she won't care about something as small as a white man's penis. Good luck, man. Big sign, Mike. Hey, man, a lot of people checking in saying you gotta use the J. Moore line. If she's a friend of the show, maybe you could do it, but keep your pants on. Oh, for the record, I'm a two-for-two with what we can do about this. You are? Then go three-for-three. What the hell? Who are the lucky guys? That old gag. Yeah, try the, what are we gonna do about this line? I don't think that's gonna work with her. Why? Yeah, she hasn't been listening that long. Oh, really? She's not familiar with the J. Moore episode. Would you like us to give her a call to see if you're gonna get any action today? Hey, we'll help you out. That's quite all right. Damn, why don't people allow us to call the girls anymore? It's about that scuba guy. Hey, when you go to pin her corsage on? Hey, does she have a father? A what? A father. A father. Yeah. You gotta go pick her up with the mother and father there? No, we're meeting somewhere. You are? Yeah, I've met the parents. They're cool people. You're so lucky. Why don't you go to the house like they do in the movies? I hate that. You gotta go to the house and there's the father ushering his little girl out the door, knowing she's probably gonna come back limping. It's like the gazelle giving their young to the lion. Oh, man. You know what the best thing to do is you go up to the father before you leave and ask him if he has any condoms. You got any condoms? I don't know what this bitch has. That's a good icebreaker with the pop. What? It works well. That works, right? You're sitting there watching TV, you know, bonding, watching a little hockey, maybe the Stanley Cup or something, and then you break out that line, right? And then you break that line out. Maybe I should ask what the daughter likes to drink. Oh, that's a good one. Exactly. All right, Louis is a limo driver. He's seen a bunch of proms. He's got some... Oh, that's a good one. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice.

I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice.

I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. I'm gonna go get some ice. Oh, yeah, don't worry, Pop. I'll take care of a whack bag, whack bag. Hey, Pop, does she like the yam bag on the chin or on her ass? Huh? You brought her up. Anthony, I think we got audio of Matt after doing it with his prom date. Oh, yeah? Yeah, let me go to that right now. Look what I did to you again. How did Jamaican Mike get into that limo? I don't know. Butt sex. Oh, really? Yeah, some butt sex. Do you think there are people out there that have butt sex on the prom? Butt wall. That's really making the jump. You know, butt sex at the prom. When you're at that age for proms and stuff, you're just hoping to get like patch or something. Can you imagine? Is there anyone out there that gets like butt sex for the prom? It starts with a gentle kiss on the cheek and a pinning of the corsage at the parents' house and ends with butt sex? How do you make that jump? Butt sex. I don't know, man. That's quite the jump. Hey, Dan, what's up? What's going on? Hey. I want to know if Anthony's going to be using these lines when he goes to the prom this year, let's do it. Hey, that's pretty funny. Shut up. Where did that come from? I'm sorry, Anthony. I usually control the calls a little better than that. Oh, prom. Pete, what's up? Imagine how ridiculous I look at a prom. Where's my scotch or something? Give me a drink. You know, that's another bit that like, you know, just those ridiculous DJs do though. Yeah. They go to like the prom with one of their listeners or something. We'll take you to the prom. One of our lucky listeners is going to be going to the prom with me. Yeah, that's just... And it's like, you know. Just another example of really bad zoo morning zoo type radio. Hey, we'll take you to the prom. Let's go to Pete. Pete, you're next on WNEW. Hey, Pete. Yeah, what's up? Let's go. Yeah, I want to tell Matt not to get his hopes up, man, because my prom, I had everything set up. The girl told me I was going to get lucky, and that's where we turned the coin to term FOC. We got the limo driver and everything, and I struck out. $800 later, I ended up with a blue ball. I think most people strike out on the prom, on the prom night. It's like New Year's Eve. Oh, yeah, you know? Because all the girls are out, the girls that do it and the girls that don't do it. That's right. You've got to go into a bar and spend all that money on liquor and get lucky with some other girl. And I've got to say, half the girls that go to the proms, they have those F me dresses on and stuff. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. The dresses have come a long way. To them, in the pants, it's like this. It might as well be. It might as well be. All right, Pete. All right, man. We have a guy that's claiming he got anal at the prom. There's no way you're getting butt sex at the prom. Alex. Hey. Remember, we don't like liars on this show. Right. I swear, but you have to do the trick. You can't be trying to score with your date. What? There's no way. Everyone strikes out in the prom. I totally agree with you when you go at your date. But if you start to fool around with your friend's date, that's when you get laid. Wait a minute. You got anal from your friend's date? We all were friends. It's like a big group, my whole crew of friends. My friend was just going with her as friends. We were drunk. We got a little friendly and then we started to take our clothes off in the bathroom and she gave me anal in the shower. Butt sex. At least it was in the shower. She was a whore. She was a good girl. There's nothing wrong with that. You're getting anal on your prom night. Well, thank you, Alex. There it is. That's a technicality. Poo-sah! It wasn't his. It wasn't his date. It's sticking in my mouth. What are you talking about there? I don't know what you're talking about there. I can't see making the move in the traditional prom date where you go pick up the date from the house. The mother and father are waving with smiles on their faces, a little tear in their eyes. The little girl goes off and in the middle of the night, she's like, I'm going to go to the bathroom. a little tear in their eyes. The little girl goes off into the car and drives away on her prom night looking all nice. A few short hours later, we fast forward, back seat. Butt sex. I don't see it. This poor guy. This is what I'm dreading someday. Thank God my wife's not born yet. Many years to go. Jay, what's up? Hey, guys. How are you doing? Guys, you're killing me. I got a 15-year-old daughter. She's going to the prom for the first time Friday night. Poo-sah! Oh, no. Are you just freaking? I'll tell you what. Friday night, this kid comes to the door, I'm inviting them in, I'm sitting them down in the living room, I'm going to be cleaning my gun. That won't matter. He'll be cleaning his with your daughter later. Poo-sah! Oh, Anthony, you speak from experience. It doesn't matter. I remember going out with this girl and her father took me aside. He was driving me home one day. He goes, yeah, let me drive you home. The girl that I was going out with said... He drove the little short bus, right? Yeah, that's it. She goes, my father wants to have a talk with you. I'm like, oh boy, the talk. God, I hate chicks with fathers. Now, wait, wait. Is this the father that used to drop the girl off to your place so you could bang her? Yeah. Same girl? Yeah, she was getting dropped. It's a hilarious story though. You were what, 14, 15? No, this was when I was about 16, 17. But the father would drop... I've got to hang up with him. This is going to distract our story. I'm going to stop talking. Good luck with your daughter at the prom there, Jay, or whatever your name was. Okay, listen. Yeah, so he would drop his daughter off at your house almost every afternoon, right? No, no, it was the weekends. Oh, okay. Back at that age, you weren't doing it every day because there just wasn't a place to do it. But my mom was working nights on the weekends, so we used to have parties over the house. So everyone would come over, play poker, and have their respective girlfriends and have sex with them. So he would drop her off. We'd go inside, and it was just like there was no time, so we would just run right to the bedroom and do what we did. And then he would come pick her up, beep, beep. All right. Pick her up. He's the pimp. Exactly. He was the pimp man. I'm doing the same thing that the guys do that drive the chicks around to bachelor parties. But before any of this happened, she goes, oh, he wants to have a talk with you. I'm like, okay. So I hop in his work van. He's driving me home, and he's like this real mean-looking guy. And I'm just like a dopey kid and stuff. And he's telling me, you know, you're a little older than my daughter. Because I think I was 17, and she was 15. Yeah. And I'm like, yeah, no, I know. And he's telling me about, you know, respecting her, blah, blah, blah. You know, don't do anything to her, because you'll have to answer to me. And all I'm thinking is, way big, way big. That's all that was in my head as I'm looking at him, and he's talking about this, because I know what he's talking about. He's talking about sex. He's talking about teen sex, Opie. Teen sex. Teen sex. And all I was thinking, and then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I hope he can't read my mind. And I'm trying to block out of my head what I'm thinking, because I'm thinking of his nude daughter getting banged. And I'm like, oh, if he can read my mind, I'm dead. I'm sunk. I'm trying to, like, think of a brick wall. Yeah. So I can't break through it. Oh, man. But yeah, he used to drop her off. No, Sean C. from Jersey. I think you were 33, and she was 12. No. No. That isn't the case. Thank you very much. All right, Anthony. Wow. I see it on your face. You're thinking of butt sex, aren't you? With my daughter. I could read your mind. Lots of great calls on hold. If you're on hold, please stay there. We need all of you guys today, OK? Also some girl that wants to meet Psycho Marks on line 10. A bunch of other people that had anal during their prom. If you're lying, we don't want to hear from you. No, it's no way. If you're lying, please hang up. You can't make that jump. Take one for the team and hang up if you're lying, because we hate liars on this show. That's going from sixth grade to college. There's no way it happened. You're making a huge jump. Maybe now that they've loosened the rules and gay people can take their dates to the prom. That's the only way you can get butt sex. Yeah, we forgot to talk to the other guy. We never confirmed that it was a female. I had anal. Yeah, me and Bill. All right, Anthony. Anthony Gorilla Boy is on the line. He's at the Wow sticker stop. Is he beating people up? Gorilla Boy, where are you? I'm over here now. I'm over here now. Jeff Norris. What's going on? We're at Mid Island Electrical on 54th, Fleet Street, Massacuga, Queens, Masbeth, Queens, right behind Kenny Wilde's number five NASCAR. Go inside, find a plug and stick your junk inside. Yeah, yeah. We're doing bench presses with the car. I'm not in line with Tony Bloomfield anymore. He's a nut. All right. Mike, we're handing out some stickers. Come on down. We'll be here for quite a while.

God, if we ever get syndicated, we're going to actually have to make believe NASCAR is cool. Yeah. There's a couple cowboy hats out here. I just don't get NASCAR. I'm sorry. Yeah, I tell you, it's a good comparison. This car goes like what? 190 miles an hour. There's not a scratch on it. Yeah. Span goes five miles an hour. This thing looks like Fondlelli drove it at Demolition Barbie on Happy Days. Oh, he only watches NASCAR when he jerks it. Well, I did. Yeah, there was that story. Oh, really? Yeah, we've told a few times. Yeah. New meaning to the word pit stop. All right. Thank you, Gorilla Boy. We'll see you later. Peace. Get your wow stickers in Masbeth, Queens today, Mid Island Electrical, 54, 48th Street. Jeff Norris puts on a fine show at these wow sticker stops, okay? All right, Anthony. Well, I guess we've got to take a break here. A lot of great calls on hold. We'll get to them next. Stay there. Get ready for... Ooh! It's the Winslow's Blows Day with the wheel of Anthony. N-E-W. Powered by... Two shot junk jerks. Owned by Infinity Broadcasting. This is 1027 WNEW. To infinity, New York. What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day. It's Whippenbough Wednesday with Opie and Anthony. You put wow on your car, you got a good chance of seeing boobs. Simple as that. Hearing from tons of people today, Anthony. The weather's very, very nice out there for wowing. Steve, what's going on? Hey, how you guys doing today? We're doing great. Okay, listen, just to let you know, I just got lined out on the Long Island Expressway out here in Suffolk County, so the word's reaching out here now. It's about time. Okay. Another great thing that's happening too, out on Veterans Highway in Ron Takama, two young guys hanging out. They got this huge wow sign that they made out of like a refrigerator box. Okay, these guys are like in the middle of Vets Highway holding this thing up, and they're getting wowed. I stopped, I pulled over, I gave them a couple of bumper stickers, a couple of the wow stickers, because I had a whole bunch of them in the car. I gave them a couple of real wow stickers. These guys are happy. I think the name was Jack and Dave or Jack and Dan. All right. But they're really cool out there. They're getting wowed. Well, thank you, Steve. All right. Thank you. I got a great show and a good occasion. Ouch. All right. Bye. Later. E.J. E.J. Yeah? Hello. So you're claiming you had butt sex on your prom. And the only reason why I got it was because she was a virgin and didn't want to give that up to me. What? Butt sex? Stop. I kid you not. Oh, please. What's the logic behind that? I don't want you driving my Rambler. Take the Ferrari. Come on. Everybody else tells me. I swear to God, man. I was with her about three months before. It wasn't the first time I got it from her, but that's the only reason why I got it on my prom. Lovely. Was she wearing a prom dress with the hatch in the back like the beady pajamas? No, not at all. Easy access. You know, I'm going to believe E.J. It sounds reasonable. It sounds too crazy not to believe. How long ago was this, sir? Ten, twelve years, I think. Have you seen her since? Actually, no. The last time I saw her was about maybe eight years ago. Wow. All right. All right. Thank you, E.J. You guys rock. All right. E.J. got butt sex on prom night. On prom night. Brian. Hey. What's up? Talking to you. How you doing, precious? Listen, I swear to God, I swear to God this happened. It was about eight years ago. I went down to prom. I took this girl as a favor because her boyfriend just broke up on Thursday. She was 15. I was 17. This is a true story. We're in a lavalette down the shore by seaside. I went to go mess around and she pretty much showed me the way in the other direction and that's what happened. That's a true story. I thought it was impossible to get butt sex on prom night. It just sounds like quite the jump. I thought so. I've been bragging about it for eight years. How do you make that move? You just kind of... It took a while. All right, Brian. Thank you. All right, guys. See you later. Bye. Honey, sit down and tell us how your prom was. Problem with that, huh, Pop? I can't quite sit. Bill is claiming that he confused the areas and that's why he got... Confused the areas. Bill, you confused the areas on prom night. Bill, turn down your radio. God damn it, man. Turn it down. Listen, this idiot. Turn it down. Honey, sit down and tell us. Listen to him. He's listening to it at the radio. Bill. Bill. Bill. I know. He's going to say hello any second because he's listening to himself on the radio. Hello. Hey, Bill, you jerk off. God, you guys, come on. Everyone should know we're on like a 40 to 48 second delay now. Turn down your radio if you're on hold waiting to talk to us. Isn't that something everyone knows no matter what station you listen to or anything like At this point in time, everyone should know to turn their radio down. All right, let's go to Anna. Anna, what's going on today? Hey, how you guys doing? Good. I've been listening for years and I have a big crush on Psycho Mark. I want to come up and meet him. No one has a crush on Psycho Mark, Anna. You got a death wish? I do. Do you want to end up in a 55 gallon drum? What do you look like? What do I look like? Yeah. I have 5'11", blonde hair and blue eyes. 5'11", blonde hair, blue eyes. I don't know. Do you have a nice body? Yeah, I think I have a nice butt and nice leg. Nice little boobies. And you want to meet, of all people, Psycho Mark. Psycho Mark has a fan? This is the first, man. Psycho Mark has a fan. What do you say? Can I come up and meet him or what? Are you in the area? Actually, I am. I had to do some photo shoots this week. Do you know why you're a model or something? Yes, I am. Do you know what Psycho Mark can do to a girl? Huh? Do that in your best Ted Knight voice, Anthony. Yeah. Do you know what Psycho Mark can do to a girl? I might end up in a 55 gallon drum. Is that clear? No, I know what Psycho Mark can do to me. Whoa! Out of here. You know Psycho Mark only likes guys, right? Wow. Shut up, man. All right, so now you're 5'11", blonde hair, blue eyes, 5'11", blonde. How much do you weigh? How much do I weigh? About 140, 150. Well, she's tall. She's tall, though. Big boobs? No, not quite, but three. Shapely? Enough? Everybody says they're nice. Enough to satisfy? Yeah, most definitely. They're really sensitive. And you're into Psycho Mark? Yeah, I've had him for quite a while now. Psycho Mark, right? We're talking about the same guy. Yeah, he sounds so sexy on the radio. Sexy? He sounds like a psychopath. No, it's nothing, but come on down here. I'll take y'all for a chat. And like, can I come up and meet him? Oh, you're like, you sure? How close are you? I'm like right outside, actually. Oh, Jesus. Get out of here. About two blocks away. His name's not Patty, is it? All right, listen. I can't, I don't know. Psycho Mark is a little bit... Please, please. For your own safety, we could maybe do like a prison visit or something. I just don't trust Psycho Mark. Do a little F&M stuff, huh? Oh, man, he's a psycho. Mark, you want to meet this chick? Yeah, I don't care, whatever. She can come up. Would you go into the J-More Suite with Psycho Mark? Would I? Yeah. I'd go anywhere with him. Holy crap. What the hell's going on? Jesus Christ, man. We're getting all the hangar-ons laid around here. Dude. What do you say? I'm curious just to see what she looks like. I mean, why not? Can we like tie you down or something, Psycho Mark? Because I don't trust you. We've got to put him in the silence of the lambs thing on the hand trap. Remember that... Remember that... It puts the lotion on the skin or it gets the O's again. Remember that listener that wanted to meet us and we just didn't trust the situation so we like duct taped them to a chair? Yeah. If Psycho Mark will agree to that, we'll allow you to come up to meet him. And then if you're deemed cool, then you guys could go like into the J-More Suite or something. Okay, and if not, then you just got to tie me up. Oh my God. Look at Mark. Wow. All right. Good thing I didn't get sick today. Hold that in line. Rick's going to talk to you. All right. We've got to just make sure Psycho Mark is like duct taped to a chair before you come up. He's not good for me. Oh my God. Oh, F-U tools. All right. All right. All right. Hold on the line. Rick's going to talk to you. All right. All right. All right. All right. It's like the frigging dating game in here. Two days ago, it was our own Lorenzo and today it's Psycho Mark. We'll get a chair and get them duct taped. Let's do this. Duct taped. Wow. All right. Should be good. Show gets wackier. Okay. Terrific. Okay. Terrific. All right. All right. All right. We got the chair. I smell a stalker Patty. Someone is saying, uh, some of the stuff that you're going to be talking about. I'm going to be talking about the stalker Patty. All right. All right. We got the chair. I smell a stalker Patty. Someone is saying, uh, Psycho Mark. Uh, pattern down. We can't lose the original psycho. Put her in the Lorenzo suite with Psycho Mark. The Lorenzo suite. Vinny from Rosedale. What mental hospital did you come from? Kevin from Brooklyn. Clear the building of all 55 gallon drums. Uh, a crush on Psycho Mark. That must be stalker Patty's cousin. Be afraid of this chick. Very afraid. Bring her in. All right. Well, they're duct taping him. All right. I think we, I don't make a lap dance a lot easier. Well, yeah, the guy likes that. The guy likes to grab ass is what it is. I've seen him in privilege too. He got his hands like elbow deep in some of those, uh, dance. Psycho Mark, this is only fair because you are, you, you grab every single girl. No, you're not as bad as old dirty, but you're bad. He was chasing around the intern yesterday that just started here. I heard you got to talking to about that, huh? Yes. The only way to treat him. At least if she wants to, you know, put her ass by your hand so you can wiggle a finger. Uh, it's up to her, not you. Wow. They're duct taping them. Good. Get a, get a picture of this for the unofficial website. Yeah. I'll take one more prom story and we'll move on. We'll get this girl into, to meet Psycho Mark. Uh, John, what's going on? Hey, ONA, this is John from New Jersey. I just got a quick, uh, little story for you. Yeah. I, I took this girl to the prom. I had another girlfriend at the time. I just kind of took this girl to do the right thing and, uh, we went to the prom together. After the prom, we went to my friend's house and she disappeared for a little while. And, uh, at the end of the night I went back to my limo to get a ride home and she was banging my limo driver. Wow. I wonder how many limo drivers get action on prom night. Yeah. Limo drivers? Really? I mean, it was a big joke because she wasn't, you know, I just took her as a, you know, a friend type of thing. But, uh, it was pretty funny to come out in a limo and see her tagging the limo guy. Oh my God. Yeah. True story. Why didn't you get any? Well, I had a girlfriend at the time and actually the girl I was dating, her brother was in my class. In my graduation class, it was her younger brother, so it would have been awkward if, like, you know, she was there and her brother was there at the prom. So she decided not to go, so I took a girl that was also graduating and we went as friends. Right. And then, uh, you know, one thing led to another. I guess, I guess she liked the limo guy and that was it. Very good. So I just wanted to share that with you. Thank you, John. I'm a little distracted because I'm watching them, uh, duct tape Psycho Mark. Well, Freud from Jersey, isn't duct tape going to hinder Psycho Mark's ability to air hump? Remember yesterday? Yeah. Air humping? He was air humping. That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen. Psycho Mark does the, uh, the Beavis dance. You ever see the way Beavis dances? Yeah. He, like, does that slap, that slap-ass thing and then the air humping? That's what Psycho Mark does around the building. Let me see if you can air hump. Can you air hump? Oh, God. Air hump. All right, Ant, let's take a break and, uh, we got, uh, a psycho listener that wants to meet Psycho Mark. His shirt says, ride this thing. Thank God on her terms. And, and yet... On the molester, uh... Boy, I'm glad Psycho Mark's got one of his tame T-shirts on today, Anthony. What does that one say? Ride this. Ride this. Jesus. What? I can't breathe. Not for nothing. Not for nothing, but get this freaking monkey off of me. Hey, hey, Rick, don't make it so he can't breathe. No, he can breathe. If he's saying he can't breathe, he can't breathe. I'm trying to pull. Make sure it's not tight, man. All right. What is it? Be kind to Retards Week on the ONA show? All right, so Psycho Mark, what's your name? I'm Anthony. Anthony, Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. All right, so Psycho Mark, we'll meet a listener next. He's just about ready. Why are you going to blindfold him? Whatever. All right, so people are saying, uh, saying it's that chick from Channel 4 News. That would be hilarious. Psycho Mark, don't jump around. You'll fall on your head. You should tape a pillow to the back of his head. Can we just tape his back? Psycho Gimp. Look at him. He's bouncing around. You're going to fall over, man. You're not going to be able to put your arm out there and help yourself. All right, let's take a break and Psycho Mark, we'll meet one of our listeners next. Stay there. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. What is that? Like some kind of guy's name? Like some kind of sexist guy's name? Yeah! You will not get away with this! I wish you could just shut your big mouth. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Whip-A-Mod Wednesday. Oby and Anthony, N-E-W. Anthony, brand new sponsor to the O&A show? Yes. We're talking about Mujan. Mujan. You might ask yourself, what the hell is Mujan? Well, if you're a lady, what the hell is Mujan? Well, if you're a lady and you want to get rid of some of the unwanted hair on your body. Mujan. Mujan. Mujan. Waxing is the difference between having itchy, scratchy stubble and silkier, sexier skin. The world's most desirable woman, women wax with the convenient one-step botanical formula of Mujan. Mujan. Mujan. So, if you have a pool rack filled with afro in your lap. Right. You might want to trim that down to a more reasonable size or something. The best way to do it with Mujan wax can be used to hot or cold. It's the most comfortable way to remove hair, whether it's on legs, face, underarms. Ladies will love Mujan. No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate your skin. Gentle hypoallergenic Mujan removes hair completely open. Slow to grow back too. It doesn't grow right back. Hair is lighter and thinner than with shaving. You don't want to go down there. Remember when you were a kid? Remember when you were a kid and you were getting to that age where you were getting a little old to be kissing your dad goodnight? Ugh. Dude, I'm talking like when you're like six or seven. I'm there. It's like goodnight, you kiss your mommy, you kiss your daddy, you go to bed. I still give my dad a peck. All right. I said a peck. All right. It's in the middle of a library. I'm a cheek, dude. Insert your own joke here for precious. Like you don't want to be with your girl and feel that same razor stubble that you felt when you were a kid. Right. Mujan, it grows back a lot thinner and a lot lighter. Better than shaving. So basically if you're a hairy beast and you want to get rid of some of the hair on your body, pick up Mujan.

As Whip-Em-Out Wednesday continues, Anthony. Getting bigger and bigger as the weeks move on here. Yes. All right. Let's get this lit. Well, where's Rick? Psycho Mark. There was a chick called up. He's a big fan of Psycho Mark. Does that mic work? Yeah. Why are you all the way in the corner? You don't want to bring him over? Because of Psycho Mark's behavior with the interns, dancers of privilege, and whatnot, we've had to tape him to a- Easy. Don't say that. They're going to dump out, I think. So he doesn't get his hands all over these poor girls that come in here. So- Well, thank you for that. Well, we have this lady call up about 20 minutes ago, Anthony. She said she wants to meet Psycho Mark, which is a laugh riot, because this is the first time that has ever happened on this radio show. She's what, 5- 5'11", 140 pounds, blonde hair, small breasts, nice body. She's in town for a photo shoot, and I asked if she was a model. She said yes. Rick says that she's got gorgeous long legs. Model type, young? I think late 20s. Late 20s? All right, so the only way we would agree that one of our listeners would meet Psycho Mark is if he was tied to a chair, and you guys did a great job. He's duct taped to the chair at this moment. Duct taped. Great job, all right. What? Yeah, let's blindfold him, and then we'll bring the girl in. Dick. We just had her on the phone about 15, 20 minutes ago. All right, they're putting the blindfold on, Anthony. Psycho Mark, it's a meet one. Oh my God, it looks like an execution. Looks like they're going to execute him. Yeah, get a picture of that. Get a picture of that. Boss, boss, I would like some of them taters and some calm bread. We're taking pictures for the unofficial ONA website. I found you. You hit his face on the mic. You all right? You idiot. Make sure you put the sponge and wet it and put it on top of his hand. Don't put a dry sponge there. Okay. Don't go too close. All right, the mic is right in front of you, Psycho Mark. Marco comes out. Be careful, boss. No, they said they've seen the girl. All right, let's bring the girl in. Let's see, we will speak with her. What's her name? Anna. Anna. Anna, hello. How are you? How are you doing? Wow, you're tall. Very nice. And you want to meet that clown who's like duct taped to the chair to your right. I think we have the sexiest laugh I've ever heard. Really? Lift up the mic a little bit. It's a psychopathic laugh is what it is. Really psycho. Let me see the ass. I have a crush on him. Go ahead. All right. Wow, wait a minute. Wow. Wow. All right. He wanted to see the ass. Wow. Wow. You can say that for Psycho Mark. Yeah. Look at Psycho Mark. This isn't right. Why? Look at you. You look better than... It's better than you molesting these girls. I would never do that. Well, why don't you go over to Psycho Mark there. Come over there. Yeah. There she is. Look at him. He's like, he's all blindfolded. Oh, great. Watch some junk land on my shoulder. Why don't you take the blindfold off, Mark, and meet one of your fans. She's taking the blindfold off. Hi, how are you? How are you? What's wrong? I'm sitting in a chair. I'm a big fan of yours right there. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. I've got the hats for you. Can I have my hat back, please? I've been listening for years and I do have a crush on you. Really? Yes, and I think you have a really sexy laugh. Psycho Mark, what do you think of Anna? Very, very nice. Thank you. You want to see my butt? Yeah, see some butt. Oh my God. Showing Psycho Mark the ass. All right. All right, all right, all right. You like that? Yeah, yeah. Sit down, Danny. Sit down, Danny. Yeah, I've been doing show-offs. Sit down, Danny. Yeah, I've been doing shoots all this week. Shoots? I did a shoot for Trying to Get a Nugget magazine. Oh, really? Yeah, trying to get the front cover of Nugget. Nugget? Yeah. What is Nugget magazine? It's one of those books that you find in the naughty store. Oh, wow. What do you think, Mark? I've got a little forced, forcible lap dance there. So you've been naked before. I hustle, not drink. Okay. You're all whole. You've been naked before, right? Yes, sir. So why don't you show Psycho Mark some stuff here? You want to see some stuff, Psycho Mark? Some stuff? Sure, show me the stuff. A little dance. Sure. Well? Let her rip. Yeah, let her rip. I'm the submissive type, so you tell me what to do and I'll do it. Oh my God. Mark like a dog. Let her rip. This is great. This is great. Dude, tell her to do something. All right, we'll remove that jacket. All right. I'm chilling in here. I think I'm getting E.I. What do you think so far, Psycho Mark? Has she got a tattoo on her shoulder? Hot bod. I'm hot. Very nice. Do you think she has a hot bod? Yeah. Okay. All right. All right, what else? Let's see. I want to see Psycho Mark work his pimp panty. You know, you're not going to get a hot body. You're going to get a hot body. You're going to get a hot body. I've got a hot body. I've got a hot body. I've got a hot body. I've got a hot body. I've got a hot body. You've got a hot body. I want to see Psycho Mark work his pimp panty. He's got a pimp panty. He has a pimp panty. He has a pimp panty. If you're just turning at Psycho Mark, duct-tape to a chair to meet one of his admirers. So far, he thinks she's very hot. Like the butt, like the rest of the body. Mm-hmm. Go ahead, Psycho Mark. Jump up on my chair and grind on my face. Wow. That's a little blunt. Well, it's got to go on. That's a little blunt. Okay. But, one more thing. What would you like me to grind on your face? Let's start with the chest. With the chest. My chest is all sweaty because it was really hot out in the car. So that's just your little warning, since you're tied up there, you can't get away. Wow! She has mountain cycle marks. She's like rubbing her boobies in cycle marks. She's grinding the boobs. Give him a little more of that. He kind of enjoyed that one. Alright. And thank God he's duct taped because he can't grab the ass. She just stuck her naked boobs in Mark's face and Mark's losing it. Very nice. Try the other cheek. The other cheek? Yeah, he did. I can't describe what's going on. Well, she is pulling her shirt down and rubbing bare boob on cycle mark's cheek. She has taken her gum out, cycle mark, and beating one of his admirers. He's duct taped to a chair. What else? She's been in... Okay, what's next? Let's work that nice fine piece of butt. Work the fine piece of butt. Don't rub it on my face. Oh, there we go. Very, very good. She is now sitting on cycle mark's package. This is no other way to say it. I guess jumping up and down. Cycle mark can't do this because they're duct taped to a chair. Cycle mark is getting ass grinded on his junk. I just got to be blunt about it. Oh my God. Thank God he's taped down. Thank God because his hands would be all over it. It looks like another night of privilege. This is like privilege. I swear to God. He's groping. His arms are turning blue because he's trying to grab... Look at him. He's pushing himself in the chair. He's trying to. He's trying to. He's trying to. He's trying to. He's trying to. He's trying to. He's trying to. It's torture because he can't use his hands. Are you pitching a tent? No. No. Tent. Maybe he needs a... Change frame. I am not pitching a tent. In front of all you. I'm not looking. I think he is. Well, why don't you feel to see if he is? No, I'm not pitching a tent. Feel to see if he is. It's at least a pop tent right now. Oh my God. She was just checking him for... Don't take pictures of my junk. She just grabbed this package. Anna, is there anything going on down there? Can we play What's in Your Pants? Anna, is there anything going on down there? I'll tell you right now. There's nothing going on there.

Give me my personal rules here. See my hands? I'm going to stick it up. You've got to walk into it. Wait, how about... Hold on, hold on. She looks like she's willing to do your rules. Are you kidding? Put the blindfold back on. We'll play a new version of What's in My Pants. She will put the blindfold on, you reach your hand out, you reach under. Oh my God. And then what? He's got to be able to... It's just going to be Psycho Mark playing? Yes, with his hand. Then he has to tell us what it is. Are you cool for that? I'm fine with that. I'm totally fine with that. Psycho Mark is blindfolded. We're playing a live version of What's in My Pants. Psycho Mark is going to put his hand out. Anna is going to put her patch, I guess. I guess we could say that. Put your fingers out or something. Put your hand out, Psycho Mark. There's junk there. All right. You ready? I'm not your hand. That's it. Wait a minute. I've got to see this. Come on. All right. His hand is out, Anthony. She's giving Psycho Mark's fingers a little orange. Let's just put it that way. What do you think that looks like? Sure. She's working Psycho Mark's fingers. Oh my God. Why don't we play What's in My Pants? My fingers are all lubed up. He's got lipstick all over his hands. She has just stepped over Psycho Mark's hand. He's got his hand on her thigh, sort of. Take the skirt down. I think he's a little shy now. The skirt is coming down. Wearing a little bodysuit. What? What? What? What's wrong, baby? What is it? What is it? Psycho Mark, a triangle? Wood floor? Mohawk? What? What's wrong? Don't you want to play now, Mark? What's the matter, Mark? What is it? What is it, Mark? Wood floor? I'm not sure. What do you guess?

Damn, is that funny. God, was that funny. Did I not take the joke good? I didn't bring any bathroom doors off. It was so funny, we had him blindfolded and his hand was reaching around the door. It was so funny, I couldn't believe it. It was so funny, I couldn't believe it. It was so funny, I couldn't believe it. He was blindfolded and his hand was reaching around trying to find Anna's whatever name. What's your real name? My name is Anna. Anna. Anna. He's trying to find my Kiki. Are you going to get an operation or? Yeah, you are. You're all gearing up for the operation. Well, first I'm getting my boobs. You're getting boobs where? Big jugs. Right. And then I'm going to go and get the rest of it done. Wow, you're taking hormones or anything? I guess I have been for a year and a half. A year and a half, yeah, because I can't really see any stubble or anything. I didn't have any. You didn't? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Wow. So you were always pretty much like a chick. Yeah, I was pretty nice. Really? Always had a nice ass. Yeah. Well, Psycho Mark said, we have so much nasty tape of you saying how hot she is. I'm playing all over again, you happy man. Now you've got to buy my bondage videos. You have bondage videos? Oh yeah, I've got to buy them. Really? Yeah. Well, you can plug your bondage videos. Get in some ice. Why don't you get to plug your little bondage videos. Let me plug to my face one more time. Mark totally dug it, man. It was fun. Yeah, yeah. The best part was when he was reaching around and all of a sudden found Charlie and he was like, ah, ah, what did you feel, Mark? Nothing. Did you feel a gambag or a sausage? You felt it, you idiot. We have proof. We have proof. What, do you got it tucked back there? You got it all tucked under or something? Perfectly. Perfectly tucked under? Ben's the expert in this department.

I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! I'm going to bag it! Ask Anna to ask Mark, what are we going to do about this? Not for nothing, but Psycho Mark loves mad junk. Not for nothing! Bob from Jersey, yam bag, I effing knew it. Jim from Jersey, this is the greatest radio I've ever heard. What could be better than Psycho Mark grabbing mad junk? We got you so freaking mad today. It's torture! It's torture! Gay Marco checking in, give me a call Psycho Mark, I never knew you swung both ways. Hey, hey, hey! Goliath from Staten Island, Mark is a sword swallowing, butt pirate, chocolate surfer, bone eating, ball juggler. Boogaloo-gooloo. Junk is over here now. Wow. I have to make an interruption, we have a present for Opie. Oh, Opie, a birthday present. That's okay. You can give it to Mark. Is it from Shannon, the hot piece of ass, or the training? You know what that's for Opie? You know what that's for? Do you need a lesson in that? What did you say? I don't think that's it anymore. I heard that when you were downstairs watching the races. Wacking it, yeah. Oh wow, a little picture for our office too. And last but not least, for those long nights in the bathroom, we have this tape you can put in to give you a little inspiration. Oh yeah, what's the tape of? It's really good. What is the tape of? It's so sound. You must play it, it is wonderful. Alright, we'll get some tape of that and put it on the air. Well Psycho Mark, we got you. I think we have a love connection. Oh, that voice is great. Psycho Mark is still tied up. And we've got to go to Jeff real fast. The host of Survivor that's on CBS tonight. How's it going guys? Sorry for the distraction. It sounded pretty damn good. Well Psycho Mark, one of the regulars on our show that's a complete psychopath, we just tricked him. We had this girl come in, he thought he was meeting one of the fine listeners of the radio show. We duct taped him to a chair. And it turned out that the woman was actually a man and our own Psycho Mark just grabbed man junk. I heard the whole thing on the phone, it sounded awesome. He put his hand right under her skirt and grabbed a yam bag. That's just good radio. Yes it is. Jeff, I've got to say I'm loving Survivor on CBS. Right on, glad to hear it. Second episode tonight on CBS, 8 o'clock right? Right, 8 o'clock Channel 4 there. Channel 2. Channel 2 in New York, yes. So far what, they kicked the old bag off? Well you know what, that was a sympathetic vote. She was there for her own reasons, survived cancer, wanted to prove to herself and other people that she could still do something. That's probably who I would have voted for. She fell down during that little torch relive thing. And she wasn't as strong. Now Jeff, you're the guy that hosts the show right? Right. Okay, you do the tribal council and all that again? Yeah. And you dramatically unlit her torch at the end there when they kicked her off the island? That's the ritual, we're going to do it every single week. We're going to snuff that flame. Now when do we get to see the survivors eating rats? I've been reading about this for weeks now that some of the people in the Survivor series there were eating rats to survive. Coming up pretty quick, in fact they eat something tonight that is, well in Malaysia it's a true delicacy. Is it worse than what Psycho Mark just had in his mouth? Oh no, no. If given the choice I'd still rather eat what they ate. It's a close second I've got to tell you. Okay. Yeah, and they've got to chow that down because that too is for the immunity challenge, meaning if you lose you go to tribal council. So it's like the equivalent of sushi in America in terms of what the Borneo people think of it. But for Americans it's pretty gnarly. They've got to be nasty. And they're going to be eating that tonight. They'll be eating that tonight. And that generation gap is still going on. I mean that still has a little bit more to play out. Yeah, it seems to be the old against the young. Yeah, just for a while. Then it settles down. I'm hearing there's a few gay people on the island we're going to find out about soon. Oh, you hear about that? I've been reading about Survivor. I'm completely hooked after the first week. Yeah, there's definitely not everybody on the island is straight. Well Psycho Mark, when they kick you off. Wouldn't that have been fun? Now, Jeff, did you live on the island with the contestants for like two months or whatever? Yeah, I was out there with them. But you got makeup and your hair's blown dry and you got nice clothes and stuff. No, same T-shirts, same three pair of shorts, no hair, no blow dryer, none of that crap. Just a short haircut which made it easier. Where were you living while everyone else was roughing it? We were on the island just on a different part. We built these little woods and we built these little houses. Just on a different part, we built these little wooden huts. We lived four people to a hut with a common shower. We ate fish heads every night. I'm telling you, everyone wants to think we had an easy ride of it. But I think it's Entertainment Weekly this week that's a cover story. The guy went to the island, he came and visited us and he pretty much paints the true picture. It's a jungle. Yeah, a lot of people thought the production staff and everything had the life of Riley there. But the fact of the matter is there was really no way to get some of the comforts of home even get it there. That's exactly right. There were a hundred of us. We had one phone. So getting on the line when it did work was virtually impossible anyway. So really you just kind of gave in and said, alright, I'm here for two months. Let's do it. Any brushes with near death or anything from these people? Well, the pirates. We had, by the way, I'm taping Rock and Roll Jeopardy today for VH1 and they're waiting on me. So I got to run. No, you can make them faster. I'll be filmed to hold on. But there were pirates circling. I mean, it's a major thoroughfare for pirates to take arms and alcohol and tobacco from one country to another. No, Psycho Mark, not but pirates. No, no, no. But the real deal. And we had armed guards surrounding our island to kind of keep us protected from poachers and people who might want to come on. And we definitely had a few run-ins. Finally, our guy said, listen, that rock out there, that's the border. You come past that, we kill you. Wow. What else can we look forward to on tonight's episode? They're going to be eating some weird things. Eat some weird things, a generation gap. I think sexuality gets discussed a little bit tonight. Alright. Sorry, I have to run, guys. I'll call you back again. That's cool, man. This series starts really heating up. We would love to get you on the show again. Sounds great. Alright, man. There he goes, Jeff. The host of Survivor, CBS Tonight, 8 o'clock. Survivor. Also, he's the host of Rock and Roll Jeopardy on VH1. Rock and Roll Jeopardy. That guy, yeah. I can't wait to watch that tonight, Anthony. Cool. Where's the picture of Anna? I put it in Mark's office. Where is that? Everyone's checking out Anna's junk because it's on that website. What's the website again, Anna? www.hotshannon.com and then you link on the Opie and Anthony banner. And you get to see what Psycho Mark had in his hand. And he texted me and my email address. Alright. Can we hear your real voice one more time before we go to break? Well, what would you like me to say? Say, Psycho Mark, I love you. Psycho Mark, I love you. Whoa. Oh my God. Where's the warning sign right there? Anthony. He looks like the GIF. He looks like the GIF trying to get out of the studio. Psycho Mark, look at him. So those are your pictures right there? Yes. They're the ones that we're trying to get on Nuggets. Actually, the ones that we have that we're sending in are better. They're just webcam shots. Yeah? We have the crumbs. I see you're covering up your junk over there. Yeah. Cleverly have your hand there poised during that shot. Yeah, that's it. Covering the junk. Hey, Anna. Yeah, there's your email. Sure. Anna the Transsexual. Rob from JFK. Make sure Ball Boy, sorry, Psycho Mark washes off the man meat chunk from his hands before touching anything in the studio. Two words for Psycho Mark. Butt sex. You don't even need to take me to the prom. I'm a cheap dick. Butt sex. You're a paynesses. Not great. Pooh time. No, no, no. No, no, no. So when are you having your operation? Yeah, when are you having your operation? Well it depends on how many sugar daddies I find before then. Wait, you need someone to sponsor it? No, I'm just kidding. No, I'm saving my money now. I mean I'm not as press about it, because- How much does that run? If you go to Thailand, I bet it'll be about 7,000. Thailand? If I do it in the US, it'll be 14,000. Well, you get what you pay for. What do you want to do with chopsticks over there, don't they? You kind of pull it away like a piece of rice. You know what? Slice and dice? I don't know. I'd be a little leery. Well, I'd be a little leery about having it... ...I've been thinking about it. My God. Hey, Matt, what's going on? You must hate your penis, don't you? Yeah, guys. You do? Hey, Matt. Hates your penis. What's up? What's up? Hey, guys. All I've got to say is, man, I haven't been listening to you that long. A couple of my friends turned me on, you guys. I'll tell you right now, that was the best joke I have heard you guys pull... ...the entire time I have been listening to you. And Psycho Mark, a very good sport about it. Almost too good a sport. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. Indication when Psycho Mark gets the taste out of his mouth. I should have heard what he whispered in my ear. In your ear? Yeah. What did he say? I'm not telling. Oh. Were you whispering in her ear? He did. That's another show. Psycho Mark has this habit of dry humping girls that walk around... ...can you just dry hump them one last time before we take a break? No! No! It looked like the GIMP. Hold them in place. Hold them in place. Hold them in place. It looked like the GIMP. This is how the poor ladies feel around the office when you're dry humping them. Oh my God. Wow. Oh my God. Oh my God. Toy chair. Pig toy chair. I'm jealous. You can give me some competition on those nipples there. The high heels. No, I'm just going to get them, get them, get them. Come on, dad, it's dad, Dad! Come on, come on. Oh my God. Well, that's pretty funny. You ever seen a grown man naked? Huh? Huh? Huh? That was good. I think it's a case of cabin fever. You think? Huh? It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Oh my God, that was him. It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told. Penis! Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique? What the? What the? What the? What the? You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore. Ouch. Alright. Excuse me while I whip this out. Okay, brother. Whoa! Very good. It's sticking in my mouth. That's what I think. Alright, very good, Mark. Good job. So get him out, Mark. Psycho Mark, what a sport. Yippee. That was good fun. I can actually take a joke on like other people on the show. Nice try, Joke Boy. At least I didn't rip the bad Kim Dora off the wall on smash stains. You didn't recognize Anna without the makeup and the nice hair and everything. It's our own Mark Parento from old Jock from Q104, remember? It's the rare Admiral. Alright, we've got to take a break. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Put your hand up, I'm scared, Mark. Hey. Is that your Jock or you just had to deceive me? Here's another classic hit. Jesus. Alright, well we've got to thank Anna for coming in. Anna, thank you very much. A lot of people checking in on the website saying they went and saw your picture on the website and said they wouldn't have been able to figure it out either. Right on. Wait, we need her to tape a couple things. If we hit record, will it work? Alright, just hit record or just get on that. Alright, Anna, repeat after me in both voices. Look what I did to you again. Look what I did to you again. And now as a guy. Look what I did to you again. Yeah. Alright, let me do that one again. Alright, look what I did to you again. Oh my God. Just a deeper voice than me. I can sing like a girl and a guy actually. Oh yeah? I can trade my voice to that. I bet ShowTunes, right? I can do whatever. I'm guessing Liza Minnelli. Judy Garland? Judy Garland. I can't remember. Bads. Bads. Negative. Yeah, I can do a Peter Steele impression. Really? Can you do that? I've been looking for trouble and boy, I found her. Wow. Hey, that junk was just in your face, Michael Mark. Wow. No, I can't do the alkaline. Alright, listen, we've got to take a break and we'll be back. Gentlemen, start your wacky. Are you masking me naked? Overload. Pleasure overload. Oh, it's a Pate Tangle. I had lots of instant feedback coming in. Big Kev, our Big Kev to cycle Mark. At least I don't smell like man junk. Steve C from FoundryMusic.com, the ONA unofficial website. Please, please, please tell me you've got pictures of this. Yes, plenty. Oh, we have pictures. Plenty of pictures. They're coming your way soon, Steve. Two words for Psycho Mark. Buss sex.

Everyone just in shock around here after the last 45 minutes of radio. That was fun. That was a lot of fun. Very fun. We've got to go to the phones real fast. Go to Mark. Mark, you're next on N.E.W. Hey guys. Hey Mark. I guess that gay hand thing really works. Doesn't Psycho Mark have the gay hand too? The gay pimp hand. You have the gay pimp hand. And now he's touching other guys' mans. What's going on? You're giving all the other guys with the name Mark a bad name there, Psycho Mark. Don't worry Mark. All our listeners have short term memory. They're not going to remember this at the next road show or anything. This will be gone. This will be gone just like no one calls me precious anymore. It goes away in time. It's torture. It goes away in time. Don't worry about it. I don't think there will be one sign at the next road show. I want to come to the next road show. Yes. Come to the next road show. I'll be there. We'll do a recreation. That would be C-O-M-E by the way. Tony, what's going on? Hey, what's up guys? This amazes me. How did he fall for that? In all fairness, we set it up pretty good because we had him tied to the chair and we had him blindfolded. Yes, but you gave him so many clues. First you heard the voice and I was like, oh my God. Then 150 pounds? My girlfriend is 5'11". She's nowhere near 150 pounds. That's 150 pounds of mail. She's got like 10 pounds of junk. I was thinking 50 pounds of sack and everything. I hope he knows that you guys are going to use this against him for a while. You can't even know on our show. We'll play the bit 10 times in the next week. He deserves it. I think he deserves it. I don't know. Remember, Marc, no means yes now. Yes. Thank you. Actually, I think he knew it from the beginning and kind of just wanted to experience the sack. No, I don't think he did. I knew that from the point you started doing that. I was like, they're so going to bust him on this. As he falls for this... I knew it was something. It had to be something. It was a twist. It was too good to be true. He fell for it. You're promotional thing, Marc, is a fact. Say what you want, but you had no clue. I had no clue. I'm fine with Marc checking me out. See? I'm used to this. I don't think he knew. No. It's what I do for a living. I knew all right. Well, yeah, you did. I found out the hard way. You did find out the hard way. Anthony, thanks for spitting all over my legs while you talk. Jim, what's going on? Anthony, what's going on? How are you doing? How are you doing? How are you doing? Don't confuse me. That was the best radio I've ever heard in a long time. That was hilarious. And Marc, I guess, I don't know if you're a full-fledged fig or half a fig, but what I've got to ask is what are you guys going to do to Spaz now? I mean, after he racked up the van, I remember a while back you had him in the bed with some woman in her van. Did you want to have him scream to high heaven? Yeah. We have some classic screams on the show. Yeah. I feel sorry for Spaz. I feel sorry for Rick. Believe it or not, you guys should watch your own back because you guys are going to out-prank each other. We got burned already. I don't know. I've got a feeling one of these days you guys are going to try it. I can't wait to hear it. One will turn on the other? Nah. Just for a prank. Nothing that's so serious. It ain't going to be me. All right, Jim. All right, guys. Thank you. By the way, you guys promised me that Marc would wax me. Oh, really? Oh. What needs waxing? What would you think? I don't even want to know, man. My lip? My lip. Which one? I still know who you guys are now. Rob from Queens. Marc enjoyed touching man-junk more than old dirty enjoyed his hummer. Andrew? Yeah, what's up? Hey. Listen, first off, I think that F.I.C.O. got what he deserved. I can see him in the shower just like in the crying game, in the shower for hours each day. We're going to be like one close from Big Chill. Big Chill in the shower crying. Yeah. I think that's what we want to see. We want to see you guys. We want to see you guys. I think that's what we want to see. We want to see you guys. We want to see you guys. We want to see you guys. We want to see you guys. I think that's what we want to see. We want to see you guys.

Mark's gay, terrific. Matt from the city, I guess Mark likes to receive junk mail. Vinny from Rosdale, hey Psycho Mark, what was in her pants? A cocktail, Frank, foot long or a kibos? Poor baby. Poor baby. Man, I thought he was straight after seeing him in the foam pit at the road show with all that TNA in his face, but now man, he's an effing flameer. Geez man. The gay pride parade committee checking in. Is Mark available for grand marshalling next year? Can you put your junk in a jar after it gets removed and bring it back in here? I'm hoping to do that for you guys actually. Kids. Well they turn it inside out. I'm selling my shoes and stockings, why not those? You'd probably have some testes if you really want them. Chico! Hey Chico, what's up? What's up guys? I learned that Psycho Mark can finally open a nit that he doesn't just like a deployment for the view. Syndication with anti-liquid gays. Alright, thank you. Bye, let's go to Jeff. Hey Jeff, what's up? Hey guys, how you doing? Hey, I gotta tell you man, as soon as I heard that thing's voice, I was like oh my god, it's gotta be a guy, there's junk all over that place. And I think that's like... People are so accepting. Well a lot of people, that's why we had to hide the instant feedback in the phone screen because a lot of people were definitely in on the joke, they knew right away. Yeah, I called them and got me on and I said you gotta tell them to do what's in my pants. I think it's a guy and he just hung up on me. Alright, well we were trying to hang up on all you guys because we didn't want Mark to see the screen. Yeah, but you know what, if I was Mark and I was taking that chair and I heard that person's voice, I would have just threw the chair over and gave myself a concussion. He looked like King Gim for a little while there. He was trying to get out. Alright, John. I'll see you in the kitchen when Mark comes out of the closet. I'm out today! Hey John. Yeah, how's it going? We're doing alright. Hey Mark, you there? Mark there? Yes, I'm here! I'm disappointed with you. Did he think that was really a woman? What's the matter with you? You freaking faggot! As soon as the blindfold came off and it was like effing torsional. Oh, you couldn't tell from the voice? Come on, maybe you're making it with your roommate over there and you're getting a little used to it there. Mark, you're burying yourself. Now you're saying when you took off the blindfold you knew? Because at that point you still had like man chest in your face, man groin rubbing your groin. Yeah, I liked it. I just vary myself right now. I loved it. It was a great time. Let's do it again. Eeeegh eeeegh eeeegh eeeegh. He sure knows how to defuse the situation. Don't worry Mark, this will go away in a couple of days. People will forget. They will. Don't worry Mark. J from Jersey, syndication when Mark turns straight. Alright, well we gotta move on I guess. Can I get caught out of this god forsaken chair so I can burn my body? Brad, what's going on? Oh yeah, listen, she posed for which magazine? Nuggets? Nuggets she said. That should have cleared them off right there. Nuggets is the same thing as Yanbags. Is it really? No, actually it's just a fetish magazine. A fetish magazine. Oh yeah? Yeah, it's kind of like doing a little. A fetish for a maphrodite? No, it's not. Not a fetish. No? Well it sure sounds like it. I don't know, nuggets? Yeah, I know what you're talking about. It's kind of like leg-seeming, stuff like that. Alright, thank you Brad. Let's go to Anthony. Anthony, what's up? Nothing, Opie. How you doing? That old gag. Anthony. Talk about the first thing that pops up, huh? Anthony. What's up Bowen? Hit it. I wanted to see if when he's on the radio chick or he's in the morning show or he's at the syndication never guys. See you later. You cursed. Thank you. Yeah, he's going to watch the language. Yeah, that was a funny line but you need to take eight seconds out of it. It doesn't make sense. So, Ron and Fez check and Ancet and Mark, you'll always be welcome on our show. Fabulous. Alright, we got to move on to other things. Yes. What's the website again? It is at www.hotshaman.com and you click on the Opie and Anthony banner. And you'll see what Psycho Mark was grabbing. Yeah, and you'll see my pictures and my email address if you want to send me anything like email. Right. Do you want to remind them again real quick? What? What? Alright, we got to move on. Yeah. Thank you ladies, I guess. Thank you. You're very welcome. You did a wonderful job. Could you say you're very welcome in your man voice? What do you like about me? I think that's got me in enough trouble today. Oh, wait, we just dumped out all of it. We had a double dump. We had a double dump. Psycho Mark is now cursing. Alright, get him out of there. That was really funny. Another thing that didn't make the air. Geez, get me in trouble. I better stop. What do you want me to do? I'm Anthony. So be beverages. The leader in healthy refreshment. Yes, you're drinking one. Yeah, I don't know what flavor we're plugging today, but I'm enjoying Liz Blizz right now with Echinacea, zinc and vitamin C giving me a fine boost of energy right now late in the show. Psycho Mark likes the one with banana juice in it. No, you know, real fruit juice. Instead of Liz Blizz, it's a word that rhymes with Liz. Yeah, Sobe Beverage is great, provides supplemental herbs designed to energize the body, uplift the spirit and enlighten the mind. Wednesday's flavor? 3G Teas. 3G Teas, a line of exotic teas whose natural health benefits have been enhanced by the addition of Sobe's exclusive 3G package. Jinxing. Jinxing! For long lasting endurance. Ginkgo to sharpen the mind. And Ginkgo to sharpen the mind. Did I just say that? And Guarana. I love the comic wit. Comic stylings of Anthony today. And Ginkgo. Guarana. Guarana. Which provides an immediate energy boost. Sobe Black Tea. Sobe Green Tea with Echinacea. And Oolong Tea with Bee Pollen. Bee Pollen, Opie. It's great stuff, tastes great, and yes, it does enlighten the spirit and the mind. You've got to love it. Well, Anthony, be on the lookout for the Sobe Lizard Love Bus, spreading the Sobe experience all over the Tri-State area. And grab a Sobe and drain the Lizards. Sobe beverages. Matter of fact, Sobe beverages gave us something cool to give away here, Ant. Not for nothing. When it receives a skateboard provided by Sobe Beverages, these skateboards are very, very cool. If you want one, be the tenth caller at 212-757-1027. Whip em out Wednesday. Oh man! One bad door! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. 1027-WNEW. Yes, Anthony, it's Whip em out Wednesday. Of course. We haven't spent much time on Whip em out Wednesday today. It's been a very busy show thus far. No, no. It's a very easy concept. You put wow on your car, and ladies, if they feel like it, will wow you on the way home. Yeah, it's easy. We want everyone to be very safe with their wowing experience, and don't harass the ladies. We would greatly appreciate that. Be cool, all right? Also, Larry complained to you, reminding us that Britney Spears is going to be on Fox tonight. Get your Vaseline now, because it will probably run out like batteries before a hurricane at the store. All the Vaseline is going to be gone from all the pharmacies. Pick it up. Britney. I also have a challenge for the ONA fans. Oh yeah? We love attacking websites. Yeah, that's always fun. Mark from Jersey, thank you for the suggestion. I don't know if you guys care or not, but Britney Spears has an online chat tonight on Fox.com. Tonight at 10 o'clock. Tonight, 10 o'clock, Britney online chat. How cool would it be if we got some ONA questions to the lovely Britney Spears? How funny would it be to tune in or log on to that and see screen names such as Yambag asking Britney if she likes it in the balloon knot? A lot of those web chats are a waste of time. You never get your question on. There's millions of people checking in. Ten questions and they get out of there. It's just fun. I don't know. If we got thousands of our listeners counting in, the odds are much better. So we'll see what happens with that, Anthony. Yambag. Did they finally bury Tito Puente? I hope so. Holy Jesus, they've been parading this guy around. Was there anything left of the body? Poor guy. To put in the ground? How long has he been dead? He's been dead a while now. They were parading his body all over Manhattan yesterday. They saw something actually come off him. Let's see. Yeah, he's here. What, yesterday? Yeah, they put him in the ground finally? They finally buried him, yeah. Finally. They paraded him around the streets of New York. What the hell is that all about? It was weird. I don't know. The casket was on tour yesterday. I guess it's very big. It's very big in the Hispanic community. And they finally got him uptown and buried him. It's just a little strange. I've never seen that before. No. But a lot of people are saying it should be a day of celebration. So I was celebrating. Were you? Mark, I'm just glad he's in the ground finally. The city smells enough. Sorry, that was an easy one. Mark, what's going on? Hey, okay, terrific, guys. I just got wowed on 287 Northbound in Jersey. Nice. You can just tell, Tito. Congratulations. I mean, I can't even keep the sticker on all the time because the old lady gives me a hard time. So I put it on a magnet. Yeah, a lot of you married men out there are suggesting that we come out with the Velcro wow stickers. I just put it on a magnet, man. You just got to step up and say, look, it doesn't mean I'm getting wowed, honey. I'm just supporting the O&A show. Yeah, well, I told them, but don't cut it, you know? Yeah, they're too smart for us. Well, that's a pretty good idea he's got. You get some of that magnetic backing stuff and just put the sticker on that. You can slap it on your vehicle. I made a method for the guys. I work with them. They love it. Oh, cool, man. Well, congratulations. All right. Thanks a lot. Thank you. We haven't heard from many ladies today, Anthony. Teresa. Yeah? Turn down your radio. All right. Oh, my goodness. Teresa? Yeah? Turn off your radio. It's off. Who is that talking in the background? I'm right outside. So, O&A. Take a site. Oh, you're at the O&A. Yeah, it's a flower. Oh, you're at the Wau sticker stop. Yeah, it's a flower. Mid-Island Electrical, 5448 Street and 9. Exactly. Everybody believe in it. I just decided to wow and they took the picture. How many people are around right now? Around 30 people here right now, but everybody believing. Why don't you quickly flash your fun bags? What? Flash your boobs on the show. All right, fine. All right, I want to hear the reaction. Nobody's looking. Well, scream and tell them to look. All right, everybody look. All right, everybody look. Everybody look. Everybody look. Everybody look. Everybody look. Everybody look. Have an ugly set or something? Oh, my God, she's lost. Theresa? Yeah? Hello? Yeah, I'm right here. All right, we don't want to use up the rest of your oxygen. Oh, my God. Okay. Cannot talk to her. Oh, my God. Please, if you're going to call the program, pay attention. Yes, Johnny? Yo. How are you, Johnny? Great, man. LIE Exit 52 got wowed. There you go.

A lot of people have not turned down their radios today for some reason. I can finally listen and take directions. Alright, Lynn. Anyway, I wanted to tell you guys that I'm leaving in a little while and I'm going to be on Route 17 and I'm willing to wow. You're willing to wow if you see the wow signs on Route 17? You bet. Only if I see the wow signs. No guys driving by. I had guys driving by. No, that's why the guys have to get the wow on the cars. We're telling the ladies, only wow cars that have wow on them. Even if they're 16 and driving illegally. What part of 17 will you be on? Oh, geez. Part right by 287. Okay, cool. I guess that's it. Alright. It's an indication when I get to wow you two. Oh, uh-huh. We're here every day. Come on down. Are you serious? See, you know, I know if I come down. Just show us your fun bags. I'll show you my man boobs. Alright, man. I'll talk to you guys later. Alright, let's go. Bye. Happy wowing. Let's go to Teresa. Teresa, what's going on? Teresa! Oh, hi. Hi. I called you before. I couldn't hear what was going on. Oh, that was you. The nightmare from the wow sticker stuff. Sorry, I couldn't hear you. You were rubbing the car. They were rubbing the car up. They were rubbing the car up? Revin, revin. Revin the car up. Yes, alright. Do you have problems with these? Yes. Oh, right now. I just wanted to tell you that I love gorilla. You love gorilla? Yes, I do. Ah. Jeff Norris, you think he's hot? He's good looking. Yeah? What are you checking? I didn't have a man, you know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I didn't have a man, you know. Yeah. Alright, this is pretty weird. I got a man. I got a man. I got a man. I'm not sure, right? Okay. Alright. That's cool. I didn't imply anything. I wanted to tell you guys I love you and syndication now. Alright, well. Shut up! Well, thank you, Doritza. Thanks for wowing at the sticker stuff today, okay? Well, I wow you too. Alright, well, come on by any time. Alright. Shut up! Wow. Alright, bye. I'll talk to you later. Bye. You stupid bitch. Ouch. Wow. Come on. Stop playing my little clips, Anthony. That's not nice. Teresa wants to wow us. Shut up! Lisa, what's going on? Kyle, it's Kyle, Lisa's son. Lisa. Ella. Hi. Hi. Can you hear me? My son wants me to wow everybody. He's sitting here. He's 11. What? Wait, you're in the car with your kids and one of them is... I'm 11. One of them is 11 and they want you to wow. And my daughter is 9 and they love you and they're like, Mom, come on. There's a round sticker. You've got to wow somebody. I don't know if that's like legal. Wear social services when you need them. So you're going to whip out your fun bags in front of your little kids? No, I'll have to turn toward the window. But you should. Oh my God. Oh, somebody protect the children. Oh my God. Well, Lisa, good luck with that, okay? Thanks. All right. Bye. Oh my God, someone take the children away. Hey, Danny, what's going on? What's going on, O&A? How are you? Listen up. I was making a blunt today. What's going on today? People are cursing and they're not turning down their radios. You can't curse on this program. People didn't... 15-year-old kids want to fight. There are just a couple of rules we must adhere to. We'll say just about anything, but you can't curse on the radio. All we do is ask you to turn down your radio before you talk to us. You can't say the F word on the air. Do you sit there and listen to the radio and watch TV and listen to HBO and hear the F word? Right. No. No. Big Jim from Somerset, do you think Stoner Amy is wowing people in rehab today? I can only hope so. We really want to get Stoner Amy's sister on the phone. See how she's doing. We really want to get an update because we're a little concerned for her. Stoner check in rehab. That was just a bad scene the other day. All excited to play Stoner Spelling Bee. We go to the champion Amy and all of a sudden we're talking to her mom as her mom's screaming at us. Turns out Amy just got out of rehab that morning and they already found coke on her. Must be easy to get laid in rehab. You get a little bit of drugs with you. A little blow. Imagine that. Going to the janitor's closet there. Got a tooth. I'm not saying it's ethical. I'm just saying it must be easy. Hey Suzanne. Hello. What's up? Well, my girlfriend and I are just getting on 78 and we're waiting to wow people but no one's got a wow sticker. You've got to be kidding me. What's going on? No one has a wow sticker. If you saw one you'd be wowing. You guys are all prepared. The stickers are all abroad, undone and everything already waiting. Ready to go. Ready to go. One girl's driving and the other girl's going to wow. I think the wow should go for the guys too. We should get a wow sticker. If guys whip out their junk, see girls whip out their boobs, it's fun. Everyone loves it and enjoys it. Guys whip out their junk. You see cops pinning them to the roadway, beating them with their clubs because that is an issue. That isn't the thing that a lot of girls really want to see. Right. If you get some collateral damage with your boobing, with your wowing, like if somebody that's not planning on seeing it sneaks a peek, they're not going to mind. If a guy rips his junk out and a nun is driving by, there's going to be a problem. I want to have a guy right next to me in the car picking up his nose right now as he speaks. Well, don't wow him. He doesn't have a sticker. He doesn't have a wow sticker. We saw some guys, but he was like 80 years old with a wow sticker. Well, wow him. He wants to see it too. We want to wow the young ones. No, 80-year-old guys need the wows too. I need a wow. I need a wow to get my heart going. Yeah, you've got to wow the old codgers. You know something, these girls are more than willing to whip them out? I know. We've got to make an exception. Do you want to give somebody a free wowing? A free wowing right now. Who's driving the car, Suzanne? I am. Okay, what's the name of your friend? B. B? Uh-huh. All right, have B stick her fun bags up against the window. Okay, stick them up against the window. Bare breath and start honking like crazy and tell me what happens to your right. All right, stick them up against the window when they honk the horn. Go ahead. Go ahead. Well, there's no car. Wait, I have to go because a car comes next to me right now. Yeah, wait until there's a car next to you. Oh, yeah, that would be smart. Oh, that was a girl. She looked at us. Never, never, never, never, never. All right, we need a guy. We need a guy. All right. Yeah, it wouldn't be a good idea to do it to the girl. Right. Tell me what's going on. Another chick. Okay, another chick. Well, someone might be into it. Well, no, we'd better get a guy. Get a guy. Start honking the horn. I want to hear the horn when you see a guy. Can you hear it? What? Yeah, they're beeping. I hear the beeping. Oh, okay, that guy just looked. That guy looks? He almost got into an accident. He's trying to swerve in between lanes. Did he enjoy it? He's trying to catch up to us now. All right, what road are you on? Because we have a lot of listeners out there. We're going on the Parkway. Right now, Parkway North by like, um, at the one... Uh-oh, Parkway North where? Parkway U.S. Uh-oh, we've lost them. Oh, my God. Suzanne. We lost Suzanne. We were going to be so many guys, uh, a-wowing on the way home. We'll never know where they are. We lost them. Okay, we got to take a break. All righty. All right. 212-757-1027. Get ready for the ooooh! And with the power of the Wild West, with the wind, Anthony! N-E-W. Anthony. Yes? Uh, brain response to the ONA show, Mujan. Ah. This is like wax stuff, right, Ant? Yeah, it's for waxing. Waxing? Oh, how about that most intimate area on the girl? You don't want to have, especially with summer, going to the beach. Nothing worse than looking like you're cooking up some Jiffy Pop down there. Big padded wad down in the bottom of the bathing suit. Or worse yet, when it's poking out the side. Yeah, like weeds. It looks like, uh, it looks like Larry from The Three Stooges. Hey, look at me. I'm in a bikini. Hey, Mo! Get me out of the bikini. Yeah. Look at the hair just sticking out the sides like that. You can't have that. So, uh, Mujan. Mujan, yeah, for ladies. Waxing is the difference between having itchy, scratchy stubble and silkier, sexier skin. Yes. You can tell a girl that waxes as opposed to a girl that shaves. It's all stubbly, razor bumps and stuff like that. Waxing, oh, nice and smooth. Smooth as silk. You'd never know there was hair there. That's right. And it grows back finer, lighter, thinner hair. And who needs a rash on their cheeks? No, absolutely. Rash on the cheeks. You don't want that. It's kind of a drag, ladies. So, uh, ladies, and guys, get your ladies Mujan wax today. Check them out. Okay, Mujan is available at Dwayne Reid, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus. And if you don't see Mujan, just ask your store manager to bring it in for you, okay? It's Mujan. Whip them out, Wednesday! What is that, like, a kind of guy thing? Like some kind of sexist guy thing? Yeah! You will not get away with this! I wish you could just shut your big mouth! It's Whip them out, Wednesday! Ooh la la. It'll be an Anthony N-E-W. I miss Farley. Goddamn, do I miss Farley. I saw Tommy Boy, uh, last night. It was on. I love that movie there. Housekeeping! Oh, need sleeping! Oh my God! Lauren! Hello! How are you, Lauren? I'm great, how are you? There's no one on Seventeen with Wow's Pickering. I'm actually just getting off 80 at this point, as I'm told. Okay. No one on 80. When is Spassk or whoever going to get out here, Earl? Well, it's still very early in the Wow season. I hope guys would get with the Wow's on their car. Yeah, you guys gotta get the hint at this point. Lauren, if you saw a Wow sign right now, what would you do? I would now! I mean, I'm already at it. I brought off my glasses on, but I'm waiting. But there's nobody. Now I'm going into a section that's definitely not going to have them. See, I don't know. If I was a fan of this show, I would just go, you know what, this thing's just my work. I'm going to put the Wow in my car and see what happens. The girls are out there. I think I'm not doing it! And like I asked Spassk again last week, when is somebody going to come out here for the bumper sticker? Where do you want us to go, Lauren? Well, in Bergen County. We'll go to Bergen County very soon. Great. Thank you. All right, Lauren. We love your presentation now. Thank you. There goes Lauren. Another lady on the line, Sherry. Sherry, what's going on? Sherry? Hello? Yellow. Hello? Hi, Sherry. Hi, Sherry. It's Carrie. Oh, Carrie. Sherry. Sherry. Sherry. What am I? Wow, I never thought we'd meet. I'll speak to her in her native tongue. It's Ba-Bam! Ba-Bam! Ba-Bam! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Ba-Bam! Ba-Bam! Ba-Bam! Ba-Bam! Carrie! Yes. Do you have a better cell? Yes, you do. Okay, what's going on? Hurry up before we lose it again, I hate this! No, no. I haven't said that. I'm waiting for a woman around me. Are you another lady trying to say that you would wow but you're not seeing wow stickers on the highway? You got it. Okay, thank you. That's simple. See the ladies are out there. They are willing to do this. All you have to do is get your wow in your car and just forget about it and see what happens. Denise, how are you? Good, how are you guys? Pretty good. I'm on 80 West going home from work every Wednesday wearing a button down shirt, leaving work, everything. No wow stickers. No wow stickers. Nothing. Guys. Nothing out here. And don't wait for a wow sticker. You can put the homemade wow on your car. That's what I'm hoping but nothing. I see nothing. I'm even dirt written on the back of a truck I'm waiting for. Nothing. That works too because a lot of the truck drivers do that for us. Nothing's out here. All right, Denise. I'm so disappointed. But if you saw a wow you would do it. Most definitely. Okay. I'm ready. All right, thank you, Denise. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye. See it? I'm on the line today. Liz, what's going on? Hi. Hi. I'm sitting in traffic approaching the Lincoln Tunnel. There's guys all around me, all around me. And they're checking me out but they don't have wow stickers on their car and I'm all set and ready to go. Oh, man. Oh. And I'm like dressed up because I'm going to dinner in the city. I look good and I'm ready to wow and there's nothing. Nothing. And all you would have to do is see a wow sticker or a wow sign or wow in the dirt and you will do it for us, right? I have seen wow in the dirt and it's just not here. I'm feeling very lost. All right, Liz. Thank you. Yeah, bye. Now we got a girl in a convertible, Anthony. I've seen a ton of wows out there but obviously we need more wows on the highway. Kristen, what's going on? Hi. Yes, I'm stuck in traffic on 287 going north. Yeah. I'm in a convertible and I'm looking to wow somebody but I don't see any stickers. Oh, my God. Guys, I can't stress. You put a wow on your vehicle, you see naked boobs on your drive home. It makes the traffic seem less annoying, makes the commute just a little bit better. Wow. All right. Well, thank you, Kristen. You're welcome. All right. I want a sticker, the self-addressed stamped envelope still. We're taking those, aren't we? Yes, we are. 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106. Just put a wow sticker on there and W on the W. In the meantime, you just put it in there any way you can. All right. It's written on the dirt, whatever. Hey, Vinnie, what's going on? Yo, ONA, what's going on? How are you? All right. It works, man. I got my homemade sticker on there and I got wow. Congratulations. It works, man. I'm starting to stand in the way home. I have to make sure I take a take-off before I get home. My wife will kill me. All right. Thank you, Vinnie. Well, guys, syndication out. We still had hundreds upon hundreds of winners today in the little wow promotion. Look at this guy, Mike, from Connecticut. I put a wow sticker on my truck and I got nothing. Well, it's like fishing, Mike. You're not going to get a fish every time out, but if you're patient, it'll happen. There are plenty of girls out there that are wowing people with wow stickers. Okay. Let's go to Heather. We're going to seg into what did we learn on the ONA show in a minute here, 2127571027. Heather, what's going on? Hi, guys. How are you? Great. Well, this is a problem. See, I didn't really know what the wow stickers were all about because I've seen three today and I was like chuckling because I knew that you guys had like the Wasted on Wednesday show. Wow. So I was cracking up like just thinking about like, yeah. Hello? Heather, we do a show called Wasted on Wednesday. Isn't it? Who does that? No, it's called Whip Them Out Wednesday. Whip Them Out Wednesday. Where did you hear? Where did you hear Wasted on Wednesday? I heard it from my cousin first too. I thought you guys like had like a bartender like originally come there or something. Oh my God. Is that? That's a couple different stories. All right. Well, that's what I thought it was about. No, Heather, it's simple. It's called Whip Them Out Wednesday. Guys and girls are finding out as well. They put wow on their car. It could be a homemade wow sign. It could be a wow sticker. It could be wow in the dirt. If you see that and you feel like whipping out your boobs, then you do that. And there's a lot of ladies doing that for us. That's what wow is all about. Oh, OK. All right. So stupid. So so stupid. Dan, what's going on? Hey, I was just on 287 North, just past 8 to 11. Yeah. I was listening to a show, a lap in my rear-up. Yeah.

I play with myself all day long. That was a good one. Yeah. All right. I guess we're done. Yeah, another day. And I learned something today. What did we learn? I learned that some people out there do get butt sex on prom night. On prom night. Butt sex. It's a hell of a move. It's a hell of a move. Taking the little girl out of the house with the parents looking, smiling out the front door with the brand new corsage on her chest. They hop into the limo. Now fast forward, into the prom night. She's getting butt sex. What are you doing between to get to that point? Lots of roofies. Steve. Roofies. Steve. How are you doing, guys? How are you?

Kelly from Jersey, I learned that King Gimp gets funnier every time I hear it. King Gimp. All right, Ant. We got a surprise. We do. I'm in the middle of commercials. We'll come back real fast for a quick surprise. Stay there. Boo. The world's universal language. I use my breath to get other people's attention. We're the full out white jays. There'll be an Anthony. The brain is in their pants. One, two, seven, W, N, A, W. Hey, Anthony, brand new sponsor on the ONA show. The razor roller board scooter, Opie. Yeah, we got to welcome them to the program. You can get this damn thing at Sharper Image. We've had them around here for the last couple months, and we fly all over the office with these things. They're cool. It's a lot of fun, man. We use them like I've said all the time. It's very hard to walk around a corner now without somebody barreling down the hallway on these things. Why don't you explain the razor roller board scooter, Anthony? Okay. It's got an image in their brains right now. It's a very cool gleaming stainless steel and aluminum inline scooter. It's got inline skate wheels on it, and it's got like a handlebar contraption, fully adjustable. It packs down to a real small size, too. But you open it up, and you just tool around on this thing. Yeah, it's a hot product. A lot of the magazine's talking about these things. We love them. We haven't tried them outside yet, but I can imagine it would be pretty cool on the outside as well. And everyone loves them, kids, teens, college students. I've seen people commute on these things. What, are you going to like sketch? Grab the back of a cab or something. Although we don't endorse that. No, you can get around pretty fast with this. They have a little brake, tiny little brake, so if it's going too fast, you can push down on it. You know, I just discovered the brake today. As a matter of fact, I tried to turn really sharp, and I laid the thing down, knocked the garbage over by the phones, all over stinky. Pretty funny. I'm a hazard on these things. They're a lot of fun, though. Yeah. And you could get these things at Sharper Image, Anthony. Visit one of their stores. Go online at sharperimage.com. I'm sure they have a picture of it. Or you could give them a call. 1-800-344-4444. That's 1-800-344-4444. And if you're the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027, 10th and 11th? Yeah. All right, we'll give away two of these things. 10th and 11th callers at 212-757-1027 will win a Razor Rollerboard, courtesy of Sharper Image, all right? Right. All right, you can also win by visiting any New York area Sharper Image store and fill out an entry blank. The Sharper Image store will give away five Razors on Sunday, June 25th. No purchase necessary. Winner need not be present.
