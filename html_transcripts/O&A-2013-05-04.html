<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week" countdown. This was followed by an interview with Vinny from *Jersey Shore*, promoting his new MTV talk show filmed at his house.  The interview was rife with cursing and crude humor, featuring Vinny's mother and Uncle Nino, and boasted celebrity guests on Vinny's show including Kesha, Mark Wahlberg, Lil Wayne, and Iggy Azalea.  Anthony then regaled listeners with highly embellished and outrageous tales of his childhood Tijuana trips with his father, involving drunken driving, reckless driving on cliff roads, bar fights, and witnessing a shooting.  A brief, awkwardly cut short interview with Sir Ben Kingsley followed, touching on his role in *Iron Man 3*, his early career, and an unexpected connection to Brian Epstein.  Numerous advertisements for various products and services were scattered throughout this portion of the show.

The show continued with an interview with Anthony Bourdain. He recounted perilous experiences filming his show, including two ATV accidents (one resulting in a severe head injury), and dangerous encounters in the Congo with armed groups and corrupt officials. Bourdain discussed the challenges of filming in volatile locations, the importance of local fixers, and his observations on the Congo's decline from its colonial past. He also commented on the inaccuracies of news coverage of places like Libya and employed gallows humor to cope with traumatic experiences.

The broadcast then featured a performance by Stephen Lynch, who performed "Queer Tattoo" (containing highly offensive lyrics and racial slurs) and "The Night I Laid You Down," a song with a running gag about a mistakenly attributed Phil Collins track.  Lynch engaged in comedic banter with Opie and Anthony, interspersed with more advertisements.

A second "Worst of the Week" countdown segment followed, fueled by Opie and Anthony's anger over their SiriusXM channel being moved next to a "sex radio" channel without their knowledge.  This segment also featured Mark Maron, who recounted an awkward encounter with a friend who gave a lengthy monologue about his penis during a live podcast, and two anecdotes about his experiences with prostitutes, one involving a breast lump and another a near-arrest for receiving oral sex in his car. Advertisements for erectile dysfunction medication, debt solutions, Dish Network, and other products were included in this segment.

The show then transitioned to another "Worst of the Week" countdown, culminating with a studio appearance by Mike Tyson.  The segment began with a caller detailing near-death experiences and an extended, explicit story about his hypochondria.  Mike Tyson joined the conversation, offering crude and sexually explicit commentary on women, discussing his drug use, relationships, and past encounters with celebrities including the Iron Sheik (who allegedly urinated on the set) and Hulk Hogan.  He also commented on Howard Stern and his perceived change, his boxing career, and shared an anecdote about Jake LaMotta.  Tyson discussed his understanding and use of fear in boxing.

Finally, the show included an interview with Jerry O'Connell.  He shared stories from filming *Jerry Maguire*, his audition process, interactions with Tom Cruise, and anecdotes about his friendship with Jay Mohr, including explicit and humorous stories from their younger years.  The conversation covered their pasts, careers, and evolving friendship.

A final segment featured Jay Mohr. He discussed a physical altercation stemming from a romantic entanglement with a woman also dating Anthony Michael Hall, detailing a threatening phone call and subsequent fight.  The conversation covered Mohr's time on *Saturday Night Live*, *Jerry Maguire* (including anecdotes about Tom Cruise), and his experiences with the cancelled ESPN show *More Stories*, criticizing Mark Shapiro for its alteration and cancellation.  He also discussed his family life, his brother's appearance on *The Bachelor*, his work on *Camp Wilder* (including interactions with Hilary Swank), and his career in sports media. The segment concluded with further promotional mentions and vulgar language.

[00:03:00]  This is the Worst of a Week countdown.  When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony show, call it the worst.  Read it.  And then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what's his name, Facebook.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  It's the Worst of the Week countdown, where we count down the worst of the week.  But, you know, it's actually the best.  That's what we do.  It's a cute little thing we do on the Opie and Anthony show.  My name's Sam Roberts.  You've heard me on the show.  You've heard me on After O&A Live.  This was a huge week.  We're highlighting all of it for you. 
[00:03:30]  You're going to love it.  We had Ant Stories from Tijuana.  Awesome guests.  Stephen Lynch made his return to the show.  Mike Tyson was on the show.  Mark Maron was on the show.  The great Ben Kingsley was on the show.  Anthony Bourdain was on the show.  Before we get to any of that, Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  Of all the people on the Jersey Shore to get a talk show, Vinny gets a talk show.  You know, he's been friends with us for a while, since he first came in and did the show.  He came back.  His Uncle Nino was with him. 
[00:04:00]  His mom was with him.  Because the premise for this talk show he's doing, it's on MTV.  And it all takes place in his house.  And his family stars with him.  They're a very strange family.  And they're fun to hear.  Especially on the radio.  That's what we have for you on the countdown.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  How did they convince you to do a TV show?  Did you want to be in the spotlight or no? 
[00:04:30]  I love you to say that.  I really didn't see anything coming.  You know, I mean, Vinny had asked me, you know, told me about the idea.  And I said, fine.  Yeah.  You know, whatever you need me to do.  I mean, I'm always cooking and we always have family over.  And so, I just figured, what's a couple of more 35 people, you know?  What couple of more 35?  She doesn't know what's going on.  She doesn't care about what people want to eat.  She doesn't know who any of the celebrities are that come over.  Now, you know? 
[00:05:00]  Neither does he.  I don't know who they are.  Now I know who they are.  I don't think he knows.  No, you don't know.  Who you have that?  No.  No, I know Mark Wahlberg from the movie Ted, you know?  Just from Ted.  From Ted, that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, look who I have.  Well, yeah, you have Mark.  You have Kesha.  Kesha.  Kesha's a fucking nut.  Yeah.  Off the wall.  Are you supposed to be cursing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could curse on this one.  Does your mom, do you mind the cursing?  Right.  Do you mind the fucking shit?  No, I don't mind it.  No.  I don't mind it. 
[00:05:30]  No, you don't mind it.  The other day, she was, the New York Post wrote like a bad review and they started making  fun of her.  Oh, shit.  And then someone starts, all I hear is someone telling her, then I just hear her go, fuck  them.  That's what you don't care.  I actually said.  Say it.  You said, fuck them.  Fuck her.  Oh, fuck her.  Fuck her.  What was it?  She made fun of my hair.  She made fun of me.  She said, I was brought up in the Roosevelt.  What did she say?  Roosevelt era.  What was it?  That fucking Stassi? 
[00:06:00]  What's her name?  Yeah, yeah.  Linda Stassi.  Linda Stassi.  She had no fucking wrist.  She probably bald.  She's like, he doesn't need his mom.  She wouldn't be bald, I'm fucking old lady.  What did she say?  He doesn't need his mom to succeed.  Anyway, she's from like the Roosevelt era.  She looks like she's right out of the Roosevelt era.  Oh, man.  That'd be said something about me.  I woke up with my shirt open.  Oh, he glorifies the stereotype.  But that's true.  The Italian stereotype.  What did I do?  Oh, fucking bitch.  What are you going to say?  And what?  I think she's a paisan, too.  She wouldn't make fun of somebody's mom. 
[00:06:30]  Exactly, right?  She's obviously not a mom, right?  Probably not.  I hope not.  Not with that job.  Exactly.  You know what?  Yeah, moms get a pass.  Yeah.  They get a pass with everybody.  You don't goof on moms.  Yeah.  How was Lil Wayne?  Lil Wayne was like super respectful.  Just like when you bring anyone around a mom, they become like little boys.  He took off his hat.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you.  Did he offer us some scissor?  No, we didn't drink the scissor.  This was pre-scissor, Lil Wayne. 
[00:07:00]  He wasn't on drugs?  You don't think I told him?  Probably.  I don't lift his pants up.  Right, right, right.  You're embarrassing myself.  You're insulting us.  You're an embarrassment.  You're going to tell people to lift their pants up?  Look at you.  You're insulting me and my family.  You're a walking insult.  Now, this isn't a set.  This isn't some stage.  This is your house.  Yes.  Did you have any reservations about opening your house up to these people? 
[00:07:30]  No, I really did not realize.  Not that I didn't realize.  You know, it's a big old house.  And I raised, you know, 30 years were there.  And I raised my kids there.  See, the thing is, it's not a fancy house.  Yeah, I never even had friends come over because it's a tiny house.  My apartment.  We have one bathroom.  We live in an apartment, basically.  And then it went from that to being the set.  And then I told MTV and everyone, I said, you know, there's other places.  We go to my aunt's house. 
[00:08:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm buying a new house.  We can go to that one.  They're like, no, we want this nitty-gritty, raunchy apartment right here.  It's not raunchy, Benny.  Oh, Benny.  Come on now.  It's tight.  It's tight.  It's tight.  How many people live in an house?  Asshole.  Yeah, but you know what it is?  We never had, like, a...  We get wise.  They had their own room.  I'm smart enough, my motherfucker.  I had my own room, but we didn't have, like, a living room.  It was just a kitchen, you know?  Yeah.  Everyone, like, you walk into the living room, then all of a sudden, they're in my mother's room. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like railroad rooms, you know?  Yeah, you can tell it's very small.  But we made my sister's room the green room.  Yeah.  We made my mother's room the dining room.  Yeah.  And we put lights in.  There's lights hanging up in the ceiling.  Yeah.  Now, how often do you...  Is this intrusion on your life happening?  Every day for two months.  It's every day for two months.  Yeah, not every day, but we go according, like, sometimes four times a week.  But you can't really break everything down and...  No, it stays up.  So it stays up.  So...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, I bought a new house with my Jersey Shore money. 
[00:09:00]  Nice.  And now we run away.  So at the same time that we were filming, we were sleeping in the new house.  Oh, okay.  That works.  But it's like an empty house.  How big is it?  Yeah.  It's pretty...  It's like...  It's a decent size.  It's bigger than this one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that Alan?  Yeah, I bought it for me, my mother, and my sisters, and I live in the downstairs...  Why do you live with your family?  Because you're a successful guy, and I mean, I live at home when I was 30, but do you just  like living with your family?  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I wanted to...  Like I said, I wanted to get them out of that little apartment, you know, and I don't have 
[00:09:30]  it like that where I can buy them a house and me a house.  Right, and you a house.  Sure.  I kind of bought a house that has two houses in one.  Like, I live in the basement.  I made it like a sick apartment.  You would still live with us.  No, ma.  Where are you going?  It's a very Italian thing to do.  Yeah, but soon I want to get out there and get my independence.  I just travel a lot so much that I end up coming home, and I want to just eat my mother's  cooking, do my laundry.  And do the laundry.  Does mom do your laundry, or do you do it?  No, my mother does it.  Your mother does the laundry?  Mama's boy.  Yeah.  I can't wash this shit.  It smells like shit. 
[00:10:00]  You probably need to wash in the toilet.  I guess.  Don't wash in the toilet.  Don't wash in the fucking toilet.  Don't wash in the toilet.  Don't wash in the toilet.  It smells like shit.  What?  He said, don't wash the clothes in the toilet if it smells like shit.  See?  And I don't need a reservation to go to the house.  I just show up.  And the food, the syrup, I show up to eat.  You just show up.  We didn't even know how we got on the show.  No reservation.  Yeah.  By the way, who conceptualized this show?  Basically, I started to improv, and I do stand-up comedy. 
[00:10:30]  Not do it, but I did it once.  But I do UCB.  So, um...  Shut up.  Fuck up.  So, when I went to them, I said, listen, I want to do something else that's not reality,  you know?  And they always put me on their little...  MTV has a million shows, like talking head shows and stuff.  And I've done acting stuff for them.  And then they will...  You know, I guess they saw that there was more to me than just follow me around and watch  me drink.  And then, um...  But America does know me with my family. 
[00:11:00]  They know me from Staten Island.  So, we wanted to incorporate that on...  So, we weren't going to have a sitcom.  You know what I'm saying?  Because you don't have to script these people.  And then, plus, I guess the network wanted a place where artists and actors can come promote  their stuff.  And it's never been done before.  So, we gave it a whirl.  Who have you had on, besides Lil' Lame?  We had Kesha, Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Mackie, A$AP Rocky, Red Foo, Whitney Cummings, Jenny  McCarthy, a lot of people.  Just like a lot of current pop culture MTV audience people. 
[00:11:30]  One of my favorites was that Tyler, the fucking...  Tyler, the creator.  He's a fucking nut.  Sierra.  Oh, the list is right here.  Perez Hilton.  Who was the girl that sat on...  Got on her knees under the table?  Oh, Iggy Azalea.  Yeah, what was that all about, man?  I came in...  I came in tea and you were under the fucking table.  What was he doing there?  Hold on, this girl, Iggy Azalea.  You ever hear of her?  No.  She's like this tall Australian...  Like seven feet tall.  Wilhelmina.  She's a model, but she's like a gangster.  Rapper.  Uh-huh.  And she's hot.  She good?  She's hot.  But she was trying to feed me and she couldn't reach the table. 
[00:12:00]  We didn't have a chair, so she got on her knees.  Oh.  And I'm like literally five seconds into the interview.  And I'm like, this is awesome.  You know what I mean?  Like five minutes, the girl's on her knees.  What's she doing on her knees?  What?  What's she doing on her knees?  She was like spreading...  She was tall, so that's how she reached the table.  My mother had a heart attack, but Jenny McCarthy was like in my bedroom, in my bed.  I grew up in...  She was very forward.  Yeah.  She was very forward.  Yeah.  They kicked me out of that episode.  They kicked me out.  They kicked me in their fucking garage.  You were saying before that everybody's been respectful or anything, but has anybody done 
[00:12:30]  anything that you were kind of like, oh, this is my house?  Well, the women.  Yeah.  Well, Jenny McCarthy, yeah.  She started talking about SCX.  She would never say sex.  She would never say sex.  Say sex.  Wow.  That's a little...  I'll say what you want to say, and I'll say what I want to say.  Oh.  Wait.  She always fucking gives it to me.  She always fucking gives it to me.  God damn.  Nino.  But you didn't like the dirty talk. 
[00:13:00]  You don't mind a little cursing, but the dirty talk.  And then my daughter on one side, I have a daughter who's 20 who hasn't dated yet.  So 21, they're now out to date.  Oh.  Yeah.  And, you know, they respect that.  My older daughter's 28 now, and now she says, mommy did the right thing.  And this one is 20, and she hasn't dated yet.  Wow.  Even though she likes a boy now, I know.  Oh.  White kid?  But she's going to be 21 in February.  What the fuck?  All right.  What the fuck?  And I'm like, what the fuck? 
[00:13:30]  Hey, that was the most serious question anyone's ever asked.  I've never seen you respond like that.  Nino.  I have no idea what happened.  Bro, Nino.  Stop.  Bro, you're on TV.  What?  Your mother wouldn't go for that.  She's into a guy.  She's got information out.  And I said, is it a white guy?  Oh.  And Nino's like, what the fuck?  Come on.  Of course.  Hey, what are you talking about?  What the pegays?  Is that better?  What the pegays?  You know what?  It's 2013, Nino.  Come on.  It doesn't matter?  No, I'm not. 
[00:14:00]  I like dark girls.  You wouldn't care, though, your little girl.  I think it's shot in the dark old times.  Your little girl comes home with a black guy.  Normally, if you look at the average of Italian families, they don't want their little girl  coming home with a black guy.  No, we don't really discriminate.  You know what?  I mean, if it made her happy.  I would always talk because we don't discriminate.  Sure.  Oh, my gosh.  Shut up.  Hey, guys.  Shut up. 
[00:14:30]  Is he going to shut up, Nino?  Nah.  Anyway, so I think what happened was I figured it out like 40 years later because I'm here.  I'm 53.  43 years.  Anyway, when I came to America, I didn't speak a word of English.  None of us did.  So, by coincidence, the neighbor, like my grandfather lived on Bradley, the neighbor was a black  family, African-American.  And also on the other side, and these people really, if it wasn't for them, a girl named 
[00:15:00]  Deborah, I'm really heavy, heavy.  I had never seen a black person.  Oh, wow.  I swear to God.  I love that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's where you go.  Oh, my God.  Vinny's getting so nervous with this conversation.  I had never seen a black person.  And Deborah, she used to put me on the bus every morning, take me to the bus stop.  Uh-huh.  Vinny's panicking.  What's that?  I love this.  It's a nice story.  I know.  Vinny's hyperventilating. 
[00:15:30]  He's panicking.  Why?  He's watching his MTV video disappear.  It's a sweet story for me.  Anyway, so later on in life, I had people tell me, people that I really didn't care for  too much, that used to tell me, oh, you're like that because you're an immigrant too,  you know, and, and, you know, you were, you were, um, a minority.  Right.  So that's why I don't discriminate, you know, which is bullshit, probably. 
[00:16:00]  But maybe that had something to do with it.  Maybe it did.  I don't know.  She put you on the bus.  Yeah.  Your first experience with black people was pleasant.  You just were under the bus.  Pleasant.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She made sure every morning she used to come to the house, take me by the hand.  Yeah.  You too, Nino?  Oh, my God.  How did you grow up with this guy?  How did you grow up with this guy?  You know what?  It's always been like this.  I swear to God.  As it always, right? 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  That's why my father used to beat the shit out of me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Nino got beat a lot?  Yeah.  To get the strap?  Yeah.  The strap.  The buckle, everybody.  Oh, man.  Only him.  I wonder why.  I don't know.  Just me.  Yeah, I wonder why.  So how did he react when he was getting beaten?  Huh?  He stood there.  He took it.  He said, hey, you hit me.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Yeah, he didn't used to talk to him like that. 
[00:17:00]  He said, what are you talking about?  He couldn't run.  Bob, what the fuck?  You had to take it with daddy.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I was on somebody, so I was on a cradle.  It didn't work anyway.  Yeah.  Well, we're about through for the day.  Thank God.  Stay tuned for...  I'm sorry to bring no wine today.  Sorry.  I'm sorry to bring no wine.  Oh, that's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  That's tough.  Hey, where's my buddy O?  Where's Opie?  Opie, yeah.  He's taking care of his kids. 
[00:17:30]  His kid's got a little flu.  I was going to say, I was the kid.  His kid's got a little flu.  So he was up all night with the kid.  He's the nurse.  He's the nurse.  So he...  Yeah, yeah.  You know how it is.  Let him tell us about our show.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's called...  It's called the show.  Shut the fuck up.  The show with Vinny premieres this Thursday, May 2nd, tomorrow night.  It's 10 o'clock on MTV, and, you know, it's Vinny.  No matter what race you are, watch it.  Exactly.  It's all-inclusive.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's an international show.  Everybody can watch it.  Yes.  Perfect. 
[00:18:00]  It's obviously a very entertaining family, and, you know, I would certainly suggest watching  it.  Oh, yeah.  Just see people kind of come in and mix.  It's a really different idea for us.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're thrusting two worlds together, and it's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Thanks, Travis.  Fantastic.  Thanks so much.  Your mom's adorable.  I love it.  And Nino, you're...  The coffee sucked, but it's all right.  It's actually pretty good.  What the fuck?  I'm tired of all of you.  He's what the...  I'm tired of all of you.  He's tangled in the headphone cords.  I don't know what the hell he's doing. 
[00:18:30]  Thank you.  Take care.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Very good.  Little hugs and kisses going on here.  Hey, Nino.  How you doing, my friend?  Hey, huh?  Sam.  My friend, take care, huh?  You're a white albino.  White albino.  There it is.  He's saying his goodbyes to Roland, and out the...  There he goes.  Take it easy, my friend.  Holy shit.  He's an entertaining guy, though.  He really is.  Yeah, yeah.  I know. 
[00:19:00]  He is.  He's a nice guy.  I like him with the contrast of Vinny and his mom, because his mom just telling him to  shut the fuck up.  It's hilarious.  Hey, my sister told me to shut the fuck up.  We're going to...  He was really in a panic when his mom started telling the story about the black family that  lived next door.  Yes, yes.  He was worried that fucking Nino was going to blurt something out.  Well, if you remember...  He was quiet.  Yeah.  And the TV guy goes, oh, Uncle Nino's very quiet.  I was like...  Oh, yeah, sure he is.  Now, Nino, if you remember, he was telling some off-color jokes a few times back when 
[00:19:30]  he was in, and Vinny was just like...  Because he just sees his whole career going down the shitter, because his fucking uncle  blurted something stupid out.  In this day and age, they don't care.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony Show, from after  ONA Live.  Still to come on this here countdown, where we're highlighting all the greatest moments  of the week that was.  We're going to be talking about the channel change that's happening with this very channel.  We're going to be talking to Anthony Bourdain, Ben Kingsley, Stephen Lynch, Mark Maron, 
[00:20:00]  Mike Tyson, but before we get to any of that, on Friday, Roland decided it was Taco Day, and  he got some people who make tacos here in New York to come in and give them to us.  That's Roland's new thing.  All of his favorite restaurants, I guess he wants to eat for free, so he gets them to come  in.  They give us food, we mention their restaurant, and he gets to eat for free.  I don't know, but sometimes greatness comes out of it, and we get to hear stories about 
[00:20:30]  aunt and his dad, and growing up and going to Tijuana.  Who's got stories of their childhood in Tijuana?  Unless you're Mexican or from San Diego, probably not a lot of you.  Anthony has those stories.  A guy from Long Island who collects guns is now going to tell us what it was like when  he was growing up in Tijuana.  It's amazing.  And it's the worst of the week, Ken.  I love Mexico. 
[00:21:00]  I used to, my dad used to take me to Tijuana, where we used to live in San Juan Capistrano.  My dad would take me down to Tijuana.  And it was interesting.  I liked it.  Very colorful.  Did you buy souvenirs?  No, because the second you brought money out, a bunch of kids would come running up.  And they'd ask you for it.  Yeah, I love it, Dad.  And then there were horses painted like zebras.  It was cool, though.  I bought a big ceramic bowl and brought it across the border. 
[00:21:30]  The border guy wanted to know what was in it.  I was like, it's a piggy bank.  I just paid more attention to my dad.  He's hammered.  Would he drink in Tijuana?  Oh, would he ever.  Tequila.  I love it.  Wow.  Yeah, our Tijuana trips are legendary.  Even though you had to drive?  Oh, yeah, he didn't care.  Dad would drink and drive at the same time, like with a beer.  I remember once, you had a beer in one hand. 
[00:22:00]  He had his CB mic in the other with the cord.  And his hand on the wheel with the CB mic.  And then he tried to make a turn and wind his hand around.  He got literally wrapped up in the CB cord.  And the beer started spilling.  And we're going into another lane.  And he was hammered.  Did you ever take his beer and dump it out the window and say, this is really irresponsible?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  What, are you kidding?  That would have been death.  Where would he drink in Tijuana, like on the street?  Or would he bring you into, like, scary bars? 
[00:22:30]  It would be in scary bars.  Yeah, yeah, there was some scary bars.  They didn't throw you out when you were being young.  It's Tijuana.  And you were just...  The fucking girl doing the sex show was younger than me on the stage.  How old were you?  That's fantastic.  How old were you?  I was probably 13, around there.  And you just sit at the bar?  And I would just sit at the bar.  Or if they didn't let me sit at the bar, I'd sit at a table, because it was like a bar-restaurant thing.  Well, you guys would drive in, right?  And he would just drink.  Oh, yeah, we would drive in.  And then, uh, and drive out.  Were you worried about your car getting stolen?  Or wasn't he worried back then about getting ripped off?  I heard in Tijuana you'd get ripped off for it. 
[00:23:00]  No, I don't think he cared.  Yeah.  Yeah, he didn't...  Dad didn't really think much about it.  Yeah.  You're making someone very uncomfortable on the road.  No, this is my experience in Tijuana.  She's very uncomfortable.  Oh, I know.  She's trying to figure out how the fuck to get out of here.  Why?  Why?  No, it was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  But I remember, it was very dangerous.  Like, some of the roads through San Diego were, uh, you know, the cliffs there and stuff.  You know, and we'd be driving this truck, and my dad was hammered, and, you know, I'm just 
[00:23:30]  looking over.  Like, I used to love red lights.  I was, like, now I hate it, but I used to drive with my dad, and then there'd be a red  light, and it was the time where I could go...  I'd breathe again.  I could breathe a little.  And I'm like, fuck.  And then, like, green.  I would just tense up again for the whole fucking ride.  And I'm, like, leaning my body, trying to steer the truck, like, away from the cliff, away  from an iron.  Like, a big cement con rock truck is rumbling down the road, and he's drifting into that 
[00:24:00]  lane.  He's drinking it.  He's on his CV.  And if I even said, like, dad, dad, look, look, he'd be like, I see it, goddammit.  Don't tell me.  I'm like, oh, god.  Oh, oh, oh, red light.  Oh.  I'm alive.  How far was it?  Green!  That was terrible.  How far was it?  It was, like, uh...  What's it from?  San Diego to...  Or from...  It was between L.A. and San Diego, Capistrano.  Like, two and a half, three.  Yeah, it was probably a couple hours. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, you were taking a long drive since you could see a ladder.  Oh, fuck it.  Dude, we used to go to Lake Elsinore from Capistrano, and that's over the Ortega Highway.  It's like a movie road, where it's just on the edge of a cliff the entire way, and it's  all windy.  Jesus.  And it was...  It was horrifying.  And you'd get in those lines to go through customs?  Uh, like that?  Yeah, yeah.  That was going to Mexico.  Yeah, it was...  We'd get on the line to go through customs.  They wouldn't give a shit.  He'd be happy.  He'd be like, how you doing today? 
[00:25:00]  And he was the one that always thought he was, like, the big flirter when he was drunk.  So it was like, hi, little lady.  That's what they want to hear.  Yeah, a woman.  Is that...  I remember once he was like, you've got a compression like pieces and cream.  He said that one.  It's like, oh, God, Dad, stop it.  Would you be embarrassed?  Oh, yes.  But why were you guys going down there?  It was just a week, like a Saturday thing to do.  It's lawless.  Go down there?  Yeah.  What time would you go? 
[00:25:30]  It was early in the morning.  We would leave.  Oh, okay.  So we'd be there for the afternoon and part of the evening.  We'd probably head back about seven and stuff.  So it was a full day.  Back when it was dark.  Back on the cliff road.  Yeah.  Yeah, the dark nighttime was just a horror show.  It was just...  I was tense the whole ride.  Clutching your bowl.  Oh, it was horrible.  And, by the way, it was a shift truck.  Oh, no.  So he was...  And it was on the column.  That's right.  So he's driving CB, beer, shifting, trying to steer. 
[00:26:00]  Old Blue, the lab was in the fucking back of the truck.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And you see enough to watch him because the poor dog is ready to jump out of the truck.  It was just...  It was so much anxiety for me.  My trip to Tijuana was so much anxiety.  I love the picture of you in the bar.  Old creepy characters and smoky.  And you're just sitting there like...  Yeah, they were like... 
[00:26:30]  A little kid.  Yeah, a little kid.  A little maniachi band would be playing.  And I'd just be sitting there.  And Dad's at the bar like...  Yeah, another tequila.  Yeah.  And I'm just sitting there.  And he'd look back.  What do you need?  Another Coke?  He's like...  Yeah.  People's guns sticking out of their pockets.  Would he talk to people or interact with people?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He was very social.  Yeah.  A couple of times.  Downstairs from the Franciscan.  There's a place called the Franciscan.  And that was in Capistrano. 
[00:27:00]  I guess...  I guess we were leaving.  And we had a bunch of his friends and stuff.  All drunk and everything.  And he was leaving the parking garage, which was underneath the Franciscan.  And his truck blew a lot of smoke.  So he stepped on the gas and smoke blew out.  And a bunch of these tourists...  And they hate it.  If you lived in Capistrano.  Because the Swallows always come back and they got the mission there.  So there were tourists everywhere.  And if you lived there, you hated the fucking tourists.  So he stepped on the gas.  And a bunch of black smoke came out of the exhaust.  And these tourists were like...  Hey, you fucking asshole. 
[00:27:30]  Fuck you.  And my father was like...  Fuck me.  Fuck you.  And everyone gets out of the truck.  And like...  Now I'm out of the truck.  So I'm probably 14, maybe 13, 14 years old.  And I'm standing there with these big drunk men.  And these other tourist guys.  And they're like...  Yeah, you fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck...  And I'm like...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So...  So one of these guys...  One of my father's friends throws his cigarette pack at one of his other friends.  He goes, hold these, Finney. 
[00:28:00]  And he goes to hold them because he's going to clock this guy in the head.  And the tourist just pounded him in the face.  And my father's...  One of my father's friends is down already.  You saw your dad get beat up.  No.  It was one of my father's friends.  Got beat up.  He got beat up.  So then it was on.  And at that point, two guys come running after me.  Because I'm the little fucking guy.  Oh, no.  So I'm like, whoa!  I'm hightailing it.  You didn't fight?  Why would I fight?  I didn't even want to be there.  This grown-up's coming for me.  Yeah.  And it was two of them.  Well, my dad turned around. 
[00:28:30]  I grabbed one of them.  And then the other guy, like...  I guess he, you know, I ran up the stairs and that was it.  But then I went back downstairs and the cops were there.  And they put everybody against the wall.  So we're all just kind of leaning against the wall.  And I'm looking over and my father's there.  And there's Hal Finney with his fucking eye all bloody.  And I'm like, oh, this was a great night.  We were leaving.  Hal Finney.  Hal Finney.  It was Hal Finney.  The Cutters.  Yeah.  The Cutters are in trouble again.  Oh, it was crazy. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hal Finney's taco shop.  Hal Finney taco hut.  I haven't even thought of Hal Finney in years.  I love the fact that Hal Finney got clocked in the eye.  Hal Finney was a little bloodied.  I don't know, but it sounds like he deserved it a little bit.  Yeah, all of them did.  That's for sure.  Like his fighting prep is hold these.  I saw my dad brawl a few times.  He always did pretty good for himself.  Yeah, he never got his ass kicked.  I remember when he beat up a Mexican guy for trying to pick me up at a party. 
[00:29:30]  No.  Yeah, I was hanging out at a party.  And it was an outdoor at the stables and stuff.  And we were hanging out.  And I was drinking some of this home brew that they used to make.  And everybody else was.  So they were pretty hammered.  So I was hanging out.  And my dad was talking to his friends.  I was probably the same age, like 13, 14.  13, 14.  Adorable.  Yeah, I was adorable.  Very molestable.  And there was this Mexican guy.  And he was all kind of drunk.  And he came over near me.  But with an earshot of my dad.  He goes, hey, how are you doing? 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, oh, good, good, good.  He's like, well, you know, me and you.  Why don't we go into the bushes over here?  Oh, my God.  And my dad came flying across the hood of a truck that we were standing next to.  And just grabbed the guy and started just pounding his face.  Wow.  And then the rest of the guys were like, because obviously he was an uncle or cousin of somebody's.  He's like, Joey, Joey, Joey.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  He's like, this motherfucker.  And he's pounding.  And I'm there.  What was he going to do to me in the bushes? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Dad, you cock blocker.  Yeah, exactly.  I was this close to me in the bushes.  Yeah, but Dad didn't want him fucking tapping into his supply.  I love that all your dad's stories, he's always very close to the truck.  Yes, the truck is right there.  Well, how could you drunk drive if you don't have something to drive?  Right.  He's very close to the truck.  Obviously, your dad loved you, though.  Oh, he would not fucking.  Or he loved fighting or hated games.  Or he just didn't like that guy. 
[00:31:00]  There was a lot of options there.  Or he was very scared you were going to take the Mexican up on him.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He didn't want to wait in here if I said yes.  Right.  Not on my watch.  Right.  That's not exactly a good, inspiring tale of fatherly love.  You mean he didn't want you to get fucked in the mouth and the shrubs?  Dear old dad.  He rolled.  I had a lot of fun out there.  See, we got a lot of fucking Mexican stories.  And the party, by the way, at the stable, it was at Juan Reyes' stable. 
[00:31:30]  You might remember Juan Reyes.  His son was Charlie Reyes, who was shot in the Mojave Desert when we were all hanging out partying.  Right.  And had to be driven to Arizona from the Mojave Desert.  You saw his friend get shot.  Oh, it was amazing.  Yeah.  Wow.  By his father.  Wow.  We were all camping out at some mining shack out in the Mojave Desert.  And the father went to load his gun.  He had a .22.  And it was an old style one where you had to have it half cocked to spin the cylinder.  So he lifted it up before he put the hammer down on an empty cylinder. 
[00:32:00]  It was a live cylinder.  And the bullet went off.  Shot his 10-year-old son, Charlie, right through the shoulder.  It went right in, like, over his heart.  And then out the back.  And I was looking at Charlie right at the time.  And he just went, ah!  And it looked like a water fountain of blood pumped out.  And he just went down to his knees and then down to his face.  And I'm like, holy fuck, I just saw someone get shot.  Wow.  This is crazy.  And then they all packed him into a pickup truck.  And we were in between Barstow and Needles, Arizona somewhere. 
[00:32:30]  And, like, 50 miles off the main road.  We had doom buggies and guns and fucking whiskey.  It was crazy.  See, guns are bad, Ant.  See?  No, they were great.  Guns are bad.  See?  We used to take...  We were, like, again, 14 years old.  And we would take these doom buggies out and have two people in the back.  One driving and one in the passenger seat.  All with rifles.  And we're just shooting anything from moving doom buggies.  Yeah, it was like fucking Mad Max, the children's version. 
[00:33:00]  We'd shoot any poor living thing that came across us was dead.  Jesus.  I think I shot a lizard.  I never thought the taco show would turn into this.  Oh, this is all about, you know, Southern California and me hanging out with the Mexican people.  Yeah, it's where tacos come from.  Arizona was the Old Woman Mountains.  And it was a big old silver and turquoise mine with a little mining shack.  And we used to just camp there.  It was great.  That sounds awesome.  You guys want to go to Disneyland like everybody else?  Disneyland?  Disneyland, you can't drink in the Magic Kingdom? 
[00:33:30]  Are you crazy?  You can't let your friend Charlie get shot?  Right.  I'm going to see Charlie get shot in the Magic Kingdom?  It's a small world.  Fuck that.  What a disaster of a childhood.  Oh, it was fantastical.  It sounds fun.  It was magical.  Really.  It really sounds great.  When I think about it.  I finally came to my senses and was like, I got to go back home to my mom in New York  because this is going really poorly.  That's fun, but this is wrong.  It was, it was like fun, but even I, at that young age, realized, wow, I'm really headed 
[00:34:00]  down a weird road here.  I just pictured me driving the pickup truck with a fucking Budweiser between my legs, that  CB in my hand, with my little boy fucking tensed up with anxiety and palpitations.  Or some little boy.

[00:39:00]  Continues.  Here we go.  We continue on.  Worst of the week countdown.  A lot to come.  It's highlighting all the best moments that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  I'm Sam Roberts.  You hear me, whether you want to or not, every morning on the O&A show,  as well as the host of After Opie and Anthony Live.  Still to come.  A lot of great guests.  Mark Maron, Mike Tyson, Stephen Lynch, Anthony Bourdain.  We're going to be talking about the big channel change that's happening on this very channel  and how Opie and Anthony found out.  And take a wild guess whether management made the right move or not. 
[00:39:30]  But first, sometimes Opie and Anthony need to go home, right?  But there are giant guests booked.  So what are they going to do?  Well, they're going to go home.  Ben Kingsley was booked to do the show.  Sir Ben Kingsley.  You know him.  Gandhi searching for Bobby Fischer.  Now Iron Man 3 that came out this weekend.  He was coming in to do the show.  The reason that I want to play this clip for you is especially the very beginning of it.  The awkwardness.  Opie and Anthony are like, look, Ben Kingsley is coming in at 10 a.m. 
[00:40:00]  That's when our show ends.  We've got to get out of here.  Listen to the awkwardness as Ben Kingsley is right outside the studio before Opie and Anthony get a chance to sneak out.  And then enjoy the interview that Jim and me are left to do with Ben Kingsley on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number six.  Oh, my God.  See, this is exactly what happened. 
[00:40:30]  We were in a discussion about this not happening, actually.  No, because I really do have to leave.  Yeah, there was a discussion about this.  But now it's awkward.  He's not supposed to see the awkwardness of the whole thing.  Yeah.  I was waiting at my house.  Well, we've got to just jump into it.  We can't make him wait.  Oh, my God.  He's Sir Ben Kingsley.  Sir Ben Kingsley is outside our studio.  Now I've got to walk over there, and you guys have to leave in front of him.  Well, we're only supposed to cut him off at the past, so it doesn't look awkward.  That's all.  Yes.  Take him to a green room, but we don't have one. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Well, we've got Ben Kingsley coming in.  Yes, sir.  We've got to call him Sir Ben.  Sir Ben.  You've got to call him that?  Yeah, it's respect.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Can I look him in the eyes?  Yes.  When I walk past, oh, my God.  I've got to pack this up so it doesn't look like I'm packing up.  I'm packing up.  Oh, my God.  Sir Ben.  Sir Ben was in The Sopranos, if you remember.  Yes, he was.  Yeah.  There was a...  How are we going to do this?  I don't want to know.  All right, Sam.  Just run over there quick.  I don't want it to look awkward.  Oh, my God.  It's going to look awkward.  We'll do have to get home to a sick kid. 
[00:41:30]  It's going to look awkward.  Yeah, it is.  We set this up ahead of time.  Do you have the card, too, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  Hang on.  Oh, my God.  Very well.  Very well.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Sir Ben Kingsley.  Yes, let's see you.  Sir Ben, hello.  Thank you.  How are you?  A pleasure.  Lovely to see you.  I like wearing cans.  Is that okay?  Oh, yeah.  Of course, yeah.  Please do.  We're on the air.  A lot of guests don't like to wear them, so we just kind of leave them there as an option.  When you became...  I wanted to ask you, too.  Becoming Sir Ben, what is the process for that happening? 
[00:42:00]  Is it something they tell you is going to happen, and then it happens years later?  I had a letter from the Prime Minister's office maybe a month before it happened, and then  invited to the palace for the actual ceremony.  Had you known before that they were like...  Do you know what it is that they say, okay, well, we would like to make Ben Kingsley Sir  Ben Kingsley?  What happens before that?  You don't have any idea.  Oh, no.  It's a total surprise.  And in Britain, that's a tremendous honor. 
[00:42:30]  It is indeed, yeah.  Yeah, it's...  My citation was for my contribution to or my work in drama, so it was for a dramatic  actor.  Right.  But it's not something you can, like, work towards.  Like, you can't have that be a goal, necessarily.  You have no idea, you know.  If you just hit the national nerve somehow or the national psyche, then England, which  is not very openly enthusiastic like the states. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  It's quite guarded.  So the counterbalance of that rather guarded aspect to your work is balanced by, you know,  the Prime Minister and the palace saying, we've seen you, we like what you do very much,  which is great.  Once you're recognized that way, does that change the way you work?  Does that change the way you just pick what projects you're going to do?  I have always picked my projects based on my opening years in the theater. 
[00:43:30]  So I love good writing.  I always pick good writing.  I hope to always pick good writing.  So that national embrace doesn't really affect my process in as much as it's always been rooted  in another, a great Englishman called Shakespeare.  I'm not pretending to be a great Englishman.  But that was my starting point.  His work's so beautiful.  So is that considered, again, forgive my ignorance, is that considered being knighted or no?  Is that being a star is different than being knighted?  No, it's the same thing.  Oh, it is the same thing.  Okay. 
[00:44:00]  I was going to say congratulations on being knighted, but I figured it would be wrong  and I would look stupid.  Absolutely right.  Yeah.  You've been in some of my favorite films.  I mean, I think one that people, like everybody knows Schindler's List, but a lot of people  don't talk about Searching for Bobby Fischer, which is just, it's one of my, it's probably  my top 10 or 12 favorite movies.  That's very interesting because Josh, with whom I was this morning, said that's one of his  favorite films.  Josh Wayskin?  Yes.  You saw the real Josh Wayskin?  No, I'm sorry.  My interviewer this morning on a morning show said that as his child gets older, he's going 
[00:44:30]  to show his child a film because he said it's the greatest sports film he'd ever seen.  And that final battle between those two kids is extraordinary.  Yeah, and it's hard to make, because I love chess, it's really hard to make chess dramatic.  It's hard to build up, I mean, you know, Bobby Fischer pulled it off, but it's really hard  to make a movie where the climax is a chess match between two children. 
[00:45:00]  Well, you mentioned the link.  The link is that Stephen Zalian, who wrote and directed Searching for Bobby Fischer, went  on to write Schindler's List.  So, you know, that brings us back to writing.  And then when it's beautifully written on the page, it's a joy to act and a joy to bring  to life.  So when you, because I find acting to be so difficult, when you see a role, they send  you the script for Bobby Fischer.  And now do you say, I'm going to learn these lines before I do them? 
[00:45:30]  Or do you kind of like to just see them once?  Like I said, Brando would have like, you know, cue cards all over the place.  Or do you like to be completely off book and completely memorized?  I love to be completely off book, because then you have some understanding of the sweep  of the whole movie.  You have some understanding of, of the shading of every scene where it sits in the film,  because we don't always film in sequence, as you know.  So I love to learn the whole thing.  And, uh, do you, I would assume you must get very close to these characters that you 
[00:46:00]  play, uh, since you, since you do them so well, how long do they stay with you after  like, so, you know, like, when does Gandhi leave you?  Well, I'm, one of my tricks is to let go immediately.  The director says cut to let go totally so that the next time I do a take, it's a running  jump.  Again, I never liked to be, I never liked to have the elastic halfway stretched, right?  It goes right back to its original shape.  And then on action again, I, it's the same process. 
[00:46:30]  I'd go from almost from zero into the character.  So you're not one of these guys who's sitting there at lunch, still in character.  No, absolutely not.  No, I'm not.  I, I get back, I get back to me as often as I possibly can and as frequently as I can.  Then I hope that the result is that maybe the take is fresh every time rather than I'll  give you a copy of a copy of a copy, which is a bit downhill.  Everyone, everyone works differently, but I'm not, uh, I don't quite know what the word 
[00:47:00]  method actor means, but I'm not one.  I'm sure you've worked with some though over the years and is it, is it odd to talk to  a guy off, off, uh, well, you know, a cut and then again, you're having, you know, you're  having a burger together and he's talking in characters.  Christian Bale just remains Batman while he's on set.  And it's like, right.  Uh, well, as I say, you know, and I respect his work enormously that, that everyone has  their own, uh, their own method of working.  Uh, I do remember one method actor who shall remain nameless and, um, he was so keen on 
[00:47:30]  being in character before a scene, um, banging around and kicking furniture and yelling that  by the time he got on set, he was exhausted.  And by the time the director said action, he'd forgotten all these lines because he was so  wrapped up in the character while we weren't filming, which doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't matter.  Was his performance good or, or did it suffer like in, in the final product?  Like, cause Brando, like, you know, I've heard he would read dialogue while people, he would  have a tape to their face, which you're like, that's horrible.  But because it played the way Brando did it, you're like, wow, what a brilliant move. 
[00:48:00]  He was, I mean, his performances are absolutely magnificent.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  So whatever he did is okay.  Although you could see where it would be degrading to his co-star who has to sit there  like a prop with lines taped to his forehead.  Yeah, it's a little embarrassing.  Is there a party game where you stick a word to your head or, uh, that you don't know  what it is and you've got to guess the word that's stuck off to your head?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds like what, that's what I heard he would do to certain, uh, certain guys who  could get away with it.  So I guess it all depends on how the final product comes out, whether somebody was a 
[00:48:30]  genius or that they were just kind of irritated or irritating and eccentric.  Of course.  Of course.  And Brando was a genius.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So Iron Man 3, when you go into a summer blockbuster movie, you know going in, this  is what the goal is.  Is that very different from, uh, something like Bobby Fischer?  Not with this particular franchise because what's so beautiful and contagious about this  franchise and what everybody loves about it is that although, of course, it's called  Iron Man and it's about massively powerful exteriors, what they do explore is the vulnerable 
[00:49:00]  man inside and that's where Robert Downey Jr. is terrific.  He's vulnerable to friendship, he's vulnerable to comradeship, he's vulnerable to loss, he's  vulnerable to self-doubt, he's vulnerable to panic attacks, he's vulnerable to love because  he's in an intimate relationship with Pepper, who's magnificently played.  So, uh, I think that that sets, that style sets it in a, in a genre almost of its own. 
[00:49:30]  Therefore, brings me back to the writing, I just, I'm, I jump in just on the same level.  Is that more difficult to kind of humanize a character that's obviously, it could be so  silly?  Like, it's a superhero, but you have to relate it to an audience that's like, okay, I believe  this.  I think it's, I think it's a bit of a tight rope.  I think that it's all a question of taste and rhythm and how you construct the arc of  the character.  Uh, I think the way, uh, the way those moments are offered to the camera and the way it's 
[00:50:00]  edited, I think the rhythm of these films is beautiful because after every magnificent  action sequence that you have, it's immediately followed by a moment of vulnerability or tenderness  or absurdity.  But there's always that wonderful rhythm where they pull you, they pull the audience in with  magnificent action.  And then they, there's something beautiful happens, something very human happens.  It's very clever rhythm.  And did you want to see the script before you agreed to, to, to do the film or the writing  is so important to you? 
[00:50:30]  Uh, I was visited by Kevin Feige before I had the script and taught me through the arc  of the character in the film, which I, I loved what he had to say.  And then they sent me a script and then Shane Black welcomed me onto the set.  And I, I felt like a team player within seconds.  They're a very, very welcoming group of people to work with.  And what do you want?  Is this type of movie that you would watch?  What do you watch for your own entertainment?  I have watched all of this particular franchise, the, the, the Marvel franchise, and I absolutely 
[00:51:00]  love it.  You started to, I just, to jump back in your career a bit, because it's very interesting.  I read that, uh, Brian Epstein, uh, you know, the Beatles manager, uh, is kind of how you,  how you got started.  And, uh, can you just talk about that for a second?  Cause you don't hear many, many people with Beatles connections.  I, I was in a show, uh, a play on stage in London that was produced by Brian Epstein.  He backed it.  He put the money into it.  He was the producer. 
[00:51:30]  And my role in this play was a kind of musical chorus.  I would come on during the play and sing a song about what the hero was going through  and what he was about to go through.  It was a lovely device that, that kept the play running smoothly.  And Brian, of course, on the opening night, got two of his mates in, Ringo Starr and John  Lennon.  And, um, uh, I met them after the show.  Are those guys actors?  I've not heard of them.  I, I, I met them after the show and they were very sweet about my music. 
[00:52:00]  Um, and it was, you know, a total ripoff of their songs and Bob Dylan's, so a total  ripoff.  Just sang with an English accent.  That's all, you know, I got away with it.  And I then, I met Dick James, who was the recording manager of, of the, of the, of the  fab four at the time.  And he indeed, to my astonishment, offered me a recording contract and said that he would  like to mold me, mold, I would like to mold you, he said, I'm going to mold you, make 
[00:52:30]  you a rock star.  And I ran out of his office and became an actor.  Do you ever look back on that and say, wow, maybe I could have given that a shot?  You know what?  If I do have a musical ear, and I think I do, it's so much now absorbed into the tone  I use as an actor, the rhythm of the language I use as an act.  Sexy Beast is a kind of musical performance because it's entirely based on rhythm and tone.  And so I do use my musical ear in, in my, in my acting. 
[00:53:00]  So I don't really have any regrets.  I probably would be, you know, dead in a pool of drugs, blood and alcohol.  Yeah.  Had I become a rock star.  Yeah, you had to do something much more stable like acting.  Yeah, it's much more stable.  Well, they're telling us in our ear that you have to leave because you have promotion,  but you've already won a Grammy, you've won an Oscar.  I mean, it's not like you haven't done a tremendous amount.  And Sir Ben Kingsley, thank you.  It was tremendous to have you here.  Great pleasure.

And having fun.  I mean, they've been so awesomely.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, look, their standards and practices have come a long way. 
[00:58:30]  I got to say prolapsed butthole on CNN.  Nice.  Doing pretty strong.  Nice.  And, of course, the ATV footage was everywhere.  Yeah, that hurt.  What the?  Yeah, huh?  Bad luck on ATVs.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, what, your second run-in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.  Yeah.  I was watching, and I'm like, you're going really fast, first of all. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  And going through water and everything, which to me seems, you know, that's that unknown factor.  I've been out in the sun for like four hours to get these shots.  Wow.  And I'm cooking.  I mean, it's really hot.  The sun's coming down.  I'm dehydrated.  I'm drinking beer.  Where was this?  This was in a remote area of Colombia along the Venezuelan border.  And, yeah, I took a tight turn and went over, and, I mean, I just sort of drove my skull  right into the ground.  I mean, my crew tells me I ran over my head. 
[00:59:30]  I didn't, I wasn't awake for that.  But I remember I just felt so stupid that I was like, I've got to get up and appear  like nothing happened.  Right.  Because I really don't want to hear the I told you so's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the first thing people normally do is like, all right, let me get up and make  it seem like nothing happened.  Right.  I'll just, you know, ah, yeah, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.  And then meanwhile, you know, you're not fine.  Yeah, I'm fine.  You know, pardon me while I...  What was the injury?  What was the injury?  Was it a concussion?  I was out for a second, but, you know. 
[01:00:00]  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you got thrown.  I hate that feeling.  That just...  It's that fast, violent, you know, something's not right thing.  Not having control, right?  Not quite, you haven't quite figured it out yet.  Like, what am I doing here?  What happened?  I just went straight in and it was like a pile drive, like straight, but head first straight  into the ground.  Yeah.  If there were a comic book noise, it would have been something like a skronk.  Yeah.  Ozzy almost died doing that fucking...  I know, right?  ATVs are rough, man.  The first ATV accident I had...  Who gets to use that? 
[01:00:30]  It's that.  So the first...  I was on, I think, Jimmy Kimmel and I showed that clip and Ozzy was the other guest and  he's sitting next to me.  And after the show, he followed me around backstage for like 45 minutes, like this doddering  grandmother saying, Anthony, Anthony, don't do that again.  Anthony, you could have died.  I said, Anthony, come here.  And he's grabbing my hand and running it along his collarbone so I could feel all the  plates in there.  Oh, right.  On plates?  Yeah, he was personally horrified by this thing. 
[01:01:00]  And he just took it upon himself to bring me back to the light.  You know what the thing about ATVs are, too?  You get on.  You start riding.  And at first, you're kind of cautious.  You're feeling it out.  But in no time, you really think you have it down.  Yeah.  Like, because you start going a little faster.  You know, you get your balls and you're like, yeah, this is good.  And meanwhile, you haven't been riding the thing more than 20 minutes.  You've gone from, you know, very slow, just figuring it out, to now you're a pro, going 
[01:01:30]  off jumps, going through water, taking tight turns, sliding.  Yeah.  It's like, no, you're not good.  No.  This thing is overpowering you.  And then you got in the back of your head, you got to get some good footage for the TV  show.  Well, that, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was that.  Were you driving worse than you should have because you knew the camera was rolling?  Probably a little bit.  Compared to what?  I suck.  I mean, I shouldn't be on one.  Oh, man.  What other, any other catastrophes during the show? 
[01:02:00]  During that one, no.  You know, we have a Libya show coming up, which is the best thing I've ever done.  I mean, it was awesome.  And then I think since I saw you guys last, the Congo, which was the hardest show we've  ever done.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  What made the Congo hard?  There's probably an obvious answer there, but.  It's 29 different rebel groups.  Right.  And, you know, this shit goes wrong at every turn.  I mean, it's a country without really much infrastructure.  And the worst case scenario, like if things go wrong, like you're robbed or extorted or 
[01:02:30]  something, or you get a flat tire and you find yourself in the middle of booze.  I love a robbery and extortion is in the same category as a flat.  The worst case scenario is that the cops of the army come to help you out.  Oh, really?  Then let the real, then it gets really bad.  Why is that bad?  They're pretty good at, you know, rape and murder are pretty much, you know, the specialty.  For the cops in the military?  It's bad.  Really bad.  So if they come to help you, are you saying that?  It's the worst thing that could possibly be.  Jeez.  They're not going to help you.  They're professionals that will rob you. 
[01:03:00]  Look, a rebel dude wants to take your stuff.  If you could say, I mean, I guess you could say, fuck you, I'm not giving it to you, and  you could run.  Or you could, you know, maybe punch somebody and make a break for it.  I mean, not that that would be a good idea.  But when the, an official, I mean, the army have, they've stolen the diplomatic bag from  like the ambassador, I think the French ambassadors, I forget which one.  But I mean, they just don't have any problem with all of you.  You've given me that.  And if you fight back, you're, you know.  Now it's an official problem. 
[01:03:30]  You can put you in jail forever.  That's probably not a good jail either.  I bet a jail in the Congo.  Oh, my God.  I bet it's not, you can't really protest for better conditions.  It is probably, it is, natural resource-wise, it's the wealthiest country in Africa.  It's the size of all Western Europe.  It's beautiful.  It's a very, very, very, very complicated situation.  But it really was an adventure, and I got to say a privilege to see you. 
[01:04:00]  But how do you stay safe?  It's, look, it's dangerous.  Yeah, there's no guarantees, eh?  It's a place where the situation changes from minute to minute, where everything, you know,  you've just got to be really careful.  You don't carry arms.  You drive around in bands with TV written on the side and a big sign with an AK, like a  silhouette of an AK with a red circle.  Right, that you don't have any weapons.  We do not have any weapons.  So nothing to see here, folks.  Nothing particularly good to steal.  You don't travel with armed security. 
[01:04:30]  That just isn't going to happen.  Why is that?  Because it did...  There's 29 different official rebel groups.  Those are the ones with names.  And then these guys called Mai Mai, who are local defense forces.  You just make yourself a big, fat target if you're in any way armed.  I mean, you have security people.  You have local fixers who sort of, you know, the idea is to argue your way out of a situation,  finesse your way out of a situation.  There's a lot of...  You did have a fixer or you didn't? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you have to have Congolese who are looking after you who know, okay, this guy needs 10  minutes of FaceTime, a lot of handshakes, and maybe a fruit basket.  This guy's a problem.  Time to get in the van and, you know, get out of here.  Wow.  Like, who is the problem?  Would it be like a local chief or...  Local security, whoever the sinister local, you know, head of the internal security ministry  is, but...  A lot of ministries.  I don't like a place with ministries. 
[01:05:30]  What's weird, though, is even in the middle, we're up in what was essentially in the book,  the heart of darkness, you know, where Kurtz was, and we're about 100 clicks out of there,  middle of the jungle, no power anywhere, nothing resembling running water, five bars on a cell  phone, Fiji, Fiji, tweeting from the middle of the jungle.  Holy shit.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  We would love our friend Jonathan, right?  Oh, yeah.  My manager goes to...  He's never been in the Congo, but he goes to crazy, takes crazy trips. 
[01:06:00]  He's obsessed with travel, and he's got the same kind of view you do.  Like, he just wants to see these places, and he doesn't go in armed.  He doesn't, you know, he just...  But he took a tour of Africa recently, and, you know, just...  He said the driving was the worst part, because you get motion sick, because the roads are so fucking  twisted, and the infrastructure is just non-existent.  Yeah, you get to tenderize kidneys.  Oh, shit.  He didn't go where Anthony went, though.  He didn't go like that.  It was, like, an amazing, amazing experience.  And where'd you end up filming in the Congo? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, man, everything.  I mean, Goma, you know, we start out in Goma in the eastern Kivu, which is a very contentious  area, and then sort of centered on Conrad, Apocalypse Now, the Heart of Darkness, and  kind of took a look at the history of the Congo through the Congo River.  Wow.  It's a lot of history to try and discuss in a visual way, because most people look at the  Congo, and they just throw their hands up in the air.  They say, you know, it's too much, I can't, you know, how do you explain this in three 
[01:07:00]  minutes, much less 42 minutes?  So, you know, we try to do that in a visual way.  But, um...  Is it scary when you say that you have a handler, and, like, the guys are talking to the local  guy, and you don't know if they're being, you know, because other times in the language  barrier, you don't know if they're screaming at each other?  Is that just how these guys talk, or is there a problem?  You get used to that really quick, but there is, yeah, a lot of screaming and threats. 
[01:07:30]  Jesus.  That's called negotiation.  Sounds crazy.  Sounds exhausting.  You know, him, arrest him, you know, that sort of thing.  But your guy would say to you, like, all right, we can't fix this.  How did you know that you weren't going to be stopped when the guy goes, like, hey, this  guy's a problem?  Look, there were a lot of moments where this situation is bad, and these are our options.  You know, make a run for it, or, you know, land, or a river.  You know, but we had really, really great fixers who were just really good at going through 
[01:08:00]  the process, meaning there's a screaming, yelling, and threats process, then there's  a talk-em-down process, then there's, you know, we'll have some warm beer, and maybe  some money will be exchanged.  A little negotiating.  What were they mad about?  You came to, you talked to the mayor first.  You didn't come right to me first.  Oh, God.  The mayor got a fruit basket, and I'm putting him in jail.  You're, you know, you should have come to me first.  Wow.  Putting you in jail?  Well, where's the mayor?  It's like management here. 
[01:08:30]  You're generally the mayor going first, you know, and then I can guarantee your safety,  you know, which is not a good thing to hear.  No.  Is that a threat almost?  Because it's not just not guaranteeing your safety.  We're going to make it very difficult for you.  Yeah, we're going to do it ourselves.  I guarantee your safety is definitely not what you want to hear where we were.  So there's no right answer, obviously.  You're always pissing off somebody.  Yeah.  Also, you were in a situation where any state employee probably hasn't been paid anything 
[01:09:00]  in six months.  There were guys showing up at the train station and kissing on you.  I don't think it's been fully operational, if operational at all, since like early 60s  and only partially operational since the 70s.  Oh, my God.  Their whole staff shows up.  I mean, the whole train station is overrun.  The tracks are overrun.  Everything.  They show up every day and they do their job.  They try to keep the trains repaired with no money.  Guys who show up at this moldering library in the middle of the jungle, they show up hoping. 
[01:09:30]  They just show up to work.  They put on their jacket.  They tie.  They go in.  There's a library there?  And just...  We went to this like Belgian research center in the middle of the jungle.  It was pretty awesome.  Wow.  It was like really, really wild.  What's the library like?  Huge, like futurist, kind of, you know, Futurama style library complex that thousands of people 
[01:10:00]  used to work at out in the middle of the jungle.  It's been overgrown completely.  You see a lot of that.  I mean, you see the hotel where Bogart and Bacallst and Catherine Hepburn stayed during  the African Queen.  You know, it used to be a really beautiful, industrialized wonderland for white people.  Yeah.  You know, in the Congo.  I mean, the Congolese weren't allowed to walk their own streets.  But if you were a middle-class Belgian, you were living large in the Congo.  You had railways and modern buildings and infrastructure, sports club, you know, the pool, the health, 
[01:10:30]  you know, the golf courses, all of that.  And, you know, when they split the Belgians, they plugged the toilets with cement, scuttled  everything in sight.  And since they hadn't allowed anyone to, you know, go beyond, I think, like middle school,  you know, they left like eight qualified guys in the whole Congo to run a country.  What year did the Belgians leave?  Early 60s.  Why were they such pieces of shit about it?  Uh, man, they were not, uh, before the Belgians, the whole country was owned by King Leopold 
[01:11:00]  of Belgium.  And he basically, uh, killed half the population, uh, pushing them to collect rubber and ivory.  And if you didn't bring in your quota for rubber, um, by hand tapping it and extracting,  cut your arms off.  Jesus.  Their people were paid by the arm.  This was in the 20th century.  It's kind of like kicking over you at the sandcastle before you leave the beach. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  Not uncommon.  A lot of, a lot of guys in Africa, a lot of, I mean, it wasn't just the Belgians.  Also, to be fair, uh, the, the, the Congolese, as soon as they got independence, uh, you know,  made this mistake of, uh, democratically electing basically a communist.  Yeah.  Who we quickly had killed, okay, us and the British and, uh, the Belgians.  And, uh, so we were not too eager to see them succeed, particularly given the large uranium  deposits in the country, which we did not want to fall in the hands of the Russians. 
[01:12:00]  So, you know, it did not make us unhappy at that particular period of time that the country  was not working.  So without the colonialism there now and stuff, what is the issue now?  They're surrounded, uh, they're bristling with diamonds, gems, uh, natural resources,  uh, that everybody wants.  They've got neighbors like Rwanda with huge displaced, uh, uh, armies who've been kicked  out of Rwanda now running around in the Congo, um, because the last president, any president 
[01:12:30]  actually, they can't rely on their own army.  Anytime they have problems within the country, they make a lot, they basically rent out or  sell off their national resources to neighbors, uh, neighboring countries who send in armies  to ally with the current president, uh, and then hang around and make sure that they get  to keep stuff.  So there are all of these surrogate armies controlled by the neighbors as well as all  these little breakaway groups who one minute, you know, 10 minutes ago were working with 
[01:13:00]  the army and the national government and are now allied against them.  Have you ever thought like, what's the solution here?  What would be the solution to get a, a viable world, world accepted, uh, uh, country there?  It's so big.  That's the problem.  I mean, it's a thick, the size of all Western Europe.  Yeah.  Capital and most of it's jungle.  So it's really, really hard.  Um, look, they need a, they need a large functioning management class for sure. 
[01:13:30]  Uh, but you know, we can hardly pull that off in this country.  You said something back there that everything's being overgrown.  Yeah.  That must've been really cool to say.  It's, it's, it's hauntingly beautiful.  Right.  Uh, to see, you know, and the Bogart hotel where they stayed.  Yeah.  That's one of the places that's completely overgrown.  It's a squat now, but it was called the poor qua pa hotel.  And I'm reading Hepburn's memoir as I'm, you know, looking at it and, you know, did you 
[01:14:00]  go inside of it?  Yeah.  And it's just being overgrown.  Well, I mean, there's squatters living in it.  Wow.  Jeez.  And that library is not used for anything anymore, right?  There's, that's just.  Well, no, there are a few, you know, there are still a few, um, a few Congolese, uh, students  who were trying to make use of that research.  And, um, it's heartbreaking.  You know, people are trying, uh, but it's really, really tough.  That's a situation where you fight to live every day. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, has that given you a, like, how has it changed your perspective of the United States  at all?  When you see stuff like that and it's stuff that, I mean, only a small percentage of  people in America would even see that, uh, how has it changed your, your, you know,  if I hear somebody whining about writer's block, you know, I'm not too sympathetic.  Right.  Right.  When you see how hard people will work just to stay clean, you know, how, how, how, how 
[01:15:00]  hard they'll work to just to, you know, maintain their pride, clean clothes, clean body, you  know, that's, uh, uh, it's not what you expect.  Does it give you more patience here?  Do you, are you more patient with things or?  Yeah.  You, you, you, you're thinking that there, you know, when the ferry goes out and it's  another seven hour way to get across the river and that's every day.  Right.  Right.  You, you know, you think, you know, I'm never going to yell at a traffic light again.  Yeah.  The one minute that it's taking, God damn it. 
[01:15:30]  I missed the light.  Yeah.  So we, we've been mixing it, you know, I mean, look how easy I got it.  I mean, they're, okay, we're bitching about, okay, oh God, if I just, just one, one, one  toilet, you know, one, one good shower.  Right.  Right.  Um, you know, but that's for what, a week, 10 days, you know, I'll be in Spain, you know,  eating tapas and, you know, drinking red wine.  Have you taken a lot of shits outdoors?  Yeah.  We're professionals now.  We, uh, got it all figured out.  We're real good at, uh, you know, all of these things you never thought you'd have to learn. 
[01:16:00]  We've, we're getting real good at, yeah.  The, the alfresco dump, yes.  Do you ever think like I, I'm going to this place and, uh, I've, I've, I've overstepped  this time.  We made it, we made a mistake thinking we were going to be safe and we are simple.  I mean, I know you have a lot of scary moments, but has there been any times where you're like,  I really fucked up this time?  Me, no.  Uh, there were some, there were some days in Libya. 
[01:16:30]  There were some time because there was stuff going on around us.  I mean, it wasn't like, oh my God, we're going to die.  But this situation was getting worse every day.  And there was a lot of discussion whether to stay or go.  Like every day there were, there was an emergency meeting.  Okay.  This is the latest security briefing.  And our security guys were not, you know, when your security guys are saying, look, if  we'd known before what we know now, we wouldn't have come.  Great, man.  And so every day it was sort of like the whole crew had a vote. 
[01:17:00]  Or are we bugging out for the airport or are we going to try to hang on for another few  years?  How would you vote?  I, I voted to stay.  I mean, I felt pretty sick.  I'm not a heroic guy by a long shot, but I didn't see any immediate, it looked okay to  me.  The people around us were cool.  The Libyans were very cool with us.  Yeah.  Because there was stuff happening outside of our view that was, that was worrying.  We talked to, we have the vice guys in sometimes and, and, and, uh, and I love their documentaries 
[01:17:30]  and Shane was saying that that's the worst place of all the places.  The scariest was, was Juarez, Mexico.  Yeah.  Uh, would you go there?  Would you go to certain places in Mexico at this point?  Or, or do you think you might want to avoid that?  I don't know.  It would, it depends on what the, what the situation is.  I'm not looking to put, unlike them, I'm not looking to put my head up into a firing line  just for good TV and that's, I'm there for another reason and it, I'm willing to accept  a certain amount of risk if there's a really good story or something interesting there, 
[01:18:00]  but I'm not looking at, you know, Hey, look at me.  I'm in Juarez.  Right, right, right.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  I mean, I love, I love Mexico.  So, I mean, I'd love, if you tell me, if enough people tell me it'll be okay, we've been  with a lot of places where they say you shouldn't go that turn out to be really cool.  So, when you're, when you're in these places, like, uh, do you come back here and, and see  news from the Congo and from Libya and does it affect you more in that way? 
[01:18:30]  Do you have to carry this around with you now going, you know, not only feeling bad for  your own country and what's happening here, but now you gotta, you gotta have empathy for  like half the fucking globe.  I don't know.  You know, it's, it's, uh, it's weird.  You, you steal your heart to a lot of things.  That's what I assume.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  You, you, you have to, I mean, I've seen this happen with NGOs.  And people who work in environments like that, you know, just in order to get to work every  day without having a breakdown, constantly leaping, you, you, you inure yourself to certain 
[01:19:00]  things.  I get angry seeing really stupid coverage of places like Libya.  Um, you know, no clue.  You know, they're actually idiots out there saying, you know, we were better off with Gaddafi.  Oh, really?  You know, really?  Uh, it, it is a, people say this with authority, having never been to Libya, never having met  these kids.  The majority of people who overthrew you, they, they get their news sources, the most, you  know, cretinous, uh, you know, fringe, you know, under-informed conspiracy theory website. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they're pretty, you know, Gaddafi, and they're, and this is from both left and right,  you know, oh, Gaddafi was better.  No, no, he wasn't.  And the majority of the people who, who threw him out were people that you would like hanging  out with, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  They were cool.  They were kids who were, you know, playing like a PlayStation, you know, a week before  they, they went to war, uh, went home, you know, from Western universities to, to fight 
[01:20:00]  against the guy, I mean, you know, they fought Soviet tanks with handmade weapons built out  of like, uh, plastic and hair dryers.  So, yeah, I got a lot of, it, you know, it made, when I see really stupid, uh, uninformed  news coverage, it makes me a little cranky.  And, and, and much like, uh, soldiers and police officers and whatnot, and you don't have  to be specific, but were there, were there, was there some form of gallows humor a little  between you guys to just see some horrible things and, and in order to even deal with 
[01:20:30]  it, have to, you know, make a little, you know, you reach this, you reach this stupid  zone where, yes, you know, you reach this point, it's, it's like, uh, to cope, coping  when you just start, like, getting getally obsessed with getting getally raped, you know,  it's, it's, it's like everything, you know.  Look who laughs first, Jimmy.  Yes, yes.  I've never actually laughed thinking about it, but I always come. 
[01:21:00]  It, it is, it is, uh, you know, it's a, a constant remain, especially when you're sort  of, you know, when you're, you're really tired.  Yeah.  You've been running, going, going, going, you're stressed, you're scared, uh, you're reading,  you know, you're reading news reports of just, like, unbelievably awful shit.  Yes.  You make stupid, uh, and wildly inappropriate humor.  Right, right.  No doubt about it.  For more of the O.P. and Anthony Wars to the Week content, you need X.

[01:26:00]  The worst of the week countdown continues.  Sam Roberts, you know me from the Opie and Anthony show.  We're highlighting all the great moments that happened this week on the show.  Still to come, Mike Tyson and Marc Maron.  Separately, but both, were on the Opie and Anthony show.  But I wanted to talk about a great friend of the show that finally made his return after about three years this week.  And that's Mr. Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch, I mean, still to this day, songs that he originally performed on the show 10, 11, 12, 13 years ago are just as hilarious. 
[01:26:30]  He's been away from the business, it seems, for about three years.  He finally came back.  He's got a new album out, and he wanted to share it with all of you and his friends, the Opie and Anthony show.  So here he is performing some brand new songs for the first time in years.  Stephen Lynch on the worst of the week countdown.

You got all the mics on that.  No, I know.  Which ones are?  Moz.  You got six, seven, eight.  Six, seven, eight is what you're going to do.  I like how the mic stand hits the TV.  Stephen's got to squeeze in between the, oh, this place is fucking.  We can't even see him anymore.  He's behind the TV.  Yeah, he is.  It's the only spot available for him.  Can we set these guys up in the lobby?  Maybe you guys just play by the elevators. 
[01:27:30]  It's so embarrassing.  It really is.  We wanted to show Stephen Lynch, our old friend, that we're doing well.  Oh, well, we felt.  It's obvious we're not.  We felt miserably at that, didn't we?  We should have rented a bigger space today.  No, this is really our place now.  It's quaint.  Yeah, isn't it?  Oh, great quaint.  Cool.

[01:32:00]  oh yeah that's really sweet yeah your voice is amazing sweet thing that um is so wrong with the  lyrics yeah do you guys write serious songs too or do you only do comedy like you because you  could you make a living doing i have written a couple serious songs but they will probably  never see the light why not i would imagine i would have to you know bear my soul songs about  loving and losing people yeah yeah i'm sure you could do it and then listening to you would be 
[01:32:30]  it would sound awesome thanks well you know if that comedy well does indeed run dry again  like when i go back to dip and there's just mud at the bottom then you have to start you're gonna  see me you know grow big beer put your coffee shops put your life out there though oh god  that'd be terrible do a chris gaines was that his name all right yeah that's no egg gain  and singing in coffee houses on the weekend that's a great song man yeah comedy well ran dry 
[01:33:00]  fuck you no i think i think that's a great song i think i figured it out i know but i actually like  the songs on this record which is very unusual for me because i usually it's uh the cd is lion by  steven lynch of course that was tattoo where where do they get it your website where's yeah  steven lynch.com itunes amazon wherever how long has it been out came out in uh the end of november  okay so it's a few months yeah yeah you guys want to do another one should we yeah sure yeah 
[01:33:30]  all right let's do um that one do you steven do you write all of it or do you have help writing  let's do this one no no yeah it's just me sitting in my basement all by myself i'm getting a request  i'm getting a request for the night i laid you down oh the night i laid you down all right we can  do that one that's what we're doing oh that's what we're doing oh look at that wow wow i thought 
[01:34:00]  we're doing that one damn all right so this is a well i'll just play it you ready chuck  we were young maybe twenty 
[01:34:30]  you wore a white dressing gown  drinking wine and dancing slowly on the night i laid you down  and the moonlight revealed your body as the radio played some old phil collins song 
[01:35:00]  and we believed in something holy on the night i laid you down  we had love in our eyes we had passion in our souls we had passion in our souls there was fire 
[01:35:30]  in our kisses but it was not a phil collins song it might have been like mike and the mechanics don't know who that is yes you do he was the other guy in genesis 
[01:36:00]  i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure that it was phil collins no it wasn't on the night i laid you down 
[01:36:30]  anyway anyway anyway it doesn't matter doesn't matter we made love we made love until the dawn  two hearts beat  two hearts beating 
[01:37:00]  two hearts beating was all we heard  oh boy here we go besides that oh there was fucking no phil collins song  well i'm positive it was that song from the movie with the jam box  say anything that's the one who the hell mixes up peter gabriel with phil collins  well fuck you i guess i'm no expert no you're not  fucking 90s music 80s whatever on the night i laid you down 
[01:37:30]  on the night i laid you down  that's very tender  that's very tender  that's great  tender phil collins  you guys have very uh  nice voices together  i'd like to do a video and have him play the drums in the song 
[01:38:00]  oh yeah  anybody know phil collins  i never heard of him  he actually asked to do something for me and i i turned him down  like i don't care if you're drumming  i don't care if you're drumming  i think you could call in that favor  in the middle of your sweet vocals he could go  do do do do do do  exactly  keep it all  yeah if you just  right at the end  yeah yeah  do you have a version where you don't say fuck  because that could easily get regular radio play  oh  well i mean  we could probably figure it out  you know take the fuck out 
[01:38:30]  but i'm saying like that's a really good song  it really is  it sounds great  god damn  i don't know what can you say on the radio anymore  who knows  we met phil collins once  he was an asshole  he was  and i lost her  and i loved genesis growing up  and i finally get to meet the guy  and he was so annoyed that we wanted a picture  maybe he was having a bad day  he might have been going through  uh fucking divorce with no prenup  number seven  dummy  boy he loves getting fucked in court  oh jesus  he might have just heard  he might have just heard  peter gabriel's new record  that's why he was so angry 
[01:39:00]  is it good  no i have no idea  what a literal idiot i am  he's making a joke  and i stop  all the fun  while kidding aside  is that on itunes yet  god what an asshole  i should have interrupted the song  are you guys really a couple  you seem to have a good relationship  why fight over one song  exactly  i don't care  what's wrong with the love mickey more important  counseling might help  why rehash it all again to music  yeah

Continues  Starting towards the end  I hope you've been listening all the way 
[01:51:30]  With me, Sam Roberts  From the Opie and Anthony show  It's the worst of the week countdown  Highlighting all the great things that happened this week  Mike Tyson coming in  Mark Maron coming in  Those are both coming up  But first  Before we get to any of that  You want to talk about great things  How about this?  Opie and Anthony just lit into management  And I know they do this a lot  And I know that here on the countdown  We've highlighted it before  But this was one of the greatest of all time  Apparently this channel is changing  The Opie and Anthony channel that you know  Will no longer be on the channel that you're listening to 
[01:52:00]  Unless you're listening on Sirius  In which case it's already getting too complicated  Opie and Anthony found out that the channel was being changed  From a listener on Twitter  That's how this thing started  You won't like  Well, you'll like where it goes  Management didn't take a listen  Number three  This is going to cost some shit  But a listener told me  What the company is doing with us 
[01:52:30]  A listener  Yeah  A listener on Twitter  And I was like  That's funny  Yeah  There's no way a listener would know  Before me or Ann or Jim Norton  Right  Do you know that our channel is changing?  They're moving us?  I heard that  I found out ten minutes ago  They're moving us  I heard that too  From a listener  From a listener, right?  Yeah  What the fuck?  Because my point was this  Okay, you know  Having two kids and stuff 
[01:53:00]  I'm not completely in touch as much as I used to be  So I'm like  Alright, maybe they did tell me  And I was fucking dazed and confused  So I asked Ann  And now I'm finding out from Jimmy  You had no idea  No  Is it only here or in Canada?  So  I don't know  Who the hell knows?  That's a good question  Both  Both?  Okay  See, alright  These guys talk to us every fucking day about nonsense  Nothing  But they don't give us the big fucking news  Changing the channel number is a huge thing for a show 
[01:53:30]  First of all  I absolutely believe listeners go away  Because they just don't know where it is  Yeah  They tune in one day, we're not there and assume we're just gone  Because not everybody is a hardcore fan that knows if we're here or not here or something  Right  So they just think we're fucking gone and they don't fucking  You absolutely lose the casual listener  Right  You know, we deal with the hardcores  Yeah  Those are the fucking pain in the ass fucking people  Yeah  That listen every single minute of every single fucking show  Yeah  And then we'll bitch and complain  Right  That the last minute wasn't as good as the first minute 
[01:54:00]  Exactly  But you came back strong on the third minute  But the fourth minute was lacking something  Holy fuck, you're exhausting  But then there are other people that are kind of fans  But they'll never like call the show  They'll never tweet us  Yeah  They'll never go to a live event  But they're also fans  And then there's usually a third category  And that's the category you're talking about  Where it's casual listening  If they come upon us, they're like  Yeah, this is pretty good  I'm going to listen to these guys  But they don't give a fuck  They don't even know who's talking half the time  The channel number is set there in the morning  Right 
[01:54:30]  Because they listen to the show  But if we're not there  Eh  Right  And you're right  When you change channels  Or if you  Or in regular radio  When you went across the street  It was a nightmare to try to build an audience  Right  Because their habits were set  Yeah  A sitcom changes its day  You know, go  Oh, we're changing from Thursday to Tuesday nights  And we're  You know, they got to promote the fuck out of it  Right  Because people just go away  Right  But you assume  If this show is so powerful and hot  That just moving it doesn't fucking matter  But it does 
[01:55:00]  Like you're saying  It does fucking matter  Even in TV  Get the shit out of it  To make sure you know where  I don't know  Fucking  See, I don't like sitcom TV anymore  So big bang theory  Let's say  If they move that shit  It would be a big fucking deal  And a lot of promotion  And perhaps if they told us  We would have been able to, you know  Impart it to the listeners  Over the course of time  Since they knew we were going to do this  That we would have said like  Hey, by the way  We're going to be on channel  Blah, blah, blah  Well, wouldn't you start promoting that?  Yes!  Of course 
[01:55:30]  Wouldn't you like months ago go  Go go  Warning, warning  We could even be goofballs about it  Right  Say, Opie and Anthony are moving  We don't know where yet  But stay tuned  And we'll let you know  They never fucking told us  That the channel was changing  I still don't know what fucking channel we're going to  I don't know why  What's the upside of changing  And why do we have to change channels?  I don't know!  No one talks to us about something this important and this big  But they'll run into us after every show with nonsense 
[01:56:00]  Their stupid fucking minutiae of the hashtag fucking thing  That's what we hear about?  Their fuck cunt hashtag?  No, they're taking that very seriously  How about the channel number?  That's kind of important  Well, so I swear they didn't tell me  They didn't tell you  They didn't tell you  No  And Jimmy absolutely didn't know either  No  Okay, because I thought  I'm like, wow man, I'm fucking out of it  Isn't that great that listeners get to tell us the fucking  On Twitter?  On Twitter  So I laughed, I'm like, ha ha ha 
[01:56:30]  And then another tweet came in with the actual promotional material showing where we're going to be  Wait  Where are we going to be by the way?  So everything's been printed out!  I  Why wouldn't they tell us that?  Why wouldn't they tell us?  I don't know because we have shitty fucking people that oversee this channel  I can't wait till after the show today  When they come up with this great excuse and reason why they didn't tell us  That we'll have no responsibility put on them whatsoever  It wasn't their fault or problem or error or anything 
[01:57:00]  We weren't fucking told something as important as the channel number change  Um, well, you know, we had told this and this was that and we weren't sure  And uh, we uh  It just, it just, it's beyond me how much of pieces of shit we are treated like  So where are we going?  And why and how and who and what?  I'm scared to tell you now 
[01:57:30]  Where are we going?  Cause it's, it's related to  The wall  What?  It's related to the wall  Why? Because of they?  They have our new channel  Or our old channel, excuse me  The fucking entertainment show?  Not only will they not knock this wall down and make our studio bigger  Cause they, they took on this entertainment weekly channel  They took our channel?  Which is going to be a complete fucking bust by the way in the end  Uh, they would not remove the wall to give us a few extra feet 
[01:58:00]  We wanted the whole space  Oh shit  And then what Scott Greenstein said  Well we could give you, we could give you about eight feet  At that point I'm like great, we'll take anything at this point  And then they looked into it and uh, we learned that the wall will cost $500,000 to take down  Which is a fucking solid, sweet fucking house for just about anyone listening  I'm fuming  Um, they want to get some of our casual listeners to instantly give them some audience that they're just tuning in 
[01:58:30]  That's absolutely what they're doing  So, Entertainment Weekly, who has what we wanted, you know, more space  Will be, uh, on, did it start today? I don't even know  Will it start today? I don't even know  It does not start today  When does it start? I don't even know  I don't know what the official start date is  Well, all the promotional material has been changed  It's out there  All the program guides have been, have been changed  Are they going to be on the same channel on both platforms?  Uh, yeah  What?  Meaning  Going to be on XM 105, Sirius 105 
[01:59:00]  Why couldn't we have been there then?  This is a show, they've told us for years, we couldn't be on the same channel number  Because they don't  For years they told us  And now, there's a brand new thing, so it's not something that's been around for a while  That they are actually putting on the same channel on both platforms  They'll say it has something to do with the older units and the pay system  Oh, and the satellites and this and fu-  That's what the answer is  It's, well, see, but  You're a premium channel  But they're just fucking, they're just making it harder and harder to keep an audience 
[01:59:30]  I swear to you, I was telling you before the show  I finally have XM back in the house  Finally  Because I, I didn't want to deal with it anymore  Because our, we're, we're lucky enough to have VIP accounts because we work here  But they shut off our VIP accounts because they don't know if we're working here anymore, I guess  So then every, like  Maybe they can't find the channel  Every, what is it?  I don't even know  Every six to eight, six months, a year, I have no idea  All of a sudden the unit stops working  And you gotta go through this whole fucking thing to get it turned back on 
[02:00:00]  So, my, my thought was, fuck it  Even though I work here, fuck it  Fuck it  Fuck it  Because I, I'm from the school of thought  If it's not easy, I don't fucking want to deal with it  Period  That's how people, you know, think in this world  If you don't make it really easy for me, then you don't want to deal, right?  So, anyway, long story short though, after about three years  I finally got XM back in my house  I'm like, you know what, I work for the company  I might as well get XM in the house 
[02:00:30]  But I don't, I have an XM in the house and a serious unit in the car  And it confuses the fuck out of me  Not just because of our channel  Oh, that's right, we're on 206  We're on 105 on XM  It's music channels and everything else also changes  Do you fucking believe they're giving them 105 on both channels?  I mean, of course I believe it  Of course  So, where are we going?  To 103  103, and what's the other one we're on now?  Why couldn't they just give them 103 on both? 
[02:01:00]  Right!  Why, so we're 103 and what?  I don't know  I think still 206  But why, if they're making these changes, why can't they just do 103 for both of us?  For, uh, for us on both units?  We were told that you're still separate channels  Why?  Why?  We're supposedly a high-profile show for this place  Holy mother  But a brand new fucking channel starts up and they do it right 
[02:01:30]  There'll be 105 on both  This channel that you're listening to  Yep  Why are they doing this?  And why weren't we in on the conversation?  Not even in on the conversation  I found out through a listener!  We have our shit fuck meetings every once in a blue moon down the hall  Thank God it's only once in a blue moon  And, and the important things just fucking fly past us  I, I'm not, I'm not meeting with anybody anymore 
[02:02:00]  Why?  It's useless  It's fucking useless  If they're not telling us shit like this in these meetings  Then there's no need to go and fucking waste my fucking time  Sitting there listening to horse shit  And I know, I know the Radio Wizard gets really really bummed that we beat the shit out of him  But then, look, look what happens  Take it to fucking, uh, upstairs, kick it upstairs  I'm not listening to anyone  I'm not listening to Bladder  I'm not listening to fucking Radio Wizard or the other guy  I'm not listening to anyone anymore 
[02:02:30]  Anyone  Is Bob involved at all?  Here, here, here's my official statement  Don't approach me with anything anymore  I'm coming in at six  I'm leaving at ten  I'm doing the show  And don't approach me with meetings  Or fucking ideas or anything  I know what's best for me  In, in doing this show from six to ten  I know how to fucking do a radio show  Wait, us!  So, us!  I'm talking personally  Us though 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, but no, no, I mean, I mean if it's your  I'm just fucking with you  But like, like, as far as me personally goes  That's what I do  Anything else  Talk to other people about it  Because that's apparently what you do with the important things  I don't want to hear from them  At all  I just huff and puff and sigh every day after I leave here  I'm done  Because I'm like, what now?  I know how many times I've said, what now?  Yeah  That nonsense thing  So they fucked us  103 is the Spice channel 
[02:03:30]  What's the Spice channel?  Absolutely  It's like, uh, porno  Radio  It's like, uh, like Playboy radio, but dirtier  Oh, fuck  So why won't they take their channel and give them 103 across both?  Yeah  Spice channel?  And of course, uh, that, that bald dope down the hall won't even come on the air and discuss this  Oh, off the air  That could be one of ten people  Off the air, off the air we'll talk  No, we're not talking off air anymore  I'm so done  Explain to me, fucking, why this went down without us knowing 
[02:04:00]  What?  You gotta make it hurt, fuck it  What's serious 103?  What's serious 103?  Cause why couldn't they just give the entertainment thing 103, 103  And leave us where the fuck we were?  Radio  Radio sex  Oh, look out!  Look out!  You can't go on the internet and see fucking, uh, a horse fucking a woman in the asshole 
[02:04:30]  Wait, wait  Let's get the radio sex, woo  We've been involved with  Racy  We've been involved with serious for four years  I never knew there was a channel called radio sex  I didn't either  What kind of losers are jacking to that?  No one  No one  What the fuck's on radio sex?  They took over when they lost, the deal with Playboy radio went away  But who listens to that shit?  And by the way, they're allowed to do way more than we're allowed to do  So they didn't change that person's channel  No  This, this, uh, station  And give them at entertainment weekly 
[02:05:00]  103, 103  If they want  No, they're 105, 105  Why wouldn't they give them 103, 103 and leave us the fuck alone?  I don't know  And why weren't we even allowed to discuss this?  I don't know  Do you want me to tell you what they're gonna say?  What?  Sure  They're...  They would tell you that they're moving the channels around so that down more towards the  100s, where you are, 103 area, that's gonna be more male skewed  And then as you go higher  Two channels higher 
[02:05:30]  It's 105  They overthink the stupidest shit instead of just doing basic logical things  Like, before you start thinking of that shit  How about you get your shows on the same channel on both fucking companies?  That would be my number one, uh, thing I would do for this, this company if I was the CEO  But they don't...  Especially the high profile shows  High profile shows  Opie and Anthony  I, I know there's a new guy upstairs, I haven't met him yet  I hear he's really nice  Cause, uh, whatever  That's a long story  But, uh, my kid plays with a kid that's... 
[02:06:00]  Father works here  That...  He's...  Whatever  Uh, I hear he's a nice guy  But his first thing he should be doing is getting us on the exact same channel on both fucking units  Yes  And other shows, not just our show  And keeping us there  Not moving us around like fucking...  Like vagabonds  Part of me thinks they're just trying to...  They're still embarrassed of the show  Or they're slowly trying to push us out  Yeah  Cause now it's coming in on the phones  I don't even get Channel 103  Well, maybe they don't get it yet, but they will 
[02:06:30]  Why?  What's on 103 right now?  Radio Sex  No, we're not 103 on Sirius  Or is that XM?  See, I don't know!  Where are we?  I don't know!  What is 103...  Radio Sex is 103 on what?  Uh, Sirius?  It says it's a premium program though  Radio Sex  So wait, a premium program probably...  Here's what they'll say  Well, because it's a serious premium program  It's able to go across the same number channel on both platforms  But because you're an XM program 
[02:07:00]  It's got to do with the satellites and the older units  Why?  It's just utter shit  It's bullshit  Why after all these years are they keeping this so complicated?  They're lying to us  Not just for us, from a company standpoint  People don't want to think about shit  They don't want to have to think, where the fuck is my favorite fucking show?  You gotta make it as easy as possible for people  How many times does Shade have to change their channel number?  They've always been 45  Oh, how about Howard's channel? 
[02:07:30]  How many times has that changed?  Zero!  Zero!  Really?  Zero!  Wow, what about Jay Thomas?  What channels he's on?  What channels he's on?  He's on Indy  Yeah? How many times does that change?  It doesn't change often  Wait, how many times have we changed?  We've changed  Holy fuck!  This is our third  Third change!  The third fucking channel change  You pieces of cunt!  What?  What?  And Radio Sex is 103 on both platforms  What is going on on there?  103 on both platforms  Are they still embarrassed of the show?  We've proved ourselves years ago 
[02:08:00]  It's a premium channel, but it's 103 on both platforms  Well, they'll say, again, they'll say it's a premium channel  Here's what they'll say  It's a serious premium channel  Now, serious premium channels like Howard's can go across both platforms  But an XM based premium channel cannot go across  So put us on serious!  It's the same company!  It's the same company!  It's the same company!  So make us serious!  There!  That was the point Louie made recently  And we've also made  Like, who gives a fuck about the premium channels at this point? 
[02:08:30]  Take the fucking hit  Cause from a company standpoint  You're confusing the fuck out of your customers  Oh my God!  So take the hit  As much money as it brings in  That extra what?  Two dollars or whatever the fuck you have to do  To get us on serious!  Just get rid of all that shit  And make it as easy as possible!  Oh my God!  Make up the money some other way!  If it's the same company  And because we're on XM  We can't go on another channel  Because the premiums from XM don't translate to serious 
[02:09:00]  Then magically make us a serious show  And have us premium there  You're allowed to do that now  That the merger happened years ago  It's the same fucking company!  So just it's semantics at this point  Make us serious  How about giving us 103 on both platforms then?  Right!  I would take the move  At least that's something  Right!  If they gave us 103 on both platforms  Right!  I would take that move  What's 103 on serious?  Sex!  That's the radio sex  I thought we thought that was XM  It's both  It's across both platforms 
[02:09:30]  But they can't do that for us though  No!  Because we're XM  You own the company!  You could figure that out!  Of course they could!  You have to call the guys from serious  And go hey we want to make a little side deal  No!  You own XM and serious  So you could do whatever!  You could work this out!  Then again if they were going to do that for us  I'm naive  If they were going to give us 103 on both  They would just have given us 105 on both  So they're not going to do that  Right!  Of course they're not going to do that  We're 206 for whatever reason  We're the show that you could just change the channels around on 
[02:10:00]  Ah look at this  We need to get the Entertainment Weekly on the same channel on both  What are we going with?  Oh 105?  Oh who's there?  Oh yeah fuck them!  Let's just change their channel again  Who said it?  Why do they treat a brand new show that hasn't even proven themselves  They haven't even broadcasted yet way better than us  We thought you knew this was happening  No idea!  Of course you thought we knew  Why would you assume  Yeah I'm not  That management wouldn't have told us that our channel has changed 
[02:10:30]  It's not your responsibility  Of course it's not  It's not Travis's  It's not E-Rock's  It's not Sam's  Sal's just whatever  Holy shit  Yeah I mean nothing's his responsibility  I don't ever expect Sal to tell me something that I don't know already  He's not allowed to  There's something that we tell him he doesn't know yet  Yeah  Get it Sal  But why?  I mean Entertainment Weekly  They figured it out for them  They got them on both fucking channels  Yeah  They're not premium  Enough with this premium shit  Show me the numbers 
[02:11:00]  How much money are you bringing in  Cause we're a premium channel on Sirius  God did they just kick us and fucking treat us like shit  Yeah  But again cause there's no agent involved either  That's looking out for shit  He's fucking  I like the guy a lot  I love him  But he's an absentee guy  He's in LA  An absentee landlord  He is  He is  Oh my god  Now  Now  Now  Now 
[02:11:30]  I don't  I don't even want to fucking  Hear it  I don't want to hear the lies  That will come out of their fucking mouths  Trying to explain this shit  Is it lies?  Or incompetence  Blatant lying  Will come out of their mouths as to why they're doing this  And they'll have some convoluted vague explanation  Right  As to why this had to be done like  Try to word it in a way that makes it seem like  Oh you poor little retards can't understand  But believe me it's it's this is how it had to be 
[02:12:00]  I don't want to hear it  XM's so lost in that merger  Oh my god  Did we lose in that merger  If I see the retarded Lex Luthor walk down that fucking hall  I swear to god  I'm not saying a fucking word to him  How about the Montreal trip?  How's that coming for the festival?  That's going well right?  There's some meetings  We should know something  Maybe Friday maybe Monday  What's today?  We started May  Okay so two months beforehand 
[02:12:30]  That's enough time to prepare  Fair enough  And the bus tour  I'm sure you guys are having discussions about that right?  Enough  Let's just stop already  Let's stop already  Late fall  It's on the calendar for late fall  End of September  Nice  Yeah yeah  Six months after  It was supposed to happen  And Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny  Right sure sure  And the tooth fairy  And the bus trip  Sure  And then I mean if you really want to get into this  There's people calling bitching like crazy  This guy  James in Texas  When I bought my radio  I had to put  A new radio in 
[02:13:00]  And new electronics  To get you guys  Oh great  They gotta fucking  They gotta jury rig it  Why do some of these units  Don't have  Certain channels?  I don't get it  My dad pays for  You know SiriusXM  Right  In his car  Right  And he was adding online  And like you would think  That that would just be like  Two clicks right?  Oh it should be the easiest thing  Like on a website  Now I have online  He said it was  The phone calls  That he had to make 
[02:13:30]  Just to get  An online  Account  The customer service  Is an abomination  Well it was  It's an abomination  It was employee service  It was voted one of the most  Customer services  In the country right?  Yeah  Made a big fucking article recently  That we talked about  But at least it's good news for EW  Yeah good for them  I'm glad I got screamed at last week  For my rant  Screamed at  And uh  Cause people took it personally  When they shouldn't have  Cause it wasn't directed at them  Individually  Um  Yeah but they don't even understand  In the end it just makes 
[02:14:00]  Of course  Good radio  Yeah people liked it  That people were losing their shit over something  Oh I do tell  I wouldn't  Just yelled at because it was  The hashtag  Cause you know how Jimmy went off on the hashtag  And it made for really good radio  Yeah  He got yelled at  It was who?  Because they took it personally  Wait wait by them?  Yes  You didn't just laugh and walk away?  It wasn't even  What?  It wasn't even the hashtag  It was the idea  That uh  What bothered me wasn't the hashtag  It was the fact  It was the whole Cheadle thing  That he was  In the mind of Disney 
[02:14:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  And Rotten Tomatoes radio  Uh huh  Are on par  Cause we took Ben Kingsley  So we couldn't get Don Cheadle  They they were  Disney was giving us one of two  Cause they're splitting them up  Across the platform  So I said  The rage of that whole thing came  Uh with  If  If people on the outside  See this show  On par with Rotten Tomatoes radio  That is the fault of the company  We can't change that on the air  Because we don't get casual listeners anymore 
[02:15:00]  Like you know I used to get accidental people falling on you  Sure  We don't get that  We are I hate to say preaching to the converted  But that's what we're doing  We're talking to listeners who are already here  Uh huh  So the only way to change that perception  Is in the company's hands to change it  To change it  They refuse to do it  They never will do it  So the fact that that happened  The fact that Disney said to this  To Roland and to this show  You can't get Cheadle  Because you have Ben Kingsley already booked  And we're only giving you one of the two  Cause they're promoting the same movie 
[02:15:30]  The fact that we're looked at  As the same as Rotten Tomatoes radio  Is all you need to know about the way this company promotes the show  Uh huh  And it's never gonna change  So that was my whole point  But I they got mad at me  Blatter got mad at me  And it's like I like him personally  He knows that  It's like he just took it like I was fucking shitting on him  But it's like I really wasn't  Um  Who cares  I'm just saying that was you know  Oh I know but who cares  That's that's where it all uh  You know  But hashtags  But but but look at this 
[02:16:00]  The hashtag is working out well man  I'm I'm going through my Twitter right now  Yeah  That hashtag is  Oh that's right  No one's using it  And it's not even something we  We didn't ask for the hashtag right  Well it's also  No but we don't need it  But but it tells you a lot about what what goes on around here  A hashtag for the show and you put it on the pad  You put it on the pad  All right that's cool  Yeah  But it's called it just a throwaway  Right  But to them they had meetings and  And and and they  Oh my god yeah  They had like uh stuff printed out for me to look at 
[02:16:30]  Like well what do you think  It's going to look like this  But we can make it look like this  But we're not even sure we want to say Opie and Anthony  We're thinking maybe ONA  Or maybe Opie with that amber sand  Or whatever the fuck you call it  And Anthony  They had all different versions  And I'm like who cares  In the end it doesn't matter  It's just a throwaway  But I did say it has to be Opie and Anthony  Because a bunch of these idiots thought ONA was good enough  And I said no  ONA is what the hardcores know us as  But if you're trying to brand it  And get more people to fucking actually listen to the show 
[02:17:00]  You have to go with the full names  Which is Opie and Anthony  Hey that's what I said to him  Well that's good  Because they were arguing about the fact  Like a dumb hashtag  I'm stunned here at this point  And in the end it's nice  And it helps us a little bit  But it really is one of those throwaway things  I mean you know  Real issues is getting us a bigger fucking studio  Getting us on the same channel  On both Sirius and XM  Those are real issues that you could probably  You know  Help us out with  Which would really really help in the end 
[02:17:30]  It's never going to happen  And I think we have to accept that as a show  For real  Like I'm not being radio  It's never going to happen  They're never going to do it  Proof is this  It just looked like they were  They gave Entertainment Weekly  The priority  Over this show  Right  They're giving them what we want  Across both boards  Seems like it  They're not a premium channel for Sirius  Yes  So that's why it was easy to just do that for them  Yeah  But you own both companies  So it's easy to just put us on the exact same channel 
[02:18:00]  On both fucking units  Yep  You own the company  You don't have to fucking answer to anybody  You're the guy  Yep  Un-fucking-believable  You're the guy  Un-fucking-believable  Because there was a time I think through the merger  That they couldn't really fuck with too much of the programming at first  It was some weird fucking  I don't know  Thing that was part of the merger at first I think  But not anymore  They own both fucking companies  It's years later  Yeah  This is a just fucking 
[02:18:30]  Treat us like shit fucking moment right here  It's not  Treat us like shit  It's that we got the wrong guys overseeing the channel to begin with  Absolutely  And we have an agent that's been asleep at the wheel for a long fucking time  Absolutely  And uh  Yeah  Hmm  I uh  I don't even wanna fucking see them  I don't even wanna see them anymore  It's  It's  It's useless  I don't  I don't  I don't 
[02:19:00]  I really don't understand it  I mean at times they show that we're like  A very important show for the company  And then they  They don't even do the basic shit right  They just fucking  They have zero interest in furthering the show  That's all it is  Change the fucking channel number?  Imagine your fucking sitcom on a network and fucking  All of a sudden you come in and  Like you don't even know that they were changing your day to fucking  Thursday  To Tuesday 
[02:19:30]  Like you'd be like what?  It shows a complete lack of any respect for anybody in this room  I don't even think it's a respect thing  I think  I think you got guys that are so inexperienced  They don't even understand what this means in the end  The basics of management  Yes!  Like like  Yes!  That's a basic  Yes!  You tell the guys what's going on  I swear to you  I think it's more to do with inexperience  Well then don't come and fucking rag on us  Like you do have experience and knowledge about anything 
[02:20:00]  The second I get a fucking sideways look from one of those cocksuckers  I've had it  That's it  I don't even want to talk to them  I'm done  And if they get mad at me for not going to meetings  Then take it upstairs  Take it to a higher source  And I'll explain to them  Why I'm not going to a meeting  I'm sure they'd love to hear why  I'm not going in the same room  And hanging out in a little chat with you guys  If you want to fuck yourself like that  Then let me talk to someone upstairs  Because that would be  It wouldn't bode well for you 
[02:20:30]  It wouldn't look good for your side  As to why I don't want to meet with you  Because they'd go  What? Really? That's what they're doing?  Yeah!  Can you believe it?  Yeah, they have every right to move us to  Where are we going?  103 and 206  103 and 206  It's the whole double it  What channel are you on?  103  Where are you on?  I'm not serious  Double it!  That would be the whole thing  Just double it!  That's a great line  But I swear to you  That's probably their logic 
[02:21:00]  Right  In the end  That just might be their logic  Well, 103  Times 2  That's 206  Okay  To listen  That's what I like  When you need mathematics involved  And you're fucking listening to a show  Yeah  A lot of people saying  They don't get 103  Yet because  Are they going to get 103?  I'm sure they will  But I don't know  Because no one has talked to us about this  Here's what's going to happen  They're going to launch  With their big morning show  Over there at Entertainment Weekly  And there's going to be people  That just have us on  Like they do every morning 
[02:21:30]  And then there'll be a morning show  And they'll just be listening  Like what's this?  What's that?  And they won't change this  It's not that important to them  Nope  They get a built-in initial  Initial audience  They don't have  They don't have to start from zero  No  They get that built-in initial  Opie and Anthony fucking audience  Right  And we get  We get sex radio  They'll get a lot of  Our people just sampling  The new show  Right  The casual listeners especially  That don't care enough  To go  Whoa, wait, they're gone 
[02:22:00]  I gotta go find us  I bet that was calculated  If you think this is just for the air  I don't want to talk to them  Don't fucking bother coming down the hall  At the end of this program  To have a little meeting  I've had it with talking to them  You want me to talk to somebody?  I'll fucking talk to Scott  Or anyone above Scott  I'm done dealing with the minion  With the incompetent minion  Wait  That supposedly runs this fucking channel  Had it  Had it  The worst of the week

If it is, I'm sure he'll tell us  It's Mark Maron  Mark Maron  On the Worst of the Week Countdown  Number 2  Number 2  Number 2 
[02:28:30]  I want to say good morning to Mark Maron  Hello fellas  Mark  Who's in the middle of a very interesting story  I know  I would love to hear  The way I  One of the podcasts we put up yesterday  Was live from Vancouver  And the way it was recorded by some  Some idiot up there  I don't know  There was a problem with it  Like it only came out  Like it only worked  It won't work in Mon  No it only comes out  Whatever  I think  But the Vancouver show  It's got about  Margaret show  Did about  10-15 minute  One woman show on my dick 
[02:29:00]  To my face  Really?  Well you know  We had slept  We fucked once  Oh you did?  Once  Once  Yeah you know  It was like right before  I started seeing Jessica  The girl I'm with now  But you know  She came over  We did the podcast  We were like  This has been sort of  An elephant in the room  For 25 years  Really?  Yeah should we  Should we do this?  She's like yeah  Maybe we should  You know so it was that kind of thing  And it was good  You know it was it  You know it was like  Alright we got closure 
[02:29:30]  Was it awkward  Was it awkward going into it?  Like cause you were friends first  Was it awkward starting with the kissing  Or just kind of  I don't know  Is it ever  I mean I  I  I think it was  It was  You know it was a couple of sex  And I was getting some resolution  Is what it was  Okay  You know how that goes right?  It's like let's uh  Let's do it  Let's do it  And uh  Like it went pretty well  It was a little odd  You know when you  When you realize  You know somebody 25 years  Like hey  We're just a couple of middle aged people  Trying to get something back here 
[02:30:00]  And uh  But what  But wait wait  Was there ever  Ever an attraction  That was just building up over the years?  What happened was  Once years ago  When we were up in San Francisco  They did those uh  Comics come home specials  Sure  Yeah  We hosted the Cam Neely things  He produced them or whatever  And there was one year  Where I was literally just following her around  You know  I think I  I might have still been drinking  And I was just like  I'm gonna  I'm gonna fuck her 
[02:30:30]  This is gonna happen  You know when you got it in your head  It's not in their head at all  Right right  But you're gonna follow them around  Until they see it your way  Right  So I was just all night  Just like hey what's up  You know what are we doing  What are we you know  To the point where I  I think I followed her to her hotel room  Like I  We're gonna walk you back to your room  We're all in the same hotel  Yeah  And she uh  She opens the door  And I walk in with her  And she goes  She just looks at me  And she just kisses me on the mouth  Like you know  Big old you know  Tongues and everything 
[02:31:00]  And she goes  Is that what you needed?  Are we done?  Oh wow  And I'm like I  I guess so  Whoa  So like this is a long time coming  Is what I'm saying  This is about  But anyway so we do the show in Vancouver  I don't think  She's gonna bring that shit up  And uh  I'm like what do you wanna talk about  She's like I got this going on  And she's like maybe we shouldn't talk about it  And I'm like yeah probably not  I mean you know I got a girlfriend now  And everything  And we get out on stage  And right out of the gate  It's ten minutes  It wasn't a bad ten minutes  She was saying I had a big dick  Alright  That's not bad 
[02:31:30]  Right so what am I gonna do  Yeah please  Cause you're not  Stop talking about my big dick  Big dick  Right  I would assume Mark's packing  Cause he has big dick guy confidence  No  Really  Really  I think I got a fat one  You know I think it's a good  It's got some girth to it  It's not long  I don't have any problems with that  Well who would she have been fucking before him  That's really key  If she just came out of a fucking  Long term relationship  A woman  I have no idea  I have no idea  I have no idea  It was embarrassing though  Cause I don't really go 
[02:32:00]  I don't talk about this shit  Right right yeah  So there I am in a live situation  There's nothing you can do  And she's like oh my god  You know for ten minutes  And that's the last segment  You want an audio problem with  Yeah right  Where girls talk about how big your dick is  Right right  So the thing goes out yesterday  About yeah I don't know  Not a lot of people  There's some problem with the  And they're right  And they're saying there's a problem  Like oh the  My dick fucked up the internet  I can't wait to listen  I fixed it  Good good  It was embarrassing  But like again you're not gonna stop  So please  Please don't  Right right  She has 
[02:32:30]  I only met Margaret once  We don't know each other at all  Is she sexy?  When I met her she was really sexy  She was warming up the  Louie Anderson show or something  This is like late 90's  And she had really bigger tits than I thought  Yeah  She was sexy man yeah  And that was the only time I ever interacted with her  But I was like yeah I definitely see why people  Oh yeah she's definitely sexy  And you know she's uh  You know she's out there too  She's you know she's  Right  A little out there  Because she's one of those people  She's you know she's married  And I don't know  I think it  I  How it shifted  They had one of those relationships for a while  And then they don't 
[02:33:00]  Uh  I don't know how the fuck people do that  No no no  I can't imagine  Do you understand how people do that?  Open relationships  What does that even mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  When you come home and go  How was everything today?  Why fuck that lady at work?  Right, right, right  How was that?  Tell me about it  Did you get a picture with your phone?  I mean what do you do?  Yeah, there's a lot of people into that too  I mean they're totally cool with it  Have you seen swingers?  Not an attractive bunch by and large  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know how you live your life that way 
[02:33:30]  But  It just seems to like  Like then why be in the relationship at all?  I just don't know what the relationship is built on  Right, right  Right  If not built on complete jealousy and shallow sexual attraction  Right  Yeah, if you can't honestly go  Who are you fucking?  Right  You know, and with that mountain of anger  Yeah, yeah  Here's the bluff  I do like  I do like the fact that they feel there has to be certain rules set up  Right, right  So it's like, you're not allowed to fuck anyone between 6 and 7 p.m. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, yeah  Because they need some type of rules  Right, right  No coming in people  Right, right  No kissing  You've heard that over the years  Yeah, yeah  And only I jerk you off with the left hand  Right  Don't let any other girl jerk you off with the left hand  That's our special thing  Those are our boundaries  You have to  That's ridiculous  It is  It's stupid  Oh  I didn't make your book until  Yeah  I literally walked in  It was sitting on the desk  It's called Attempting Normal 
[02:34:30]  It's funny because when I wrote this book  I had  I thought  I thought about you  Jim  I'd see him at the cellar  He'd just be typing away  He'd say  I'm working on my book  And  But there's a chapter there  Like  I thought about you  And about being a comic  And about  You know  What you write about  And it's not  It's not a through line  They're essays  But they kind of  They're the full picture  And I literally  I literally have  Two experiences with prostitutes in my life 
[02:35:00]  That's it, two  And I'm like, you know  Jim would do this  Anybody  Like you would do a whole book on it  You know  Like I've got two  And I'm like  I gotta include those  Sure  Because that's what you know  People want from us  Right  And they're the saddest fucking hooker stories  The saddest  Why without giving  No, I  I sell a lot of books for you  It's like  The reason I put them in  Is like  It was  I'm not  I'm not a hooker guy  Never was 
[02:35:30]  Yeah  Like one time  I'm in Boston  I'm living in Boston  I'm actually living with a woman  Right  She's at the town  We lived down by Symphony Hall  Which is a shithole  There's just  There's the dirty  Horrible hookers there  And you could see them every day  And that's the weird thing  It's like you walk by them every day  I get up to park my car  To move my car  At 7 in the morning  And one of them would grab my dick  And say  You want a date?

[02:39:00]  I was coked up  It must have been  Who knows  I don't know  Fucking what year that was  87  88  Who knows  Cocaine is an awful drug  But it starts with a lot of great stories  Yeah  Because you know  Like first of all  Your dick doesn't work really  It takes a lot of effort on coke  Yeah  To get your dick to work  And many times in my life on coke  I have masturbated for hours  Just to try to come down  Sure  It's horrendous  But uh  It's been a long time  So I'm coked up  And I'm driving in downtown Boston 
[02:39:30]  The zone  Combat zone  Yeah  And it's one of those  Again I'm driving  I wasn't living with anybody then  But I'm driving  It's like 2.33  And it's late  And I'm driving  I'm like I got coke brain  And I'm like fuck it  I'm gonna do a hooker  And I think this was  Was this  It was after this  So this is the second time  I don't remember the order  But I see one  Same type of thing  On the street  I was pulling out  At that hour down there  And I pull  And I swear to god  She said this  I pull up  And I go hey  And she goes do you want a date 
[02:40:00]  And I'm like yeah yeah  She gets into my car  And she goes  I don't usually do this  I'm just in town  For my father's funeral  I swear to god  I swear to god  I swear to god  Oh my god  I'm just in town  For my father's funeral  Why would I make that up  Wow  And I'm like okay  Well I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Yeah I know  So then we  I go where we go  And she goes  Just pull over up here  And I'm like alright fine  So I pull over 
[02:40:30]  And she goes you know pull your pants on  So I pull my pants down  I pull my underwear down  She puts a rubber on my sad limp coke dick  Just tries to wedge it on there  And she starts blowing me  I can't do anything  I can't get it up  I'm in the middle of the street  I got a rubber on  I'm on coke  And within seconds  I'm surrounded by police cars  Oh shit  Like yeah  Lights  Cops  Action  And I'm like holy fuck  What do I do?  She goes I think you should pull your pants up 
[02:41:00]  And like I just pull my pants up  And she goes I'll take care of this  She gets out of the car  And starts some drama with the cops  She saved me  My boyfriend was gonna beat me up  And I'm like thank god  Turns into an opera  Wow what a trooper  Yeah good egg  And then a cop comes up to my car  And this is at a time where  They would list you in the paper  Right  Oh we were  Yeah  We used to read those  We used to  Oh on the air?  Yeah we were assholes  I think I regret that one  Right so there was something  You were dicks 
[02:41:30]  Sorry go ahead  Well no the cop goes  And he just looks at me  And he shines his light  He goes where do you live  I go Somerville  He goes why don't you go there  And I'm like I will go there  But I'm trying to get a blowjob officer  Right  You know  Fuck I paid for this  So I drive off like just sweating and freaked out  I realized that  You know I hadn't pulled my pants  I had pulled my pants up  But they weren't buttoned  I hadn't pulled my underwear up  So I looked down  And just my sad little dick  With the rubber hanging off  Is like sticking out  Like almost like  Why do you do this stuff? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  Look like  Let's not do this anymore  Oh shit  So those were the two  That's bad luck man  Second time  Second time  That's telling you something  No I'm done  Yeah  Fuck  But in the car on the street  Seems like it would be a little fuck  That's how it always was  Another $30  It was a $30 situation  Wouldn't that be extremely nerve wracking?  Yeah  That's before the internet  You didn't bring these girls home from the street  You couldn't go on Craigslist  Man  You know it's dirty business  And it felt dirty  Even that none of them 
[02:42:30]  Well the first one went all the way  It was not for me  That was not for me  A lump in the tit  And fucking  And my father's funeral  And the police  Yeah  Those are two fucking great ones  Yeah  Yeah  And they're in the book  They're in the book  Yeah  That's a tribute to you  Attempting normal  I don't know that I would've put them in  If I'm like well Jim would put this in  Yeah  If I didn't put them in  I would've fucking released the leaflets  I had nothing else to talk about  I'm a fucking flyer  I swear  I just got the book too  And I just opened it up  And I opened it up to the chapter  I swear I didn't set this up 
[02:43:00]  I almost died  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Number one  Oh there were a few times you almost died  Yeah I should qualify that  In my mind  I almost died  So these are not menacing  I almost died  Number one  Cleveland  Yes that's the airplane one  Yeah yeah yeah  That's when I'm pretty sure  I almost died on an airplane  Then there was another chapter in there  Where I'm pretty sure I almost died  From the spicy chicken  In Nashville  Spicy chicken  I almost died from mouth cancer  That I thought I had  You know so they're not 
[02:43:30]  Menacing stories  These are not you know stories  Sure  Are you normally a hypochondriac  No I don't  No  Well who is it  Well I used to be bad  Because I can't believe I've never told you that story  Have you never told you a story about how I cured the hypochondriac  No  I'm not sure  My dad you know was a doctor  So you know as a kid whose dad's a doctor  There's part of your brain  Where you know in order to get his attention I think  I was sort of like I'm sick  Oh there you go  Right  Because he's busy  But if you're sick he's like  Well let me have a look at you 
[02:44:00]  No yeah  Like I was a sophomore in college  And I had decided that I had  What was it originally  MS  I was pretty sure I had MS  Right  So I start calling my father  Like dad I got MS  He's like well you don't have MS  I'm like no I'm pretty sure I got MS  He goes what are your symptoms  I don't know  Hands are tingling  I don't fucking know  He's like you don't have fucking MS  I'm like alright  I think I do  But alright  Goodbye  I love you  So I do that for about a week  And he doesn't bite 
[02:44:30]  And then like I start with like  I'm pretty sure I got prostate cancer  So I gotta eat  Why would you  Well I don't know  My hands are tingling something  Hands are tingling again  He says I don't think you have prostate cancer  So I pester him for like a week  So I pester him for like a week  And then I go home for Christmas break  After pestering him like almost every night  With the prostate cancer thing  And I get to the airport in Albuquerque  Where I grew up  It's like 7 at night  He goes  I go where are we going  He goes we're not going home  He goes no I'm taking you over to Bob's house 
[02:45:00]  And we're gonna  He's gonna examine you  This is his friend who's a urologist  Because he's a doctor  They all know each other  So Bob the urologist  Is gonna examine me  And we're driving from the airport  My father drives to this guy's house  Jesus  Right  Knocks on the guy's door  And the guy's getting up from dinner  I see he's wiping his face  His family  He's at the table  And my father's like  Hey Bob my kid thinks he has prostate cancer  Can you take a look at him?  What are they gonna do?  Yeah  And he goes alright 
[02:45:30]  Come on in  So now you know Bob walks me and my father  Back to Bob's bedroom  And I'm like what's gonna happen here?  And thank God Bob you know got hold of himself  And you know I'm standing there with these two men  And he's like you know maybe he should come into the office  I'm like yeah maybe I should go into the office  So he doesn't you know finger bang me in his bedroom inappropriately  So the next day or the day after I go to Bob's office  And the prostate thing that's a it's a gnarly examination  Especially when they want to really check it 
[02:46:00]  Because they got to put their finger in your ass  Press on it  And then you got to milk some liquid out of the tip of your dick  And put it on a slide  So they can look at it  Jesus  Yeah there you go  Good morning  Oof  So it turns out I got some sort of prostatitis  Which is stress related  Genetic whatever the fuck it is  It's a it's a thing  So I got something  Which as a hypochondriac you're like  Huh?  There you go  Right  So he gives me antibiotics for this thing  And I take them for like a week or ten days  And then I still feel it  Right? 
[02:46:30]  So I go back to Bob  He does it again  And he does the whole thing  And he says it's gone  You don't you don't have anything  All right  I thought I felt something  Okay  So I go back home  And uh  And then like before I go back to school  I see something on my dick  So I'm pretty sure it's herpes right?  Jesus  So  But you know it turned  I think it was just I jerked off too hard  Cause I wasn't even fucking really then  Yeah  So I see something  So I go to Bob  Yeah I call Bob's office  He goes you know what?  Meet me at the hospital  So this is like 
[02:47:00]  So I meet him at the hospital  He takes you know  He takes me into a room  He takes my dick out  He swabs this jerk off sore  You know and he tests  He says you don't have herpes  And like three days  Before I go back to school  I'm like I don't know  I'm pretty sure that it's herpes or something  And I go back  This is the fourth time  Holy shit  The fourth time  So I go back to Bob Rosen  And I walk in  And I'm standing there  I got my pants down  You know he's you know  Sitting in a chair  I'm standing up  He's holding my dick  And he looks at it 
[02:47:30]  And he goes  There's nothing wrong with you  Do you like coming here?  That was the end of it  That was the end of it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Between holding your dick  And shoving his finger in your ass  And milking your prostate  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Maybe I do like coming here  That would be something  The guy would think  Like Jesus Christ this guy  That's funny  That was the end of the hypochondriacal episodes  Yeah  The worst of the week countdown 
[02:48:00]  You made it to number one  On the worst of the week countdown  We've been highlighting all the greatest moments that happened this week  On the Opie and Anthony show  And if you just started listening  Then the you made it  Doesn't apply to you  So what I want you to do is  Sit by your radio  And wait for the replay of this show to start  And then you can be on board with the rest of us  We're at number one  My name's Sam Roberts  You can get me on Twitter  At NotSam  I just posted a video of my cat falling off a printer  How is that not tantalizing?  Mike Tyson 
[02:48:30]  The baddest man on the planet  Made his return to the Opie and Anthony show this week  Not only that  He said he loves the show  How lucky am I to work for a show that Mike Tyson loves?  I feel pretty right now  I hope you do too  Listen to Mike Tyson  Sit down and talk to his friends  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton  Here  Number one  On the worst of the week counting  Number one 
[02:49:00]  Mike Tyson  Iron Mike  What's up Mike?  There he is  Take a seat  What's happening in the news today?  There's all kinds of shit going on, right?  Oh God, I'm going for it today  What happened today?  Pagan love God  Yeah, this guy is  I guess he was a politician or something  And he's shacking up with his 23-year-old interns  Yeah  I'm wrong with that, right? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, that's the one that I think he was having sex with  And that's the one that they say he might be having sex with now  Listen, listen, this is good stuff, man  I don't know why it's bad  And I know your guys say Mike Tyson shouldn't be one commenting on this stuff  But he should tell his wife, I don't want to be married to you no more  And I want to be married to my young intern  Who's old enough to be my youngest daughter  But still I love her  Yes, exactly  You know, if that was an older broad with a younger guy  They'd be like, oh, she's into the, you know  With the boy toys and everything 
[02:50:00]  And that would be, you know, acceptable  But now that guy's a pig  We should arrest him  Right, right  We should arrest him because he doesn't like being with his wife that has menopause anymore  Right  We should arrest him  He wants that nice supple ass  Yes, something small  And tiny  And petite  And nothing that goes all around like a big blubber  Like you ever see the balloon, the big bubble  The boom  You make the bubble go  And it shake  That's a big whale  The big soap bubble  And it just, it's going in every direction 
[02:50:30]  You don't know where it's going to end up  Don't you eat those big, sloppy, big doe ass  Yes  You have to put it on your head  It goes over your leg  It's terrible  What the heck  Looks like she's been  It looks like she's been sitting naked in a gravel driveway  When she stands  Travel off  It's bad stuff  That's terrible  Bad stuff  Exactly  I never, I never was into big fat people  Like I, you know  I've done my shit  There are really awful ones  Oh no, my, my, my, my criteria is just breathing  You know  I'm complaining now  I'm just talking about the issue 
[02:51:00]  You know  I'm not complaining about me being with her  But I'm just talking about the issue  Well you have to know what you're talking about  So when you talk about a big fat ass  Yes, yes  You know  Because you've been there at some point  Big fat  Miserable  Ass that you can't form into anything  Just rock  Right, right  And she didn't have pants that'd be at their knees  Yeah, yeah  I can't believe Tyson did some pigging  Yeah  You gotta do some pigging stuff  Yeah, do some pigging  In order to know the real God  You have to deal with some pigging  There you go 
[02:51:30]  I guess so  To appreciate, as they say  To appreciate the rainbow  You have to experience the rain  Oh no doubt about that  And I've known what it's like  To be with devil worshippers  So I understand  Say that too  It's all about orgies and blood  And you know  It's good stuff  If you're in that spiritual direction  Of course  Of course  Isn't it funny how mad people get at this  Like instead of acknowledging  That every man would want to do this  We kind of allow these politicians  To be thrown  Even if he's a good politician  No, because  But when you're a politician  See, that's why Obama  Obama used to hit the nail home 
[02:52:00]  Once  Because he's there  I've used cocaine  See, all those other guys  Never had the balls  I've used cocaine  It's cool  I've used cocaine  And now  Look what I've accomplished  No, not everybody  I'm the exception  I'm not the rule  I'm the exception  I could use cocaine  During the college year  The best year  That my functioning brain  And still succeed  Yeah  So you had agrees with that  That's a big Obama guy  Oh, who is it?  So listen, but  That's what we did  You can't bring up  Nothing from the past  That's like me  No past  Right  This is it 
[02:52:30]  It's where I ended up  You know  That's right  Everything else is just the road  To get to where you are right now  No doubt about it  You have to get to that road  I just think  You know what I mean?  I just think that was one of the biggest things  That ever happened  A lot of bumps  You know, you came up  And it's flat  And we armed  This is what it is  This is what we're dealing with  Yeah  Alright  And still we're going to make this  The best country in the history  Of this millennium  Mikey  I gotta say  I went and saw the show last night  Why, thank you  Holy fuck  I loved it  I was bummed at the end of it  I hate sitting through anything 
[02:53:00]  Why, you have to have patience  I love you  I have  This is my favorite show  Oh dear  It was an hour and 40 minutes  Of you talking  Bob Backlund  Bob Backlund  You see that?  Bob Backlund  He beat the Iron Sheik  Yes  Bob Backlund  He beat Hulk Hogan too  But now I humble him  I humble him  I put in camel clutch  And fuck his ass  Yeah  I love the Sheik now  I used the Iron  No, I stood Iron Sheik not long ago  Yeah  He's used to the show  He's batshit crazy now  He put his pants on our show one time 
[02:53:30]  He was sitting back there  And I was taking a shot  He was drinking beer  And you could see the spot in his pants  Getting bigger and bigger  He literally had to go  He literally put his pants on the air  He just had to go  He was drinking a little beer  It's the worst slash greatest thing  I've ever seen in my life  Was him pissing his pants on our show  But he would badmouth everybody  And it's hilarious  Hulk Hogan  He's a fucker  I will fuck him in ass  You're just cracking up like  This guy's out of his fucking mind  But it's good  He's out of his mind  But it's good  It's hilarious  It's very good stuff 
[02:54:00]  It's hilarious  It's good stuff  But they're saying he's mellowed now  That he's not like into that anymore  He's kind of calmed down  He's not doing  He's just copmer now  His Twitter's hilarious  I think he used to do that to you  Because I was with Howard Stern  And you know Howard Stern  He's you know  He could be crazy  Irritant sometimes  Yeah  He's very nice and polite  Over the years before I did the show  I said well I could do the show now  Because Howard Stern  That was not the old house  He's very polite now  Well you know  He cares about children  He has  The wife 
[02:54:30]  The dogs  Everything  He's very mellowed out now  He's not as radically  Cut the throw a little bit  It's going good for him  Yeah  Yeah  That'll do  So it's probably a better time to do it  Than 10 or 12 years ago  We're talking disgusting things  Yeah  So Mike  Tell me who you're banging  My wife  Would you ever notice too  When you were doing interviews  How guys would talk to you 
[02:55:00]  In a way  Because there's this whole thing  Of boxer and interviewer  Where they never would have spoken  To you that way  If you had met them  In real life  Like taking liberties  That they never should have taken  Well that's just  Part of the business  You know  I might take liberties too  You know  Yeah that's true  I was always amazed  At people who would do that  Like the only thing  Separating you  From a fucking beating  Is the two microphones  Well  Right  You're a hostile young man  Like last night  Listen  Last night  Even I could see  Different in the pictures 
[02:55:30]  And he's down  I could see  We're taking pictures  Everything's great  But he still have to  Don't fuck with me  Look on his face  I'm like  I'll put my head  On his head  Listen up  That's right baby  But he's right there  See that way  Always in these events  Come take pictures  Got the still  Don't fuck with me  What  He's so obsessive  About his picture  He's got his picture  He's like  Focused  On just getting pictures  Well you know what it is  It was Mike  In LaMotta  And I'm like  What are you  Serious too  Yes he's not  And he won  I'm talking to him  He's coherent  He's sharp 
[02:56:00]  That's amazing  You know  Good for him  He fought everybody  You know  The motto  Because you told me  This story  Um  Jake LaMotta  You know  Back in the 50's  You know  They had the mob  And they set you  To fight up  And he's just  A big tough  Some monster  It's black  You want to fight him  No I don't want to fight  You want to fight him  And then  You go to Jake LaMotta  Hey Jake  Who you want to fight  And Jake goes like this  This is so classic  And people don't know  About it  Jake goes like this  I want to fight  Anybody  They don't want to fight  You know  Just like that 
[02:56:30]  I want to fight  Whoever they don't want to fight  What a hard-headed  Motherfucker man  Hard heart  Yeah  Yeah  I was watching footage of him last night  After the show  I went home  Was watching Sugar Ray Robinson  And uh  And LaMotta fight  What a fight  They just  The amount of punches  Six fights  That's six fights  Amazing right  That's the last fight you saw  That's six of them  Six  That's unbelievable  That's crazy  Three weeks apart  At one point  Oh wait  You did it  Come on  Three weeks apart  Listen um  That's how they were used  Fighters were used like animals 
[02:57:00]  Back then  That's crazy  Two-way bears  And every fight  Was a war  Every fight  They had to go to the hospital  But it's three weeks later  Jesus  Oh my god  You're still feeling that last fight  Three weeks later right  You know  This is what I know about fighters  At least this is what I know about myself  I read books about fighters  And a lot of them are so scared  But they're afraid  To tell people they're afraid  Wow  That's how they handle their fear  They're afraid  They're never telling anybody  They're afraid  Yeah  They're cowards  And you know  And they still become great fighters 
[02:57:30]  And it's not like now  We're going to go to a psychiatrist  Well I feel like this  I feel like a coward  I feel like this guy's going to kill me  I just don't feel safe  But you can't do that now  You got to give me some medicine  It's going to be your right  But now you just got to deal  Oh this guy's going to kill me  Back then you had to just figure out  What the hell  You would do with yourself  You know  I attacked them  And all those great entertainers  With crazy  Those guys had mental illness  They just did not diagnose  Diagnosed those guys back then  Yeah  Were you ever afraid  Someone was going to see it in your eyes  When you were doing this 
[02:58:00]  Stared out  Like I'm scared  And this guy is going to know  By looking at me  That I'm feeling fear right now  No  Because  I was  The only thing different about me  And the other fighters I fought  Is that I understood my feelings  I understand  When I felt fear  I understand  That didn't mean  That I was going to be a loser  That meant  That I was preparing me  To be better  To excel  To  You know  My highest potential  You were able to turn it into  Some potential  I'm going to be told  You have to go  I just want to get rid of that  No

[03:05:00]  Hey  How are you?  I'm sorry  I thought I was waiting  For a camera or something  No this is audio only  We're going to do camera  At the end  I'm so sorry  I don't know how this world works  What are the odds  Jerry O'Connell  Would lead the podcast off  By saying sorry  I'm going to say  One and one  I say that's  Pick'em in Vegas  Alright  So what credit  Are you most recognized  For when people see you  Out in the street  Is it Crossing Jordan?  No it really depends  I can tell by  I don't like to generalize  And stereotype  But I can 
[03:05:30]  It's  It's a  I can pick  What they're going to  When a black guy  Comes up to you  You're like  Oh here comes  Kangaroo Jack  Well I don't see rates  So I was talking  More ages  What about NASCAR?  NASCAR  They might  They might see me  As someone who played  Frank Cushman  In Jerry Maguire  The guy from Texas  I got Cush Lash  Right  How exciting was that  When we were in that  Jay?  Bro I was so  Sad  Because we knew each other 
[03:06:00]  Before Jerry Maguire  I was going to talk  About Camp Wilder  A lot  And it didn't dawn on me  Until you just said  That we were in  Jerry Maguire together  That's right  I read for your part first  Did you know that?  I read for your part first  Did you know that?  I did not know that  So you read to be Bob Sugar  I read to be Bob Sugar  I had some ad-libs set up  Based on my agent at the time  And  I mean I'll tell you  The whole story  Jay  I 
[03:06:30]  I  I  I went  And met with  Cameron Crowe  Our director  I met with  A lot of other people  James Brooks  Richard Sakai  I met with  I met with all the bosses  And I met  It came down to  One of the final auditions  And I was  Asked  My height  And I was asked to  Stand up straight  And  You know  Show a profile  And  This is to be Bob Sugar?  This is to be Bob Sugar 
[03:07:00]  The agent  I had read for that  And I  They had actually  Flown me out to Los Angeles  I was still in New York  Living with my parents  As you remember  And my grandfather  And our dog  And  And  I  His name was Blackie  He's in  He's in  Doggy  He's in  Doggy  Heaven now  Jay  But  I was asked  So I read for  I read for  Your role  I was asked to  Stand up  And give my height  I was asked to leave 
[03:07:30]  And I was walking out  Waiting for my rental car  At the valet  And I was depressed  I was like  I can't believe I came this far  This is going to be my big break  And then an assistant  Came out and got me  And said  Would you be willing to read  These sides  For the quarterback  Frank Cushman  And I just knew  It wasn't said  It was unspoken  But I just knew  That my height  You know  I am 6'2  And in Los Angeles  In Hollywood  That's like being 6'7  You know  I mean  It just is  What's Tom 
[03:08:00]  5'8  5'9  Around  I don't know  I would guess 5'8  I don't know any number  I don't see race  I don't see numbers  You know  I don't know any  I don't know  I'm sure there's a website  You should just run for president  I'm sure you can find it  On the internet  There's no reason  I'm going to guess  Having worked with him  And having a spine  That he's  I'm going to guess  Tom Cruise  5'8  I think that's fair to say  Pacino  Probably 5'7  I mean  These are all  Who's taller  Tom Cruise 
[03:08:30]  Or Jill Hennessy  Jill Hennessy  For those who don't know  Was the star of a show  That I did  Called Crossing Jordan  For many years  And I  I don't know  It also depends  On what they're wearing  A lot of time  Heels are involved  Who drinks more  Jill Hennessy  On a weekend  Or Tom Cruise  In his entire life  I don't know  I just  I just can't answer  These questions  Alright  So you auditioned  For Sugar  And you go in  For Kush  And then 
[03:09:00]  How long did they  Give you to prepare  For Kush  I had a few people  Who came in for meetings  So I had  As you know  As auditions go  Maybe a half hour  That's not a lot of time  For the rest of your life  To be in a movie  That big  Well I mean  You try not to think of it  In those terms  You try to think of it  As just like a small goal  You don't try to think  You know  You take  You know  You work at sports broadcasting  You're supposed to take things  One game at a time  One game at a time man  I auditioned  For your part first  Kush 
[03:09:30]  And  Did you put on  A southern accent  I did  But I clobbered it  It was awful  And my grandmother  Is from Odessa, Texas  And then I said  I was doing a lot of gigs  In Boston  Hanging up with Anthony Clark  Who's from Richmond, Virginia  So I'm like  I'll just do an Anthony Clark impression  I'll just get it all  But it just came out  Like Hasidic  I don't know what happened  It wasn't southern at all  And it was bad  Like I was embarrassed  And then I left  And the same thing  They asked me to come back  To read for The Babysitter  Right  And then I had like 
[03:10:00]  Two callbacks for that  And Cameron said  Look  When I went to the studio  With The Babysitter role  Cameron came out to me  And said  This speech  About John Coltrane  And Miles Davis  Playing together  Because you think  In the movie  He's going to hand  Tom Cruise  A condom  He goes  You're going to need this  I want you to use this  If you guys are going to go in there  And get busy  And instead he hands him a cassette  Remember those  He hands him a cassette  And it's live  Miles Davis  John Coltrane  I had that CD 
[03:10:30]  So I knew all the guys  And it was very easy  For me to remember  And it was very easy  For me to be passionate about it  I'm like  Cannibal Adderley on sax  And John Coltrane  Two masters of their craft  I still remember  A little bit of the sides  And I said  And Cameron said  This is the easiest part  Of the movie for me to cut  When you say it 
[03:11:00]  I don't want to cut it  I can't  So just do it the way  You've been doing it  Which is the worst thing  You can tell an actor  Keep doing it  Exactly the way you're doing it  And then we get in our heads  And we screw it up  And then on site  It was  Jim Brooks said  What about Sugar  And just the hair  On my neck stood up  Because I knew  How big a thing that was  But then I didn't want to have  What happened to you  Happened to me  A half hour  Because Sugar's  He's the whole  He's the  I said  Could I come back tomorrow  To prepare  It needs to be played  Completely 
[03:11:30]  And they said  Well tomorrow's Friday  When do you come back  Next week  Monday  And I go  How about Tuesday  And they go  Sure  Like they had all  It's such a big budget movie  They're like  Sure  And I just  All weekend  Like a crazy person  Just did it  Yeah  I was still on the east coast  And so  I only had  They put me up in a hotel  I don't think they want to  Give me another night there  And I certainly wasn't  Going to pay for it  That was crazy  Working on that movie  Huh  You remember  You know what kind of  Blew me away  Was the  Oh man 
[03:12:00]  Just what  Like remember  Mission Impossible  Came out that weekend  When we were shooting  And it was like  It broke all records  And just  I couldn't believe  How  How  You  Were not intimidated  By Tom Cruise  At all  You were  I couldn't believe  I remember  You were intimidated by him  I didn't look him in the eye  I was afraid  I mean I was  Because you were too tall  No man  Come on  I'll never forget  You going 
[03:12:30]  Hey Tom  Yelling across set  You have a jump rope  In your trailer  I want to do some jump rope  Do you remember that  Yeah  And I was like  And I remember standing  In like the shadows  Like not wanting to be seen  Like I've just been told  Like don't get noticed  And you'll last longer  I was just always afraid  Of getting fired  And you were like  Yo Tom  Can I run in your trailer  I remember like  His trailer  Like satellite dishes  Would come up  It was like  Emerald City  It was like something  It was like a space state  Like things would just like  Like you'd hear a hydraulic  And then another  Like it was like a transformer 
[03:13:00]  Then another like  Another  Like part of it  Would come out  And he was still married  To Nicole Kidman then  Janusz Kaminski  Was the director of photography  Was married to Bonnie Hunt  So not only was everyone  Famous and hot shit  Janusz Kaminski  Was the director of photography  For Schindler's List  Right  It was like  And most recently Lincoln  Yes  And Cameron Crowe  Was with Nancy Wilson  So not only was everybody  At the top of the world  At the top of the showbiz heap  Their wives were  Right  It's like the lead singer of Heart  The girl from Raising Arizona 
[03:13:30]  And Nicole Kidman  Just stopped by  You know just to say hi  It was crazy  It was  It was  You know I have to tell you though  Jay  The most special moment for me  Was driving up to your house  In the hills  Seeing Barry Katz's Ferrari  With stones stuck in the tires  Because it was a hill  Remember he'd put the stones  Under the tires  Afraid it would roll down buddy  My god man  But do you remember  He would put the stones  Under the tires  Like it was a trailer 
[03:14:00]  Like it was a trailer  Parked for months  On Ventura Boulevard  Wait stones  Is like small  He took like  Something the size of a laptop  Yeah  And jammed them  So it wouldn't roll down  I just don't want it to roll down  The hill man  And I remember driving up there  And we had no idea  That we were in that movie together  But we had known each other  Quite well  And I have to tell you  I'll get into this further  In the podcast  You really influenced me greatly  Early in my adolescence  And I'll get to it  But I remember driving up there  Because I was in LA 
[03:14:30]  I think because I had auditioned for it  Or I was doing wardrobe  And you said to me  I just booked a huge movie  With Tom Cruise  And I said  Oh my god  So did I  And that's when we realized  I was up in your place  In the hills  And I think I even said to you  Like holy shit Jay  Can you fucking believe  We're doing it  Like we were in that  Shitty sitcom  And you're the guy from Verona  And I would go to your house  In the Lower East Side  And you were so fucking funny  And Dina Cola  And Neil Brennan  And you showed me  A whole new world  And now here we are in LA  And we're fucking doing it 
[03:15:00]  I just  It was such an amazing moment  That you and I  Were both a part of that  Because I didn't know  Anybody there  I didn't know  You know  You had also been living in LA  For a couple years  And I'm not sure if you were  I think you were dating  Your first wife at the time  Yeah  So you were pretty established here  You were doing the  Jeff Foxworthy show  Yeah I had done  Saturday Night Live  Right  And I came here full time  I was doing Jeff Foxworthy show  Right  So you had found success  You were making TV money  You were doing the improv  Every night  What were you doing  Just a lot of pilots 
[03:15:30]  No I was in college still  Do you remember  NYU film school  Yeah  Yeah I remember  Remember the old days  I remember the old days  I remember a lot of them  And Neil Brennan  Staying in your place  And I had like four guys  Sleeping on one futon  It was very homoerotic  And I liked that  I'd get up to pee in the middle  Of the night  With a pee boner  And I'd be like  Look at these guys  This is nice  I saw one night  Neil Brennan was playing  At  Oh god  Not the old Boston place  But the place around the corner  Comedy Cellar  Comedy Cellar  Right  And he said  I'm there tonight  And I was in New York  And I ran over there 
[03:16:00]  And it was just so funny  To see him  He's funny  Oh he's really funny  And obviously he's found  A lot of success  But I hadn't  I hadn't seen him  Since I think he was  In your apartment  Did you talk to him at all  Well you know  He and I went to school together  But he dropped out of there  The second he got there  All the great ones do  Yeah  Did you graduate?  Yeah I did  Yeah your parents  Wouldn't let that fly  You couldn't drop out  With Michael  At the top of  At the helm  Well also  Jerry the listeners  Shouldn't know  You know I was living  No distractions  You're on a sitcom  I took a semester off 
[03:16:30]  To go do that  But I was also living at home  Do you remember my grace?  Like I was driving here  And I was like  Jesus Christ  Jay used to come over  With Dina Cola  And we played basketball  On the 17th street  And my great  Remember my grandfather  Was in the living room  It was so crazy  I remember your mom  Was wearing  Like a jumpsuit  Right  Like a cool one  Like Pete Townsend  The who  Yeah  Well they're weird people  They're from Chelsea  They're weird  They're very  I don't know  I wouldn't say weird  I would say off the beat  As cool  I think they're cool as hell  And your mom 
[03:17:00]  Was wearing a jumpsuit  Like Pete Townsend's  White jumpsuit  From like Tommy  She's a crazy lady  It was great  People don't know this  About Jerry O'Connell  Star of Crossing Jordan  I think  It's probably the most  Clock in the  Kangaroo Jack  Body shots  Piranha 3D  Your father  Is very British  Was in the Royal Air Force  And looks almost  To me  Looks almost exactly  If Mick Jagger  Didn't have the weird jowls  He looked exactly  Like your father 
[03:17:30]  Your father looks  Just like Mick Jagger  But with white white hair  You know I think  A lot of people  Is that fair?  I don't think he looks  Like Mick Jagger  Jerry  The Lou  I was over  Can you tell that story?  This is my favorite  O'Connell family story  Jay Moore  Would always say to me  No no  Don't give away the punchline  First just tell the story  My brother and I  Were in high school  And we were in Long Island  And my father had  Chartered a boat  With our uncle  The next morning  At like 4 in the morning  To go fishing  And as you know  It's extremely expensive  It's hundreds of dollars 
[03:18:00]  At the time  Hundreds  Probably thousands of dollars now  And there was a beach party  And you know  My brother and I  Wanted to go to the beach party  At night  And try and make out  And drink beer  Or whatever  And there was a bonfire  So my father said  Right I'm going to come back  And pick you up  In the parking lot  I'll be here  At 9 o'clock  Because we have to be up at 4  To go fishing  First thing in the morning  And we were like  Yeah yeah  Whatever  So like 9 o'clock  Rolled around  And my younger brother  Was like  Hey man it's 9  We have to go meet dad  And I was like  You know  I call bullshit  I call bullshit right there  There's no way 
[03:18:30]  That Charlie  Was the responsible one  Well he was  The way you told me  Originally  You guys hooked up  With chicks  And you're making out  You dug holes in the sand  To make out  Right  We were  Yeah  That's  We were  We were hooking up  We didn't want to go see my father  So then  We eventually saw  Headlights coming on the beach  And my father had a jeep at the time  And he pulled up to the bonfire  And then kids were all running  Because there was underage drinking  And they thought it was the cops  And there were  You know  Maybe a hundred kids there  And my father stepped out  Of the running car  And went  Jerry  Charlie  The luau 
[03:19:00]  Is over  And so  Jay  Heard that story  And then  Anytime we'd go out  Jay would say to us  If we were leaving  Jay would go  Jerry  The luau's over  Come on  But you told me  Like kids out in Montauk  That became like  Part of their lexicon  Like they'd be in a party  Like let's get out of here  Man this luau is over  Right  Can we talk about  How crazy you were  Back in those days  You remember Peggy Sue's  Yeah Peggy Sue's  That was a bar  Everyone that was on  University in 13  Yeah  And we went there often 
[03:19:30]  Drank for free  Not a good combo  When I come in  And you go  No you don't have to pay  For drinks here JJ  Just go behind the bar  And help yourself  I'll tell you about a theory  I had about you  In those days  I thought you were  On steroids  Really  Yeah because you got very  You gained about 20  We would lift weights together  Oh this is where  It's going to get good people  We would lift weights together  With each other  At that gym  Above the Angelica  What was it called  I don't know  I really don't know  And  Above the Angelica  Theater on Houston Street 
[03:20:00]  And there was a gym upstairs  That you and I  Would go to  And  You put on about  20 pounds  Yeah  In  Months  I was tired of being  A pencil neck geek  I was tired of people  Telling me the luau was over  I want to take control  Of my life  And kick some ass  Myself  Now I didn't lift  As much as you did  And I realized  You had a wrestling background  So you knew how to put on  Weight and take it off  And all that stuff  But  You know  I couldn't put  A pound on  And  You put on 20  And then  We would go to  Peggy Sue's 
[03:20:30]  And you  You had what  I believe was  Roid rage  Without the roids  And I guess  I shot Jason Steinberg  In the ass  Somebody had a stun gun  For security  One of the security guards  At Peggy Sue's  Had a stun gun  And I thought  It would be funny  If I shot my friend  Jason Steinberg  In the ass  With a taser  And then  Neil Brennan  Was on the podcast  And the story  Got to him  He was there  And Neil Brennan  Says  You did it to him  Twice  And I'm like  No no  Like I had to 
[03:21:00]  Put my foot down  Like no no no  I only tased  My friend once  I wasn't crazy  But that's how  I can understand  You thought I was  On steroids  I thought it would be  Funny to tase someone  Do you remember  You and  And I should tell  Everyone  Michael Di Nicola  Who was a comic  With Jay  Many of those years  How was he doing  He's just vanished  Nobody knows where he is  Are you kidding me  No  That's awful  You know sometimes  Late at night  When I'm cyber stalking people  I look them up  And I just can't find them either  It's just  He never really paid rent  It was one of those things  Where he was my roommate  And then  But you guys wrote together 
[03:21:30]  I mean obviously  There's a give and take  You were a famous TV star  At the time  And he was a struggling guy  So we all help people out  I learned like Master P says  When the money get low  There they go  There they go  I in my life  In the last four years  Have cut probably  Eight people out of my life  When I realized  There's no check on my end  They're not really  They don't really want to hang out  That's so amazing  And I made the cut  I'm still here  Yeah because you never took  A dime from me  Never  But Dina Cola once  I canceled the DC Improv  And the Baltimore Improv  Because I had another gig  And I said to him  My business manager called me  And said 
[03:22:00]  How good friends are you  With this person  Let's say a different name  From now on  With Marty  Oh I'm sorry  Oh don't worry  No no it's fine  I go  I just don't want to pile on  Because he's destitute  I go  Really like great friends  Like we're best friends  He goes  Well he hasn't really paid rent  I go  How long  And he goes  No he's never paid rent  This entire year  Is this when you own that apartment  Up on 57th or something  43rd and 11th  I never  I always rented in New York  And he never paid rent  A year  Like never  Ever ever  The illusion of like paying rent 
[03:22:30]  And I asked him  Why haven't you paid rent  And he said  Sorry  And then we parted ways  And then I came up to him  I had a show at the Beacon Theater  And it sold out  It's like a big celebration  Everybody's there partying  Having a good time  I sold out the Beacon Theater  Like it's where the Allman Brothers play man  Big night  And Mike's there  And I said to him  I got to assume  You didn't pay rent  Because you had to eat  And you had to take care of necessities  And I don't want to be that guy  That doesn't give a guy a second chance  So I would like you to move back in  And we could be roommates again  Because it was a great time 
[03:23:00]  You know  And he moved back in  Four months go by  My business manager Dean  Calls me up and goes  Mr. Dean Acola  Hasn't paid rent  And I said to Mike  Why don't you pay rent  He goes  Well you canceled  The DC and Baltimore Improvs  I was going to open for you  That was going to be rent  And then I realized  I can't book gigs  To make sure you pay me the rent  Because you're my opening act  That's a lousy business model  And I've had other friends  Stand up friends  Who I realized  You know  I pay guys money to open for me  And now 
[03:23:30]  I don't pay anybody anything  Guys like Ryan Sickler  Who's got a great  Podcast  Sickle Cell  Sickle Cell  The Crab Feast  Which is a great podcast  That you guys should all subscribe to  On iTunes  The Crab Feast  He says to me  When we met  When he opened for me once  In Denver  At the Comedy Works  He said  Look man  Let me get something straight  I don't want a penny  Of your money  All I want is stage time  And the way we laugh  Off stage  Let's just laugh our balls off  And that guy  Flies himself to gigs  He probably loses money  Half the time  But that's how it used to be 
[03:24:00]  Like I used to drive to Buffalo  For like $50  I knew I was losing  A whole bunch of money  But I knew if I could make a contact  I could crack the code  Camp Wilder  No no no  I'm sorry  I still want to talk about  Young Jay Moore to everybody  Because another way  You really influenced me  And you'll never remember  These stories  Why did you ever come up to me  And say hey  Are you on steroids?  Because you were afraid  I'd get in a fight  I was afraid you would tase me  Don't tase me bro  No I  These are just things 
[03:24:30]  I was thinking about  When I was coming here  About to go down memory lane  I mean at the time  You know I probably said to you  Maybe when we were in a steam bath  Together or something  You used to always make me  Go in the steam bath  Nothing ever happened  I swear to god  But remember you used to love steams  I don't know anybody  I made Angie go in a steam  You used to have like a  Long thing remember  Yeah it's called  Smoking an eighth of pot a week  And you would always insist  On going in steam baths  Specifically in  When in different  Various gyms  In the west village  And stuff  Which I didn't always  Feel comfortable in 
[03:25:00]  And I want to tell  Everyone listening  Nothing ever happened  But it was still  Well you eventually  You left earlier than I did  So don't speak for me  Don't speak for me  If I met the toy cannon  It was just always crazy  And Jay was always someone who  And it was all jokingly  And done with humor  But always touched you  With his foot or something  At a steam bath  Or always made a joke  Like oh yeah  And it would be so steamy  And I'd be like  I know he's joking  But then  Like it was just crazy  But oh god  But I will never forget 
[03:25:30]  I was  My brother and I  Both went to NYU  And we were on a date  And you'll never remember  These girls  But it was  You were playing  Carolines  And I said  Let's go see my friend  Jay at Carolines  So we went uptown  And I'll never forget  The night  We stupidly bought  The beers  In the souvenir cups  Which aren't like  Ten dollar beers  They're like  Thirty dollar beers  And we kept ordering  The souvenir cups  This is Caroline  Right  So we  Between the four of us  We ordered eight beers  But we also ordered  Eight souvenir cups  So the bill came  To like four hundred dollars 
[03:26:00]  And I had to go negotiate  With the manager  Saying I didn't realize  We didn't want to buy  Eight souvenir cups  First of all  There's only four of us  Secondly  I don't need to remember  Caroline's that much  Thirdly  I've been to Pottery Barn  I have my own cups  Fourthly  I live at home  I don't even need  To buy my own cup  But I think I ended up  Negotiating for two hundred dollars  And getting to keep  Three of the Caroline's cups  But afterwards  We met up with you  And the girl I was with  You know  I was still  You know  I was probably like 19  And I was 19  So the girl I was with  Did a trick with her tongue 
[03:26:30]  Where she moved her tongue fast  This is such a  This is such a weird story  But it's just  I just want people to realize  The pedestal  That I put Jay Moore on  And Jay Moore  Without flinching  Or changing his voice  Looked at her  She moved her tongue  Very fast  And Jay Moore said  If I had a clit  I'd marry you right now  And it made us  It doesn't make any sense  It made us laugh  So hard  And we couldn't stop laughing  And those girls  Who my brother and I  Dated for months 
[03:27:00]  Oh I mean it  Because if I had a clitoris  She could use it on it  Yeah if I had a clit  I would marry you right now  And like then you kept walking  And we were in Times Square  And we couldn't stop laughing  And all night  We went to Phoebe's  Remember Phoebe's  That bar on the lower east side  We were laughing  And I just  It was a real turning point  In my life  I was like  Was she laid that night?  I actually  I had a relationship  With this girl  For years  It was your fault  And I  There you go buddy  I mean it was  It was all you  I was really crazy  You were very funny though 
[03:27:30]  Neil Brennan and I  I was actually a good friend  For you though  Because I never  You were a very good friend  For me  I never  Whenever you did things  To a  I never got mad at you  You let me know  When it was over the line  In a way a friend would  But I never got mad at you  No  You did it great  You would go  Jay this is  This is not okay  You spoke to me  Almost like a parent  But in a cool  Like a friend  And you say like  You know you got the one friend  That's nuts  You go bro bro bro  Over the line  No no no no  No no no  You don't bowl in the Shabbos man  No good  Yeah  And I always listen to you 
[03:28:00]  Because I knew  Your head was in the right spot  All the time  You  Neil Brennan was on the podcast  And Neil Brennan  Why did you act that way  Because apparently  I was like abusive to Neil  Like I just teased the shit out of him  And he said why  And I said  I'm going to say  Alcoholism combined with mania  And he goes  But what did you gain  And I go  That's the part  I don't understand  About me  I gained nothing  I took no pleasure  From mocking you  Or making you feel poorly  It's almost like 
[03:28:30]  Once it got rolling  Like a snowball  It got bigger  Mania  Like when people are bipolar  But I never swung the other way  I was always up  Well I also want to say  Anytime you said anything rude to me  I never took it personally  I mean  I was like Don Rickles  Yeah  It was like  It was  It never offended me  One time we were in  I'm going to mention this bar again  I mean I can't believe I'm plugging it  It's been closed for 30 years  Peggy Seuss  But we were there  And we almost got into a fight  With another celebrity  And when I say we  I mean you  And I don't want to mention it  I did get in a fight 
[03:29:00]  With Anthony Michael Hall  On the roof of Peggy Seuss  You were the one  I don't remember that  It was in a stairwell actually  And it was crazy  But that was after  I punched him out on the roof  But it was crazy  Because he was a very large man  He was roided out  I don't know  I don't know that  Edward Scissorhands  Alright that's true  I don't know that  Edward Scissorhands  Very different sized  Anthony Michael Hall  Than every other  Anthony Michael Hall  He was a large man  And you got into a fight with him  And I was with you  And it was  It was intimidating  It was frightening  You know  And you were not frightened  In any way whatsoever  I don't know if it was  Your anger that you and Neil 
[03:29:30]  Are talking about  If it was the fact  That you're from Verona  And that's how you react  To these situations  I'll tell you what it was  But it was in a stairwell  Hold on a second  But remember we used  We used to play ping pong  All the time  At that Korean ping pong club  25th street  And I said  Hey man let's go play  Some ping pong  And you  For months after that  You would always say  Hey man let's go play  Some ping pong  Let's go play some ping pong  Anytime any sort of  Situation happened  That seemed to be  Somewhat aggressive  You would turn to me  And go  Let's go play some ping pong  Oh you said it during the fight 
[03:30:00]  It wasn't during the fight  It was afterwards  When everyone was pushed  To their perspective corners  And I was like fuck that  Let's go back  Where is he right now  And you're like  Hey Jay let's just go  Play some ping pong  I was like let's go  Play some ping pong  Let's go play some ping pong  I didn't want to fight  The people who were  Significantly larger than us  And I believe it was  Only you and I there  And I just  It was just  It was a losing battle  And I said  Let's go play some ping pong  No way  Maybe in your  Okay  Here's why  But for me it was  I spent my entire life  In the neighborhood  The youngest kid 
[03:30:30]  By two years  In my life  On my street  And in the neighborhood  Then so all my friends  Go to junior high  And they go to high school  And I'm just alone  So I was either alone  Or I was the youngest guy  So I had to keep  Resetting the table  Improving myself  And then when you're  Playing like tackle football  When you're 12  And you're playing tackle football  With 14 year olds  They kick the shit out of you  Wrestling practice  I'm the youngest guy  In the varsity team  I'm 105  105 pounds  Guys are throwing me  All over the place  Stand up comedy  I'm 16 years old  And the youngest  I'm not old enough  To be in the bar 
[03:31:00]  And I'm there  And I'm getting more left  So I always had  It wasn't even  A Napoleon complex  It was  I am actually good enough  To do this  And everyone keeps  Acting like a dick to me  So instead of going  Into a shell  I hit the incline bench  At the gym above Angelica  And I went  No more  I'm done with this  No one's doing this  To me anymore  And with him that night  I remember he called me  We had the same girlfriend  Once  Anthony Michael Hall  Was the girl  Who worked there  No it was this girl  Teresa  That was like a  Ford model 
[03:31:30]  And she was  This girl  She kind of looked like  Elaine Irwin  John Cougar Mellencamp's wife  I always remember  The girls you dated in LA  Were so attractive  In LA  No in New York  LA I was  I didn't  I didn't fool around at all  I was too busy  Doing comedy  Like 1920  Sure  But I remember this girl  Looked  She was with  Anthony Michael Hall  And I remember she was  Playing pool at Peggy Sue's  And I went up to her  And I said  Why are you dating  Anthony Michael Hall  You should be dating me  And she goes  Alright  That's like your first clue 
[03:32:00]  This isn't going to be  A good relationship  That a girl  That's like a biker chick  On meth  Like alright  I'll ride with you  Big daddy  So a month goes by  Me and this girl  And then she leaves me  And goes back to him  Then he calls me  In my home  At LA  Somebody gave him  My phone number  Yeah me  Very nice Jerry  And I literally pick up the phone  And he goes  You will never set foot  In New York City again  In New York City  Swear to God  Because you know  I'll be here waiting 
[03:32:30]  To kick your ass  And I know you'll never  Go to Peggy Sue's again  Especially  On a Thursday night  Because that was like  The big party night  It was like  All the model parties  Especially on a Thursday night  Because you know what  You know that's my night  And you will never  Set foot in there again  Because you know it's  And he gave me  Like this whole thing  Like don't set foot  In New York  Don't go to Peggy Sue's  Don't talk to Kellyanne  Or Patrick  Like my best friends  Kellyanne's like  A sister to me  And he goes  Because you know  I'll be there  Waiting for you 
[03:33:00]  So that's really  Just saying to me  Do me a favor  Get on the next flight  Come here and punch me  In the mouth  What he didn't know  Was the next day  I was flying to Philadelphia  To do stand up  At college  Well that's not New York  So that's okay right  Yeah but I'm on a train  I have an apartment in New York  I have to go back to New York  I live there  So I have  I have  I'm not going to not go  To my apartment  If I'm paying rent  So I'm doing  The next day  I go  I know you're drunk right now  But I hope you're sober  Sober enough  To remember this  When I actually see you again  I hang with the phone  The next night 
[03:33:30]  I have a gig  At Philadelphia College  Of Textiles and Science  I get  Good school  On the plane  I do the gig  And then I go  From the gig  To the station  The train  Penn Station  In Philadelphia  To Manhattan  And I walk  Two Peggy Sues  With my luggage  Backpack  Two suitcases  And I remember  Going up the stairs  And Kellyanne  Beautiful sweet  Sweetest girl in the world  Kellyanne goes  No no no  And I go  If it was in a church  It just would have  Happened in church  Out of the way 
[03:34:00]  And I give her  The Heisman  And I go up the stairs  And I go up to the roof  And that's when the fight happened  But he did call me  And say all that  You should have him  On the podcast  And talk about it  I mean I'm sure  It's all water  Under the bridge  At this point  I would hope so  It was a little  Quick weird little fight  You know what  I should have used  I should have used  A tire tube  Or something  Jerry's very  Anti-confrontational  Doing it again  No it's not that  I'm anti-confrontation  It's just that  I just  I didn't feel comfortable  Yeah I didn't feel 
[03:34:30]  Comfortable fighting  With large  Groups of large men  In the stairwell  Of Peggy Sues  I would rather go  Talk to the model  Who was playing pool  At the pool team  But I already done that  And if  And if someone told me  Not to go back  To Peggy Sues  I probably  I probably shouldn't be there  In the first place  I mean  I'm pretty sure  There were other bars  In lower Manhattan  Yeah but that was the place  That we all hung out  Like it was like cheers  And I was Norm  And you were Cliffy  And like we went there  All the time  And we were all the holidays  What else can I say  About Young Jay  That cracked me up  We gotta talk about  Our sitcom that we did 
[03:35:00]  We have to talk about  Camp Wild  And we will in a second  I want to go back to  Sorry  No I don't care  You're the guest  This is great for me  I want to say  We knew each other  For a few years  And you started working  In SNL  And you asked me  To come up to the offices  I don't even think  You'll remember this  And I went up to the offices  And it was really exciting  And you gave me a tour  And you showed me  All the photos  Of Steve Martin  And Chevy Chase  And Martin Short  And I went up there  And it's right before  You wrote the Barney  Charles Barkley sketch 
[03:35:30]  Barkley versus Barney  Yeah it was great  Opening monologue  So funny  And  I said that very aggressively  Sorry  No it was  Because it was  It's one of those  Iconic sketches  And  But you seemed really  You were really stressed out  Up there  I could tell  You know  And it was like  Kind of fun for me  To go up there  And see you  And you had a couple  Friends there  But you were  You were the most  Stressed out  I've ever seen you  You were  Yeah I don't  You know  When I wrote the book  Asking for air time  It really 
[03:36:00]  Like I got stressed out again  Like it was weird  Just like reliving it  Yeah  And the memories  Were so vivid  And once I made  I just didn't talk  About SNL  Because it was so weird  It was like Vietnam  Like you weren't there man  But then when you write  A book about it  And when someone  Gives you a check  A big check  To write a book about it  You better remember it  And you better make it interesting  So then when I made  The commitment  To just dive head first  Back into it  I remember the color  Of the carpets  Like weird  Like Vietnam veteran stuff  Like I remember 
[03:36:30]  Everybody's names  I remember their tics  I remember what they  Smelled like  I remember what  Everyone's offices  Like what they had  In their offices  And stuff  Al Franken  Always chewed on pencils  And it grossed me out  You introduced me  To Al Franken  You in sort of like  U.S. Senator Al Franken  Yeah  Sort of like you  Asking Tom Cruise  For a jump rope  And then running  Into his trailer  I never ran into  I'm not crazy  I never ran into his trailer  I'm pretty sure  The story I remember  Is you pointing at him  While he was walking  To set with his detail  And you going 
[03:37:00]  Yo Tom  Let me grab your jump rope  And then running  Into his trailer  And coming up  With a jump rope  And starting to  Do jump rope outside  No I'll tell you  Exactly what it was  Before his take  When he's getting fired  And he's all sweaty  And he's freaking out  Because he's lost the battle  On the phones  I love black people  Show me the money  And he goes  Who's coming with me  Besides Flipper here  He wanted to be all sweaty  And he wanted it  To be like organic  And he's not like  A method guy  I thought he was  And by the way  Tom Cruise  One of the coolest  Human beings  I've ever worked with  In my life  Top of the leaderboard 
[03:37:30]  Would you agree  Yes  Great guy  Knows everyone's name  Kind to the crew  Andrew how are you  Everybody okay  How's your girlfriend  That's great  You still like Korean chicks  Alright  So he wouldn't say that  I just made that up  Because he's got a Korean girlfriend  But he knew everybody  And he was great  And so he was jumping rope  Behind those giant flags of light  You know  To make that office  By the way  For those of you  That watch Jerry Maguire  That huge office  That he quits  When he gets fired  And he has to go pack up  That was a set 
[03:38:00]  That was like  A five million dollar set  All those computers  You were never on it  Were you  All those computers worked  All the phones went out  And phones came in  And all the voicemails  Were set up  You've reached Bob Sugar  Like we had to do that  And I had business cards  I had everything  That said Bob Sugar  Whatever the name  Of the company was  Do you remember the scene  Where you call up  My hotel room  You were actually on the phone  On the other end  Yeah  Just sniff or something  If he's there  Yeah I mean  Normally in any other show 
[03:38:30]  You work on  You have someone  A PA or something  Reading lines  Yeah no  They spared no expense  The phones worked  So he would jump rope  Right before that scene  So he was completely gassed  And just defeated  He wanted to physically  Look disheveled  Without a wardrobe person  Going I'll untuck it  A little like this  Maybe this  And I'll spritz your face  So he would just jump rope  For like five minutes  Straight in between set ups  And they'd say action  He'd just drop the rope 
[03:39:00]  And go  Who's coming with me  Who's coming with me  Besides Flipper here  Like he was  He was gassed  So that was me  Making fun of him  For jumping rope  I was breaking his balls  I was going  Hey Tom  Is alright  If I use your jump rope  Isn't that cool  That's not the way  I remember it Jay  I remember you  Really getting into shape  Back then  You talked a lot about  You were the first person  Who I ever heard the term carbs from  You talked a lot about carbs  In those days  No I was into music  I was talking about the carbs  That's not true  You actually used the term  Empty carbs  And I often to this day 
[03:39:30]  Don't know what that means  Beer  Bread  Empty carbs  Are you manorexic  No  I see pictures of you  In Star Magazine  Running around  I run a lot  I think Jerry might be manorexic  I do a lot of cardio  But I've always been thin  And you know it  And you're married  We're not going to mention anything  Or is it okay  Sure  Your beautiful wife  Rebecca  Yeah  Rebecca Romaine  Is your  We both have hot wives  We both hit the wife lottery

[03:41:00]  Remember the joke  You used to have  About your grandfather  Coffee  Hug me  Oh my god  I forgot about it  That's a great joke  That's such a funny joke  That Jay used to have  And anytime I wanted to go  Hug my father  He'd go  Coffee  Coffee  Coffee  Coffee  Coffee  Go hug him  Wow  I gotta write that down  I've forgotten more material  Than  I know  Alright  You and I run a sitcom  So how old are your twins  Four  Are they identical  No  Not identical  Thank god  That's creepy right

[03:42:00]  Oh this is great  And you'll never remember these  Um  Yeah because I'm an alcoholic  Jerry  A lot of it went out my ears  I saw you in Vegas  When you were doing stuff  For more sports  I don't know what the event was  But it was a big sporting event  And you were with your  Big time producer  For more sports  Bob Morton  And you um  Had a huge billboard  Outside of Staples  Bob Morton  Veteran of the  More Stories podcast  Um  And um  You were  You were  First of all 
[03:42:30]  I'd never seen you  Smoke cigarettes  You were chain smoking  Because I quit  Shooking tobacco  So I just switched  Um  But I'd never seen you  Smoke a cigarette  And that was a little jarring  You know  And um  So far  I remember all of this  You were out of your  You were  You were out of your  Trippie  And then I couldn't believe  I saw you on Craig Ferguson  And you were  Listen you can cut this out  This is your thing  I couldn't believe  This is right after  I think more sports  Was cancelled  And I watched more sports  And I thought you were great  And listen  I go down to your 
[03:43:00]  Killborn  I think you're about to say  Craig Killborn  Sorry  Um  And I went to your  Sports show today  And I listened to you  On 570  And I  And you were great  You're almost born  For this job  And this is a guy  I want everyone to know  Listening right now  This is a guy who  Jane Moore  Is the only man I know  Who sits down  And watches  An entire baseball game  On television  Can sit down  And watch a game  From beginning to end  On television  And it's not in the background  He sits there  And watches  A baseball game  I'll never forget that  I remember 
[03:43:30]  You and I hanging out  And you watching  A Colorado's  Rockies game  And me being like  What are you watching this for  And you being like  Oh it's the Rockies  Something was happening  I don't know  I like  Well now as a kid  I don't watch a whole game  Obviously but  I like the battles  Within the battles  I love the way  A pitter  A pitter  I love the way  A hitter  Make me feel great  I love the way  A hitter  Works the lineup  I love watching  The way a pitcher  Throws to open a game  Oh he's going all inside 
[03:44:00]  The first time  Through the order  And then  Then I get obsessed  Almost OCD  Like  Is he going to keep  Jamming them inside  With inside pitches  The second time  Through the order  Or did he switch gears  And start throwing  Breaking stuff  Way outside  You know  Is he getting  In their heads  I love to watch  A game plan  Of a pitcher  Executed  When they're doing  It correctly  That's all  Well anyway  It's  I think you  I've never seen 
[03:44:30]  Never seen you happier  Doing this  There's a lot of people  That can watch a baseball game  Start to finish  They're called  Unemployed people  Jerry  I do  I do  I do  So let me ask  And you can cut this out  Let me ask you  About that  More sports thing  When it went off  Why did you go off  The rails like that  Why didn't you just  Like say  Oh it didn't work out  You personally  Attacked the head  Of ESPN  Now I don't know  The head of ESPN  Was Mark Shapiro  And what happens  In show business  And Jerry knows  This as well  As anybody 
[03:45:00]  You sell a show  To person A  Person A leaves  B comes in  It's not their show  It's just something  That's already  So a new head  Came in  Mark Shapiro  I sold the show  To Michael Eisner  And he green lit it  And then he left  Now Mark Shapiro  Comes in  And he's got this  Band of misfit toys  A bunch of comic  Potheads  Doing this sports  Variety show  And he's trying to  Tell us how to do it  But we've already  Been up and running  For two three weeks  Like we're okay bro  Leave us alone  And he got involved  I don't  Look all comics  Really want  Is autonomy 
[03:45:30]  Just let me  When I'm on stage  Let me say  Whatever I want to say  And if you tell me  When I do corporate gigs  If it's a G rated show  Just did one in Orlando  For the people  At Raymond James  Financial  Like fine  Gee  No problem  I didn't say  Damn  Nothing  PGR  Just tell me  What you want  But then get out  Of the way  You gotta leave me alone  And what he started  To do was  We would do  A monologue  And it was a comedy  It was a comedy show  It was like the  Tonight Show  But sports  And I would do  A monologue  And stuff  And we would  Edit it to time  And then we'd  Put it up in the  Satellite 
[03:46:00]  Through the computers  And it would get  Sent to Bristol  Connecticut  Where ESPN  Headquarters is  And then they would  Get it and receive it  And now it's their  Responsibility to actually  Put it on television  And then when I  Watch the show  On television  It would be all  Different shit  Different jokes  In the monologue  Sketches we did  Were cut out  So they recut it  They recut it  And when we asked  Them why  Mark Shapiro  Specifically said  To Bob Morton  Who by the way  Has 19 Emmy  Nominations for comedy  Because of the  David Letterman show  He goes  It just wasn't funny 
[03:46:30]  Guys  It just wasn't funny  So I just helped it out  So now you got a suit  Telling you what's funny  And recutting the show  To me that's unacceptable  And I got a staff of comics  I'm their leader  And then when they  Canceled the show  It enraged me  Because I knew  That guys did their jobs  Exceptionally well  Not well  Not good  Not great  These guys  Were given a chance  And they went  K.P. Anderson  Runs the soup  The reason the soup  Is fun and good again  Is because K.P. Anderson  Took it from garbage  And he ran it the right way  With the way he did 
[03:47:00]  More sports  And like  Ralphie May  Was a writer on that show  John Moore  The colonel  John Holland Moore  He runs Joe Schmo now  He was on that show  My coaching tree on that  Is incredible  And guys that did their jobs  Better than anybody  Could have asked  Lost their jobs  Because that guy  Had a hard on for us  Do you watch  That's why I went on  Craig Kilbourne  And said  I will always watch ESPN  And what you're referring to  Is on TV  I said  But Mark Shapiro  Is a fucking cocksucker  Do you watch these shows now  The soup  Tosh  Fallon 
[03:47:30]  And do you  I mean is it a different eye  That you look at those shows  With now  No  I watch them  And I like them  I know  Like I like Tosh  I like Anthony Jeselnik's show  A lot  Yes so do I  It's funny  Love it  But  You should be on his panel  I'd like to  Sure  I would love it  But the thing with  When I watch ESPN shows  We didn't know that  A .4 rating  Was normal  For the middle of the day  On ESPN  Like pardon the interruption  That's what it gets  But when we came out  With a .4 rating  They panicked 
[03:48:00]  They thought we were  Going to get like a 2  Like a WB show  Like you know  But we didn't  So that's why  We have to talk about  Camp Wild  And I will  And you can cut this all  No we're not going to cut any of it  We don't cut the podcast  It's warts and all baby  One last point I want to make  I like you working in sports  Because there's  There's always material  To go off of  Every day  Every morning you wake up  You know  I'm happy as hell  You know  I mean something  Something happened  You know  I mean  Carson Palmer went to the Raiders  I mean that's 
[03:48:30]  That's a half hour of material  Right there  I mean  He didn't go to the Raiders  He went to the Cardinals  From the Raiders  Yeah yeah yeah  I gotcha  They're retiring Shaqs  As we record this  They retired Shaquille O'Neal's jersey  It's really funny  And somebody tweeted the show  And said  To honor his free throws  The jersey should miss the hooks  When they try to raise it up  To the Raptors  You know what's fun Jerry  The audience sometimes  They're really funny  Yeah  They're dialed in  And if they  Just  All you gotta do  All anybody wants  Is to be wanted  And recognized  And when you just say  Hey man  Drew just had a great tweet 
[03:49:00]  And you just say that guy's name  On the air  Just reward the guy  And a lot of shows  Don't do that  They'll just read the tweet  Like the show  That's not  A lot of shows that are on  They just do it  Well I think you're also  A comic  And you know  How to give credit  You know what I'm saying  I think that's  That's part of the  That's part of  You're  You want  Everybody wants to be  A good guy  In stand-up comedy  A lot of comics  Don't like giving up the credit  I think it's one of  I will say this about myself  I think it's one of  My better skills  Is saying  This person just said 
[03:49:30]  Something really funny  Let's back up  And readdress it  How many times  Did you audition  For Crossing Jordan?  Um  I had a friend  Who was a writer on it  So they just hired you?  You were the lead  Female lead  Uh  I had a friend  Who was a writer on it  That doesn't answer my question  A guy I went to college with  So how many times  Did you audition  For Crossing Jordan?  I didn't audition  So you were offered  The job  To be the co-lead  Yep  Wow  That'll get you a nice house  With twins in it man 
[03:50:00]  That's a lot of dough  How long did that run?  Six years  That's a lot of money  And then you did the crossover  On Las Vegas  That's right  Las Vegas and Crossing Jordan  They tried to do a little crossover  Like when the Harlem Globetrotters  Would have the Scooby-Doo gang over  Right  Right  Right  So uh  Is that the most amount of money  You made in show business?  It has to be right?  Yeah of course it is  Six years on a procedural drama?  You know  I didn't really want to do it  For money  Shut up  I'm asking you  What project in your life  Did you make the most money on? 
[03:50:30]  Now I don't want to number  I think in terms of a job  That was the longest job  I've ever had  Six years  That's a long time  You know  I did a show  I did a show  I did a show before that  For five years  Called  The Sliders  The Sliders fiction show  Oh yeah yeah yeah  So I um  But you didn't make as much  On the sci-fi channel  As you did on CBS  Just tell me  What show  Did you make the most money on?  Uh  Crook  I would say  Crossing Jordan  You are correct  Yeah  I know  But you're like  You're such a politician  I just don't like  Talking about money 
[03:51:00]  We're not talking about money  We're talking about  What was the most beneficial  To you and your family  Yeah  Now you know why  I was so aggressive  Because I couldn't get a  Out of you  All in my 20s  Can't we just go play ping pong  Let's just play ping pong  I believe the bonus content  If you go to  YouTube.com  Slash  More Stories Balls  You and I  Jerry  Will talk about  Being on the sitcom  Camp Wilder  Two time Academy Award winner  Hilary Swank  Was on that show  Right  And uh  I remember we used to  Mock her  Almost every day  No listen Jay  I didn't  Because we couldn't 
[03:51:30]  Have her  Well listen  I like you  Had a big crush on her  And don't say you didn't  Have feelings for her  Because you did  But she was  Hilary was continually  In a very long relationship  And also  Met her  Then soon to be husband  Chad Lowe  Chad Lowe  While we were working together  In 1992  Yeah  Jay  21 years ago  Jay  You said that like Alex Trebek  21 years ago  Ooh sorry  It was 21 years  And the image of Jay  I remember then 
[03:52:00]  Is him in a 1992  Turquoise  Blue  Seattle Seahawk Blue  Seattle Seahawk Blue  Mustang Convertible  Yeah  Playing  One of two CDs  Onyx  Onyx is heavyweight  And still undisputed  Planet Earth  Or  Or  Or  Playing  Bone  God what was it  It wasn't Bone Pugs  In Harmony  No no no  Slam  No not slam  OPP 
[03:52:30]  How can I explain it  I said it frame by frame  Naughty by Nature  With the stupidest album cover ever  Somebody  Vin  From Naughty by Nature  Hand drawing  A baseball bat  For the cover  Nice artwork guys  But  Come a long way  From Boston  And Kansas  And also throwing in some  Frank Sinatra  Blaring it  Driving down Ventura  Really funny  Remember we used to go to that little puff and put  That pitch and put  And drink beers  With all the prop guys  Yeah  Yeah the prop guys on that show 
[03:53:00]  Were actual alcoholics  They were  And they were  There was a lot of drinking  In between work and stuff  You know  Yeah  You and I did not  I know that for a fact  And I remember  We would go into the prop room  And they had coolers of beer  And they just went in there  And they just got gassed  But you would never know  Remember  Now I always see those guys  Like when you work the Emmys  You'll be like  Oh hey man  Like they're the best guys  Yeah  Remember they had a code  If they wanted something  They would never yell it  So that the producers would hear  That it would go  Like if they needed you to do something 
[03:53:30]  And they didn't want to go  Hey Jay  Pick up that prop  Like they were yelling  Or like panicking  They just go  Yeah they had your back  That's exactly right  They were good dudes  Then you turn and look at them  And they'd be like  So there was no yelling  And I use that to this day  It's so great  You zip your twins  Like who pooped her pants  I do have a big whistle  That I can do  That I  Can you whistle  Loudly  Really  Yeah  I'd rather be able to whistle  Than dunk  Would you rather be able to whistle  Or dunk  Are you ready  For this big whistle  Angie are you ready  We're gonna whistle  You ready 
[03:54:00]  That's amazing  Yeah  Can Charlie whistle too  My brother  No  Fucking Charlie Chan  No I have a daughter  Named Charlie as well  Oh that's sweet  Well it'd be weird  If a two year old  Could whistle  No he can't  It bothers him I bet  Your brother was on The Bachelor  Let's not get too far from that  Yeah it was crazy  When he was on The Bachelor  Do you actually have sex  With the girls  During the show  Because that's how I would pick  I would pick  Whichever one had sex with me 
[03:54:30]  I think there's a lot of hanky panky  My brother  And he should speak for himself  But from what I saw  It was a pretty dreadful experience  You know a lot of alcohol  Is involved  A lot of alcohol  And like videotaping  Of things is involved  I think you're put into  What can only be  Aggressive positions  Like in a stairwell  Of Peggy Sue's  And it's  I think it was  Pretty much a negative experience  For my brother  I don't know that  For a fact  He should speak for himself 
[03:55:00]  How long did he date  The girl that  I think years  Hold on  That quote  One  I think  I think years  How come he's the one Bachelor  That's not on People Magazine  All the time  There's always like  Ryan and Tristo  They got back together  Like I don't know  Who these people are  Because my brother  Finally there's one Bachelor  That I actually know  And I have a vested interest in  And he's like the lost Bachelor  Because he works  He works on a fishing trolling boat  In Montauk Long Island  I mean  He's not  But that's like 
[03:55:30]  Where are they now  That's like perfect  For People Magazine  I understand that  But that's not  Do you  And I want to say  Jay  I really want to  Thank you  You really  I think you helped  Me become a man  You made me funny  You really helped me  To not be intimidated  In front of women  You know  I hung out with you  When I was 18  19  20  21  And those  In a young man's life  And I want to say  Because you were  A stand up comic  Because you were not  Afraid of  Young people
