<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing, vulgar attack on "The Dopey and Agni Show" and its viewers,  followed by a discussion about workplace culture, contrasting their past lax work environments with the stricter, more surveilled modern workplaces. This included sexually suggestive humor and reminiscences about office romances and inappropriate behavior.  The conversation then heavily focused on the Greg Kelly rape accusation, presenting a skeptical view of the accuser and highlighting perceived inconsistencies, using crude language throughout.  A discussion of Newt Gingrich's moon base proposal segued into a list of NASA inventions, punctuated by offensive jokes and a caller correcting the hosts’ misconception about the moon’s rotation.  No in-studio guests were explicitly named during this portion.

The show continued with a discussion of Super Bowl songs, including those by Eastside Dave and "Bobo Man," whose comedic, self-deprecating, and vulgar audio message pleaded for a return to the show. A humorous phone call about butt plugs was played, followed by a promo for a hoarding reality show.  Discussion then turned to "Racist Gallagher," a comedian performing at the Apollo.  Music selections were interspersed with commentary.  A call from Jay Moores discussed a past awkward appearance and Demi Moore’s alleged whippet use.  The hosts then discussed Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney's finances, a news clip about a drunk Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune, and reminisced about the show, its prizes, and a contestant's unusual response.  A nonsensical caller interaction ensued.  Donald Trump Jr. then joined as a guest, discussing his Twitter presence, filling in for Jim Norton, fly fishing, competitive shooting, New York City construction, and a real estate conference in Dubai featuring life-sized T-Rex robots.

Trump Jr.’s appearance continued, detailing his *Celebrity Apprentice* experiences with Penn Jillette, Clay Aiken, and Paul Sr., the Super Bowl, the Republican primaries (focusing on Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney), his childhood in New York, and summers in Czechoslovakia. Adam Ferrara joined the conversation, discussing his new car show and a humorous brake-changing anecdote involving his father's chamois cloth. A segment from a fictional "Book of Ted" was read. Trump Jr. mentioned a past misunderstanding with his father and the show, now resolved, and details from the resulting press coverage were read.  He also discussed his international travels in India and China, highlighting humorous cultural differences.

The show transitioned into a discussion about the Indian work ethic contrasted with perceived US attitudes, abruptly shifting to graphic descriptions of botched silicone butt injections in Queens, including anecdotes of resulting complications and fatalities.  Adam Carolla then joined as a guest, discussing his move to Santa Monica, purchasing a desktop computer, and his experience as a NASCAR flag-waver.  He recounted a drag racing trip with "Bison," his work on a History Channel show involving driving challenges and stunt school, and his experiences in off-road racing.  The hosts expressed their dislike for many reality shows, but fondness for those featuring unusual people,  playing clips of "Rock Lady."  They criticized "Toddlers & Tiaras," Kim Kardashian's Twitter activity, and Reverend Al Sharpton’s MSNBC show.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Adam Carolla’s personal life, food preferences, and humorous anecdotes, including a sewage mishap.


A segment focused on flying, including anecdotes about spatial disorientation and flying with Joe Buck, and the past availability of affordable 767 simulator lessons. Helicopter flying, childhood memories of toys (Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, Spirographs), and past landlord encounters were discussed. Adam Ferrara, also in studio, discussed his social media presence, performances, *Celebrity Apprentice* appearance, and his web show, "Life on the Compound."  Cheryl Tiegs’ aging was jokingly discussed.  The hosts promoted voting for themselves in the Shorty Awards.  The discussion then turned to workplace dynamics, specifically the perceived jealousy of a staff member, Mars, towards the friendship between another host and Rob Cross, detailing workplace interactions and personal lives, including an upcoming birth. Super Bowl bets, a former intern's experience with D.L. Hughley, and a strip club anecdote involving Ferrara and Stephen Blatter were also mentioned. Ron Bennington joined briefly to discuss fast-food preferences.  The show concluded with discussion of upcoming appearances by Ron and Fez, Davey Mac, Sam Roberts and Dolph Ziggler, along with promotion of their Facebook page and broadcast schedule. The final segment started with a description of a promotional photo of Opie and Anthony at the Hard Rock, likened to "the Russian Revolution," followed by a recounting of a book lady's reaction.  Opie's upcoming obligation to wear a Giants onesie was mentioned, along with discussion of changing hip hop trends.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How do we explain the show? We should start there.  The Dopey and Agni show, their followers are violent extremists.  I would have ripped this cock off.  They use every derogatory term on the planet, but they can't argue or debate.  You're a waste of life, you fucking pig.  The Dopey and Agni show is a slut machine.  You have lovely giant breasts.  My nipples are kind of hard right now.  Fuck yeah.  They were like little lizards licking at their foots.  That's what they done.  It's fucking brilliant. 
[00:00:30]  The Dopey and Agni show, they breed violent extremists.  They call that humor for some reason.  Welcome to the program.  These people are not part of the human race.  These are anti-human.  They suck a tits or something.  That's what they're all doing.  They're the most vulnerable in society.  Jucky, ducky, fad, fad.  How dare you question the Dopey and Agni show?  Get used to it, man.  Let's go fucking have a good time, you know what I mean?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Why is the rage so low?  Funny and funny.  What?  Oh, yeah.  You know how low that is?  Yeah.  E-Rock, turn that shit up, man.  Oh.  Yeah.  Morning.  Friday morning.  Very important day to the working show.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Wait, turn that down.  Did you say Friday? 
[00:01:30]  I did.  Yeah.  It's Friday.  Did you say Friday?  I don't know.  Turn that off for a second.  You missed it.  You missed it the first time.  I can't sit here and make believe you didn't miss it the first time.  Yeah.  Well, when have we played that song?  Every Friday.  Every Friday?  At some point.  Mr. I Took a Sick Day?  It should be geared up in there, ready to roll. 
[00:02:00]  First bit of the morning fails miserably.  Epic fail.  Yep.  An E-Rock failure is the first bit of the morning.  Yes.  So it kind of worked itself out there.  That's all right.  What are you going to do, man?  It is.  Fridays are very, very important.  People wake up with a different attitude on a Friday.  They do?  Yeah, because, you know, tonight's like, woo, drinking and partying, woo.  What about the people that start that on a Thursday?  That's good.  That's called the other Friday. 
[00:02:30]  Thursday is the other Friday because you're thinking, all I got to do is get through Friday.  Yeah.  Tomorrow.  So I could pretty much tear it up a little on Thursday and, you know, phone it in, as  they say.  Phone it in.  You could skate through.  Skate.  Phone it in.  People like to say, I'm going to just skate through this day.  Fake it.  Fake it.  Fake it.  Is a good one.  Yeah.  And the work in Joe has figured out many ways of doing that on a Friday.  I was going to say, remember when you had a real job?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  There are always little tricks to get through the day.  Oh, my God.  I used to actually grab a 10-foot ladder.  Yeah.  I'd climb up and if I was doing a commercial job, hanging ducts, duct work.  Yeah.  And I would climb up on the ladder, lean my arms on top of the ducts, and put my head  down in my arms and nap.  Go to sleep.  Literally standing with my feet on the top of the ladder.  Wow.  But my body weight is on the duct work, so I'm not really resting it on my feet, so I'm  not going to fall. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  And I would just take these little catnaps on top of the duct work.  That's crazy.  And then if I heard like, you know, I'd be like, you know, boom, boom, boom, knock the  duct and be like, yeah, wait, almost two seconds.  Like, I was doing something up there.  Would you find make-believe work?  No, I would just do no work.  Like, did you even have to go up there in the ladder?  Probably, yeah.  I probably had something to do.  You know, I'd put in a fire damper.  Yeah.  Put in a fire damper or something.  Or motorized volume damper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  I remember make-believe work. 
[00:04:00]  Or I'd do something halfway.  Right.  And then sit there.  Like, I'd connect a duct with a drive, they're called, and I'd smash the drive down like halfway  and leave the other half, so I'd sit there.  And then the second someone came by, I'd grab my hammer, bam, bam, bam, bam, I'm working  hard here.  Knock the rest of them down.  Right.  And, yeah, yeah.  I'd be like, all sleepy face.  A seam from the duct is embedded in the side of your face.  Like, drooling.  What?  No, no, I'm working hard.  You got morning voice?  No, it's fine.  Everything's cool.  What?  But those were the days when even the bosses were doing that shit. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly.  Everyone knew.  Everyone knew everyone was just kind of, you know, trying to get through Friday.  Everyone was napping.  Now you got these do-gooders with their cameras everywhere.  There's cameras everywhere.  And glass offices, so you can't even close the door behind you.  Who thought of the glass-walled office?  A fucking nerd.  What an asshole.  You used to be able to go into your office and squeeze your sexy secretary's ass.  That's right.  Pinch your ass a little bit. 
[00:05:00]  She'd be on your knee taking your dictation.  Oh, get in here.  I got a letter you have to take.  How many times have you seen that in old school TV shows and movies?  She's got her legs crossed.  She's sitting on the guy's lap in his big office chair.  And it was completely normal.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got his hand on her back.  Like, well, let me take this letter down.  Oh, Mr. Johnson.  Or she would bend over where her knees don't even bend. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She'd do that bend.  And he'd give her a playful little tap.  And she'd get up real quick and go, oh, Mr. Johnson.  Make me a drink.  Now bosses aren't even allowed to hire hot secretaries.  They all have to be frumps.  Frumps.  You have to hire a frump.  You go to the frump factory.  Frumps.  They have that roll-away bar in their office.  Right.  And it was like fucking nine in the morning and they're drinking.  You watch that show, Mad Men?  You know what?  No. 
[00:06:00]  I'm stupid.  Is that an available box set?  I think it's on Netflix and stuff.  I got to get into this shit.  It's a cool show because it's a piece that's supposed to be in the 60s.  And in the business atmosphere, not like the hippie atmosphere.  I think it's pretty early 60s, maybe in the late 50s.  And every fucking scene, they're smoking like crazy in anywhere.  Doesn't matter where they are.  They could be visiting someone in the hospital and they got a cigarette in their mouth.  And they're drinking constantly.  And that's exactly what the fuck those old days were. 
[00:06:30]  And they're fucking their secretaries.  Right.  And they're in trouble with their wives because they're fucking their secretaries.  It's a great time.  I miss those days.  I wish I was in those days.  If you had a side piece, you hire as a secretary.  Right.  Sexy secretary.  Now you got to hire a frump.  A frump.  A frump.  Typewriters and phones with dials on them.  Sure.  It's a cool...  Yeah, they're all smoking.  It's great.  You know what?  I did see another musical on Broadway. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, did you?  Yes, I did.  And it has a lot to do with what you're talking about here.  Our pal Rob Bartlett, who works for Imus.  Right.  How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.  I guess it's a Broadway show that's been around forever.  Yeah.  Recast, obviously, a million fucking times.  But I think it originally came out in the 50s or the early 60s.  They revive it every so often.  I think it's in that revival category.  I got to tell you, man.  I fucking liked it a lot.  Yeah.  Because Rob Bartlett, he's like, yeah, you got to see me on Broadway.  So I finally went, and I really, really liked it. 
[00:07:30]  And it's everything you're saying.  Yeah.  It's like old school bosses and old school secretaries that are really hot.  And the secretaries talk like all they care about is trying to, you know, get with one  of the guys that is powerful in the company.  That's their whole gig is, you know.  And then you got the floozy secretary that's banging the big boss.  Everyone knows, too, but doesn't say a fucking word.  No, because it's part of the culture.  Those shatty Cathy's back then, you could be fucking your secretary, and everyone in  the office knew it, but they just kind of, you know, maybe they did an eye roll to each 
[00:08:00]  other when the secretary walked by to let everybody know they knew, but no one ratted  anyone out.  No, no.  But now we got these glass offices.  Cameras and lawyers and fucking all kinds of paperwork.  Cameras and lawyers, oh my.  Cameras and lawyers, oh my.  HR.  When HR came in, all that shit went down the shitter.  Mad men didn't have HR.  Fuck that.  They would have laughed at HR.  Oh. 
[00:08:30]  HR.  My ass.  I'm fucking, I'm going to tweak that secretary's nips when she comes in.  I'm giving her purple nurples before she gets on that typewriter.  With these glass offices, it's like being in prison.  And I'm sure someone came up with it because they're like, oh, it just looks nicer.  Yeah, yeah.  It just looks sleek and nice.  And then you get the boss that does rounds like a prison guard.  Like the warden or a guard.  Yeah.  So now they walk up and down because it's a whole line of offices and they just peek  in every office.  Well, Bob seems to have put a poster up on his glass wall. 
[00:09:00]  You can see here.  We can't see in what he's doing.  He's working.  We're going to send a cert team in.  They have these giant canisters of tear gas.  We shove that in first.  Let it loose.  And it makes them pretty compliant when we go in and cuff them.  I hope that's how they.  Am I at work?  I hope that's how they take out bladder one day.  With a cert team?  Yeah, with a cert team.  They just go in and fucking shove that big nozzle in and just tear gas them.  You see snot and tears and saliva's coming out of his mouth.  His hair's all messed up. 
[00:09:30]  No, Steve Blatter had to be brought out with a little bit of force.  We take a video team with us to show that we didn't really abuse the employee.  I hope they take out Greenstein like that, too, for not cleaning the toilets properly.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Bathroom duty.  Well, they were fucking shitty again today, Sam, and I don't know what to do.  With piss or shit on the wall?  No, I haven't seen the shit flakes in a while, but it's that thick urine.  When you get a drop of urine on a toilet seat and you let it dry, it raises up pretty damn high. 
[00:10:00]  It's pretty good, though.  That means people are taking vitamins.  Is that what that's about?  It gets that dark yellowish, and it's almost a crystalline thing when it dries.  Well, Sam, please, when he gets here, tell him, you know, I don't know what's going on with the toilet seats,  but they really need to be cleaned properly.  Thank you.  I'm not going to.  Why?  That's facilities, John.  He's the boss.  He's what boss?  He's like all of our bosses.  No, no.  That's just silly. 
[00:10:30]  My boss, I mean, he's like four bosses above me.  No, that's just silly.  He's your boss.  No, he's not my boss.  No?  No one's the boss of me.  No one.  You ain't the boss of me.  No one.  I think he's your guy's boss.  No, no, he really isn't.  Oh.  He really isn't.  Oh.  So it's Friday.  We got the glass offices.  Yeah.  We got the HR.  We got the frumpy secretaries.  What else we got?  Man, some guy just reminded me of something, though, on PalTalk.  The, when I was working, Joe, there was one building that was, it probably had 20% population. 
[00:11:00]  The rest of it was still being built and the floors were being done.  And it was the Omni building there in, by the, what school is there?  In Uniondale.  Yeah, by Hofstra.  And I used to have to do work in there, and me and a couple of the other guys had the  paint guns, because we used to, you know, play paintball a lot.  And it wasn't the ones you have now, the machine gun ones.  It was the little Nell Spot pistols with the little thing, and you could really kind 
[00:11:30]  of hide them in your toolbox and stuff.  And we used to literally just play Nakatomi Plaza in the building.  No.  Die hard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'd, like, pick teams and play paintball inside when we were supposed to be working.  That's awesome.  And that was a Friday thing.  So you would break for a little paintball action.  Break for some fucking die hard paintball.  Didn't they notice the splatters on the walls?  Oh, yeah, but they didn't know who did it.  The unfinished walls or whatever?  Well, it was unfinished, so it didn't matter.  It wasn't like it was going up on the sheetrock.  It was pretty much just the studs were up and cement. 
[00:12:00]  But once again, back then, you didn't have people that tattled on you to the bosses.  No tattling, no wind, no cameras.  And half the time, the bosses were in on the action.  Yeah.  They wanted a little break.  Nothing was more fun than when your CO2 canister would go, which meant you couldn't fire.  And anybody that did that, the next thing you heard was, oh, God, please don't kill me.  Oh, don't shoot me, you're one of them.  You know, you're playing fucking die hard.  You got to throw in some lines. 
[00:12:30]  Why don't we go to the phones?  Because now people can relate to this.  See what we did there, Sam?  You should be taking notes.  Oh, Sam.  We didn't even know we were going to talk about this.  Hey, Sam's number one in radio, though.  So he's better than we are.  Oh, wow.  Congratulations on that.  Shorty Awards, yeah.  Oh, no, the Shorty Awards again.  Well, he's number one.  Let's not talk about the Shorty Awards, please.  I'm number one in web show, thank you, people.  Keep it rolling.  Keep it rolling.  And Opie wants to be a YouTube star.  Right, YouTube star.  He's working his way up the ladder there.  I really don't.  No, you should be.  Yes, you do.  We're all going to the fucking big gala event award show. 
[00:13:00]  We're all going to sit at a big table.  We're going to rent tuxedos with tails.  Tuxedos.  I want tails.  No.  Tuxedos.  And any of the girls that go with us, gowns.  Gowns.  Gowns.  And I want Eastside Dave in a gown, too, though.  And walking sticks.  Yeah.  Walking sticks?  Yes.  Yes.  Well, at that big table, you're going to be sitting with a couple strangers.  Why?  Because I'm not going to win the YouTube star award.  Oh, you've got to.  Why don't you?  Yeah, you should.  No, you've got to win that one.  You're a big star.  No.  I guarantee you'll be nominated.  No, no, please.  As long as you're in the upper six, you're nominated, so then you show up to see if you're chosen. 
[00:13:30]  Please, this is too much attention, please.  Oh, this is fantastic.  Please, now.  Look at those awards.  Matt in D.C.  Matty.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I just want to say how far off the office world is now from the show Mad Men.  Yeah.  There was a woman that I worked with.  She went through a pretty rough time.  Husband cheated on her.  So she's come to work all messed up, constantly crying.  And when she finally started turning her shit around, she showed up to work one day, kind  of cleaned up, and I just complimented her on the air. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, you look nice today.  Just kind of tried to pick her up.  I fucking, I'm in HR five minutes late now.  It's about 15 minutes later.  I had to go through a week of videos and retraining and tests on what is and what is not acceptable  to the female employer.  You know what?  I got a solution to all that.  Let's move the broads out.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's move them out.  Done with the broads?  Yeah.  Why do they need so much protection?  Yeah.  What's that about?  Hey, she gets all upset when you look at, you know, just say, hey, you look decent today.  And I mean, I can only imagine if you work at a real place, it'd be fucking cool where 
[00:14:30]  you can, like, look at porn on your phone and, like, hey, look at this shit.  We've come a long way, man.  We're all for the days of that.  They ripped out, they ripped all the cool stuff out of our cubicles, right, and our offices.  That's it.  And some companies, and I, maybe Sam can help me on this one for real.  I think there's a policy here.  You're not allowed to date a fellow employee.  I think you have.  Oh, Mars.  Sorry.  I know you asked me.  I think you have to declare it if you're dating. 
[00:15:00]  I do declare what?  You have to declare?  What if you, what if?  And then they go through to find out whether or not it's appropriate or not.  So everyone has to know your business.  That's right.  Well, that's the number one thing here.  What if you're walking down the halls and you fall in love with someone?  Then you have to let the bosses know.  That's insane.  Does that happen?  That's appropriate.  Walking down the halls and you fall in love with someone.  Dude, well.  I love you.  I love you.  Well, you know what?  It happens.  Yeah.  So in this place, if that happens, you have to report it to everybody. 
[00:15:30]  You have to report it.  That's what happened between me and who, kid?  Yeah.  Just walking down the halls and one day we realize.  Mutual ass kissing, maybe.  Do you think he's been on the after show a little too much, though?  It was a few days in a row.  I'm getting a nod from Mars.  And I like that.  Mars gets jealous because he wants to be on the after show every day.  Well, that's not happening.  No.  But can you imagine it?  Yeah.  You decide you're kind of like, you've got those butterfly feelings.  You see someone at your job and now. 
[00:16:00]  You're smitten?  You're smitten.  And now you're scared you might lose your job.  So now you've got to tell everyone how smitten you are with the broad.  Can I submit a smitten form?  Yeah.  A smitten report?  I need...  You've got to get your smitten report in or else this relationship is null and void or you're going to be terminated.  Because they have to find out whether or not it's a conflict of interest.  With what?  In case it's a supervisor.  It's none of their business.  How about it's none of their business?  What base have you gotten to? 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Second base.  Yeah.  Where I work at, if you're dating...  Thanks.  I didn't even know you were still here.  I know.  How are you still here, Matt?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Where I'm at, I know that you have to go, you and whoever you're with, you have to report to HR,  you fill out paperwork, and they bring in your department head to make sure that everything is smooth  and that there's not going to be a problem, and then how do you properly handle a breakup and work?  And it's like the old system in Scotland.  Actually, the boss has to have sex first with the girl, like in Braveheart. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  See, he has to go in and actually have sex first with her, and then you're able to have an inter-office relationship.  But the only way to avoid that is if the girl doesn't hold, like, a handkerchief.  Yes, first night.  And they won't actually know.  Sure.  Yes, yes.  Or they slit her throat.  I must say, we've become completely insane in this country.  It really is ridiculous.  We have overthought everything.  Everything.  Everything.  It should be easy. 
[00:17:30]  Like, you can't, maybe you don't want the whole world to know that you just got smitten with someone.  And I'm not talking about cheating shit.  I'm talking about just regular fucking, you fall for somebody.  Now you're scared you might lose your jobs.  Now you've got to go to HR.  Now they're completely in your fucking business.  How do they find out?  What happens in an inter-office relationship where people then do find out?  Is it somebody, a close friend that rats or says something?  Is it you being a little overzealous in the fucking snack room and grabbing a little ass and somebody sees it? 
[00:18:00]  Right.  How do people actually find out when you're trying to keep it on the QT?  You can't take it on the QT because you're scared you're going to lose your gig.  Yeah.  So I think most people just come forward immediately like, oh my God, I got to tell people.  I think people lose it.  They just can't fucking contain themselves.  Yeah.  Copy room.  How many copy room fucking blowjobs have gone down?  Ah, shit, man.  I know in here I've had to brush my teeth many a time after I, oh, wait a minute.  Many a time.  Yeah.  Wow, really?  I didn't know that was going on.  Most policies in companies these days are just set up to avoid lawsuits. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  Like that's the number one goal of any company.  It has nothing to do with anyone's best interest except for the company.  Is it good for the company?  Right.  Is it good for the company?  Hang the banner up.  I feel bad for people that have just regular jobs.  It used to be all right.  It used to be kind of a social thing.  Yeah.  You would get some work done, but you socialize.  You're single.  You're working all the girls in the office seeing who's, you know, down to DTF, right? 
[00:19:00]  DTF, yo.  I want to talk like the kids today.  Yeah.  Jersey Shore, yo.  Right.  Jersey Shore, yo, indeed.  I don't think I've ever had an inter-workplace relationship, but the places I've worked, there's  probably been like two girls there.  Yeah.  One working in the office and the other one, you didn't find out she was a girl until probably  two months in on the job.  I was, God, I'm calling out someone today.  I was banging the business manager at a radio station I was working at. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  I was just a young little kid.  A little young buck.  And I think she was already well into her 30s.  Oh, Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?  She had to be 10 years older than me.  Yeah.  And then I'm like, I was full-time, but not really.  I was making like $12,000 a year.  And she was like, she was like really important at this radio station.  How did the hookup happen?  Just at an event, all drunk and shit.  At a drunken event. 
[00:20:00]  Ah, radio of old.  But then, this woman.  Did you get her pregnant?  Did she have to have an abortion?  Oh, God, we'll get into that.  Whoopsie.  We'll get into that.  We got more info on Greg Kelly.  Oh, boy.  I'm staying strong for Greg Kelly.  I am, too.  I'm staying strong for this guy.  I believe him.  There's some suspicious shit going on here.  Yes, there is.  And now he's saying that he's got text messages to prove that it was all on the up and up.  Text messages?  Because no one saves those.  Ooh.  Well, Greg Kelly, he's the host of what? 
[00:20:30]  Fox?  Good Day, New York.  Good Day, New York.  I can't get those two right.  New York Fox affiliate.  And meets a girl on the street.  Nab drinks.  She invites him back to the office.  Because I don't think he would invite himself back to her office, right?  Right.  Because you can't do that.  You can't just tag along like that.  And then they end up having sex in her office.  And then three months later, she walks into a precinct.  This Greg Kelly is the son of Ray Kelly.  The police commissioner here in New York.  And says Greg Kelly raped her.  Whoa. 
[00:21:00]  And now it's coming out that she was pregnant.  That she got pregnant.  And then she had one of those abortions.  Right?  Well, because the boyfriend...  What time this week am I going to do that Damone impression?  I like it though.  A lot of abortions this week.  But her boyfriend basically knew it wasn't his because he had a vasectomy.  Yeah.  So it seems like some shit hit the fan back at the homestead.  And now she had to claim all sorts of shit.  It has all the benchmarks of the boyfriend finding out, getting pissed, and her scrambling for an excuse.  And boy, that rape. 
[00:21:30]  That is quite the excuse.  Right.  And of course, we sound like the caveman guy saying, ah, she's full of shit.  And in this case, what information we've heard, it kind of adds up like maybe she's not being quite forthright.  Here's the problem.  She's pushing out stuff every day to the media.  Pushing something out of her vagina.  An abortion.  Whoa.  And this Greg Kelly has to sit there and shut his fucking mouth.  Yep.  So no one's really speaking up for him because it's really...  I don't think it's really popular to take the stance we're taking. 
[00:22:00]  No.  And we could be completely wrong.  And then at that point, we'll be absolutely crucified by people.  Of course.  But we got to at least play the other side here a little bit.  Even as...  Something is suspicious here.  Even as his buddies, co-stars on Good Day New York,  their comments have been like, well, we love him.  And that's really all I could say right now.  Like, hey, we like the guy.  That's as far as I'm going.  As far as protecting him or giving a comment. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Let me see.  Greg Kelly claims...  This is the latest right here.  Greg!  We'll get back to the business matter.  Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about that.  It was really quick.  She was...  Go back and forth.  She would be an animal on Friday and Saturday nights.  And then on Monday, I had to go back to my lame ass.  I'm just starting out in radio.  Oh, would she boss you around?  Nah, nah.  Because she was in the business department.  Oh, okay.  And she was like this, you know, well-to-do fucking high-powered person.  Well, she needed some dick.  She wanted your dick. 
[00:23:00]  I didn't report that shit to HR, Sam.  I wasn't reporting that shit.  No?  No fucking way.  You didn't report that dick.  It was no one's business.  The paralegal who says TV host and top cop son Greg Kelly raped her while she was drunk  told cops she got pregnant and had an abortion as a result.  Why'd you do that, she says.  She angrily demanded a call to the Fox Newsman after the late-night encounter in her downtown  Manhattan law office.  God, a lot of info in one fucking sentence there.  Kelly, the popular co-host of Good Day New York and son of police commissioner Raymond Kelly 
[00:23:30]  claims flirtatious text messages from the woman show their rendezvous was consensual  and for a sexual purpose, sources said.  Wow.  This could be the big key, one investigator told the Daily News on Tuesday.  Unless she taped the phone call, whether this guy gets charged could be determined by  the text messages.  Yeah, that's a pretty big charge.  The accusation's bad enough.  If they charge him, wow.  That's pretty bad.  I don't know, I just see this as, you know, there's too many other things going on in 
[00:24:00]  this case that kind of seem like, eh.  No source says they exchanged texts about doing it again.  Hmm.  You know.  Unless he wrote, can I rape you again?  Yeah.  Maybe, you know, if it's that text, then.  That could be a problem.  He's in some hot water.  Yeah.  I'm going to.  What's the matter?  I'm going to say that, I'm going to, I don't think there's going to be any charges in the 
[00:24:30]  I don't think they're going to charge him either.  But this is such an unpopular thing to say.  There's women out there right now yelling at the fucking radio.  I don't blame you.  Yeah, I don't blame you, but I don't know.  Something.  A nutty woman yells at her radio.  We can't hear you.  I know.  You adult.  You dumb woman.  Stupid.  You stupid, stupid woman.  Oh.  But there's something fishy about this.  Right?  Yeah, there is.  It just doesn't add up.  And there's too many things that do add up.  The boyfriend being mad. 
[00:25:00]  The boyfriend confronting Ray Kelly at an appearance once.  Right.  And saying, your son ruined my girlfriend's life.  Right.  Yeah.  That sounds a little like she might have embellished the story of their rendezvous.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  And we've said, I mean, if after you're having drinks with someone and then you invite them  back to your office.  Yeah.  There's, I think there's an understanding there to begin with.  I think, yeah.  That, you know, there might be some, some sexual feelings going on.  Something's going on. 
[00:25:30]  There's some sex in the air and you're like, wow, boy, you know, and this lady's going,  oh shit, my boyfriend's at home.  They're not collating.  No.  In the office.  Right?  No.  They're not filing.  No.  So, I don't know.  When you invite someone back to your office after some beverages, there's going to be  some fucking going on.  I do recall in the old NEW whorehouse, that whorehouse, there was a lot of fucking that  went on in our office and the Ron and Fez office. 
[00:26:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  The Ron and Fez office.  The Ron and Fez office.  There were some peripheral players that were doing some office fucking.  Really?  After some nights out, a night out of town.  You know what I mean?  Stinky.  Yeah.  There were things going on.  I didn't do shit.  Oh.  Hey.  I did some of that office fucking.  You did?  It was great.  Oh.  What's better than office fucking? 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  You got it.  It's all awkward because the fucking chair rolls and then you try to do that desk blotter  slides on the desk and you're like, I don't know how to do this office fucking.  But then you get through it.  Did you ever do it in someone else's chair and then the next day when they sat down in  the chair and go, ha ha ha, that's right.  No, I did the old sit in the chair and have the girl, you know, do the kind of on top  thing.  Oh, and the office chair is bouncy, bouncy.  Yeah, yeah, they bounced.  So it's kind of cool.  But then right there where it would be between your legs on the chair, ah, that never goes 
[00:27:00]  away cum stain from the dribble.  Am I being a little too open here?  Everything just dripping out?  Yeah, yeah.  My best memory of the office was when that one-armed bitch came back to the office once.  Ah, the slot machine we used to call her.  And she was all, she was all like, you know.  Hey, where's slot machine?  She was all drunk and shit.  Yes, she was.  And then someone noticed that her tampon string was sticking out.  Yeah, we took a picture of it.  And started taking pictures of it. 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  Under the desk.  Were they upskirts?  Were we doing upskirts?  We were doing upskirts.  She was sitting at your desk.  Are you sure we were doing upskirts?  And from my desk, I could tilt my camera underneath the desk and take upskirts of her.  Oh, you got the picture?  Yeah.  I took some upskirts of her.  With a tampon string.  And her tampon string was coming out.  And her lips were weird.  It looked like her lips were sideways doing a Bill Murray from Caddyshack.  Moo.  Moo.  One lip was kind of moo.  It was probably... 
[00:28:00]  And then the string was hanging out.  Ah, it was probably, you know, how she was sitting.  Yeah.  A vagina like Carl Spagler.  Yeah, with a tampon string.  And then we'd pass the picture around just laughing like idiots.  Like we're still 12 years old.  Yes.  Yes.  We were grown men at the time.  We were.  But, yeah, some office fucking went on in that when we got that office, too.  Yeah, there were...  I was talking about the small office first.  And then we got that big office.  Oh, I don't remember any of this.  Remember the big office that we got?  Oh, yeah, I remember the big office. 
[00:28:30]  Once Gary Wall got the boot.  Oh, right.  We stepped right into his palatial palace.  It was like when they got Saddam.  Right.  We just went into there.  We rolled in.  We did roll in.  With fuck in it.  Oh, everyone was fucking in that office.  Oh, man.  It was crazy.  W-N-E fuck-le-you.  All right.  Might not have worked, but...  Jeez.  Perfect.  I know there was a party going on in the office almost every night.  Yes.  A lot of booze.  A lot of parties.  Three refrigerators filled with beer.  Yeah.  And now we got the glass offices. 
[00:29:00]  See, we bring it right back around, Sam.  We didn't have glass offices back then, man.  We could shut that door.  I remember bosses banging on the door.  I'm like, no, we're not coming out today.  Just a minute.  What the fuck?  And all you're hearing is clang, clang, clang, clang balls.  They're like prohibition.  Yeah.  Like that scene in Animal House when Dean...  Yeah, yeah.  Dean Wormer comes in.  ...comes in and everyone is just sheepishly hiding all their booze.  No alcoholic beverages when they're on probation.  Right.  You've been on double secret probation.  But remember the days, like, we'd be in some world of hurt with the company, maybe because 
[00:29:30]  we talked about Howard too much or some dumb thing.  Yeah, back in the day.  And that always used to drive Howard nuts.  And then our bosses had to get involved.  And we would just be in our offices, lock the door, and they would be pouting on the office.  We got to talk about this.  Yeah, we're prepping for the show.  Show prep.  We're prepping for the show.  Ah.  Psh.  Ah. 
[00:30:00]  Beer.  Plenty of it.  Yep, yep, yep.  Ronnie was talking about that yesterday.  Was he?  Yeah, he was talking about how, you know, the morning drive thing here now, because he did  the show last Friday, and it's a lot different.  There's no crossover.  However, on a Friday, a typical Friday, was doing the show from 3 to 7, drinking the whole  time, going back to the office, having a few beverages, and then just wheeling into  Ron and Fez's show.  Rolling.  And drinking there, hijinks and shenanigans going on there, and then occasionally hanging 
[00:30:30]  out for Eddie Trunk's show after that.  Didn't you want to go home?  Still drinking.  Why would I want to go home to that nightmare?  No.  If you made a Teddy Trunk, that means you were tying on a good one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  And I think we officially had the first man cave.  That was a man cave.  As much as we make fun of man caves.  Yeah.  But see, our man caves involved women.  Oh, right.  Like a man cave would be a place where you could do manly stuff, such as fucking girls. 
[00:31:00]  Fucking girls.  Some fucking was going on.  Why put together such a nice place and not have women there?  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  We had a foosball table.  We had pinball machines.  Well, for a little while.  I remember during fucking commercial breaks, having quick games of foosball during commercial  breaks, smoking in the building.  Right.  Fucking cigarettes on the edge of the foosball table.  Come on, motherfucker.  Wow.  Drink.  Beer.  It was like you were in a bar for eight minutes, three times, every hour. 
[00:31:30]  It was amazing.  Yeah.  You were in a bar.  And then the bosses weren't even allowed to come down the hall.  We wouldn't let them after a while.  When they were in the building, that was a thing, too, because the company had cut back  so much, they had the bosses for our station.  We're also the bosses of stations all over the country.  Well, in our case.  So they'd have to fly around the country to see what the other stations were doing.  So we were just one of many.  They might pop in.  In our case, our two main bosses also ran Washington and Philly. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Well, I guess one of the bosses works here.  I don't know.  He makes believe we never worked together.  Oh, yeah.  He kind of nods at me like, oh, are you a new employee?  I'm like, no, we work together, you idiot.  And the only reason you have a job here is because of your time with Opie and Anthony.  How about you start acknowledging that?  Yeah.  He just nods like, wait, did we?  Yeah, we did.  Yes.  Oh, God.  We did.  What's wrong with that guy?  So when you would hang out after the show, it wouldn't be like bosses coming in and saying,  well, if you're going to hang around, we'll schedule some meetings. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, God.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, because you guys were talking about how we just don't have that.  There's an hour buffer between the Ron and Fez show and our show.  I don't know what happens during that hour, but people said it sucks.  And then, so there's no crossover time.  There's no like Ronnie coming in, sitting down, us like, you know, goofing on our respective interns and things.  No, I think we should start the show at 7 so we could do that crossover magic again.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I'm thinking that's what we should do.  Wasn't that a thought before, too?  Yeah.  The problem is it doesn't help me one iota.  I would leave earlier.  You would sleep a little later.  But I couldn't because I would be in traffic.  The traffic between that change in traffic from 6 to 7 is huge.  You would sleep better.  I'd have to get up at pretty much the same time.  I wouldn't be saving time.  You would sleep a little longer.  Just a little longer.  Not an hour longer.  You would think it's like if we are on an hour later, I could push everything back an hour.  Nuh-uh. 
[00:33:30]  Wouldn't work.  How about if you push it a half hour?  It's not worth it.  Half hour for an hour more.  I don't like it.  An hour more what?  Well, an hour.  Don't say an hour more radio.  No.  It just doesn't.  It's not enough sleep for having to stay later.  How about we split the difference?  6.30 start.  Now we're talking.  That could work.  Now we're talking.  As long as we could still leave at 10.  Yeah.  I mean.  Yeah, we could do that.  I like that.  Three and a half hour show.  All right.  Let's do that.  Yeah.  And then we'd do a half hour respectively when we all get home in our various outlets. 
[00:34:00]  Who's going to tell us no?  Who's going to tell us no?  Yeah.  6.30 start.  So how much later is that?  Well, we start.  I swear to God.  We start at 6.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're scheduled from 6 to 10.  Okay.  I won't argue that.  Meh.  Yeah.  We start our show at 6 and get out of here.  You know.  And sometimes we go after 10.  So we're giving them more radio some days.  That's true.  Meh.  Sometimes before 10.  Oh, no.  Not really. 
[00:34:30]  Maybe today.  But there's an exception.  I got things to do today.  Oh, I think.  I am not giving them.  Huh?  I am not giving them an iota of extra time today.  No.  It is Friday, motherfucker.  What if Donald Jr. wants to chat longer?  Did you say?  I don't know what time is money.  Wait.  Did you say Friday?  Oh, wow.  We do got to get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Weekend.  Friday.  Friday. 
[00:35:00]  Getting down on Friday.  Yeah.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Party and party and party and party and party and party and fun.  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, party, party, party.  This Newt Gingrich, Ant.  I don't know why, but I'm all in, man.  I've been watching every single one of these debates.  Yeah.  I'm kind of enjoying the political process this time around. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And Newt wants to be a moon man.  I like it.  Ground control to make sure.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Not Boboey.  Where's my fucking moon man song?  Newt Gingrich wants to fucking build a colony on the moon.  A problem?  He's trying to do a JFK thing to rally the troops.  Let me tell you something.  It's only the weak-minded, short-sighted shitheads that say,  A moon base? 
[00:36:00]  What is it?  Fucking in Star Trek?  What is it?  It's like you could have the end game, which is a base on the moon.  That's fine.  But everything that leads up to that gives this country industry, innovation that we've never seen before.  The space program of this country has given us more inventions and more of the things we use on a daily basis that are miracles to our modern society than any other program. 
[00:36:30]  It's amazing what the space program has given us.  Tang.  Tang, for the fuck's sake.  Tang.  Powdered orange juice.  Stop it.  Right.  It's amazing.  We would have never had that.  Velcro.  Velcro is a fucking NASA thing.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yes.  So when you say...  What are some of those other things?  Well, how about computers?  Smaller computers?  Smaller computers.  Yeah.  How about heat-sensitive rap in my law? 
[00:37:00]  Really?  How about...  Sorry, maybe you will change your opinion on NASA.  Uh-huh.  It says they did not invent Tang.  No, they did.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Everyone knows they did.  They just took it with them.  Yeah, the astronauts needed a little tasty drink.  The space program is something that makes...  It does make jobs, especially not just NASA-related jobs.  It's industry.  It's people thinking and inventing things and producing them,  and then getting them into the civilian market. 
[00:37:30]  It's what made this country amazingly great in that post-war era.  And it did so much for this country, yet people just go,  Oh, space base.  What do you think?  You just fucking send a ship up with some fucking housing, and that's it?  No.  You've got to think these things out.  That's the shit everybody's been talking about.  This country doesn't make anything anymore.  We fucking look for other countries to build things for us. 
[00:38:00]  We just have virtual products these days.  Well, that's something that would spark a new renaissance in technology  and building here in this country.  What's so wrong about that?  I ask you.  Well, Mitt Romney doesn't like it, and I thought Mitt was your guy.  Oh, fuck Mitt Romney, too.  I don't know who my guy is in this mess.  I kind of like Newt.  Don't you want...  I like his honesty and openness, and he doesn't take bullshit. 
[00:38:30]  He's not perfect.  I don't want a perfect fucking president.  Jesus Christ, God knows we don't have one now.  Do you want a do-over?  Do-over, do-over.  I think some of you Republicans would love a do-over,  where they just wipe the stage clean and bring out four new guys.  Like when you don't get good letters in Scrabble?  Yeah, something like that.  You can just reach back into the bag?  Right.  I don't know.  I don't have enough vowels.  Let's do a do-over.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think it's crazy that Newt's saying that.  It's really deeply depressing that we're middle-aged men 
[00:39:00]  because we understand the space program.  We grew up with this shit.  It was a huge part of the country.  And now they don't do any of it, and they're just letting it die.  It's so depressing.  It was invention.  It was pride in this country.  It was the space program.  It was something to aspire to as a kid.  It just was something so amazing in so many ways.  They got a lot of these feel-good projects that are supposed to give us pride in the country,  yet they don't produce anything, and they're phony. 
[00:39:30]  Right there, there's this little crust of pride with nothing inside.  The space program gave the country pride, and it was full of so many good things, jobs,  and like I said, technology, easier living for people,  things that we never would have dreamed of that came to fruition  and were directly brought out to the public to use and to make our lives easier and better.  Just amazing things.  And the government fucked up the space program, making everything just ridiculously expensive. 
[00:40:00]  They couldn't manage their own funds, and unfortunately they had to cut that.  It got fucked up, but it was cut for the wrong reasons.  It wasn't looked into enough where things could be cut so we can continue.  And now, in order to get to a space station that we pretty much built,  the International Space Station, we have to hitch rides with a Soviet fucking Soyuz craft,  an ancient piece of shit.  That's just embarrassing.  It is embarrassing.  We have no means of getting an American in space in an American spacecraft. 
[00:40:30]  It's embarrassing.  Unbelievable.  Well, people would say, yeah, but there's bigger problems with America  than worrying about going to the moon.  But those problems, a lot of them, not all of them, but a lot of them,  they don't understand this also, can be solved,  or at least a buffer put in place by the space program, the jobs.  It gets jobs.  It gets contracts with the government.  It gets new inventions and innovations that then open up new businesses. 
[00:41:00]  It just, there are a lot of things that happen with the space program,  and it's proven over the years that this does work.  Would you be able to live on the moon?  I don't know.  Let me think.  As a kid, I was a lot more fascinated with it and would have given you an instant yes.  Yeah.  But now I'm just like, you know, can I shoot?  Can I drive a Mustang?  And where are the chicks?  Would the shade bother you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's one thing that the moon doesn't have right now that I kind of like. 
[00:41:30]  Well, you know what I'm talking about.  Oh, the other side of the craters.  You know that place.  Yeah.  Does the moon have, like, real sunny days, or is it all just shadowy all the time?  Well, there's only one dark side and one light side.  It never changes.  Like here, we have night and day.  I know that much.  The moon is bright on one side and dark on the other side all the time.  So, if you could live on that cusp area between lightness and darkness, between things and  ideas, you've now crossed over into the twilight zone. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Is it possible to take one step and be in pitch dark darkness where you don't see shit?  No.  Or is it subtle?  I don't think one step.  I don't think it's like a carpenter snapped a line there on the moon.  There's a fuzzy area.  A fuzzy area.  A dusk area.  Okay.  Yeah.  And that, you would probably have to make your bases on there.  And then some of your resources for heating could be done on the brighter side.  And then for cooling, could be done closer to the darker side.  Right.  And you could even it out where the temperature wouldn't be that bad on the dusk. 
[00:42:30]  But what kind of sun do they get?  On the dusk.  They get direct sunlight.  Direct sunlight.  So it's nice and bright there?  Very bright on the bright side.  Very dark on the dark side.  Oh, boy.  So you have to set up your base.  But because the moon doesn't change, the light and dark side doesn't change, that dusk area could be settled.  You could settle in that dusk area and not have to worry about the extremes in temperature.  Well, Mitt Romney doesn't want the moon base. 
[00:43:00]  Mitt is an idiot if he doesn't want a moon base.  And Newt thinks it would be a nice thing.  Space inventions.  Space inventions!  Because of the space program, we got memory foam.  We got cell phone cameras.  Cell phone cams.  We got UV-protected sunglasses.  Sunglasses.  We wouldn't have ever seen that Blue Blockers commercial.  We got CAT scans and MRIs.  See?  We got the microchip.  What's that?  What's that? 
[00:43:30]  Cordless tools because of the space program.  Micro.  Get it?  Yeah.  Yes, cordless tools.  The joystick.  Ah.  Joystick.  We'd be playing those fucking Commodore 64 games back in the day.  The ear thermometer.  Thank God.  Because, you know, getting it in the ass like that is not fun.  You'd have been laying on your belly getting a thermometer in your ass if we were in for  the space program.  That's right.  It's also the mouth.  Yes.  Oh, well, my mom, I guess, didn't know that.  Yeah.  Uh, satellite TV. 
[00:44:00]  Ah, yes.  Scratch-resistant lenses.  See?  Scratch-off tickets.  What?  No.  What?  It isn't there.  Oh.  And smoke detectors.  Smoke detectors.  There's a bunch of them.  Most of the parts of the iPhone were invented by NASA.  By NASA!  Is that true?  Well, I mean, scratch-resistant lenses, camera phones, uh, microchips, these are all...  What's that?  I like microchip.  Uh, you want to hear the exchange that happened last night with, uh, Romney and Newt? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  They were both ornery last night.  Yeah, yeah.  Although, uh, Newt, uh, Newt had a bad night.  Did he?  Newt seemed to be in another place.  Yeah, he's usually a lot more aggressive, and he, he allowed too much shit to go down  last night.  Pat from Monaki is saying, uh, another thing we got.  I dream of Jeannie.  I dream of fucking Jeannie.  NASA.  Let's continue that list.  Major Nelson was, uh...  Sam, we haven't made a list in a while.  Let's do this.  Okay.  Make sure you have the, uh, scratch-off lottery tickets and the I dream of Jeannie. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know about that.  Huh?  I don't know about the scratch-off tickets, but it's I dream of Jeannie.  I'm going with scratch-off tickets.  That's a mic, right?  Huh?  That's a mic in front of your face?  Yeah.  I'll put it down.  Thank you.  Anybody else want to add to the list?  Uh, just, just do it.  Oh, what about the food, the freeze-dried food you can get at the museum?  Ah, freeze-dried ice cream.  Freeze-dried, uh, yeah, Napolitano or whatever.  Baby food.  Baby food in general.  When we were growing up, man, our parents had to cook that shit on a stove. 
[00:45:30]  Now you just have these, like, uh, you don't know this stuff, Ant.  What's that?  These little, uh, baby food, uh, pouches.  And they mix up all sorts of shit in there, and they just squeeze it in their mouth, just  like an astronaut would.  Yep.  Baby fucking food.  Mmm.  Can you write fucking?  That's just about to.  All right, thank you.  So, uh, Mitt and Newt went at it last night, sort of.  Yeah.  Newt, uh, I think had a bad night.  Did he?  I think Romney looked really good last night, and, uh, I don't really care who, who gets 
[00:46:00]  the nomination.  At this point.  I don't know.  I just feel, and I don't know shit about politics, I just feel like there had to be  better guys than the ones you're watching every night.  Yeah.  There had to be.  Mm-hmm.  There's gotta be.  That's, that's my dumb fucking two cents.  But we are, uh...  Santorum looked pretty good, by the way.  Did he?  For the first time, yeah.  Came across as a little more of a, uh...  Yeah, instead of trying to fucking...  Of course, to be reckoned with.  Instead of trying to convince everyone, you know, that he could be the President of the  United States, he finally just said shit. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Because half the time, he's, it seems like he's just trying to convince people.  Right.  Uh, so here's the exchange that happened, uh, um, about, uh, Romney's money.  Ooh.  Uh, tax returns.  Let me bring this to Speaker Gingrich.  By the way, someone has to say it.  Wolf Blitzer is a cunt.  Thank you.  He's trying to fucking make situations.  Oh, could you, could, could, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Can we go back to Matt in Jacksonville?  I want to know what he says.  Anna's wrong.  The moon has night and day.  Uh, uh, line four. 
[00:47:00]  I don't think it has night and day.  Let's see what's going on here.  Sure.  Hi, Matt from Jacksonville.  Sure.  You're on the air.  Please enlighten me, sir.  All right.  So the reason people think there's a light on our side, because it rotates at the same  speed that it orbits the earth.  So there's always one side facing the earth, but it still has night and day like the earth.  Just because we don't see the backside doesn't mean it's not getting light.  So when, uh, uh, you know what?  I am an idiot because the quarter moon, when you get a half moon, half moon, half, see the 
[00:47:30]  same side faces us all the time, but it does.  You are correct, sir.  God damn it.  Really?  I totally had a, and I know this, but I totally had a fucking brain fart.  Wait, what is he saying?  I was thinking more of the planet Mercury, which, uh, is, is completely, uh, does the  same thing.  But since the, the, the moon goes around the earth, I was thinking how Mercury goes around  the sun the same way. 
[00:48:00]  And it has one side that's constantly, uh, lit and one side that's constantly dark.  The moon does not.  I am a dick bag and I know it.  Yes.  I don't even care if you take that soundbite.  I am a dick bag and I know it.  I'm sorry, sir.  You're right.  Apology.  You're right.  Ah, ah, ah, forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  He's wrong. 
[00:48:30]  He's wrong.  He's wrong.  Anthony.  Here comes big, dumb Anthony.  Here comes big, dumb.  All right.  Relax.  Here comes dick bag Anthony.  Oh, wait a minute.  You said it.  I know.  Just checked my Twitter, spyguy925.  Uh, please.  We got to add butt plugs to the list.  Uh, butt plugs?  Butt.  Uh, shark plugs.  Butt plugs.  Bug box?  NASA invented.  The butt plug?  Butt plugs.  I don't know about that.  They, they absolutely did. 
[00:49:00]  Bug blocks?  What are you looking for, sir?  What are you looking for, sir?  Could E-Rock play that to break?  We haven't played that in years.  Butt plug.  We used to be the kings of prank calls.  Spark plug.  Right.  I get it.  No, butt plug.  Bug box?  I love that bug box.  It's like, what's a bug box anyway?  Jeez, that guy was dumb.  So what's our list so far?  What's our NASA list?  That's why we have to go to the moon.  Okay, we're going memory foam, cell phone cameras, UV protected sunglasses, 
[00:49:30]  CAT scans and MRIs, microchips, cordless tools, the joystick, ear thermometer, satellite TV,  scratch resistant lenses, smoke detectors, I dream of a genie, scratch off lotto tickets,  freeze dried ice cream from the museum, baby fucking food, and butt plugs.  Damn, that list is strong from top to bottom, man.  This show would not exist on this fucking platform.  That's right.  Satellite radio.  Invented Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  Part de.  We are part of the wonderfulness. 
[00:50:00]  Should we play Bobo Man?  It's a confirmed hit.  Yeah, but we got butt plugs now, too.  Butt plug?  We could play both.  That way, it'll take up more time.  Oh, fuck.  God damn.  Now you're thinking like we are.  Hey, Friday.  That's all we want to do.  God, you're finally on the same level as us.  We want to party and party.  What should we play first?  I would say Bobo Man first.  All right.  In honor of us going to the moon, if Newt has it his way, we've got our own space song. 
[00:50:30]  It's a confirmed, confirmed hit.  That's what I'm hearing.  I got a message on Facebook from Bobo.  You got one, too.  I got one, yeah, because apparently he was talking with somebody who may have been a problem.  And Bobo wanted to let me know that there's no connection.  He didn't know anything.  He's not affiliated with this person, anything, nothing like that.  And I just didn't answer him.  No.  Why would I answer Bobo? 
[00:51:00]  He wrote Travis and me as well, the lyrics to his...  Helter Skelter.  To his Giants song.  Oh, he's got a Giants song?  Which I know is getting very popular these days.  Oh, I saw one last night on the video.  I hope we should play the audio to that one.  Yeah.  Maybe after the break.  A little guy called Eastside Dave decided to make a Giants Patriots song.  He's a big Giants fan.  Yes, yes, he is.  He hosts a sports show on this channel.  Yes, he does.  And I got to tell you...  Really?  When? 
[00:51:30]  Saturday night.  Oh, I didn't know this.  At 7.  Oh, that's cool.  Aside from the Super Bowl shuffle, I got to say, this is probably one of the best Super  Bowl songs I've ever heard in my life.  It's honest, it's open, and it's Davey Mack.  Does he yell and fall down in this video?  Yes, and he curses.  That's a Dave video.  I like when you can identify it.  It's like seeing a Spielberg movie and knowing he directed it just by how it looks.  There are both sucks and fucks.  Right.  We'll do that after the break? 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Dave rules.  Because every radio show that matters, they have a Super Bowl song.  So we have to figure out whether Dave's song or Bobo's song is going to be...  We've got to embrace something.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to latch on to something.  We've only got, what, nine days left before that big game.  The big game, as they say.  The big game.  When you can't say Super Bowl.  Here's Bobo Man in honor of Newt Gingrich wanting to go to the moon.  That's so fresh.  Bobo Man to O&A. 
[00:52:30]  Bobo Man to O&A.  Let me on the show.  Just let me right back on.  10.  Bobo Man to O&A.  3, 7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3. 
[00:53:00]  This is Bobo Man to O&A.  I swear that I'm not dead.  Won't you let me just do something on the air? 
[00:53:30]  My dog's name, Mr. Maloonigans, I swear.  This is O&A to Bobo Man.  We think you're really great.  Even though your dick is small and you seem gay. 
[00:54:00]  But they won't let me come back on their damn show.  I'm not lying, sorry about that.  Bobo Man's not dead.  No matter what the haters said. 
[00:54:30]  Don't let me in.  Come back.  Though my IQ's in a double digits 
[00:55:00]  I'm smart enough to know  It's okay to do things when it's for the show  Mr. Maloonigans, I love you very much  I blow him  Bobo Man to ONA  Your show needs help, there's something wrong

[01:01:30]  Yesterday  In honor of Demi Moore doing Whippets  Right  Travis played Whippet  Whippet  And he decided not to go with the Devo version  Just to mix it up a little bit  Right  Had nothing to do with the song  We knew the song  We knew the song  Uh, the, the, the  It was topical  Because it was in the news  And it didn't have a direct link  You had to think about it a little bit  Right  Really  Oh  What, you mad?  Really?  No  So  So today you're playing something for Vietnam 
[01:02:00]  Obviously  Again  With the Vietnam  Again with the Vietnam  Enough about the Nam  Right  I'm trying to forget it  We just did Vietnam  We just did Vietnam two days ago  Yeah  Well it ain't going away  Oh man  No it did go away  It's gone  It's over  Sergeant Barnes  Vietnam peace accords were signed in Paris 39 years ago  But this song is about how, you know  Iraq's sergeant should have lived in a barn  Yeah  Isn't that  That's what put the big cows  Isn't that song about, uh, fucking  You know, if you're not a senator's son

No, well  I'm constantly gambling  I either got to up my gambling  Yeah  I like Bregada  Because now they're going to be like  Oh, man, why are you talking?  I do like the Bregada  But I also like places where you have other things to do 
[01:09:30]  When you're in between rounds of gambling  I gamble, then I drink  Then I go back to the room  And crap out  Wake up  Drink a little more in the room  To prep up to go gamble some more  By the way, we got Donald Trump Jr. coming in today  Donald Trump Jr.  He's officially taking over Jim Norton's spot for the day  That's pretty cool  And there's excitement in the air  Excitement in the air  And how he was tweeting last night 
[01:10:00]  I wanted to call him and go  What are you doing?  You're Donald Trump's son  You've got a show on NBC  So I guess I've got to bring my best tranny material  Yeah, did he say that?  And I love that he's tweeting that  But I'm thinking about him  And how that could affect his fine career  Well, I've read many of his tweets  And I like the honesty there  He doesn't care  He'll write shit that might not be politically correct  You know, for a joke  He'll do it  But in all fairness  If he had the type of money he did  Would you care? 
[01:10:30]  No  What are they going to do to him?  He's got a lot of that disposable income  They call it  The FU money  Disposable income  Yeah  Just throw that away  That's why it's called disposable income  You got a good tweet from Donald Trump Jr.?  I would think, like you said  He was watching what he's saying  And making sure he doesn't piss anybody off  But he just wrote  Pat Sajak admits to having been drunk once on Wheel of Fortune  Really?  I'd have to be drunk every time to do that job  And not kill myself  Truth is the truth 
[01:11:00]  You know what?  Alright, good segue  We got the clip  Pat Sajak  Of course he was drinking  That's got to be the most boring job  In the entertainment business  He didn't say he was drinking all the time  Every show  You know  Between shows  Well, in his words  Let's play this clip  And then we can discuss for  Discuss  For a couple seconds  This is Pat Sajak  Yesterday  Have you ever done Wheel of Fortune  A little bit drunk?  Yes  When I first started 
[01:11:30]  And was much younger  And could tolerate those things  We had a different show then  You didn't win money  You won fake money  With which you could buy cheesy prizes  Cheesy  The turntable would go around  And housewives from Teaneck  Would say  Oh, for $100  I'll have the lamp  No, I'll have  It was the most boring  Two minutes in television  But because we had all those prizes  Wow, he's admitting that  That's awesome  That was the worst  When Wheel of Fortune  Went to cash  That was the biggest turning point  For Wheel of Fortune  I just realized 
[01:12:00]  That I haven't watched  Wheel of Fortune  In a really long time  Because I didn't even know  They went to cash  Oh, that was  How many years ago?  Years ago  Really?  Fucking mega years ago  Remember the famous clip  Where the lady said  I'll take  In the butt?  No, that's the other show  And did it actually happen?  I think it did  But it never made the air  Of course  Where a lady said  I'll take the brick wall  And they just had that  As like a set  Oh, it's like the background  Yeah  Yeah, the brick wall  She actually said  She'll take the brick wall  For whatever the price was  Because they had  The price on the brick wall  For maybe  For something else 
[01:12:30]  For the skis  Or whatever the fuck it was  Right  Yeah, yeah  Do you have that clip?  It's a classic  Wheel of Fortune clip  What a dummy  Where she goes  I'll take the brick wall  Anyway, back to Sajak  So you thought  That was boring too  When they just went around?  Oh, it was terrible  They, you know  And then I'll take the rest  And a gift certificate  Ugh  And they'd have to take  A gift certificate  To Spiegel Catalog  Or something  That no one ever used  Yeah  Yeah, the prizes  Were so overinflated too  Like the lamp  Would be $2,000  And a bedroom set 
[01:13:00]  For like $10,000  And it was a piece of shit  And then it was always  That stupid Dalmatian  Everybody knew  The ceramic Dalmatian  That they'd sell  For ridiculous amounts of money  They just kind of  Threw that in there, right?  Yes, the Spiegel Catalog  Yeah, yeah  Greaseman used to  You mentioned  The Spiegel  Is he still doing radio?  I don't know  I think so  Yeah  I've got a podcast  Or something  I can say what I want  Chicago 
[01:13:30]  60609  Waddley doodles  Chicago  Spiegel Catalog  Chicago  60609  Waddley doodle  Waddley doodle  Bone dry  Bone dry  Back to Sajak  On television  But because we had  All those prizes  We had endless time  Between shows  Our dinner breaks  Would be two and a half  Hours long  While they drove in  New cars and boats  And gazebos and stuff  So we had  In NBC and Burbank  We had a place  Called Los Arcos  Across the street  Which is Spanish  As you know  For the Arcos  And we go 
[01:14:00]  And they serve  Great margaritas  So we would go  Van and I  Would go across  And have two  Or three  Or six  And then come  And do the last  Shows  And have trouble  Recognizing the alphabet  They're really good  Tapes to get hold of  It sounds like you did  More than one  It sounds like you did  A few  You did a handful  Loaded up on margaritas  We did  I think  I think the number  The average number  Was cuatro  That's pretty good  Right there  Four margaritas  Pat Sajak  Was the show  Better or worse  I had a great time  I have no idea

[01:17:00]  My god  Well good for them  I guess  Jesus  We gotta get back  To Newt Gingrich  So uh  The way  They were talking  About their monies  Yesterday  A lot of people  Are bothered  That Mitt Romney  Makes a lot of money  People are bothered  When anyone  Makes a lot of money  They get very upset  By that  A lot of money  Yes  56 to 57 thousand dollars  A day  Yeah  That's two years  For Sam Roberts  You'd have to work  Two years  For one day  Of Mitt Romney  Money  Well I don't  Want to give 
[01:17:30]  Any numbers out  But pretty accurate  Close enough  Yeah  Close enough  He makes a lot  Of money  Here's a little  Exchange that  Happened last night  Newt off his game  I'm saying it  Yeah  Tax returns  Let me bring this  To Speaker Gingrich  Earlier this week  You said Governor  Romney  After he released  His taxes  You said that  You were satisfied  With the level  Of transparency  Of his personal  Finances  When it comes to this  And I just want  To reiterate  And ask you  Are you satisfied  Right now  With the level  Of transparency  As far as  His personal 
[01:18:00]  Finances  Well you and I  Have a great  Relationship  It goes back  A long way  I'm with him  This is a nonsense  Question  Look  How about  How about  If the four of us  Agree for the rest  Of the evening  We'll actually talk  About issues  That relate  To governing America  Mr. Speaker  You made an issue  Of this this week  When you said  That he lives  In a world  Of Swiss bank  And Cayman Island  Bank accounts  I didn't say that 
[01:18:30]  You did  I did  And I'm perfectly  Happy to say that  On an interview  On some TV show  But this is a  National debate  Where you have a chance  To get the four of us  To talk about  A whole range of issues  But if you make  A serious accusation  Against Governor  Romney like that  You need to explain that  You want to try again  I mean  Wouldn't it be nice  If people didn't  Make accusations  Somewhere else  That they weren't  Willing to defend here  Okay  All right  Given that  Given that  Given that standard  I did say 
[01:19:00]  I thought it was  Unusual  And I don't know  Of any American  President who's  Had a Swiss bank account  I'd be glad for you  To explain that  Sort of thing  Okay  I will  I will  I'll say it again  I have a trustee  That manages my investments  In a blind trust  That was so that  I would avoid  Any conflicts of interest  That trustee indicated  Last week  When he was asked  About this  He said that he wanted  To diversify  The investments  That I had  And for a while  He had money  In a Swiss account  Reported in the US  Full taxes  Paid on it  US taxes  There's nothing wrong 
[01:19:30]  With that  And I know that  There may be some  Who try and make  A deal of that  As you have out publicly  But look  I think it's important  For people to make sure  That we don't  Castigate individuals  Who've been successful  And try and by innuendo  Suggest there's something  Wrong with being successful  And having investments  And having a return  On those investments  Exactly  That's the thing though  A lot of people  In this country  Don't have investments  You know  They might have a 401k  Through their company  But they don't even have  A knowledge of what  Investing is really  And they're easy 
[01:20:00]  Pickings for these  Politicians that would  Like to tell them  That investing  And getting returns  On your investment  Is this somehow  Evil thing  The rich evil people  Because if you get  Returns on your investment  It obviously means  You're fucking someone over  In order to get that  And no  You're investing in the country  You're investing in companies  But I don't know  When it became evil  To have investments  And make money  Off your investments  It's fucked  What do you think 
[01:20:30]  Of the tabloid shit  That's going on  With these debates  Oh the  Well that's all the  Picky little bullshit  That I think  Shouldn't even  It doesn't even  Have a part in the  Do you think  Eventually some of these  High powered candidates  Will go  Look I'm not doing  Your debate  Because I'm not  I'm not dealing  With the tabloid shit  Well unfortunately  Like open marriages  And all this other stuff  But the debates  Are the things  That are really  Driving these percentages  That these guys  Make when  They take these polls  But it seems  This time around  I don't remember  Being this crazy 
[01:21:00]  Where it just seems  More like dirty  These debates  And more tabloidish  Seems like there's  More of them  It seems like  They are like  Going at each other  For things  I guess because  The economy's bad  The country's  You know  Unemployment  And shit like that  There's a lot more  Shit to pick on  And to make the  Other candidates  Seem like a hypocrite  Or seem like he was  One that was  Contributing  To the reason  That unemployment  Is down  And housing market  Took a shit  And the economy sucks 
[01:21:30]  It's easy to turn around  And bash these people  To make it seem like  They were somehow  Responsible  Right  When like  Like Mitt was saying  Yeah you invest  Especially when you have  Things like mutual funds  And a blind trust  For your investments  What's a blind trust  You take a bunch of money  Is that like our  Barry guy  Well no  Barry lets us know  And we have a say  In what goes on  Barely though  But you give  We set the parameters  And then we go  Alright  Yeah  Make us some money  Hopefully 
[01:22:00]  Yeah  Is that blind trust  No  So what's the difference  I know what I'm invested in  He literally what  Just writes a check  And goes  You know  Whatever  Yeah I know  What we're invested in  Yeah but that's sort of  What we did  We set parameters  That we  You know  In my case  You know  I don't want to get  Too crazy and risky  See he doesn't know  What he's invested in  You sure  Yeah because  The blind  For conflict of interest  Like he  He could go  And work for  A certain company  Not even knowing 
[01:22:30]  That he's invested  In that company  Or work for  A company  And be invested  In a competing company  And then you would think  Oh well he's gonna  You know  Pull shenanigans  To make his investment  Go up  So blind trust  Is to save his ass  Yeah  Yeah  So who does blind trust  Usually  Politicians  Who else  I would guess  People that  Where investing  Is some kind of  Conflict of interest  So that's a work around  The conflict of interest  Yeah  So he literally  Doesn't know  What he's invested in  That's the message 
[01:23:00]  I get  So when he gets  A statement  How does that work  It just  It's written in  Invisible ink  Wow  And it disappears  Before he ever gets it  Wow that's so cool  Yeah  They put big thick  Welding goggles on him  And show it to him  Invisible ink  NASA invented that too  Yes  Yes  Yeah  And my father-in-law  Checking in  Saying duct tape  Uh duct tape  And that means  That the father-in-law  Heard all that  All that other stuff  We were talking about  Oh  Oh boy  You know  The show  Well the  The sex in the offices 
[01:23:30]  And stuff  He probably heard all that too  It's embarrassing  Which will make  The next Philly visit  Very awkward  Oh yeah  Yes  I've been there  See unlike your  Your mom and stepfather  Right  My in-law is still listening  Yeah  Yeah  I just realized that  Shit  Shit  Add duct tape to the list  Um  Wow  Alright  So that's what a blind trust is  Yeah  I learned something today  Yeah  Cause when I'm  When he was saying that last time 
[01:24:00]  I'm like  How do you not know  What you're invested in  Come on  Yeah I know  That's  You kinda would think  You would wanna know  What you're invested in  So you really gotta trust the guy  Yeah that's it  You gotta find a pretty  Trustworthy  But he absolutely  Sets parameters  Like we did  But he just doesn't know  What it's in  Yeah yeah  It's like I wanna  I want growth  Or you know  I want a tax shelter  I want this  I want that  Well in our case  It was asked  Do you wanna get aggressive  With your investments  And I go nah  Keep it pretty you know  Pretty safe  I decided  Cause I was like  At first  I couldn't tell them 
[01:24:30]  To make it safe enough  I was like  Just fucking  Make it safe  But then I was like  When bank interest  Started really going down  To nothing  I told them  I said alright look  Let's go to level 3  We could start looking  Into some of these  I don't know  Mid level risks  Foreign growth companies  Oh yeah  And you know  Play around with the euro  A little bit  Take advantage  Of some of that shit  Thanks to Stephen Singer  Sending me diamonds  Small cap  Yeah some small cap companies 
[01:25:00]  Well thanks to Stephen Singer  Sending me diamonds  In the mail  Yeah you're set  I got a fucking good business  You're set  I'm taking those diamonds  And I'm turning them around  Why he gave them to you  Sounds illegal  Huh  He gave them to you  For a good deal  He gives them to me  For free  I wish you would  Stop mentioning that  And then I turn around  And sell them  At a cheaper price  This all seems illegal  And then you plug it  On the radio  I'm fucking making some profit  You're giving him  Extra plugs now  Because this isn't  Even a live read  Hey it's better than  Fucking having  Your money in the bank  Is it  I'm dealing diamonds  Illegally right now

Trump Jr. on Twitter  You don't have to spell out Jr.  And he's filling in for 
[01:33:30]  Lil Jimmy Norton  And I saw you tweeting last night  I don't know if you were listening earlier  I'm like  I wanted to call you and go  You know how much you got to lose  You can't be tweeting about trannies  There's no upside for me in this  No  Zero upside  But you know what honestly  For me that's what  Twitter is kind of the escape  From the stiff suit crap  That I have to do all day  Yeah but other people don't understand that  And they're going to use your Twitter  To try to F you over  Yeah I don't care  I don't see any political aspirations  In the near future  So it's like  I don't really have to cater to anyone  Right 
[01:34:00]  And the other thing  You tweeted that you're going to be  Filling in for Jimmy  And then so I  I kind of watched your Twitter a little bit  And your fans or whatever  And they were all like  Why would you do that  How could you possibly  Some of the ONA fans  They seemed to like it  Yeah yeah definitely  I feel honored sitting in his seat  Although I wanted to wipe it off  A little bit  Yeah you should hold that thing down  I don't know  It wasn't kind of a nice suit  But like  Jimmy's seat  We're trying to merge  The two audiences for a day  And wow  I don't know if they're going to get along  Because your people are like  Oh god  Those guys  Although I think my Twitter demo  Is sort of 
[01:34:30]  You know  I've kind of broken them in  A little bit initially  Like I definitely lose  About half as many people  As I gain  When I kind of throw out  Some of the stuff  That I put out there  They're like  Oh my god  I can't believe you'd say that  You have such a following  And you know  Just like unfollow  Like find block  Yeah yeah  How great is it  When you tweet something  And you watch your numbers  Drop drastically  And you go  Oh well I guess  That wasn't a good idea  Yeah apparently  That was a failed experiment  Right  That's happened to me a lot  Where it's like  It actually goes down  And I was like  That was like  My best thought of the day  So like apparently  I'm not necessarily in sync 
[01:35:00]  With the rest of the country  They're going to love this  This is awesome  You think  All right  You follow me  I'm going to give you  Something today  And whoa  It goes the other way  It's a mess  Drastically too  What were we just talking about  Because I liked it  Oh we were talking about  Fly fishing  And guns  And um  Yeah  Outdoorsman-y stuff  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Getting out in the wild  Yeah  You guys  You two are fishermen  Not really me  You saw the picture  You just showed me  I know  It was a great picture  Of a big fish  I'm just not  Kind of the fish guy  Because I thought 
[01:35:30]  Fly fishing  Was for lame-os  Really  I grew up on Long Island  So we would just  You know  Do the casting off the beach  And do  Go for blue fish  And stuff like that  Snappers and flounder  And  Went out on a big  Car charter boats  Did some of that  Deep sea fishing  Never did  Never did that  Yeah  That's basically drinking  That's drinking  With a hook in the water  Yeah  Yeah  Never did that  I would go on  The north shore of Long Island  In the harbors  And just kind of  You know  Watch the blues  Do their running  And try to catch a few of those  Yeah  That was  I used to love that  But then  Bobby turns me on  To this fly fishing 
[01:36:00]  Which I'm like  Fly fishing  That's for like  Old guys  It's pretty cool  I do it in the salt water  As well  And you can do it  In the salt  And you know  Caught marlin  Caught tuna  All on a fly rod  Sailfish  It's absolutely cool  It absolutely is cool  We had Henry Winkler  In here yesterday  So now I'm thinking  Me  You  And the Fonz  Fly fishing  I'm in  What do you say  I got the drift boat  Up in the Catskills  I'll row  You'll row?  I'll row  You guys get in the boat  See the rowing guy  Doesn't get to fish  Oh really?  That was a nice move  On his part  Out of those three 
[01:36:30]  I think I should be the rower  I'm thinking  Yeah but the difference is  You haven't rowed a drift boat  There's some of the rapids  It could get kind of ugly  You hit those rocks sideways  And you're in trouble  Oh it's not just like  Oh we're rowing  You really got to kind of  No there's places  Listen not so much  You know up in the Catskills  But if you go out west  There's areas where  You got to know  What you're doing in the boat  Otherwise you know  Because you got to get through  Some of the areas  Where it just drops in altitude  And you really don't want  To fall in the river  Because if you do  You're going to die  Because they've invented  The waders  Yes  That fill up with water  So you sink like a fucking rock 
[01:37:00]  And somehow you have to  Get out of the waders  To save your own life  It's basically a drown bag  It's basically a drown bag  You guys couldn't come up  With something better  If you wear a belt  It doesn't fill up as fast  So you can kind of  Stay buoyant  But yeah you don't  You don't want to  Man because Rich  I loved Rich  He still thinks  I hate him  Because we didn't really  Catch anything  But I'll go with him again  He sent me so many  Because I follow him  Because he knows  I can get the conditions  And stuff up there  And he's like  You think those guys  Are ever going to  Talk to me again  I was like man  It's fishing  He was great  We went at a bad time 
[01:37:30]  The water level was too high  And I could explain  The science of that  But I'll  Burn the shit out of everybody  Exactly  But I did learn some things  But he stops the boat  And now I'm on these  These crazy slippery rocks  It's all just rocks  With the  I mean the river is flowing  You know the water was high  Like it just said  And I'm thinking to myself  If I slip  I'm fucked  Because like you said  You drown in a bag  Yeah you don't want to go down  It's worse in the winter  Kind of fishing  When it's really cold  Because then you're dealing  Oh man now it's cold water  Yeah  But usually if you fall  On a river  You can figure it out  But not when your waders  Are filling up with water 
[01:38:00]  Making your  In my case  I'm about 175  All of a sudden I'm going to weigh  About 300 pounds instantly  Yeah 240 and you can't really  Move your legs  Right  Wow that's not good  It's scary  Is the point I'm trying to make  Really fucking scary  When you're walking around  Those slippery rocks  You're really making this easy for me  Yeah  Sounds like something I want to do  Kind of like going shooting  With someone who has  You know a fully automatic gun  And no experience  It's just not a good  Yeah and you're dressed  In a deer suit  Hunting  Yeah I don't know  Speaking of shooting  Brian in Michigan  I don't have time  To go to his call  But he's saying 
[01:38:30]  That you're an excellent marksman  Yeah I do  I compete in high power  And stuff like that  Did you say that last time  Yeah I did  I do a lot of that  Two of my teammates  Are former national champions  So I have a lot of fun with it  I go all over the country  Shooting it's great  That is fucking cool man  Why aren't you in those competitions  I'm going to get you out there man  I don't know  Yeah  Why not  I would love to  The way to get him out there  Is to actually throw out  Some sort of challenge  Yeah  If I make it a competition  He can't say no  Especially not in front of the audience 
[01:39:00]  Damn I gotta go  Ant loves guns  And he loves competing  So  I love shooting  Shooting is great  Like a no brainer  Maybe there's like  A low level competition  You can start at  Yeah listen  I mean that's the thing  I mean it's all based in categories  And stuff like that  So you can compete at a high level  But you could  You know  There's times that  When I even first started  I was shooting next to  The person who just won  Camp Perry  Like the national champion  Sitting next to me  And you know  There's times where  You can actually win  On certain legs  And be like  Wow it's kind of good  For the ego  So it's not really  Squatted that way  You can shoot with the best  Of the world  And you learn a lot from them  Is there prize money? 
[01:39:30]  You know  It's not a big prize money sport  You can win some stuff  But nothing worth  Look he's saying  How much though  It might be big money for us  A couple hundred bucks  A couple hundred dollars  25-30 mil  That's a dumb million dollar prize  Me a bag of shells  Usually it's like free ammo  Which is like gold  That's good  Yeah believe me  I got a building question  Yeah  And I've been thinking about this  Me and my buddy  Have been thinking about this  For years  In a dumb way  And I think you might  Know the answer  New York City's 
[01:40:00]  Constantly building right  Yes  Constantly putting up buildings  Do you  Is there an actual number  Of floors that  Are built  On a daily basis  Like the city grows  By a certain amount  Of floors every day  I mean they usually  Do it in units  You know  Because a floor could have  If you have a large apartment  Versus a small apartment  Well actually floors  Would be easier  To wrap my mind around  You know  I don't know  If the exact  I mean obviously  Depends on the market  So you know  A year like today  There's a lot more construction  Than there was two years ago  Where there was basically nothing  And they're getting rid of 
[01:40:30]  A lot of the excess inventory  That had been built  Right  You know during the prior boom  So it  We've been trying to figure this out  For years  Because the city itself  Is like a living organism  And it's continuing  To move upwards  Typically  You know if I remember  The stats correctly  And I don't look at it  Because you know  We kind of focus  On the high end  So I don't know  About what's being built  Necessarily  You know on the lower end  But I think New York  And the outer boroughs  It was something like  40,000 units  Every 24 months  You know so like  Basically 20,000  New apartments a year  Sort of thing  20,000 new apartments a year  But I mean  An apartment could be 
[01:41:00]  The whole floor  Or one bedroom  Correct  That's how they broke it  That's why I'm trying  To figure it out  I don't know  What it would be  On a square footage basis  But figure you know  If a typical apartment  Is a thousand square feet  20,000 new apartments a year  Yeah  Wow  Wow  Yeah that's a lot  Think about it  For 12 million people though  It's not really that big a number  You know  Will we ever connect  Buildings in the sky  Well they do it  In certain places  I mean there's sky bridges  Every once in a while  You'll see one  There's a couple in the city  But I mean  When we all of a sudden decide  Fuck let's start  Yeah we're just going to  Merge the two buildings  Let's start merging  Fill up the middle space  Way up high man  Floor to floor 
[01:41:30]  Other buildings  Why not  What else is going on  With that space  When you're 20 stories  Above the city  They probably have  Something in between  Problem connecting them  With the sway of the building  Yeah  Well now you can do it  We had a building design  That we were going to do  In Dubai before the world  Before they hit a wall  Going about a thousand  Yeah  Wow  And it was literally  Two buildings  That were separated  Almost by like  50, 60 yards  And they actually met  At the top  And so they connected  At the top  It was a sweet design  I mean it was really good  Something I would have  Wanted to build  But obviously it didn't  Make sense going forward  Once sort of the world 
[01:42:00]  Ended in 2007  They ran out of money  Over there didn't they  Yeah  Are they in trouble  Over there  Listen I think  They're going to come back  Obviously  It's basically a haven  For the rest of the Middle East  So all the oil money  Countries are going there  They didn't have  Their own oil  So they kind of  Created an economy  Out of nothing  So it was sort of  Impressive  But they got to the point  Where I have an  Interesting story about it  I was going over there  And they paid me  Pretty big money  To go speak at  The Cityscape conference  Which is a huge  Real estate conference  Over there  So I'm going there  I'm going to be  The keynote speaker  At this conference  Like 50,000 people 
[01:42:30]  In attendance  So it's kind of  A big deal  So the guy  Before the conference  Was like  I want to take you around  And show you around  And they had  Displays for buildings  And developments  That were going up  And I mean  Figure a 10,000 square foot display  So the size of this  Office corner here  As a display  For like one building  I'm saying  Man it just doesn't make sense  There's no  It's just a conference  It's three days  There's no salvage value  To any of this  They spent millions of dollars  And I'm just like  Wow man  They just really believe  This is going to go on forever  And when I knew it was over  Was we come around the corner 
[01:43:00]  And I was like  Holy crap  I jump back  As I look up  And there are three  Life size  Tyrannosaurus Rex robots  And no  No bullshit  Right  And they're going  Roar  Claws everywhere  And I was  They looked real  I mean perfect  Paint jobs  Everything  And the guy goes  Isn't that amazing  I go yeah  It's great  But like  I don't get it  He goes  Those dinosaurs  Were two million dollars  Each  So I go  Well is it part of  You know that project  Is it like part of the brand  Is it part of the marketing 
[01:43:30]  No  It's like  They're dinosaurs  They're just cool  I go  So you spent six million dollars  On something that has no salvage value  That has nothing to do  With the project or anything  And he looks at me  And he goes  Like I'm an idiot  Right  I'm like  You're the moron paying me  I was 28 at the time  I'm like  You're paying me six figures  To talk for 45 minutes  So I assume  That you assume  That I know something about real estate  And I don't get it  And he looks at me  Like I'm a child  And he says  Well  Obviously children love dinosaurs  And I look at him 
[01:44:00]  And you know  I'm just  At this point  I'm just like  Okay I'm going to get this speech over with  And I'm out of here  Because like  I'm short in this world  And I go  You know  The natural response to me  You know  This is a real estate convention  Of 50,000 people in attendance  I have yet to see a child  Right  And my response to him was  Well you know  Do children buy real estate  And he looks at me  He's just like  You know  He's like  You're an idiot  You don't get it  I'm like  No no no  You're like dinosaurs though  You're missing the point  And so like  That's when I kind of knew  It was over  They got to a point where  You know  As good as some of the moves 
[01:44:30]  They made initially  Were  They were just  They just got to the point  You know  We can do everything right  We you know  We wanted to launch a building  And they wanted to  Hold off like selling  For 18 months  Because they wanted to  Do a launch party  With Christina Aguilera  And I was like  Really like  No one's gonna  Like no one cares  Like if you can sell it now  In a good market  Get to fucking market  Because like  Otherwise you're just  Wasting your time  And you know  So they got to a point  Where they just didn't believe  That they could do anything wrong  And I mean  I guess that's  You know  A mistake you can learn from  Slapped in the face  They have so much money though  Those people  Yeah well you know 
[01:45:00]  Listen  With oil where it's at  Is it true  For a status symbol  In some of these  Middle Eastern countries  They buy the license plate number  Someone was telling me  Oh I'm sure  Yeah I mean  There's some  A lower number  Means you got a lot  Of fucking money  Everything there is  About prestations  And supposedly  And most of the emerging world  By the way  Not just there  But the license plate  Supposedly man  They're fucking auctioning  Those things off  And going for a lot of money  Just so you can drive around  To show everyone  How rich you really are  Yeah like  Yeah when you got one  In one of those  Middle Eastern countries  You're a high roller  I read that somewhere 
[01:45:30]  I don't know if it's true  Or whatever  Or I might have dreamt it  Who knows  Yeah  Either way it sounds good  Yeah  If you say it with enough confidence  People will believe it  Well we got the microphone  So we're experts  That's what we learned  When does Celebrity Apprentice start?  It's a week later than it was  It's now  It's like February 19th  I guess because  Super Bowl  Or Grammys  Or something like that  So they  Oh okay  There's like no reason to go  You know  Start off  Wait maybe the Oscars  Is that around the corner now?  I thought it was  I think that's around the corner  But that may be a little bit later  Yeah  It's awards season 
[01:46:00]  So I think it was like  No reason to go up  Against Super Bowl Grammys  And that  So  Yeah  Yeah  Push it a little further up  Yeah  Yeah  We're good  We're good  But you know  You don't need to be stupid  Yeah you don't have to  Go up against that  You guys got  You guys got a lot of celebrities  A lot of good ones man  No it's a  Was Penn Jillette easy to work with?  Yeah he's an interesting guy  You know he's pretty cerebral  You know he's funny  He speaks his mind though  Yeah he does  But that's great  Like you know  That's what you need on a show like that  So 
[01:46:30]  Yeah  No he was fun to work with  Yeah  I'm trying to read you right now  Yeah I know you are  Yeah yeah  I'm okay with  Uncomfortable moments of silence  So I'm good with it  Your radio show  I don't give a shit  I'm just  I'm trying  I'm trying to read you  That's all  Who else was fun to work with there?  See you know  Lisa I'm sure she's probably been on the show  No she does Howard  So for some reason  She can't do our show  Yeah  Oh really  Is there like a  Not with us  It gets weird with some of these people  Yeah we're fine  But uh 
[01:47:00]  Yeah we don't give a fuck  What radio show you do  But some of these people get really paranoid  Because we've asked her on the show many times  She knows a lot of the same people we do  But no she's never done our show  So she was  You know she's fun  Yeah  You know there's some  You know Arsenio  You know  You know Clay Aiken  Paul Sr  You know he was fun  You know going up to the shop up there  To watch him put together some bikes  Was you know  Yeah  Pretty cool  So you know I have fun with it  Because I just get to spend some time  With these guys off camera  And you know it's  You know sort of unique perspective  It's very different  Right  You know watching them  And you know when you get to watch Clay Aiken  Try to do a project with Paul Sr 
[01:47:30]  It's kind of like  You know nothing could possibly go right  It's sort of perfect  It's just great to watch  What I like about the show  They really get into it  Listen  There's a lot of these celebrity shows  No one wants to get into millions of people  Like so  You know you have  Whatever you say about them  I mean they're all pretty accomplished  In their old feels  So they're all sort of alpha types  Right  You know you put them in a room for a while  And you know you forget the cameras are on  Because I mean they are  What people don't see on the show  Is they are really going basically 20 hours a day  Wow  Like it is  It's an intense experience  Like no one  Comes off the show being like  Wow that was easier than I thought it would be 
[01:48:00]  Everyone's like holy crap  Yeah that was a lot tougher than it was  How long is the taping  How many months  We basically go for like six weeks straight  Six weeks straight  So it's like you know  Monday is the first delivery  Tuesday is a boardroom  Wednesday is a delivery  Thursday is a boardroom  And so it's  It's quick  Because we were talking the other day  Reality shows when they first hit  It was like you had to tape for six months  To get stuff  Yeah I think that you know  You try to cut it down  And I think frankly  You could do it over six months  But you get better material  In a compact time  Because you know  There's only so much content  You can actually use  And so you know 
[01:48:30]  If you make it short and intense  You know  Right right  If you're six months  People just give up  Because you don't want to deal with it  After a while  But you know  When you say six weeks  You're like it's not that bad  Like it can't be the end of the world  And so they try a little bit harder  Which makes them more fatigue  Which leads to more disaster  Yeah they're going to  They're going to start slowing down  After a while  If you give them too much time  Yeah exactly  You're going to lose that energy  Yeah well and a lot of these people  I mean they do have  You know  Other jobs  And so you know  They're promoting themselves a little bit  But it's hard to step away from  It's not like some kid out of college  Who's saying  I got nothing  So I'll go do a show  Six months 
[01:49:00]  I'm fine with it  You're right  Yeah these guys  Celebrity had to change a little bit  There was more time  When we did regular  I bet some celebrities  Probably more than others  Need time  Yeah well I mean  It's a little difficult sometimes  Because when we film  In the fall  It's you know  Obviously the baseball season  So some of the  You know the ball players  And some of the athletes  That want to be on the show  It's like they're either going into  Like the early season  Right  Or you know  They're kind of in the playoffs  And it's hard to get those guys  So there's never  You know an ideal time  To actually do it  Celebrity Apprentice  February 12th at 9pm  19th 
[01:49:30]  It's the week later  Oh I thought that meant  The week later  Okay so February 19th  That's the original one  Sorry about that  No problem  So February 19th at 9pm on NBC  I'll be watching  Looks like a good lineup  Of celebrities  You got the Giants  In the Super Bowl  You know how do you not  Listen  Listen I don't want to put  Too much money on the game  I put money on the last game  You know  But  It's hard to bet  Against Tom Brady  You know  It's just one of those  It's like I don't know  I like Eli  I like the Giants  I'm a Giants fan  But you know  I also know Tom  And I know Bob Kraft 
[01:50:00]  Who owns the Patriots  You know  They're family friends  So it's  Family friends  That's what makes it  A little tougher  Yeah it's a little harder  But like  You know  It's just hard  Let's not get ourselves  The last Super Bowl  Like we did win  But like  There may have been  Some luck at play  In that one  Like you know  I don't know  That we were the better team  Throughout the season  Obviously  What last time?  No  Obviously the Patriots  Came in undefeated  So it's like  Yeah of course  And you had that  Amazing catch  Are you a Giants fan  Or a Jets fan?  I'm a Giants fan  Giants?  Say I'm a Jets fan 
[01:50:30]  And people are killing me  Because I'm going with the Patriots  Well you know  Listen  Because  And they're like  Patriot fans will be way worse  Than Giants fans  The friend of your enemy  Is your friend right?  You know so  The enemy of your  Enemy is your friend  Whatever  We did time up in Boston  You know what I meant  I know what you meant  It's early  I haven't woken up yet  I'm one of these sports guys  In New York  Because we're lucky enough  To have two teams  That I stick with my team  And I don't jump to the other team  When my team's out  Yeah that's the thing  I've always been a Giants fan  You know  Like if the Jets were in the Super Bowl  Would you be rooting for the Jets  Over the  Well you can't say the Pats 
[01:51:00]  Nick Mangal's a friend of mine  You know  I wouldn't want to root against  Again  You know  I'm  Because of my hobbies  And the hunting  And the fishing  And all the stuff that I do  I don't watch all that much sports  Because there's just not enough time  Between like my work schedule  My travel schedule  Having kids  All that stuff  So I've become less of a sports fan  Over the years  Just because  You know  I had to cut something out  Right  You know  So now it's more  Less about team allegiance  Than it is about friends  In a certain perspective  But I'm still kind of a New Yorker  I think it's good for the city  I think it  You know  I recognize the revenue potential  So  Yeah 
[01:51:30]  He looks at it so differently  The business hat goes on  I'm saying  I don't know  This could be good for the city  I have the Super Bowl  Doesn't that take you out of it  As a fan though  Just a fan  When you know this guy  And you know the owners  And you've got to kind of  Have some allegiance towards them  Well it's hard  But I also know the owners  Of the Giants  So it's a little bit  I'm net neutral in this one  Yeah yeah  Apparently so  If I could choose  Who wins  I'd want New York to win  You couldn't ask for  A better Super Bowl though  With all the history  Of the last Super Bowl  Between the history  Of the last Super Bowl  Between when you think about  Kind of the market demographics 
[01:52:00]  I mean perhaps it's a little bit  Too East Coast  You know  Giants have to be favored right  No way  You think so  I don't know  I guess that offense  Well let's look  I don't think so  What's the spread  No way  You don't think so  Have they put out the spread yet  I don't know  You bet sports  Is that your thing  Only to make it interesting  Meaning  Kevin from Connecticut  Saying  Pats by three  Pats by three right now  Yeah I believe that  Yeah  I don't really bet sports  It's not my thing  My problem with betting is  If I lose  It'll drive me crazy  And whatever I'd be willing 
[01:52:30]  If I put even a couple  The losing side  Drives me so much more  Than the thrill of the win  Yeah  So it's not like  I'd have to go like  Ten to one odds  To make it exciting  But no one's going to give you that  I never got into sports betting  I don't know why  Nah  It'd be kind of nice  To have a little action  I'm just the casino guy  Although I would lose a lot  Because I have that  Horrible sports curse  But  You're the most  It's unbelievable  Bet against whatever you're going  I haven't picked  A Super Bowl winner  I couldn't tell you the last time  Couldn't tell you  So you said the Giants are favorites  So I know where I'm putting my money 
[01:53:00]  I'm going Patriots  He was in Buffalo for all those years  All the years that Buffalo just tanked  Three out of the four technically  Yeah  Wow  I was up there for all those losses  That was rough  And you know  Buffalo's a tough town to begin with  And then  Yeah  You know  They really depend on their football  Yeah well that's all they got  And there was a Super Bowl  I can't  You know  They got that and wings  And that's  I can't  I can't express  I've tried over the years  The  The level of depression  The city was in  Losing those Super Bowls  Year after year  I just can't express it  You felt it in the air 
[01:53:30]  Wherever you went  And there were some bad losses too  Like you know  One  You should have  That chip shot  You know  It should have been  Well the Scott Norwood obviously  But then one year  They just got destroyed  So they didn't even have a chance  I think it was like  They lost to the Giants  They lost to Denver  Right  They lost to  Denver was one year  I'm trying to think of the other  I don't remember now  Yeah  I don't remember but  You know  Because they have really long winters  The sun doesn't come out  Because the lake affects snow  And then on top of it  You're losing Super Bowls  The city was depressed  Holy shit  Maybe that's why 
[01:54:00]  It's like actually  Economically so much worse off  Than it was then  Yeah yeah  They just gave up after all that  If we can't even win the Super Bowl  With four attempts  We're out  I'm gone  But four tries  Time to move to Florida  Sundays that city  Just shut down  Because everyone was a Bills fan  It was unbelievable  Like you know  The percentage of people  You had no options  I mean in New York  There's only so many people  You can fit in a giant stadium  You know  With eight million people  Sitting in the city  You know  And there's  A Ranger game  Or a Knicks game  Or you know  Broadway  Broadway  Whatever  Like there's options 
[01:54:30]  Yeah  Not up there  I mean they really  I went to a wedding up there  And there's nothing to do  Pittsburgh is the same way  They really get into  Their sports  Yeah  Wow  Oh I was going to say  That  Who's betting a million dollars  On the Super Bowl  50 cent I think it is  Bregan  What  It was in the paper today  I heard 50 cent say  That he was going to post  New photos of himself  On Twitter  If the Giants lost  Oh  That's the bet he's doing  I heard he said  No one wins in that case  He lost his bet 
[01:55:00]  And we all lose  That's great  I'll tell you this much  We had him in once  Yeah  Wow  Wow  A businessman  Oh I'm sure  Listen  A big time businessman  A lot of those guys  Are much much smarter  Than the image they put out  I mean I know  I know a bunch of them  Through you know  You would assume  I assumed way too much  About him  He came in here  And well spoken  And knew what he was doing  Yeah  It's also great  When they drop the  Kind of facade  That they put up  For everyone else  You know  You can see  You know  Same thing  You know  With Diddy  And these guys  You know  Yeah  They kind of do the thing 
[01:55:30]  And they have the accent  And this  And you get them alone  And it's like  They're talking classical music  And you're saying  Like what  You just don't expect it  A lot of it's show  Yeah  Listen it's all marketing  It's all PRs  They know who they're catering to  Show biz  Absolutely  Yeah  It's all bullshit basically  I guess  We don't have to spend  The whole show with this  But I want to get your  Your thoughts on  Last night's debate  And the guys in general  At this point  The last time you were in  I think we still had 
[01:56:00]  A few guys in there  I had a long overdue  Like guys dinner  Yeah  Last night  So I missed the debate  Same shit  But yeah  Newt was off  Newt was off his game  I would say  Is the headline  I think Mitt Romney  Had a really good debate  Last night  And I'm glad for that  Because I think Mitt  For me  Listen  It was before my  Political time  When Newt was really  Meaning I was alive  But I wasn't really  You know  Into politics  Right  When he was  Speaker of the house  And all I remember  Was that everyone  Hated him  Yeah  Meaning  But like if I'm 
[01:56:30]  If I'm Obama  Like I'm giving Newt money  To try to get rid of Romney  And I'm funny  Because you'd think  He'd be the easy guy  To win  Now the Republicans  Are basically killing  Themselves right now  So they're doing  No  You know  Like they had to end it  They gotta get rid of  Some of the guys  Because they're basically  Just hurting  Whoever gets the nomination  It's like  Well they're just gonna  Take the plugs  From everyone else  They're giving them  Fuel  Yeah  But if I'm Obama  Man I'm sitting there  Be like please give me Newt  Because like Romney  Listen he's a self-made guy  Maybe you don't like  The idea that he made  You know a bet  For ten thousand dollars 
[01:57:00]  Or something like that  Because most people  Can't bet that kind of  But like you know what  It is what it is  And I mean  He's not necessarily  Actively working  You talk about  You know the whole  Nonsense with the tax code  And you know  The Oracle of Omaha  Paying less than  Well because it's  Capital gains tax  So you know  If  I don't get that  Living in New York  City state  You know  I pay 51% in taxes  Like I think  I'm covering my share  You know what I mean  So if there's guys  That are getting  Capital gains  And nothing else  Like you know  It's sort of the way  That system's structured  But it's kind of nonsense  When you say that 
[01:57:30]  Oh the rich are all  Paying less in a tax bracket  Because it doesn't  Really work that way  I think Newt  You know  I think he's dangerous  From a  You know  From a perspective of  I just want someone  Else in the office  I think  You know  If I'm Obama  I'm salivating  Waiting for  You know  He's had multiple marriages  Multiple affairs  And that's fine  Just probably not  If you want to run  For president  Like  You know  You said something there  I just want to  It shouldn't matter  But it does  To the evangelical vote  That's voting Republican  If you turn  You know  In these elections  Where people are winning  By like 
[01:58:00]  0.2% of the country  It's not really that big  Like you lose  One little kind of  Unique group  And that's the problem  With politics  Like we have to cater  To every  You know  The one unique  Eskimo group  That lives in  Like  We need them  Yeah listen  Look at  The Iowa  You know  One by eight  Votes  I mean  That one vote  Actually matters now  And it sort of  Screws up our whole  Political system  Because you have to  Pander to and  Tater to everyone  You can't be like  This is where we need  To be in 20 years  This is how we get there  And like  Basically fuck everything  Else along the way 
[01:58:30]  That's how everyone else  Is doing a good job  China does that  They say this is where  We're going to be  Yeah  And like  This is how we'll get there  And we don't have to  Promise someone this  Like we're going back  To the whole hope thing  That I  Laughed about last time  I hate the fact  That we have to  We only get a choice  After there's only  Two guys left  Yeah  Like I don't like  That  I'm not allowed to vote  I can't do anything  Until we only have  Two people  Ron Bennington  Said some last Friday  On our show too  That the system  Itself is fucked up  Because only three states  Get to choose  Who your candidate's  Going to be  Honestly like 
[01:59:00]  I love to go  Deer hunting there  But like  You know  Really  Like I don't know  You got New Hampshire  Iowa  And a lot of times  By South Carolina  Florida  It could be over  It's pretty much over  What about the rest  Of the states  They don't even get  A voice in this  Technically  Yeah the whole system  And like Dan said  Then you get it down  To you know  The two people  Well and beyond that  In bipartisan politics  I mean basically  To get the nomination  You have to be  Ridiculously right  To win the general election  You have to come  Into the center  Which makes you  A hypocrite to begin with  Right  You know so  Obama had to go 
[01:59:30]  Like super liberal  Then he kind of  Tries to be centrist  To get anything done  It doesn't really work  Because he  You know he's not  He can't  Like that's what we want  We have to be  Incredibly right  To get the nod  But like the people  Who aren't necessarily  Going to vote in  You know the primary  Because they may be  Registered otherwise  You know they could  Very easily vote  Conservative but  If you're going  So far right  Yeah the undecideds  Are going to make up  A lot of votes here  And they are the ones  That are in the middle  Somewhere  And they're the ones  Like the Republican party  Is driving away right now  Because of what they  Need to do 
[02:00:00]  Just to be able to  Have the opportunity  To compete at the next level  Yeah it really doesn't matter  With the far right  And hardcore Republicans  They're going to vote  For whoever the candidate is  See that's my logic  I'm not going to vote  For Obama  But you need them now  Yeah yeah  And so you have to  Pander to them now  Right you've got to  Pander to them  But then you've got to  Try to pick up those  Independents and the  Undecideds and drive them  Away from the Democrats  Yeah which is hard to  I mean and if you're  The president who's  Sitting there basically  Going around the country  Campaigning he knows  He's in he doesn't have  So he basically could say 
[02:00:30]  See look he flip-flopped  He did this  The incumbent has the advantage  You kind of have to flip-flop  It's like oh I had an epiphany  I want to now be a little  Bit more in the middle  Yeah yeah  You can't do that credibly  It's a little hard  Yeah  You want Mitt Romney I assume  Yeah listen I  You know listen  Maybe he's a little bit boring  But you know  Kind of boring  You know I think  He doesn't have that charisma  Yeah but you know what  I don't know that you need  All that much charisma  To do these things  You need someone who can  Make and tell  Obama's got the greatest  Amount of charisma  Since Kennedy  You know maybe Clinton  We've said it many times  On the show he's a nerd 
[02:01:00]  Yeah but you know  At the same time  Listen as much as I  Dislike his politics  I think he's probably  A likable guy  Yeah  You know what I mean  He comes across that way  He comes across  Relatively cool  He's young  You know I think  I said it last time  I was like it was  A great novel experiment  I think we needed it  As a country  Like give someone  With no experience  With a good look  With a good line of shit  Like give him the presidency  Give him nukes  Like let's see what happens  Great like we got it  Out of our system  Like now let's try  To do something that works  And Mitt Romney  You know whatever it is  Like this is my opinion  You know  He's accomplished  He's done it  He's not a Washington insider 
[02:01:30]  I mean that's perhaps  Great Newt's greatest thing  Is he's managed to try  To sell himself  As like non-Washington  Which is fucking amazing  I'm like I can think  Of no one that is  More Washington than  Newt Greenwich  And he's like  Well I'm a Washington outsider  It's like how is that possible  Like you were the speaker  Of the house  And that's why  You're getting paid  A million six  By spending me  To be a historian  Like hey  I know some historians  They ain't making that kind of  They ain't making a million six  As a part time job  Was Obama bad for your business  In general  Well listen  You know  So far  If you listen to him 
[02:02:00]  You know four years ago  During the thing  Everything is going to be  Turned around in a year  And that's what you saw  In the State of the Union  Like no one  No president in the history  Of you know  That I'm aware of  With a 44% approval rating  And 9% unemployment  Is able to be like  And it's coming around  I just need two more years  Ironically I need  One more year to get reelected  And then another year  And it'll be okay  Like we're going back  To that whole hope thing  And like hope is great  But like hope isn't  What made this country great  Like we didn't sit back  And hope for shit to happen  You went out and actually  Did something  And you know  The whole notion of like 
[02:02:30]  Well cutting certain things  From the budget  It's like no no no  We're still running  So much higher  Than we could ever  Like until you can figure out  A revenue source  That's reasonable  That doesn't penalize  Everyone to do that  Like and it's great to say  Hey tax the rich  But it's like I don't know  If half the country  Is paying nothing  And I'm paying 50% plus  Living in New York City  In state  Like I don't know  Like I think I'm covering  My fair share  Like maybe I'm an asshole  But like I don't know  That's what I say constantly  I'm like I hate  Writing those checks  For taxes  And then being told  By people that aren't  Paying anything  That I'm not doing enough 
[02:03:00]  Yeah  What are you doing  It's such a fucking  Insulting slap in the face  And you know  I don't know  What to tell them anymore  Because there's no  Telling them anything  Yeah  They just think  You should pay more  America does need  A revenue stream  That isn't just tax  Off of its populace  We need to go back  To when things  Are being made  And invented  And sold  And produced  That makes jobs  I was just talking  Earlier about NASA  The fact that like  NASA's been pretty much  Dismantled  We don't even have  A ship that could take 
[02:03:30]  Astronauts up to  The space station  That we pretty much  Finance  And brought all the  Stuff up to it  And we gotta pay Russia  To taxi us up there  It's preposterous  And the thought that  You know  Gingrich comes out  And says moon bases  As a headline  It sounds so wacky  But to get the space station  Up to par  Where they could plan  Something like that  The byproduct of it  Are jobs  And new inventions  And products  That are marketed  To the civilian population  If you look at everything  That we use today  That's technology  It all came out 
[02:04:00]  From either the space race  Or the military  Right  Well we gotta go to the moon  Newt's saying it  We have to go  We have to do this  It may be  Now may not be the time though  Like you know  He wants a 51st state  I don't know if I can say it today  Like you know  Let's get our shit back together  And then maybe we can  Talk about the moon  His timing was bad  With the whole moon thing  Yeah I think it's probably  A little pretty much  In this world  When we can't pay our own bills  And we can't put our kids  Into schools that  You know  Are decent  And we have  You know  What I love lately  Is watching these like  Teachers union ads  Like criticizing Bloomberg  It's like  Oh yeah  Yeah well 
[02:04:30]  Bloomberg's on a lousy job  Really  And you're trying to tell him  Your biggest agenda  Is to say that a teacher  That's been there for 20 years  Who does a shitty job  Yeah  Should not be fired  Like who are you  To tell anyone  That they're doing a bad job  With education  It's such a hypocritical thing  And that's basically  What this country's become  It's like  All these special interests  You know  They're just representing  A party that shouldn't  Be represented  Like you gotta force people  To step up their game  Well we listen  We listen to the  Special interest groups  Though for some reason  Yeah  They think they should be  Impervious to everything  That other people  Face every day  Like if you're not 
[02:05:00]  Doing your job  You should be fired  I think it was in the post  Today somewhere  It was like  It was like that  There was like  30 teachers that were like  Made basic  Grammar and spelling errors  While teaching English  To children  And it's like  And you know  Showed up late  Or drunk  And they can't fire them  Can't fire them?  Why?  I don't know man  There's gotta be a point  Like you know  That doesn't fly  Like in the private sector  Like if that person  Shows up to my work  And gone  Like you know  It's that simple  And like maybe that  Makes me a bad guy  But like I'm not there  To subsidize someone else's  Stupidity  Like the threat 
[02:05:30]  The reason you go in  With many jobs  There are a few jobs  And I'm lucky to have one  Where I enjoy doing this  And you can do  Whatever you want  And by the way  If you showed up drunk  You get better ratings  That's for sure  It goes against the grain  But I know what he's gonna say  If you know you're not  Gonna get fired  They're gonna slack  A little bit  And the threat  Of being fired  Is your motivation  For a lot of people  It's like  I need this job  I need the money  So I don't want  To get fired  So if you take  That threat away  And say  Boy they can't fire me 
[02:06:00]  I don't necessarily  Like this job  So why would I do  A good job  And listen  I get that some of those jobs  Are also thankless jobs  You know and yeah  After 20 years  It could get old  But that doesn't mean  That if my kid  Was in that school  That I would  I don't find it acceptable  You know that  This guy's gonna  Fine you don't like it  You're a little jaded  You're bored with it  Fine go find  Something else to do  Right  You know or if you're  Gonna be subsidized  By the government  Like don't just sit at home  And do nothing  Like make them do  Mandatory like community service  Or something like that  Something to contribute  Yeah 
[02:06:30]  Instead of just being a burden  You think they could fire  Pat Sajak  Well he was drunk  Apparently a couple of times  By the way I kind of love that  Because I mean that show  I can't think of anything  More boring than that show  And I've put it out there  A couple times  And people like  People really do like that show  Because I like  And it's not just grandmothers  Because that's what my  Grandmother used to watch  So if I was spending time  With them I'd be like  You know  Forced to watch this crap  I'm saying like  I don't get it  Maybe because I'm bad at it  I'm surprisingly bad  At Wheel of Fortune  Like I'm really good at Jeopardy  I can get through  Like I can run  Like the thing on Jeopardy  How can you be bad 
[02:07:00]  At Wheel of Fortune  I don't know  Tang man  I'm just not good  At Wheel of Fortune  It's hard to figure those words out  Without letters  I'm good at Jeopardy  Which I think is a much more  Challenging game  But I suck at Wheel of Fortune  But there's a guy  I actually gained respect for him  By saying hey  He got hammered beforehand  I love that he admitted  He was getting hammered on the job  31 years on the air  We were talking about this  A little earlier  Yeah  What a boring job that would be  Torrible  Alright spin the wheel  Go ahead  I want to know what happened  With him and Vanna now  In the back room  As they're drinking  Because this  This could be kind of interesting  You get a little loose 
[02:07:30]  When you're having a beverage or two  Of course  You gotta think  It might have been some  Touchy-feely going on  What are you playing  Wheel of Fortune over there  Sam  It's not boring  It's exciting  Awesome  Yeah  Great  I mean yeah  Pat Sajak is very famous  And stuff  But who cares  That's like a really boring gig  Yeah  I don't know how you sit there  For 31 years  Unless you are  Having a few cocktails  At the same time  I'm sure  TV money's pretty good  You're on there for 31 years  I'm sure he's not exactly  You know  It's a pretty good gig 
[02:08:00]  I mean it could be a lot worse  It's an easy life though  I mean listen  The show  What  It can't be more  It's a half an hour show  So they could probably film  Like four in a day  Yeah  You work two  Three days a week  You know  He tried the talk show route  For a little while  That should have worked  Didn't pan out  I think the timing was bad  Because I think he  He could pull that off  Yeah I don't know  That it's as easy as it  You know like  The whole talking thing  Like you guys see it  I mean not everyone  Can come in here  And talk for four hours a day  And you know  They just have to talk  How hard is that  Listen you can go  The Springer route  Which could be interesting 
[02:08:30]  Right  They have to get what  38 to 40 minutes of material  Oh my god  I'd love that  How is that hard  Oh would that be  All the easiest things  I think you just need  The personality for it  I don't know that  Everyone has it  Yeah I guess that's where  We lose  TV personality  Face for radio  Alright we're going to break  We got Donald Trump Jr.  Sitting in for Jim Norton  What do you want to talk  About next  Because it's easy with you 
[02:09:00]  For me it's like  I'll talk about anything  I don't really care  I can  But I want like new subjects  Because we talk politics  With you  Fly fishing and shooting  So I want to try to go  Somewhere else  I'm trying to think  Whatever you guys  Come up with  I'll think of something  Why do we have to come up with it  I guess it's a little different  I'm used to being interviewed  So now if I'm part of the show  Then it's got to be  A little different  Could you give us a hint  I'll come up with something  Between now and then  Hollywood celebrities  What's going on in celebrity world  I don't know  Justin Bieber  I saw you took your kids 
[02:09:30]  To the Jingle Ball  I took my daughter  To Jingle Ball  Which she loved  And I  Despised  Not quite your scene  When I'm there  And I'm watching these  40 year old moms  Screaming  It looks like something  Out of the Beatles  And I'm just like  I don't get it man  I don't think of  Today's music  As quite the same  As music from the past  And that's probably  Because I'm an old bastard  So it's just different 
[02:10:00]  We'll talk about music  And what he likes  That's what we're going to do  Alright stay there  This is the Opie Anthony Channel  Dei Buchi  Wo Mii La Lu  Čing Ni Bang Ma  On Sirius XM  And now a reading  From the book of Ted  When the wine was gone  Ted had his disciples  Fill the drugs with water  And then a miracle occurred  And Ted said  I took water  And I turned it into crystal light  The wine was now crystal light  When the food was gone  Ted's disciples gathered 
[02:10:30]  And the Lord Ted proclaimed  I took a bunch of fishes  And turned them into more fishes  By cutting them in half  I had thirty fishes  And I should like present  E with sixty half fishes  It was the second miracle  Ted had performed  And Ted then divided  The fish among them  I'm working miracles  The king was not impressed  And ordered Ted to be arrested  Oh no  They misunderstood me  Ted shouted  As he tried to explain himself  I had an erection  It was tending out  My robe beautifully 
[02:11:00]  But the guards  Just ignored him  And Ted was taken away  The Lord Ted  Was to be crucified  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting  Ted shouted  As the nails were driven  Into his flesh  As the crowd looked on  Ted looked to the people  And announced  I have it  I have it  Not  You go  It's boring  Whatever that means  This has been a reading  From the book of Ted  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  This  Is the O.P. Anthony show 
[02:11:30]  All right  We're building a good room  Today  Friday  We got Donald Trump Jr.  Sitting in for Jim Norton  I want to plug the Twitter there  Donald  Cool  I'm starting to call you Donald  You don't need that Jr. thing  I don't think  I usually go with Don  It's just  Don?  There's one Donald  Should we go with Don?  I usually go with Don  Is it lowercase for distinction?  But it's Donald J. Trump Jr. 
[02:12:00]  You don't have to spill out Jr. on Twitter  And now we got to say hi to Adam Farrar  Hey  Nice to be back fellas  My pal  Sure  There were like many different conversations going on during that break  Oh yeah  We haven't seen each other  When was the last time we saw each other?  I know it's been a while  Probably the last time you were here  Last time he was  I think it was  I was here with Dennis last time  Yeah  That was the last time we were here  Yeah with Leary  Adam's telling me about his exploits with the vehicles now  Which is just beyond me  Because as you know Adam was never  His strong suit was never cars 
[02:12:30]  Never driving  Now he's got a big car show  And now he's on Top Gear  And he was just rattling off cars and what he's doing with them  He's showing me videos of him like Hal Needham  He's driving like a maniac  And uh  You've learned a lot huh?  It's so much friggin' fun  I mean he's right  When we were kids we started  You wouldn't even change your own oil  No we changed the oil  I wouldn't do it right  I can change the oil  No I was totally wrong  I can gap a spark plug with a guitar pick  And  Right  We did that 
[02:13:00]  Did that  And we could smack a solenoid to get the starter stone  But when it comes to the brakes  We screwed that up big time  You're trying to change brakes?  We did at my house  Me and Anthony  The brakes  And then Adam wiped his hands on his father's chamois  That he uses to dry the car off with  So it's all greasy  He just came in  He looked at us  He goes  My good chamois  And then we were just like  Two dopey asses  Get out of the garage  Yeah  Come on get done  Get out  Yeah but Top Gear's a lot of fun  It comes back  Valentine's Day  February 14th  Tuesday at 9 o'clock  Why don't you get in in a car? 
[02:13:30]  I was just talking  You've got to come out and do it  I'll get out there  Come out and be a big star in a small car  And just rip around the track  I'll do that  You hear the invite there?  Very just vague  You've got to come out  I'll pick you up  You know that was some PR person's line  That he just was like  Be a big star in a little car  You know how many times we've heard that over the years?  Next time you're in LA stop by  Oh really?  I'll be in the door  I am coming to your house  Picking you up and taking you out there  And we're going to have some fun  Oh man  Yeah?  And your father actually is going to be a guest on our show  Oh really?  Cool  Yeah  You filmed it already? 
[02:14:00]  Yes  Was he nice?  He was a sweetheart  It was great  Yeah we're back in good terms with him  I think because of Don here  Yeah  I think that whole thing was a little goofy  You had a little problem  You're like Tessio  You're making peace  Yeah listen  You may have got him on a bad day  You know  It was a big misunderstanding  He's pretty cool  He's not  You know  Yeah  He's kind of like me  When he's you know  When he lets down that facade as well  I mean he's you know  He's pretty chill  He's a pretty funny guy actually  He called us slobs  And he goes  Well  Those two slobs  I'll never do their show again  Close fit  Right  And then 
[02:14:30]  And then he was on recently  So he's doing the show again  Did you earn it?  Earn what?  Slob  Earn the  Earn the  Not really  It was a misunderstanding  I forget  He was in a big controversy with somebody  And then he was on our show  And that's where  And that's where they got all the sound bites from  And I  I said something like  Oh and  What did I say?  But we didn't like Rosie either  I'm trying to remember  It was  Yeah I was going to say  I think he'd be more your demo than Rosie  Exactly  I basically bragged that  I basically bragged that Donald  Called our show to trash Rosie 
[02:15:00]  He felt like you were making it seem like  He wasn't a booked guest  That he just wanted to call the show  Yeah it was  What?  Yeah it was  Honestly in the end it was really a misunderstanding  Yeah  I'm so glad we got past it  But what  What is his quote from the  From the paper that day?  That was a good one  Donald  Read the whole thing  Okay  The whole thing says  Donald Trump will never be a guest on  Opie and Anthony again  The XM satellite radio duo  Begged him to come on recently  To discuss his feud with Rosie O'Donnell  Trump agreed  But after his interview  The shock jocks 
[02:15:30]  Sent out a press release  Which I don't think we did  The company did by the way  Yeah  Trump had called into the show  Implying he was hungry for publicity  And this is the quote  Everybody in the world  Was trying to get me on their show  I turned down Larry King  Trump told Page Six  The idea that I called these two slobs  Is laughable  See he fits in a lot better than you think  That's great  See most people would be bummed  I call these two slobs  Most people would be bummed out by that  But I went home  And I had a little skip in my step  I'm like Donald Trump called me a slob 
[02:16:00]  He acknowledged me  Yeah I know where the problem was  You know XM got so excited  That we were part of the story  That they pushed out some kind of press release  And then  Exactly  Then got out of hand  Horse shit  But because of Don  He's now  Bringing you back into the fold  I think so  I think so  You didn't work on your cards growing up  Did you?  You know what  My brother's actually a fanatic at it  I mean I do a little bit  So I can do the stuff that you're talking about now  The basics you know  I think with a lot of  You know modern fuel injection  And computer shit  Like it's just not as fun 
[02:16:30]  But like my brother's redoing a 1970 Camaro  Like you know  He took it down  See that's fine  Yeah like he  Because it's easy  You know  Because I mean basically  That looks like the visible V8  The model you had built  Right  You remember that  It's like alright  Here's the air cleaner  I take it off  There's a carburetor under it  And it  Spark plugs  Yeah I drive a 1970 Toyota FJ  On the weekend  So it's like yeah  I mean I have to go in  And squirt some accelerant  Down into the carburetor  And get it started  If I haven't used it in a week  And you have to tinker a little bit  So I can do that  But I'm not a  Did your dad teach you to drive  No  Did he have a person for that 
[02:17:00]  My grandfather taught me to drive  Yeah  So I spent a lot of time  With my grandfather  Growing up in you know  What was then  You know communist Czechoslovakia  He kind of  I think we discussed it last time  Which was like  He saw kind of the life  I led in New York  He's like well you have to see  Like you know  He's a blue collar guy  He's like you have to see  The other side of that  So you know I learned to drive stick  At like a really young age  And you know  Wait I don't think you ever  Talked about that on our show  Did I  I do because people ask  Kind of how you turned out  Relatively normal  Or not totally fucked up  Wait you  You left New York City  For how many years  No I didn't leave New York City  But what I would do  Is I'd spend like six weeks 
[02:17:30]  With him in you know  Czechoslovakia  In the early 80s  From when I was like two  Through like twelve  And so you know  We were up in like his cabin  In the mountains  And you know in a place  Where you know  The president of the country  Made thirty grand a year  So it was  Wow  I had friends  I speak the language fluently  So I learned pretty young  That it's like  What I experienced and had  In New York  Was not the norm  To not take it for granted  And I think it was probably  One of the best life lessons  I could have got  Because you kind of  You know  You see things  From both perspectives  And so I think  You know my grandfather  Recognized that early  And so he kind of  You know was the guy 
[02:18:00]  That started teaching me  All these other things  And that's how I got  Into the outdoor stuff  And why did he stay over there  Why did he come to America  He came over here  You know  He didn't like it  It wasn't his thing  I mean he came over  You know to see us  And to spend time  But I think  You know he was  He was a regular guy  He was like  This guy just content to be  How did you do that  What did you do  Over your summer vacation  Grandpa taught me  How to drive a stick  And plan a resistance  Yeah  Take on the communists  Do you still drive  With the bright blinker on  All the time  Grandpa teaches you to drive  You're doing a few things  You need to wear the hat  Yeah 
[02:18:30]  Wow that's cool  And the gloves  Yeah the driving gloves  Don't forget the driving gloves  Goggles  Now I don't believe  In the horseless carriage  But a few kids  Are going to do it  What did you do for fun there  Do you remember  Listen  I spent a lot of time  In the woods  You know  I had friends  The usual stuff  That's why you like  The hunting  BB guns  With friends  Cause trouble  Blow some stuff up  Minor arson  A lot better ordinance there 
[02:19:00]  Probably than that  Definitely  You can find some  Interesting stuff over there  That's why you like  The hunting and fishing  That's how I got into it  I guess  Wow  No you never talked about that  That's kind of cool  Yeah that's kind of  All the other stuff I do  Right  You still go there  Have you been back  I haven't been back  In a while  My grandmother's still alive  So like I basically  You know I got to plan  Kind of like a trip  This summer  Cause you don't know  How long that  You know she's like 85  So it's like  Every trip you plan out  Is probably the last one  So it's like  She's hanging on  It doesn't sound nice  But I'm a realist  Like it's like  I don't know  No one lives forever 
[02:19:30]  Like just recognize that  And get on with life  Like if you sit there  Being afraid of it  Like you're just not  Going to enjoy it  So I'm going to try  To get out there this summer  Okay  We used to have  This could be  Grandma's last Christmas  12 years  It was too long  By the end  By the year 12  You're saying  Like I really hope it is  Like this is getting ridiculous  She was 92 with one leg  She was like  She was hanging in there  She's a dodge dart  You couldn't kill it  She just kept running  She was hanging in there  Yeah  I had an older  Grandmother 
[02:20:00]  From the other side  Of the family  From my father's side  And she  It ended up where  We would go over there  For Christmases  And she just became  Part of this chair  In the corner  She never spoke  She just sat there  With the mouth going  And you had to say  Hi  I think her name was  Like Aletta  Some weird old  Ancient name  A name they've retired  Oh yeah  That name's been retired  Yeah  And you had to  Give her a little kiss  It's now an incantation  And then walk away  And no one ever  Paid any more attention to her 
[02:20:30]  She just sat there  That was her job  As the matriarch  You should have  Freeze dried her  Like they do with the pets  Like Mick Foley was telling us  I don't think we want  To freeze dried Aletta  Why?  If she's not doing anything anyway  You could keep her around  For a few more years  Yeah  Best she just wasn't  In that chair  Because after that chair went  After she went  And the chair went  The whole place  Got like a makeover  You ever notice  Sometimes it takes  The grandparents  To like kind of  You get out of the way  You get rid of that smell  Yeah yeah  The smell  The furniture  You paint the walls  You take down that wallpaper  That looks like 
[02:21:00]  It's from the Haunted Mansion  Yeah  It's got like the  Velveteen in it  And candelabras in gold  You're like  What the  What the  Anything creepier than  Sitting or sleeping  In like grandma's shit  After she died  Oh no  It's gotta go  Oh god  And those faded pictures  That nobody knows  Who the hell they are  Moneyball smell  You know she died  In the chair  You're watching TV  It's like a cartoon  The picture eyes  Are following you  On the wall  It's Giggles Flintstone  Oh remember getting nice  Oh Bretta  And I'm gonna poke his eyes out

[02:22:00]  When I first started  Working there  There used to be  A woman in a banana suit  Outside in between shows  I was like  You know  Just check your dignity  At the door  It's all over  There was a place  There was a place  In Rhode Island  With a duck on the roof  It was a comedy connection  It was an old bank  And it had an inflatable  Duck on the roof  It was called Quackers  I was like  Oh just shoot me  Do I really need  My cable bill paid this month  And I went  Yes I do  You didn't feel like  You made it  Because you were playing Quackers  I finally  I'm here  I arrived 
[02:22:30]  I made it to Quackers  I could be in Czechoslovakia  Learning how to drive a stick  I think that's cool man  I think it's great  I don't get to travel enough  I wanna check out  Some of these places  It also gets old though  I mean I travel so much  For work now  That I mean  I've done like day trips  To China and India  When you're on the ground  For less than you're on  In the air  On a mission  Listen for real estate  You gotta go there  You gotta see it  You gotta kick the tires  Jump out of the plane  The first time I went to India  I got so sick  And I did everything right too 
[02:23:00]  And I travel all over the world  I've hunted all over the world  So I've been into pretty shady areas  It's not like I have a weak stomach  But man  Whatever the hell I got over there  I was blowing out of both ends  For three days  Oh man  Two weeks after I got back  Friends would see me  And be like  Dude you look sick  Like you look kind of green  This was two weeks after  I was in theory better  Like I was septic  And so now I like  For some of these countries  I have like a 36 hour policy  Because that's as long as I can go  Without eating or drinking anything  Right  Yeah  And not being in like a comatose state  Get on the plane  But it also gets old 
[02:23:30]  Start eating on the plane  You know what you ate  That caused that  I don't  You know  I was  You know  Good  I must have had  Something that had  Something in it  And  That wasn't quite cooked  That wasn't quite cooked  But man dude  I wanted  Had I had a weapon with me  I would have killed myself  It was that bad  No I'm not joking  Like you think I'm joking  But I'm not  Like  The pain  It was horrible  You uh  That brings back a memory  It happened to me  With mayonnaise on the beach  Oof  I decided to let  Yeah  That's silly to do  I decided to let my potato salad  Just kind of sit there for a while 
[02:24:00]  And I've done that too  Because like  You know  On the fishing or hunting  You go get something at  You know  Off 17  At one of like  The gas station like delis  It's like  It sits for like six hours  And you eat it  And be like  I don't know  It still tastes pretty good  But you're definitely  Taking your life  Into your own hands  Rich up there in Roscoe  Gave me a Hammond Swiss  With a lot of mayonnaise  I'm like really  This thing might go bad  I dry heaved from my butt though  Oh god  That's hard to do in waiters  What  No not  Fill up your waiters 
[02:24:30]  I'm going back to the beach story  Back to the beach story  To the point where your body  Is officially done  Getting rid of whatever  It had to get rid of  But it's still like  Thinking there's something in there  Still trying  You start dry heaving  From your own head  Your butt looks like a guppy  It's pulsating  There's got to be something else  You like China?  You know listen  In terms of places to visit  It's probably  You know  It's low on my list  It's  You don't like it?  Don't take the double happiness bus  It's filthy man  Really? 
[02:25:00]  At least India  That feels like  There's a semblance of like  Culture  Really?  Yeah  As nasty as that can be  But like  China  It's one of those places  Like I really  If I could never go back  I probably wouldn't  I mean it's too good  A business opportunity  But like  I'll avoid it at all costs  Like it's  You know  No one smiles  They walk around  Hacking all over  Just like spitting all over  It's part of like  The customs  And everyone smokes  And it's just  You know  India's filthy  In its own way  But like  There's some vibrance  To the people  And they're  As destitute as some of them 
[02:25:30]  Can be  Like they're happy  And it's  It's just this emotionless  Kind of trotting  And plodding along  They're just robotic man  It's so robotic  Go back to India for a second  My brother-in-law  Had to do a lot of work there  So he was going back and forth  And what he found amazing  Was he's on a street  And there's Mercedes  Yep  And then extremely poor people  Just all using the same street  I've had that where  He couldn't wrap his mind around it  No I mean I've had it where  You know  Take like the worst traffic  You would imagine in New York City  Right  Put like 10% of the cars  Being like Mercedes  High-end cars 
[02:26:00]  Put you know  Everything else that you'd have  In New York City  And then add like 400 rickshaws  Like per block  And people walking  In scooters  Like you can't fathom  Like they have a different  Sense of space  Because like you couldn't do it  In New York without creating accidents  There's cows in the street  There's chickens  You'll see someone be like  I gotta take a dump  They'll just stop  And like take a dump  In the middle of the road  Like next to your car  Like they'll hold onto your window  While they're like squatting  And taking shit in the street  You could be at a stoplight  You're in a Mercedes  Let's say  And next to you  Is a guy on a yak  Yeah  And it's completely normal there 
[02:26:30]  But then  Then he's in a really nice hotel  Because he's going over there for work  And really nice hotels  And then shit all around it  Well that's the thing  There's no like zoning  It's not like there's a nice area  Like there's not a park avenue  Because it's  You have like a building  Or like Microsoft headquarters  Right  And then like next to it  Is like miles of shantytown  And then like another  Really nice building  And miles of shantytown  There's not like a zone  That's like  Rich and poor over there  Oh yeah  There'll be a revolution soon at all  No  No  That's the  I don't know man  I need 
[02:27:00]  Yeah we need space as Americans  We think we don't have it  Even in Manhattan  When the sidewalks are crowded  And the streets are crowded  But when you  Yeah  Think that there's going to be  A yak next to you  And someone crapping  And just multitudes of people  In these  These shopping bazaars  No you wouldn't get anywhere  In New York  But it's like  They figured out how to move  Within that  It's sort of  Like they don't drive  In like lanes  They drive wherever  Wherever it's open  Well the only resource  They have is  Is workforce  Humans  That's all they have  There's really nothing  Tech support  That's it 
[02:27:30]  We'll answer the phones all night  Give us a call  But they're humans  They do have a good education  I mean there's more  Gifted children in India  Than there are children  In the United States  Yeah but there's no right  Natural resources  Like genius children  There's more of them in India  Than there are  Just regular children  In the United States  That's all about  But it's a waste  It's a little scary  But it's a waste right  Because do those kids  Grow up to be anybody  Honestly over there  It's the hard part  About doing business  Over there  Is that you go  And everyone's entrepreneurial  So everything is like  Well that's my friend's site  Well it's not really my friend  It's my cousin's best friend  Well it's not really his  It's you know  Down the line 
[02:28:00]  Like everyone basically  Tries to work themselves  Somehow into a deal  And everyone's really  Entrepreneurial  So they're so much more driven  Than in the US  That you see  There's no one  Basically sitting  They'll get in there  And they'll mix it up  They may not even know  What they're doing  But they're going to try  To figure it out  And really work  And so it's scary  In the sense that  You see so many people  That are so motivated  To do something  You're saying  I don't know  That's not necessarily  The image that I always  See in the US anymore  Yeah a lot of doctors  Come from India too  Yeah a lot of doctors  They really put a premium  On their education 
[02:28:30]  The standards  Like you come here  They're giving like  Butt injections  At an apartment in Queens  And some woman's ass falls off  Silicon injections  And they got the silicon  From the auto parts store  Yeah  My cousin did  The window car  It's just the same crap  Come on  I could pick up  A whole case of Lowe's  We put it in a Ziploc bag  It'll contain it  Yeah  We've had a few of those  In New York City  Oh yeah  You're never going to see  An Indian space program  Yeah  Well it'll go up  What was the one  In Chinatown  The one in Chinatown  Where they put the lady  Out by the curb  To die 
[02:29:00]  Yeah yeah  They didn't know  What else to do  They just shot a bunch  Of regular industrial silicone  Into her ass cheeks  There's been a few of those  And made it just giant  Made a giant ass  And it just started  Getting into the system  And breaks down  Your immune system  And that's it  Goodbye  So long  That's amazing  And then instead of  Fixing it  They just kind of  Put her out back  We'll chug that up  As a failed experiment  Yeah yeah  Well we know what  Not to do  Oops  Hey look  You gotta break a few eggs  Adam what else 
[02:29:30]  Is going on with you  It's been a while  Yeah it's been a long time  I'm back out  I'm spending a lot of time  Out there in Santa Monica  Yeah  Santa Monica's nice  Santa Monica's nice  Yeah we got that  And we were talking about room  Like we got room now  Yeah  It's like I got  You know when you live  In New York City  It's like  You get  I can't even get gifts  For Christmas  Like we bought you this picture  Look I got no friggin room  I got nothing  So now I can like stretch out  So I'm like  I haven't had  I'm buying a desktop computer  And I'm thrilled  Because I've only had a laptop  For so long  Because you had no room  No friggin room  But he's right 
[02:30:00]  When you live in New York  And you get your relatives  Buying your stuff  It's like  I can't put this anywhere  We don't have houses  And when you have kids  It gets so much worse  Right  You can't tell them  No they can't have that  To a certain point  You try to do it  As best you can  But like  They just accumulate crap  And you can't get rid  Of the old stuff  How can you have kids  And you have to like  Bonsai them  So they don't  Bind them  Yeah  Bind your children  No vitamins for you  Or food today  We need to keep you  Paid  It's unbelievable  You're right  But now you don't care  If people send you stuff 
[02:30:30]  Now it's nice  Now I got the room  And read it out  And just traveling a lot  I'm doing stand up again  Which is cool  But you're doing a lot of  Press for this  I started a NASCAR race  Did I tell you guys that  Yeah  They invited me to go  To the Top Gear 300  In North Carolina  The other guys  That wave the flag  That was me  Oh  That was me  That was me  And I was scared to death  Because you don't want  To be like  You know  Because they  You don't want to  Fuck it up  Yeah  But they're doing cool  You see the little ribbons  They get  That's going  I'm just picturing myself  Like I'm like  The gymnast  With the spirally thing  Like go  Not looking good 
[02:31:00]  Not looking very manly  Right  There's an actual system  To that whole thing  They do  They have this wrist thing  So I was  You had to work  The wrist thing  Yeah  Figure eights  What is it  Yeah  I did the figure eights  Which is closest  That's the only thing  I could think of to do  But  Yeah  That's friggin  I've never been  Don't worry Adam  The real men  The real men are in the car  So you're just  You're waving a flag  Relax  But you're basically  A cheerleader  You know that right  Yeah  Yeah  You know what the freakiest thing is  They put our posters everywhere  Like on plates  We were on the side 
[02:31:30]  Of a prison bus  There's a prison bus  With like top gear  And there's theirs  I took a picture of it  With the prisoners in it  They're still waving  And shit  Yeah  I've never been to a race  I've never been either  And they were real friendly  And shit  And I'm up there  And I was all nervous  And when you're up there  Those cars are doing  Like a buck ninety  And they come around there  And I swear  With the vibrations  When they go under you  Your balls hum  I was like  It's like this big metal tub  And I was like  Oh I get it now  That's what all these fucking  Because you're over the track  Yeah  You're pretty much 
[02:32:00]  Over the track  Yeah  Wow  That is insanity  And the only thing I can think of  Remember when the bison  Took us to Jersey  To the drag races  To the drag race  At the English town  Yeah  Who's the bison  Sean  Sean  Yeah  He calls his name  Bison because he had a giant forehead  That went like straight up  And then like a tuft of hair  On top of that  Yeah  He looked like  He was on a buffalo nickel  Yeah  He looked like a bison  So we called him bison  And everybody felt the need  When he was sitting there  Watching television  To just go  Tag  And you'd smack him  On the forehead  And leave a handprint 
[02:32:30]  Because you could get  Your entire four fingers  On his head  That's how big it was  It was like a four  Tag  So he took us  To English town  New Jersey  For the drag races  In the middle of this  In July  And it was nothing  But black pavement  That is all over  The heat  Was stifling  Before you add  Multiple thousand  Horsepower engines  Exactly  Now you're adding  Jet cars  It just was  One of the worst  Experiences ever  We found  And we're drunk  Yeah because we had a drink 
[02:33:00]  Keep yourself hydrated  Keep yourself hydrated  More beer  More beer  We found like a piece of shade  And just sat there  Pouring water over our heads  And booze in our mouths  Yeah  We found a cross breeze  Between the pits  And we were just sitting there  It feels  It's only 102 here  Instead of 118  It is out there  It's wonderful  So at the NASCAR place  They camp out  Like I've never been  They camp out  Like all kinds  In the infield  It's like the ultimate tailgate  Yeah but it's just like  All kinds of campers 
[02:33:30]  And all confederate flags  Yeah yeah  They kind of brought  That along with them  That's the demo  Yeah yeah  I was wondering  Who still bought those  But you're lost  You know if you lose  Your job at Foot Locket  Take off the referee uniform  You're done  There's all kinds of shit  All over the place  But it's a whole  Whole thing down there  They were really nice  A whole culture  It's huge  It's the biggest  The most watched sport  I guess  And they let you go  Into pits and stuff  Which is great  It's like  If you go see the Mets  You can sit in a dugout  They're like sitting there  Yelling at each other 
[02:34:00]  It's really cool  Yeah I don't know  I think like 250,000 people  Show up to like a race  It makes the Super Bowl  Look like a baby  Yeah  Didn't you go  You sent me a video  Of you on the track  Oh yeah  I went to Pocono  With the Mustang  What were you  Driving your Mustang  Oh yeah  It was a lot of fun man  I had one of the guys  One of the instructors  In the passenger seat  And I just opened it up  They have like a one mile straight  Over there  So I came off  Of the third turn  And just  The Supercharger kicks in  How fast again?  I got it up to about 
[02:34:30]  This is the first lap  I got it up to about  180 I guess  Wow  But it's deceiving too  Because the track is so wide  And the car is pretty small  But I come flying out  Around that last corner  We can hear you coming  Yeah  And it was so weird  To hear the Supercharger  Actually going for so long  Because I usually  Just get little bursts of it  You're in good shape  By the wall  Oh yeah  It was like inches  Off of that wall 
[02:35:00]  That's scary  It's fun  And the 180's  You're friggin moving  I did  We shot this thing  At Fontana  With muscle cars  So I was in  A five liter Mustang  Which tops out at 153  Last time I looked down  It was like 141  And I couldn't look down  Those last couple miles an hour  Are hard to get out of them  And the odd thing is  You don't want to even look down  For a second  To see how fast you're going  So you're just kind of locked  You're so fixated  When you drive normally  On the roads  You're scanning your mirrors  And you're kind of looking  Next to the girl over here 
[02:35:30]  You are so focused  Out your windshield  The whole time  That's it  You are just looking  And looking ahead  What's behind me  Fuck it  Yeah this is inside  One of the stock cars  I had another one  Sounds a bit like  A lawnmower  Yeah it does  How fast is it  Czechoslovakia  That's a Yugo stock car  Look at that  That's your point of view  How fast is this now  This is about 150  I guess  Jesus  140  150 
[02:36:00]  And then going into the curves  It was nice  You get beat up man  It's fun though  It was the NASCAR experience  That they do over there  At the Pocono Raceway  They just throw you in  A NASCAR  Let you go  It's great  We had that  We did it in Fontana  We were in muscle cars  And then the NASCARs  Flew by us  They're like angry  Painted dinosaurs  Just  You can feel it  You're just terrified  Yeah  And you're hyper focused  Like you said  Because everything is  Working at the same time  And you have to have 
[02:36:30]  Instant reflexes  And your peripheral vision  Open up  You have to have  Those reflexes  And I have  None of it  None  My ADD is just  Kicking in  It's like  Oh I'm gonna die  In this friggin thing  That's the worst  When you're also  Hanging on there  Just barely  And these guys  Blow by you  And you're saying  How is it even possibly  How are they doing that  I got  Well cause  One of the guys  On the show  Is a professional  Race driver  Tanner  He's a stunt guy  So we did this thing  Last season  Where I'm in a ZR1  Which is very cool  Cause they have  The heads up display  It actually projects  It up on the windshield  So you can see  All your instruments  Like a fighter pilot 
[02:37:00]  Like a fighter pilot  So you don't take  Your hands off  Or take your eyes down  So I'm in a ZR1  And he's chasing me  In the 458  The new Ferrari  And you know  We gotta go past  The cameras  So I come into the turn  I'm too fast  Into the turn  I'm out of shape  I hit the brakes  The ABS is kicking back  So we get back to  We get back to base camp  And he comes out  And he goes  Adam don't you  You're friggin  We're out of shape  In that turn  You're going too fast  Didn't you feel  The ABS kicking back  I'm like  Yeah  Look I need that shit  That's why it's in there  That's why it's there  For people like me 
[02:37:30]  Race boy  You suck  It's such a different world  I have a buddy  That used to race for Ferrari  He won like Le Mans  And you drive with him  In his own car  And you're just sitting there  And meanwhile  He's just like  Ho hum  One hand on the wheel  So in control  It's just a different  It's a different level  Mindset  They take you  When you do this  Stock car challenge  They take you around  The track first  With the driver  In the driver's seat  You're in the passenger seat  And he takes you around  For a lap  And lets you know  Here's where you're  Going to let off  A little bit  Come down to this cone  In the turn 
[02:38:00]  Come back out  Right on the wall  Take the straight down  So it gives you  That little lesson  And he's doing it  And talking to you  At the same time  And looking at you  At speed  Turning his head  Looking at you  And I'm just sitting there  Like  And then you get in the car  And you realize  Like I really don't have  This line down  I'm not on the wall  Like I should be  The first time around  I'm letting off the gas  Too soon  I'm not getting on it  Soon enough  In the turn  And the thing is  The second you go  To figure it out  Yeah it's over  You do it's over  I'm like god damn 
[02:38:30]  I want another 10 laps  But when you do hit it right  It's like hitting a golf ball right  Yeah  When you swing out of a turn  And you cut that apex perfect  And sling up into the wall  And you're 6 inches off of that wall  And you landed there  You didn't have to edge it over  From 2 feet off  Yeah  You know you just came off the wall  And did it  It's so good  It's like man  Alright  Fuck that  I'm kicking ass  We did it  No desire  Oh it's fun  The way you hit it right  You want to do it  I always like the same way  But when I  I started  I went to stunt school 
[02:39:00]  In Jersey  I was telling Ant  During the break  And you learn how to do  Reverse 180s  And J-turns  And all this  Oh like movie shit  Movie shit  For movie guys  And the cars  They're all police cars  But they're all set up  With hydraulic e-brakes  So you don't stretch your mouth  And everything  And that's fun  Come with me to Jersey  Come see Mike Burke with me in Jersey  And we'll do that once  And you'll be like  Oh we gotta get one of these  Cause it's great  Do they blow up the cars and stuff  While you're driving them  Nah there's no gunfire  Damn  You know what else is fun  We did an episode  Going through fire  Airborne  The super light trucks 
[02:39:30]  I think I sent you the picture  Of that little  Yeah  Little trucks with  Mazda rotary engines in it  And they  It's off road  So you fly  Actually flying through the air  And you land  It's like a flying sofa  Cause you don't feel anything  Cause there's  Two sets of shocks  Gas shocks  Like the Baja trucks  Yeah  Those little super light trucks  They're called  Those are cool  Yeah  And we  Me and Rutt did it  And entered in a real race  And that's scary  Cause that's just like  These are real professional people  Yeah  And you know  When you're up in the air  It's fine  But then you gotta land 
[02:40:00]  And hope that you're  You're straight  And not a little squirrely  When you land  That's when they roll over  Yeah  When you hit  And the front wheels  Kind of turn  And  Oh well  I've done that  I used to ride  Like motocross  And stuff like that  Quite a bit  It's worse on a motorcycle  By the way  Oh I don't doubt it  Yeah  There's nothing really around you  I went over my handlebars  At 60 one time  And it was just like  Oh shit  It sucks  But yeah  The car's no fun either  Yeah yeah  You get a little shook up  Adam really is a car guy  I know  I don't know how it happened  It's fun man  You gotta come out 
[02:40:30]  It's just a lot of friggin fun  Yeah I'll do that  Did you film the new season?  We haven't seen it yet?  Yeah we're done with  The second season starts  February 14th  Valentine's Day  What channel is that  For the people on there?  History channel  9 o'clock  And we're on with Top Shot  They're on after us  Jeez  The guys with the guns  Look at you man  Yeah  It's about time  Yeah it's fun  We've been waiting for you  To make it like this  Yeah  Top Shot looks cool  You ever watch that?  I don't  Because you know  Some of the  And I've met a couple of guys on it  They're like legit  In their own field  But then  For the stuff that I do 
[02:41:00]  I know guys that compete  At such a level  It's like  Well you'll never beat him  In those things  But to then go throw a fork  At something  I don't know what it has to do  If you had a guy  That's shooting a real bow  And then a guy shooting  Go out shooting sporting clays  And then  I like guys that are  Well diversified  Not just one discipline  Type of shooter  But then it's like  Well we're going to  Throw an axe  It's like I don't know  I don't look at that  As a shooting discipline  You know what I mean  I hear you  It's a little hokey for me  I love the concept  But you know  I don't like those parts  And I can't watch  Reality television 
[02:41:30]  Like frankly  It's just not  Which is ironic  Given that I'm on reality television  I basically watch it  Because it's homework for me  But like  I don't watch most of those things  It's like  I don't watch them  Because so many of them  Are fake  And I don't understand  Anyone's fascination  With these god damn  Towing shows  Or like the hoarders  Like hoarders  Is a little interesting  Actually  We love hoarders  What's the one  Where they go to the garages  I'll watch crazy things  No I'm not into that either  Who cares  We love the hoarders though  Do you like  Did you see the strange addiction ones 
[02:42:00]  Where  I can't stop eating  The toilet tissue  What the fuck  I don't mind  Like weirdos  Yeah  Okay listen  What about the rock lady  I didn't see the rock lady  What was the rock lady  Oh we gotta play the clip  Again for people  She eats rocks  She eats rocks  Literally  She eats rocks  Rocks  Breaks them down  She's got a little hammer  Breaks them down  If they're too big  Crunches them  Yeah yeah  What kind of rocks  I can't imagine that  Being too good for your teeth  Onyx  Well I don't know  Ithmius  Marble  Marble is the preferable  We need someone  To find that clip  For Adam 
[02:42:30]  I saw the couch cushion lady  Couch cushion lady  We all saw  And the toilet paper lady  I like freak shows like that  I don't like any kind of reality show  Especially like I was saying  These dumb towing shows  Are all fake  The cameras  Are there too long  They show  And it's like  Whoever thinks they're real  Are morons  Well yeah  There's no way  That one person  Going from point A to point B  Runs into all of that crap  Yeah yeah  Every time  Every time  It's amazing  Every time  This guy's got the worst luck ever  It's like you know  And then how come  So let's drive into this tornado  I have to bring it back  To the garage in Beirut 
[02:43:00]  And this gunfire  And then they show the guy  Driving off with somebody's  Repoed car  Yeah  And the person's going  You son of a bitch  I'll get you  But the cameraman's  Standing right there  Watching the car  Driving away  If I'm that guy  I'm shooting the cameraman  Because I know  Cameraman's just as much  Of a prick as everybody else  And then all of a sudden  He's back in the car  What happened there?  Fake  And I hate fake reality shows  Hate them  That Hardcore Pawn  Is another 
[02:43:30]  One of the pawn shop ones  It's not Pawn Stars  Which has some legitimacy to it  But Hardcore Pawn  Is supposed to be in Detroit  So they got these  Unbelievably stereotyped  Local gentlemen and ladies  Coming in  Trying to sell like a Sega  Video game for 200 bucks  And when they tell them  This is a television motherfucker  Yeah yeah  When they tell them no  It's just like  Oh man you don't give me  And it's like  It's so fake  It's so  They're mic'd  You can see the mic  On their backpack  As they go  Well I'm leaving 
[02:44:00]  They leave the store  It's like  Is the sound man  Going to get his mic back?  There's just so many things  That she said  It's fake  And then people tweet me  And go  Dude you gotta see this  It's right up your alley  Shut up  It's phony y'all  Don't  If it's up anyone's alley  You should kill yourself  Yeah yeah  It's not up anyone's alley  Yeah a friggin  They're just trying to  Turn you on to something  They're trying to turn you  On to a nice new show  Thanks but no thanks  Yeah you don't like  The true TV ones huh  Can you show Rock Lady to Adam?  Yeah  What's Rock Lady?  Well you said  Strange Addiction  I can't believe you don't know 
[02:44:30]  The Rock Lady  I've never seen that either  I've never seen that either  The one that eats rocks  Yeah right from her driveway  Well actually I think  No she travels  To the place where she finds  The perfect rock  Yeah cause she only  She's like a sommelier of rocks  Huh?  Yes  She's picky about rocks  They have to be earthy and dirty  And they have to have  I think there are these type of rocks  That have like mica in them  And they're crumbly  So they're really like a sand  Like a sandstone type of thing  Yeah yeah  So they're more easily digested  I'm finding it to quartz  You know what I watch?  I watch Chopped on the Food Network 
[02:45:00]  The guys that open up the best  You are bored  On the plane  On JetBlue  I get that  And I get the speed channel  And I get the  And I saw Pat Sajak was drunk  Yeah yeah  We saw that one  We love Pat Sajak  We've hit that one today already  There she is  It's Rock Lady  That's the Rock Lady  Guess I'll listen to what  And they're trying to tell her  And they're trying to tell her not to  Oh that's part two  That's when they confront her  They do a little intervention  That's part two  The passing of the rock  Yeah  Oh how  That's gotta hurt  We want just the one clip  Where they just talk  They just talk about her addiction  She eats rocks 
[02:45:30]  There she goes  I actually like how it feels  On my teeth  When I'm crunching them on  I think you need help for this  I think it's hurting you  She still has teeth  Yeah that's like  I don't think there's anything  That would make me stop  She should have like  Great white teeth  Yeah  Do you think  I mean this is just someone  Just trying to get on TV  And be like  That's what I think too  Is this just a marketing hook  To be like  You know what  I really want to be on TV  I don't really have it  In any other way  Like hey you know  If I eat rocks  I could probably do that  I bet I could get on TV  If I eat rocks 
[02:46:00]  Yeah that's what we're wondering  Alright here's her back story  I live in Bedford, Virginia  Pretty day today  And I'm addicted to eating rocks  I'm addicted to eating rocks  The doctor says I have kidney stones  And they were delicious  I don't think I would be able  To function every day  If I didn't eat some quantity of rock  I didn't know rocks were fattening  By the way  Yeah right  Teresa has been addicted  To eating rocks  For more than 20 years  You would think  She was initially  Deep frying those rocks  No  She shoots a gravel driveway 
[02:46:30]  Rocks tempura  I had no attention  Of biting into it  Or chewing it  But I did  And once I did that  I was hooked on them  My whole world  Now Teresa can't go  More than a few hours  Without eating rocks  Her teeth look normal man  There's no way  You don't destroy your teeth  I don't get it  And the earthy taste  Earthy taste  I actually like how it feels  On my teeth  When I'm crunching them up  Yeah  When I'm crunching them up  I'm very worried about Teresa  Are you?  When your body can't handle  What you're putting inside of it  It's going to rebellece 
[02:47:00]  Are those rocks just in a prescription bottle  And then like  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah  She carries them around  Just a mixture of rock  A prescription of rocks  She gets them from Canada  Over the internet  She uses a hammer  To break them up  Hammer to break them down  And then puts them in her pillow  This is about the size I like it  Because it's not as hard to swallow  Oh, okay  I would normally take a piece like this  Yeah  And normally just put it in my mouth  Yeah, normally put it in her mouth, right?  Normally put it in your mouth  Use a fork, you animal  Yeah  Oh, man  And get the earthy taste off of it 
[02:47:30]  Earthy taste  It's dirt  Yeah, earthy taste is dirt on a rock  Isn't the whole thing earthy?  Yeah  Yeah, the whole rock is earthy  She's two pounds of rock  Her dumps have got to be horrible  I wonder if like a cement truck  She has a rotating hog around her ass  And it just like pours it out  When she's done shitting some Mexican diet  Sandblast her toilet  I just to hose it off  Hose her ass off  It does like bring me down  It makes me feel more calm 
[02:48:00]  When my mom  Con rock spray painted on her ass  It's kind of like she goes to la la land  He kind of looks like he eats rocks too  Yeah, yeah, yeah  They go right to his head  Apparently she ate it during pregnancy  To reach the rocks  She birthed to a rock head  Water  It's going to be really hard to go back to my real job  In about an hour after  I'm sorry  Yeah, yeah  I don't doubt that  And it's really good pieces for crushing up  She's on the side of the road  Other people have told me to worry about  Her hands in me  Sticking for rocks  And things like that 
[02:48:30]  Or oil leaks  Or anything that might get on the rocks  But I don't care to wash them  You've got to wash your rocks  Before you eat them  Everyone knows that  And you've got to wait 20 minutes there  Before you go swimming  You're going to sink like a run  I have a huge hugging experience  Just snacking  Extra pieces lodged in my throat  And it scared me  I've had a lot of stomach pain  I'm actually really upset  That I'm watching this right now  Because you know I'm going to be tuning in  And watching the other morons on this show  Like one more thing 
[02:49:00]  I don't need to see  Like it's just wasted space  This one seems more legit though  Like this is really going on  What?  Is it the music that's selling it to you?  Yes  I think TLC has embraced the freak show  Yeah  They know how to do this  Yeah, they definitely have  Yeah  They love finding these people  Her friends, her family  Everyone  Bag of rocks  Dumb as a  And I don't think there's anything  That will make me stop  Yeah  Alright  Enough  Yeah  Rock eating lady  Oh god  That's got to be real  Yeah, I think that one's 
[02:49:30]  You know, got some authenticity to it  There's so many of these freak show  Reality shows on though  That I just  I like watching  That Toddlers and Tiaras  Is hilarious  Because  I can't do it  I know you guys tweet about it  All the time  Oh yeah  The mothers are psychopaths  Yeah  They are so  It's not even living vicariously  Through the child  It's  It's child enslavement  And  When you got a kid  In booty shorts  And a halter top  And the mother is going  Come on 
[02:50:00]  Shake it  Shake it  It's  It's  I'm dumbfounded  Yeah  By how these parents  And you're playing to the pedos  Aren't arrested  You're playing to the pedos out there  Yeah  Oh yeah  You know that's  Like that's the demo of the show  Is every bastard in the country  Is watching  You look at the crowd  And sometimes I just see some man  Sitting there  Watching  In the audience  In the audience  What do you think he's about  Why aren't they chasing him out of the place  They all have those rose colored tinted glasses  And chubby faces  Yeah  Yeah  Panel vans 
[02:50:30]  Living in their mother's basement  But I've been  I've been watching this  And getting  Very critical  Of some of the mothers  That put their children in  Because  Some of these kids are fucking fat and ugly  They're fat ugly children  That do not belong  In a beauty contest  But every mother thinks  Their kid is the most gorgeous kid  Put on your booty shorts  I put out something on Twitter  About it  And like literally  I thought it was one of those  Like we were talking earlier  Where I was like  Ah that's pretty funny  Like a lot of people were like  Well fuck you  That's bullshit  Like you know  There are people that are really into this crap  And they think it's like good for their kid  It's like  Ah man I don't know 
[02:51:00]  It can't be good for your kid  And no one goes to these things  It's all just the parents  The audience is the parents  The parents that's it  And an errant pedo  That comes walking into the days in conference room  That they hold these in  A lot of empty seats  Yeah  A lot of empty seats  Oh god  They gussy them up  They gussy them up  In their little outfits  But how do they know  They're not damaging  How do you not know  You're scarring  It's gotta be damaging  These children  They're yelling at them  Look at all the empty seats  That's packed  Yeah  Forcing them nuts  It's like a wizard's game 
[02:51:30]  Yeah  They yell at the kids  Like yeah you didn't do good  You forgot to turn  You forgot your turn  It's like yeah  The kid just goes  And then they do these interviews  Where it's like  Oh she loves doing pageants  It's her whole life  The kids are crying  The kids are crying  I want to go home  I just want to play with Barbara  She beats me when you're not here  Please keep the camera here  She's like lipping  Help me  Help me  She's blinking SOS  Like a hostage  I like  I also love when the kids face plant 
[02:52:00]  When they take headers  They're walking up the stairs to the stage  And they face plant  Because you know the crying is right after that  And it's just hilarious  Hilarious to watch  The best is just watching the moms though  Because you know  They're just trying to live vicariously  Because they had no chance of ever being  Any kind of beauty queen  Because they're all way overweight  They're all fat  Yeah they're all fat and ugly  And they just are trying to get  Some kind of beauty through their kids  You just see them yelling at their kids  Listen I'm fat and I missed out on my dreams  I'm living for you you little bitch  Now get out there and shake your ass 
[02:52:30]  And let the child be the star  Not the parent  When are they going to do the one about dads and sports?  Like  Now you're talking  I mean that's  If I'm a marketing guy  You know there's  By the way  There's an equivalent amount of dads  That are like  The hockey dad that always gets in a fight  And the kid's not going to be  You know  Hockey dads  Little league dads  Hockey dads  Who was the guy  His father and his son  Like  I think  Beat the shit out of  Beat the shit out of the umpire  At a White Sox game  Didn't they come out of this  Out of this dance  I thought there was a dad  That actually beat up  Like one of the kids 
[02:53:00]  On his own kids team  Or something like that  It's like  Because his kid couldn't do it  So it was like  That's beyond getting carried away  You have a mental problem  You have a mental problem  Alright great  Santini  Unbelievable  Oh another thing  I noticed last night  I guess Kim Kardashian  She's got her own  Fucking reality show  She tweeted  Just heard  Cher is dead  Can somebody tell me  If this is true  Can't you google  Now think about this 
[02:53:30]  She then tweets  Hours later  Oh my god  Cher is alive  Why do people  Put stuff like this  On Twitter  She has 12 million followers  That no one would have known anything  Right  If she didn't tweet  Oh my god  I heard Cher is dead  I don't think anyone else tweeted that  This idiot  Yeah  Because all you have to do  Is put Cher  By the way  If I was her  I would take that platform  And use it just to fuck with people  All day long  I'd throw stuff out there 
[02:54:00]  All the time  Like hey just heard  And just get it  John Travolta  Terrible  Terrible  Terrible  What  What  Oh  Sorry  Rumor  She's got the power  Of 12 million people  That can retweet something  And get a rumor running  And she's mad  Like  Oh I can't believe  Somebody said that  You tweeted it  Dummy  What an idiot  That was up there  When  Once her face got off  With killing her kid  And  Oh right  When she was like  I can't believe  I was like  Really  I thought your dad  Could have helped OJ  Do the same thing  Yeah  She was 
[02:54:30]  Come on now  She was flabbergasted  That a murderer  Could get off  Could get off the hook  Wow  Your father was Robert Kardashian  Yeah  And there was a hell of a lot  More evidence in the OJ trial  Than there was in the  Casey Anthony trial  If you ask me  I'm obsessed with Kim Kardashian  And her fame  I don't  I just don't understand  It's amazing  I don't understand it  It just happens  And I'll openly admit  I'm obsessed by it  What obsesses you?  The fact she gets away with it?  She's got 13 million  Fucking followers  She's bloody rich 
[02:55:00]  Yeah  She does a reality show  That all they do  Is sit around  And look at their phones  There's like  Not even  Nothing's even going on  Is it more a statement  About her or about us?  Do something  I don't know  I'm a little bit more  Concerned about our country  Than we allow people  To get like that  Right  And she's not even  The hottest girl out there  What's the matter  You don't like  You don't like  When the sister talks  And sits and talks  About things that are  Happening in her life  Because they're so interesting  Oh and the  I just want to choke  Say it  Say it  She's so fucking  Him and that guy 
[02:55:30]  Lawrence O'Donnell  On MSNBC  He just drags everything out  I'm going to talk slow  Because this is very important  Well Lawrence O'Donnell  His icy eyes  Scare the fuck out of me  What does he have?  He's a little waxy  He's got a little waxy  He's got something buried  Somewhere in there  Shallow gravy kind of thing  Those eyes are really creepy on him  Really fucking creepy  I love Reverend Al myself  He's just  Oh god  He's got a new commercial  Or new promo  From MSNBC  He's moving on  From the blueberry pie  They the one  To eat the pie  With the blueberry pie  In their face 
[02:56:00]  The GOP now  Like the blueberry pie  They got the blueberry pie  In their face  Now I believe  The independents  Are more like a burrito  And don't ask me  What the democrats are  They is like  Creme brulee  Don't be stingy  With the mustard  I can't even deal with that  I don't know why  He's got a gig  I would love to know  How you get a guy  With the controversy  He's been through  Over the years  As far as race baiting goes  And have him  Represent your channel  Give him a talk show 
[02:56:30]  It's all about  Just getting  Putting something sensational  Out there  Like how long  Is it going to be  Until Anthony Weiner  Gets a TV spot  He'll be out there  Because people know  It doesn't have to be good anymore  You just have to be out there  Which is kind of ridiculous  They get Spitzer a shot  You know that failed miserably  But it's a game of shot  Here's the blueberry pie commercial  We love this fucking thing  On this show  Remember now  I grew up here in Brooklyn  And we used to come home from school  My mother and some of the ladies  In the neighborhood  Would make blueberry pie  And we would rush in 
[02:57:00]  Knowing our mothers  Were still working  And I would eat 20 of them  My friends would get mad  Did y'all eat the pie?  No  And blueberry would be  All over our face  That's what happens  When I look at the GOP  They talk about  The economy's bad  And we didn't do it  We were the ones fighting  But they got the blueberry pie  All over their face  They were the ones  Eating the pie  They were the ones  That eat the pie  Oh I get it  They're lying  They're saying  We didn't do it  But they got blueberry pie  On their face  Right Reverend Al  Jesus  He also lost all the way  He looks like Jonah Hill 
[02:57:30]  He lost all the way  Some guys are just meant to be fat  Right  Yeah  It's like too much skin  And women too  Once you get to a certain level  I only know one guy  He was like 360 pounds  He's now 180  And you would never know  That he was a former  Really fat guy  Right  Most of the time  When they lose it  You always see the excess  You know he was  He did a good job  Getting it off  But it's hard  What do you think  Of the burrito mayor?  Oh the Connecticut guy?  Yeah  They sent like 500 tacos  Oh my god  They've been sending  Mexican food to them  It was tacos?  Yeah it was tacos 
[02:58:00]  All day  If you're going to piss off  A group of people  Don't piss off like a lot of  Pick a small country  Yeah  Where they can't get here  I'm thinking like Eskimos  Yeah  It's a smaller demo  The Amish maybe  Yeah the Amish  Because they're not  Going to hear it anyway  His police force  I guess his police force  Was rousting  Some Hispanic people  Yeah  And a couple of them  Got in pretty big trouble  And the mayor said  He's standing behind his cops  He goes  You know  What do you want from me?  I guess I'll eat some tacos  Yeah  And whoopsie  Probably not the best thing to say  So they started sending him 
[02:58:30]  Tacos and burritos  And beans and rice  Here's a clip  I didn't really  I didn't really see  Much of a problem here  Did you?  We turn things into  Much bigger problems now  Especially on a slow news day  That may or may not  Have meant something else  Right  But let's just interpret it  That it did mean something horrid  Because nothing else  Is going on in this world  Right  Very slow today  We have to do something  This is where the  Alleged racial profiling  Took place  And it is while Latinos here  Walk toward the camera  I love the walk toward the camera 
[02:59:00]  It was a surprise to them  That four cops got arrested  One business owner told me  It's the beltless trench coat  It's called the executive  I used to sell those  This is the winter Columbo look  It's the fact that  In a town  That is 10% Latino  There is only  One police officer  That speaks Spanish  Bad lighting and cheap fabric  That's how you move merchandise  Looks like RDTV  I love that one  There it is  Segment of Latinos in town  We have a very small segment  Of a lot of nationalities 
[02:59:30]  In our community  But obviously with such tension  In the Latino community  With a force of 50 officers  Still no police officer  Of Latino ancestry  And your point being  The mayor didn't get it  Just look at this exchange  What are you doing  For the Latino community today  I might have tacos  When I go home  I'm not quite sure yet  Why is that bad?  But that's just like  A baited question also  It's like come on  No matter what you say  It's like well  I'm not doing anything  Oh you're not  Yeah the guy was being douchey 
[03:00:00]  So is she delivery too  It seemed like he gave a douchey answer  On purpose almost too  Yeah  Yeah it's just like  This is a stupid question  Not even worth my time  Like get the hell out of here  Right  But that's the problem  I mean you can't say anything anymore  Without them being  You know we've gotten to a point  Where you can't be a politician  And actually say what you're thinking  Because someone's going to get offended  And God forbid  It's so  Like everyone's so sensitive now  It's ridiculous  Yeah but everyone's got a platform  I mean when you send out a tweet  Or something  Or a tweet or something  That nobody likes  You get  I'm being heckled electronically  For an Aretha Franklin joke 
[03:00:30]  Two days ago  I'll say something  That has nothing to do with racism  They're like oh you're racist  It's like no no I'm not racist  I hate everyone equally  Right  Like I just fucking hate everyone  Like that's  Is that so much easier  Like it's my platform  I want to hear  Adam's Aretha Franklin joke  It was a tweet  I said Aretha Franklin called off her wedding  I said don't worry  There's plenty more fried fish in the sea  That's good  What's wrong with that  Nothing wrong with that  Oh I get it  It's because she's black  I go no she's fat  That's all  It's a stupid joke  I see fat before black  Yeah me too 
[03:01:00]  Please  You can't even make fat jokes now  There's a whole segment of people  That's almost the worst one  It's easier to do a racial thing  Than it is a fat one  Because everyone knows they're fat  And they get really offended  Well it's a disease  Everything's a disease  Laziness is a disease too  And then they're like I did it  Until they lose weight  And then they're all about  Not being fat  But while they're fat  They talk about how  They should have equal rights  Which I don't understand  You have the right  You're a person  You have a right  You don't need more rights 
[03:01:30]  Because you're fat  And then they talk about  How beautiful it is  Which you know  Eye of the beholder  Whatever  But then  When they lose weight  All of a sudden  Oh this is always where  I've wanted to be  I could walk  I don't get winded  People come up to me now  5% of the people  Really have a problem  That is something  They can't necessarily  Do anything about  The other 95  Not so much  We've all seen them  In the restaurants  I love the studies  In the paper  When they're like  New study comes out  Diet and exercise  Prove losing weight  It's like really?  Wow  Diet and exercise 
[03:02:00]  This rest report  Rocks are bad to eat  Yes  Believe me  Diet and exercise sucks  I'd love to just  Move down donuts  And not move  But you know  You gotta  What are you gonna do  Are you gonna be fat?  Thank you  And unhealthy  I'm really spreading  Some new news here  Look  Paula Deen got it  For a reason  That killed me  That frigged  The donuts  And the donuts  The fried egg  And a hamburger  And she kept it quiet  For two years  Yeah and I did  I did her show 
[03:02:30]  A while ago  She's a great lady  Actually  But they would say  Hey come on  Do the show  I was like  Okay it's fine  We made a fried cannoli  Like I was like  Okay  That's what I did  It was like  They did like a New York thing  So it's like a  Take on it  Like a southern New York thing  So I took a cannoli  And deep fried it  I was like  Holy Jesus  That can't be good  That can't be  No  It can't be good  For you at least  You should serve it  With a rib spreader  Because you're gonna need  Yeah  Here's your EKG machine  And paddles  Jesus Christ  Yeah 
[03:03:00]  What are the plans  For the weekend  If you don't do anything  You can go to  Bananas and Hasbrokites  It will be there  Tonight and tomorrow night  Two shows tomorrow  One show tonight  Nine  Two tomorrow  I think  730  That's Jersey  It's Jersey  Right over the bridge  It's easy  I know  I know  You're not going  Zero kids  I'm sorry  I'm sick of Wester myself  I know  You go back into the bunker  I'm sorry I missed the poker game  I got a text from Joe Buck  Yeah that was a good one  Although they fucked up my  They fucked up my shit pump  Downstairs  Well I got that toilet down there 
[03:03:30]  And then downstairs  And of course because of gravity  Sure  You need that big pump thing  That pumps all the waste  Into the waste pipes  And I guess after having  20 guys over  Eating pizza and whatnot  Playing poker for hours on end  It might have gotten  A little overwhelmed  And one of the couplings  Kind of came loose  Well we weren't sure  If it was the pump or not  So Keith the cop  Who you know  My PA really  He went down to check it out  He unbolted the top of the pump  And he looks and goes 
[03:04:00]  It's only you know  A quarter full  So the pump has to be working  He goes I think it's just  Where that coupling came off  Where that crap is leaking  Out of the pipe  On your floor  I think it's there  I think it's a stink puddle  In my fucking house  In the mechanical room by the way  So it wafted through  Every part of the house  Yeah  So Keith  Not thinking  That split second  Grabs the float valve  In the tank  And clicks it up  And got a spray of shit  All over him  Nice  All over him  Ah 
[03:04:30]  Yeah  You always see that in movies  You say it's not really  Ever going to happen  And it's great to see that  It doesn't actually happen  But it did  It did happen  But yeah  That was a byproduct  Of the poker game  I'm going to have to  Divvy up the bathrooms  Next time  And tell some people  I've got to go upstairs  Or just get a trough  Put it outside  Just put it outside  Make it shit outside  We're starting to make  A compost pile  Yeah  Why not  Yeah that was a little much  Southern fried chicken  On the food network  What are they doing  They're cooking up  Some southern fried chicken  They say 
[03:05:00]  I just read a study  That fried food's  Not bad for you  As long as it's  The type of oil you use  Isn't that bad kind  You've got to use  Like sunflower oil  Castrol  Or something like that  Yeah yeah  But they say  Any fried food  Isn't bad for you  As long as it's  Made in  That good oil  And it tastes the same  Right  When you do it  With the good oil  I don't even  Really eat fried food  Anymore  I can't  I can't eat  I can't eat  No  No  It's just  That's my weakness  I work out hard  And stuff like that  But I can't  I have a hard time  I do have a hard time  Controlling  I really love food  I want to eat 
[03:05:30]  What I want to eat  I do have my moments  And when I go out  I'm not like looking  Like a vegan  Or something like that  But at home  I like to keep it  You know  Pretty basic  Yeah  In between beers  Stuffing  Oh believe me  Because that's my  That's my vice  Oh do I love Guinness  And I'll keep them  Oh do I love  A liquid steak  Yes  It's wonderful  I had my kids  Chicken fingers last night  God  Damn  Good  It's so good  I haven't had chicken fingers  In years  I always order off the kids menu  When I'm with them 
[03:06:00]  Really  That's the best part of having kids  Is that you can actually  Order off the kids menu  And be like  You're at some fancy place  It's like I'll have the grilled cheese  Oh yeah it's for him  Yeah  Mr. Trump  I'd like to tell you about  Our specials are the tilapia  The veal oscar  No I'm going to have these  Sammy the sea serpent  With tater tots  Yeah  It's for him I promise  Two of them  Is there anything better  Than tater tots  Tater tots  Yeah  That should be a side  In most restaurants  What about McDonald's hash browns  It's sort of a flat tater tot  I think it's a little bit  Yeah that is a flat tater tot  That's all it is  I think it's better  Nice and greasy  It's more crispy  You don't have the soft inside 
[03:06:30]  It's all crispy  Yeah it's all crispy  Look what Sam just did to me  He knows I love Popeye's  You like Popeye's?  I just don't go there often  Well no  You should  I gotta get my bucket on  We used to get  We used to get Jack's Tacos  Oh man  The Jack's  The big ones  Where the grease  Just comes right through  The taco shell  Yeah the taco shell  And the paper  And everything else  It's in the water  You weren't able to see  Through a taco shell  By the time you got it  Out of the wrapper  You could see all the meat  And the  All the goodness  Whatever that was  It's like eating the hull  Of the Exxon Valdez  It's like eating the hull 
[03:07:00]  Of the Exxon Valdez  I don't know what it was  About going through  The drive through  At McDonald's  Jack in the box  At four in the morning  After a night of drinking  Exit 37 off the LAE  Yeah believe me  Why you would eat a few bites  And then have just this  You were compelled to throw it  At the window  Of the Jack in the box  And you knew  Some poor bastard  At four in the morning  Does not want to clean  That window up  But you're always like  Dude check this out  Wow  Speed away as you watch it  Slowly go down the window 
[03:07:30]  The only thing better than that  Was going to school in Philly  Because you had  Pat steaks and stuff like that  And Gino's  Probably made a huge mess  There's so many times  I don't even remember  Being down there  But it was like  You'd have like the remnants  On your shirt  Be like  Ah dude we did the four o'clock  What did I eat  Fucking cheesesteaks  That's my downfall  Being married to someone  From Philly  You can't  Ninth and Wartman  You can't not go  To Pat's  Like when you're over there  When we go down  We get cheesesteaks  And on the way back  And on the way back  So guaranteed two  Every visit  And you cannot  Get into your car 
[03:08:00]  The next morning  If you went to White Castle  And not smell that  The farts  That smell  And the hamburgers  Yeah yeah  Instant farts though  You bring them into your car  And then leave the car  It could be five minutes  That smell is in there  For a week  It's like a burger air freshener  Just stay  Hang it from your rear view  You can smoke a cigar in there  Even the cigar smoke says  I'm out  It doesn't matter  I can't get any  And the White Castle  It's their dumb onions  I don't like onions  But wherever they're getting them from  That's what makes their burgers so good  But what were you going to do  Go in there and order them without onions 
[03:08:30]  And wait for an hour  That's not a request you can make  It's way too complicated  How about you leave those out  They don't speak English  They just point  But the point being  Yes I like their onions  But in general I don't like onions  So I don't get it  They're magic onions  They're magic onions  They really are  With the pickles  It's a perfect combination  They're dried  They're dried and they sprinkle them on  You had your choice  When you were drunk on Long Island  It was either White Castle  Or the all night diner  With fries and gravy and chins  They call them disco fries in Jersey 
[03:09:00]  Disco fries  What's that about?  Why disco fries?  I don't know  What does that even mean?  Long Island we just said  Put some gravy on our fries  Yeah fries and gravy  Fries and gravy  Yeah  Cheese and gravy  The diner was always a  Very odd place at that hour  Because there were factions  That would come in  Different factions  The sharks and the jets  Of drunk guys  At tables  That for some reason  Had to pull their dicks out  And no reason whatsoever  Had to pull their dicks out  Might have happened at the Huntington Diner  A couple times  Always a problem  After an officer  After a fast Eddie's run 
[03:09:30]  It might have happened  It might have happened  I may or may not have known  If you people have done that  Yeah yeah yeah  Where we're getting kicked out  Because maybe somebody  Was pulling their dick out  If you got enough people  At your table  You will start throwing food  At another table  Full of guys  And make some shit  Start some shit  I felt bad for those people  That had to work those hours  Holy fuck  No wonder they're  They're on crystal meth  And join  Yes  No wonder  They deal with us  Us drunk assholes  It was either that 
[03:10:00]  Throwing food  And then crying girls  And then fighting  And then girls  Throwing up in the back  They got rid of the Huntington Diner too  Man  I used to love that place  Still got Dick Hill's Diner  That's across from  Fred's Diner over there  Fred's Diner  Is Fred still there?  I don't know  Who's Fred's Diner?  Fred's Diner was on Jericho  Jericho Turnpike  Oh yeah  I'm talking about it  In the village though  I'm not going to  Start driving around  No  You're just home eating  Your child's food  Daddy I'm hungry  Shut up  Chicken fingers  God damn  Good stuff  It's got to be 
[03:10:30]  The children's though  I'm eating like Sam  All of a sudden  It's the best  Sam eats like a child  Don't  There's nothing wrong with  Listen  No  The only reason  Most people don't do it  Is because they're just  Embarrassed to order that way  You know  But like  Like I said  That's the best part  Of having kids  Is like I can get away  With being like  Yeah I'll have the chicken fingers  It's perfect  You think there's something  Nothing wrong with that right?  He doesn't like steak  Now talk about it  No that's a different story  He doesn't like steak  He doesn't like sushi  He doesn't like vegetables  Oh that's different  I enjoy chicken fingers  Every once in a while  But like I gotta eat 
[03:11:00]  The other stuff  I can't only eat like a kid  He pretty much eats  Five things  What?  Chicken fingers  Rocks  Pizza  Rocks  Rocks  Toilet tissue  Toilet tissue  Toilet tissue  Toilet tissue  Phone padding  Phone padding  No but really  What else?  Blueberry pie  Chicken fingers  Oh any white meat chicken  Pizza  Only white meat chicken?  Yeah I don't really like dark meat  I don't like dark meat either  Really?  See I like the dark meat better  My brother makes believe  He likes the dark turkey meat  Every Thanksgiving 
[03:11:30]  I'm like shut up  Stop being different  I won't eat the white meat  At turkey  If there's like a  You like dark meat?  I'll eat the dark meat  Every time  You know what?  Then I apologize  Maybe my brother's on to something  I don't like so much  The leg meat  I like like the fatty stuff  Underneath  Oh wow  That's a weird place  That's the weird place  No one goes  You should be fat I'm thinking  I work out a lot  You know what I mean  I work out  Pizza's in good shape  I eat a lot  If you miss one day  Of working out  You're just gonna blow up  Like Veruca  From Willy Wonka  But he doesn't  Nothing  That's it right? 
[03:12:00]  On a weekly basis  It's pizza  Or some kind of chicken  I could live on pizza  Every day  I love all of us  It's amazing  Because it's not really  Great food for you  You're very skinny  So it's  Oh yeah  But he's under 30  That'll go in about  A couple years  30 is when you realize  You can't just eat anything  I'm 34  I'm noticing  I can't get away  With what I used to  And not be like  One bad week in Mexico  Or something  And it's like  30 was the age  Just go back to Indy  You'll lose all the way  You want  Yeah exactly  No those are perfect trips  36 hours 
[03:12:30]  I won't eat anything  Are you cleansing?  Nah I gotta do business  In Mumbai  You at least have  Private jets for that right?  No  For me  If I'm not traveling  With my father  I travel commercial  I fly coach even  Because I can't  There's a part of my brain  That I can't  I'd rather give the  Excess to charity  Or something like that  But if I'm going to LA  It's a five hour flight  The first class ticket  Is like five to eight grand  Or I can sit in the back  For like seven hundred bucks  I'm like no brainer  I can't  But what about  The big comfy seats  Honestly  For me  It's like  I'm going to 
[03:13:00]  Read or watch a movie  I don't need  There's so many distractions  You don't realize  That you're flying  Through the air  At five hundred miles an hour  Only half of it  I'm a licensed pilot  So flying doesn't bother me  Alright help us out  Only half of it's on the plane  Help us out  Why are we all scared of flying  And how do we get around that  Death  Honestly  Listen I've never been afraid of flying  And I used to jump off mounds  With parachutes and stuff like that  So I'm like  On the extreme end of like stupid  That's why I've broken  Every major bone in my body  But honestly  Go up in like a small plane  I think  You go up and take like a lesson  You know  Like you're learning to fly 
[03:13:30]  Doesn't help  You get the controls  You try to do it  Like you go through some bumpy shit  And then you realize  Those big planes  If you look  Find it  Like they'll stretch the wings  Forty feet  It's impossible to break those things  What they do to test those things  Is amazing  You will see the wings  Of a 747 flapping  Yeah they almost like  Make them touch  At the top  It's amazing  Without snapping  And it's very rare  That no matter how bad  The turbulence is  That a plane will go down  Due to turbulence  It's very rare  People will get hurt  Because they're not buckled in  And shit like that  How many planes really go down a year 
[03:14:00]  When you think about  How many people  And how many are in the air  At any given time  I mean there's thousands  In the air at any given time  Right  And like  Yeah  You can go on one of the sites  And they'll show you  Like every flight  That's in  I mean there's thousands  Of planes  And like  You hear like  One or two a year  Well statistically  You're more likely  To die in a car accident  I think they actually say  More people are hit by lightning  Than die in plane crisis a year  How many times a year  Do you fly?  I don't fly as much anymore  Just because of the time  I mean it's one of those things  That I  You know when I got my pilots  Ten years ago  I really enjoyed it  I did a lot  But like  You start having kids 
[03:14:30]  You read about like  All these like  Dentist turned pilot  Like  You know it's not  Something you want to do  As a journeyman  John Denver making his own plane  You just don't want to do it  Like part time  Because if something goes wrong  Like you know  Listen I could get a plane right now  And 99.99% of the time  I'd be fine  But if something goes wrong  And I just wasn't as in tune with it  Because I haven't been doing it as much  It's not really worth it  Yeah it's got to become  An extension of yourself  Yeah so I mean  Those are the ones you guys  You hear about Rex  It's like the guy that flies  Who flies once a month  And he's had a plane  And they're like  He's been a pilot for 20 years  But he's got 200 hours  It's like  I don't know  But as soon as one of those instruments  Looked a little funny  I'd start screaming 
[03:15:00]  But you have to sit there  And relax  And go okay  Alright  What that means is this  I got a just here  Fuck that  It's stalled  Well start it again  Your own senses  Will fuck you  Before the instruments  Absolutely  The instruments  That's exactly the right way  What do you mean  Stall and try starting  Well they teach you to do that  I mean they blindfold you  When you're doing  Getting your license  And they do all sorts  Of weird stuff  And they tell you to recover  And I swear  You feel like you're upside down  And you're flying  Like straight and level  Wow  So you really have to learn  To trust your instruments  The Kennedy kid was upside down  And didn't know it 
[03:15:30]  Yeah they say  Like the top portion  Of his right wing  Is what hit the ground first  Spatial disorientation  So he was upside down  When he hit  So I mean  You've got to learn  To trust your instruments  I understand  Looking out  Sometimes you don't know  If you're upside down  But wouldn't your body  Just tell you you're upside down  No  Your body will tell you  That's the problem  That's why people get an accent  The artificial horizon tells you  You're flying straight and level  Right  And you're going  No I'm not  I'm banked over  Like I can feel it  I'm probably fucking  30 degrees over  And you try to correct it  And now you're 
[03:16:00]  Now you're really  Banked over  That's when you hit a stall  But if you put me  Upside down now  I'm going to know it  Yeah look  If you sneeze  And it hits you  In the forehead  Yeah  Yeah can you spit  Everyone's while  See what's going on  If it's going up or down  Up and sideways  And you're like  I don't know what to do  Wow  Alright  Ah shit  But you guys are all  Afraid of flying  I'm not afraid of  I flew with Joe Buck  When Joe Buck  Was getting his license  We were at Republic Airport  And he's not allowed  To have people in there  So he goes  Alright  And Republic's  Wait by the fuel  Wait by the dumpster 
[03:16:30]  And I'm running in it  Like it's an A-team episode  Like I'm just trying  To make the escape  And we get in this thing  And he's doing  Touch and goes  I was sick by the third one  Let me out  Go by the dumpster  I'm running out  Yeah yeah  What were you doing  Cessnas or  Yeah Cessnas  You know warriors  Any bottom wing  Yeah well the warriors  Are bottom  The low wing  And so  And then you know  I had friends with planes  So I've landed everything  Up to like a King Air  I've done some time  In like the Boeing  And like simulators  And like ice 
[03:17:00]  Those landings  And so yeah  Dump terrorists ruin that  You used to be able  To actually fork out  A few grand  And go to the United complex  And just get in a simulator  Take a fucking lesson  In a simulator  767  And well  They stopped doing that  Put the kibosh on that  Yeah interesting  Five Muslim guys  They want to really learn to fly  That's great  I think we should encourage that  Can we give them a deal  They don't need to know  How to land  Yeah for some reason  No one picked that up  Oh well  Yeah that's  I flew in  The helicopters are fun  They took us in helicopters 
[03:17:30]  To Death Valley  That's a whole other animal  That's a whole different kind  That's fun  You're flying with your feet  I've got a little helicopter time  It's awesome  Yeah  Totally different animal  Yeah yeah  It's just  The oddest thing is  Not having forward speed  When you're going up in the air  Yeah  Especially if you go  From airplanes to helicopters  You're kind of like  What  Why are we going up  The flying part's kind of easy  It's the hovering part  That's difficult  Yeah yeah yeah  Controlling that  Like side to side  And you know  That's where it gets tough  Yeah  I remember the whirlybirds  The one on the arms 
[03:18:00]  Where you'd fly around  And pick up like the  The verdie bird  Remember the verdie birds  The hooks  Yeah it was a game  You had the throttle  And then you had  You're collective  And you're like  Whoa let me go up  I always broke my whirlybird  The spring  Was the universal joint  And it always broke on you  How about you make them  A little more sturdy  Yeah  Because we're going to  Crash this thing a bit  We're going to spin it around  We're never going to be able  To pick up the little  Roadblock thing  And drop it off  To stop the magic  When we were growing up  Those helicopters and stuff  One flight  And it was broken  Because it had to turn  90 degrees  To go up to the rotor 
[03:18:30]  And it was a pen spring  It was like a pen spring  That was bent  So they could use that  And that was the weak link  That always broke  We always broke it  On the first flight  Bastards  We're going to end up  In the middle of 25A  Which is a busy road  Yeah  So our yard was literally  In the highway  And the last flight  There was always a firework  Strapped to the little  You had to  Oh my god  We've had a major malfunction  Rock'n Sock'n Robots  They made cheap too  But the old ones 
[03:19:00]  They didn't  The old ones  Had like forged steel  Inside those things  You could actually  Kick them in  Yeah  Like when you  The old ones came  With Hugh Jackman  From the movie  When you got your  Block knocked off  You took your fist  It just went  Bam  And smashed his head  Back down  You know  And  But the ones now  Are so feeble  And  Because they still  Make them by the way  Yeah  And they're so like  Frail  Well that game  Was fun for about an hour  Rock'em sock'em robot  You know what was fun  For a while  Remember Spirograph  And we learned  No you learned  How to sharpen  The edge of them 
[03:19:30]  And then they  Turned into  Ninja throwing stars  They should do  The weird shapes  Yeah  You could sharpen them  Up on a wheel  And just throw them  And stick them  In your brother's back  We've talked about  All the toys we grew up with  And how we changed  The game  To make it way more exciting  Growing up with Anthony  You don't need toys  Just leave shit around  And you come back  And it's different  Improvise toys  I'd just take stuff apart  And put it back together  Sideways  And be like  Yeah check this out  And Adam's like  Wasn't that my lawnmower  Yeah  I had that back  We don't have it anymore  It's an assault vehicle 
[03:20:00]  Remember when you made  The light board  Out of  The band had a gig  And you made a light board  Out of an Atari  Yeah we needed the switches  Yeah so you took  The whole Atari board  Four switches  On the old Atari  With the cartridges  So the band's lights  Would work  That was the band's lights  That's before we found out  About resistors  And the thing caught on fire  And almost burnt my hands  Good show  I remember that one  Yeah  Then there was  Barbecuing with tools  Because we didn't have  Barbecue equipment  So it was  Needlenose pliers  Vice grips  We all had our own  Like we'd play the 
[03:20:30]  Paintball  And come back with  Giant London broil  And all throw them  On the barbecue  At the same time  And we're just  Standing around  Drinking beer  With needle nose pliers  And fucking vice grips  Flipping them  In camouflage  Yeah in camouflage  With tools  Because we were  Ridiculous  Not even too poor  We just spent money  On bad things  Rent or slot cars  Hmm  Slot cars  You know I could always  Duck behind the window  When the landlord  Get in the hole  Of the wall  When the landlord  Comes  Landlord would show up  And just pound on the door  Anthony I know 
[03:21:00]  You motherfuckers  Are in there  Open the door  And we'd see him  Storm off  And we'd peel out  And we're like  Alright set the cars  Come on out  We would hide  Like Anne Frank  Just right in the walls  Yeah  Sometimes he'd come in  And wouldn't see us  I wound up seeing him  Years later  After I was a fairly  Successful radio guy  Good for you  Did he pay him back  Finally  No  The nice thing is  Nothing's really changed  Like even when I go  Over to the house  Like when you guys  Had that hiatus  When you were living  In Brooklyn  I went over to the house 
[03:21:30]  Oh you call it a hiatus  Do you  Yeah I'm trying to be nice  Firing if you remember  Beer cans all over the place  And he's building a helicopter  I'm like yeah  What are you doing  Radio control helicopters  That's what I'm into  Right now Adam  Yeah  That was fun  The six month phase  Oh yeah  And then it's like  Get the phase  And I'm like  Yeah okay  We had time for a few phases  We had to sit out  Two years  And three months  I remember being on the road  In Vegas  And seeing the White House  I saw the White House  And Opie and Anthony  On the crawl  And went  Oh what the fuck 
[03:22:00]  Did they do now  Yeah that's probably not good  Yeah  That's not a good one  We've been good boys  Yeah  We're due  We're overdue  Like one of those volcanoes  We gotta erupt  We gotta do something  Please  Gotta fuck this shit up  A little bit  No  I'm good  I hate that  Adam let's get you out of here  Let's get everyone out of here  It's weekend time  Weekend time  It's Adam Farrarar on Twitter  F-E-R-R-A-R-A  With that Aretha Franklin joke  My god you should have more followers now  Yeah well it's funny  I got some good followers  And a lot of hate mail  And a lot of hate mail

[03:26:00]  I don't know if we've  Chronicled this properly  On the show  But  You know  He bleached his hair  Completely  And then like  Recently  He got a haircut  And he just cut it down  So that the  The sides  Are super short  And it's a little  Longer on top  Which is a  I guess a fine haircut  But the thing is  That now  The rest of his hair  Is dark  And it looks like  He just has  Severely frosted tips  And now he's like  In a meeting 
[03:26:30]  Talking about programming  And he's just this guy  Outside in a hoodie  And frosted tips  He's got like  An in sync  Backstreet Boys  Hairstyle going on  Yeah  And he looks like  Retarded  He was in one of those  Bands like  Fifteen years ago  Before he gained  A little weight  And like  He didn't realize  Uh oh  Opie  We were just commenting  I know you're  Uncomfortable with  A lot of attention  E-Rock looks ridiculous  Having those meetings 
[03:27:00]  Out there  Watching him  He can't walk around  Here with that hairstyle  Yeah he's gotta  Shave it down  Maybe Monday  I hope so  I mean like  Mar's a little jealous  Mar's jealous  I'm in here today  What's Mar's jealous of  He noticed a friendship  Happening right in front  Of his eyes  Between you and Cross  No  Oh man  What the hell's wrong  Ah shit I was hoping  I was like yes  What the hell is wrong with you  We bridged a gap  No it wasn't  It wasn't you and Rob Cross  I ain't no hipster  Oh  You can't  Rob Cross is in that  Hipster world isn't he  You got a little bit  Of a hipster beard going 
[03:27:30]  I do have that  But that makes it  Non-hipster  Cause I'm not trying  To be hipster  Hipsters are officially  Trying to be hipsters  Although they would say  Differently  Exactly  Which is what you're doing  What  You're saying differently  But we both know  I'm not trying to be hipster  You got your hipster  YouTube channel  I am a hipster  For not trying to be hipster  So you're a bit of a hipster  But Mar's very jealous  Because as we all know  He's been trying to become  Friends with me for a long time  Wait wait wait wait  A lot of people think  Long time  They think  Four five six months  Two weeks 
[03:28:00]  Is how long  He's been trying to be  Friends with you  Seven years  Seven years  I've only noticed  I've only noticed  The last two weeks  He's been trying to be my friend  Do you have any idea  Are you serious  You've been trying to be my friend  For seven years  Seven years  I only noticed  Like two weeks ago  Opie  When we started  I don't want to waste a time  When you and I started  Hanging out  Like just started  Like I went to your house  Like the first time  I went to your house  Yeah  It was  Hey Mars  Guess where I was  Over the weekend  Who  Oh I was hanging out  With a friend of mine  Who  Who  Who were you hanging out with  What  Opie 
[03:28:30]  No  You  You got to go to his  You went to his house  He wants your phone number  This is why  It hurt him so bad  When he didn't  He got a last minute  Wedding invite from you  He wasn't on the initial list  And you gave it to him  Like a week before  And he was very hurt  Because he wants to be your friend  I gave it to him a week before  Because you know  People dropped out  And you gotta fill those seats  Right  Now  How long ago  Were you  How  How long ago  Were you married  Uh  What am I up to  Three years  Three years ago 
[03:29:00]  Yeah  It still bothers him  That's how bad he wants to be your friend  You knew what I was  You knew what that was about  That you were a last minute invite  To fill up the seats  Duh  You knew  I had no idea  No you knew in your heart  Because Opie  But at least  At least you were a thought  No no  What it was  Some people didn't even get that  No what it was  Is he went around the room  And says  Hey Sam  Roland  Did I forget anybody  And everyone was like  No no  Oh maybe  Was that Mars  Oh shit  I forgot Mars  Fuck  Let me invite him 
[03:29:30]  Just to you  But I did  And the rest of us  In the room  Were telling him  Master Podium  Didn't get no invite  Oh yeah  No  The rest of us  In the room  I like Master Podium  I just didn't want him  Fucking karate chopping people  We're going  Opie  You don't need to invite Mars  Don't bother  Why invite him  Sam  Here's the problem  With friendships  Mars doesn't have  A skill  That I'm interested in  Me and Sam  Became friends  Because I saw  This little tech kid  I'm like  Fuck man  I can learn some shit  Plus  I can learn how to upload videos  And get my YouTube channel started  And he was the one 
[03:30:00]  That walked me through Twitter at first  When I brought it to his attention  But a little sad  No no no  You did not bring Twitter to my attention  I said  You brought it to my attention  Oh  But I brought it to your attention  Technically  Gotcha  And then you tell me  Oh I've been on Twitter a year  I'm like  You motherfucker  Holding out on me like this  I got you your first 50 followers  So you actually came to my house  Because I was using you  And  But then we kind of hit it off  During the using process  See your problem is  You don't have a skill  That I give a shit about  And the relationship  To get you in the door  The reason the relationship  Has blossomed 
[03:30:30]  Is because  His wife and my fiance  Actually have a legitimate friendship  And he had to be nice to me  Otherwise  At first I did  He would hear it from his wife  Do you fix toilets?  No you don't  That's what you assume  I got a running toilet  That I can't figure out  I've tried  The building guys have tried  Three or four different times  I guarantee it's running right now  If you can fix toilets  That's the end  To at least come into my apartment  You fix the toilet  Maybe we have some small talk  That brings you back  To fix another toilet  Phone number exchange  This weekend I'm fixing my own faucet  So if I succeed with that 
[03:31:00]  Then I'll go ahead  I'm good with faucets  But  We got with toilets  He's not lying man  That is so true  Yeah  We were alone  No one was around us  It was just him and I  And I said yo  What's up with the phone number  What's going on  He goes  What do you got to offer?  Swear to god man  I believe it  I was shocked  And I also  I like that he's sitting there going  I'm using Sam for his technical skills  While the engineer of the show  Is going  Can I be your friend?  Can I be  You want to know one better?  The engineer  You want to know one better?  One that really bothers me?  He's always talking about this guy 
[03:31:30]  That comes to his house  And sets up his sound  And his TV  And the audiovisual guy  You know that shit?  And I'm like this motherfucker  That's Joe from Sights and Sounds  You don't do Sights and Sounds  What's the  You do Sights and Sounds?  Yes  See the sound  That's his thing?  The radio broadcast  Oh shit  I never thought about that before  I'm not even joking  But you already got it guys  Oh fuck  You already got it guys  You could have done that as a side project?  Yes  Oh fuck  That would have been good money for you  You know how much I paid for my shit?  What's the sex  I don't talk about it often  But I got some shit 
[03:32:00]  What sexy skill  That he got on board with?  No  I'm out of the loop now  Since you took over  You're not out of the loop  Sam absolutely took over for you  Yeah  Because we were better friends  Before Sam came along  But not anymore  Now I'm the better friend  I would think  Iroch used to get abused easily  Not anymore  I did that to him  Yeah but not anymore  I've worked him for a long time  To stick up for himself  But here's the thing  Because I gotta go  Well here's what happens Sam  Mars is gonna come in  And then you're gonna be pushed out 
[03:32:30]  I can't hear  He said Mars is gonna come in  And I'm gonna be pushed out  If I get replaced by Mars  That's fine  I don't think I wanna be friends  With somebody who would  Replace me with Mars  But Mars  The whole thing  The whole point of this  Before I promote my Twitter  OP radio  And my YouTube channel  OP radio  Don't get bashful  Is that Mars had to sit there  As me and Don Trump  See I don't call him Donald anymore  Because he saw it happen  In front of his eyes  Me and Don Trump  Are officially friends 
[03:33:00]  And Mars had to sit there  And watch it happen  Did you exchange phone numbers  We got digits  Oh  That had to hurt Mars  Very much  It took you  It's taken you seven years  Still nothing  Don Jr.  One  Well I mean he's been on a few times  But it was just you know  Kind of one day  Oh yeah you're kind of cool  Let's  Because he  Has celebrity to offer  Yes he does  Don  Yeah  No he's got fly fishing to offer  And celebrity  I don't even realize he's a celebrity  Like I wanna do that fly fishing thing  And he said I'm nice in Roscoe 
[03:33:30]  Nice  Fly fishing and celebrity  What you got you don't have nothing  That I want  So does Don Trump replace Sam  I guess I should realize that  And you  But you can't even  You can't speak English or Spanish  You don't have a language to offer  You got nothing  I could babysit  Oh get the fuck out of here  Your family's full of child molesters  You admitted that  That your people  Tend to touch children  Yeah  That was them not me  No I don't believe that for a second  Yeah  That shit gets passed down generation  The apple doesn't  Or it does  No it doesn't  Look I could offer you 
[03:34:00]  If you could fix this one toilet  That no one else could figure out  It might be  It might lead to  Like fixing another toilet  Maybe a clogged sink  In between  Waiting for parts to arrive  Or something  Then we small talk  And then maybe  We get something going  Like Sam is still  Learn how to do it  That's what I would do  If he said  Hey Sam  You know how to use  iMovie or whatever  I'd be like yeah  And then I'd go home  I'd learn it  And then by the time  I got to his house  I'd be able to teach it to him  Sam now  It took a while  But now he actually 
[03:34:30]  Gets the invite  Just to hang  Every time he came to my place  It was because  I needed him to like  Do something  Right  I mean there are still  Some invites of work  It's like work and friendship  Yeah  Like celebrating New Years  Wait you're doing  You do sights and sounds  Yes man  I knew you did the sounds part  You know what  You know  What's the sights part  I didn't know you did sights  I went to NYU for film  I was just going to say that  He studied film  And you got your whole video thing  And I've been the video guy  He never asked me about anything 
[03:35:00]  Referenced to film  Or how to shoot something  God I can't look past  The Puerto Rican thing  Yeah  I just think Puerto Rican  What does he know  What was Iraq's skill originally  When he started becoming  Super fan  That was it  You just wanted the ego boost  No  You just needed somebody around you  Going you're awesome OP  Remember that time  He just collected all sorts of stuff  About me that I didn't have  And I'm like fuck  I could use that  Oh so you're like  Give me some tapes  Give me some newspaper clippings  Yeah and old bits  I forgot about years ago 
[03:35:30]  And press clippings  And he has dirt on every radio guy  Yeah  And he's just a little gossip  He's a little gossip queen  He gets me  He gets me fucking gossip  Every day  It rules  I know so much shit about people  That I'll never say  Yeah but some of  Half the time  He's got it wrong  No  That's the scary part  If you want to abuse him  That's fine  We'll do that Monday  But if you want a real talk  Right now  This guy knows shit  He's giving you good information  He fucking knows shit 
[03:36:00]  Iraq  That's your skill  Did you know this  Yeah I did  I know  But he never wanted me  To blow up his spot  Cause now he knows  Everybody knows  He gossips now  Yeah everybody knows  He's a rat  Everybody knows I'm a rat  You know you deal with it  Want a minute  Shit if I come over  With some old clipping  No thank you  You might call me a stalker  You know he's already  Think I stalk him  Take the mint  Mark  Mark this is why  You're so bad at this  Whenever Opie offers you  Anything you just say yes  Want a mint  No thank you  They might not be mints  Oh in that case 
[03:36:30]  Let me get two  It took me  You know what I'm talking about  They might not be mints  I know  Mars it took me years  Before I said no to Opie  Oh by the way  You think I'm bullshitting  About the I hate  Steven Singer diamond thing  I'm doing with him  Diamonds right there  Those are not  Those are mints  There's a few diamonds  And they're loose  I didn't see one diamond  They're all mints  Listen to the diamonds  Sound like mints to me  I'm going to Times Square  Right now  Making a few deals  So are you and Mars  Going to be friends  No I just laid the whole thing out  Mars  You get wordy on this show  I already told you 
[03:37:00]  Everything you need to know  He doesn't have a skill  That I'm interested in  You know and it's not the  Racial thing either  Because he's got Roland  As a good friend  Yeah it's not the racial thing  But it is the Puerto Rican thing  Excuse me  A Puerto Rican didn't make my life  I mean a Mexican  Didn't make my life miserable  For ten years  Okay  Opie can I tell you something  A Puerto Rican did  Can I tell you something  Mexicans never did me wrong  Can I tell you something Opie  Mars since back on 57th street  For years  Has come to me and said  So Sammy seriously 
[03:37:30]  Do you think he doesn't like  Puerto Ricans  Is that  Do you  And he's asked me  Because those are  Private conversations man  But you asked me that right  In all sincerity  You asked me that  Yes I did  Yes that's true  That's what he's worried about  God now I gotta be  Craig Hughes for a second  He might be a racist  I'm not gonna be  Craig Hughes  It's bits  Why would one  Puerto Rican  Yeah  Make me hate all  Puerto Ricans  One rotten apple  Doesn't spoil the bunch  That's right  Oh boy 
[03:38:00]  It was her family too  Wow  Yeah  It'll be in the book  Trust me  I gotta sell some  Loose diamonds  Those aren't diamonds  Oh boy  Hopi  Hookid's coming up the hole  You better block him  If you don't  You know  Look you do whatever you want  With this hour  I was just suggesting  That maybe too much  Hookid  You said do that  About the mashup too  Hey Hookid  You know where I can sell  Some loose diamonds  So Marge  We got a little more insight  He needs somebody  Who he can use  Yes I see  Which is true 
[03:38:30]  You know  I mean  He  Iroch and I  Have both been used  For various skills  Is there anything  You think you could offer him  Like I said  I could have done  His audio visual  At the house  Not what you could have  That's already been filled  I could help him  Edit his videos too  I've already taught him  How to edit  I taught him how to do  Like I taught him  How to do it  I have nothing  I really  Now I'm going to  Turn my sights on  Anthony  If you're worried  That Opie might not like you 
[03:39:00]  Because you're a different ethnicity  Don't even start with Anthony  Well you never know  Ant might need an engineer  For live at the compound  That's what he's got Danny for  It's been filled  That's why they've both  Come to me before  And asked for a little  Something something  But that's the thing  They ask you for help  But they don't want you  At the house  Like they'll just say  Just ask Mars real quick  He's got an open door policy  At the house  He's also got guns  Yeah that's what  That's why I stay away  That's two factors  You always remember right  Yes sir  Oh man 
[03:39:30]  Well uh  And Eric  You think that your relationship  With Opie  Is not what it used to be  I actually think it's better  In what sense  That he calls you  All the time now  You prefer it that way  Well if you want to go back  To the Atlantic City  Luggage incident  Well listen  I ended up with a pocket  Full of cash  And a free weekend  In Atlantic City  And we want to break down  What was really happening  And no sleep  And had to come back  And do special delivery  No sleep  I was there all weekend  I thought you came back  To do special delivery 
[03:40:00]  I went up on Friday  Oh  Dude he came off  Like a champ  Tell him about that one too  What happened  Remember when that happened  I went up to you  What the fuck man  Why did he  Could have called me  I could have done it  Yes sir  I started laughing at me  I was like ah  Yeah  I got cash  Hotel  Hanging out with  Jim backstage  A weekend in Atlantic City  You took your girl  I took Jess  Like I really don't see  How I ended up  The loser in that situation  I just carried  An extra bag up there 
[03:40:30]  Okay  I didn't look at it  From that perspective  No I looked at it  As like I was busy  What were you busy doing  Watching Netflix  And eating potato chips  Good one  No  I was here  I was here at work  When he called  Okay so you were busy  Working on his show  And then I had something else to do  That was about the time  That E-Rock started changing up  Yeah  He started saying  Fuck that  You know  I ain't doing that  I didn't say fuck that  But like his first excuse  I laughed  He's like  I'm not gonna do that  I'm gonna stay here  And work on the  Opie and Anthony show  You're still doing work for him 
[03:41:00]  Yeah but there's a difference  Between show work  And hey can you grab my suitcase  And take it to Atlantic City  Yeah and have a free weekend  And money  Alright  Enjoy yourself  E-Rock you would never do that  For someone  He doesn't need the cash anymore  You see Mars  That's how people change  He doesn't need the cash  You do from your big mansion  Yeah no  This year's going to be interesting  You moved in yesterday  No  Yesterday was  The final walk through 
[03:41:30]  And then  Took all day  It's a big house  And then closing with the lawyers  And all that  Oh what a pain  I hate moving  My sister  Is moving into my building  Which could end up  Being horrible  I'm not sure yet  E-Rock you get some of that money back  First year  With your taxes  Well yeah I know  But that's not till  At least April of 2013  Oh you gotta wait  But for now it's just  How much is he gonna  For now he's just gotta  Worry about that fat salary check  That he gets  Exactly  Now he's going check to check 
[03:42:00]  Which granted  Allows  Affords him to live a nice lifestyle  Even check to check  But still  Yeah well that'll change soon too  Why  You're gonna quit  No  So why was that  It's just  There's a lot of my money  Is going to other places now  Than  Like what  Being able to save it  And use it frivolously  Is the wife pregnant  No  No that's not gonna be for a while  Why  She won't give it up  Well that's a reason right  Why is that not gonna be for a while  Just cause we were dealing with 
[03:42:30]  Getting the house  And moving in  So after you know  Everything's all settled  Then we'll do luck  A little nagel  That Mars will never see  You never show  Never show him to Mars  Never show me  What  Mars can't come to my house  Cause there's a playground  Right next to it  So you'd invite him  But legally he can't be there  Yeah  It wasn't me  It was the family members  Whatever man  How old before you'll  Frost his tips for him  Little nagel  More than likely  The kid will be blonde  What 
[03:43:00]  Is your wife naturally blonde  When she was born  She was blonde  Up until  Somewhere between  Five and ten  Myself and all my siblings  Were all born  Really blonde  And  With the exception of  Me and my older sister  All the rest of them  Are still light blonde  So  All the kids  Should come out blonde  Are you  You have to move  All your shit  So you had to pack up  All your autographs  And things  Like  Did you realize  As you were moving  How much shit 
[03:43:30]  You really have  Cause you never  Like I never knew  How much shit  I'd accumulated  Until I started moving  From apartment to apartment  Well  Hold on  Because you also  Don't have to take into  Consideration  All the wrestling stuff  That you have  At your parents house  That didn't have to be  Packed up and moved with you  Cause  Added that on to your  To whatever else you got  I don't have a mansion  To put it in  I don't either  Eric  It's compound light  Is what I got  I call it the mansion  There's nothing about you  That's light anyway  Oh good one  Did you realize 
[03:44:00]  How much shit you have  Like oh my god  I threw out a lot of stuff  Any good stuff  I would have liked  No nothing really  But  Yeah I was amazed  How much stuff  I did have  And what I was  Throwing away  Compared to  What we just had  Overall in the apartment  What do you mean  Just  So much shit  In the apartment  Like furniture and stuff  Or  DVDs  Books  Glassware  You know  All that stuff  Are you taking the DVDs  Or are you gonna  Oh all of them are going  Throwing them out 
[03:44:30]  Or going with you  Going with me  That's so funny  Going with me  You know you're not gonna  Use them after a year  Like DVD is almost finished  Well  Look  I only recently  Within the last two years  Got rid of all my CDs  You know  Ripped them all  And they're all on hard drives  Now  When that technology  Is  More user friendly  Where you can rip  A DVD  Sort of like an MP3  Yeah  Put them all on hard drives  I know you can  Yeah but  You can't get  A lot of them  On a drive  And you gotta have  Special equipment  And whatever 
[03:45:00]  But when it's common  That you can rip  A DVD  Or even a Blu-ray  To a hard drive  And hold it  Like you would  On an iPod  Or something  And you don't have to  Hire like a service  Or something  I'll get rid of  All those DVDs  Yeah it just sucks  You have to move them  How many DVDs  Do you have  There's over a thousand  Jesus Christ  I had a photo  You know what  I'll Twitter it now  Of wall one  Of my old living room  That was just  Empty DVD racks  When is the first  Mansion party?

[03:48:00]  We risk those letters  Being followed by HR  So yes  Public relations  Public relations  That's how I read  Public relations  We didn't even get to talk about it yesterday  And I wanted to  D.L. Hughley was on  And he was great as always  Because you were talking so much  About what a nice man  Henry Winkler was  The reason I love D.L. Hughley  Is of course  What he did  For the legendary intern David  And when he was talking  About  Was it Bob Kelly too  Bob Kelly or no  I think it was just D.L. putting the money in  Bob Kelly  Bob gave the instructions  Of where to go 
[03:48:30]  How to do it  And D.L. funded it  Is D.L. going to make the countdown this week Eric  Of course it is  Okay well D.L.  He was talking about  Raising his son  Who has autism  And wanting his son  To just have  That one experience  With a girl  He said he needed  He wanted his son  To get laid  Get his heart broken  And all this stuff  And I saw that  When he was dealing with David  He saw David as a kid  Who just needed  To get laid  And D.L. said  I'm going to help this man out  Right now  I'm going to give him the money 
[03:49:00]  $200  Or something like that  Yeah  And then Bob Kelly  Told him exactly where to go  To get himself jerked off  We said it before  But you got to replay  The raw audio  Of you talking to him  On the street  After everything happened  Not even replay  Play it for the first time  It's 45 minutes long  And we've never played  The full thing  Oh yeah  We played highlights  We played highlights  We never played the full  The full interview  That I did  Right after it happened  And that was one of my  Most favorite things  I've ever done  But you know  What I was thinking  When D.L. was in here 
[03:49:30]  And I've thought this before  You can come on in  Who kid  You're welcome  Yeah of course  Come in  We were talking about  D.L. Hughley  He once gave our intern  Money to go to  A Yankee Cranky  Like a jerk off  Massage parlor  Oh my god  I just came from  Just talking about it  I didn't come from that though  Oh  You didn't come?  Me and Stephen Blatter  Was at a strip club  Oh damn  You were  Is he a big tipper?  What?  Yeah  Dallas come out?  It was a  Ass eating contest 
[03:50:00]  And one side  Was the Republicans  And the other side  Was the Democrats  Keeping it political  Very topical  Yeah but the Republicans  Won though  They did  They ate so much ass  Oh my god  I didn't know  I mean  I don't do these things  With anybody who works here  It's amazing  The relationship  Who Blatter was like  Who Republicans  I don't know anything  I don't know anything  About that  What bad  What happened  Was that  Eric  What I was  They got a volume knob  In there somewhere  What I was saying was  And I was thinking about this  I think  I think  Did we recently play  The Kevin Nealon interview  That David was in on  We recently 
[03:50:30]  I don't think so  We did some bit  That David  It was not an  Intern David  Centered bit  But it was a  He was a part of it  He was in on it  Like he just came in  And the reason  I realized  While I was listening to that  Why I loved  Intern David so much  Was just the honesty  I love Intern David  He gave you a direct answer  To the question  Sometimes it made no sense  Sometimes it was  Completely rude  But he just gave it to you  And Eric  Like we have enough material  I don't think we've ever done it  Can we do an  Intern David  Best of show  Of course we can  Yes  Like what about  What about the next 
[03:51:00]  Here's what I'm thinking  This is all formed  Into my head  The next Jewish holiday  Okay  The next Jewish holiday  We do  Passover right  Sometime around there  We do one day  It's the best of  Intern David  And then  In the time slot  That would be  After Opie and Anthony  Live  That fifth hour  We do the  Yeah we do the whole  45 minute interview  That I conducted with him  Right after  He got out of the  Massage party  Watch him  He won't do the show anymore  I'll have to host it 
[03:51:30]  By myself  I would love to try to get him  Or go find him  And then host it  Well we know where he is  He just won't talk to us  He runs away from people  He works now  This is his kid  He's just  Spaz  I think you  You might have met him  I've met him before  I know what you're talking about  He had the thick glasses on  And he was  You know  But now he works  At the  9-11 memorial  Wow  He works at the  World Trade 7  Yeah Travis  Saw him  Who works here  Yeah he walks around  With an iPad  And then  If you're looking for  A family member  Or co-worker  Or something like that  You give them the name  And he can tell you 
[03:52:00]  Which position  That their  Their memorial is at there  That's all he does  But as soon as Travis  Walked over  He ran away  Yeah he runs away  He didn't want  Nothing to do with the show  You think he'll run away from me?  Remember he had a  He had a really  A good liking to me  He might not  You know why?  He had a crush on you?  Yeah I think so  Like a little bit of a crush  Bromance  Something like that  He looked up to me  He looked up to me  He might not run away from you  Because he doesn't see you  As one of the show guys  Yes  Yes  Kind of like  Kind of like  Opie doesn't see you  As one of the show guys  Shut up motherfucker 
[03:52:30]  I know  The guy we have to send  To get David here  Has to be Kenny  He would answer to Kenny  He would respond to Kenny  You know Kenny  The security guard  Yeah yeah yeah  He's a cool guy though  David loves  He won't run away from Kenny?  No  Kenny  Club's out of Kenny  Out of the goodness of his heart  For no reason  And I shouldn't say this  Because we have interns now  Right  But nobody asked him to  David didn't ask him to  And he's never done it  For any other intern  Every single morning  He would go down  He'd get his breakfast  And he'd come up  And he'd bring David breakfast  Every morning  Come on man  You can't be serious 
[03:53:00]  Every morning  Every morning  Without fail  What?  It was hilarious  He's too nice that guy man  And then David would just be like  Thank you Kenny  Thank you Kenny  Are you serious?  He had his breakfast  I didn't know that  Yeah every morning  Kenny's a cool guy  He is a cool guy  He's like DJ who  I respect you  Is that what he said?  I respect you  I was like huh?  I don't know  Okay  You know he spent a lot of time  As a police officer  That's why I didn't know  If you two would mesh  Maybe he pulled me over  Or threw me on the floor  One time 
[03:53:30]  I don't know  But he does respect me though  I'm glad you're in here actually  Because Obi brought up  We were talking about  Superbowl bets  And your man  50 cent  Who you work with  A million dollars out there  But first  At first  He went on Twitter  And said  If the Giants don't win  I'm going to tweet  A nude picture  Of my penis  Wow  Like  Why would he  Why would he bet that?  He either said that  Maybe his Twitter got hacked  Are you serious?  He said that  That's the unit man  Yeah that's what I'm saying  That's the gay unit man  And then  Marley 
[03:54:00]  You were about to say  Birdman  Yeah the baby  He said  He would put a  Five million dollar bet  On the Patriots  50 cent  And Obi was right  When he brought it up  50 cent said  He would bet  Birdman  One million dollars  That the Giants  Would beat the Patriots  Serious?  Yeah  Do you know anything about this?  I know Birdman  Put five million out there  50 cent  He would do a million  To Birdman  Are you worried  That's going to come out  Of your salary?  I don't know  Because where's he going  To get the million from? 
[03:54:30]  So somebody's going to have  Five million in cash  At the Super Bowl  In Indianapolis  I guess  That's what Birdman said  You know how boring  It is over there  Who the hell walks around  With five million dollars  Five million in cash  Out there yo  I guess so  I don't know  Somebody needs to talk  To Nelly though  Why?  He put like  20 G's on the Jets  Somebody needs to tell him  That the Jets are  At the Super Bowl  I don't know man  So wrong with that guy man  Oh my god  We were also talking 
[03:55:00]  About today  We had  You know  Norton was out today  And you know  Who was filling in for him?  Who was filling in for him?  This is the A-list caliber people  The people like Roland  Roland  Roland has put the  Opie and Anthony show  At celebrity level  Donald Trump Jr.  Was filling in for Jim Norton today  No way  The whole show  Did he give away money?  No  Except  E-Rock got a little bashing  Because he brought him in with  Money, money, money, money  That was a hack  Yeah  But then again 
[03:55:30]  Eric at this point  Is there anything you can do  That they won't bash you for?  He ain't listening  He's not listening  That's a not so slim shady  Yeah  Exactly  I like that guy  Oh yeah  I mean I'm peanuts  We're just kidding  Eric  He's back  He doesn't have any clue  I heard  I thought Tom Green  Was hanging with you  Tom Green was the other day  He's going to be on  Is he going to be on your show?  Yeah  He's doing Caroline's on Saturday 
[03:56:00]  So he thought he'd come up  To the whitest show on hip hop  Which is your show  Which is my show  Yes  Yeah it's amazing  Rude Jude does afternoons  On your channel  He's an actual white guy  But your show is still whiter  Yeah I'm whiter than Rude Jude  Definitely  I love Rude Jude  He's the man  Yeah  Are you kidding me?  But he says he's bringing  A Charlie's Angel  To my show this Saturday  Who is?  A secret one  Jude?  Tom Green  Yeah  A secret Charlie's Angel  Yeah it's going to be serious  I wonder who it could be  I hope it's not the box  I don't know  He's going to bring

That's the bitch  Oh oh  Extraterrestrial  She was the little girl  I thought you meant  Entertainment Tonight  Well I'm sorry  For living in 2012  And not 1986 
[03:57:00]  Like I said  I was in a strip club  With Stephen Blatter yesterday  I don't know anything about that  Um  That's eating  I felt a little vindicated today  I have to say that  I don't know  Speaking of eating  Because  Obi was talking about  How delicious chicken fingers are  Get out of here  And  Chicken fingers  Chicken fingers  Come on man  Yeah  That's what he eats  Man  Not  Chicken's actual finger  Like  Just fried chicken fingers 
[03:57:30]  Chinese people eat the feet though  I know they eat the feet  I've tried that before  Chicken feet  I had that in Taipei  You did  It tastes like walnuts  Walnuts  What type of chicken feet did you eat?  They put like some special paprika  On it  Like some special spices  I guess I've never had the real chicken feet before  You never had chicken  What do you call it?  Chicken nails  It's crazy  What's your favorite fast food place?  Because they were talking about that today  Like Donald was in  And he was saying  Oh like a hood spot?  Yeah what's the hood?

I like  What do you call it?  New York fried chicken  That's like really hood  Kennedy fried chicken  Kennedy fried  Kennedy fried  They got the buns in there  That is so perfect  I don't know why they give it to poor people  But the buns deserve to be  I think rich people deserve those buns  But we can't 
[03:58:30]  We can't  You can't go in the neighborhood  You can't go in there and get the buns though  Although in New Rochelle  In Westchester baby  There is a Kennedy fried chicken  No way  New Rochelle is very  That's a nice neighborhood  Well half of it is nice  Half of it  Not so nice  Is there races there?  No people just stick to their sides  Okay  You know what I mean  Like people are  Like if you grew up on the north end  It's okay man  It's alright man  You don't go on the south end  And vice versa  Like if you grew up on the north end  You're afraid to go in the south end  Okay 
[03:59:00]  If you grew up on the south end  You're not allowed to go in the north end  For real?  You know what I mean  Yeah it's one of those things  Maybe you take Kenny  He'll do some security for you  Take you to go get some candy chicken  Kennedy fried  Like  I  Friday very exciting  Because it's always Wendy's day  But that's just because  Wendy's is downstairs  You really  You guys really go get Wendy's for real?
