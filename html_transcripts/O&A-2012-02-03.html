<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a furious rant about their exclusion from Radio Row at the Super Bowl.  Opie and Anthony are livid at being snubbed, despite their expressed interest, and point out the presence of numerous celebrities like Tim Tebow, Joe Montana, Larry Bird, and Madonna.  They repeatedly blame their management, specifically Scott Greenstein and Gary,  using profanity to express their anger.  A listener call confirms the celebrity appearances, adding fuel to their outrage.  The hosts also discuss a possibly dubious Vegas trip for a UFC event and their consistently poor representation in listener surveys and show preference emails, citing evidence gathered by Sam. They further express frustration with a perceived lack of support from their sales team.  The discussion then shifts to  Daryl Hammond's autobiography and Courtney Love’s use of Kurt Cobain’s unreleased material.

The show continues with a discussion about Nirvana bootlegs, Kurt Cobain's cassette tapes, and his daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, including her emancipation from Courtney Love and her relationship with Isaiah Silva of The Rambles. Opie and Anthony comment on photos of Frances Bean, making observations about her weight.  They then launch into a scathing critique of Courtney Love, using highly offensive terms like "cunt" and "attention whore," and discuss the book "Who Killed Kurt Cobain?" and author Ian Halpern's upcoming Lady Gaga movie.

The conversation pivots to the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, focusing on Donald Trump's endorsement of Mitt Romney, which is heavily criticized.  The hosts express their highly critical and offensive opinions on various Republican candidates, including Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Ron Paul.  A heated debate with a caller, Boomer, ensues regarding government regulation, particularly concerning pornography and internet censorship, referencing Max Hardcore and John Stalliano.  This exchange involves highly offensive language and strongly worded criticisms from both sides, touching upon the historical stances of the Republican and Democratic parties on slavery and gay marriage. The conversation branches into further discussion of internet regulation, gambling, parental controls, and potential Republican vice-presidential candidates, concluding with a darkly humorous, offensive speculation on the hosts’ hypothetical treatment of slaves.

Jim Norton joins the show, expressing frustration with being perceived as a Democrat apologist despite criticizing both liberals and conservatives, using homophobic and misogynistic slurs in his commentary.  The discussion returns to the Super Bowl, focusing on betting, featuring calls from listeners, including a former bookie, Mike from Queens, who details point spreads, prop bets (including those concerning Tim Tebow and Gatorade shower color), and the illegality of online gambling, along with an account of a raid on his operation, alleging corruption.  A phone call with Ty West, director of "The Innkeepers," follows, discussing the film’s release, Q&As, and an event at the film's location, including a cryptic mention of a brunch with Nicole Kidman.  The show concludes with a brief “Black History Month” segment honoring Jimmy McMillan, followed by a segment featuring "worst best man" speeches, including entries from Clayton Jacoby, Wayne Manneke (whose speech included jokes about his brother's ugliness and his wife's car accident), and the extremely offensive and vulgar speech by Sean Ryan. This is followed by further banter,  including Anthony Cumia’s concern about his Shorty Awards ranking and discussions about several Nicks (Cannon, Carter), Dino Costa, and potential guests like Nicolas Cage, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Daniel Tosh, concluding with references to a "hipster hat," a "Disco Sucks" t-shirt, and a song about "sick fucking puppies."  The hosts’ continued absence from Radio Row is mentioned again, this time attributed to SiriusXM's decision to protect their value.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the roll!  Unbelievable.  Fantastic.  Should we apologize ahead of time for the next 20 minutes of radio?  Should we just get it out of the way and apologize?  Oh my god.  I blame the listeners on this one because...  Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I do.  Now, how's that?  Good morning, by the way. Anthony Jr.  Morning!  As you know by now, why do a radio show from the Super Bowl 
[00:00:30]  when you could be broadcasting a mere block away from Times Square in the middle of winter?  Exactly.  And thank God we have people in place here in management  that found it in their hearts to protect us, Opie.  That's right.  From a place at the Super Bowl called Radio Row.  Now, this is where various radio shows go  and are just put in the worst conditions, 
[00:01:00]  the worst places, they're treated like shit,  probably has been guests that are paraded in front of them  that you never want to talk to.  And management here decided, without even consulting us,  thank God, because we couldn't be bothered with this drivel  to just say, these guys wouldn't want to be on Radio Row.  What was the exact quote?  We just knew you guys wouldn't want to be on Radio Row,  something called Radio Row.  Yeah, so we decided not to even ask. 
[00:01:30]  So we weren't even going to ask because...  Yeah.  Yeah, they were there helping us.  So yesterday...  Oh my God.  These fuckers that we call our listeners  tweeted me over and over again, just rubbing it in.  Yeah.  And the one picture they sent a lot  and basically said, this could have been you.  Yeah.  Is the picture of good old Tim Tebow.  You know, that Tim Tebow guy  who's probably the number one football player of the year.  Yeah.  He certainly got the most attention. 
[00:02:00]  Hanging out with Sway, who's our neighbor here at SiriusXL.  Hey, look, a picture of Sway on Radio Row with Tim Tebow.  You know, he's suffering on Radio Row  by interviewing Tim Tebow, of all people.  So I truly want to thank management for saving us  from this Radio Row.  Let me tell you.  We could have had the biggest sports figure of the year on the show.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  But instead, we're broadcasting in the middle of winter,  a block away from Times Square.  Well, Opie, look, I don't want to get out of control here 
[00:02:30]  because that's probably just a fluke, you know, with the rest.  I mean, there probably wasn't one other person worthy  of even interviewing on something as, ugh, as Radio Row.  Oh, are you trying to say that might have just been a...  A fluke.  A fluke?  That was a fluke.  Okay.  Oh, Sam, yes, you have something to add?  No, I was just reading Tim Tebow's Twitter  because he actually tweeted out the picture of him and Sway.  He's having such a good time.  He had so much fun with the interview. 
[00:03:00]  He said, oh, my God, it was great meeting Sway.  Here's a picture of me and Sway.  Well, that's nice.  A guy, by the way, and we like Sway.  We get along with him.  He's our neighbor.  Yes.  We didn't get along with the other people, the old tenants.  Yeah.  I don't even know who they were.  Well, they were squatting.  They had to be kicked out.  Were they squatting?  The sheriff's department.  He's a much better neighbor.  Yeah, he's a much better neighbor.  We absolutely get along.  But we're a little mad that the guy's only been here four or five months  and he got to go to this Radio Row broadcast live.  Well, I mean, it was just amazing.  You were talking about other people at Radio Row. 
[00:03:30]  Tim Tebow was actually very excited.  He said, just got to Radio Row,  and the first person I meet is one of the greatest ever, Joe Montana.  Who?  Who?  Awesome.  Who's Joe Montana?  Oh, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Tim Tebow and Joe Montana.  Thank God it might have been saved us from Radio Row, Anthony.  Radio Row.  Who would want to meet probably the greatest Super Bowl quarterback of all time?  That's just stupid.  Can you fucking believe these people? 
[00:04:00]  Radio Row, apparently, is the fucking place to be.  Well, that's why they didn't want us there.  Exactly.  Don't lie and say you're protecting us from anything.  This Scott Greenstein sucks.  Uh, well, he won't hear that because he's at the Super Bowl.  Who gives a fuck?  This guy with his, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  You don't got shit when it comes to us.  Enough with this, oh, well, what can we do for you?  We got to get you out there.  You guys, we really want to make you bigger than life 
[00:04:30]  and have you do some of these broadcasts.  And so we have to do a shitty broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe  when this is right around the corner?  This guy sucks.  And someone has to say it.  The fuck is he doing as the main guy in programming around here?  Why aren't we there?  We did indicate that we wanted to go.  Of course we did.  We were told in that meeting that we were in last week,  we were told that the reason we aren't at the Super Bowl 
[00:05:00]  is because they assumed we would not want to be on Radio Row  with a bunch of other shows and radio stations and people.  We do radio.  Where else should we be but Radio Row?  This stupid guy in the corner office always,  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  Sure made it happen.  There's actually a paparazzi line on the side of Radio Row.  It's exciting.  Because there's a lot of celebrities that are making their way through. 
[00:05:30]  That's why we weren't asked to go to Radio Row.  Ever since we heard this, you know,  we didn't think you'd want to be part of Radio Row.  That's all I hear, Radio Row.  Jim Rowe, Jim Rome is on Radio Row.  Jay Moore is on Radio Row.  And it's not something that just the industry insiders are using.  Tim Tebow himself said, hey, I'm on Radio Row here.  And, you know, it's like the place to be.  It's a thing you do as a celebrity or a major sport.  Joe Montana?  Look at Radio Row.  Look how beautiful it looks.  That's like a real talk show. 
[00:06:00]  That's like a TV show.  They put a whole studio down there for those people alone.  Oh, my God.  I got it, I got it.  You don't got shit.  Fuck.  Why were we?  Need you guys to get out there and, you know, do some broadcasts and some live events.  How about a live event from the Super Bowl instead of the Hard Rock Cafe for the 100th time?  You don't got shit.  Nothing ready.  Last time at the Hard Rock, I started asking the people that were filing by for their autograph.  I've seen them so many times.  I felt like I was famous to me. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I felt like I was meeting a lot of famous people.  You're right.  And this is one that we did indicate we wanted to do.  It's not like we didn't mention it.  Very early on.  Of course.  We said we wanted to go.  Wait, wait, wait.  We said we wanted to go when they approached us and asked us first if we wanted to go.  We were asked, would you guys be up for doing a broadcast from the Super Bowl?  We said, yes, of course we would.  They go, all right, we'll work on it.  So then they start working on it.  Right.  And from what I hear, you know, they thought we wouldn't want to be on Radio Row.  There's Jay Moore. 
[00:07:00]  Jay.  Jay Moore is on Radio Row.  Right.  Joe Montana.  That's all you need to hear.  Radio Row was good enough for Joe Montana.  I think it's good enough for us.  Kurt Schilling was there.  Kurt Schilling.  Yeah, Kurt Schilling was there.  I guess he did all right in baseball, huh?  Yeah, kind of.  He got a little bit of press.  Can you fucking...  So instead, we're here...  All these other shows are there.  Yeah.  Instead, we're here in an empty fucking building.  Because we don't have the right guys fucking running the channel. 
[00:07:30]  And the head guy is too busy fucking doing who knows what.  Because everybody else is at the Super Bowl.  Everybody.  Everybody is.  Everybody.  Hey, who's that?  That's the rookie of the year, Adrian Peterson.  Is he on Radio Row?  Oh, yeah.  That's where he is right there.  There he is on Radio Row.  He brought his trophy.  See, they made it sound like Radio Row was like, okay, you know, all the broadcasters,  TV broadcasters and all, all are going to be in this really cool section. 
[00:08:00]  And then they're going to throw all radio guys in this shitty Radio Row area.  And no one will go through there because it's Radio Row.  There won't be any guests or anything.  That's from 2008.  Oh, my God.  I was going to say, where the hell...  What the hell is that?  I see Mike and the Mad Dog.  Especially if you had Roland down there talking to all these publicists or whatever.  He could have wrangled some people who would have talked to us.  Exactly.  It would have been absolutely great for the show.  We would have pressed the flesh, as they like to say.  We would have made connections.  We would have given...  We would have had some great interviews with these guys.  It would have upped our status with the company and in the entertainment world in general. 
[00:08:30]  But instead, we're sitting in a shitty little fucking studio in the middle of Times Square  while pretty much everyone else from the company is down there.  Everyone else from the company is down there.  That's a big fucking insult.  We're just a piece of shit.  We are treated.  And then we got this guy who keeps going, I got it, I got it.  You don't got nothing.  I have no respect for that guy.  I have no problem saying it.  Ed Jones, old cowboy.  I would love to meet Ed Jones talking about boxing. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, but you would have had to be on Radio Row.  Radio Row, yuck.  And this is what we're going to get today.  We're going to get that fucking egghead walking around the hallways with a cup of coffee,  make him believe that something's going on that he has to get to.  Hoping that no one notices that he's useless.  Drew Brees.  Drew Brees, huh?  You could have had your showdown with Boomer finally.  Well, obviously.  Ah, look at that.  Boomer's there, yeah.  Obviously, Drew Brees wouldn't hang out on Radio Row.  That's crazy. 
[00:09:30]  No, that's where he was.  That's what I'm saying.  Why would he do that?  Why would he want to be in Radio Row?  Well, there's a photo.  I mean, that's him.  That's Radio Row.  You see?  And this guy, because the listeners love rubbing it in.  Well, let him talk.  Jim in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Jim.  Jim.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, did you know that Rosie O'Donnell was there?  Yeah.  Oh, she's broadcasting from Radio Row.  The company thought it was very important to have her down there, representing Sirius XM.  Why would she be there?  Oh, she's one of the guys.  That's why.  Dick Vermeule.  What?  Maybe she's a linebacker. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Dick Vermeule.  Who's Dick Vermeule?  He's a coach who cries a lot.  I know who Dick Vermeule is.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  Just another guy.  All right.  Thank you.  Let me say hi to Tony in Brooklyn, it looks like.  Hey, yeah.  Mad Dog had Larry Bird on, which was a great interview.  I mean, you never get to hear Larry Bird anymore.  Larry Bird?  Larry Bird was hanging out at Radio Row.  Yeah.  Larry Bird.  Larry Bird, who's pretty much on almost everyone's top five list. 
[00:10:30]  That would have been a nice compliment for Kareem next week.  Right.  Ah, right.  We would have had Larry Bird one day and then Kareem.  Right.  They just don't want to.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't know.  They don't think highly of us, but it's also about the expense of bringing the show.  And let's just say that that money can be better spent flying other people around.  I gather.  We weren't going to be that expensive, trust me, especially knowing who's going down. 
[00:11:00]  They're flying assistants down for salespeople.  They're flying salespeople down there.  For what reason, I don't even know.  If no one was going, I would understand.  All right.  No one's going.  And our agent fought for us.  Oh.  Right.  Yeah.  There's problems across the board.  Radio Row.  Ugh.  Look at it.  Oh, God.  I bet it smells like shit.  No, just Jay Moore having a blast.  Who's he doing it for?  His own podcast?  No, he's a guest. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, he's a guest at Radio Row.  Yeah, he's going on all the shows.  And he's doing stuff for Jim Rome, too.  Oh, yeah.  Him and Jim Rome are pals.  Yeah.  Is Rome on Radio Row?  Yeah.  But why would he want to do that?  Radio Row is supposed to be this shitty place.  Oh, thank God we were protected from this.  We were protected from Radio Row.  Can you believe?  Joe Montana, Tim Tebow.  Larry Bird.  Larry Bird.  Good thing we'd have to deal with these guys.  Oh, what bums.  Michael Irving.  Is that Michael Irving? 
[00:12:00]  We saw a picture of him earlier.  Michael Irving is down there.  He loves me.  We laughed about hookers together.  Sure.  Yeah, Michael Irving's there.  Yeah, of course.  Why wouldn't he be?  It's Irving, but...  Irving, yes.  Still, you know, he's a fun interview.  And then this guy will want to have another meeting with us where nothing happens.  God.  Kurt Schilling.  Kurt Schilling.  A whole tampon foot.  Yeah.  Oh.  What?  Jerry Rice.  Jerry Rice.  Hey, Jerry Rice.  Jerry Rice. 
[00:12:30]  They just didn't want us there.  That's the bottom line.  Yeah, yeah.  Just don't even try to tell me.  You were protecting us.  Yeah, safe to say Radio Row is the epicenter of the Super Bowl.  As far as the media goes.  Because they know who goes...  Like, you don't know who's supposed to...  But they know that's the caliber of person that walks through.  Right.  So they would have said to us, look, we know it's Radio Row, but you might get Joe Montana  coming through.  You might get...  It's the...  Everyone goes there.  Right.  We absolutely would have gone.  But it wasn't even presented to us.  They offered a possible, hey, we would like you guys to go down. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  We absolutely said yes.  Wasn't even presented to us.  I tell you what, it's also because the sales team probably couldn't get anybody to sponsor  it and pay for it, but the same sales team can't get a beer company on this show.  They do nothing for this show.  There he is.  It's Joe Montana again on Radio Row.  I just saw Jim Rome.  Oh, that's Rome?  He looks different from that.  I apologize.  I like Jim Rome.  Jim Rome.  I take that back immediately.  Radio Row.  Look at all the Super Bowl stuff is all around. 
[00:13:30]  It's exciting.  It's the Super Bowl.  I don't even think the company's embarrassed by us.  I don't even think it gets to that point.  Because we have people around us that can't figure shit out.  Kurt Warner.  Kurt Warner.  Kurt Warner's on Radio Row?  That's right.  Who's that guy?  I don't know who Larry Fitzgerald is.  Larry Fitzgerald.  Holy shit.  All right, well.  Bill Romanowski.  Ron Jaworski.  Yeah, you can see some of them.  Oh, Bill Romanowski.  Oh, look at all the other people down there on Radio Row.  It looks beautiful.  It looks exciting is what it looks like. 
[00:14:00]  There's even plants.  It would have been funny if we didn't get people, too.  I mean, we would have just made it very good.  Oh, yeah.  It would have been fun.  Dan Pastorini.  We'll just sit here and rot for another year or so, right?  Just keep rotting.  Kurt Schilling was down there.  Yes, we heard.  Fuck this place.  So good on it.  Who else was there?  Was Tim Tebow there, too?  Sorry, I'm looking up other radios.  I didn't see that.  Now he gets all, I'm sorry.  I know, but what are you, looking them up while listening to music? 
[00:14:30]  I got another one coming in from Kevin in Albany.  Kevin?  Deacon Jones.  Kevin?  Good morning.  Good morning, Kevin.  On Mike and Mike in the morning this morning, they said that Madonna was on Radio Row with  them yesterday.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, she's going to be singing.  She's doing a halftime festivities.  Oh, wait.  Oh, yeah.  Madonna.  I was about to say she's still important, but I think she is considering she's doing the  halftime show.  I heard that Jay Moore said she looked like Willem Dafoe. 
[00:15:00]  I've been laughing about that for two days.  She looks like, she's starting to look like a Muppet.  She got too much work done.  I don't know what happens with these broads.  A little, a little nip and tuck, just maybe a little work, okay.  But they always go too far.  It's just depressing.  Meaning this situation, not Madonna.  When I, when I was in that meeting last week and just had to hear Radio Row, oh, God.  We didn't even think.  We didn't even think.  We didn't even want to approach you with it.  Approach you with it. 
[00:15:30]  Radio, something, Radio Row.  You guys, really?  It was like, it was like, it was literally, literally this.  Really?  You guys would have, really?  You would have done Radio Row?  Yeah.  Of course.  See, see, no, we didn't even think you'd want to do something like that.  Now, we're just looking at pictures of some of the biggest sports celebrities ever.  Sports?  Now you've got to add Madonna to the list.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And today is Friday, so there'll probably be even more people there today. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was yesterday.  Yeah, that was yesterday.  That was fucking Thursday.  That was the warm-up.  So, so for the people out there that enjoy this, every time you hear Radio Row in the next  day or two, just laugh, knowing that it really hurts us.  I wouldn't be surprised if the likes of Joe Willie Namath shows up on a Friday.  He's got the documentary about him out.  Yes.  And I'm sure, I'm sure he'd probably show up.  Radio Row could have, could have, you know, discussed our fur coats that we both wore back 
[00:16:30]  in the early 70s.  Just fucking ridiculous.  The early 70s when I was a child of the 80s.  It's really hard to defend.  Yeah, yeah, it's impossible to defend.  It's really hard.  It's impossible to defend now.  Really hard.  Right.  There's no way they could come up with anything to tell us that we're not going because.  There's no reason.  They approached us.  We said yes. 
[00:17:00]  They said they were going to work on it.  Right.  And that's that.  And by the way, if anyone thinks a fucking Vegas trip is going together in July, I will  fucking eat your hat with shit in it.  I got a brand new one.  I'd love you to eat this.  Thank you.  My hipster hat.  I will.  We were approached yesterday with an opportunity to go to Vegas for UFC fight in July.  And we said, sure.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  And I and the second it was said, I started laughing to myself. 
[00:17:30]  I didn't say anything in here because obviously I was rushing for the door to get out of here.  But there's no fucking way that will ever come to who we shouldn't.  Let's go to Steve in Indy.  Who was on.  Yes.  He was on Radio Row yesterday.  Oh, Steve.  Yeah.  I'm here working for a local ESPN affiliate in Indy.  And we were on Radio Row all day yesterday.  And it's unbelievable.  These celebrities just walk down the row with their publicist and just hop on a show here 
[00:18:00]  and there.  Hop on this show.  Hop on that show.  All right.  And we would have missed some.  All right.  Why don't you.  Do you remember some of the people you saw?  And I don't want you making up people because this is this is real.  All right.  Yeah.  We had Joe Feisman yesterday.  Oh, Feisman.  Wow.  Might remember him.  Emmett Smith.  Emmett Smith.  That one's for Jimmy.  We had Jerome Bettis.  Jesus.  And then every single ESPN, you know, John Clayton, every big name in sports is there. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  On Radio Row.  Clearly you guys wouldn't want to be there.  Was there any like pop culture people there?  Actors, musicians, that type of thing?  You know, we were really concentrating on the athletes.  But, you know, I mean, like I said, every single big celebrity is there in India right  now.  There is nothing this company could tell me that I will believe.  There's not.  There's nothing.  Nothing.  Why would you guys want to meet them?  Why would you want to be there?  Well, are you saying that you don't think that they would send us anywhere since they  haven't since we've been here? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Why would you guys want to be there?  Sam is laughing because he found proof that, yes, Madonna was hanging out on Radio Row.  Oh, shit.  He created a scene on Radio Row.  We are.  See, we're bigger than Madonna.  I mean, that's what we've got to take away from this.  Yes.  Wow, you're right.  We are bigger than Madonna.  Look at this.  These are the idiots we have to work with.  Look how exciting it looks there.  There's an energy.  I would, safe to say if Radio Row was good enough for Madonna, I think it might have been  good enough for us. 
[00:19:30]  You're a cheerleader.  Dude from ESPN.  The school resides somewhere.  Somewhere in you.  Inside you, right?  In my elbow, yeah.  So you were a cheerleader back in high school?  I was.  I was, and I enjoyed it immensely.  I think it was being a cheerleader that really got the...  Look at all that face work.  She's got poppy, fucking cheeks.  What happened to her accent?  You know the security she must have around her?  Accent?  She's not going to use the accent at the Super Bowl because the Super Bowl is Americana.  Yeah, when she does awards shows, she talks like an English woman. 
[00:20:00]  Yes.  Wow.  Wow.  The Tim Tebow set me off, though.  So congratulations to all the people that were tweeting me that yesterday.  Yes, you got to.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, Tim Tebow had a blast, dude.  Yeah, he had a good time.  He's tweeting all over the place.  Really enjoyed all the interviews today.  Thanks to everybody who invited me on their shows.  If they would have sent us down there, and you put a guy like Roland talking to the publicist,  I said it before, I guarantee you, because I've done Leno stuff, where, look, literally, 
[00:20:30]  there'll be a guy from Leno running out to the publicist and grabbing them.  Like, sometimes they don't just come over.  Right.  You got to have somebody work in the publicist, and you know what?  And he would have been perfect for that.  You'd get people over.  Yeah.  There's absolutely a way to do that, and it would have been fun.  Oh, boy.  It would have been fun to watch everybody walk through.  Let me say hi to Jimmy Massachusetts.  Hi, Ope.  Jim.  Here.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jim.  Guys, I just see this as since the merger slash hostile takeover. 
[00:21:00]  You guys have basically just been suppressed.  It's the Howard Mel Network, and until one or the other is not gone, but changes their mind,  so to speak, it's going to be business as usual, boys.  Sorry for the small room, but it could get smaller.  I mean, you know, we've admitted many times this is Howard's company.  Simple as that.  And everyone else is pretty much shit.  They care about one guy.  That's their business model.  Make sure, you know, Howard is taken care of and brings in the subscribers, and everything  else will follow.  That's their logic, and that's their business plan. 
[00:21:30]  We're not part of that business plan.  But other people got to go.  Yeah.  This is not even...  Well, that's the general feeling of the company.  Yes, this is a different issue, but...  I don't think their working relationship is too great, considering what's happening with  the lawsuit.  I think literally it's just if the company looks at us just like...  Yeah, it doesn't even get to that point.  Yeah.  Because we don't have the right people around us.  They don't even know how to approach the people that make these decisions.  We have an egghead that walks around with a fucking Starbucks cup and makes believe he's 
[00:22:00]  busy.  He doesn't do anything.  What does he do?  Maybe he can borrow...  Maybe he can borrow Jimmy's Sunlamp and be happy.  It's not Jimmy's.  It's all Troy's, sir.  I don't have a Sunlamp.  The Happy Light.  Yeah, we need the Happy Light today.  We have the Happy Light today.  I'll go find out.  I hate the Happy Light.  Troy might have brought it home.  It hurts my eyes.  Yeah.  I know.  I did hate that thing, too.  Oh, God, it's annoying.  You're happy when it gets shut off.  Annoying.  So that's how we start today.  Radio Row is a fucking...  Yeah.  Fucking place to be.  Star-studded.  Star-studded.  Dude, that was...  But that's up to yesterday.  Today's going to be more. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, today's going to be ridiculous.  I cannot wait to hear.  You've got to think everyone was flying in yesterday afternoon, yesterday night.  All the big stars.  They couldn't get a sponsor.  Because, you know, it drives me nuts.  They didn't even get to that point, Jimmy.  That's what I'm trying to say.  They just assumed they're not going to be able to get a sponsor.  That's what I'm trying to say.  I guarantee you...  And, Sam, you're going to ask some questions today.  Ask Gary.  He didn't even fucking look into getting a sponsor to get us to the Super Bowl.  That's the problem.  We don't even get off the ground.  The Opie and Anthony show will not be on Radio Row. 
[00:23:00]  It'll make them big stars.  And then you've got Greenstein, who's distracted by celebrities and shiny things, so he doesn't  even know what's going on around here.  Gets distracted.  Shouldn't he be asking questions like, you know, one of our biggest shows is Opie and  Anthony, because we've heard that.  I don't believe it.  So wouldn't it be his position to go, what's going on with those guys?  Are we going to send them to the Super Bowl?  Are we looking into that?  But he's too busy getting his next celebrity photo or looking at a shiny object. 
[00:23:30]  Well, we should have absolutely been there.  I don't get it.  I don't believe the excuse at all.  Nope.  I don't believe that they were protecting us from Radio Row.  It's incompetence.  No, I don't even think it's incompetence.  I think it's a calculated...  I agree.  ...keeping us from doing it.  And embarrassing the company.  I'm telling you, they just don't have enough faith that we do a good job, but they don't  think the expense is worth it.  That's what you guys think. 
[00:24:00]  I completely disagree.  I think it's way more about incompetence.  But they got other people there.  Yeah, they did get other people there.  Yeah, we got Gary running this channel.  He's a dope.  He doesn't know shit.  Ouch.  Well, it should have went further than him.  And then you got Bladder that assumes Gary knows what he's fucking doing.  And then you got Greenstein assuming that Bladder's taking care of it.  But Bladder has too many responsibilities around here.  Gary's head needs to be fucking chopped off.  We'll start there.  I just don't think they like us. 
[00:24:30]  I agree.  Well, you two will.  But it doesn't mean...  That's fine what you think.  I think another way.  That's all.  It doesn't mean that the incompetence doesn't come into it either.  Because I certainly think the ball is completely dropped.  Oh, yeah.  Like it'll be dropped for, you know...  I just think it's more insidious than that.  Like, it's...  Yeah, they're incompetent.  Yeah, they fuck up in their dumbbells.  But I think it goes deeper than that. 
[00:25:00]  And they just don't want to...  They think they want to, but when it comes down to it...  I bet you...  They just don't want us representing them.  Greenstein has no fucking idea if this was even a possibility.  I will guarantee that.  That there wasn't even discussion with the guy supposedly that oversees programming.  Whether or not to send Opie and Anthony to the Super Bowl.  I guarantee it never got to his desk.  I will bet a lot of money.  I don't know.  For whatever reason.  Too many people here just don't like us. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And I think it was like that before we got here.  To be honest with you.  We should not be sitting here in the middle of winter when half the company's at the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  It's a disgrace.  It's embarrassing for us, too.  Extremely embarrassing.  Yeah, it is.  Wah.  So...  Book Radio is not on Radio Row.  I'll stop it now.  Madonna's arms are very veiny, too.  I don't mind a girl that works out a little bit, but you can't have man arms. 
[00:26:00]  She's 55, though, man.  She looks okay for 55.  Zero body fat.  Yeah.  But those are man arms.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Madge.  How would you know you've never seen him in person?  Huh?  How would you know you've never seen him in person?  Yeah, well...  I've seen him on TV with all those veins popping out of him.  It's not the same.  We would have maybe seen him in person.  You trying to rub it in, Sam?  I forgot she was on Radio Row.  I'm sorry.  Who?  Madonna.  That would be so great, though, if the after show...  I bet you Rosie got her.  ...was on Radio Row. 
[00:26:30]  They sent me down.  Or Madonna might have just done TV, but the bottom line is the fact that she was just  there.  When do people go on Radio Row?  Because it would have sucked if no one went through in the morning.  Yeah, but that's another discussion you have.  Do you move the show to afternoons?  All this shit.  We could have stayed there.  We have our own channel, so it's like, okay, what logically makes sense?  But we don't have any of these discussions.  I'm telling you, Gary walks around with an empty fucking Starbucks coffee cup, making  believe he's drinking coffee, and he's always...  When you see him, you see him walking to these destinations. 
[00:27:00]  Where's he walking to?  Nowhere.  I followed him.  He goes around a corner and waits, and then he makes believe he's got to go somewhere else.  This just in, Jesus Christ just walked down Radio Row.  Wow.  Jesus Christ himself in.  I was complaining there weren't enough radio shows to do.  He wanted one more.  And look at that Marriott. 
[00:27:30]  Who's that?  Who's that toothy zilch?  That's Breeze.  True Breeze.  He looks older.  Jesus.  He looks older there.  No, that's how he always looks.  Wow.  His hairline's a little rough, and he's got that big fucking stain on the side of his face.  He'll probably look the same when he's 60, though.  Yeah, he's one of those guys who looks older when he's 25, and he'll be old in five years.  Can't you get rid of that thing on the side of your face?  I don't know.  I'm going to ask him yourself.  I'm a mole-cutting fool, man. 
[00:28:00]  I think he's got...  What is that?  I get moles cut off all the fucking time.  I got a skin tag I've been lopped off for years.  Just take it off yourself.  For years.  Those you take off yourself.  I don't know how to do it.  I'm afraid if I do it, like, my fucking innards will pour out of my head.  I'm afraid I'll rip it and a big plug of skull will come out.  Oh, God.  I'll do it right now for you.  Nip it off and nail clippers.  No, I can't do it.  Disinfect those scissors.  We'll fucking take care of that skin tag.  No, I can't do it.  We'll just take skin tags off Jimmy instead of interviewing big stars at the Super Bowl. 
[00:28:30]  Big stars.  Yeah, we'll just clip off fucking skin tags.  That's better.  Oh, there you go.  17th year in a row we're officially not at the Super Bowl.  Fucking Jesus.  Kurt Warner with the...  Huh?  Kurt Warner with Kavino and Rich.  Kavino and Rich.  That's good.  Kurt Warner.  What, uh...  Yeah, why would we want that?  Yeah.  It's...  Even people that hate sports are focused on...  It's like...  It's a no-brainer. 
[00:29:00]  And we were asked and we said yes.  And then we got this dummy...  It's all about Gary, sorry.  Gosh.  Because your name is supposedly...  You oversee the channel.  What did you plan for the show to maybe bring us into this whole Super Bowl thing?  What did you plan?  He'll just blame the staff.  Yeah, he'll blame the staff.  The staff gets blamed.  And you're overseeing the staff too, right?  You know, uh...  The guys, they're the ones that gotta come up with some of this stuff so that we can, you  know, take the ball and fucking drop it. 
[00:29:30]  Then don't...  We gotta, you know, pick up the ball and fumble it.  But I go back to our first meeting where I was introduced to the guy as, here's the guy  that could get things done for you guys.  I go back to that conversation over and over again.  He can't do shit.  So how about you fucking quit?  And then we at least know what we got.  The staff gets blamed.  Yes.  Incessantly.  Of course they will.  In meetings that we get in.  Every meeting we're in, the staff, you guys get blamed for everything.  It's hilarious.  Oh.  I sit there and listen to like, all right. 
[00:30:00]  Because they gotta cover up their incompetence.  Yeah, this guy didn't do anything.  This guy...  And it's like, well, you know what?  Your guys gotta come to the table more.  They're the ones that gotta, you know, step it up.  It's like, no.  Well, if this guy's in charge, he's in charge of the staff.  And...  I don't know.  There really is no way to spin it.  When they come to us and say, do you want to go to the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  We said, yes, absolutely.  It wasn't even a maybe.  This was a definite...  We could be difficult. 
[00:30:30]  This was not a difficult one.  This was an absolute yes.  We were like, we couldn't say yes fast enough.  We want to go.  And it was incompetence and an indifference.  It's a combination of things.  I guarantee you, sales couldn't get anybody.  That was a part of it.  There was no creative ideas.  That was a part of it.  And it's just not a priority.  And that was a part of it.  And they'll say no to all that stuff.  Right.  They'll say no, it's just the show.  But it's not.  I asked just this to the dummies on Twitter.  This guy, DukeCGS67, he goes, serious? 
[00:31:00]  Seriously, Opie, do you think Howard is behind how the company is treating you?  No.  That's not what I said.  No.  Their business plan is all about Howard.  That's how they want to run their company.  And that's their right.  They can run this company any way they want.  I truly don't believe Howard cares that much that he's preventing us from doing all these things that we don't do.  The one thing I do know, Howard prevented us from going back on Letterman.  That is a fact.  And that's all I'll say.  I don't know about anything else. 
[00:31:30]  And I would bet a lot of money that he doesn't give a shit enough to prevent us from doing all this shit.  No.  It's incompetence.  Please listen.  Please.  Fast and Furious today on Radio Row.  There it is.  Boy, a lot of articles coming out.  You know who that guy is?  Who?  That's Joe Montana.  Joe Montana.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Good.  So he's really making the rounds.  So it wasn't even like they'd...  Sometimes they bring in a big star just to do one particular show and get him the fuck out of there. 
[00:32:00]  But, you see, if the company looked at us a certain way, because they have NFL radio,  they have probably a decent amount of connections, more than the average sports channel does,  because they broadcast everything from the NFL.  They absolutely have the connections to have gotten us a decent spot, to have helped us get people if they wanted to.  They're actually seeing the Covino and Rich photo that that show is positioned directly next to NFL radio.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Like, then there's NFL radio. 
[00:32:30]  And that was a calculated move.  Like, they would want another show next to NFL radio.  Well, that's how I've gotten everybody there.  That means they...  Yeah.  But it's not...  That's smart.  They're getting everybody.  That means they're getting a bunch of people they probably wouldn't normally get if they were, like, on the other side of the room.  Yeah.  It's almost like, yeah, what the hell?  You're right here, too?  Okay, we'll do your show.  Oh, my God.  But instead, we have absolutely nothing.  We got a couple news clips, and that's it.  Supposedly, we're this big radio show for SiriusXM.  Why don't we tie into Covino and Rich's show? 
[00:33:00]  It'll be like we're almost there.  Simulcast?  We'll just simulcast it.  Oh, look at that.  Look how exciting.  I mean, Sway comes on at 8.  We could put Sway's show on.  Of course it comes on at 8.  We need VCO on radio.  Yeah, we could just play him.  Yeah.  And maybe we could pretend we're asking the questions.  Like, we could hear the interview first.  There's Michael Irvin, by the way.  And then we could pretend that we're asking the questions.  Yeah.  Like, what would it be like?  That's a good idea.  Who do you want to interview? 
[00:33:30]  Tebow?  I would love to talk to Tim Tebow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Joe Montana clips would be good for the show, too.  No, I really want to talk to Joe.  Let's say hi to Brian in Kentucky.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mayor.  Hey, Sirius McPhilm sent me an email to fill out a thing to win Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Mm-hmm.  And after that, they asked me a survey of which channels I like.  And Howard Stern was on there.  But there was no opening to Anthony anywhere on that list. 
[00:34:00]  Anywhere.  Could you forward the email to, I don't know who.  Can I?  I would love to take your word for it, but I want to see it.  Yeah.  Could you hold our line and you could, like, forward it to one of our accounts?  So he's saying that there's a survey and you could pretty much click or, you know, fucking  mark off where, what shows you listen to.  And we weren't on there.  Right.  Department-wise.  Because, like, they separate it.  There's comedy, entertainment, sports.  Right.  Howard Stern.  Lump us in. 
[00:34:30]  Like, Howard Stern is its own category.  Well, yeah.  And that's, again, that's because they want him out, you know, front and center.  But he also has a smart agent who knows to separate himself.  And, you know, I do like Bob, but, God damn it, he's got to be on stuff like this and  go, why aren't the guys being featured in the, you know, that's agent shit.  In their talk, it was Howard Stern and then Trucker Radio and all that stuff.  Yeah.  But I looked at all the categories and I didn't see opening Anthony anywhere on the track.  I bet you they were in there and you missed it, dude.  But, I mean, that's how easy it is to miss because of the way it's just kind of stuck in 
[00:35:00]  there.  Yeah.  With everybody else.  All right.  Thanks.  Well, send the email because I want to see it now.  Yeah, E-Rock, can you get his info?  Or someone tweeted to me because I'm sure other people got it.  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  All right, buddy.  That would have been fun.  It's like a load of laughs over there.  And when we had the meeting, it was like there was nothing we could say.  We're like, oh, radio.  Okay, so it looks like it's just a bunch of dumb radio shows, like, hoping they could 
[00:35:30]  get maybe someone almost famous.  And then as the week went on, just showing you how this progressed, we just started  to hear more and more chatter about this Radio Row.  And instead of just hearing Radio Row and them going, oh, oh, oh, why didn't they, like,  do a little research, see who was going to be there?  Here's Joe.  Here's Joe.  Yeah.  Wow.  Fucking.  Arguably the greatest quarterback of all time.  He had a pretty good Super Bowl run.  Jerry Rice.  I don't like Tim Tebow. 
[00:36:00]  Is that Tebow and Jerry Rice?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wow.  What?  Watch closely.  This is like a Zapruder film.  Yeah.  When they pan through it, when they hit Tim Tebow, the Sirius XM banner is right there.  Of course.  Oh, God.  Of course.  Why would we want to talk to Tim Tebow?  That's stupid.  Right there.  Oh, God.  Right behind him.  And Joe Montana is right next to Tim Tebow.  Well, they zoomed out of Tim Tebow to focus on Joe Montana, so they were there at the same  time, making the rounds.  Next to Sirius XM.  There's all sorts of TV cameras. 
[00:36:30]  Amazing.  Sirius XM right there.  Yeah, they were right in the heart of things.  Sirius XM has a huge presence on Radio Row.  It's good for the company.  Yeah, whatever.  Is it good for the company?  That's what you've got to remember.  Are management people here down there?  What?  I don't know.  Is that there?  Of course he is.  He's got to get more fucking pictures.  Yeah.  There's plenty of shiny things to look at down there. 
[00:37:00]  My God, man.  My God.  But we'll have to have another meeting with that idiot, and he'll have to say, I got it,  I got it, I got it, I got it another million fucking times.  What can I do for you guys?  And then we'll lay out what he needs to do for us, and then nothing fucking happens again.  Meetings are stupid.  I don't want to go to any meetings.  Oh, well, we avoid his office now, because nothing gets accomplished there.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:30]  Is that true?  What?  D.B. Cooper was seen at Radio Row.  D.B. Cooper?  They found him?  Damn it!  Signing autographs, taking pictures.  President Obama?  Oh, God.  Right?  Yeah, but he was only doing shock jocks.  Oh, this is terrible.  My God.  You know how much press we would have gotten if we had gotten D.B. Cooper?  Yeah, everyone's saying.  Not as much as Tebow.  I'm getting a lot of people saying that email they got, that they didn't even see our names  at all. 
[00:38:00]  And this one guy goes, I didn't even bother filling it out.  Because, you know, this guy doing happy hour on Twitter, he's a fan of our show.  That's good, so that when they have to...  Contracts come up, and they want to see who listens, right.  And who listens, and how many fucking subscribers are based on shows, we're not even in there.  But they could say, you know, well, Howard got a lot of subs on there.  You know, well, when you put the survey out...  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Oh, this place.  Oh, this place. 
[00:38:30]  Good gosh.  It's going to be so different this time around.  Oh, jeez.  It says there was madness at Super Bowls Radio Row.  Madness.  Why madness?  The word Radio Row is everywhere.  It's like, it's the fucking catchphrase.  This actually starts with, madness is the norm on Radio Row.  Ah, wow.  Why would we want to be there?  Thank you so much for protecting us. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, wow.  Morning hosts from 102.5 The Game in Nashville were there.  Right away from 104.3 The Fan in Denver.  Well, Bill, all you have to do is put Radio Row on Twitter and you can play along at home.  Bill Romanowski, that guy, he writes, last day on Radio Row, breaking off a trip to ESPN, Colin, around noon.  Yeah, we might have had to go in the afternoon to do interviews to play. 
[00:39:30]  It's fine.  Yeah, but I'm saying it would have been a fun...  Oh, yeah.  But once again, we don't even have that discussion.  Just tape a show in the afternoon and play it in the morning.  Whatever.  It just would have been a fun...  Literally, the last fucking thing we heard about the Super Bowl was when they asked us if we wanted to go to the Super Bowl.  And we said yes.  That was the last we heard about the Super Bowl.  Boomer and Carton are down there.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  And they tweeted just a million people they talked to. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, great.  On their Twitter.  Oh, Warren Sapp.  Oh.  I'll take war.  I didn't say or.  It's an in.  Oh, okay.  It makes sense.  You nudged.  You got the chip nudge.  It's an or in, say, Kenny?  Look, you know what?  I'm going to say this.  Gary, you're a really nice guy.  I do like you as a person.  But you've got to step down.  Oh, jeez.  You really have to.  Are you calling for his resignation?  Yeah, absolutely.  I am today.  He's got to step down. 
[00:40:30]  Nothing personal.  I like you.  And I think you're probably good at radio.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But you're not good at this.  This is a deal breaker.  I can't work with you anymore.  It's got to start somewhere.  We didn't.  Please resign today.  I beg you.  Please.  Nothing personal.  You could probably run a music channel around here and do a good job with it.  But you're way over your head with this.  We didn't think you'd want to go. 
[00:41:00]  Cam Newton's going to be there.  That's like a girl saying, like, I'd love to suck your dick.  And you go, sure.  And then you find out she's been blowing your friends.  And then she's like, well, you know what?  And the black guy across the street.  Oh, yeah.  And then she's like, well, you know what?  I was only going to let you come on my tits.  So I didn't think you'd want that.  Yeah.  You probably wouldn't have wanted it.  What?  Why didn't you let me say no?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  That's not the truth.  Yes. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  We weren't on that survey for whatever reason.  They'll have a good reason why we weren't.  They always have a reason why something's not happening.  Because why would you want to be?  Well, no.  Oh, see, this survey is meant for just the separate various formats, which you're in.  You're included in the talk format or the comedy.  Who knows?  But, see, you don't get the separate thing.  Oh, really?  Blah-dee-blah-blah.  More fucking...  More bullshit. 
[00:42:00]  This place is hilarious.  Supposedly we are in the survey.  It comes up in a different area.  What?  Yeah, it's probably in there somewhere, but buried...  Scott, what do you got, buddy?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, Scott.  I did the same thing for the Motley Crue survey thing.  Howard has a separate box, but if you put the cursor over, like, talk or gossip or something  like that, you'll see another little box that pops up and says Opie and Anthony in it. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Well, we're in it, then.  That's good.  Got to put your cursor over it.  Come on.  Come on.  Well, it's probably in the genre.  If you have an invisible ink pen, scratch it.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I like Daryl Hammond's book, by the way, Jimmy.  Isn't it great?  Not to change the subject.  There's no mom shit in there.  Oh, yeah, there is.  Is it later?  Yeah.  He doesn't start with it.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm 50 pages in.  Yeah.  He's talking about his career.  I'm up to the point where he moves to New York.  He's talking about his career, and he, page one, where he talks about trying to cut his 
[00:43:00]  arm off with a kitchen knife.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That was nuts.  Well, the best, that, you know, that's how you start a book, though, because I'm like,  do I really want to read this?  You know, for many reasons.  Nothing against Daryl Hammond.  Sure.  I can't wait to meet him.  And, yeah, it opens up with him talking about how he's almost cut his arm off.  I'm like, all right, I'm hooked.  Yeah.  His father was crazy.  Yeah, Daryl's nutty.  His father was, he talked about his father up front.  Yeah.  My father.  His father basically came back from the war broken in. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And we've talked about that over the years.  Yeah.  His father came back broken.  Regular guy, and then they come back from the big one.  Was he in the big one?  World War II or Korea.  And Korea.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think he did it in both, I think.  How do you leave a war like World War II and then go like, ah, yeah.  And then I've learned Daryl Hammond was a really good baseball player.  I didn't know that either.  And, you know, he started drinking at 14 or 15 and it might have fucked up his skills.  But it sounded like he was pretty damn good.  Yeah.  He wanted to play major league baseball. 
[00:44:00]  And then got, you know, off track with maybe some of the other shit going on.  It's funny.  I've known Daryl for so many years.  And when you, knowing him, he's very, very mellow a lot of times when you talk to him.  And it seems like he's a nice dude, but he's like.  Comes off as aloof?  No.  No?  Yeah.  Maybe just like, um, like he's really quiet and still.  And after reading the book, I was like, oh my God, I understand something about him that I never fucking knew.  He was on lithium.  It was, but I was about his mom. 
[00:44:30]  He said that you just didn't want to upset her.  Right.  So you kept it even.  Wow.  Nothing too high.  Nothing too low.  Nothing to set her off.  Yeah.  Wow.  I, uh, I've, I've run into Daryl Hammond a million times, a million times.  I've been living in New York off and on for what, 10 years now.  I've never said hi to him because he's so not approachable.  Yeah.  He doesn't seem like he would.  He even works out of my gym and I've seen him just being him.  And I'm like, I'm not going to go up and say hi.  Would love to ask him about that. 
[00:45:00]  And he's a really nice dude.  I mean, he's a genuinely nice guy.  He's not, he's not at all a prick.  He's a low self-esteem comic like, like the rest of the, you know what I mean?  He's liked all of us.  Oh yeah.  I don't think he's got some massive ego.  And that prevents people from talking to him.  Yeah.  He's just, there's just something else going on in there.  He's hard to read.  And when I read that sentence, I was like, oh my fucking God.  What's cutting off his arm?  No, about not upsetting her and not the highs or the lows too much.  Just needed.  That's later on in the book?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a cutter though, huh?  Oh yeah.  Because he talked about a little of that early on in the book. 
[00:45:30]  Talked about slicing his arm before he went out on stage on SNL because he couldn't remember  his lines and just fucking give him an even keel.  It's like, oof.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I forget what impression he was going on.  Wow.  He had to put gauze on a bleeding arm and then put his suit on and go out and do an impression  and put on his Clinton suit or something.  No, it might have been Al Gore.  Al Gore?  Yeah.  It might have been the Gore.  Wow.  I don't remember.  That rocks.  I mean, that's awful.  Wow, that's fucked up.  I know. 
[00:46:00]  And there you are.  You're watching this fun show and you have no idea what's going on behind the scenes.  What just happened?  He's slicing his arm to get his mind right.  Damn.  I can't wait to talk to him.  Yeah.  I'm all in though.  I'll finish that book by Monday.  No problem.  Yeah, I'll definitely be done by then.  It's a quick read and it's a good read so far.  Because he's not like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah about, you know, it takes  forever to get to the age of five.  I hate those books.  And then, you know, when I was six, they moved us to, oh my God, just fucking get on  with it already.  Get to the interesting stuff. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, please.  All right.  You want to regroup?  Yeah, we got some food here.  I guess we still got to do a show, huh?  Well, we're professionals.  Interesting story out of Philly we can talk about when we come back.  Hate crime not charged.  Oh, of course.  We can do that.  Why would it be?  But we're just paranoid, right?  Yes, we are.  We could do that.  And we, I got a take on the whole Donald Trump thing.  Well, the Donald's endorsement.  I had Ant laughing a bit before the show.  Because he reminds us of someone else we know. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Well, we'll explain next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  And the sky was made of images.  And all the stars are just like little fish.  And all the stars are just like little fish.  You should learn when to go.  You should learn how to think, no. 
[00:47:30]  You should learn how to think, no.  My last day.  Mine is forever.  Mine is forever.  I won't have to think, yeah.  Mine is forever.  They get what they want.  They never want it again. 
[00:48:00]  They get what they want.  Get in topical with the sex man.  Can I start with the theory I've had for many, many years?  Oh, this Courtney Love is not a nice person whatsoever, right?  Right.  Some people even think that she might have offed Kurt Cobain.  I don't know.  It's been a rumor.  I'm a huge Nirvana fan.  So you've got Kurt Cobain who dies and leaves behind a shitload of unfinished songs and 
[00:48:30]  cassettes and lyrics and whatnot.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, Courtney Love comes out with this song and a few other songs that  sound very much like something Nirvana might have done.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, that has been a rumor.  And I've said it over the years, but it never gets legs, this rumor.  But if you listen to this song, you could hear Kurt Cobain screaming this. 
[00:49:00]  Well, this album came out like a week after he died.  Yeah.  But yeah, it's been a rumor for a long time that he had a lot to do with this album.  And it's their best album.  Right.  It's a great fucking album.  Yeah.  There's something going on there.  I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote.  Obviously, there's a Kurt Cobain influence here, but I'm wondering if.  Apparently, he wrote Penny Royalty and he offered it to her.  Right.  And she didn't take it, so he just put it on a new era.  Because now that he's been gone a while, you know, she's gone away musically.  Yeah.  She needed some new shit.  Well, she went through his boxes and his cassette tapes, found the best stuff, and then, you 
[00:49:30]  know, that's it.  Well, like Billy Corgan wrote Half a Celebrity Skin.  Right.  And then her solo album was written mostly by.  Yeah, but I'm suspicious of Billy Corgan.  I know he's a bright and clever guy himself, but was he going through the boxes, too, with  Corgan?  I don't think there's any boxes that you're talking about.  I think we've heard almost every Nirvana song.  And if you read anything about Kurt, he had a lot of shit on cassette tapes.  Yeah, but I think he was pulling around and stuff. 
[00:50:00]  There's so many bootlegs out there.  Yeah.  Like, at this point, it's very rare to hear a Nirvana song that hasn't been out there somewhere.  More importantly, good morning, sexy.  Hi.  Good morning.  Why is your mic so low?  I just moved it over.  Oh.  So you're playing this?  Are we getting topical?  Sure.  I saw Ant looking at everything he can to try to figure it out.  I was looking.  I'm like, what could this be?  See, it's fun, right?  Then I realized I really don't even give a shit anymore.  Thank you. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah, right.  What is it?  I would assume you're going with the whole, go ahead, take everything.  Right?  What?  Don't give it away.  I mean, it's easy.  It's easy when he has the sheet in front of him.  Everybody has the sheet in front of him.  Yeah, that's what makes it easy.  Francis Bean claims Courtney Love killed the family pets with her behavior.  Oh.  I actually read that today in the paper.  Wow.  Yeah, Francis Bean basically got a divorce.  What is it called when it's a kid doing it? 
[00:51:00]  I forget.  Oh, yeah, they get their emancipation proclamation.  Yeah, Francis Bean did that to Courtney Love.  Yeah.  Basically got a divorce from her mother.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  When she was like 17.  Now she's 19 and she's dating a rock guy.  Engaged.  Engaged.  The lead singer of a band called...  I want to go with the Rumbles, the Rambles, the...  What?  Is she pretty?  She looks just like Kurt.  It's creepy. 
[00:51:30]  She has the exact same eyes as Kurt Cobain.  Those pictures we looked at a couple months ago were pretty good, though.  Yeah.  She's a bit chubby.  Yeah.  These are all...  She's a little chubster, but her eyes are Kurt's.  Yeah.  I mean, it's Kurt's face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy.  She's dating that guy.  You just had it.  What a guy.  That guy.  Who's that guy?  And he looks sort of like Kurt, they're saying.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  He's the lead singer of who?  No, that's Dalton. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, Sam.  You had it.  What was the guy's name?  Sam is so bad at this.  I'm looking at pictures.  No, I said, who's the guy, though?  Yeah, Sam.  You wanted to look at pictures.  Yes, I did.  You're confusing everybody.  I'm not confusing anybody.  Ashaya Silva?  Is that how you say his name?  No, it's Anderson.  What band does he sing for?  The Rambles.  Oh, it is.  All right.  A band called The Rambles.  The Rambles. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, so, Francis Bean claims Courtney Love killed the family pets with her behavior.  Supposedly, the dog died because it got into her pills.  Oh, well, that'll do it.  And a cat died because it got into a box that's filled with fabrics and stuff.  How does that kill him?  And somehow got tangled among these fabrics.  And choked?  I guess, yeah.  Wow.  That's brutal.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Eric said.  Well, that's her.  Eric said the guy's name is Ashaya.  It's Isaiah.  It's just spelled.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:53:00]  Ashaya?  B-Rock tries.  Get a normal name.  Is that Francis Bean?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  When was that taken?  Recently.  She looks like Mexican jumping.  Ah, Chip.  Bean.  So she lost the chub.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, her face is a little more chiseled than that, than that big, round fucking pan face  she had.  Jeff is saying Cordy wrote all of Kurt's music.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, yeah.  That happened.  Shut up.  I hate Cordy.  I hate her. 
[00:53:30]  I love her.  You don't love her.  She's a cunt.  You love her, really?  She's a fucking attention whore.  I was so obsessed with her.  Why?  I don't know.  You might want to fuck her, but she's an attention whore.  Look at the Comedy Central roast, just always making it about herself.  Oh, she's insane.  I know that.  Just a fucking baby.  Just an attention whore.  We get it.  You're high.  Fuck yourself.  Whoa, she can't even talk.  She's so fucked up. 
[00:54:00]  It's great, right?  Thanks.  That's so cool.  I like her voice.  Yeah.  I don't like her personality.  I'm not saying she's not a good singer.  I don't know her stuff.  Is that her?  No, it's Frances.  Oh, Frances Bean.  I know.  It's a wonderful flavor from Storch.  I'm the Frances Bean coffee.  The problem with looking at pictures of Frances Bean, it looks like Kurt Cobain in drag.  Does that look like Kurt?  I don't even know what Kurt's face looks like.  The eyes are pretty much the same.  And now that she's lost a little weight, that looks...  She's not there.  No.  Wow, she's beautiful.  She looks like Scarlett Johansson there. 
[00:54:30]  I never thought of her as beautiful, but in that picture, wow.  Maybe a little Photoshop, the lighting.  She looks like she's peeking around the corner going, who?  Hello.  Who's that?  Who are you?  Wow, let me see the fat redhead up there.  Oh, my goodness.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was chubby for a little while.  That's terrible.  She got rid of the chub.  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  She's got many looks.  Yeah.  Most of them are awful.  She went through those awkward years.  The one with the really dark hair and the dark makeup, though, that looks like Kurt and 
[00:55:00]  drag.  Show me the chubby picture.  In the book, Who Killed Kurt Cobain?  It's stated that he wrote most of the songs on that album.  Is that Ian Halpern's book?  Yeah, Ian Halpern.  Oh, God.  What did happen to Ian Halpern?  What did happen?  Is he putting on movies?  Yeah, he's working on a Lady Gaga movie right now.  Oh, it comes out.  He tweeted that it comes out at nine o'clock on Super Bowl Sunday, which is good because  no one watches the fourth quarter.  Yeah.  So everyone will tune in to his Lady Gaga movie. 
[00:55:30]  I'm pissed because he told me I was going to be in it.  Well, you're not.  He never called me.  Because it comes out in two days.  He told me I was going to be in his Lady Gaga movie.  And what happened there?  He never called me.  Why?  I don't know.  I thought he wasn't lying.  But apparently, he shockingly didn't tell the truth.  Shockingly.  Do you find it hard to believe that he fibbed?  Yes, I find it very hard to believe.  He's a journalist.  What?  All right.  Donald Trump.  Yes.  You want to talk about someone making it all about himself? 
[00:56:00]  Well, Donald Trump made it all about himself yesterday.  Yeah, the Donald boy, everybody on the edge of their seats, seeing who he wanted to, was  going to endorse for the Republican candidate.  Poor Mitt Romney has to make believe it's a good thing.  Oh, man.  I don't think it's an awful thing, but.  But who cares who he endorses or anybody?  I know.  Why do we care about endorsements?  I like him.  Well, I like him, too.  Now I can like him.  And endorsements are valueless.  They're dumb, yeah.  But it's a thing a lot of famous people do, but the problem with Donald Trump, he held 
[00:56:30]  a press conference, they had to get a podium, they had to get Mitt Romney there.  Most people just send out a tweet or something, you know?  Why would Mitt Romney show up for that?  I know.  That's what a lot of people are saying.  This is not a good thing for him to do.  Because Mitt Romney's clueless.  Now it ties him to everything Donald Trump said and says in the future.  A lot of people are saying, you know, Donald Trump has been known to say some off-the-wall  shit.  Right.  And when you have pictures and video of you shaking his hand at this endorsement speech 
[00:57:00]  that he gave, yeah, most people just say, yeah, I'm backing this guy.  The candidate doesn't actually show up for the endorsement.  Right.  This was over-the-top stuff.  Well, that's Donald Trump.  That's how he lives his life.  Yeah.  Everything has to be over-the-top.  Over-the-top.  The Donald.  And he doesn't understand what this does.  Yeah.  And some people would probably rather that he did it low-key.  Just say, I'd like to see this guy in and leave it at that. 
[00:57:30]  Here's how it went down.  It's my honor, real honor, and privilege to endorse Mitt Romney.  Endorse.  I've gotten...  And, by the way, this is a great couple.  You look at this couple.  But...  Oh, God.  Mitt is tough.  He's smart.  He's sharp.  He's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love.  So, Governor Romney, go out and get him. 
[00:58:00]  You can do it.  See, now the campaign officially started because Donald Trump finally said it's time to start.  Endorsements are valueless.  And for Mitt Romney to show up just for Donald Trump to go, hey, you're terrific.  What are you doing, Mitt?  It's stupid.  Yeah.  It's like he's showing up at, you know...  I don't care about the real poor.  And then he shows up at Trump.  What a dunce.  Shows how weak Newt Gingrich is, though.  That Newt can't capitalize on all this stuff.  Fucking fat, Lego-headed blowhard. 
[00:58:30]  You can't capitalize.  Oh, he's a cunt, too.  Mitt is stumbling and tripping all over the place, and Newt Gingrich can't fucking capitalize.  Who pointed out that Ron Paul's suit's never fit?  That made me laugh.  There was someone on the show.  It was, uh...  I don't remember.  He's too fucking frail.  Ron?  Yeah.  I know.  He's just like a frail guy in a suit that's too big.  Just an old doctor.  Yeah.  An old gyno.  Trying to get his message out.  I think so, right?  He must have seen a lot of...  Pussy!  He sure did, yeah. 
[00:59:00]  He's a lot different than most of the candidates.  He's not a gooky god or...  No.  ...candidate.  Yeah.  That's one thing to get two catch faces in there.  A groin ecologist, right?  Yep.  O-B-G-Y-N.  He fucking has his fingers in a lot of pussy, didn't he?  Yeah, I wanted to sniff his hand.  Nothing but pussy juice on his knuckles.  Hey, Doc.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, it just comes off as very self-serving for Donald. 
[00:59:30]  Because he made it this huge event, whereas most people just say, yeah, I'm going for this guy.  And then, why did Romney show up at this?  Because he's a dummy.  Yeah, I don't think Romney's smart on that level.  But he's got people.  Doesn't he have people?  Romney's not street smart, whatsoever.  I think he's led a kind of a sheltered life, maybe.  That whole Mormon thing, and then the wealth factor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  I just can't wait until there's just, you know, it's going to be Romney.  You know, Romney and Obama.  And let him just start pounding on each other there, instead of having to worry about Republican  against Republicans.  That's what I want to say.  I want to see who he picks as a running man.  I'm very curious.  That's a biggie.  He couldn't make a bigger mistake than McCain made.  That was a tremendous blunder.  Yeah, yeah.  Santorum is positioning himself.  He wants it better.  Is he?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's not even, he knows he doesn't have a shot. 
[01:00:30]  He's staying in the race just to keep his face in it.  He really wants to be the VP.  I have such a hatred for him.  Yeah.  I fucking hate him.  Why?  Just because he's one of those guys who's really vocal about being against gay marriage.  And it's like, I just hate, I hate when these fucking religious assholes try to impose  their will on everybody else.  It makes me nuts.  On you.  No, I don't want to get married, and I'm happy to jerk each other off.  But no, it just, it fucking annoys me beyond belief. 
[01:01:00]  It really is, you know.  I fancy myself a Republican.  I'm a Republican, and I don't care if gays get married.  Why the fuck would I give a shit?  You're a fiscal and crime conservative, which I am in a lot of ways, too.  Yes.  But I don't like this fucking, this moralizing.  They lose me every time with that shit.  I don't like that.  I don't like that at all.  And it's pretty much tied to the Republican Party, this fucking pseudo-conservative morality  bullshit that they try to pump out every year. 
[01:01:30]  Less government.  Less government in your life.  Except where you're sticking your dick in what you do.  We'd love to know about that.  And we'd love to say what you can do and can't do.  Isn't that amazing?  We'd love to say what you can jerk off to and what you can film and sell.  Fucking cocksuckers.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, yeah.  Less government.  Less government.  But then they have something that's kind of fucking vague as community standards with pornography.  Nobody, I'm telling you, porn is a big thing.  It's a big freedom issue. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm not saying that as a pervert.  Nobody, not one politician ever defends it.  Well, it's tough to.  It's very tough to.  Yeah, it's one of those things.  As a politician in that world, it's tough to.  Community standards.  Max Hardcore went to jail.  I'm obsessed with Max Hardcore going to jail for four fucking years doing adult stuff with other adults.  He spent four years in prison.  The government seized everything.  And these phony, this is why I attack you civil libertarians, because I think most of you have fucking frauds.  Where were you when fucking John Stalliano, who we had in here, was fucking, they were going to put him on trial and he spent a million dollars in legal fees. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Where were you motherfuckers?  Because he contributed a lot of money to some, one of those kind of libertarian think tanks.  And they left him hanging.  One of those civil liberty think tanks left him fucking hanging.  So it's all you people that complain about airport security.  That's why I think you're frauds.  Because you don't stick up for a guy like that or a guy like Max, who truly was doing something that free speech should protect. 
[01:03:00]  And none of you fucking marched.  None of you complained.  But boy, someone wants to frisk you because they're afraid someone's going to go on a plane with an underwear bomb and your civil liberties are violated.  Yeah.  Fuck yourself.  The epitome of freedom of speech is what happened to Max Hardcore.  I mean, he should be able to distribute that without the threat of going to jail and then going to jail.  Four years, man.  Four years?  Because it was like weird shit, like speculative.  It was all adults, too.  There was no minors. 
[01:03:30]  Nobody underage was filmed.  Nobody was filmed under duress.  So how does that constitute a crime?  Oh, they got him good.  It's with the mail.  They get it with the fucking mail.  They get you to mail it someplace like Tampa, and it's your responsibility to know what their community standards are with piss in the mouth and stuff like that.  That's what it has gotten to.  How are there laws against what is filmed and what can be bought and watched in your own home and the privacy of your own home?  Why should anyone have a say over that? 
[01:04:00]  I don't know. It's the same shitbags like Rick Santorum that want to tell you who you can marry, and they want to, you know, and it's like, I know I sound like a flaming liberal, but with this stuff, I guess I am a faggot.  No, no, no, no. Max only filmed straight porn.  Oh, sorry.  This guy thinks it's going to be Newt Romney. That's impossible.  No, I don't think so.  Oscar.  There's been too much duking it out between the two.  Oscar, that's impossible.  No, you need to accept that that's going to be your ticket.  It's going to be, that's number one and two. 
[01:04:30]  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.  I think you're wrong, Oscar.  I think you're completely wrong.  I think there's someone just waiting in the wings that we haven't even fucking thought about.  Well, look, here's the thing.  If you right wingers, I shouldn't say you right wingers, but you're looking for your fantasy sports team, the best quarterback to run the team.  The guy that you can say, okay, this is the guy that's going to take it in for us in the fourth quarter.  You want the guy to get behind.  Sir, please, stop.  I'm going to listen to you, but not the football analogy. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, we're not in the mood for football analogies.  Please.  Do you understand?  We all just start cringing.  We don't want to even think about football.  We don't want a guy who's going to march us down the field and go to Al-Qaeda.  Right.  We're not on Radio Row, so we really don't want the football analogies.  It's going to set us off, and we're going to do another hour.  Go ahead, Oscar.  No sports.  You want the winner, and you want a clear indication that he is going to be the winner before you put your chips in the pot.  What's that?  And that's the only thing that matters. 
[01:05:30]  Here's my dumb two cents, and I don't know a lot about politics.  I'll be the first to admit that.  This campaign is really ugly.  Uglier than it has been in past years.  Everyone is saying that this is one of the ugliest ones they've ever seen,  and I don't think they're going to be able to patch that shit up and work together in time for an election.  Yeah, but Opie, ugly cells.  We are a people of reality TV. 
[01:06:00]  The ugliest, most ridiculous, most outrageous one that gets the most attention is the one that wins the game.  We'll have to wait and see.  You're saying Newt Romney, or Romney Newt, I guess it would be officially, right?  Like in Gladiator, win the crowd, and you'll win the freedom.  Sir, you've really got to stop with these horrible, horrible things.  It wasn't a football analogy, though.  I know, but Gladiator is even more dramatic.  Yeah, that's very dramatic.  It's like a clockwork orange when Mr. Deltoid says, I'm the one man who wants to save you from yourself. 
[01:06:30]  He's just tying in movie quotes, and I love movie quotes.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, by the way, I've got a great movie for you guys.  What?  It's the modern Maximus.  What's that?  We love Gladiator because Maximus is the ultimate man.  We all want to be like him, man of few words, man of action.  Drive.  Ryan Godwin.  I love this guy.  I hate this guy.  I fucking love this guy.  Call every day, please.  Have you seen Drive?  Yes.  Yes.  Isn't that the scene where it...  Yes.  Amazing.  I got a really good tweet from Duck203. 
[01:07:00]  Confirmed.  Paterno's corpse rolling around Radio Row.  Library allows man to watch graphic material.  Triple X.  What library?  Seattle?  Because the guy wanted to watch his fucking porn in the library, and the library said, all right.  But that's something I can kind of understand.  I'm saying in a public domain.  Right.  But in the privacy of your own home, man?  Yeah, you should be able to watch whatever the fuck you want.  Holy shit.  Guys, more analogies coming in.  I think it's all about the analogy. 
[01:07:30]  Rick in Michigan.  Rick.  Rick.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I think the perfect analogy would have to be Romney as fucking Gotti, and Gingrich as fucking  send me the bull.  You know, because Romney has to be all nice and proper and, you know, be the nice guy.  And Gingrich is just a fucking asshole who goes and fucks people up.  I don't like that one.  I like that analogy, too.  You call back as well.  Oh, please.  I like these analogies.  No, you mean Romney is like Skip Stevenson. 
[01:08:00]  And Newt Gingrich is like Sarah Purcell.  If this was real people, because we're a people who like real people.  Oh, my God.  A real people reference.  How many people even remember real people?  Real people.  Being a child of the 80s, Sam, I remember real people.  You remember it, I'm sure, but you weren't a child.  I certainly was.  Who else is on?  Fran talking to us on That's Incredible, right?  And he's also on Radio Row.  Yes, he is.  And it's also his birthday today.  Of course.  72.  It's so weird you're mentioning him today.  We saw Fran down in Atlanta with two babies. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Two chicks.  A couple chicks at a steak joint.  I don't know what he was doing with the chicks.  Maybe it was his daughters.  Real people.  Boy, that shit was a giant hit.  Speaking of the election.  It was the 70s, wasn't it?  Proving that the media is a complete waste of time, mainstream media.  As you guys were talking, I was looking at CNN behind Ant over there.  And they're all about Roseanne Barr is now running for president.  And they're wasting valuable news time to present this as a real possibility. 
[01:09:00]  Why would they do that?  Why even acknowledge that?  Well, I don't have a problem with them acknowledging it.  Because it is newsworthy.  But it's just how they present it.  Like it's a real possibility.  Instead of going, look at this idiot.  She's running for president because she wants attention.  They go, Roseanne Barr, another candidate throwing their hat in the arena.  Roseanne Barr running for president. 
[01:09:30]  Big star.  It's newsworthy, yes.  But how they present it.  It's just stupid.  Call her out on it.  And tell the people why she's doing it.  What is she doing?  The Green Party?  Oh, please.  Does the Green Party get together and say, yeah, Roseanne's got to be our candidate?  I don't think so.  Why don't she go?  Because they're all green with envy.  Oh, Chip.  What's her dumb platform?  What is the word?  I am for the greening of America and the world. 
[01:10:00]  Green equals peace and flesh.  And envy.  Justice.  Not envy.  Okay.  I love people that want us to go back to fucking caveman times.  That's great.  A lot of people aren't saying this Marco Rubio from Florida would be the VP.  Why is he kind of like not in the public eye that much right now?  Why?  When they start upping his, his, yeah, they would start like kind of, yeah.  They did him with Sarah Palin, though. 
[01:10:30]  She came out of nowhere, right?  Yeah.  And it's probably vetting him.  Whoever they were going to have run, they're probably vetting very carefully so they don't  fuck up like last year.  Yeah, that's true.  But Obama, maybe because he was a newer guy, but he took a guy he was kind of competing  with in Biden.  He was paranoid, so he took old white guy.  He didn't want old white guy.  Well, they had to take old white guy, yeah.  That wasn't his move.  People sat him down and said, you need old white guy.  Who has foreign policy, who's respected foreign policy-wise for whatever reason.  I would bet a lot of money on that one, too, that Obama would love to have someone else 
[01:11:00]  in there.  Another brother.  I think he wants a brother in there.  He's too much of a nerd.  I don't think he would want a brother.  Would Romney take a black VP?  No.  The Republicans are so cock-sucking dumb.  It's like, do you understand how much of a liberal base that would pull?  Because there are people that like the idea of a black president for progression, for whatever.  There's plenty of people that the only reason they voted for Obama was because he was black.  But a lot of black people are not happy with Obama, and if you present them with a good 
[01:11:30]  option and a more conservative black VP.  Who's that option, though?  Again, I don't know enough about Condoleezza Rice.  I'm only mentioning her because she had a very, very high-profile position, and she  didn't get, I want to say, aside from being associated with Bush, she has a pretty high  respectable level, respectability.  I think Romney will pick someone very typical.  Another white guy.  I agree.  Yeah.  Middle-aged.  Probably not too old.  You've got to look at maybe like a Christie. 
[01:12:00]  How old is Marco Rubio?  I don't know.  And he's a bit ethnic, too, right?  I'm not sure.  He'll bring in some ethnic.  Maybe, yeah.  With a last name, like Rubio, he's got to have a little ethnic.  Yeah, yeah.  It won't be Chris Christie.  Huh?  It will not be Chris Christie.  Too fat?  I think he's too fat.  I know he is.  For the ticket?  Yeah.  It's kind of like our own...  Yeah.  What is he doing?  He's looking for food.  Is he looking for food?  He dropped a bagel.  Oh, my God.  What's he doing?  What happened?  What are you looking for?  Fuck yourself.  I was looking for something in my bag. 
[01:12:30]  What?  We need to know.  Two full balls?  Chips are horny.  What's that?  I must say, guys, this radio is so much better than being at radio.  I agree, because I literally want to talk to Tim Tebow or Joe Montana.  Yeah.  Crazy.  What were you looking for, Iraq?  Looking for my hard drive.  Oh, why?  Why?  What's on there?  So I had to send some more photos out to you guys.  Youngsters?  Oh.  He's got a child.  Youngsters.  Turn on your feet hard driving.  He does, yes.  And he carries a little thing of acid that he can pour on it in case the police come and 
[01:13:00]  knock him.  Boomer's very upset with you, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Boomer.  Hi, Boomer.  Hey, Jimmy.  I hope we're not going to have an ugly interaction.  Marco Rubio is ineligible because he's not native-born?  No.  Rubio is native-born.  He's Cuban.  They're going to probably take him because they want the Cuban vote in Florida.  But he's got Florida.  Oh, he doesn't have Florida.  And in the general election, who wins Florida right now between Romney and Obama? 
[01:13:30]  You know more than me.  I actually don't know.  I have no fucking clue at this point.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  I just assumed that was a given.  All right.  Go ahead, Boomer.  And Norton, you don't know what you're talking about.  It's not the Republicans.  They're a bunch of assholes.  They've got to play this holy Catholic shit if they want the Southern vote.  So that's why they play it.  And it's Obama that's trying to regulate the Internet, and the Republicans are trying to fight him.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Can we just do one point at a time?  I know what you're saying about going for the Southern vote. 
[01:14:00]  You're saying the Republicans aren't doing it, but they're going for the Southern vote.  Well, then they're doing it.  And we both know that the conservatives are much, much more closely aligned with the religious ideology and the religious conservatism than Democrats.  You can't argue that.  I mean, I'm not saying that...  I know, but Bush was the biggest churchgoer, and what did he do?  He didn't do anything.  What did he do?  He was responsible for the...  And believe me, I know Michael Copps was in charge of the FCC, but what did Bush do?  That's when the fines went from $35,000 per offense to $350,000 per offense. 
[01:14:30]  And shit rolls downhill, man.  It's like the tone of the administration a lot of times sets the tone of what they enact and what they go after.  And Republicans don't...  Tipper Gore was the one that started this shit.  Her husband's the biggest...  No, no, no.  She did.  She absolutely did with warning labels and stuff like that.  Can I jump in for a second?  What Jimmy's saying is very, very important, because when the fines went up 10 times, it ruined radio. 
[01:15:00]  It destroyed it.  It wasn't George Bush that said, we've got to go after radio.  It's...  That's true.  But it comes down...  It's the tone of the administration is what they go after.  All right.  Well, now the big thing is the Internet.  And if you listen to the senators from the Republican side, they're trying to fight Obama,  who wants to regulate the last free thing we have is the Internet.  Now, does he want to regulate the Internet for pornography and moral reasons?  Or is it because of piracy and stuff like that? 
[01:15:30]  No.  They're using that as a front to control the Internet.  Can I...  And I'm going to jump in.  I completely agree with Boomer on that point.  They always find something like, no, we're doing it for this fucking reason,  when it's a bigger reason they're doing it for.  They're like, oh, the piracy is out of control, so we've got to step in and kind of control us.  I agree with that point, Boomer.  Okay, Boomer, so you think, as someone that lives in this country and reads the same stuff I do,  you think that it is the Democrats who really are the more repressive when it comes to certain freedoms, 
[01:16:00]  like social freedoms, and the Republicans are fighting for the rights of people to do what they want  in the privacy of their own homes and to watch what they want to watch pornography-wise.  Yeah, the Republicans want smaller government.  They want them out of your face.  Really?  The Samageddon.  So who...  Okay.  They want the government in every aspect of your life.  So who is the one...  Who is the group saying that gays who wanted to defend this country couldn't join the military? 
[01:16:30]  Are you going to tell me that was liberals or conservatives?  I guarantee you that was the generals in the army that were saying,  we don't want this policy out because it's going to destroy the morale of the whole army,  and a Republican just happened to be...  Oh, my God, dude.  How can you...  How can you...  I'm a fucking independent, but I'm telling you,  you are blind if you don't think the Democrats are trying to get government in every aspect of your life.  I'm talking about one aspect. 
[01:17:00]  I'm talking about when it comes to moralizing and watching pornography or watching what you want as an adult  or gays marrying or being in the military or just downloading something like Max Hardcore,  it is not the Democrats who are fucking targeting that.  And one Republican that came out in public that said you can't have Internet forms.  None of them do.  None of them do.  It's the Democrats that are pushing it behind the scenes.  Obama is trying to...  If you don't understand what this guy's trying to do, you've got to read up. 
[01:17:30]  He's trying to control the entire Internet.  He wants to regulate everything that you have on the Internet.  Oh, okay.  So...  No, no, no.  The Internet thing is really scary, and people should start, you know, paying attention.  So it's...  Okay, it's Democrats.  No, no.  Fair enough.  Conservative religious Republicans are the ones who are for you being able to watch pornography  and what you want in your house.  They're not a slave to the religious right, right?  Yeah, but they don't care what you do.  They just disagree with it.  They're not going to come and regulate what you watch. 
[01:18:00]  They just do it in your own bedroom.  Unless...  Dude, what you just said is exactly the company line they get, and it's a lie.  It's not...  You're misinformed, Jim.  You're misinformed.  Who fights gay marriage?  They don't fight it.  They just don't care the habits that...  No, they're trying to...  Dude, stop it.  They're trying to get bills passed and make it a constitutional...  Constitutional amendment.  ...amendment that says the Marriage Protection Act...  Yeah, that's true.  Stop.  That's true. 
[01:18:30]  The liberals use that as a front.  They always point to, look, the Republicans don't want gays to get married.  And meanwhile, behind the scenes, they're trying to regulate every freedom that you have...  You're just not going to see it.  You're just...  To win the argument, or to win the point, you're going to deny something that everybody who lives and functions in this country knows.  I'm not saying that the Republicans don't like gays getting married.  That's besides the point.  So I'm asking you, why, if they're for complete less government, why are they the ones that moralize and try to dictate what you do in your bedroom, who you marry, and what you watch, and what is sold in the community when it comes to adult materials? 
[01:19:00]  This is hard for you to understand because you're not religious, but they actually believe from God that that's the wrong thing to do.  Okay.  That's right, but that's what they believe.  That's how this country was fucking born, Christian values.  There you go.  They're not going to throw it out the window.  You just made my point.  Thank you.  You're right. 
[01:19:30]  That is what they believe.  It's not what the country is believing in that, no?  Okay, I guess that we should have slaves then.  And I suppose we should only have 13 stars on the flag.  That is such a shit argument.  Why?  And you know what?  Hold on.  The Republicans freed the slaves.  It was the liberals.  Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's a little sneaky.  The Republicans did, but back then, the Republicans were the much more liberal party than the Democrats.  They were the liberal party back then.  You're crazy.  No, I'm not crazy.  The Democrats were the ones that fought to keep the slaves. 
[01:20:00]  That's why Lincoln was a Republican.  If you look at history, the Democrats tried to block, Al Gore's father tried to block all his civil liberties.  That these guys have right now.  They were more conservative back then.  The Democrats, that's what I'm saying.  The Republicans were more liberal back then.  And?  What does that mean?  You just said Lincoln was a Republican.  I know he was a Republican, and I know he freed the slaves.  I understand that.  But you're acting like being a Christian is a bad thing. 
[01:20:30]  No, I'm not.  That's probably why you're defending.  No, no.  I didn't say being a Christian is a bad thing.  I don't give a fuck if you're a Christian.  When you try to impose what you believe on what I watch as an adult, then I hate you.  I don't care if you're a Muslim or a Christian.  I could give a shit.  I never watch.  You tell yourself, you just said to me, hey, this country was founded on Christian values.  So then when I say, hold on, if you want to talk about when the country was founded, and if I go back and say, well, what about slavery? 
[01:21:00]  You tell me I have a shit argument.  So when you're talking about the country's origins, it's okay.  But when I mention something.  I think they did a pretty good job building a country on Christian values.  Yeah, we did a terrific job.  I'm not saying that the country isn't great, but then just say Christian values are what is keeping this pornography away from people.  And Republicans, you just said they want that Southern vote.  So they are the ones that more embrace that ideology.  All right.  Well, I'm going to call you back when, if Obama gets back in and he passes something that takes the porn off the Internet, 
[01:21:30]  and I want to hear you cry to me about Sarah Palin and that's another thing you're wrong about.  Oh, yeah, totally.  Yes.  What am I wrong about Sarah Palin?  McCain was carrying his luggage to the airport by himself before Sarah Palin got on board.  When she got on board, that was when he came out of nowhere and she got the Republican vote behind McCain.  She wasn't the greatest candidate, but if he didn't pick her, he would have been dead five months before she even got on board. 
[01:22:00]  If you really think, you're actually, you're calling up here and you're saying, you're saying that, hold on,  the Republicans are more for your own personal sexual freedoms than the Democrats, and Sarah Palin helped John McCain.  He helped him get to where he was in that campaign.  Yes, the losing side of it.  Dude.  He would have won if that idiot didn't go back to Washington to vote on that bill that they had about raising the limits.  I don't think he would have won. 
[01:22:30]  No, he was.  I don't think he would have won.  I think that he was a likable guy.  He was a likable guy.  He was carrying his luggage to the airport until he got her.  Oh, you just said that, sir.  We heard you.  He was carrying his luggage to the airport.  We get that.  He was carrying his luggage to the airport?  Yeah.  His age hurt a lot, and this is why she hurt him, because there was a huge thinking that if he dies,  which was a possibility because he was old, who takes – the vice president was much more of an important issue for the Republicans because of his age.  Yeah.  And people talked about that a lot, and they looked at Sarah Palin as a very, very possible successor in the White House because McCain was so old. 
[01:23:00]  And they didn't see her having enough experience and being kind of sharp enough.  She looked a little doltish back then because of the way the press presented her.  It made her look like an idiot.  She's not the brightest lady in the world, but she saved that guy's campaign.  He was dead.  He lost.  He lost the election.  How did she save the campaign? 
[01:23:30]  He would have been dead if he didn't pick anybody with the light card.  She got thousands and thousands of people that donate money to his campaign.  Thousands.  Otherwise, he'd have been dead long before she even came out.  Here's what we've established.  The Republicans – the report –  I've established that you are turning left and soft.  Well, I know – hey, look, you're writing hard, buddy.  I'm sure you're a tough guy.  But I'm soft because I want you to be able to watch what you want in your own home.  You're right.  That's not the point.  The point is I listened to you every day for years and years, and I could slowly get that left Hollywood, Jimmy. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Real Hollywood.  I wrote a book where I attacked people, you dumb motherfucker.  I blast people every day on this show.  Very Hollywood.  I attack people on Twitter.  All I do is attack Al Sharpton by name.  What are you talking about?  That's completely not Hollywood, you dunce.  I'm telling you, you're coming off as a lefty on this radio.  I don't care.  Because you have one opinion.  Take your right-wing ideology and fuck yourself with it. 
[01:24:30]  I'm tired of having conservatives dictate certain morality.  And as an entertainer, I've seen it happen.  I know what the liberals do with PC.  I can't wait to the left picture right the way you are going to fight.  Well, a hard guy like you, it'll never happen to.  A real hard, a hard righty like you, bucko.  I said I was an independent.  I didn't say I was an independent.  No!  Yes, you are.  Country's Christian values.  Yeah.  You're real independent.  You're not an independent.  You think you're an independent because you don't want to seem like you're a fucking, 
[01:25:00]  you're a complete shill for one side of the fence.  You got me pegged.  I'm in church every Sunday.  I don't know anything else except Christian values.  You're the one that mentioned Christian values, not me.  But the country was built on them and they did a pretty good job.  The country, but the country really wasn't built on Christian values.  It was.  It was founded by guys that came over that were Christian.  I know that.  I know who founded the country.  I know, but it wasn't Christian values to only have a certain segment of the population vote. 
[01:25:30]  Christian values would have been to treat everybody with respect and not to have slaves.  So they really weren't using Christian values.  I think Christian values were a lot more loving and a lot more giving and a lot more sharing.  I think that they were going under the guise of using Christian values.  But to me, real Christian values didn't say it was okay to buy a nigger and beat him and call him that.  I don't think that's Christian values.  I think that's fucking a slave owning mentality and that's not a Christian value.  Oh, that's what they learned when they were brought up. 
[01:26:00]  That's the way it was.  Okay, keep excusing it.  I've just told you, you said Christian values, and I'm saying that's the way they spoke back then and that's the way they treated people.  Women weren't allowed to vote.  Blacks were treated as a fucking, what was it, a third of a citizen or a fifth?  Yeah.  And you're saying that that's Christian values.  I'd say it's the greatest thing.  I said the country was built on Christian values.  That's how it is.  Of course that's how it is because you're in the position where you would have benefited.  But you wouldn't be saying that's how it is if you were on the other side of it. 
[01:26:30]  But that's how it is.  You can't change it.  You can't.  Okay.  The country was built on Christian values.  They did a good job.  And you can't say because we beat niggers and women couldn't vote that they didn't do a good job.  Yes, you can say that there was a lot of great things that came out of our founding fathers.  And you could also say there was a hypocrisy in there that to me was not Christian values.  You're saying it was Christian values.  They wanted to get away from the Church of England and religious suppression.  So what did they do?  In the Salem witch trials, the little girls pointed at people and they dunked you in the water until you were dead. 
[01:27:00]  Stop it.  Salem witch trials.  Oh, no, that didn't happen.  I apologize.  That didn't happen.  But that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.  It was in the name of the Church.  It was in the name of the Church and in the name of God.  You're talking about Christian values.  Why is it when I point something out, you say that?  They founded on Christian values and they did a good job.  Keep repeating yourself.  Because that's probably what you do at home with your family.  You just keep repeating yourself until they leave the room.  I've heard you. 
[01:27:30]  The country was founded on Christian values.  So is it Christian to own a slave and be a slave and not allow women to vote when you're voting?  That's Christian?  I guess it was back then.  Okay.  If that's what Christian values were, then they were shit.  They were around to kill millions of people, but it doesn't matter.  They built this country.  They did a good job.  They did?  Okay.  They did a great job with Christian values.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm glad you feel that way.  Yeah.  I mean, you got to agree.  They did a good job.  No.  You have the freedom to move anywhere you want, but you stay in it. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Certain people.  No, no, no, no.  Hold on.  Boomer.  Remember, certain people had a freedom to move it everywhere they want.  Sorry I'm being so left and soft and correcting you, but you did not have a freedom to move  where you wanted.  You do.  Right now.  You say that this country with these right-wing Christians and this country was founded on  shitty values.  No, I didn't say that.  You just said it.  No.  You said the country was founded on Christian values, and I said it was not founded.  If it was really founded on Christian values, certain things never would have taken place. 
[01:28:30]  Never.  What values do you think that they started this country on when God is in everything that  you have that was when they founded the country?  Like many other people who talk about religion, I think they completely took the parts that  they wanted to use to their advantage and left a lot of what was intended out.  I just don't see that as being a Christian value.  I just don't see that as being Christian.  This guy's excuse is that back in the day, Christian values meant something else. 
[01:29:00]  It meant having slaves and women not being able to vote and archaic laws based on religion.  If it's that, then I'll say Christian values were shit.  Right.  Fair enough.  If you want to say that's what Christian values were, and having a slave went hand in hand  with having Christian values, then Christian values were garbage.  It could be, but the country came out pretty good.  Okay.  You just...  Fair enough.  Country came out good.  I mean, George Washington had more slaves than anybody. 
[01:29:30]  Yes, he did.  His wife that he married had just as much as he did.  But you know what?  He was a pretty good goddamn first president.  Did a great job.  Sure.  He won the war of freedom.  You're going to say because he enslaved the guy was a shithead?  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am going to say that.  Jim, if you lived back then, you would have had three niggers in your backyard doing the  raking and the fucking shoveling.  Maybe, you know what?  Back then?  Maybe I would have, but I would have been...  And me saying that Washington's a shithead doesn't mean that he didn't do a good job 
[01:30:00]  as the president, but he was a shithead if he had slaves.  Coming here...  If you had money back then, Jim, you'd have...  Fifteen black guys...  Okay, so you're saying that things were so different back then.  So different that they didn't understand that it was wrong to go to another country and bring...  Stop it!  Stop defending that!  They did know it was wrong, but that's what they did.  Then they were hypocrites and frauds!  Everybody's a hypocrite and a fraud.  Okay.  Everybody.  The president we got right now... 
[01:30:30]  Can you just admit that?  Instead of just saying, yeah, everyone...  Can't you just say, yeah, you're right, they were hypocrites and frauds.  To scream about freedom, to fight for freedom, and then enslave people.  It's a sickening, sickening thing.  But that's what happened.  It absolutely is.  That's exactly how our government was founded.  It absolutely is.  On a lot of hypocrisy.  We all would have been doing the same thing.  No, half the country didn't do it, by the way.  I just want to go on the record.  If I owned slaves back then, I would have treated them nice. 
[01:31:00]  That's all I want to say.  There were guys that did.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have been the guy that was an asshole.  I would have been like, okay, this slave thing is happening, so I guess I gotta get involved.  But I would have treated them nice.  I would have gave them some time off and whatnot.  But you would have had them, because that's how it was.  Probably.  I don't know.  Then, dude, if you're that stupid, that you have no ability to make your own moral judgments,  that's how it was.  That's what I would have done.  Jim.  You sound like a follower.  Everybody smoked.  We know it's no good now, but everybody smoked back then, because that's how it was. 
[01:31:30]  But once it became apparent as to how bad it was, a lot of people have quit.  Well, a lot of people got rid of their slaves.  When it became illegal, yes, when they were freed by the president, yes.  The entire North got rid of their slaves before it was illegal.  That's why the war happened.  They started getting rid of their slaves when it became a little awkward.  Yeah.  Telling them.  Why are you saying that that's just how it was and everybody did it?  Because that's how it was.  You didn't know any better.  You were raised. 
[01:32:00]  You just said you didn't know any better.  A minute ago, you acknowledged that you knew it, but now you don't know any better.  So it was just ignorant.  They didn't know.  When you were raised, you were raised around people who won't slave, so you thought that's  what you did.  You thought that's what you did.  You didn't know any better.  So you didn't understand the...  You knew it was wrong, but that's how it was.  You just said you didn't know it was wrong, and now you're saying you know it was wrong.  No.  I said that's how you grew up.  To you, what am I going to tell you?  We're just never going to agree.  I just like calling up and saying you're a lefty. 
[01:32:30]  Go ahead.  Yeah, he's called up a few times.  That cornball thing, I'm a lefty.  All I do is scream about racial imbalance in media reporting.  You need to redefine what you see as a liberal, because you sound like a dumbbell.  You're a guy that, if you hear one thing that is from the liberal ideology, you peg the person  as a complete and total liberal in every aspect of their life.  I didn't say that.  Well, you're calling Jimmy.  You're saying Jimmy is.  Getting soft and getting left. 
[01:33:00]  I could hear it.  Meanwhile, all I do is attack phony civil libertarians for complaining about airport security.  Like, what are you talking about?  I hear it every day.  I'm telling you.  All right.  Well, you stay right and hard, buddy.  You keep it hard.  You don't take any shit, Boomer.  Should we agree to disagree?  Yeah.  No, no, you are.  I'm left and soft.  You're right and hard.  I think.  Yeah.  All right, Boomer.  Thanks.  Tough guy.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  Yeah, take care, tough guy.  I like it.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  Just keep boring your family by repeating your fucking the same thing over and over.  I didn't know what was wrong back then.  All right, Boomer.  I'm going to fuck somebody else now.  All right, Boomer.  See when the internet gets turned off.  Yeah, the internet gets turned off.  Sounds like a bright guy.  It's a big switch.  They're going to turn the internet off.  Right.  Wasn't Bush in office when they got rid of the gambling?  Downline gambling?  No, I think Obama was in there.  Uh-oh.  See, that could be a sign.  I think so.  Hey, would you have treated your slaves nice, Ant? 
[01:34:00]  Let me think.  I'd have had quite the spread.  A lot of big fucking property.  Probably some money-making crops.  And I don't think I'd have been one of those, you know, every little thing you got to whip  the shit out of people.  But I'd have ruled with an iron fist, I think.  You know, too nice and they're going to start taking advantage.  Would you have taken some midnight visits?  No.  No?  No, I'm not.  I would have.  I so would have.  Oh, God. 
[01:34:30]  I would have to hire the right, uh...  There'd be one of those big Hughes family reunions where there's two parts, two halves  to the picnic ground.  All I'm saying is everyone else was owning slaves and you had owned slaves.  I would have treated them nice and I would have taken some midnight visits.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they would have loved that.  Well...  Maybe she had, you know, a boyfriend.  No, I said I would treat them nice.  Oh, okay.  So I wouldn't force myself upon the...  Oh, you'd use your fucking slave-owning charm? 
[01:35:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Somehow.  Somehow I would.  Massa Opie is coming to visit again.  I would use these gorgeous blue eyes of mine.  Oh, obviously.  See, they saw those as the devil's blue eyes.  But I would make them realize that there's nothing devilish about them.  You certainly could have changed history with that attitude.  That's for sure.  We would have lived in a much more peaceful country.  I'm worried about this internet thing for real. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Because the government wants their taste.  That's all this is about.  Yeah, they're talking about bringing internet gambling back in at least a couple of states,  which I don't know how they would do it state to state, to tell you the truth.  They're starting to figure that shit out.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  They got all sorts of filters and stuff that are starting to work.  Let's say Jersey says, all right, we're going to allow internet online poker.  Right.  Me being out on Long Island, why can't I just log in to their stupid server and play some  fucking poker?  Right now you can, but I think they're really starting to figure out how to localize the 
[01:36:00]  internet more and more.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  You know that Brad Pitt has a filter where his kids, when they go online, they can't read  anything about Brad Pitt?  But that was in the news last day.  That's good.  They should have that for parents.  Yeah.  And that's kind of easy to do.  I know that's a different issue.  That's more like a parental control type of thing.  But they're definitely starting to figure out how to localize the internet.  I know they do it through banking and stuff.  That's the easiest way, where if you have accounts in New York, maybe you'll need an 
[01:36:30]  account in New Jersey in order to play on their website.  But there are always workarounds.  Right.  Like sometimes when I used to play online poker, you weren't able to just use, I wasn't  able to use any of my credit cards.  Right.  But I could use my credit card to buy a phone card and then use the phone card to pay for  the account and to bankroll my account.  Yeah.  Hey, who started the SOPA thing down there in Washington?  Was it Republicans or was it a Republican senator or was it a Democrat? 
[01:37:00]  I think the...  And how was it shut down?  Boy, oh, it was both?  Was it both?  The Denver pest is saying, no, now it's someone saying Republican and then the Democrat.  Yeah.  Okay, great.  Because that ain't going...  That's not going to go away.  They're going to keep revisiting that shit.  They'll try.  Yeah.  And it comes down to the government wants their taste.  They see a huge revenue stream there.  Well, they're already taxing commerce.  That's not being taken advantage of yet.  Well, they're already taxing commerce.  No, I understand that, but they probably feel like they can make a shitload more money than  what's coming out of the internet right now. 
[01:37:30]  It's under the guise of piracy.  Which is complete bullshit.  They're trying to keep companies that have online content from being ripped off by people.  There is a certain point to that, too, though.  It's like, what's the line you draw where people are just like, it's okay just to take your shit?  Yeah.  Like, how do you protect that?  Because it is...  Just because it's online, it doesn't mean that there should be no regulations where you can  get your shit stolen.  True.  That's true.  So, like, the problem with the government is they start with that shit, and then they're 
[01:38:00]  all-encompassing.  We all know that.  I know.  I'm into complete freedom of the internet, but there is a part where, you know, you're  talking about somebody's shit, and you're literally stealing it from them when you download  it illegally.  I don't trust the government to figure that out.  No, I agree.  I don't either.  And that's another thing.  Again, whenever the government wants to stick their fucking face in something for our best  interest, it never turns out to be for our best interest.  No, it never does.  It really is the worst thing possible.  They can't run anything. 
[01:38:30]  They're horrible at running a country, a business.  You know, business-wise, they're great with, you know, I feel pretty secure that a foreign  army isn't going to come over here and kill us in our sleep, and that's directly because  of the government's protecting us with the armed services.  But it's these business things that they are horrendous at.  They just throw huge amounts of money at a problem, hoping it fixes it, and all it does  is make a, what is it called, a boondoggle? 
[01:39:00]  It's terrible.  And we want to trust them with more things in our life as far as, you know, socially and  financially.  I like the fact that, you know, you could drive on the interstate highways and, for the  most part, they're paved nicely, right?  They got guardrails, they got lighting, things like that.  That's good shit.  I like that.  I like the fact that there's these huge dams that fucking make power.  The electricity's on and shit like that.  The water infrastructure's there. 
[01:39:30]  I turn on the faucet, water comes out.  It's amazing.  I don't like when they want to fucking regulate the internet, when they want to start charging  money for these projects that they're in charge of when they have no fiscal responsibility  whatsoever.  No accountability.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  All right.  More importantly, Ant, I got a question for Sam.  Young Samwise Gamshi.  Instead of talking to Boomer in Jersey for the last 20 minutes, who could we have talked 
[01:40:00]  to if we were on Radio Row right now?  Right.  I mean, we could have been listening to the interview from yesterday with Joe Montana  or talking about that.  But if we were down there.  That's what I mean.  I mean, like, you could have been talking to somebody.  Pretty much guaranteed we'd have some kind of NFL grade.  Oh, there'd be an NFL grade or a celebrity of sorts.  I would have said we got Boomer today, so that's good.  That's good radio, I'm thinking.  You had to fill the time with something because you didn't have the celebrities there in Indianapolis.  God damn it.  Management's right again, Ant. 
[01:40:30]  But why would we want to be on Radio Row?  You would.  There's no way you would have talked to Boomer.  I know.  We got some great stuff out of him.  It was great.  Fuck.  I did like hearing Jimmy fucking trash him.  Because what bothered me was the fact that this, to be that fucking dumb, to actually think  that the Republicans were the ones who are trying to fight for your right to watch and  jerk off to what you want.  I don't know how to argue that.  Take a dick in your ass, you know.  Ah, boy, let me take a dick in my ass. 
[01:41:00]  They are.  And then the people, and to the dummy who's Twittering me going, Obama's against gay marriage  too.  I understand that.  A lot of Democrat politicians are.  But the people that really are pushing against that are not liberal Democrats.  And I personally believe it's nobody's fucking business.  I don't care what you jerk off into your home, as long as it's not kid fucking.  Oh, who cares?  Like, I don't care what you watch.  To me, I want the government off your back when it comes to that stuff.  Yeah.  And instead of just saying, yeah, that's true, that is a weakness in the Republicans' argument 
[01:41:30]  for total freedom, this dumb fucking boomer is going, no, no, they're for that.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  The conservatives are for?  Rick Santorum is saying that he doesn't want gays to get married.  Right.  Why do you care?  Yeah.  And then instead of just going, oh, yeah, that's true, he'll go, oh, that's Christian values.  Well, then fuck Christian values.  Fuck them.  What Bible do you read?  Santorum says no taxing rich is in the Bible.  Can we just leave the Bible out of fucking politics? 
[01:42:00]  It's just nonsense.  Hey, for the record, SOPA was drafted by U.S. Representative Lamar S. Smith, who is a Republican  from Texas.  Lamar.  Thank you, Natus Chaos, or however the fuck.  I've been trying to figure out how to say your name for years, and I give up.  It's another stupid internet.  That's a great name that you can't pronounce.  Yeah.  I hate those names.  I guess it's chaos with a K and Natus Chaos.  Hedley Lamar.  Hedley Lamar.  Hedley. 
[01:42:30]  All right, I'm going to play this from over here.  Over here now.  Then we'll do something else.  We've got some best man speeches, the finals.  I want to hear those.  Oh, yeah.  Do you want to hear them today?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I'll hear a few.  All right, we'll do a couple of those next.  Stay there.  Let's do this.  Obey and Anthony, Jim Norton, who's going to be at Bananas in Poughkeepsie this weekend. 
[01:43:00]  Tonight and tomorrow.  Tonight and tomorrow.  I don't have high hopes for big crowds.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jim Norton.  You know how frustrating it is to be put in a position where it seems like I'm defending Democrats?  Oh.  What happened?  I thought we were past that already.  No, no, no.  But I'm just like, I'm realizing I'm going to the bathroom.  It's like.  It happens.  I was attacking civil libertarians who are remarkably left.  People don't get it.  It's like I said.  They hear one thing you say, label it left, and then every idea you have has to be left-leaning 
[01:43:30]  and you're a bed-wetting liberal.  And I bashed the religious conservatives because I really do think they stink.  Yeah.  But it's like I was attacking the phony civil libertarians who didn't defend Stoliano.  And those are not fucking religious conservatives.  So it's like.  I think everyone knows my viewpoints.  And I don't like the religious right.  Really?  I think they're fucking.  Terrible.  They're hypocrites.  You're pretty radical, though.  I am pretty radical.  Most of them are sucking dick.  And that cool thing.  And they're fucking, you know.  Tapping their foot under bathroom stalls. 
[01:44:00]  I love that story.  Oh, thank God you added story.  I love that.  Oh, yeah.  I just love doing that.  It's so much fun.  I looked up for my Twitter.  What?  Radio Row is happening, and we're not there.  Just want to remind people.  I called Mitt Romney, Ron Paul.  Remember that.  If that happens, I called it.  Oh.  Mitt Romney, Ron Paul.  I can't see that.  Are you a betting man?  No, I don't gamble.  Other than with my health.  Let's put a little action on that. 
[01:44:30]  I can't see it.  There's no way.  Okay.  It's not even a chance.  He's too crazy.  He's too out there.  I think there's more of a chance that it would be Newt before Ron Paul.  And I don't think Newt is a possibility either.  No, Newt isn't either.  They're just going to pick someone like Rubio.  Centorum?  No.  It's going to be someone that we're not seeing.  Rubio Christie.  Rubio Christie, I think, even though he's fat, he's got to be on a list.  He's got to be on a list.  It's like, yeah, he'd be good. 
[01:45:00]  There's got to be the basic white guy, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Although Rubio, they keep saying for a little ethnic in there.  Well, yeah.  Didn't we just do this?  We did.  Okay.  Hey, the Patriots still favored in the Super Bowl.  By what?  Tree.  Tree points?  Yeah.  What do you think that'll change to game day?  Think it'll go up, down, what?  I don't know that shit.  To be honest with you.  I'm just very surprised that they're favored.  I don't know why.  I feel like the Giants are the better team going into the game.  My cousins are such degenerates.  Yeah, what are they saying? 
[01:45:30]  I tweeted them to make sure they know.  I was like, hey, guys, make sure you tell the rest of the family there's a Super Bowl party on Sunday at my house.  And my cousin, RJ, is like, yeah, cool.  I'll let them know.  Hey, by the way, if you need any action on the game, just tell me.  Really?  Yeah.  What are you?  The little fucking Long Island bookie?  Are you taking action?  I don't think I'm going to be taking any action.  I was never a sports bettor.  I did those dumb sheets where you pick all the teams. 
[01:46:00]  I'll just do the fucking pool at the house.  I'll draw up the fucking grid.  You pick the numbers, and everybody there gets to lay down some cash, and you do it by quarter.  Travis?  You know what's fun about Super Bowl betting?  Yeah.  All the different stupid little props.  Yeah, I saw some of those bets.  Yeah.  Some of them were hilarious.  One was, Will, they mentioned Tim Tebow in the first quarter, was it?  Yeah.  That's an actual one.  Or the first ten minutes or something?  Can you find those bets?  I kind of was laughing at some of those.  I can log in.  Yeah, one of them is if the announcers...  Who's announcing the game? 
[01:46:30]  Al Michaels.  It is Al again?  Al Michaels.  He's not doing it alone, though.  Chris Collinsworth.  No, no, no.  Bill Schefter.  Bill Schefter.  Oh, right, right, right.  They got him out of retirement.  But one of the bets is if the announcers will mention Tim Tebow.  Tim Tebow?  Either in the first quarter or the first ten minutes of their broadcast.  There's a million of them.  Who will they show first, Peyton or Archie Manning?  Oh.  But if they're both shown at the same time, who do they say first?  Right.  I think I'm taking Kelly Clarkson singing the national anthem under 94 seconds. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, you could take the under or over.  There's no way.  Of the national anthem.  Well, see, here's what you got to do.  You got to go on.  If you're going to be in front of a billion people, you're going to take your time.  You would think so, but you go on YouTube and you watch all of her national anthem performances.  Uh-huh.  And she's never gone over 94 seconds.  She will for the Super Bowl.  I would take that bet in a second.  How do we...  This is the shit I want to bet.  Yeah, this is fun.  Well, you got to...  You hear about the Gatorade one?  Yes.  What color the Gatorade's going to be when the...  That they throw... 
[01:47:30]  You know, pour over the yellow.  Yeah, yeah.  Sounds like you could have some...  No, yellow is the...  Collusion.  Yellow is an easy bet.  Yeah, well...  Blue is the color that's 10 to 1.  It's not going to be blue.  Green?  How do you bet on this?  Well, you got to join like a...  Something in Vegas?  No, you got to find a site that still lets you bet from the United States.  Oh, God.  Mikey...  How the fuck can you not...  How is online gambling illegal?  Because the government doesn't get their taste.  That's all it's about.  When the government figures out how they get a real taste in the action, it'll be back. 
[01:48:00]  It is simply nobody's fucking business.  They don't give a fuck about the individual.  Whenever the government comes in and starts saying anything that we're doing this for  you, for your health, for the better of this, we don't want people going broke.  Just remember, booze and cigarettes.  Totally legal.  Sold in this country.  Taxed up the ass so the government pulls in the money.  Right.  So how could they say anything about your health when there's no problem with selling 
[01:48:30]  cigarettes or booze?  Two biggest killers in the country.  Let me go to Mike in Queens.  He's going to explain the point spread.  This is our big Super Bowl break.  We should have done it for Radio Row, but we're doing it here in cold New York in the  middle of winter.  Why?  Go ahead, Mikey, because we're not there, Sam.  Well, first of all, I was a bookie for a long time, and Kathleen Rice, that cunt that she  is in Nassau County, decided to raid my house, knock down all three doors, and arrest 13 people  and says I'm worth $30 million.  Right.  Okay. 
[01:49:00]  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Wow.  Look, I'm an outside guy looking in.  It sounds like you might have had a hell of a business going.  An operation.  That they really wanted to look into.  If you had 13 people in there, you had an operation going.  It wasn't that big of an operation.  We didn't break anyone's legs.  We weren't attached to the mob.  We weren't attached to the internet.  She made it that we were made worth $30 million, then took us to drive.  It took $400,000 of my grandmother's house that was sold.  She was taking money from my cousin's cousin. 
[01:49:30]  How much cash did they get?  About $600,000.  She's the same one that tried to set up all those gun stores on Long Island, and that failed  miserably.  All the charges were dropped.  And then at the time, my attorney was telling me that she was over.  So you're saying that you really didn't have a lot of action out there?  No, it wasn't anything that was reported to be in the papers and on every website.  It was nothing.  Small bananas. 
[01:50:00]  Small bananas.  I'll tell you, the line's not going to move.  It's going to be three the whole time.  Why is it three?  Why is it three?  Because they made the AFC four and a half point favorites from the beginning of the year.  Why do I feel like the Giants have a better team, Mike?  I know.  I understand that.  Why?  It's four and a half.  It's four and a half all year long.  If they make it the Giants favorite, they get a middle.  And what happens is you bet Giants, all the people that had a four and a half all year  long, then they'll get screwed both ways. 
[01:50:30]  You understand what I'm saying?  No.  Not really.  Not in the least.  It's a world I know nothing about because we didn't have a huge gambling operation.  So I don't get this stuff.  People were betting on the AFC.  Or at Damone.  Right?  They were minus four and a half.  Okay.  So these people that were betting on the AFC all year long at minus four and a half.  If they go bet on the Giants plus three, and they buy a half a point, which you can  do, and it lands on the three, they bet both teams. 
[01:51:00]  And they could win both.  They'll bet the Giants and the Pats, and they'll win double there.  Oh.  Sounds like you know a lot about gambling.  Yeah.  I know everything.  Sounds exhausting.  It's really easy once you do.  You know what's exhausting is wondering when the Feds are coming to get you.  That's what's exhausting.  Sleeping.  Right.  Right.  Waiting for that door to bust in.  Why is it illegal?  I'm telling the cops that, too.  I agree.  I said, what's the difference between me and Donald Trump? 
[01:51:30]  That's true.  Had that excuse work.  I'll tell you why it's illegal, because there's no tax money.  They want their taste.  I would pay taxes.  No, I understand you would.  You probably know how to run a good gambling business and would say, fuck it.  I would still do really well if I paid taxes.  I get it.  But the government hasn't figured that shit out yet.  Yeah, you've got to be taxed.  You've got to buy permits for all kinds of money.  If I ran OTB, I would be a millionaire.  You know, OTB, it's 13%. 
[01:52:00]  The odds change rapidly all day long, because they take 13% off of every single race.  They don't win.  They only win.  They don't lose.  There's no losing.  I know.  And they went bankrupt.  They had to close down OTB.  That tells you a lot about the government.  We've talked about it many times on the show.  They couldn't even fucking get a profit going with the OTB.  With a bookie operation.  And we're counting on our government?  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:52:30]  Catherine Rice, she's going to take a fucking big black cock in her fucking ass.  Wow.  This girl doesn't like her.  Are you...  I hate that bitch.  Are you free and clear?  Or are you still dealing with the charges?  No, I'm done now.  I know I had a nice judge.  I mean, I was convicted of a felony.  Me and the top three guys.  But...  The top three guys.  But it was a small...  Small bananas.  Bananas.  I'm small bananas.  But you're clear and free. 
[01:53:00]  You didn't have to do any jail time or anything?  Jail time?  No.  Now I'm fucking working with my asshole father fucking doing construction in Manhattan.  Of course he's doing good.  What do you do?  Cement?  Cement and fucking tile all day.  Of course.  This guy's so guilty.  Does your last name end with a vowel?  Right.  No, I'm as Irish as it comes.  Oh.  Mikey, we love you.  But it seems like you know a little bit about the gambling world.  I know everything you could possibly know.  There's 30 pages on those propositions that you could take.  Yeah.  You could take it.  Kobe Bryant's going to score more points than the Patriots. 
[01:53:30]  You could take fucking the coin toss.  Obviously, heads and tails.  Who's going to win the coin toss?  Right.  How long...  How long...  Who's going to score first?  Who's going to score last?  Everything you could bet on, you could bet on.  Okay.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  How do you...  Mikey, Mikey.  I'm sorry about it.  How do you come up with...  How does bookies come up with three points?  And God damn it, if most times...  You can sort of explain that.  Okay, okay.  But what factors go into that?  Okay.  For every team, you get three points for being at home. 
[01:54:00]  Okay.  So, if you're on the neutral field, you automatically get three points.  On this point, no 9-17, which the Giants were, ever won the Super Bowl.  The Pats were 13-3.  So, to make them three points favorite is actually the right move.  Just because they're on this little run that they're on.  No 9-17, no 9-17, ever won.  They all lost.  All for every single one.  Pats are 13-3.  So, you get three points for being at home. 
[01:54:30]  That's how...  And they come up with a consensus.  They get all these gamblers in a room, sicko fucks, and they put them in a room.  What would you bet?  And they did this, that, and the other thing.  And they come up with a line.  But this was different with the Super Bowl because they fucked up and they made the AFC  four and a half.  Right.  We heard about that.  Yeah, we heard about the four and a half.  Yeah, it would be a pickle game.  I'm so lost.  I feel like I'm back in high school.  It's easy.  It just reminds me...  The home team default gets three points.  What? 
[01:55:00]  The home team, by default, gets three points.  So, now, in the Super Bowl, there isn't a home team.  Yeah, AFC.  Yes.  What?  By default.  The AFC.  By default.  But that's not a true home field advantage.  On a neutral field, you get zero points.  So, that's why...  But the way they come up with this line, which spreads on the regular season games...  Like, the San Francisco 49ers were two points last week.  So, technically, the Giants really were one-point favorites because you get three points for being home. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  See what I'm saying?  Oh, boy.  Okay.  It really is...  These guys are really bright.  But they get it so often.  They're right.  Yeah.  Like, that...  Yeah, it's always right.  If you need someone to play, you know...  Favored by six, and all of a sudden, they win by five.  How the fuck did you know that?  Yeah.  They don't know that.  It's an educated guess, pretty much.  And they have an MIT net position, and they're in it.  With the players.  But there's plenty of places to gamble, if you...  All right, you're criminal.  We get it.  All right, Mike. 
[01:56:00]  You fucking crook.  I think basketball's the hardest one because...  Basketball's the hardest.  Baseball's the easiest.  Yeah, because with basketball, you're scoring the fucking, you know, 85 to 100 points.  And with baseball, it really is one guy can control the game.  Hold on.  Hold on, Mike.  I know you like to talk a lot.  Let me jump in for a second.  So, it seems like you really know the gambling world, right?  So, why would you take the chance as the main guy?  Why wouldn't you just make sports bets?  It seems like you would do pretty well.  Because you know what goes behind it. 
[01:56:30]  Because that's what I was going to get into, that business of selling my picks, which I can do.  That's what, you know, the ex-referee, Tim Donaghy?  Yeah.  That's what he does now.  He sells picks online.  Wow.  Okay.  And he's probably making more money doing that than he...  It's pretty simple.  People that...  If you look at that guy that they did that profile on in 60 Minutes, that's all he...  Billy Waters, I think was his name.  He's a millionaire, billionaire.  And all he does is analyze the game up, down, and he's setting $25,000 apart. 
[01:57:00]  Ace Rothstein.  All right.  Yeah.  Are you going to start up again somewhere?  No.  Great answer right there.  He realized.  Wait a minute.  No.  No.  I guarantee he already started up again.  Who knows?  All right, Mike.  We like you, brother.  All right.  I love you guys.  Have a good weekend.  Mike from Queens.  Oh, I didn't mean to do that.  Whatever.  Geez, he loves to talk. 
[01:57:30]  Jim, you can bet on UFC.  You want to bet on some UFC games?  Or some fights?  No, give me the Super Bowl bets.  That's a game.  Give us the weird Super Bowl bets.  I want to read some of these.  Like he was saying, there's literally hundreds.  Oh, there is?  Yeah, but most of them are, you know, like, you know...  Yeah, the famous one who scores first.  Past receptions by Victor Cruz, you know?  Over, under, five and a half.  So, you know, Kelly Clarkson sings the Sto-Spangled Banner, over, under, 94 seconds.  Right.  Kelly Clarkson wears a numbered NFL jersey or shirt at the start of the National Anthem. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  Oh, you would so take that bet.  She's going to wear a number?  Well, that's actually, she's favored not to.  Really?  Take it.  All right, what other ones?  Kelly Clarkson omits or forgets a word.  Ah.  Five or more aircrafts after the National Anthem or one to four?  That's great.  Madonna's hair, 50% more or less blonde?  That's a tough one to judge. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, that is tough.  That's a very tough one to judge.  Yeah, come on.  Come on, let's bet some of this shit.  Who wants it?  Madonna wears fishnets.  No.  Madonna wears an NFL shirt with a number?  No.  Definitely not going to happen.  Oh, no.  Madonna wears a hat or a hoodie?  No, not what she's saying.  Madonna uses a headset or clip-on mic, or Madonna uses a handheld or stand mic?  It'll be a headset, of course.  Yeah, it won't be a handheld.  Heavily favored to wear a headset.  Man, I would love to bet on this. 
[01:59:00]  I'd be raking in the money.  Yeah, it's fun.  I wrote down all the ones that I'm going to.  I'd be raking in the bucks.  Wait, how do we bet?  Well, you've got to join a thing, like Bodog or the place that I join.  Bodog!  But the problem isn't really with the websites.  It's with Visa.  Funding.  Yeah, like you can't.  Visa knows who all of these places are, so they'll block you from being able to make  a payment to them.  How do they fucking do that?  So why don't we become bookies ourselves?  We should.  You want to?  We've got a nice platform.  What do you say?  Get a little action? 
[01:59:30]  NBC broadcaster Al Michaels to say the word miracle from kickoff until the end of the  first quarter.  Does he say miracle?  Or does he not say miracle?  Why would he say miracle?  Because he's the one that said, do you believe in miracle?  I know that, but does he say besides that?  But he could say something like, well, it would be a miracle if we even saw it.  He doesn't have to, you know, use it in the same context.  Or he could say, who brought me this turkey sandwich?  Where's my fucking miracle whip?  That would work.  That would count.  Mike Sarod.  Giselle Michaels or Chris Collinsworth say Tebow in the first quarter.  How did the bookies figure this shit out? 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  Without like, I don't know.  Losing clowns in a room, just fucking.  Right.  But how do they figure it out?  Taking coin toss bets.  Some of these look like no brainers.  But that's why I guess you bet.  Is Giselle Bunchkin.  I just explained betting.  Yeah.  And why people do it.  It's a no brainer.  Can't lose.  Hold on.  What's that Travis guy?  Will Giselle be shown at the Super Bowl?  Giselle who?  Bunchkin.  I don't know.  Bunchin.  Bunchin?  Bunchkin.  Sorry, I don't know the models.  Brady's broad.  Yeah, of course she's going to be shown.  Of course.  And she would want to be shown. 
[02:00:30]  So she's favored to be shown.  She'll be in a booth.  How many times will Robert Kraft be shown?  The over under three and a half.  Oh, he'll be shown.  They're saying they're only going to show him three and a half times?  No, that's what you're betting on.  Three and a half.  Over or under?  To be shown once?  On television.  No.  Three and a half times?  Right.  Will he be shown three times or four times?  Oh, all right.  Yes.  Yes what?  Way more than three times.  Really?  Yes.  Taking the over.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Oh, how do we get in on this?  This is easy money.  This is easy money right here. 
[02:01:00]  This is easy.  Will they show the David Tyree more than just a catch?  Oh.  More than one and a half times or less than one and a half times?  I think they'll only show it once.  Well, now what if they show it twice in one sitting?  Like they show it and then they show it in slow motion again.  That's more than once.  Yeah.  I'm going to say two.  Yeah.  They would not show a clip like that just one time.  There you go.  But they went with one and a half.  Start?  Wait, when will they show it though?  Did this count pre-game too?  Uh, kickoff to final whistle.  Oh.  Excluding halftime. 
[02:01:30]  They're going to show it pretty much at the start of the broadcast.  Right.  And we remember what happened when, yeah.  I don't know if they will during the actual game.  Oh, my God.  In the pre-game.  They could show it once.  I don't think they would show it twice.  I'll put $1,000 that they show it twice.  During the game?  Take it.  Yes.  Take it.  Wow.  You would make $1,000 at least.  It's plus 105.  They're going to pretty much start with that.  Say clams.  I'll say dollars.  Wait, in the actual broadcast or the pre-show?  During the broadcast.  During the pre-show, of course. 
[02:02:00]  From kickoff to final whistle.  All right, all right, all right.  Not including halftime.  All right.  All right, now I've got to think this.  During the game.  No, you already bet $1,000.  I took the bet.  Oh, shit.  Wow, that is a tough one now that I think about it.  I wasn't thinking.  Maybe once.  During the game.  Absolutely.  Bet with your head, not over it.  That's what I say.  During the game.  I never say that.  Oh, Chip.  I don't see him showing it twice.  No.  Ooh, what do you think?  Doctor doesn't think so.  That's a big fucking play.  What if there's a similar play that happens that they go, well, that's very reminiscent 
[02:02:30]  of this.  It'll be covered in the pre-game.  I cannot think of games in the Super Bowl where I've seen other Super Bowl clips being  shown during the live game.  Yeah, not more than once.  So that's an easy bet for you.  See, I put out a sign like this, too, where I said the same thing.  Yeah.  But I said 17.  Oh, dang.  That's Ted's betting emporium.  Will they or will they not show David Tyree coming from the bus more than 17 times? 
[02:03:00]  I'll take the over, Gregory.  Ted's amazing superbowl bets dot com.  Emporium.  Emporium.  Dot emporium.  Yes.  Start a trend.  Yeah.  Will the Dow Jones be up or down on Monday after the Super Bowl?  Historically, it's up.  Yeah.  I'd say up.  I'd say up.  Yeah.  Everyone's feeling good.  Yeah.  And then there's a bunch like, you know, who's the last to score a touchdown?  See, I had something very similar.  Will NASDAQ drop one of their letters in honor of the Super Bowl? 
[02:03:30]  The odds are 3,000 to 1 that they will.  Can I take that bet?  Certainly can, Anthony.  Poor Ted's going to get his legs broken.  Ted's going to get, yeah.  We can't pay out.  He's going to have to skip town.  Right.  Those lame bets.  I have one, too.  Will Al Michaels say cunt in the second quarter?  Angrily.  What's the line?  Well, I'm 30 to 1 odds that he will.  I believe he will angrily say it. 
[02:04:00]  Imagine something just happens to fall on his foot, though.  Yeah, you totally can't.  Or if he said it but happily and I was wrong.  Right.  He's all cunt.  You know what?  Why don't we print this out?  I might have people over for the Super Bowl myself.  Maybe we do a little betting.  You could take some of those bets, though.  Yeah, this is fun, buddy.  Who's going to finance it?  I don't.  You need a book.  You're going to be the house?  Yeah, I'll be the house.  Yeah, you're going to fucking pay out?  That doesn't mean that you're having the house where the Super Bowl is. 
[02:04:30]  No, that means you've got to put up the money.  Mike from Queens is back.  You've got to collect the money.  What?  He says, I'm calling back to explain how to lay money on each one's.  Oh, boy.  Lay money on each one's.  That's all right.  Do we need them?  Well, you asked how they figure out the odds for all of these.  Oh, here's Amanda from Ontario.  What does she know about football?  She lives in Canada.  She's a girl.  Amanda.  Hi, sorry.  Sorry.  You're ordering coffee, are you?  Hope so.  I am. 
[02:05:00]  I'm at Tim Hortons.  Yeah.  Boo.  Oh, boy.  You are Canadian.  Yeah, you are.  Welcome, Canadian.  Oh, thanks.  Stupid fucking Canadian.  How many celebrities will be shown on camera during the game?  Yeah.  How many breaks will they take for injuries?  Yeah.  Oh.  How many times will the show The Voice be advertised during commercial?  Oh, boy.  That's a biggie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be a big one.  And what corporate advertisement will be seeing the most? 
[02:05:30]  Like, will it be that E-Trade baby or Pepsi?  Or is it going to be a good Budweiser one?  Right.  Well, you are just full of information.  Yeah, I want to make some agents.  All right, Amanda.  Thank you so much.  I have one good bet.  Oh, yes, Ted.  Will there be a mistaken thing where the Rams show up instead of the New York Giants?  What if that happens?  How much can I make?  Two to one odds.  Two to one.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you, Amanda.  Thank you, Amanda.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  After the break, we got Ty West checking in.  Yes, Ty is the movie The Innkeepers, I guess, opening across the country.  Finally opening.  Oh, good for him.  Good for him is right.  I enjoyed that.  Not only that, I want to ask him a couple of questions about the things I hear.  Perhaps he went out to dinner last night with somebody that was pretty famous.  Ty did?  Yeah.  Let's get into it.  I'm hearing things.  Who?  Who?  What'd they have?  What was the appetizer?  I don't know.  He's calling from Radio Row, I think. 
[02:06:30]  One of the guys where he walked by the fucking windows.  Oh, did they?  Don't.  Please, please, if you care at all, don't talk to me today.  Please just let me get the fuck out of here.  I want a direct line to the elevator with nary a hello.  I think we should have a little meeting after management.  There's absolutely nothing they could say.  Yeah.  All right.  Ty West next.  Stay right where you are.  Series XM. 
[02:07:00]  Series XM.  The OPN Air TV Show.  Hey, we got to go right to the phone.  Ty West is on the line.  Hey, Ty.  Hey.  Ty, what's up, man?  I'm doing all right.  I had to set my alarm for this.  I wish I could have called into the replay.  Yeah.  Well, that is the coveted spot now for comedians and directors, actors, is to call into the  shit show, the after show.  It's much better to wake up a little later and do that, even though you don't get as many 
[02:07:30]  listeners, but who really cares?  I think that Sam has cornered the hangover market pretty well.  Yeah, the people that are just starting to stir, maybe in between waking up and vomiting,  they get to listen to.  And it could help with the vomiting a little bit.  Your program there.  Is Ty calling from L.A. or New York?  I'm in Chicago.  So speaking of vomiting, last night I was introduced to Malort, which is some disgusting kind of  liqueur that they like to drink here.  And by they, I'm sure it's just a practical joke on me. 
[02:08:00]  I'm sure nobody drinks it.  No.  What does it taste like?  That's what it tastes like.  Yeah, it's a gross liqueur.  It's as cheap as it can taste.  So that, in old style, went down pretty smoothly.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  So you are up a little early.  But I think you've got to go with the local drink wherever you are.  Yeah.  And obviously you're in Chicago promoting?  I am in Chicago promoting because the Innkeepers open today, Friday-wide, as they say. 
[02:08:30]  Although it's not wide.  It's Friday-limited.  Friday-limited.  But, yeah, I'm doing a Q&A tonight at the Music Box Theater at 7.20 is the Innkeepers.  And then at 9.45, they're showing my other film, The House of the Devil.  So it's like a double feature.  Oh, damn.  Nice.  So I've seen your Q&As, too.  And it's a little different than a lot of other directors that get up there and do Q&As.  You really, you're really honest.  I try to be. 
[02:09:00]  And you're honest with the people that ask the questions, which I like, because a lot  of times the directors up there are an actor and they take a stupid question from somebody  and they address it like it was a real intelligent question.  And you pretty much just are so sarcastic when somebody is being dumb in the audience.  Yeah.  I think after doing it for a while, you know, in the beginning you try to just be everyone's  friend.  And then after a while, you just get, they break you down.  So after a while, when someone asks something that's clearly insane, it's just silly not 
[02:09:30]  to acknowledge it.  Yeah.  And the audience seems to enjoy when somebody's getting a little bit of a bashing.  Yeah.  I enjoy Q&As.  I think it's kind of amusing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe I took something away from the way Kevin Smith does four-hour Q&As and I try to do  it in 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of there.  Now, what is this?  I'm hearing rumors.  Oh, you're so Hollywood these days, Ty.  What is this I hear about dinner last night or a little outing with Nicole Kidman? 
[02:10:00]  What is this?  Well, if you think I'm going to blow up my spot on the radio with that, you're out of  your mind.  So I loose lips think ships on that, but it was brunch.  Okay.  A little brunch.  A little brunch.  That's nice.  But yes, I'm not insane.  I can't.  What little, if I've learned nothing from Snooki, what little career that I have, I can't totally  implode right now on the radio.  Well, that's true.  But let me just ask you, is it something about maybe a future project?  It might be. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  All right.  We'll see.  Who knows?  But was there a little love in the air?  Now I can confirm that there was not.  No love in the air.  But yes, she's awesome.  I've actually met her twice.  So we'll see what happens.  That's pretty goddamn cool.  I can subvert to a different celebrity gossip, which I feel less concerned about, is that I  got a call the other day from Magnolia that's a certain family called to ask to borrow a  print of the movie to screen at their house.  And they made me guess who it was, which of course I couldn't.  And what it came down to in the end, it was the Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. 
[02:11:00]  So I can't imagine what they would have interest in the innkeepers, but I'm very curious to  hear how that plays out.  Well, I hear they want to remake it with an all-black cast.  I think that was the goal.  And of course, the next movie you're doing, Liv Tyler?  Yes, I actually just cast her recently.  Probably when I was there on the show last time, while I was in New York, I was sort  of getting that done.  So yeah, the space movie that I'm doing now has Liv Tyler in it. 
[02:11:30]  So things are moving along.  Yeah, no shit, huh?  We're doing something with you that's pretty fucking cool next week.  Although, me and Melissa have been talking about this, and I'm not a pussy enough, well  I am pussy enough to say that I'm a little frightened here.  I'm a little frightened.  I saw the innkeepers.  It's a lot of fun, but there's some moments in there that are authentically frightening  and very scary, very scary visuals.  The mood in the hotel, the Yankee Peddler, is very creepy. 
[02:12:00]  And now, we're going and actually staying in the hotel.  Yes.  Next week, I'm coming to the East Coast because the town of Torrenton, Connecticut wanted  to show the movie.  So there's an old theater across the street from the hotel, and they kind of resurrected  it to do this, and Magnolia hooked them up and said, sure, go ahead and show it.  And then before we knew it, in like less than two weeks, they sold 1,200 tickets.  Wow.  Jesus.  So it turned into a whole thing, and now they wanted us to be there, but since they 
[02:12:30]  sold so many tickets, we said, okay, so me and the cast are coming back, and we're all  going to go up for that.  And that's on Wednesday, and so I, you know, open invitation to anyone who wants to come  because I think it's going to be a really weird thing because not only are you going  to see the movie, when you're done with the movie, you're going to walk across the street  into where the movie happened.  So it's sort of like our own kind of Universal Studios ride, but yeah, it's going to be  really surreal because I think we're having the party at the actual hotel, and I don't  know if that's, that's probably never happened before with the movie, so it's a pretty unique 
[02:13:00]  event.  I wouldn't think so.  I did that with The Shining.  We stayed up at The Overlook, and we got to see Scatman Crothers.  They had him lay there the whole time for the party.  With an axe in his chest.  And sat by his feet.  By those big feet.  Oh shit, now that's, that is, you've stayed in that hotel, obviously, when you were filming  a previous movie, right?  Yeah, I've stayed there twice, and I've done about, all in all, almost four months at that  hotel.  And it's creepy. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, it kind of is.  I think it's kookier more than it is scary, I think, so I don't think, I think you'll be  all right, and that's what I'll work for.  But it's a strange place, and especially just after watching the movie, it's going to be  the kind of thing, you're standing there looking around, and then.  The staff that works there wears the same clothes as they do in the movie, so that will be  weird.  Oh shit.  And the actors will be there.  It'll be a really kind of unique, kind of once-in-a-lifetime experience, so I think it  should be pretty cool.  That is very odd.  I really can't wait to do that.  So are you going to be in New York next Wednesday? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, I get in Tuesday, I'm there Tuesday through Friday, so I'm trying to do a lot while  I'm in town.  It should be a good trip.  Why don't you pop in late on the show on Wednesday, and we'll just all leave together  or something?  Yeah, that'd be awesome.  That would work out well.  Cool, man.  How far from New York is this place?  Two hours?  At most, yeah.  Are you staying over?  Yeah.  It's under 100 miles, so it's not a bad trip.  I think the way you drive, you could do it pretty quick.  Yeah, I probably could.  I swear, I am a faggot when it comes to this stuff, and I am going to really be scared.  Why don't you say that about anything? 
[02:14:30]  I'm scared.  I think I'm going to be scared.  Yeah, it'll be.  I mean, I'm curious to see.  I mean, we might just sort of have to get drunk, but I'll be curious to see what you  think of the whole place.  It's interesting.  Like I said, it's so rare that you get to sort of see a movie and then walk across the  street, just like the first shot of the movie you just saw.  Yeah.  Be in the environment.  That is like a weird thing, and I think it's going to make it even creepier, because seeing  the movie and then going right in and seeing some of these locations like that is pretty  creepy. 
[02:15:00]  But I can't be too scared in front of Sarah, because that's kind of faggy.  She'd probably laugh at me.  She would.  And then fart, because she's a cute girl that farts.  It's just the worst thing you could ever imagine.  Like, of everything that she's got going for her, and then that, it just, it kills you.  But yeah, she'll be there with her unique brand of humor, I'm sure.  I think it closes the deal, to tell you the truth.  Well, it's his own. 
[02:15:30]  All right, Ty, I'll see you next Wednesday, then, and good luck with the opening.  This is fantastic, man.  I'm very happy for you.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for letting me come on and hawk my wares a little more.  I appreciate it.  No problem, man.  What do you got going on one more time in Chicago?  Tonight at the Music Box in Chicago, a double feature of The Innkeepers and House of the  Devil.  Starts at 7.20.  I'll be there for a Q&A.  Next week, we've got the Peddler event in Torrington, Connecticut.  And as of today, the movie is out in theaters. 
[02:16:00]  So, you know, if you're in a major city, please go check it out.  If not, VOD it, and we'd appreciate it.  Great, man.  That's awesome.  Ty West, director of The Innkeepers in movie theaters right now.  Thanks, Ty.  Thanks a lot, man.  See you, bro.  All right.  That was a Friday movie.  I kind of want to stay in that hotel.  Yeah, it's like...  I would like to do that.  Like, that's kind of an eerie, creepy vibe.  It's an old hotel.  It's a...  You know, it's not like you're going to a Holiday Inn.  It's very creaky and old school.  I don't know.  I get fucking... 
[02:16:30]  I do get the heebie-jeebies.  I don't get scared that a ghost is going to come out literally and do that.  But people will laugh at you.  I just get this heebie-jeebies.  They'll laugh at you.  You don't like when people laugh at you.  They'll laugh at you.  I know.  I don't like when they all laugh at me.  You should videotape yourself.  I am going to videotape a lot of stuff.  And I'm going to try to see if I could get a spook on my camera.  What?  A spook.  I'm going to try to videotape a spook on the camera and see and put it online because... 
[02:17:00]  Drive-thru Hartford.  Is Hartford haunted?  No, I'm just saying.  Hartford's on the way to where you're going.  That's all I'm saying.  Is it or no?  Is it after?  And there's...  Hmm.  Hmm.  It's a joke.  Right?  I don't know.  I want to know how far this place is.  Wait a minute.  I was just going.  All right.  We were working on a little chemistry there.  He was talking about spooks and I was just telling him how to get to where he has to  be.  That's all.  Boo!  But that's cool. 
[02:17:30]  I absolutely look at Ty like being in the situation Peter Jackson was in for years.  Like making these types of movies, very creepy, but with a twist of humor to him and stuff.  And he's a young director.  He's working his way up.  I think this kid's going to go far.  He's already gone far.  I know.  And he's just starting.  Yep.  I have one request.  Don't shoot anyone because you're so scared.  I never really talk about my arms or anything like that, but I won't. 
[02:18:00]  I won't be shooting anybody in Connecticut.  Right.  Yeah.  Believe me.  Yeah.  I know.  All right.  Let's do a single break and we're going to do best man speeches next.  Oh, no, no.  I do have something.  Black history going into break.  Oh, that's right.  We've neglected it.  Show's racist.  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show recognizes some of the individuals whose contributions have shaped the African-American community and changed all of us for the better. 
[02:18:30]  On this day, we honor Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy McMillan entered the political world and with one simple phrase, changed the landscape forever.  With his odd facial hair, stereotypical dialect, and inexplicable rants, he has given black people everywhere not only a political alternative, but a role model.  Rent.  It's too damn high.  Thank you, Jimmy McMillan.  Without you, people everywhere would be satisfied overpaying their rent. 
[02:19:00]  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions for Black History Month here on the Opie and Anthony show.  SiriusXM.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Heading toward the weekend.  What a happy song this is.  I like that one.  This is a happy one. 
[02:19:30]  We got best man speeches.  I think we did a pretty good job today, considering we're not down at the Super Bowl.  We're not?  Or across, wherever the fuck.  I think we did pretty good.  We said what we had to say, and then we moved on, Sam.  After an hour?  Was it an hour?  Yeah.  But you're still mentioning it.  It's fair.  I thought it was hilarious, too.  Yeah, there was some...  My God.  There was some funny in there.  My God, man. 
[02:20:00]  Some.  Not a lot.  I know.  Moved on.  Next week, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kevin Smith in the studio on Tuesday.  Cool.  And then Daryl Hammond on Wednesday.  Ah.  I'm going to have my Kareem photo signed.  Star-studded.  Yeah, I was sorry.  Where'd you get a Kareem photo?  Last time Kareem came by.  Oh.  No, no, no.  You didn't see my Kareem photo?  No, no, no.  You're a dick.  No.  I was really jealous.  That one got to me.  Yeah.  When Jimmy got his Kareem Abdul-Jabbar photo.  But now we get a chance next week. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Look at that.  He's a monster.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Isn't that unbelievable?  I just want to talk about Airplane.  I want to talk about Bruce Lee.  Ah, right.  Yes.  And meditation.  That should be a good 20 minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could talk about it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Ooh, the doctor is in.  My ass.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Voice is attractive, man.  Oh, very good voice.  There's a doctor in the house.  So what's gayer? 
[02:21:00]  We like to have fun here.  And now he's making me gay.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I didn't know about that.  Travis comes in, sits down.  Oh, but you guys missed the best part.  Travis already was in.  I know.  Sat down.  He's been hanging a couple minutes.  And then Iraq out of nowhere.  And you know what's great?  Pretty much in the middle of our conversation.  Well, you probably told Iraq a long time ago that he should play the Dr. Gay music from  his room, right?  I just told him. 
[02:21:30]  What?  Two minutes ago.  During the last break?  He came in and he goes, hey, the guys put together a Dr. Gay thing.  I'm like, all right, you play it.  But he waits for Travis to come in, sit down, get comfortable, and then boom.  Iraq, do you feel you can never do anything right?  Yeah, because had I done it while you were talking about Jimmy's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar photo,  I would have got yelled at for going over, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  So I was waiting for him.  Wait, who would have yelled at you?  I don't know, Jim or you or Ann.  I would have yelled at you.  So what are you talking about? 
[02:22:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  It turned David.  There's a picture of him disavowing any knowledge of his actions here.  Whoa.  Look at him at the White House.  Whoa.  Is that his Facebook page?  Of course it's his Facebook page.  It's his Facebook page.  It's his picture.  He is fantastic.  He looks like he could be an assassin.  I know, right?  No, I don't look like I could be an assassin. 
[02:22:30]  I miss him.  He was funny.  Okay, all right.  That's a game.  Best man speeches?  Yeah.  What do we got?  Oh, that's why Travis is in.  Yeah, just in case you need, you know.  The doctor is in.  There it is.  His prescription for gay.  Pass it down.  No, you fucked it up again.  The doctor is in.  My ass.  The voice is an attractive man with a very good voice. 
[02:23:00]  I'm talking to you.  There's a doctor in the house.  He's just off.  So what's gayer?  We like to have fun here.  And now he's making me gay.  Oh, no.  Is that when you fell off the chair?  It certainly was.  He broke the chair.  He broke the chair.  That one's great.  Yeah.  What a moment.  You really enjoyed that one.  Oh, yeah.  It's like a chair to just death.  Oh.  Let that one go.  Oh, what happened, Chip?  I wish you had a good one.  Oh, let's go to the Super Bowl. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah?  I'll take the soup.  He just pushed Travis with his forearm.  I hate that move.  It's the creepiest thing.  So are we picking a winner today?  Pick a winner.  Well, I mean, you can.  We're not supposed to pick a winner until next week.  Well, the entry date is done, right?  Yeah.  We're done with that.  So we have our entrance.  But now we have to pick a winner.  Where's the winner win?  Take us to the Super Bowl?  $1,000.  Oh, okay. 
[02:24:00]  From Steven Singer Jewelers.  Okay.  But you don't have to spend $1,000 at Steven Singer Jewelers.  No, he's just giving you a grand.  You can buy drugs with it if you want.  You should spend $1,000.  Oh, I should buy drugs with it.  You should buy drugs.  They can buy some of my loose diamonds that Steven Singer mails to me.  You have to fuck a bow tie.  What is that?  Oh, my.  That's when I told him to dress up because we were moving.  David with a giant clown-like polka-dotted yellow bow tie.  Yeah, I know we were a bow tie. 
[02:24:30]  Thank God we have to now treat the interns with respect, and with only respect.  Of course.  Thank God.  Anthony, our first contestant in the worst man speech.  Yeah.  Or the best man, worst speech.  Worst best man.  Worst best man speech.  And you know, you're talking about these big guests we've got coming in next week.  You didn't mention who's coming in on Monday.  I won't be here.  I'm so bummed.  You're not going to be here Monday?  You're not going to be here Monday?  Oh, man.  You're missing that one?  You're going to be here Monday?  No, the Monday you're talking about is the 13th. 
[02:25:00]  What?  Who?  Dr. Gay.  No, that's not what I'm talking about.  What?  Oh, what are you talking about?  You're not going to be here Monday?  This Monday, I will.  Who's this Monday?  Steven Singer.  Oh, see, I thought you meant...  Oh.  Oh.  Boo!  Boo!  Is he going to bring that assistant there that he brings usually?  Leigh-Anne?  I don't see why not.  Because she's quite a dish.  Actually, I...  As they call an attractive woman a dish.  She will be here. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  That's good.  Kevin G. Beck is our first finalist.  Kevin G. Beck.  It says, this is from my wedding on September 11th, 2001.  Oh, boy.  No way.  Boy, that would be a wedding ruiner, wouldn't it?  What?  It wasn't 2001?  No.  Oh, you're reading her on.  Oh.  What a bummer that would be.  You don't cancel your wedding?  Everyone just has to fuck you.  Especially if it's in lower Manhattan.  Yeah.  Your pictures are taken with just collapsing buildings in the background. 
[02:26:00]  Everyone's just dusty.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Wedding gown's all dusty.  My brother, who is five years older than me, was asked to say a few words as the best  man.  The awkward silence after me saying thank you is the rest of our guests.  I'm expecting a few more words than actually came out.  It took the DJ a few moments to realize that this was all there was going to be.  Oh.  Okay.  So this is one of the much too short.  Yeah.  This one's much too short.  None of them are good. 
[02:26:30]  Epic.  What?  I don't know.  I think Epic's a little overused.  I think it was just a fail.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's epic.  It's epic.  It's epic.  Here's Kevin G. Beck.  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to call him our best man, Brian.  Let's give him a big round of applause and give us a toast.  Come on.  That's bringing him up.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd ask you to please rise at your seat with champagne glass in hand.  Once again, he's your best man, Brian. 
[02:27:00]  From your table.  Here she comes.  Here she comes.  Kevin and Carol, many years of happiness and health.  Thank you.  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to take you back to your best man, Brian.  Come on.  Ah, many years of happiness and health.  Wow.  How inspiring.  The end. 
[02:27:30]  That was useless.  That's like something somebody just leans over to the bride and groom with a glass and goes,  hey, many years of happiness and health.  That's not the best man's speech.  That's stunk.  Isn't that the punchline or the last thing you say?  Yeah.  That's the last thing he said.  Yeah, that's the slug line.  That's the only thing he said.  That's the end of his fucking big, long speech.  You end with the slug line.  That was terrible.  Oh!  Whoa!  Whoa, whoa!  We got a heart of work.  I'm in the office, whoa! 
[02:28:00]  The first month of his internship where he was told he had to wear the shirt that said  young, dumb, and full of cum everywhere he went.  And every day he...  And we wonder why he doesn't want to be associated with this place.  And every day he would get to work and put on the young, dumb, and full of cum shirt.  Young, dumb, and full of cum shirt.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Why do I got to wear this?  Whoa!  That's him working on the kosher sports report.  I love the kosher sports report.  Ah, remember that?  Play one of those during the 10 o'clock. 
[02:28:30]  Oy vey!  Now we're not even allowed to make eyes at the interns.  We're not even allowed to acknowledge they're walking around among us.  It's crazy now.  Clayton Jacoby was our next contestant or finalist.  Jacoby, probably.  Jacoby.  Jacoby.  Jacoby.  I'm dumb.  Jacoby, of course.  Clayton Jacoby.  This is from my wedding, he writes.  I'm the groom of the wedding, and Dave was my best man.  It's really funny.  It was going to be on Tosh.0, but I couldn't make it due to it being a last-second request. 
[02:29:00]  Oh!  Really?  That's what he says.  We're getting Tosh's sloppy seconds.  That's great.  Will Tosh ever do the show?  No, I wouldn't think so.  Why?  He's way too big.  That's insulting.  We have Nicolas Cage come in.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  You have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Steven Singer.  What's the...  Steven Singer.  He's not that famous...  Oh, shit.  Don't get mad.  I don't know.  We probably have a mind.  Do we trash him? 
[02:29:30]  I don't think we trashed him.  I don't think you've ever trashed him.  We've never trashed him.  All right, then.  So we should do our show.  Tosh is on the very short list of people you haven't trashed.  Oh, man.  True.  Maybe he could call up an after show or something.  He's welcome to.  Let's get the Tosh on the show.  I don't appreciate that you called it an after show.  Could Roland explain why the Tosh hasn't been on the show yet?  He's interviewed me.  Has he?  At the comedy festival a couple years ago.  All right, let's get the Tosh.  Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm listening through the wall with a cuppa to my ear, making a funny face.  Whoa! 
[02:30:00]  When Steve used to have private phone calls in his office, we used to have David put a cup up to the door and looked at him.  He's a young, dumb, and full of cum.  To try to hear what he was saying?  Oh, yeah.  Do you think those were important phone calls?  No, of course.  Why don't we Tosh through the show?  He's trying to come in April when he's here doing his Radio City gig.  Oh.  All right.  All the David pictures look like, they look like stills from bad, like, dinner theater plays.  Oh, my God.  You get weird things when you Google image intern David Opie and Anthony. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know what that's about.  That isn't even.  You look like a homie.  Yeah, I'm kind of going, mm-hmm.  You said that wrong.  Homie?  A homo.  He looks like a homo.  A homo.  Let's listen to Clayton Jacoby.  Yeah.  Very good.  Our next finalist.  All right.  For those of you who don't know me, I'm Dave.  I'm the best man, obviously.  I've been doing Clayton and Alicia for a little while. 
[02:31:00]  So, good while.  But, um, just wanted to say that, um...  Oh, boy.  I'm not picking on speeches.  Uh, I can personally say that, uh...  Uh-huh.  All right.  Um...  Well, I've been cleaning Alicia for a long time. 
[02:31:30]  Speech isn't really working out, obviously.  Um, I just wanted to say that, uh...  We've been getting up for a while, and, uh...  We've seen them together.  We're always happy.  And, uh...  We'll just, like, wish them luck, and I know they'll...  Have a good many years behind them.  And, uh...  Behind them?  Like, wish them luck, so, uh, here's the...  Clayton and Alicia in years. 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  That is an immense bombing.  Holy shit.  That was terrible.  It's people's greatest fears.  Yeah, yes, yes.  And that's why.  That's it.  There's no reason why I should continue.  He freaked out.  You know he was freaking the whole time, thinking that he even had to do it.  And he didn't have it written down, obviously.  No, no. 
[02:32:30]  But people are so nice at weddings, they always...  Your first awful joke, I'm nervous.  Ah, yeah, they'll laugh.  Yeah, that's okay.  But then, wow, he really went right into the shitter.  Clayton Jacoby was not good.  He might be in the lead.  But it should be mentioned that...  I don't think it was good enough for Tosh.  No.  I think he might have been making that part of the story up.  What did the video look like?  I didn't see the video.  Exactly.  But it was good.  Maybe there was a fucked pussy on the table next time.  Holy hope.  I think Chip's going to like the next one. 
[02:33:00]  Wayne...  Manneke.  Manneke.  Oh, I know him.  Wayne Manneke.  Manneke.  He's a good guy.  Manneke.  Is he funny?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  Hilarious.  Man, we're going local with this one.  Oh!  Really local.  I know where this is.  I've attended a couple of weddings at the Thatched Cottage.  This is from my wedding reception to my wife, Suzanne, at the Thatched Cottage in Centerport,  Long Island.  Yeah.  Oh!  The hometown of Greg Opie Hughes.  Ooh!  On June 29th, 2000, my brother Tom was my best man. 
[02:33:30]  The day was perfect.  The ceremony was magical.  The setting on the harbor was picturesque.  Then my brother gives this cringeworthy best man speech.  I guess he thought my wedding was a roast.  His douche-chilly joke delivery, the uncomfortable silence of the guests, and lukewarm applause  at the end speak for itself.  Oh, boy.  This is Wayne Manneke.  This is a good one.  Another finalist.  Oh, what can I say about my brother Wayne and his new wife Suzanne? 
[02:34:00]  I'm not saying he's an ugly kid or anything, but when he was born, my father slapped my mother.  Yeah, when he was growing up, he was a pretty ugly kid.  He was so ugly, when he worked at the pet shop, they used to ask him how big he'd get.  But he doesn't look anything like he used to, though.  It's been about five years since he stuck his head out the window and got arrested for mooning. 
[02:34:30]  Seriously, though, he's a good-looking guy now, but I know why tigers eat their young.  Oh!  That's stage appeal, right?  Suzanne, the good, uh, really, I can't believe you picked Suzanne as a wife.  It says, what a great choice.  Suzanne is one of the smartest girls you'll ever meet.  She got into a car accident the other day.  She hit a tree.  She said it wasn't her fault.  She blew the horn.  And Suzanne, Suzanne, Suzanne, what a sweet girl.  It's one of the sweetest girls you'll ever meet. 
[02:35:00]  When she was ten years old, her father bought her a bow and arrow set.  She turns around, she buys him a t-shirt with a bullseye in the back.  And, Wayne, if you're worried about getting a good meal every night, don't.  Suzanne is the best cook.  The best cook ever.  Don't kill it.  But, uh, I don't know.  I don't think Meatloaf is supposed to go all in the dark.  What do you guys think?  And if they had a, I can't speak for everyone, of course, if they had a dog, he'd probably  be the only one that bakes for Alka-Seltzer.  Uh, and, uh, we went over to the house the other day, opened up the cabinets, the cockroaches 
[02:35:30]  to hang themselves, not to mention all the flies shipped in and got their screens fixed.  What?  Uh.  I think you're a fool.  Uh.  Hold on, hold on.  This is my speech.  I hope he wasn't here.  Uh, I'm all serious, yes, before I continue. 
[02:36:00]  Um, in all truth, I do love you both very much, and I do want to wish you the best health,  love, and happiness that your marriage can offer.  And with that, Dwayne and Suzanne.  Oh, my God, I'm so uncomfortable.  First of all, it was verbatim.  He just took a Rodney routine.  Right.  That everybody knows.  Yeah.  Those are famous jokes.  Yeah.  I don't think meatloaf should glow in the dark.  Yeah, he took Rodney's fucking act.  Yeah, my dog, he begs for Alka-Seltzer. 
[02:36:30]  That's hilarious.  This guy stunk.  I only recognize a couple of Dangerfields in there.  Everyone.  The flies chipping over the screen door fixed.  Yeah.  Uh, the dog begging for Alka-Seltzer.  Uh, uh, what was the couple of the other ones he did?  Every one of them I recognized.  The roaches hanging themselves?  Roaches, yeah.  The dental floss, the roaches hang themselves.  A couple other ones.  All Rodney.  She didn't even write a guy.  Uh, she's not, uh, oh yeah, she hit a tree, she blew the horn.  Uh, there was also, you know, there was also, my wife, she hit a deer, it was in the zoo. 
[02:37:00]  Do you think he was lacking in delivery?  Everything about it stunk.  He stole two jokes that are way too famous to take.  Yeah.  Which one do you like better?  That guy?  That guy was more awful.  First guy was charming and nervous and just a frightened man.  He was just scary.  This guy, they were actually, nobody wants to hear it.  Like, they hated his guts.  Yeah, the woman that goes, no one wants to hear it.  They hated his guts.  It's my speech here, no one wants to hear it. 
[02:37:30]  The other guy they all felt bad for because he was just a nervous Nelly.  Well, we're going with worse, so.  Yeah, this guy was terrible.  We'll have the winners next week, I guess.  That's one of the worst, that was worse than our Bud Dwyer speech.  It should have ended the same way.  You guys want one last one?  Yes.  The final finalist in our worst best man speech.  Thanks to Steven Singer.  This is, uh, Sean Ryan.  Speech starts off with a bad joke and then derails into some of the worst name calling in a speech, really?  Oh no.  Yeah, this is, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Is this really good?  There's some name calling.  Oh, by the way, put his head out the window, get arrested for moaning.  All Rodney.  All Rodney.  People actually wanted to fight him.  Apparently.  And were rushing up to get him.  He was booed heavily at one point.  Oh man.  So this guy's going to win.  We don't know that.  Let's see.  We can't get clear on the winner.  You guys are the judge.  This is Sean Ryan.  First, I like to give praise to all of them.  Huh?  That's fucking funny, man. 
[02:38:30]  Come on.  That's fucking funny.  He's got me.  Holy shit.  How is this the worst?  I'd be cracking up if I was sitting at that wedding.  This isn't the worst.  It probably wasn't appropriate for the crowd.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  What is the criteria of the worst?  Just horrible, uncomfortable, stinks.  Yeah.  I mean, one good line doesn't mean it's good.  All right.  And no one. 
[02:39:00]  That wasn't the audience.  You know.  Yeah.  It's funny to us.  It's hilarious.  It's not funny to the wedding, I guess.  All right.  First, I like to give praise to Allah.  Second, what the fuck were you thinking getting married on football Sunday?  You're lucky the Jets are off.  I won't be here, you goddamn tongue dumpster.  Holy shit. 
[02:39:30]  Where does he live?  I'm running the check.  I don't give a fuck if he wins now.  This should be in the contest.  Species that rule.  Holy shit.  Did he say cum dumpster?  And fuck in the opening sentence.  Cum dumpster.  And it's so appropriate that he's a Jets fan.  What an idiot.  That's a Jets fan.  I gotta go back.  The cum dumpster.  I want to hear.  Yeah, the cum dumpster part. 
[02:40:00]  You're only 20 seconds in.  Damn.  Second?  What the fuck were you thinking getting married on football Sunday?  You're lucky the Jets are off.  I won't be here, you goddamn cum dumpster.  Also, what's so special about this stuff?  Under 75 bucks?  Are you kidding me?  Damn, for that price, the pants should have came in with a built-in midget sucking the  stuff out of my head.  I can't understand that.  He's saying with the tucks, the pants should have come with a built-in midget sucking his 
[02:40:30]  cock.  Did he say that?  Yes, a built-in midget.  I can't hear the rate.  I don't even disagree.  It's a good point.  Holy crap.  You know, most guys change when they date someone for a while.  But now in this case, Sean's the same butt pirate I've known for years.  For those of you that don't know Sean too well, here's a few words to describe him. 
[02:41:00]  Dick Smoker, Dirt Burglar, Great Guy, Knob Jockey, Good Friend, Ass Genie, and finally  Half the Pornhole.  In fact, this is the first motherfucker I've ever seen wearing cum gutters.  Wearing cum gutters?  First motherfucker I've ever seen wearing cum gutters.  This is at a wedding.  Is that so much funny? 
[02:41:30]  Holy shit.  Is that so much funny?  You can't say this shit.  Holy fuck.  Oh, is that hilarious?  Oh.  Oh my god.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  You like this one?  He's filthy.  Dick Smoker, Dirt Burglar, Great Guy, Knob Jockey, Good Friend, Ass Genie, and finally  Captain Pornhole.  In fact, this is the first motherfucker I've ever seen wearing cum gutters. 
[02:42:00]  There's so many funny stories with this cum guzzler that it was getting hammered apart.  So many funny stories with this cum guzzler.  Now the crowd is definitely turning on us.  They're just uncomfortable.  You can hear they're like, oh, oh.  I have a feeling this guy don't give a shit, though.  No.  He don't give a fuck.  There's a father who's there for his daughter's wedding.  Oh, shit.  Right, right.  Who invited all his clients.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:42:30]  My daughter's getting married today to a cum guzzler.  This is part of the video.  The toast has to be part of the video.  Of course.  Oh, I love to see this.  He's the best man of all the men that the groom knows.  He's the best man.  He's the best man.  Imagine the ones that didn't make the cut.  That guy in Russia who killed all the kids.  There's so many funny stories with this cum guzzler.  Whether it was getting hammered at parties and stealing people's family photos.  Or just drinking a prank in the phone booth. 
[02:43:00]  They would get drunk at people's houses and steal the family photos.  That's fucking funny.  All the minutes someone else's house get drunk.  And then you'd walk out with the family photos.  Steal the family photos.  They'd have another family stolen photos in their apartment.  Oh, fuck.  Family photos.  We're just drinking and pranking the phone booth.  We always had a good time. 
[02:43:30]  I don't know if you remember the time we were at a party and I was walking down the steps.  When I heard a rumble.  Before I had a chance to turn around.  I was knocked down the steps.  And spilled beer bottle.  I get up and do knock me down.  Show me.  He fell down the steps.  Took me down with him.  And there was a time also when the movies were waiting for him to start.  He tries to run around.  There's a story.  There's so cute. 
[02:44:00]  And a story went nowhere.  I was going down the steps.  And he fell.  And I fell down the steps.  And then there was this time.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to lead to something.  One time your new husband got drunk and he fell down the stairs and he fell into me.  That would have been a good story if he opened with it.  People probably would have laughed.  But after this sperm guzzler.  Oh, sperm guzzler.  He fell down the steps.  Took me down with him.  And there was a time also at the movies we were waiting for it to start.  He tries to run around to drink real quick before the movie starts. 
[02:44:30]  He falls down those steps too.  Throwing like 60 people.  Sean's not the most graceful person in the world.  But it's not his fault.  Best part of him was swallow.  Shannon, I honestly don't know where you're seeing him.  Don't be still thinks wrestling is real.  In fact, he wants to wrestle again.  Nothing like prancing around a ring with tights on and a tulip in your ear. 
[02:45:00]  Playing where's the sausage with grown ass men.  Where's the sausage?  What?  And playing where's the sausage with grown ass men.  Oh, man.  With grown ass men.  But in all seriousness, Sean's always been there for me.  No matter what I needed, he's been there.  Even the time I was at primetime and I was about to get in a fight with a bunch of guys.  I called up Sean and he was sleeping.  But he didn't even ask why or for what reason he just showed up. 
[02:45:30]  He showed up looking like Elvis with his hair all screwed up while he was there.  You guys ended up leaving anyhow, but it was just an example of he did it no matter what.  What was the point?  The guys left anyway, but it was just an example of he'll show up no matter what.  No matter what.  And the reason he was showing up was because this guy needed to beat the shit out of some guys.  And he showed up with his hair looking like Elvis all fucked up. 
[02:46:00]  But they left.  But then they left.  This guy has great stories.  I love it.  We've got to get him on the air.  He'd be there no matter what.  In conclusion, Sean, you're the best friend I've ever had.  We've had so many great times together.  We know I've always been there for you.  You're lucky to marry Shannon.  She's truly a great catch.  You have yourself a great wife here.  I'm so happy for you guys. 
[02:46:30]  We wish you the best of luck.  So, everybody raise your glass and toast the newlyweds.  Now, is the edited version?  Because it says in the description he was booed.  Yeah, no.  He was kind of in the middle.  Yeah, maybe like 30 seconds in.  Oh, okay.  I thought the booing was a lot louder than that.  The synopsis of his speech was, your husband is gay and falls down a lot.  Yeah.  But he'll come if you call.  Yeah, but if you call. 
[02:47:00]  I'm dying to see what that guy looks like.  I want to get that guy, the best man, to come on the show and tell stories.  Yeah, he's got some great ones.  They go nowhere.  The guy, they went home anyway, but.  Yeah.  You just get the audio or did they send the video in?  I just got audio.  I can email these people and see if they can get the video.  I can see the video of that.  Sure.  Jay Boz.  Hiya, Boz.  I'm being on Radio Row.  Hey, were you down in Radio Row for the Super Bowl?  Yeah, what the fuck am I doing talking to Covino and Rich? 
[02:47:30]  Why is Sirius XM sending these to me?  Oh, exactly.  Oh, you want to know why?  Well, you're never going to know why.  I just said I want to know why.  What are we arguing about?  We have no idea why we weren't sent down there.  They told us they wanted to protect us from going on Radio Row because it's like a bunch  of stations and we're so good and valuable to the company that they didn't want to waste  us there.  Yeah.  I'm sitting with Covino and Rich talking, you know.  Yeah, but. 
[02:48:00]  I'm down with the mad dog.  Let me tell you something, folks.  You're not out of it.  You lose four games in a best of seven series.  Let's go back to the polls.  We got Michael at Bayside.  Michael, how are you?  How are you doing, dog?  Long time listener.  First time caller.  Hey, thanks for coming aboard, Mike.  Appreciate you.  I hear what I'm doing for you.  That's right.  Right on the money.  I got to talk to Dino Costa, the fucking Harvey Keitel of sports radio.  Jesus, that's an angry man.  Oh, really?  I don't know him.  Yeah, we don't know him. 
[02:48:30]  Holy moly, he is angry.  Yeah.  He's a shock jock, but he's for real.  Oh, really?  What is he, just mean and nasty?  He's just been wronged by the system, and he's on Mad Dog's channel, but it's like his  whole thing is, he shakes the tree, and he kind of takes a lot.  I like the show, to be honest with you.  When I listen to it driving around, in my car, I listen.  I've never heard of him.  In my car.  I've heard the show.  But then he'll just be like, you know, Mad Dog, don't choose a side. 
[02:49:00]  He's a bum.  And he'll play clips from Chris's show, and then I'm like, it's probably not the best  career move, you know, considering it's the Mad Dog channel, you dope.  Who do you see down there on Radio Row over there?  Saw Chrissy Teigen.  Who's that?  Swims, some whore.  Did you see Joe Montana?  I was going to give you a nice buildup, and I realized, to me, what the fuck do I?  Some fucking dopey girl. 
[02:49:30]  She was nice.  She's like a swimsuit monster.  Oh, she's John Legend's fiancée.  Oh, okay.  You see Tim Tebow?  I saw Tebow, a piece of Tebow's hat, and he was surrounded by like 40,000 bodyguards and  stuff.  Wow.  Anthony, if Bono walked through there, I'm not even kidding.  If Bono walked through there holding Sinatra's hand, there would be half of what happened  when Tebow walked in.  Wow. 
[02:50:00]  Just crazy, right?  Yeah, and they're going to make him a crazy person, because at some point, you've got  to just walk down the fucking street and go to the store.  Yeah.  And this guy, I mean, he was blowing off Jim Rome.  He was blowing off, he just did the NFL Network, and then Madonna walked in.  I'm like, Jesus, when did Willem Dafoe get here?  I heard you called her that, and I heard.  Yeah, Jimmy told us that earlier.  That's hilarious.  She took out the Joe Weider bench. 
[02:50:30]  She was showing us.  She was ready to go.  That dude looks hot.  She looks good for an old man.  So wait, Tim Tebow only did the NFL Network?  Pretty much.  I was on a San Francisco station.  No, he did Sway, too.  He did Sway.  He did Sway, too.  He did Sway.  He did Sway.  Our neighbors here at SiriusXM.  Who, Sway?  Oh, he did Sway.  I know that much, because there was a picture that was tweeted.  I saw Sway, and he looked me right in the eye.  And you know, there's always like the, hey, how you doing? 
[02:51:00]  I'm like, hey, I'm in show business.  You're in show business.  Just that little look.  And he looked at me like, motherfucker, you ain't in show business.  I'm Sway.  Oh, shit.  What'd you do?  Did you tell him you're in show business?  Oh, I don't give a shit.  And then I walked past him, and then I sat down with my new homies.  Artrell, Artrell, Artrell, white guy.  Artrell Hawkins played for the Patriots and the Bengals.  And he's like an old, he's retired, and now he's like an old school. 
[02:51:30]  You know when pimps are so manly, like they're really effeminate?  Yeah.  He's like, hey, what's up, baby?  And he calls himself A-Hawk, because his last name is Hawkins.  And his little brother won, Michael Irvin had some weird show, Fourth and Long.  And like, you want a reality show to be on an NFL team?  But his little brother actually made the Bengals and returned kicks.  He's fucking 5'6", and he's Baby Hawk. 
[02:52:00]  And I'm talking to him, and I was just engulfed in like this.  And all of a sudden, I was like this honorary black guy.  They're like, man, it was Fox Sports.  I think they're like, man, you Jayhawk.  You with us now.  You go ride with us.  And I'm just, you know.  You know, Jimmy, you get so happy when black people think you're cool.  You're like, I'm Jayhawk.  Right, guys?  Oh, God.  Like their little mascot you become.  Even though more accurate would have been Chicken Hawk. 
[02:52:30]  I said that.  I said you should go, God damn, you're funny.  And was that Sam that was running those clips with you guys?  What clips?  The best man's?  Yeah.  Well, Sam talked a little.  Travis, why?  What's up?  Because somebody laughed exactly like Brewer.  And I got all excited that Brewer was in.  Ah.  I don't know.  Holy shit.  That one.  Hey, I Google imaged that girl.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, hot.  Yeah, she's hot.  Hot with a touch of bounds. 
[02:53:00]  She's got like, she's a bit exotic.  A little exotic.  I would say maybe a little Hawaiian.  I don't like exotic.  She's black and tight.  Anthony liked him.  Look at this, man.  Right out of central casting.  Skinny and white with boobs.  That's just like white trashy girls.  Come on, look at that.  You're not a junk in the trunk guy, right?  No, not really, no.  You're like me.  I want my wife to look like a 15-year-old boy.  I'd rather have a 15-year-old boy. 
[02:53:30]  No, who wouldn't?  But I mean, I can't say it on radio.  Sue everybody.  Sue everybody.  With child molester.  Jay Moore is playing Foxwood.  Foxwoods.  Exactly 200 tickets left.  Damn, let's get them sold.  Now, man, Foxwoods is great.  That's a good thing to check out before the Super Bowl.  Hells yeah.  Night before, right?  Saturday night?  Yeah, Saturday night.  Tonight I'm at Borgata.  That's sold out.  And then Foxwoods.  If you show up, Foxwoods is a big room. 
[02:54:00]  You go up there, Jimmy, right?  You sell that out.  No, I did it with Artie.  And I did it last year with Brewer and Burr and Dave.  We sold it out.  But I can't sell out.  Oh, just say yes.  I can't sell $4,000.  I really think you could, Jimmy.  Because it's really like an Al-Qaeda sell of ONA fans up there.  I could do the comedy club. 
[02:54:30]  You could totally do that theater, Jimmy.  Totally.  I have full confidence.  I'm positive.  I don't know.  How was Tempe, sweetie?  It's one of the best clubs I ever did.  I told you.  You were right.  Dude, it was amazing how many ONA fans there were.  I sold way better than I thought I would.  I really loved it.  Ooh.  And did Kenny help you sell merch?  He just berates people.  Buy something, you'll feel like a loser.  And then guys stop and buy something. 
[02:55:00]  It's amazing.  It's called the shame technique.  Yeah, he really is a good fucking carny.  He's perfected that.  Yeah, he has.  He's a barker.  I gotta get me a Kenny.  I think I feel...  Uh-oh.  Jay, your phone's cutting up.  Ah, your phone is busting up.  Jay?  That's it.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jay Moore.  He's going to think we hung up on him.  No.  More stories with Jay Moore this weekend on this channel.  Now, guest, David Tell.  What?  Be on tomorrow at 11 a.m. and Sunday at 6 p.m. right here on this channel. 
[02:55:30]  More stories.  Yeah, we're trying to play some of the podcasts that the guys are doing.  Yeah.  This week, we're taking a look at Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  And his is really good.  Yeah.  So his guest, David Tell.  Check it out this weekend.  Some guy came out of nowhere on the Shorty Awards thing for a web show.  Yeah.  This Mexican guy.  I don't even know what he is.  Never heard of him.  All of the people that have been voting for him are Mexican.  I don't recognize the language.  Might be Mexican cartel.  But he came up really quick out of nowhere. 
[02:56:00]  One day, he wasn't there.  The next day, he's in second place behind me.  Getting nervous.  Only separated by a couple of hundred votes.  Yeah.  I'm getting very nervous because I was running away with it.  Yeah.  Because our listeners are fucking great voting for me.  But now this guy's like right on my ass.  So I got to, you know, I got to get more votes.  Some asshole did it in radio too.  Yeah.  They're like these people are just coming out of nowhere and they're creeping up on us.  So just, you know, go to shorty awards dot com slash Anthony Cumia. 
[02:56:30]  And, you know, vote for me.  And, of course, Sam Roberts also.  Slash not Sam.  Yes, not Sam.  And then, of course, also in fashion, Melissa Stetton is trying to get a little prize there.  I don't want it.  I'm in third for the shorty awards for comedians.  Yeah.  Unacceptable.  Now you don't even want it.  No.  You should be first.  No.  I sincerely am not interested.  You should be first.  And I got good news.  I'm out of the running.  What?  And that's exactly where I want to be.  You can't be out of the running. 
[02:57:00]  I'm out of the running.  It's top six, right?  Oh, shit.  I'm right where I want to be.  Seventh place.  Who zoomed up?  I don't know.  Is it another one of those people?  But I've been encouraging people not to vote for me and they're starting to listen to me.  You're beating Justin Bieber.  So?  That's pretty good.  Look at the top of his list.  Did somebody else slide in out of nowhere?  I don't know.  They did.  Curtis Paradis.  And he's got you by like 150 votes.  I'm the third place behind people that I've never heard of.  So I'm not interested.  But the listeners are listening to me finally.  Vote for Opie for the YouTube star. 
[02:57:30]  He wants it.  Nope.  I don't want the attention.  No, no, no, no, no.  Yes, he does.  No, no.  Well, I do for the love of Christ.  I'll be honest.  If I didn't come in first, I wouldn't show up anywhere.  Right.  Under no circumstances would I fucking slink in at second or third place like a faggot.  I'm just not going to do it.  How this works is that.  My self-esteem is bad enough as it is.  The top six are the ones that will be in the running.  Doesn't matter.  And then judges decide.  Right.  And then is the judge going to look at the guy that's in second place now on a web show  and go like, oh, yeah, I don't even think he has a web show.  No.  I think he's just some guy, this inspirational guy. 
[02:58:00]  I don't know.  But fuck him.  I got to stay ahead of him.  Once the voting closes, we got to be on our game as far as tweeting and doing these interviews  and campaigning.  And apparently Nick Cannon is one of the judges.  I know.  I don't know if that's going to work for or against us.  Nick Cannon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nick Cannon.  Well, he's my friend on Twitter, so.  Well.  That should.  I'll try to.  I like Nick Cannon.  He might not vote for you because of conflict of interest.  He doesn't want to look like he's a. . .  Then the war is back on. 
[02:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  I fucked up, too.  I saw a tweet or something.  They said Nick Carter's sister died of an overdose.  And Nick's a buddy of ours.  He's a radio guy who, you know, we know from, I guess, Boston and here.  And it's sad to hear that.  No, no.  Nick Carter.  You got it wrong again.  Oh, did I really?  It's Nick Carter.  That's hilarious, Jimmy.  There's N. . .  I've got to explain.  All right.  Oh, N.I.K.  is our pal Nick.  N.I.K.  Nick Carter is from the radio.  Oh, God.  N.I.K.  Nick Carter is from the Backstreet Boys.  Oh, there you go.  And Nick Cannon.  And Nick Cannon. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, okay.  But you started by wanting to, you know, send condolences to Nick Cannon.  Because you thought it was Nick Cannon at first.  And then we explained, no, it's Nick Carter.  So then he wanted to send it to the guy we know in Boston who does radio.  But no, it's the other Nick Carter.  I was looking at Nick Cannon's Twitter.  I really thought.  I just misread it as Nick Cannon.  I'm like, he was a nice guy when he was there.  Like, I really liked him.  And if his sister overdosed, I was going to send him a, you know, hey, sorry to hear that.  But I was looking at his Twitter.  And it was, like, all, like, 92.3 Now stuff.  And I'm like, what a jerk off. 
[02:59:30]  And I'm like, no, he couldn't be doing this.  This has to be some social media idiot.  But then I'm so glad I didn't because it wasn't his sister.  And I'm glad I didn't send it to Nick Carter, the guy I like.  Oh, my God.  That would have been embarrassing.  It's Aaron Carter's brother, Nick Carter, from the Backstreet Boys.  From the Backstreet Boys.  Exactly.  Who you have no relationship with whatsoever.  I don't.  Although he's supposed to be at, I'll be in Poughkeepsie Bananas this Friday, Saturday, tonight, tomorrow.  I'm not expecting a big turnout.  My irrelevance is obvious.  Jimmy.  I disagree.  I know you do, but trust me, I live being me. 
[03:00:00]  Utterly irrelevant.  So, uh...  I saw you on the TV just the other day.  Exactly.  And it means nothing.  It is valueless.  I like me.  You should.  Yeah, I like me.  It's important.  It's important.  I like me.  Because if you don't like you, who else is gonna?  Oh, I got a lot of people that like me, Sam.  That's right.  Oh, a lot of people.  Yeah.  All right.  Make believe we're still on the radio, because I'm getting the fuck out of here before these  fucking guys try to explain why we're not at the Super Bowl again. 
[03:00:30]  I'll take the soup.  Stop saying that.  Chip's got a great...  Oh, oh, oh.  Don't leave me alone.  Oh, wait a minute.  The elbow.  Ah, there it is.  Gross.  That's great.  I like the elbow.  Yeah?  You like it?  Yeah, it's pleasant.  I like Jim's hipster hat.  Oh, you like my hat?  Jim's got a hipster hat now.  Let's see.  He bought it in Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Yeah, I got some sherry berries for whoever wants.  That rhymes.  Eat up, boys.  Eat them up. 
[03:01:00]  Yum, yum, eat them up.  Go Patriots.  I'm a Patriot.  I love this country.  Yes, big Super Bowl.  I'll take the soup.  Ah, oh, no.  Here you go.  Ah, stop it.  That's the dumbest thing.  Jim is just wearing one of those hipster hats with the ears that fold down and a Disco  Sucks t-shirt.  Disco Sucks.  Wow, you are retro with that shirt.  You got a photo shoot or something?  You taking headshots?  For the sick puppies.  Oh, SFPs?  Yeah, SFPs.  I might do like a thing in front of, called Igloo Melton. 
[03:01:30]  Igloo Melton?  Igloo Melton.  How does that go?  We rock so hard, we melt igloos.  Oh, I thought it was a song.  Yeah.  It is.  Oh, how does it go?  Igloo Melton.  Igloo Melton.  How does the sick fucking puppy song go?  We're the sick, the sick, the sick fucking puppies.  The sick, the sick, the sick fucking puppies.  Sick, the sick, the sick fucking puppies barking up your tree.  How hard do you guys generally rock? 
[03:02:00]  So hard with like a bunch of like big rocks.  Is it heavy?  So heavy, only the devil can lift it.  Whoa.  Is that like a catchphrase for a shirt or something?  That's a good one, I should.  Right.  Oh, boy.  I would love to hang out longer, but it is Friday.  Hey, Roland.  The weekend is up on.  Hey, where are the Yankees?  What are you, playing baseball or something?  That's not good.  Ah, there he goes.  Roland's elbowing him back like it was a good joke.  All right, people. 
[03:02:30]  Stay tuned for Sam Roberts and the shit show.  Why do I say after shit show?  After shit show.  It's one word.  I don't look like a faggot in this hat.  Everybody was yelling, hey, faggot.  But that's not accurate.  Probably not the hat.  It is accurate.  It's not.  Well, have a good weekend.  I wish your shirt said chip instead of disco.  Take it easy, guys.  Have a good weekend.  Disco chip.  See you later.  I'll see you.  You coming to a Super Bowl party?  I'll take the soup.  I'll be here in the studio, four to six.  Jimmy?  What, E-Rock?  Who?  Am I invited?  Yeah, everybody's invited. 
[03:03:00]  I might go.  I'll go to the Super Bowl party, but I'll take the ball.  I guess stop doing that to me.  Rowan's taking a picture.  Yeah, I think a picture will last longer.  He's already taking it.  How would taking a picture last longer than a picture?  Yeah, it's logic.  All right, so you getting out of here?  Yeah, I'm going to make like a tree and leave.  Okay.  Well, you want to say goodbye?  You want to end the show?  Yeah, I'll go to Bananas. 
[03:03:30]  Still slip on banana pills?  I don't know.  And rethink there.  Okay, I guess it's over.  That's it?  Yeah.  There's Troy.  Hi, Troy.  What are you doing?  Oh, you guys are in the air?  Yeah, Chip is closing the show, but he's not.  Yeah.  He hasn't come up with one that we like yet.  You're wearing a checkerboard shirt.  What are you playing?  What are you in the park playing checkers or something?  He's rubbing his forearm on Troy.  It's him elbowing, you know. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  As if he's just joshing.  What do you think of Chip's hat in this case?  He looks like one of those old pilots.  You know, he needs the goggles to come down.  Yeah, Amelia Airhead.  I like that Chip can be self-deprecating at times.  That's not about me, about her.  It's a girl pilot.  I was on a plane one time and they said the captain's name is the lady's name.  I was like, fuck this shit.  Forget this noise.  You're edgy.  Sometimes it's just a political commentary. 
[03:04:30]  I walk right off the plane.  I'm like, I'll bomb this thing.  That's what you said?  Yeah, I thought it.  Did that situation happen?  No, I didn't think it did.  I thought that might be a lie.  Well, listen, Chip is so awful right now, I'm uncomfortable.  Shit.  That's because if you let Chip just go, if you just extend it without giving him too much,  that's when the awfulness really comes out.  So, Chip, why don't you end the show on a bang?  Is it bang?  Oh, I could do that.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers. 
[03:05:00]  Because where it's cold, there's the ice smoke truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  Bucket up your tree  The Opie Anthony Show
