<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, airing sometime after September 11th, 2001, opened with a nonsensical bit involving instructions for guests Mitch Hedberg and Gilbert Gottfried, followed by a promotion of their show on XM Radio.  A brief 70s music segment and sponsored segments featuring Chris Whitting's "Success Journal" (about the Dodge brothers) and Jim Blasting Game's "Small Business Minute" ensued. Opie then discussed his brother's recent wedding and bachelor party, attributing the show's unusually vulgar tone to his hangover.

The show then transitioned into a segment dedicated to listener-submitted 9/11 tribute songs, many sourced from a radio prep service called "Prep Burger."  Opie and Anthony relentlessly mocked the songs’ poor lyrical content, musical quality, and perceived insincerity, highlighting awkward rhymes, clichés (especially "I was born in America" and "You missed America"), and the artists' apparent self-promotion.  John Valby, creator of "Taliban Blues," called in to defend his work, but his call only fueled the hosts' mockery.  Another memorable song, "USA Holla If You're With Me" by Mixed Bread, also received significant criticism. "Gay Marco" even contributed his own intentionally awful Broadway-style 9/11 tribute song.  Numerous listener calls either defended or concurred with the hosts' scathing assessment.  The segment was punctuated by technical difficulties with a patriotic song and a running gag involving a rhyming game with the song lyrics.  Numerous XM Radio commercial breaks for sports, comedy, and music channels were also interspersed.

The next segment featured a call from Andrew Dice Clay, who claimed to be at Ground Zero.  His call, however, rapidly devolved into a rambling, incoherent rant peppered with references to an NYPD hat and various historical tragedies.  This led to a chaotic exchange involving Opie, Anthony, Dice Clay, and studio guests Christopher Titus and Barry Williams (Greg Brady), who attempted to offer Dice Clay a TV opportunity.  The hosts' reactions ranged from disbelief and frustration to amusement.  The conversation included several vulgar and offensive comments. This was followed by a discussion of a proposed Andrew Dice Clay-led 24-hour radiothon to benefit 9/11 victims, initially presented by Dice Clay as a sincere attempt to aid victims and first responders. However, the hosts' playful interruptions and off-color jokes led to an increasingly contentious exchange, with Dice Clay repeatedly expressing frustration and threatening to hang up.  Melissa, a listener, confirmed the need for dog food and booties for rescue dogs at Ground Zero, adding another layer to the conversation. The segment concluded with Dice Clay still trying to finalize the radiothon amidst the hosts' continued joking and antagonism. A "Dice-a-thon Part Two" was mentioned, but its details weren't provided.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to "Operation Infinite Beer," an attempt to deliver kegs of beer to a bar near Ground Zero for rescue workers.  The operation, involving Earl Douglas ("Black Earl") and John Rossi, faced repeated setbacks due to encounters with law enforcement demanding paperwork they lacked.  Psycho Mark, a caller claiming extensive involvement in Ground Zero operations, initially assured easy entry, but this proved false.  Numerous calls with a frustrated and angry Earl ensued, with the hosts and Psycho Mark berating him for perceived incompetence.  Earl even allegedly hung up and punched his van's dashboard. Outlandish plans for beer delivery, including disguises and a diversion vehicle, were discussed. The segment ended with Psycho Mark reporting a breakthrough, securing permission for delivery, though Earl's continued participation remained uncertain.  The segment, like much of the show, was filled with profanity and crude sexual jokes.

The show concluded with a segment summarizing the day's events ("What did you learn today?"), focusing on listener feedback. This included a comedic bit about Earl abandoning his fire warden post during a building evacuation; a highly offensive argument between Earl and Psycho Mark over the failed "Operation Infinite Beer";  a listener's claim that Earl yelled "feats don't fail me now" while fleeing; a description of the panicked evacuation of the sister station 1010 Wins; and the revelation of Psycho Mark's previous firing for having anal sex on the boss's couch. A song mocking Earl's temper was created and performed.  Joe, Anthony's brother, called to promote his U2 tribute band's website.  The segment also featured a song dedicated to Earl, mocking him as an "angry young man," with Earl remaining silent, despite the hosts' attempts to provoke a response. This was followed by the playing of another song with extremely offensive and misogynistic lyrics about women of various religious backgrounds.  The show interspersed numerous XM radio advertisements throughout the broadcast.

[00:00:00]  Imagine there's no heaven  It's easy if you try  No hell below us 
[00:00:30]  Above us only sky  Imagine all the people  Living for today  Imagine there's no countries  It isn't hard to do 
[00:01:00]  Nothing to kill or die for  No religion too  Imagine all the people  Living life in peace  You may say I'm a dreamer 
[00:01:30]  But I'm not the only one  I hope someday you'll join us  And the world will be as one  Imagine no possessions 
[00:02:00]  I wonder if I can  No need for grief or hunger  Brotherhood of man  Imagine all the people  Sharing all the world 
[00:02:30]  You may say I'm a dreamer  But I'm not the only one  I hope someday you'll join us  And the world will live as one 
[00:03:00]  Come on everybody  Wake up  Rise and shine  Hi boys and girls  I'm playing with my friend  Billy Baloney  Boy PeeBee  It sure smells funny  Hello  Hello  Is this thing on?  Hello  I'm bored  Let's go  Hey guys  Opie and Anthony here  We'll be back live tomorrow  We promise  My brother's wedding was yesterday 
[00:03:30]  So you gotta give me a break  We gotta take today off  But in honor of 9-11  Even though this is like September 10th  You know the day before 9-11  We're gonna go down memory lane here  With some of the old stuff we did  Surrounding 9-11  Remember the tribute songs that came in it?  Oh, a bunch of hack musicians  Using the tragedy  As a chance to catapult themselves to fame  With horrible tribute songs  To the people  The buildings  To everything  It was just a wreck 
[00:04:00]  And we played them  And goofed on them  Oh, we gave these guys a beating  I haven't heard this in a long, long time  So hopefully I'm in a car somewhere  Checking this out  Because this is the one I really want to hear today  And it's Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  We got the tribute songs  You want to finally play a few of these?  Ugh  Oh, these?  Just another way people are trying to capitalize on  What happened to us  I just wish somebody would call in with a poem  Yeah, you know 
[00:04:30]  Last week  They stink  I've heard them  On another station last night  And I wanted to just punch this guy in the face  Nothing worse than a melodramatic poem  With a Camden accent  Stop calling in to radio shows  And reading poetry  You're absolutely right  You know something  For some reason  People feel that when there's a tragedy  All of a sudden  They become poets  Songwriters  And the truth of the matter is  You're not  We gave people a lot of liberty 
[00:05:00]  Last week  Because they needed it  You know  They needed an outlet  And we were here  But some of those  A couple of them were pretty good  You know  Kind of had the whole essence  Of the whole thing  But Dice's poetry is more poignant  If I may use the word again  Poignant  Than some of the stuff we were hearing  Where are the tribute songs?  Is it in three?  Or is it  Tribute  Now are these original tribute songs?  Yeah 
[00:05:30]  Oh, sent in by various bands or people  They're not even our listeners  They're just sending these songs to every station  Every station hoping that through this tragedy  They can get some air time  Wow, we never knew how deep you were  Until we heard that  Yeah  Stupid asses  Yeah  Alright, well here's the first one  Okay  Oh, strapping  We don't even know who it's by  Oh, we don't?  Yeah, don't even mention that name  Yeah, that's a good idea  Today, our fellow citizens  Our way of life  Our very freedom  Came under attack  767 hit the World Trade Center 
[00:06:00]  At 8.48 this morning  And 16 minutes later  United Flight 175  Delivers the second floor  Flight 77  Took aim on the Pentagon  It crashed in a fireball  At 9.38  At 10.20  Two and a half hours  After the four-pronged attack was launched  The plane crashed  In a rural Pennsylvania field  Terrible sadness  Seagull, you fly  Across the right  Into the misty morning sun 
[00:06:30]  These acts of mass murder  Were intended to frighten our nation  Into chaos and retreat  Nobody asked you  Where do I close in?  Nobody knows where you're from  But they have failed  Our country is strong  Here is a man  Asking the question  Is this really the end of the world?  When you feel safe here 
[00:07:00]  And now  You don't feel it's safe  Seagull, you must have known  For a long time  The shape of things do come  Now you fly  Now you fly  Through the sky  Never asking why  And you fly  All around  Till somebody  Shoot you down 
[00:07:30]  Not only will they be mourning  Not only will they be mourning for the dead  There will be many, many questions  All right  And the impact of death  Thank you  And the cat's in the cradle  And the silver spoon  You didn't recognize who that was?  That's Gordon Lightfoot  Is that Gordon Lightfoot?  Clap  We all started running  I call my heart  Lyric of the Edmund Fitzgerald  Yeah  Across the horizon  Into the misty morning sun  Either that or like the last song on 
[00:08:00]  Bad Company, Bad Company  Bad Company  No one, did you hear that?  Lyric of the Edmund Fitzgerald  Seagull fly high  All right, well  I just hate the news clip put in  To accentuate the point  That's enough  Nice try  Nice try to that guy  Great  You know, he's trying to do something, I guess  Okay  Great use of a 1979 Echoplex  I like that effect 
[00:08:30]  All right, ready for another one here?  Yeah  Okay  Goodbye  England's rose  Oh, this is a little R&B, right?  Doesn't it kick in?  That's right  I heard that one  Yeah  Yeah, check this out  R&B's are really bad 
[00:09:00]  No love for anyone who's different  Please  Can we all just get along  Oh my  Still the same old song 
[00:09:30]  Yeah  When will we stop hurting each other  Yeah, when  Can we all just get along  Can we all just get along  Can we all just get along  Can we all just get along  Will we stop hurting each other?  Yeah  When will we love each other?  Ooh  Yeah  We've been taking  Hearts are aching for a revolution  Tears are falling  Tears are falling  What the hell was that? 
[00:10:00]  Okay, all right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks for sending that in.  Thank you.  Can we follow that up with two sir with love?  Thank you, Lulu.  Two sir with love.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, I would rather hear Evil Barney than that crap. 
[00:10:30]  Don't ever do that again, guys.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Isn't this stuff great?  We got lots of them.  Come on, this stuff's great.  It's inspiring.  We got five of them today alone.  All right, here's the third one.  John Cougar Mellencamp.  I was born in America, where freedom still prevails. 
[00:11:00]  I believe that fellow man should help when freedom fails.  We're not the balance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're long guns.  I don't need no attitude.  I don't want to pass when you're not the balance.  Is this the knack? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's the knack.  I think it's the knack that rolls.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some say I'm a social brat.  Don't turn around.  All I'm standing in the background comes.  We're long guns.  Ugh.  Okay. 
[00:12:00]  We're long guns.  Oh.  The fast times at Ridgemont High Memorial.  Sounded like XTC.  A little XTC, right?  Makes me want to hear some Pat Benatar.  Yeah.  Here's a rule of thumb.  Any time a song starts with, I was born in America, it will stink.  Man.  Joni, what's up?  You have to stop it right now.  It's awful, and nobody's enjoying it. 
[00:12:30]  They're horrible songs.  I know.  Shut it off.  These people, they mean well, but I don't know.  The music was too loud, first of all.  Hello, guys.  All right.  Let's try the fourth one.  Five of these came in today alone.  Uh-oh.  James Taylor.  Dream all you feel.  You can.  This is Peter, Paul, and suck. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Dream all you feel.  Don't you think it's time to make a change.  Yes.  Yes, rock.  Don't you think it's time to rearrange.  Now, that one's kind of surprising.  Don't you think it's time to take a stand?  That one's kind of like a change.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Uh-oh.  Run with disaster every day.  Ha-ha.  I'm walking along that road.  And it just don't seem to be that road.  I know.  This puts the cunch in country.  Well, that was funny.  I see a nation with devastation.  See the world at the red tension here. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Thank you, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Thank you.  The change in rearrange, though, was nice from the Brady Bunch.  He puts the suck in stink or something.  Wow.  Goddamn.  Okay.  Hey, maybe this should be filed away, Opie.  We're loud and gone.  That's my favorite so far.  This is why they have armed guards outside of record companies.  To keep these people out.  I like the Gordon Lightfoot myself.  You like that one?  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  All right.  Here's our last one for today. 
[00:14:30]  Yep.  Even John Valby sent us one.  Where's the John Valby one?  These are worse than the songs Dirk Diggler recorded in Wiggy Night.  Goddamn Joe from Jersey.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  That was great.  We got two to go, Anthony, because we got John Valby.  He did a song, too.  Okay.  Did he?  Here's another one by someone else.  Alice in Chains.  Sounds like he's singing into a fan. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  New York City. 
[00:15:30]  Ooh.  Okay.  I'm going out to get some nachos.  New York City.  Thinking about tomorrow before today.  Two.  Gotta take the time to stop and see the beauty in this town.  Sounds like something off one of the Kiss solo LPs.  Hey, I bought all four of them.  Son of a bitch. 
[00:16:00]  God damn.  Ace Frehley sucked.  Aces.  At least Aces had Beth.  Back in the New York group.  No, that was Peter Criss's.  That was Peter Criss's, yeah.  Back in the New York group.  I know.  That was a great song by Ace Frehley.  Yeah, but Ace Frehley sold the most out of all four of those.  Gene Simmons was the worst.  Okay.  We have to take a break.  So we'll do it.  We got John Valby's song.  Damn it.  Trust me, this isn't a radio tease.  It's not that great.  Look at this.  It makes, these guys make Starland vocal bands sound talented. 
[00:16:30]  Afternoon Delight.  Peter Paul and Fairy.  I'm about to jab a pen through my ears into my brain.  Well, the reviews are in.  Hey, finally, a Loverboy reunion.  John Cougar Mellon crap.  That Dirk Diggler line was hilarious.  Dirk Diggler.  Gosh, that's crazy.  These songs are coming in every day, too.  It's, wow.  I wonder if they listen to the song before they send it in.  They can't be sitting around their basement going, hey, this is great. 
[00:17:00]  Not enough in the sky references.  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy, the Opie and Anthony radio program dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs and mocking the selfishness and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments.  God bless America.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What's left to do today, Ant?  I don't know.  We got John Valby's song about the tragedy.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  How's the John Valby song?  I haven't heard it yet.  Want to check it out?  Someone is really pissed off at us, though.  For what?  Now, hold on.  Let's go to Ken.  Let's then find out.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say, you know, I mean, these artists, this song might not be that good, all right?  But that's the way they express the way they feel about their country, and that's okay.  I think we said that.  You guys, you know, you have radio.  You know, that's your way to express the way you feel. 
[00:18:00]  These guys, you know, they write a song, they send it in.  If it gets played and you take it for what it's worth, it's a great song.  They're trying to capitalize on the national.  Are they not making money, though?  Yeah, all dirty.  We don't know that for sure.  And, Ken, we did say that, you know, this is people expressing themselves.  But we got to goof on it a little bit.  I mean, the one sounded like your life, but the other one sounded like poison, every rose has a thorax.  But it's not the Yankees and the Mexico World Series.  It's our country and our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine going in to fight for us. 
[00:18:30]  Ken, Ken.  It's just something to inspire us.  All right, Ken, slow down.  We understand the seriousness of this.  And you're talking about the seriousness of our men and women going overseas with goofy tribute songs that stink.  Yeah, I know they stink, but they mean something to them.  And if they throw them out just to have a song, I mean, that's their way of expressing themselves, and you got to take it just for that.  All right.  They should play them in their houses where only they are subjected to them.  And another thing, any song that begins, you know, I was born in the USA does not suck. 
[00:19:00]  And that's really stupid for you to say.  No, it's not.  It's not talking about Springsteen.  It's just normally going to be a melodramatic song.  Yeah, but normally this isn't a normal time.  We understand that, Ken.  Everyone understands.  I mean, I'm just a little, you know, upset.  All right, all right.  Take it easy.  My father's military.  I'm patriotic.  I know.  Your father's great.  Point well taken.  Thank you, Ken.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right.  With that said, here's John Valby's song.  Oh, my God. 
[00:19:30]  Today on The Best Pass, 9, 11, 2, 1, 2, 1.  And as they cheered in the streets of Palestine, they cried in the streets of New York.  But today we stand as Americans, still proud, angry, but we will not give in. 
[00:20:00]  We will not kill innocent people for our revenge.  Ah, collateral damage.  We're America.  We really believe in freedom and justice.  And justice is what's coming to you, Osama. 
[00:20:30]  First name basis?  All you Islamic jihad...  Game's on.  Ooh.  Disco beat.  We're gonna get you.  Ha.  Well, you can run all day.  Hide all night.  Osama bin Laden.  Now we're ready to fight.  We're gonna get you.  We're gonna get you.  Oh, okay.  You can hide in the basement.  I'll be around.  You can hide in the game, but the game ain't over until you're in your grave. 
[00:21:00]  Gonna get you.  It's the bitches that are get you.  When New York smoked, the Pentagon burned Osama bin Laden.  Now it's your turn.  Gonna get you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Gonna get you.  Needless and die.  Because you're hating Osama bin Laden, you're the real Satan.  Oh, hate Satan.  The towers came down on the street today.  How much longer is this?  But freedom still stands in the USA. 
[00:21:30]  The towers came down on the street today.  But freedom still stands in the USA.  Um.  All right.  I wonder if Ken still feels the same way he did.  A few minutes ago when he called, I was, uh, I was hoping for more of a, uh, filth.  I know a guy.  His name's bin Laden.  Bin Laden.  Bend him over.  I'll slip a rod in. 
[00:22:00]  You know, something more, uh.  More Valby-ish.  More Valby-like.  Sure.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, I can do a little Valby.  Look at that.  Ah, drink people.  Ah.  Drink people.  Time to drink.  Hope he's doing an impression.  That's a drinking game.  You gotta drink.  Ooh.  That's all I could do from Valby, but.  Ah.  That was pretty good rap, though.  Oof.  Think.  That reminds me.  A little techno.  Rule of thumb.  White man with buffalo accents.  Never rap. 
[00:22:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That reminds me when, uh, you know, rap got so popular, McDonald's decided they have to do a little rap commercial.  Yeah, remember that?  No.  Yeah, like, uh, after hip-hop became pretty acceptable, everyone was doing it in their commercial.  He also had, uh, you gotta help me, that Jesus Christ superstar thing happening in the middle of the rap.  That, uh, there was a song out in the 70s, Help Me Somebody.  Hmm.  Song out in the 70s. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  Someone will come up with it.  It was all about.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  You're just laughing over there.  All right, let's play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show today.  Tuna from Queens said, Is it just me or did Dr. Dirty go from a classic piano to a 1987 Casio keyboard?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  How come that's the Balby song that doesn't get dumped out of it?  Oh, God damn.  You guys are brutal, man.  They're just expressing themselves.  These are artists expressing themselves. 
[00:23:30]  Brett writes, Today I learned any song that starts with I Was Born in America stinks.  Norton rules.  Chris writes, Today I learned that Muslim women are known as bang puppets.  I can't say the F word.  I like that song, yo.  Sounds important.  Let's go to Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Doug?  Ah, Doug.  He's listening to himself.  Sometimes it'd be funny.  I'll say earth to Doug. 
[00:24:00]  That's a chuckle.  Calm down, boo.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Bin Laden.  Bin Laden who?  Bin Laden in and out and in and out of that dumper when we flipped her over at the game.  That's more like what I was expecting. 
[00:24:30]  Continue drinking.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Osama.  Osama who?  Osama at the game.  Bang.  That's quite a fine ah, Al.  Yeah, it is.  That's the Valby ah.  Oh, yeah.  If you've ever seen Valby, man, people are taking it out there. 
[00:25:00]  Ah.  All right.  Where else do we go?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  We did all that.  Bah, bah.  Knock, knock.  No, you got to say knock, knock if you got one.  I don't have one for that one.  I don't have one for that either.  I know.  Well, we might.  We might before we get out of here.  Valby's all sounded like Rock Me Amadeus by Falco.  Falco.  Remember Falco, yo?  Falco.  Rock Me Amadeus.  All right. 
[00:25:30]  Falco.  Well, we're outie.  Dunsky.  Thanks, guys.  Outsky, opsky.  I hope we gave you a distraction.  We're down.  We will break in with the serious stuff when it does happen, and we're just going for a  few chuckles.  I hope you had a chuckle today, all right?  What two?  They named it.  A chuckle or two.  That's the new thing.  They named it.  Yeah, they did.  Operation Infinite Justice.  I like that.  It goes on forever.  Back at the League of Justice.  Cool.  Is that really what it's called?  Infinite? 
[00:26:00]  Operation Infinite Justice.  Operation Infinite Justice.  What channel is this?  That's the name of the operation.  It's everywhere.  Oh, that's the general term for...  Operation Bomb-A-Monkey would probably be more.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  All right, man.  Peace.  We'll see you tomorrow.  On a serious note, don't ever forget...  Obi and Anthony.  70s on 7.  You are the dancing queen.  Another day in the park. 
[00:26:30]  All that great music straight out of the 70s.  He's leaving.  Leaving.  On that big-back train.  Georgia.  Nothing from nothing.  Leave nothing.  From when Pet Rocks ruled.  Build up.

I'm Ellen Cannon with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute. 
[00:29:30]  You've heard these stories.  Red cars get more tickets.  Or if you get a ticket in another state, your home state won't find out about it.  Or if you don't sign a ticket, it will be dismissed.  Some are true.  Some are just myths.  For example, red cars don't get ticketed more often than other colors.  And insurance companies don't charge higher premiums for them either.

Refusing to sign a ticket won't do anything but agitate the officer and invite more scrutiny.  And in some states, such as Texas, refusing to sign a ticket can mean a trip to jail.

[00:30:30]  That's what I'm wrong.  Do it again.  In the weeks following September 11th, the Opie and Anthony Show dedicated a number of, uh...  Dedicated a number of segments to...  Do you want to write this down?  No, I don't want to write it down.  I don't have a pen.  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy, the Opie and Anthony radio program dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs  and mocking the selfishness and insincerity displayed in them. 
[00:31:00]  This is one of those segments.  Jesus H. Christ, holy shit, God bless America.  John Valby's calling in.  Who, who, who's talking to him?  Let's talk to John Valby right away.  John!  Hey, how are you?  John Valby.  What's going on, bro?  Oh, hey, listen, I did a Polybon blues song for you.  I heard you guys yesterday in Buffalo, and it seemed like you wanted something a little more Valby-esque, so I did it for you.  You weren't listening to this show yesterday, were you?  Well, not for a whole lot, but I listened to some of it. 
[00:31:30]  See, I don't like this syndication thing, because, you know, we like making fun of our friends, but we don't want them to hear that we're making fun of them.  Did you like our suggestions for a couple of Hey Lotties and Gang Bangs?  Yeah, yeah, I did it to the Outhouse Blues.  Oh, good.  I only changed it to the Taliban blues and did a double verse instead of a single verse, and I think there's four or five pretty good ones in there, man.  All right.  Now, I'm trying to e-mail it to you.  Yeah, we'll get it.  We can have you send it to Steve C. 
[00:32:00]  He'll take care of that.  Ah!  But I ran into your brother.  I played the Friday night after down in Wildwood, New Jersey, for a fireman's thing, only they canceled the fire parade, and, you know, the firemen were sitting on their porches with the candles.  It was really neat, but I saw your brother there.  Oh, cool.  Brother Joe?  Oh, Opie's brother?  Oh, my brother?  Yeah.  Which one?  I got about ten or so.  He was an Irish guy.  Everyone thinks we're Irish. 
[00:32:30]  We're mutts.  You're mutts?  You're American mutts?  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  A little of everything.  Yeah.  Did he have very blonde hair?  Gee, could his name have been Kevin?  I have a cousin, Kevin.  Was his name Quinn?  You know...  Was he circumcised?  I have Alzheimer's.  How many beers did you have when you met my so-called brother, John?  Yeah, it was three or four.  I was three or four in.  All right.  Yeah.  Early in the night.  Yeah.  John, people making fun of your song from yesterday. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, that's okay.  Yeah.  You know, I give it out.  I've got to be able to take it, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you're going to...  You know, my wife sent that, and that was just something I was doing for myself at home,  and I didn't want her to send that.  Ah, cool.  The back pedal.  Nice, John.  Nice.  No, wait a minute.  I'm just telling you, I wasn't putting it out.  Right.  Now a million people have heard your work, so... 
[00:33:30]  Oh, well.  Well, we look forward to the new one, John.  Okay, yeah.  All right.  Hey, thanks.  All right, bro.  Thanks, John.  Bye.  Okay, bye.  John Valby from Buffalo.  There he goes.  This is the song we're talking about from yesterday.  Oh, you got it.  It's really bad.  Oh, God.  I enjoyed it.  You like this one?  Yeah.  Today, we were attacked.  9-11 to a thousand and one.  And as they cheered in the streets of Palestine, they cried in the streets of New York. 
[00:34:00]  We will not kill innocent people for our revenge. 
[00:34:30]  Be quiet, sir.  We're America.  We really believe in freedom and justice.  Oh, wow.  And justice is what's coming to you, Osama.  And right.  All you Islamic jihad...  Games on.  I got sort of a kind of a brain... 
[00:35:00]  We're going to get you.  Well, you can run all day, hide all night.  Osama bin Laden, now we're ready to fight.  We're going to get you.  I got a battle, wow.  We're going to get you.  I got a battle, wow.  Hide in the basement, hide in the cave, but the game ain't over until you're in your grave.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  When New York smoked, the Pentagon burned Osama bin Laden.  Now it's your turn to make you shit. 
[00:35:30]  What are you people?  On the door?  The innocent died because you're hating Osama bin Laden.  You're the real Satan.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  The towers came down on the street today.  Quiet.  Freedom still stands in the USA.  Quiet.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stay out of the bushes.  And you like to suck my ass. 
[00:36:00]  John?  He too.  John?  Yes?  You calling back?  Hello.  Hey.  Hey.  It's MC Valby.  What's up?  Oh, hi.  I'm just trying to get a proper email address.  Oh, okay.  Oh, we just played your song again.  Oh, man.  You're hurting me now.  That's kind of a disco thing happening there.  A little John Valby rapping. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, man, I wasn't done with that.  I'm sorry.  I know you're not supposed to really care.  It doesn't matter.  But you've got to listen to this other one.  This other one's the style that you're used to.  Okay.  All right.  We look forward to it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to hang on until somebody tells me how to get an email.  All right.  Satan rhymed, though.  Yeah.  Satan?  Yeah.  Satan.  They rhymed.  Yeah.  That rhymed nicely.  Vanilla Valby.  Uh-huh. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  There were a few rhymes.  It just didn't have a lot of pizzazz to it.  Anyway, I was sad.  I did that the day of the thing, the afternoon of the thing.  I mean, you know.  Right.  So I wasn't exactly in a funny mood.  Okay.  Anyway, thanks for understanding.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  There he goes.  John Valby.  Yes.  On the way, we'll play the latest from John Valby, a song he's very proud of, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes.  The new one? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And we also have a couple more, what, songs?  You know what someone-  A couple more tribute songs?  Ron and Fez had one on their show last night that was really bad that they said they were  going to leave for us, by the way.  Cool.  Maybe that's laying around, too.  Someone on Instant Feedback said John Valby sounded like that clip of Buddy Ebsen when he  couldn't remember the words to the Beverly Hillbillies song.  It was just like, oh, I'm sorry.  And then, because Valby kind of sounded like that when he was backpedaling about his song.  It sounded like, what was that duck song, that disco duck? 
[00:38:00]  Disco duck.  It sounded like safety dance.  A little safety dance.  A little bit also the Blondie song, Rapture.  The Cassio.  Rock Me Amadeus by Falco.  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy, the Opie and Anthony radio program  dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs and mocking the selfishness  and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments.  God bless America.  You want to play some of these tribute songs, Anthony?  Yeah.  Let's see what people are doing in other cities to try to make it better for the other people. 
[00:38:30]  It's so good, isn't it?  And we've got to set up all these bits nowadays, unfortunately, because everyone is very sensitive  out there.  You know, I understand these people.  They're sending these songs into radio stations.  And it's their way of expressing what they're feeling and expressing themselves.  And we understand all that crap, okay?  Yeah.  We think it's a crap.  You know, we're all very sad at what happened over a week ago. 
[00:39:00]  And I personally don't want to be any sadder than I have to be.  And these songs, there's only one purpose to it.  It's just making people even sadder.  Yeah.  Now, this is my opinion.  You don't have to agree with me.  I don't care.  Anthony and I said this years ago on our show.  We just throw this crap out there.  We're not expecting people to, you know, agree with us on this stuff.  But this is what we feel.  Yeah.  Okay?  Well, can you imagine if I called in with some tribute jokes?  People would want to lynch me.  Yeah.  These songs are just enough already. 
[00:39:30]  We played a bunch of these yesterday.  And, oof, people were hating them.  Are we getting the John Vallaby song in, too?  We're still waiting for it.  Which one is this?  Oh, God.  What is this one?  All right.  These songs are all over the Internet.  Mm-hmm.  And they're being played by pretty big air personalities.  Oh, really?  And radio stations all over America.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a show called...  Fantastic.  There's a show called Monsters of the Midday in Florida.  Monsters of the Midday. 
[00:40:00]  TKS.  Tampa.  I think we're going to be on in Tampa eventually.  Hey, how about that?  Following Monsters of the Midday.  I don't know if we'll be on their station.  I have no clue.  Fabulous.  Fantastic.  Wonderful.  What?  So, what?  Did they do this song themselves?  They did this song, yeah.  And this is their big tribute song.  And these are all over the...  Huge in Tampa.  These are all over the radio websites.  And our business is like, hey, you've got to download this song and play it on your show  or your station.  I was talking last night with my girlfriend just saying I'm so disgusted with the business 
[00:40:30]  of not just radio, but really radio has a lot to do with it, but just the entertainment  business.  Everything.  Everything is so just self-important, you know?  And it's the same thing with these songs.  They throw them together and you know that they're just meeting with each other and, hey,  that's a good one.  You know?  And the whole original cause that it was made for, which I don't think existed in the first  place, just takes a backseat to, hey, if this gets played all over the country, we're 
[00:41:00]  going to do great.  This is good for us.  Yeah.  Self-serving.  Oh, yeah.  Monsters of Midday.  So what's the name of the song, you know?  I think it's called Tuttle's or something.  Tuttle's song for Bubba.  I don't know.  It's just scribbled on the CD.  All right.  But it's their tribute song.  This is their tribute song.  All right.  All right.  Now, I just hope people aren't tuning in in the middle of the song going, oh, wow,  look at that.  And I hope they're doing something nice with these. 
[00:41:30]  No.  Monsters of Midday.  Flip it upside down.  What do you got?  Wow.  Hmm.  Goodbye, England's Rose.  Another one that sounds like that.  Didn't we hear this yesterday?  No?  It was the one that turned into the hip-hop thing.  You ripped through our city's skylines. 
[00:42:00]  I heard you missed America.  You brought down our nation's airlines.  But you missed America.  Wow.  You can go insane and kill and maim and set our flag aflame.  We will never fall.  We don't live in America.  And we don't live in America. 
[00:42:30]  So you can't hurt us at all.  Can you play the rich voice?  It's awful.  It's America.  Can you play that instead?  That lives in us.  It's a spirit.  It's a feeling that you can never touch.  Because we don't live in America.  And we don't live in America.  Wait, the problem is we do live in America.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, we do.  See, what he's saying, Opie, is we don't live in America.  America.  America lives in us.  Yes.  Yes.  We don't live there because America lives in us.  Ah, I see.  Middle of the song, applause break.  It's a bad Billy Joel impression.  Yeah.  Now our nation stands united because you missed America. 
[00:43:30]  We are brothers undivided because you missed America.  You missed America.  He means the heart part.  You can come around and tear our buildings down and burn them to the ground.  No, but we'd rather you don't.  Yeah, no.  You can't come here and do that, you idiot.  Was he just giving permission?  Yeah, I don't care what he says after that phrase.  You can't do that ever.  Tampa stinks.  Miss America.  Try to stay on the frigging note, my friend. 
[00:44:00]  What the hell is that?  Hold on.  I want to hear this part again.  Come around and tear our buildings.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Wait.  Listen to the words.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey, rhyme.  Say, rhyme.  This took at least an hour to do it.  Shut up.  I hear next.  All right.  You missed America.  Here we go.  Listen to this line.  You can come around and tear our buildings down and burn them to the ground.  Hey, thanks.  But we will never fall. 
[00:44:30]  That's wonderful.  Because we don't live in America.  So you can't hurt us at all.  Oh, my God.  I could only hope the mic he was singing in was covered with herpes.  Lives in us.  Yes.  Spirit, it's a feeling.  All right.  Well, there you go.  And he lives in a flat, mountainless dump. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  I hate Florida.  Wow.  They're the next guest on Politically Incorrect.  How embarrassing, though, to our business.  We don't live in America.  You're the feeling of America.  Monsters of Midday.  The listeners are sitting there going, oh, here it is, the song I was telling you about.  That was a monstrosity.  So the Monsters of Midday thing is pretty much accurate. 
[00:45:30]  Then again, if they were enjoying that, they would probably hate this radio program.  Doug.  Come on.  That's legit.  I'd rather listen to Jeff Norris' Nightclub act in that.  You can't tear our buildings down.  No, you can't tear our buildings down, you idiots.  You should even play.  That's horrible.  All right.  Thank you.  Awful.  It stinks.  They should rename their show Sissies of the Midday.  Ikea Boy wants to know if we had brought back the most offensive song contest. 
[00:46:00]  They didn't tell anybody.  No.  Peter.  Yo.  What's up?  Good God.  Are these guys serious?  How the hell could they even think to publish that?  Well, I don't know.  Oh, my God, that has got to be the worst thing I've ever heard in my whole life.  They're probably playing that song every other hour, if I know radio.  Oh, I heard it once.  I just wanted to drive off the road and stand in the rain and be miserable.  Coming up in an hour, we're going to be playing America Lives in Us. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, God.  You guys rule.  Take care.  All right.  We've got to give Rod and Fez credit.  I heard them on the way home last night.  They were playing that song and said, we've got to leave that one for O&A.  You could tear our buildings down, but you missed America.  You can burn our cities down, but you missed America.  You missed America.  Today.  Hey.  Our country, tis of thee.  Today, sweet land of liberty. 
[00:47:00]  Geez.  Wow.  Awful.  Neil picked up on that song right away.  Tara's really pissed off.  Tara?  Yes.  What's up?  About a week ago, I was listening to YSP in Philly, and Cousin Ed played that song.  Oh, no.  But it wasn't a song.  Some woman wrote an email and was circulating it around the Internet, so those guys didn't  even write it.  It's the exact same words.  Oh, so some lady wrote that as maybe a cute little poem or something. 
[00:47:30]  It was supposed to be like...  And then the Monsters of the Midday put it to music.  Monsters of the Midday.  Yeah, she was calling in...  America!  She was calling in an open letter to the terrorists.  All right, Tara.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I love open letters to people.  You only make open letters to people that are never, ever going to read the open letter.  Why do people in a time of tragedy have to show everybody how brilliant and deep they  are?  Nobody cares.  Exactly my point.  You know what the other thing radio stations across America are doing?  They're... 
[00:48:00]  Look, all right.  I know your intentions were nice and stuff, but they're getting like giant cards.  Pop tots?  Oh, cards.  Cards.  And having like their whole community sign it and say how sorry they are.  There you go.  They are.  Where's that going to go?  And they're going to bring it down to like Washington Square Park or Union Square Park.  That's great.  So we could all read the card.  Beats Gavin money.  You know, don't donate money.  Get the big card.  What the hell is the big card going to do?  You know, let me put a little taste of reality into that whole thing. 
[00:48:30]  Where do you think all those books are that people sign for Lady Di?  In the trash.  In the trash.  Who's reading those?  But it made the people feel good to write down their thoughts, Anthony.  Write them down and keep them on your table at home.  I'll be an Anthony.  Can't always watch Pardon the Interruption.  I want to make it exciting.  Now you can hear Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon on ESPN Radio.  Make the goalie make a save by the 24 second club. 
[00:49:00]  But you want to change it now and make it like women's basketball.  Tony.  He's going to jail in what should be the prime of his career.  And Wilbon.  David Stern, at the very least, allowed this All-Star game to be in Las Vegas.  Pardon the interruption.  Weekdays at 6.30 Eastern on ESPN Radio.  BTI.  XM 140.  Come in, Mother Bird.  This is Alpha Bravo.  This is it.  Come in, Mother Bird.  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.  All right.  This is how we do it. 
[00:49:30]  This is how we do it.  If you want to be with me, baby, there's a price to it.  Give me your heart and make it real.  Or else forget about it.  If you lived it, you get it.  XM 9.  Take a seat.  We're taking a trip down memory lane on XM 80s on 8.  My name is Rio.  Video killed the radio star.  E.T. phoned home. 
[00:50:00]  Bueller took a day off.  And the Berlin Wall came down.  The totally awesome 80s on 8.  She's a maniac, maniac.  I said you want to be starting something.  You got to be starting something.  It's just like being back there again when you punch into Channel 8.  The 80s on 8 on XM.  We will finally have a president who doesn't mind pulling over and asking for direction.  Am I right, please?  XM Radio, dedicated to the proposition that all voters have a right to 24-hour coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign, 
[00:50:30]  announces the arrival of POTUS 08.  POTUS 08 is the first-of-its-kind news channel devoted to coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign.  I don't believe Washington can be transformed by someone who's never tried doing such a thing before,  in any setting,  by someone who's never run a corner store,  let alone the largest enterprise in the world.  POTUS 08, 24-7 coverage of the presidential elections starting this month. 
[00:51:00]  Nonpartisan and commercial-free in the land of the free on XM Channel 130.  Now, let's have some fun.  Let the celebration begin.  POTUS 08, where everyone is an insider.  XM 401, the Boneyard, Arena Rock. 
[00:51:30]  Hairband.  Monthly Crew.  And Guitar God.  Boney!  Now, the Success Journal.  Here's Chris Whitting.  Two brothers named John and Horace were natural hands with mechanical stuff.  So, they opened a machine shop. 
[00:52:00]  Their first customer was a man named Oles,  who asked the brothers to build parts for a new car known as the Olesmobile.  John and Horace were soon earning cash.  But they noticed Mr. Oles was doing even better.  Deciding they'd sell cars too,  the brothers began building affordable, high-performance cars that went the distance.  Before long, sales were full speed ahead.  I'll bet you know John and Horace by their last name, Dodge. 
[00:52:30]  Thanks to the Dodge brothers' brains and business sense,  the Dodge name is still a legendary one in the automotive world.  It's still giving the competition a run for the money, and it's still a top seller.  With the Success Journal, I'm Chris Whitting.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.

[00:53:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  In the weeks following September...  That's wrong. Do it again.  In the weeks following September 11th,  the Opie and Anthony Show dedicated a number of...  dedicated a number of segments to...  Do you want to write this down?  No, I don't want to write it down.  I don't have a pen.  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy,  the Opie and Anthony radio program dedicated a number of segments 
[00:53:30]  to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs  and mocking the selfishness and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments.  Jesus H. Christ, holy shit, God bless America.  Can we get back to the tribute songs?  God, yes, please.  Oh, there's billions of these.  Put one with a lot of meaning in it.  Sorry.  This is one that was sent to us called...  American.  American.  American. 
[00:54:00]  By my fine friend Phil.  Oh, he copywrote the song.  Thank God.  Oh, is that what's happening?  Are the senators down there touring the zone?  No, I think they're back in Washington.  I don't think they're going to have an easy time getting down there.  Okay.  So here's another bad tribute song, Anthony.  It's called American.  Together we stand.  This united land. 
[00:54:30]  Shoulder to shoulder now we stand.  And act as one.  What a sickening sight.  In the broadest daylight.  Oh, my God.  Sweet, magical crap.  You never rhyme with the same word.  And just that line.  In the broadest daylight.  What a creep. 
[00:55:00]  The broadest daylight.  Hey, man.  Maybe it'll get better.  Relax.  A day I wish I never wanted to forget.  What?  Hold on.  A day I wish I never wanted to forget.  What the hell did he just say?  A day I wish that I never wanted to forget.  Don't make me rewind.  Don't make me rewind.  I wish I didn't have to want to forget this day.  Is what he's saying poetically.  Don't make me rewind. 
[00:55:30]  Let's move forward.  Can you explain it to me, please?  Think this will bring us to our knees?  We need some cheese.  A sleeping giant is awake and wants the fight.  An act like this you can't defend.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  What kind of message does it send?  Innocent lies are not a way to prove you're right.  Prepare for a fight. 
[00:56:00]  You asked for it right.  You asked for it right.  You've got it coming and there's nowhere you can hide.  Shut up.  As long as it takes.  Takes.  Bakes.  The effort will make.  Oh, man.  Why doesn't he rhyme something with stinks?  I used to hand in stuff like this to my third grade teacher and she would openly laugh at me. 
[00:56:30]  That's awful.  This is some really bad stuff.  Southern man.  The stuff I love when he says the first line because then I'm trying to guess what he rhymes  with and no matter how ridiculous I come up with a word, his is even worse.  All right.  We can play that.  We'll try to guess what he rhymes with.  Oh, good.  Whenever you say something backwards for the sake of a rhyme, like an effort will make,  you're awful.  Yeah, yeah.  Here we go.  Here we go.  So peace and quiet can sustain us for all time. 
[00:57:00]  Okay, get ready to stop it.  For the love of God, you must admit.  Okay.  The S word.  No.  Yeah, I can say that.  We're going to go and beat their shit.  No, we won't take it.  All right.  Admit.  Admit.  It.  They're going to quit.  It.  Oh.  We'll never quit.  We'll never quit.  I'm going to go with quit.  What are you going with?  I got it.  Yeah, okay.  This is a new game, what's in your pants?  Yeah, we'll go with quit.  I got it.  There must be better ways than this. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, shit.  This don't even rhyme.  Jack, you reckon the game.  What did he say there?  There must be better ways than this.  There must be better ways than this.  What did he whine there?  Admit and this.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's try the next line.  I can't believe you're God endorsing a homicide.  All right, get ready.  And I will honestly confess.  All right.  All right.  Confess.  Mess.  Mess.  This is one hell of a mess.  Something a mess? 
[00:58:00]  No, no.  I will honestly confess that.  I suck so badly I should be wearing a dress.  I will honestly confess that America's the best.  Something about best?  I have to go with that.  With us, you shouldn't mess.  I'm saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Turn it around.  I'm backwards again.  Nice, Norton.  Remember, he's not rhyming sometimes.  I know.  He can throw you off.  We're going with the rhyme this time.  And let's all go with mess. 
[00:58:30]  I'm going to say best.  Best?  Yeah.  I'm going with mess.  With Norton.  Mess?  Yeah, I'm going to say it's mess.  With us, you shouldn't mess.  All right.  Here we go.  I have no knowledge of your quest.  Quest?  Quest?  What is quest?  What the hell?  Awful.  I have no knowledge of your quest.  Knowledge of your quest.  That was the last time you heard the word quest.  Quest.  Quest.  He talks like C-3PO. 
[00:59:00]  I have no knowledge of your quest.  Shut up, Batu.  I have no knowledge of your quest.  He is a creep.  All right.  We might have one more rhyme here.  I hope so.  But suddenly I find myself right in your way.  How I grind for families torn apart.  All right.  Torn apart.  Heart.  This is breaking my heart. 
[00:59:30]  It's heart.  All right.  We're all going with heart.  Images that keep me awake at night.  More no one should have to destroy.  He's riffing.  He's riffing.  Come on.  Another.  Come on.  Come on.  More of a haiku.  It's descending.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Everyone coming to lend a hand.  Fighting for survivors to live again.  Makes a person know what it means to be. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, American.  All right.  American.  American.  All right.  American.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  A little secret when you hear a song with la, la, la, la's in it, the artist just ran out of words.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[01:00:30]  Can you explain it to me, please?  All right.  All right.  Please.  Knees.  Something about being brought to their knees.  I want a sandwich with some cheese.  Disease.  Please.  Would you explain it to me, please?  If you peel back Rick's foreskin, you'll find cheese.  Douchebag.  Please.  Please.  I think he did this one already.  In all fairness, it's knees.  They played us on Brother Weez.  Thought it would bring us to our knees.  To our knees? 
[01:01:00]  Awful.  Yeah, we'll go with knees.  All right.  Let me see.  There must be better ways than knees.  We're better ways than knees.  There must be better ways than knees.  So can't conceive and don't believe my ears or eyes.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Ha, la, la, la, la.  We're American.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Ha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Is that so utterly bad.  That was so much fun, though.  That was a fun game.  We should have been playing that with all of them.  Do we have more?  Yeah, we have plenty.  Thank God, because that is a fun game.  And you can play at home.  All right.  You can play along at home.  Well, we'll play more next.  How's that sound?  All right.  Still waiting for the John Valby song as well.  I hope.  I just eat green eggs in hand.  My name is Sam. 
[01:02:00]  I am.  I am.  Just all driveled.  I would eat it on a train.  I would eat it on a plane.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  La, la, la.  We're American.  La, la, la.  Never good in a song.  Awful always.  Always.  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy,  the Opie and Anthony radio program dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs 
[01:02:30]  and mocking the selfishness and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments.  God bless America.  Let's move on with the show with Uncle John.  What's up, Uncle John?  What I had, guys, I wrote a real quick song.  If you're going to take about 10 seconds, it talks about all these people writing songs.  Okay.  And basically it says, if you write a song about this tragedy, we should hang you from a friggin' tree.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  And that's it.  See you guys.  I like it. 
[01:03:00]  All right, Uncle John.  The songs are so bad.  Where's our next song?  Where's the next victim?  We need another song.  America.  Washington, D.C.  Spirit of America.  Washington, D.C.  It's from D.C.?  I guess that's where it's from, yeah.  Spirit of America.  All right.  Let's see if we can.  Hopefully we can play the same game.  Is this one that is being played all over the country?  What's the history of this song?  Which one?  Spirit of America, Washington, D.C.  Yeah, this is an original out of Washington, D.C.  A bunch of local musicians got together. 
[01:03:30]  La, la, we are the world.  Basically, yeah.  Oh, my God.  JFK's-  We are the world!  Huh?  JFK's not playing this, right?  They will right now.  Hey, I don't care who's playing it.  If it's bad, it's bad.  It might be good.  It might be, Jim.  Who's to say, gang?  All right.  It's Spirit of America.  These stars and stripes we wear are more than just symbols.  They embody every dream that every American has ever known.  Absolutely.  So look upon these faces of ours and know this now forever. 
[01:04:00]  These hearts you break, these lives you take, our will is made of stone.  That's me.  Private Pile!  Private Pile!  In the land of liberty, freedom reigns supreme.  All right, hit it.  Oh, God damn it.  What's the problem?  Hold on.  It's not on CD.  Yeah, go back.  Hold on.  Go back to that thing right there, that little thing. 
[01:04:30]  Right, okay.  Go.  Nice.  In the land of liberty.  No, no.  No!  You're ruining the game!  Stop!  Stop!  You guys are driving me nuts today.  I'm giving the international sign for the cue, you know, where you put your finger up in  the air and you're usually, okay, right here!  Right.  I didn't go right here!  I know.  I was still up here!  I saw this! 
[01:05:00]  No, I'm up here!  You wait for it, I'm down here!  Right, you put your finger up, keep it going, then the finger goes down, you stop!  Exactly!  That is true, Rick.  All right, let's see if we can regroup here and try this again.  Go ahead.  Play the tune.  In the land of liberty, freedom reigns supreme.  There you go.  So the word we're working on is supreme.  We're doing the rhyming game again?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Redeem.  Redeem.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Face full of cream.  It's not a porno song, Norton.  Redeem.  Dream.  Dream.  Dream.  Dream.  Dream.  Big Kev.  Nice call.  I'm going with Big Kev and dream.  Redeem or dream?  Wait, what was the line again?  We live free or something?  Something redeem.  I'm not listening.  I don't care because it never makes sense when you're taking the context of this song.  All right, so what are we going with?  I'm going with dream.  Okay.  Redeem. 
[01:06:00]  We're red and white and blue and black and yellow melt like rain.  What?  In the old...  Rain.  Like rain?  There was no rhyme.  Oh, you can't do it with a damn song that doesn't rhyme.  You know what?  Play a little bit of it so we get the gist of how it's structured.  Let's get a little vibe here.  All right, let's go.  Let's see how it's structured.  The power that defines our people has a name.  America. 
[01:06:30]  Monotonous.  Monotony.  They can try to burn our flags and shake our soul.  But the fabric that we're made of is too strong.  They can topple a hundred-story eminence to the ground. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  The records skip and hit it.  That's all you say?  They can?  We have lost our fellow brothers throughout the years.  And in times it seems...  Tears.  We even love the queers.  No!  Like a brilliant star that glows for all the world to see.  V.D.  We lift our hearts with passion. 
[01:07:30]  H.I.V.  See, he rhymed at that time.  This is so bad.  It's droning.  It's like a...  It's like a...  I picture this going through the heads of the soldiers during the Baton Death March.  And they're playing that song...  Do you hear that?  They're playing that song all over Washington, huh?  I'll be honest.  I don't think that one stinks.  I'm not crazy for it, but I don't hate it.  Dude, it's like...  That's horrible.  It wasn't as predictable, though, as the other ones. 
[01:08:00]  Well, I'll give him an A on unpredictability, but here's something.  Finish a sentence.  You've got to finish your sentence.  I'll agree with that.  I'll agree in, you know, certain words.  Run-on sentences never go.  I'll say equally stinks, but in a different way.  I don't like that one.  I can't go with that, although I can understand why you were both saying...  Out of all of them, I think that was the best out of all of them.  Oh, my God, you guys.  No, but if they're all bad, you've got to have one good one.  No.  No.  Tom.  I'm not saying it's true.  It's like the difference between dog crap and cat crap. 
[01:08:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Cat crap's smaller.  One will taste better, both awful.  But one will slide down the palate a little easier.  West Coast Dave, this is awful, the worst yet.  Yeah, I don't understand why you two guys are giving that guy some props.  That song sucks.  It was so monotonous and droning.  It just went...  It gives you that uncomfortable feeling because you don't know when the sentence is going to end.  But I like that when they throw me a little zinger that I'm not looking for.  The zinger. 
[01:09:00]  I like that occasionally.  Here comes a rhyme.  Oh, it's not a rhyme.  You can't pull those kind of shenanigans when you're writing these songs.  For the love of Eve, let's just simmer down in here.  All right, boo.  Eddie, what's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  How you doing?  I think you guys should be smashing that album like Opie does to Stalker Patty.  Eddie, trust me.  I would love to, but it's on a huge machine because it's not on CD.  All right.  I would destroy a $5,000 piece of equipment. 
[01:09:30]  I am capable of doing that, but not that.  I believe it.  I believe it.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you.  You guys are fantastic.  Thank you.  All right.  Do we have one more tribute song before we take a break?  We do have more, but there's another part of the song you guys got to hear.  Oh, really?  It just goes really bad.  It goes bad?  What do you mean it goes bad?  It is bad.  I agree, Rick.  I was enjoying that one a little bit.  I'm glad that somebody, albeit uncircumcised and gay, is on my side.  Sorry.  Don't throw things. 
[01:10:00]  Go ahead, Rick.  Forevermore.  Oh.  Oh.  That is a big fan.  Right, then you saw smoke coming out.  Everybody started running out.  And you saw the preview.  Right.  There was these clips.  Spirit of America that we show.  Spirit of America.  The children that we raise and seeds we sow.  Seeds we sow.  I just said grow.  You can choose to fight this land, or you can choose to understand the spirit of America. 
[01:10:30]  I can't believe you guys like this.  I withdraw my statement.  No, it doesn't get any worse.  I amend my statement.  The news clips took that from I could tolerate it to I now concur, it stinks.  Awful.  It stinks. 
[01:11:00]  The news clips did it for me.  Are you related to Helen Keller?  No.  What's wrong with your ears?  I wouldn't say I was enjoying that.  You said it wasn't that bad.  Compared to the other ones.  No.  There's no comparing.  It's so utterly bad.  That's like saying, you know, you're talking about dog ass.  It did a little bit sound like a mutual fund commercial.  Dog ass.  I was waiting for the pa-rum-pa-pum-pum part.  I actually like that song very much, too.  It's a fine Christmas song.  My God.  It is.  It's a fine number for the holidays.

Yes. 
[01:15:30]  Live at The Verge, an XM exclusive.  Hear it on The Verge.  XM 52.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  In the weeks following September 11th, the Opie and Anthony show dedicated a number of segments  to...  Do you want to write this down?  No, I don't want to write it down.  I don't have a pen. 
[01:16:00]  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy, the Opie and Anthony radio program  dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs and mocking the selfishness  and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments.  Jesus H. Christ, holy shit, God bless America.  Uh, where are we with the bad tribute songs?  Uh, let's see.  Evil Ways, bad cover by Prep Burger?  Yes.  Evil Ways?  Santana, yeah.  Ah, there you go. 
[01:16:30]  What's Prep Burger?  It's a, it's a, what do you call it?  Prep Burger?  One of those bad radio prep services that gives you all the stuff that you need to do a show?  Yeah, there's a...  I hate to tell everyone this.  Well, we have already, so...  Most of the radio shows in America, they rely on these prep services to get ideas for their  shows and stuff.  And there's one called Bitboard, and there's now one called Prep Burger?  Prep Burger. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, there's lots of them.  Usually they're pay.  You know, you gotta pay for them.  But some of them do give out those little free tidbits, which, ooh, I'm sure those are  just even better than the pay ones.  So, well, see, this is, this is the benefit of this tragedy is that they've opened up their  catalog of WTC tribute songs.  Thank God for them.  Yeah, you subscribe to some of these services, and they'll send you CDs with just bits.  Yeah.  Lots and lots of bits, and then you play it on your show, and then your audience thinks  it's you. 
[01:17:30]  How about the bits that they give you scripts?  Entire scripts?  You go in with the rest of your wacky morning show or something, and you all play the part  and do it.  Or how about the ones where they record one of the people in the bit, and you go into  the studio and do your voice in the blank areas.  They believe you're talking to, I don't know, a celebrity, right?  Hey, we're doing an interview with Muhammad Ali or something, and they'll supply the Muhammad  Ali guy.  Wait a minute. 
[01:18:00]  Then you put your voice in so you can, like, set up zany questions?  Zany questions.  They even write the zany questions for you.  You don't even have to come up with the zany questions.  It's all done.  So you record it, and it's like people think you did it.  Wow.  Even though it's being done in cities all across the country, but never overlapping cities  because that's a no-no.  Yeah, but what about the karaoke music they give you and the already scripted out lyrics  for the song parodies and stuff?  Yeah, and the tribute songs.  Are they funny, though, Rick?  Are they funny?  It's a pip.  They'll send you a song parody, pip, and you can play it as is, you know, someone else 
[01:18:30]  singing it, or they'll just send you, yeah, like Rick said, the music, and  you got the script, and you sing it like you wrote this song and put it together in  your production.  And nobody at the station puts the kibosh on that?  Oh, no.  And they're all knee slappers.  Wow, that sounds like fun.  A little rib tickler.  Kathy, you're on the radio.  I don't think it's right that you guys are making fun of all these tribute songs.  No?  Why not?  No.  Why?  Because our country's going through a lot right now, and if it makes somebody feel better 
[01:19:00]  to make a song and have everybody listen to it and have some emotion, and then you  guys are just...  Kathy, did you listen to what I had to say about that very topic an hour and a half ago?  No.  All right.  Rewind the Opie and Anthony show, and you'll hear exactly what we said about that.  All right.  So then you agree with me.  So why are you still doing it?  Because they're still really bad.  We understand why they're doing it.  But they're bad.  It doesn't change the fact that these are bad songs.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Is it making them feel better writing them?  I'm sure.  Sure.  They're expressing their pain in what they're going through.  But you know something?  These songs stink.  And musically, they suck.  I mean, at least they're trying.  At least they're trying to do something.  Wait.  But there's also something going on with these songs that Anthony mentioned earlier.  They're hoping that one of these songs catches on, and they make a name for themselves,  you know, by the song they came up with.  So you think there's ulterior motives?  But I think that now...  Oh, definitely.  But I don't think now people are thinking of ulterior motives.  I think they're thinking of the country.  No.  Well, you know, regardless, whatever they're thinking, whatever the reasoning, good, bad, 
[01:20:00]  bad, and different...  These songs stink.  All right.  All right.  Turn the phone up, you skank.  Guys.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  What?  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  If it makes them feel better to write it, is it wrong...  It makes us and a lot of the listeners feel better to make fun of it.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, my.  Wow.  That's a good thing.  You just got us out of this line.  Who sent him that line?  You see what I mean?  It's nice.  Who sent him that?  Kathy, there's no way you could have a comeback to that line. 
[01:20:30]  I don't.  I don't.  You shut me up.  No, it's just about making people feel good.  That's all it's about.  God bless.  Thanks for calling.  All right.  I'm getting off on the line.  We're going to have fun with a couple more, but, you know, it's all in good natured rhythm.  He used your own words against you.  I love that.  Well, I don't.  All right, Kathy.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  See, we're, yeah, bravo.  So what is this?  This is Evil Ways cover?  By Prep Burger.  Prep Burger.  Which means hundreds of radio stations across America have this song, and they're playing it not as a goof, right? 
[01:21:00]  Right.  This is serious.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Folks, get out your hankies.  You'll pay for all your evil ways, Bin Laden.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And soon we will punish you.  We're filled with rage, Bin Laden.  Oh.  And mark my words, your free life is through.  You can be running and hiding, but we'll hunt you down. 
[01:21:30]  Then we'll be boning and pounding you into the ground.  Then you'll be gone.  Lord knows you're going to pay.  Bin Laden.  That's great.  That's good stuff right there.  That's the whole song?  That's it.  Whoever that made feel better to write deserves to be unhappy.  They shouldn't feel better because that's terrible.  You know what?  At least it was short. 
[01:22:00]  I'll give them that.  They probably couldn't physically get through without vomiting.  That's brutal.  That's supposed to rile people up.  Yeah, let's go get them.  Stupid.  What's the next one?  Wind Beneath My Wings.  No, it's not.  I don't believe you.  Nobody is that stupid.  Wait, get on the mic.  Give me the history of this bad tribute song, please.  Again, it's off the wonderful service Prep Burger.  Prep Burger.  Good old Prep Burger. 
[01:22:30]  Two, two, two bad songs in one.  Oh, they got a catalog of crap.  Did they really?  Oh, yeah.  How many more do we have from Prep Burger?  It's going to take a while to download some more of them because some of them just totally suck and some of them are just all cluttered with bad stuff.  So it's just a matter of going through them and finding the worst ones.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  I just, your last commercial break, flipping around the tile here, I'm heading home.  PLJ just played the rhyming song. 
[01:23:00]  So I want you to, the one that was rhyming there.  The one that we were trying to figure out with.  I just wanted to let you know, though, we've got something in common with Scott Shannon there.  Yeah, of course we know.  Your program directors are the best, let me tell you.  That's embarrassing.  Horrible.  All right, Mike, thank you.  You're the best, man.  I saw you up at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh, thanks, man.  Oh, it was awesome, man.  You did a TV interview with somebody.  I'm sitting in a hotel, I'm laughing my ass off.  The guy didn't know what to say to you.  Thank you.  You're the best.  Thank you, Mike. 
[01:23:30]  Take it easy.  Okay.  So it's a wind beneath my wings.  Off the Prep Burger radio service.  Cool.  The nation would like to tell you thank you.  We never doubted that you were brave. 
[01:24:00]  What bad wedding was this recorded after?  The reason that we're spent protecting lives.  No day.  We hope you'll watch from heaven's eyes.  Want you to know that you're our hero.  We're a bunch of pansies. 
[01:24:30]  If we're sitting around enjoying this crap.  Wow.  Why don't we just surrender right now?  We're a bunch of pansies. 
[01:25:00]  The voice is thinner than Van Gundy's hair.  What the hell is that?  We're a guy against the sky against the sky.  So highly won.  A Nick Coach reference.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank God for you.  May our heroes rest in peace.  I agree with the sentiment, but she stinks.  She means well.  She stinks.  She means well. 
[01:25:30]  Smitty, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on, kids?  Hey.  You guys were looking for a song yesterday that you guys heard from the 70s.  One of those horrible songs.  Was it Billy Don't Be a Hero?  No.  No.  No?  No.  That song sucked anyway.  It is awful.  All right, Smitty.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Billy Don't Be a Hero.  Don't be a fool with your life.  Cracklin' Rosie, get on board. 
[01:26:00]  We're going to ride till there ain't no more.  I don't know what I said here.  Nick.  The old diamond ride.  What's up, man?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  All right.  If I got to listen to another one of these goddamn songs,  I hope they attach me to the first bomb that we dropped in Afghanistan.  This is the worst thing I've ever heard in my damn life.  That's what they should actually do, just send these over until they all just surrender.  Oh, yeah.  Ben Liam would come running out of the country with his hands up.  I give up.  I give up.  Well, it's obvious to us, but there's radio stations playing these as serious tribute songs. 
[01:26:30]  They're playing them in honor.  You guys are at least playing them, making fun of them.  All right.  I could see you getting wasted and, like, making funny songs with your friends,  but to send them into radio stations, this is asinine.  Well, then the radio stations turn around and play them, though.  That's the scary part.  Yeah.  What are they smoking?  All right.  Thanks, Derek.  All right, boys.  Hey, where's our – do we have one more?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, where do we go?  Where was that one from AJ or whatever his name was?  Oh, Ace and TJ. 
[01:27:00]  Ace and TJ.  Yeah.  Ace and TJ.  Is this a –  That's a radio duo, right?  They're a couple of boys out of Charlotte.  Oh, out of Charlotte.  Yeah, but this is like –  Goddamn.  I guess this is like a real country song or something,  and they just added their own drops to it.  And I think one of them is actually –  you hear one of them, like, he's actually commenting,  watching it on TV in the beginning.  Oh, bro.  No, he's not.  I don't believe that.  It couldn't be that awful.  What's the song?  I don't know.  All right.  I don't recognize it. 
[01:27:30]  We'll listen for a minute here.  Go ahead.  Hey, it's 857.  We are watching an unbelievable scene on television.  Today, we've had a national tragedy.  Holy ass.  Get rid of the fake radio voice.  Hey, we're watching an unbelievable tragedy.  Who's we?  Me and my lover.  We're watching an unbelievable tragedy.  What?  Yeah, if you're live on the radio while that whole mess was going on,  I mean, if that doesn't, you know, knock your radio voice out of your head, 
[01:28:00]  then I don't know what will.  Hey, we're here.  This is an unbelievable tragedy.  This tragedy is sponsored by Lay's Potato Chips.  You know, you can't get out of radio mode.  What an awful, despicable business.  Wouldn't your reaction be, holy ass?  Yeah.  That's why the videotapes take it from the street.  We would hear people screaming like anybody else.  We're the hardest to watch.  Of course I would scream that.  Yeah.  All right, can you start that over?  Let's hear that. 
[01:28:30]  There we go.  Hey, it's 8.57.  We are watching an unbelievable scene on television.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And he has to do a time check.  Hey, it's 8.57.  The weather, we're looking at 79 degrees, partly cloudy,  and I'm watching an unbelievable situation.  72 degrees at 8.57.  And we'll tell you about the unbelievable situation I'm watching right after this.  So stick around.  After a twofer from Leonard Skinner, the big radio tease.  What the?  It's doing time checks.  No, it should be holy ass. 
[01:29:00]  What the F is this?  Hey, it's 8.57.  We are watching an unbelievable scene on television.  Today, we've had a national tragedy.  Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country.  Oh, my God.  The second building that was hit by the plane has just completely collapsed.  The whole side has collapsed.  The whole building has collapsed.  Massive casualties here at the moment.  It happens so fast.  It happens so fast. 
[01:29:30]  Everything was a blur.  Everyone came by and said how sorry they were.  This stinks.  We all concur.  I knew that they meant well.  So I tried to force a smile.  And they said I should be thankful.  And that I had them for a while.  And I can't get a hold of them.  But now all my friends and my family have gone home. 
[01:30:00]  Yee-haw.  I'm just left here sitting with my memories all alone.  I've always heard that God does everything right.  I just wish my angels weren't in heaven tonight.  May God bless the victims of their fingers. 
[01:30:30]  Turn it off.  I know there is something I have to do.  Something's only God inside.  That won't stop this hurting.  Wow.  That's horrible.  God, was that funny?  Oh, God. 
[01:31:00]  Awful.  Why would you want to listen to that and get even sadder than you are?  Oh, that made me laugh.  Why would you want to be sadder?  It's like a Food Emporium commercial.  That guy is brutal.  Mike, what's going on?  Not much.  I got halfway through that Wind Beneath My Wings song, and the tears just started welling up my eyes.  Really?  It wasn't emotional.  I started to puke, and the vomit was running in my nostrils.  Kathy lady said that it made her feel better when she listens to these songs. 
[01:31:30]  It makes me feel better to stand naked in front of a girl's high school, but it doesn't mean I can do it.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  Wow.  Try some of the lower grade schools.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, you're next on the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, I just wanted to say these songs, you know, I mean, they're riveting.  I'm getting chills listening to these songs.  I think, really, the only thing that could warm me up is a bunch of Afghanis on fire.  Well, we can only hope. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Thanks.  In a related note, the weather for the next week, next weekend.  We got it.  We got the email.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Dave.  Bye-bye.  Dave?  Bye-bye.  I bet it was going to be really hot and mushroom cloudy.  What is the forecast for Afghanistan?  Afghanistan, it's going to be 2,000 degrees.  2,000 degrees.  Oh, ho, ho.  Partly cloudy.  Is that gem circling the email circuit? 
[01:32:30]  Of course.  All right.  We finally got John Valby's new song.  We were goofing on the one he sent in last week, so he went back to the drawing board,  and he's trying again here, Anthony.  All right.  Is this one good, Ray?  It needed a lot of cleaning.  Oh, a lot of cursing?  Did this get through the center?  Yeah, it got through.  All right.  Here we go.  John Valby's latest creation.  Oh, he's got them Taliban blues.  I know a guy, his name's Osama, but Afghanistan has fucked his mama. 
[01:33:00]  He's hiding in a cave, and it comes in pajama with a snob, and the crack of a crusty old mama.  He ain't been lotting, but he ain't been lotting.  Oh, he got them Taliban blues.  He ain't the USA and what we stand for, so the Taliban's declaring a holy war.  When our bombs begin to hit, the only thing they'll be declaring is, holy shit. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, Bin Laden.  Hey, hey, Bin Laden.  Oh, we got them Taliban blues.  Oh, we got them Taliban blues.  Hey, Osama.  George W. Bush is a loving guy, and he knows you're lonely.  That's the reason why.  He's given a national monument to be your companion.  Gonna turn your cave into the Grand Canyon.  Hey, Bin Laden.  Hey, hey, Bin Laden. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, we got them Taliban blues.  He's got a beaver on his face, a diaper on his head.  Before too much longer, he's gonna be dead.  And when he dies, he might see God, that's true.  But he's gonna find out that God's a Jew.  Hey, Bin Laden.  Hey, hey, Bin Laden.  Oh, we got them Taliban blues.  All right, one more.  Five times a day, they stop and pray. 
[01:34:30]  But soon they'll be bowing to the USA.  Hey, and all you bastards that support jihad, open your mouth, here comes all the same.  Hey, Bin Laden.  Hey, hey, hey, Bin Laden.  Oh, we got them Taliban blues.  All right, there you go.  The latest of John Valdez.  There you go.  A little better than, uh...  Can we get the unedited version up on the website?  We're gonna get you.  Yeah, we could probably do that.  It's better than we're gonna get you.  I enjoyed this one very much. 
[01:35:00]  It had a little more spirit behind it.  I like that.  That's more John Valby.  Yeah, we're also getting, uh, cleaning up his spoken word thing that he sent us, too.  He did a spoken word?  Steve's got it.  Hold on.  Any more tribute songs, uh, Rick?  We got a few more.  I like these.  You liking this hit?  Oh, yeah.  One of, uh, our Sacramento competitors.  I saw him, they're playing on their airwaves.  Oof.  Laszlo from Brooklyn, uh, about the Valby song.  This is a bit better.  But the first one was so bad that it's funnier. 
[01:35:30]  Hmm.  Interesting little...  Turmoil John's gonna have to overcome there.  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy, the Opie and Anthony radio program dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs and mocking the selfishness and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments.  God bless America.  We cleaned up the John Valby spoken word.  And do we have one more tribute song that we can play today, Rick?  Yeah, I just, uh, finished it.  All right.  Well, let's, while you get that, let's, let's, let's play the John Valby spoken word. 
[01:36:00]  Spoken word?  Yeah, I think it's one of those poems he does.  Oh, okay.  You guys said you hate poems, but, uh, let's see what, what John's got up his sleeve, okay?  All right.  Here's to Osama Bin Laden.  That towelhead scum.  May the U.S. blast his ass to Kingman Hunt. 
[01:36:30]  He's a bagless wonder that lives in a cave.  May Marines piss Budweiser on that cocksucker's drag.  Osama, being a chicken shit faggot, lives off camel turds with a topping of maggot.  Osama thinks we don't have the guts to come and blow off his Islamic nuts.  But now America is done with his crap. 
[01:37:00]  So let's just move the fuckers off the map.  So here's to Osama, that son of a bitch.  May his pecker fall off with a seven-year itch.  And may they beat on his balls with a big brass hammer till his asshole whistles the star spangle a bag. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  There you have it.  USA!  All right.  USA chant.  I'm assuming Steve from foundrymusic.com will put the unedited version of that on the website as well.  This is great.  I have a little problem.  Hold on.  Yeah.  With John Valvey.  What?  I've been going to see John Valvey for 15 years.  Yeah.  I've heard that same poem, but instead of Osama bin Laden, it's been Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, and the Ayatollah. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Well, insert bad guy here.  Insert bad guy here poem from John Valvey.  I wonder if he'll call the defendant himself.  Listen to part of this comment from U.S. Representative John Cooksey, the Republican from Louisiana.  Someone wearing a diaper on his head should be expected to be interrogated.  Wow.  John Cooksey, Republican, Louisiana. 
[01:38:30]  Salute.  Yeah, people just not happy.  Nice.  A diaper on his head.  Oh, you've got to love that.  And I hope it's with that Louisiana drawl.  Someone wearing a diaper on his head can expect to be interrogated.  That is so great.  A diety.  That's great.  All right.  So, back to the bad tribute songs.  Yeah.  Okay, what do we got, Rick?  We got hundreds of these, dude.  Yeah.  We're just going to pepper them in. 
[01:39:00]  We all know the Lee Greenwood song, God Bless the USA, that's now popular again.  We do?  Yeah, it's the one everybody's playing.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, somebody decided they're going to redo it because God Bless the USA wasn't enough.  They decided to add in some more stuff and make it their own.  It's pretty terrible.  A station in Sacramento's playing this?  No, this one is, this is another charmer off Prep Burger.  Another one from Prep Burger.  Okay, here we go. 
[01:39:30]  I'm nauseous already.  It's awful.  It's the time to show the world we're strong.  We won't be terrorized.  Evil's not allowed to win.  When you've got heaven on your side.  It's for the ones we've lost  that we stand up strong today  because the flag still stands for freedom  and they won't take that away. 
[01:40:00]  Break out your lighters, everyone.  Yeah.  And we're standing strong as Americans  where at least we know we're free  and we won't forget  the ones who died on that Tuesday morning  and we're going to stand up  and see it through  and it's never until today  because we'll never fall  because we'll never fall  when we are set 
[01:40:30]  God bless the USA  Take it to Lee Miles  Take it to Lee Miles  Standing strong as Americans  where at least we know we're free  and we won't forget  the ones who died on that Tuesday morning  and we're going to stand up  and see it through  and defend her still today 
[01:41:00]  because we'll never fall  when we are set  God bless the USA  These songs make us look like  a bunch of pansies.  Just a whole nation of Marys.  Marys.  A bunch of pansies.  Who's in their car cranking that up?  No one.  No one is.  No one. 
[01:41:30]  Thank you.  Prep Burger.  Not even him.  Thank you.  Gay Marco.  Hey.  Oh wait.  The somber hey.  I know.  Hey.  I know.  Know what it is?  It's like the somber Brady Bunch theme.  Remember that?  Remember you watched the Brady Bunch  and when they were like  they're doing something fun  it was  And then Greg gets caught smoking  and the father and mother 
[01:42:00]  have a talk with him.  Do do do do do.  Do do do do do do.  It wasn't his jacket though.  Of course not.  When they have that talk.  What disease does dad have?  Oh god.  Oh my god.  So we got the somber hey.  Yes.  Can I hear the somber hey again?  Hey.  Hey.  That sounds like the tired hey 
[01:42:30]  after you were  you got banged  gang banged.  A whole night.  Oh my god.  That's like hey.  Now.  Oh now.  So what's up Marco?

[02:00:00]  Before the liver transplant  Eyes  Then I cry out  Skies  That we've been wrong  That we've been wrong  As I swallow my  My helpless pain  And who do you think you are  A driver claims into my perfect home  What?  At least if you're going to do a tribute song  Make it so we can hear the words 
[02:00:30]  Apparently his studio  His recording studio is a dumpster  Yeah  But when you get off  And will you pay  Cause I'm raging  I'm hating  The face pasted on the TV  That's what Mama Cat sounded like  Before she choked on the ham sandwich  And bomb that terrorist land  Cause I'm going to do my  My evansions 
[02:01:00]  We stand up a nation  Okay  Wow  That was incredibly bad  That was so bad it was good  Thank you  Did it come all the way around  To be good?  It came good  It was so bad that all of a sudden  You look on the other side  It's like hey it's back to go  What happened?  It's so good  What happened?  It's sing  He sings because he loves  That was the naked cowboy  I'm raging  He was doing that  Between support calls  For H. Hewlett-Packard  It was a little down time 
[02:01:30]  Nobody's office jet was broken  So he had time to record a song  Which one's this?  This one's called  A Call to Solidarity  Nice  A American kicks the ass out of every other country  A American kicks the ass out of every other country  8.30 a.m.  September 11th, 2001 
[02:02:00]  The sun glistened upon two towers  At the corner of an island  On the edge of a metropolis  Filling with men and women  Workers and employers  Some drew their shades  While others enjoyed the prism  Of the Tuesday light  The west coast still asleep  While middle America turned to the horizon  Is that Ed Wall from The Tonight Show?  The buildings, people, and trees  Split the light  And changed its direction  As it came from the heavens above  While four airplanes  Cast shadows on the earth  That would soon bring darkness 
[02:02:30]  To a nation  Is this a book report?  8.46 a.m.  September 11th, 2001  The world  Changed  Today we've had an actual tragedy  Changed  We had people jumping out the windows  I knew a disaster was about  Changed  Yeah, this really gives you a sense  Over 200 years  Wars have come and gone  Threats have been met and conquered  Have you done?  And this year, John  Has been looked in the face  And sent back to hell  For over 200 years  America has grown  From its simple root 
[02:03:00]  I think I was being brainwashed  And Kevin Eubanks  And the NBC band  I think I was being brainwashed  Bop  Okay  Bop  Alright  What's the next one?  War?  That was really bad  War  Good God, y'all  Is it done for that one?  War  Good God, y'all  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing  Coming to America  Cracklin' Rosie  Get on board  Alright, another one, Anthony 
[02:03:30]  They're coming in like crazy  War  Shadows grow so long  Before my eyes  I think we should hold hands  What the hell?  Pramp  Fireflies  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah  If ever there would be an inappropriate time to use that  We need a talk box for it  Get what, man? 
[02:04:00]  Do you feel this darkness?  Okay, good  We can play the rhyme game, maybe  Is the soul shining bright  To right?  Fight, fight, fight  Flowing truth through the blindness  Light, light, fight  Spreading wings for the flag  Flight!  God damn it  God damn it  Ah, very instrumental 
[02:04:30]  Give you time to reflect on his last verse  This is like the Aaron Brown of music  The battle's growing closer  The battle's growing closer  There's a quick flash  Okay, night, night  Now it's gotta be fight  Of course  He already used fight  No, I'm gonna say light  Because he's doing night  Night, light  That's, I'm going with light  I gotta go with fight again  Alright 
[02:05:00]  Bite  Bite?  This bite  I'm gonna say boop  I told you not to bite  I'll say fight  Oh, where are you going?  I want might  You want might?  Alright, let's get that  Stupid enough  Joining up with the soldiers  Here we go  Fight  I'm in  We come together for the fact  Yeah, we're not  It's a few guns  We've been hit by surprise 
[02:05:30]  Surprise  Surprise  Creamy thighs  No?  No?  It might not even be a rhymey line  I'd say eyes  It's the chorus  Watch out for the smelly flies  Surprise  Pumpkin pies  Disguise  Disguise  Disguise  Be brave, my friends  Though the enemy tries  Dies  Goddamn enemy tries  What?  Oh my God 
[02:06:00]  Who saw that coming?  To blacken our hearts  With hatred and lies  Lies  It's a few rhymey words  None of which we picked  Guys  Guys  I'm going with creamy thighs now  This time we will not lose  Go-go's on our knees in my eyes  I said I do  I said I, guys  You said I  Earlier, but earlier  I missed it  It was the wrong one 
[02:06:30]  But I guess  Wrong song  Wrong song  Pick up your guns  We must go on and on  Stand in the way of the  Bill of the things  That can't be great  Don't you want to survive  Alive  Survive, alive  Don't you want to survive  Take it back down, John Lennon  Underneath this darkness 
[02:07:00]  Hey, wait, wait  Hold on  Now, here it comes  It's a soul shining bright  Bright  Bright  Again  With the ite  Again with the ite sound  Might is a pleasant  They've already used fight  But he's going to use it again  It's fight again  I'm going to say  Flight  Flight  It's stupid 
[02:07:30]  How about sight  It could say sight  What do you think?  Might  Fight  I'm going to say might  Might  Might  Might  Might  I'm going to say flight  It's fight  Something about taking flight  I don't know  I'll know  It's I have no sight  Is that it?  I think he really wants to let us know he's blind  How about it's every man's right  Ah  Don't fly a kite  Yeah  Blowing truth through the blindness  Sight 
[02:08:00]  Sight  It's going to be night  We come together for the fight  It's the same line  That's lazy  Do not ring that bell  There's no creativity there  Oh my god  Use the same line again  Pick up your guns  Pick up your guns  We've been hit by surprise  We've been hit by surprise  We've been hit by surprise 
[02:08:30]  All right, well there you have it there  Enough of that  Why don't they have some nice, easy songs that we play the rhyming game to?  In the weeks following the September 11th tragedy, the Opie and Anthony radio program dedicated a number of segments to making fun of 9-11 tribute songs and mocking the selfishness and insincerity displayed in them.  This is one of those segments  God bless America  You know, we've been playing the bad World Trade Center tribute songs.  Tally, what was the other one that you paid at $3.30? 
[02:09:00]  They're awful  Oh, the tally man  Yeah, we hate that one  Yo, why don't we get the person who wrote that down here real quick so I can punch him in the face  That's awful  Oh, D, we're getting about 10 of these a day at this point  Everyone is trying to capitalize and everyone's trying to come up with that one song that everyone is going to, you know, latch on to and go, wow  This says it all for all of us, man  Come on, man  What do they think?  They're going to get a record deal after all this is over?  Dude, the world changed on September 11th  Don't come out here with your calm ball music  You ain't trying to amuse me with that, punk 
[02:09:30]  You know?  O.D.  He's trying to set it off on this point, you know what I mean?  Well, O.D., one came in  It has kind of a hip-hop clave to it  A hip-hop  So I want to get your honest opinion, all right?  Because we don't know, we're too white for this crap  It's called USA Holla If You're With Me  Holla if you're with me  And they don't spell holler like you and I, Anthony  It's holla  For the record, it stinks already  It's H-O-L-L-A  Holla  Is that one of the words of the hood these days? 
[02:10:00]  Holla back, my man  Give me a holla  Holla  And this is sponsored by Old Dirty's drug of choice that he's selling  It's called placebo  Get on board  Sales are down another 15%  I want the whole workforce cutting half  And the name of the band is Mixed Bread  Let's do it  Whether we bring our enemies to justice  Or bring justice to your enemies  Justice will be done  There is no way they can run 
[02:10:30]  Here we come  Here we come  There is no way they can run  Here we come  Here we come  There is no way they can run  Here comes freedom  There is no way they can run  Here we come  Here we come  God bless America, land that we love.  Thank you.  Stand beside her, and guide her, through the night with her life on the road.  There is nowhere they can run, here we come. 
[02:11:00]  There is nowhere they can run, here we come.  There is nowhere they can run, here comes freedom.  There is nowhere they can run, here we come.  What do you think, yo?  Come on.  Oh, man.  What do you think?  What is that crap?  He made that on a Casio 50 and tried to make some beats, yo.  Oh, my.  What's wrong with the beats?  Freedom.  I hear some good beats in the song.  And it sounded like the cat that sold me my coffee in the morning down at the 7-Eleven. 
[02:11:30]  What's wrong with the beats?  The beats are a little too simple.  Here we come.  He made that at Casio 50.  Yeah, that.  He made that at Casio 50 and tried to make some beats.  Yeah.  What's that?  Fat boys, right?  Remember the fat boys on me?  See?  I'm down with it.  Yeah.  I'm down with it.  I'm down with the fat boys.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'm down with it.  Yeah.  I'm down with the life I'm above. 
[02:12:00]  Boom, boom.  Nowhere to run.  Boom, boom.  Nowhere to run.  Boom, boom.  Big bombs are done.  Boom, boom.  USA number one.  Either you were with us.  Yeah.  Or you were with the terrorists.  Yo, can I break guys' CD, dude?  God bless our marriage.  What about that section with the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Nothing, yo.  Boom, boom.  We failed after, like, the first five seconds, dude.  You know what?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Boom, boom.  Get rid of that. 
[02:12:30]  One more verse.  One more verse before you turn it off.  Great justice to your hands.  Justice.  Wow, this is awful.  Y'all ready to fight?  Y'all ready to fight?  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  I can't hear you.  That's automatic.  All right.  That awful revolutionary drum roll.  Yeah.  I lied, by the way.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  That's MC Hammer.  Okay.  MC Hammer.  Yes.  Yo, you remember MC Hammer?  MC Hammer had a jumbo jet.  That's how much money the brother was making.  Hammer time.  I heard he's totally penniless.  He had one of the best behind the music ever.  Dude.  Didn't he look like 30 mil?  He had so much money.  He had that house that he built that was beautiful.  The jumbo jet.  His posse was huge and just milking, milking the teat.  That was MC Hammer. 
[02:13:30]  And he ended up just being like broke.  Completely broke.  Yeah, the best thing that happened to MC Hammer was the 24-7 girls.  You remember that?  Oh, yeah.  What's the 25-7?  I don't know.  It wasn't.  What's the 24-7 girls?  Well, you know.  Three.  It wasn't.  What?  Look at these two homies arguing with each other.  There's 352 days in a year, man.  What you talking about?  I'm talking about 24-7.  It was 35-7.  The chick's name.  That was his dance.  It was 35-7 girls.  What was that? 
[02:14:00]  A leap year?  They added a week?  I thought it was 352.  All I know is their name and how good they look.  That's all I know.  Yeah, man.  Do you guys actually understand each other?  You know what I mean?  Come on, PR.  What's up, PR?  Are you all right?  What's up?  I had fear my man PR was down near ground zero, dude.  How was that that day, dude?  Yeah, there was a little scare with the PR.  How close were you, PR?  I was about six blocks away.  That's not far enough. 
[02:14:30]  It was sick.  Everyone was scared, but, you know, I can't add nothing that y'all...  No, I know.  All right.  It's just...  What corner on down by the...  What corner was it that you were selling on?  Yo, no, wait a minute.  This is it.  Yo, Anthony, what's the best?  Ah, shut up.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Stay right there.

Friends, in view of the menacing world conditions in which we find ourselves today,  this message may be the most important your radio has ever brought to you. 
[02:16:30]  Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships and sea.  Let's go to press.  The XM Radio User's Guide.  The Emergency Alert Channel.  I want the truth.  XM's Emergency Alert Channel is channel number 247.  It provides critical updated information before.  Now tell me what happened.  During.  What it may be isn't clear yet.  And after emergencies across the country.  The only thought left was the paralyzing fear that it could happen again today or tomorrow.  Should an emergency strike in your area, tune in to XM Channel 247. 
[02:17:00]  We'll provide you with the latest information that may impact you and your family's safety.  Thank you, XM.  The XM Radio User's Guide.  There's a lot of technology packed in your XM receiver.  What's all this about?  If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.  We want you to understand it and use all of the services XM has to offer.  The XM Radio recognize the obligations very early.  The Verge XM 52 plays new music.  We play new music, emerging music.  And we play it now.  Now it's your rights versus mine. 
[02:17:30]  First with the new pornographers.  Tegan and Sarah.  Stars.  Broken social scene.  Arcade fire.  The stills.  The weaker than.  I can't believe it.  Miracle Fortress.  Patrick Watson.  The tears.  Young Galaxy.  Apostle of Hustle.  Besner Litz.  Feist.  Always first.  Always now.  The Verge.  New, emerging now.  XM 52.  And now, a minute with the New York Times.  Here's health and nutrition columnist Jane Brody.  Lightning, as everyone knows, is not supposed to strike in the same place twice, let alone four times. 
[02:18:00]  But that's just what it did for Jessie Grumman, who has faced four life-threatening diagnoses in her 53 years.  Hodgkin's disease, cervical cancer, viral pericarditis, and colon cancer.  After each, she's managed to bounce back to live a normal working life.  And she decided to convey what she's learned from these experiences by writing a very useful book,  Aftershock, What to Do When the Doctor Gives You, or Someone You Love, a Devastating Diagnosis. 
[02:18:30]  In consulting more than 250 others, patients, family members, and health care providers,  she found that a common mistake is to rush into treatment, slow down, do a little homework,  learn as much as you can about the disease and its treatment,  and take the time to find doctors who are highly experienced at treating it.  This is Jane Brody of the New York Times.  In studio, Christopher Titus! 
[02:19:00]  Hello, if you're a circus freak, call in, we'll help you through it.  Yeah, for our counseling sessions that we're having now.  Hey, the 97-year-old guy didn't sing Angelica!  He was doing that, did he?  We gave her the rape hotline and the geriatric rape hotline.  Yeah, right?  I blame Viagra.  Right.  You pop three at one time, my friend, you're going after anybody.  You get a 97-year-old guy that does Viagra, all of a sudden his junk starts working?  What do you think? 
[02:19:30]  What do you think?  He's going to look at a 97-year-old woman and go, let's get it on!  Exactly.  First of all, there ain't no woman Viagra, so that thing is just like a desert.  Right, so he figured that this 12- or 13-year-old girl will be the one.  Well, he shouldn't have gone all the way to the other end of the spectrum, you know?  Get a nice spring chicken of 55 or something.  A lot of people don't know what they do when they wake up after the Viagra.  They're not sure.  Right, maybe all the blood rushed out of his head and he just went wild.  Now, before they had Viagra, I'm hanging out with my dad at the Oakland Rosa show and  walking around.  He's married to this new woman and we're walking around and he's going, he had to shoot a needle 
[02:20:00]  into his f***.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm telling you.  No, hold on, hold on.  We're just cleaning up because they dumped out of that.  I don't know why.  Believe me.  It makes no sense.  Believe me, we understand.  It makes no sense.  You should be able to say that because it's a medical thing and that's what he had to do.  So, put the needle into his...  He did.  My father had to get...  I want to...  But you can't say the P word for the guy's thing.  You could say mule.  We say yam bag.  We say junk.  You got it.  So, here's the thing.  My dad's junk is not working as well as it should because he had a couple of heart  attacks. 
[02:20:30]  Four.  Your dad had four.  Yeah, they actually revoked his organ donor card.  Oh.  Yeah.  So, he's talking to me.  We're just talking.  He's father-son talking.  He's freaking me out.  We're walking around the Oklahoma street and he goes...  He's going, yeah, so before the Viagra thing, I had this needle and he had to shoot it.  And he goes, one day, he goes, I figured...  They give me...  They say 10 cc's you shoot in.  And I figured...  So, my dad goes...  Shoot in right...  Right into the...  The junk.  Yeah, into the junk.  And he goes...  He goes, I think 10 cc's supposed to what I'm doing.  The doctor says, don't use it anymore in 10 cc's.  Well, I'm thinking, you know, I want to perform for the new lady.  Can I slow you down a little bit?  Yeah.  Because I don't get it. 
[02:21:00]  So, before Viagra...  But what do you...  Oh, before Viagra, there was something you could...  Yes, my dad got married to this woman, right?  Right.  And he wanted to make sure she...  But what does this stuff do?  It does what Viagra does.  Yeah, yeah.  No, actually, I think it took the...  It probably takes the place of the blood that would normally go there to put it in the state...  No, it was a chemical.  It was something because it would ever constricted everything so it would...  Oh, my God.  Really?  Wow.  So his junk would expand.  Hey, is that good?  I did the job.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  All right.  I'm just kidding.  So my dad's talking to me. 
[02:21:30]  He goes, yeah, just like tossing it off.  He goes, so I'm going to use it right.  And he goes, I figure 10 cc's.  They said, you know, 10 cc's is my normal.  I'll do 30 cc's.  So my dad's junk turned.  He goes, my junk turned black.  And he goes, and it took 11 hours.  11 hours to go down.  And I'm literally like just boat over laughing.  That's funny.  I couldn't imagine having to put a needle. 
[02:22:00]  No.  No.  I'm getting that feeling.  Don't you get that feeling down there when somebody even talks about it?  Yeah.  It's like, ah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I can't imagine any woman in the classroom going, you know, you are so sexy.  Give me my syringe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See how important it is?  Let's do it.  What?  See how important sex is to guys?  If you're willing to take a needle and jam it into your junk, it's a pretty important thing.  Exactly.  It's better perspective for all the ladies out there.  Hey, what happened to Happy Face?  He was calling back after the commercials and no Happy Face. 
[02:22:30]  Dice down at Ground Zero.  We're a little distracted, Christopher Tide, because Dice called all emotional.  He wasn't in the right state of mind to be on our show.  Oh, it was at Ground Zero.  Then we found out he was going down to Ground Zero.  We want to see how that went for him.  I'm just imagining the guys that are down there now working are probably like, all right,  you know, De Niro was here a few months ago, and we just really want to pave this road and  get this done.  Exactly.  You know, enough with the visits.  Yeah.  We're doing our job, and, you know, enough with the visits. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Well, it just becomes a little more about the personality that's going down there than it does  like about Ground Zero.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, if you want to go down.  I got my superhero jacket on with the studs.  If you want to go down and not tell the press you're going, I kind of buy that you want  to see it, but if you're going, hey, you know, tell everybody no, you're going down to  Ground Zero.  Yeah.  It's not as, not as.  I think he's paying his respects, but it's a little weird.  Yeah.  You think you got a tear up when he's looking around?  Of course you did.  Hey.  Yeah.  I'm getting a little choked up over here.  I have no problem admitting it. 
[02:23:30]  I went down there.  I bawled.  It's just amazing.  Well, we were in L.A.  Here's what pissed me off about it is that people in L.A. were like, I'm not going to  work.  Really?  You're in L.A. and you're not going to work.  Yeah.  Look at the people there, that word happened, are busting their ass.  Yeah.  You know, don't let these people.  Why isn't L.A. going to work?  Huh?  Why wouldn't L.A. go to work?  I know.  The day it happened, like I called the crew, I talked to my partners and they said, what  do you want to do?  I said, well, I think these guys are putting out fires and saving lives.  We should probably keep going.  Don't let these terrorists win and all.  You know, and what the hell's going on with terrorists?  You know, any country that doesn't listen to their women is going down. 
[02:24:00]  Because you know, Dan, where there was some chick that was serving them food while they  were planning that thing.  And she goes, pardon me, what did you say?  You're going to what?  No, don't yell at me, okay?  When your ass got lost in the desert last year, who got you to Jalalabad?  That was me, my friend.  Okay, I'll say that before you hit me with a stick.  But I want you to know I only made you cold sandwiches because you won't let me learn  to read a freaking recipe book.  See, that's another problem they got.  There's a whole sex angle, right?  They cover their women up.  I go on.  They put them in their robes.  Right. 
[02:24:30]  And they don't get to look at attractive women.  No, they don't get to look at attractive women.  I think that loosens you up a little bit.  I think so.  You know what?  If you're getting your junk waxed, is that okay?  Very good.  I'm doing what I can't do.  You have the toughest, edgiest radio station in the country.  You just junk waxed.  That's silly, I know.  Hey, Dice is on the phone.  Dice on the phone.  This isn't Dice.  Oh, Dice?  Dice?  Well, actually, it's Happy Face in there.  Hang on.  See, Happy Face has to call for Dice.  Happy Face calls for Dice. 
[02:25:00]  Okay, now he's getting the legend.  What a crappy phone.  This gets so freaking old after a while.  Who's Happy Face?  Dice.  Happy Face is the guy that makes the call for the legend, and then he gets us on the  phone, and then he hands the phone over to the legend.  It's like a secretary.  I was on Dice's show, by the way.  Dice's show.  Remember the show he did when he was a radio executive?  Oh, I mean, a record company executive?  Oh.  I'm ready to present you with the legend.  All right, I'm ready.  Present.  Okay, here he is.  Are you ready?  Okay, here we go.  Hello.  Hold on. 
[02:25:30]  He was so close to hanging up.  Yes, Andrew.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Do you understand I'm here with the Salvation Army?  Yeah.  Who's been here since day one at Ground Zero taking care of things?  Right.  And you're bothering me with this nonsense?  Yeah, Dice, we realize that.  We've been here since September 11th.  Do you understand there's nowhere in New York you could go without getting a ticket now?  What's that?  I'm with the police sergeant, and he told me so.  Oh, sure. 
[02:26:00]  What day is this?  October 1st?  I got the complete police department looking for you.  It's September 30th or something.  All of a sudden, Dice is down there.  Dice.  Yeah.  You could have visited a lot sooner than this.  The entire police department is looking for you guys.  Right.  Right as we speak.  What is he talking about?  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  You're losing us.  Whatever you park.  What are you doing, Dice?  You get ticketed.  Whatever you walk, you get ticketed.  What are you doing down there? 
[02:26:30]  Do you understand how it works?  I'm going to put on special police operations lieutenant wind flow.  See how it goes.  He just keeps going.  You hear what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Dice.  You hear me?  Everyone knows we're pretty tight with the NYPD.  Yeah, I don't think Andrew Dice Clay is going to change our relationship with the NYPD.  I think it's already been changed, my friend.  I got it under control.  I got a hat.  Dice.  Give me a hat.  Do you understand?  Dice.  Yeah, go ahead.  What are you doing down there? 
[02:27:00]  I want to put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you let the guys work?  I want him to talk to you.  No, don't put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you just let the guys do their job?  What are you doing down there?  Because he says you're getting a ticket now.  What are you doing down at Ground Zero?  What am I doing down there?  Why don't you let the guys do their job?  I'm a lieutenant.  That's who I'm with.  I got the hat now.  I got the hat.  You're saying you don't have the hat.  Let the guys do their job.  They've seen enough disaster down there.  I'm with the Salvation Army.  Right.  I'm with the lieutenant, and I got the hat. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  I think you're the last celebrity to get an NYPD hat, by the way.  Holy S.  I have to see another celebrity with an NYPD hat.  Do you have the FDNY hat, too, Dice?  I have to say that.  I'm all set now.  Do you have the FDNY hat?  I have to see another Asian guy that's obviously not on the job with an NYPD hat.  I'm going to kill myself.  Did they give you a patch with the towers and never forget?  I got to talk to somebody right now.  I'm going to put Happy on for a second.  No, don't put Happy on for me. 
[02:28:00]  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  What happened?  He's having a nervous breakdown, I think.  Happy face.  Yeah, this is Happy face.  Where is the legend?  The legend is taking care of meeting and greeting people.  Meeting and greeting people.  Do you understand that he's a legend and everybody wants to shake his hand?  Absolutely.  There must be at least nine people there.  Absolutely.  There are literally hundreds of people here right now taking pictures of his chiseled chin,  admiring his dimples, and just wanting to touch his body because he is a legend. 
[02:28:30]  Do you understand that?  Do I need to go with Madison Square Garden?  Look at Christopher's face.  He has sold out Madison Square Garden.  Titus is looking like Jesus Christ.  Did he sell it?  Right.  He has played every major area in the country.  Did he sell Madison Square Garden?  He's the Olive Garden.  He has pay-per-view special.  It's the garden.  Did he sell it Madison Square Garden?  This is why he's a legend.  Christopher, stay human, okay?  See, this is your future if you start to...  Happy face.  Start believing your own face.  Oh, happy face hung up. 
[02:29:00]  He got a little upset.  All right, Rick, call back happy face.  We need Dice to talk because now Barry Williams is on the other line.  Barry Williams?  Yeah.  Yes.  Danny Bona, dude.  No, no.  It's Greg Brady.  I know.  He's the guy who did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got to talk to that.  Wasn't that great?  That was great.  Hey, Greg Brady.  Barry.  Hey.  No, the legend is meeting people now.  He's meeting and greeting.  He's meeting and greeting in the middle of Ground Zero.  We're very close to getting both of you on the phone at the same time.  I have a spectacular offer for him. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, so you could ask Dice if he wants to be part of the next celebrity boxing thing.  You've got to get in the ring.  Barry wants Dice to fight a chick.  Well, not just a chick.  Who, who, who, who?  China.  China.  Oh, oh.  From the WWF.  All right, hold on.  We might have Dice back on the line here.  She goes for the junk, though.  Oh, yeah.  She does that punch.  Dice.  Dice.  No, this is happy face.  It's not Dice.  Happy.  Put on Dice, please.  I can't.  He's a legend.  He's taking care of things.  You understand how people want to meet him?  No.  No, see, obviously, you guys, you think this is the problem. 
[02:30:00]  I got, you know, I just can't.  I can't.  I got to go.  Happy face.  Happy face.  He's hanging up now.  He's hanging up now.  Oh.  Dice is hanging up.  All I can say, I mean, I can't be sure, but he's got to know I'm on the line.  He's got to know that this offer's coming.  And maybe he's ducking it.  Yeah, one more time, Rick.  That's it.  That's what he's using.  Tell happy face that Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady, wants to make Dice an offer.  We're trying to help Dice out.  Come on.  Yeah, like they helped Vanilla Ice out.  The last celebrity boxer. 
[02:30:30]  Like they helped.  The last celebrity down at Crown Zero.  Who knew that Vanilla Ice couldn't fight?  What are you talking about, Willis?  Did you see him bouncing around like a juver?  He thought he was in the prison shower again.  What was that?  He was fighting for his manhood.  Barry, did you watch it?  I mean, I tuned in late.  I didn't get to see you and Danny, but Danny.  Barry was too busy at the hospital trying to wake up.  But that ain't fair, though, because Bonaduce was just training like every day.  I did like the other half like two weeks before.  But Barry's a friend of ours.  Yeah, he's a martial artist, too.  We can have some fun with him.  He's a martial artist.  I mean, I wouldn't go in the ring with Bonaduce. 
[02:31:00]  No way.  All that anger from his career.  And then on top of knowing martial arts.  And Dennis, you know what else he did?  He stopped taking his mood-elevating drugs about three weeks before.  Oh, he did.  He was like totally zoned.  He pulled a Tyson.  Because we were talking to a buddy of mine as a martial arts instructor and trained me in.  Man, I've got to tell you, man.  I don't know if I'd have stepped in the ring with him.  Yeah.  You had a lot of guts, man.  A lot of guts.  Who knew Greg Brady?  Johnny Bravo could do it.  Johnny Bravo.  Do you hate being called Greg Brady, man?  Does it just bug you?  No, I prefer Keith Partridge.  We have Christopher Tyson in the studio, Barry. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I know.  I have a fan.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  Me too, man.  I mean, you know, I grew up on you.  Barry has fully accepted the fact that he will...  I've embodied it.  Yeah.  And he's actually done a great job having fun with it.  He put out an album with Johnny Bravo.  Yep.  A Johnny Bravo album, which we played...  It's part of what I'm touring with right now.  Yeah.  It's a monkey.  Excellent.  Now, Barry, do you put the jacket on, the little vest?  I do when I do Johnny's back and the shades.  Johnny's back.  Ready to rock your town tonight. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I can't get the picture of Dice out of my mind.  With the big NYPD hat on.  The last guy.  Actually, he's the second to last because I believe Caratop is going to make his way down  to ground zero to complete the entire celebrity gamut.  All right.  At least Emo Phillips went early.  Dice.  Who do you want?  What happened?  We want Andrew Dice Clay, please.  You want the American legend?  We need him to speak with Barry Williams, who is on the phone with us right now.  Happy Pace, we'd like to speak to the funniest comic of all time, the American legend, Andrew 
[02:32:30]  Dice Clay.  All right.  You see, other people know he's a legend.  I'm telling you.  All right.  We're not denying it, man.  Let's all calm down.  We're trying to do a radio show here, and we've got to move on.  The legend of Pips.  Let's get...  Okay.  Well, hang on.  The legend just may be ready now.  Hang on.  All right.  Okay.  Here he is.  Oh, thank God.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Opie, Opie.  Dice.  Opie, do you understand?  I'm on with Tom Kennedy.  We're talking about hats.  We're saying I'm over here.  This is how friendly we are. 
[02:33:00]  He's over somewhere, and I'm over here.  Oh, my God.  And we talk like that to each other.  Can just please...  And he's going...  I don't see...  Can I pray?  Please, can one more piece of debris just fall?  Something that was precariously perched on the top of one of the buildings that...  Please, one more piece of debris.  One brick.  That's all we need.  Barry Williams...  I don't see ONA walking around with the hat.  Hey, Dice.  Dice.  I went down to ground zero three weeks after the event by myself in the middle of the night. 
[02:33:30]  No one knew I was there.  He says to me, we give you the hat.  Oh.  Not ONA.  He's going with the hat.  All right, Dice.  We have...  Tom Kennedy gave me the hat with the lieutenant.  I understand.  Dice, we have the real Greg Brady on the line.  Right.  Barry Williams from...  You remember Barry?  Yeah, he's not Barry.  He's very nice.  With a proposition for you and your fine career.  No, but the thing is, with Barry, he don't got the hat either.  Right.  So...  I'm not with the hat!  You know, the hat bitch is a little old.  I'm from him down there with Tom Kennedy and the lieutenant. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  We understand.  Dice.  Dice.  Here's Barry Williams, Dice.  Let me talk to you for just a second.  First of all, I've been down a free time.  I'm talking about something.  Listen, it's a very patriotic thing that you're doing down there.  Now, when you think about what went on, it gets you mad, doesn't it?  Who am I talking to?  Barry Williams, you dick!  Television set.  I'm not in show business right now.  Right now, I am down. 
[02:34:30]  Stop listening.  I'm zero with the lieutenant.  In the hat.  I know, in the hat.  Mr. Kennedy.  In the hat, please.  The whole Kennedy clan is in.  Karlochewski.  Well, whatever.  Look, I know a lot of people that work down at the site at Ground Zero.  I know a lot of them listen to the show.  Could you please, one of the crane operators, could you just lower something heavy on dice?  Please, right now.  He's standing right there.  Lower one of those big toolbox things.  One of those big wrecking balls.  Just drop it on dice. 
[02:35:00]  Please drop it on dice.  Or pick him up and dump him in the river.  Could you just dump him?  Move the boom on over.  Dump him in the Hudson.  Could you please just dump him in the river?  Just lift him up in the air a few hundred feet.  Please.  Make it look like an accident.  Barry.  Barry.  Barry.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Barry Williams.  Please speak with Andrew Dice Clay.  Guys, I just want to say that I think it's great what you're doing down there.  But it has to get you mad when you think about what happened. 
[02:35:30]  It doesn't really.  And they'll call you with an offer.  Gets us mad that the Port Authority Police Department doesn't get enough.  Oh, who is this now?  How much work we've been doing down here.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Where is Dice?  Get Dice.  Dice is standing by with us, shoulder to shoulder with the Port Authority Police Department, sir.  Why do you have to be on the phone to try to get more credit?  We all know the Port Authority, you know, lost.  Oh, I hate this crap.  Get Dice on the phone!  All right, all right.  Calm down, man. 
[02:36:00]  Dude, let it go for a second.  If he just cuts off and puts somebody on who's reputable, okay, then I'll put Dice on.  Get Dice on the phone.  Put Dice on the phone.  I'll explain in a minute.  I'm so sick of people that are pissed off because they're not getting enough credit.  Well, that's it.  With this whole Ground Zero thing and the turf attacks.  I know.  That's not credit, sir.  It's simply a matter of getting the information out.  I'm going to put Dice on and then I'm sending 20 cops down to lock your ass up.  Put Dice on.  I don't understand why you have to call to try to get credit for a job that you're doing. 
[02:36:30]  Obviously, I should be the one that's the mayor at this point.  Oh, God.  I can make a visit down here.  I'm coming down with this.  Make him the mayor and then please, can we have the first mayor of New York assassinated?  Please.  I'm coming down with 20 cops.  I guess you're making a year for my family.  Dice.  And you're going to get frisked and sentenced.  Dice.  What do you think?  I'm a moron.  Barry, Barry.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of trying to get him in the spirit of it, I think you're going to have to go directly  to the offer.  Dice. 
[02:37:00]  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  I am there with the Kennedys.  Oh, my God.  Dice, they have a Barry Williams has an offer for television for you.  Money.  I am there with Luke Kennedy and Winslow.  Do you want to help your fame?  Luke Kennedy and Winslow.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  He's my superior.  He is who I am.  Dice.  Oh, my God.  Dice.  Christopher Titus here.  Dice.  Who's there?  Christopher Titus.  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  You don't know, cop. 
[02:37:30]  I am a police general officer.  I get it, man.  Look, Barry Williams has an offer.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  He is definitely having a nervous breakdown.  We are listening to Dice in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  Let's all just sit back and listen.  Perhaps seeing Ground Zero was the last draw.  I have work to do in the city.  I drive around in Lincoln old school.  Dice, you're having a nervous breakdown.  Seek help.  You don't even know what you're talking about. 
[02:38:00]  I will arrest you and put you in jail, and I will have Lieutenant Winslow send you with  the Judge Kennedy.  You want to see what I can have done now?  Dice, you're a madman.  I highly recommend you see Dice at the Beacon Theater tonight, because I truly believe it  will be the last time he'll be on a stage.  We're not entertaining the boys anymore. 
[02:38:30]  Dice, Dice, I think hawking for the workers down there is pretty much done with.  You know, they're getting everything they need.  Maybe if you were there in October, maybe if you were in New York during the event and  in the months following it, you would understand what was going on, instead of being the self-centered  guy that you are.  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, why didn't you just wait until the buildings were built 
[02:39:00]  back up?  Why didn't you wait until they just built the buildings again?  And then show up?  I am so glad.  Lieutenant Bloomberg and Captain Lieutenant Winslow.  Hey, Dice, why don't you go to Pearl Harbor?  I hear something horrible happened there a while ago.  Help those people.  You live in your own little world.  Jesus, Dice, go to Cape Canaveral.  I hear one of the shuttles exploded. 
[02:39:30]  Go down there.  Pay your respects.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Holy Christ, what is he talking about?  On the air, as long as you abide by the rules of mine, people who work on the main, the police  people and the chief...  Dice, Dice, go to the harbor.  The Titanic was supposed to come in, but it sank.  Pay your respects.  Hey, these people need warm clothes.  The survivors of the Titanic, they need warm clothes. 
[02:40:00]  Help them out here.  I'm here with the people from White Star Lines.  The White Star Lines people had a hard time.  Their ship sank, and these people, the survivors are cold.  They need blankets.  Send them down there.  I'm going to Jersey.  I'm going to Lakehurst, New Jersey.  I hear a blimp exploding.  The people are hurt.  They need help and support.  The Hindenburg.  Oh, the humanity.  I can't look. 
[02:40:30]  Holy Jesus.  My God.  It's unbelievable.  That was...  Barry?  Yeah.  We were close that time.  We should mention...  We were close.  We were pretty close.  This might not be the most opportune moment.  I'm not sure.  He has lost his mind.  He's having...  O'Leary's cow burnt down Chicago.  Please, people need homes.  Please, people need homes.  By the way, I...  I find Mary's killing everyone.  By the way, I don't want anyone to confuse what I was saying, but it really pisses off  Ant and I when people feel like they have to call the media, you know, radio stations, 
[02:41:00]  TV, to try to get more credit.  We understand the tragedy.  Believe me.  What to...  Believe me.  And this isn't the first or second time this has happened, you know?  Yeah.  If you work for the Port Authority, it wasn't a stab at you, but I can't believe the guy's,  you know, calling and trying to get more credit for the Port Authority.  The Midwest is in a dust bowl.  They're in a dust bowl.  They need our help.  It's a big drought.  Hey, Dice, I hear there's a hurricane coming off of Florida.  There's Hurricane Andrew. 
[02:41:30]  Please hurry.  Help.  Gah!  I don't think anybody doubts your respect for the Port Authority.  Crack a tower.  It's erupting.  The people of Pompeii.  They're all stuck in Iraq over here.  Oh, my God.  They need your help.  At least you made it funny.  I got the hat.  I got the Mount St. Helens hat.  Run for your lives, people.  Run for your lives.  Mount St. Helens erupted. 
[02:42:00]  Run for your...  Look, I got the Washington State Police hat.  I'm here with Officer Kennedy.  Mount St. Helens, run, people.  Look at the ash.  I'm the biggest ash here.  I'm an ash hole.  Well, you know, he's a fellow comic, people.  I'm just going to sit here quietly.  Of course.  No, as a fellow comic, everyone could go find dice.  But he's on it.  I've never heard of that out of his mind.  He is completely...  He lost his mind somewhere.  Yeah.  Christopher.  Has he been doing it for a while? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Ever since we've been doing this program.  Wow.  He's lost his mind somewhere.  Remember, he'd come up on stage, you know, hickory-dickory-dog, you know, he'd do his  things, and his cigarette smoke.  That's right.  I'm on the line with this chick at the bank, and she's got her tongue.  Oh!  Yeah.  Now, he does what you just heard.  He babbles incoherent.  That's his show?  You don't even know what he's talking about.  Yes!  Oh, you guys aren't actually helping the ticket sales at the Beacon Theater.  No, no, absolutely.  The place will be packed tonight, because it could be his last show ever. 
[02:43:00]  Because you will see a man having a nervous breakdown tonight.  Oh, my God.  You will see a man having a nervous breakdown at the Beacon Theater.  I know MTV wants to take advantage of that whole Ozzy Osbourne show.  Kennedy's been shot!  Kennedy's been shot!  MTV should follow Dice around with cameras.  There's your next hit, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See the real Dice when he's not on the stage.  It's kind of sad.  Greg Brady.  I think the first episode should be down to Ground Zero with him, then.  Oh, man. 
[02:43:30]  That seems to be a touchstone for him.  Barry.  That's the next album.  Ground Zero with Dice.  I think that's the next album.  All I could do is apologize, Barry.  I actually thought, silly me, please hit me with a goddamn ball-peen hammer in the head.  I thought he would shut up for enough time where you could actually get a word in edgewise.  At least to spill out the offer.  Yeah.  And we all, we definitely don't want to ever forget what happened.  Right.  But I felt like it was, like, October 1st.  A little self-serving.  For the last half hour.  Yeah.  I've been sitting over here thinking maybe Christopher would like to put on the gloves. 
[02:44:00]  Man, you know what?  I still have a show.  He's not a has-been, Barry.  I still have a show on television.  Yeah, right?  Maybe after.  Whoa, whoa, man.  Ten years.  No, no, no.  Ten years from now.  Let's talk.  Because, you know.  My career is on fire again now.  Barry.  It is, man.  You handled it well, dude.  He was, he's like a fighter.  Yeah, Barry.  You did a good job, man.  That's not a lot.  More people call me Barry now than ever in my life.  That's true, right?  That's you, Ant.  That's not a lot of blow.  I wish I had half the career you had, my friend.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  And half the gash.  That's right.  My God, he got some Marsha Brady.  All right, Tom.  Yeah.  Barry, do we hang up on you?  And if we get diced back, do we try to call you?  Barry, like he doesn't have something to do.  I'll be a little bit of aided breath.  All right.  I, hey.  All right, go get a hat.  The offer's still there.  And Christopher, we should talk.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right, man.  Thank you, Barry.  See you, guys.  All right.  It's like the hat got one laugh, and then he just couldn't go.  And then he, that's what he does.  Oh, my God, the hat got a laugh, and it's like to stay up.  He wants to annoy you.  You should see him. 
[02:45:00]  You should see him.  If you go to the beacon tonight, he will go up to some guy and go, look what color pants  you're wearing.  Beige.  And then he'll go off for 20 minutes on the guy's beige pants.  Because beige is.  You want to run up onto the stage and punch him in the face.  Wow.  Punch me.  By the way, this is a guy who's like on your team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's sad.  I'm glad I'm not.  I'll be calling you like three years crazy from L.A.  Insane.  Just ranting.  Insane.  Dice having a nervous breakdown. 
[02:45:30]  And this just in.  Dice is jumping on a plane.  He's going to go to Oklahoma City.  I hear they got a problem with a building.  Blew up.  There was people.  Oh, save the children.  Save the children.  I'm asking everyone, send diapers for the children.  And then he's heading over to Columbine.  Columbine.  Oh, my God.  There's a problem there.  We got to save the kids.  I got a hat.  Hat makes everything okay, I think.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby.  I'm looking for the Lindbergh baby. 
[02:46:00]  Charles Lindbergh needs help finding a baby.  There's a ladder out his window.  Someone stole his baby.  He's an American hero.  I got a Lindbergh hat.  I got a Lindbergh.  Oh, man.  Well, uh.  The red coats are coming.  The red coats are coming.  Oh.  Two if by land, one if by sea.  Three if by head.  Goddamn dice, man.  Nothing funny than him losing his frigging mind. 
[02:46:30]  Engines are coming.  Custer, look out.  Watch your scalp, Custer.  You daffy bastard.  You put your hat on.  Put your hat on.  So they can't scalp you.  Hey, it's Dice here.  No, it's not.  Don't worry.  It's no Trojan horse or nothing.  Yeah.  Dice here, open the door.  Open the door.  I got a hat.  It's the Trojan hat. 
[02:47:00]  Well, I hear Rock Hudson is sick, huh?  What is it?  A flu?  He's got the flu bug.  Oh, wow.  I love watching him have a nervous breakdown.  It's perfect.  Hey, Kennedy, talk.  Kennedy, look out.  I think, wow.  Hey, Adam.  That was really fun.  It was a lot of fun.  Well, you got it when you're hearing somebody actually having a nervous breakdown. 
[02:47:30]  To wrap it up, go right to the beginning.  Hey, Adam, don't eat that apple.  Adam, what are you doing?  Eve's going to bite it and we'll have eternal damnation or something.  There's a snake.  He's a snake.  Don't listen to the snake.  Snake.  Cut the snake.  I'll make the skin into a hat.  Eve, what a hooah.  Yes.  She's a hooah.  She's going to ruin it for everybody.  Hey, Noah, build the ark.  It's raining.  It's going to be drowning here, people.  Put on a rain hat.  All right, man. 
[02:48:00]  That was probably one of the best improv radio bits I've seen.  Thank you.  I've done a lot of radio, man, and that was really funny.  And it's sad that I wasn't involved in it.  Moving on.  Whatever.  Well, what happened?  Is he on medication?  Did he leave?  He should be.  What happened?  The guy should be.  Guys, I'm not kidding.  I'm like, he's a fellow comic.  He's a fellow comic, so I'm like, what happened?  I'm so glad you know this.  I need some Paxil.  Maybe some Thorazine.  I think he's convinced it's funny or something.  We don't know. 
[02:48:30]  We don't know what he does.  We don't understand what he's going for.  And, Christopher, we've talked about this.  Repeating the same joke over and over is not funny.  It's Vaudeville.  Right.  Vaudeville.  We've talked about this.  I don't mean to rip dice, but, I mean, it's like.  Right.  We've talked about this, though.  Me and Obi sit there and go, why does he call up and just go on and on and not stop no matter  what you say?  You go, okay, guys, we got it, but let's talk about this.  In the head, he keeps going.  You want to reach into the phone and pull his head out and punch him. 
[02:49:00]  And someone has a Big Bang joke.  And they made the universe.  It's in constant motion.  It ain't ending.  You know, because you could say, if it's never ended, what's at the end of it?  Let's say there's a hat.  What's beyond the hat?  Not the hat.  Another hat.  Oh. 
[02:49:30]  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, man.  He's like freaking the Nostradamus of comedians.  He's doing comedy in Quatrain.  Isn't he amazing?  But it's the same Quatrain over and over.  We're hanging with Christopher Titus.  Man.  Very funny, guys.  This has been the oddest.  I've never.  It's just been an odd show.  You guys should probably have.  There's a girl that's been, like, molested by his 97-year-old guy.  We have Dice flips out on the phone.  Dice having a nervous break.  You know.  But, yeah, trust me.  The show's funny.  Maybe you didn't hear it today. 
[02:50:00]  Andrew Dice Clay calling back.  Oh, God.  Not again.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up, Dice?  I'm very busy.  Baby Jessica's caught in the well.  And I got to help her get out.  People, we need to spread the word.  Those workers needed sodas and water and hats.  Baby Jessica.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's that?  Dice.  Dice.  Yes.  Baby Jessica is now 32 years old.  Well, then she better get out of there because it's probably getting very tight for her. 
[02:50:30]  You're a little late on that one.  Oh, wait a minute.  Some people are telling me.  Just like going down to ground zero.  Oh, my God.  Tragedy.  Yeah.  I got to head over to the Dakota.  Dakota because I hear one of the Beatles got shot.  Oh.  It's a tragic day for everybody.  I got to get over there.  Oh, but now I'm going from over here to over here now.  I'm over here in Bethlehem.  You'll be the only one outside the Dakota.  That happened a long time ago.  Yeah, huh?  I mean, there'll be tourists out there because they're there every effing day taking pictures  of the place, but. 
[02:51:00]  I got to go to Bethlehem.  You're going to Bethlehem?  Oh, my God.  Look at this poor guy up on the cross.  And they're nailing him up there.  Someone help the man.  Give him some water or something.  And then look at, oh, no.  They're putting thorns on his head.  Just give him a hat.  You don't put thorns on their head.  You give him a police hat.  An NYPD hat.  An NYPD.  Yeah.  No.  And ladies and gentlemen, that was another episode of Quantum Dice. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, it's Quantum Dice.  Hey, Quantum Dice.  I'm Dr. Dice Beckett.  I go back in history.  I leap.  They call it leaping.  And I got to fix mistakes in history.  So everything's okay now.  See, that's what I do.  I got a happy face, a hologram that helps me out.  And sometimes I communicate with Club Soda Zinky.  You know, a happy face hits the little light thing and says, I got to help out here. 
[02:52:00]  Some days I wake up, I look in the mirror after I leap, I'm a Negro.  And I'm like a ball player.  But sometimes I'm a chick with meat curtains.  And I go, oh, I got meat curtains.  And so once, I remember once I left, and I'm a goddamn retard.  I was a retard, but I was still diced.  But I look in the mirror, and I got a retard face.  I go, I go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Club Soda Zinky. 
[02:52:30]  I got a retard face.  But then, you know, the next day, I might be a midget.  And I hate the goddamn midgets.  Oh!  So I leap this one time, and I'm in the body of a chick, right?  And then the hell, happy face, the hologram, starts banging me.  Bop!  Bop!  His yam bag slapping against my ass. 
[02:53:00]  Oh!  Quantum Dice.  Next week, Dice is in the Nixon administration while Nixon's recording.  Hey, I hate the Jews, too, there, Tricky Dick.  I understand.  They're what you call shifty.  I understand.  We got to bomb the gooks in the Nam.  And for sweeps, for sweeps, Dice in Saigon.  Heck, I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  How does this happen?  I got to take a boat up the Nam River? 
[02:53:30]  I got to kill some guy.  Look, they napalmed the road.  This poor girl's running down it naked.  Someone help the poor girl.  I hear she's in Texas with a 97-year-old.  Ow!  Give her a hat!  All right.  Thank you, Dice.  Oh, man.  I'm watching Quantum Dice.  Very nice.  That would be a great show.  Quantum Dice.  Quantum Dice.  Anthony on fire today.  Oh, come on.  Man.  Hey, Mike, what's going on, bro? 
[02:54:00]  Not to break from what I put on the screen, but I heard Dice was helping with the recovery  effort of the dinosaurs.  A huge tragedy.  A comedy.  All right, Mike.  So how long has this been going on, man?  Yeah, about four years.  We've been watching him slowly but surely and lose it.  I'm a comic, so I don't want to rip on a guy, but it seems like he's lost his mind.  He seems.  Well, no, but if comedy goes, most comics get on stage and they say, I remember this, and  then I was on my way to the show.  I mean, what just happened was real.  And, like, I don't know about anybody else, but I had this grin on my face like I just got  stoned for the first time.  I could not stop.  Because Anthony was doing exactly what we all wanted to be doing, just shut up. 
[02:54:30]  I know.  He was fired up.  You should see, he was bright red.  His head was bright red.  I know.  I was spitting into the mic.  He's screaming into the mic, and I thought, man, and then all of a sudden, boom, the brilliant  comedy comes out of here.  You got to get him fired up until, like, he has a vein sticking out in his head, and then  all of a sudden, be fun.  There you go.  That's the key to get him fired up.  Man.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thank you.  There you go.  Plenty of fun.  Quantum.  That's fun.  That's fun.  Come on.  We're having fun today now. 
[02:55:00]  It was really fun.  Well, now we can do an Alamo joke.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  We know that dice history, right?  Every time he calls now, you just do quantum dice.  Now we got to do quantum dice.  You just got quantum.  You got a bit forever.  We can always go back to the Alamo.  There's plenty of history we can work on.  Dude, you went through a textbook already.  You were like, we did the history of the world.  I know.  You did, like, the last 200 years with dice.  Hand me a pen.  I'll sign the Magna Carta.  Doesn't anyone have a pen?  They got to sign this thing.  Come on. 
[02:55:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Can't always watch Pardon the Interruption.  I want to make it exciting.  Now you can hear Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon on ESPN Radio.  Make the goalie make a save by the 24-second clock.  You want to change it now and make it like women's basketball.  Tony.  He's going to jail in what should be the prime of his career.  And Wilbon.  David Stern, at the very least, allowed this All-Star game to be in Las Vegas.  Pardon the Interruption.  Weekdays at 6.30 Eastern on ESPN Radio.

[02:57:30]  Now, the Success Journal.  Here's Chris Whitting.  Two brothers named John and Horace were natural hands with mechanical stuff.  So, they opened a machine shop.  Their first customer was a man named Olds, who asked the brothers to build parts for a new car known as the Oldsmobile.  John and Horace were soon earning cash, but they noticed Mr. Olds was doing even better.  Deciding they'd sell cars, the brothers began building affordable, high-performance cars that went the distance. 
[02:58:00]  Before long, sales were full speed ahead.  I'll bet you know John and Horace by their last name, Dodge.  Thanks to the Dodge brothers' brains and business sense, the Dodge name is still a legendary one in the automotive world.  It's still giving the competition a run for the money, and it's still a top seller.  With the Success Journal, I'm Chris Whitting. 
[02:58:30]  This is Jim Blasting Game, the small business advocate with the Small Business Minute.  Whether you're a small business owner or want to be, the question that's always out front is, what's the next step?  There are at least three things that motivate us to take the next step.  Our natural inclination as humans to want to improve our lives.  Our pride, competitiveness, and ambition.  Market forces often associated with fear and greed.  And the question is not if you want to take the next step, because some combination of the three things I just mentioned will motivate you to do that. 
[02:59:00]  The question is, how well will you take the next step?  Michelangelo, the great Renaissance figure, once said,  The greatest danger for most of us is not that we aim too high and miss it, but that we aim too low and reach it.  Write this on a rock.  Small business decisions must be made with good research, a generous portion of faith, and high aim.  This is Jim Blasting Game, the small business advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.

Hey guys, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're doing worse stuff today because, you know, yesterday was my brother Brett's wedding.  It was a terrific, a terrific ceremony.  It was beautiful with the flowers. 
[03:00:00]  It was an outdoor wedding.  It didn't rain yesterday.  People were worried about the rain, but it didn't rain.  And then the reception, my God, it was just wonderful.  It was very, very cool.  A lot of dancing.  It's Friday.  What?  It's Friday between the FM show and the XM show.  We're doing this right now.  But I'm taking advantage of the magic of radio.  Ah, the magic of radio.  And I'm here hungover and felt like I couldn't do a radio show today.  So that's why we're in worst of mode because that terrific wedding on, I mean, yesterday. 
[03:00:30]  Yes.  And don't forget the bachelor party.  Everyone that came out to FH Wilders.  My God, Friday was just amazing with the bachelor party as well.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah.  We had a great time.  So we'll be back live tomorrow.  But we got some bits that revolve around the whole 9-11 thing.  And Dice, the Dice-a-thong.  Yeah.  Oh, Dice called up with this idea of doing a radiothon to raise money for 9-11 victims. 
[03:01:00]  But he, it was another one of these self-serving things I think that Dice was up to.  So we didn't take it seriously.  And I think he was starting to get annoyed with us.  And we didn't take it seriously because it was way after the fact, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He was very late to the party as far as this 9-11 thing goes.  All right, here's Dice-a-thong, part one.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hello?  It's the Dice Man.  Dice.  Talk up.  I can't hear you.  You can't hear us, really? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, it's hard to hear you.  No one else is having a problem today.  Cleveland is.  Yeah.  Wow.  I heard about that.  All right, can you hear us now?  Yeah, I can hear you pretty good.  All right, what's up?  You're hearing me now?  Yeah, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right, you know, things going on.  No, I know, and I actually wish I was calling under better circumstances.  Yeah.  You know, and, you know, the first thing I have to say is, I mean, we all know what an awful 
[03:02:00]  tragedy this is and how horrible it is.  And I personally want to say how my heart goes out to all the families and the firemen and  the policemen that have lost people.  You know, it's just a terrible thing.  Inconceivable, this whole thing.  It is inconceivable.  But what you have to remember is that, you know, this country has been built on such a 
[03:02:30]  strong foundation, you know, and when you have a strong foundation like we have, you  could really carry a lot on your shoulders.  And even though this is an awful thing, I mean, everybody is going to do their job.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, just like the firemen have been doing and the police and obviously New York has the  greatest mayor in the history of New York.  Julianne, he's done a great job. 
[03:03:00]  He's shown leadership.  Yeah, certainly shown.  Amazing.  I mean, these people are heroes.  They're courageous.  I mean, just all the volunteers.  Everybody wants to be part of this.  And Dice, don't forget about the dogs.  The who?  The dogs down there.  Yeah, and all the dogs.  Well, no, I'm serious.  You know.  What do you mean the dogs?  There's dogs down there.  They've got the dogs down there trying to search for people.  You know, the rescue dogs.  They have that thing under their neck, you know. 
[03:03:30]  All right, well, the dogs don't understand English, so they don't see what I'm trying  to say.  What?  Dice.  What?  Are you wearing the big leather jacket with the American flag studs on the back?  Yeah, I got my American flag jacket.  You got that one?  Yeah.  I always liked that one.  Yeah.  You know, I just want to get this across to you.  Okay.  You know, because, you know, I'm listening to it.  We're not making any jokes.  Seriously, there's a lot of dogs down there, and a lot of people are pissed off that the  dogs aren't getting, you know, the attention. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, so you're not kidding me?  No.  Well, feed the dogs.  Well, they didn't have dog food, so then they put word out on the radio, and they started  collecting dog food for the dogs, and then they needed a little, little, what, Anthony?  The Scorch Fund.  They needed, like, dog booties, and we got them that, too, because they were crawling around  in the rubble, cutting their little paws.  Well, that's good.  Yeah.  You know, but, you know.  Dice thinks we're kidding.  We're not kidding.  I know.  You're goofing on me. 
[03:04:30]  You know, I'm trying to call in and be serious about something.  I'm getting ready to hit somebody in the face with a pipe.  Dice, calm down.  You know what I mean?  Dice, calm down.  First of all, we're not kidding with you.  That's just one of the things that's going on.  But you know what?  Even if you are kidding, I think that's important, because I think at this point, you know, everybody,  you know, besides, you know, all the volunteers and firemen and police have to do their job,  and if you guys are kidding, that's okay, because that's what your job is, and I think your 
[03:05:00]  job is also to lift and help, you know, lift the spirits of the city and the country.  Right.  You know, and one of the reasons I'm calling in is because I would like to do a thing with  you guys, which is, you know, I hope we could do this, which would be a radio telethon,  a 24-hour radio telethon.  24 hours?  24 hours where we get all kinds of entertainment, not just comedians, rock stars, performers that 
[03:05:30]  will talk, maybe politicians, and raise all this money to give to these families and the  police and everybody that needs it immediately.  This is a We Are New York emergency telethon.  And, you know, I would like everybody involved in this, and of course I want to do this with  you guys, and, you know, even thinking about it, you know, and I hope I'm not going over 
[03:06:00]  the line here.  You know, I know in the past I have had problems with Howard Stern, you guys have had problems  with him, but I have no more problems with him because all the nonsense that we do all  year long, all the petty nonsense goes right out the window now.  Everybody is friends.  This is the time that I feel that everybody has to get together and unite because that's 
[03:06:30]  what we are.  You know, this is the United States.  This is, you know, the greatest country in the world, and even though this thing happened  in New York and in Washington, we are all connected, and that's what makes us the United  States.  And this thing that happened, in my opinion, in the greatest city and the greatest country  in the world, you know, has to be taken care of.  You know, and I don't like when I hear people saying, you know, we were a great country. 
[03:07:00]  Let me tell you something, we were, we are, and always will be the greatest country ever.  You know, and, you know, I just want to say this, and then we can talk about whatever  you want because, you know, I mean, you know what happened is awful, and it's something  that, you know, we never thought would happen to us, but it did, and it hurts, and, you know,  and people can't make sense of it, and that was the intentions of these animals that did 
[03:07:30]  this, to knock us down and keep us down.  Right.  But let me tell you something, that could never happen because New Yorkers, whether you're  from the boroughs or New York City or upstate New York, have the spirit and more heart than  all of these third world garbage countries put together anywhere, this whole country  of ours will now bond together, and I think we'll rise to the occasion. 
[03:08:00]  Nice.  It took you a week for the speech?  You couldn't call us up on Wednesday?  No, I'm just trying to talk from my heart.  You know, I'm going to smack you in the mouth in a second.  Let me tell you something.  We were in here on Tuesday and Wednesday last week, and a lot of the same sentiments coming  from a lot of people, and now you're calling, you know, it's over a week later, and now you  got the raw recipe.  Well, I wanted to call, and I knew you would be on the air, and a lot of people would be  listening.  All right.  And I knew that the day or two after, there wouldn't be that many people listening.  Right. 
[03:08:30]  You know, I mean, but you know what?  I, you know, I am from that city.  You know that.  Yeah.  I'm from Brooklyn, and stop playing the music.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You got to stop playing the music, really.  I'm going to get mad.  I think it's a nice background.  You know, well, I'm having a hard time thinking when you do this.  Nice.  It's the national anthem.  Yeah, we're feeling it right now.  Come on.  No, I'm just trying to say something to you.  This is the one time I'm calling in, you know, serious, and you're jerking me around 
[03:09:00]  here.  No, well, you know, I liked what you were saying, so we figured a nice background music for  it.  All right.  Well, shut it off.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony with the buttons.  I don't have a button.  I'm not playing this.  What do you want?  What do you, what do I got to give you?  Jokes?  No.  I'm not going to go into that now.  I liked what you were saying.  Continue talking about the filthy animals over here in Afghanistan.  All right.  Why can't they teach driver's ed and sex ed in that third world country? 
[03:09:30]  It's too hard on the camel.  I mean, what kind of jokes?  You know what I mean?  What do you want?  What's better than 10 fingers on a piano?  Two lips around my organ.  We're not doing jokes today.  You know what I mean?  I like that.  No, I'm just trying to talk about this thing.  And I'm hanging up.  No.  I'm hanging up.  I want to talk about this telephone.  Don't hang up.  All right.  Now, you're going to be like.  You know, you think it's a big joke.  Yeah.  No.  But you got all these kids out there. 
[03:10:00]  I'm not talking.  I'm hanging up.  No, Dice.  Don't hang up.  I'm hanging up.  You're getting me mad.  It's almost over.  You can't cut it off in the middle.  It's the national anthem.  So it's almost done.  Listen to this note.  This is from the Chicago Yankee game last night where Mrs. Butterworth got up and sang that  great version of the Starship League.  Our national anthem.  There we go.  All right, Dice.  You know something?  You guys are morons no matter what. 
[03:10:30]  Well, I'll stop it.  You're just morons.  Stop it.  We thought it was appropriate.  You know I always call in as a dummy and I do stupid stuff.  I'm trying to say something.  No, we don't say that to your face.  Never.  Let me ask you something.  Neither of you guys got kids yet?  Dice, you were being very patriotic and we just thought you were going to be a fit.  Do any of you guys have kids yet?  To date?  Oh!  You know what?  You know what?  It's good that you're doing this.  You're making me lose, too, because you know what?  I got to be honest. 
[03:11:00]  I was a little uptight about calling in because I wanted to say something really good until  you wrecked it.  No, no.  We didn't wreck anything.  I'm just making a point.  I think you made a great point.  Hold on.  Let's regroup, okay?  No, we're okay here.  Wait.  We didn't wreck anything.  This radiothon sounds like a great idea.  What, Anthony, and I have been going for the last few days is a few chuckles.  So that was a little chuckle.  No, no.  And that's right.  Just to leave a little steam, a little tension.  That's why I gave you the joke.  All right.  Well, we were hoping it would make someone chuckle. 
[03:11:30]  You know, you started in with the dogs.  The dogs!  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's true.  Hold on.  Where do you find a dog with no legs?  Hold on.  Right where you left them.  I mean, you want dog jokes?  Wait.  I'm putting you on with Melissa for a second because you have to believe this.  Melissa?  Hi.  Hi.  Andrew Dice Clay's on the line, live from L.A.  I volunteered Friday night at the armory for about four hours, and one of the things that 
[03:12:00]  we're requesting that people send in is dog food and the booties so that the dogs have  stuff.  They're not BSing you.  They're telling you the truth.  All right.  Well, you know what?  If there's no dog food around, give them regular food.  Yeah.  You can't give the dogs regular food.  They're getting sick.  Yes, you can.  I got a dog.  He eats prime rib every day.  Yeah, well, that's some dogs.  You can't give all dogs.  And another thing...  All dogs can eat regular food.  You just don't want them to eat regular food because it's more expensive.  No.  I just don't like giving my dog regular food.  And trying to help out. 
[03:12:30]  You know what?  You throw a mistake.  Right.  Who's looking?  All right.  Dice enough with the chuckles.  Yeah, who's Melissa?  I mean, what am I even talking?  Was she good to go?  No, she's a listener.  It's funny.  You really don't believe us on the dog thing.  We have a radio friend up in...  Where is Scorch?  Utica, Syracuse?  We never know where he broadcasts from.  I just called him because I think we should put this telethon together.  It's a radiothon.  Right.  Yeah, a radiothon.  All right.  Telethon is television.  I just think we need to encourage each other at this point. 
[03:13:00]  Right.  And help each other.  And even more important than what we're doing now,  the future of these children that have lost loved ones are going to have to live with this.  And by us doing this kind of telethon, these things will be remembered.  And I think, you know, it's just our way of, even more than giving the money, you know, 
[03:13:30]  it's our way of showing that we care about them and we love them.  You know what I mean?  Because this was just the most awful thing that has ever happened, and this is our country, and this is a country where anybody has been free to pursue any dream and reach any goal.  And where kids go to school and when they graduate school, they're free to pursue whatever dream they want to go after. 
[03:14:00]  But most important, what I feel, is that the beauty of this country is that we have always had freedom without fear.  Even the midgets.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you?  Yes.  And don't be stupid.  Why?  Because while the president and the military do their job, it's our job now to bring entertainment to people and make them laugh. 
[03:14:30]  How does this radiothon, how is it going to work, Dice?  I don't know.  You're the big brains.  Who's going to be like the Jerry Lewis guy?  Well, I'll be on the West Coast.  You'll be on the East Coast.  You could be like Jerry.  I think we could set it up.  Don't make me get stupid.  Because when I get stupid, I lose it.  You look more like Jerry than we do.  You could be like the Jerry.  Actually, lady.  See?  There you go.  Lady.  Did you see Jerry this year?  You'll never walk alone. 
[03:15:00]  Oh!  You know, coming out, singing that song.  Na, na.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na.  So you'll be Jerry Lewis.  I think Jerry Lewis ate all the dog food.  That's why they couldn't find any.  Can we have a token?  What happened to him?  You fat son of a bitch.  What happened to Jerry?  I actually thought it was a fat guy impersonating Jerry.  Yeah, that's what he looks like now.  You know, and I'm not looking to make fun of Jerry.  I love Jerry.  All right, so you're...  But what went wrong?  You're Jerry Lewis.  What is he, eating those kids? 
[03:15:30]  We get it.  We heard those.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Somebody's stealing my jokes.  I can't believe this.  Yeah, fourth grade.  There's something new.  Yeah, so go ahead.  What were you saying?  All right.  So you're Jerry Lewis.  Ant and I, who are we?  Who's like Ed McMahon?  Who's Ed McMahon?  I'm Paul Anka.  You're going to be Paul Anka?  Doesn't he do it?  All right.  You could be like Wayne Newton or something.  All right.  So how is this thing going to work?  We do 24...  We set up a studio on the West Coast.  We do 24 straight hours.  You're with us the whole time? 
[03:16:00]  We do 24 straight hours.  Or are you going to pull a Jerry Lewis on us and do five minutes here, five minutes there?  I need it now.  No, no.  We do the 24 hours.  I'm dying over here.  We're bringing all kinds of...  Anthony.  Yeah.  Believe me.  If I was there, I would have to break your wrist.  What do I want?  I would just have to do karate on you.  We're having fun, right, Dice?  We're having fun, but, you know, we're trying to set this thing up.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  What's your big idea, Anthony?  I don't have one.  I have no idea.  Talk. 
[03:16:30]  Talk, Dice.  Dumb as milk, this guy.  All right.  What do you feel we should do?  And I thought I'm a moron.  I know.  All right.  What do you think?  What do I think about what?  I think we should steal a van and sit on a billboard.  No.  That's an idea.  All right.  Go ahead, Dice.  Dice wants to be serious.  What should we do?  Yeah.  No, I'm telling you what we have to do.  All right.  Well, you got a studio out on the West Coast.  We got one.  You got to get me one.  You're with a big radio station.  How are we going to get people?  And we'll get the talent.  My agents.  How do we get the talent? 
[03:17:00]  Well, my agents are really going to help with that.  You know, they got a lot of big talent.  You know.  Who would you like on the show?  I don't know.  Who do you got?  We'll try to get Metallica.  Tower Top would be nice.  You know, they got Billy Joel.  They got everybody.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Stop with the music.  It's very confusing to a mind like mine.  Gallagher.  Can we get Gallagher to smash?  We'll get a lot of comics.  We'll get some water that looks like Bin Laden. 
[03:17:30]  I know.  Jim's not here.  What happened?  I spoke to him late last night.  He said he's coming down there.  He's around here somewhere.  Well, where is he?  I don't know.  He's not in the studio.  What is he, analyzing women's urine?  Where is he?  I don't know where he is.  I'm serious.  You know.  You got to stop with the music, really.  Jimi Hendrix.  I know who it is.  Oh.  We can play this as we go to the tote board.  Okay.  Well, you know what?  Let's go to the tote board. 
[03:18:00]  When do you think we could do something like that?  I want to thank the McDonald's Corporation for their generous check.  You stupid ass.  We're going to get all the celebrities.  You know, you turn the golden arches upside down.  It looks like a big yellow ass.  It's my joke.  It's another one of my jokes.  Can we get Yakov?  Yakov Smirnoff?  We're going to get everybody.  What the country?  I think once we announce this, a lot of people want to be involved in it. 
[03:18:30]  Can we get Paula Poundstone to fondle a child?  Well, if we can't, you got Norton sitting there.  Shut the music.  This is a great version.  How much heroin did Jimmy have in his system during this?  How much heroin was pumping through Jimmy?  All right.  Obviously, you don't want to do this.  Well, we want to do something to help.  I think Radio Tong is a good idea.  You think it could work out? 
[03:19:00]  Well, they're doing a TV telethon Friday, right?  Yeah, all the networks.  I don't know what they're doing on TV.  Who's doing a TV telethon?  All the networks getting together to simulcast a huge benefit.  How are they going to do that when it's all different channels?  They're a bunch of idiots.  They're going to get Tom Hanks.  Well, of course, you know.  He's been in war for the last 30 years already.  Britney Spears, I believe.  Yeah, did we get Britney Spears on our Radiothon?  Yeah, maybe.  Ooh.  She's nice, right? 
[03:19:30]  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  But we got to move on this thing.  All right.  So where do we go from here?  I don't know.  It's your radio station.  This is what I keep saying to you.  We got to set a date.  We got to start getting the town.  Roll a dot.  Roll a dot.  So, Dice, what are you saying?  You'd be willing to go on a station that we supply out on the West Coast and for 24 hours, 
[03:20:00]  if I could use the term, you're going to put yourself out there and be with us and raise  some money?  That's right.  Shut the music, Anthony.  I swear, when I see you, I'm just going to choke you to death.  See, I'm going to get choked by Dice for something I'm not doing.  Would I turn music up this loud if I was playing it and I'm trying to talk?  It's blasting.  Here it is.  It's almost the end.  Jimmy still had the needle hanging out of his arm playing this. 
[03:20:30]  I think he used it as a slide on the fretboard.  Amazing.  I like Dice's idea.  I like it, too.  Dice, you mind if we do it, though, without you?  Hello?  That didn't hang up.  Dice!  I'm not talking to you now.  Oh, see?  Now you're playing games.  I'm mad at you now.  Now you're playing games.  I'm mad.  How can you be mad at a time like this? 
[03:21:00]  I'm mad.  I haven't called in.  I called with something good.  Yeah, it's a very good idea.  You know what I mean?  We like it.  We're just suspicious.  You're going to be up for 24 hours.  What do you mean suspicious?  Don't be suspicious.  You know what?  The people listening, if they think it's a goof, it's not going to turn out the way we want.  No, it's not that.  You're going to be up for 24 straight hours.  Yes!  It's nothing new to me.  I haven't slept in 18 years.  Look at me.  Is this like the Dice that we saw as the postal worker on that Fox TV series a few years back? 
[03:21:30]  What are you talking about?  I mean, this is a sensitive, serious dice.  You know something with what happened, you know?  Hickory dickory dog.  Bin Laden can suck my...  Oh!  You know?  You're going to do some different rhymes.  The one thing those people did do smart.  Yep.  You see that women had her covered like with handkerchiefs, giant handkerchiefs.  Right.  And they're never schooled and they're just used as bang puppets.  That's the only thing they ever did smart in that country.  Bang puppets?  Bill on line one. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, bang puppets.  I can't say the F word.  It's one of your rules.  All right.  Bill on line one loves Dice's radio thong idea.  Do you think...  Radio thong?  Like a thong?  What are you talking about?  The bang puppets?  No.  You said radio thong.  You ever see those women?  You ever see their heads?  Yeah.  I mean, no.  They're always wrapped up.  Yeah.  Let's see them headless.  Anything with hair on it.  Anything with hair on it.  Hey, people are already pledging money, so you're on to something. 
[03:22:30]  No, I'm telling you something.  This could, you know, it'll be the first radio thong ever.  Thong?  Not thong.  Thong.  Radio thong.  You know what?  Call it a radio thong.  Have some filthy slobs come in.  Have them move some pisshole putty out.  You know, let them do what they got to do.  You know what I mean?  Radio thong.  Radio thong.  Da-dong.  Dong.  Dong.  That'd be like Relief Girls.  You know what I mean? 
[03:23:00]  People are loving the idea.  They're all in.  I mean, you know.  We just feel like we're going to do all the work, though.  And you just.  No, you're not going to do all the work.  I'm going to be there.  All right.  Everybody is down.  We've got to raise the spirit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Radio thong.  You know, and you're not going to get me off this.  What?  You know.  I mean, I'm just as down as you guys are.  Yeah, I see how down you are.  Which way?  Radio thong.  Which way?  Bosco or you bet?  You bet. 
[03:23:30]  You're right.  That's right.  Which way?  Paper or plastic?  Paper.  No.  It's plastic.  Which way?  Paper or plastic?  It's always plastic.  No, it's not.  Oh.  Which way?  Paper or plastic?  Plastic.  No.  Who cares?  What do you mean, who cares?  Paper.  No, I thought that was the answer.  Who cares?  No, no, that's not who cares.  Oh.  Who cares is a whole different bit.  Oh, I see.  Who cares?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Uh, medium.  No.  Medium rare. 
[03:24:00]  Right.  Of course it's medium rare.  All right.  Did we go through this?  Now if you want to play, we can play.  Security.  All right.  So we like the radio thong idea.  Are people calling in?  They like the idea?  People like the idea.  I have to pitch to you for goofing on it.  No one's goofing on it.  Because you guys are morons.  No one's goofing on the idea.  We're goofing on you.  You know, how many markets are you in?  Can we raise about 30 million overnight?  You think so?  In 24 hours?  Yeah.  If you bring your Hollywood friends for it.  You think Howard would do this with us? 
[03:24:30]  Uh, no.  Are you willing to let bygones be bygones?  Uh, no.  Yes.  No.  Yeah, that's what it's all about.  What, being phony?  No.  We have to all of a sudden.  Be whatever you gotta be to raise the money we want to raise for this.  We gotta make it like we're friends?  We are friends.  There is no more fighting.  No more fighting?  We love fighting with you.  No more fighting.  We love fighting with you.  No, not with me.  There was an old Muslim lived in a shoe.  Had so many children, her uterus fell out. 
[03:25:00]  Oh!  Hey!  It's starting to happen.  It's starting to happen.  Are you gonna sing any songs?  Yeah, I'm gonna sing.  I'm over here now.  And then the new Na Na song, which I gave you a preview of.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh, alright.  Can you sing that song?  The Na Na song?  Yeah.  I forgot.  Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
[03:25:30]  That she sound retarded.  Wait, he might have been getting to something there.  What do you mean retarded?  Go with it a little bit.  You're allowed to make fun of retarded people.  If you went over to a retarded person and said,  Hey, are you retarded?  Do you think he'd know?  You see what I'm saying?  Let's do the na-na thing.  Na-na-na-na-na.  Oh, no.  He's going to call back now all pissed off,  and I want him to know Opie hung up.  I did not hang up on Andrew Dice Clay. 
[03:26:00]  I would never do such a thing, Anthony.  I like his radio thong idea.  Da-dong, da-dong, da-dong, da-dong.  Dumps like a truck, truck, truck.  Let me see a what, what, what, oh.  Turn on your hot light.  Let it shine.  Wait a minute.  We could do a little radio thong idea. 
[03:26:30]  He's priceless, man.  I love the Dice man.  Waiting for him to call back.  Rick, go call.  Usually he calls right back.  Oh, here he is.  I got you now.  Here he goes.  What happened?  Dice, what's wrong with your phone?  I don't know.  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  What happened over there?  You on a cell phone?  With who?  Oh, you on a cell phone?  With who?  With us.  No, I'm talking to me now.  I know, but you're in the middle of the na-na thing. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, maybe we'll get Bob Hope.  Bob Hope?  Yeah.  You've seen him lately?  He looks like Mr. Freeze from the Batman booth.  He's been dead and back a thousand times, this guy.  He could do a few minutes for us.  Entertain the troops?  You know what I mean?  Well, people are digging the ideas.  Yeah, but they're going to think it's a goof because of the way you're treating it.  The only way it'll work, though, is if we get celebrities.  Have you listened to our show?  We're going to get points.  You want me to call my agent right now while we're on the phone?  Uh, no.  Yeah, because he'll tell you the lineup. 
[03:27:30]  All right.  Give us the lineup.  Mary, Mary, Quacken, Jerry.  Muslim women are so damn hairy.  Oh!  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm trying to set this up.  Guys, it's an homage.  Be a human being.  I'm giving you an homage.  Be a human being a minute.  I can't even do my stupid jokes on your stupid show because everything gets dumped.  You've been doing some great jokes on our show.  But that's our job.  We need to make them laugh.  Let's leave the midgets.  We need to raise money.  We need to make them laugh. 
[03:28:00]  Let's leave the midgets alone.  Yeah, I'll do, like, a clean, dirty joke.  All right.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Well, can you say pussy on the air?  Only if it's a cat.  All right.  So we're talking about a cat.  So just say, just say.  Why is pussy hair curly?  I'm going to go straight and poke my eye, huh?  I don't know about that.  And that's about a cat.  Yeah, right.  No, they didn't buy that down the hall.  I understand.  What do you mean they didn't buy it down the hall? 
[03:28:30]  Who's down the hall?  Who's taking bites out of their pet?  I mean, it's all about the content.  I got one.  All right.  Why don't chickens wear underwear?  Why?  Because their cock's on their face.  Is that good?  Is that a good one?  No, that's not a good one.  Can you play that one?  No, you can't do that one either.  All right. 
[03:29:00]  How do you keep a bagel from getting away?  How?  You put logs on it.  Pop.  All right, that's clean.  Yeah.  You can't get away, but it's clean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did one ocean say to the other ocean?  Nothing.  They just waved.  What do you have when you have two green balls in your hand?  What?  Kermit's undivided attention.  You see what I mean? 
[03:29:30]  We've got to go back to the filth.  You went too far.  You see what I mean?  It's going to be all clean jokes like that.  Hold on.  Joe wants in about the radiothon.  Joe?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You two had a great idea about this radio telethon.  Thanks, man.  But Dice won't take this seriously.  I know.  What's wrong with you, Dice?  What's wrong about me?  You're making jokes about this like it's some little thing.  It's my idea.  I heard O&A come up with it first.  What about you?  Who came up with it first?  Dice, we've been talking about this on the radio for the last three hours. 
[03:30:00]  Because I told you about it.  What?  And I told you don't talk about it until I come on.  I don't remember that.  You don't remember that?  We had a two and a half conversation last night over that thing there.  Ask our listeners.  Since 3 o'clock, we've been talking about a great idea we came up with called the radiothon.  They know it's my idea.  They know you're not smart enough to come up with that.  All right.  You want to ask them?  No.  I don't want to.  No.  Don't start this.  All right.  I'll ask them.  Who am I asking?  Joe.  Yo.  How long have we been talking about the radiothon today? 
[03:30:30]  I would guess since 3 o'clock.  Yeah.  That's my proxion to guess.  They had to say it was my idea, right, Joe?  No.  They said it was a one-eight idea.  Where are you from, Joe?  It was lunchtime conversation.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Well, you're not involved in the radiothon, all right?  Hang up the phone.  Why not?  Because I said so.  Wait.  We're going to need all the help.  We're going to need Jersey's help.  I'm sorry.  Why do you hate Jersey?  Hang up the phone up, you skank.  I just don't like you for saying they didn't say me.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  All right, Joe. 
[03:31:00]  Anthony, don't know how that race got on my mind.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I'm not going to argue with me.  I'm not going to argue with me today.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  No, you don't.  You see, I'm not going to do that.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Stop it.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm over here now.  Excuse me.  I'm over here now.  What is this?  Hey.  Hey, I'm over here now because you said I'm over here now.  Oh, excuse me. 
[03:31:30]  I didn't know you were everybody.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  Look what I did to you again.  Yeah, well, maybe I do it to you this time, big shot.  Nice.  Be nice.  Nice.  Don't tell me to be nice.  Why?  I came in here with my lady.  You open your mouth and I do this to you and everybody goes,  and then you hear this.  I like the tape dice. 
[03:32:00]  I like the dice on tape.  You like the dice on tape?  Yeah.  I don't even understand the way I talk.  Now they don't know if it's me or the tape.  You got so much stuff on me, you could just piece together conversations.  Yeah.  Look what I did to you again.  Wait, let me do it with it.  Tell me when.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Here I am.  Ready?  Hang the phone up, Drew.  No, not that one. 
[03:32:30]  Which one?  The other thing.  The other thing for you said what?  About who?  He and now.  You missed it, see?  No.  Can we get back to this?  He and now.  You know, everybody's going to think this is a goof.  It's not going to be set up.  You know what?  And now that we talked about it, somebody else is going to do it,  and you're going to look like idiots.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Stop it now.  All right.  Vito.  Let's meet people.  Jerry Dice Lewis.  These guys have been talking about this last Tuesday 
[03:33:00]  while you were buried in a hole back in Hollywood.  What are you talking about?  This is my whole idea.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Does it really matter who came up with the idea?  Yeah.  What, do you want credit for it after all this?  No.  I just want to get it done.  Obviously, you're the one that wants credit,  because you keep going,  we're talking about the history of the rock.  Ah, nah, nah.  Are you going to be wearing a tuxedo?  No.  Why not? 
[03:33:30]  This is a rock and roll telethon.  Oh, rock and roll telethon.  Yeah.  What about the dong?  This is the brawl for it all.  Oh, yeah?  That's right.  All right.  We're going to get some heavy hitters on this.  Who are we getting?  I told you.  You want me to call my guy?  Now, give me some names off the top of your head.  Yeah, we don't know anyone.  Yes, you do.  You've got a lot of people.  No.  We'll get an impressionist that does a thousand people.  Don't worry about who we're going to get. 
[03:34:00]  We're going to do this.  Now, when can we do it?  Haven't you been listening to our show for the last three years?  We've never had anyone famous on this show.  It's Dice Stock.  Don't take the brown acid.  Oh.  Hey, I like Dice Stock.  No, but we can't give me all the credit.  I'm just the brains behind.  Oh, we don't want to give you any.  No, I know.  I know how you are.  All right.  Believe me, I know you.  All right.  I know you better than you know you.  All right.  Believe me, you don't even know who you are.  All right.  What are you wearing? 
[03:34:30]  Are you in a beige shirt today, my friend?  No beige today, man.  What are you wearing?  Green.  Green.  You make no statement.  Don't have to.  Yes, you do.  No, beige makes no statement.  The joke don't work unless someone's wearing beige.  No, no.  It's green.  It's beige.  It's gray.  It don't matter what it is.  I'm wearing a...  It's every color other than black.  Black is the only color.  I'm wearing a Gap green T-shirt.  Gap.  Just the fact you're borderline Gap says what your life is about.  You can't wear Everlast sweatshirts all the time, Dice.  Yes, you can, my friend. 
[03:35:00]  All right.  We got to take a break.  Break from what?  From this.  Well, what are we going to do?  We're going to do this?  We need people.  We're going to get people.  We're going to look stupid.  We have a telethon, a radio telethon, and we don't have anybody.  I woke up with my heart in the right place and this idea in the right place.  I got a gaffer from Fort Fairway.  And Anthony keeps doing me.  It's like I don't even want to do me anymore because this idiot just does me. 
[03:35:30]  You don't want to do yourself anymore?  No, I'm not doing me no more.  All right.  I'm going to be Chris Walken from now on.  All right, Dice, if you're so serious about the radio thong,  I have one of your big, big celebrity friends call us just so we have some confidence in your abilities to get these people aboard.  You want a big celebrity?  All right.  I could get the little redhead kid from different strokes.  I was on that show.  All right, so you don't want to do this? 
[03:36:00]  We need to know who's going to be involved.  Right.  How many times have I said we call the guy right now?  Are you going to call some of your MASH friends?  You want me to call the guy right now?  Dice is in MASH, you know.  You want me to call the guy right now?  He's an injured soldier.  Can we count on...  What's wrong with you?  Can we count on Alan Alda?  We're going to get everybody.  I think everybody will want to be part of this.  All right.  Because this isn't a network nonsense show.  You have our hotline.  Get one guy to call us.  This is an immediate thing. 
[03:36:30]  Get one big celebrity to call us.  I got him right here.  John Travolta.  I got John Travolta.  John, come here.  Just say hello.  Yeah, we're going to do the...  All right, get out of here, stupid.  What the hell?  John Travolta is going to be on with us.  Do you hear him over there?  No.  I'm on the phone.  I want to get out of here.  I'd give you a crack in the head.  Hey, is Stallone there?  Everybody's here.  Sly, Sly, fix your lip.  Come here.  Say something.  You know, I think we all got to get together. 
[03:37:00]  Shut up, stupid.  That's pretty good, man.  Do something from Rocky.  Whatever I do is perfect, but I only do like...  Do something from Rocky.  Something from Rocky.  Yeah.  What was that, like a movie?  Yeah.  As John Travolta.  No.  I can't beat him.  All right.  We didn't ask you to do it all day.  No, you said do it as Travolta.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  All right.  You said beat Travolta in Rocky.  Do walk-in.  I can't do him. 
[03:37:30]  You did a good walk-in.  All right.  Are there any girls in there?  Are there any girls in there?  Yes.  Then let me in.  Do you have pecan ice cream?  Yes.  You have to say yeah when I...  No, when I say something?  Yeah.  You say yeah.  No, wait, wait till I ask you for something.  Okay.  All right.  Do you have pecan ice cream?  Yeah.  Then let me have some. 
[03:38:00]  You see what I mean, how I do that?  And people are going to listen to this for 24 straight hours.  See, Jay Moore thinks he does the walk-in.  I do.  He does Dean Martin.  What?  He does a great Dean Martin.  How about Eric Roberts?  Love the Eric Roberts.  What's the matter?  You don't want to stick it in my ass?  Too dirty for you?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't think you can say that.  Hold on.  That was too good.  And they dumped out of that, my friend.  Why'd they dump out?  Because you're describing something in the Das Dimpier. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Do the Charlie, they took my thumb line.  Oh, you want something from that?  Well, you got to explain what you want.  Eric Roberts from the Pope from Grennan's Village.  There you go.  Eric Roberts.  Charlie, they took my fucking thumb line.  No.  Hold on, hold on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't say the effing part.  You can't say the effing part.  So then I got to make something up fresh.  What did you say effing?  Let me tell you. 
[03:39:00]  I got to think of something he would do like.  Just do the line.  Which one?  Tell me the line and I'll say it as his.  Charlie, they took my effing thumb.  Everyone knows.  Charlie, they took my fucking thumb, Charlie.  You know?  Hold on.  You can't say the effing part.  I know what you meant now.  You meant like.  Say effing.  Like, say, um, like, uh, Fungu or something.  Just don't say it at all.  Just say they took my thumb. 
[03:39:30]  No, no, I got something.  Leave it out.  You know something, Charlie?  Sometimes you got to whack them, you know?  You say you put your coat on and you don't say go night to nobody.  And that's just to humble them, Charlie.  Good Eric Roberts.  No, but see, the bit I'm working on, they're all part of a vagina now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Like, all the impressions are part of, uh.  You're doing the vagina monologues?  The vagina monologues. 
[03:40:00]  You know?  Like Eric Roberts is, uh, well, he was the, he was the other thing I talked about.  Right.  Don't say it.  You know what I mean?  Don't say it.  I'm not saying it.  You're the one that pushed me into it.  Welcome.  I didn't want to get involved in that conversation.  To the Andrew Dice Clay Telethon with stars Lonnie Anderson, Mr. T, Andrea McArdle.  Let me ask you this.  Tommy Mac.  That's funny.  Andrea McArdle.  Let's not forget Charo.  And Charo, the coochie coochie girl.  Can we count on Charo for the Radiothon? 
[03:40:30]  Can't you guys get any?  But you got to help out, too.  We don't have any celebrities on this show.  With Jamie Farr and J.P. Morgan.  You got a lot of celebrities that'll do this thing.  You got that one guy.  You know, that one guy.  Can we count on Radar from your backstage?  Radar O'Reilly.  Could you get him?  What's he doing these days?  I don't know.  You know what?  The way you guys are acting on the air, you won't be doing nothing tomorrow.  What are you talking about?  The people are going to get very mad at you.  This is not a joke.  Oh, stop it. 
[03:41:00]  Just have one of these big celebrities call us.  So we know we'll set up the whole thing.  I'm not having no big.  I just had a few guys on with you.  Who?  You know who you were talking to.  So people are going to donate money for 24 hours straight radio of you doing impressions.  We should donate money anyway.  No matter who's on.  We'll be on.  We're going to have a lot of laughs.  You're going to sing some Elvis.  Radar O'Reilly.  Are you going to dress up like Elvis?  Yes.  You'll do whatever it takes, right? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  It'll be like a pre-Christmas thing.  That's a true American.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Yeah.  I went to a pre-Christmas party.  I gave this chick a mouthful of cocknug.  No, you can't.  Can you use that?  No.  You know what?  For that day, they're going to have to give us a waiver on language also.  Yeah, dice.  You can't say you have to stop.  See, it's not a place for the dirty language.  It's not a place for the dirty language.  This is something we should really do and do it the right way without goofing around.  All right. 
[03:42:00]  And now I'm bringing on a big star, the cameraman from Casual Sex.  Anthony, I'll give you an address in Brooklyn.  Don't make me give you an address in Brooklyn.  I moved, dice.  I know where you moved.  That's why I have the address.  Ah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah.  Chris is saying this is his best idea since Brain Smasher.  I liked Brain Smasher. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Who cares if you don't?  All right, listen.  Like, I think about these things.  All right, dice, we really got to go.  I don't care if you got to go.  What are we doing?  We got to go.  All right, so what do we do now?  Got to work out the details.  Call your guy.  See who you can get.  You want me to call him right now?  Yeah, call him.  Yeah, after you hang up with us.  No, no, I could get him in one second.  Ah, nah, nah.  There you go.  Now we say goodbye to you.  Here goes dice.  Holy crap.  All right, we have to tell you.  We actually have a great relationship with dice. 
[03:43:00]  We like the dice, man.  Nah, nah, nah.  How much fun dueling dice?  I love it.  Fun.  Dueling dice.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  We'll be back tomorrow.  I don't know why we have to intro this.  Basically, this is Dice-a-thon.  My God, quick.  I just listened to all of part one.  I want to hear part two.  Just play the tape.  Dice-a-thon part two.  That's all you need to know.  Thank you.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, no. 
[03:43:30]  Hey, Dice.  Yeah.  Hi, Dice.  All right, this is what I got for you.  All right.  All right.  I've been working on this thing.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  You're sitting down now?  We're sitting down.  All right, number one, I got Fabio.  You thought it couldn't happen.  I can't throw.  With the goose or without?  Wait a minute.  Wait, you got to reenact the bird thing.  Wait, I got more.  With the goose in the face or not?  I got more.  You got Fabio for the radio thong.  We got Fabio with that bird. 
[03:44:00]  When Fabio rode that roller coaster and he got hit in the face by the bird.  Yeah, so we're going to reenact that.  It could be the funniest moment ever in television.  Listen to me now.  We're going to reenact that for the people watching.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay?  Okay.  A lot of visual things.  We got to work it out somehow.  A visual for the radio.  Can you get Ramchop?  No, you were talking about dogs.  Dogs.  Guys.  Let me tell you who I got now.  Yeah.  Benji agreed.  We got Benji.  Oh, Benji the dog.  Benji the dog. 
[03:44:30]  I got that.  Because remember the other day you were talking with dogs?  The dogs.  One of the lassies.  I don't know which one.  The one with cerebral palsy?  Yeah.  I'm trying for the top lassies.  Hip dysplasia.  Okay.  And then we got that air bud dog.  He says to me like this, I'll do some of that.  There we go.  Thanks.  We can go on with the show now.  We'll be playing some tribute songs today.  Why do I feel that number is going to ring again really quick?  Now I get you. 
[03:45:00]  Now the city's been having a lot of trouble with their phones with this whole thing.  Yeah, I know.  I feel bad.  Air bud.  Oh, here he comes again.  What happened, Dice?  Dice, what are you doing?  Don't play games.  You're wrecking our show.  Don't play games with your hangups.  You're wrecking our show.  What do you mean wrecking the show?  You know, there was no big deal when we were only on in New York.  Now we're all over the country, and you still have that bad phone.  You're telling me I had to go get talent.  Yeah, and you got Fabio. 
[03:45:30]  I got more.  You didn't listen.  Did you see the lineup of this star-studded event that's going on tonight?  What star-studded event?  Can you get Jeff Speakman?  Who?  Who?  What star-studded event?  There is a benefit going on on every network, on the TV, on radio, on cable, where celebrities  are going to raise money.  See, I thought they stole it.  You see what happens?  Because you weren't serious.  I knew somebody would steal this thing.  They planned this, and it's going to be a big telethon. 
[03:46:00]  When did they plan it?  After we spoke about it?  No, beforehand.  I think you heard it, and you came up and thought it would be a good idea because you  heard it was...  No, I didn't hear nothing.  You know me.  I think you did, Dice.  I get all my information from my friend.  So how are we going to compete with the likes of George Clooney?  And Tom Hanks?  Tom Hanks?  And Mariah Carey singing Hero?  What do we got?  This is our first...  We got nothing.  We got Benji.  This is our first performance.  Mariah Carey is going to have an emotional breakdown on the telethon.  Since the loony bin, right? 
[03:46:30]  That's how committed she is to this.  Who's not going to want to see that?  And we got one in the last days.  You don't even know which one.  You know, I'm trying.  Get the one with mange.  You're the one that pushed the dog thing.  I didn't even care about the dogs.  And by the way, Air Bud only has three legs.  Air Bud's dead.  He had three legs.  He had three legs, but then he died.  Oh, the humanity.  All right.  Well, we'll do things.  You know, there's a lot we can do.  Who do you got?  Can you auction off the postal uniform you had on that Fox TV show? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, I got a lot of things.  When you were just Andrew Clay?  Yeah, we got...  I dropped the dice.  Come on, you know that was for cash.  Drop the dice, nicey-nice.  Nicey-nice.  You know something, Dice?  That's the best thing I've heard you say.  You know, that's the honest Dice right there.  I said it for the cash.  Shut up.  You know, why do you show up every day?  I hear you.  F for the cash.  That was my whole idea with the radio time. 
[03:47:30]  That we do something that isn't about the cash.  Yeah.  You understand?  Yeah?  Yeah, what?  Hey, are we going to get Wilson the volleyball from, uh...  I can't believe they took our idea.  When's this tele-tongue happen?  I think you can get a salesman from Foot Locker to come on.  Tonight.  Tonight?  It's huge.  It's multi-network telecast.  Dice, do we...  I don't understand.  Nobody told me about this.  I got a key grip coming in from Ford Fan Lane.  Do we or do we not have Wilson from Castaway? 
[03:48:00]  We don't want any of those.  Listen, who's Wilson?  Everyone knows Wilson from Castaway.  You didn't see Castaway?  Do we have Wilson from the radio time?  It's a movie.  Oh, the movie with Tom Hanks?  Yeah.  Where you been?  He's a volleyball that pulls us up on the ice.  You know how I am.  Where you been?  What do you mean where I've been?  Where you been?  Where you been?  Now I see where we're going with this.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Which one? 
[03:48:30]  Hey, wait.  Happy birthday.  To who?  One of you's.  No birthdays.  No one's birthday.  Happy face told me it's one of you's birthdays.  Happy face is wrong.  Nah.  Hey, are you doing another Ford Fan Lane movie?  I don't know.  Am I?  Are you?  Or what?  Let me see.  What's that, Hopi?  Ask him if there's a sequel to The Adventures of Ford Fan Lane that's coming out.  Buick LeSabre.  Who just said ask me?  Why couldn't you ask me?  I'm reading something.  This guy says Max from San Francisco.  Wants to know if there's a sequel coming out. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know.  If there is, I don't know about it.  Maybe they won't cast you.  Starring Pauly Shore.  Yeah.  Hey, the whistle, I'm fulfilling.  I think that would work.  You want jokes?  How can you, how do you know?  Wait, let me get it all together in my head.  Take some oxygen.  How do you recognize a head nurse?  Do you, she's the one with dirty knees.  Bop! 
[03:49:30]  Bop!  Why do elephants have four feet?  Because eight inches isn't enough.  Bop!  You're probably scaring your cat.  How do you keep a moron in suspense?  Say nothing!  Bop!  No, you're not, you're just supposed to say nothing.  Right.  Right?  You're supposed to say nothing.  The joke is, how do you keep a moron in suspense?  And the guy goes, how?  And then you say nothing.  And then you just don't say a word.  You don't say nothing, but we're, we're on, uh, telephone. 
[03:50:00]  So you could.  I gotta explain it.  But you can't explain it.  It takes the, it takes away from the joke.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There was no, there was no, oh!  So we'll do a lot of those.  I'll repeat those.  We should make you negotiate with bin Laden.  Please.  You know what I would do?  You know, I'll tell you this right now.  All right.  Like if I was the president?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Which is perfectly conceivable.  Yeah, well, I'm a leader, my friend.  You know what I mean?  I'd know what to do.  Okay.  All right.  What would you do?  Well, number one, I'd come on.  I'd say it like this. 
[03:50:30]  You know, I'd look at the camera, like he did.  Right.  And I'd go, you know what we're gonna do to them?  I don't even want to say what we're gonna do to them.  Very concise.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's how angry I'd be.  That's good.  It doesn't clutter the mind.  Exactly.  So you let them know you're gonna do it, but you're not saying what you're gonna do  because then everybody's going, oh, this is bad.  And then you end it with bop.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, let me try it again.  All right.  You know what we're gonna do to them? 
[03:51:00]  How many of us say we're gonna do to them?  Bop.  It's not bop.  It's bop.  There's a big difference.  Which way?  Bop or bop?  I like the bop.  Bop.  No, it was bop.  We like the bop.  Let me try it with a bop.  All right.  Hey, you know what we're gonna do to them?  Yeah.  How many of us say we're gonna do to them?  Bop.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Bop.  I like bop.  Yeah, bop might be the one.  Try bing.  Bing?  No, no.  Bing!  That's like when you're in bed with a chick, you only use that.  Just go, bing! 
[03:51:30]  Like after you give it a kiwi cream, you go like this.  Is that with the hair or without?  You go like this.  Yeah.  Bing!  Nah, it doesn't have to drive behind it.  Nah, you need, no, no.  You know what I mean?  More of an accent on the bing.  You gotta make the hair down there stand on end, you know what I'm saying?  No, I told you that joke.  Yeah.  What did I make the head down there curly?  Why?  Why?  So don't poke you in the eye and bop! 
[03:52:00]  So what are you doing there today?  We're, uh, we're hanging out.  Hey, I got one for you.  Okay.  How do you keep Dyson's?  Why do you gotta be me to do me?  I can't do me.  Because it's your bop!  How do you keep Dyson's suspense?  There you go.  All right.  Bop!  Oh, bop, bop!  And he's re-dialing right now, you know?  There he is.  Oh, come on.  All right, hold on.  Bing! 
[03:52:30]  Bop!  Bop!  When you answer it, answer it.  Like Dyson's with Tourette's.  So I'm online at the bank.  I can't be gah, gah.  And I got my tongue up this chick.  I can't be gah, gah, gah.  Bop!  I'd like it medium rare.  Bop!  Bop!  Dyson's, it's like you with Tourette's.  Get out of here.  A gig!  Get out of here, I'm on the phone.  Bop!  What's up with the bop?  Get out of here.  You talk to everyone like that? 
[03:53:00]  I'm calling about my account balance.  A bop!  I want to know if my car's down in the shop.  A bop!  Anything like that?  What's that?  Well...  I was just yelling at somebody.  Well, Dyson, what do you got, man?  We got to do the show.  Yeah, but I'm here.  We got some songs.  So what are you doing?  What is this?  Who is this?  Yeah, who's the imposter on the air now?  Oh, wow.  Hey, Dyson, what's up? 
[03:53:30]  Hey, how are you?  Hang up on me and then you put an imposter on.  What's going on, Opie?  No, I'm sorry.  Hey, I thought...  Hey, who's this now?  Yeah, who are you?  Bomp!  One ball, get off my frickin' phone time.  Yeah.  Hey, who's this guy now?  Yeah, I'm Dyson, you're not Bomp!  No, no, no, no, you're not.  I'm nobody now.  Yeah, you're nobody.  I'm somebody.  I'm Dyson, you're not.  I'm over here now.  Bomp!  I'm over here now.  Bomp!  Who said you're somebody?  No, you're not anybody. 
[03:54:00]  I'm nobody.  Excuse me.  I'm not just somebody.  You're not an imposter Bomp!  You know who you are now?  Who?  Who am I now?  Look at this.  Who are you now?  That's you.  Who are you?  Yeah.  Who am I?  This is you now.  This is you now.  This is what you are.  This is what you are.  Uh-huh.  Bomp!  No, Bomp!  I'm over here now.  I'm over here for you.  Hey, not a-hole.  I'm glad...  Hey, Dyson, you're here, man.  Yes, it's open. 
[03:54:30]  I'm glad the real Dyson finally called in.  I'm glad the real Dyson finally called in.  Enough of them.  All right, don't pick Dyson up again.  Dyson, Dyson, baby.  Dyson checking in from over here.  Dyson, Dyson, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dyson, Dyson, baby.  Dyson, baby.  Dyson, baby.  Dyson, baby.  Dyson, baby.  Dyson, baby.  I'm over here now.

[03:59:00]  Urban myths relating to traffic tickets abound, but drivers and defendants will find that few of them are true.  I'm Ellen Cannon with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute.  You've heard these stories.  Red cars get more tickets.  Or if you get a ticket in another state, your home state won't find out about it.  Or if you don't sign a ticket, it will be dismissed.  Some are true.  Some are just myths.  For example, red cars don't get ticketed more often than other colors.  And insurance companies don't charge higher premiums for them either.  If your state participates in the Interstate Drivers License Compact, reports on traffic violations and suspensions are forwarded to your home state. 
[03:59:30]  Only Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Tennessee, and Wisconsin do not participate.  Signing a ticket is not an admission of guilt.  It's just an acknowledgment that you received the ticket and a promise to appear in court.  Refusing to sign a ticket won't do anything but agitate the officer and invite more scrutiny.  And in some states, such as Texas, refusing to sign a ticket can mean a trip to jail.  For more tips on cars and loans, visit Bankrate.com.  I'm Ellen Cannon. 
[04:00:00]  The Total Humanity Show.  Did we do this?  Hi, it's Opie and Anthony.  I don't know.  Did we do this?  Just read it.  It says a few segments that are peppered with the rage and profanity of Black Earl, Earl Douglas.  Psycho Mark calls in and says the bars at Ground Zero are running out of beer.  So we loaded a van with kegs to deliver to the site?  To be delivered, yeah.  We delivered it to Ground Zero, I guess.  That was our contribution. 
[04:00:30]  They needed beer?  This was our contribution to one of the biggest tragedies of all time.  Beer.  Beer.  We're pathetic.  Black Earl couldn't get through the checkpoints on multiple attempts.  Finally, Psycho Mark meets up with Earl and gets the kegs to the site with no problem.  We call this Operation Infinite Beer.  I'm the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  You want to get into the Psycho Mark thing or what?  Yeah, let's talk about that whole situation. 
[04:01:00]  All right.  We need Earl in here in order to do that.  Earl's to your right, Ant.  It's an integral part of this.  Earl, grab a mic.  Earl, go over there.  Well, we got to explain.  Obviously, Ground Zero, a lot going on, and we were trying to do our part, and we found  out that one of the bars down there is giving away a lot of free beer to, you know, all  the rescuers.  Yeah, they're off time.  They like to throw a few back with the rest of the guys, you know.  It's tough down there, as everyone knows, and it's kind of nice to unwind after the shift 
[04:01:30]  and drink some beer.  So we know Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  We decided we were going to have him send a bunch of kegs down here.  Well, this all started with Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark called us and said, look, these guys could really use some beer.  We've run out, and these guys are working hard, and they're hanging out, and yeah, like  you said, drinking in between shifts and stuff.  So, you know, maybe we could get some kegs down there.  So we get Jim Cook on the line, and he said, sure, and we got the kegs.  Well, today was the day to get the kegs down to the bar, and in the studio is Earl, one 
[04:02:00]  of the guys that drove the Wow van down to ground zero with the kegs of beer, and what  happened?  Are they real happy to get their beer supply?  I'm so glad we could help out.  Yes, of course.  We were basically told to turn around.  Turn around.  We needed a work order.  We needed all these.  We needed paperwork.  Turn around, bright eyes.  Oh, stupid Neil.  You don't even do that song.  So you were told to turn around. 
[04:02:30]  Turn around, but we're delivering our free beer.  We would stop by federal, state, and local authorities.  Were they racially profiling you, Earl?  No, they weren't.  Was there anybody that would have gone down there with a van?  So the federal agents stopped you?  Everybody stopped us.  There's like three tiers of stoppage.  Oh, boy.  So you didn't even get close to delivering the beer?  Nowhere near it.  And what'd they tell you?  They said we needed a work order. 
[04:03:00]  They just basically said we needed a ton of paperwork.  But Psycho Mark said it was easy.  Yeah, here's where Psycho Mark comes into this story.  We assumed, silly us, that we'd be able to take the beer down there because we were told by Psycho Mark.  Well, apparently, if you listen to Psycho Mark, he's running the whole show down there.  Yeah.  He's taking care of the rescue effort, recovery, the investigation, everything.  He's actually telling Giuliani what to do here in New York City. 
[04:03:30]  Psycho Mark told Earl that he could go down there and just tell him, you know Psycho Mark, and you'll get in.  Is that the case, Mark?  Dude, a Girl Scout with a Girl Scout box cookies could stop Earl from going down the street, okay?  All right, Earl, you are a wimp.  First of all, I was not driving.  Dude, why don't you throw the kegs in the river and let them sit down and I'll wrap them out of the river.  How's that?  Mark, here's a better idea.  Why don't you pick up the kegs yourself and deliver them over there since you're running the show? 
[04:04:00]  You know what?  I will.  As soon as I'm off my shift tonight, I get off at midnight tonight, okay?  Oh, by the way, I heard another story.  I heard the bar doesn't mean any beer.  They only had one day.  Hold on, hold on.  You're both talking at the same time.  Earl, what?  I heard the bars were fine, that they well stopped with beer.  They just went that one day without delivery.  Mark, is there beer down there?  They got some, but they could always use more.  Of course, I'm thinking they could always use more.  You made the weakest attempt in the entire face of the universe. 
[04:04:30]  Again, we went through three tiers of cops, essentially.  Let's get John in here.  Trying to explore our kegs.  Is John listening to the show?  If he is, come running down the hall.  Earl, is it possible for you to put the kegs on your head and walk them down?  No, at one point they said you might have to carry them, but we got four kegs at an event.  Well, hand trucks.  Why didn't Psycho Mark hang up on us?  He might have just gotten cut off.  I'm sure he'll call back.  He had to take another hit.  When it comes to airtime, Psycho Mark will call back. 
[04:05:00]  Believe me.  So here's the problem.  We have the kegs of beer, and we were not able to deliver them today.  Right?  We just want to get some beer down there.  All right.  Mark.  Oh, that sounds so much better.  Thank God.  Mark, so how are we going to get the beer to you?  Dude, listen to me.  It's very simple.  We're all down here.  Any press person can get by.  All you have to do is you have to go up to talk to the head cop.  You say, look, here, I work for the press.  I did it out of it.  You've got to talk to them. 
[04:05:30]  You have to get out and explain to them why you need to get by.  If you can talk a good story, you can get down here.  Oh, gee, now you've got to be a con man.  It's not being about a con man.  It's just having a little common sense.  So you feel that Earl didn't do his job today?  I'll get the beer in here.  I'll meet you guys at midnight because that's when I get off my shift.  He's just going to be there.  Dude, they're going to be drinking until 4 in the morning, Anthony.  No, I didn't say that.  I'm just thinking midnight is kind of late.  What is this, Operation Deep Throat? 
[04:06:00]  I know.  Meet me.  I'll have the kegs.  You know?  Earl, did you make any attempt to try and go up?  Let me explain the entire situation.  We got stopped by him.  They turned you back, and you came crying like a girl.  All right, hold on, Mark, because now John's in the studio as well.  John's saying that they got stopped by FBI agents.  What did you tell them?  FBI agent.  And what did they say?  Wrong.  You need, like, a P.O. or, you know.  War on.  Did you try to tell them, look, we're from the O&A show.  We got some beer for the guys. 
[04:06:30]  Not drop something off.  It sounds like, you know, you're saying paperwork.  You know, we had kegs in the back.  They, like, they, you know, peeked their head in and looked.  And they were like, no.  You guys are morons.  You're not making a delivery.  You're bringing in steaming supplies.  So, Mark, where are they supposed to go with the beer?  Why don't you drop it yourself?  Drop it off at the bar.  Look, I gave you guys this idea, okay?  I'm down here.  I'm busy working.  It's a great idea.  I thought it was the bar's idea.  Operation Infinite Beer. 
[04:07:00]  He has to take the ball and run with it.  And that's Earl.  You know, or Ben or somebody.  Somebody with a press pass.  You can get in here.  You just have to talk to the right cop.  Well, we still have four kegs of beer that need to get down to the guy.  Earl, could we put a mohawk on your head and some gold jewelry and you hop in the van and just go,  Hey, fool.  I'm bringing the beer down to the boys.  I pity the poor fool.  Stop me from making my decision.  Can you do that?  Paint it like the A-Team van?  Hey, Hannibal. 
[04:07:30]  All right.  We got to get that beer down there.  Mark.  For the kids.  Mark, you tell us what to do.  We will send Earl out with John right now with his cell phone and we'll try to deliver the beer.  Live on the show.  When you get down there, tell him that I am Earl.  I am Black Earl from the O&A show, officer.  How are you?  You go right to the sergeant.  You go right to the sergeant.  You go right to the sergeant.  You have no idea who you are.  You are so effing stupid.  Just listen to me for one second.  You go right to the head sergeant.  A white shirt.  You dumb F.  Okay?  You go up to him. 
[04:08:00]  You park the van down the street.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Put the file down for a second.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Does the three letters FBI mean anything to you?  No.  It's all of them.  Does the Federal Bureau of Investigation mean anything to you?  Does automatic weapon carrying men mean anything to you?  F-B-9.  What?  Dude, you just, you just, you just, you're just talking.  F-B-I.  The big yellow jacket on the letters on the jacket.  Don't go near them.  Anything to you?  Don't stay away.  Don't go near them. 
[04:08:30]  They came up to the van, Mark.  Well, obviously, listen to me.  This is what you got to do.  You got to park the van a block back.  You walk in.  You talk to the head of security at a checkpoint.  You know they're carrying kegs.  Wait, you want them to carry the kegs in, Mark?  Listen to me.  No, no, no.  You don't carry them in.  You put the van a block back.  You walk up.  You talk to the head cop at that checkpoint.  You say, officer, I have a van here full of beer for the bar over here that we're donating.  We want to get these donated supplies in, okay?  The H-N-I-C? 
[04:09:00]  What is that?  You talk to, Earl?  You guys might have to try this live on the show.  You know something?  You really might have to go on another run now.  I'm not going anywhere.  The beer's got to get through.  Stay in school.  Don't take drugs.  How many FBI agents did you guys come across?  There was six cops in the checkpoint.  I think three of them?  There was at least three of them.  Mark, you want to meet them at the border?  It is like Border Patrol down there. 
[04:09:30]  I can't right now.  I'm on top of the live shot right next to Liberty.  One Liberty.  We're looking right down inside the mess.  I don't know if you'll see it on Fox, but I'm right behind that camera right now.  We've all seen the shot.  Well, no, this is a new shot we just set up today.  Oh, goody.  Can't wait to check this out.  Yeah, Jesus.  What a bonus, huh?  Well, that's what the coverage has come down to.  Oh, we got a new angle.  Check out this angle of the complete devastation.  Well, we need to see this stuff, unfortunately, you know?  We've seen it.  It's not going away.  Yeah, but, you know, we've seen it, but, you know, you can't forget it. 
[04:10:00]  We're not going to forget it.  But we need to watch.  All right, how do we get the beer down?  All right, the beer.  Here we go.  Let's get back to the beer.  All right, this is more important.  Operation Infinite Beer.  What do we do next?  Just to have Earl use his brain and use a little common sense and try and finagle your waist.  Use common sense.  Yeah, when confronted by an FBI.  You ran like a girl.  A girl with a lollipop would have turned you away.  All right, Mark, tell them exactly where to go, and we'll send them out. 
[04:10:30]  Come right back.  Earl, you've got to go.  It'll be hilarious.  No, I want no problem.  Down to the Varick Street, but again.  It doesn't matter.  Earl's not going.  Fine, because he's not an American.  Don't be an American.  He's anti-American right now, Earl.  Screw you.  I'm not one of those Americans.  New York's greatest and finest are sitting down here waiting for beers.  You've got to go above and beyond and then get the delivery through.  Yeah, Earl, everyone's going above and beyond.  What do you think?  The answer is not no.  You don't turn around after the first guy tells you no. 
[04:11:00]  You take ten more chances.  Yeah, we turned around after the six guys told us that.  After the third checkpoint.  Because you guys drive in with a fucking black.  Excuse me.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Hello, you're effing.  All right.  Calm the effed out.  You guys drive in with an effing black van.  It looks very suspicious with the brother driving by.  You want to give us a new van?  Okay, okay.  Hold on.  Mark the van says, open Anthony wow.  Open Anthony wow on it.  That's not too suspicious.  I know that.  But look, Vinny from Rosedale's got a great point. 
[04:11:30]  He goes, wait a minute.  Mark, you're making my argument.  You're making my argument for me.  You're doing it for me.  Vinny from Rosedale says, wait a minute.  Isn't this the plot of Smokey and the Bandit?  Which is true.  Deliver the beer and the law is trying to keep your brother.  Eastbound and down.  Load it up and trucking.  That Earl is an attention getter.  Not on my watch.  The goddamn Germans got nothing to do with it. 
[04:12:00]  I am Sheriff Brantford.  I need a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Earl's Jerry Reed.  Marcus Burt Reynolds.  There we go.  What you need is a diversion vehicle like, let's say, a Trans Am.  And then the truck can get right through.  Oh, God.  We'll call him the dumbass. 
[04:12:30]  Earl, Earl, we'll send you down to the border.  You make believe you're selling drugs over to the side.  And then while they're looking at you, John Rossi will sneak through.  While they riddle me with bullets.  Remember what I said, Earl.  Talk to the head guy in charge.  And go over to him and say, say, cause we got some beers in here, mofo.  And we need to bring him in for the boys.  You know, just do the sweet talk.  All right, hold on.  Someone else wants in on this.  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  You're on with Psycho Mark.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Dude, listen.  We do shipping over here about an hour ago. 
[04:13:00]  I got a fax from FEMA.  And it says, don't pick up any dollar lading of loads, volunteer drivers, blah, blah, blah.  But it says, only authorized deliveries that have a manifest or bill of lading will be allowed in the disaster area.  Mark?  Mark?  Well, yes.  I've heard a thousand things like that.  I don't care about no manifests.  We got to get this through Hannibal for the kids.  Well, all I know is I'll get that van through at midnight as soon as I get off.  That's as soon as I can get down there.  Mark, what's the name of this top cop, as you keep calling it? 
[04:13:30]  There's no top cops, Earl.  You just have to go up to an email.  Sheriff Buford T. Justice.  Sheriff Buford T. Justice.  Let's set up a ramp, and you can just jump over the checkpoint.  Wanted for knocking down mailboxes?  Brought a girl across the state lines.  That's a man act.  Opie, get him a raft, and have him raft the beer in.  He can come in through Battery Park. 
[04:14:00]  Hey, boy.  I'm talking to you.  Sorry, Earl.  You seemed a lot taller on the radio.  Either that or I'll get a hand truck and roll the keg in.  Smokey and the Bandit rules.  There we go.  All right.  Well, operation.  Just try and get it in.  I mean, you guys, you can get it in.  You just have to talk to the rock.  Operation Infinite Beer is a bust.  Man.  It's not a bust, guys.  Don't give up now.  Country needs us. 
[04:14:30]  Terrorists are keeping beer from the people down there.  Pretty much.  We put our best man on the job, so obviously it's going to be a bust.  Yeah, right.  I have a handicap.  They're fun to watch.  How many hits you have today, Mark?  How many what?  How many hits you have today?  Two.  Me hitting myself and then me hitting you.  Ooh.  Oh, my God.  Not enough, Earl, brother.  Trust me.  When you're down here, I need a lot more than just weed.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Look, guys, try and get that in, and if not, I'll meet you guys at midnight, and I will get that beer. 
[04:15:00]  Murdoch, get a plane.  We'll fly it in.  For the kids.  Go get Pedro Guerrero.  He can get it in.  Murdoch, we've got to get the beer in.  Thank you, Mark.  Stay in school.  The kegs are waiting for you at the station.  All right.  See you later.  Bye.  Why do you need to bring them beer?  Who's hanging out till midnight, though?  Dummy.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  That's a bust.  Wow.  That wasn't very successful.  Ugh.  Oh. 
[04:15:30]  Even had the white guy drive.  Well, what are we going to do?  I'll feel guilty drinking it all ourselves.  We can't drink that beer.  No, we've got to get it down there somehow.  We'll figure it out.  Maybe we can bring it to a couple of the firehouses.  That might help, too.  Yeah, there's one right down the street.  Right down on 8th Avenue.  Plus, there's funerals going all over the city, too.  Do you suggest we bring a kegs to a funeral, Earl?  You're not listening to me.  In my horror, is that what I just heard you suggesting? 
[04:16:00]  You didn't let me finish.  Bringing a kegs to a...  Who followed?  No, I'm saying...  You'll be the life of the party.  No, I'm saying...  Holy S.  I was saying, there's funerals going on all over the city.  Really?  News.  It might not be in good taste to bring beer.  To the firehouses?  Sure.  Absolutely.  They need beer down there.  That's what I was going to say before you pound it all over.  A lot of funerals going on.  Yeah, let me finish.  All right.  Well, okay.  Get off the drug.  Obi and Anthony.  Come on and kick me. 
[04:16:30]  I've got my eyes wide.  I've got my big cheese.  I've got my hash pipe in America.  I've got my hash pipe.  I've got my hash pipe today.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Neil's got his hash pipe, I think.  Looks that way. 
[04:17:00]  Anthony, we have an update on Operation Infinite Beer.  Oh, thank God.  Our own war we're waging against thirst.  All we're trying to do is get a few cakes from Sam Adams down to ground zero.  To the emergency workers down there.  Working hard.  They get done with their shift.  They want to drink some beer.  And we're going to give them some.  This all started with Psycho Mark saying a bar was running out of beer.  We're like, well, this is the least we could do is make sure the fire guys  and everyone else down there, the policemen and the FBI and whoever else, 
[04:17:30]  has free beer to drink, right?  Exactly.  Earl went down earlier with all the kegs of beer and he had no luck.  He was turned away by many different police organizations, federal, state, and local authorities.  He told him he could not bring the van full of kegs of beer into the disaster area.  And Psycho Mark thinks it's a piece of cake to get through the FBI.  Mark told Earl, calling him a jerk, and what are you doing? 
[04:18:00]  Just tell him you know Psycho Mark and he'll get down there.  Psycho Mark at this point, I think, thinks he's running the whole show down there.  Imagine how quickly you get thrown in jail for driving a van down there and saying,  I know Psycho Mark.  All right, all right, clear the area.  He said something about he's a psycho.  Well, that's Earl.  Hey, Earl, what's up?  How you doing?  This show stinks.  That sounded like Lisa Orban talking.  Yeah. 
[04:18:30]  This show has no flow.  We just spent five minutes setting up a bit and there's nothing there.  Earl, nothing.  Well, you know, phones are kind of difficult down there in that area.  Maybe they're, uh...  We stink.  Maybe.  I listen to all the shows.  They set up their bits nicely and they go to it and then the guy talks and then they  have a nice wrapped up bit.  All wrapped up in a nice little package.  A radio package.  They also have songs like we heard the last segment.  Oh, yeah.  That's true, too.  Well, I will say that last call is the most interesting I've heard, Earl, in a long time. 
[04:19:00]  All right.  Here's Earl.  I'm assuming, Earl, you have some great news.  We got the kegs down to ground zero.  We're nowhere near it.  What?  Well, I'm sorry.  There's two things going on at one.  All right.  We're at a stop now.  Yeah.  And what's happening?  Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  You're live in 15 cities.  Can you help us out and talk a little bit?  I'm sorry.  I'm at a stop point.  You're what? 
[04:19:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Calm down.  Take a breath, Opie, because we need those phones for later.  You can't smash them.  Earl.  Yes.  Walk us through what is happening right now to you.  Where are you?  We're at a stop point right now.  I'm sorry.  I had three sets of cops talking to me at once.  Where exactly are you?  What are we doing?  Where exactly are you?  We just left.  They pushed us back off onto, like, I don't even know where we are. 
[04:20:00]  We're on Canal and Baxter.  Okay.  They made us spin all the way around.  Now, what is your plan now to get that beer through those lines?  I haven't the foggiest idea at this point.  All right.  You may be taking one.  Think about it.  We're following the plan of a drone.  Well, take one a second, Mark's suggestions.  What you've got to do is park the van, lock it up, walk to the line, and tell them what  you're doing.  Thank God, Psycho Mark's on line six. 
[04:20:30]  With big, giant, metallic objects with no identification, no authorization, could you  just make sure that my grave is kept clean when they shoot me?  Oh, stop now.  Psycho Mark.  Mark.  What a giant vagina he is.  Unbelievable.  Oh, he just hung up.  Earl just hung up, Mark.  He's got the problem.  He could throw himself in the Hudson River by this point after trying that.  The problem with Earl is he has no motivation. 
[04:21:00]  Now, this is very hard to do.  I understand how hard this is to do, but he has to overcome this and drive those kegs into  the area where the people need the beer.  Can we call Earl back?  Oh, sorry.  Hey, Earl.  I got a van.  I got a van full of beer for the kids.  Mark, you know where Earl is?  Yeah, he's down at Canal Street.  How close to you?  I'm unfortunately at Liberty Street and Broadway.  Oh, wait.  He only got as far as Canal Street? 
[04:21:30]  That's like the first checkpoint, right?  I think that area is open up to the public and he can't even get in there.  You get in the zone.  You're in the zone.  He'll be able to get to those bars.  No problem.  Are those bars open for business?  You bet.  So how come he can't just drive there like he was going to the bar and then give them  beer?  He can't even get where people can go, where it's open.  Tell me two reservations of the Tribeca Grand or something. 
[04:22:00]  They've kicked him out of an open area.  He's his own, handing out stickers.  All right, hold on.  Earl's calling back.  Let's all be nice and at least...  All right, I'll be nice.  No, he's gone now.  Because he just heard what you were saying.  I think he's having a bad time.  No, no, no, no.  He didn't.  He has shut off his cell phone, so you call him and it goes right into his voicemail.  So now he's refusing to talk to us.  Oh, my God.  All right, we wasted enough time on Operation Infinite Beer for this hour.  First of all, Mark is right.  You can get down there.  I mean, I did it myself.  You can.  Stinky did it last night, too.  It's just, you know. 
[04:22:30]  I was just down there.  Yeah, it's not that hard.  I was just there.  All you need is one.  One.  All right, hold on.  Earl's calling back.  Let's see.  There's no way of getting in there.  Hold on.  Earl.  Hey, Earl.  What's up?  I don't know where we are, but I'm standing in front of a fine state trooper and a fine  New York City police officer.  They just told us we cannot get any...  We can't get through.  There's traffic for miles.  I am coming back to the radio.  No, no.  Hold on. 
[04:23:00]  Hold on.  They're going to attack themselves.  Hold on, Earl.  Hold on.  Can we talk to the new NYPD?  Peel a banana.  Earl.  Yes.  Can we talk to the NYPD?  They refuse to talk.  I'm not going to talk to you guys on the phone.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  Well, you've told them what your mission is?  Earl, aren't we trying to get this beer to a bar that is open to the public?  I don't know.  What are they telling you now? 
[04:23:30]  Oh, me as well.  Earl, what are they telling you?  Loop around.  Let's tell us it's really bad, but we're going to have to go all the way down and loop around.  Maybe.  Whatever it takes.  Then do everything.  What are you going to go for?  What, Earl?  We're going back.  Screw this.  No, they told you...  No, they're not going back.  Hey, Earl.  They need the beer.  You've got to go loop around.  Who's going to get him a match beer?  Loop around.  Loop around.  Shoot him right now.  Shoot him now.  Kick him out.  They said loop around. 
[04:24:00]  Loop around.  Breaker, breaker for the bandit.  Put the pedal to the metal.  We got smokies.  You are so stupid.  I'm going to take you and talk to you in the head.  All right.  Earl, you're still on the line.  Earl.  Earl?  He's playing the silence.  A dereliction of duties.  Shoot him right there in the line.  I think we've lost Earl.  No, he's there because the phone didn't hang up.  You know, Earl's got to understand, though, that he has to go above and beyond.  If it means looping around somewhere, he's got to loop around. 
[04:24:30]  You're a looper.  A looper.  He's an expediter.  He's got to do that.  If the cops tell him he's got to go somewhere else, he's got to go somewhere else.  Again, just run back here with all the beer.  What's he doing?  And before we go...  Earl, Earl, Earl, I know you're there.  Your phone didn't hang up.  Can't he just carry and travel by tree limb?  Oh, man.  All right.  I just hung up.  That's the latest on Operation...  What?  I don't think it's working. 
[04:25:00]  Don't say that crap.  I didn't say that.  Operation Infinite Beer.  I don't think it's working.  No.  What happened?  Anthony's ex-mother-in-law would have got the beer there.  I would have gotten a box of wine.  Three rights.  Three rights make a left, Earl.  That's all you've got to remember.  Three rights make a left.  And if I was there, I would make sure the firefighters got boxes of wine so they could enjoy it. 
[04:25:30]  Maybe some grandma.  Yay.  But, Earl, if you're listening to me, take the van and make three rights because that's a left-hand tune.  Everybody knows three rights make a left.  Earl wants to go home.  Earl wants to go home.  But he can't.  He's got a mission to accomplish. 
[04:26:00]  I don't understand why he can't deliver the beer.  He ought to be able to...  I'll come up and drive boxes of wine across the line for the firemen.  Thank you.  All right.  Well...  I'll be an Anthony.  He's won the Daytona 500 twice.  He draws a crowd wherever he goes.

[04:29:30]  Say you buy a car from a private owner.  You remove the battery and the radio locks you out.  You call the original owner and he does not have the code.  What do you do?  The only way to get your radio unlocked is to take a visit to your local dealer.  They'll have to identify the radio make and serial number, access the info through their  database and unlock the radio for you.  Then they'll give you the code for future use if needed.  This service usually costs 60 to 100 bucks depending on what part of the country you live  in.  Or you could replace the OEM radio with an aftermarket unit for about 150 bucks and get great quality 
[04:30:00]  sound.  While you're at it, install a subwoofer, amplifiers, upgrade the speaker system, install tweeters.  Ooh, baby, what pristine sound.  Somebody stop me from spending your money.

[04:31:00]  Earl is back.  Can we get Earl back in the studio?  We were not successful on our mission.  Ben's in the studio.  Yes, Ben?  I think Earl will not comment, as usual.  What not comment?  I called him several times while this was all going on.  He would pick up his cell phone and hang up, and then I just received an update that he  was punching the console of the van over and over again when this whole thing was happening.  Well, wasn't John Rossi down there with him?  Get John in here, then.  Psycho Mark.  Dude, this is absolutely unacceptable.  This is unacceptable behavior.  I totally agree. 
[04:31:30]  You know, I mean, he doesn't have to punch the van.  I mean, who cares?  It takes him five hours to get the beer in.  Don't stop doing it.  The last we heard, they told Earl to loop around.  Loop around, Earl.  Did he loop around?  What happened to him?  Loop around, not.  We need to know if he looped around.  I doubt it.  I bet he went right on.  All right.  Oh, and hey, take care, man.  Hopefully they get the beer in, man.  All right, Chris.  We'll get the beer down there somehow.  All right.  All right, man. 
[04:32:00]  Later.  Yeah, they're trying to hunt down Earl or John to see what happened.  Just ponderous.  It's just ponderous.  Wow.  The market take a big hit today also.  What?  Dude, I'm right by the stock exchange right now.  It's actually on the other side of the building.  It's sad down here.  I'll tell you the faces of all that.  I was right outside the stock exchange.  Mark, we know.  We're trying to get away.  We don't need to be sadder.  We're all sad.  I understand.  That's what I would like to say about the song.  All right, anyhow, let's think about how we're going to get the frigging beer down here. 
[04:32:30]  Well, dude, I went back there.  You know, Earl gets pissed.  Earl is, get away!  Why is he pissed?  Why is he angry?  Dude, he was flipping out in the truck.  Yeah.  He was hitting stuff.  He was, like, yelling at cops.  He was yelling at cops?  Yeah.  Because he was...  Well, I'm no wonder.  You can't yell at cops.  Don't yell at cops.  They have enough going on.  So what happened when they told you to loop around, John?  We looped around.  We went to, like, the four checkpoints, and they finally sent us down to the Bowery. 
[04:33:00]  Right.  And they just laughed at us.  They're, like, we're not letting O&A down here.  I was, like, we're not letting O&A down here.  We weren't in the van.  It was the beer.  I was, like, I just want to drop off some kegs.  They're, like, no, there's not a chance you're getting down here.  Aw.  Where is this bar we're supposed to send the kegs to?  Nobody knew.  Every cop did not know.  It's right on West Broadway.  There's one on West Broadway.  And there's one right on Hanson.  But do you have to go through the FBI to get to this bar?  No, you don't have to go through the FBI. 
[04:33:30]  We're the worst.  He doesn't know.  He's an effing tool.  I'm trying to help.  No, it's just amateur night with Earl.  All right.  You know, I'll get him in.  I'll get him in later on tonight.  Come down here now and let's see what's going on.  All right.  You want me to meet you down there at the checkpoint?  I can get out of my camera shot.  Drive down right now and I'll meet you.  All right.  I'll meet you there.  Let's end the show with some good news with Operation Infinite Beer or whatever the hell  we're calling it.  All right.  I'm on my way.  All right, John.  Can you go?  Screw it all.  Yes.  All right.  Where do you want me to meet you? 
[04:34:00]  Just pull down there.  Call me en route and I will get a checkpoint through where you'll be able to come through.  Okay?  All right.  Good.  Hold on a line.  We'll see how tough you really are now.  Wow.  John's pissed at Mark.  Yeah.  Why are you pissed at him?  No.  Because, I mean, he doesn't really know, I guess.  It's like there's 15 cops at each checkpoint.  Listen to me, Schnappahead.  I got ten vans in here in the last week, okay?  All Fox vans.  All brass from Fox.  They went right through. 
[04:34:30]  Uh-oh.  Here comes Earl.  Earl, don't.  Earl, Mark, go fuck yourself, okay?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, my, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Woo.  Earl.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wow.  We could get your drunken coke up head down to this radio station.  Now, you take the goddamn beer, okay?  Wow.  All right.  We're going to dump out like crazy.  Woo. 
[04:35:00]  Earl came in with three FUs in a row and totally ate up our delay.  There may have been a C-S-er in there, too.  Wow.  Earl.  Earl.  Oh.  You know where it is.  Come and get it.  I will, my vass.  I'm going to show you how it's done.  You know where the bar is?  Mark's Temporary Apartment.  That's where the bar is.  Drunken.  Good.  You know why?  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[04:35:30]  Wait, wait.  We both of them.  We're out of delay now.  And Earl laughed.  We just both dumped out.  Wow.  Oh, Lordy Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  What the hell was that?  I don't know what that was, but we ran out of delay.  Earl cursed some more and then ran out of the studio.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Ooh.  Earl was heated.  All right, listen.  All right, John is on his way, I think.  We're going to put you on hold, Mark. 
[04:36:00]  We need...  Yep.  Dude, I'm running out right now, okay?  All right, bye.  Earl's got a good suggestion.  Do you know where to meet him, John?  No.  Well, he's got his cell phone number.  All right.  Earl's got another comment.  Earl, what?  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.  All right.  Really, Earl.  Yeah, okay, good.  I understand that.  Can we make a tribute?  We'll get Billy Joel's Angry Young Man and put all of Earl's clips to it.  We should really get that together.  Yeah, we've got to start our own Angry Young Man. 
[04:36:30]  Change it to incompetent young man.  No, just during all the little breaks, have his various tirades he's been holding for over  three years here.  Anthony.  Wow.  Our listeners, they work quick.  Yeah.  We've got another Bad Tribute song.  Uh-huh.  This one is about Operation Infinite Beer.  All right.  We deliver kegahs.  We deliver kegahs.  We deliver kegahs. 
[04:37:00]  We deliver kegahs.  No, we don't.  We deliver kegahs.  Go F yourself.  We don't deliver kegahs.  Go F yourself.  He had a very, very sad Arnold Drummond-ish pout.  Didn't he?  Yeah, he was very upset.  I pity the fool.  I pity the fool trying to make me deliver keg for the kids.  Stay off the drugs and stay in school.  This is Black Earl, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, Psycho Mark, what's up? 
[04:37:30]  Dude, I'm sitting right at Canal Street, and I've got an avenue open.  I already have police permission to just bring the vehicle in, unload the contents at the bar,  and we're all good to go.  As soon as he gets here, they're coming in.  All right.  Stay in the line, okay?  Yep, right here.  All right.  There we go.  He might be successful after all.  I hope so.  With the delivery of the beer.  Anthony, a quick round of what did we learn on the O&A show today?  Let's go right to the phones, all right?  All right. 
[04:38:00]  Kelly, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I learned a couple things.  Go ahead.  I learned that anyone wearing diapers on their head can expect to be searched.  Yeah.  And I also learned that Rick and Europeans are both uncircumcised.  Nice job, Kelly.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Dave.  Dave, what did you learn today?  Yeah, two things about Earl.  He sounds a little taller on the radio.  And also, I think he's off the door off because he needs that to keep from killing you all. 
[04:38:30]  Yeah, we're a little scared to go back to the office after the show today.  Thank you, Dave.  Let me go to Isaac.  Isaac, what did you learn today?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Earl's new name, black Earl's new name is Mr. E instead of Mr. T.  I'm better than a fool.  Don't admit to me, I'm better than a beer.  I learned it sucks to be the first guy on the national line.  Peace out, Norton.  You rule.  All right.  That's funny.  That's good.  Sucks to be the first guy on the national line.  That call will never get through.  That's very good.  Jay, what's up? 
[04:39:00]  Earl is actually attracted to Psycho Mark.  Wow.  All right.  Nice.  Let's move on to Joe.  Get the beer through for the kids.  Tracy writes, I learned that Operation ONA Kager to the rescue was put to a halt because  not enough looping was done.  And that is it.  All right, man.  We'll get out of here.  All right, man.  Thanks, guys.  I hope we gave you a few chuckles today.  Just going for a little distraction.  We know how serious everything is.  And let's never forget.  You know that, okay?  Of course.  I was born and raised in New York City in a housing project way up in the hood. 
[04:39:30]  I dressed in dark clothing so folks started calling me black girl.  Oh, and they used to laugh about it because deep down they knew they'd call me that because  I was just back as soot.  I've always been a lazy man.  A couch potato with a clicker in my hand.  See, motivation I never had.  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad.  For 20 years I never got a raise.  I'm 33 and I've never been late. 
[04:40:00]  I look busy but I'm not.  I'm just walking around.  I pick up some papers and I put them back down.  One day I'm gonna stop paying my rent.  Live in a refrigerator box.  Never get out of bed.  I'm black girl.  A genuine lazy bum.  I'll always make it through.  Hard times at any W.  Then one day some lame brains came and took Owen A-way. 
[04:40:30]  And at the age of 33, I felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole station on my shoulders.  And Ron and Fezzy knew what I was going through.  Every morning I'd unlock the door.  Lay down and I'd sleep a little more.  And then I'd put away the bathroom key.  Everybody was depending on me.  I ate a chicken wing with lemonade.  Lord, give me strength to make another day. 
[04:41:00]  Times I felt I couldn't go on.  Push a button, throw a switch, answer the phone.  Got lost in the van.  I did my PSAs.  Ten minutes work gonna take me all day.  I'm black girl, a genuine lazy bum.  I'll always make it through.  Hard times at any W.  I could hear Scott's old say,  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum. 
[04:41:30]  You'll always make it through.  Hard times at any W.  You can't enjoy me, say.  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum.  You'll always make it through.  Hey, this is Anthony's brother, Joe, notU2.com.  That was one of my songs, notU2.com.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.

[04:46:00]  Hi, guys.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hope you're enjoying the worst of.  We'll be back tomorrow live.  Don't you worry.  But we got one more bit for everybody today, the Fire Marshal Earl bit.  Fire Marshal Earl.  Apparently, this is after Operation Infinite Beer, which you just heard, I gather.  And the building was evacuated because of a fire.  And Earl, if you remember, was the assistant fire marshal for the floor of the building. 
[04:46:30]  One of the most useless things to be.  Wait, all these years, I thought he was the assistant fire marshal for the building?  No, just for our floor.  On the floor.  But we were in a building that was like 50 stories high.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Useless.  Thank God we gave him to Ron and Fez.  Obviously, we had no use for this guy.  And if you remember, I guess the alarm went off and Earl was down on the street while everybody 
[04:47:00]  was still up in the building.  While we were still broadcasting.  Yeah.  We were broadcasting.  Earl's the fire marshal for the floor is on the street.  Yeah.  Safe and sound.  I remember the fire alarms going off and those things in the ceiling were all lighting up.  And yeah, we were afraid that how long was going to start or something.  And also, like, where's Earl?  Oh, he's already out of the building.  And we lambast him about this whole thing.  All right.  Fire marshal Earl.  Yeah. 
[04:47:30]  Did that sound like we were really excited about this?  Oh, I would have.  All right, good.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I don't have to tell anyone that this city is on edge.  Oh, yeah.  Our building was just evacuated.  Well, I got a problem with fire marshal Earl right off the bat today.  Isn't Earl great as far as being the fire?  What is it exactly? 
[04:48:00]  I don't think it's marshal.  Earl, he's the fire marshal of the floor.  Of the floor when Pete, the engineer, isn't around.  And Pete's not here today, so it's Earl's job to make sure the staff of WNAW, our radio show here in New York, is out of the building.  Right.  That everybody gets out of the building safe and sound, which means Earl should probably be the last person that comes out of the building, right?  Yeah.  So we're on the ninth floor, and we're preparing for our radio show.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me set it up here.  And all of a sudden, Anthony and I are like, hey, what's all that noise outside the building? 
[04:48:30]  Yeah.  A lot of noise.  So we climb up and look out the window, the big, huge windows we got.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone is out of the building.  Everyone, except for our office.  Yeah.  And now there are fire trucks coming from all directions.  I'm like, wow, there's something big going on down there.  Yeah, I wonder what's happening.  I wonder what's happening down there.  Turns out to be our building.  Yeah.  It was so, I guess it was so scary that our sister station, which is upstairs, 1010 Winds. 
[04:49:00]  1010 Winds, the news station here, fled.  They, literally, they fled.  Dropped everything and ran.  It was a ghost town upstairs.  They just, they dropped everything and ran, not walked.  No.  Ran out of the building.  Yeah.  They did everything you're taught not to do and run.  Right.  Well, do you blame anyone at this point, you know?  Not really.  So then all of a sudden we're like, well, look at the crowd, look at the firemen.  And we finally realize it's us.  Matt Devote, one of the sales guys, he's on his cell phone calling us going, guys, oh, 
[04:49:30]  you're still there.  I was calling hoping you wouldn't be there.  Yeah.  They've evacuated the building.  What are you guys doing?  And we're like, what?  We had no clue.  So then who ran into the office?  Jeremy, I guess?  Yeah.  And then we found out that it's Earl's job to make sure we all get out of the building  and Earl's down, you know, saving his own ass.  Earl, what is your title?  No, that's not true.  What's your title?  I'm like assistant fire warden.  I don't know. 
[04:50:00]  Warden.  That's it.  Assistant fire warden.  When Pete Johnson is not here, you then become?  Head fire warden.  Right.  So, and I did say.  H-Nick.  Hey.  As far as the fire warden goes.  Melanie works at the front desk.  She came over.  She said, Wins is being evacuated.  The second I found that out, I went into your office.  I told Stinky, get out.  Let's go.  Earl, did you yell, feats don't fail me now?  No, I didn't.  When you fled the building?  No.  You didn't yell, feats don't fail me now? 
[04:50:30]  I could have sworn I heard that.  Thank you.  Is this true?  Did he come into the office and tell us to get out?  I don't think so.  I don't remember.  I said, let's go.  And someone said, don't be a puss.  I'm staying.  No, Earl.  The fire warden should be the last one out of the building.  Did you say, Lordy Lord, help me?  No.  As you fled the building?  Was there an Earl-shaped cutout in the wall where you ran through it?  Like a cartoon? 
[04:51:00]  I couldn't figure it out.  You're the fire warden and you left all of your people.  We had no clue, Earl.  I said, we're answering.  I poked my head in the office.  I went, we're on fire.  There's a fire.  Let's go.  We're answering email.  We're watching Bush's speech over our shoulder.  You guys couldn't care less.  You were like just standing looking out the window.  You were like, where's the marshmallows?  No.  No, Earl.  At that point, we're like, wow, what is going on?  That there's so many people outside.  We didn't know it was our building.  Until everyone started looking up, going, look at those two idiots looking down at us. 
[04:51:30]  Yeah.  Hi.  Not only that, Earl, what about all of us over here by the studios?  You know, it's on the other side of the building.  None of us knew anything.  Did you alert the entire floor?  That I didn't do.  That's your job.  People are a little sensitive to this stuff in the city right now.  I'm just saying that when Melanie came to our side of the floor.  Give me your bullhorn, Anthony.  You should have this bullhorn on you at all times.  Do a drill.  Do a drill. 
[04:52:00]  All right.  All of a sudden, you find out through whatever channels you use that there's a fireman coming to the scene here.  No, I heard this.  There's a fire on the 13th floor.  Please evacuate me.  Okay, you heard that.  We don't get that in our office.  It was everywhere.  You couldn't.  We did not get that announcement in our office.  I heard it.  It's not piped in on us.  There's now food studios, dude.  Right.  Because at this point, if it's someone, you know, toasting marshmallows on the 12th floor, I'm out of this building.  Unless the studios are on the air, everyone hears it. 
[04:52:30]  We did not hear it.  I'm telling you.  And that's something we've got to look into.  Didn't hear it.  But I heard it.  Can't you run up and down the halls with the bullhorn at least and, you know, warn people?  Could help us out, Earl.  Yes.  No?  A little help, Earl?  No?  Comment?  Anything?  Nothing.  You got nothing.  Comment?  Mike, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  We're on the 15th floor over here, and we were just as dumb as you guys.  We didn't leave either.  But we didn't know. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we had no clothes.  And we heard it was on the 13th floor, and we still stayed, except for our receptionist, Monica,  who was pushing people down the steps to get out like everybody else was.  And what was it?  It turned out to be a false alarm?  It turned out to be like nothing, or just something may stay straightened out, I guess, pretty quickly.  But they had the fire department here, yeah.  Oh, they had many trucks here.  And it was, what a sight, because we could see from our office building on the ninth floor,  Earl, as we're looking outside the building.  Yeah.  I heard someone from that office said, oh, don't be such a puss, I'm staying.  Don't be such a puss, I'm staying. 
[04:53:30]  But you're right, though.  We heard the 13th floor, and we're thinking, do we want to stay?  Do you want to stay?  Well, no, you're above the fire.  Of course you don't want to stay.  We were ready.  I was packed and ready to go.  Did you see the scene outside the building, though?  Monica did over here.  Well, what happened was, after they took care of whatever it was, the firemen are now exiting  the building, and there has to be over 1,000 people outside waiting to get back into the  building?  Yeah.  That's what she said.  And one by one, the firemen were coming out of the building, and all the people from  this building were just clapping. 
[04:54:00]  Applauding them.  It was like the rock stars were walking around down there.  It was amazing.  It was a teary-eyed moment.  Let me go, guys, all right?  All right.  All right.  Firemen after firemen leaving the building, and everyone just breaking out into a huge  applause.  Everyone's applauding.  As they're going back to their trucks.  Firemen are like rock stars now.  Yeah.  It's something, you know?  Everywhere they go, if you drive around Manhattan, you see the trucks going wherever they're  going, back to the firehouse or at a scene of a fire, whatever.  And people on the sides of the road always waving now. 
[04:54:30]  They're giving them a lot of support.  Well, it was really emotional.  I hope it lasts.  Really emotional because some of the trucks that showed up, they're from the firehouse  very close to here that lost a bunch of guys.  Mm-hmm.  But thanks, Earl.  Thanks for helping us out, making sure we get out of the building.  I got to say something about this building that we're in.  It seems to be bursting into flames all the time.  I've never been in a building where more fire alarms have gone off.  The other night the alarm went off.  It's always, you know, oh, there's a fire or, you know, leave the building, firemen are  investigating something. 
[04:55:00]  Man, some kind of, what are we, a papier-mâché building?  All right.  So that was some excitement just before the show today.  A little bit of excitement.  All Earl knows is that he got out okay.  Thanks.  Earl, we got to take the job away from you.  No offense.  Yeah, you're not a good fire warden.  I don't feel good with you being the assistant fire ward.  Dude, that's one office.  Earl, it's going to take more than let's go.  We had another person coming from the other side of this building saying, evacuate the 
[04:55:30]  building.  To who?  I didn't hear it.  Didn't stick it there heading in the soundproof studios we're in.  Earl, you should be running up and down the halls with that bullhorn screaming, get out  of the building.  Right.  Fire alarm went off.  They're evacuating the building.  No, Pete's not here.  I understand.  When Pete's not here, you have to step up.  That's not his primary job.  His primary job is the engineer of the station, you tool.  Oh, it's coffee.  All right, Earl.  Let's move on to Bobby.  Bobby, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  You had the fireman right there. 
[04:56:00]  Earl had to just carry the kegs out to the truck.  I didn't even think of that.  Operation Infinite Beer was a success last night, by the way.  Yes, with the help of Psycho Mark.  He did what he said he was going to do.  He got the beer in where Earl failed.  Mark is still below me.  Whoa.  Earl.  Earl, relax.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  Look at the face.  I know.  Earl, you've got to admit something. 
[04:56:30]  Oh, my God.  You weren't able to get the kegs down there.  And Psycho Mark.  Yeah, because he's laminated up to the wazoo.  Of course he can get it in.  T minus 10 seconds before Earl loses his effing mind.  What do you mean?  See, I was smart enough not to go back the third time.  John Rossi went.  He goes, and he came back.  He hates Mark as much as I do now.  And he said, yeah, he's got all these laminates.  He said he's like the Pope.  What do you mean, press laminates?  Yeah.  Well, you have press passes.  You've got to know how to talk. 
[04:57:00]  Are you trying to say the Pope has a lot of laminates?  Yeah, I have never seen the Pope with laminates.  Pope walking around with backstage passes around his neck.  Backstage passes to God's mind.  Yeah, he's got the VIP laminate.  Yeah, he made a hat out of all of them.  The special VIP, not the one that only gets you backstage.  All access, mother effer.  The Pope has laminates.  The Pope has laminates, according to Earl.  No, I didn't say that.  You said he had more laminates than the Pope. 
[04:57:30]  No, I said he was like the Pope.  You think the Pope's people are handing out other backstage passes to the hoes?  So when he gives his little address up there, he looks down.  You get me her, her, bring her back.  Look at the blonde up front, get her.  Wonderful.  All right, Earl.  Put words in my mouth.  Mark was laminates.  Mark, I talked to Mark late last night.  He was laughing openly at you.  I didn't care less about Mark Walsh.  Well, the guy, now, Earl, all I'm saying, I'm looking at the facts here. 
[04:58:00]  The guy came through where you...  He walked up to a barrier, said, hey, I'm with Fox.  He had all these laminates.  Let these guys in.  What's the problem with Mark?  It's a pain in the ass.  That's what his problem is.  What has he ever done to you?  Yeah.  Earl?  I'm probably not going to get angry.  Mark, he always seems to be bashing you, but sometimes I got to admit, he's got reason.  I mean, like yesterday was just a class A cluster F because I went, he calls, he goes, can we 
[04:58:30]  not, can we send it down, right?  I'm like, okay, who do I see?  Where am I going?  I was like, fine, I'll do it.  Where are we going?  He gives me nothing to go with and then yells at me for not knowing.  You didn't show the initiative that he showed in getting it there, though, Earl.  Show what?  Tell me where I'm going.  Mark is a true American hero.  I think Mark came through where you did fail.  It's a true American ass.  He delivers cackers.  Bobby's even getting some shots in it, Earl, today. 
[04:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Get a napkin.  Get a napkin.  We better take a break.  Oh, my God.  What did you do?  Pete's going to kill me.  I just poured coffee all over the board.  Oh, no.  What did you do?  Are we going to start going?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to short circuit at any moment.  Radio 101 right there, people.  You don't ever hold your coffee over a board.  At least it wasn't a total dunking.  Looks like a couple of channels. 
[04:59:30]  What are those used for, Opie?  Commercials.  We don't need a plug.  Are they commercial?  We don't need these buttons.  Oh, man.  That's bad.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner will make your penis grow.  Right.  It'll jump all over the place.  You see how the coffee was falling in slow motion?  Yeah.  I couldn't handle it.  I saw that.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We've got to clean out the board.  We've got lots to do today.  How about getting Earl pissed off a little bit there?  That was nice, right?  Yeah.  Will that help you?  We can use that.  Okay.  Okay.  Good.  Oh, wait.  Psycho Mark's back, too. 
[05:00:00]  Oh, good.  Hey, I think you'll be able to finish that song after all, right?  Psycho Mark's back.  Yeah, really.  After this, to Rod.  Don't change the dial.  It's going to get very interesting.  Psycho Mark checking in.  Mac, a lot of people confused.  Every time we have Psycho Mark on now, people write us emails and stuff and say,  why do you have Psycho Mark on the show?  I thought you were pissed at him for suing you.  Psycho Mark didn't sue us.  He used to work for us about a year ago. 
[05:00:30]  He got fired for having a couple have anal on the boss's couch during one of our Sex for Sam contests.  And he got fired.  We didn't want him to be fired.  They fired him.  His voice was still being used on this station.  So he retained a lawyer and got money he felt he was due for the station playing his voice.  Had nothing to do with our show.  We were a little taken aback when he first did it.  But on the other hand, how the hell are you going to keep a nut like this off a show? 
[05:01:00]  It's a credit to his talents as an effing lunatic.  He helped us out with Operation Infinite Beer last night.  Yes.  As we went off the air, we weren't sure if the kegs were going to make it to ground zero.  And shortly after we went off the air, mission accomplished, right?  But Earl and Psycho Mark still just going at it for whatever reason.  Earl just bashed Psycho Mark for some reason.  Earl really, you call him an a-hole and stuff.  I don't understand what the problem is between you.  Maybe we can fix this. 
[05:01:30]  Psycho Mark.  Yes.  Mark.  Hi, guys.  I'm calling from Champs Deli right down here on Wall Street.  Earl, you got a real problem with me or something?  Are you really being that un-American that you've got to bash me on the air?  It has nothing to do with being American or un-American.  It's just like...  Please stop.  Don't start, Earl, all right?  You did the most un-American thing last night by bailing out and pushing it out and going  back with the...  You're a complete un-American African-American.  How about giving me some sense of direction, a point person, some clarity on what is going  on?  What?  You're talking nonsense, Earl. 
[05:02:00]  It's senseless babble out of your mouth.  Senseless...  You're just the most un-American person in the entire world.  Rehab.  Hello?  He just said rehab.  He goes two words, Marshall.  Rehab?  For who?  I got a job, you dumb bastard.  I'm working.  Who needs a freaking rehab?  You need a mental...  You need a therapist, Earl.  You calling me mental?  Oh, who's the one punching the dashboard when he couldn't get a car?  I'm a star, even though I'm not.  What?  I just work a camera for Fox. 
[05:02:30]  Yeah, well, so what?  I'm making more money than you, you dumb bastard.  You've been there for ten years, and you still get the same damn job.  Yeah, but at least I know my worth, and I know my place.  All right, all right.  I don't pretend to be something that I'm not.  A schoolyard.  Your ass stinks just like everybody else's, Mark.  That's why I have a job.  That's why I've been moving up and working.  Oh, you went from getting coffee at Fox to working a camera for Fox.  Yeah, well, at least I wasn't looking to back at Scott Uni's hair bag for ten years. 
[05:03:00]  Whatever, Earl.  Look, all you did yesterday was the most un-American thing.  You gave up.  Yeah, I'm un-American.  Yeah, you did.  You did.  You gave up.  You went back.  You pounded his ass for it because you couldn't, and you didn't try it.  Whiskey-soaked, gin-soaked, cocaine-filled brain.  Cocaine, marijuana, cocaine, hash, everything.  Put it in my eyeball.  I don't care.  I'll do my job ten times better than you.  You F.  Mark, you sound a little upset.  It's a little upset.  You damn right have upset.  My neighbor is destroyed, and you didn't help one bit. 
[05:03:30]  You whipped out when the call came.  I did not whip out when the call came.  You actually did.  You couldn't get through.  You gave it one shot.  You gave it the old drive.  By friends of yours, law enforcement officials.  Yeah, you're a person.  Mark, how do you get the drugs in with all the searchers going on?  You pissed them off before you even get there by driving a van up at 100 miles an hour.  Mark, I've seen the way you drive, Earl.  You drive like a mental case, and they probably saw you coming and thought it was a lot.  I drive like a mental case?  Nobody wanted to ride with you when you drove the van.  No kidding, because you're a city boy.  You shouldn't be driving.  Whatever, Earl.  I'm just very disappointed that you gave up so quick. 
[05:04:00]  I did not give.  We went twice, Mark.  You gave up in, like, the weakest of the weakest.  Just ask for Mark.  You were the weakest.  I'm famous.  And I was like, who the F are you?  Who the F am I?  I'm just saying.  You gave up, Earl.  You didn't give it a shot.  I'm like, well, Mark Walsh.  You walked away.  You went back down the other way.  Everybody recognizes me.  I'm famous, even though I'm not.  Listen to you.  Is that all you can say, Earl?  Is just copy me?  Well.  Guys, tie a rope around his neck and push him out the window for a fratner side and not 
[05:04:30]  stand up.  Have another drink, Mark.  I ain't going to have a goddamn drink.  I'm going to huck the bottle at your head.  Mark, we have your brother on the phone who also wants to talk to Earl.  Psycho Tim?  Psycho Tim.  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Hey, Earl.  I've got to just say one thing.  The last time I was in New York City, you were going to a wow sticker giveaway, and you  got arrested or something.  They pulled you out of the car.  They fished you.  You couldn't even get to that thing.  Now, you see my roses are cracked and all that stuff, but yet he got the beer down there 
[05:05:00]  to us.  You can imitate him and all, whatever you want to do, but he still got the beer down.  One of the police guys.  Yeah, because he had proper...  That was my whole point of this whole thing yesterday.  We had proper credentials.  Which we didn't have.  He walked up, and he had the balls to go up to the guy and say, he whips it.  He had credentials, Tim.  He had credentials.  He had proper credentials.  He didn't have any credentials.  He didn't have any credentials.  What do you have, Earl?  You don't have any credentials at all?  I thought you worked at the radio station.  You don't have any credentials at all?  You don't have any credentials at all? 
[05:05:30]  This is a federal disaster area.  There are certain credentials that you need to bring stuff into the area.  You don't have press passes, Earl.  You don't have press passes.  You don't have press passes.  Not proper ones, no.  You got a press pass because you gave me a press pass.  I don't know if they were proper or improper ones.  The one that I have is for a non-emergency.  This is obviously an emergency.  The same press pass that I've been using the entire time, Earl, has gotten me past the line  a thousand times.  You don't be happy.  You work for a TV network.  Of course you're going to get it.  You should cut your balls off now, Earl, because you don't have any, okay?  If they're there, then I'd be a mystery balls because I don't know where they are. 
[05:06:00]  You've got none.  Kill yourself now.  Get in a coffin and die.  I'm not going to win against two walls.  Earl, you should start drinking right now and do yourself a favor.  Go get a hooker and get laid, you stupid virgin.  At least I don't bang no listeners, you...  Earl, calm down.  Earl, calm down.  Earl, you're just a wimp and you just can't face reality.  That's all I'm going to say.  I'll show you how much I'm a wimp I am.  You're un-American and you're a scumbag.  Just stay away from me, Mark.  Okay, all right, fine. 
[05:06:30]  That's fine, Earl.  I'll stay away from you.  You know what, because I'm down here in Cloud Zero helping out.  Just stay away from me, Mark, because I guarantee you someone will get injured and it won't  be me.  Come on down.  I'll push you under the...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Earl, why did that comment bother you, the hooker comment?  No, the hooker comment, I'm just trying not to get angry.  That's all.  Oh, yeah?  No.  Don't forget, I'm a little bit bigger than my brother is.  Well, all right, guys.  Guys, thank you very much.  All right, enough said.  Mission accomplished.  All right, Mark and Tim.  Tim and Mark.  God bless. 
[05:07:00]  See you guys.  All right, bye.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Thank you, Earl.  Bang up job.  I'm an American.  Blow me.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Are you all right, Earl?  No, I'm not all right.  What's wrong now?  What do you want to make you better?  You all right?  Did you have fun last night?  Yes, I had fun last night.  All right, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  You just get me worked up.  That's all.  All right.  Mm-hmm. 
[05:07:30]  Earl?  Oh, man.  All right.  We're trying to move on from the Earl thing, but Jerome, what's up?  I just wanted to say that I think it's kind of Earl's problem.  He's been having a bit of issues lately.  Issues?  Yeah, with the whole keg thing last night.  Yeah.  And he couldn't even mention to you guys that something was going on in the building.  It's kind of, you know, somebody needs to go through therapy for that.  Yeah, Earl, you want to talk to someone?  No, I'm fine.  You sure?  I just have low tolerance for stupidity.  It almost sounds like he's trying to cry, but not really, you know? 
[05:08:00]  I think you shirk your responsibilities sometimes.  No, I don't just shirk any responsibilities.  Well, you're the fire marshal warden guy for the floor, and we had firemen come into the building today,  and you just left everyone to burn.  I didn't leave everyone to burn.  Yes, you did.  You ran out.  You were out on the sidewalk.  We're in the office wondering what's going on outside.  You were looking.  Never mind.  Then we looked out the window, you're right, when we heard all the commotion wondering what was going on,  and noticed everyone looking up where we were.  Yeah, and then, you know, you could say what, all the hows and whys about it, 
[05:08:30]  but, you know, you didn't get that beer down there yesterday, you know?  You went twice.  I think there were bigger issues going down there than whether or not beer was getting there.  The mission failed, and you were in charge of it.  We replaced you with Psycho Mark, and it got done immediately.  Well, the listeners want to try to calm you down.  All right.  Doug, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Who was the brain genius that made Earl the fire marshal?  Yeah, Earl.  Who made you the assistant?  The assistant fire warden.  I had nothing in that decision.  I think it was based on senior. 
[05:09:00]  Hey, Earl, what grade did they teach you to become incompetent?  Second, third, or fourth?  Oh, you were the Doug.  What?  Yeah, you said, all right, I'm Doug from Springfield.  Guess what?  No one cares.  Oh, really?  Like, everybody cares about you, Al?  You think you're a tough guy, right?  You hang up on me because I want to call through.  That's the only strength you have?  You call every show.  Hey, I'm a big fan of the show.  Loser.  Goodbye.  He's a big fan of the station.  What are you hanging up for, Al?  Earl, why?  I didn't hang up on you, Doug.  No, no, Earl.  Why are you running away for, Earl?  Because I don't deal with losers.  Talk a little louder.  Get a job, Doug.  Take the sausage out of your mouth. 
[05:09:30]  Oh, Earl.  I'll buy you a nice gal, Earl.  Yeah, get a job, Doug.  I do have a job.  All right.  And I do a lot better than you do your job.  I guarantee you I'll come in on a Monday and I'll do anything you could do better, which  is nothing anyway, so.  Come on.  Challenge is on.  Bring it on.  I'll come in Monday and I guarantee you I'll do your job.  Bring it on.  Blindfold it better than you do it.  Bring it on.  Not that you do anything.  Let's do the retarded Laverne Sherl.  You do nothing.  You got nothing.  Remember what happened to them when they thought they could do a radio show?  That's what you do?  No. 
[05:10:00]  I didn't say I did.  What do you do, sir?  I'm just pointing out an example, Doug.  Sir, what do you do, sir?  I'm in the promotions department.  Promoting what?  Nothing?  I'm a service director.  That's an easy job promoting nothing.  Well, you lick a few envelopes.  It's the only thing you do lick, bud.  Well, first of all, the interns do the wild mail.  See?  Knowing nothing about the radio station, thinking that you...  Why do you hate me, Earl?  How come you hate me?  I don't hate you.  I just dislike you.  There's a difference.  I can hear the anger in your voice.  There was a big difference.  I just hate these Monday morning quarterbacks thinking that they know everything.  What are you, crazy?  What are we talking about football now? 
[05:10:30]  It's a figure of speech, you ass.  You want to be a football player now?  It's a figure of speech.  What about the figure of speech?  If you use that mask between your ears called your brain every once in a while, you would  know what that means.  Why do I want to be a quarterback?  I didn't mention anything about playing football.  I did play football, though.  You're just stupid, Doug.  Just admit that you're stupid.  Just say it.  I'm an idiot, and I'm stupid.  Good lineman.  You don't know it.  You're just stupid, Doug.  I'm not a virgin, though, like you.  Again, something you know nothing about.  He doesn't hit a nerve, because it's not true. 
[05:11:00]  What's not true?  You're obviously not doing anything.  You're going to be on the radio station all day.  Why do you want to be a Monday morning cornerback?  It's a figure of speech.  Football's played mostly on Sundays.  What are you talking about, Earl?  You know what you're talking about, Doug?  Ron and Fez are on in two and a half hours.  You can call them then.  We'll show it about Ron and Fez.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  There you go.  Doug from Springfield.  Doug from Springfield.  Helps out our show.  We like Doug, girl.  Hey, Rhett, your assistant to the assistant fire ward. 
[05:11:30]  Hey, Chris, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, man?  Yeah, Earl looks like he's going to lose his mind any second.  Hey, Earl, let me ask you a question real quick, all right?  You can't hang pictures.  You can't deliver beer.  And you can't get people out of a supposed burning building.  Don't you understand why you work there?  Have you figured out yet why you work there, what your position is?  Why don't you take a hint?  Are you talking about what you're talking about?  You have an absolute no, you don't have no clue.  Hey, Earl, Earl, Earl. 
[05:12:00]  All right, leave Earl alone.  We like Earl.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Why is everyone calling up Earl and bitching him out?  Oh, I love Earl.  Wait, let me explain something.  I can't deliver.  We're trying to, first of all, people are dying.  People are dead.  They're digging up dead.  They're trying to get in food, supplies, and other things.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  I didn't have any credentials to be down there.  We had no business being down there.  You don't have any press passes.  We're just trying to prioritize things a little bit. 
[05:12:30]  Earl, how do you get into other promotions?  We had no credentials.  We had no point person.  We had no, we didn't even know where we were going.  And then the person who put it together gave us no clue on where to go.  Earl, you got up to checkpoints.  How do you get into other promotions?  You have a press pass, don't you?  Or did you tell them a press pass and say, I'm a black girl from the LPNF show?  And they didn't give a rat's ass about it.  Federal agents did not give a rat's ass about a show based in New York.  You don't get it.  It's a federal disaster area. 
[05:13:00]  This isn't a, I give up.  All right.  Ben, who's homesick today.  Oh, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  How you feeling?  A little bit better.  Are you feeling better?  A little bit better.  Ben's lips turned blue in the office, so he sent them home.  Ben, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, before the show, starts shivering in the office.  He's got goosebumps.  His hair is standing up.  His lips are blue.  And he's like sitting in his chair shaking.  He looked like Robert Downey Jr. from Less Than Zero.  Right.  No joke. 
[05:13:30]  I mean, I'm not even joking.  Goosebumps, hair on his arm, standing straight up, blue lips.  Blue lips.  And he's like shivering.  And it was warm in the office.  Even a sick Ben wants in on this one.  Ben?  Yeah, I have to say that out of the whole radio station, out of everyone there, I'm probably  better friends with Earl and Mark than anyone.  And when I tell you I've talked to both of these guys separately about this, I really think  we're going to have a problem.  They both want to, like, beat the crap out of each other.  Mark is completely pissed.  Earl's completely pissed. 
[05:14:00]  I really think we're going to have to keep them separated.  I've never seen, especially Earl, ever like this.  And I've pissed Earl off many times.  But never, like, I've seen him the last 24 hours.  Yeah, Earl.  Did he break anything in the last 12 hours?  Yeah.  Didn't he yell at Ben yesterday, like he said, get away?  Yeah, I asked Earl to come to the party last night.  I said, you know, Earl, you've got to move on.  And he screamed at me and said, get away.  And, you know, he was angry.  And then Steve and Snakey tried to get him to go. 
[05:14:30]  And then finally, when I got to the party, Open Jeremy told me to call him.  And we called him.  And he said he wasn't coming.  He had work to do.  And I said, you know, everyone wants you here.  And, you know, he finally showed up.  But he's – I've never seen Earl like this.  And I've known Earl a long time, more than anyone there.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  See you later.  All right.  We've got to move on, Earl.  You're going to be all right?  I'm fine.  One more you're saying?  Andrew.  Hey, how could a guy with no motion be from motions? 
[05:15:00]  And Earl, I've heard your Sunday night show.  You have nothing to crow about.  Yeah.  What's your profession?  Don't worry about what my profession is.  I'm asking you.  What do you do for a living?  I drive a truck.  Exactly.  All right.  Next call, please.  I make a lot more money than you, Earl.  Yeah.  Blue shoes.  No one is going to beat that line today.  We might as well go home now.  The line of the day.  How could you be in pro motion if you have no motion?  Okay. 
[05:15:30]  Next road show when everyone's asking me for a shirt.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Have a good weekend, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Bravo.  That's too funny.  Hey, Chuck, you're next on the ONA show.  What's up?  Hi, it's Joe.  All right, Joe, what's up?  Hey, I've got a new name for him.  How about Affirmative Action Earl?  Affirmative Action Earl?  Earl, comment.  Earl's been here for many years.  We like Earl.  Earl, don't lose it, man.  Earl, take a deep breath. 
[05:16:00]  He always seems to.  We like Earl.  Earl's like the cockroach.  Doesn't matter how many nuclear blasts happen in here and cleans the place out, Earl still  stays here.  He remains.  Lives on.  You all right, Earl?  I'm fine.  Take a deep breath.  We don't want you losing it today.  Why does Keith the Cop want in on the Earl thing?  We really have to move on.  I don't want to see Earl lose it today.  Keith.  I cannot think of one cop that if you pulled up with a van full of beer, that would have 
[05:16:30]  said, no, you can't get in.  He just probably pulled up just like Earl always does.  He probably says, uh, hi, how you doing?  I'm with it.  And the guy says, no.  Keith.  I'm sorry.  May I interrupt for a minute?  Go ahead.  First of all, I was not driving.  Second of all, we fully explained our purpose there.  Uh-huh.  And you weren't driving.  You were probably sleeping like you do with every sticker stop.  If I pulled up in a police car and told you were at a sticker stop, you were sleeping.  We fully explained our purpose for being there, and it fell on deaf ears with every single 
[05:17:00]  You've got to work it.  Psycho Mark works it.  Every single cop we pulled up on, they said, no way are you getting into this area.  You got to work?  We worked it.  What am I going to say?  We worked it.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Keith.  Yeah, I'm losing you guys.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  There goes Keith Cop.  No, we got to move on.  Yeah.  We spent way too much time on Operation Infinite Beer.  All I know is the beer made it, okay?  It was a success.  Sorry to say, but no thanks to Earl.  Right there, Earl.  You all right?  I'm fine. 
[05:17:30]  All right, Earl.  No, man.  I'm pretty effing far from OK.  All right.  We got to take a break.  All right.  We really do.  This is Black Earl, and I approve this worst of.  Obi and Anthony.  The hockey games may be on hold, but there's no such thing as an offseason on home ice.  Not by a long shot.  We keep you in step with every move that's made.  30 teams.  No waiting.  Are you thinking about retirement at any point?  Are you going to keep on?  No, I'm having too much fun. 
[05:18:00]  Coast to coast.  Squad by squad.  Player by player.  And now, we're the exclusive partner of the NHL.  This is just a bonus, I think, for everyone.  The home of hockey.  Part of the XM Sports Nation.  Home ice.  XM 204.  The joint XM 101.  The sounds of roots reggae.  The big sounds that put Jamaica on the map.  I shot a sheriff.  But I didn't show you.  XM 101 is also the contemporary sounds of dance. 
[05:18:30]  And every day, we be burning, not concerning what nobody...  Lovers rock.  From a little cottage in the green...  And dub.  Welcome to the giant XM 101.  We will finally have a president who doesn't mind pulling over and asking for directions.  Am I right?  Ladies and gentlemen...  XM Radio, dedicated to the proposition that all voters have a right to 24-hour coverage  of the 2008 presidential campaign, announces the arrival of POTUS 08. 
[05:19:00]  POTUS 08 is the first of its kind news channel devoted to coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign.  I don't believe Washington can be transformed by someone who's never tried doing such a thing before.  In any setting.  By someone who's never run a corner store, let alone the largest enterprise in the world.  POTUS 08.  24-7 coverage of the presidential elections starting this month.  Non-partisan and commercial free in the land of the free. 
[05:19:30]  On XM Channel 130.  Now, let's have some fun.  Let the celebration begin.  POTUS 08.  Where everyone is an insider.  Now, the Success Journal.  Here's Chris Whitting.  Two brothers named John and Horace were natural hands with mechanical stuff.  So, they opened a machine shop.  Their first customer was a man named Olds, 
[05:20:00]  who asked the brothers to build parts for a new car known as the Oldsmobile.  John and Horace were soon earning cash.  But they noticed Mr. Olds was doing even better.  Deciding they'd sell cars too,  the brothers began building affordable, high-performance cars that went the distance.  Before long, sales were full speed ahead.  I'll bet you know John and Horace.  By their last name.  Dodge.  Thanks to the Dodge brothers' brains and business sense, 
[05:20:30]  the Dodge name is still a legendary one in the automotive world.  It's still giving the competition a run for the money,  and it's still a top seller.  With the Success Journal, I'm Chris Whitting.  This is your National Geographic Minute.  I'm Patty Kim.  Deep within the bowels of the Earth,  way at the bottom of the oceans,  are deep-sea vents known as black smokers. 
[05:21:00]  They spew super-hot, acidic fluid full of minerals  from the Earth's crust up into the ocean  at a rate as high as 300 gallons every minute.  Oceanographers who study these deep-sea vents have confirmed  they also make low, rumbling sounds during their eruptions.  These sounds may result from the friction caused  when scorching hot fluid from within the Earth  meets the chilly waters of the ocean.  Scientists speculate that sea creatures may use these noises  to help navigate the pitch-dark ocean depths. 
[05:21:30]  They hope studying the sounds will increase understanding  of how chemicals from the Earth's crust mix into the oceans.

[05:22:00]  Ah.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Time to play a quick round of what did we learn  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll start with Angela.  Angela, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Today I learned that the Pope has a lot of laminates.  Ah, yes, we did learn that.  Nice and early.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Come see you soon.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bop.  Bop.  Bop.  Rob from Staten Island.  I learned two new words, re and hab.  I learned Lisa, the sales girl, used to manage spinal tap.  A lot of people saying I learned that the Pope has a lot of laminates. 
[05:22:30]  Mike writes, today I learned that you don't need motion to be in pro-motions.  Pro-motion.  Ah, foo-foo.  Could be the best instant feedback of the day.  Hey, Earl should have thrown the beer barrels down the street like Donkey Kong, and the federal  agents could jump over them, and the firefighters could smash them open with their hammers to  get the beer out.  Now that would be a hell of a sight.  Do you have audio over here? 
[05:23:00]  Let's see if that rings a bell.  Here goes Earl.  Oh, he's getting the kegs through.  Oh, look at the FBI's jumping over him.  Hey, someone's coming with hammers.  Oh, good.  The firemen are breaking them open with their axes and getting the beer out of it.  Thank God.  Donkey Earl.  Whoa, that FBI agent almost got Donkey Earl. 
[05:23:30]  We are getting a look from Earl through the door right now.  This is hate Earl day.  Oh, he knows.  He knows.  Uh-oh.  Well, he's heading back to the N.E.W. van to finish the game.  There he goes.  Come on.  Getting to ground zero.  He's rolling the kegs.  Oh, now he's looping around, I think.  He's trying to loop it.  Uh-oh.  And here comes Psycho Mark.  Yeah, game over.  Damn.  Let's go out to Sacramento, California, Anthony. 
[05:24:00]  Dave.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  What did you learn on the radio today?  I learned that Earl screamed, feet still, fail me now as he was running out the building.  Amen.  He absolutely did.  Very good.  Thanks, Dave.  See you later.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Is that what happened, too?  Is that we have audio of Earl leaving us behind?  The fire department showed up earlier, and he's the fire warden for this floor.  Oh, my God.  So here's Earl's warning to get out.  He just ran away, I think. 
[05:24:30]  Yeah.  All right, he's jumping over people, not alerting anyone, trying to get to the fire exit.  He is stopping to have some keg beer right now.  Yes, that is rolling down the stairs after.  And, yep, out the front door.  There you go.  Leaving everybody behind.  Good job, Earl.  This is Black Earl, and I approve this worst of.  All right, let's get back to Earl.  Hi, Earl.  We came up with a little song for you.  Earl?  Why are you giving the international sign a big whoop? 
[05:25:00]  What am I going to do about it?  You want to just play it?  Jesus Christ.  Is he going to lose his mind?  Can we play the Angry Young Earl song, please?  Yeah, it's ready.  All right.  Earl, you want to put your headphones on so you can hear the song?  You're going to love this, Earl.  Tribute.  A lot of people know by now that Earl has a short fuse.  Very, very short temper on Earl.  So we decided to come up with a little ditty.  Rick worked very hard on this, Earl.  We've had a couple of instances. 
[05:25:30]  I hope you're appreciative.  A couple instances on the show here where Earl might have lost his temper, gotten a little  mad.  Maybe we were on the phone with him at a sticker stop.  You know, recent events with the beer of having, we had kegs of beer that we wanted  to deliver to the emergency workers down at the World Trade Center, and Earl couldn't  deliver the beer.  Psycho Mark did it in two seconds.  Earl couldn't do it.  He went down there two attempts and failed, and he got a little angry at the criticism  he was taken for that.  I think we've wasted enough time, Anthony. 
[05:26:00]  Yeah.  Here we go.  It's angry young Earl.  Why don't we get Black Earl in here and see why he's so upset?  I think we all know, but it's always fun when he tries to explain himself.  Got some rage.  T-minus ten seconds before Earl loses his epic mind.  Oh, here comes Earl.  Earl, don't.  Oh, wait, wait.  Earl.  Mark, go f*** yourself, okay?  You.  You.  What the hell is that?  Go f*** yourself, okay?  You. 
[05:26:30]  You.  Oh, my heart.  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  Come and get it.  Does the three letters F-B-I mean anything to you?  I'll let Chuck Goldbroil meet you people, eh?  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  What's the problem?  Ask Earl, what's the problem?  What's the problem, Earl?  Why are you angry?  Well, I'm just a little irritated, that's all.  So when I get irritated, I leave the situation.  Why did he slam the door?  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  Earl.  Earl. 
[05:27:00]  Earl.  Earl.  I don't know.  Does Earl realize how gay he sounds right now?  Right.  Kiss my ass.  Did the invisible man follow you out, Earl?  It's a pain in the ass.  That's what he's trying to do.  He gives me nothing to go with, and then yells at me for not knowing.  Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it.  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  No violence in this office.  It's too loaded on.  He's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  You calling me mental?  You, you, you calling me mental?  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[05:27:30]  Earl, calm down.  Guess what?  No one cares.  I'm famous, even though I'm not.  Who the F are you?  Gin-soaked, cocaine-filled brain.  We're trying to, first of all, people are dying.  People are dead.  They're digging up dead.  They're trying to get in food, supplies, and other things.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  I didn't have any credentials to be down there.  We had no business being down there.  Just say it.  I'm an idiot, and I'm stupid.  The place in the world for the angry young man  With his working-class pies and his radical plans 
[05:28:00]  He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl  And he's always at home with his back to the wall  And he's proud of the scars and the battles he's fought  And he struggles and leads as he hangs on his cross  And he likes to be known as the angry young man  He's got all these laminates.  He's like the Pope.  Are you trying to say the Pope has a lot of laminates?  Yeah, I have never seen the Pope with laminates.  Earl, comment.  F*** you.  A moment or two to the angry young man  With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand  With a stab in the back, even misunderstood 
[05:28:30]  It's a comfort to know his intentions are good  And he sits in a room with a lock on the door  With his props and his men are laid out on the floor  And he likes to be known as the angry young man  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  Well, the mic was drooping down with a slam down on the board.  That's why I was holding the microphone.  When you lost the age  Consciousness and righteous rage  I found that just surviving  Was a noble fight  You ass  I once believed in causes too 
[05:29:00]  I had my pointless point of view  And life went on no matter who wrong or right  Guess what?  No one cares.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  There's always a place for the angry young man  With his fist in the air and his head in the sand  And he's never been able to learn from mistakes  So he can't understand why his heart always breaks  And his honor is pure and his courage is wealth  And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell  And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man 
[05:29:30]  It's a figure of speech  What about the figure of speech?  If you use that mask between your ears called your brain every once in a while  You would know what that means  You don't get it  It's a federal disaster area  This, this, this, this is an old  Whoa!  Earl, calm down!  Earl, comment  I'm the public service director  Earl, Earl  Earl, Earl  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  They don't give a rat's ass about beer  F*** you  This is an old 
[05:30:00]  There's always a place for the angry young man  With his working class ties and his radical plans  He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl  And he's always at home with his back to the wall  And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost  And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross  And he likes to be known as the angry young man  Hey, how can a guy with no motion be in promotion?  I don't know!  I don't know!  I don't know!  Earl, I'm the public service director  I say this, even though I'm not  Screw this  Stay away from me, Mark 
[05:30:30]  Because I guarantee you, someone will get injured  Yeah, Earl, Earl, any final words?  Who the F are you?  You  Ass  Tell me where I'm going  Whoa  Earl, calm down!  You calling me mental  Screw this  Gin-soaked, cocaine-filled brain  You  Ass  Again, something you know nothing about  They don't give a rat's ass about beer  Your ass stinks just like everybody else's  Just say it  I'm an idiot  And I'm stupid  You  Ass  That's why I brought the fader down 
[05:31:00]  Screw this  Go  F*** yourself, okay?  There he is  Thank you, Earl  Earl, thank you  Thank you  Alright  Bye-bye  Bye-bye  We look forward to your next phone call  With great anticipation  That's right  Now, don't stop it  Wow  Now, that's, you know, in the same vein as all the tribute songs that are out there now  That's my favorite tribute song out there  With the clips and with the real song there  There is an example of how it's supposed to be done 
[05:31:30]  That's how it's done, right there  Earl?  Earl, comment  I don't care what you're doing right now, I saw you smiling  I saw you smiling and you laughed a couple of times  He's trying to cover his mouth with his fist like this  But I saw you smiling under there, pal  What'd you think, Earl?  Earl, comment  What'd you think?  Earl  Earl, what'd you think, man?  What'd you think?  Earl  He's starting to smile, though, man  Nodding his head slowly, yes  Earl 
[05:32:00]  If you're not going to say anything, then leave  But say something  You liked it  He liked it  Yeah  You liked it, right, Earl?  I think Earl liked it  Nod your head if you liked it  It was good  It was fun  Did you like it, Earl?  He's like Mikey  We're all hoping he liked it  He's honored that somebody would take his many instances of being a horse's ass  And make a song out of it  Earl, say something  We gotta move on with the show  Yeah  You know, if he wasn't black, this wouldn't be menacing at all  You know  Earl?  Come on, say something 
[05:32:30]  Anything, Earl?  Any comment at all on what you just heard?  The angry young man for Earl  All right, great  There it is  Earl  All right, Earl  Let's get Earl out of the studio  No?  Yes?  Earl?  Comment?  Anything?  Ugh  Jesus  Earl, we're insulted  Anything?  No?  Earl?  No?  Anything, Earl  Believe it or not, people  Earl is actually standing right in front of a mic right now 
[05:33:00]  It's not like we're just talking to nobody  Earl is standing in front of a microphone  Headphones on  Are you trying to be, are you trying out to be Roger Daltrey and Tommy?  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  Earl, can you hear me?  That's the next one  Can you feel me near you?  Just say you liked it because you know you did and then go back to work  And we know you did  Earl?  Ugh  No?  All right, we'll try harder next time, I guess  Earl, before we play this because we're going to take a break  Nothing? 
[05:33:30]  Earl, now you've had time to reflect on the song  Anything?  Nothing?  Earl, come on  What are you going for here?  Yeah  I don't understand what you're really going for here  All right  Is it the intimidation?  No, Earl's not like that  Earl's not a violent guy  All right  Take a break  And Earl's still saying nothing  Well, Catholic girls are frigid  They never let me go down there  And the Hebrew girls, they were the worst of all 
[05:34:00]  They wouldn't part with a pubic hand  The Hindu Indian hose bags make me beg for it all night  And the Baptist girls, they never give it up  That's why their peaches are so tight  I wish they all could be Talibati  Girl  Wish they all could be Talibati 
[05:34:30]  I wish they all could be Talibati  Girl  We'll call the girls a gun shy  Cause we beat them when we can  We made them wear the burka in the desert  So the coochies fell like rancid clams  I've been all around the Middle East  And I've run into a glitch 
[05:35:00]  Because as of late  They sent me back to the States  To be some big black inmates bitch  Oh no  I wish they all could be Talibati  Girl  Wish they all could be Talibati  I wish they all could be Talibati  Girl  I wish they all could be Talibati  Girl 
[05:35:30]  Wish they all could be Talibati  I'll be an Anthony. </pre>
