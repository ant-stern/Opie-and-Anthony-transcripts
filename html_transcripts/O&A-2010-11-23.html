<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts riffing on their controversial image and continued success on satellite radio.  They then discussed a near-plane crash involving Leonardo DiCaprio, focusing on the pilot’s calm demeanor and speculating on his motives. This transitioned into a discussion about videos of people performing dangerous stunts on skyscrapers, analyzing the risks and psychology involved.  The conversation took a sharp turn towards their strained relationship with the Hungerthon charity, detailing a past incident involving a double dildo show with prostitutes that led to their banishment.  They aired their frustrations with SiriusXM, citing unfair promotional treatment compared to other, less popular, personalities.  Their cynical views on the North-South Korean conflict and the US military presence in the DMZ followed, before shifting to Michael Vick's rehabilitation attempts and Derek Jeter's contract negotiations with the Yankees.  They then previewed their upcoming guests: Charlie Sheen's escort, Howie Rose (Islanders announcer), Walt Frazier, Dane Cook, and Lee Majors, planning a game around Lee Majors' interview, offering $10 for every "what," "huh," or "pardon."

The show continued with a discussion on reverse mortgages, followed by a nonsensical interlude featuring a song and Miley Cyrus's 18th birthday. A comedic bit about *The Six Million Dollar Man* then segued into a discussion about a Howie Rose radio segment.  Stevie, an intern, presented a poorly edited audio clip, sparking a heated argument between him and Danny over Stevie’s perceived incompetence and unprofessional behavior, encompassing workplace blunders, lying, and even his Facebook activity.  Danny essentially issued Stevie a warning.  The argument included tangents about Seinfeld, the Magna Carta, and the Louisiana Purchase, as well as a mention of Travis accidentally kicking Stevie in the testicles.

Walt "Clyde" Frazier then joined the show to promote his book, *Rock and Steady: A Guide to Basketball and Cool*.  The conversation covered Frazier's career, the disparity between past and present NBA salaries, the financial struggles of retired players, and the evolution of basketball. He discussed his Rolls Royce, his time with the Knicks and in Cleveland, and his current life in the Virgin Islands. He shared anecdotes about his playing days, mentioning Earl "The Pearl" Monroe, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, and Jerry West, touching upon team chemistry and the impact of ego.

Dane Cook called in to discuss his greatest hits CD, touring, his Broadway role in *Fat Pig*, and his social media use.  Lee Majors then arrived in-studio.  His interview focused on his career, particularly *The Six Million Dollar Man*, the release of a new box set, and the changes in Hollywood.  He discussed a Palm Springs tram stunt, his ten-year acting break, the pervasiveness of paparazzi, and anecdotes about working with Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck, Andre the Giant, and a mummified criminal used as a prop. The creation of *The Bionic Woman* and rejected ideas for a bionic boy and dog were also discussed, along with the show's iconic sound effects.  Majors’ wife made a surprise appearance, leading to humorous speculation about her age and their relationship, followed by a sexually explicit phone call concluding the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  It's a fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest view  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie here  6 years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, all right  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Is this the last draw for the watching radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on  Yeah, let's do this, huh?  We almost lost Leo?  What happened? 
[00:01:00]  We almost lost Leo DiCaprio  I just saw like a quick plane thing  What happened?  Well, they teased it all last night  And I was like, fuck this  I'm going to bed  What Hollywood superstar was on that Delta plane  That almost sort of crashed  If another engine went out  Right  And then I was like, ah, whatever  The plane didn't crash, so this is a non-story  But now they're rolling with it  That Leo DiCaprio was on this Delta flight 
[00:01:30]  Leo was on it  Out of New York City, I believe, right?  Yeah  Lost an engine  Lost an engine  And the pilot's smooth as silk  Oh yeah, the pilot was just like  Asking a few questions  Saying, ah, we need to turn around  And then the tower's going  Hey, JetBlue  You see anything happening with that Delta flight?  And JetBlue's like, ah, yeah  A little spark or something  A little flame  And then the Delta guy gets back on  And says, ah, we lost an engine  And the other guy  All the smoothest shit  JetBlue, you see anything there?  Ah, yeah  A little spark in the engine 
[00:02:00]  And I think I see Leo DiCaprio in the window  Boy, what a handsome man  Anyone else would be screaming their asses off  Oh, I know  Fucking  Not the pilots, though  Smooth  I think those guys secretly want to go down  You think so?  In a blaze of glory  I really do  Or maybe they want to be the next Sully  I think they're hoping to be the next Sully  But you know what's going to happen?  I live in that area  I know for a fact  That I'm going to see another fucking Sully situation  That is just going to be a pinwheeling plane 
[00:02:30]  Down the Hudson River  With people just flying out of the plane  Flaming cartwheel  That's how it always happens  Flaming pinwheel  I will guarantee that there'll be another Sully type of situation  That ends horribly bad  And it'll be right in the same area, too  Like, oh, if Sully can do it, we can do it  You know that's going to happen  Ah, yeah  Yeah, we'll just land in the river  This is great  Yeah  It's a little choppy today  Oh, boy  Yeah, one chop and that plane comes apart  It comes apart  Yeah, everybody forgets it was smooth as glass 
[00:03:00]  Sure  The river that day  It had to be  Because if any of those people fell in the water  They would have been, you know  Yeah  They would have been done  It was nothing  It was the middle of winter, wasn't it?  We're getting close to the one-year anniversary of that  Yeah, it was like January  It was January  Hi, Jimmy  Or is it two years now?  Did we already do the one-year?  Two years, two years, yeah  It's going to be two years  Wow  Two years  So it lost an engine  And the guy kind of just turned around and said, all right  And landed safely  And Leo was on there?  And then Leo DiCaprio walked off like it was no big deal  And the media's rolling with it now 
[00:03:30]  That we almost lost Leo  Almost lost  Yeah, look at Jimmy  Jimmy's  What?  We almost lost Leo  You all right with that?  Yeah  Is Tom Cruise mad and now he's going to like fly on the outside of a plane  Sure  Just to show up Leo  Sure  He's going to ride on the wing  Yeah, exactly  Because he's a crazy person  I had nightmares last night because of Tom Cruise  Did you?  Dude  Because of the buildings we showed and everything  Did you see the other video of him?  On the tippy top?  I've only seen the still  That's a photo  But the other video of him doing the stunts 
[00:04:00]  Oh, running?  Fuck running  He was like  He was repelling  There was one thing where he was  They would drop him down at one point  Probably like six floors  Oh, on a decelerator they call it  And then he has to  He's actually  They show a close up of him  Holding the building  And then leaping out  Oh, wow  Oh, one of those  And around  Oh, my fucking God  What's wrong with him?  What is he?  Dude, I was looking at  Scientology  Videos of that fucking building  After that Tom Cruise phone  I couldn't sleep 
[00:04:30]  I kept picturing that view  You're crazy  There are other people that have sat on those things  Oh, really?  This video of fucking three guys  Sitting on top of those  Belonging each other?  Yeah, that's a home video  Wow  This video of those three guys  Sitting on top of that  Of the light things  Yeah  Yeah  Cruise was sitting  They're facing in though  He was facing out  They're facing in  The thing that got me yesterday  Was when you said  Eventually you gotta come down  And then you gotta fumble around  With your feet  Yeah, yeah, your feet  To get something solid 
[00:05:00]  So you can start your descent  That's  That's what got me  That's creepy  The tower video that got me yesterday  Was the kids doing the pull-ups  That one  That was creepy  That one's just horrifying  The one where they walk out  On the girder or whatever  That's pretty bad too  But the guys doing the pull-ups  Holy shit  Because you know how easy  Your hands can slip  Get the fuck out of here  Right off of that round  Because it didn't look like  A thin chin-up bar  Right  It was like a big round pipe  And how do you get a grip on that? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah  It was just bad  It didn't look like  You could get a really good grip  No, no  Imagine you do that  And then you go for one more  And realize, holy shit  I can't pull myself back up  Yeah  And your friends aren't gonna help you  At that point  Yep  They're not attached to anything  They're not gonna say  Grab my arm like  No  What was that, cliffhanger?  They're just gonna watch you  Like, imagine the friends  Just watching his face  Go like  And then just falling away  Yeah, that's a cool  As he's looking up at you  That's a cool effect in movies  I just fucked up  But not in real life 
[00:06:00]  Horrifying in real life  Really cool if you're sitting in a movie  Yeah, yeah  It's like  Like Hans Gruber  Right  Hans Gruber  When he fell off  He fucking looks up  And he's like  With that half-frozen face  Like, ah, shit  So the Delta plane landed  Landed all right  And everyone's okay  Yeah  Yeah, that's  I mean, one engine goes out  Now  Are the engines so separate  That if one goes out  It's not gonna affect the second engine 
[00:06:30]  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah  Or is the wiring all  Kind of connected  Where if you lose one engine  It's scary  Because it certainly  Can make the other engine go too  Nah, I guess it all depends  On what the problem is  But I think they're pretty rude  But in most cases  I think it's pretty  So the odds of losing  Two fucking engines are  Yeah  Ridiculously  It's low  Low, yeah  What if I was  Is that  Delta  Delta  When?  Like, it was yesterday  But today  Last night they started teasing  That there was a big Hollywood star  On the plane  And then, you know  I couldn't stay up to find out who 
[00:07:00]  Because these assholes  Can't just tell you shit  Right  Everything has to be  The last 30 seconds of a newscast  Here's your weather  The sports scores  And Leo DiCaprio  Almost died on Delta  Where were they going from  Where to where?  I don't know  I don't know  International?  Because I heard about  Yeah, they were going to Moscow  Oh, they were  Oh, I did hear about that  What the fuck is Leo DiCaprio  Going to Moscow for?  He's gonna do some good shit  For somebody  Is that it?  Like a movie?  I think he's one of those  I do good shit things  In between movies  Oh, like a charitable  Something?  I think he's one of those guys  There's a bunch of them 
[00:07:30]  In Hollywood  In between movies  They just do good shit  Good shit  For society  They're good people  And for the world  Is he a good person?  He seems like a good person  Any scandal around him  Leo  Over the years  He's one of those  Scandalous guys  That everybody just kind of likes  That just bangs supermodels  Yeah, yeah, okay  One after another  That's amazing  He could be a perfect human being  What a guy  Makes good movies  Helps the world  And bangs supermodels  Yep  So  Hell of a life 
[00:08:00]  He's got there, huh?  We thought Tiger  Had a perfect life too  I'm telling you  No one gets away with it anymore  No one gets away with it  No one do we think is perfect  Gets away with it  It all catches up to you  In the long run  That Tiger thing  Is almost a year  Wow, really?  That's a quick year, huh?  That's a year  It was right around Thanksgiving  Wasn't it?  Yeah, I noticed  What happened?  I noticed  Another anniversary  Here in New York  My God  Hungerthon  Is being run 
[00:08:30]  On the CVS station  Do we have any of our audio  From the one time  We got to do Hungerthon?  Oh, do I wish we did  That was our introduction  To stalker Patty  She made cookies for us, right?  Yeah, she was the one that  She was like manning  The phones or something  She was a volunteer  For Hungerthon  And fell in love with us  And that's when  We first met Patty  Right  And they do it  Around Thanksgiving  And they're auctioning off  Like I heard 1010 Wins  Is auctioning off  Like you get to hang out 
[00:09:00]  With the guy  That does the traffic report  And he tells you  How he gets the traffic together  And then you go out  To lunch with him  Ew  Oh, goodness gracious  He must hate that  Oh, he's got to  And whoever wins it  Must hate it  Gives a shit  Dude, anybody interested  In traffic  Like, so what  Has it happened?  So, like  How do you know  How many cars  Are on the road  At that point?  To say that there's traffic  I mean, awkward pauses  There must be 
[00:09:30]  Oh  And that goes back  To the famous  Christmas party  Where Scott Herman  Was running  1010 Wins  Oh, yeah  And that made sense  And then he introduced us  To the whole room  All proudly  And I walked up  To the mic  And I go  Your traffic sucks  Traffic sucks  And they're all like  So serious  About every facet  Of their newscast  Right  They don't have  A radio station  If they're not  Doing traffic  And I basically said  What you're doing  Is a waste of time  Yeah  And then the  Like the big anchor 
[00:10:00]  I remember  We also totally  Blew off and dissed  Judy DeAngelis  I don't know who she is  I'm Judy DeAngelis  Oh, that one  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And because we were  So psyched about  The stock guy  That was doing  The Wall Street report  Right  Because we were all  Like into the stock market  Back then  Right  And we were like  Oh, you're that guy  And Judy DeAngelis  Is like  She just introduced  Herself to us  We could give a shit  And she's like  The, you know  Star  Maybe  Anchor  Maybe if she was  A hot blonde  With big boobies  We would have 
[00:10:30]  Right  Talked to you  Please  Yeah  Then they did  You're an old broad  Of broadcasting  No interest here  And then who else  I think  Who's the guy  That does the  Sunday morning show  Sunday morning  Oh, Charles Osgood  Charles Osgood  Is auctioning off  A day  A Sunday  Where you hang out  With Charles Osgood  And he shows you  How they put together  That Sunday morning show  And then  You get to go out  To lunch with  Charles Osgood  Oh, great 
[00:11:00]  Which has to be  A screaming boar fest  You know he's just  Fucking cutting gassers  You think  You get the privilege  Of smelling Charles Osgood's gasses  His scrambled eggs  Farts  Yeah  Oh, yeah  And also  The weather guy  You get to see  What about John Montone  I don't know  Maybe Montone's got  Like a thing  Where you get to go out  With him  Montone's got a little  TV action  Around the street  On what?  They give him a little  TV now  I don't know  I'm not sure  If it's local or not  On one of the news shows 
[00:11:30]  It's pretty much  His radio shit on TV  I shouldn't say it like that  Because I like John Montone  He's a good egg  You know he's just  You know  He's a wild one  Oh, he is wild  I can tell he's a wild one  Remember when they had  Some of his podcasts  And stuff they put up  Yeah  And he's cursing  Yeah  They're doing the  Hunger-Thon here at Sirius  No way  Sirius is doing  Hunger-Thon here as well  This show was not  Asked to participate  Of course  We participated one year  They asked us  Never to do it again 
[00:12:00]  And this goes back  To something we  Discussed from time to time  And it has to be  Brought up again  Because this is the  This is the charity  Part of the year  Right  This is at least  The second time  That they have told us  We don't want your  Free services  And we don't want  What you can do  For our charity  Yeah, we don't want  The money you can raise  Right  We just  We'd rather have  Hungry people  Than have  The likes of  The Opie and Anthony  Show help  We got this  O&A community  They get things done  Oh yeah  And if we are part  Of the Hunger-Thon  We're going to get  Things done 
[00:12:30]  And we're going to  Feed a lot of people  Just from our  Dumb little community  But they have decided  We're such scumbags  We don't want  To feed people  That priest guy  We don't want  To feed more people  He  That's in charge  Of the whole thing  What's his name  Father something  What about  What happened to forgiving  He wants  No  No  There's no forgiveness  For what we did  It was just a double  Dildo show  Double dong  Dildo show  With two hookers  Just fucking each other  They were actual hookers  Too  Yeah  I don't know why  We had hookers  In that day 
[00:13:00]  But we did  They were ass to ass  With a double dong  Dildo  Just fucking each other  And we were like  Hey come on in  And take a look at this  And it was like  The father  The priest guy  That runs  Hunger-Thon  Comes in  And he looks  And he was  Horrified  Horrified  Did he stay?  No  He fucking never  Talked to us again  And that was the last  We ever heard  From the Hunger-Thon  So now he would rather  That he doesn't feed  As many people  Than work  With me and aunt  And Jim Norton  Well it's all about him  That's why  It's all about him 
[00:13:30]  Yeah  And the same thing  Happened with our CD  In Boston  They didn't want to  Give the proceeds  To our CD  Which did incredibly well  To sick kids  They said no  We don't want your money  We don't want to  Help sick kids  With your money  Jimmy Fun said no  So it's safe to say  That a kid probably  Lost his life  Because they didn't  Want to deal with us  That's sick  The only people  That would take it  Were black  Disabled Vietnam veterans  That was it  Yeah  That was the big  Check got handed to them  The shwuggies  Yes  That fought for our country 
[00:14:00]  As Bruce Mittman  Put it so eloquently  That's when we learned  That word  Shwuggie  Those hookers  One was black  Right  Oh yeah  One was black  One was kind of white  Or Hispanic or something  They were ass to ass  I forgot they were  Ass to ass  Ass to ass  With that double  Dong dildo  And it's like  Hey check it out  On regular radio  By the way  Because the guy  Wasn't dressed  He was the cool  Like religious guy  Like the guy  That dresses in  Did we know he was a priest  I don't think we did 
[00:14:30]  In all fairness  I don't think we did  At the time  I think we didn't  Believe it or something  Or thought he was  One of those groovy  Like religious guys  Because he wasn't  Wearing the collar  Or anything  Yeah  And he came in  Like in a sweater  Or something  Right  The hip priest  Yeah the hip priest guy  The hipster  And ooh  That didn't work  No  No  No  Oh you see that too Jimmy  First thing I saw  This morning  Don't worry  If you look long enough  You'll see that  We're part of it  Are we on the little  The Russell Brand show 
[00:15:00]  Yeah  Well you know  When you're doing  A big huge advertising  For Sirius XM  You really should make sure  Russell Brand  A show that hasn't even  Fucking cracked the mic yet  On Sirius XM  Is almost front and center  Of course  We've been slaving away  For six years  They do have a tiny  Tiny opening Anthony logo  Have you seen it yet  Is that it  Jimmy's biting his lip  Oh I thought that was it  It was a piece of a pop tart  And then they get  Brush it off  Then they get mad at us  For getting mad  That's what I don't get  Look at Jimmy's face 
[00:15:30]  I'm just giving up  Where I don't even care  There's a big huge  Yeah I'm kind of  Literally  I don't get  I just laugh now  Yeah I don't  I just laugh  Because you know  If I brought it up  With the main guy  He would  He would  He would go  Well we  We made you part of this  Yeah  What are you looking at Jimmy  It's a two page pull out  In the New York paper today  I mean it is on the other side  Of the front page  And the other side  Obviously of the front sports page 
[00:16:00]  There's a huge picture  Of somebody that might not even  Be here in a month  Right  Like who the fuck knows  Right  We slave away at this thing  Year after year  And we got a  We got a tiny tiny logo  Did you see the logo yet  No why would I  You still can't see it right  There's nothing to see man  Because they would  They would tell us  Look man we gave you  You know part of the big  Advertising  Yeah  What bothers you the most on there  None of the guy people  Who they  Most of them should be there  I don't care 
[00:16:30]  Rosie who gives a fuck  Jamie Foxx at this point  Who gives a fuck  And Russell Brand  Has never done a radio show  For Sirius XM  And he gets more promotion  Than us  And he hasn't even  Cracked a mic yet  I know he's a big star  But that doesn't  The point is  Russell has in this ad  Gotten more  A bigger bump  Than this show has gotten  Ever  Ever  Since  Or at least since  The merger 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  Which is over two years now  Two and a half years I think  Something like that  The merger  It is what it is  It's merger  It's merger  It's disappointing right  I don't even care  Honestly  It's laughable at this point  It's like you want people  On the show to be  Like of course we're going to do our jobs  But  Oh yeah  We'll work hard until the end of this contract  I don't even fucking  And all bets are off  I so don't even like care  Yeah  About ads or promotion or whatever  We got our listeners  I care 
[00:17:30]  If we get more it'll be great  If we don't  I care because what it represents  Yeah  Yeah well  A lack of respect for the radio show  A lack of respect  You know  A lack of respect  I deserve respect  Rosie O'Donnell is not  Selling subscriptions  For this fucking company  Okay  I don't think so  We are  I don't think so  We're selling way more  Subscriptions for this company  Than fucking Rosie O'Donnell  I would  I would bet  A lot of money on that  You know  This  This channel is truly  The  The bastard

[00:18:30]  Is like the only  Fucking person  Who publicly promotes  This radio show  I love the fucking  Listeners who hate him  If you don't like his show  Because you don't think  It's funny  That's one thing  But I love the fucking  Venom that certain listeners  Hey fuckheads  He's the only one  Who promotes this  Fucking show  You assholes  Where's the  What do you mean the venom  Again  This fucking way  I love the people  That get mad  Because Leno  Decided to say  That we are the number one  Show on satellite radio

[00:19:30]  He's the only fucking guy  Who supports the show publicly  You dummies  We're not saying  You have to like his show  But you gotta respect  The fact that  You know when Jimmy  Goes on there  He doesn't have to say  ONA or Sirius XM  We're the number one show  On satellite radio  Which is embarrassing  Because you know  Obviously we're not  The number one show  On satellite radio  But it's hilarious  That he does that for us  I love it  And then you got  These listeners  That claim they're fans  Of the show  Beating the shit out of Leno  And again it's not about  You have to like somebody  Because they like us 
[00:20:00]  It's not about  You know what I'm saying  My favorite late night show  Jimmy Fallon  Really?  I'm getting more and more  Into Jimmy Fallon  You're digging the Fallon thing  Yeah he's  He's figured out his groove man  He's alright  Yeah  Absolutely  Figured out his niche  He's carved his little niche  More than a niche  I think he's  He's very comfortable  In that spot now  Yeah  Oh yeah  That's good  I watched Jimmy Fallon  Way more than I ever  Watched Conan  Yeah  You know  I liked the Conan  I liked the Conan bits

[00:21:00]  What they think of us  So whatever  I mean  You know  The last few months  Have been rough  To say the least  With this company  I really  It doesn't  It doesn't  Bug me in the least  Don't worry  They'll hire you  To do a political  Talk show  You'll be fine  I'll be fine  When this whole thing  Blows up  You'll be fine  Don't worry about it  You'll be just fine  I really just  Don't even care  About any ads  I know you were  Looking for a while  Our logo is in there  In the wall of logos  Behind the big  Fucking headliners  I don't even know  Who cares 
[00:21:30]  You got the big  Headliners  And most of those people  Of course Howard  Should be featured  And Martha Stewart  For the broads  Of course  Elvis of course  Pearl Jam Radio  Of course  But the ones that  Stick out is  Jamie Fox  Rosie O'Donnell  And Russell Brand  Who hasn't even  Done a show yet  But gets massive  Fucking publicity  Already  Of course it is  I mean  Of course it is  Because he's Hollywood  But I don't  If you're Hollywood  And you do a show  Or two  You know  Every once in a while  You get big  Big mentions  Is Eminem in there  Of course 
[00:22:00]  There's more justification  To have Vinny Brand  On this fucking thing  Eminem  He's been on the show  More  He's had more  Mike time  It's serious  Right  Eminem hasn't even  Fucking been in  These hallways  No  Since we've been here  Two and a half years  Eminem  He hasn't even been  In the building  In two and a half years  No  And I think he's done  About five total minutes  In the last year or so  On his channel  But you know  Let's make sure  The world knows  Eminem is sort of  Part of SiriusXM  Oh wait a minute 
[00:22:30]  I think we reached  Our quota  Of um  Yeah now we're  Getting in trouble  Oh you're bad  Mouth on the company  Again  Well we're fucking  You know  I guess we just think  We're bigger than  We really are  And we should  Shut the fuck up  And realize  We're just slaves  Yeah  We're the  We're the  We're the dog  That gets kicked  We're the little  Kicked dog  That keeps coming back  And licking your face  You want to hear  About pure lunacy though  If I walked us  Down the hall  And said  What's this about  He goes  What do you mean  You're right there  Oh okay 
[00:23:00]  Can I have a  Jeweler's loop  I need a  Jeweler's loop  So I can see it  But that's the  Lunacy of the whole thing  He actually sat us down  And said  You guys are going  To be part of  The SiriusXM  You know  Commercial  Yeah  And we figured out  What we were  We were on there  For a third of a second  And it was a  Two minute commercial  By the way  That's fine  Not a 30 second  If it was a 30 second  Commercial  And we were on  A third of a second  That's not bad  Yeah  We were on  A third of a second  For a two minute commercial  It's funny 
[00:23:30]  And he was expecting  A huge thank you  From us  That he did that  It is funny  And now he'll say  Well I didn't even  Have to do that  It just makes you  It's like  I kind of get the hint  And it kind of makes you  Like go  Like why would I want to  Not even out of anger  But like why would I  I just feel stupid  Like wanting to  Promote the show  I feel stupid  I feel dumb  Wanting to promote  The show  We're constantly  Rah rah ride  We really are  Dry skin  I got dry skin  Yeah 
[00:24:00]  I need  Where were we  The hunger thon  Why did you mention that  Oh cause they're  Giving away some  Stuff  Yeah they're giving away  Like you know  The usual crap  They're auctioning things off  But I was just  Gonna say it  It has been  Many years  And the thing  That it reminded me of  Was the first time  We met Stalker Patty  Cause she was working  Who happens to come in  Today  She's coming in today  Oh is she  I guess the theme  Of the first  40 minutes of the show  Here is that  We're just scumbags  All of us  Yeah  We got charities  That don't want to  Work with us  Fine  They'd rather have  People like  Go a little hungry 
[00:24:30]  During the holiday  Than actually get  Our money  And our contribution  That's insane  I don't know  Whatever  Well the  Koreans are at it again  See that shit  What's going on  Over there  North Korea  Loved some artillery  Shells onto a  South Korean island  Killed one of the  South Korean marines  Uh oh  Cause the South Koreans  Were having some kind  Of exercise  Uh oh  They were doing some  Kind of military exercise  And the North Koreans 
[00:25:00]  Who were just  Savage animals  They're just  Fucking  Communist robots  Of their  Stupid leader  Um  But can you explain  Something to me  Just lobbing shells  But how could you  Hate someone that  Looks like you  I'll never understand  That  Really  Yeah  No I'm serious  They  They just don't  Like each other  For what reason  Cause there's a line  Yeah  Between their  Places  And the people  Above the line  Don't like the people 
[00:25:30]  Below the line  It's all not government  It's a line  I know what the  Real answer is  They're the exact  Same people  It's pretty insane  They are  They're the exact  Same people  They eat the same  Fucking food  With an imaginary  Line  Across the  The 38th parallel  And they  They just  Hate each other  Yeah  You know  Who's guarding  The line  Stupid  Assholes  Americans  Yeah  Yeah  And here's  My father  When my father  Used to get mad  At the country  Cause you know  He's ex-military  He'd go  Yeah  Uncle Sap  He would always  Call Uncle Sam  Uncle Sap  Oh no he didn't  Uncle Sap 
[00:26:00]  And I really think  That we should  I thought that's  Like Uncle Paul  He'd leave a little  Sap on the  Youngster's back  Yeah  Here comes Uncle Sap  Climb the tree  Get some sap  On your lips  I don't know why  They don't  Like you know  We talk about  The economy  And needing money  How about this  How about all the money  That's being  Fucking wasted  On the DMZ  You pull  I don't want  One soldier  Or one dollar  Being fucking  Wasted  Between North 
[00:26:30]  And South Korea  I don't care  If they fucking  If they knife  Each other  This  This Korean  Situation  Is something  That back  In the 50s  And 60s  The Cold War  Sure  Obviously  That domino  Effect  That they  They talked about  They didn't want  One country  Falling  For the fear  That the next one  And the next one  And then we'd lose  Southeast Asia  To the communists  And that's why  We were there  There's no  Giant communist threat 
[00:27:00]  Anymore  It's just not there  China  Loves fucking  Capitalism  Oh do they  Fucking love  They do  Don't they  Oh yeah they do  They ate that shit  Up like rice  They love it  So you don't have to  Worry about them  Pouring over the border  They're too busy  Selling us shit  And buying up  All our shit  Here in this country  And devaluing our dollar  They're conquering us  From the inside  From the inside  They really are  They don't need an army  To just march to America  They're doing it  They know that  Economically 
[00:27:30]  They don't have to do that  And they know it  Yeah  So what is the big deal  About pulling everybody out  Like Jimmy said  Get Uncle Sap out of there  And let these two  Duke it out  Whoever the fuck wins  Has  Run in the country  It's not our problem  It ain't our country  Or our business  It ain't our problem anymore  It's not our country  Let South Korea  Fucking fight North Korea  Whoever wins  It's just called Korea  There's no need anymore  The Cold War  Is fucking over 
[00:28:00]  This armistice  Was made in the 50's  And they're still  Shooting at each other  And lobbing shells  And saying  You broke the armistice  They're still technically  At war by the way  They're still at war  There's just a ceasefire  That has been in place  For half a fucking century  They're animals  Fuck them  You know what  Fuck them  Let's kill each other  How sick do you have to be  To live near the border  Why don't you just  Tell your family luck  We gotta move  We're gonna move  A little further away  From this insane place  Do you know how they meet  When they have to meet  Oh yeah 
[00:28:30]  They have a building  That directly straddles the border  They both walk in  From their own side of the building  These fucking assholes  And they sit at a table  And half of the table  Is in North Korea  It's like a fucking  Like when you're children  You put tape down the room  And half of the table  Is in South Korea  You're right  That's what they do  Not hey come over  We'll talk  No  Just fuck them  If you can't sit down  Without having your shitty table  Split down the middle  How big is the demilitarized zone  The DMZ is what 
[00:29:00]  I don't know  Oh as far as how wide it is  Yeah  Yeah it's pretty fucking wide  Is it  Yeah especially in certain places  Like where the checkpoints are  And everything  Yeah  Yeah it's pretty fucking wide  You think they play like  Paper toss or paper football  You think they go back  On the table  Right  It's like hey  Just to loosen things up  Before they start talking  The guy makes the little goal  It's like hey  Here it is  He makes the goal  And you gotta  Hit it into communist  Korea  It's just  The whole world  Is insane 
[00:29:30]  We can't even understand  That type of  Blind  Hatred  That  They have for each other  And how  How for 50 fucking  Over 50 years  These two have just been  Going at it  Is that the table  It might be  I'm not sure  Yeah I think that  It looks like  It has to be  It's just how they're  Reaching over to shake  The other guy's hand  It looks like the room  I would pull one of the guys  Into our place  And go hey look  He's here  That could be a problem  We got him  We got him  It's so 
[00:30:00]  Fucking childish  It's childish  These assholes  All think they're actually  Doing the right thing  And staying in their countries  Yeah  Just stay in the room  You dickheads  So what is going to  Happen with this  I don't know  This is some of the  Biggest escalation  Between the two  Countries in quite a while  And this is coming  On the heels of  North Korea firing  That torpedo  At the South Korean ship  And sinking it  And killing a bunch of sailors  They've never done that  There's always been  This sporadic gunfire  Has South Korea fired at all 
[00:30:30]  Or no?  Yeah  South Korea fired back  At North Korea  Who's been starting  At North Korea?  Yeah  The South Koreans  Have had this exercise  Going on  Around this island  And North Koreans  Are saying they're violating  The water border  Part of the treaty  Or armistice  And they just started  Lobbing shells  Into what they called  Military targets  They said any civilians  That were killed  Or any damage done  To their homes  Were collateral damage  They were going for  Military targets  They killed a marine 
[00:31:00]  And uh  Oh this is South Korea  Did this?  No North Korea  Did this  And now South Korea  They fired back  At North Korea  So it's one of the  Biggest escalations  In quite some time  We don't have to send  Our boys over there  Do we?  We  Our guys are there  We have 14,000 people  I know we got guys there  But we're not gonna  Escalate the amount of troops  I can't see that happening  China  Stepped in and said  Knock the fuck off  North Korea listens to China  They're saying  You know  Calm the fuck down 
[00:31:30]  Obama  Kicked in and said  You know  Strong condemnation  Of North Korea  We stand by  Our South Korean allies  Blah de blah de blah  Fuck damn  But they're just gonna  They're gonna hash it out  They're trying to get  North Korea back  To the  Bargaining table  To knock off  Their shenanigans  They started  Enriching uranium again  They love pulling that one  Whenever they run out of money  Whenever they need  The American  The western ATM  Is what  I love to call it  The little ATM 
[00:32:00]  They start up their  Uranium project  We come in and go  Look  We'll give you a bunch of shit  Money and food and stuff  Just knock it off  Then they stop it for a while  They run out of money  And we give them more money  It's fucking blackmail  Instead of just basically  Taking that money  That we're giving to this shit country  And putting it in here  And taking care of our  You know  Healthcare is not great  Like the system  Maybe Obama has  But I guarantee  If we stop giving money  To fucking countries  Like those  Fucking  Leeches 
[00:32:30]  We could just  How about we take care of our own  It's so irritating  It is  Let them get nukes  I don't care  We have them  What are you gonna do  Attack us  Go fuck yourself  They're not gonna attack us  They're probably gonna blow themselves up  With the fucking thing  We'll attack South Korea  That's not my problem  Yeah yeah  I don't care  I really don't either  I don't care about South Korea  I don't give a fuck about South Korea  I don't care  If North Korea like won  If there was a war between the two  And North Korea won  And the whole country was communist  Good  Look how well North Korea is doing 
[00:33:00]  They are horrible  The country is  In shambles  The people are starving  There's no power  They have buildings that are incomplete  So  I've seen power  From that satellite photo  Oh from the satellite photo  Yeah  Right at the fucking  Royal Palace  That's it  The rest of the country  Is fucking dark  What an asshole  Oh that guy stinks  Kim Jong-il really isn't  Kim Jong-il and his dumb fat son now  He's enjoying his 63 inch  Fucking flat screen TV  While the rest of the country  Is in the dark  What an asshole  What a dick 
[00:33:30]  Alright well  Would you do a show in South Korea Jimmy  People are asking  South Korea for the military  I would do sure  Yeah  Right on man  Go down to Seoul  But there was  There was something recently  Where maybe it was a couple years ago  Where a lot of the students there  People wanted the US soldiers out  And it was like  Something happened with a soldier  In the South Korean citizen  I don't know the details  Somebody might know  I'm sure the listeners would know  Is it a rape?  I don't know  It might have been some shitty thing  But I really want the US soldiers out of there  We don't belong there  It's not our country  No 
[00:34:00]  And I really  Am sick and tired  Of the US policing  This whole  Dog shit planet  Since the 50s  We've had to fucking  Have people there  You know that's not going to change  Unfortunately  Since  We've been there since then  Dude  What is it  15 years before Vietnam  Yeah yeah  We don't belong there  Anymore  I don't even care if we're in Saudi Arabia  I don't care about the Middle East  And look what happened in Vietnam  By the way  We fucking leave  Yep  The North just overruns the South 
[00:34:30]  There were years of  Some you know  Massive killings  And retribution  And bullshit  And now  It's  We do business with them  It's a fucking tourist attraction  People go there  They fucking  It's  It's whatever happened  They're communist  But you know what  They're also part of that  Capitalist communist thing  Because there's no more  Soviet Union  To support these little countries  So they know  They gotta do business  With the rest of the world  With Korea 
[00:35:00]  You got these two fucking babies  Facing each other  And uh  They won't knock it the fuck off  It's infuriating  And all that  What bothers me  Is the first of all  The money  Our soldiers are being  Fucking stood there  Basically  What the US does  Is by having 14,000 US soldiers  You know how fast  The North Koreans  Could run over  14,000 US soldiers  With their army  Yeah  They don't do it  Because that would be  An active war  Against the United States  Right  And that's the  So basically  We have our fucking soldiers  They're like a trip wire 
[00:35:30]  Yeah  It's pretty much  To keep them out  Because if we did leave  They would attack  They would just march through  So our guys are there  Like a trip wire  Because they know  If they kill  A bunch of US soldiers  They have a major problem  With our military  Then we would have to  You know  Go in there  And bomb the fuck out of them  And it's so annoying  The money that we have to spend  Get the fuck out of here  Just bring  Let these guys stay here  And work in this economy  It's annoying  Come home  Yeah  Let them come home  Well there you go  There's a fucking big story  Yeah  Korea  Happening way over there 
[00:36:00]  It's developing too  A developing story by the way  So we'll keep you informed  Oh certainly  Of course  Of course  We tell it like it is here  We do  We read it right off  Of the Fox News channel  And then we just  Babble it right out to you  And then we give our opinions  It's no different  Than what they fucking know  Of course  You ever meet these guys  When they're not behind  A fucking TV camera  Michael Vick spoke out  About dog fighting  Is that what I just saw  Yeah I guess he's doing  Some PR  But he's got to keep  Everyone calm  Because he said  Go fuck yourself  I'm doing really well  No see it's  What he's basically doing 
[00:36:30]  Is like holy shit  I got a chance to be  The MVP of the NFL this year  So I got to like  Is that it  I got to soften it  Soften it around me  A little bit  Yeah  My stance on him  Has changed  Even though I hate him  Look the guy  He went to jail  It's like what can you say  He does have a right  To make a living  He did his time  Yeah man he went to jail  It's like  He did the crime  And he's doing the time  Derek Jeter negotiations  With the Yankees  Could turn ugly  Who cares  Enough of him  Tilling them  He's going to be in pinstripes  Just shut up  They offered him three years  45 million  Which is a bit of a cut for him 
[00:37:00]  Yeah  But was he 36 now  He's up there man  Yeah  Yeah  He wants a four year deal  Yeah  His skills aren't  I heard he's  I haven't really been watching  I heard he's not quite  The shortstop he was  Dude  I don't know  You know what though  He's still amazing  And I think just  As far as loyalty goes  The guy has been  Just an amazing part  Of that team  For years  You throw him the bone  These new Steinbrenners 
[00:37:30]  That are running  The fucking shit  Yeah  I don't know  Well his agent is using  What they've said  Against them  They've said  He's the Babe Ruth  Of this Yankees generation  So  Yeah  When you put a title  Like that on him  You know  Yeah then  He is an important part  I hate the guy  But like  He's a very important part  Morale  It would be the worst  PR move for the Yankees  If they let him go  Oh  Terrible  True  True dat  That's the only reason  They're even thinking about it  Yeah  If he didn't play his whole career 
[00:38:00]  With the Yankees  This wouldn't even be a  Yeah the guy cannot  They would let him move on  And try to get a better deal  Somewhere else  Can't be  That's the only reason  Why they're entertaining  This right now  He's the best shortstop  In the history of the organization  Yeah  The best  He simply is the best shortstop  I've ever had  They didn't have a lot of  Shortstops on the Yankees  Over the years  That's true  They're just like their third  Why don't we take a break  After the break  Charlie Sheehan's escort  Is talking out  Speaking of  What a fucking  Dumb bitch  This one is 
[00:38:30]  Well she's trying to  Capitalize and get a little  Fame out of this  Another one  Another whore  What does she file  A police report  And I'm sure she's  Looking for some money  Keep your mouth shut  Unless you're  Suck at it  So we'll get the audio of that  And Howie Rose  God bless him  Yeah  But he was caught on mic  He's the Islanders announcer  Whoopsie  Basically saying how bad  The team is  During a commercial break  I don't know how they got this  Oops  Maybe someone else in the booth  Was just recording him  Or something  Is he in trouble 
[00:39:00]  He had to apologize  I don't know why  He has to apologize  For saying that  The Islanders are a shitty team  For being honest  He didn't say shitty  But he might as well have  Have they played  Since they were 13  And  13 in a row  Lost  They play Wednesday  I gotta give my tickets away  For Wednesday's game  I don't know how to do it though  Everybody wants tickets  Everybody wants my tickets  Why?  I don't know why  Because  They seem to be  Islanders fans too  Wow  Why would you want to go see  A team that's 4 and  12 
[00:39:30]  Who are they playing  Maybe they want to see  That team  Who are they playing  I don't even know  Who they're playing Wednesday  I have given the fuck up  You really have  Yes  They just suck  I have one more thing  To do this year  Is to get that bag of shit  On the ice  It just becomes  You become very  Disillusioned  With your team  When they just suck  So bad that it's over  We're kind of talking  About it right now  So it's quick  Here's Howie Rose  During a commercial break  Someone picked up  His commentary  That wasn't supposed  To air  Anywhere  9.58 
[00:40:00]  Remaining  First period  Here at Phillips Arena  In Atlanta  No sprint training yet  Hey let me know  How this game turns out  Not that I particularly care  Oh shit  Not that I particularly care 
[00:40:30]  Oh man  He's being honest  And why does he have to  Apologize for that  He has to be  Raw Raw Islanders  Even when they're  The worst team in hockey  That's it  Why does he have to  Apologize  Fairweather fan  I would love an announcer  To be honest  Instead of always like  Bleeding the team colors  When you're watching them  Why can't the guy  Comment and go  Holy shit  This is a horrible year  For everybody  Then he'll do this  The Islanders getting  A late goal  In that second period  From Michael Grabner  During a four on four  And by the way 
[00:41:00]  I want to apologize  For something that went out  Over the air during the first period  Which was not supposed to go out  Over the air  It is all my fault  We were having technical difficulties  Down in the truck  And I said some unfortunate things  That were born completely  Out of frustration  With some confusion  That we were experiencing here  Of a technical nature  Shut up  If you've been watching  The Islanders lately  You know we have all been  In a rather frustrated mood  Over the last little while  Hopefully things will turn around  But as far as the  One little issue  Of some comments that I made  That were not designed  To go out on the air 
[00:41:30]  I apologize for them  And hopefully now  We'll just move on  Once again  People can't be honest  On TV  Especially in sports  He was in an apology flurry  A frenzy  A nation of worms  We're a country  Of fucking worms  Technical difficulties  You know the frustration  Down on the ice  He was flustered  He's a really good  Sports announcer too  Really good  And I respect him  For fucking talking honestly  But now I don't respect him  Because he had to apologize 
[00:42:00]  But he was forced to apologize  To keep his job  I'm sure  We're just weasels  We're just weasels  Do you doodle that  Right  Intern Stevie would like to  Contribute about the Islanders  He's been begging me  To come in  For what?

[00:42:30]  A minute  How he had to  Fucking apologize  Jimmy  It's  The whole country  Is just  And I'm not even  Knocking him for doing it  Because he knows  The climate he works in  I understand why he has to do it  But  We're just  We're just trained  That it's okay  To be a fucking weasel  You're supposed  To toe the company line  Like a little slime ball  That's what all of us  Are doing  The whole country  I would love to hear  More of that  I would love to hear  More of that  The fact is  He's announcing  A really shitty team  This year  Steve from Patriot  Just goes  Come in you blind shitbag  What is it

[00:48:00]  Oh the drip was  $6 million  God rest his soul  And the bikani man  Used to come  And deliver the bikani  Fresh  It was fresh  With dignity  People are all in  On the bit  Yeah  $10  For every  What  Huh  What did you say  Think he's gonna be  Wearing that bionic gear  Hope so  Oh god  Boop  Maybe Mars could do something  Like send  Send a signal to it  To make it  Fucking blow up 
[00:48:30]  That's him hearing  That's all he hears now  In his ear  It's tinnitus  How ironic  He's just trying to sleep  And all he's hearing  Is that sound  It's amazing  How recognizable  That sound is  Yeah  Yeah  That is one of the  More recognizable sounds  See that again  Please  Anyone in our age group  I mean that's  Yeah  Sure  You know  Chevy Chase and Caddyshack  Doing the whole  No no no no  Coofing on that sound 
[00:49:00]  Oh yeah  And he was married to Farrah  Right  Yes he was  He certainly was  Did he  He got that pussy and ass  When before it started  Rotting  Right  Jesus  Yes  Well it was rotting  Something started rotting  What's that  Jimmy  You lost Jimmy on that one  Did I  I don't know  Or he's just adjusting  Well you know  He got Farrah in her prime  Yeah  Are we allowed to talk about Farrah  I saw the big do's and don'ts  With Lee Majors  There's do's and don'ts 
[00:49:30]  You guys get the  You guys get the do's and don'ts  Uh oh  Which means it's all do's  Oh it's all do's  No we'll have  Don't talk about fucking  Jamie Summers  Ugh  I think I was in love with Jamie Summers  Because I didn't know any better  At the time  Were you  Yeah  What's her real name  Lindsay Wagner  Oh Lindsay Wagner  She's fucking hawking  Those inflatable beds  Really  Yeah the ones with the  Fucking number you know  What number are you  I'm a 29  I'm a fucking  Nothing worse than  Like a 
[00:50:00]  Like a  An icon  Yeah  A Hollywood icon  All of a sudden on TV  Doing some lame ass commercial  Hawking goods  Who's doing the mortgage one  I'm like that guy used to be  Fucking huge in the 80s  Now he's doing like  Mortgage commercials  There's a few of them  Starsky was doing one  For a while too  Starsky was  You're stuck on a treadmill  How to get off  Oh really  A treadmill  Yeah  Some kind of bullshit like that  Yeah  They all end up there  All your old heroes  From the  From the old shows  You watched growing up 
[00:50:30]  Oh Wagner  Isn't Wagner doing one  Robert Wagner  I think he's doing something  Robert Wagner's doing one  Yeah  I think  For like reverse mortgage  Or something  Yeah  There you go  What is that anyway  Is that like when  The people paid off  Their house  They're old  And then the bank  Just slowly starts  Taking their house back  And paying them money  Probably  And then like  They hope to die  Before they run out  Of equity in the house  Probably  That's what I'm thinking  That makes sense  It's like  Dude I  I used to work in the  I can't quite remember 
[00:51:00]  Because like we never did it  Because reverse mortgage  Yeah like you never  Like only really old people  Kind of do that stuff  But I think it's when  You don't  You're not planning on  Leaving your house to anybody  Right  And then you basically  Just you have the bank  It's like you take out  Like a second mortgage  But instead of getting  Like all that money  As like a line of credit  Yeah  You just slowly  Have the house  Pay you paychecks  Right right  And then when you  When you drop dead  The bank owns your house  Owns your fucking house  That's sad  But you don't have to worry  About bills and junk 
[00:51:30]  Yeah that's true  But you can't do it young  No  Or like you're all of a sudden  That's why all those commercials  Are for  Send your house anymore  You know like  You know if you're  Are you 60 or older  Yeah yeah  You're ready to drop dead  Get rid of your house  Alright we go to break  Yes  I gotta eat  I'm gonna play this  Bobo thing again  As we go to break here  And we'll continue  The Virus  Sirius XM  This is the Opin' Entry Show  Opin' Entry  Any tie-in' in this song? 
[00:52:00]  Any tie-in' in this song?  It just felt like playing it eh?  What a gang  Oh  Very good news Anthony  I don't know what this is tied into  It might be because 
[00:52:30]  Marley Cyrus is 18 today  Wow that fucking went quick  Boo  Boo  Sorry Uncle Paul  Sorry Uncle Paul  She's 18  An old lady  An old lady  Yeah  Why are you gonna celebrate that?

[00:53:00]  Yes  Steve Austin  Steve Austin  Steve Austin  Steve Austin  See if I kept it open  It would say  Steve Austin  Astronaut  A man barely alive  We can rebuild him  We have the technology  We can make him better than he was  Better  Better  Stronger  Stronger  Faster  Faster  Yeah  And then the music would start I guess  But I just wanna keep going  Where's the music?  Steve Austin 
[00:53:30]  Probably didn't get the rights  You know what?  Steve Austin  Steve Austin  Steve Austin  How about this?  Steve  Steve  Yes  Steve  Yes  Steve  Steve  Yes  Steve  Yes  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  Steve  And Sam it's not the wrestler  It's the other Steve Austin  Right right  So don't get excited  It's not Stone Cold  Steve Austin  No I see you got your Stone Cold t-shirt on and everything  You're very confused today  You thought it was Stone Cold coming in  Sorry  Sorry it's the six million dollar man 
[00:54:00]  We have another Steve in studio  Stevie is back  Yeah  Last we left you  And trust me we'll make this quick  We played Howie Rose from the New York Islanders having an honest moment  And then some asshole probably fucked him in the truck and said we gotta get this out there  Basically you know beating up on the Islanders a little bit and he should be  The team just fucking blows this year  Thanks  And Steve came running in and said look I got more to the story and what do you got Steve  He begged  Well I have the audio of the clip and you can hear his analyst talking with him under him 
[00:54:30]  I don't know if it's completely audible but you can kind of hear some of the stuff he's saying with him  I don't know what he  We can make him better  We couldn't have made him worse  So you handed in some audio  Yeah  So there's more to the story  So it looks like Blind Stevie did the right thing  Contributing to the show  And got more 
[00:55:00]  Thank you  Here it is  I know  I'm thinking this is strange  Oh yeah  Looks like we're trading it  Yes 
[00:55:30]  Hey let me know how this game turns out  Not that I particularly care  I know 
[00:56:00]  Could switching to Geico really save you 15% or more on current  Great cut  So Stevie  That was the audio that you came up with  Yeah  And it's different than the audio we played  Because you in your unbelievable wisdom decided it was great to just keep the dead air in  And the cough  I think there was some kind of clearing of the throat 
[00:56:30]  Yeah see our clip is the same as that clip  Only  Shorter  Shorter  And right to the point  Because  The dead air was taken out  See that's a radio lesson  Well let's ask Stevie  What's different about your clip than our clip?  Well I put  I left the beginning in  You can  I mean you can kind of hear  The start of the conversation  You can kind of hear the color analyst  Like talking with him  I don't know what  You know how that went  No you can't  No you can't 
[00:57:00]  Okay  No  That's like something that's being played on the big screen at the Coliseum it looks like  That wasn't the other guy  Well his mic was off  He was in the background because he was smart enough to put his mic off  What part?  The beginning  Alright here's the beginning  Tell me  Stop me when you hear the other  Yeah yeah please  I know  I'm thinking this is strange  He's laughing along with him in the background 
[00:57:30]  What?  That's right  Concrete proof  That the color analyst  Yeah  Was in the room  Yeah yeah  Yeah  That's not what I said  That's what the clip proves  Clip proves it though  No but he was laughing along with him  It kind of like sounds like he's laughing at him too  No it doesn't  It doesn't sound like any of that  You're just creating scenarios  Sounds like he's laughing at North Korea  Bombing sounds  Shut up 
[00:58:00]  Doesn't  And that was before Howie Rose even said anything bad  Right  Exactly  Right  You're an idiot Stevie  And he leaves in half a Geico commercial at the end  Enough with that guy  And it just cuts off so abruptly  It just cuts off  Not even an attempt at a smooth transition  That was the most ragged ass clip  You don't know about editing huh?  I did  I mean  No he said there was more to the clip  Yeah there was more to the clip  And he's going to find it 
[00:58:30]  So he found it  Half a Geico commercial  And a cough  And a cough  And a I know  Dead air  And an I know  And then this mysterious color analyst  Talking and agreeing in the background  And discussing fucking the  The fucking  I don't know  I was trying to come up with  A document of oldie days  Jefferson sounds like when George  The Magna Carta  The Bill of Rights  The Magna Carta  That's a good one too  They were discussing the Magna Carta  The Louisiana Purchase 
[00:59:00]  You heard him  You heard him talking in the background  Wow  About the Louisiana Purchase  Yes  Should I say it's like when George left his briefcase at the meeting?  Yeah  That's what it was like  Wow you're hilarious Danny  It's going deep  Actually it was funny  And it was Travis's line  It's funny  Yeah steal Travis's line  At least Travis's credit is low  I didn't steal it because I said it was Travis's line  I was giving him the credit for saying one  And we all laughed Steve  He said now you're making fun of us for laughing at a good Seinfeld line 
[00:59:30]  We all laughed  Just sit there and take the beating  You know why?  Because guys  Steve doesn't take any shit though  Real guys can listen to shit like lines from shows  TV shows and movies and shit  And laugh at them  Right  Because that's funny  Stevie doesn't take any shit though  No he doesn't  Yes he does  Oh damn  Danny just keeps throwing shit in his head  The same piece of paper keeps bouncing back to me  So I just keep throwing it back at him  You didn't like that he did that line Stevie?  What? 
[01:00:00]  No  I didn't say it  What you don't think Seinfeld lines are funny?  No I do think it's funny  It sounds like you want to defend yourself  I just didn't find  Look  I was trying to bring something else to the show  I think it was funny that it's like Seinfeld with the briefcase  And the abrupt ending  And you know  No I thought  Stevie heard a mysterious clunk  A clunk  You didn't like that he threw out the Seinfeld bar  You know  Just ganging out 
[01:00:30]  He's piggybacking on that  At least you know  Everyone else is being original  He didn't piggyback on anything Stevie  Piggybacking is totally different  Stop lying about every little thing that you encounter  How do I lie about every little thing?  You're pathological  You're lying  Pathological?  Yes you are  Do you even know what that means?  Oh  Do you?  Damn  I do  Alright what is it?  I know it's a false accusation  I want to see if you know what you're talking about  Stevie you lie every day about things  What have I lied about?  Uh oh  Let's see  You've lied about  Like little things like going to 
[01:01:00]  On a food run  What do you say?  You'll fuck up a food run and go  But I watched him  But I told the guy  And you're just lying  You didn't tell him anything  No that's bullshit  You're just making it up  You're mad  Oh shit  Do you see how  This is how disrespectful Stevie is  But like he's disrespectful like this  Off the air too  But he thinks it's like this fun game thing  Yeah  But it's not like  We've had to escort Stevie out  Like I've personally walked Stevie to the elevators once  Because I just  Get the fuck out  I just had to make sure that he left  The building 
[01:01:30]  Just get the fuck out right?  Right?  Is that it?  Are you serious right?  Yeah do you remember that?  Yeah I don't know what  You know  Oh  Shit  Everyone  Everyone  You know  Danny if you want to be like this  You know  Be like what?  Be like this  But you know  What is he being like?  I'm confused  He's being a  He's a prima donna  About everything  Oh yeah  Look at him  Do you remember  He's such a prima donna  So hang on  So Travis  So Travis had a funny Seinfeld line 
[01:02:00]  That I said  And I'm a prima donna for that  How does that work?  I'm not talking about  We're done with Seinfeld  Why are we still doing Seinfeld?  Oh man  I thought we're still out of here  Because I don't seem to understand  We're done talking about Seinfeld  Now I'm talking about you  And being a prima donna  How am I a prima donna?  Because you cried about  Oh someone melted my cheese  And put tomatoes on a sandwich  You can take that stuff off  No it's not  It's not about  What happens to my sandwich Stevie  It's about how you can't  Get anything right  No because that's what  That's the whole thing started from  You can't get anything right  You cried about me  About melted cheese and tomatoes 
[01:02:30]  On a sandwich  Stevie how about  You can't get anything right  You can't get anything right  It's not about that Stevie  It's about you fucking up  Everything that you do  The point is that  You can't get simple things correct  It's not the point  It's not the point  That my sandwich is fucked up  It's the point that  You can't get anything right  Time and time again  You cannot get anything correct  You're getting awfully defensive  So Stevie  No I'm telling you  I'm telling you why  I hate your fucking guts  Stevie your logic is  Everyone here hates your guts  Your logic is  When you fuck up  And somebody calls you out on it 
[01:03:00]  You're like  Wow you could fix my  Fuck up  So you're a prima donna  Yeah exactly  I'm not saying  He fucks up  You get mad  He fucks up  And you're a prima donna  I'm not saying  I didn't fuck up  I'm admitting I fucked up  But you don't have to  Make a big deal out of it  I told you I fucked up  Have you done anything correct  Yeah I have done things correct  You can't even get  A breakfast order correct  Do you understand  How fucking useless  You are here  Do you understand  That you will never get  Any kind of responsibility here  Because you can't even  Figure out  How to get a fucking  Breakfast sandwich  Do you understand that  Do you understand that Stevie  Stevie  Every fucking day 
[01:03:30]  You fuck up  You sit in the back office  And you read your fucking  Islanders book for four hours a day  Because no one will give you  Anything to do  Because they know  That you're just gonna  Fuck it up  You know what Danny  You know I could  You know I could have  Fucked up the huge  KFC order  Which caused you know  Roland  Very nice of him  To get you know  One hundred and twenty two  Dollars with a KFC  That was very nice of Roland  And you know Roland  Had to type out the order  And print it out  And give it to you  Because he didn't  Fuck it up  What is this big  I wouldn't have  Fucked it up anyway  What's going on  Long story short  Hang on  Long story short  With that  Roland 
[01:04:00]  Roland's in the back office  Right  Roland's in the office  And I just very  Not sure  I just go  Hey Roland  I was goofing around  I was like  You know you've been here  For like two whole weeks  You haven't bought  Anyone lunch  And he goes  Yeah I'll get everybody  That's why we want KFC  And he bought everybody  Hundreds of dollars  Like hundreds of dollars  It was over a hundred dollars  Worth of KFC  That's very funny  How many KFC  How many was  Stevie just shoving  In his face  Fucking Stevie  Oh  Not only  Not only got his own food  Because it's like  One of those shitty combo  Like KFC Pizza Hut things 
[01:04:30]  So not only got  His own Pizza Hut  But then tagged on  To Roland's  On buying everyone lunch  Oh I got a small  Little thing  Roland's like you know  Get yourself a little  Big thing too  Not only did he tag on  But then he decided  He didn't want to eat it  So he spent Roland's money  And then was like  Meh  I don't need it  Well you guys were hungry  Yeah  I got Pizza Hut  And I got you know  A little KFC  What was it  Fine  Double stack  Double down  And pizza  And breadsticks  Oh yeah  But the Santa threw out  The breadsticks  And then you took them 
[01:05:00]  Out of the trash  And ate them again  This fucking guy  Oh no  There's video  I forget which intern has it  But there's video  Of Stevie  Stevie spilt  Ope your cereal  In the office  And the way that he cleaned this up  Was not you know  By brushing it onto something  And throwing it away  Stevie picked up like  Individual pieces of cereal  And ate them  Off the floor  Off the floor  To clean up  Stevie  Stevie comment  And it wasn't a bit  He didn't even know  Anybody was watching  Yes I did  How do you know  How do you know that  Comment  Comment  Oh yeah 
[01:05:30]  Were you there  Were you there  Comment  You don't even know  How the whole thing went down  Stevie makes me so mad  I would love to smack  This game  Oh shit  Stevie just  Right here  Just not return  Like I'm right here  I'm right here  I'm right here  Pulled his headphones  I know  I know where you are  Stevie don't play  Stevie don't play  I know where you are  Stevie you almost weigh 200 pounds  Oh man  I know where you are  Damn  Damn  Stevie I guess  There's a problem  With you and Danny  I didn't realize this  I don't know why  Danny ate me so much  Look at him 
[01:06:00]  He's a prima donna  Oh man  He can't stop  Bitching about me  Stevie knows that  You bitch about  The littlest things  Why don't you get over it  Already  It was two weeks ago  That's okay  I'm bitching about  Your utter incompetence  Incompetence  On this program  You have no value  To this show  You add nothing to this show  Except for your retardation  We keep you around  We keep you around  Because you're retarded  Do you understand that  You're wrong  Do you understand that  Danny I have contributed  Things to this show  I've done a lot  I've done plenty  But you don't want to  You don't want to 
[01:06:30]  Accept that  You don't want to  Accept that  I'm listening to you  Stevie  Give me one thing  That you've done here  I'm done  I accept my piece  You just don't want  To accept it  I just hear words  Coming out of your mouth  I don't hear anything  Because you don't  Hear people when they're right  You don't hear people  When you have nothing else to say  This is getting retarded  Because you're just talking  Getting retarded  Because I'm involved  Because I'm a retard  Is that it  I'm a retard  I'm a retard  Danny right  You don't hear people  When they're right  How about you  Let's beat the whole retard  And look up  For two seconds  What are you going to do  You won't give any kind of 
[01:07:00]  Substance to your claims  You're just saying  Oh I do all these things  Then I go  Well what are they  And you just go  Hey you're a prima donna  What you got there  I'm contributing night  Right now  You moronic bitch  What is this  What are we doing right now  Try coming up with something  That Sam didn't write  On a piece of paper  I was going to say that  Anyway  You moron  Let's go  Let's go  Stevie I'm not going to hit you  You can tell papers at me 
[01:07:30]  But you can't take it  Is that how hard  Oh throw a plastic knife  When I was real original  Can't throw a plastic knife  Stevie's very excited  And I think you hit Jimmy too  I'm sorry  He knows that nothing will happen  From this  Right right  He's like  Right now he's got like  Force field on  So he knows he can do  Anything he wants  Because you can't  Danny knows  You can't punch people  In the workplace  Yeah you can't do that  It's cute Stevie  So when you throw your headphones  Off like a tough guy  And put your hands up Stevie  We've never  Here's how retarded  You are Stevie  I'm retarded  We've never had an intern 
[01:08:00]  That was so bad  That we said  This kid  He can't do anything  But he has some kind of value  On the air  So Stevie  For your next internship  Round here  You're only allowed to be here  For show hours  You're not allowed to be here  If the show isn't live on the air  Do you understand that?  That's never happened  For any intern ever  As big of fuck ups  As we've had in here  We've had a lot of fuck ups  But we've never had to make  Special circumstance  Because you are just  Completely unruly  You could be the worst  You are the worst  You can't do anything 
[01:08:30]  I'm the worst  I suck  I'm a complete failure  Yes that is true  And I will try to have sex  With your sister  Definitely  Oh man  That would be good  Oh yeah  Because my sister really  You know  Accepted your friend request  On Facebook and all that  Because she's totally not  She's not freaked out  By you at all  Freaked out?  She did  She's scared of you  She's like  Who is this freak?  Oh man  Oh no  Maybe she meant you  Keep going  What else?  That's it  You're a freak  Imagine Danny 
[01:09:00]  Just fucking your sister  You're nitpicking  On little things  That are in the past  I'm nitpicking  Your  Your ability  At your job here  Okay  Which  I have done more  Than you're saying  That I've done  I've done plenty  Stevie do you understand  I have contributed  Let me clue you  Just because you have a job  And all that  You think that you're so great  You know  You were once an intern too  You know  Yeah I know  Yeah  Yes and you know what  I did my job really well  And that's why I'm fucking still around  Yeah well you know  I'm trying just as hard as you did  Not everyone's going to be 
[01:09:30]  No you're not  Because I didn't fuck up  I didn't fuck anything up  Stevie  You know why  Because if I fucked up  As much as you did  Hindsight is 20-20  I wouldn't have any responsibility  Okay  Nothing for you is 20-20  Stevie Stevie  For you hindsight  Hindsight is like 80-80  At least  I know  And I'm not ashamed  To admit that  That's fine  Yeah  That's fun  Whatever  Do you understand  That you were hired  Based on how terrible you are  Like you came in  For the interview  And people said  Holy shit  This kid's fucking stupid  Sam  Is that true Sam  Sam  Sam 
[01:10:00]  Comment  No not even close  Why was he hired then  Strong resume  And good interview  Right  Strong resume  He's got good interviewing skills  What are some jobs  That you've held  Prior to this internship  Stevie  Some jobs you've held  Well  I worked at a  Well it wasn't like  A telemarketing place  It was similar to that though  It was like  What do you mean  Then what was it  That's communications right there  Why does everyone get so mad  By Stevie  That's something we look for  Why is there such  I'll tell you  I don't know why  If you really want the truth  I'll tell you what it is 
[01:10:30]  See Stevie  I think it's  Stevie gets coddled  By  There's this whole  Good cop bad cop thing  That happens  Like you yell at Stevie  You yell at Stevie  And then Sam goes  It's okay Stevie  It's okay  And pets his head  And gives him a little  Shoulder massage  And goes  It's okay  It's okay  Come back tomorrow  Good for you Sam  Sam's trying to bring people up  Sam is basically  He's the intern whisperer  But in reverse  He does all the shit  That you're not supposed to do  Because it just breeds bad behavior  So he just does all of those things 
[01:11:00]  Sam is following  In the footsteps of Martin Luther King  Sam's the only one  That's helped me out  Stevie worships Sam  Well he should  The ground that he walks on  He's like MLK  He's the only one  That you ask Stevie  If you ask Stevie  Sam is the only one here  Who gets paid  I didn't know  You all get paid  You say the only one here  Sam's the only one  That helps me out  In the office  Sam's the only one  That doesn't spend the entire day  Shitting on me  Oh  All I do is get shit on  Stevie  I don't do everything wrong  Yes you do  I make mistakes  And I admit that I make mistakes  You know why you don't do anything wrong anymore 
[01:11:30]  Because you're not allowed to do anything  No one gives you anything  Well it's not my choice  You guys are being dickheads  You're not giving me anything to do  But you can't get anything right  You don't  No I  Yes I can  You don't realize that  You're in here  It's because you did something wrong  Because you suck  No no no no no no  You're in here because you suck a dick  In here because I suck a dick  Yes  That is wrong  Oh my god  That is correct  You're in this room  Because of your terribleness  I can't believe you're getting so mad about me  Danny  You are 
[01:12:00]  You're yelling  Look at you  And then you're smiling  And cover it up  Whoa  You're like this kid's good  He's ready to pop a vein  And he goes  Oh no no it's okay though  Why do you get mad though  Because I forget Stevie's even part of the show  Until the next time I see him  And I go  Oh yeah Stevie  Because you leave at 9.59  And you don't have to deal with them anymore  I'll be around until the end of the day  And I have to deal with him  Because he doesn't deal with me  You tell him to leave  And he doesn't  And then fucking Sam goes  Go Stevie Stevie  He wants to soak in everything this internship has to offer right 
[01:12:30]  Yeah I mean this internship is not you know a 6 to 11 thing  There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes  And a lot of elements that go into making a show that Stevie needs to be a part of  Stevie do you realize you do fuck a lot of things up  Yeah but I'll admit that  I make mistakes and I'm here to learn  You can't just admit it and then it goes away  You fuck a lot of shit up  But the things that I've fucked up I haven't fucked up since I fucked them up the first time  Because no one gives you that responsibility anymore  If they don't want to do it  If you crash a car 
[01:13:00]  And then no one lets you drive anymore  I can't drive  You can't think  Well it's an example  You crash a car  And then no one lets you drive a car anymore  You can't say  Well I haven't crashed a car  Because no one lets you drive it anymore  So when you fuck something up  And no one lets you do it anymore  You can't then say  I haven't fucked that up  You know how many people have killed people from DWI cars  What is he being a prima donna?  What is he?  No, no  Is he being a little prima donna  I like Anthony  I don't like you 
[01:13:30]  Oh man  Home run  Come on give him all the shit  No  Why don't you give him all the shit that you've just given me  No, he's giving me  Cause you know what he's doing?  He's giving me constructive criticism  All you do is shit on me  Because you're a lost cause  Big fucking deal  You're a lost cause  Cause you don't listen  You don't listen  So you don't have to do your job?  That's it?  You don't have to help the interns out?  I'm your fucking boss  I'm your boss, Stevie  Yeah, so act like it  Act like a fucking professional  You don't  Stevie, I've taken you to the side  And I've spoken to you like an adult  And I sat you down 
[01:14:00]  And I said, Stevie, look  You really gotta try harder at this  Like an adult  You talk down to me like I'm some fucking dog  I can't do shit  Instead of lying again  How am I lying?  How am I lying?  Because  If you'd shut up  Let me talk  Do you remember last week  I brought you into the office  And I sat you down  And I had a real person talk with you  I had a real  You had a big boy talk  It lasted for two seconds  And he talked down to me like a dog  And I just shit his carpet  And then hey, you were like rubbing my nose in it  Well, that's how you stop a dog from shitting on the rug  Okay, well, that's not a man-to-man talk 
[01:14:30]  If you're gonna tell me you had a man-to-man talk  But you're lying, Stevie  Because that's not what happened  I know what happened  I was there  I know what happened  If we had a man-to-man talk  I would have known  I would have respected you for it  I have no respect for you anymore  You have no respect for anyone here  Except for Sam  You have no respect for anybody here  No, I have no respect for you  Because you shit on me  He doesn't have guts  He just knows that there'll be nothing  Nothing will ever happen  Because of this  Nothing will ever, ever happen  Oh, man  Danny, why do you hate me so much?  Because you're bad at your job  And you shouldn't be here  You're wasting your time here  Okay, that's an opinion  And there's somebody in college 
[01:15:00]  That actually wants to get credit for this internship  And they're not getting it  Because your dumb ass is sitting here  Fucking up food orders all day  Why don't you base something on facts  Before you just throw all your opinions out there  I'm not basing anything on facts  It's an opinion  Your opinion is that you hate me  We've gotten that already  No, it's not an opinion, Stevie  It is a fact that you suck at every task that you're given  You cannot complete any task  You said that already  Will you say something else now?  No, because that's the issue  I know that you hate me  That's what we're talking about  That's the conversation here  I know that I have messed things up in the past  The conversation is about you 
[01:15:30]  Stop talking about how bad Stevie is at his job  Let's talk about something else  Yeah, yeah  He's saying the same shit over and over again  Sam, is Stevie bad at his job?  What does he do good?  He had a rough start  But I'd say he's been improving steadily  Oh, God  Good for you, Stevie  Thank you, Sam  I appreciate that  You're going to get about a B on your internship at this point  Well, you know  Sam is the only one that has been giving me help  And constructive criticism  And has walked me through this the way  He's been great 
[01:16:00]  When he makes you kiss his fucking converse  That's when he's been great  No, I asked for him, too  That wasn't awful, sorry  That wasn't forceful  Stevie, do you have any concept of sarcasm?  Of course  No, wait, no  Go on, see?  Go on  Who knows?  So  So all this  See the fist  You just bumped fist  I love that he just  Pounded it out  Oh, yeah  I love it 
[01:16:30]  See, you just pounded it out  You did a little fist bump there  With Sam  Do you realize Sam put his fist up  Goofing on you?  Do you realize your hero, Sam  Goofs on you incessantly  And he's very sarcastic whenever he gives you praise  He  Is one of the worst people in here  Sam is the  Epitome of evil in this place  Do you know what's going to happen  The day that a lightbulb goes off in Stevie's head  And he realizes  Sam has been worse than anyone here 
[01:17:00]  Yes  It won't  It's not going to happen  Sam can punch this kid in the dick all day long  And then he'll get mad at me  And then I'll laugh  Because it's doubled over in pain  And he'll go  No, I'm not doing anything for you  And he'll point to me  And I'm like, Stevie  I'm not the one that punched you in the dick  Five times in a row  Right  I mean, I treat your testicles like a speed bag  When did I say that?  Yeah, answer that  When did I say that?  Stop, stop acting like an idiot  Acting like an idiot?  I got kicked in the nuts yesterday  And you guys did nothing about it  What? 
[01:17:30]  Are you supposed to do  Very forcefully  I didn't want to bring this up on air  But you guys are giving me so much shit  I got kicked in the nuts yesterday  What do you mean you got kicked in the nuts?  Freaking Travis yesterday  Rear back kicked me in the nuts  No, that was an accident  I was walking  And I knocked it  I don't know what happened  That was an accident  How is that ever an accident?  Yeah  How do you accidentally kick Stevie in the nuts?  How is that ever an accident?  We were practicing our whole, you know  Christmas show spectacular  Yeah, sure you were  Travis was showing me Monty Python  The Ministry of Silly Walks  Oh, right 
[01:18:00]  And Stevie happened to be in the way  Oh, he was in the way  Wow, that hurt  I was off to the side in the way  And this is called work to the rest of the day  When you do the Ministry of Silly Walks  This is because fucking Sam  He can't keep him out of the fucking office  Because it has to be a carnival in the office until 2 o'clock  Oh, I'm sorry  Sam was teaching me things  And I was actually getting stuff done with Sam  I'm like, you guys  You don't get anything done ever  You were watching a movie  The only thing I've ever seen you get done  Is you've eaten about eight fucking double cheeseburgers  From a guy's in a row  And I have the video  I have my video on my phone  While Sam was doing work for Audible 
[01:18:30]  You were watching a movie  And Sam was getting more worked on than you were  That's not Trump any time?  Of course it would  What movie was I watching?  You just said you were watching a movie  That's a lie, Stevie  You're just lying on the air now  You're just flat out  But I'm a liar  You just admitted it, but I'm a liar  When did I admit anything?  I said I was never watching a movie  Stevie, congrats  They're obsessed with you  They really are  They're obsessed with you  If you guys hate me so much  You must be that damn good  You know, hate is one of the most sincere forms of flattery  Yeah, that's kind of answer for everything this time  Hitler really was flattering the Jews 
[01:19:00]  What are you talking about?  Hate is the sincerest form of flattery?  Would Sam lie to you?  Sam's, you know what?  You all give me shit  Sam has given me shit  But at least Sam  Why are we moving on from him getting kicked in the balls, by the way?  Yeah  I know, I don't just  How did that happen that you accidentally kicked Stevie in the ball?  It was just an accident  It just happened  I didn't mean it  And I apologized to Stevie  How do you do that?  You didn't apologize to me  I was curled over and ping  You're like, oh, I didn't hurt at all  I said, I'm sorry  You didn't say you were sorry  You're like, oh, come on  It wasn't that bad  I had to go home on the train 
[01:19:30]  Frickin' my nuts were fucking out  You didn't discolored  You didn't discolour the train  Yes  Oh  L-I-R-R  Oh  He's not that  Long Island retard  Rels  Oh, man  Yeah, why don't you get on the subway, you fucking tough guy?  Yeah, why don't you get on the subway?  Go on the fucking six train  I still, I want to know why I was kicked in the nuts  Why can't you get on the subway?  I don't know, Evie  Don't ask me  I apologize  He apologized, it's done  When did you apologize?  Why can't you go on the subway?  Why was it  Why can't you go on the subway? 
[01:20:00]  Why can't you go on the subway?  I want to know why I have  Why can't you go on the subway?  Why can't you go on the subway?  I can go on the subway  I can go on the subway  No, you can't  No, you can't  Now you're lying again  You're lying  I'm allowed to go  I'm my own, man  I'm not  Look, just because my mom said something  Go on it  Right now  Why can't you go on the subway?  No, because that way  You guys want to get rid of me  I'm not going to let you off that easy  Because you're a pussy  You're a faggot  and you're afraid to go on the fucking sideboard.  Then why don't you do something  if you're so much of a pussy.  That's not the way this works, Stevie.  That's not how professional people work.  Oh, you're going to talk to me about professionalism? 
[01:20:30]  You're one of the least professional people I've ever met  and you're going to talk to me about professionalism.  Stevie, I've seen you.  Yesterday you showed up and you read a book all day.  I wasn't all day.  I did play shit.  That was in between.  He didn't read a book all day.  He also got kicked in the nuts.  This fucking kid lies so hard.  Jesus.  Lies so hard.  During show hours, right,  we looked at his Facebook  and Stevie posted an Islanders video  like 8 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, nice, Stevie.  Stevie, what are you doing?  You working for the show  or are you posting an Islanders video?  I was on there for...  Shut up!  He asked him a question! 
[01:21:00]  He then goes,  I posted it as a mistake.  I posted it as a mistake.  Stevie?  Stevie, comment.  Stevie.  Stevie, comment.  He's fucking...  That's slander.  That's fucking ridiculous.  Slander?  Oh, man.  I was on there for two seconds.  Are you a lawyer now?  You're a lawyer?  I was on there for two seconds  and I told you I was on there  so what the fuck is the problem?  Stevie's contribution to the program yesterday  during his internship duties yesterday  was...  He sat in the office,  he read an Islanders book  and then posted an Islanders video  on the Islanders video.  Doing the FU lines 
[01:21:30]  and taking care of all the other things  that I put on TV.  You didn't do anything.  Are you sure?  You didn't do anything yesterday.  Yeah.  Did you pay attention  because I did plenty of things yesterday.  What did you do yesterday?  I did plenty of things yesterday.  Why?  If there's so plenty,  just pick one.  What'd you do?  I did the FU lines for Derek.  I did.  When he says that,  just so people know out there  what that means  is that he opened a folder up  and hit right-click save as  a couple of times.  Yeah, but if I don't do it,  I'm the only one who does it though  because they all leave it to me  because I do it.  Because it's so unfuckable.  That's very fast.  Okay, well I still did it  and I did... 
[01:22:00]  Sam, what else?  Where's Sam?  You didn't ask Sam what you did.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, because Sam's the only one here  that'll vouch for me.  Sam's the only one that...  What else did you do?  Sam, what else did he do yesterday?  What else did you do?  Sam's fair.  Sam is very fair.  What else did you do, Stevie?  I put...  The voice of reason.  Don't fucking bring it...  If you bring up the FU line again,  I swear to fuck.  We did that.  What did you do?  I did...  I put some...  I wrote out some stuff  for none that they needed.  What stuff?  I don't know.  I can't even remember at this point.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:22:30]  This kid was here for 10 hours.  He got kicked in the fucking ball.  He was here for 10 hours.  It would affect your fucking memory.  I watched Danny...  Not Danny.  Sam was teaching me audibles.  He was teaching me how to do...  And Travis was teaching you  how to take a kick to the nuts.  Yeah, which hurt really...  I'm obsessed with that part of this.  It hurt like hell, Opie.  Why are you getting kicked in the nuts?  That's fantastic.  And they've done it a lot,  but this is the first time  he did it really hard.  Like, it was really hard.  It was a mistake, Steve.  A mistake?  And I apologize.  You kicked me in the nuts  on accident, eh?  It was like when you posted  the Islander video. 
[01:23:00]  It was a mistake.  I didn't say that.  I admitted that I was on,  but I was only on for five minutes,  and he's making a big shit deal  out of this.  A big shit deal?  A big shit deal.  Wow.  Watch out for the...  Why was I kicked in the nuts, Travis?  Why did you really do that?  How many times do I have to tell you  it was a fucking accident?  That's bullshit,  and you know it.  See how he...  And this is him.  This isn't on the air.  But no one is explaining  why it's an accident.  How does someone  accidentally get kicked  in the balls?  Because I was trying to  just get him out of the office,  and I was motioning my foot, 
[01:23:30]  and it fucking hit him  in the nuts,  and I apologized,  and that's it, Steve.  And let's fucking drop it.  What?  That wouldn't hold up in court.  What is wrong with you?  You're supposed to be  running an internship program,  not kicking people in the nuts.  And, Steve,  you're supposed to actually  be doing things that are...  Oh, damn.  I would have been doing things  if I wasn't curled over  in paint with my nuts in my hand.  My nuts in my hand.  This isn't going to help  the internship program.  You actually have to do  intern things.  Potential interns are going to  think they've got to get  kicked in the nuts to be here.  You wrote things  you don't know what they were? 
[01:24:00]  Why?  It was yesterday.  What do you got?  I mean, you stole Derek's  credit card last week.  You weren't talking about that?  I didn't steal it.  He has it now.  I gave it back to him.  After a week and a half, sure.  I never took it out of this...  There's a misunderstanding.  We went over that.  I never took it out of this building.  So glad that you're going to  return with us for another semester.  Really?  Shut up, Danny.  I know you're so full of shit.  Do you realize  that is your superior right there?  I know, but I'm...  Being insubordinate.  I'm tired of him  just shitting on me,  and then he just...  I'm tired of you  fucking everything up.  I don't fuck everything up. 
[01:24:30]  Yes, you do.  I make mistakes.  You're terrible.  But that's why I'm here.  I'm here to learn.  And instead of being helpful  and teaching me,  you just fucking...  Oh, you suck,  and you don't do this right,  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, because when you can't  get coffee right  like a thousand times, man...  I've gotten coffee right  plenty of times.  What?  Plenty of times.  That's how internships work.  Danny, you're really reaching now.  You're really reaching.  You're right, I am.  I'm reaching.  No, because you're just  making shit up  so it makes me look  even worse than I actually am.  No, you're bad.  You're terrible.  You're reaching  for another cheeseburger.  I enjoy my food.  You're reaching for another 
[01:25:00]  fucking piece of cereal  that you're going to eat up  off the carpet.  Oh, yeah, piggyback  on Anthony's joke  because I'm fat, right?  Ooh.  Oh, shit.  He's a kid with the best.  I'm just saying facts  that happened.  Okay, well,  we talked about that already, too.  Again, you're repeating  conversations we've already had.  I don't call it piggyback.  I call it Stevie back.  And it, and it, and it.  No.  Come on, yell at him  for making fat jokes.  Come on, do it.  Come on, he just made a fat joke.  He's funny when he makes  the fat jokes.  He's just an idiot.  Oh, man.  You're such a quandary.  He's a little weasel. 
[01:25:30]  He's a real weasel.  He's a real weasel.  I'm a weasel.  I'm a weasel, Danny.  You're a big time weasel.  It is good.  If I'm a little weasel  and you don't even,  why do you spend so much time  talking about me?  I don't.  I try to make you leave.  I try to escort you down the river.  You're really trying  to get rid of me right now,  right, Danny?  You really want me to get...  We got until May?  May.  Fucking rules.  All right.  I don't know why  everyone's so fucking mad.  Everyone gets very angry  with you, Stevie.  Look, I'm sorry  that I make everyone so angry, 
[01:26:00]  but I'm not trying to.  They just get angry at me.  Why do you think that is?  I'll tell you exactly why it is,  because we've had a lot  of big-time retards in here.  Oh, I remember.  And we've had, you know,  even guys like Bobo  and David and stuff,  and, like, it's fun  and you can play  and everything's happening,  you know, everything's a good time.  But then sometimes  when there's just too much going on  and you have to go,  David, all right, okay.  Or Bobo, all right already, all right.  And they'll understand  and they'll sit there, you know,  and then, you know, 
[01:26:30]  and just calm the situation down.  Stevie has no gauge  of what's too much, what's, you know.  Stevie can be heard yelling  almost at the top of his lungs  down the hallway.  Like, I can't believe  that we haven't gotten  any kind of shit for it yet.  Tell him why I was yelling.  Tell him why I'm yelling.  Stevie, I don't know why.  Because I have Tourette's, right?  I just yell uncontrollably.  Why were you yelling, Stevie?  They do shit to me all the time.  Like, they sneak up on me,  they fucking, they take my shit away,  they take my shoes off  and hide it from me.  Who takes your shoes off, Stevie?  Who does it?  Is it me or is it Sam?  Have I ever fucking taken 
[01:27:00]  your shoe off?  It's not just Sam.  Stop trying to paint everything on Sam.  Oh, man.  He loves Sam.  Dude, I'm not talking  about anybody else right now.  He loves Sam.  I'm asking you right now,  have I ever fucking,  have I ever hit you in the balls, Stevie?  Have I ever taken your shoes off, Stevie?  Have I ever hit  any of your fucking clothes?  See, I don't know.  Shut the fuck up.  No, you took my fucking belt.  You took my fucking intern belt  when I was trying to get work done.  That's right, Stevie.  I took your plastic WWE  intern championship  with the world's belt.  No, it's the executive intern belt.  You knew that I enjoyed that belt.  You didn't have to take it from me. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, you were the things  that come out of his mind.  But the shoes...  He was very proud of his belt.  Sam takes your shoes  and you flick Sam's ass.  I took one shoe.  See, that's the thing  is that I don't always know  who takes my stuff.  You're a herb.  They...  Oh, yeah, all right, whatever, whatever.  Just throw that name around again.  Here we go, herb.  You're a herb.  You're a herb.  Yes, I'm Herb Brooks.  I'm the coach of the Miracle on Ice team.  I'm Herb Brooks.  Nice.  I like that.  Hockey reference.  Beautiful.  Good one.  Damn.  This kid's unbeatable.  That's brilliant.  You won't even tell me what it means,  but you'll say it a million times, though. 
[01:28:00]  It's a...  It's just you.  See, that's all he has to say.  He won't even tell me what it means.  It's a loser.  It's some fucking just punk bitch fag.  It's you.  Punk bitch fag.  Okay, based on what?  What are you...  You're based on your entire...  I think it's based on...  You just hate me.  On every interaction I've ever had with you.  You just hate me.  You just hate me, Danny.  That's it.  Just say that you hate me.  There's no other reason.  I do.  I absolutely hate you.  Okay, but there's no other reason  for you to say anything else.  Just you hate me.  That's it.  Yeah, but it's not like I saw your face  the first day you were here  and I was like,  that fucking kid?  I can't stand it.  There's reasons why. 
[01:28:30]  I bet you did, though.  It's built up over time.  Hatred built up.  I don't like you  because of all the things.  I've got to say, honestly,  Danny has never gotten along with me, ever.  Yeah.  He's given me the most trouble.  Yeah, because you've never done anything right.  Pat from Monagas said,  you need miracle on eyes.  Damn straight.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, Pat.  Good old Pat.  Pat listened to everybody up.  See, everyone's laughing now.  Miracle on eyes.  Smiles and laughs going on.  All right, so Stevie gets kicked in the balls 
[01:29:00]  and all his stuff is taken away from him.  Yeah, he gets kicked in the nuts.  All his stuff gets stolen from Sam,  yet he loves Sam  because he thinks Sam is teaching about it,  but he doesn't understand.  Sam is a smarmy, nasty man.  He's got, what is that?  Sam's just trying to make him feel like one of the guys.  Yeah, yeah.  What's that when you fall in love with your...  He's trying to bring him up a little bit.  Oh, yes.  Kidnapper.  Yes, yes, the Stockholm Syndrome.  Stockholm Syndrome, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's just...  Yeah.  Like...  He's got the Stockholm...  As much as Stevie doesn't like... 
[01:29:30]  Stevie, list who you hate the most  and then go down from there.  Definitely number one is Danny, obviously.  It's got...  Come on.  All right, who's number two?  Probably Travis because he wailed me in the nuts.  All right, Travis.  And has no...  And doesn't even care that he did it.  He's saying it's an accident.  He said he was sorry 20 times.  No, he didn't.  And he said, oh, come on.  It didn't hurt you, man.  Holy shit, play the fucking tape.  Stevie, what do you want me to do?  He said he was sorry.  Stevie, I want to know why I was sifting the nuts.  You still haven't...  Stevie, I've explained this like five times. 
[01:30:00]  Okay, tell me.  He was sorry.  It's an accident, right?  Yeah.  That's what you're going to stick with?  What do you want me to do?  You're going to stick with that?  What do you want me to do?  I want you to tell me why you really kicked me in the nuts.  Is it because you hate me?  If you say...  Stop being retarded.  I don't hate you, Stevie.  Stop being retarded.  Well, then I...  Look, I'd rather you tell me that than lie to me and just totally just...  Look at his rosy red cheeks now.  His blood pressure is going up.  Little apples.  Jesus.  Little apples.  Little kissable apples.  I naturally blush.  Yes.  Like Prince Harry. 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  I just like it.  I love he annoys everybody.  Keep going with the lint.  Okay, number three I would probably say is Troy because he hit on my mom and it made me  very uncomfortable.  Yeah, sure.  Wow.  He's in third place after trying to have sex with your mom.  Troy?  But Troy never kicked me in the nuts.  For Danny and Travis.  Yeah, but Sam has.  No, no, no.  So where's Sam?  How come Sam doesn't have that list?  Sam?  Okay.  How come Sam is not even 40?  The other people have done it as you guys have kicked me lightly and then as a joke.  You guys, I never have.  How many times have you been kicked in the nuts? 
[01:31:00]  Stop saying you guys.  About 20.  About 20.  Have I ever touched your testicles?  Was that 40 times?  You are?  Yeah, okay.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  So Danny's never touched your testicles.  That's fair.  Deny, deny, deny.  Just like Tricky Dick.  What did Danny do to your testicles, Stevie?  I've never touched his testicles.  He is, between Travis and Danny, they have done sexual things that have made me very uncomfortable.  With each other, not with you.  No, no, no, no.  They've done things to me.  They've all gotten all like, oh, like gay, like you're making gay passes at me. 
[01:31:30]  You have humped him.  I might have humped him.  I don't know what goes on in this place.  I don't know what goes on.  I have been humped.  Let me ask you for the record, on air, have I ever done a sexual thing to you?  No, you have not.  Thank you.  Have I ever touched your nuts?  No.  Atta boy.  I want to be on the Jim Norton list.  On the record.  I've never touched you sexually.  And Anthony.  Well, believe me, I would love if we could just get rid of the kids so that there's no temptations.  Yeah.  Wow.  You really just deserve to be. 
[01:32:00]  This guy's been hazed for way too long.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't the initiation thing kind of over?  I mean, I'm all...  Yeah, here's how much he hates it.  You haze him, and then he leaves the room, and then you go, hey, Stevie.  And he just comes right back in.  What do you want me to do?  Ignore you?  Hey, Stevie.  Yeah.  I'm a freaking intern.  I have to do what you guys want me to do.  You go, Stevie, go home.  Go home.  Because then if I don't do what you say, I'm going to support you.  He stands there with a...  What am I supposed to do, Danny?  There's no wind.  He stands there with his jacket on. 
[01:32:30]  He pulled his mic.  He stands there with a sad face and his jacket on, not leaving.  Danny pulled the cord out of his microphone.  Ah, the microphone just fell.  He just doesn't shut up.  He just says words.  It's like you're not saying anything.  And Sam's right there to give him another mic.  Sam's right there for him.  Right there.  Sam's right there for him.  You're real tough.  They should give you a radio show in Cleveland.  I know you're not.  That was sarcasm.  See, I can do that, too.  Oh, man.  This kid is good.  I can't figure you out, Stevie. 
[01:33:00]  Figure me out.  Kid's hanging in there, right?  Because he knows he'll never...  Dude, it's a tough spot to be in.  I don't care.  It's funny.  I'm just laughing.  Yeah, I get it.  But the thing is, is that he...  Look how many.  Look how many.  He keeps going with it.  Look at him.  You're out of your freaking mind.  Look at you.  Look at you.  Yeah, I'm just so crazy over here.  The guy's been humped, kicked in the wall 20 times.  What's the gay fucking thing again?  They made gay passes at me.  Has anyone kissed you? 
[01:33:30]  They've tried.  Luckily, I've avoided that one.  All right.  I'm done with you, Steve.  We got Walt Frazier standing by.  Is he here?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  He'll be here soon.  Oh, look at the little tiger on TV.  Has he come here or no?  Adorable.  So, we're going to take a break.  Oh.  What happened?  Danny grabbed the headphones from Stevie.  And there goes Stevie.  Sulking down the hallway.  Stevie.  Stevie.  Stevie.  His shoulders held high.  Yeah, I see the shoulders up high. 
[01:34:00]  Are they?  He's allowed to.  Because Sam says he's allowed to just do whatever he wants.  Oh, shit.  So, he runs around here and fucking just acting like that non-stop.  Non-stop.  On-air, off-air.  It doesn't matter.  Sam's just bringing him up.  Building him up.  Yes.  Building him up.  Building him up.  I'm going to make sure he's okay.  Let's go take care of him.  See?  There you go, Sam.  Make sure he's all right.  Make sure he's got enough reading material back there.  I don't want him to get bored today.  All right.  We're going to take a break and talk to the Great Wall Freed.  Yes.  Coming up.  Coming up next. 
[01:34:30]  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  All right.  It's got a text from Roland.  Oh, yeah?  On my way up with Walt.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you got it?  Oh, yeah.  We know. 
[01:35:00]  I was listening to my Alice in Chains there.  Yeah, Walt Frazier will be here in a second or two.  Promoting his book, A Guide to Basketball and Cool, Rock and Steady.  Walt Frazier and Ira Burkow.  Ira.  With an introduction by Bill Russell.  I guess it's a book that came out a while ago, and they updated it for the current time.  Ah, written with Ira.  Ira Burkow.  When was this written originally?  72, I think.  I'm guessing. 
[01:35:30]  1945.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's different.  It's wrong.  Oh, that's when he was born.  1974.  Okay.  And, you know, they touched it up a little bit and threw it out there again.  So, supposedly this book reached cult status when it first came out in 1974.  And then the great Walt Frazier gave the Knicks two championships, 1970 and 1973, I believe.  Yeah.  When they had one hell of a team with Willis Reed, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusher, Phil Jackson was part of that action. 
[01:36:00]  Jerry Lucas, that retard, hit a weird shot.  Oh, Jerry Lucas.  Oh, Jerry Lucas.  It would hit the, it would hit the, it would hit the, like, the, like, shit above.  He had such a weird arc on his balls.  Oh, really?  Sometimes if they were set up for the circus, circus or something, he would hit something up there.  He's some weirdo.  And he was a speed reader, I believe.  Really?  I don't know why I know this stuff, yeah.  Yeah.  Jerry Lucas. 
[01:36:30]  I wonder what happened to him.  Exactly.  He's probably reading quickly somewhere.  Telling you, probably bores everybody with facts about a book.  He gets half of it wrong because he zipped through it in eight minutes.  Zero comprehension.  All right.  I'll call you back.  I'm going to read War and Peace.  Get right back to you.  We got Walt Frazier walking down the hall, a fucking NBA legend.  Hell yeah.  An all-star.  Look at, he's still got the swagger.  Look at him.  Oh, yeah.  He still looks very intense.  He's 65 years old.  There he is.  The great Walt Frazier.  Sir. 
[01:37:00]  How are you doing?  What's going on, Walt?  How are you doing, man?  We were just talking about, obviously, you won championships with the Knicks in 73, and  I was mentioning all the guys.  I want to know what happened to Jerry Lucas.  Lucas.  He was a speed reader.  I read one of his books growing up.  How to speed read, and I can't even read normally.  Yeah.  He could remember the New York phone book.  Yes.  He had all these tricks.  That was a way to do that.  Like a photographic memory?  Yeah.  He had tricks, like Walt said.  Yeah.  We used to ask him, when do you sleep, man? 
[01:37:30]  When do you get pussy?  So he's in California.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Still willing and dealing.  He's doing all right?  Yeah.  As a guy who played many years ago, when you look at what guys make now, I always wanted  the athletes to get like, is there got to be that one party that goes like, ugh?  Like if I had played like X amount of years later, do the salaries bother you a little  bit or make you go like, oof?  It's like playing Monopoly.  I can't even relate to that.  Right.  You know, you're making $15 million, $20 million a year.  And I try not to think of it because otherwise I'd never be happy. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  You know, and a lot of players aren't.  I would say like 80, 90% of the guys are very disappointed when they see today's salaries.  You would think the new guys would, you know, throw you a little something for paying them  away.  A little check in your mailbox every once in a while.  LeBron James check would be nice, right, Walt?  Yeah, they will not.  They wouldn't vote to, you know, the guys from the 60s were not included in the pension.  Wow.  And these guys really didn't want to give them any money because they don't know.  A lot of the players don't know the history of the game today. 
[01:38:30]  They just came in primarily for the money and they think it's always been this way where  there's millions of dollars, sold out arenas, four-star hotels, private planes, Rolls Royces,  you know.  Well, you had a Rolls Royce, though.  Right.  I was one of the few guys, Earl and I, we were the Rolls Royce backcourt at the time.  That's right.  Earl Monroe, one of the greatest guards of all time, too.  Earl the Pearl.  Earl the Pearl was amazing.  See, I didn't even knew that.  Yeah, Earl the Pearl, of course.  Yeah, he had the showman game, shaking and baking in the school ground type of play. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, and Walt would roll up to the games in a Rolls Royce.  Yeah, men coach, right, like in complete style.  Yeah, New York style.  Yeah, total New York style.  So who didn't want to include you guys in the pensions?  It was the NBA or the players today?  Well, the guys from the 60s were not included.  You know, like Bob Cousy and those type of guys were not included in the pension plan.  So some of those legends are hurting today?  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of the players, a lot of the guys are hurting. 
[01:39:30]  Even some of the former players, man, they're destitute, a lot of them.  It's like the old fighters, too.  Yeah, I was saying the old boxers.  Like, we just saw, there's a big article on Iran Barkley, who I guess he made $5 million over his career.  But I don't know if he spent it wisely.  But he's living in a hotel in the Bronx.  Well, remember the article recently in Sports Illustrated?  It said about, what, 80% of these guys, once they leave the game, are broke.  You know, so...  Is it bad investments, do you think, or bad business managers, or, you know, you're a young guy  and all of a sudden you're handed X amount of money? 
[01:40:00]  All of the above.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Women.  Wine women some.  Yeah.  Women will get you every time.  Uncle Sam.  Uncle Sam takes his piece.  It really is amazing how some people never think that the government's going to come and  go, look, you owe us taxes.  It's like, you've got to give it to them, because they're always going to...  They're not ever going to go, oh, yeah, we forgot about you.  They always show up at the door asking for it.  Now, Walt, I grew up a Knicks fan.  When are we going to have a team that we could be proud of again?  It's been a long fucking time.  I think we're blending one now, man. 
[01:40:30]  We're getting there?  I think it's coming together, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Stoudemire is a positive role model for these young guys.  Terry Off, some tenacity in the paint.  Felton, orchestrating, penetrating.  So, you know, this last road trip, we were three and one.  So hopefully we can carry this over tonight.  It's amazing that the world's most famous arena, but we're not that dominant at home.  So we've got to become a better home court team. 
[01:41:00]  Right on, yeah.  Yeah.  How do the young players treat you?  They treat you like with reverence, right?  I mean, you're one of the gods of the game.  It's got to be...  Yeah, they call me legend, the legend.  That's nice, right?  Yeah.  Of course it is.  The women still responding, I'm sure?  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  If they've had enough drinks, what are you getting at?  Paul Frazier rules.  What do you miss most when you leave it?  Because I've asked other athletes before, team sport guys. 
[01:41:30]  Is it the camaraderie or is it the schedule?  What is it you miss the most?  That's a good question, man.  The camaraderie and the challenge of every other night to be a hero.  Really?  Yeah.  Nothing else in your life is going to give you that, where you have that competitiveness  and you look forward to going out there.  After every loss, you want to come back and redeem yourself.  So it's not like football where you have to wait a week.  Right.  You know, you could be a hero tonight and a bomb tomorrow in the NBA. 
[01:42:00]  But that's what I like, the challenge.  And then, of course, the guys in the locker room, all the BS that goes on in the locker room.  Teasing each other, right?  Yeah.  And you've got to remember, you're in the prime of your life.  You're in your 20s, 25 years old.  The world's greatest city.  We were winning, having a winning tradition.  Oh, yeah.  So it was a lot of fun.  What is the biggest time in playing that you were just like, oh, I'm awful?  Like, what is the biggest – they say you're the hero or the GOAT.  Like, what is the worst one you can remember? 
[01:42:30]  Like, the shot you wish you would have made?  Or is there a moment that you're like, eh, that one I could kind of redo if I could?  Well, there are a lot of those.  You see, most people think when you lose a close game, it's easy.  Those are the worst.  I'd rather get blown out by 50.  That makes more sense.  You can sleep a night after being blown out by 50.  Right.  Because when you lose by one, there's always if or would have, should have, could have,  what you're talking about.  If I had made that shot, if I had made this pass, so it kind of wears on you. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, and Walt did, I think, 10 years with the Knicks?  Something like that?  Yeah, 10 years, 67 to 77.  And then you broke all our hearts when you had to, like, finish your career in Cleveland.  Yeah, man.  What did you do, one or two seasons there?  10.  You did 10 years in Cleveland?  Seemed like it.  No, no, no.  I equated to being shipped to Siberia.  Wait, how many years did you really do?  I did two, but it was...  Okay, you scared me.  That's funny.  I was like, I didn't...  Wow.  Yeah, two years in Cleveland.  Yeah, it was rough, man.  But it kind of prepared me for afterwards. 
[01:43:30]  I'm sure if I never got traded, I'd probably still be riding around in the rows in New York  being Clyde.  So once I was traded, I became more of a homebody.  And I knew I was only going to play a couple of more years, so I started focusing on my  life after the game.  And I don't know, now you guys know I have a place in the Virgin Islands.  I'm into gardening.  Oh, yeah.  St. Croix.  Nice.  What do you grow in your garden?  A little, you know...  A little marijuana. 
[01:44:00]  I have fruit trees, mango trees, orange trees, anything there.  You put a stick in the ground and it'll grow.  Oh, yeah, the weather's very conducive, so...  How long are you down there every year?  Once the season's over.  You're done.  That's where you call home?  Yeah, yeah, in off-season.  I also have rental properties there that I rent out that I design and decorate it, landscaped,  so...  Wow, well, Fraser's doing all right, man.  You're doing all right.  Well, I got lucky, man. 
[01:44:30]  I got lucky that I was...  My only flamborneous is in clothes.  Otherwise, I'm a very conservative person.  Right.  You're wearing...  By the way, people can't see what a...  He's wearing a very cool leather outfit with a...  How would you describe the jacket?  It's like, I love what you're wearing, and yet, if I wore it, somebody would just smack  me and take it off me.  It would look silly.  I can't look cool.  That's a phenomenal outfit.  It's very American Indian looking.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  These are the Indian...  It's got some leather fringe on it, and some...  Actually, I got this in Vegas at one of those shops out there, the Western shops. 
[01:45:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that...  You've got to be the right guy to walk around on that.  It really is amazing how Walt Fraser can just dress differently than Jim Norton and look  amazingly good.  Of course.  At least tall in shape.  Yeah, do you really do?  By the way, you don't like to compliment another man's appearance too much, but I mean, you  look very, very healthy and young.  It's like, whatever you do...  Are you still, like, exercising regularly, or are you just one of those guys who's blessed?  Well, I do.  This is what we were talking about with this book.  This book was from 1974, and I was into health and fitness then, and now I'm still 
[01:45:30]  into it.  So...  And the Just for Men doesn't hurt, right?  The Just for Men was a savior, yeah.  But it looks good on him.  You can't tell him.  No.  He's just for men.  It's not.  He's a spokesperson for Just for Men.  Yeah.  He's all over the place with that.  You never saw the commercials?  No.  Keith Hernandez?  Him and Keith Hernandez?  Yeah.  Him and Keith Hernandez?  No, I love him.  I'm usually in the gym.  Well, see, you don't need it.  That's why.  You don't need it.  I do need it.  Why do you think I keep it this short?  Because as soon as it starts to come in, it's gray, and I'm like, just keep the illusion 
[01:46:00]  that I'm still 30.  Jimmy gets Just for Trannies.  Well, you know how it is.  I've heard this book, too.  People were talking about this book, and they said it's very funny.  Like, there's some really, really funny stuff in this book.  Like, it's not a completely serious book.  Right, and that's why we brought it back, because it kind of was an iconic book that people  were still looking for on the internet, trying to come up with rock and study.  And, you know, even a title, A Guide to Basketball and Cool.  There's a section that I show you how to catch flies. 
[01:46:30]  I talk about my style.  I talk about women.  I talk about the evolution of the game today, how the game has changed.  Like, when I played, I was a backcourt man.  And you had to rebound, defend, score.  Today, if you're a point guard, you don't shoot.  You're a shooting guard.  You don't dribble.  So they've taken away the versatility of the players today.  So they're sort of, everybody's sort of a specialist.  Right.  That's very true. 
[01:47:00]  Who were the greatest guards in NBA history?  Yeah, in the book, I, defense, you know, was my forte.  I love to play defense.  You know how to steal that ball.  Yeah, in the book, I allude to how I guarded Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Earl LeParle,  Dave Bing, Gail Goodrich, Phil Chenier, all of these prolific scorers that I had to deal with.  So my favorite player of all time, you're up there, by the way, but Pete Maravich was my favorite.  Pistol Pete, I have Pistol in there, yeah.  Pistol Pete was my favorite of all time.  Yeah, he was uncanny.  Yeah.  Passing, his dribbling. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a showman like Earl LeParle.  Oh, boy, was he.  And then blows out his knee doing one of those moves.  And he was never the same after that.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, I was inducted into the Hall of Fame with Pete.  Pete and Rick Barry in 1987.  Right.  I remember Rick Barry from the ABA.  Yeah.  But the red, white, and blue ball.  And he used to take the foul shots from, like, between his legs.  Yeah, did you laugh at those guys?  The ABA?  No, the, uh, the, uh.  Oh, the old-time shot.  From the foul line. 
[01:48:00]  But it's very accurate, man.  I know, but it does look cool.  Walt Frazier would never be doing that.  Well, you see, that's what the guys today, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the leading scorer in the history of the game.  Yes.  Using what, the skyhook?  Yeah.  It's obsolete today because guys would say, hey, man, that's old school.  Right.  Yeah, but it's a very effective weapon.  It sure was.  But today it's style over substance and many things that's going on in the game.  Mm-hmm.  You think guys are bigger today, too?  Oh, my God.  Like, would Abdul-Jabbar be as effective skyhooking?  I guess because you can't, you can't block it once it's on its way in, but. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, he could get it off, Chris.  He was.  Yeah, there's no way to defend against that.  It really doesn't look cool.  It really, the little leg comes up.  It's very, almost like a very dainty move, but ooh, is it effective?  Yeah, yeah.  It's because you can't block it.  It's very, especially if you're seven feet tall.  Mm-hmm.  So, today the game is more about dunks, threes.  Yeah.  You know, it's entertainment.  A lot of neck tattoos, I'm noticing.  Oh, man.  They're tatted up, these guys, Walt.  You don't have a tattoo, do you?  No, some of these guys, they're overboard, man.  Yeah.  There's no more room.  There's no room left, you know? 
[01:49:00]  Who was the first guy that started, that started the, I remember coming up, I remember  Daryl Dawkins, I think, for the Nets.  Rodman.  Rodman.  Yeah, Rodman.  Dennis Rodman.  Oh, Dennis Rodman, right.  We had this discussion.  Rodman or Allen Iverson started the whole tattoo phase.  Oh, no, no.  I mean the whole.  The dunk?  The slam being the big highlight.  I mean, I just remember.  Dr. J.  Yeah, absolutely.  Dr. Sufman.  Yeah, Dr. J.  Then Daryl was on his team.  Right.  Chocolate Thunder.  I didn't realize how short Dr. J was when he shaved his, you know, his hair down. 
[01:49:30]  He shrank before your eyes.  Oh, my God.  I thought it was like 6'10 or something.  It's only like 6'4", 6'5".  Without that hair.  Only when he's leaving, man.  Yeah.  Who was the toughest guy you ever faced?  Like, who was the guy you hated?  If you had to pick one guy you never want to face again on the court, who was the toughest  one that you think you had to go up against?  Probably Monroe.  Yeah.  He's the only man I ever dreamt about.  This guy used to give me nightmares, man.  Yeah.  You couldn't figure him out.  You know, because say if I guarded Oscar Robertson, I knew he was going to try to overwhelm me 
[01:50:00]  with physical size.  Jerry West was going to do it with quickness.  But Earl, he didn't know what he was going to do.  Everything was improvisation, you know?  So everything was created on the spot, man.  It was very...  And he had that spin move.  But I love the challenge, trying to guard him.  And that's why when he came to the Knicks, a lot of people said, we need two basketballs.  It would not work.  But we had such mutual respect for each other when we were opponents.  So when he came to the Knicks, we never had a problem who had the ball. 
[01:50:30]  If I was scoring, I gave him the ball, vice versa.  And I think unequivocally, we were the greatest backcourt ever.  Because basketball is different than, obviously, the baseball, because A-Rod and Jeter are two  giant players.  But they don't rely on each other as much as two guys on a basketball court, too, who  are just constantly interacting in order to score.  And the problem is, you know, you want your shots.  And Earl wanted his shots.  Earl wanted his shots.  They say Kobe and Shaq never kind of gelled, and that kind of hurt. 
[01:51:00]  Although the team did very well.  Early on, they struggled.  Did they?  Those two?  It's all about ego, man.  If you sacrifice your ego...  You think it's going to work out for LeBron in Miami?  Man, can you believe how dreadful they are?  Yeah, they're not...  I think they're...  Last night, they hit rock bottom, and they lost to Indiana at home.  Aren't they eight and six or something like that?  They were expected to be the best team in the league.  See, it's chemistry, man.  There's a word called chemistry.  And we're all rooting for that team to completely fail. 
[01:51:30]  Unless you live around Miami, of course.  But the rest of the league is like...  I'm sure Riley will be coming back to coaching soon, man.  The way they're floundering, he has to come back.  Yeah, you've got a super team, and it's not working so far.  Yeah, but they have other problems, because they have nothing in the middle.  Their bench, there's a very thin bench.  Well, they had to kind of throw a team together, right?  They only had the big three players.  Right, and they took all of their money.  Right, and then they didn't really have money for anybody else.  You need that sixth man, right? 
[01:52:00]  Well, somebody to come off that bench.  Yeah, you've got to have eight players.  That's why the Knicks are thriving now.  They've shortened their rotation to eight players,  and they're getting tangible results now.  Are you watching only...  What do you watch?  Do you watch mostly basketball, or do you keep boxing, MMA?  I'm all around.  You watch everything?  Yeah, I keep abreast of football.  Football, I love.  I was a quarterback in high school.  And football, I was a catcher in baseball.  And so I like the game. 
[01:52:30]  I like boxing.  I watch track and field.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you wish you were a football player ever?  Not when I see 300-pound guys running like that, man.  Yeah.  No, I don't think so.  Out of some of those quarterbacks, I don't know how they get up, man.  It's unbelievable.  After some of those hits.  The hits this year are unbelievable.  Yeah.  I wanted to ask Walt about the five greatest players of all time.  Five greatest players.  Other than myself.  Other than yourself.  Worth including yourself.  You could include yourself.  I'm just going to laugh at that. 
[01:53:00]  There has been one Superman in the game.  That was Will Chamberlain.  Sure.  And Bill Russell was right behind him.  And I go with Robertson and West.  Wow.  I guess I have to throw Jordan in there.  Michael has to be in that top five.  But you're just kind of throwing him in at the end?  No respect for Jordan?  No, there's respect.  But when it comes to the history of the game, he just squeaks in there?  Yeah.  Top five?  I think if he played in our era, he would not have been as dominant. 
[01:53:30]  Really?  Why?  Because we had seven-foot guys.  We had seven-foot guys.  You know, there were really no centers when Michael started to dominate.  Plus, the league is expanding.  There are more teams.  So they're not as strong.  Wow.  A lot of people would put Jordan in either one or two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  But see, today, who's ever playing is the greatest.  Right.  If you're doing it today.  So a lot of people never saw Will Chamberlain play.  Because to me, this is the thing. 
[01:54:00]  Will Chamberlain is the only player they had to change the rules for to try to contain  him.  Right.  When you see goaltending, that man started goaltending.  Where he used to shoot the ball from the side of the basket, he'd jump up and pull it out  of the air.  Didn't matter where it was.  Right.  It could be in the cylinder, pretty much.  Anywhere.  Right.  So they had to change it.  That's goaltending.  They're in the lane.  They widened the lane from six feet to eight feet to keep this guy, try to contain this guy  in the paint.  So he's the only player that they really changed the game for, you know? 
[01:54:30]  Do you think Jordan, he was obviously a great player, but do you think in the history of  basketball, he's been slightly overrated compared with a lot of the guys that came a little  bit before him?  Only overrated because people never saw Oscar Robertson in his prime.  Jerry West, Will Chamberlain.  There's very little footage.  Right.  Come on, Oscar Robertson, the guy who almost averaged a triple-double for his whole career.  You know, he did it for one season.  And I'm talking 25 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists. 
[01:55:00]  Every game he was doing.  Right.  Every game.  Doubles.  And wasn't there no footage of Will?  Didn't he score?  It was 100, I want to say, against Philly?  Am I wrong about that?  The Knicks, unfortunately.  Oh, you guys did the Knicks?  And there was no footage of that, right?  There's no film of that.  Not really, no.  No, but there were 20,000 people there anyway that saw it.  Even though the gym only held 1,000, but everyone says they were at that game.  But you can't watch it in a replay like you can all of Jordan's great plays.  You didn't put Kareem in the top five, or did you? 
[01:55:30]  No.  Kareem is there, too.  He's in the next tier with Magic.  Kareem and Magic, those guys.  Bird.  I was going to ask for about Bird.  Yeah.  What about Kareem's acting chops there on Airplane?  He ruined it for all of you.  I thought he was great.  He didn't lead the way.  He ruined it.  He was the co-pilot.  He sure was.  Even being in Hollywood didn't help him, man.  They said the funny thing, too, is guys like Nicholson, who's obsessed with basketball, 
[01:56:00]  when he would go into the Lakers' locker room, all he wants to talk about is basketball,  and all they want to talk about is acting.  It's like, do you find that with other celebrities on your level?  They want to talk about what you do, and you want to talk about what they do?  Well, yeah, when we meet Spike, you know, Spike is a tremendous fan, but it doesn't bother  me, because being a broadcaster, I learn a lot from the fans.  Sometimes they say something, and I go, wow, I never thought of that.  You know, so I like talking to the New York fans made me create my style, because when 
[01:56:30]  I first came to the game, I'd been away, and I was saying fast break, and they were saying  transition.  I was saying passing, they were saying addition, and versatility, you know, all this creativity,  and I was like, hey, man, that's the way I should sound.  If I'm going to be doing this, I've got to work at this.  So I worked diligently to improve my vocabulary, and so now I added dishing and swishing.  So I had my own little posting and toasting, shaking and baking, you know, wheeling and 
[01:57:00]  dealing, so all the things that I created from that once I improved my vocabulary.  Sometimes you can catch old games on, like, ESPN Classic, and it really is funny to watch  the evolution of the uniform, the shorts that used to just be ridiculously short and  silly looking.  Yeah, how do you keep your balls in those shorts?  That's what we're getting at.  It did look really silly.  I'm surprised the ball didn't pop out on somebody.  Look, maybe not Bradley or the Bullshit.  We could have never gotten away with that, because we guys used to grab our shorts back in the 
[01:57:30]  day, you know.  Look, he's just being polite.  When it was all white guys, the shorts could be shorter.  We all understand that.  There's a reason why they're in long shorts now.  So then Jordan brought them in.  Jordan's were fine.  Now they're too long, man.  The guys are taking it to the other extreme.  Yeah, now they're really, really long.  Yeah, too baggy, too extreme.  How about the fans, too?  It's like, you've seen a couple guys run into the stands, and it's like, I don't know how  more guys don't do that.  Like, there's a line where people are just yelling about stuff that is game-related, and 
[01:58:00]  I know some of the fans can just be atrocious.  Yeah, but you can't lose your cool that way.  Have you ever wanted to?  I mean, were there times when you'd be on the road where it went beyond where you were  not with the fans, with the coach?  I wanted to do the Sprewell on Holtzman before Sprewell.  Oh, really?  You didn't like Greg Holtzman at times?  Well, sometimes, man, he can make you very upset.  You want to choke him, you know?  But we never did.  He's a racist.  Red had a way of antagonizing you.  Like, Frazier, you're supposed to be a good defensive player.  This guy is eating you up, you know? 
[01:58:30]  Holtzman was a legendary coach, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He knew how to push the buttons, man.  He knew how to get you fired up.  And I accredit a lot of my success in the game to him.  How do you guys respond to it?  Like, Peyton Manning, here's an example of just making a comeback against New England  this week, and he threw an interception going down.  And he's obviously a great quarterback.  But he screwed up, and he cost the team what could have been the Italian field goal.  When you guys go into the locker room, the field goal kicker that missed, or the guy 
[01:59:00]  that missed the free throw, how does the rest of the team respond to the guy who obviously  just blew it?  Be honest, Walt.  Yeah, like, what is the feeling about if you've been the guy who's done it?  Well, usually they ignore you.  They don't say anything.  You know, they don't say anything.  Like, and there's some guys that come over and say, it's all right.  The coach will usually come over and say, it's all right, you know, we'll get him the next  time.  I guess they know they screwed up.  Why, you know, why antagonize them?  But today, the most unforgiving miss is a field goal kicker. 
[01:59:30]  Nobody has any sympathy for a field goal.  No, because that's all they do.  Because this is all you do, man.  That's all you do.  So, nobody has any compassion for him once he misses.  You should never miss.  Especially anything now inside, like, the 40-yard line.  It's like anything.  You should be making that.  Right.  They don't expect him to miss.  But, like, with Peyton, he's won so many games.  Right.  You know, the guy's just, hey, man.  Right.  You know, that's one of those things.  Because you know he's going to come back and redeem himself.  Well, a lot of people, everyone has a question for you, but they want me to ask you about 
[02:00:00]  Kobe.  What's your thoughts on Kobe Bryant?  Kobe Bryant.  He's right there with Michael.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the dominant player today.  The preeminent player in the league.  Shoot.  He can defend.  He's team-oriented.  So, he really has no weaknesses.  And the other thing, I've got to get back to LeBron James.  I forgot about this.  What do you think of him leaving Cleveland like that?  I mean, I was shocked he did not come to New York.  How could he turn this challenge down?  Right.  I couldn't believe it. 
[02:00:30]  I was just flabbergasted when it happened.  Patrice O'Neal made a good point.  He said LeBron James decided he wanted to be Pippen instead of Jordan.  Like the second guy.  Right.  On a team.  Why would you want to do that?  I know.  You want a championship that bad?  I don't understand.  Maybe he didn't like where Cleveland was heading, but the Knicks would have been a great opportunity.  Yeah.  I thought if he didn't come to the Knicks, he would stay with Cleveland.  I mean, they weren't that far away.  So, you were kind of shocked by the whole thing, right?  I was shocked, man.  Especially knowing about egos and stuff.  I mean, this city, we've given the guy everything already. 
[02:01:00]  And here, all he had to do was win one title to be immortalized.  If he wins three or four in Miami, it's not the same.  Right.  Because he's got Wade.  He's got Bosh.  He's got all these guys.  So, it's not going to be the same.  I think it's the New York media, too.  A lot of guys don't want to come here because the New York media can be brutal.  I think that scares a lot of guys away.  New York's not for everybody.  It's the special type of player that likes the camaraderie here, the fans.  That challenge there that I was alluding to, that every other day, they go out and win the game. 
[02:01:30]  Do you want, when you see yourself plastered on the back of the paper and there's just some sports reporter just giving you a beating for what you did the night before, how personally do you take that?  I stop reading.  I stop reading the paper late in my career.  They were bashing me, so I just stop reading the paper.  Stop reading it, yeah.  New York's paper's funny when it's not about you.  When it started being about me, it wasn't so funny, you know.  Yeah, the big unit couldn't take it. 
[02:02:00]  Randy Johnson could not take it.  Randy Johnson lost his mind here in New York because they wouldn't leave him alone.  And he blew his cool so many times at the press.  Oh, they hate him.  Yeah, you see, you can't do that.  You've got to stay cool, remain cool.  Because what I like about New York is when you're thriving, hey, man, they're giving you all the kudos.  You're the greatest.  You're the greatest.  So then to me, it's fair that when you're not playing well, they bash you.  They're going to rip you apart.  You know, that's the way it is.  But in other cities, the players are thriving.  They don't get the kudos that they get in New York. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, that's true.  That's the place to be, apparently.  Walt only has a minute or two left.  I want to make sure we get the plug out for the book.  I'm actually looking through it.  Anything else you want to say about the book, Walt?  I'd say I think the fans will enjoy it because it's about the evolution and revolution of the game.  I mentioned that today the players are more like specialists because of the system or point guard, shooting guard, as opposed to when I played.  The defense in there that I talk about how to defend these prolific scorers. 
[02:03:00]  There are some great pitches, action shots of me, my fashion passion, about my wardrobe, how that all evolved, and my teammates, you know, the camaraderie with my teammates, how we captivated New York with our style of play.  And I think it will bring back a lot of memories for the fans that were around in the 70s and for the young fans that know me now as a Knick announcer.  They'll get an insight into me as a ball player and a person.  This is great, too, because there's a lot of – everyone likes a lot of great photos. 
[02:03:30]  These are all great photos, but there's a lot of – there's writing and photos, which is, like, perfect in a book.  Oh, yeah.  I hate books that have no pictures.  Yeah, easy read.  And great line here.  Pit juice is what some of the players call underarm deodorant.  Just fantastic little lines like that.  A little tidbit.  Sometimes guys forgot that pit juice, man.  They were very offensive on the court.  Would guys do that on purpose, though?  Getting in your face with their armpits.  Yeah, yeah.  You hear about athletes that do that on purpose. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  They don't shower or brush their teeth for a week or so to make it just horrendous for you out there.  Is that true or is that just some dumb –  Well, some guy – I don't know if they were doing it intentionally, but there were guys noted for their offensive voter.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Are you doing any book signings for this?  Yeah, December 7th, I'm at the NBA store.  All right.  Here in New York.  Yeah, around – I think it's 2 o'clock.  Okay, December – I wish we had that on a sheet.  Do we have a sheet of that?  Because we can give that after you leave the book signing.  December 7th at the NBA store. 
[02:04:30]  Will Frazier will be there.  And that will obviously be a line.  So keep in mind, December 7th.  And the book is out now.  People can get it now.  Right, right.  It's in the stores now.  And there's a terrific picture of me on the cover with one of my outfits on, a gaucho hat.  I have a $20 gold piece around my neck, which I framed.  I used to wear that for good luck.  And a cape.  A cape.  An internal – it almost looks like a religious outfit.  A lot of people can't wear a cape.  You know, can't pull off the cape. 
[02:05:00]  You and Elvis pull off the cape.  Yeah, and Superman.  And Superman.  Superman pulled it off well.  And, you know, non-flying people.  Well, this is great, though.  I really like it a lot.  I've been perusing it as we've been talking.  And it's a quality book, man.  It's really – you'll do very well with this.  I'm sure you've done well with it before.  You'll do all that again.  Right.  And that's the beauty of playing in New York.  This is like my sixth book that I've done.  So you have all basketball books or did you kind of go into novels?  I did a word book on my vocabulary. 
[02:05:30]  I did an idiot's guide to basketball.  And then the other books were on the championship Knick teams.  A couple of books.  One was the game within the game and one magic season and a basketball life.  Oh, nice.  Very cool.  Buy this one.  Rock and Steady.  It's a hardcover, and it is out now by Walt Frazier.  Yeah, if you want to be cool, man, styling like Clyde, check it out.  The cool Walt Frazier.  I want this jacket badly, but in my size. 
[02:06:00]  You want it in your size?  Yeah, I would look silly.  Hey, Walt, thanks for stopping by, man.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Yeah, it was fun.  Thank you.  The opening of the show on the virus, Sirius XM.  Head like a hole, black as your soul, I'd rather die than give you control.  Head like a hole, black as your soul, I'd rather die than give you control. 
[02:06:30]  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  How cool is Walt Frazier?  Very nice guy.  He looked cool.  He's a cool cat.  He was smooth.  See how he walks down the hall?  He's got a swagger.  I got a picture with his jacket on.  He asked me to put it on and take a photo with him. 
[02:07:00]  That is funny.  I had to take one with my camera, too, my little camera.  Oh, can I see yours?  My iPhone.  Okay, it's really weird because whenever I take a photo with a black celebrity,  the camera doesn't know where to focus because I always come out looking really, really bright  because I'm so pale.  The camera gets very confused.  Dude, all of our photos are very bright.  Yeah, our faces are washed out.  His is a little bit, too.  Here's you with the coat on.  You know what? 
[02:07:30]  Anthony got a better photo.  Oh, I'm amazing.  Of the Walt Frazier coat.  Yeah.  Could you text me that or send it to me?  No.  Email to me?  No.  Why?  He's not going to do that.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Dane Cook.  Very busy show today.  What's up, Dane?  What's up, guys?  We just talked to Walt Frazier, the great Walt Frazier.  Fantastic.  What's up?  Yeah, you don't care about Walt Frazier, do you?  I literally just woke up 33 seconds.  Oh, really?  I'm going to catch up with you guys.  I'll be there.  All right, you'll catch up. 
[02:08:00]  He's the great New York Knicks guard there.  Won two championships, 1970 and 73.  We were just talking during the break.  It's been 37 years since the Knicks won a title.  37 years.  And he's got like the last ring, I guess?  Yeah, he was showing me his championship ring, which was pretty cool to check out.  That's pretty wild.  Yeah, you're a Celtics fan, obviously, Dane, right?  Yeah, no, I was at all the big five games growing up.  You know, McHale, Parrish, Bird, Ainge, Johnson. 
[02:08:30]  Those were some amazing, amazing games.  You missed Dave Cowens?  He was a little too old for you when you were growing up?  Yeah, that was probably right before me.  But when I was coming up, you know, my pop was taking me to the old, old Boston Garden, you know,  where you weren't really truly a fan until somebody punched you in the back of the head at eight years old.  Yeah, at eight years old.  And it's like, congratulations, you're a fan.  In the back of the neck, you are not truly a fan.  I remember when we were living up there when they finally got rid of the old Boston Garden 
[02:09:00]  and you could walk on by because it was half gone.  The whole wall was just gone.  Yeah, they split it in half so you could see, like, the basketball court and the stands was still happening.  You could see it from the street.  It was the weirdest thing, man.  Right.  I would rather have watched a game in a half-torn-down Boston Garden than the original built Boston Garden.  That's how brutal it was seeing those old games in there.  But how cool is it for you?  You're a big Boston sports fan.  Like you said, you grew up with the Celtics. 
[02:09:30]  And then fast forward a few years, you're playing in these places.  That's got to be unbelievable.  I mean, it is.  I mean, it's certainly – but it's not like I'm driving the lane.  But it's cool, man.  There is no greater feeling than when the new garden went up and going in there and bringing my pop  and standing, actually standing doing comedy underneath those banners, you know,  looking up at all those wins was pretty wild.  Yeah, that's got to be a moment.  We were on stage at the garden. 
[02:10:00]  Remember that, Annette?  Doing a lesbian show for everybody before Andrew Dice Clay came out.  Yes.  So, see, we could relate, too.  And the championship banners were, you know, above our head as the girls were licking box.  Jesus.  No, it was before I came out and then Dice came out.  I had to follow the lesbian couch.  You had to follow the lesbian couch bit that we did for everybody?  Yeah.  Wow.  So, Dane, a lot going on.  You got the CD coming out today, is it?  Yeah.  Yeah, it just came out yesterday, I guess, for Black Monday. 
[02:10:30]  Is that what it's called?  Oh, that's what they call it now.  That's what they call the big shopping – cyber shopping.  Oh, cyber shopping.  Oh, that's right.  That is a real thing.  Black Friday and then Black Monday.  Cyber Monday.  Cyber Monday.  Cyber Monday.  That's it.  Cyber Monday.  Yeah.  It's Dane Cook's – it's called I Did My Best.  It's Greatest Hits.  It's actually a really cool cover.  It's a red cover with your name and an outline of you in the middle.  And it's a double CD.  And I'm always happy to see my friends doing arenas and putting out double CD Greatest Hits 
[02:11:00]  while I'm struggling to get my third CD.  I'm always happy for my friends who just continue to put stuff out.  You're a very motivated guy, man.  You seem to be kind of work-obsessed.  I love it.  I try to take breaks or I try to say, oh, I'm going to take a little – whatever hiatus  is and within 30 seconds, I hate my life.  Yeah.  So I'd rather just get out there and keep on doing something.  A little fun fact.  I love a little – whenever I do any of the cover art, the cover art for this is the 
[02:11:30]  exact colors of Eddie Van Halen's guitar.  Now, is that – how about the other – I wouldn't classify that as a fun factor.  Now, how about the other CDs?  Do they have any significance color-wise or no?  Let me just say this again.  Mediocre fact.  Fun at 5.30 for me.  Hilarious.  But we forgot to mention, too, with this Greatest Hits CD, you got 10 minutes of new material 
[02:12:00]  as well.  Oh, okay.  That's very smart on Dane's part.  Get some new stuff out there as well.  I went back and I was listening to all the old stuff and I thought that would just be  a bit more interesting instead of just slapping it all together to find other nougats that  didn't make it to the other discs and stuff to put back on here.  And that was actually kind of horrific because not only do I not like listening to myself  anyway, but when I went back, it's like I realized, A, how much higher my voice was 
[02:12:30]  10 years ago and how much thicker my Boston accent was 10 years ago.  You blame it on the tape, that it's sped up.  That's what I always say.  Is that what the –  Yeah, because I got the same issue, but I just –  The tape stretched over the years or something.  Yeah, I said, like, the tape stretched.  I don't know what that's about.  I didn't speak like that.  It's like I've been busting guys like Bobby's Balls for years and yet I'm like,  dude, you know what you need to do, dude?  So, dude, when you're working and you're trying to take time off, I always find myself 
[02:13:00]  like if I take time off, I'm afraid of, like, everyone's going to forget about me.  Do you have this weird thing that keeps – like, what's the longest you can take off  without feeling like, ah, I'm not going to be relevant anymore?  What's the longest you can relax?  Well, you know what?  It's almost like you just kind of – I feel like that happened anyway.  It's like whether you're busy or not, you go through those kind of phases where you're  like, yeah, nobody gives a crap.  But, you know, you just keep wanting to do it for the – you know, your fan base, people 
[02:13:30]  that, you know – and they are fickle.  There's certainly people you haven't been doing this long enough to know now.  It's like I get letters now like, yeah, I thought your last three things sucked, but  I love this thing.  I'm back.  And so people check in and check out, and you just kind of know that that's a bit  more of a career.  And I don't really, you know, mind that some people like to, you know, kind of – the  pendulum swings in and out.  As long as I feel like I'm doing something that, you know, I'm interested in and pays  the fucking rent, too, then I'm a happy guy. 
[02:14:00]  It's also tough to keep your fan base just because there's so much going on out there  now.  Yeah, yeah, which is, you know, even now, being out there in a tour, you know, and the  economy is tough, and people are struggling, and yet, you know, I've been fortunate to  do these larger-scale shows again, and we're having a blast.  The tour is like five weeks in, and, you know, I might be even at some dates because we're  just having a good time in there.  Who are you going out with now?  People who want to come out.  Who are you out with now?  I mean, what comedians? 
[02:14:30]  Like the three that are definitely on the rotation, I got Ben Glebe, I don't know if  you know Ben at all.  Oh, yeah, he's a nice dude.  Yeah, Ben Glebe, this kid, Chris Armie, he's kind of a new guy, and then Al Delbeni, who  I've known since I was a kid.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I know, Al.  What's your favorite part of touring?  Money.  Probably, well, I'm single, so the after party.  Oh, right.  There you go.  I see what you're doing on Twitter. 
[02:15:00]  Tweet me a picture of yourself, and, you know, maybe you could come backstage.  I see what you're up to, Dane.  Oh, my God.  That's very smart, though.  Very smart.  Guilty.  I saw that.  That's my goal in life, by the way.  I'm like, yeah, he really wants to meet his fans.  Dude, I want to go to one Dane Cook after show party.  That's just my goal.  Oh, you know what's going on, man?  Yeah, Jim Norton after show parties are fucking hideous.  It's me and Kenny and Lenny Marcus eating pretzels in my dressing room waiting for the check. 
[02:15:30]  My after parties suck.  You think that's different than what Dane's doing?  It's fucking, it really is, it's horrendous.  It's horrendous.  It's almost like his party's like a fucking rock band, and my party's like Stalker Patty.  It's fucking awful.  With a deli tray.  Just me and my sh...  Do you find that after your, you know, whatever your version of the meet and greet is, you  just want to boil yourself in Purell?  Dude, meet and greet, it's me whoring, I should be Scatman Crothers, I'm fucking singing  Minnie the Moocher and selling merchandise. 
[02:16:00]  As they walk out, I'm always out there taking photos and selling stuff, so I kind of meet  and greet as they leave, and I do Purell my hands, because you get a lot of handshaking.  Ah, yeah.  And here's the worst part, when you take photos of people, I always, no matter how big they  are, I put my arm on top of theirs, because there's nothing worse than the hot fucking  pit of a man on your shoulder.  Oh, my God, you know what, I can't help but freak out about it, you see people are like,  they're already a little bit trepidatious about meeting you, so you see like people coughing 
[02:16:30]  and their sweaty hands rubbing together, but I'll always catch the guy who's like, got  his hand jammed down his pants, adjusting his...  Oh, motherfuckers.  ...out of nervousness, and then he comes out with the hand outstretched, and you're like,  nah, man, we're going to pound it out, man.  Yeah, you just want to pound.  Greatest invention ever was to pound out.  Yeah.  Greatest invention.  What you've got to do is, like Obama, just have people Purell before they shake your  hand.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, with the president now, probably, so A, you can't poison them, and B, so it's just  cold, yeah.  Yeah.  I wear latex gloves. 
[02:17:00]  Is that weird?  Oh, like deli gloves?  Yeah.  For the big asbestos welding gloves or something, don't even let them touch you.  I want to touch you a bit.  Hey, are you, you know, obviously we know the update on what was going on.  You know, with your brother and stuff like that.  Are you satisfied with that resolution?  It's still not actually totally, completely over.  I mean, I'm very happy that he, you know, came forward and did the right thing and admitted, 
[02:17:30]  you know, guilt.  But the wife still is going through, I think today, actually, she's doing her plea hearing  today.  So it's moments away from being completely, you know, out of my life, which is great.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, really great.  Is there any shot at you getting back, what was the, say, missing?  Well, yeah, I did get a lot of it back.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And we found a bunch of investments and stuff.  So I got to begin that process now of kind of going through, you know, everything that 
[02:18:00]  was, you know, compiled and whatever that means.  So it's something else that I got to really look into this year.  But thankfully, we did recover a lot.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Good, man.  I'm happy to hear that.  All right.  Yeah.  Will you ever forgive him?  I mean, that's a weird question.  It's a good question, actually.  It's your brother you trusted.  And wow.  I mean, how?  You know, it's really, you know, it's a lot to process.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  It's just ending now.  Right.  So that's a question probably for down the line.  Sure.  Does it make it harder to, like, answer it in one of my series of nine books?  Does it make you look at other people differently, like the trust you have in friends or girlfriends  or whatever, like anybody is capable of betrayal?  You know what?  It actually didn't.  It didn't.  It's part of, like, kind of having to understand what this was.  But, you know, after a little while, it just kind of sank in of, like, okay, now I know 
[02:19:00]  how he did it and I know why he did it, which I can't, you know, kind of get into the nuts  and bolts of it now.  But you do realize that this person was really, you know, when you see underneath what he did,  you're like, okay, this person's just, this person's really sick.  Jesus.  Yeah, so no, it did not rock my trust long term.  But at first, yeah, at first you look at everybody a little differently.  Yeah, I always find it hard, especially with, I mean, in my level of finances, it's a lot 
[02:19:30]  different, so it's a little easier for me to keep an eye on.  But it's like, even with my agents, I'm fucking so paranoid, man.  I look at every, I'm sure you do now, too, but it's like I just find myself looking at  every single thing very carefully.  That's why it's twisted.  You feel like you could, you know, trust your family members.  Even that I wouldn't.  I love my family, but it's like, it's just, I'm too paranoid, man.  I'll tell you right now, it's like, and not to turn this into like Suze Orsman, but it's 
[02:20:00]  like anybody who comes to me and says, like, what do you, you know, how do you prevent this  from happening?  And it's so simple and it's something I didn't do.  You just need two people to look over your finances.  You need one person to check on another person.  And it's really that simple.  If you have two people, the chance is the odds of like two people doing this to you who  don't know you, finagling with your books and all that.  And so that's it.  You know, you got to have, you know, you got to sign everything yourself and you need two  people to, you know, make sure that.  The dealer watches the players. 
[02:20:30]  The pit boss watches the dealers.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  That's pretty much it.  Three Hill is my new.  Yeah.  Hey, do you find, do you sign everything now, too?  Because I was always scared to give any power of attorney to anybody, like even my, any  tax checks or any of that, anything, whatever it is, I always, it has to come through me  first.  Did you take that back and make sure you do that?  Actually, I have a contest.  It's called my daily power of attorney contest.  I hand over the books to somebody on Twitter and I let them just have a go. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  No, I definitely do.  Yeah.  I absolutely do.  Hey, have you, Twitter, you have a lot of Twitter followers.  My space, you're kind of, you've always been at the kind of the forefront with comedians  always look at Dane like, motherfucker.  That's what he's doing, right?  Yeah, because you, you always seem to have the, uh.  He was ahead of the whole thing.  He was ahead of everybody on the, on the technology and had to be really smart with  that, with MySpace and then everybody was just kind of playing catch up.  Have you, have you kind of abandoned MySpace and gone to Twitter and Facebook? 
[02:21:30]  Well, you didn't mention the fact that I was also the first person to show my penis on  chat roulette, which I'm very proud of as well.  Oh, is that what, is that one of the chat programs?  Oh, chat roulette rules.  Maybe so.  I'm the first to ever be screen cap jerking off by nine different people.  Yeah, man, I know, I, you know, you know me, I've always been kind of tapped into that  stuff and, and, you know, continue to, I just think they're all great ways of, again,  keeping in touch with whatever that core fan base is.  So, you know, whether they come and go, I know MySpace is kind of making a, a comeback 
[02:22:00]  and stuff and they're integrating with Facebook right now.  They, they basically just kind of joined at the hip.  So it's cool because it melded those two, uh, you know, pretty vast fan bases together.  So, yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll definitely continue to use those things as a way to kind of get  the word out.  And, uh, really fast too, you're going to be on Broadway, huh?  I'm doing it.  Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it.  I've wanted to, I've wanted to play Broadway for a lot of years.  So I'm coming, uh, I'm moving back there to New York city in the spring and I'll be,  you know, probably spending about six months doing, uh, this Neil Labute play called Fat 
[02:22:30]  Pig.  What is that about?  It's, it's brutal, man.  If you know anything about Labute, if you've ever seen the company of men, I don't know if  you guys, no, no idea to be honest.  Don't know.  Neil Labute is, uh, he's just, uh, this incredible modern playwright, man.  It's a dark comedy and it's caustic and this kind of twisted, uh, morality tale about our  obsession with, with weight, uh, people's weight and image in this country. 
[02:23:00]  And, uh, it's just one of the, one of the wildest characters that I've ever had the opportunity  to play.  So I look forward to it.  And, uh, so it's like a real, uh, it's a real acting gig.  That's fucking great, man.  Uh, we are, we got a job.  Lee Majors is here.  Um, we have, we have this, we have Lee Majors in studio.  We got the $6 million man today there, Dane.  That's pretty cool, man.  That's great.  All right.  So the big plug, the CD's out, uh, now I did my best greatest hit CD from Dane Cook.  Uh, double CD with new material.  Yeah, 10 minutes of new material available now on CD, iTunes, Amazon, all the, all the familiar 
[02:23:30]  places, right?  You know what?  Yeah, guys, you got it.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Thanks, Colin.  All right.  We'll see you when you're in New York, Dane.  Okay.  Later.  Take care.  Bye.  Thanks, man.  Dane Cook.  This is a lot of guests today.  It's great.  Oh, my God.  It's like people saying it's like, um, the Merv Griffin show.  Yeah.  That's how he did it though.  Merv Griffin had like, just, they never, they, they, you know what I mean?  It was.  No, they do with our sexual preferences.  Let's just bring him in.  Where is he? 
[02:24:00]  Where is he?  He was still signing in.  Oh.  Oh, he's downstairs.  Yeah.  He's on his way up.  Okay.  I could probably take a piss.  Let's take a break then.  I thought he was right outside of Jesus.  We'll do a quick break.  Oh, I know.  I'm just here for the ride, folks.  We'll have Lee Majors next.  And are we doing the $10 every time you say it?  Uh, we're going to try to make him say what.  Or huh.  Or huh.  Or pardon.  Pardon.  Any of those.  Or I can't hear what the fuck you're saying.  And I'll give up $10 every time that happens today.  Yeah.  I'm just ugly.  You sure are. 
[02:24:30]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN3 Show.  Dude, dude, dude.  We kind of rushed Dane Cook off the phone.  That wasn't on purpose.  No.  We thought Lee Majors was right behind us.  And, uh, we knew Lee didn't have much time.  What do you mean by that? 
[02:25:00]  Well.  Literally.  Here comes the $6 million man walking down the hall.  That's him.  That's him, all right.  How can you tell?  Well, because it looks like him.  Which one is he?  He's right there.  Is that him right there?  That's him.  Oh, that's him.  I see him.  How cool is that?  That is very cool.  That's Lee Majors.  There he is.  Hello, Lee Majors.  Lee Majors in studio.  Very cool.  This is awesome.  I am.  Pleasure.  How are you?  That is fantastic. 
[02:25:30]  Jeez.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  We grew up watching you.  We sure did.  Like everybody else in this country.  Thank you.  Amazing.  $6 million man.  You look great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Are you a healthy eater?  Like a healthy, or do you just genetics have been good to you?  Listen, if you've done as many action shows as I've done, you run your butt off,  you stay in shape.  Oh, yeah.  You know, he's done some action shows, Jimmy.  That's for sure.  Did you do all your own stunts or a lot of them?  Probably about 80% of them.  We ask that because Tom Cruise is doing all his own stunts and doing some crazy things 
[02:26:00]  lately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, you have guys that protect you, that set these stunts up, and they know  what they're doing.  So I never did anything without having an expert there.  Was there one you wanted to do and people just said, look, you're too valuable to us.  There's one that I didn't want to do that I ended up doing.  Oh, which one?  It's a long story.  Too long?  It's something to do with the tram in Palm Springs up on the cables.  Oh, wow.  Going from one tower to the middle of the tower is where a car was stuck with a bunch, supposedly 
[02:26:30]  a bunch of kids in it.  And to go those, to walk those, to get those, get there was tough.  And which show is this for?  Six Mill.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's what we're talking about there, because the big box set is out.  Wow.  This thing weighs.  It's a big box set.  That is a big box set.  And of course, when you open it up, you hear the very familiar opening of the show.  Yeah.  Do you ever get sick of being associated with that role, or are you happy to do it better? 
[02:27:00]  Because it's like sometimes actors are like, all right, I did that role, and then I moved  on.  Well, I moved on, because I did another series right now.  Fall Guy was huge.  Fall Guy was huge.  So I forgot about it.  And then I went on.  I've done about seven or eight series, and I keep very active doing it.  So I don't really think back about it until people bring it up.  But I did do the Fall Guy, mainly to see if I could rid myself of some of that, you know,  being put in that box. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  That box.  The box.  Right, right.  Just to see if you could...  It really didn't work all that well as I thought it would.  Sure.  But it's not a bad place to be, being known for, you know, the $6 million man.  And the Fall Guy was huge.  I mean, that show was huge.  The Fall Guy was five years, and they wanted to do another year of that.  But I kind of got a burnout right at that period.  Yeah.  And I needed to get away and take a break.  So I did.  Like from the whole business or the show itself?  I walked away for about ten years.  Damn.  I went to Florida and played a lot of golf. 
[02:28:00]  You know, it's amazing, because through the reruns and stuff, no one really was like,  hey, where's Lee?  It was just kind of like you were always on television.  You go away, but you're still on TV.  That's why I think I was getting burned out, and I was afraid the audiences might be getting  burned out with me.  What did that feel like, the burnout?  Were you just tired, or were you kind of like...  I was just physically and mentally tired.  I just kind of wanted to get away from L.A., Hollywood, and that thing. 
[02:28:30]  And that's what I did.  I went to Fort Lauderdale and stayed for about ten years.  Now, the time you were on TV doing Six Million Dollar Man and The Fall Guy, there was a lot  of partying going on in Hollywood.  Did you ever get caught up in any of that?  Listen, when you're working as much as I was, you know, you're doing 12, 13, 14 hours  a day.  I was living on the lot.  I had an apartment at Universal for Six Mill and one at 20th Century Fox for The Fall  Guy.  And I only went home on the weekends. 
[02:29:00]  And so, you don't get out as much as people think, you know?  It's not like doing a half-hour comedy and then go beat Charlie Sheen, you know?  Yeah.  Plus, you know, let's put it this way.  Back then, you know, people, they weren't on top of you as quickly as they are now with  the internet and the TMZ, and you can't do anything without right away your own...  It is amazing how much longer it took to get that personal information.  It was usually through the rag magazines that you'd see at the superpockets. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, and they say it takes them weeks to print them up.  Yeah.  And a lot of it, people would just, you know, take it tongue-in-cheek, like, really?  Is that what...  Yeah.  You couldn't really believe them for the most part.  Couldn't really believe them because it was next to the issue of Bat Boy and things like  that, flying saucers and whatnot.  So, what do you think about the paparazzi these days and just the need of people to want  to know every aspect of a celebrity's personal life?  I don't know because, you know, I'm not a computer person and I'm not online.  I don't do any of that stuff. 
[02:30:00]  And it's amazing because, you know, I remember when we were working so many hours out on location  and to get to a phone you had to hopefully get a driver to find a pay phone within 10  miles so that you could make a phone call.  Yeah.  So, you know, and today these kids are just texting every second.  It's just amazing.  It was also, we had talked about the accessibility to celebrities now because in the old days  you had to physically write a letter to that celebrity and hope they read it and sent something 
[02:30:30]  back to you.  Now, through various texting and Twitter and websites and whatnot, you really do have this  accessibility to celebrities that you never had before.  And I think it does open up celebrities to more of their private life being out in the  open.  Also, I think, you know, with so many reality shows, you know, back then, let's face it,  we only had three networks, three major networks.  Maybe the fourth one was barely coming in.  Get up and change the channel.  Now you've got, you've got so many channels and it's, it's just ridiculous. 
[02:31:00]  But, but, you know, some of these kids, they go on a reality show and, uh, overnight they're  a star and, uh, and then now they're on the, uh, red carpet to rehab.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then overnight they're not a star and they realize, uh, it's a little fleeting and  just paying your dues.  Yeah.  How hard was it being who you are and you were married to, to Farah, who was just, you know,  America was in love with and to have, to be in that high profile type of a situation. 
[02:31:30]  And then when it comes to an end, the whole country kind of knows, was that, was that  something that was difficult to deal with?  Like the country kind of focusing on your, you know what I mean?  Is that a difficult thing to deal with?  Like I say, it still wasn't as bad as it could be today.  Could be today.  I imagine today.  Brad and, uh, Jennifer Aniston thing or whatever.  Yeah.  Uh, but, uh, being that we both had, uh, hit shows around the same time, that was, uh, but  that's, that's one of the things that makes it difficult in this business.  You know, we, we were together for quite a while, but then I saw her two weeks in one 
[02:32:00]  year, uh, due to career jobs.  Wow.  So, you know, just, uh, separation is not good for this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That does seem to be something.  And you were able to reconcile, right?  Which was, it's, it's, it's rare in life that you get to reconcile with somebody.  He went about 23 years not talking to her, right?  And then she was, you got to talk to her before she, uh, passed.  Uh, you know, it's funny in that you'd think you'd see people in that town, but you don't.  And, and you go about your business and you don't think about it.  And, uh, of course I met a wonderful lady, uh, 16 years ago and I've been married for  16 years now with a beautiful, uh, girl of faith. 
[02:32:30]  I keep the faith now.  That's great.  So I'm, so you were at least able to, I guess, to reconcile, which is, it's nice to be able  to do that when, when somebody is not, you know, when somebody is sick.  Well, ours was a very friendly thing.  It was just very amicable.  It was just, you know, it's like, we just don't have the time for this right now.  So, you know, yeah, that, that would have to be crazy too.  Just the, uh, it wasn't like texting, getting caught texting and stuff like that.  Right, right, right.  I do remember the, uh, it was a very public, it wasn't a Brett Favre kind of thing. 
[02:33:00]  No, no, no, nothing like that.  Let's be honest.  If I was packing that small, I wouldn't be sending that out to people.  Brett Favre.  That was the first mistake he made.  Yeah.  How cruel you are.  Brett kind of, at least, at least use one of the enlarged features on the camera.  What are you doing, Brett?  You're a Hall of Famer.  What are you, a rookie?  It was though, you, you were in all of those magazines though, uh, all those years ago.  Yeah, but you know, I, some of them were, I kept a pretty clean reputation.  Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, I'm proud of the fact that I, I, I kind of kept my nose clean and 
[02:33:30]  just did my work, you know, that was most important.  If you don't, if you don't do your work and, uh, you could kill yourself in that business  really quick because the word gets around if you're doing this or that and you won't work.  Yeah, you see, uh, a lot of actors these days kind of, uh, of course, you know, today it's  a completely different ball game as far as, yeah, well also you got, you know, guys on  the production staff with their cell phones and they got the cameras and now they're catching  actors having a temper tantrum, fights with directors and, uh, you know, overnight you're, 
[02:34:00]  you're, uh, difficult to work with.  Yep.  You know, it's, uh, again, I think there was a lot more discretion back in the, uh, back  in the day where, where, uh, yeah, you, you didn't have the crew pretty much ratting you  out for, for things that you're doing.  It's a, it is amazing these days.  Yeah.  Would you consider yourself a sex symbol in those days?  I mean, you see, it seemed like you had the, I never considered myself a sex symbol 
[02:34:30]  anytime.  No, no, no.  Well, the ladies did though.  I was always kind of with one lady, so I never really, uh, yeah, it was out there  that much.  Was the temptation hard?  Cause I mean, I, I find it hard to resist and I very rarely have opportunity.  No, no, it wasn't that hard.  You get used to it, I guess.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you look back at, uh, the six million dollar man?  Cause the box set is out now.  Um, yeah.  Can we talk about that?  Sure.  It's the complete collection. 
[02:35:00]  Uh, open it up again.  Steve Austin.  It's, uh, wow.  How many shows did, uh, did you do?  Well, there's 40 DVDs in that.  40 DVDs.  40 DVDs.  Yes.  Well, we did 100 episodes.  Wow.  Five years, five seasons.  Yeah.  And there's six movies in there.  We did three, uh, movies, pilot movies before we went to series.  Then we did three reunion movies after we went off the air.  So that's, it's quite a package and, uh, you know, you can't get it in the stores. 
[02:35:30]  It's not available in the stores.  It's only going to be available online.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  On six, sixmdm.com.  Sixmdm.com.  Yeah.  It's just a wonderful Christmas, uh, package.  And you know, I think, I think a lot of families, uh, that, that, uh, the fathers who grew up with it will show it to their kids because it's, it's, it's, it's one that you can sit down with your kids and watch, you know?  Yeah, absolutely.  We didn't, we didn't, we didn't kill anybody.  We didn't have a lot of blood.  We didn't, you know, it's not like the violent stuff of today.  Right.  Blow up stuff and you got to shoot somebody. 
[02:36:00]  These videos are so, so violent.  I, I, if I had a kid today, I wouldn't, uh, I'd be really watching what they're.  Really?  Do you think that that's changed over time as you got older or, or do you think that's just how you always felt?  It's me personally, yeah, I just still from old school, you know, I grew up watching Roy Rogers and Gene Autry.  Those are my heroes.  And the guy in the white hat always, always won.  I remember the episode of a fall guy when they all get started with it. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we, uh, we did a quick, uh, scene where we were coming out of the old saloon and get on the horses to chase the bad guys who drove off in a Jeep like we're going to catch them.  And, uh, Roy had the two, uh, pearl handled guns on it in his holster, which was very heavy and had trigger lined up there at the corral.  So we, we, uh, ran and we, uh, I jumped up and, and I'm swinging over and I'm watching to see if he's okay because you don't want to take off before the other guy.  Right, right.  Keep the shot close.  Plus, you know, once you get on one horse and it goes, the other horse wants to go automatically. 
[02:37:00]  The other horse wants to go, right.  So anyway, he, he missed his stirrup and, uh, and he looked at me and he said, Lee, I think my spring has sprung, but we did it again.  And we were riding out of town and I'm, I'm, I'm looking over and saying, man, I'm riding next to Roy Rogers and I'm after the bad guys.  I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  It was legitimately like your old, old heroes.  Yes, definitely.  And then to be able to do that on the show.  I remember that one.  That was a good episode.  What was the, what was the first gig you landed when you got to Hollywood? 
[02:37:30]  Like the first thing you auditioned for and actually got.  Um, well, uh, embarrassingly, the first piece of film I ever did, no, it wasn't porn.  It was, uh, it may sound like, no, uh, I did a movie called straight jacket.  I played Joan Crawford's, uh, husband and, uh, in my little town in Kentucky, uh, it came from all the hollers all around down to this little theater on the marquee.  It said, starring Lee Majors in straight jacket, also starring Joan Crawford. 
[02:38:00]  And I packed a little theater, you know, and, and she chopped my head off with an ax before the credits came on.  And, uh, that was the end of me.  That was your starring role.  Oh, that was my, that was it.  And then, of course, there was a couple of other, uh, guest spots I did where I got killed.  Uh, Alfred Hitchcock, I got killed as a race car driver.  I did the gun smoke and Jim Arness shot me in the, in the middle of the street. 
[02:38:30]  I never saw him.  He was in Hawaii.  Oh, really?  It was, uh, later on.  He had been on that show so long that he, they had a double that would shoot over his back onto me, right?  So, and I would do my part with this double and, uh, and get killed and fall in the streets.  Well, he'd fly in from Hawaii a month later and stand there and they'd get a shot of him back the other direction and a closeup.  And he'd fire his gun and that was it.  He'd go back to Hawaii, you know. 
[02:39:00]  That's about the way he did all these shots.  Must be nice.  Yeah.  Hollywood magic.  So how was Joan Crawford?  Cause you, you hear like, you know, that she was very difficult.  Was she pleasant to you or what would you see?  Like, she was a very, very tough lady.  Uh, she had to have the set at about 48 degrees or, or lower because she didn't want her makeup to run.  So all the crew people were wearing their parkas around and you could see the breath coming in.  Wow.  She was married to, uh, she was married to a guy who was the head of PepsiCo.  PepsiCo.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, they had a machine, but you still had to put 20 cents. 
[02:39:30]  To get the, to get the, to get the pop.  Did anybody say to her, Hey, Joan, it's cold in here?  No.  Nobody said anything to her.  Probably not.  No, no.  How were you with, when you, when the $6 million man was by far the biggest show on television, um, did you remember those moments and like try to be nicer to the crew?  Like, yeah, that was kind of.  Yeah, I learned.  I learned.  I also worked for another tough lady, Barbara Stanwyck.  And, uh, she, she was really more my mentor than anybody else. 
[02:40:00]  And I learned to be on time.  I want to tell you, be on time, know your lines and, and keep your mouth shut when you, unless you talk, talk to.  Did you make the error of being late?  I forgot you were on that show too.  No, you kind of, when you're working around someone, you kind of, uh, you absorb everything you can.  And she knew that I was doing that.  And she kind of took me under her wing and, uh, made it very nice for me.  She helped me a lot.  I forgot you were on that show.  Yeah.  That was.  We were doing the movie after the first of the year, uh, the big Valley as a theatrical.  Yeah, big Valley.  I went in to meet the producer and director and I said, I guess you want me to play my original part. 
[02:40:30]  And, uh, you know, they said, no, you want you to play the father of your original part.  That's full circle coming around there.  Yeah.  So I will start that next year.  That was it.  I remember.  Yeah.  You were, you were, uh,  you were pretty young in that.  How old were you?  23.  Working with Barbara Stanwyck.  Can I, can I get back to the $6 million man?  Because Steven S from Bayshore is a huge fan of the show.  Yeah.  And I want to see if this is true.  He says, during the filming of an episode of the $6 million man, one of the carnival dummies turned out to be a mummified criminal. 
[02:41:00]  Is that true?  That's correct.  It was discovered when someone broke off its arm and saw bones inside.  Yeah.  It was me.  Well, it wasn't exactly me.  I was with a guy, a makeup guy, and we were, we were wandering around this.  It was going to be a haunted house kind of thing down in Long Beach.  And we're wandering around, and it was kind of dark.  And we hit this, one of the guys hit this guy, the mummy's arm, and it kind of fell off.  And it was, it looked so real like a bone.  So anyway, we had to tell somebody we broke it.  So they, that's when they found out, and they checked it out, and it was a real, um, a guy. 
[02:41:30]  And I guess, I think he was a bank robber from Oklahoma.  It turned out after they researched it.  So.  Wow.  That was kind of spooky.  That is kind of creepy.  A little bit.  Would you say the Bigfoot episode is the biggest one of the six?  That's the one.  Yes, I would say he was the biggest guy I ever ran up against.  Everybody remembers that.  That was Andre the Giant.  Andre the Giant, the wrestler who played that.  And, uh, I remember it was, uh, it was, uh, 110, uh, in the sun.  And we were out in the woods, and we were to do this big fight with him. 
[02:42:00]  And he had a six-pack sitting by his chair, which he would, before the shot, he would grab a beer and just down it and crush the can.  Down the next one.  He did the whole six that way.  And I said, okay, let's get this shot.  So I'm going over, and, uh, yeah, nice.  Oh, that's the mummy.  Anyway, I was going over, and, uh, he was supposed to pick me up and toss me a little bit.  Well, he picked me up and tossed me about 10 yards.  Wow.  And I'm laying there.  And I, and then he's got to come and run and just dive and land on me. 
[02:42:30]  And I'm there thinking he's going to crush me.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, the sun disappears.  It's a black cloud, and here he comes.  And I'm, I'm, I'm squinching up and waiting for it.  He didn't touch me.  He did not touch me.  Oh, you used some of his wrestling prowess.  Yeah.  Yes.  He didn't touch me, but, you know, and then I, I watched him all day, and he never went to the bathroom.  I couldn't understand.  Well, he had a suit on, so.  Maybe he was going in the suit.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I wouldn't want to dry clean that thing.  No.  He was, he was legendary for his drinking, too.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  That guy knew how to put down his beers.  A six-pack, that was just.  That was nothing.  Yeah, he was just getting started with that.  Of course, I guess his kidney was the size of a basketball player.  It had to be.  Did you, what were your feelings when they, you were doing so well with the six million dollar man that they decided to bring on the bionic woman and make that into a series?  Well, were you thinking like, it's kind of going to dilute what we're doing over here?  Well, let's, let's, let's go back to how that started, because I.  It started as a love story.  I did this six mil for a couple of seasons, and I hadn't had a love interest.  You know, and I told the producers, look, I'm tired of looking at these hairy leg guys walking around here. 
[02:43:30]  It's short, so I need to get a love interest on the show.  Yeah.  So that's when we wrote the thing that, about a former girlfriend, a pro tennis player, and brought her into the show.  And of course, it was well received.  And so we did another one, and then they decided to spin her off.  So, no, well, you know, it was, that one didn't bother me as much as then when they tried to do the bionic boy.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which failed, thank goodness.  Mr. Boy, I forgot about that. 
[02:44:00]  Then they came and they wanted a bionic dog.  Dog, right.  Max.  And I said, no, you take Max, that bionic dog, you take it over to Lindsay Wagner's show.  I'm not having a dog on my segments.  They wanted, wait, they wanted a bionic dog on your show?  Yeah, they wanted a bionic dog on the show.  And I said, well, not my show, you can take it over to Lindsay Wagner's show.  Yeah, take it over to Lindsay Wagner's show.  Plus wants to clean up after a bionic dog.  So you didn't, was her show ever on the same level as yours as far as popularity?  I don't think so.  Like, at that time at all?  Well, you know, we were on, we were on five years, and I think she was only on two seasons. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  So it didn't reach, reach, quite reach it.  But with, amongst girls, young girls and stuff, she was quite popular, yeah.  The Wonder Woman crowd, things like that.  What, did you, I'm sure you've had to field so many of the ridiculous logistical questions  of The Six Million Dollar Man, as one of such as, you only weigh so much, how can you hold back vehicles?  Your arm, bionic arm, has to meet flesh at some point, so why doesn't it just tear out? 
[02:45:00]  I mean, for years you've probably had to field those.  What do you usually say?  Theatrical license.  Okay, that makes perfect sense.  That's still, yeah, I answer you, God.  It's a TV show.  You know what would have been a great answer if you just took your coffee and threw it on him?  I would be honored, Jim.  Between that and going into bars and people, guys wanting to arm wrestle you, that was the worst.  I used to take it out of bars.  Oh, did you guys really want to do that? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  You want to arm wrestle?  It's a show, you idiot.  Yeah, it's not real, dummy.  Did you, when they went into the syndication, the deals were different for actors back then, too.  Like, do you guys at least see?  I make nothing.  Isn't that amazing?  I know.  And the word, the $6 million man has been used, that phrase, when they, even, but still further back, because now they make a heck of a lot more.  But you're talking about signing a football player or a baseball player.  Yeah, right.  The new $6 million man, you know, everything was $6 million.  I guess it's because it sounded good. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  So, I don't know, but I'm also happy, of course, the other thing is, I did have a piece of merchandising, and a little percentage of this or that, but, you know, Universal's got good accountants.  So, they were always in the red.  I don't think they've made a penny yet.  Never made a dime, right?  So, I've hired those accountants, and I haven't paid taxes in 20 years.  Yeah.  I just can't seem to make any money.  The doll, the $6 million man doll, though, I had that when I was a kid.  I mean, that was a...  Action figure.  Yes, come on. 
[02:46:30]  Come on, what's wrong with you?  It's not a doll.  You're right.  You played with dolls?  Well, maybe I did, but for you, it was an action figure.  It was an action figure.  Action figure.  Yeah, for me, my Barbie camper was empty.  I needed somebody in it.  Yeah, you're right, the action figure.  Yeah, G.I. Joe kind of sucked.  I always thought the $6 million man was better.  So, they obviously have you on board to do this, so hopefully they're taking care of you, at least, to help promote this box set.  Not really.  No, no, no, no.  I just wanted to do you guys' show.  I love you guys.  There you go.  That's fantastic.  I was going to do Oprah, too.  Are you really?  Yeah.  I was doing Oprah.  I'll be on Oprah tomorrow.  Is it her radio or TV? 
[02:47:00]  Television show.  I was just in Chicago with her.  It's a cute show.  I know you won't watch it, but you should.  I would watch it for you.  I would watch you on there.  That's how famous he is.  Oprah's a cute show.  I know.  Yeah, it's a cute little show.  Cute little show, that Oprah.  Absolutely.  She treated you well?  She treated me great.  She gives good interviews, though.  I don't like to.  I'm not a big Oprah fan, but she really knows how to get information.  Yeah, people feel compelled to, I think, open up to her.  She makes you comfortable.  Oh, sure.  Well, this was a surprise kind of thing, and it's just a fun show.  And Garth Brooks was there, and we had a great time with him. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, so we just blew the surprise.  He did a whole set.  Oh, really?  After the evening of the show was over, he did a set.  I mean, he...  The guy just likes to perform.  He's a sweetheart.  He's back in Vegas now.  Oh, really?  What was the theme of the show with you and Garth?  Was it...  Well, I wasn't connected with him.  It's kind of a surprise.  Okay.  I can't reveal it.  You'll just have to watch.  All right.  Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, we'll watch Oprah.  I should have pretended I didn't know what she was on.  You want to watch it together, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'd love to.  We can eat bonbons like a couple of sissies.  But I should have said, what is it, 3 or 4? 
[02:48:00]  But I was like, yeah, 4 o'clock, Oprah.  You're going to be on the channel.  Anyway, remember, guys, this box is not available in stores.  A lot of people are going to go down to the video store and say, where's the thing?  They're not going to find it.  Well...  It's only online for one year.  I think we should put it in stores, no, Lee?  Well, it will be probably starting next year.  Okay.  But I mean, a lot of...  Like, I would go down.  If I saw it's being released, I'd go down to the store and try to find it.  But you can't.  It's just...  Time Life has it for...  Licensed for a year.  Okay.  And are you doing commentary and all that on this, too?  Oh, there's 17 hours of bonus stuff on there. 
[02:48:30]  I did a two-hour interview.  I don't know what...  Wow.  And on there, it's probably stuff I probably shouldn't have ever said.  I just saw it the other day.  It's quite attractive.  What's the website that they go to to get it?  6MDM.com.  S-I-X.  Thanks for asking.  M-D-M.6MDM.com.  Do you spell out six, though?  S-I-X.  I can do the...  Either way?  The number six.  Oh, they were smart.  They got both?  That would be smart to do.  Okay, good.  Yeah, that's pretty easy to remember.  M-D-M.  If you can't remember Million Dollar Man, you're not going to know what to do at this bar. 
[02:49:00]  You're going to try to eat it when it comes in the mail, anyway.  Were there any scripts that you got that you read?  It's the number six, by the way.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's the number six.  Number six, M-D-M.com.  Yeah, speaking of...  Some scripts you just kind of went like...  Well, actually, this was one of them.  Really?  I was doing a lawyer series, Owen Marshall, Counselor Law University, and they sent me  down this script called Cyborg, and I read it.  And you've got to remember, at the time, Batman and Robin was a very pop show.  It was a very campy show. 
[02:49:30]  Campy, right.  Where they slam, bam, bam, all that with the fights and stuff.  And I'm reading this, and he runs 60 miles an hour, and he jumps to all buildings,  and I'm going, oh, I can't do this.  If you're thinking about doing a camp show, I'm out.  Right.  Anyway, that was quickly...  Of course, we did the first movie.  It was pretty right on, but we did have a...  It was maybe a little more edgy than it should have been, because we had a couple of New York  actors, Darren McGavin and Marty Balsam, which were really good New York actors in that. 
[02:50:00]  They played it very intensely.  And in the second movie we did, before we went to pilot, they changed the concept and  went more to the James Bond kind of feel.  And they even had a theme song, the Six Million Dollar Man song, and it was sung by Dusty Springfield,  and it was pretty jazzy.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should check out the second movie in there that has that.  Oh, wow.  And so I was getting a little... 
[02:50:30]  That song is probably incredibly bad.  I was getting a little embarrassed about the way the show was going.  You know, I would be at a cocktail party on the Riviera in a tuxedo, and I'd go to the  balcony.  I would look out and see a...  With a bionic, I'd see this yacht.  And so nobody's looking.  I would take my tuxedo off, turn it inside out, zip it up, and it's a wetsuit.  Wetsuit.  And I'd take this little thing about a couple of inches and put it in the mouth, and it's  supposed to make you breathe.  So I'd dive in and swim about 20 miles to the boat.  So it was a little too James Bond-y and gimmicky for me. 
[02:51:00]  So when we went to series, I said, look, the only way I'll do this is let's make him more  human.  Let's don't do the bionics every five seconds.  So just use them when they're needed and make the guy human and have some relationships  in the show.  So that's the way we went.  And apparently it worked.  How long until did you realize that this was a massive success?  When I finished it.  Oh, by the time you were done?  Yeah.  I wasn't out much during that time.  Really? 
[02:51:30]  You were just a busy guy.  I was.  Damn.  Yeah, I was busy.  Were they sad when you wanted to go, or was it a mutual parting of the ways, or were  you like, look, I can't do this now?  I think everybody had their feel of it.  I don't know if it had gone on any further at that point, but it was almost like the  show that would never die because we did three more movies after that.  You know, and I guess, you know, the last one we did, I mentioned this before, we did  an 89, one of the reunion movies, we tried to make another Bionic Woman with this little 
[02:52:00]  actress who guest starred for about 2,500 bucks for this two hour movie.  And that was Sandra Bullock.  Oh, wow.  And Sandra Bullock was there doing this stuff, and thank God it didn't go for her either,  so you see what happened to her, which, and it couldn't have happened to a better person.  She was just a sweetheart.  You knew she was going to be a major star.  And the movies are included in the box set?  Six movies.  Six movies in the episode.  Dude, this box set rules.  I didn't know that.  It is 50 pounds.  It's heavy.  Usually box sets suck. 
[02:52:30]  This is great.  It's got...  You could really crack someone over the head with it.  I wish there was an option to not make the noise, because I'm trying to open it, and  it just keeps talking at me.  It's like...  It's good if you're lonely.  Yeah, but it's bad if you're trying to watch this, and you don't want somebody to know  you're watching it.  It's like, what are you doing?  Nothing.  Steal.  Oh, there's shit.  Don't try to steal somebody's $6 million man.  Did I read somewhere where you didn't like the sound effects on the show, or the famous  do-do-do-do-do?  No, no, no.  They didn't bother me.  You know, when we first started doing the running part, they would speed the camera 
[02:53:00]  up, and it looked like the Keystone Cop running around.  It was so stupid looking.  Yeah, yeah.  We finally went to the slow motion, and adding those sound effects just gave it a more powerful  look.  Yeah.  It became sort of an iconic sound.  Where's that sound?  Here I went to the restaurant the other night down the street, and as I was walking through,  you hear the waiters going...  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, people always do that.  It really did become part of pop culture.  I take it as a compliment.  Yeah, it's one of those things that people just... 
[02:53:30]  If you do that noise, everybody knows what you mean.  Knows what you're doing.  Not that you would just walk around doing that noise.  That one might be a little silly.  Yeah, I do that while I'm having sex to make my girlfriend.  It's going better than it actually is.  It's going swimmingly.  Jimmy, what noise was that?  We can rebuild.  We can rebuild, yes.  What noise?  Well, with me, it would be we couldn't make him faster.  You know, because...  We're stronger.  Can you have the noise?  There you go.  It's like, that's my childhood.  Me sitting in front of the TV. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, look at you.  Fitting.  I can't say sitting.  You turned into the little kid again.  I'm the bionic ass.  I can't speak properly.  All right, so it's number six, MDM.com, for this box set.  They give you everything.  The pilot, TV movies, the entire series.  It's not some shit box set like a lot of them are.  This is the real thing.  It's got everything.  Is that their own slug line?  What?  It's not any shit box.  I actually took that out of the box.  Coming from you, that sounds great.  That's a compliment.  But no, people buy a lot of stuff, and it's just like, it's not what you want. 
[02:54:30]  This is fantastic.  It's got everything you need in there.  Very cool, man.  Very cool.  Good Christmas present.  Yeah, it's great.  Perfect.  All right.  Well, thank you so much.  We have the great Lee Majors.  Absolutely.  Lee Majors.  Just a thrill.  I've got to get a picture.  Okay.  No, he doesn't do photos.  No photos.  No photos.  No photos.  He doesn't like doing photos.  Thank you guys very much.  Thank you.  Lee Majors, everyone.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show, on the fire and mysterious XM. 
[02:55:00]  Steve from Albany, New York, writes, 70s day on O&A.  Walt Frazier, Lee Majors, and up next, musical guest BTO.  Ah.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.  That was cool, man.  I love the Lee Majors.  His wife is gorgeous.  I just sound like an old lady.  I didn't mean to say it like that.  Gorgeous.  His wife is gorgeous.  Yeah, she's a blonde, and she's sitting on his lap right now in a way that's making us all drool. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, she is gorgeous.  Wow.  Hi.  How are you?  She's waving at us.  Hey, hi.  Hi, everybody.  We're all waving like children.  She is beautiful.  That encourages me in show business.  It's like, if you work really hard...  That's what you get.  That's who you marry.  Wow.  Fantastic.  At least 71, man.  He looks younger, man.  He looks very good.  Looks good for 71.  But he looks like he doesn't take any shit either.  No guff.  No.  Yeah.  No.  He's like a fucking guy. 
[02:56:00]  I felt like at any moment, one of us could have got punched in the face.  Believe me, I didn't want to ask the wrong question.  We played it straight with the guy, but I felt at any moment it could go just horribly wrong.  Yeah.  Get that box set careened off the side of your fucking face.  Ah, that 50-pound box set right into your head.  He's not a fan of the media.  Nah, you can see.  He goes, ah, you're talking about Prince William, huh?  Big shit.  I've been watching westerns with him in it, and he's just kicking ass.  Oh, bullshit. 
[02:56:30]  No, I swear.  Guy who disagrees with everything.  But he was always, you know, the rough and tumble, go into the ballroom and just start kicking ass kind of guy.  How did he not know that he was so famous?  Maybe you just...  He was on a show when there were only like four channels, like he said.  So if you had a hit, you had a major hit on your hands.  And he goes, oh, I realized after the whole thing was done taping, which took five years.  Yeah, five years of that.  Well, maybe that's just not important to him.  And then the fall guy, and then he decided to get me the fuck out of Hollywood. 
[02:57:00]  Who was the girl on the fall guy again?  Wasn't that Heather Thomas?  Heather Thomas, that's right.  Was she in that one?  And she was...  That's right.  Doing a lot of drugs, a little bit of cocaine.  How do you know that?  Well, it was documented.  No, it wasn't Heather Locklear.  Heather Locklear was on TJ Hooker.  Shut up.  Same show.  Shut up, dummies.  That was the same show.  Yeah.  Same show.  Yeah.  Lee's just sitting out there. 
[02:57:30]  Should he finish the show with us?  I feel bad.  No, he's waiting for another interview.  In ten minutes.  He's staring at us intently.  Are you guys listening to us?  Oh, what was that?  Oh, that's my...  I opened up the wrong website, and it's got those bullshit cams.  Oh, I hate the fake ones.  Hi.  Yeah.  And you're looking at me, and you're like, hi.  Hi, are you real?  Hi, let me text you.  Are you talking to me?  Hello, madam.  And look, she's right here in my town.  Right. 
[02:58:00]  What a coincidence.  She's waiting for me.  I love the emails that you get like that, too.  Like, hi, saw your profile.  I don't have a profile.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  That would require a chin.  What's the new scam that is popping up like crazy?  Where a girl tells you that she doesn't have STDs up.  Where they say, these people are searching you right now, and it's always some hot fucking  piece of ass.  What's that scam?  I'm going to find one right now on my email.  The spam shit I get.  What is that scam all about?  It's so annoying.  Why am I getting all kinds of Facebook alerts? 
[02:58:30]  I hate that shit.  Because someone's going to...  No, but I usually have them turned off.  Is someone inviting you to a pillow fucking fight or something?  Have I been poked?  I don't know Facebook too much.  No, there's that new spam thing where it's like, hey, someone's looking for you.  Or, what is it for?  Like dick pills or something?  I don't know.  Check out the exciting happenings.  Hey, my best.  I just brought some products from a business site. 
[02:59:00]  It's like, who is this?  And they get your name and your email address and everything.  Are you getting a lot of solicitors on your cell phone these days?  Yes.  That has gone way the fuck up.  It's crazy.  My opening line now is kind of working a little bit.  Why are you calling me?  They don't have much of an answer for that.  Oh, look at this one.  See, here it is.  From Cheryl.  Oh, that's nice.  Let's talk to Cheryl.  In big caps, the subject, I have been trying to reach you. 
[02:59:30]  And then it says, congratulations, and there's my email address.  And then it says, President Obama pays you to go back to school.  Click here to see if you qualify.  I could get a Pell Grant, which provides up to $5,500 a year for me to go back to school.  Yay.  And other government programs.  You could get that diploma finally.  I could finally get that diploma and get a good job, a real job.  You think people are getting fucked over by Cheryl when the wife grabs your phone? 
[03:00:00]  Who the fuck is Cheryl?  Who is this?  Why is it?  Yeah, right?  And you have to explain, look, it's spam.  I'm sure it's spam.  And then if the wife doesn't understand, like, computers, you wouldn't be able to tell her  what spam is and it's junk.  Well, this Cheryl girl has to have had your email.  It's like, no, no, it's junk mail that comes in.  Oh, junk mail?  Like what?  It doesn't work.  And you couldn't explain it because she would be inept.  Wow, that is dangerous.  You think your ex would have been who the fuck is Cheryl? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because I don't think she was computer savvy.  She wasn't anything savvy.  She didn't want me to get a cell phone.  She wanted me to get a car phone in, like, the late 90s.  Who are you, Cannon?  Yeah, yeah.  Hello, mobile operator, get me 555.  I'll never forget, she got mad at me because I had a cell phone, which meant you had to  get a cell phone.  And I was late to the cell phone party.  I was real late.  She didn't want you to have a fucking cell phone.  We're wheeling and dealing.  We're becoming big radio stars in Boston.  We need cell phones.  We're wheeling and dealing.  And she was like, you're not getting a cell phone. 
[03:01:00]  She was probably right, because look what happened.  I forgot a cell phone and that was it.  No, uh, it was, but she wanted me to get a phone in my car.  What are you, Cannon?  Like, with the little pig-tail-y antenna that sticks on there.  What did you say?  What are you, Cannon?  It wasn't Cannon?  No, I just said that like a minute ago.  Oh, you did?  That's great.  I didn't even catch it.  That has to go into our We Don't Listen segment.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That'll go into We Don't Listen segment.  When did you use that reference?  Danny, how long ago? 
[03:01:30]  Oh, my God.  It had to be at least 87 seconds.  Oh, my God.  I got the biggest douche chills right now.  Lee Majors' wife is fucking really pretty.  Oh, she's a fantastic woman.  That's like, I can't stop looking now.  I know.  Something's going on, because they've been together, what did he say?  16 years.  She can't be more than 30.  She looks like 30.  What is Lee up to?  I think Lee was grabbing her out of high school.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Hey, I'm Lee Majors.  You want to come?  Lee's a bad boy.  Get my car.  Get my car.  How old do you think she is?  We're looking at her right now.  40 to 41.  Only because he's been with her for so long. 
[03:02:00]  I don't think so.  There's no way she's 41.  I don't see her.  Maybe 30.  She's in her 30s.  She might be 36.  Lee is 71, and he's been with her 16 years, and she doesn't even look 30, man.  Maybe she's 36 or 35.  Dude, she had to be 19, 20 years old when they hooked up.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Had to be.  Wow, what's that about?  What's that about?  Because he can.  Yeah.  That's why you hook up.  He always had hot women.  Ask her how old she is.  I'm dying.  How do we do it?  Lee's in another interview.  He'll never know. 
[03:02:30]  No, I'm not asking.  Danny's going to ask?  Ask how old she was when they got together.  That won't be an issue.  Oh, my God.  Is it going to be a door open or a door closed thing?  Door open.  Go ahead.  Quick.  You've got to be respectful somehow.  Yeah.  I was just.  Just say, how old were you when?  The guys are.  The guys are curious.  The guys love you.  The guys love you.  They just don't know.  And they're big.  How old were you when you.  Yeah.  And they're big Lee Majors fans.  And they're so happy that Lee's so happy.  When you got together with Lee.  So just got together or age now also? 
[03:03:00]  No, no.  Not age now.  We can do the math.  We'll do the math.  We can do the math.  We'll never do age now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you know she's going to lie about her age.  So we'll pad it.  We'll figure out the padding after the answer.  Go ahead.  Keep the door open.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Danny.  Come on.  Put her up.  The guys, they love the interview and everything.  They were just curious.  They don't like it on the air, but they were just wondering how old you were when you and Lee got together.  Well, at least he said he was 55.  When did that happen?  In the 20 zone.  So I was 20 and he was 25. 
[03:03:30]  20.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Lee Majors rocks.  Lee rules.  Lee rules.  He's our hero.  We love Lee Majors, boy.  Lee rules.  Did your heart just stop for a second?  Yes.  My heart just stopped.  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  She's 36.  He's 71.  Yeah, he was 55.  And she was 20.  She was 20.  That's great.  You've got to love Lee Majors.  Now we understand.  Lee Majors is my newest, bestest hero.  But now we understand why he didn't know how famous he was. 
[03:04:00]  He never left his house.  That's great.  Yes.  Thank you.  Damn, man.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Wait, he was 55.  She was 20, she said?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we know why he doesn't give a shit about anything.  She's ridiculous.  Oh, she's gorgeous, man.  That's crazy.  That's Lee Majors type fucking woman.  But that's what happens when you become...  That's like...  That's not an actor level woman.  That's like iconic...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...level woman.  He's part of America.  And she's not lying. 
[03:04:30]  You could DMV, IMDB her.  No.  She was born in 1974.  Was she in some movies and shit?  She was born when Six Million Dollar Man went off the air.  I think went off the air.  God damn, come on.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, Lee is the king.  Yeah.  Look, I know...  He had Farrah Fawcett.  He has beautiful women, though, man.  They just like his vibe.  Yeah, but dude...  No, it's about this.  That's great.  And...  You think?  And the wallet.  You think it's about that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lee's packing.  You think Lee's packing?  Lee's got a fucking hog in his pants, man. 
[03:05:00]  Holy smoke.  Thank God that worked out well.  Danny was a little nervous.  She was cool, though.  Did you hear Danny, like, stumbling and...  You stumbled a little bit.  I was the one that asked.  The guys wanted to know...  Not on the air, but the guys wanted to...  It was perfect.  The guys wanted to...  It was funny as shit.  Holy shit.  It was a good one.  Lee Majors.  When did the Six Million Dollar Man go off the air?  I don't even know, but it had to be...  I had to be, like...  Just...  See, when it came on, it was five seasons, so... 
[03:05:30]  It was a 70s show, obviously.  It might have made 80.  I doubt it, though.  It might have.  I would guess 70...  I'm going to guess, like, 78 or 79.  Someone's saying, like, in 1980, they think it went off.  78.  $6 Million Dollar Man was off the air.  It ran from 74 to 78.  So, when it started, she was just born.  She was born.  She was born when he got the $6 Million Dollar Man job.  He's the best.  Just gives me encouragement.  Oh, it's fantastic.
