<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the upcoming release of a double CD compilation of their best (and most "cringe-worthy") moments, detailing their past negative experiences with Restaurant Records and exploring new label options.  Opie recounted his experience at a *Rocky Horror Picture Show* performance, highlighting the show's sexually suggestive nature and his own rather unmoved reaction.  Anthony shared a humorous story about his brother-in-law, Johnny Race, causing a scene at a restaurant by yelling "rock and roll!"  The anniversary of their infamous "Voyeur Bus" stunt was also mentioned, recalling the arrests that followed. A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to wildly speculative and comedic commentary about Al Gore's post-presidential life running a low-budget family restaurant in Tennessee, fueled by increasingly absurd listener suggestions.  Audio clips from past shows, including "Nutcracker Sweet" and a segment about "butt plugs," were played.

The show then transitioned into a segment heavily featuring listener calls, primarily revolving around the Al Gore restaurant fantasy and a contest for Britney Spears tickets.  Listeners offered ridiculous suggestions for the restaurant, including free wine with a mention of Al Gore's name and his driving a beat-up car. One caller even submitted a self-composed theme song. The Britney Spears ticket contest elicited increasingly outrageous and sexually suggestive suggestions from female callers,  including self-honeying and feathering, and propositions for tar-and-feathering involving nudity.  Callers' ages and number of children were frequently referenced.  The conversation devolved into graphic descriptions of lesbian and other explicit sexual acts.  The hosts recounted a past "Hunger Thon" incident where two women performed a sexual act on-air, distressing the priest event organizer, as well as other past incidents including an on-air vasectomy and the consumption of a piece of excised vas deferens on a cracker.  They also discussed charities refusing their donations. A story about a caller revealing to his son that there is no Santa Claus was played.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Britney Spears contest, the hosts' frustration with caller participation, and comments on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and New York City traffic. A sound clip of a prior "Sex for Sam" segment was also played.

A phone call with Jerry "The King" Lawler followed.  Lawler discussed his WWF reinstatement, the comedic and controversial nature of recent WWF segments (particularly involving him and Jim Ross), and his strained relationship with Vince McMahon, including playing audio clips of their vulgar exchanges.  Lawler also talked about his attraction to younger female wrestlers, leading to jokes from the hosts about him getting into trouble with women.  The show then shifted to promoting Jim Brewer's stand-up shows, with Brewer calling in to share humorous anecdotes, including one about building security.  Brewer's conversation involved numerous vulgar jokes and offensive comments about airport security post-9/11, his comedy routines, and his offensive perspectives on terrorism and different ethnic groups.  The "Sex for Sam" contest continued with graphic descriptions of sexual acts from female callers.  Further discussions of Brewer's comedy shows, more outrageous listener calls detailing sexual acts, and more anecdotes from Brewer about his time at *Saturday Night Live*, including stories about Norm Macdonald and Chris Kattan, featuring vulgarity and offensive jokes, followed.

A later segment featured Jim Brewer as a guest in the studio. The conversation, filled with vulgar language and offensive jokes, covered Brewer's stand-up career, including anecdotes about a poorly received autograph and a joke about gay pride parades.  They recounted a story about a practical joke gone wrong involving Opie punching Brewer's comedy partner, Paul, in the face.  The segment included "What I Learned Today" listener calls featuring crude and offensive statements, a discussion of a movie scene involving a hooker, and the "Mommy, What Would You Do For Britney Spears Tickets?" contest. A Norm Macdonald clip was played.  The show concluded by promoting Brewer's upcoming performances, Carlos Mencia's appearance on the following show, and an Ozzy Osbourne ticket giveaway.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  West Coast Dave sums it up with this.  I've heard this bit a dozen times.  It still makes me cringe every time.  Yeah, there's that distinct sound a man makes when he gets kicked in the nads like that.  And he made it.  That's our version of the Nutcracker Sweet Anthony.  And I'm proud to say that you can find that on a CD.  Yes, yes.  That's our contribution to the WBCN Naked Disc. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Boston putting out another fine CD.  Check out the bands on this CD.  Incubus, Moby, Radiohead, Lenny Kravitz, Tantric, Limp Bizkit, Weezer, Adima, Kid Rock, Godsmack, Blink-182, Papa Roach, Disturbed with Stupify.  Yeah.  And then bonus track, Stephen Lynch, our buddy and pal doing Lullaby, which is a hilarious song.  And finally, you and I with the Nutcracker Sweet. 
[00:01:00]  Very proud to be on the WBCN Naked Disc.  Matter of fact, we're so proud.  We're going up there Saturday.  We're going to sign these like crazy at Newberry Comics.  Yes.  Come on down.  Hope to see a lot of old faces and a lot of new faces when we're in Boston this weekend.  Okay.  In Natick.  In Natick, right.  That is a great, great bit.  I love that one.  Yeah.  And it just makes me want to put out a CD, Ant.  Yeah, we got to put out a CD of our stuff.  We haven't done it in quite a while. 
[00:01:30]  We got close here.  Putting one out.  We got close.  We're going to look at it again.  And I think by spring we're going to have hopefully a double CD out.  Yeah.  And it's all going to be based on cringe.  Yes.  Cringe, cringe, cringe, like the Nutcracker Sweet.  Telling people that their friends died.  All that fun stuff you know and love.  Maybe hearing Cindy Williams being put in her place as a has-been.  That's like cringe radio.  We're going to have to go through, honestly?  Yeah.  A hundred and twenty.  How many CDs we have to? 
[00:02:00]  You can just yell it out, Rick.  About 200 discs.  We have about 200 CDs of our material.  Great.  And we got to knock it down to a double CD.  And I got to tell you, we need help with this one.  Yeah.  We want to put out a professional CD.  It would be very nice.  Of course.  Work with a professional record label.  Uh-huh.  A record label that'll pay us.  A record label that'll pay our charity.  Not the shysters we've worked with in the past? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I was hoping we'd hook up with them again.  Sorry to say we're not going to go with restaurant records this time around, Anthony.  Damn.  Sorry.  Damn.  What a great relationship we wound up having with them.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Well, they paid us at first for our Demental World CD.  Yeah.  And then that was it.  Yeah.  We made less than $10,000 each on that thing.  I should have known.  On a CD that sold like crazy, mostly in the Boston area and then in New York and then at 
[00:03:00]  this point all over the country.  Yeah.  And the owner of Restaurant Records decided one day that we were talking bad about him on  the air.  Yeah.  That he wasn't going to pay us anymore.  Even though the CD continues to sell.  Should have known when the other person he handles, Red Peters, you know Red, how's your  whole family?  Yeah.  He called the guy Owen Money.  He goes, his name's Owen.  Go, Owen?  I didn't think it was Owen.  I thought it was Steve.  He goes, no, Owen.  Owen Money.  Ha ha.  Look, that's comforting. 
[00:03:30]  Owen Money?  Right.  Yeah.  So, yeah, we hope to work with somebody a little better than that.  As soon as we can figure all that out, we'll finally move forward and get that double CD out.  Bobby Big Rigger's suggesting we put it on Sushi Records.  Sushi Records.  My Rot Guts label.  No.  Probably a better record label than Restaurant Records.  Oh, it was a label from the Chicken Effers yesterday.  Ah.  You can't remember, can you?  I can't remember already.  No, we want to go with one of the majors.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  Or how about one of the secondary majors?  Yeah.  One of the indies.  Yeah.  We'll go indie.  Yeah.  We're good enough for indie, right?  We'll go indie.  Uh-huh.  Subpop.  Is Subpop still around, Ben?  Yeah.  I thought so.  All right.  So, here we are.  We have a lot to do today.  Jim Brewer's on his way.  Great show last night at Irving Plaza.  Yeah.  We had a lot of fun down there.  I want to say hi to everyone we ran into.  All the freaks. 
[00:04:30]  Rock and roll.  Oh, my.  Rock and roll, Johnny Race.  Yeah.  Horrifying everybody.  I hear, um.  Your Brun-Law is insane, dude.  I know.  You guys really need to get him some help.  I know.  He's insane.  We see it.  We know.  We see it at holiday functions.  Johnny Rock and Roll Race is insane.  Right.  He's a crazy person.  Well, there was a restaurant right next to Irving Plaza.  What was the name?  Galaxy or something?  Galaxy.  Galaxy Grill.  Galaxy Grill.  Really hip place, Anthony.  Yeah.  Nice hip establishment. 
[00:05:00]  Uh-huh.  They take pride in their restaurant.  They take pride in their menu.  Uh-huh.  Different things on the menu.  They're trying new things, you know?  That's cool.  And the people that go to this place take pride in themselves.  Yeah.  And it's just one of those type of places, as you understand.  I hear you.  All the waitresses are like supermodels.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Got to go there, one of these.  It's all the beautiful people working at this place.  Okay.  So then your brother-in-law, Johnny Race, comes stumbling in. 
[00:05:30]  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll Johnny Race with his WOW t-shirt with the sleeves cut off.  That's Johnny.  His jeans that it looks like he hasn't washed them in a month.  Right?  What's my sister doing?  Isn't she doing the laundry?  Doesn't look like he washes his jeans.  And then he has the big chain.  Right.  That's connected to his wallet.  To his wallet and his keys.  Long Island thing.  It's okay.  I'm just saying.  And he comes in and we're kind of happy to see rock and roll Johnny Race, right? 
[00:06:00]  So then he sits at the bar.  And the place is packed.  Uh-huh.  Packed.  And he couldn't sit with our gang because it was crowded.  That's the only reason.  So they went up to the bar, him and his friend.  And out of nowhere, Anthony, I swear to God, Johnny Race turns around to this really nice establishment.  Uh-huh.  Gets up, puts both hands in the air, and screams, rock and roll!  Now, there's only one reaction that you have when a lunatic stands up in the middle of the restaurant and screams, rock and roll. 
[00:06:30]  You know something?  In some establishments, that's completely acceptable.  And it's, you know, you're in one of the hard rockin' bars, maybe, out there on Long Island or something.  You get it, you scream, rock and roll.  It's fine.  No one will notice.  But in an establishment like that, it's a little freak.  The people hit the deck because they think a robbery's in progress.  They think, like, you just scream, okay, this is a robbery! 
[00:07:00]  Any of you F.E. pigs move, and I execute every mother...  It's funny you bring that up, because I really thought it was, like, a Pulp Fiction moment.  I'm like...  Because you're like, ah, that's great.  That's what he's going to say before he guns down everyone, rock and roll?  Rock and roll!  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  So everyone turns around, and they're just horrified.  I mean, horrified.  That's great.  Ben is laughing.  Rock and roll!  Ben's laughing uncontrollably. 
[00:07:30]  Of course.  I mean, uncontrollably.  Because it's somebody else being...  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah!  It's somebody else being loud.  And then he sat down and started giggling like a schoolgirl for the next 20 minutes, because  he did that.  That's great.  That's Johnny Race.  Johnny Race.  Rock and roll Johnny Race.  Right!  Rock and roll!  And then at one point, he's telling Earl he'll give him oral treats for getting him tickets  It's the Eddie Trunks show.  Yeah, Earl.  The reunion of Twisted Sister that happened in New York last night.  Earl came through.  Earl, right? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't want to lie here.  What did Johnny Race say to you while you were sitting there?  You were very accurate.  But in all fairness, because, you know, you have a lot of family listening, Anthony.  I don't want them all to think that your brother-in-law is actually gay.  I must say that I set up Johnny Race.  Yeah.  But Johnny Race came to me and was like, man, I'll do anything, man.  This is unbelievable that he got me the tickets and stuff.  You sure you guys don't want around?  And as serious as it could be, I go, Johnny, I've got to tell you, Earl likes the mm-mm from going. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Did you say that?  Evil.  So then he went over to Earl and asked him.  So that was a lot of fun.  Wow.  And then we went inside Irving Plaza, and I've got to tell you, man, wow.  Brewer killed his stuff on what's going on in Afghanistan.  What's going on there?  Oh.  I don't know if he wants to do any of it on the air today, because, you know, he's got a sold-out show at Irving Plaza tonight, or close to a sold-out show. 
[00:09:00]  I think there's a few tickets available.  But the stuff he's doing on Osama and the war and stuff is just beyond hilarious.  I'm sure he'll talk about it a little bit.  Okay.  That's like he doesn't have to do exactly his act.  That's one thing about Brewer.  Get him in here and just start him talking on something.  He'll go off.  Yeah, he killed.  And I've got to give props to Pete Correale.  He killed last night, too.  I've seen him many, many times.  He's a really funny guy.  So that was my evening, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Well, I'm getting a couple instant feedbacks about my evening from Eric from Westchester.  Well, how was your little play?  Well, Eric, says Anthony, saw Anthony at Rocky Horror last night.  Went to see the Broadway production of Rocky Horror.  Norton, how are you doing?  All right.  How's that?  Joining the show today.  Oh, hi.  Yeah.  I remember you.  Says, saw Anthony at Rocky Horror.  He was stone-faced through the whole thing. 
[00:10:00]  Somehow I just could not, he could not get into the whole transvestite thing.  I thought it would have been otherwise, but I guess not.  I wasn't stone-faced through the whole thing.  There were a couple of moments I'm like, oh, my God, if any O&A fans are here and they see me looking at this.  At least I have my girlfriend with me, you know?  It's like, look, look, see, I'm with a girl.  But sometimes you do things in life and you're thankful that the girl's by your side.  Yeah.  To say, look, see?  Oh, here he is now.  Anthony, again, was that you at Rocky Horror, wasn't it? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Your girl's pretty cute.  How did she like the muscle man walking around in a jockstrap?  Yeah, well, at one point, can I interrupt you?  Yeah.  There was a reason you were stone-faced at Rocky Horror Picture Show.  You were out of your effing mind on NyQuil.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Very sick.  I've been medicating myself.  But, no, I enjoyed the show.  I enjoyed the show.  It was very good.  You got the guy that plays Frankie.  He looks just like Tim Curry and does the same inflections with his voice, has the same look to him. 
[00:11:00]  Very great singer.  And Sebastian Bach, you are now not the only person that has seen Sebastian Bach on Broadway.  You saw him in Jekyll and Hyde?  Jekyll and Hyde.  And I had to admit on the air that he did a really good job with it.  Yeah.  It wasn't my cup of tea, but I ended up there.  I had to admit it wasn't bad at all.  He was riff-raff.  And if anyone should sing Time Warp, it's Sebastian Bach.  He's got the voice.  He definitely did a great job doing that last night. 
[00:11:30]  And the narrator was Jerry Springer.  And he was being abused by the audience.  It was pretty damn funny.  You know how the audience chimes in with stuff?  Oh, yeah.  They were doing that, and they were just ragging him about his show all night.  And it was very entertaining, I must say.  Oh, here we go.  You're told.  What?  Yeah.  But there's at one point, you know, Rocky, Frankie's creation there. 
[00:12:00]  It's some big muscle guy.  And he's in this, like, coverall suit, and they hang him up on this round thing.  And he's got, like, tubes tied to him.  And at one point, they pull these tubes.  This tear-away thing he's wearing tears off.  He is wearing what amounts to a clamshell and string.  The guy, the guy, he's just, and there was some black chick in the back.  And the other one, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  She started freaking out at this guy.  She got her freak on.  Yeah, that man's a freak.  And there's Sebastian.  And, yeah, at the end or so, Sebastian comes out in a new costume.  He hadn't been wearing the whole other thing.  It's a kind of a one-piece stretchy thing where it was just, I wasn't calling him Sebastian Bach. 
[00:13:00]  It was Sebastian C.  Rhymes with Bach.  You get me?  Hello.  You were checking out the Bach?  The guy, he had no choice.  The Bach, Blank.  The guy walks out, and his junk is just, like, right there.  His junk hit the stage before he did.  Pretty much.  It's Sebastian Bach.  Ah.  Right there.  And all the girls are, whoo, you know.  He's playing to some of the girls in the front row.  And they're just creamy.  They were freaking out. 
[00:13:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  I see y'all.  That faggot from Tommy and Staten Island.  Thank you, the first faggot.  No, I would definitely recommend you go see that.  It was good.  Oh, look at you.  It was good.  And what am I going to say?  For the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  What am I going to say?  It was very good.  And I think, uh, I think, uh.  Better than Aida?  Better than Aida.  It's a little different.  That's right.  It's too many.  It's too many. 
[00:14:00]  So now you're saying rush out to see it.  Well, you know why?  Because it's in the context of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Lip-licking experience.  And they did a great job bringing it to Broadway.  I've got to say.  All right.  So, uh, yeah.  I would recommend it.  All right.  There you go.  So I went to see Brewer and went to see, uh, Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Jim, did you do anything exciting last night?  No.  Pick up a hooker or anything?  No, I didn't.  Nothing, huh?  No, I did a gig and it was uneventful.  All right.  Yeah, I saw Stephen Baldwin at, uh. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, you did?  The Jim Brewer Show.  With Stephen, uh, insane.  Man, you guys are so mean.  Oh, did he say that?  A million times.  I'm like, what?  You want us to kiss your ass?  Go on another show if you need your ass kissed.  Oh, okay.  That's all he kept on saying.  Man, you guys are so mean.  Well, what did he expect?  He came in here like a lunatic.  He was basically hinting, uh, do you realize I'm a, I'm a movie star and you guys were so mean. 
[00:15:00]  A movie star.  Slow down.  Your brother's a movie star.  Come on.  He had a good run there.  Come on.  What movies did he have?  Bio-Dome.  Bio-Dome.  Stop.  Do you consider Pauly Shore a movie star?  No.  He's, he's in movies.  I don't consider him a movie star.  I'm just thinking of the movies he was in.  Bio-Dome.  Bio-Dome.  Uh.  Threesome.  Fred Flintstone.  He was Barney Rubble in the second Flintstones movie. 
[00:15:30]  Ooh.  Didn't he have a bit part in Half-Baked, too?  I don't remember.  I think he might have.  I don't know.  No?  Someone help me out with that.  No?  What?  No?  Bit part in, uh, Half-Baked.  Ah.  I'll throw over with him.  Do you know Steve Sink?  Usual Suspects he was in, too.  He was in The Usual Suspects?  Whoa.  All right.  You know something?  I'm going to give it to him.  There you go.  Don't make him a movie star, but he just gained a lot more points in my book there.  That's a great movie.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  Biodome and Usual Suspects.  I know.  I hope you don't list them alphabetically on the resume.  Jeez.  It's almost like Jerry Maguire in Mafia.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I just want to say thanks.  I saw the show last night.  Got tickets from you guys.  Had a good time.  Uh, Jim Brewer, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Rocky Horror.  Yeah, right.  Um, you know, Bluto is saying, Opie goes to Madonna, Anthony goes to Rocky Horror.  What's next?  Norton going to Barney Ice Capades? 
[00:16:30]  Just got to say, the one thing, never having seen Brewer live, is nice belly, dick.  Nice beer gun, dude.  Unbelievable.  Brewer knows.  He shows it.  He's proud of it.  He's proud of it.  He's a dad.  Anyone who grew up on Long Island in the 80s, he is one of the funniest people.  I mean, he's just like every guy that I went to high school with.  Yeah.  He is funny as hell.  Paul, I've said it many times on the show.  He's my fave.  He's my fave.  He's my fave on the radio, and he's my fave, you know, when he does his thing on that stage.  I'm telling you.  And it's amazing he can talk after doing ACDC. 
[00:17:00]  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  A few tickets available for tonight.  It's going to rock as well.  Later.  So, Irving Plaza tonight with Jim Brewer.  Thanks, bro.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, I just wanted to convey to the guys that, you know, that Demented World CD?  Yeah.  I was interested in buying it a while ago because I heard some of the material played on the  air.  Yeah.  And, you know, because of what you said at Horror Show about that guy with not paying  you guys, I won't buy it.  Well, I mean, do what you want. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, the sad part is we're really proud of the material.  We just got used really bad by this idiot.  I mean, I think the guy's close to bankrupt, so I don't even think you're helping him at  this point.  So, do what you want.  Yeah, but if you guys don't see any kind of the profits, I mean, you know, yeah, I'd  love to have it, but what's the sense in giving the money to some asshole, you know?  Right.  Dude, dude, you know what you do?  You find it online because it's all over the place.  Oh, and burn it.  And burn it to disc.  That's true, too.  Yeah, just bootleg it.  We don't care.  Right. 
[00:18:00]  Have fun.  We highly recommend that you just steal it.  Yeah.  Steal it from the record store.  Don't get caught.  Yeah, right.  All right, Mark.  Hey, listen, you guys rock, man.  It's great listening to you every day in the afternoon after I get done dealing with customers  all day long.  Thank you.  Goddamn panties customers.  Anthony would know about that.  I hate them.  Yeah, especially in the air conditioning and heating business.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Later.  Bye.  Opie, you know, Stephen Baldwin, didn't Brewer say he had barely met the guy and just  knew him, like, for like a day or something?  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  He was in Half Baked.  Yeah.  Stephen Baldwin was in Half Baked.  He had a big part.  Yeah.  See, I was right.  He was in, what other big movies was he in?  He was in Fled, Usual Suspects, Posse.  He was in Posse.  Posse.  One Tough Cop.  And, of course, Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas.  All right, why don't we take our first break, Anthony?  All right.  We have to get some mommies for tomorrow's contest. 
[00:19:00]  We have a few, but this is it.  This is the home stretch.  The big show's tomorrow.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets, okay?  Right.  We have a pair of tickets to the show at the Garden.  Really good tickets, courtesy of Jive Records.  Thanks, guys.  Also, $100 in spending cash to do whatever you want with.  Free dinner.  Thank you, Joey, from Paisanos of Mulberry Street.  And limo to and from the show, courtesy of Vital Transportation.  Top-notch limo.  1-800-GO-VITAL, okay?  Right.  You have to give us a call and tell us what you would do for the Britney Spears tickets.  We're looking for mommies. 
[00:19:30]  And we have a few lined up.  We need a few more to spice this damn thing up.  And we wasted way too much time on who knows what yesterday.  I don't know.  But we have to get back to business.  And we've got to get the mommies all set and ready to go for tomorrow's show, okay?  Right.  All right.  The phone number in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  As we go to break, is this it?  Yeah.  All right.  From Demented World, we'll give you a little track here.  All right.  One of our favorites, butt plug.

And I'll see you at the 9?  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And I'll see you at...  What's it?  I suppose she's going to be crazy with it.  Should I just say my name?  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  You're not going to have to, no.  She's going to answer something. 
[00:22:00]  W4.  Oh, f***ing nuts is mine.  Get me a f***ing book to read.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  Opie and Anthony on the Rocks TV.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Really fast, Anthony.  There's a mass email going around about us. 
[00:22:30]  All I want to say...  Brother Wee still completely supports what you and I do in Rochester.  Oh, yeah.  And that's all you need to know.  A bunch of people trying to knock us down.  That's pretty funny.  But I just want to make that perfectly clear.  Because Brother Wee's in Rochester is freaking out.  He goes, dude, I completely support you guys in what you do, and I've never said anything.  You know, it doesn't even have to be addressed. 
[00:23:00]  The guy that's sending around the email, he just wants attention.  He ain't going to get it.  I think the biggest mistake he made, he actually sent out an MP3 of some of his work.  And it was so funny.  I responded to it on opianthony.com, the message board, if you want to check that out.  It's, um, it's, uh, he's a dime a dozen, like, music jock with a bad radio voice.  And, uh, it reminded me of, remember when we played Sticks Franklin? 
[00:23:30]  Sticks Franklin, everyone.  We had a bunch of audition tapes.  When we first started here at this station in New York, we got a lot of tapes from people that wanted to be here at this station.  Uh, we went through the tapes, and we picked out some, uh, really bad ones.  We should do that again, by the way.  We should.  We definitely should.  One of them was this guy named Sticks Franklin.  Hey, it's Sticks Franklin with ya.  In between, uh, songs, I'm gonna try to, uh, come up with, uh, you know, 30 seconds of clever banter.  And it was so bad.  And then we heard this guy that's been sending this email about how he's gonna conquer the radio world. 
[00:24:00]  No, conquer us.  And wipe us off the, uh, globe.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay, whatever.  And I'm thinking, all right, let me hear the guy.  Maybe he's got a rap.  Maybe he's got something working.  It was so, like, just common.  It was so, you could hear this everywhere you drive.  It's that, hey, everybody, we're here playing the music you want to hear, doing twofers.  Twofers and blocks.  He's doing rock blocks and going, uh, yeah, how about that?  Yeah, that's someone that's gonna take, uh, Anthony and I out. 
[00:24:30]  A guy that plays rock blocks.  Yeah, it's like, no, you're struggling.  Just keep your own job.  Bring on your block of Leonard Skinner and let's see what happens.  Yeah.  So, uh...  He may have a funny remark in between.  Oh, no, he didn't.  Believe me.  We listened to that, too.  It's, uh, it's really funny.  So, uh, I don't know.  He's been sending that around.  So if you want to listen to the MP3 and you got it.  Honestly, you know, people attack us all the time, whatever.  But in this case, I just want to make it perfectly clear that, uh, Brother Weez is way on our side. 
[00:25:00]  Well, he was alluding to the fact that somebody, a high-profile, uh, morning, uh, radio personality...  In a small town.  ...was turning their backs.  Well, had a big influence on, uh, my career.  Right, right.  It's obviously Brother Weez in Rochester.  Yeah.  He was turning his backs on, uh, the Opie and Anthony show.  I was like, what?  No, that's not happening.  And that's all I need to say.  Dude, let me, let me tell you something.  The rest is hogwash.  What?  Uh, well, because the guy apparently was reading the message report and, um, and listening to the program. 
[00:25:30]  Dude, concentrate on what you do a little more.  Uh, if you want to, if you want to make a name for yourself in radio, what you're doing right now.  And, you know, this is just friendly advice.  I know he said in his email that he had gone to this broadcasting school and he honed his voice and his craft.  Yeah, yeah, he was using all words like that.  If, if you want to do something, uh, break away from what everyone's doing.  You're not going to get anywhere doing, hey, everybody, we got a rock block.  You know, you're not going to take on, uh, high-profile radio shows doing that. 
[00:26:00]  And then, you know, maybe if you're able to make that work, then start sending around your mass email.  I think he just got a mass emailer program and wanted to use it.  That's what it seemed to me.  Oh, God bless him.  Yeah, but, hey, whatever.  Well, good luck to you.  Yeah, keep working at it and maybe Scranton, PA, will be calling you soon.  You never know.  You never know.  Fine little market.  Yeah, bad monkey checking in from Lindenhurst.  It did sound like Scorch.  Dorn, I've been there, though, bro.  You get excited when you get that call from Scranton. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I made the big time.  Geneva, New York, to Scranton, PA.  Woo-hoo!  All right, a few instant feedbacks, Anthony.  Joe from Philly.  Going to the Rocky Horror Picture Show is still not as gay as Opie going to a costume party to carve a pumpkin with his girl.  You suck, Joe.  The listeners feel like they have to keep track of the gayness of the show at all times.  Well, they should.  And I just got to tell Joe that I refused to wear a costume to this costume party and I did not carve a pumpkin. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  He didn't.  Rick did.  Rick did.  Rick wore the costume and carved the pumpkin and he enjoyed himself.  Yeah, but you know what?  You were overseeing the pumpkin carving on Sandy.  Overseeing.  You were overseeing.  He was standing over her like a hawk going, all right, cut that there.  He's trying, Opie.  Thanks, Rick.  Like, you couldn't tell that I was, like, totally acting, making believe I cared, and then I got back to the movie.  No.  Yeah, all right.  Sure.  Dr. Gross from Connecticut, Anthony, he writes, Stephen Baldwin and half-baked? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  This is the line he had.  Get me an avocado, a corkscrew, and some toilet paper.  Then get me my snorkel, some tinfoil, and an ice pick.  I've made bonds with less, man.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And finally, Hippie from Sayville.  Hey, did you know that tomorrow is the anniversary of when the Voyeur bus went down?  It was a year ago tomorrow that we had 15 people arrested.  Wow, that went quick, huh?  And wait, where's the paper?  There was something in the paper about the Voyeur bus today. 
[00:28:00]  Go get that paper, convict.  We're getting some clips together.  We're getting some clips together from last year.  Yeah.  When we did the whole Voyeur bus thing, and hopefully we'll have it on the air tomorrow.  What a great time that was a year ago.  The Teen Voyeur bus.  Teen Voyeur bus.  We took a bus, had glass sides, sort of like a big rolling fish bowl.  And it had beds in it and a shower, bathroom facilities.  And it would drive around, and these girls would be naked in it and going about their business as they drove around. 
[00:28:30]  Kind of a freedom of expression thing.  So we hooked up with these people from Voyeur bus and decided we were taking people from our show, nude teens.  We were going to put them on this bus and let them visit Mayor Giuliani's offices down there in Lower Manhattan.  So we load up a bunch of these nude teens.  Rick, our producer, is on the bus.  Norton.  Oh, that's right.  Norton got arrested.  Was on the bus.  We barely knew you back then.  Yes.  Along with Louis Black.  Louis Black got arrested. 
[00:29:00]  Was on the bus.  Jackie the Knife Girl got arrested.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark got arrested.  And all of our teen girls.  And all the teen girls, right.  And Steve C., well, it made it downtown, made it down to City Hall, was it?  Where the girls took showers and were nude.  And as it made its way up 6th Avenue to come back to the station, just about made it, a couple of blocks short of the station,  the bus was just pounced on by all types of law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, NYPD, and we find out Secret Service. 
[00:29:30]  It was the higher breast of the NYPD.  Yeah.  They had stuff on you've never seen before.  Like, wow, how do you get that?  Yeah, what is that thing you got?  What did you have to kill to get that?  Old white shirts.  Yeah.  What we didn't know at the time was that Clinton was in town, and his motorcade was going to be making its way up 6th Avenue shortly,  and they were clearing 6th Avenue.  And Giuliani also had some play in this.  He did not want a bus full of nude teen girls rolling up the street. 
[00:30:00]  So he put the word out, and that was it.  They pounced all the people we just mentioned that were on the bus spent over 24 hours in jail.  Yeah, 27 hours, I think.  27 hours in jail.  This is legal, isn't it?  That's Rick's statement from the bus when it got arrested.  That's when he realized, oh, my God.  This is legal, isn't it?  It's always an encouraging feeling when you're associated with a radio station and you hear the producer saying that.  It's always like a good feeling.  And at that point, you didn't really know much about radio. 
[00:30:30]  You're just assuming if the producer of the show is on the bus, then we're all right.  Something could possibly happen, right?  A muscular man just groveling like that on the phone.  This is legal, isn't it?  Like, he doesn't even know.  He doesn't even know.  You know what?  He's not even asking.  He's hoping at that point.  Right.  I hope this is legal.  Right.  We had checked everything out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, shucks.  We didn't know it was wrong.  That was a good attitude.  If you really think what we did last year was legal, and we know damn well Clinton would 
[00:31:00]  have loved it.  So, a year ago tomorrow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was a quick year.  And it made the paper today, cities stripped bare all buses lawsuit.  The city has taken it off, taken it all off.  The Boyer bus court paper is charged in a $20 million lawsuit filed in Manhattan State  Supreme Court.  The owners of the see-through topless club on wheels claim police have gutted the raunchy  rides, electronics, and computer systems.  The bus was stripped, said Boyer lawyer Michael Hardy. 
[00:31:30]  Earl's buddy.  That's Earl's buddy.  Earl got the lawyer.  Oh, God.  That's right.  Earl got the lawyer, and that's why you guys spent a lot of time on the bill.  Don't blame us, man.  This guy was a Johnny Cochran wannabe.  Police confiscated the bare-all bus last November, charging it was snarling traffic and causing  a hazardous condition.  Investigators arrested all 15 people on the bus during a midtown trip that was being promoted  by radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  The city filed suit to keep the bus, the lawyer said, charging it had been used as an instrument 
[00:32:00]  instrumentality of a crime.  And there you have it.  So we'll have some clips tomorrow on that, okay?  Yes.  And speaking of presidents, Al Gore, Anthony.  Al Gore.  What is the latest on Al Gore, who was what, five votes short of being the president?  As we all remember, that election was so close, so close, and Al Gore lost it.  A lot of people still debate that fact, thinking that those Florida ballots were tampered with 
[00:32:30]  or whatnot.  They always say that George W. stole the election.  Good for him.  But right now, who would you rather have in there?  I'd rather have George W. in there.  You know, because we tried out the Democratic angle.  We tried the Clinton way to do things, and I don't think Gore's way would have been much  different.  And, you know, Clinton turned his back for eight years on when these people would blow our  stuff up and kill our people. 
[00:33:00]  I think it's time now we have a president like we have in there now, George W., to kick a little  ass.  So, yeah, they say that it was taken from Al Gore.  Very close election.  Well, what's Al doing now?  He's running the family restaurant in Tennessee.  How is he not killing himself?  Oh, my God.  Five votes short of being the president of the United States, and now he's running the  family restaurant.  Hey, let me tell you this, too. 
[00:33:30]  Don't, for a second, believe this guy isn't crushed by this.  He isn't destroyed by this.  Of course you can tell by it.  He gave those speeches.  He gave the speeches and talked about, no, we've got to move on.  We've got to support our president.  It's okay.  I'm going to stand behind our system of government.  This guy wanted so badly to be president of the United States.  That's the only reason he kissed that Clinton's ass for eight years.  He wanted to be the president.  He was the president, as reported shortly before the polls closed by all the news stations. 
[00:34:00]  And now he is running the family restaurant in Tennessee.  As George W. Bush, the weight of the free world rests on his shoulders.  And Al Gore serving up some home fries.  Like you said in the office, George Bush giving orders, Al Gore taking orders with that beard  of his, walking around. 
[00:34:30]  He has a beard now?  Yeah, he's got this beard.  He's all fat.  He looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  He's lost even more hair.  It's really, really bad.  He grew a beard.  He walks around.  I'm a man just like you.  I'm Alfred.  He says, this has been a time of transition for me, and it hasn't been easy.  For example, there's usually a lot of cars on the road.  Now it takes longer to get around.  And given that I haven't driven for eight years, I'm not sure it's too wise to drive, 
[00:35:00]  said Gore, who was driven in a limousine while he was vice president.  Of course he was.  This is a guy that didn't have to sit in traffic.  There were motorcades and police vehicles that cleared the way.  They shut the roads down when he'd come to town.  And now he's stuck, just like you and I.  You know what's funny?  He's probably been stuck in traffic as they moved the president around.  Oh.  Oh.  Ouch. 
[00:35:30]  That's my car.  So, he says he's started a new family enterprise in his home state.  He says here, we've started a family restaurant in Tennessee, and we're running it ourselves.  Oh, God damn.  That's what Al's doing.  And it says it's a low, you missed the last sentence, it is a low cost restaurant.  Yeah, a low cost restaurant.  Well, I guess he's trying to help.  You know, help some of the people out. 
[00:36:00]  Like trash.  As George W. Bush is sitting there going, should we nuke him?  There's Al Gore going, no, we'll nuke it.  As he, you know, pushing the button.  His finger's on the button.  The microwave.  Isn't that horrible?  I feel bad for him now.  Employee of the month.  Sitting right there, his picture.  Used to be Vice President Al Gore.  Now he's employee of the month.  Hope you had a nice pee, Arnold.  Cleaning big hairy pee, the word, off of the mirror. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, do you think you could get me a job at All-American Burger?  Please wait while former powerful man in the free world seats you.  Think he has to wear a goofy outfit?  Oh, you gotta wear a little cook hat, a little pirate hat.  Hey, have some pride.  Have some pride.  Those boys at IBM. 
[00:37:00]  Need a fit, Trout Burger.  Oh, my God.  Could you see that?  The guy was Vice President.  And, like we said, very close to being President of the United States.  And now he's slinging hash.  How the mighty have fallen.  Taking orders.  There he is in the bathroom after he gets all the work.  Looking out the window.  Phoebe.  Phoebe Cates in the pool.  Still in his family restaurant uniform. 
[00:37:30]  Have some pride.  Remember that guy?  Oh, what a prick.  Isn't anybody effing knock?  This is not the best breakfast I've ever had.  Al Gore.  I'm going to kick 100% of your ass.  He's in the cruising vessel.  Driving around.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Goes to his wife.  I think we need time away from each other.  I'm a single successful guy.  The dream police.  Poor son of a bitch now.  He's just there.  Here's George W.  Pointing out places on the map.  Afghanistan.  We're going to bomb.  And there's Al pointing out things on the menu.  The blue plate special.  You might like this.  His one black employee is busted scalping Ozzy Osbourne tickets. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, Rhett.  Where'd you get that?  Added a hamper?  Mark, what's going on?  Try the grandstand.  Let's go, boys.  I wanted to nominate today's unlucky lottery participant.  We love unlucky lottery.  Yeah.  Anthony, explain the unlucky lottery really fast.  Oh, unlucky lottery is something that happens to you that the odds of it happening are the  same as winning the lottery.  The one in a million shot.  But instead of something as good as winning the lottery, something bad happens to you. 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  Well.  That's the unlucky lottery.  Who's today's unlucky lottery winner?  The Afghani woman, as reported on CNN, who got skulls.  Killed by a package of food that came through her roof and killed her.  So.  You got sick here.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  We're setting up.  Wait a minute.  So you're saying one of our little health packages, our care packages that we dropped  from the planes.  That had the Pop-Tarts.  Yes.  Yeah.  Landed on a roof in Afghanistan and crushed a woman's house and her in it. 
[00:39:30]  That's correct.  Oh!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Good!  Just sitting there minding her own business.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  A lunchbox comes through the roof.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Death by Pop-Tarts.  Hits her in the head and kills her.  Death by Pop-Tarts.  That is fantastic.  I love it.  I love it.  There you go, boys.  Hey, stinky rules.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  Those things weigh about 1,200 pounds. 
[00:40:00]  And they come down and landed on that house.  I'm sure the roof, very strong there in Afghanistan.  The roofing on those houses are up to code.  And crush the woman.  I don't care.  I lump them all into one category over there.  Filthy animals.  Mm-hmm.  I looked in the post today.  God bless the New York Post.  Page 7 of the post.  One of the most fantastic pictures I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.  Bodies Everywhere, it's titled. 
[00:40:30]  Bodies Everywhere.  A Northern Alliance fighter walks through the corpse-littered courtyard yesterday at the Kali  Zhangi Prison Fortress.  Whatever animal name.  Site of a Taliban uprising.  This is the prison uprising that happened that we just bombed the crap out of them.  But I'm picking out, it's like a game of concentration, where you see one part and you've got to link it up to another.  There are body parts here.  I see a foot connected to a leg, and then it just stops. 
[00:41:00]  It just stops, yeah.  Then it just stops.  Then there's a guy here.  I see his head, his arm, and a body, and maybe half a leg.  And then there's a crispy leg attached to a body with no head or arms.  Is this the result after they blew themselves up?  No, no.  This is our bombing.  This is after we bombed them.  And you can tell what happened just by looking at them.  We bombed them with some huge explosives.  Everything flew up in the air.  They had body parts everywhere.  They landed.  And then all the dust from the bombs settled back down on them. 
[00:41:30]  Nice.  A buried, half buried, these creatures.  Ugh.  Good.  I love it.  I love the carnage.  Show us the carnage.  Ed, what's going on?  Hi.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I just wondered if Al Gore's restaurant was called This Close.  Well, that would be a good name for the restaurant.  Welcome to This Close.  Welcome to This Close.  Can I help you?  Horseshoes and hand grenades.  Imagine he's got to just sit. 
[00:42:00]  He's just got to sit there and think, I was almost the president.  He's part of the day-to-day operations?  Of course he is.  He's there.  Dude, that's all he's got to do.  Hi, welcome to Gore's.  Can I take your order?  Yeah, um, Al, I'd like a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla shake.  It's a cheeseburger, onion rings, and a shake?  No, you almost-president tool.  I said fries, jackass. 
[00:42:30]  Shake machine's broken.  I'm fixing it now.  Can I have a Coke, then?  We have Pepsi.  Is that okay?  Does it ever matter if I ask for Coke, do you have to say Pepsi?  I don't care.  A cola.  We have our own Gore Cola here that we mix ourselves.  It's part of our family thing.  Could you excuse me while I shoot myself in the head? 
[00:43:00]  Could someone please keep the Secret Service man away from me?  You want it supersized?  Hey, you were almost the president, weren't you?  Shut the F up and drive around, please.  How awful must that be?  Hey, Dixon, what's up?  Hey, this is Dixon.  I'm Philly.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, um, you think he's got an apron that says, uh, Hail to the Chef?  I think it's a theme restaurant. 
[00:43:30]  It's like famous losers of all time.  Hail to the Chef.  Oh, wow.  All right, you guys suck.  All right, God.  You sure you don't want to come inside and eat at one of our tables?  We got brand new placemats.  We got brand new Dewey Defeats Truman placemats.  Come on, that's a history joke, people.  All right.  This new special on the menu is the Tipper Burger.  It says C surrounded by fat on a bun. 
[00:44:00]  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Rob.  Hey, I was wondering if on the list of pies, if Humble was on there.  Humble pie, yes.  Oh, that's awful.  Very good.  Welcome to Al Gore's.  Can I take your order?  Give me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pamp and make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Oh, hush puppy.  We ain't got time for that crap.  Maybe I'll call it Big Al's. 
[00:44:30]  Sonny will show up.  They got a picture on the Internet of Al wearing his apron at the restaurant.  Yeah, you see that?  Dude, it's him.  He's wearing an apron.  He's shaved.  That's what he does.  And he shaved the beard.  Poor bastard.  I wear a hairnet.  Does he work with Patty?  Hi, Al.  Al just gave me a job.  It's my 18th job so I can pay the rent.  I'm working the fryer later.  On the Internet, it says, poor old Al working as a waiter. 
[00:45:00]  View more pictures here.  That's fantastic.  So.  That poor son of a bitch.  How the hell did he lose that election?  That's it.  All right.  We better take a break, Anthony.  All right.  He's got a mommy standing by.  She's going to tell us what she'll do for the Britney Spears tickets.  Yeah.  We'll go to her next.  Stay there.  Who else gives you a bus filled with naked teens that you can see from the streets of Manhattan? 
[00:45:30]  What a day for new teens.  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest the voyeur bus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jim Brewer is on his way.  He'll be here.  He's got another show tonight at Irving Plaza. 
[00:46:00]  A few tickets still remain.  The show killed last night.  Oh.  So if you're around and you want to go, make sure you're in.  What happened over there?  About something.  Oh, all right.  Take a syllable.  That's all you need to know, okay?  A lot of people digging the Al Gore thing, Anthony.  Yeah, it's just almost the president of the free world.  And now he's running a family restaurant. 
[00:46:30]  And you know his wife was up to that.  You know damn well his wife sees what Bill Clinton's up to and says,  this ain't going to be you.  I'm going to put you in the goddamn family business.  You're running the goddamn restaurant.  You're not going to be like that Clinton running around New York City effing.  Putting him to work.  Puts him to work at the family restaurant.  Like he was almost the president. 
[00:47:00]  A couple of votes away on some wacky Florida cluster F.  And now there's pictures on the Internet of him wearing an apron at the restaurant.  And this...  Kill yourself.  And let me tell you something.  These four years of this presidency at this time,  the most important time,  probably at least one of the most important times in American history,  the administration that's in right now,  in American history,  he's not it. 
[00:47:30]  And the odds?  He's not there.  And the odds,  because you know Al Gore's sitting there going,  well, in four years I'll give you another shot.  Yeah.  If Bush does a good job,  and I'm not saying I like Bush,  but the reality is...  Isolate that.  How does he have to have that name?  Isolate that.  Shut up.  The reality is, though,  if he does a good job with this whole terrorist thing,  he's re-elected.  Guaranteed.  Everyone thought his father...  Well, the economy was going to blow at the wrong time, 
[00:48:00]  but that's what happens.  But, you know, there was the guy.  So then Al's going to have to wait eight years,  is what I was going to say.  But no one even cares,  because they just said I don't like Bush.  Great.  Anthony Tuttle from New York  is a restaurant called Al...  I can't even take off on Arnold's,  but it's Al Knold's.  Al Knold's.  Oh, Al Knold's?  Al Knold's.  Like Al.  Big Al.  I think Big Al's Place.  Big Al's Place?  A little 50s motif.  Chris from Philly.  Gore's restaurant was five votes away  from being the best restaurant in Tennessee. 
[00:48:30]  Tommy Mac from South Jersey.  Al Gore's menus come with a hole puncher,  and you punch out the Chads to select your food.  That would be good.  No, I'm sure you wanted the eggs.  No, I didn't.  I didn't want them over easy.  I wanted the omelet.  But no, I see over easy here  is where you punched out.  The Chad didn't disconnect.  Dennis, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, you think people pull up next to him in traffic?  Like, hey, Al,  how does it feel to be a tool in traffic, huh, Deke? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, he got a bad break.  I don't know how he lives.  Later, boys.  I think he rules.  All right.  You guys had shirts on when you came in here.  Something must have happened to him, man.  No shirt, no shoes, no dice.  See how that sign in there?  Yeah.  Brendan, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I was at Gore's restaurant.  He came to take my order, 
[00:49:30]  and after he stopped crying,  I asked him what he recommended.  He said, try the cheeseburger.  I invented it.  Very nice.  All right.  Oh, you guys rule.  Norton, you're a sick ass,  and I respect that.  Thank you, sir.  All right, buddy.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Yeah, I got George Bush making landmark terrorist,  anti-terrorist legislation for the entire world,  and we got Al Gore making Tipper's family recipe for tater tots.  Oh, Tipper.  Can you believe where I am now? 
[00:50:00]  Poor guy.  Thank you, bro.  I believe I'm going to shoot myself.  Look at you, Al.  You're a member of the honor roll,  assistant to the assistant manager of the restaurant.  I'm telling you, Al,  if this girl can't smell your qualifications,  who needs her, right?  Hey, it's a pose.  You need the attitude, Al.  The attitude dictates that you don't care  whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays. 
[00:50:30]  I mean, whatever happens,  your toes are still tapping.  Now, when you got that,  then you got the attitude.  Poor Al.  He's running a goddamn restaurant.  And we all know this is inside, too,  of Led Zeppelin 4.  Top of days,  foolish days,  sit away.  All will be revealed.  I shall serve no fries before their time.  Sean, what's going on? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, I wonder if Bill Buckner  is his business partner.  Poor Bill Buckner, too.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, we should make a list of  the biggest losers in the history of man.  Wow.  You got to think Al Gore would be on  that top ten list.  He's right up there.  Bill Buckner's got to be up there.  Scotty Norwood.  Get a local for Buffalo today.  Jackie Smith.  Drop a touchdown pass.  Dallas Super Bowl, 1979,  against Pittsburgh.  Donnie Moore, 
[00:51:30]  who knew he was a loser,  blew it and ended up  killing himself over it.  Walter Mondale,  lawyer,  teacher,  corporate executive,  appointed ambassador to Japan  by Clinton.  Mike Dukakis,  professor at Harvard.  George H. Bush,  mostly retired,  but a paid speaker.  Bob Dole,  lawyer,  author,  campaigner,  spokesperson for Pepsi and Viagra.  And Al Gore,  would you like fries with that?  Oh, God. 
[00:52:00]  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, call it Chad's Place.  Chad's Place?  Chad's.  Get a guy that works the door,  his name is Chad,  and then...  He doesn't want to ever talk  to anyone named Chad.  Can you imagine?  Let the profits roll in.  All right, Matt, thank you.  Thanks.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Nate?  Hey.  I wonder if Bill Clinton's  going to be the consultant  of the cigar and wine room.  Cigar aficionado magazine. 
[00:52:30]  Take it easy.  All right, man.  Oh, Al Gore,  at the drive-thru?  Oh, really?  Hey, at least I'm not Rich Voss.  Oh, wow, that...  Wow.  I didn't even see that one coming to me.  That had a hurt.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  As a promo,  you have Pippa Gore  jump 15 garbage cans,  have Clinton play the drums  and cry,  and let her ruin  an hour's chicken stand.  Martin, you sick bastard,  and we love you for it, baby. 
[00:53:00]  Thank you, mister.  Right on, Tony.  Joey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, you know,  Al Gore still does have an escort  to get to and from work.  It's a Ford.  It's got the muscle hanging out.  Ford, that's good.  All right, Joey.  Very funny.  Here's one for New York.  Tom, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hello.  Go ahead, Tom.  Yeah, Tom.  You go to Al Gore's restaurant,  you mention his name,  you get a free glass of wine.  A free glass of wine 
[00:53:30]  in the house.  Ah, go down to Al Gore's  of Mulberry Street.  Ask for Al,  you get a glass of wine  in the house.  Let's go to Paul.  Are there pictures of Al  with celebrities  signed on the walls  down there  at Al's place, maybe?  Yeah, I think he has  a picture of Jay Moore,  Andrew Dice Clay.  The Iron Sheik.  The Iron Sheik.  Paulie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Paulie from Lawrence.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a theme song  for the Gore restaurant.  Okay.  There's a new Gore in town. 
[00:54:00]  That's all I got.  There's Al Gore.  Early to bed.  Like hooked and cleaned  and went out of my head.  Oh, no, that's fine.  Please drive around.  Kiss my grits.  There's a new Allentown 
[00:54:30]  and I'm looking good.  A fresh, freckled face  in the neighborhood.  There's a new Allentown.  A brand new style.  Pass it through.  Things gone.  I'm just gonna stay.  A while.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. 
[00:55:00]  Could you shoot me?  Ha, ha.  I'm Al Gore.  Lily.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to order new stuff.  Order some meat.  Let's order some potatoes  and order some ammo  for my nine.  There's a new Allentown  and I'm looking good.  God, she had to sing  her own theme song.  What a plot.  Is this true?  Daryl from Boston writes, 
[00:55:30]  On 9-11,  Al got stuck in the Midwest somewhere  and he called Bill  to see if he could tag along  to D.C.  for the memorial service  at the cathedral.  Since no planes were flying,  Al had to rent a car  and drive overnight  to Clinton's place  in New York.  Meanwhile,  Meanwhile,  Meanwhile,  Bush was hiding out  in a bunker in Nebraska  and being flown around  in Air Force One  escorted by fighter jets.  Oh.  500 votes  and Al would have been  in Air Force One  and not in Alamo One.  He had a rent to car. 
[00:56:00]  Meanwhile,  Al Gore drives.  Ha, ha, ha.  Meanwhile,  on Air Force One.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, that's awful.  Why do we have such pleasure  in this misery?  Well, we're trying to move on  but the phones  are just going nuts.  Oh, they like kicking him  when he's down.  Tony, what's up?  How are you doing, guys?  Al's going to open a sports bar  and have decorations  of all the last ten teams  that lost the Super Bowl.  Ha, ha, ha.  Very good.  It ain't possibly the match.  All right, man. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you.  Does Al Gore drive to work  in a 78 Gremlin  with a piece of cardboard  covering the word prick?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  What happened?  I was having a great day.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  We'll attempt to move on here.  Sherry, what's up?  I'll get you an abortion.  Sherry.  Yes.  What's up?  Oh, am I on?  Yeah, you're on the radio.  Well, I'm a mom  looking to win  the Britney ticket.  Oh, okay. 
[00:57:00]  The big contest  is going down tomorrow.  Mommy, what would you do  for Britney Spears tickets?  So far, we have  two confirmed contestants.  One lady, she's going to  walk around New York  in a wow bikini?  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  And we have the 19-year-old  with the four-year-old daughter  coming down to suck on  Stark and Patty's hammer toes.  That's disgusting.  Well, what would you like to do  for the Britney Spears package?  Because it's dinner,  it's money,  it's a limo ride,  and of course,  tickets to the show.  Oh, my kid's got to see Britney.  I would pour honey  all over myself 
[00:57:30]  and let Stinky  put feathers all over me.  We haven't tar and feathered  in a while, though, haven't we?  Yeah.  You guys don't like  the tar and feather?  Boring.  Not with honey and feathers.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Oh, my.  You guys,  we have less than 24 hours,  we have two contestants.  That's true.  We should bring her down for it.  Oh, no,  then don't waste my time.  Hey, hey, bitch.  Hey, hey, hey.  You don't even get  on our bad side today  because I'll...  Hey, hey, hey.  Instead of...  Miss?  Miss?  Hello? 
[00:58:00]  Instead of honey and feathers,  can we use a junkie's blood  and anthrax?  Oh, my God.  Okay, next contestant, please.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  I don't like her attitude.  But we need more females  listening to this fine program.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys are a little harsh  at times with the ladies.  Now, you know,  she sounds like the play  by the penthouse pet  from yesterday,  but she doesn't...  She's not a penthouse pet  from yesterday.  I'm enjoying Sherry.  Sherry, would you get  completely naked  for the tar and feathering?  I would not go that far.  I love my daughter,  love Brittany. 
[00:58:30]  She loves Brittany.  Of course, I would love  to make her holidays  and surprise it.  She loves you!  All right.  Now, maybe what we could do  is pour some honey  on your hand  and throw feathers on it.  Can we do that?  All right.  What would you wear?  A bikini.  All right.  What kind of bikini?  I'm still in.  You're still in.  I can tell you  I'm an ex-gymnast.  What kind of bikini?  Bikini.  So is that tank.  What's her name?  Mary Lou Retton.  Mary Lou Retton.  Please don't put me  in the same category.  How about,  can we use instead of that,  can we use hydrochloric acid 
[00:59:00]  in dog feces?  You guys.  Look, man,  I want to actually  go to a road show  and see ladies.  Will you guys relax?  I think the ladies  that enjoy the show  really like...  What other suggestions  are there?  What kind of bikini?  Is it sexy?  Of course it's sexy.  What else would  a bikini look like?  How old are you?  Old enough.  Oh, man,  I'm trying to...  I know,  I'm trying to work  with her.  Okay, okay,  keep going,  keep going. 
[00:59:30]  How old a gal are you?  34.  All right.  That's not bad.  Nothing wrong with that.  How many kids you got?  I have two kids.  Two?  Mm-hmm.  And how old's your daughter?  She's almost seven.  She'll be seven next month.  In a couple of weeks,  you would make her birthday.  Great.  I gotta tell you,  it's more...  That's more like  a Z100 type contestant.  Where, like,  they think they're outrageous,  but it's not really outrageous.  No.  Like, we do...  Like, that needs  to be done naked.  It absolutely does. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  This is what  this contest's all about.  It's you making  some kind of  supreme sacrifice  for your daughter.  Not coming down here  in a bikini...  The phone call  was a sacrifice enough.  Oh, no, it wasn't.  These guys are actually  being tamed today.  We're just ribbing you.  All right, well,  what are the other ideas?  Well, it's up to you  to think about it.  I've been...  Believe me,  we've been brainstorming  all around.  Sherry, I'll tell you,  you do it naked  and it ups the ante.  Nice.  I don't know.  My husband's listening here. 
[01:00:30]  Kids are probably  listening, too.  What...  I don't know about that one.  All right,  we're gonna have to bail.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right, well,  thanks anyway.  All right, bye.  All right, bye-bye.  I understand  what you're trying to do.  I was trying to.  I appreciate it.  I was trying.  I appreciate that.  I think the ladies  are scared to call us.  I'm feeling that lately.  I don't know why.  Maybe it is.  I think women like that  ruin it for the ladies.  I think we're very nice  and if the ladies  came down here,  they would see that. 
[01:01:00]  It's one thing  to hear this  through your radio,  but in person,  we're nice.  Yeah.  For the love of God,  we need a few more mommies.  We have two.  You know what?  You know what would be cool?  Another mommy calls up  and goes,  what the hell?  I'll take her idea.  I'll do it completely naked.  Bingo.  First time  anal for Brittany.  Where?  But does someone  want to do that? 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  All right.  Well,  why don't we take a break  and get back on track  here, Anthony?  I feel like  tomorrow's contest  is going to blow now.  No, see,  it's always how  our contests go.  They start off very slow,  but once they get rolling,  they roll  right off the cliff.  Tomorrow's the day.  We only have  a couple hours left  of today's show.  So, ladies,  call up with ideas.  Why don't you give them  the nice pitch, Anthony?  All right.  Look,  you got your kid.  Your kid wants to see  Brittany Spears so bad. 
[01:02:00]  We have great tickets.  I can't even stress to you  how great these tickets are.  Very close.  A limo ride.  Dinner.  Some cold,  hard cash.  There's the prize.  Ladies,  you got to make  a little sacrifice  for your kid  for the love  of your child.  So,  come up with an idea  to come down here,  something that you believe  would make us go,  wow,  that's something,  boy,  this mother loves her kid  because she's willing  to do this  for the tickets.  And then give us a call,  tell us what you're going to do, 
[01:02:30]  and you come down tomorrow  and you'll have a great shot  at winning these tickets.  There you go.  And it's a way  to make up for things.  Say your daughter's 14  and you did a little drinking  while she was in the womb  and she has the mental capabilities  of a four-month-old.  You bring her...  Yeah,  right?  You'd be happy  to see the flashing lights  at the show  and all the pretty colors.  Oh,  God.  I want just a piece  of my soul left  when I get out  of this business. 
[01:03:00]  Screw that.  Just one little sliver  of my soul  would be nice.  That's what I want  to walk away with.  I just want to be  pushed over the edge.  I just need  just a part  of my soul left.  Backstroking  in the lake of fire.  That's where I want to be.  All right,  and as we take a break here,  we got some clips  from Sex for Sam.  A little bit  we've done twice,  Anthony.  Very successful bit.  Yeah.  So successful.  Other people  are going to be giving it  a try in the near future.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:03:30]  Basically,  it's an easy concept.  We're going to bring this  to Philly,  and yes,  we will bring this  to Boston as well.  Oh, we'll bring it  to Boston  and show you  how it's supposed  to be done,  but not done  by some fat hack.  But we get a bunch  of couples together  and they run  all over the city  and they have  Sex for Points  and there's a two-point  conversion for the back door.  Hey, I forgot that.  And it's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  And as we go to break,  just a little snippet  of Sex for Sam,  okay?  Right.  Yes, Rick,  and the C-Blockers  once again. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, guys,  we're at Rockefeller Center,  NBC's,  the building,  we found a door  that was a jar.  It's like an entrance closet.  Hold on.  What do we have?  Oh, my God.  We're going  for the two-pointer  record.  I think that was  a two-pointer record.  I think that was  two-pointer record.  Oh, my God.  She's staggering.  She's staggering.  It sure sounded  like a two-pointer  from here.  Oh, my God.  That was...  Either that  or she was going  for the...  That's what it's like  to be in prison, guys.  Either that  or she stubbed her toe. 
[01:04:30]  Or sometimes  you make that sound  when you're doing the,  I don't know,  you're doing the last...  The last set, right?  The last set.  Oh, my God.  The last lift  of the last set,  the last...  It's in the home.  It's got to make  that sound.  Ow!  Yeah!  And action.  I can't go one afternoon  without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony.  This is  the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:05:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  Lots of great instant feedback  coming in today, Anthony.  Brian from the city.  If you guys make  that loser list,  all-time loser list,  Pete Best has to be on it.  Oh, yeah.  Tommy Mac from South Jersey  talking about Al Gore.  He's running  the family restaurant now.  Instead of mopping up  at Afghanistan,  Al's now mopping up  the urinals.  Oh.  Awful.  Jay wants to bitch.  Jay, what's up? 
[01:05:30]  Hey, I just want to call...  My complaint isn't  with you guys,  but I want to complain  to all the women out there.  Hallelujah!  I got a friend,  a very good friend of mine.  She got me into your show  and she was on your show  to win the kiss ticket  three years ago.  I've been listening to you guys  ever since.  You're the best.  Thank you.  She won those kiss tickets  by bringing in a friend  and they did a lesbian  dildo act,  if I can say that.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Drive on your show  to win those kiss tickets.  All right.  A friend did not even 
[01:06:00]  go to the show.  This girl brought her boyfriend.  All right.  Hold on.  During Hunger-Thon.  You just brought up  something that we've been  meaning to talk about anyway.  They were fine  cafe lattes.  Yes, they were.  Yeah.  And they basically did  the Motley Crue challenge  for the kiss tickets.  Anthony, remember that?  God, I totally remember.  You're a very good friend of mine.  And thank you.  That started some trouble.  Jay, you're right, man.  You know, and I, we...  The girls out there,  they're just pussies.  They're not doing anything  for these tickets.  And then, you know,  you end up just having  to give them away. 
[01:06:30]  Is there anything you can  legally do with these tickets  and just not give them  to these girls  because they don't do  crap for your show?  You know, and I,  we work really hard  on this show every day  and sometimes someone  has to take one  for the team.  Ladies, help us out, man.  Come on.  Yes, you bring up  a good point with these  two cafe lattes  with this double dong.  Right.  They just went at it.  But there's a side story  to this.  Yeah.  We just started here  in New York  and they were still  playing classic rock.  Yeah.  With the classic jocks.  And we met Stalker Patty 
[01:07:00]  through the Hunger Thon,  by the way.  Yeah, we did.  Right.  And they were doing  something called  the Hunger Thon,  which is raise money  for all the homeless people  in New York.  It's a really big deal.  Now, I guess,  five or six radio stations  that are owned  by this company  do it at the same time  every year around Thanksgiving.  Yeah, it used to be  just this station.  It was something  that was very,  it fit this station  for the time.  It was giving away  a lot of signed  rock memorabilia  for donations  and they would auction 
[01:07:30]  this stuff off.  And I was listening.  It's kind of awkward  to hear people  at the news station  there at 88 CBS  giving away  a signed guitar  by Springsteen  or something.  It doesn't fit.  It fit this station.  Why did they decide  to go to all  the other stations,  Opie?  Well, they hate us.  Yeah.  They hate us.  And they had been  doing a Hunger Thon  here for years.  Many years.  And the guy that...  A 20-year tradition  ended because of our show.  The guy that runs 
[01:08:00]  Hunger Thon,  he's a priest  in his part-time.  We did not know this  at the time.  No.  So we're in the middle  of Hunger Thon.  We've only been  in New York  a few months  and we're still  being good  and playing  by the rules.  Yeah.  And, well,  they were in the middle  of the Hunger Thon  and they had  phone banks set up  and all the rock  memorabilia  all over the studio  and we would do breaks  like, okay,  right now...  It's the Eric Clapton  guitar.  Yeah, it's a signed guitar.  We're taking your bids 
[01:08:30]  for that now.  So call up with that.  And we would just want  to do our regular show.  Which we were doing anyway.  Oh, yes, we were.  So we were giving away  the kiss tickets  and these two  cafe lattes come in  and get completely naked  and they're doing  their thing  with the double dunk.  We decide that  it's a good time  for the Hunger Thon  guy to come in.  Well, the door opens  and I see him  and we're live on the air  and I go,  hey, Bill,  come on in  and check this out.  Because, you know,  Anthony and I,  we love to share. 
[01:09:00]  It's just something we do.  We like sharing  what we're seeing.  He didn't have  the collar on  or nothing.  We had no clue  he was a priest.  He was dressed  all like a regular guy.  And when I tell you  these girls  were going at it,  it's some of the  sickest stuff  I've ever seen  two women do  with each other.  Let's just put it  this way.  I was part of a fraternity  and went to many  bachelor parties.  That was the best  thing I've ever seen.  It was disgusting.  And he's a priest.  He walks in  and sees this.  Horrified, Norton.  Oh, was he?  Horrified.  Oh, that was the same 
[01:09:30]  day that Stockbroker Dave  had his nuts clipped  live on our show.  Yes.  Oh, it was?  Okay.  Yes.  Wow, I didn't think  that.  And not only that,  Rick went to the operation  where they clipped his sack  so he can't have  any kids anymore.  Yeah, they take out  a little piece of a tube  when you have a vasectomy.  Rick actually came back  with a piece of the tube  in a little plastic envelope.  Biohazard.  A biohazard envelope.  Oh, we then put it  on a cracker.  A Ritz cracker.  And everything tastes  best on a Ritz. 
[01:10:00]  And a woman ate it.  For the kiss ticket.  For the kiss ticket.  Oh, that was  Horrified.  Oh, so it wasn't  the same day then.  What a wonderful...  That's a story  for another day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they stopped  doing the show here  because of that.  So, this has happened  to Anthony and I  in the past.  There are charities  out there that would  rather lose money  and not raise  as much money  as they can  because they  don't agree  with what  Ant and I do.  Right.  So, probably because  this guy didn't like 
[01:10:30]  us and our show,  probably people  were starving  on the streets  of New York.  Maybe.  You know, Patty,  stalker Patty  had worked with them  for years too.  She had worked  for them  volunteering her time.  And he told Patty  that she could not  play with them anymore.  Well, she had  to make a decision.  Yeah.  And Patty decided,  you know what,  I like these guys,  I like their show,  so go screw off.  And after like 20 years  of doing the Hunger-Thon,  she walked away.  Why can't I be involved 
[01:11:00]  at the Hunger-Thon?  It benefits me.  So, instead of being  on one of the top-rated  afternoon drive shows  in New York City,  he decided to go  somewhere else  with the Hunger-Thon.  If you'd have had  a glory hole.  And raise less money  because of that.  Of course.  And a glory hole  in a crinkle crinkle bag.  I'm sure he would  have approved of.  But don't get  too hot chicks  going at it  so you can feed people  who are urinating  on themselves.  That's great.  Creep.  Amazing.  Yeah, I know.  When we put out  our Demental World CD,  the same thing happened. 
[01:11:30]  We were trying  to get a charity.  Yeah.  And all the Jimmy Fund  comes to mind  and a few others.  Jimmy Fund.  Cancer Kids.  Cancer Kids.  The Cancer Kid  organization  refused our money.  Dark bags.  Because of who we are.  So, yeah.  Instead of raising  a lot of money  for Cancer Kids,  they decided  they don't need  the money that bad.  Right.  And so we found  one charity.  And the story  has been told  many times.  Maybe on a best of  we'll tell the whole 
[01:12:00]  shwoogie part of it.  But we found  what was the name  of the charity?  It was the  Minority Homeless  Veterans Association.  Not just homeless veterans.  Minority homeless veterans.  Homeless veterans  that want our money.  No.  And there was  Brucey Mittman  presenting the giant check.  To the shwoogies  as he called them.  Not our word,  his word.  He had like  the big check  and you see a picture  of him in the paper  with a bunch of these 
[01:12:30]  old black gentlemen  standing around him  because they were  the minority homeless vets.  And Bruce got all pissed  at us the next day.  He goes,  Boys,  I had to go down  and present a check  to the shwoogies  because of you.  Because of you guys.  Why couldn't you  be down there?  I was with the shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Unbelievable.  Brucey.  We're not innocent,  trust me.  Boys.  Unbelievable.  There he is in the paper  with a picture  of the big check  smiling. 
[01:13:00]  Huge check  with the shwoogies  all around him.  Did you see,  Boys,  did you see my picture  with the shwoogies?  Shwoogies.  All right,  so where were we?  Oh,  so Jay was bitching  that the ladies  got to help us out  a little bit here.  Yeah.  And I agree with Jay.  We're putting ourselves  out there, ladies.  Amanda.  Yes.  How are you?  Good,  how are you?  Pretty good.  So what's going on?  What do you want me  to do for the Britney tickets?  What would you like  to do for the Britney Spears  tickets?  I will get naked.  I don't want to go 
[01:13:30]  to Britney Spears.  Do you hear my daughter?  How old is your daughter?  She's four.  Oh,  God,  that's wrong.  And how old is mommy?  Twenty-four.  Hey,  are the mommies  bringing their kids  tomorrow for this contest?  Oh,  God,  no,  please.  Are we going to have  a little daycare somewhere?  I'm not bringing her  with me to the contest.  I wouldn't either.  You can't.  I have a room  where I'm watching them.  Yeah.  So,  Amanda,  you'll get Uncle Norton's  daycare.  Yes,  I will.  Can you imagine that?  It says on the screen 
[01:14:00]  that you will do  the tar and feather thing  for the Britney Spears tickets.  Absolutely.  And,  unlike that other mommy,  you will do it  completely naked.  Yes,  I will.  Yeah.  And what is your daughter  saying in the background?  You know,  I don't know  if I want to say  over the radio.  Why?  Why?  What is she saying?  I'm sorry?  What is she saying?  She's saying  that she wants  to go see Britney Spears.  I know,  she does.  She knows that I'm  calling for the tickets.  Oh,  nice.  Look at mine.  That's cute.  Isn't that cute? 
[01:14:30]  She's 24  and the kid's four.  Yes.  And I'm very cute.  And you're very cute.  I'm Jayla.  What?  What is she saying?  She's saying her name.  What is her name?  Hold on.  I'm Jayla.  You're what?  Jayla.  I'm Jayla.  Hi,  Jayla.  How are you?  Good.  Is your mommy hot?  Yeah.  Don't say bad things  to a little kid.  No,  hot's nothing.  Hot's innocent. 
[01:15:00]  Come on.  Move on,  see Britney Spears.  All right.  Put your mommy  back on the phone.  Okay.  Hello?  Norton,  zip up.  Mommy?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Despicable.  Is Daddy still around?  Yes,  he is.  Okay,  and he has no problem  with this?  No.  All right,  come on down tomorrow  and get tar and feathered.  Okay,  okay.  You're officially  our third contestant  for Mommy.  What would you do  for Britney Spears tickets?  You know how to get here?  I don't.  All right,  hold on.  Hold on the line.  Don't blow us off.  I will not. 
[01:15:30]  We have 15 cities  counting on you.  Okay.  All right,  Amanda,  hold on,  okay?  You got it.  Amanda will be  tar and feathered tomorrow.  And that's a girl  who loves her daughter.  Yes.  That's a good mommy.  Yes.  I get so scared  when kids are on the phone  and Opie's talking to them.  Gets me very nervous.  I just,  that was innocent.  I was,  but I was wondering  where it was.  I make you nervous?  I make you nervous?  Are you insane?  On the phone with kids?  Nadine,  what's up? 
[01:16:00]  Nadine.  Hello?  Hello.  Your name.  All right.  Where'd she go?  I lost her.  Damn it.  See,  Lisa from Philly  wants to drive up.  Yeah,  I have no problem with that,  but Lisa.  Yeah?  You will do a lap dance?  Yeah,  but now that I'm hearing  that there's more  interesting things happening,  I'm willing to do...  All right,  hold on,  hold on.  Why do we hang up  on Amanda so fast?  They got her info.  You sure?  Okay.  Go ahead,  Lisa.  Now that I'm hearing  that, 
[01:16:30]  you know,  the odds,  the stakes are a little higher,  you know,  there's more interesting  things happening,  I'm willing to do  more than that,  but I'm  questioning if anybody  is a mother of four  like I am.  Oh,  four.  All right.  What are the ages?  My oldest is 15,  and then I've got  11,  3,  and 2.  Perfect age  for Britney Spears,  15.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 34,  5'7",  and 110 pounds.  Wow. 
[01:17:00]  Wow,  look at you.  Four kids later.  Yeah.  Happening.  All right,  so what would you do?  The lap,  the lap dance  is out  from the mother of four.  That's kind of  twisted right there.  No, I mean,  I'll do a lap dance  on anybody,  everybody,  staff.  You know,  Lisa,  you're almost there.  Yeah.  We're ready to invite you.  I'm telling you,  four kids,  lap dance,  we need just something,  a little,  just a little twist here.  You need a little hook to it.  A little hook.  A lap dance with another mother.  Do you have another mother? 
[01:17:30]  No.  We're short on moms,  you know,  you're going to have to,  how about?  Maybe one of the other mothers  wants to come with me.  How about lap dance  on a homeless guy?  No.  We could find a smelly  homeless guy.  Sure,  I'll do it.  Come on,  Lisa,  you're almost there.  You're almost there.  Help us out.  Yeah,  you know,  you're close.  Mother of four lap dance.  I don't know.  I'm drawing a blank.  All right,  how about you guys  could like smear something  on me 
[01:18:00]  and then lick it off.  Cool.  Are you familiar  with Danny Kaye?  Danny Kaye?  Yeah.  Yeah,  the comedian?  Yeah,  do you own a glass table?  I get where you're going.  The Cleveland Steamer.  No,  you wouldn't give  a Cleveland Steamer.  How about,  is there something  we can do  where maybe she stands  in the corner  and we can do something  to her  from a distance,  from range?  At range,  you know what I mean? 
[01:18:30]  I know what you mean.  Like throw  something,  pies or something.  Lisa,  you're so close.  You're so close  I'm going to keep you  on hold  because the listener  might put it  over the top for us.  Okay.  Hold on.  I mean,  lap dance,  mother of four.  Yeah.  How about I'm wearing  nothing but whipped cream?  No.  Come on,  you guys are creative.  Think of something.  All right,  hold on a line.  She's almost there.  Yeah,  it's very close.  We want to give her  the invite. 
[01:19:00]  Let's go to Rick.  Rick,  what's going on?  You're next  on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up,  boys?  Hey.  I wanted to know  why I didn't tell Jalen  there's no Santa Claus.  I had my chance.  Yeah,  I know.  He's done that before.  Oh, man.  Have you ever heard  this one,  Morton?  Oh, it's so bad.  Hey, Rick,  can you find that  really fast?  For the holidays.  It was,  well,  the problem was  it was the father  that really,  really pissed me off.  Yeah.  To the point  I just lost my mind.  This,  this happened many years ago,  Anthony.  It was pretty cruel, man.  Because every time  I play it,  people really want my head. 
[01:19:30]  But this person  that I did it to  is now,  I don't know,  I think 20 or so.  Oh, sure.  You know,  I don't know.  I don't know  if I could play it  because people  really get pissed off.  Well,  you were a prick.  All right, Rick,  thank you.  Bye.  Sean from Boston  saying,  I'd leave my kids  with Michael Jackson  before I left them  with Norton.  No one has an idea  for Lisa.  She's just waiting there. 
[01:20:00]  On the answer  to the feedback  would help, too.  Serious,  serious help, though.  Yeah, please.  Really.  Not like serious questions,  either.  We're saying serious.  Meaning serious.  Bob, what's up?  You guys are going to hell.  Why?  I mean,  I love the show,  but,  I mean,  the whole concept  is sick enough,  but when you start  asking a four-year-old girl  if her mom is hot.  I know.  I almost got to  change the station.  I mean,  that's too much.  Yeah.  That's all I said, though.  Yeah, but.  If someone asked me  if my mom was hot  at four years old,  I would have said no. 
[01:20:30]  This girl's going to  find out what,  this girl's going to  find out what her mother  did years from now.  It's going to destroy her.  All right.  Well,  she's coming down.  It's funny, though.  Good job.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye.  Someone's saying  butt plug.  What?  Someone's saying  I have her use a butt plug.  Some of the yellow discipline.  Oh, yes.  Jay,  no,  she's not going to  give Ziggy a hummer.  No.  But thanks for helping us. 
[01:21:00]  Ziggy.  Oh, my God.  John's got an idea.  I don't know if this lady's  going to go for it, though.  John, what's up?  Yo,  I think this mother of four  should definitely do  the Whiffle Ball  Bat Challenge, man.  Ah.  It's that baby  all the way up there.  Whiffle Ball  Bat Challenge.  That's right.  Let's see if she'll do that.  Ah, Lisa?  Lisa?  Yeah.  John has an idea.  Okay.  The Whiffle Ball  Bat Challenge.  Oh, come on.  You've got to do it.  Huh?  You've got to do it. 
[01:21:30]  Well, wait.  Let's listen to Lisa.  Lisa?  What do you think?  I'm loose or something?  Well,  we don't know.  Oh, no.  No, we're not saying that.  I don't know.  Come on.  Mother of four.  Definitely get those tickets  for your girl.  Yeah.  Lisa?  No?  Yes?  Just the fact that  she's thinking about it,  I want this lady down here.  She's great. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  Come on.  You know you love your daughter.  All right, John.  I don't know.  Kind of raunchy.  Not raunchy.  I have a little  more dignity than that.  All right.  All right.  Do you know how good  that would make your daughter feel?  She'd go to school  and say,  there was no tickets available  and just to get me tickets.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Norton.  I love the way Norton puts it.  Plain English.  No, no, no, no.  Norton, stop.  All right, Lisa. 
[01:22:30]  We'll put you on hold some more.  Have you thought of anything else?  No.  Okay, hold on.  I'm thinking.  All right.  Keep thinking.  Yeah, we don't want to let her go.  I think she's just about  ready to come down.  All right, Anthony.  Well, here it is, I guess.  Can you set this up for me  so I don't look like  a complete a-hole?  Well, uh...  Remember this guy?  There's no way to do that.  This guy was a real...  He just ticked me off.  He was pissing you off  a little bit.  Notice by the high voice  that this happened 
[01:23:00]  many years ago.  How's that?  I'm a changed person.  Well, uh, let's listen.  I don't do this type  of thing anymore.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  Yes.  You just ask kids  if their moms are hot.  Ugh.  Here's, uh...  Here's a little ditty  from the O&A archives.  Uh, yeah.  I was just listening  to your station  a little while ago.  Yeah.  And, uh, I had my  three-year-old son with me  and, uh, you guys  were putting down  the Santa Claus thing  and, oh, it's just your parents  and all that.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know,  I was...  I like...  I love Opie and Anthony, 
[01:23:30]  you know,  and I'm a faithful listener,  but, uh,  I had to change the station.  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing parenting,  that's called,  when you change the station.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait, I detect  that you're a little pissed  at us because we just said  that there's no Santa Claus  on the air.  Well, it'd be one thing  if it was, you know,  a little later at night  and there wouldn't happen  to have been  someone's kid listening,  you know?  Dude, I'd just save you,  uh, the hassle.  Now you can get the credit  for all those presents  you bought for him.  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  He...  I changed the station in time 
[01:24:00]  where he didn't pick up on it  because he was busy  doing something else.  Hey, what's your, uh,  son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I, uh,  talk to him real fast?  Uh, why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say  anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  You don't, you don't really  talk much on the phone, but...  All right, I got to stop  the tape here.  How stupid is his father?  What?  He didn't say anything, did you?  Norton, you say something? 
[01:24:30]  Right when you potted the mic up,  he goes,  what the F is this?  Meaning what?  Your food?  That's not what he ordered.  Oh.  I didn't hear it on the air, so...  It looks like a miscarriage  in a bun.  But I think the F  went over the air, so...  Oh, really?  They might have had  to dump out of something.  It definitely...  All right.  I don't think so.  All right, I better back up a little.  Yeah, back up a little.  All right, hold on.  What the F is this?  We're in the middle  of doing the, uh...  So you go figure,  John screwed it up.  Hey!  He screwed my lunch up today. 
[01:25:00]  John cannot get anything  corrected by 100%.  He's always just 80% right.  John's going the way of Jesse.  All right, Anthony.  So, uh...  I wanted to stop this tape  because how stupid  is this father?  Asking you're not  going to do anything crazy,  are you?  Are you?  Why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say  hi to him.  You're not going to say  anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey? 
[01:25:30]  I'll get him.  He don't really talk much on the phone.  Yeah.  How stupid is this?  All right, he's very stupid for putting his little son Jeffrey on the phone with you.  At this point, you're in your car going, oh, my God, for the love of God,  do not put your young son on the radio with these guys.  Keep Jeffrey off the phone.  Keep Jeffrey off the phone, but he's that stupid.  Yeah.  We'll let it play out now.  I just wanted to make that point.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  He don't really talk much on the phone, but...  What's your wife saying in the background?  Oh, she wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but...  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait.  Barb, chill out.  Oh, I don't...  Okay, hey, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone,  those guys we were listening to on the radio?  I'm on the floor first.  He's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for doing that?  Oh, I better talk to him and then smooth it over. 
[01:26:30]  Okay, well, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it.  Come here.  Wait, let me get him on my lap.  Yeah, you're going to have to wait a minute.  All righty.  Well, just put the phone near his ear.  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you. 
[01:27:00]  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  That's your dad.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Heartless.  Come on.  That can't be real.  Come on.  Oh.  Opie.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the a-hole over there.  You see, sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, that's funny.  I can't turn that loud enough in my truck.  Disturbed.  I swear to God, I can't get loud enough.  The new album is just unbelievable.  Makes me blow through lights.  I run people off.  Just picture my vehicle with this, like, blasting out of it,  driving on sidewalks and hitting things in my truck.  That's pretty much the scene when I drive with this on.  And every song rocks.  Yeah.  Except for the cover of, uh... 
[01:28:00]  Wait, you don't like the shout cover?  I thought it was pretty good.  No, no.  I don't like the shout cover.  Their own stuff is great.  But as far as an album goes, man, it's worth picking up.  I like the anime.  Because every song rocks.  You are my enemy!  Not me!  My mortal enemy!  That's disturbed.  Because they're like, kill, destroy, kill.  Are you beating?  You think our boys in Afghanistan have this cranking?  Oh, just...  As they're vomiting and stuff?  Just picture a cop that comes swooping in, just firing.  Missiles off of it.  Shooting those filthy animals. 
[01:28:30]  This is blasting.  There, there, there.  Oh, you can just picture it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And those filthy creatures dressed in their rags just exploding. 
[01:29:00]  Meanwhile, back on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right.  We lose our effing minds.  Enigma from Boston.  Brilliant observation.  Notice that that four-year-old can measure a room quicker than Earl.  Very good.  Oh, that's right.  That kid was very, very good.  That kid was measuring the floor.  Tim, what's going on? 
[01:29:30]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a great idea for this broad.  For Lisa, who's still on hold from Philly, wants to be part of the Mommy, what would you  do for the Britney Spears tickets?  Yes.  Yeah.  Let her, uh, let her grab her, bend over, grab her ankles.  You guys can cover her with whipped cream and throw cold cuts at her.  Oh, that's a stupid idea, bro.  Oh, come on.  That's a bad idea.  What?  I don't like that idea.  That sounds too, like, uh, morning zoo-ish.  Who's doing that?  A little wacky.  It's, it's actually acceptable if you, if you, if you bend over and put whipped cream on 
[01:30:00]  and then you have a full ham pounded into your balloon knot with a mallet.  So, what would you do?  She gets naked, you put the whipped cream on there and we throw cold cuts and we're all  laughing.  Oh, oh.  Hey, give me a slice of bologna.  You got it, Norton.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  Nah, I think we can do a little better than that on this show.  Or R-O-F-L.  Yeah.  I really have.  Somebody did that.  I, honest to God, typed back G-A when they wrote back, rolling all over the floor. 
[01:30:30]  G-A.  Get Hades.  Yes.  I really did.  Absolutely true.  I'd never seen the G-A when I'm on L-O-L.  I sent it back to somebody in the chat room.  But did they ask what G-A means?  Somebody else in the room did and I just, I was obviously ostracized after that.  So, so then you tell them what G-A is and then I guarantee everyone in the room wrote  L-O-L.  L-O-L.  Nobody wrote L-O-L.  Nobody.  Throwing cold cuts, stupid.  Yeah, it's pimento loaf. 
[01:31:00]  Stupid.  It looks funny.  That's debauchery?  Oh, brother.  Maybe we could put some whipped cream on her and throw a cherry on the top.  What do you think, Rick?  LOL.  That's only funny if you have a diabetic lick the whipped cream and go into a coma and then  everybody kicks him.  Pam, what's going on?  Hey.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Good.  I'll do the lap dance with her.  You will do a lap dance with her?  Will you get on the lesbian couch with her? 
[01:31:30]  Absolutely.  I've been on there before.  You have?  Yes, I have.  Who were you?  I was a MILF contestant.  Oh.  One of our moms that like to have contestants.  Yes.  Very nice.  Yes.  Okay.  What do you think?  Let's ask Lisa, who's still on hold in Philly.  Lisa.  Yes.  Would you jump on the lesbian couch with Pam?  Um, I'm going to have to ask Pam some questions first.  All right.  Well, Pam is on the line with you.  Hi, Pam. 
[01:32:00]  Hi, Lisa.  How are you?  Good.  I think they hit it off.  Yeah.  How many children do you have?  I have two.  Two?  I have two.  You can see pictures of me on this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One at a time.  Lisa wants to know if Pam has stretch marks.  I have a few.  Pam.  Why don't you ask Lisa if she has stretch marks?  She had four kids.  Lisa, do you have stretch marks?  Um, a few.  Okay.  Boy, this conversation is getting hot.  Yeah.  Well, uh, Opie and Anthony can tell you that I'm a 38 D. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  38 C, right?  38 D.  Oh, B.  D.  D is in dog.  D.  D is in dog.  D is in dog.  Oh, D.  D is in dinosaur.  And, um, blonde hair, blue eyes.  Oh, I remember Pam.  One time.  Yeah, you remember me.  I was on the lesbian couch.  Uh, Lisa, Pam is definitely hot.  Is she, um, but is she, uh, been...  You can see me on the open Anthony site.  Or you can go to my site.  Is she still eligible, though, since she's, um, she's won something before, or... 
[01:33:00]  No, I didn't win.  I didn't win.  Now, listen, I...  Pam, you're just gonna help out Lisa's chances, right?  Well, and how many tickets do you have?  Uh, we only have two.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Ew.  Oh, I see my daughter wants to go.  Wait, we're getting your picture up for now.  Yeah, I just popped her picture up.  Let me see.  I have to have my own website with several pictures.  Oh, I remember you, Pam.  You got wild on the lesbian couch.  Yes, I did.  Yeah, she's all right, Lisa.  She's definitely all right. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, but you guys only have two tickets.  Yeah.  Well, Pam...  Oh, my...  So you two go.  Forget the kids.  All right.  All right.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Well, that's true, too.  Let me ask you a question.  Pam, I know you have a website, right?  Yeah.  How about if you do this and help Lisa win the Britney Spears tickets, we'll give you  a lot of promotion on your website.  We got to work together here, man.  That makes sense.  I don't think you're a huge Britney Spears fan, are you, Pam?  My daughter is.  Well, I don't know.  We'll give you a few T-shirts for her. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  Can you guys get two more tickets?  Huh?  No.  Can you guys just get two more tickets?  That's the thing.  These things are hard to get.  We only have...  Do you have any connections?  We only have two tickets, Lisa.  Well, what if we covered our body in wow stickers?  Oh, my God.  In what?  In wow stickers.  You guys are killing our buzz.  This is going nowhere fast.  What did she say?  In barbed wire?  In wow stickers.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's...  Now I do the talking here, ladies.  How about barbed wire?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  All right, Lisa. 
[01:34:30]  Would you jump on the lesbian couch with Pam for a chance to win the Britney Spears contest?  Yes, I would.  All right.  It's only two tickets.  But it's not fair to her.  She's not going to get tickets.  Well, don't worry about her.  We'll take care of Pam.  Yeah.  No.  Her heart might not be into it.  All right.  You'll give my...  You give my website promotion, right?  Definitely.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Guaranteed.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  We're going to set this up.  Lisa, you're coming from Philly to be part of the contest tomorrow.  Okay?  Mother...  Okay.  I have some questions first.  Some more questions. 
[01:35:00]  How many more questions would you like to ask?  When exactly is the concert?  Next week.  I'm sorry?  Next week.  Wednesday.  Oh, okay.  Would you like to know who Brittany's agent is?  Uh, no.  But, um, my next question is, what's the other competition?  Because I kind of changed in late.  I want to know my chances.  Oh, my.  You have a really good chance.  We're going to tar and feather one girl.  Another girl's going to suck on Stalker Patty's hammer toes.  And another girl will be walking around the streets of New York with just a wow bikini on. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  All right.  So, you got a good chance.  All right.  Depending on what we do on the couch?  Yes.  Well, sure.  That can put it over the top.  Yeah.  Hi.  All right.  Are you in?  What would you like to see us do on the couch?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Freestyle.  At this point, Norton, Norton, at this point, I would bring out the mace and the hammer and  just have my way with her.  Why?  Imagine sitting there with so many questions.  I'd be like, what?  But I just club her over the head with something and drag her into the backseat of the car. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Give that balloon not a good sniffing to teach everybody.  Like a caveman.  Yeah.  All right, Lisa.  Hold on.  Are you in or not?  Yes.  All right.  Hold on.  It'll be up to you, you know, and what you can do on that couch.  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  Lisa, mother of four, will be on the lesbian couch for the first time with another mother.  Pam.  Pam?  Uh-huh.  We'll see you tomorrow, and we'll give you all the promotion you need for your website.  All right?  Great.  Can I just send a shout-out to Johnny?  Oh, no.  To Johnny from Raspol's, please. 
[01:36:30]  Johnny from Raspol's.  He's the manager of Raspol's.  He's in the hospital recuperating.  And you want to send a shout-out to him?  I just want to give him my people's shout-out.  Shout-out.  You know, Pam, I don't think we could do that on this show.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  You know, after that conversation, this has all the potential sexiness of the last scene  of Terms of Endearment.  Isn't that awful?  I got one more question.  Yeah, one more question.  What?  What is this, a Senate hearing?  Well, we got to work it.  Oh, that's all the sexiness of one.  Should I lick this, Mr. Corleone? 
[01:37:00]  Vito Corleone?  This check goes to Anthony Vito Corleone.  All right, a couple things.  He got his.  Oh, yes, he did.  A couple things.  Jim Brewer's on his way.  He's late now.  Yeah.  Traffic's bad.  Maybe he's with Stephen Baldwin.  Traffic's bad out there?  Yeah, you know why it's bad?  Because they lit this stupid effing tree yesterday.  One year, it's just going to fall and kill people, and that would be good because they'll 
[01:37:30]  stop lighting it.  We don't need that.  Look how we're changing.  Everyone thinks it's a great thing.  We're pathetic as humans.  I thought it was bad.  Two months ago, we were begging for the tourists to come back to New York.  Begging.  I mean, it was a ghost town out there.  Now, I mean, the streets are full again, and now we got the tree lit, and now look.  No, no.  That's fine.  We want them to go away again.  No, we want them to spend money, not just drive up and down with their fat Midwestern wives  and go, look at the tree, and then leave.  The tree.  I heard it took like three hours to light that damn thing. 
[01:38:00]  People were just waiting around forever last night.  You know what you light it with?  A flamethrower, and it's done.  I'll light it.  Stupid tree.  It's really a scene down there, though.  Feed a homeless guy.  And you don't like big trees lit up, huh?  No, and I'm not just trying to be different.  I genuinely despise that tree, and I effing hate it every year because I'm doing spots,  and the traffic is atrocious because some guy and his pig wife are looking at the tree,  and their fat, stupid, mediocre children are at home.  But it's something they like to do. 
[01:38:30]  They get a little hot cocoa.  Yeah, a little cocoa.  And they get a little hot cocoa.  A little cocoa, and they watch the people skate that can afford to skate.  Imagine if that was us if we weren't white trash, huh?  So then they get to look at the tree.  They look at the skaters.  It's a nice night out.  The little angels blowing the horns.  Get a picture taken with the homeless Santa guy.  Yeah, the angels blowing the horns are great if you pick them up on 10th Avenue.  That's the type you want.  Thank you. 
[01:39:00]  Thank you.  Out.  Out of the vehicle.  Yeah, what about the nice Santa homeless guy?  There's 20 homeless guys.  They walk around like Santa Claus with Polaroid cameras,  and they get these rubes and go,  Hey, take a picture with Santa.  Take a picture.  And the people are like, Oh, okay.  And someone snaps the picture, and then they go, Ten bucks.  And you're like, What?  I thought you were just taking a picture.  Ten dollars.  Ten dollars.  The best is, though, you don't get to see Santa until you pay your money,  and then this homeless guy comes walking from around the corner.  Comes walking out.  Who are you? 
[01:39:30]  Good.  Who are you?  I be Santa Claus.  Who are you?  Mommy, why does Santa keep itching his arm?  Santa needs it really bad.  Take a picture with Santa, you mother effer.  Where are your children's?  Come here.  Get up here on Santa's lap.  Hold on.  There's a handle.  Every year.  That's where Jim Brewer is.  He's probably fighting his way to get here,  and he is stuck in 57th Seasucker traffic. 
[01:40:00]  The traffic is horrendous.  They've got to, like, relax some of these restrictions on coming into town.  And, you know, I always brag, Opie,  when I make it through the tunnel that is still closed by using some of my...  Well, they're renaming it the Anthony Tunnel at this point,  because you're the only person that's allowed to use it.  You know what?  I tried today.  I was running a little late.  There was a lot of traffic on the BQE.  I tried today.  I pulled up to a guy, NYPD. 
[01:40:30]  I show him the press pass,  and that always starts the conversation because it's the wrong credential.  But then I tell him I'm Anthony, Opie and Anthony show.  We have a lot of cops in here.  We support the police.  And the guy gives me a look.  He goes, move it that way.  Just, like, ushers me off into traffic.  And I'm like, ah.  Didn't work today.  See?  It doesn't always work.  I was so pissed.  Anthony, I've got to interrupt this fascinating conversation that we're having 
[01:41:00]  because we have a special guest on the hotline.  Who?  Jerry the King Lawler.  Ah, Jerry Lawler.  The King.  Hello, guys.  The King.  He's back!  Yeah.  I'm like Poltergeist.  He's back, baby.  Thank God you are back with the WWF.  The soap opera is over.  You're back where you belong with Jim Ross at that announce table.  And I've got to tell you, man, you guys sound great. 
[01:41:30]  Well, I appreciate it.  It was like, I guess, of course, we've done two Ross now,  but the very first one, after about the third segment,  we were in a commercial break, and I just looked over at Jim,  and I said, you know, J.R., it seems like we were just doing this last Monday.  It's like, you know, we didn't miss a beat.  Exactly.  It's very, very cool that you're back, Jerry.  Now, I've got to tell you, last time we talked to you, King,  your life was pretty pathetic.  My life was pretty what?  Pathetic.  It was pathetic.  You're right.  Now, things are definitely looking up now. 
[01:42:00]  As a matter of fact, I think it was so pathetic that we were going to fly you to New York  to get you a banging, remember?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  Yeah, that's right.  I'm still waiting on that.  But now you don't need that.  Look at you.  Now you've got to.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Look, I'm back with the WWF.  I'm sitting next to J.R., that's all cool, and I'm doing SmackDown,  and I'm doing Raw, but I still need a banging always.  You know, come on.  Jerry, let me give you some sound advice.  I still see you're gawking over some of the beautiful ladies of the WWF.  When they hit that ring, you start your rap about them and stuff. 
[01:42:30]  It's just like the old days.  He was talking about Stacey Keebler.  You're talking about Stacey Keebler.  Oh, my gosh.  Stacey Keebler, yes.  Of course, I'm not too crazy about that name, but Stacey Keebler,  you know, she wasn't there when I left before, and I mean, that is,  oh, she is just believable.  Jerry, stay away.  Yeah, slow down.  You're drooling.  Now, wait a minute.  Why do I have to stay away?  That's what J.R. was saying.  And J.R. was saying, you know, he said, King, she's too young for you.  Not only too young.  I said, J.R., they're only too young if they wear pajamas with feet in them 
[01:43:00]  or write their love letters with crayons.  And not even then, sir.  Right.  Jerry, all I'm saying is you don't want to hook up with another girl in there  because if they let her go, I know you.  You're a sensitive guy.  You're going to try to get her back, and your ass is going to be out the door again.  No, this time I'll let them go.  Is that what you're going to do?  Hey, bitch, you're on your own.  Right.  Goddamn.  God bless you.  Well, I appreciate it.  And you know something?  This is a great time at the WWF.  We are enjoying it once again, laughing our asses off at Vince and his whole kiss my ass thing. 
[01:43:30]  And it's got to be some of the funniest stuff we've seen in quite some time on WWF.  Let me just say this.  It's certainly been controversial.  I know that the first week I was back, the thing with William Regal, I thought, and I  told everybody, I thought that may have been the funniest segment and the funniest stuff  that I'd ever seen on any RAWs that I've ever done.  Yeah, that's what we said.  Now then, and a lot of people agreed, and you know what, we really got a lot of credit. 
[01:44:00]  I had a lot of people and even people in the industry tell us that, you know, they knew  that was going to be edgy, they knew it was going to be controversial, but they felt that  the way the announcers, myself and J.R. handled it, that it made it funny rather than be offensive.  It's all about you.  Jerry?  Jerry?  Now, the second week, it got even more edgy.  It's all about him.  And I just got to tell you this, get ready for tonight. 
[01:44:30]  Jerry, I got to tell you something.  What?  We do have some audio of you in the office with Vince right when you were asking for  your job back.  Oh, I see, I'm sure.  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  Did you have to kiss Vince's ass?  No, you know what, all of my dealings to go back with the WWF, Vince was not involved  at all.  On your knees.  No, I didn't even speak to Vince.  As a matter of fact, that's probably one of the things a lot of people don't realize, 
[01:45:00]  that he, there's somebody else that is the head of the television part of the WWF.  Oh, really?  And Vince leaves that all up to another guy.  Wow, how about that?  I won't say his name because he hates it whenever I used to say, I've said his name a couple  of times in my, on my website and he always, he goes ballistic.  Is it the Brooklyn Brawler?  Yeah, it's the Brooklyn Brawler.  Actually, it's Harvey Whippleman.  Is it Harvey?  No, it's not.  Of course not.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not? 
[01:45:30]  I didn't know Vince was wired that day in the office.  That was hysterical though, watching when they brought J.R. up there.  Well, let me tell you guys, as I said, the J.R. thing, now that, you know, that got a  little, that got a little uncomfortable.  Oh, people get, Opie's girlfriend I think almost cried.  My girlfriend, even though she knows it's all whatever, she, she can't, she can't watch  when they do that to J.R.  Because J.R. plays the pathetic man role perfectly.  He's perfect, right? 
[01:46:00]  And she literally starts tearing up.  Oh, really?  Because he's so good at it.  Well, Jerry, all that scene needed was some prison bars and a few bathroom stalls and it  became a prison rape.  It was really a prison rape.  Well, like I said, the first week was hilarious, last week was funny and a little uncomfortable.  Wait till tonight on Smackdown.  Oh, really?  Oh, man.  Are you going to be having to kiss any ass?  I will go on record as, of course, like J.R. went on record saying he wasn't going to 
[01:46:30]  kiss any ass, but I'm going to tell you, I'm not going to kiss any ass.  But wait till you see who does.  Oh, okay.  Wait till you see who does.  I love this stuff.  That's a nice tease for tonight.  That's a great tease.  You know, we'll be honest, we're watching again.  There was a time that we were kind of getting a little bored with the WWF, but it goes through  its phases.  It goes through phases, like the show.  Just like this program.  Right.  So you guys have those same phases every now and then.  We understand when you have to try to put all this programming together on a daily basis.  It's not easy. 
[01:47:00]  It's certainly not easy.  But you guys are definitely on an uptick lately.  Well, you know, I'm pleased to be back.  And I think that one of the things that happened, and a lot of this stuff happens when you don't  even realize it or it's subconscious to the fans or whatever.  But I think that one of the things that happened when I left, it just, you know, they replaced  me with Paul Heyman.  And not that he did a bad job, but he was just so totally different from the character that  I was on there.  He was too similar to what J.R. did.  Right.  They both were hard selling the product.  They both were talking about like it was life and death and, you know, buy this pay-per-view 
[01:47:30]  and you're going to see this guy kill this guy.  And there was no, it was no fun almost.  I mean, you know, maybe not no fun, but it just wasn't the funny and the humor stuff wasn't  there.  No, I mean, you got that goofy thing going on.  And the chemistry between you two is really, really good.  Hey, Jerry, are they goofing on you, though, about how you left last time?  Oh, no.  Nobody said a word.  The only thing anybody has said is that they're glad to have me back.  I've had Vincent in the hall last week and he stopped me and he just looked at me for 
[01:48:00]  a second and I didn't know what he was doing.  What are you doing here?  No, we got the audio of what he said.  Oh, again?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You are fired!  I love that one.  That is a great one.  And we have, oh, is this it also?  We have Jerry's audio, the first thing he said to Vince at that meeting.  Don't you do it!  Don't you! 
[01:48:30]  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, my God.  I got nowhere else to go!  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  I got nowhere else to go!  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  Don't you do it!  Don't!  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Don't you do it!  Are you going to kiss my ass?  Don't you do it!  I got nowhere else to go!  Pucker up and kiss my ass! 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  You guys have too much fun with those toys there.  Some exchange.  Jerry, when you guys hit New York, you got to stop by for one of the live shows.  I would love to do it.  I just want to witness what goes on there live.  We really mess with you, bud.  I mean, seriously, welcome back.  Very happy to have you back.  And we truly do love you, man.  Well, I appreciate it.  I'm glad to be back.  Like I said, don't miss SmackDown tonight.  It's going to be a huge surprise who joins the club.  And, of course, the vengeance.  There's no telling what's going to happen at that next pay-per-view.  It should be really cool. 
[01:49:30]  And as you guys know, I'm getting in the obligatory plugs right now.  Of course.  That's all right.  No problem there.  Mr. Lawler, I don't really watch wrestling.  I am only a friend of Obie and Anthony.  But I have to say that everyone from the WWF that called in, they fought to get your job back.  They really told everyone to rehire you.  They were very supportive.  Well, I appreciate it.  And, you know, like I said, the whole thing, and looking back, of course, hindsight's 20-20.  But it was all just a – it never should have happened.  Yeah, tell me about it there, Jerry.  And I was probably more at fault than anybody. 
[01:50:00]  But now it's like I've gotten – this said to me a million times.  Everything happens for a reason, and maybe it's going to all work out for the best.  I got yourself a great second chance there.  Yes, exactly right.  Yeah, don't screw it up.  Have you seen the ex or what?  No, I have not seen her.  Not lately.  No communication whatsoever.  You probably have heard what she's doing, right?  Oh, boy.  No, I haven't heard, guys.  What's she doing?  No, no, I'm asking you.  Oh, no.  There's always those rumors that fly.  Hey, Jerry, you hear about what your ex is doing? 
[01:50:30]  Nothing like that?  No, I don't.  All right.  They're all bitches, those exes, Jerry, right?  Well –  Yeah, just say it.  Actually, I'm under – I'm actually under court order to not make any disparaging remarks about her.  Goddamn lawyers.  They're scum, too.  All right, Jerry.  We're going to watch tonight.  All I know is the last word – let's see.  The last word she said to me was, hey, not so fast.  How about the loose change in your pockets?  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy. 
[01:51:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, boy.  No, you're not.  I know.  Believe me.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  Guys, thank you very much.  We'll be watching SmackDown tonight, definitely.  Okay, great.  Cool.  There he goes.  Jerry the King Lawler from the WWF.  He's back.  That's something, huh?  I'm Jerry.  Okay, we've got three or four mommies standing by, and it's starting to get really interesting.  Good.  Tell them not to go anywhere.  We'll talk to Vanessa.  Erin, who's the 19-year-old mom with the four-year-old, who's going to suck on Stucker 
[01:51:30]  Patty's hammer toes.  She wants to up the ante, and she's going to tell us what she's going to do.  See, now if they up the ante, if they feel they've got to do something a little special  to get the tickets, feel free.  And Mother Anne, we'll talk to her as well in just a bit here.  As we go to break, Anthony, another clip from Sex for Sam.  Yeah.  A little bit we do from time to time.  Yeah, exactly.  Other people feel like they need to do it now, but basically, we've got a bunch of couples  to have sex all over New York for points.  Yeah.  And a trip to Boston to the brewery with Jim Cook and the gang of Sam Adams. 
[01:52:00]  You've got points depending on where you were having the sex, and you had the two-point  conversion for the back door.  And here's a little audio from Sex for Sam.  The Hungarian humpers, once again.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm being very quiet now because, as you know, Carnegie Hall is closed through September  or something, but the guy at the door was nice enough to let us get in the elevator and  go to the second floor.  And they have just done the act with a two-point conversion, and we are heading downstairs. 
[01:52:30]  That's 22 points.  All right, Lynch.  Thank you.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right.  Lynch, you know, he doesn't want to lose this thing.  New York Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?

Jim Brewer is in the building.  Speaking of hash pipe.  Yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I thought he was blowing us off there today.  Hey, Hammer.  Hey.  I'm in the traffic and I'm listening to the north going, 
[01:54:30]  Hey, fat Midwesterners and their horrible wives.  And I'm crying out.  Dude, I parked way on 10th Avenue.  Did you?  And I walked here.  It was so much more work.  Bad traffic, right?  And you got a, I don't even know what to talk about, man.  The guy downstairs.  What?  Stable Baldwin?  No, go ahead.  Did he, did he show up?  Well, we were, we were not even.  Yeah.  So, I go downstairs.  Yeah.  You threw me off.  You're a dick.  I go downstairs and the guy's like, um, okay, Jim Brewer. 
[01:55:00]  Where are you going?  It's, uh, there's an Opie and Anthony.  He goes, uh, close up.  There's no one answering.  I go, hello.  It's like, dude.  I go, well, you know, once in a while I'll do the show.  And I don't want to be a digger.  Right.  I'm a goat and you might've saw me as a goat and stuff.  It's the security downstairs.  They're black, dude.  You know Chappelle?  You know Chappelle?  Right, right.  He wasn't having it, man.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Yeah, it's Jim Brewer, terrorist.  They finally got the, the next Fez show. 
[01:55:30]  Someone Fez, random Fez show.  And like, uh, do you know this actor?  He's, uh, Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer, he's like, I'm sorry, man.  I'm like, no, it's cool.  It's all right.  Ah, they're ridiculous downstairs.  You know, some, some places, fine and dandy.  I like a lot of security.  You know where I like security?  At my airports.  At places like Boston Logan Airport.  Where they let anyone through with knives and, and, and, uh, box cutters to hijack planes 
[01:56:00]  and smash them here in New York.  Uh, that's where I like my security.  At, at my building that I work in?  No.  Now, I don't, you know, it really is a little overkill.  It's overkill.  Man, I try that.  Airport security?  Good.  Put more there.  Put our lame guards at, at, at the airports.  And then, like, someone's coming out of the other building on the side there and he's  like, hey, but tell him I got it.  Tell him I got it.  I'm like, no, dude.  Don't talk that in front of me.  Yeah, right?  Just want to get upstairs.  He's hitting on some fat broad. 
[01:56:30]  It was, man.  And the security guys we got down there, you know.  And it's not just our building.  It's a lot of the building.  They're not security guys.  Where all of a sudden, do you think for a second that after 9-11, all of a sudden a  bunch of people went to security guard school?  No.  They pulled them out of their regular jobs.  What the hell they were doing?  Now all these guys are CIA agents.  Yeah, now they're all like, eh, Joe security.  We went to a meeting about two weeks ago.  Oh, our, our TV meeting. 
[01:57:00]  Right, right.  With a telepicture.  Yeah.  We ought to go into the timeline.  We're going to be big TV stars.  Right, Jim?  Oh, yeah.  I know this meeting.  And they told us we'd have more money in modeling for some reason.  And they gave us a tennis racket.  Yeah, they handed out the tennis racket and some cute shorts and tube socks.  We didn't know where it was going.  Whoa, what's this?  A piece of cake.  Yeah, it set me up. 
[01:57:30]  But now, now, the, all these buildings, the people that used to be called receptionists  that were supposed to smile at you when you walked in to give their place of business business  and be nice to you, now they have the job of a security guard.  So no matter how pissed off they used to be, they would have to friggin' bite their effing lip  and smile at you.  Now, they have reason to be pricks on wheels.  Now they sit there and go, where's your identification?  Remember that woman there? 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's like, I need ID.  Yeah.  Okay, and first of all, I'm like, don't even fool me.  Don't even try to fool me about your credentials as a security guard.  She almost scratched my eyes out because I go, what's your problem?  Yeah, yeah.  Up goes, I don't have a problem.  Oh, are you in a bad mood?  I ain't got no problem.  In the middle?  I ain't in no bad mood.  Yeah.  I got, and you know, it's just a line of people.  There's a line of people.  They show like the people right near her desk, and you slowly pan back, and it looks  like the box that the Ark of the Covenant was left in in that warehouse. 
[01:58:30]  You realize how vast and huge it is?  Yeah.  It's like, wow, there's only three people there.  Oh, pull away, pull away.  Oh, my God.  Six million people trying to get in this building with this sitting there.  I need ID.  And they give you the ID, and now you got to make your way to the elevator, where the  ID that you got, your temporary little pass, is now checked by another guy.  He's only three feet behind you.  He watched the whole thing go down.  Yeah, yeah.  He watched everything.  You watched me get it from home. 
[01:59:00]  He's like, let me see your badge.  Like, ah, here's the one she just gave me.  What elevator do I use?  You're the white dude on that radio.  You get in the elevator, you get out of the elevator, and there's doors that you have  to come through there.  There's another person looking at your badge that they just gave you.  All right, go ahead.  Oh, oh, I get clearance.  Where's my retinal scan and Tom print?  You know, Bill has an observation, though.  Bill?  Yeah.  Go ahead, real fast. 
[01:59:30]  How are you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Brewer, I'm wondering if the guy down at the desk worked at Sears, because he probably  remembers you impersonated Gaddafi.  I remember that story.  Thanks a lot, guys.  The bomb threat story you told on this.  You told the cops.  That was back in 84.  I used to get high and hump monkeys.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those were the days, Hammer.  The good old days at Sears.  Brewer, I got to tell you, man, to your face, you killed last night. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you.  That was a great show.  That was a good time.  That was good.  You inspired me, man.  You inspired me.  I talked about it.  Yeah, I didn't need to get gay, but it was cool.  There's some tickets available for tonight's show.  Not many, though.  Irving Plaza with Jim Brewer tonight.  That's not a whole lot.  Paul Bond helping you out last night.  Correale killed last night.  I said it on the air, man.  Pete Correale had him.  Holy moly.  He had a great set last night.  He's opening again.  Yeah, he'll be there tonight.  It's a good show.  Now, I told Anthony, and I don't know where you want to go with this, and I understand,  but the stuff on Osama and the war, wow. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Got a good take.  Thanks, man.  Good take on it.  He's got some good stuff.  That's good.  Good stuff on you.  The only way we get our sanity.  He goes right for it, man.  Right for it.  Well, me and Paul went on a road trip, and I had to fly a plane.  You know, they tell you don't profile.  I'm sorry.  If you look like a guinea, I'm following you to the bathroom.  If you're an old hag with a tank, I'm following you to the bathroom.  Any close enough for you, huh?  I do the whole thing with the arm, the fake arm. 
[02:01:00]  I talk to the arm.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Swear to God.  We're looking at him.  Stalk him.  Yeah, we're looking at him.  And I'm not the only one.  I see you around as other guys.  And someone at the airport's going, why is Go Boy talking to his wrist?  I'm on the cover, faggot.  The SNL thing was a cover.  Back off.  Maybe Hollywood's not what you expect, all right, Dick?  Take a walk.  I'm working.  I'm working here.  You know what it is?  That bathroom.  We got a camel monkey coming this way. 
[02:01:30]  Everyone, take your shirts off.  Look out.  A camel monkey.  You know that's what they're calling him.  We got a situation.  Two camel monkeys just pounced into some buildings.  Now, I'd say we go over there and we goddamn take them off this planet.  See, here's the problem with them camel monkeys.  They're used to living in the jungle.  The jungle.  The jungle over there.  Well, the desert or whatever you call it, you know what I'm talking about. 
[02:02:00]  Sure.  It's a big conspiracy about the monkeys.  Now, you saw Plown the Apes.  You think that movie was really about the apes?  You know what it was about, huh, John?  You know it and I see it.  It's Plown it, although you know a lot.  Starts with an N, ends with an S, and rhymes with a ticker.  Now, listen here.  Hey, this is America.  God dang it.  You know there's dudes talking like that.  Of course.  Now, you did have to fly in a plane very recently. 
[02:02:30]  Did I tell you about the stewardess?  He's flying right now.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not.  That just sucks.  Because the goddamn bathroom now, the bathrooms are still right there by the cockpit.  So everyone's got to, at some point, everyone on that plane has to walk toward the flight deck of the aircraft.  And you're always, you're looking at him like, hey, what's he up to? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, where are you going, peeing?  Where are you, bathroom?  You got to pee?  What are you doing?  I'm just going to hang.  And now, it's like you don't want to, because a lot of people get up right after the plane takes off, even though the fastened seatbelt light's still on.  You know, I got to go.  They're not going to screw with me until we reach, you know, the flight level we're supposed to be at.  But now, everybody, what, stays in their seat.  No one moves until the light goes off.  I swear to God, I hang out in a bit.  I hung out in a bit.  What the hell did I fly?  I flew to Florida.  I hung out back by the toilet for like an hour. 
[02:03:30]  Really?  Just hanging.  And I started, thank God I wasn't baked for, I went on a flight.  There was one flight where, you know, I was like, let me get relaxed for this flight.  And I started thinking, oh my God, what if they anthraxed in the air, or the food that I'm getting is anthraxed.  You're all paranoid.  Yeah, it's bad.  I think they had different plans for the aircraft than the anthrax.  Those sand monkeys got me.  They incited fear into my heart of the Americans.  Now, wake up, God damn it, and take your shoes off. 
[02:04:00]  First, I told you about the chinks, did I not?  They're in their houses building bombs, chinking and chowing, and you sit there going, yo, I'm a negro.  Go ahead, supply the animals, you idiots.  This is America.  Hoot and holler all you want.  We've got a problem.  Planet of the you-know-whats.  Hey, look, you say it, I say it.  We all say it.  The word's like ice cream.  The Star Wars reference you make? 
[02:04:30]  The sand people.  I don't know if you want to do it on the radio, but it was too good.  I just think they're all, you know when you're watching CNN, which you can't help because they've got the crap on the bottom and whatever.  So you're watching the thing, don't you get, remember when you first saw Star Wars?  Oh, yeah.  The first time you saw it.  They're not evil enough, but do you remember when, like, who's the robot?  R2-D2 there?  R2-D2, he's stuck in the desert.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  And then the little sand guys in the brown carpet.  Remember that feeling you got?  Yeah.  Like, oh, F, this is not cool.  Right, right.  That's the way I feel.  Every time I just see one of these jackasses talking, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  The little sand people.  Like they're going to pop up and go, uh-oh.  You can shoot your electric things go through your eyes and you fall down.  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. 
[02:05:30]  That feeling you get, uh-oh, this ain't good.  Someone wants to say something to you, Brewer.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Brewer, I want to let you know I saw the show last night.  Had a great time.  Okay.  A couple of things.  First of all, nice beer gut, dick.  I mean, dude, that's a bunt and a half.  Do something.  It's called salads.  Read about it.  Look it up.  I think he, uh, stuck it out just for the extra effect, though.  Well, the other nice touch, Opie, and I got to nail you on this.  Yeah.  First of all, he introduces Opie and Anthony.  Maybe you had mini A in your pocket or something, because I didn't see any Anthony there, but 
[02:06:00]  fine.  He was too busy with the Rocky Homo picture show or something.  Ed's been sick, always.  But the nice touch, at the end of the night, when he gives you props again, you are nowhere  to be seen.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's not true.  I know.  I saw you ducking away.  I saw you.  No, that's not true.  I stayed to the end and then hung out after the show at Brewer.  No, I don't know.  Those little people on the floor didn't see it, but that's all right.  I even went downstairs, dude.  All right, man.  Thanks for the guys.  Guys.  Anyway, thanks for the tickets.  All right.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:06:30]  See, his problem is he's got friends of you-know-what.  And they're talking in his ear and getting them all hopped up.  They're sick and tired of all of them.  Hey, we got to talk to Erin really fast.  She's one of the mommies for tomorrow's competition.  The 19-year-old mom who has a four-year-old trying to win the Britney Spears package, which  is the limo, the dinner, the money, and, of course, the tickets.  Great tickets.  Erin, what's up?  Norton, how are you?  Good.  I wanted to know what else I could do.  I see people doing a little bit of a better job than me.  Well, you sucking on Stalker Patty's hammer toes is pretty damn good. 
[02:07:00]  Just make sure you get down here, Mar, and we'll spice it up for you, okay?  Okay, because I want to make sure I win them.  It's like Norton said, I have to stop my kid's life enough.  I have to make it up.  No, you got a good shot, all right?  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Sorry about that.  I thought she had more, but she didn't.  Well, that's good.  She wanted us to come up with it.  That's good.  I like that, though.  She wants to go that extra mile.  Well, we have another mommy, Ann.  Ann, what's up?  Ann, here I am.  Yes.  You're on the radio.  Okay, thanks. 
[02:07:30]  I hope you can hear me.  I'm at my daughter's school picking her up.  I'm on my cell phone.  I want to come in and pump my breasts on the air.  Do you want to pump your breasts?  Yes.  The breast milk?  Yeah, breast milk.  That's what you get out of breasts.  They're engorged?  Not terribly.  Well, what do you do?  Do you have a small child?  Eight months old.  Eight months.  You want to make, like, chocolate milk or something tomorrow?  I'd be willing to do that.  Why don't we make a milkshake and one of the other moms can drink it? 
[02:08:00]  All right, well...  Why don't you do that and then have an enema?  Yeah, give her an enema.  Well, after you pump the milk, would you put the wet nip in an electric socket?  That's going a little far, I think.  Of course it is, Ann.  You're too smart for us.  You're crazy.  All right, hold on.  We'll get you down here tomorrow, okay?  Okay.  Because at this point, we're pretty damn desperate for mommy.  Maybe she can figure it out on the ride down to the station.  Yeah.  She'll work it out.  Yeah, Stephen Baldwin was there. 
[02:08:30]  You were asking that.  Did you run into him?  No, I didn't run into him, man.  I did not run into him.  That's just a freaky situation.  He squeezed my niece's ass.  He did?  Yeah, man.  My little niece came and said, Stephen Baldwin squeezed my ass.  How old is she?  She's 24.  She's hot.  She's a vixen.  Yeah.  Keep away.  He had a small part and a half big.  I guess he did.  Yeah, he did.  You don't even know?  You don't know?  Yes, he did.  He was the potato guy.  Yeah, he was like, made the bong out of... 
[02:09:00]  That's right.  Give me a potato and a fork or something.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Jim Brewer is in the house.  Yeah.  There's a few tickets available for tonight's show at Ernie Plaza.  It's a great show.  We really enjoyed it.  Oh, yeah.  And let me know you know what's there.  You know what I'm talking about.  Just good Americans.  At the end of the night when you did a little song there and the Met fan jumped up, completely  hammered.  Yes!  That rock.  I forgot about that. 
[02:09:30]  That kid came up.  He was hammered.  And then one of your roadies comes running out like, oh, my God, oh, my God, I'm breaking  security.  The guy was freaking out like this guy was going to do something.  He was just a drunken fan.  They always get up on stage with you.  They do.  Remember the time at the Vanderbilt?  Vanderbilt.  Twice.  Where you did the karate kick to the one kid and he went flying?  I took American Combat County when I was 18.  Well, you're in the middle of a joke.  You didn't miss a beat, man.  He's in the middle of a joke.  This fan from the side comes running like, ah, and you turn around and give him a karate  kick and continued with the joke. 
[02:10:00]  That was the set.  And the first guy came on.  He came on.  I remember it.  He goes, the yellow one's the sun.  Yeah.  Poor big black lineman.  But last night, this guy gets on stage completely hammered.  Wrecked.  And, yeah, your security guy comes running out.  You're like, no, man, it's cool.  Well, what happened was he was so white trash, Met fan.  It was great.  He comes on.  Yeah.  And I turn around.  Oh, my God.  This guy on stage. 
[02:10:30]  He grabs the mic.  He starts singing.  It shook me all night long.  So the security instantly grabs him, bear hug.  I go, no, no, no.  He's a Met fan.  Let him stay.  Yeah, you do have to treat him like the retarded.  Nice.  All right.  I will say this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You know, in like 2020, when they say, what was a great World Series?  They're going to say 1986. 
[02:11:00]  Because that whole little miracle thing that happened.  Yeah.  This is one of the nicest cruises we've ever been on.  We've won two straight games.  And the bomb in the ninth like a miracle.  We truly are.  We're in the desert.  The redneck is holding us down.  I understand.  It was a nice memory.  However, we still got the mook of 86. 
[02:11:30]  And we won, baby.  That's all that matters.  All right.  That's all that matters.  I got you.  I would have rather said, now you know what it's like to be a Met fan.  Now you know.  No, he doesn't.  Now you know.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm how excited you felt.  Oh, my God.  A bomb in the ninth.  It's a miracle.  Remember when we talked and you played that little faggy disco song?  What?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How gay was that?  Well, we all agreed that that was pretty gay. 
[02:12:00]  I'm sitting in Connecticut.  Open, keys, mouth shut.  And now what happened?  I had nothing on that.  We all agreed that was pretty gay.  All right.  So getting back to the Met fan.  You said there was a reason you allowed him up.  Did you get a Met fan?  No.  All right.  You were going somewhere else.  But okay.  That's all right.  He's on the line.  That's why.  Is he?  Yeah.  Oh, this is the guy.  Brady, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Brady.  Does he get in?  Hey, Brady.  Real what?  Hey, man.  Bro, your show rocked last night, bro.  I woke up laughing this morning, bro.  Awesome.  You guys made me have a good time. 
[02:12:30]  You guys made me lose.  So thank you.  Yo, thanks for keeping me up there, too, bro.  You know, I'm just chilling there.  I thought I was going to get my ass kicked.  Hey, Brady.  Next time you get on stage and you get a chance to sing, how about you sing into the microphone?  Yeah, yeah.  I was a little bit waxed last night.  He was, man.  He was having good.  I didn't even know what I was doing.  Your guitar player and Paul Bond at that point, both of you guys were pretty scared of this  kid, man.  Good thing comes running over with the mic right in your face.  Before he left, I think he smacked me in the face.  He's like, hey, we're friends. 
[02:13:00]  Now let me smack you.  Yeah, yeah.  Good times.  Good times.  Anyway, have a good show tonight, Jim.  All right, Brady.  Later.  Handle your high, Dick.  Brady's all normal right now.  Brady's all normal.  He was on normal.  He was fun last night.  Have a good show.  Thanks for coming, Brady.  And then he stage-doped right onto the floor.  He did.  Did he hit anyone?  He kind of like, they didn't really catch him, and he went right down to the floor.  That gag.  I saw that.  No one caught him.  I love him.  I love when people stage-dive and no one catches him.  They're all Yankee fans.  Nothing's funnier.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you, man.  I F you. 
[02:13:30]  All right, Brewers here.  Irving Plaza tonight.  A few tickets still remain.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Jim Brewer in the studio playing Irving Plaza tonight in New York City.  Tickets still available.  We get the best SNL dirt during the commercial.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  I was just telling you.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Norm was my, he was the best, man.  Norm rocks.  He just, I told the story last night, but when we had the press, this is when I knew Norm rocks.  As soon as I got the show, you know, you have this big press conference.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, my God, I'm in makeup.  And they're putting clothes on me.  And I'm getting pictures taken.  They're finding out about my background.  I'm meeting the head of NBC.  This is exciting. 
[02:14:30]  Well, we're up there.  And they give us a big lecture.  Now, they're going to ask you questions.  Just think about how you're going to answer them.  And they're going to say some bad things to you.  But it's the press.  It's cool.  And they're really prepping us.  And they're really being cool about it.  Well, you know, they ask, like, Sherry.  Sherry O'Terry says, you were in the Groundlings?  Yes.  And I loved the way you read.  I loved Sunday Night Live my whole life.  I just wanted to be a Sunday Night Live.  And this is the most exciting time of my life.  So, Norm MacDonald, I've got to ask you this. 
[02:15:00]  You're the veteran.  Tim Meadows, David Spade.  You guys are the veterans.  Everyone knows this is such a frat house atmosphere.  Which is not.  This is such a frat house.  What kind of practical jokes are you going to play on the guys?  You're going to have to dump out.  So, be prepared.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  Can you put it in a way?  Just use the first letter of the bad heart.  Norm goes, I'll put a PG-13.  He goes, I don't know.  We're probably going to anally rape them.  We're going to stick our big C's right in their pooper and just rape them around. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, welcome to the show, you faggot.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I can still picture that.  I don't know.  I can guarantee none of that made the radio.  You can say anally rape.  I don't know.  Hopefully.  Hey, we're going to abuse them in ways that are backside of the rumper.  But he says this in front of all these reporters, you know, TV guys. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  I laughed.  And that's when I started, like, where am I right now?  And we went to the side where there was food when it was over.  And I went, Norma, you think that was cool?  And he's like, let me tell you something.  They don't give two craps about you, bro.  You guys are on Little Chippendales.  Yeah, I'm going to be on the show.  I'll see you in about five months.  Wow.  Oh, man.  It was awesome.  It was brutally honest. 
[02:16:30]  Spade right off the bat saying, hey, I'm you thinking out Norm's crazy.  Norm used to hate Catan.  Hating Catan.  Well, I did, too, man.  I didn't hate him.  I just had proms with him.  Yeah.  It's just competition stuff.  Whatever, man.  It sounded very, like you were saying, high school.  It was totally.  Like, like.  If I can explain to you, show business is such a goof. 
[02:17:00]  It's just that there's so much stakes involved.  It's the only thing that's involved.  It's just like high school.  You just go in.  It's like a little play.  Catan.  Well, we pitch ideas.  We get our ideas.  You know, we sit there.  And the best was, I don't know if I told you guys this one.  Catan's sitting there.  And Garth Brooks comes in.  Everyone's like, don't forget.  Pull out your big ones for Garth Brooks.  He's going to pull in a lot of ratings.  So, like, oh.  Oh, you Midwest loves this guy.  And so, like, okay.  Yeah, this guy's huge.  So, I'm waiting out for a goat boy out there or something. 
[02:17:30]  I'm trying to get on.  But everyone, they're bringing the cannons.  Cheerleaders.  Mary Catherine.  So, they're all bringing out their guns.  And, uh, Catan, it's like the second time he did Mango.  Uh-huh.  The gay stripper or whatever.  Yeah.  So, uh, some good acting, huh?  He comes up and he goes, I got this idea where I'm going to do Mango.  And, um, so Garth goes, I don't think Superstar Garth Brooks is going to do Mango. 
[02:18:00]  Gay Mango.  Well, unless it's the episode where he gets the crap knocked out of him.  Oh, man.  It was good time.  And then he wrote, so check this out.  So, now he.  So, now the mini war has begun.  So, uh, we go to, uh, now the day, we read all the sketches on a, uh, Wednesday. 
[02:18:30]  Wednesday, Wednesday, you sit there and you read, like, eight hours of sketches.  And the first thing you do, you sit down and you look at the top, see which ones you're in.  You know, there's a big stack of them.  Uh-oh.  And the top is a cast.  And, yeah, it instantly goes, oh, this week sucks.  So, the further down you get, it's like, oh, boy.  Yeah, exactly.  So, um, but here's Mango.  And I see Mango and I look and I see Brewer.  Catan puts in all the guys he knows.  He puts in me, Colin, Tracy Morgan, and Norm. 
[02:19:00]  So, I'm like, ooh, interesting.  And I pull out.  I go, now, Norm doesn't do sketches.  He tells you right off the bat, hey, listen, guys, I'll be in sketches because I'm going to F it up and I'm just not going to show up.  So, on a sketch comedy show, he doesn't do sketches.  I got the news, man.  I'm busy.  That's it.  He just threw the news.  And once, like, if he had a killer sketch, and that's the way he was, and you know what?  God bless him for it. 
[02:19:30]  And he put, he's like, yeah, I got Barry Reynolds.  I'll do that.  But don't put me in one of your little gay sketches in the bag.  Don't do it.  I'm doing it right now.  I'm not going to do it.  And he did it, man.  That was great.  So, we sit there, and I'm looking at the, you know, sorry, let me look at the scene here.  And it says, Katan writes that Norm has to say, that mango, now this may not be word for word, but in the ballpark, that mango is my favorite all-time stripper. 
[02:20:00]  Gosh, I dream about that mango.  So, I'm sitting there, and I give Colin Quinn an elbow.  He's like, I know, I know, I know.  I saw it.  I saw it already.  This is going to be good.  This is the end of it all.  It's great.  I love it.  Holy gee, that sounds like, oh, I know, I know, I know.  So, here we go.  Now, Norm, this is funny, too.  Even when sometimes he has to do sketches, you know, our big catering thing is, you know, carrots. 
[02:20:30]  So, he's sitting there.  All he would do is read.  Like, if he had to read, here, just one line of the paper, he'd go, he'd eat a carrot.  Eh, I'll do this for Canadian tonight.  Live, send me up.  That's the way he would read your sketch, no matter what you put in it.  Eh, Cox more of a gamer than, um, Glenn.  So, now, also, on the read-through, you have all the producers, you have the network, you have all the writers, 
[02:21:00]  you have, uh, all the people that are going to do the costumes, everyone's going to, you know, do the sets.  They're all sitting there watching while you're doing the read-through.  Yeah, they all sit, and we do the read-through, and the host is on the end.  Well, uh, here it comes.  Now, of course, the industry has a lot of, um, homosexual-type personnel.  Of course.  So, that's a given.  So, we're sitting there, and Norm goes, here comes the big line. 
[02:21:30]  I, I, I totally, I'm professional, and I go, can't wait to see that mango tonight.  I, totally professional.  Norm grabs the thing, he's,  Hey, yeah, that contend, sure loves big seed, honey.  Oh, that mango loves seed.  I wish he'd just admit it, right?  Matter of fact, tonight, I'm going to go see him.  I love that big faggot.  And then he put it down, and he got up, and he walked out of the room. 
[02:22:00]  That is set of balls.  That's great.  He's like the, he's like the John Wayne of comedy.  He just doesn't care.  Oh, it was, it was just brilliant.  Didn't he have an assistant or someone that had to actually empty the bottles of urine from his office?  Well, it was what, yeah.  I never actually saw the, if there was bottles, they said there was pee in the office, but.  Yeah, I heard like Snapple bottles or something, like all over the office.  He wouldn't want to leave his office to go to the bathroom, so he'd just do it in a bottle. 
[02:22:30]  I had an assistant that had to say, hey, can you empty this?  Well, he used to, he was very competitive, and he'd make us play a, well, I was too.  At two in the morning, you have a Raiders box, so I'd get Colin and a couple guys,  let's play football in the hallway.  But Norm, he, he, if he lost a game, he was very competitive, so he was like,  ah, that's it, Lojo, come here, if Norm wanted to play, and he'd get this chick,  and he'd go, Lojo, stand in the other hallway.  We're going to play this game.  I'm going to whip the ball as fast as I can at you, 
[02:23:00]  and you're going to bounce it, and you've got to block it, all right?  Instead of this, just like, put your hands up.  And he just, and the object of the game was try to hit the wall behind them.  And he'd whip the ball as hard as he can.  And she'd be like, ow, that really hurt my finger.  Come on, I'm going to faggot, let's go.  But we used to play football, and I got him back one time, because he was rough.  He would, he was dirty, he'd hold my hands and hold the, you know, pass come to me.  He was a dirty player.  So, this one, and I was like, screw this.  I went in, got nice and zapped in the room, said, I'm ready for a big football game. 
[02:23:30]  I put on my boots, and I waited until he was going out for a pass.  I got behind him, and I kicked him really hard in the calf.  Bang!  He was down.  Norm's like, ah!  Didn't even cry, sir.  Carl's like, what happened, what happened?  Hey, bro, he kicked me in a goddamn calf.  What the hell was that, bro?  I said, well, don't be a dick.  Don't hold me, man. 
[02:24:00]  You're being a dick.  Oh, you're not going to kick me, man.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  It was the same thing as high school, man.  Yeah.  Bro, can you do five seconds of Tracy Morgan, please?  Tracy was...  Listen to Tracy Morgan in prayer.  Tracy, and I will say this about Tracy Morgan.  I've known him since the Uptown Comedy Club, and I'm telling you, he has not been...  His true talents have not been exposed.  I never laughed so hard than Tracy Morgan. 
[02:24:30]  You will see him one day.  We were in the same room together.  Tracy, me and him spend a lot of time, and I get frustrated.  People try to steal stuff from you, and there's just nothing you can do about it.  Ketan.  Ketan.  You know, there was one time where, you know, stuff like, you know, you pitch your fake ideas,  but there was one time where, in my room, I have a chalkboard, right?  And I think Rosie was coming up soon.  We knew that was going to be big ratings.  Rosie was huge. 
[02:25:00]  You pull out your guns for Rosie.  So, I said, you know what?  And I wrote up there, Pesci Christmas Story.  Pesci Christmas Story.  So, I was sitting there, I write that up there, and all of a sudden, here he comes.  Hey, what you up to?  What you doing?  Oh, man.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Oh, my God.  What's up?  Pesci Story?  What's that?  Sounds funny.  Oh, boy.  I said, well, you know, it's kind of the...  And I was trying to venture out of the show and just, you know, have Pesci Christmas. 
[02:25:30]  It was corny.  It was just, hey, you know why Rudolph's nose is red?  Because he's a rat, whole family rats.  I'm going that stupid direction.  So, I'm like, but I'm going to...  And he goes, why are you doing it?  I said, I'm going to do it in two weeks when Rosie's on the show.  And he goes, ah, that's cool.  What happens?  We go to the read-through.  And again, you're in front of everyone.  It's just what pops up out of nowhere.  The Al Pacino Christmas story.  Oh, no.  You know why Rudolph is cuckoo? 
[02:26:00]  And I'm like, what the...  Oh, no.  And if you run the coaches and tell them, you're a faggot.  Right, right.  Dude, deal with it.  Listen, people have ideas and they constantly go...  Right, you look petty and...  Yeah, right.  And I'd always go back to like...  I'd go back to Tracy.  I'm like, yo, Jim.  Kane killed Abel.  Kane killed Abel.  Yo, Jim, he killed that nigga over jealousy. 
[02:26:30]  They were blood.  They were blood.  He killed that nigga.  Over jealousy.  Kane killed him.  Say, I'm going to take you out.  Should have had Pesci beat up Mango.  But I actually had a run-in with him, too.  And that's...  I was so pissed.  I was so pissed.  Because this is like the second, third episode.  It was another corny one with...  I did some radio thing.  And we were talking about 80s metal.  And I just started goofing around and doing Dave Lee Roth. 
[02:27:00]  Whoa!  And I didn't even do him that good.  But I started saying, you know what?  What a cool idea.  And the radio guy was like, you know, you should try that as a go-boy.  I didn't think about that.  So I go off and I talk about it.  I'm like, yeah, we'll have an all-time.  And I'll come out as different characters.  A best-of show.  So I can do pre-tape.  So wouldn't you know, it's the first thing I get into the office.  Because he's never there early.  He jumps in and is like, hey, I was wondering, you're doing Goat Boy this week?  It's already picked up.  He's like, I do a great, great Van Halen Dave Lee Roth. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no.  So I went, I took the benefit of the doubt.  I took the benefit.  I said, you know what?  I've got to be honest with you.  I was just talking about that today.  It's really bizarre you brought that up.  Because actually, you kind of look like him.  And you might even say, and I didn't have a full idea.  But I did bring it up, talking about putting him on Goat Boy.  But I was talking about doing a pre-tape.  He's like, I just thought it'd be funny.  And I'd come out and it'd be great.  We could do it this week.  I went, well, tell you what. 
[02:28:00]  Why don't we talk about this?  Because when we're like in a dressing room, I'm getting ready to rehearse.  I said, why don't we talk about this next week?  And maybe we could do this for like next week's show or two weeks from now.  All right, all right.  Two seconds later, like high school, goes running to the head writer of Goat Boy.  And I see him like literally auditioning, kicking his leg up in the head.  Wow.  Wow.  Man.  And he came home.  He's like, listen, Chris has got a great.  And I was like, where is she?  And it was like high school. 
[02:28:30]  I had to bring him back.  And I'm like, dude, what's wrong with you?  What is wrong with you?  Did we not just talk?  He started crying.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I shouldn't befriend you like that.  You're the only one that talks to me.  It was like therapy.  I would sit him down.  Like, dude, you can't do this.  A little crying Chris Katan.  Why didn't anyone talk to me?  Because.  Oh, my God.  You're crazy, bro.  You're crazy.  The quirky Romano.  The little crying Chris Katan.  I didn't see it, but it was good.  He's very funny.  He's very funny.  He's very physical.  He's very talented, but.  Wow.  It plays, bro. 
[02:29:00]  It brings out the high school in you.  I guess so.  I've never heard.  Can you imagine doing it?  Can you imagine me sitting there going, hey, Rick, I got this great character I went to  in the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, he got to talk to you guys.  Like, hey, Opie.  And you're like, we'll talk about it later.  Rick.  Don't tell Opie and Anthony, but I get to this great gorilla voice.  What?  What?  I've never heard good stories come out of that place for some reason.  How is gay is that? 
[02:29:30]  I've always heard, like, nasty, backstabbing stuff.  And I never, you know what?  I praise my wife.  I'd come home and I'd be like, man, I can't, I can't deal with it.  You know what?  It's too crazy.  She's like, then quit.  You become a miserable little pothead.  Get off the show.  You said the minute work is not fun, you're out.  Well, it's not fun.  Get out.  And, you know, and you still pause the, you don't understand.  Standing live, and I'm a goat man.  And Joe, yeah, all right. 
[02:30:00]  You know, go hang out in the balcony and smoke to your retardant and go bitch to someone else.  And that's the part of life you need because you're so truthful.  Put your back in, you know what?  It's right, man.  And that's when I got it.  That's when I want it out.  I love your honesty, man.  Hey, I can't kill you for being honest.  And it's just my perception, that's all.  That is brutal.  I love it.  Just honest.  I like the crying, Chris.  I want to help the penthouse shake out.  I want to help people.  We're going to replay that soon.  Lady Di, what's up? 
[02:30:30]  Hi, how you doing?  Hi, you brewer.  Hi.  How's it going?  Good, how are you?  Oh, it's one of the...  I love you.  You're such a great comedian.  Is that who...  Thank you.  Half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley, Lady Di.  Hi, how's everything?  Oh, God.  Things are good, Lady Di.  Yes.  Can I answer the contest?  What?  The mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears?  Yeah, well, you know, I am not a fan of Britney Spears, but I'm just wondering about that.  What would you do?  I have no idea. 
[02:31:00]  You know, that's really funny.  Di.  Would you let Matthew Modine yell at you while you blew your head off in the toilet?  No, Jim.  Stop it.  Why don't you tell us...  Jim, by the way, you killed...  Let me taste it right now.  Jim, can I just say something to you?  When we saw you last Friday, you were wonderful.  Thank you.  You were really, really wonderful, and Luke really likes you, and Mary really likes you.  Oh, shut up.  Do you know everybody at Caroline's wanted to strangle her?  Of course.  Everybody there.  It's like these two women are out in the lobby. 
[02:31:30]  Who are they?  Oh, she's gone.  Doug, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, Brewer.  Yes.  Do you remember performing stand-up at a certain college two years ago in Allentown, Pennsylvania?  I think so, yeah.  I got your autograph after the show, and it was the worst message I've ever seen, ever.  What?  Right.  You used the blue marker, so all you wrote was, blue is better.  So what's wrong with that?  That's terrible.  So what's the point?  There's nothing original about that. 
[02:32:00]  I guess you might want to take out your donkey and place it between your forefinger and your  thumb and kind of hang out and do something useful, and then when you're done, stick it  up your nostrils, you retard.  Call out when you've got another gene pool.  You know, we're going to take a break.  We found one of our favorite Norm clips.  Oh, yeah.  I love this one.  We love this one.  This is Norm from...  Your son, Dennis Miller?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We haven't played this in a while.  We love this thing.  Classic Norm McDonald. 
[02:32:30]  And we'll be back with Jim Brewer, who is playing Irving Plaza tonight.  Yeah.  This show is great.  We went last night.  He's killing, so...  Let's all enjoy...  Let's enjoy Norm.  And how he just goes with the story.  You won't even know where...  You have no clue where he's going.  That's what he does.  He's just talking, and then he hits you right between the eyes.  Takes forever to get to the punchline, but it's well worth the trip, man.  Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career that you consider specifically  to be in bad taste?  As you look back on it.  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think 
[02:33:00]  that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are...  Like one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and they were all gay people  in the audience, they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to me.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about...  Because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it there were these old men and old  ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son. 
[02:33:30]  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, because it's not an achievement.  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid.  Oh, my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean?  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh, yeah, he loves c**k. 
[02:34:00]  You know?  Just kidding.  He can't get enough c**k in his mouth, his ass, his kids, all his c**k.  I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's c**k.  I got a picture of the boy here.  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  One of our good pals in the studio, Jim Brewer, playing Irving Plaza tonight.  Paul Bond, you got some time on the stage tonight, right?  And I tried to be backing him up.  Nice.  Why don't you go over there and punch him, Opie?  Stop it.  I know.  We're trying to move on.  It was like three years ago. 
[02:35:00]  We're so past that.  You know, he started telling me that, and I laughed.  I couldn't help it.  I laughed at him.  It was the funniest.  He hit me with two palms.  He came right up.  It was the funniest goddamn thing.  Drunken dragon.  Drunken dragon.  Rock and roll.  He's raw, and I had a whole new respect.  There's a practical joke gone wrong.  Oh, boy.  And I punched Paul in the face.  Take your shirt off.  Show us your donkey.  Paul came running in up to Opie after the practical joke was over. 
[02:35:30]  It was going to be the big closer where the practical joke was exposed.  And Paul comes in and starts yelling at Opie and rushing towards him.  I see Paul's comedy partner there, Billy, at the door.  Billy Staples.  And he starts smiling like, oh, it's a gag.  And I realize now, oh, it's a joke.  I look at Opie.  I'm like, Opie doesn't know.  And this is happening in a split second.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  This is happening in a split second in my head.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Opie doesn't know it's a joke yet.  And then it's like, no. 
[02:36:00]  Opie gets up and just, like, pops him in the head.  I went down fast.  Yeah.  Billy grabs Opie.  Billy grabs Opie.  Opie's like, at this point, going, oh, oh, now I did it.  And now Billy's going to beat the crap out of me.  Yeah, because this is before the Staples.  And Billy was well over 100 pounds more than he is now.  He was 360.  Yeah.  I'm like, I am so dead.  There's nothing I can do.  And then Billy just grabs Opie.  He goes, it's a joke.  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  Opie looks over.  Sucks to be you.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Paul had the shiner going.  At that point, everyone was supposed to laugh, but there was no laugh again.  They were all looking at Paul like, oh, no.  I had a beer on one eye and an ice pack on the other going, boy, that sucked.  What's the movie that starts off when they got the hooker and they're all like at the  blank and they're throwing it up and then they throw up too far and she smacks and she's  dead.  The hooker's dead.  Oh, my God.  What do we do?  It's supposed to be a joke.  Well, what do we do?  Was that very bad things?  No, that's...  No, he killed her on a peg in the bathroom.  Christian Slater.  Yeah, that's very bad things, but he killed her on a peg in the bathroom. 
[02:37:00]  I remember that one where they were tossing her around.  What was it, Stag?  Was it Stag?  I can't remember the name.  Were you guys in a house?  You're right.  I'm sure we'll know in two seconds.  No clue.  Instant feedback will go wild.  That's the only scene I remember.  I don't even remember the rest of the movie.  All I remember is like, wow, this is crazy.  They got a hooker on a blanket.  Yeah.  And they're tossing it up.  Higher!  Woo!  Higher!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  I got two black eyes. 
[02:37:30]  Well, I just want to say it's nice to be on the Opie and Anthony Airwaves.  Yeah, right.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Very good.  I've seen you quite a bit off, but, you know.  That was, yeah, that was quite a day.  Anyway.  That was Rick's idea, by the way, so I owe him a punch.  Yeah, Rick took some crap for that because he was in on the gag and we told him if he ever...  I didn't want to come in mad.  If he ever turns on us again, we'll kill him.  You play a good mad guy, though.  Acting.  And then because Rick was in on it, that started a whole nother thing where we were calling Rick Fredo. 
[02:38:00]  We were calling Rick Fredo.  You're a lying sack.  And somebody wrapped his Miata in a newspaper.  Oh, you're such a liar.  In newspaper and put a dead fish and a horse's head on his hood.  You're a liar.  No, no, no.  When that came back, we came back to reveal it was a joke.  You said, come on in angry.  No.  Bust into the studio.  Dude, that was you, Jay, and Billy.  Dude, it was my fault for going around the console to get off me.  Rick, we all know you were in on it, so it doesn't matter.  I'm so glad we're all over this. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  No, we are.  There is still this low...  Yeah, there still is this underlying thing.  Oh, there is here.  I was like, whoa.  Yeah.  All right.  A couple things really fast.  Carlos Mencia is going to be on the show tomorrow.  Hilarious.  We love Carlos.  He's playing Rascals this weekend.  Dude, what the F?  He's got a lot of beater jokes.  He's funny, man.  He's really funny.  Yeah, me hallowed.  And we're going to do, Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets tomorrow?  Yeah, can't wait for that.  We've run out of time as far as getting contestants, but if there's any last-minute mommies out there, 
[02:39:00]  email us, and we'll try to give you a call before the show if you've got something good,  okay?  Just show up.  All right.  We'll be in.  Just make sure you don't bring a you-know-what.  You know what the hell I'm talking about.  This is America.  A lot of people bummed we didn't do stoner spelling, but Brewer showed up late, but we  got all the inside scoop of SNL.  Yeah, we got it.  It doesn't get better than that. 
[02:39:30]  Hello, ma'am, hello, Hannah.  Jerry from Edison, New Jersey.  I learned today GA will not get you LOL.  No.  The lighting of the tree should be done with a flamethrower.  The king is back, and he needs a banging.  Camel monkeys live in the jungle.  Met fans should be treated like the retarded.  Yeah.  Wow.  Opie has stalker patty.  Jim Brewer has stalker Steve.  Nice stalker, dick.  Norton's right hand from Norton's pants. 
[02:40:00]  Today I learned Ziggy is not getting a Hummer tomorrow.  No.  Dale.  I learned today that Norton's food looks like a miscarriage on a bun.  Sheep lover.  I learned don't scream rock and roll in nice restaurants.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll Johnny Race.  Good one.  Justin.  I learned today that Midwestern people have fat, mediocre children.  And West Coast Dave's always good for one.  Today I learned that while George Bush is running the war, Al Gore is running the grill.  Well, poor Al. 
[02:40:30]  What are you laughing at?  I just, I got the giggles.  It's so unnormal.  At least this show made sense today.  It did.  Everyone was asking me, like, what was wrong with you?  And I swear I had a point.  Somewhere.  Don't ask me what.  We enjoyed ourselves yesterday, though.  Huh?  We enjoyed ourselves.  I had a good time.  It was way out there, though.  A lot of fun.  Way out there. 
[02:41:00]  Are you feeling better?  You look like you're feeling better.  No, I still feel, it's the medication, you know.  I like that cold medicine.  It's so, it makes you feel so tingly and, like, all warm and cozy.  It's a buzz.  It's a legal drug.  It's like a white wine, red wine buzz.  It's like a drug buzz, man.  It's like some kind of dope.  You get it and you buy it right in the store.  It says drugstore on it.  Drugs.  Buy drugs here.  All right.  Over the counter, it still gets you buzzed. 
[02:41:30]  Use that, kids.  That's a good buzz.  It's legal.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, I got a, what I learned today.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I learned that a 34-year-old mother of two's lesbian foreplay is as arousing as the  last scene of Terms of Endearment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jim, we got two mommies doing the lesbian couch tomorrow.  A mother of four and a mother of two.  Hey, yo, it's Jim.  I'm seeing you down in Philly tomorrow at the TLA.  Excellent.  Yeah, so I'll be in the front row.  So if you want to burn one after the show, just let me know.  All right, Hammer. 
[02:42:00]  The Philly ticket sales are insane.  Yeah, it was like that.  You're going to have a good time in Philly.  Yeah, it's going to be a good time.  Yeah, that's why I keep hearing.  I'd like to thank Philly.  That's, you guys.  Philly's right there.  I don't know.  You guys rule, dude.  Philly's right.  All right.  All right, man.  Look at what Boobie from Brooklyn learned.  He learned Opie doesn't like Bush.  I know, it wrecked my whole story, too.  All right, I guess we're done.  We got some Aussie tickets to give away.  Aussie Osborne.  Aussie.  How many we got?  Three pair.  Three pair.
