<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of NFL football, focusing on the Jets' loss to the Patriots and the unexpected strong performances of the Packers and Giants. Opie turned down Yankee tickets, opting instead to attend the final game at the old Yankee Stadium.  The conversation then shifted to Hurricane Ike, with the hosts expressing boredom with the typical hurricane coverage and making dark jokes about the suffering of those affected. This led to a humorous, albeit morbid, segment imagining what it would be like to be hit by a teaspoon of lava.

A caller named Brian brought up the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, drawing a parallel between the mass employee exodus and hurricane evacuations. Opie and Anthony speculated about the market's response and offered unsolicited financial advice.

Anthony then recounted his weekend test drive of a Corvette Z06, expressing significant displeasure with its handling and abysmal fuel economy.  He contrasted this negatively with his own Shelby and Escalade. This transitioned into further discussion of potential gas price gouging in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike.

The show concluded with a preview of a clip showing Geraldo Rivera being knocked down by a wave while reporting on Hurricane Ike.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  Monday, yeah.  It's a Monday.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Go Jets go, huh?  Oops.  How about them Jets?  Oops.  How about them?  How about that? 
[00:00:30]  How about them Brett Favre Jets?  Brett Favre.  Matt Castle's getting the job done for the Patriots.  Well, first little interception throw there didn't help.  That was the nail in the coffin, as they say.  Jets 1-1.  Pats 2-0.  Giants 2-0.  Yes.  Big Blue, as they call them.  Big Blue.  Hate Big Blue. 
[00:01:00]  Yuck.  Yuck.  For the Big Blue fans.  And then I got a text from Kenny.  Very nice.  Billy Mack.  Yeah.  Was offering me Yankee tickets for Thursday.  Ah.  And I said, eh, nah.  Why?  Why do I want to see that team right now?  Only because it's the ceremony of the last game of the season?  One of the last games?  One of the last games.  It's not the last game.  Which, I'd go to the last game. 
[00:01:30]  I would even go to the last game.  I think this is the third to last game.  Yeah.  Who cares?  So I could sit in the stadium that's going to be...  Like this whole hallowed ground of Yankee Stadium thing.  I ain't buying it.  Where are you getting these tickets from again?  Billy Mack.  Billy Mack.  Hope we didn't get them away yet, Billy.  Very nice and all, but you want like the second to last game.  The last game.  The last game at Yankee Stadium?  All right.  I'll take that.  You want to be at the stadium the day after the last game. 
[00:02:00]  To get whatever the hell you want.  Oh, you know that's going on.  Just like pilfer.  Oh, you know there's going to be like a special invite.  Yeah.  Come on in with some wrenches.  Right.  Whatever you need.  And some sledgehammers and some saws.  And enjoy yourself.  Packers, by the way, 2-0.  Oh, Packers?  Yeah, without the Brett Favre up there.  Go Pack Goal.  Go Pack Goal.  And Cheesehead Country.  They're 2-0 without Brett Favre.  So it's a little weird.  We get to Brett Favre. 
[00:02:30]  We're 1-1.  Pats don't have Brady.  They're 2-0.  Packers don't have Brett Favre.  They're 2-0 with their new quarterback.  So far, so good with this football season.  Then you've got the Giants still doing very well.  Yeah.  Big Blue, they're called.  I know.  I know.  I just love saying that on the news.  And Big Blue.  Was anyone surprised that the Pats beat the Jets?  No.  When we started talking about the game at the end of last week,  I'm thinking to myself, I think that this is a win for the Pats. 
[00:03:00]  Well, Brett Favre was kind of the wild card in that one.  If Brett Favre wasn't in there, you'd think, like, all right, yeah,  obviously the Pats are going to win.  Yeah.  But, well, see, because people think Brady's the whole team.  And if you live in the Boston area, you understand more than the rest of the country  that that's just not true.  They've got a very, very strong team up there.  Sure.  They're a great coach, a very strong team, star quarterback down and out. 
[00:03:30]  Could get tough as the year goes on.  I don't know.  But so far, so good.  Yeah.  We'll have to see.  Yeah.  And then over the weekend, kind of bummed about Hurricane Ike.  I was telling Anthony, we need a new, like, we need a new storm.  A new type of disaster storm thing.  I'm getting bored with these hurricanes.  They're not doing the damage that I'm expecting them to do.  No, they just kind of wheel in.  People are prepared.  And Stump Brain's laughing in the background.  But, hey, if they're going to, like, present it like they do on TV, 
[00:04:00]  I'm hoping for the big payoff.  Yeah.  You know, you wake up and it's like, oh, it's a hurricane doing what it does.  Yeah.  It's a hurricane.  If you're on the beach, you're screwed.  Yeah.  Other than that, meh.  I love the people.  I ain't leaving.  I've been here for 40 years.  I ain't leaving.  Like that old guy with Mount St. Helens.  Yeah.  That old guy who's like, I'm staying here.  Oh, they warned me.  But I hope his skin was searing in his last seconds when he went, maybe I should have left. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yes.  Ow.  Ow.  Yeah.  I love those guys.  They're old.  Lava.  They're old school.  They've been in that area forever.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm not scared of no hurricane.  Oh.  Well, they're still searching for that guy.  Yeah.  And the others in Galveston.  The last thing they yell is the lava's killing them is, all right, I'm going.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, as it just slowly engulfs them.  I've never been hit by any, even a little bit of lava, but I got to think it really hurts. 
[00:05:00]  It's probably very hot.  How much lava can you take, you think?  I think probably a speck of lava on you would be the worst searing pain of your life.  I would take a teaspoon.  A teaspoon of lava.  I would take a teaspoon of lava.  It's melted rocks.  All right.  You couldn't possibly take a teaspoon.  I would take a teaspoon of lava.  Where?  On my bag.  Yeah, for the hell. 
[00:05:30]  For the goof.  All righty.  For the goof.  Where can we get some lava?  Call the lawyers.  We want to dump lava on Opie.  Yeah, tell them that I want to take a teaspoon of lava to my bag.  It's 1,200 degrees.  Yeah.  That's why only a teaspoon.  Oh, okay.  It's going through the chair.  It's going through the teaspoon.  Yeah, it's going to melt.  The teaspoon will just melt in there.  Wait, lava goes through teaspoons?  If it's 1,200 degrees.  All right, now we've got a problem with our bit.  How are we going to present the lava in teaspoon form without a teaspoon? 
[00:06:00]  Now logistics, this doesn't work.  Another bit we're not going to be able to do.  We'll dip you into the volcano.  All right, yeah, but who can I trust to dip me just a teaspoon amount?  E-Rock.  Yeah, all right.  I fell in lava once.  No, you didn't.  What happened?  I had to get up.  Let's say hi to Brian in the Bronx.  Maybe if I had some lava.  Yeah, Brian.  What's up, guys?  Good morning.  Listen, we've got another hurricane coming about 9 o'clock, 9.30. 
[00:06:30]  It's man-made.  It's for Hurricane Lehman Brothers.  Hurricane Lehman Brothers is hitting New York City, and actually it's hitting the world.  If you're in the market, panic, sell.  Sell everything.  Sell, Mortimer.  Well, you've got the Lehman Brothers, a financial company, going belly up.  Yeah.  And then someone's going to buy them.  I don't even know who because I don't follow it that closely.  And they decided, we ain't buying this piece of crap company because they wanted, like...  It was Bank of America, yeah.  Oh, it was Bank of America.  They wanted a guarantee from the government that they would be bailed out if there's problems 
[00:07:00]  or something like that, right?  Am I pretty close?  Bank of America is buying Merrill Lynch.  They just bought Merrill Lynch, but they were also in talks with Lehman Brothers for a while,  and then they said, wow, they're in trouble, and the government's not bailing them out.  Yeah.  And what's his name?  Who was the old Fed guy?  Greenspan.  Greenspan said, he goes, I don't think the government should bail them out.  He goes, there are companies that are going to survive and companies that are going to fail.  Yeah.  He goes, why should the government step in and save every failing company?  It's like just, you know, survival of the fittest kind of thing. 
[00:07:30]  Sure.  But they dragged everyone in on a Sunday, on their day off at Lehman Brothers.  Imagine getting that call.  You're just like, you know, yeah, you want to come in today?  It's Sunday.  Yeah.  We got an important announcement to make, though.  Why don't you come in?  Just bring a box.  Bring just any box.  Big enough for, let's, I don't know, let me just pick something at random. 
[00:08:00]  All your stuff here.  All right.  You know, if you didn't know any better, it just looked like coverage of Hurricane Ike.  Yeah, yeah.  People preparing for Hurricane Ike.  Lehman refugees.  Yeah, they're removing their boxes of material from their, in this case, their cubicles instead of their houses.  Do you think they all had their nameplate on top of the box?  That's how it is in the cartoons when people are fired.  But it's a bad scene.  They were hauling their stuff out of the building over the weekend.  Yeah, that's got to be depressing on a Sunday. 
[00:08:30]  So 9, 9.30, it's going to be interesting, to say the least, to see what happens to the market.  What's happening in Tokyo?  We take our cue from Tokyo.  What's going on in Tokyo?  Tokyo's down 5%, and the London markets are frozen.  Blimey.  They're freaking out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They don't even want to take a chance?  No.  Wow.  12,000 people in New York are going to get cut, and that's 26,000 employees worldwide for these guys.  That's a big hit.  Yeah.  Oh, well, I think we'll get through it. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  They always talk about these things like they're, and it really is a good buying opportunity, I think.  Once this collapses today, pick a few stocks, some real good ones that are just pulled down in the muck of today.  Some of your blue chips, you know, and scoop a few up.  You make it sound so easy.  Which ones?  What's not disappearing that takes a dip?  That's what you got to think.  What's not going away tomorrow? 
[00:09:30]  Although, I didn't think Lehman Brothers was going away.  Right, right.  I'm going to go with oil.  Some oil company.  Yeah, they're probably high, though, these days.  Oh, yeah.  I know it's not going away.  Pete's Emporium of Welcome to 2008 Hats.  Emporium.  I love that it's an Emporium.  It has to be an Emporium.  I don't know why.  It's Pete. 
[00:10:00]  Ted must be upset that he didn't think of it.  No, Jim's throat hurts.  Oh.  And Pete is soft-spoken.  Oh, Pete's here today, not Ted.  Pete is soft-spoken.  Anthony, how was that Corvette?  I was hearing some chatter in the office.  Well, you know.  Were you happy with the Corvette this weekend?  I take the sports cars out on the weekend.  I like cruising around.  You know, I have my stories that make people a little nervous because I like driving fast.  I didn't drive the Z06 very fast.  Why?  The Z06 Corvette. 
[00:10:30]  I don't like it.  It's squirrely.  And it doesn't handle well.  It kind of feels like it's going to leave the road when you stomp on it.  You jump on that thing, it'll move, but you've got to have two hands on the steering wheel  and really kind of, you know, keep the thing in lane.  And if you stomp on it and go to change lanes at the same time...  Forget about it, huh?  Like, I'm thinking if you're at English Town, New Jersey, the thing probably kicks ass.  You know? 
[00:11:00]  You burn out.  You heat your tires up so the rear end doesn't go out to the side like it does when you jump on it.  And then hold your straight line until you cross the finish line.  But around turns, if you're goosing it, at speed...  Like, I was driving in this morning in it, and I'm like, I'm doing 85, and I really don't like the feeling this car has given me.  At 85?  At 85.  And I drive my Escalade in at 95 sometimes. 
[00:11:30]  And it handles better.  I just didn't like it.  I like my Shelby better.  I like the weight of the Shelby a little bit.  It makes it handle better.  People say it oversteers it a little, but I don't think it does at all.  Is it safe to say that you didn't get this car up over 100?  No, I got...  Is this the first car you didn't get over 100?  No, at one point I got it to 104.  But that was it, and I was like, ugh.  And you backed it right off.  Yeah.  Didn't like it.  Sorry, vet owners. 
[00:12:00]  Sorry, Z06 people that are just like, it's the best car ever.  I drove it.  You know what you're doing, right?  I didn't like it.  We're going to have nothing but Corvette phone calls.  Oh, I know.  People will be bitching.  They're going to have to pretend they're Corvettes now.  They like their vets.  The vet owners are very loyal car guys and stuff like that.  If you like it, that's fine.  Don't call up and say you got a bad one or this, that, the other.  Whatever.  I personally didn't like the car.  Oh, boy.  So I hope next week I get the Ferrari again because I really didn't like this one very much. 
[00:12:30]  And how much did, oh, whatever.  Oh, and I've never driven a car, any car, including the Escalade again, that went through as much gas as this thing went through.  Holy Jesus.  The Corvette?  Yeah.  I had like a half a tank.  And I have to get local, but I got to, you know, get it to you.  I had about a half a tank at exit 49 on the expressway.  And I was running out of gas at exit 63. 
[00:13:00]  49 to 63, 14 exits.  Dude.  About two miles per exit.  Maybe that's a little high.  Yeah.  So you're talking, let's call it 25 miles.  It was sick.  Yeah.  It's safe to say 25 miles.  I was driving a little, you know, brutal.  I was kind of, you know, bop, bop, bop.  While you're watching the needle just go.  Yeah.  And then I look down and I hear boom, boom, boom.  Low fuel warning.  Like, what is this thing got a leak?  How were you driving on the right?  The two tires tipped up so it was leaking out the side.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  It just poured through gas. 
[00:13:30]  Man.  I don't know.  I didn't really, I didn't like it very much.  That's my review of the Z06 Corvette.  See, the gas price is kind of ticking upwards just because of this Hurricane Ike day.  We got a gouge when there's a hurricane in the Gulf.  All our refineries apparently all get wiped out and have to be rebuilt.  Yeah.  They closed these things down.  They battened down the hatches and they're fine.  I think they lost, three of them came up from their moorings, but they battened them down  where they protect from oil spills and leaks and everything. 
[00:14:00]  And then they just re-moor them.  It's not like they're wiping out our oil production.  Well, what happens is they got to turn the whole thing off for a few days.  Yeah, for a couple of days.  That messes up the production.  I love the price gougers.  And you're not supposed to price gouge.  Well, you know, Joe freaking gas station owner is like, oh, Hurricane Ike, he goes out there.  Wait, what does he sound like?  Huh?  What does he sound like?  Oh, Hurricane Ike.  Hurricane Ike!  It must get... 
[00:14:30]  But you know, they get their stepladder out immediately.  Well, there's a price gouging law, but I know I could still push this seven to ten cents without anyone noticing.  The guy's whistling with a smile on his face with that big stick with a hook on it and all the numbers under his arm.  Yeah, he's got his numbers in a briefcase.  He's got the stepladder.  Yeah.  And he's going up that ladder.  He goes, those guys are fully aware of how far they can push it before people can take notice and go, hey, hey, you're price gouging.  I take down the three.  I put up the four. 
[00:15:00]  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, they just sneak it up a few cents.  Bastards.  Absolutely.  So that was a non-eventful weekend if you're not getting your car up over a hundred.  Yeah.  That sucks.  It was, yeah, I know, kind of ticked me off, but I'll get another one.  Yeah.  I'll get one next week.  All right.  Just getting warmed up.  It's a Monday.  Oh, we were talking about Hurricane Ike and everyone's like, did you see Geraldo get knocked over by a wave?  Yes.  I think we got the audio. 
[00:15:30]  We'll play right after the break.  Geraldo.  This Geraldo, I don't know.  He's kind of got a death sentence.  I don't know what his deal is these days.  He's trying to get his popularity back is what he's trying to do.  He's trying to be the sensational guy that gets the clip that everybody, other news agencies play.  Well, he sees that the clock is ticking.  He sees that there's a bunch of young gunslingers out there.  Yeah.  And they're taking his place, so he's trying to, like, be noticed.  Yeah, so he's got to get, what, pushed over by a wave? 
[00:16:00]  He's got to sit there the entire hurricane?  Yeah.  The eye is coming!  I guess what?  He waited until the eye passed over.  That was his big thing.  And what time was that?  Three.  Three in the morning?  Three in the morning when no one's watching.  There's Geraldo in the middle of the eye with the stars out and the crickets, you know, doing their cricket thing.  Some firefighters.  Yeah, we'll play the clip after the break.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, Opie and Anthony just getting warmed up.  Lots of phone calls already.  Very cool.  We'll go to the phones next as well.
