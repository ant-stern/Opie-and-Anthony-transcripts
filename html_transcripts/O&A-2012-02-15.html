<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' typical chaotic banter, including repeated declarations of "Today's O.P." and mocking "The Dopey and Agni show" as a breeding ground for violent extremists.  They then ridiculed a co-worker's monotone greeting, "Good morning, welcome aboard."  A discussion of one host's severe acid reflux followed, featuring graphic descriptions and humorous evolutionary speculation about the human anus.  This segued into complaints about Time Warner Cable's lack of MSG network access, preventing them from watching the New York Knicks games, particularly Jeremy Lin's impressive performances, which prompted numerous Lin-related puns.  A caller, Jimmy, shared similar frustrations with Time Warner and cable access issues.  The hosts vehemently criticized Time Warner, MSG, and other providers.  The conversation then shifted to Whitney Houston's death, TMZ's coverage, and her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, with highly critical and offensive comments about Bobbi Kristina's singing and appearance based on a YouTube video.  Technical difficulties playing a Jeremy Lin highlight reel led to frustrated outbursts directed at the sound engineer, Sam.  The show touched upon racial stereotypes in television commercials before concluding with critical commentary and a clip from Joan Rivers' reality show featuring Melissa Rivers.

The show continued with a discussion of the *Alice* theme song, its variations across seasons, and Linda Lavin's singing abilities, accompanied by sexually explicit and vulgar comments about Lavin and the show, as well as details about her personal life.  The hosts then delved into a behind-the-scenes conflict between Sam and Roland over unreleased audio recordings. Roland had insulted a staff member (whose identity was playfully obscured) and offered Troy (another staff member) a steak dinner and a handjob at a massage parlor to keep the recordings private.  The ensuing negotiations, involving escalating humor and suggestive language regarding the handjob and barbecue, dominated a significant portion of the segment. Guest Tom Papa arrived and was brought up to speed.  The segment ended with Nicole, still intoxicated from a morning show, recounting a disastrous Valentine's Day date due to a booking error.

The next segment focused on the dispute over Troy's recordings, containing Roland's disparaging remarks about E-Rock.  Opie, Anthony, Sam, and Kenny tried to convince Troy to release the recordings, using vulgar humor and offering bribes, including a handjob from Kenny.  Troy initially refused due to a promise to Roland, but eventually agreed to release them in exchange for Roland choosing a show guest.  The recordings, however, proved anticlimactic, mainly containing outtakes and Roland repeatedly saying "pussy" in reference to E-Rock.  The discussion centered on who benefited (primarily Troy) and who lost from the situation.  Tom Papa was again present as a guest.

The final segment began with a discussion about Gloria Estefan tickets, quickly turning into a vulgar critique of her music.  Internal staff conflicts resurfaced, with plans to punish Sam and assign Roland to host "the shit hour."  A remixed version of Henry Winkler's child safety PSAs, focusing on the words "anus" and "penis," was played, followed by a simulated phone sex call.  A Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway followed, involving trivia questions and frustration stemming from Roland's earlier denied photo opportunity with Springsteen. The giveaway was filled with expletives and descriptions of the Springsteen incident. The show ended with more banter, including discussions about Jimmy Norton's appearances, crude humor, speculation about Roland's motives for concealing the audio clip, a Valentine's Day card for Roland, and the hosts' opinions on women and their hormones.  Tom Papa remained a guest throughout a portion of this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  The Dopey and Agni show, their followers are violent extremists. 
[00:03:30]  I would have ridden this car go off.  They use every derogatory term on the planet, but they can't argue or debate.  You're a waste of life, you fucking pig.  The Dopey and Agni show is a slug machine.  You have lovely giant breasts.  My nipples are kind of hard right now.  Fuck yeah.  They were like little lizards licking at their foots.  That's what they done.  It's fucking brilliant.  The Dopey and Agni show, they breed violent extremists. 
[00:04:00]  They call that humor for some reason.  Welcome to the program.  These people are not part of the human race.  These people are not part of the human race.  These are anti-human.  They need to suck a dick to something.  That's what they're all doing.  They're the most vulnerable in society.  Ducky, ducky, fat, fat.  How dare you question the Dopey and Agni show.  Get used to it, man.  Let's go fucking have a good time.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Welcome aboard.  I heard him.  Come on.  Makes my morning.  What do you say?  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Wednesday morning.  That was what he said.  Have you pointed out yet?  And I apologize because I like doing the voice too.  I know it's your thing, but I can't help it.  Did you point out that he's completely disconnected when he says it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's no emotion to it.  There's no real. 
[00:05:00]  He doesn't care how you're doing.  He just feels compelled to say it.  You get out of the elevator and he goes, good morning, good morning.  And you assume that he's talking to someone else.  Because he's not directing it at you.  No, he doesn't really look at you.  Yeah, he just kind of sits there behind that little podium thing.  And it's just, good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  He doesn't even know we're talking about him.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he has no clue.  Jeez.  But you know what?  Some days when I walk in and he's not there, because I guess he walks around. 
[00:05:30]  What, is he checking the perimeter?  I don't know what he does.  And, yeah.  I don't know what half the people do around here.  I don't feel like my day is really complete.  I don't feel like I can really start my days like a little cup of coffee.  I'm glad you brought it to the show.  I love it.  It's hilarious.  It's great.  What do we got?  The hump day?  Is this the hump day?  That's what they call it in the radio biz, right?  Very big with the radio DJs.  Yeah.  Denaming your days. 
[00:06:00]  It's a hump day, right?  Yeah.  Middle of the week, the hump.  Mm-hmm.  Flying down to the other side.  Towards the weekend.  Towards the weekend, yeah.  Right, right.  That's what it is.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Right morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Ah, shit.  It's Whippin' Mouth Wednesday.  Oh, man.  Right?  I like that.  I like that Whippin' Mouth Wednesday still.  Wow-wee.  Wow, wow, wow.  Had a rough fucking night with this acid reflux. 
[00:06:30]  Ow.  I was just telling you.  You got the acid reflux.  I haven't had it in over a year, so now I'm like, what the fuck did I do different?  What did I do different?  Did you drink a bottle of stomach acid?  Yeah, exactly.  You realize I really shouldn't drink that.  Gargling with marinara sauce?  You realize that you just got that stomach acid just splashing around in there?  Sitting in there.  And it's powerful shit.  It could just eat away shit.  When you're walking around, you don't realize how powerful that stomach acid is. 
[00:07:00]  But when you have an acid reflux thing happening and it hits something, you're like, holy fuck,  that shit is dangerous.  Isn't that amazing how everything's figured out?  Like, all right, we'll keep that shit in the stomach.  Right.  And then we'll line the stomach with some stuff that you can't eat.  Right.  Like, who figured that out?  I don't know.  Gwad.  Who figured that shit out?  Did that actually work?  Like, was there a time where, you know, the prototype came out and then acid just fell  through his taint?  Because, like, he fucking didn't realize, like, oh, I got to coat that stomach with some 
[00:07:30]  shit.  That's probably how they invented the asshole.  Right.  The acid just went right through.  Had to come out somewhere.  You know, it's got to come out.  We'll just leave that there and then line the stomach.  And then they said, you know what?  That kind of makes sense.  Yeah, what the hell?  Let the food go in the body and then you could just release it.  We weren't thinking that.  We were thinking it would just kind of evaporate inside somehow.  It'll just go away.  But now that it, you know, the acid fell through is what now is called an asshole.  We called it the acid hole at first, but it just kind of mutated into asshole. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  It does make you wonder if there's a guad.  A guad.  Because, yeah.  How the hell did all this goop go and figure everything out on its own?  Figure out how it works.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the  word of God.  But if there was a God, wouldn't it be a simpler system?  Like, would there have to be acids that couldn't have a little flap?  Wouldn't God...  We just want miracles?  You know, you chew food, wouldn't it just go into your stomach and do something godly 
[00:08:30]  and then pop out your asshole?  Maybe God will miracle that food out of you.  That's a good point, too.  Yeah.  But fuck, man, I went to bed nice and early and then I had that first acid little bloop.  Oh, boy.  And when I get that, I know it's going to be 12 hours.  And I threw everything inside me that I had.  Fucking everything.  Yeah.  Tom's fucking Pepto.  The over-the-counter bullshit stuff that doesn't work.  Pepto doesn't work for you?  Didn't work?  Nothing.  Like, all that shit? 
[00:09:00]  Nothing.  Wow, that's bad.  So much stuff that when I delivered a pot roast this morning, it was gray in nature.  Jesus Christ.  It was gray in nature.  Oh.  It was gray in nature.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Because all the shit you...  Some people out there understand.  You poured inside of you?  I think so, yes.  Oh, man.  But just all night, man.  Like, the heavy fucking eyes where you know you're going to fall asleep.  And then, you know, you're popped up awake because of that acid just splashing around. 
[00:09:30]  And then at one point, I'm trying to sleep sitting up.  Have you ever tried to sleep sitting up?  I'm not in...  Like the elephant man?  Yeah.  I'm not in a hospital.  I'm in my house.  Like Rocky Dennis?  Yes.  You're propping up pillows?  Because you got to keep, you know, you got to keep the gravity working in your favor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And when this all hit years ago, Dr. Steve's like, well, why don't you put some bricks under  your mattress so you elevate your body?  I'm like, I'm not sleeping that way.  You get a nice mattress just to ruin it with bricks. 
[00:10:00]  Why does he throw a brick at his own head?  Thank you.  I wanted a better solution than propping up my bed with bricks so the gravity keeps the  acid down where it's supposed to be.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Why don't you give birth standing up like you're on a plane in the Serengeti?  But we love them.  Well, who wouldn't?  I am.  I am beyond furious with Time Warner Cable.  Oh, no.  I have to speak for the masses.  For being so good?  The fucking Knicks finally have a team, right? 
[00:10:30]  Amazing.  Finally.  And I'll say it again.  Yes, I wasn't a Knicks fan for a long fucking time.  And then they signed Carmelo Anthony and Stoudemire.  And if you remember, I said, I'm going to start looking at the Knicks now because they're  at least trying to put a team back together.  Then there's Jeremy Lin comes out of nowhere, right?  Oh, it's Lin Sanity.  Right.  So now I'm officially.  It's Lin Credible.  It certainly is.  It's Lin Samuels.  It's Lin.  Oh, she's dead.  It's Lin Ken Wasabarinsky. 
[00:11:00]  It's Linen Sheets.  There's just no place to go.  It's Lin Filter.  Everyone's trying, though.  They're going with Lin Sanity.  They are.  Lin Sanity.  They're going with Lin Sanity.  And Lin Credible, I've heard a lot.  Lin Credible, you like to?  It's absolutely Lin Credible.  Let's just put it this way.  Lin Credible.  This is how Lin Credible this kid is.  You even know.  Yes.  And you fucking hate basketball.  I know nothing of basketball, yet I know that this guy is the shit right now. 
[00:11:30]  I grew up in the basketball culture.  I loved it.  But I went away for a long time because the Knicks just weren't trying, it seemed like.  Yeah.  All I want is my team to try, and then I'm yours, man.  I'm yours, right?  I don't need championships.  I just need the team to be trying, putting good quality players on the court, nice presentation  when you go to the games.  Yeah.  That's right.  Anyway, so now I want to watch the Knicks.  I want to watch the Knicks because I'm a fucking huge fan again. 
[00:12:00]  Of course.  And this fucking Time Warner with this MSG thing, you can't watch the Knicks in New York  City.  Isn't that amazing?  I live two and a half miles from where they play.  And they're trying to make it sound like it's the best cable system around.  It sucks.  It stinks.  What is the problem with Time Warner and the Knicks?  Or MSG?  It's probably another one of these contract disputes.  How long has it been happening?  That they just fuck the viewer with?  And MSG...  It's been a while now. 
[00:12:30]  MSG is basically saying, well, fuck you.  They're not panicking for whatever reason.  Yeah.  I don't know the ins and outs of this.  All I know is I fucking, you know, I wrote out my cable bill yesterday.  It's the exact same price.  Oh, yeah.  You're not getting what you want.  Well, if it doesn't Time Warner go, well, look, obviously a lot of you guys get our  service for sports, so we have to fucking take some money off.  I bet you if I call them, they will.  No, I bet you in that little contract you signed, it said if there's any kind of dispute,  no money's taken off of the bill, and, you know, this is something you deal with. 
[00:13:00]  So why don't they say it like that in the small print?  You're fucked.  Because you never read that fucking thing anyway.  You just sign it, much like when you just click on, I accept all terms, and then you  click continue.  It's kind of paying attention to the Knicks game like it's AOL in 1994 or whatever, where  I'm just watching the score change.  Oh, God.  I'm just watching the score change.  You're all psyched watching, and then you just hear, goodbye. 
[00:13:30]  Wait, wait, wait, fuck, I'm not done.  Man, I'm just watching it go like 78-67, 78-69.  With no action whatsoever.  No, and then I'm hitting the box score to see how many points Lynn has.  This is how obsessed I am.  So then I go to NBA.com, and now I have to get an NBA pass, I guess, so I can watch it  online.  So you can watch it online.  But it says it'll take two weeks or something.  What?  I wanted to watch last night.  Why can't it just take two days or something?  Yeah, what the fuck is that about?  I don't know. 
[00:14:00]  I'm very confused.  That's crazy.  But with that said, the Knicks played in Toronto last night, and it's worth mentioning because  the Knicks were getting their ass kicked all night long.  Lynn had an okay first half.  Everyone's expecting him to have a dud of a game.  He's been a starter for the Knicks for six straight games, I believe, at this point.  Hype.  They come back in the second half.  The kid scores 27 points in the end, and then he fucking has the winning three-pointer  at the end. 
[00:14:30]  The buzzer beater.  The buzzer beater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Linsanity, Ant.  It's total Linsanity.  But the problem with this whole thing, now Mars feels like me and him can talk basketball  every morning.  Oh, my God.  I walked in here.  Holy shit, Mars.  I got to prepare for a radio show.  I love you, but how about 30 seconds?  And then he's like, I don't even know.  What were you saying this morning?  Ah.  I was telling you, I was telling you, I was, did you realize the stadium was rooting for  him when he did the shot? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, but they went crazy.  Damn, that's a good player.  But you would think, you know, the whole league is into Linsanity, and to a point maybe they  are.  But what happened in Toronto last night was it was Asian Appreciation Night.  Oh, boy.  So the stands were filled with Asians.  They had 20,000 people watching this game last night.  And the parking lot was full of wrecked cars.  Please.  So, you know, I lived in Buffalo.  I used to go to Toronto every once in a while.  There is an Asian culture up there.  My God.  The Asians love Toronto. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know why.  And they all came out for the game last night.  I walked in here this morning, and Mars is talking to you like this is a sports bar.  Like it's a fucking sports bar, and you two are best buds.  Oh, my God.  He found an in.  I've listened to the shit show many a time when you've discussed.  What's that?  After.  What?  When you've discussed, you know, the Mars-Opie dynamic, how Mars wants to be buddy-buddy  with Opie.  And this now, he feels, is an in.  Oh, yeah.  Talking about Lynn and fucking the Knicks. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he was going off.  Like, honestly, I thought you two had like maybe hung out.  Oh, God.  He's so excited.  Oh, it's crazy.  Is he happy to see you in the morning and talk about the Lynn?  Oh, God.  The Lynn Saturday.  The reporter.  Jim, I couldn't wait for him to walk in through that.  Oh, yeah.  But you know what?  I mean, it's been a long time coming.  I mean, the Knicks fans have been suffering for a long time.  A long fucking time.  He just said it's been a long time coming, and I guarantee you Mars thought.  The friendship?  Yes. 
[00:16:30]  I hope he was going to comment on their relationship.  No, the Knicks.  Not your relationship.  Why don't you guys go to a game together?  I mean, you both be workers.  That would be nice.  No, my mom said many years ago, clean up your fucking room.  Wait a minute.  Oh.  But when she wasn't saying that 10 times a day and throwing our rooms out on the driveway  because we left sneakers out.  Oh, wow.  She did tell me that if you're lucky, consider yourself lucky if you could count your friends 
[00:17:00]  on one hand.  Yeah.  And I laughed at her because I'm like, I'm a kid.  I got 800 million fucking friends.  What are you talking about?  She's got two stumps.  Yeah.  But when you get older.  Right.  When you get older, she's like, if you have five solid friends, that's good.  You're doing good.  And I didn't really understand, but I think she's right.  So Mars, guess what?  I don't know if you're going to make the pinky finger.  Very hard to make the cut of a new friend when you're in your 40s.  When you get a little older. 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm in my 40s.  Child of the 80s.  I have no idea.  Fuckwad.  Mm-hmm.  So let me read you this.  My brother Brett, the owner of FH Riley's, right?  She's got the big brain on Brett.  Just trying to stress this insanity really quickly for you.  He texted me last night.  He goes, where does it start?  Oh, boy.  He wrote Cool Beans.  I don't know what the hell is about.  People, that's what children of the 80s say. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Oh, he goes, tonight was the first, because we were talking before that.  He goes, tonight was the first b-ball game I've watched in over 20 years.  Wow.  Weird but cool to watch again.  Because he was a basketball fan as well.  But my family, we were all into the Knicks big time.  My dad was a really good basketball player and got us all into it.  And yeah, like myself, he bailed for a long fucking time.  He's single-handedly bringing back at least the Knicks, like fans of the Knicks, I think.  They're talking about him in other cities. 
[00:18:30]  Because in this day and age, I don't understand this.  Because if you're an athlete, you don't go under the radar like this kid did.  Yeah.  Do you understand?  He was sleeping on his brother's couch a mere couple weeks ago.  And now he's putting up all-star numbers?  People always sleep a lot to a room.  You are right about that.  I know they were interviewing him after the game.  And I'm watching, and I was very surprised. 
[00:19:00]  Why?  Because I thought he was an import.  He's a Harvard grad, sir.  I didn't know he was a domestic.  He's a Harvard grad.  Harvard.  Oh, I'm a Yale man.  I thought he was going to be like, ah, shoot the ball.  But I was like, no.  The guy's like, yeah, well, you know, it's a good game.  I'm like, what the fuck?  That makes no sense.  It's very covert.  And it's probably hack, but I mean, you know, for an Asian, he knows how to fucking drive.  Toward the hoop. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, that's pretty good.  Toward the hoop, huh?  Yeah, all right.  I'll give you that one.  Remember, can you imagine trying to talk about this on regular radio, how you couldn't mention?  Oh, my God.  We would have had to go over the dump sheet.  Yeah, we dumped out of all that.  Yeah.  Don't mention that he's Asian.  Yeah.  No one will notice.  Really?  What?  And now they're selling Lynn jerseys like crazy.  I went to a Knicks game, what was it, nine, ten days ago, and I watched him play.  This was early on in the phenomenon, and I'm like, holy shit, I think I might want to get a Lynn T-shirt. 
[00:20:00]  And as I'm walking out of Madison Square Garden, they didn't have any Lynn T-shirts.  That's how new this whole thing was.  I want shirts to say, com, right?  Com, right?  Remember when I said I'm going to get the NBA League pass so I can watch Lynn because time  warn us a bunch of fuckwats?  Right.  Seems like just yesterday.  Ready for this?  This is going to drive Jimmy nuts, especially.  Jimmy, go ahead in Queens.  Yes, I'm here.  Now, I tried to get the NHL pass because I'm a Ranger fan, sorry, Ope, but if you get the  NHL pass, just like the NBA pass, you're not going to be able to get it because it 
[00:20:30]  is a New York market.  You get every other game.  Oh.  So, wow, do they fuck you.  They fuck you every chance they get.  So, as a Time Warner fucking customer, I can't watch my Knicks, and I'm an Islanders fan,  sort of.  I mean, I'm on the fence with them right now, but they are playing better hockey.  I can't watch them from my apartment.  Nope.  Do they block out those fucking games because they assume everyone is going to go to the 
[00:21:00]  live fucking game?  Well, that's the league.  That's not the Time Warner.  That's the league blocking the local.  That is fucking.  They won't allow you to get your local teams.  But when the NBA go, you know, you're fucking us at this point, so we're going to allow you  to watch your local team because you can't watch your local team because your cable company  is a bunch of cunts.  Because all you would be doing is watching the MSG feed.  Who cares?  Oh, is that what it is?  Well, yeah.  I mean, if you're in Ohio and you have the NBA league pass, you're watching the MSG feed 
[00:21:30]  of the Knicks.  How the fuck do I watch the New York Knicks?  Buy a ticket.  You got to go to the game.  Buy a ticket and go to the fucking game.  You got to go to the game.  And another thing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  There's no other way to watch the Knicks.  Well, you got to go online.  I have a bootleg website I can get you.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  I'm bootlegging my ass off.  Yeah, Fios.  Is this Fios out of it?  Fios has it, and so does DirecTV.  I have DirecTV coming to me and Broad Channel on the 28th, and I'm going to get the DirecTV  and the Fios internet. 
[00:22:00]  Fios is magical.  Fios is magical.  I can't wait for all these.  I know, but Fios is not by me yet.  They have it at Rockaway Beach, but it hasn't made the world.  I don't know if it's going to now.  Can you still get it like in your building, you think, Fios?  Fios?  Yeah.  It's already wired?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're installing the building next to me.  But they're also in cahoots with the cable companies now, here and there.  Yeah, they're all in there.  And also, Time Warner, February 28th, they gave you MSG.  MSG became the NBA channel, and MSG2 became the NHL network.  They're considered that in a sports package.  That free preview was going to be over on February 29th, which is normally $5.95. 
[00:22:30]  So your bill is magically going to go up another $5.95 after that, unless you call those jackass  and say, look, I don't want that shit.  Even though you're not going to get it?  I didn't know that.  MSG and MSG2 have changed.  Now it's NBA and NHL network.  They're considering that the so-called sports package.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, and as of February 29th, it's free now because of MSG, of course.  But as of February 29th, it goes up to $5.95 a month charged. 
[00:23:00]  So your bill is going to magically go up.  So I canceled that, and then a day later, I said, you know what?  I'm done with you, and I ordered DirecTV.  Because Fios is not going to be by me in the water, because I'm in the water.  And it won't be by me until at least June, July.  You know what?  Fios will be over.  The customer just gets fucked over all the time.  Let me charge me $6.95 a month for MSG, and I'll pay.  Right.  You know, they're a bunch of scumbags.  Boys, you have a great day.  Take care.  I'll listen to you later.  Ah, thank you.  They are scumbags.  Good call, Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[00:23:30]  They're really, these companies, they don't give a fuck about whether you stay or not.  No.  They don't care.  Now that's crazy.  I didn't know about that NHL thing, because I noticed that all of a sudden, NHL Network  was free for me.  I was out of Time Warner, and that explains why.  They're not, they didn't send me an email or a letter saying, hey, don't forget to cancel  this before, uh, holy shit.  It's the sample.  I just got a, I got a couple websites.  Dude, why do you wait for something? 
[00:24:00]  If you get Fios, you will be like, oh my God, why didn't I do this fucking, like, months  ago?  It's the same reason he doesn't have an iPhone.  And they're going to stop offering it.  Samsung Nexus.  Oh boy.  You really need Fios.  You would be using it.  You would be using it.  You could watch these games.  You sit there, it's something as simple as scrolling through the guide.  You, it's infuriating scrolling through that fucking guide that stops every third fucking  time you hit the button, and then if you hit it three times, it goes forward three more. 
[00:24:30]  It's fucking infuriating.  I want to suffer alongside my fellow man.  Is that it?  You're keeping it real?  I'm keeping it real.  I'm keeping it real.  I like keeping things as fake as possible, and I love my guide scroll.  I like to be close to my roots.  Oh boy.  I hate roots.  Believe me.  If you could guarantee me that I could watch the Knicks and maybe a little Islanders hockey,  then I think I got to go Fios.  You've got to.  Fuck Time Warner.  What are they doing?  Fuck Time Warner and fuck Cablevision up their asses. 
[00:25:00]  And of course it all comes down to greed, I guarantee.  It's just a greed thing.  Corporate greed, man.  So MSG is not budging, though.  So what are they thinking?  I don't know.  Both sides have been really kind of quiet about the whole thing since January 1st when  they yanked the channels off the network.  So it's kind of hard to determine who's in the right and who's in the wrong in this, but  they're just arguing over how much, you know.  Apparently, MSG wanted 53% more than they were getting, and then MSG said, no, that's 
[00:25:30]  not true.  But they refused to release, you know, how much they really want.  But yeah, in the end, you're just getting fucked.  Let me say hi to Birdman.  Birdman.  What's happening?  Why don't you move so long out?  Well, I actually don't like living in the city.  I hate the fucking people.  But I don't want to do that commute anymore.  What'd you say, Robin?  I had Batman.  Hey, listen.  I had Nick tickets.  I'm the same way you are, right?  Yeah.  I had Nick tickets.  I'd be seven fucking ten thousand a year. 
[00:26:00]  That was very funny.  Hey, Batman.  Hey, Batman.  He just blurted that out.  Oh, man?  Yeah, you're very funny.  Yeah, because I was calling you Robin because it was a bird thing, but you went, Batman.  Hey, Batman.  Hey, listen.  You guys are fucking dicks.  I can't talk now.  Hey, I had Nick tickets, right?  When, you know, when Ewing used to play.  Yeah.  Ewing!  And them guys, right?  I had them for a couple years. 
[00:26:30]  I spent like ten grand.  You're like, what the fuck am I spending all this money on?  Because you thought Ewing was going to give us a championship.  That's why you spent the money.  And now, look, I want to get the tickets back now, and you can't even get them now.  That's fucking ridiculous.  They ask you like twice the amount of money now for the tickets.  That fast, they fucking realize, hey, we got something here.  Let's charge people off the fucking nozzle.  We got to talk Knicks basketball a little more because it's bringing out the dirty New York  guys.  I love it.  Yeah.  These are like the fucking hardcore New York guys.  Well, I got to go take a shit at them. 
[00:27:00]  See?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  You know what I'm talking about.  So, Linsanity continues.  I thought last night was going to be the game where, all right, you know, let's all calm  down a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Because Toronto was kicking their ass.  You got the final play?  I think it's worth playing.  It was on NBA.com.  It's when everybody loves those exciting end-of-the-game moments where everybody goes, bah!  Yeah.  Something very cool about that. 
[00:27:30]  Green Giant.  Oh, boy.  Jolly Green Giant.  What do we got on Whitney Houston as we get that clip together?  She's dead.  She's still dead.  She's still dead, right?  Yeah, it's crazy.  TMZ, we were saying this, man.  They're fucking vultures.  Vultures.  Yeah.  They love showing the picture of the gravy tray in the bathtub.  Oh, that little gravy boat in the fucking...  Gravy boat, right?  Yeah.  The gravy boat in the tub.  They're so pissed they don't got a dead body picture.  No.  They wanted it.  They're going to show you everything else. 
[00:28:00]  They wanted it.  Well, she's having her funeral at that smaller venue.  It's going to be invitation only.  Yeah.  Star-studded, I would believe.  You get some performances.  Yeah, I got mine.  I RSVP'd.  I was like, nah, I can't make it.  You're not going to go?  I'm going to go.  Nah, I'm not going to Newark.  I think I'm going to go.  Yeah.  She's going to be there.  They're going to do a bunch of songs and shit.  Yeah.  And, yeah, they're keeping it smaller than that big public thing.  You know what the controversy is? 
[00:28:30]  What's the big controversy now?  Will Bobby Brown be there?  Yes, yes.  Family members don't want Bobby Brown there.  He'll be there.  He has to be there.  He's your ex-husband.  His daughter's there.  Oh, Bobby Christina.  Bobby Christina.  I watched it.  Yeah.  I watched a video last night of her singing a cappella on her bed or something.  It's just like one of these teen videos.  It's not as good as everyone's saying.  Dude, she stinks.  I love it.  Wait, who is it?  Who is it?  Bobby.  Is it new or is it like she was a while ago?  I don't know.  They're trying to say that she's got her mom's talent, a little bit of it. 
[00:29:00]  Nah, well, during the last years of her life, maybe.  Well, and she's already doing some things, like her mom.  What I heard is gravelly voice and no range.  Can we hear her?  Yeah, I'd like to hear that video.  Yeah.  And man, is she a gap tooth.  Wow, she's got a big gappy tooth and she looks more like Bobby Brown than the young Whitney.  Oh, yeah, she does.  Yeah, it's just, oh, boy.  Now we're going to watch young Sam toiling, toiling with it. 
[00:29:30]  Why wouldn't you go to YouTube where I fucking saw it?  What?  No!  That's not her.  That's not her singing.  Oh.  That's not her.  I think that's Cindy Law's commercial.  Why don't you guys take a break?  If this isn't the video that I saw last night.  This, of course, an unimaginably tough time for Whitney Houston's daughter.  Oh, shut up.  I thought for Whitney.  Confined to that box. 
[00:30:00]  Teenager taken to the hospital Sunday, overcome with grief after her mother's death.  This ain't it.  The question now, what's next for her?  This ain't it.  Will she follow her mother in the music business?  Bobby Christina showed off her voice last year, singing Adele in this YouTube video named  Bobby Christina Brown, Nevermind, I'll Find Someone Like You.  Nevermind, I'll Find You.  Someone like you.  Look at her.  I wish nothing but the best for you. 
[00:30:30]  Dude, don't forget me.  I'll bet.  Oh, boy.  She's not that good, is she?  She's a cute kid, but I would...  She's a cute kid.  What are you doing?  Yeah, I think she's crazy.  Are you kidding me?  Really?  I think she's gonna attack you for that, Jimmy.  She is fucking ugly.  Let me see her face again.  She is dog ugly.  Hey, look, I'm sorry about what she's going through.  Yeah, but...  It's gotta be tough for a kid, but...  Let me see.  Oh, she's not a cute kid.  I don't think she's ugly.  She is.  No, she's not. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, Jimmy, you're...  Damn.  I think you're wrong.  I think she's...  I like a little gap tooth, though.  I think that's kind of cute.  A little gap tooth?  Yeah.  There is a lot of wind escaping as she tries to sing.  Man.  Oh, Christ almighty.  I think the issue there is the fact of her obvious lack of gift being passed on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, a few of the pictures, if you Google image her, is not bad.  I think it's when she opens her mouth.  She's gotta get some veneers.  She looks more like Bobby Brown, though.  I think so.  More than Whitney, and it's, you know... 
[00:31:30]  I think so.  Young Whitney was a pretty woman.  Yeah, man.  A pretty young woman.  Look at that.  Come on.  Big forehead.  Big forehead.  But that was not a good song.  No.  I would say no.  I didn't care for that at all.  Performance was lackluster.  Yes.  Did we discuss what CNN did when this whole news went down?  What'd they do?  They went tabloid.  They blamed Bush?  They blamed Bush, right?  They went tabloid.  They had a guy on the street.  We should...  If you could find this audio, it would be pretty good. 
[00:32:00]  I meant to tell you guys about this a few days ago.  Fucking...  They go on the street, and they...  Instead of going, what's your feelings about Whitney Houston's death?  Something like that.  They go, did you hear about Whitney Houston?  And then the person's like, what?  No.  Oh, no.  She died.  They're just shocking people on the street?  It was more of a shocking thing.  That's pretty good.  They've always hit the street and want to get what people are saying, but they usually  kind of soften the delivery, like, what's your thoughts on the passing of Whitney Houston? 
[00:32:30]  Right.  And then maybe they'll get a couple people that didn't know.  They just go, she's dead!  Yeah, but this one, they really set it up by going, did you hear?  That's pricks.  Huh?  Pricks?  I've never seen CNN do that before.  Obviously, all the tabloid places, but...  Trying to get some ratings.  Yeah.  Some of them rating points.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to go, Jeremy Lin.  Last shot.  You got that still?  Yeah.  Where'd that be?  So this is how it ended last night. 
[00:33:00]  Lin for the win!  Got it!  How about the...  How about...  A little lead-up would have been nice.  A little more lead-up.  Sam, what about the lead-up?  Sam, what are you doing?  The ball was in the air.  Yeah, you start the thing, the ball is, like, fucking on its way down.  Everyone appreciates the setup where you're like, oh, boy, here he comes up court.  What's going to happen?  It's a little anticipation.  I know.  Well, you put it on the guy.  He's throwing his bag in the trunk in the parking lot on his way home.  Is that how they put the clip online?  Yeah, I didn't edit it.  No!  No!  You did edit it.  You fast-forwarded a little bit. 
[00:33:30]  Six seconds.  Six seconds!  That's a long...  Go to the beginning.  Sam doesn't understand sports.  Not at all.  Six seconds.  No, no.  Six seconds is a long time, Sam.  It's a long time in sport.  Go all the way to the beginning.  Yeah, go all the way.  Sam's a creep.  Sam is terrible at the computer now.  He really is.  He's good at doing ten radio shows, but...  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's hear this clip.  Go from the beginning.  I'm trying to.  I have to reload it now.  Oh, Sam!  Fucking boo!  Wow, you are the worst.  You know what you got?  What?  This is...  That's right. 
[00:34:00]  Every day, excuses with that intertubes.  Wow.  Oh, the Daily Show did it on Monday, the CNN clip.  Yeah.  Oh, they did.  If you can find it.  I'm going to do this.  Oh, boy.  What is this now?  It's a commercial.  I don't care about Hotels.com.  Why do you go to the NBA?  Go to the...  No, no, no.  We got it.  Go to the YouTube.  It really has destroyed being able to use clips on the radio, these stupid commercials.  I hate it. 
[00:34:30]  And then you got to watch the progress bar moving slowly to the right.  You really do realize how long 30 seconds is.  Oh, it's an eternity.  I love when they say you can skip this ad in four to...  Immediately, I'm sending a message if I skip it.  Immediately, they'll know this commercial stinks.  Yeah.  Hit it.  Oh, this is the recap.  Oh, it's the recap.  What the fuck did you do, Sam? 
[00:35:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I want to take your face, push it into the screen, and go, what did you do?  Like a dog.  What did you do?  No.  No.  Another commercial?  Another commercial.  All right.  It's on YouTube.  Go to YouTube.  Sam, you are the worst person on the internet.  And off.  Why did you have to say on the internet?  Well, working the internet.  Trying to punch stuff up.  I would have just went with worst person.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's true.  On Earth would have been good.  That's true.  Worst person on Earth, Sam. 
[00:35:30]  I'm sorry.  That's your title today.  Oh, God.  Go to YouTube before I bite you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He does not assert.  It's pandas.  And we don't even have video.  That's right.  Now what happened?  We left the audio on.  Oh, you're right there.  I am exhausted.  I'm exhausted from Sam.  That's not a real video.  Oh, no.  It's like, I hate those videos when they're just linked to another site. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, it's terrible.  That's why we did NBA.  All right.  Now what do we got?  Don't make it sound like you had some plan to give us the best possible feed.  All right.  Here we go.  We can all watch TV.  Thanks.  They decided to let him take the shot, obviously.  Everyone spread the court.  This is unbelievable. 
[00:36:30]  You see the crowd.  They're in Toronto.  Amazing, right?  Yeah, they're in Toronto.  Well, Asian Appreciation Night helped that.  Ah.  What the fuck?  That's the away stadium.  It's away and they're fucking losing their minds.  People have only heard of them two weeks ago.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[00:37:00]  Two weeks ago.  Look at that.  They're losing.  They're losing.  They're losing.  They're winning.  He's going to be just like Tim Tebow.  Tim Tebow.  You know, he'll have a bunch of great games.  I want to thank Buddha.  You remember?  Yeah.  No, let me tell you something about this kid.  He's got the skills.  I'm just amazed that he went under the radar.  I don't get it because he really knows.  That happens all the time, though.  I don't think so.  Tom Brady?  What round was he picking?  Oh, well.  The fifth.  Yeah.  All right.  You're right. 
[00:37:30]  No, it was very, very late.  But this happens all the time.  I don't think Brady had an injury.  I think Brady had a back injury.  I think every once in a while.  Jimmy, did I say that all serious?  I think it happens every once in a while.  Yeah, every once in a while.  All right.  Because it wasn't like Tim.  A guy from Harvard is going to come and surprise you.  Harvard.  No one gives a fuck about Harvard basketball.  Is he a Harvard guy?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Harvard.  He's articling it.  I love him.  Oh.  From Harvard.  Oh.  Maybe Iraq will play that going into a break.  We love Harvard.  And we love Norm MacDonald. 
[00:38:00]  Harvard.  And he's a gay.  Megan's got a theory on why you suck at Googling.  Uh-oh.  Good.  Megan from D.C.  She's a regular aunt.  He sucks at everything else, too.  Megan, you're a regular aunt.  You made that joke.  Oh, sorry.  Are you on that?  Are you on that?  I love this theory about why Sam is so bad at Googling.  Yeah.  It's because he wasn't breastfed.  We need to go back to that.  They're a little bit intellectually deprived when they're not breastfed.  And Danny was.  And he's so fast.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true. 
[00:38:30]  Could we maybe get you breastfed?  Breastfed.  In honor of Jeremy Lynn.  I'm talking worse than usual.  What?  No.  Could you go home and do a little breastfeeding with your mom today?  Just so the Googling skills get sharper.  I'll see if there's any milk in there.  I don't know.  Adorable.  Well, I mean, I'll do it if it improves for Google.  You know, Google's important for the show.  Would you breastfeed with your mom for the show?  Yeah, that's what the show required, of course.  How about if I had the other one?  You had one.  We'll make eye contact. 
[00:39:00]  I was going to say very bad things.  What were you going to say?  Just horrible, horrible things.  Nothing.  But I was just going to say that if we're both breastfeeding, we make eye contact over them.  And then we each touch the thigh and see whose thigh gets damp faster.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:30]  Now I understood why you didn't say that.  I had to feel good about that one.  Yeah.  Too bad about it.  Kevin from Con on Twitter, C-O-N-N.  Tom Brady went in the sixth round, 199th overall.  But that's not all the time.  No.  It happens, yes.  I agree.  More often, like, the number one pick ends up being a bust.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I want to see if it had any dislikes.  What?  I want to see if the Jeremy Lin clip had those dislikes. 
[00:40:00]  It's like, I like it when it goes in the basket.  I like when it bounces.  But you should have to give your real name if you put a dislike on something.  Well, please.  That's internet accountability.  What?  We're getting there.  What the hell is that?  We're getting there.  It's not the internet if you have accountability.  We're getting there.  Well, yeah.  With Twitter, you could just block people.  We're getting there.  People make new accounts.  They sure do.  But then they have no people that follow them.  So their chicanery doesn't really go to the masses. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  I mean, you just block them again.  They get bored and go away.  The end.  Eventually.  It's a Twitter story.  Eventually.  Yeah.  I was tweeting a little last night.  I go through phases.  What were you tweeting about?  I just leave it alone.  And then I start tweeting.  Anything good?  No, I was just tweeting basic observations from watching television.  The fact that one of my favorite channels of all time, Investigation Discovery. 
[00:41:00]  It's like one of my favorites now.  It's a boon to actors that are shitty recreation actors.  This channel has more recreations than any other channel.  You know, they got a murder investigation discovery.  Investigate.  And I noticed that the recreation actors, slightly teeny weeny bit better looking than the real people. 
[00:41:30]  Just a little bit.  Meaning a lot.  No, you know what?  They're not all that good looking.  They are, but they're slightly better looking.  Well, they got to go Hollywood a little bit, right?  Like they got the, that's just it.  These actors, they're not good actors.  I don't think they get a lot of work.  There's just such a quantity of shitty recreation needs on this channel that they're just gathering up people and throwing them on this channel. 
[00:42:00]  And it's hilarious because they just, they have to act like, you know, an obsessed stalker guy.  And he's real over the top.  And, you know, they just take a spray bottle and spray sweat on him.  All right, action.  He's just sweating.  And they do a lot of grainy close-up shots.  And he's just got to look to your range.  And the actor's probably just thinking the person's name, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane.  Yeah, yeah.  Diane, Diane.  What's her name?  I'm just going to say, when I come on set, could you just treat me like I was a stalker?  Shut up. 
[00:42:30]  You're making scale.  Who stalked that fatso?  Oh, I know.  She's pregnant.  Oh, is she?  She's still a fatso.  Is she the one that, like, maybe she went over a friend's house and tried to steal the baby?  Love those stories.  You think they just go to a local acting class and get some of these guys?  This is summer stock they're going to.  They're going to fucking, yeah, local theaters.  Yeah.  And, yeah, they show up because they're, I must, I probably watched, I watched a few of 
[00:43:00]  those shows where they have the woman and she marries some guy and they're in love and  then he turns out to be like a cocaine fucking smuggler.  Oh, nice.  It's like, who the bleep did I marry or some shit?  How the fuck don't you know that?  I know.  They're just ignat people that can't see.  His phone's ringing every 30 seconds and you can't fucking see anything.  Yeah.  I was watching that and I realized there's so many people that are involved in these recreations.  Yeah.  Not just the initial people but the, you know, peripheral characters and everything. 
[00:43:30]  So, yeah, a lot of those, a lot of those people.  And then I also noticed in commercials, I watched a lot of commercials.  It seems to me, I would like to see one commercial where an intelligent white person kind of helps  out a very perplexed black person.  You just don't see that anymore.  Thank God for black people because white people would just be walking around not knowing how  to buy aspirin.  Fuck insurance.  We have no clue how to buy insurance or, you know, for our kids or cars or anything like 
[00:44:00]  that.  Thank God.  Well, the black man's helping us out.  Yes.  I notice that all the time.  I appreciate it.  I notice that.  And people are tweeting like, why do you notice that?  What does it matter?  Like, it matters because it's just kind of indicative of our society these days and  how they're not portraying things.  What?  You said what?  Dick.  You said so.  Huh?  So. 
[00:44:30]  What happened?  What did I say?  Society?  What's that?  Socioty.  Oh, socioty.  Yeah, socioty.  I didn't understand you at first.  It's just a sign of a bigger issue.  That's what I say.  And then people called me a racist and I went, ha, ha, ha.  That's how I, that's how my Twitters usually end.  My Twitter sessions end.  When ten people call me a racist, I stop tweeting.  I don't really, I don't really care.  They have the black guy being the fucking, you know, strong one of these commercials.  But why can't they balance it out and have the white guy be strong in some of these commercials?  Because the white guy's too busy. 
[00:45:00]  That's what drives me nuts.  Being hand-pecked.  Just balance the shit out.  I don't give a fuck.  It's not.  The white guy's too busy being an idiot, being pushed around by his much smarter and craftier  wife.  Or knowing nothing but sitting around and watching sports.  Right.  With his cooler black friend that are hanging out at the house.  Do you like the commercial where the black couple's at a restaurant and the guy's trying  to like get the sports scores?  Oh, yeah.  And she goes, are you listening to the game?  I actually like that one. 
[00:45:30]  You do?  Yeah.  Because I'm not listening to the game.  Because the guy's a decent actor and it's fun.  It's not.  He's not hand-pecked.  He's doing something that's legitimately bad during a loving discussion.  I like that one.  Good.  That one doesn't bother me for some reason.  Fair enough.  Because he's not a dummy.  He's not like, oh, gee, I don't know what to do.  And he's eating an Excedrin PM box.  No, honey, open it.  But he wouldn't do that.  See, this commercial, he would be like, shut the fuck up.  I'm listening to the game, bitch. 
[00:46:00]  Well, I'm not mad that the company didn't bring in what might be domestic violence in  the black community to sell their product.  So, no, it might have been a smart decision for the company.  Okay.  Point taken.  You like it, though?  All right.  I guess it's not that bad.  Yeah.  I think it just turned me on.  Fuck it.  Yeah, play it.  This is just.  Fuck it.  I'm not going to.  They're watching TV.  I mean, they're talking.  I know.  This is great.  No, I feel like.  Did you just check the game on your phone? 
[00:46:30]  What?  No.  What am I, like some kind of summoner who can just summon footage to his phone like that?  Come on.  I guess I'm just a little.  He does go.  It's just that you and I.  That's all right.  That's not bad.  And he's staring at it the whole time.  Yes.  It's not bad.  Fair enough.  I'm not back commercial.  Can I get the Knicks that way?  Ah, see?  Fuck, I got to watch the Knicks now.  I'm obsessed.  You know what I was watching last night?  That fucking Nets.  No, because I think that's part of the MS2 or something. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  I was watching.  Maybe this is more for Sam.  I was watching Joan Rivers' reality show with her daughter.  Holy fuck does that show suck.  Is it getting good ratings?  Oh, it can't possibly be.  No, it doesn't have much of a buzz on it.  No, why it sucks is that you can tell they're just acting and making believe it's reality.  And their acting is horrible.  Joan Rivers is an amazing comedian.  I'm not going to, you know, of course.  And she works her balls off.  But Jody Melissa, Joan knows best. 
[00:47:30]  But, like, she was skeet shooting.  And it's obvious there's an edit because she was hitting every fucking clay pigeon.  Oh, stop.  It's so obvious.  And the acting is horrendous.  And then on top of it, you know, if I was Melissa Rivers, I would not be on TV at all.  No.  She comes across horribly.  I don't know what guy would want to be with her.  She's single?  I don't know.  Is she a kid?  She does, right?  She has a kid named Cooper that seems pretty well-adjusted.  But she stinks. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Isn't she supposed to be dating the guy from Vivid?  I guess.  But what I was seeing last night, she was trying to get together with the other guy, the old tennis pro or something.  Oh, look out.  I always had a crush on her growing up.  Melissa?  Yeah, always.  She's...  I think she's really cute.  I would hate to be in the same room as her.  She looks miserable all the time.  I don't know what she's...  It's like roughing it.  Well, roughing it for my mom is no turndown service and mitts on the pillow.  Maybe I'll go.  But you couldn't handle it.  I'm going. 
[00:48:30]  Going to Wyoming.  We're going to go shooting.  Does that say going backwards?  Not really.  No.  Thin women who smell a vomit.  Pull!  Riding.  This is killer.  Killer.  Killer.  Good God, Melissa.  You got it, Mom.  This is a goddamn death wish.  That's what this is.  Runny as a horse.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Fire.  Fire.  Fly fishing.  Go on.  Go on.  Go on.  It's like the good life of Paris Hilton.  I haven't seen anything, Melissa. 
[00:49:00]  I've heard of playing hard to get, but this is stupid.  Well, they just drag her around, put her in wacky situations.  That's exactly what they're doing.  Just dragging around.  Yeah.  Camping.  That's somebody going, you know what would be funny if Joan was just camping.  Ooh.  Let's put Joan in some positions she wouldn't normally be in.  Yeah.  I just don't like that Joan Rivers just drags her daughter into the entertainment business.  She has no business being in it.  I always gave her a choice, and she decided she wanted to be in the show business. 
[00:49:30]  She didn't get the gene.  Yeah.  She's not funny, and she comes across miserable on TV.  Barely smiles.  I checked it out last night.  I was just like.  I've never seen it.  Was Lynn on it?  Lynn Coplitz?  Yeah.  What's that about?  Well, they're friends.  They're really good friends.  Yeah.  Lynn is obviously a comic.  Very funny.  We've had her on the show.  Have we had Lynn on?  Yeah, a long time ago.  She's a good actor.  How did they become friends? 
[00:50:00]  Does she write for Joan?  No, no.  They did whatever Joan's.  Because she was on last night.  They did a show together.  Whatever the last show was, they were in together, and they just became friends.  I'm very jealous of her friendship with Joan Rivers, because Joan really loves her.  Yeah, you can tell.  Lynn was headlining a comedy club at one point, and Joan came to watch her.  She probably wishes Lynn was her daughter.  Think about it.  If you're a comic, you probably hope that your daughter is funny. 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  You might be just the opposite, because you don't want somebody who's following in your  footsteps so closely, because it's a reflection on you, good and bad.  So she might not want that.  Then you have to look at them, and try to do a bad joke, and go, oh, that's good.  I know every joke has been made about Joan Rivers and her plastic surgery, but I was watching  last night.  It looks like she's wearing a mask.  Yeah, it looks painful.  It looks like her real, obviously her real eyes, because you can't fuck with eyes, are  just looking through a mask. 
[00:51:00]  She was smiling and stuff, and most of her face doesn't move.  Yeah, between the cheek implants and the lip thing and the nose jobs.  I would love to talk to her about her documentary.  I thought it was amazing.  I really did.  But this shit, oh my god.  Oh, now she's like in a country bar.  Force reality, they call it.  What do they call it, Sam?  Assisted reality is the actual name.  Because they're lazy.  Because they're not getting people that, like the Osbournes.  The Osbournes didn't need assisted reality.  They were just all characters, and they knew, just roll the fucking cameras, you're going 
[00:51:30]  to get great stuff.  Now with this assisted reality, they've got to plan trips and little field trips and things.  Yeah, they've got to give them shit to do.  Right, because they know that them just sitting around, you're not going to get much out of them.  Right.  Those situations they put them in.  Oh boy, look out.  And the music, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah, yeah, they're playing that music while she's riding a horse.  Yeah.  All right, we get a country.  Got it. 
[00:52:00]  Worst theme song ever.  Well, maybe Alice, but this is really bad.  You don't like Alice?  Oh, the Alice theme song.  I've always hated that one.  And she's looking good.  She sings it herself.  I like that. 
[00:52:30]  Yay.  The kid just pops on.  Yay.  Where's the Alice theme song?  I think it was good.  There's a new girl in town and she's looking good.  Ah.  She's very jazzy.  And in between I cooked and cleaned and went out of my way.  All right, there we go.  We're going through life with blinders on.  It's tough to see.  Linda Lavin sang this herself. 
[00:53:00]  I'll get out from under and look for me.  Uh-oh.  There's a new girl in town and she's looking good.  God.  There's a fresh, fresh face in the neighborhood.  There's a new girl in town with a brand new star.  She was just one.  This must be a later episode.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Flo is gone? 
[00:53:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, Diane Ladd was in this?  Where's Flo?  She wanted more money.  Flo got her own show.  Did she?  Oh, she got a spinoff?  Did she get a spinoff?  What happened to Flo?  Flo got a spinoff.  I think she got a spinoff.  Kiss my clit?  I don't know.  I don't care.  You can always tell if it's a later episode when there's a bunch of clips from the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In the opening.  Yes.  Yeah, when they first put a show on, they got to come up with an opening. 
[00:54:00]  And then they just were like, ah, let's just put clips on of the show.  Who cares?  Like when they show the car driving somewhere, you know, that they're coming to a new town.  Right.  There's a new girl in town and she's looking good.  Ugh.  How about...  Frick, frickin' face in the name of my heart.  Eee.  I hate her.  You'd like that?  No!  How about the polish music?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She fancied herself this jazz singer. 
[00:54:30]  She used to show up on talk shows and just go through this shit.  She'd sing like it's like, oh, here's Linda Lavin from Alice.  What, she gonna talk about Alice?  No, she's fuckin' singing on like Mike Douglas or something.  Wait, did that go bump, bump, bump, bump, phone?  Yeah, she was like, bump, bump, bump, because that's supposed to be more jazzy.  Oh, God, she was terrible.  Is she dead? 
[00:55:00]  No.  No.  She was born in 37, I think.  What?  I'm guessing.  30s.  God.  I just saw it.  She was born in 75.  Yeah, I like, didn't the lyrics change?  Wasn't there one, and in the original one, she went,  Kicking myself for nothing was my favorite sport.  Oh, maybe.  Oh, what's this one?  When in between I cooked and cleaned and went out of my way.  This is Alfred's Lutter. 
[00:55:30]  Going through life with blinders on, it's tough to see.  You need first season, baby.  I had to get up, get out from under and look for me.  There's a new girl in town and she's looking good.  There's a fresh, I want to call this, in the neighborhood.  There's a new girl in town with a brand new star.  She won't just pass it through, but if things work out, she's gonna stay. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, did you see that?  Did you see that?  We gotta explain that.  She's just having a little fun with her son.  Yeah, she's just having a little fun with her son, sucking his cock.  Well, you gotta see the part.  She leaves the ice cream parlor.  Yeah.  And then the son leaves.  Oh, boy.  And then she turns around and the door hits her and the ice cream hits her face. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  And he's wiping chocolate off her face.  The son's wiping chocolate off her face.  You can't hear it because of the music, but he's saying, this reminds me of your German film days.  Go to season two or three original.  Oh, can I remember that line?  I always hated it.  Kicking myself for nothing was my favorite sport.  Oh, wow.  All right.  This might be.  And go.  Sorry, people.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Funniest thing, the saddest prize I never knew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kicking myself for nothing was my favorite sport.  Oh!  I had to take off and stop enjoying because life's too short.  Short!  Because life's too short!  This is the one I remember.  Season three.  Yes!  What a song for the neighbor. 
[00:57:30]  It's so great when you stand up.  What?  Here's Flo.  Ugh.  That old fucking bat.  She's shaking her ass.  How the hell are they?  You're doing fuck Flo?  No, but she's the one who'd suck your dick the best.  Oh, do we get a bop, bop, bop, bop?  Oh, no.  We got the.  Oh!  Fuck!  That's horrid.  See, but you remember?  Oh, man.  That was a bad one, too.  That was the second one where Vera drops all the straws and you're like, pick him up, 
[00:58:00]  you dizzy gunt!  So what, they redid the theme every year?  I didn't know that.  I didn't know either.  The first one, the first season one one is creepy looking because it's just the names.  Yeah.  And there's no footage shot of them or there's nothing to show.  Yeah.  Why'd they decide to put him on a dude ranch or something?  I don't know.  And then she gets hit in the face with some fucking ice cream.  And the sun wipes it off like so much Bukkake footage.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Woo!  Yeah, I guess every year she probably was like, you know, we ought to redo the theme song. 
[00:58:30]  It'll be my thing.  It'll be my thing.  You know, I'm really feeling a new vibe from it.  Yeesh.  Who is she married to?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, it's familiar.  Oh, Larry Levin.  A bunch of L's on their napkins and towels.  What does he do?  He doesn't have a page.  What is he?  Who is he?  It's his name.  Oh, Sam.  Why don't you know this?  I don't know anything.  Steve, uh...  Can we break?  Steve Bukkake? 
[00:59:00]  Steve Bukanis?  Eh, he just looks familiar.  What do I know?  He's got to deal with that fucking hag.  Not me.  Alice.  You wouldn't want to be married to Linda Lama.  Oh, God.  I put together a new song, Anthony.  You want to listen?  No.  There's a new guy.  All right.  There's a new dog in my house.  And it's...  Every song sounds like that.  Yeah.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  But she's just a waitress.  What's the whole new girl in town thing about?  There's some new sheets on my bed.  And, uh... 
[00:59:30]  Write a new song.  There's a new freckled face.  She's 40.  And she thinks she's a freckled face.  She's not a new freckled face gal.  In some shitty diner in some shitty town.  Yeah, she's singing about it like she's a...  This is not Mary Tyler Moore crap.  No.  You throw your fucking hat in the air.  Because you're in the big city.  There's a new liver spotted face in the neighborhood.  Was she capitalizing on the whole Mary Tyler Moore, I'm a woman thing?  On my own, I can make it.  Early to bed.  Early to rise. 
[01:00:00]  I look down and my uterus is hanging down in my thighs.  She's old.  Pushing black orderlies off me is my favorite spot.  What year did Alice run?  Wouldn't she be like a meth head?  Yeah.  A waitress in a shitty diner in a shitty town?  Shitty diner.  She's not going to bed early.  No.  76 to what?  85.  That was a nine-year run?  Wow.  All those shows went...  We only had three channels and she got nine years? 
[01:00:30]  I realize that's nine years.  The thing is, all those shows went way too fucking long.  That was the deal with the shows from the 70s into the 80s.  They went way too long.  The last five seasons or so are always just a disaster of them trying to hold on to something.  Happened with all those shows.  What about...  What about it?  I didn't get my thought.  Mary Tyler Moore was what?  I'm going to guess 72 to...  Was that...  How long is that? 
[01:01:00]  That was 11 seasons.  I think 82.  Yeah.  72, 83 years of preface?  I was going to say 10 years.  I was going to say 10 years.  I was going to say 10 years.  I think 11.  I think it was more mid-70s, no?  Wait, it aired on CBS from 70?  70 to 77.  77.  What?  70 to 77?  Wow.  Why did I think that was 11 seasons?  I thought it went into the 80s.  Oh, no, it matches 11 seasons.  I thought so, too.  Yeah.  I really thought so, too.  My goodness gracious.  We're going to break.  Ooh.  We got Tom Papa coming in later?  We do. 
[01:01:30]  And we might have tickets to something that we're not allowed to promote, I guess, right?  Ixnay on the Ixnay.  Can we at least say that, Sam?  You say that.  Big tickets.  A little bit.  It's a big ticket item.  A little bit.  Can we say that?  Oh, yeah.  And we have production for it.  And is Roland here?  We want to talk to Roland.  I haven't seen him yet.  We haven't heard that Roland's here yet.  Get it?  When Roland arrives, like, fucking red carpet right to the studio.  You want him in?  Oh, yeah.  Well, whisk him into the studio.  Please.  Sam was telling us some things that I want to discuss. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's got to be discussed.  All right.  Oh, no.  But first, it's Black History Month, right?  Month.  You said it right.  Month.  Yes, it is.  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show recognizes some of the individuals whose  contributions have shaped the African-American community and changed all of us for the better.  On this day, we celebrate the accomplishments of black mogul entrepreneur and musician Diddy.  Diddy changed the lives of young black men everywhere by proving that changing one's name several times over the course of only a few years is indeed legitimate. 
[01:02:30]  He also changed the way we look at hanger honors and dummies in hot tubs forever.  Honey, check it.  Check it.  Tell your friends to get with my friends.  We could be friends.  Shit, we could do this every weekend.  That's right.  All right?  Is that all right with you?  Yeah.  Keep banging.  Thank you, Diddy, for proving to us all that with talented friends, we can achieve anything. 
[01:03:00]  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions for Black History Month here on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Sorry, I've missed the road.  I'm sorry.  What do you do?  Maybe we...  Hold on.  What do you want to do?  You'll recognize us.  Okay.  Mustard.  It's a great anthem in my ears.

I don't know when the induction is  But the ceremony is April 14th  They're so going to get back together  Most of the original members  Just about all of them  Slash and Axl have issues  Well, if they do this  They could maybe  Open up the lines of communication  I don't know, though 
[01:10:00]  You've got to be there for the induction  I mean, that's something that you all participated in  Even if you hate each other  You know, you've got to put that aside  But then to put out an album or tour with each other  That's a whole other fucking thing  Yeah  I don't know  They don't like each other  And they have let it be known  Didn't we say yes to Axl?  We'd have him on the show?  But what?  We had to be here  Two in the morning or something?  Well, Axl will come in the show?  Roland didn't say it

[01:15:30]  It was actually not bad  Yeah, we gave it a hard time  But it was actually better than I thought  No, it was bad  I don't hate this, but I don't love it  I don't like the word Valentine for Nancy Chevelle  What if it rained  What if it rained  We didn't care  We didn't care  She said that someday soon  The sun was gonna shine  This voice sounds good, man  He's almost 70  Yeah, is he?  Still creating  God bless him  This love of mine  Doesn't suck, but when you know all the stuff he's done in the past 
[01:16:00]  How's Valentine's Day?  For you guys  It's just another day  Like I said, you know  I don't really celebrate Valentine's Day  Atta boy  But you gotta go  You gotta go  You know, you gotta do for people all year long  Not just one day  But did you at least acknowledge a little bit?  You go, happy Valentine's Day  I got so fucking sick of talking about Valentine's Day for two fucking weeks 
[01:16:30]  That the last thing you wanted to do was celebrate it  Would celebrate anything  Oh  Joe Walsh's face annoyed me the way he played guitar  Oh, he was making guitar faces  Mr. Intense?  Yeah  I can play this  He was making those guitar faces  I don't know, I think that might be really tough to do  Yeah  Gotta play really softly  I don't like his dumb wig  He's doing his orgasm face 
[01:17:00]  Look at him  Yeah  And so I do  Without a care  I like this more now though than I did when I first saw it  I know that Sunday soon  The sun is gonna shine  He's got some chord changes that sound pretty good  Yeah  They're very unique  But very  This is very, um, like, jazzy  Yeah  A little slow  I don't mind it  No, I like this more now than I really don't mind it  Like, I could picture this in a movie 
[01:17:30]  Somebody  Sure  You know, depressed, bummed  Hunched over a glass of whiskey at a smoky dark bar  Yeah  The candy hearts  No  Candy hearts are on the table  Every time you go, my valentine  The camera zooms in on the candy hearts  And there's big signs all over saying, happy valentine's day  Yeah  I don't mind it as much as I did when I first heard it  You're right  I mean, it's not my cup of tea  Hold on, I'm setting up the video now 
[01:18:00]  I have a video idea for my party  I'm sorry  No, no, no  It's a good one  I'm sorry, I'm sorry  And he goes, uh, the sun will shine  And you go to the window  And there's this big sun shining  It doesn't have to be literal, Jim  It can, you know, you can  He's doing a literal video  I know, I love literal video, Jim  Whenever there's rain  Whenever there goes rain  You show someone on a horse  And you show the reins  Oh, no  Wow  That's a different take on it  Yeah, the sunshine  Right  For valentine  Ah  And at the end, he's frolicking 
[01:18:30]  Yeah  Like, he's windmilling his arms happily  In a room full of candy hearts  Oh  Valentine  Well, that's good  Yeah, sure  I like that video  It's better the second time  That wasn't bad  You like that?  Yeah, I'm liking it better than I did the first time  I was just so jaded  I wanted to hear some Beatles  I wanted to hear the Beatles  Well, you got that at the end  Yeah  Yes, I didn't know we were going to get that at the end  But the Golden Slumber  Yeah  What's that song called? 
[01:19:00]  Golden Slumber  And then it's  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  Boy  You're going to carry the end  They have some amazing fucking melodies, don't they, the Beatles?  Yes  Ridiculous  Hey, speaking of great singers  You want to hear a great church singer  A great church singer  Yes, this is amazing  Are you ready for this?  Yeah  Well, this next and final song 
[01:19:30]  Is going to be one that has made me pretty famous  Over the last few years  It is  Great church singer  And she's famous for it  Do you want to guess?  No  All right  A lot of places I didn't think I would be at  But it was the first time on stage  New Year's Eve 2002  With one of the best quartets out there today  Brian Free and Assurance  And I was privileged to be able to sing this one  With Brian Free  And I don't know if I beat him that night or not 
[01:20:00]  But ever since then  We've had competitions  I've worn him out  Not to make me look good or anything  But that's what happened  But this is one that also  It's worth it  She's amazing  My friends in a hometown church  Gospel Like A Free Church  In Salisbury, North Carolina  Has really made their top choice  So therefore we're going to finish off with this one  It's called Looking for a City  Listen to this voice  Holy fuck  Like the honky tonk peony  I didn't know you were going to start out with it

Oh  Why you bleeding?  He didn't set my nose  I've been blowing my nose  Blood and snot in his tissue 
[01:24:30]  I can't look at that  Well, it's the dry air  Winter brings that dry air  Well, I know  Yeah, yeah  It's horrible  I am a virtual fucking snot factory  I'm like  It's terrible  Do you itch in the winter?  Because of the dry skin?  Fuck yeah  What's that about?  Terrible  Itchy  And I can't get all of my back with lotion  Oh, no  You need a friend  Let's put lotion on each other  Let's lotion each other up  I would let another man 
[01:25:00]  Whoa  Put lotion on my back  Yeah  When I'm dry and itchy  Hey, now  What's worse when you turn around your side  And your skin stretches a little bit  And it's like crackle, itch, crackle, itch  I never notice that stuff  I just go to bed  What?  Can you wear a new shirt when you first buy it without washing it?  Yeah  Bare chested?  Oh, yeah  I can't do that, man  Bare chested  How else do you wear a shirt?  T-shirt, I mean, under it  I like my chest hair to pop over the top of it, too  Are you talking about a button-down?  Yeah  I've, um  Yeah, I've worn brand new button-downs  I hate the black ones that make your skin feel like it's going  He's got some shit going on 
[01:25:30]  That's hilarious  No, it's the dye, I think  Some of the black or darker color dye  And it makes it feel like your skin's going  Buzzing  Yeah  But I gotta go cotton  Like, that shirt looks very uncomfortable  It looks very nice, Jimmy  Thank you  Don't get me wrong  Yay!  But it also looks very uncomfortable  No, I have a t-shirt under it  And I had the sleeves fixed  That would feel weird on me  Because short-arm  The short-arm-titted monster kid  Couldn't fucking wear it before  Because his sleeves would hang long  So I had to go to the tailor  The tailor  What's she doing? 
[01:26:00]  Who is this bitch?  She's still drunk  Is she?  Are you drunk?  Wasted  Are you?  No  You're still wasted?  Look at me  What happened?  I am plastered  You were out last night?  Woo!  Um, I, yeah  Can I use your phone to take the, uh  The audio of what I did yesterday?  Where were you yesterday?  Wait, what happened?  What did you do yesterday?  I blew it yesterday  I tried to plan a romantic, uh  Valentine's Day dinner  And I got this deal off of guilt  And, uh, I was really excited  That I had planned a romantic 
[01:26:30]  Valentine's Day dinner  With my, uh, fiancé  Fiancé  My fiancé  This is Nicole from the mashup  By the way, of course  And then I, uh  With very heavy eyelids  By the way  Holy shit  Holy fuck  I looked at the, uh  Voucher before we went  And, uh, realized  That it said a communal dinner  So I'm like  Okay, what is going on?  It was this communal bullshit  Then all of a sudden  I was reading it to Sam  And realized I had only gotten  One seat  For this  So I bought  Myself a seat 
[01:27:00]  But not my fiancé  So I called the place  And I was like  Dude, you gotta get me  Another ticket  For my fiancé  This is supposed to be  Our Valentine's Day  He goes  Ma'am, this  This is a singles dinner  Oh, shit  You really fucked up  Fucked up?  You have no idea  So, uh  We went  We went, uh  Met other people  And drank away the pain  Hence  Wait, where'd you go?  Uh, we just went to a restaurant  Near our house  And drank way too much  Did you have a nice dinner?  We did have a nice dinner  Did either of you get sick  From drinking? 
[01:27:30]  We didn't get sick  From drinking  We went home and banged  And he was, uh  Did you really?  Yeah  Nice  Where'd he put it  When he was finished, you know  Uh  Where'd it wind up?  I think it ended up inside me  All right  Yeah, there was no  Pulling out bullshit  You had a girl  Yeah  No, that shit  Inside?  I mean, I'm birth control  Oh, take a chance  Spin the wheel  What, do you go to Vegas  And not gamble?  You gotta gamble a little bit  Can I use this?  Play for funsies  Oh, you're still drunk  You're not hungover  You're drunk  Straight up wasted  What time did you get home? 
[01:28:00]  You were gonna feel like shit by  We went to sleep at like  9  2.30, 3 o'clock  But I mean, I was loaded  How are you still drunk then?  9 o'clock, you're gonna feel like real shit  Thanks  Thank you guys  No, I just  I've been there  And what time did you get up?  5  Okay  2 hours  2 hours  I'll be fine, dude  I'm a pro  Still a little zooted  Functional  I like that  Oh my gosh  She's fucked up  Cold from the morning mash  Look at her  How hot is that?  Fuck  You gotta blow loads inside 
[01:28:30]  I know, but it's cool to have her saying that  She asked her really dirty questions  Did that get you?  Well, get her back here  Fuck her show  Who cares?  Where's she gonna fucking intro an Adele song today?  Get her back here  We could get much better radio out of her  So she's very busy  Especially today  Doing what?  Oh, is she doing her show now or no?  She just ran off with Sam's phone  What happened to her phone?  Well  I recorded her conversation with her fiance on my phone  So why can't we hear that shit?  Because she's got my phone 
[01:29:00]  It wasn't  The conversation wasn't that good  It was like  It's probably morning mashup good  She pretty much described what it was  You know, what happened  The singles thing  It was a very funny situation  But then  What was she thinking?  She's a bimbo  She's a bimbo  Yeah, I would agree with that  Like she was  She thought it was funny  That she bought a communal dinner  And she started panicking  She bought this thing weeks ago  And she just yesterday  Realized that it said one seat  Did she get the  And I informed her that couples  A dinner for a couple 
[01:29:30]  Is never referred to as one seat  Wait, where was the singles?  I've never gone to a singles function  Some place in the village  With Owl in the name  Owl?  Oh, probably it's  Owl who?  It's the name of the club  Alright, listen  Roland's here  Get him in here  Red carpet is asked  He likes the name of that  Yes, I like that  Owl who?  Owl who?  And get Troy in here  Oh no, Travis is getting Roland  So why don't you explain  What's going on, Sam?  Okay  Well  Here comes Roland now 
[01:30:00]  We have new production  Roland and I  Roland and I improv'd it yesterday  Okay  I mean Roland improv'd it  But I didn't like  I was in there  Just kind of coaching him along  But I thought it would be better  If he was just improv'ing songs and stuff  Not anything written down  And then he started saying things  About a certain staff member  Oh boy  So I wanted copies of the outtakes  Praising that person?  No, negative things  Very negative, right?  Yeah, so I wanted copies of the outtakes 
[01:30:30]  And then I was informed yesterday  From Troy  That he was not going to be able  To give me the outtakes at all  Alright, let's go to Troy first  Troy, what happened?  Well, we  We were doing this production  And um  Roland just sort of had  Diarrhea of the mouth  So  So what?  In between takes  He's just fucking spewing some hate?  He did all the takes  And I just kept rolling  And then he just  Venom  And what was he?  He's kind of  Just saying some shit?  Yeah  I mean, he was just  Being Roland, you know?  Yeah  I mean, it wasn't 
[01:31:00]  It wasn't anything  Outside of Roland's character  Necessarily  I just don't think  He wants it  Aired publicly  And so  What were you saying?  What was he saying?  Roland, what were you saying?  This is good radio  No, but this is stuff  Like what?  Really?  Yeah  Oh man, really?  Yeah, if the mic was on  Yeah  No  Yeah, what kind of stuff?  Just singing stuff in song  Oh yeah?  Yeah  Did you know the mic was on all the time?  I thought it was off 
[01:31:30]  And you were spewing some hate, I hear  It wasn't hate  It wasn't stuff  Who was it about?  Could we say that at least?  I don't know  Oh man, he's uncomfortable  Why are you uncomfortable?  Yeah  Want to make good radio?  He was goofing  It wasn't  You could say it's a goof  Yeah, it was a goof for sure  I think I said it before though  Tons of times  Yeah, that's what I'm saying  Like he said it  So  In the song  So Sam's like  Holy shit, we gotta play this on the show  Cause it's a goof  So then you go to Troy 
[01:32:00]  And then what happened, Troy?  You refuse to give up the tapes  Yeah, I won't do it  Why?  I'm sorry  I'm sorry, I can't do it  Because I'll tell you why  Cause backroom deals are being made here  Backroom deals  Backroom deals  Yeah, you guys can't  I'm sorry, I can't do it  Why?  I can't  I'm sorry  I promised him  Yeah, cause I said  No, it's not just a promise  No, that's not what I heard  What was the deal that was made?  What's the deal?  What's the barter?  I said not only barbecue  Whatever you want  Cause I don't 
[01:32:30]  I don't scamp though  No, no  I don't scamp  I order the full meal  Whatever  I order extra food to waste  And find homeless people  And I love barbecue  So he offered you a barbecue dinner  Yes  And a nice barbecue joint  In New York City  And a therapeutic massage  Massage  And a  He's making a jerk-off motion  Troy, what was the deal that was made?  A steak and a handjob  Yeah, we're gonna go get handjobs  And then  We're gonna go have a steak dinner  You're getting  What amounts to jerk and turf 
[01:33:00]  What the fuck?  I mean  It's a fantastic place  Wait, he's  That's a great offer, isn't it?  He's getting you a handy  Yeah  And barbecue  Yeah  And we don't get the tapes  I'm sorry  Unless you can make  Unless you can make a better offer  Backroom deals  Backroom deals  What better offer could the show make?  Yeah  How about  And Roland has to give permission then  He would have to say  Cause I did promise him  So  Hey, anything he blurts into that microphone 
[01:33:30]  Is  Fair game  Fair  Fair game  It's fodder  Yeah  Who are you talking about?  Can you say that at least?  I'd let him know who it was  I was singing stuff and song  About who?  About things  Was it things or one person?  One person, perhaps?  I think it was two  Two people  Troy, was it two people?  I don't remember  It was definitely one  Alright, who's the definite one?  Can we at least say that?  I don't remember though 
[01:34:00]  Can Troy have to make sure to decide?  What the fuck is going on?  I have no idea  There's things going down around here  Yeah, cause we're gonna have our barbecue in Athena  Adventure  Adventure  Adventure  Do you have a handjob place there, Roland?  Yes, we do  Oh, you got your favorite little place?  We went before together  What is going on?  You haven't heard about this?  No  They told the whole story on the after show  I heard on the shit show  I didn't hear  I didn't hear  They have a bromance  And they have a special place 
[01:34:30]  That they go  We've gone once  But we'd like to go again  Yes  It's a lot of fun  Well, I didn't hear the story  What the hell  If it's worth talking  Well, we were here on a Friday  And it was a stressful week  A shit week  Yeah, it was a rough week  For the both of us  And we were just sort of talking  And it was like  Oh, you know  It's fun to get a massage  And get jerked off  He was offering you a massage  Troy  No, no, no, no  Going to an establishment  And so  He had said it 
[01:35:00]  It just sort of got my wheels turning  I'm like  Well, fuck it  Let's go  And we went  And got a massage  And got jerked off  And it was great  And I'm happy again  And  Like  What do you do after that?  I was  We were just making fun of people  On the street  We were happy  No, it was  It was pouring down rain  And we walked out in the rain  And we didn't give a fuck  We had fun  But you two  Got to kind of hang out  Going  Yeah, how was your hand job?  We did  We did  I mean, we walked out  Because you're in different rooms  So you come out  And I was like  High-fiving the girls  And  Oh, yeah 
[01:35:30]  His palms were like  Yeah  And then he yelled at me  Because I was going to tip cheaply  Yeah, I was like  Do not tip these girls cheap  How much did he want to tip?  Yeah, like ten bucks  Whatever  Ten bucks?  Yeah  For jerking them off  And how much did he give?  Forty  That's a generous tip, right?  I gave forty too  Because Troy goes  Why don't we come back?  I was like  That's a good point  Yeah  And they always go a little  You know  They're nice to you  When you come back  And you treat them right  You know?  And now you're going to go back  And get jerked off  Do they do anything else?  Do they give you any kind of  Real massage before the hand job?  Or are they just 
[01:36:00]  It's just the worst  I mean, it's the worst  It's not  It's just  It's just stupid  Like prelim shit  It's okay  And then how are the handies?  They're professionals  What kind of jobs are they?  Yeah  They're Asian  But the massage is the worst though  It wasn't bad  It was awful  It's not  It's not professional  By now  Roland said he woke up  He said the hand job was great  And as far as the massage go  He woke up and could barely walk  The next day  It took me like a half a day  To start moving again  My back was still  There's no way we're going to 
[01:36:30]  Bust this friendship up  To get the tapes  Oh man, no way  There's an alliance here  There's nothing I can do  But you know who he was talking about  So you don't give a fuck  No, I don't  I mean, I don't give  No  Well, then you should  At least tell us  Who Roland was trashing  If you want  And then the town department  For your Sunday show  So  See, he makes threats  Is the problem  Holy fuck  He's like a mafioso  He's got power  You're using sex  And fucking  Bribery  Extortion  You are evil  Using sex and food 
[01:37:00]  I take notes from the  The guys in the hall  Man  It's like got a syndicate going  We can't get  Got a crime syndicate  Because he's going to  Take you to barbecue  And you're going to go  Jerk off together again  No, we're going to be  Jerked off together  And not really together  It's in separate rooms  I hear you  It's a communal thing  It's separate  Yeah, that's not communal  That's the opposite  Communal would be  If you're in the same room  Looking at each other  Going, isn't this great?  Yeah  The showers are communal  But we didn't take showers  I did in the corner  You took a shower? 
[01:37:30]  No, no, no  I got a table bath  Because he ran first  He goes, dude, let's go  What the fuck's a table bath?  And then the girl goes  Why don't you wait?  And then another  What's a table bath?  They just lay on a table  And they do you up  They wash you?  They wash you down  It's creepy  Because the water's not quite warm enough  You're laying on this dirty table  That every other guy lays on  It's a rubber mat  I haven't put down towels  It's fucking awful  They just put soap on you  And throw water on you  Some chick with fucking dry fish breath 
[01:38:00]  Just rubs you  Not this place  You're going to the wrong place  What happened to the  I don't like Asian massage pros  What happened to the table wash?  Yeah, they wash you down  It's great  They get in your ass  Do they touch your bag?  Yeah, they touch your bag a little bit  Yeah  Not too much  But, you know, a little bit  Because that's the washing portion  Yeah  That's not the jerk  And then they dry you stand up  They dry you off  I feel like a million bucks  I want to go on  I've never been attracted to Asian women  See, I wanted to go to Russian  I feel like a million bucks  If you wanted to do Asian  Russian or Asian?  I'm not really attracted to Asian women 
[01:38:30]  We met in the middle  You like Asian girls, don't you?  I love Asian girls  Yeah  Hey, look at that  What's up, Tom?  Tom Papa  Just like a fucking detective  Man, you walked into  Holy shit  Quite the discussion  Something's going on  Holy mackerel  There's big time something  Troy, get back there  Hold on  Well, when last we left you  Roland and Troy  Have a pact going on  And Troy was recording Roland yesterday  For a bit  And Roland was going off 
[01:39:00]  About somebody that works here  On staff  On staff  And recorded some Venom  Now, Troy will not release those outtakes  Because Roland promised to take Troy  To get a steak and a handjob  At a Chinese fucking massage parlor  No, a barbecue  Well, a barbecue  Some of the best barbecue in Manhattan  Yeah  We were talking about rub  Yeah, rub or dinosaurs  Where were you from?  Oh, what a coincidence  Where do you go for barbecue?  Rub as a place?  Rub or dinosaurs  I can't believe barbecue came out of your mouth  2037?  No 
[01:39:30]  So they go to barbecue  And then they get handjobs together  Not the other way around  Oh, you get handjobs  And then you got to work up your ass  Yeah, you don't want to get jerked off  With fucking pulled pork in your stomach  Yeah, so now we're trying to get this tape  Because he's  I hear the tape's really good  Well, can't you guys offer him the same thing?  That's what we're trying to think of  Something that would be a little better  But they're kind of pals at this now  And they might be in cahoots together  This evil panda is just so  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
[01:40:00]  He is completely  He's not only like outwardly abusive  But he's also cunning  Oh, yeah  I was saying he's like his own crime syndicate  He's using prostitution and fucking extortion  Bribery  So always a little grin  Like  I'm not doing anything  Yeah  Everything's cool  Who is he trying to?  What is he going off on?  You hold all the donuts  Like so many nickels and dimes in your pocket  Who is he going off on?  Do we know that?  Was it someone on ONA staff? 
[01:40:30]  You look for your bookings?  I can't say  You've got to let us draw from the chocolate fountain  Holy shit, he's got Sam scared?  You never get scared  I'm not scared, but you know  I do a Sunday show  If I don't have the talent department  No talent  There's no one here on Sundays  Who have you gotten on Sunday?  Who have you booked on Sunday?  There's no one coming on a Sunday  I know, but we have recorders  So we pre-tape  And then we are on Sunday  Okay  He has more power than anyone in this room  I know  Troy, how bad was his tape?  I mean, it's  It wasn't that bad 
[01:41:00]  It's not that bad  But it's just information he doesn't want out  So he asked me to promise that  Oh, information  Well, it's truly a goof  Like it's the same  What do you mean information?  It's nothing that I haven't heard Roland say before  Oh, really?  It isn't  On the air?  I don't know  He's probably said it on the after show  Has some of this stuff been on the air?  Maybe other people have said it?  Or is this some new breaking news about these people or person?  I think he probably said it once on the after show  Yeah  So what's the big deal?  Is it an executive? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no  Uh-oh  Ah  No, I wouldn't do that  Because I know they came down on him when I was here  He was going off on an executive  Oh, yeah  Maybe that's  When they relegated you to the shit show phone call  When I was on the shit show  When I appeared on Sunday  For my airing of my special on Friday  Yes  Two days later  Oh, he suckers you into an interview  I was in L.A., Jimmy  And I'm like going through the calls  And I see O&A  I'm like, oh, that's great  You know 
[01:42:00]  And I was even like looking forward  Just to being hung up on  You know  Just calling in  And being like, yeah, you're special  And I was even looking forward to that  And I'm so confused with L.A.  I just got in  And I'm like, wait a minute  Just as they're like, okay, next we have O&A  And I'm like, wait  They're home by now  And you were right  I was right  What time was it?  9.30?  Yeah  Yeah, but that guy made George Lucas  So he's all happy again  Who did?  McDermott  What did he just say? 
[01:42:30]  I heard  That guy in there, George Lucas  He's happy now  The guy who set the phoner  The guy who set the phoner  I don't  He speaks another language  Wait, what guy set the phoner?  Oh, McDermott  Yeah, he made George Lucas on Friday  He wasn't here  He was up here  George was up here?  Yeah  But what did that have to do with setting up a phoner?  Did we know that?  No, I didn't  No  Why didn't we know that?  He just came by surprise  What time did he come?  Because Roland didn't tell you  Of course that's why he didn't know 
[01:43:00]  George Lucas wouldn't just stop by as a surprise  With handjobs and steak  He gave Lucas some baby back ribs  Yeah  What did he do, Cinemagic?  No, he ruined Indiana Jones  I know what he did  He upsets me  No, what show?  What show?  I know what show he did  He did some meeting  Obviously for the 3D thing  I think he did like a  They're giving him a show?  Star Wars channel or something  Oh, good  That would be great music  Star Wars channel  I know  He did something  He did Mark Says Hi  Mark Says Hi? 
[01:43:30]  Why does Mark Says Hi get to go to the Super Bowl  And interview George Lucas?  And he gets George Lucas?  And he's going to the NBA All-Star game  Miami?  I would have liked to go to Miami  That would be kind of cool  You mean we need to offer that either?  No, of course not  What's happening?  I don't know  Watch a good dude  So, we're not going to even find out who he was trashing?  I don't know  Sam, what can I do?  What's wrong with you?  Sam, just spill it  Come on  My hands are tied  How could they be that tied?  Can you at least say the person? 
[01:44:00]  Who's that powerful that you can't say it?  Roland is  No, he's getting the edge for 15 minutes for his show  I see, Roland's already offering me guests  What can I do?  He's using bribery  What can I do here?  He's extorting you  Troy, say it  Come on, I know you can  I can't say anything, I'm sorry  Why?  Because of some rub?  Well, times are tough, dude  I need a good meal and a hand job  He's going to have good rub  And then get some more good rub  Right  Wow  Put him in the back room 
[01:44:30]  With some barbecue sauce  Come on, Troy  I know you can do this  Roland is tough  What is the place?  Is the place like  What is it, in a strip store?  Oh, no  The hand job place?  Yeah  Oh, it's like a legitimate place  You walk in, it looks great  There's a waterfall  Is it like in a bunch of  Is it a strip of buildings?  Or is it like  It's a standalone?  No, it's not like a standalone building  But it's in a bigger building  In New York?  Yeah  It's a good area, too  Hold on, Nicole's outside the door  She is wasted 
[01:45:00]  Oh, Christ  Yeah, this girl's tanked  But Nicole, how did it work?  How did it go?  How did it go?  I'm going to tell it to  Oh, boy  I'm dying  Look how fucked up she is  Why are you torturing me?  I'm wasted  Tom, can you smell the alcohol in her breath?  Yes  Do I smell my booze?  Yeah  And the comb  You like pickle juice  Awesome  Awesome  Wait, are you a little bit buzzed?  Still?  How many drinks did you have last night?  Too many  What were you drinking?  What were you?  I probably had a few cocktails  And then we moved on to a few bottles of wine 
[01:45:30]  Oh, man  A few bottles of wine  I think I probably had  That wine is the worst thing if you do morning radio  I had to get sauced up before I took off my clothes  That was just  Oh, shit  You smell good, though  You don't smell  She doesn't smell gross drunk  She smells cute drunk  There's a difference  Cute drunk  Yeah, there is  There's a difference  Some breath is terrible drunk  Hers is not  Hers is cute drunk  You missed something there  Why did you have to get drunk to take your clothes off?  I just, um  I just  I wasn't feeling it  You know, like when it's Valentine's Day and it's forced  Or if it's like a birthday 
[01:46:00]  It's like a forced  Yeah, it's forced sex  So I wasn't feeling it yesterday  So I just  Oh, man  He stuck it right in your cuda, didn't he?  He did  Oh, shit  Was it just alcohol that you were drinking last night?  Or was there anything else?  What type of question?  I plead the fifth  What else were you drinking?  What else could you drink?  Look, she's  What else could she drink?  I'm a party girl  I got after it  I don't know  Oh, she's drinking  I don't know what she's doing  What is that?  She smells like pickles  Pickles?  Holy shit 
[01:46:30]  I didn't know she did that  Look at a jar of pickles  Wow, she is  I love it  She's trashed  Often  There is nothing worse than coming in here  Still fucking hammered from the night before  And then as time ticks on  The hangover creeps in on you  Like death  While you're awake still?  Yeah  Oh, it's terrible  All of a sudden you'll be just  Trying to, you know  Oh, yeah  And then you get this  Feeling of  I think I'm going to puke  This is fantastic  It's so good to be here 
[01:47:00]  Wow  Yeah, I was going through those phases  About a year ago  She's still drunk  She's still in the drunk stage  Yeah, she got home at three  Yeah  Yeah  So it's been five hours  She should have sobered up a little bit  Not if you didn't sleep  Yeah  Hey, Sam  Come on  What can I do?  You can give it up  Who's more important to you?  These guys or the panda?  The panda  Is somebody who's got a lot of influence  Somebody who I have to work for  Holy shit  How is this happening?  He's not 
[01:47:30]  He's saying this in front of you guys  You're losing all your cred  You're losing all your cred  He's not booking you any guests  You can't book yourself  That's right  He's booking  He's going to book you guests  To come in on fucking Sunday  Or to record something  They don't come in on Sunday  For the Sam Roberts fucking show  Exactly  Stop  Let's be real here  You had Tom Papa  Yeah  That was the after  Who was he talking about at least?  Roland, can I tell them?  You don't want the edge  Holy  You don't want what?  You're not getting the edge  I think he means the wrestler  Not the U2 guy  Oh  That's what I'm assuming  He means the razor 
[01:48:00]  You could call the edge  You have people at fucking WWE  Go to McDermott or Rory or whatever  They'll give you the edge  George Lucas  Go over his head  You don't need Roland  Roland's taking over this place  I can't believe he says  Right in front of you guys  That Roland's more important  I'm going to tell Roland  I'm going to go fuck himself  You don't understand  How Roland plays the game  Because Roland's like  A very lovable guy  Like a panda  And he gets everybody  To like him  So all of a sudden  You try to go over  Roland's head  But Roland's already  Gone to that guy  And said like 
[01:48:30]  Hey Sam's  Being a real fucking asshole  So you don't want to work  With him at all  That's not going to happen  First of all  They're going to go  Sam who  Come on man  Just give it up  Holy shit  I mean  What can I do  Roland  What's going on  He's a powerful guy  Nothing  Rules with an iron  Don't you want to give us  Good radio  What  You want to give us  Good radio  Give it up  Give us an initial  Give us one initial  Give us a hint  It's on an iron  Just a hint  He's in the building  Can I name four guys 
[01:49:00]  That it could be  If you wanted four last interviews  Oh man  You won't give me an inch  What the fucking threats  He's making  He's like a union boss  You built up a lot  Of credibility  You're losing all of it today  That's true  I mean  All of it  Yeah  Collapsed  In the toilet  You're a pussy  I didn't know  You know  I thought Sam Roberts  Had a little tough to him  You know  To work here  And do some shows  As many shows as you do  Was Roland bad mouthing  Opie and Anthony  No  Or little Jimmy Norton  He wasn't bad mouthing  Talent or executives  Can I say that 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  Okay  No talent  Oh a guest  That's why  It's a guest  Oh shit  No  Papa  No it's just  Staff member  No no  That's Papa  Staff member  Alright so it's not  Management  It's not on air  Jeez thanks  Thanks Roland  Let me see  You don't want to be  Dragged through the cage  By the evil panda  That's right  I was downstairs  She couldn't find my name  At first  I was like  Here we go again  Oh no  She can't spell downstairs  That's a problem  Why  Because she's  No because she's 
[01:50:00]  Just retarded  Oh  So uh  So it's a guest  Oh so it's like  A regular  Staff member  I think  Come on Sam  Give it up  What can I do  You understand the position  What for a guy  If it's a staff member  I can do that  Troy you can give it up  I know you can  My hands are tied dude  I'm sorry  It's not Troy  So it's not Troy  It's not Sam  It's none of us  We don't know if it's Sam  I don't think it's Sam  It's either Danny  Or Travis  Or E-Rock  I don't think it's the interns 
[01:50:30]  Because they would be  Comfortable saying that  It could be Kenny  Troy me and Roland  Were in the studio  At the time  Oh so you  You heard it too  Yeah I heard it  I know  So it's either Kenny  It's Kenny  Or E-Rock  Or Daniel  It's Kenny  Or E-Rock  Or E-Rock  Or uh  Or Travis  Or E-Rock  Or E-Rock  Or E-Rock  I think it might be E-Rock  Or E-Rock  Oh no  I'm feeling  I heard an oh no  I'm feeling an E-Rock 
[01:51:00]  I heard an oh no  I can't stop smiling  Oh shit  Is it  Is it E-Rock  Can I mention who it is  Hmm  He said yeah  He's whispering  What are you  It's the sex man  It's the sex man  Oh shit  You were fucking trash talking  The sex man  It's the sex man  Aren't you guys good friends  Off air  No  And he said  The stuff I haven't said before  I mean  Rolling in and  The stuff I haven't said  E-Rock  Comment  It's no surprise 
[01:51:30]  Ever since  You know  I got married  Got the house  Moved and all that stuff  We don't hang out as much anymore  And because Troy is single  Or whatever  Troy's status is  They hang out a lot more  So Roland has gravitated away  To hanging out with Troy  You replaced E-Rock with Troy  So there's a thing going on  Upgraded is the word you're looking for  Upgraded  Since E-Rock's one of the 1% now  With his mansion  But Troy  I would assume Troy  Wouldn't eat as much as E-Rock  And you guys 
[01:52:00]  Your relationship  Revolved around going to  A lot of these restaurants  In New York  Troy you're not going to be  Packing down food  Like E could  Oh no  I still enjoy  Hence probably the hand jobs  Yeah  Troy likes hand jobs  Like E-Rock likes dinner  That's true  He would suggest going for  Hand jobs with E-Rock  But E-Rock would be like  Wow we could just eat twice  He comes in his pants  From eating  Hand job is ladling food  In his mouth 
[01:52:30]  I'm sorry Eric  I don't mean this  Eric does this bother you  That you're being replaced  No it doesn't bother me  It's just the  The constant jabs  By Roland  Is a bit unnecessary  Like what  What jabs E-Rock  I haven't heard of these jabs  Bring us in  I can't think of anything specific  Jesus  They're constant  You can't think of one jab  Everyone can think of one jab  He can think of it  He's scared  How about  On the days  That I'm actually not here  When I come in the next morning  There just happens to be 
[01:53:00]  You know  French fries  Mashed into my keyboard  And on my computer screen  On my paperwork  On the CDs  That I haven't archived yet  Bullying  There's catch up everywhere  When his friend tries to mash it into your computer  They're more like punched into and under the keys  By the way  My defense though  I had a lot of sugar  And Sam encouraged  Does E-Rock have to get it out from in between the keyboard  Like an anteater  No  I do have greasy hands 
[01:53:30]  I put it all over his screen  You guys understand that's more than a jab  Yeah  That is  That's  That's  That's  That's wrecking his work area  Which he will commit incompetence in anyway  You also didn't hear E-Rock say there was ketchup everywhere  Yeah  Because you know  Like at the fast food places  They give you those little paper barrels of ketchup  Oh yeah  Yeah  How about  If E-Rock sits behind you  Just winging them behind you  And seeing where they land  Oh my god  And E-Rock just takes it 
[01:54:00]  Yeah  There are some shenanigans going on  E-Rock takes a lot of shit  He wasn't here that day  Not as much as he used to  I had  That was the day I had  An extra-logged Mr. Pibb  An extra-logged Frosty  And he was dipping his french fries and everything  Oh yeah  That's  I was  I was like  Wired  Beyond  And then Sam  Encourages my wiring  And he gave me another Coke  And I was just  I was going crazy  He's like a  He literally is a panda in a cage  Just going berserk 
[01:54:30]  Unbelievable  So you were obviously  Trashing E-Rock  In between these  Production pieces  You guys were working on  Right?  Especially in the balls  How come you don't want anyone to hear it  If you  You've said horrible things about him  To his face  No he does it to fit in  With whatever group he's hanging out with  Ooh  Ooh  Rolling  Ooh  That's right  Well that's right  That's right  Oh man 
[01:55:00]  He's Pebbles Flintstone  So now we know  Who he was trashing  Now it's just a matter of time  Before we get the audio  I'm thinking  Yeah I'm thinking too  What's it going to take Troy?  What's it going to take?  What do you need from us?  Roland needs to say that it's okay  Because I made a promise to him  And  And I just want to make sure that I  We can't overrule that promise  In some way  Hey let me tell you something Troy  You don't know the power you wield  You could do  You could tell Roland to go fuck himself  Because Roland doesn't want to go eat  And get a handy alone 
[01:55:30]  You're his guy  You're his wingman  So he's going to want you to go anyway  I'll go with you  Nah  He's going to want you  It's not going to be hard to replace someone  To buy dinner for  And get them jerked off  It's not really a labor of love  To go with Roland for  These two are a pair  What's this integrity bullshit?  You can't overrule a fucking promise?  How about this  We'll buy you barbecue  And Kenny will jerk you off  I'll come in my hand  Like a bird eating  So I would 
[01:56:00]  I personally would love to hear these recordings  And I honestly think the audience  Would like to hear these recordings  And they deserve to  And they do deserve to  Now that they've heard about them  You know the cat's out of the bag  It's just a matter of time  How much audio do you have Troy?  It's just a couple minutes  That comes out of your bag  Get it?  Come on  Come on  Looking at Jimmy  Come on  I'm not turning to the right  It's up to Roland man  I can't do it  Sorry  Roland can we  Can we hear these? 
[01:56:30]  We're still at this point  Don't you want to make the show better?  Not really  I didn't want to go barbecue  I was going to think about  You know the hand job  What?  What?  Sure  If you want to give yourself  Your own hand job  No  No 
[01:57:00]  He fucking strikes  Pulls his stupid winter coat  Through the fucking  Yeah  Can I just talk to you  In my office for a minute?  We have a little problem  Just sit right there  You want french fry?  Roar  Hey you want  You want  You want to see something real cool?  You get evil  Everybody here knows  How fucking evil Roland can get 
[01:57:30]  Oh he's so fucking evil  He runs his place  He really does run with us  Yeah  He does  He looms you  And he's real sweet  And then  If you do one thing wrong  He will motherfuck you  And never forget it  There's no forgiveness  He will never let it go  No you guys want to see George Lucas  He doesn't like how he handled  Star Wars 3D  You don't get George Lucas  Right  It's as simple as that  Jimmy's got a whole bunch of stuff  He wants signed  No  Roland doesn't want it  Wait it wasn't about  The Star Wars though right  With George Lucas  You hate him why  Indian Jones 
[01:58:00]  The Crystal Skull  Indian Jones  Crystal Skull  Crystal Skull  Crystal Skull  So we all have to suffer  Because of that  No  No no no  I knew he was going to come up here  I just saw him in the lobby  Crystal Skull  He never knows  He kind of abused  How he was supposed to  Shut up  Crystal Skull  Alright we're going to get these tapes  Right  Troy  Can't do it dude  Can't do it dude  Come on we know who it's about  It's got to be  It can't be  Who are you protecting 
[01:58:30]  I thought we were the bosses  That's what I thought  I thought everyone was working  Toward a common goal  Which is  To make this show more entertaining  Right  And make this show better  Yeah stupid me  I thought we were the bosses  Exactly  I was so wrong  I'm so confused  Of the hierarchy around here  What are you fucking Nixon  Troy just casually goes  Can't do it dude  Release the tapes  I can't allow that  I'm just not going to 
[01:59:00]  Let you do that  Negotiate  Let me ask this  Here's a question  That needs to be asked  Roland  Yes  Let's say we get the tapes  Yes  Without your permission  What happens then  To these people  They'll see  See that's worse  See that's worse  Than saying what it would be  Yeah  What if we get the  Recordings ourselves  We know how to run  Pro Tools  We break into the  We break into the office  And take them  Yeah we break into the office  Whoa look out  We're breaking into  The boss's office 
[01:59:30]  And we're going to be  Stealing tickets  You'll have to get through  The french fry firewall  Yeah  And also  Don't forget  The ketchup gauntlet  That's really  Quite exciting  To run through  Holy shit  And E-Rock  E-Rock's an office cuckold  An office cuck  Let's them mash food  Into his computer screen  It just takes it  E-Rock is eventually  Going to be let out  Of this place in cuffs  Oh yeah  With a fucking  With a gun 
[02:00:00]  Which was confiscated  By the police  Yeah  That's still smoking  Yeah  E-Rock why do you take it  Because he does it  When I'm not here  And the only reason  I found out was him  But what do you do  When you get  Get into work the next day  The next day  I started screaming  I blamed the Ron and Fez staff  Because they come in  And use my computer sometimes  Because they're allowed  So I'm freaking out  And I go  Fuck it  I'm going to security  I don't know who  And Roland's panicking  And then finally  He runs over  He goes  Don't go to security  It was me  It was me  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Who cleans out  Who cleans out the french fries  Roland  I did 
[02:00:30]  Oh  I dug it down  Yeah  I would never get that  Computer again  With his tongue  He's looking at you  You might have said  Something a little  I'm only kidding Roland  Yeah  He gave you a look  It's just for the  He gave you a look  Great  Sam you're a fucking pussy  That's what I learned today  I told you  I gave you the name  No no  We kind of went there  Well you've got to understand  Who has power around here  You guys are at the door  At ten o'clock in the morning  And I'm going to book

[02:02:00]  You guys used to be  Really good friends  It has to be deeper  Than just jokes  Because he's being that protective  It's something  Is it bad Sam  I mean it's  Iraq will be annoyed  But it's nothing  That he hasn't heard already  Yeah Roland  It's the type of shit  That Roland talks in the office  All day long  So why won't you  Let us have us  So why then  What's the big deal  If it's not  Groundbreaking shit  Yeah why  Because I'm just  Tired today  I just want to  Have to deal with nothing  Well you're a little sleepy

Yes  Or this month? 
[02:20:30]  No this weekend  Wow  They really picked a fucking dud of an event  Didn't they?  We're gonna give you half off all chicken finger baskets  This weekend for the Jim Norton show  That doesn't have a lot  I go around and look at the fucking headshots on the wall there  And so many of them are big stars now  And so many of them  Like you know you have Rosie from 1984  But then you go around and see people like  What the fuck happened?  Yeah  To Skip Davis  Yeah  Or just a guy with like a really awful mustache  You can see the beginnings of his sports coat  And he's just gone 
[02:21:00]  And there's a yellowing around the picture  And you know like there was a Saturday night  Where he walked off that stage like  Man I am  I killed it  I called his wife  And you know what?  We are  We should move to LA  This is all happening for us  I got my picture hung up right out there  How many of those guys killed themselves?  Fuck  Yeah  There's gotta be a few that just  Not enough  Absolutely  I don't know what happened to them  It's scary isn't it?  What happens?  That would be a good documentary  I've thought of that  Where you go to the comedy  Because I've seen them in the comedy store 
[02:21:30]  Because they have those two walls completely covered  Yeah  And you just go in there and go  Okay we all know Robin Williams  David Letterman  Eddie Murphy  But what happened to that guy?  Exactly  A guy in a vest with his hand under his chin  Oh god  You would do it  That would be a documentary  You know  Go ahead  You know a comedian named Woogie?  Do you remember Woogie?  No  Asian guy used to close  I just found out he died of a heart attack  I worked with him once  Years and years ago  In the Marriott in Connecticut  In Stanford 
[02:22:00]  Wow  And I saw his headshot  When I was in PA recently  And they're like  Yeah he died  Wow  I hadn't thought of him in 10 years  I asked a guy  Like what happens to all these guys  Because it's the same thing  You freak out  As a comic  You're looking at this wall  And you're like  This is going to be me  Am I living a lie?  Am I going to end up like that guy?  Yeah  Am I so delusional?  But 9 times out of 10  There's a story  It's either  That guy  When they go down the list  It's like  That guy  Cocaine  That guy  Was an alcoholic  That guy 
[02:22:30]  Left his wife  Screwing around  Just pointing at one picture  Real happy  It's a woman  With a mullet  Oh sorry  I ran into one of those guys  At the Comedy Magic Club  In LA  And it was when I was first out there  And he sat down  And he just kept asking me  So where are you living?  I'm like  Oh I'm living over there  In Studio City  In a house?  You in an apartment?  Well I'm renting right now  So you think 
[02:23:00]  You might move into a house?  And I'm like  What is this?  What is he doing?  And then he whips out  A real estate card  Oh  Oh  And had like a wacky saying  Over it  And he was like  Done with comedy  But he was still  The funny guy  The funniest realtor  Around  Exactly  Did you know him?  Yeah  Have you done a gig  With him or something?  Yeah  A lot of people knew him  He was on TV  He was  Whoa  This is in LA or New York?  Did you write the name down?  In LA  Is that his name or no?  You let me write it down  Oh boy 
[02:23:30]  Bill Kirkenbauer  He's in?  No  Because he's doing real estate too  Oh really?  He's doing radio  Every house he shows  Just has brick walls  Yeah  He stands there  With a mic in the spotlight  And tells me about the toilets  Yes  Remember  If you move into this house  To keep your  Talking to a minimum  And your laughter  To a maximum  Let's go  And you're ready  To see our bedrooms  Come on  Bedrooms everyone  Let's see  Turn your cell phones off  Right before we walk  Into the master bath 
[02:24:00]  Oh it's scary  Those people's dream  Was as valid as mine  Frightening yeah  I know  They might not have done  The leg work  But their fucking desire  Was as real as mine man  Now do you think  That you are beyond that happening  Or could it still happen to you?  Both  I mean I think  I'm beyond  Being able just to be  Completely anonymous  Unless I do something  Really terrible  Right  But ten years from now  If I just stop  I mean I have enough  Trouble drawing right now  I've been feeling  Completely irrelevant  So I don't think 
[02:24:30]  It would be very hard  At all  Right  But I think  With things being online now  It's a little harder  To totally die away  Right  Because there's no footage  Of these guys  Yeah  At all  But now you can go online  And people who like you  Can push you  You know  Right  Keep you going a little bit  But I think  I'm still at a point  Where I can absolutely  Yeah  Go no further  Than I am right now  I feel like that  Every morning  Yeah  Every single morning  I am awful  It could happen  Anytime  I could just slide off  The face of the earth here 
[02:25:00]  And no one would notice  No one will care  I did a fucking  A piece on Leno Monday  For the Grammys  It was a good piece  It was right before  Jennifer Lopez  It was a big audience  Doesn't matter  It's not a reflection on Leno  It's a reflection on me  Nobody gives a fuck  No it's a reflection on Leno too  I mean all those shows  Are irrelevant now  There's just so many of them  The talk shows don't do  What they used to  But if you still have  Five million people  Seeing you  And it's not  You're not just  Selling out the club  Part of it is  That a lot of the younger  Demo doesn't watch talk shows  That's part of it  But part of it is 
[02:25:30]  They don't  I'm not doing anything  That is making them  Interested in coming to see me  Because five million people  Is five million people  That's a lot of fucking people  He doesn't get five million people  Yeah he does  No  Yeah tonight's show  There's between four  And five million people  No  Without a doubt  Roll and say what  Three to four  On some nights  But on a night like  Fucking Jennifer Lopez  He'll do five million people  J-Lo night would be  Maybe five  Yeah  Yeah I mean  It's not like years ago  Where it was like  Seventeen or twenty million people  I don't know about that Jimmy  I don't know about that  I think it's more like  One to two million  No  No no no no  Yeah 
[02:26:00]  On Leno he's  The tonight show  Is beating Letterman  And Letterman  Is more than one million people  Absolutely  I don't think  Five million is like  A lot for their like  Sitcoms in prime time  No  Sitcom in prime time  A lot is like  Thirteen million  Twelve million  That's a hit  But like the regular  The regular sitcoms  Doing like a  Like a two  One  What was the marriage ref doing?  It was like  That was doing like  That was doing like  Four or five million  And that was like 
[02:26:30]  That rating was  That's like a two five  And Letterman and Leno  Always get like a one  Like a one one  One two  Those are  Those are a lot less  A lot smaller numbers  But isn't it rated  It's  The scale is different  Three million  Tonight's show  Increased in total  Viewer margin  To three point seven  Three point seven million  Three point seven million  That's the average  Last week  That's last week  Okay so 
[02:27:00]  Yeah so  It's not you Jimmy  These shows are becoming  Irrelevant  They're not what they were  As far as  Three million people  Because too many people  Are splitting the pie  But okay so say  Three point seven  Say four million people  I'm not trying to jack the number  Say four million  She's a big guest  Spread around the country  Um  Yeah  Dissolved in  Forty million people  Spread out  Older  All right  Now you're depressing us  No  All right  But it's still 
[02:27:30]  We have an audience  Spread extremely thin  It's still a lot of people  Around America  Adults 18 to 49  Yeah  Uh  The Tonight Show  A zero point nine rating  And the  And Letterman  A zero point eight  These  These ratings are nothing anymore  They're nothing  A zero point nine  Almost a million  It's  It's almost a million  I mean it's  These shows  Don't  Nobody sees them  I'm telling you  It's all spread out  When Adult Swim  And The Daily Show  And all these other things  Are equal in the  In 18 to 49  As The Tonight Show 
[02:28:00]  They  There's no way  That that's going to  Translate into people  Coming to The Punchline  Or Gotham  This weekend  But when  No but when you say  When  You are exposed  In front of that many  People  You should start to see it  As a cumulative thing  Not necessarily  Like hey  I did one  Uh  When I did the second night  I did on the Jay Leno show  There was over 11 million people  Saw it  Like the ratings were massive  For the second night  It didn't matter  Like even that  Didn't push me at all 
[02:28:30]  So it's not about  Like after all these ties  You do X amount of appearances  Right  That adds up to a lot of  Fucking people  And when they still  Don't come out  It's not like they  Hey this was the one night  Or whatever  You realize  They just don't give a fuck  They're seeing it  They know you're there  Right  They don't give a fuck  But they're also  You have to think about  Does Leno's audience  Today  Translate into  Comedy fans  Some yeah  Some  I would say  That they're not  Not maybe like it was 
[02:29:00]  A few years ago  But more than I'm seeing  It's not just  Like ah  They don't go  They don't  They don't come out  At all  Of course  They do  I hear when I go out  And perform around the country  More people come up  And say they heard me  On this show  Than say they saw me  On Tonight Show  Or Letterman  Even if it's that week  I think radio is like that  But I also think radio people  Are more likely  Because radio fans  Are different than  Any TV fans  They're hardcore  They want you to know  They're a part of this show  It's a different mentality 
[02:29:30]  The only show  Where they'll come up  And tell me they've seen me  I mean I'll get  Tonight Show people  I'll also get  Chelsea Lately people  I'll get red-eyed people  Those are comedy fans  But not as much as radio  For anything  Radio is more than anything  For anything  But look  I love The Tonight Show  They're good to me over there  But they're not like  Comedy fans that go  And buy tickets  And then go out  Of that million  Of that two million  I'll give you  Three million people  That are watching it  A lot of them are just  You know  Middle housewives 
[02:30:00]  Middle America stuff  They're not buying  Hard tickets to come  See us do stand-up  If you go on  Comedy Central  If you go on VH1  And do like  An I Love the 90s  You're gonna get  More comedy fans  It's really just  The venue  Nah  I would like  To believe that  Believe me  I would love  To believe that  So I could kind of  I would exonerate myself  And maybe that's partially true  Because times have changed  But the reality is  That enough people  See me in that  Enough people  Are exposed to me  There over the course  Of doing 30 of them  Well who's been on Leno 
[02:30:30]  That it has worked for  Exactly  Because Tom's saying  It hasn't worked for him either  So who's the guy  That goes on Leno  As a comedian  And his numbers  Are increasing drastically  Because of that  Because the old days  Like we all know  To be honest  You became an overnight  Fucking star  When you went on Carson  Right  Leno  Early days of Letterman  As well  Yep  I don't watch  You did one appearance  And next thing you know  You're selling out everywhere  Yeah  I don't know to be honest  But I don't watch the shows  I don't know who's on it  I literally  I don't watch what I'm on 
[02:31:00]  I'll tell you  I don't know who's on  I'll tell you what happens  The only people who get traction  Is if you sit down with him  Not even do stand up anymore  But if you sit down with him  And you get off some funny jokes  And then it's retweeted  It's replayed on the internet  If Huffington Post gets it  Right  And people start spreading it on YouTube  That's when it becomes relevant  Like Louis  Louis had a couple jokes  On there that went viral  The airplane one  Yeah  That was on Conan  That was an amazing  A bit he did on Conan  Yeah but he also had a couple on  Leno 2 
[02:31:30]  Leno 2  Yeah  Those videos are doing  Millions of views  If people get it  And it goes viral  Then it's relevant  If not forget it  Alright  More importantly  We got the audio  We do?  Oh yeah  Oh  And we got Roland  The deal was made  Before the break  Do we have to explain  The whole fucking thing  For people that are  Just tuning in  New listeners  Basically Roland was doing  Some production  In between his lines  Or whatever  He was trashing  E-Rock badly  And then he made  A secret deal  With Troy  The production guy 
[02:32:00]  To make sure  These tapes were never heard  And the deal was  Barbecue and a hand job  Barbecue and rub  A rub and a rub  Rub and a rem  Rub square  But then we made  Our own deal  With Roland  We attacked  Where he has a weakness  Yes  He wants guests  On this program  That's his goal  And we say no  A lot  Yes  A lot  So now  He gets to book  One guest  And we get to hear 
[02:32:30]  The tapes finally  Yeah  Yes  You got your name  Yeah  Oh shit  He's got the name  We have  The recording  It's right here  It's right there  This is  Wow  This is like  A hostage  Deep rope  Yeah yeah  This is big  This is big  He's got a few names  In front of him  Who are the  A few names  Because you can only  Pick one  Robert  Kelly  This is the  Bruce questions  Not yet  You can't say  Bruce questions  Because now we're  Teasing and now  We have to have  Contest rules 
[02:33:00]  Oh  Take that back  Yeah  We might have  Steve questions  You can't have it yet  Give me the fucking case  Not sure you accept  This thing  That's the rule  Jesus Christ  Roland  Yes  Who are you booking  On the show  Even if all of us  Say no  Shannon Tatum  Who's that  Who the fuck is that  A massive  He's a huge huge star  Well maybe you said it wrong  It's a he  Channing Tatum  Channing Tatum  You said Shannon  He said Shannon  Shannon Tatum  Tatum O'Neill  Tatum O'Neill  Tatum O'Neill is going to be 
[02:33:30]  What's he do  He's an actor  With Shannon  He's in one movie right now  Tatum O'Neill  Tatum  Tater Tots  What's he  Reminds me of Tater Tots  He's in The Vow  J-Jo  Did you hear Shadden  Upcoming  Tater  I just went  Jump Street  Tatum  What's the picture  Tatum Tots  Tater Tots  Is he the guy  In The Vow  Yes  The main guy  Yeah  And he hosted FNL  We'll take him in  And we said no to him  Well you guys were like  Ah  So  That  You probably would have been able 
[02:34:00]  You probably would have been able  To talk  It's on your deal  Because just so people know  A little inside shit  Sometimes we say no  And then we're able to  Then we're talked into it  Yeah  That one we probably would have been  Talked into  I know but  You fucking blew your pick  I'm thinking  No but I just wanted to make sure  Is it yes  Because  He's coming in  And what is he promoting  Not The Vow  21 Jump Street  Yeah but we would  We would promote the guys  From 21 Jump Street  I know but  That's going to be a big movie  I know but I wanted to be safe  I say he blew his pick 
[02:34:30]  I'm on record  You blew your pick  Okay  Here's the audio  Sam did tell me  Track 2  Why  Well track 1  Is just outtakes  Of him being stupid  Yeah I want to hear  The outtakes  For the record  Sam said during break  After we set this up  For an hour  He goes you guys  Are going to be severely  Disappointed  After all that  Oh great  I'm like oh great  I go alright  We'll make something out of this  I just think you can work harder

[02:38:00]  I'm still wrong  Oh  Oh  LOL  Eric  LOL  Give me those outtakes  If you want  Our cars  Oh  I'm playing your damn after show  You rat  Yeah I'll play those tomorrow  That's it  We wasted an hour?  That's that  Are you serious?  Oh my god  Are you fucking serious?  Now what are you guys  Could have told me  That it wasn't worth  Even talking about?  What are you holding back? 
[02:38:30]  Now I'm mad at Troy  They're holding tape back  Who talked to this up?  Oh you're holding tape back?  Fuck no dude  That's it  I swear to god  So why couldn't you tell us  It was no big deal?  Because he  I have the text message here  I'll show you  He said to me  Do not give those out  I'm going to give you  A handjob and  Barbecue  Yeah  Delete the outtakes  But couldn't you at least  Tell us  This isn't worth talking about?  He would be like  Well then forget the handjob  Because when you do radio  You need a payoff  Yeah  Not just listening to him  Say pussy  Like a  Like a molester  That's the worst 
[02:39:00]  Pussy  Pussy  Pussy  Eric are you bothered by that?  At all?  This is the most  Anticlimactic thing  We've ever done  And it is the best  Fucking segment ever  Two hours of your time wasted  Yeah  It was wasted  But we said  You need a payoff  After this nonsense  Yeah  Like I said  I met a friend of Dr. Ruth  And she said  I have the problem  Because we met Dr. Ruth  Last week  What is happening? 
[02:39:30]  He's devouring the show  From the inside out  He's eating his way out  He is  He's eating his way out  Everyone's saying boo  We're fucked  There was nothing there  We're fucked  Boo  He's treating the show  Like a bag of french fries  And just devouring it  Smashing him to the keyboard  What did he just say  About Dr. Ruth?  Said let him say it  We should take her  Dr. Ruth  What did you say?  Oh uh  That's actually  We met her last week  He's sweating like crazy  His whole lip is covered in sweat 
[02:40:00]  Why are you sweating?  I don't know  Because he knows  He's just killing his show  Why didn't you want  That audio out there?  Who cares?  I don't know  I just didn't want  That one  Pussy  I don't know  I didn't say it was great  You guys  Great?  It wasn't even  It was just shady  We would have taken mediocre  Right?  It's not even near  Irrelevant  Calm down  I didn't say it was great shit  Pussy  And Eric 
[02:40:30]  You're loving this  Why?  Because this is total shit  Oh it means nothing  And we made a deal  But I mean  We would have probably  Taken that guy anyway  I didn't know  He was in 21 Jump Street  Yeah  Everyone was talking  About that movie  The only one who made out  Good on this  Was Roland  Because you said yes  To his guest  Yeah but we were  Going to take him  No and the  Oh yeah  Troy did take it  Troy did take it  Barbecue and a handjob  From the Panda  He's the only winner  A big furry handjob 
[02:41:00]  Who are the winners  And who are the losers  I think Tom  Can you go down the list  We're all  We are  I'm a loser  We're all losers  Jimmy's a loser  Ant's a loser  I'm a loser  He's a winner  Because it shows  He didn't have anything on him  Sam is somehow a winner  Because  No he looks like a pussy  To his whole thing  He looks like a pussy  But he gets Roland  Giving him irrelevant guests  For his Sunday show  He should have gave up  The name Iraq  Immediately  Yeah very true  Troy is the real winner  Because he gets the  Furry panda job 
[02:41:30]  Yep  You two are really  The ultimate losers  Because he's  Not only is he  Taking control of the show  From behind the scenes  He's also now on air  Taking the show down  Yeah  I think he has like  A master plan  Like he's  He's going to take over  Like this is going to be  His show sometime  Oh we'll talk this up  Make it sound really interesting  I won't say who it is  Or what I said  Fast forward  Fast forward two years  He's in Mel Carmisen's office  Oh yeah  Just running this joint  From upstairs  I won't say no 
[02:42:00]  To any guests  Right  Send my secretaries  Up here  You can see me  Cut coffee  What  What  What  Holy fuck  I've got to turn off  The answer of feedback  We're getting killed  No  No Mel  I didn't put french fries  On your keyboard  That wasn't me  No  No more horseplay  It's not going to be  Like the old days  When the guys used to  Say shit about you  I'm not going to say anything  Anyone caught with  Getting little things  To catch up  Is 
[02:42:30]  Terminated  You know what  You nailed the impression  You nailed it  Because Roan will say  A lot of gibberish  But the one word  That you do understand  Says it all  Yes  Kill you  Welcome to the  Salmon Panda show  It's a mumble  Until that one word  It's all together man  Fuck  God  That was awful 
[02:43:00]  It really was  A man  Cream waste of time  Oh  The urgency  When I first walked in  Of what was going to be  Going down  I was like  Oh this is going to be good  They're going to get the tapes  No way  They're going to get the tapes  They got the tapes  Oh we're going to play  We're playing the tapes  Pussy  Yeah  I blame Sam  You're an on air guy  I blame you  You knew that  It was going to be shitty  You knew it  You had to know  That was going to be shitty  Yes  What did I tell you  Before you played it  You were in the studio  I told you  After we already made the deal 
[02:43:30]  As he's pressing play  What wasn't shitty  Was the fact that  Roland was promising people  Handjobs to not play tapes  Good point  Fair enough there  When the tape happened  But this is what you do  You let that part of the story  Get on the air  And then go  Oh this is not even worth  Talking about  Right  He baited you  And then we could have  Fucked Roland over  Baited everybody  I wouldn't have  Fucked Roland over  He's my boy  You know  I want a clean keyboard  Yeah  Yeah  That's all he wants  In his career  I don't want to sit  And catch up 
[02:44:00]  He does take revenge  You gotta watch him  Alright  I was just gonna do it  As a throwaway  On the after show  I wouldn't have even  Given you the tape  If Roland hadn't  Made a big deal  About it with Troy  That was the first thing  You said to us this morning  After show  As a throwaway  Because then  Exactly  Because then  Once he made the deal  With Troy  I was like  Well now this is a story  True  This is something  I gotta share  Certainly was a story  Oh well  Wow  Wow  If only we could have  Stretched at another hour  I got some 
[02:44:30]  We're gonna go back  To break  Because we're in long  Oh my god  Oh no no no  Should we do  Yeah  Can we do it  After the break  Yeah  Oh  Alright we got  Two pairs of tickets  To a big show  Wow  Who is it  Kajagoogo at this point  Kajagoogo  Might as well  Let everybody down  Every aspect of this show  Why would they  Trust us to this point  We got Gloria Estefan tickets  Yeah  Fantastic  Yeah  The rhythm's gonna  Getcha  The rhythm is gonna  Getcha  This weekend 
[02:45:00]  She's terrible  Oh yeah  Pussy  Terrible  Yeah  Pussy  Pussy  Pussy  I used to like  The song  Conga  It's the only song  I ever liked  The rest of it's terrible  I can see you  Singing that in your car  Oh yeah  Here we are  Fucking boo  Fucking boo  Yeah  Timmy  Timmy  You can't control  Yourself  Any longer  Uh huh  Yeah 
[02:45:30]  Jimmy driving down  The L.I.E.  Yeah  Pretending I'm in Miami  Talking to girls  While fucking  Angels upstairs  Having his arm  Cut off  With a chainsaw  You didn't run out  Of the studio  To get a photo  With her  I didn't forget  Oh yeah  Yeah  Sure  We should punish Sam  Take the shit show  Away from him today  Yeah  Yes  We should be punished  We should be a punishment  You should be punished  You need to take control  I think in the end  We blame you Sam  You can blame me 
[02:46:00]  If you want  You should have gave up  B-Rock immediately  But  Then you would have  Had to fill for two hours  Well alright  No  You know what  Let's not go to a show  We can do a show  Exactly  When we feel like it  We can do a show  Oh  We don't need amazing  Tapes like this  Hey  You're looking  To poopy  You're looking  It's a duty  Wow  Unbelievable  Holy shit  That's like the Watergate tapes  It's crazy  Oh god 
[02:46:30]  Let's ask Roland  If he wants to do  The shit hour today  Roland  You want to do the shit hour  No  Fuck  No  You should make them  Why are we going to see E-Rock  You can punish Roland  What about E-Rock  I think Sam needs to be punished  I'll do it  But I think the real punishment  Is Roland hosting the show  Because he can't do it  Yeah  Yeah  I mean that's a punishment  For both of us  Roland's not guilty of this  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  He's the one who  You knew  Roland knew he didn't say shit  But Roland was smart 
[02:47:00]  Because he was getting  Guess out of it  He was getting things  He was negotiating  That's why he should  Host a show  He initially  He's been protecting the show  That's right  He's a real puppet master  I hope he got it  I don't know  Henry Winkler  The Fonz was in recently  And the boys put a little  Remix together  With his PSAs  Remember the PSAs  The kid touching PSAs  So Troy did this  Nobody is supposed to  Touch your private parts  Don't touch me like that  Don't touch me like that

Can't understand him either.  I can't.  Amen. 
[02:52:00]  Thunderbird.  Well, I took his own time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One, two, three, four.  Can I get an amen?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Philadelphia's a good song.  Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sort of funeral-ish.  Yeah.  It's good.  Yeah.  Slow.  You've got to mention girl names, too. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  It's just little things he does at every show.  Windy.  Windy.  It doesn't mean more than Windy.  Rosie.  Jersey.  Got to talk about Jersey.  Sandy.  Sandy.  Growing up in Jersey, I never knew that I was-  Right.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Jersey girl.  Then we went down to Asbury Park and saw the-  El Cuckoo Jersey girl. 
[02:53:00]  The minister of rock and roll.  Yeah.  Brother Van Damme Federici.  That's what he does.  What did he do?  He goes, like, the minister of rock and roll.  And then he goes, Brother Van Damme Federici.  The brother, the minister of the bass line.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Tom Pomp has gone to a few shows.  Who are you kidding?  Have you seen him?  Oh, yeah.  I've seen him.  I've seen him once.  That's it.  And that's what you picked up on. 
[02:53:30]  How was he?  Isn't this exactly what we weren't supposed to be doing?  He's great.  Wow.  He's electrified the room.  We love Bruce Springsteen.  Yes.  I actually want to go.  Yeah, we gave our word.  I want to go.  We gave our word.  We went trash it.  I want to go.  This is fun.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't got to sell me on the fact that this is fun.  Are you going to it yet?  Yes, definitely.  Maybe we can get more pictures.  Yeah.  Yay.  Jim pictures.  There's pictures in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Clock.  Yeah.  I refuse to go.  I'm not going to go with the crowd, man. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  You're a rebel.  I'm not getting an iPhone.  I'm not getting Fios.  And I'm not going to the Bruce Springsteen show.  A rebel.  It just drives people nuts.  I interviewed little Steven on my radio show.  So did we.  I guess the coolest.  I saw him the other night.  We chatted.  You know how it is.  Wow, man.  I saw him on the red carpet.  I thought I was going to be cooler than you guys.  Now, Lily Hammer I hear is pretty good.  It is pretty good.  I heard it's good.  It's like the Sopranos in winter.  Oh. 
[02:54:30]  It's really.  It's got that vibe.  Yeah.  He's the same guy.  So here's the big, over the top, big intro to the Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway.  They're going to fucking let you go, right, Roland?  I hope so.  Oh, boy.  Holy fuck.  What is it going to take?  Well, I get a plus one.  And I don't know if I'm bringing a girl or not.  Hubba hubba.  Hubba.  Oh.  What if he promises you a barbecue and a handy?  Bring it.  Jersey girl. 
[02:55:00]  Roland.  Roland wouldn't be good for me to go with because he wouldn't help me take pictures.  He'd be too busy looking at Bruce.  I understand that.  You need someone that's going to be good with the camera.  I need a cameraman.  I'll be a cameraman up to the minnows he hops on stage.  The minnows?  The minnows he hops on stage.  The minnows.  What?  What?  The minnows he hops on stage.  The minnows.  I will be satisfying myself in the...  The company realizes that they have to let you go.  Yeah.  Are you in love with Bruce Springsteen?  No, I love his music. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  I'm not...  Yeah.  But we ask him why and he doesn't even have a good answer.  It's hard to put into works.  He's gone to over 200 shows.  Why do you like Bruce Springsteen?  What does his music do for you?  Yes.  I just love his music.  I mean...  What's your favorite song?  Incident on 57th Street.  Incident on 57th Street.  Incident on 57th Street.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  What album is that off of?  The Wild, the Innocent, and the East Street Shuffle.  Did you love that we worked on 57th Street for a while?  Yeah.  Did you feel wild and innocent?  There were many incidents.  Did you feel like, holy fuck, I'm actually working on 57th Street now? 
[02:56:00]  What's the incident on 57th Street?  If we had somebody who would find some music, perhaps we could hear it?  And is it the 57th Street we used to work on?  Yeah.  No, it's not really because of that.  I didn't think about that.  I did a radio show once where if you brought up like a song, they'd play it a little bit.  You would like...  What's that like?  It's really cool.  Maybe like a producer.  I was trying to find non-live versions.  Okay.  Fair enough. 
[02:56:30]  He was like, I heard you.  This show just is horrible.  This is Roland's favorite.  I know how this goes.  Everything was fine up to 56th Street.  Yeah.  This is old, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The second album.  It sounds different.  What's the song about?  About Johnny trying to find his girl. 
[02:57:00]  The band of 57th Street.  What happened?  She blown someone?  Is she at the Starbucks?  She put french fries on his keyboard.  What was the incident?  There's probably like some unsexy incident.  Yeah.  Like she tripped getting off walking off the curb and shit into her shoes.  She was drunk.  What was the incident?  This isn't a spoiler.  This isn't a spoiler.  This isn't a spoiler.  But what was the actual incident that happened on 57th Street?  This is your favorite Bruce Springsteen song. 
[02:57:30]  Things happen.  You don't know.  He doesn't know.  They go to the bus stop.  You don't know.  You don't know what the incident is.  What's the incident?  It's called the incident on 57th Street.  What's the incident?  He didn't realize after the man.  He thought Sedent was a place.  I was there when I was in.  I was there when I was in.  It's a wonderful tapas restaurant.  You ever go to Sedent?  You don't know what the incident is?  You have to know.  Yeah, but Bruce tried to make a left turn at a light before 10 o'clock a.m. 
[02:58:00]  And you got a ticket.  Very tragic.  I don't listen to the words, man.  Can I get a Roland in the house?  Roland's an anomaly, man.  Do you know the lyrics?  Yeah.  Roland pictures dancing in the dark and pictures Bruce going,  Hey, baby!  And putting his arm down and Roland gets up and dances.  Trust me, me jumping up on the stage.  If Bruce pointed at you, you would be on that stage. 
[02:58:30]  Yes, of course.  He high-fived me once during the concert,  and I screamed and teared up like a woman.  You did?  And you teared up?  I did, I did.  He high-fived you?  I was in front row, he high-fived.  Yeah.  And I turned around.  And all my friends bashed the shit out of me.  They should.  Do you think you'd tear up if you got a picture with him?  If you got to talk to him?  I don't know.  He's sweaty after the show.  Would you be nervous?  Puts his arm around you. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  I freeze up.  Really?  Oh, 100%.  Are you jealous that I met him on an elevator and got to talk to him?  You did?  Yeah.  Did you talk about Roland?  No, it was just me, Bruce, Kenny, and Bruce's guy.  Really?  We took a picture, he was really cool.  Wow.  Eric's got a story, too.  Really?  I don't know why you say it.  You rock?  Well, Roland teared up when Bruce was up here,  and he wasn't allowed to get a photo,  and Bruce walked right by saying,  anybody else?  And Roland couldn't do anything.  Papa, did you know the story?  Anybody else?  No.  And they wouldn't let you take one? 
[02:59:30]  This drives me nuts to this day.  What is it?  The company has a lot of pull, obviously.  Yeah.  They get Bruce Springsteen in the fishbowl for a special little thing.  What?  20 people, maybe?  Wow.  25?  25 people.  Bruce wants to take pictures with whoever the fuck you don't care.  He seems like a nice dude.  Yeah.  And Roland, who is probably the number one Bruce Springsteen fan in America.  Right.  I mean, I would challenge anyone.  He's right up there.  Wasn't allowed to get a picture and was told so.  Wasn't allowed to?  No. 
[03:00:00]  By who?  Management.  Were you afraid you were going to bite him?  Yeah.  And like Bruce said, like anyone else.  And you would think someone would have stepped up and said,  all right, Roland, it seems like it's cool.  Go get your picture.  Oh, my God.  Or let's make believe, Roland, you're one of the listeners.  Something.  You just, you didn't just not go up.  You were told not to go up?  I got this.  No.  Yeah, they waved him off.  Someone waved you off?  Oh, my God.  Like that?  Who?  Oh, boy.  Who was it?  Who?  Oh, really? 
[03:00:30]  Who?  Oh, really?  Fucking asshole.  You're an asshole.  Not anyone in the room.  I didn't see the initials.  What a fucking dick.  Christ, I almost made a whole show.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just a dick.  That name comes up a lot.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, I can understand if, you know, every celebrity you're trying to get pictures with,  but this is obviously a special moment.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like it.  Oh. 
[03:01:00]  And the funny thing is, Roland wouldn't ask anyone else around here for a picture.  Yeah.  That would be it for him.  Yeah.  I like people who want pictures.  I help people take pictures, but I just don't care.  You never take them, right.  So now we're at the, now, so that's an old story.  Now we got Bruce playing where?  The Apollo.  The Apollo, man.  The Apollo.  Amazing.  Small band show.  Wow.  And you would think the company would go, look, man, let's get rolling in.  This is really important.  Let's take care of an employee.  They have it in for you.  I was told they said, don't worry about it, but.  Maybe they will then.  Maybe they'll do the right thing.  All right. 
[03:01:30]  You know, all right.  They said, don't worry.  Then I got to shut my fucking mouth.  What's the date?  Maybe they're going to do the right thing.  What's the date?  March 9th.  I was supposed to be in Toledo, but because I canceled Toledo because I'm shooting in Cleveland  the April 28th.  Oh, really?  What are you shooting?  It's an hour.  Oh.  And I wanted nothing in there.  I'm now going to be home for that.  I didn't cancel for the Springsteen show, but I'm going to be here, so I have to go.  Why don't you take Roland?  This is his first, this is like his main opening of the first leg of the tour.  How long do you think he'll play?  The whole band?  About ten and a half, three hours.  Full band, full brass section. 
[03:02:00]  Wow.  It's like what you saw in the Grammys.  That's what's going to be in the panel.  Wow.  I was actually out to dinner when he was on at the Grammys.  I didn't get to hear it.  It's full brass, full vinyl ends.  It's a whole big section.  What song did he do?  Vinyl ends.  We take care of our own.  Do you like that?  I love it.  Live, it's amazing.  We take care of our own.  We take care of our own.  Not this place.  This song isn't about here.  Plus, it's Apollo.  He's like the soul man.  This place is every man for themselves.  That's right.  I don't even have an ID yet. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  Dan, you do a lot of shit for this place at this point, right?  Yes.  Holy fuck.  Roland, if you went to the Apollo show with Bruce Springsteen, you could die the next  day.  No problem, right?  Yeah, but I don't want to do the one in Houston, but I could live at least a few more days.  I'll be happy.  A few more days just so you could get Twitter and Google and really enjoy it for a few days.  Did you ever have an incident with a celebrity that makes the management think that you can't  handle yourself?  No, never.  Never.  Dude, he works with celebrities.  I know.  And you just got to understand what's important to your employees sometimes. 
[03:03:00]  Sometimes it's not the money.  Sometimes it's a little fucking gesture like this.  Yeah.  That's a little.  Yeah, that's a big deal.  All right, with that said, here's the big intro to the Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway.  Is everybody live out there?  It's time to win Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Bruce Springsteen tickets.  It's time to win Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Dial now.  To fucking die.  Sorry.  I get jealous. 
[03:03:30]  You got trivia questions for these guys?  I do have a trivia question.  All right, what line you want?  Because it's got to be random.  One through ten.  I'll let Tom pick this one.  One through ten, Tom.  Just pick a number.  Eight.  Hey.  Y8.  I don't know.  Sean in Jersey.

Oh.  1980s movie. 
[03:04:00]  Bruce's sister.  Have a bit part in.  Bit part in.  Hmm.  Um.  Oh.  Um.  Young Guns.  I was going to say,  um,  risky business.  Oh, no!  What a lot of people don't get their tickets!  Bye bye!  Wait!  Now you got to change the question.  It was a movie with Tony Katane?  What movie was it?  You got to change it because they can Google. 
[03:04:30]  What movie was it?  You got to change it because they can Google.  It's Fast Times and Richard Bond High.  Oh, who was she?  Oh, fuck.  Really?  She was in the clothing store, right?  Yeah, with Sean Penn.  I think Diana was her character.  It was like really quick.  Okay.  Next caller.  That's a good one, Roland.  Next caller.  Because of Google, we can only go with one person for time.  Tom?  One through ten, not eight, though.  Four.  Four.  The number is four.  Four. 
[03:05:00]  Why do you hate my picks?  I just wanted you to pick my favorite number.  Nine is nine.  Your favorite number?  I'm not saying that.  Oh.  Lonnie, North Carolina.  Hey, guys.  You got a chance to win these tickets?  Yeah, man.  I'm on vacation that week.  I'd love to be able to come up.  All right.  We'll try to get this one.  My wife's never been in New York, so it'd be a surprise for her, too.  The Roland, I need an easy question.  Sure.  Springsteen made his first on-screen appearance in a brief cameo as himself.  In what film? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, Lord.  I guess your wife's not going to New York.  You know, I've listened to a lot of radio over the years.  I've never heard a giveaway like this.  Yeah, a giveaway where it's just not even nice.  Hey, Roland, this is like my dream thing, you know, to come to New York, to bring my wife.  Well, guess a movie.  You're talking to a man whose all his dreams have been shattered.  He doesn't care about your dreams. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, me.  Aim your dreams less.  You got the movie?  Can you tell me what, was it, 80s, 90s?  Sure.  No.  Easier for him to look up that way.  Are we done with Lonnie?  Lonnie, we need an answer, or I got to hang up on you.  Um, I don't know.  I'd say the same movie again.  Fast Times of Rich, my heart.  Wow.  No.  We're looking for High Fidelity, starring John Cusack.  Oh.  That was a Jack Black movie. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  High Fidelity.  I like Jack Black in that movie.  Jack Black.  High Fidelity.  I like that one.  Yeah.  All right, Tom, it's to you.  Tom Papa, Gotham Comedy Club this Friday and Saturday.  Yes, thank you very much.  You can't pick four or eight.  Oh, jeez.  I'm going to have to go with nine.  Nine.  Ah!  Fuck.  I think Rob's a regular to the show.  Nobody.  Rob in New York.  Hi.  Hey.  You want to win these tickets?  Sure.  All right.  Bruce Springsteen wrote his classic single, Hungry Heart, originally for what band? 
[03:07:00]  Southside, Johnny?  Wow.  You are wrong.  Oh.  Oh, that was my guess.  Oh.  My dumb brain.  I know who he wrote it for.  I actually know the answer to that one.  Yes.  Manfred Mann.  Nope.  Bill Tetley and the Schooners.  The Schooners?  It's a Jersey Shore band.  Bill Tetley and the Schooners?  Oh, what a lounge act that sounds like. 
[03:07:30]  The answer is The Ramones.  Oh.  They wouldn't have sung that song.  Yeah, they would.  Hey, everybody got a hungry heart.  Hearts are hungry.  Hungry heart.  But John Landau talked him out of it.  Who?  John Landau.  He's the manager.  Talked him out of it.  Oh, Landau.  I thought you said John Lennon.  No.  I really did.  Oh, I just have one more question.  I have to.  Well, you better get some more questions.  You better think of some more.  All right.  Tom Papa.  You can't pick four, nine, or eight, was it?  Yeah.  Go, three.  One.  Whose favorite number is one? 
[03:08:00]  Jeff in Baltimore.  How's the chance at the tickets?  Jeff, good luck.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Jeff.  Hey.  Bruce Springsteen won an Oscar for Best Original Song.  What is the name of the song?  Um, let's see.  That song was, oh, God.  Streets of Philadelphia.  Correct.  Winner!  Oh!  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[03:08:30]  What happened to our pomp and circumstance?  It's on your replays.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  All right.  Good for you, my friend.  Yeah, you want tickets, you'll be joining some of us at the Apollo.  Yes.  Nice for the Bruce Springsteen show.  That's going to be an amazing show.  But not all the cool kids.  Never saw him before.  I am totally pumped.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  I haven't seen him either.  And, um, I probably wouldn't have went out of my way to go, but because of the Apollo,  it's a small show, you gotta go.  Is it going to be weird for you, like, seeing him up on stage now that you're friends with 
[03:09:00]  him?  No, I mean, he might nod at me.  Hold on.  Let's see little Stevie will nod at me.  Hey, how you doing?  I saw him do the Nebraska thing.  Oh, yeah.  The depressing tour.  Yeah.  He didn't play anything else.  Yeah.  Fuck.  All right, so we have one more pair.  You got another question?  I have to find some.  You're an Uber Springsteen fan.  You can't come up with a...  I know, you have a bag of shite.  You have to double-check the answers on that. 
[03:09:30]  You have to double-check.  You have to double-check.  You have to bag a shite, Roland.  All right, Papa.  What the incident is.  Pick a number.  The number is five.  Five.  God.  George and Jersey.  I'm horrible at this game.  Five.  These questions suck.  I have no chance.  Well, let's go.  Jeez.  Well, Roland's working on it.  Roland?  He's working on some Bruce Springsteen trivia.  Okay.  I stopped listening to Howard Stern for you guys. 
[03:10:00]  I switched over completely.  That should give me some credit.  Okay, cool.  Man.  When Howard plays the Apollo, make sure to get your tickets.  Let's see.  Okay.  In 1975, Bruce appeared in simultaneously on the cover of two magazines.  What are the names of the magazines?  Oh, please.  It's a famous.  I know the one.  Honcho.  Rolling Stone's definitely right.  Black Inches. 
[03:10:30]  Rolling Stone's wrong?  Well, you can't guess the guy's going to guess.  Ebony.  Rolling Stone and Time Magazine.  Give me the answer up.  No.  It's a Newsweek anti-magazine.  Yeah, play.  How is it not Rolling Stone?  Why would they have?  When did you do the bandana thing?  I know it was Time and Newsweek, by the way.  What year was that?  80, 81, 82?  Yeah.  Yeah, this was 75.  75.  Wow.  You've been famous for a long time.  Sorry, George.  Rolling Stone.  All right.  I want Time and Newsweek.  Why am I not on Rolling Stone? 
[03:11:00]  Play infection.  I don't do a good Bruce.  God, there's people that know all the answers out there.  Rolling Stone.  Come on, Rolling Stone.  I'm trying to.  We got one more pair of tickets.  Bruce Springsteen, Apollo.  Sound off like you got a pair.  Sound off one, two.  All right.  I think I have one.  I have to double check if this is wrong.  Rolling Stone.  Is that one?  I mean, he won.  See how many he won? 
[03:11:30]  Holy fuck.  All right.  I mean.  All right.  What number there, Tom?  The new number is seven.  Finally.  Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Hey, buddy.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi.  Hello.  How many Grammys has Springsteen won?  One.  What was it? 
[03:12:00]  One.  One, he said.  21.  Why aren't you making fun of these people anymore?  You were off by 20, sir.  You're off?  Yeah.  It's struggling for you.  Come on.  You couldn't give me an easy one time in Newsweek.  Every time a fan knows that.  All right.  Well, you lost this one.  You were off by 20.  You're not a good fan.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Good point, Jimmy.  How many Grammys has Sabbath won?  Come on.  I think zero.  I think Ozzy's won one.  He won for I Don't Want to Change the World.  But I don't know if he's ever won anymore.  We can look that up out of curiosity. 
[03:12:30]  Okay.  All right.  Sorry.  Curiosity killed the cat.  All right.  So did me fucking it too deep?  Oh!  You got two, three, six, and ten left, Tom.  I'm going to have to go with two.  Two.  All right.  Roland?  You can't get questions off the top of your head?  No.  You have to double check to make sure.  It's a boy.  It's a whole rules and lawyers and I get in trouble, they say.  Trouble.  These people.  These people. 
[03:13:00]  People are always getting him in trouble.  We don't know these people.  I don't know who they are either.  We don't know their names.  They're out there.  Yeah.  They're just phantoms.  I guarantee you there's Polaroids of them all over his apartment.  Oh, fuck.  You got one, Roland?  Yeah.  Hold on.  I got to get the guy.  It's Dale in Jersey.  A lot of Jersey calls today.  Dale.  Yeah.  All right.  Good luck.  All right.  What is the name of Bruce Springsteen's piano and keyboardist in the band? 
[03:13:30]  Bill Tatley.  Fucking moron.  No.  Chip Chipperson.  Is it Jerry Shepard?  Is it, wait, no, no.  I actually do know this one.  Don't wait.  We have a Pepe Sinclair.  Pepe Sinclair.  Pepe Sinclair.  Professor Roy Binton.  All right.  We got three and ten left, Tom. 
[03:14:00]  Ten.  Ten is Kevin from Connecticut.  Whoa.  He's away from Connecticut.  There's an arrow.  Lovey.  Lovey.  I've gotten through.  From Connecticut.  Lovey.  Super fan.  Wow.  Hey, Kev.  I'd love to win this.  All right.  What is the name of Bruce Springsteen's bass guitarist in the band? 
[03:14:30]  His what, Roland?  His bass guitar.  Bass guitarist?  Yeah.  The guy who plays bass in the East Street Band.  Guitarist.  It sounds like he's Googling.  He's Googling.  Oh, come on.  Quickly, sir.  Cheating.  Cheating.  Well, Bruce does play bass on some of them.  No, he doesn't.  No, he does not.  Yes, he does on some of them.  He plays rhythm, right?  Look at his bass guitarist in the band.  Where are you guitarists?  I don't know. 
[03:15:00]  It's Gary Talent.  All right.  If this guy doesn't get it, we'll just keep the tickets for tomorrow.  Yeah.  Because he went through all of them.  Big ticket here.  Yeah, we can't just give it away.  All right, the last one is Phil in Jersey, number three.  Phil, good luck to you, buddy.  Come on, Phil.  We want to give you these tickets.  We really do.  We really do.  Phil.  Come on.  What is the name of Bruce Drum Percussionist in the band? 
[03:15:30]  In the East Street Band.  Drum Percussionist.  Well, the drummer in the East Street Band.  Come on, I was the last caller.  Give me the ticket.  If you don't know that, give me the ticket.  This one's the easiest one.  It's the easiest question you could ask.  What's the question?  Who's the drummer in the East Street Band?  How could you not know that?  He's on other shows.  The current drummer in the East Street Band.  People have to be screaming right now.  I don't even listen to him.  Yeah, you can't.  Exactly.  If you don't know the answer, Phil, you can't.  Sir, quickly, do you know the answer or no? 
[03:16:00]  Come on.  Yeah, I do.  Three, two, one.  Who is it?  Go.  I'm that climber.  No.  No, he looked it up.  It doesn't matter.  We said go, and he got it.  I'm in my car.  I'm in New Brunswick.  Come on.  He does sound mobile.  He did say it.  He said it.  He said it.  We have to give him tickets.  He is correct.  He's the mighty next one.  You're absolutely going to go, but I need to know.  Did you just cheat?  No, I swear to God.  I'm driving on George Street, New Brunswick.  So if you lie, you can't. 
[03:16:30]  Big shit.  Does that mean you can't cheat?  On George Street, you don't.  Nobody Googles on George Street.  I know.  There's no internet on George Street.  Google doesn't read that.  It's well known.  You're not allowed to Google on that.  It's kind of an honor thing.  It's preposterous to think anybody could have some type of device that can access the internet.  But not on that street, Ed.  Not on George Street.  Not on George Street.  Yeah.  Never.  We won't be Googling on George Street.  No Google on George Street.  Phil in Jersey, you're going to join us for the big Bruce Springsteen show at the Apollo Theater March 9th. 
[03:17:00]  And congratulations.  A winner.  A winner.  A winner.  All right.  I'll get a bunch more tomorrow.  Yeah.  We'll have another pair tomorrow.  Well, maybe not.  I don't know.  I'll get a bunch more questions.  All right.  Hold on.  Phil, line three has won the tickets.  Tom Papa, Gotham Comedy Club.  Friday and Saturday.  Next to Rub.  And Tom Papa on Twitter.  And my new album's out on iTunes if you want it.  Tom Papa live in New York City. 
[03:17:30]  Nice.  When was that released?  This week?  No, it just came out this month.  All right.  Good.  Jimmy's going to be leaving us tomorrow for the punchline in Atlanta.  No.  No.  Hot Atlanta.  I will be here tomorrow.  Atlanta.  You sure are funny for a Yankee.  And...  You all right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, I will be here.  You going to stick around for the Sunday show?  Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday. 
[03:18:00]  I'm sorry.  No Sunday.  You're not going to do the Sunday show?  You know what?  Everybody got their own day.  Sunday is the day of the Lord.  You should do the day of rest?  I don't like to work on the Lord's Day.  If the Lord don't work, I don't work.  So I fly casual.  I fly casual?  I fly casual on Sunday, and I'm going to come home and relax and praise his name.  Well, you best have a good show.  It's going to be a third-year anniversary down there.  And then punchline in the game.  I'm going to watch that good old boy, Jimmy Norton, and get me a mint julep over here while 
[03:18:30]  I relax and watch him under this here mimosa tree.  Lord, it's hot today.  That Jim Norton done gave me a case of the vapors last night.  I felt a bit faint.  Ooh, we got a comedian from New York City.  From the north.  From the north.  He's going to be telling his Yankee jokes. 
[03:19:00]  I do believe we will be going to that show.  Well, I do declare.  I keep the language.  Quite the funny lad over there.  Above board, too.  I know nobody wants to come and hear a filthy talk.  Keep the language all above board.  Wow.  We got to keep the language proper.  Come in.  Is that how you all talk up there in New York City?  We don't take a liking to that down here. 
[03:19:30]  I want all of us to do this voice for as long as we can.  What made you think I was stopping in a time sooner?  I'm only saying I haven't heard other people.  Ah, well.  You might have heard.  Hoping.  I don't know.  Sam.  You might have heard.  Well, all of us are down here in Atlanta.  Why ain't you talking like this?  Why are you going to be gone today?  Gone.  Yeah.  Roland.  Will slap my balls? 
[03:20:00]  She's going to walk on.  It's fun.  How about you, Sam?  You know, you look like a half a...  Go home now.  What was you...  What does your mama look like?  What are you going to say?  Go ahead now.  Say something.  Come on now, Sam.  Talk to her.  How do I fall asleep in my balls?  I don't know.  What?  Stop trying to pretend you're too hip for a bit now. 
[03:20:30]  Talk to her.  Talk to her.  Motherfucker.  Daddy, you got hair like Kizzy.  Talk to us.  We have ways of making people talk around.  My great-grandpappy knew your great-grandpappy during the Civil War.  Mm-hmm.  They wasn't friends, I'll tell you that.  No.  Mm-mm-mm.  I just don't have much to say.  Just say your grandpappy was under my great-grandpappy's tutelage.  They had a business arrangement. 
[03:21:00]  A little arrangement down there.  And how about, how about little sweetie up down there, both doing nothing all day, putting  his big, fat feet up?  Mm-hmm.  I think he's shooing there, honey.  Give him some time.  Are they shooing him like a fat horse?  He's in a tross right now.  Mm-mm-mm.  Yeah, he's over there eating hay.  He's gonna get down.  Go ahead now. 
[03:21:30]  E-Rock, you got anything to say?  I reckon we're fixing to get on out of here.  Oh, great.  Thanks for fucking up the bed.  Oh, man.  People always wreck the bed.  Thanks for nothing.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, girls, you're dirty, home, don't go easy all alone 
[03:22:00]  There's a bit of design, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire  Tell me how it's been, it's good to you  I'm doing these tough things I like  Can we get you higher, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire 
[03:22:30]  Sometimes it's like summer and life  It's interesting, you know, the road, too  I'm doing these tough things, you know, the road, too  I'm on fire  There's a bit of design, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire  Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire 
[03:23:00]  Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[03:23:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Now, hear them do their own thing.  Every weekend, we turn the channel over to friends of the show  with featured episodes of their podcast and broadcasts. 
[03:24:00]  This week, Bob Kelly's You Know What Dude.  This weekend on the You Know What Dude podcast,  Bailey J., that gorgeous shemale,  with Jimmy Norton and Joe DeRosa, the shemale lovers.  Friends of the Show, throughout the weekend,  starting Saturday at 11 a.m. Eastern,  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I can't believe we had to go all the way down 
[03:24:30]  to asking who Bruce Springsteen's drummer was.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  One.  What'd you say?  I thought we were only going to do one pair.  People didn't know anything about Bruce.  People want Bruce tickets.  I know.  They don't know anything about him.  The guy goes, it's my wife's dream.  Giving away tickets to his big show, The Apollo,  that he's doing for SiriusXM.  It's going to be amazing.  How come Nicole didn't walk by here?  She's probably passed out.  Yeah.  I would like to send one of our Infinity interns around  to see if Nicole from the morning mashup is anywhere around, 
[03:25:00]  because she was on the show for a little bit today.  But I would love to find out what's happening.  So, somebody, go find her.  Roland, you were the big star today.  I don't feel it.  No, no, no.  You don't feel it?  No, I think you and Troy.  Well, yeah, of course Troy was too.  But, um, so, first of all, the Springsteen tickets,  you haven't confirmed whether or not this is happening for you.  They told me, don't worry, I guess. 
[03:25:30]  Uh-huh.  Um, is Nicole still here?  Do you know?  Sal doesn't know, but he's going to find out.  Um, I have faith in it.  What's happening?  I don't think.  What are you laughing at?  I don't know.  Is somebody finding out?  No, it's nothing.  It's just I was laughing.  He said, get the fuck out.  That's all.  Oh.  Who's finding out if Nicole's here?  Sal!  I'm sorry.  I was checking the, what everybody did.  Do you want me to go find out? 
[03:26:00]  I was checking what everybody did.  Are you high right now?  No.  What were you checking about what everybody did?  The other interns, how they cleaned up.  Oh, we got time for that.  It's good.  It's good.  Yeah, go find out where Nicole is.  Or send that guy to do it or something.  Okay.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's just.  Oh, yeah, and bring Troy.  You really want Troy in here.  Troy's welcome to come in whenever he wants.  So, listen.  Um.  I guess the Max Weinberg question, even you had to realize, was just a giveaway.  I can't believe that guy even had trouble with it. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, because I know you probably Googled it, but it was like I had to double check the answers because I didn't want to do a question.  Yeah.  They had like three different answers.  So, I figured if you're a diehard fan, you'll know the band.  Max Weinberg.  Because Bruce screams the band.  But you don't even have to be a diehard fan.  I watch Conan.  That's how I know.  Yeah.  I never listened to Bruce Springsteen.  And then Bruce interests the band every night.  Like, the mighty Max Weinberg.  The Tennessee tight end Gary W. Talon.  So, you. 
[03:27:00]  But you don't pay attention to any of the lyrics in the songs?  Yeah.  I do.  I'm not going to like going, yeah, man.  Wait, wait.  Listen to this line, man.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know the lyrics?  I do in my head, but if someone goes, do it, I'm like.  But you don't know what the songs are about.  Like, you don't, your favorite song is 50s, Incident on 50s.  The guy and the girl in the band, he's after a breakup, and they fall back in love.  Boom.  There you go.  Go.  So, how come you couldn't say that?  I don't know. 
[03:27:30]  My brain shuts down.  It's like meh.  So, that's what happens.  You have more information than you're letting out.  All I see is Tom Papa's eyes look at me going, panda, panda.  He did make an astute observation that you are like a ferocious little panda.  And that's all in my head, like, what's the incident about?  And all I hear is, panda, panda.  You get stressed so easily.  I do.  Troy, did you realize today what a letdown this whole thing was going to be when you were in the middle of it?  I don't really remember exactly what Roland said, because when we did it yesterday, I sort of forgot. 
[03:28:00]  But Roland made it very clear, like, do not let that audio out.  So, I was like, well, maybe he really did say something horrible.  Yeah, I thought, like, to me, the whole story was the fact that he didn't want the audio out.  Right.  I was honestly, because I remember you can hear it.  We'll play the clip again in a second.  But you can hear, I was just going to play it on the after show.  I wasn't even going to tell ONA about it.  I thought it was just a throwaway.  And then, you know, we'd rile up Eric a little bit.  But then when Roland flipped out and said he would buy you a handjob and a steak. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  As Anthony so educationally put it, jerk and turf.  That's not a miracle.  Then it was like, Jesus, there's something going on here.  Roland, how come you didn't want that audio getting out so much?  I mean, I was like, ah, I felt bad.  Like, Eric shouldn't etch him by his balls.  Because it was for no reason.  So, I felt like a dick.  So, I was like, ah, I didn't want to go out.  Even though it wasn't that bad, but it's still like, ah.  Jim in Scranton wants to talk to you.  What's up, Jim?  Guys, there were thousands of Bruce Springsteen fans 15 minutes ago screaming at their radios 
[03:29:00]  when Roland asked for the members of the band.  You guys can't find bigger fans to give those tickets to?  Yeah, the guy didn't even know the bassist.  It's horrendous.  If you've been to one Springsteen show, you would have known any of those answers.  Yeah, because it's a timid introduction that he does.  Yes.  If he does his preacher, he goes, and the mighty, mighty Max Weinberg.  And then he goes, this is Susie Tyrell. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing, though.  It's just like our, because we're doing it randomly.  So, it's just whoever happens to dial the phone the quickest in that minute that we're  giving it away gets to do it.  It's like getting Ticketmaster.  Oh, and if I won those tickets, that would have took you, man.  Oh, thank you.  That's the next question.  Tomorrow.  Thanks a lot, Jim.  Tomorrow, or whenever we give them away again.  I don't know if we're going to do it tomorrow, because we didn't do it yesterday.  But whenever you give away those tickets again, question number one, will you take me as  a plus one?  And then the right answer would be, yes. 
[03:30:00]  And that person wins the tickets.  That's a good trivia question, I feel like.  No, but I have faith, though, that management will come through.  I do, too, Roland.  I do, too.  So, Eric, were you upset by Roland's comments?  Not really, no.  Roland says you're angry at him.  Well, look, it's the hype built up to be nothing.  Well, let's listen to it without hype.  This is Roland.  Yesterday, he was doing a production piece, and we were just kind of improv-ing. 
[03:30:30]  And I did have sugar again.  Trying to figure out what he was going to do.  It was for the Bruce Springsteen giveaways that we did today.  We wanted a little something of Roland.  He's always better when he improvs.  So, this is what he ended up saying into the microphone that we hyped up for about two  hours today.  Two hours.  Did you hear about Eric?  No.  What?  Sad, man.  What?  Doesn't like pussy.  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  You're kidding?  No.  When did you find that out?  What?  When did you find that out?  He told me.  Eric did?  Yes.  When?  Today.  He doesn't like?  Pussy.  What does he like?  Sandwiches.  He doesn't have sex?  I don't think so.  See, by itself, it's funny.  Without two hours of buildup, how come you really didn't want that leaking?  I said it for no reason.  I feel like a dick.  So, I'm like, I just don't want to get out. 
[03:31:30]  When you heard it back right before we aired it, did you realize that it was nothing?  Yeah, still, though.  I just didn't want to, like, eh, he doesn't deserve this.  I was being a dick.  So, I was like, eh.  Were you surprised, Troy, that Roland so badly didn't want something as dumb as that?  Yeah.  Well, like I said, I forgot exactly what he had said.  Yeah.  So, yeah, in our minds, we were probably thinking, like, oh, shit, if he doesn't want  that out there, like, he may have said something really bad.  Yeah.  Roland just says bad stuff all the time, so it's just kind of like, oh, was it in this room  or that room, you know?  Like, honestly, I don't, you know, it's not on tape or anything, but he probably said 
[03:32:00]  worse stuff about Eric right before you turned the mic on.  Right.  And that's just based on, just based on the precedent that's been set for Roland's behavior.  Right.  Like, I would assume that.  I don't have any specific recollection.  Right.  Of him sitting there trashing Eric, but I would assume that there's a good chance.  Yeah.  That he was trashing Eric even worse before we even turned the mics on.  Right.  Roland.  No, I didn't say anything about him until the mic.  You don't think so?  No, because I just walked in.  So.  The mics were on.  I didn't know the mics were on automatically. 
[03:32:30]  That's what I was like.  Eric, I guess the question on everybody's mind is, why don't you like pussy?  Ah, that's not the case at all.  No, because that's what I try to say.  I did the joke in front of Dr. Ruth, and she turned around to me saying, you're the one  with the problem.  All right.  So you did.  She faced me.  So you met Dr. Ruth when?  We all did.  Yeah, I know, but we all.  Friday, right?  Friday.  There's listeners listening.  Oh, Friday.  So we bring them on, too.  No, I was trying to remember.  No, Friday.  Friday.  And you did this joke.  I did a dumbass joke.  And Dr. Ruth threw.  Oh, she threw right. 
[03:33:00]  She goes, you are the one with the problem.  Yeah, she walked away from whoever she, I don't know if it was me or you she was taking  the photo with.  Yeah.  When Roland threw that comment out, and she just stuck her finger out and marched right over to him.  She goes, the one who makes that comment is the one who has the problem.  A sexual problem, yeah.  Yeah, and she goes, you have sexual problems.  Roland, do you have sexual problems?  No, just a lack of pussy.  That would be the problem.  What does that have to do with you going in yesterday and saying that into a microphone  for no apparent reason?  I don't know.  Why do we do half the stuff in this show that we do? 
[03:33:30]  Why do we do the things we do?  That's one of those ageless questions, isn't it?  It's just you have sugar.  You're here for 12, 13 hours.  Eric, it's not sugar.  Roland just enjoys an audience.  Is that all?  Do you hear in the tape?  I mean, there's nothing cut out.  It's not even vicious, the way he's saying it.  It's not when you can see when Roland's starting to turn, you know, when his facial expressions  and all of a sudden he's speaking a lot more clearly.  Yeah.  That's when he gets vicious?  You can see when Roland's really starting to get mad or he's about to get really evil. 
[03:34:00]  He does that with you?  No, I've seen him do it to other people.  Like who?  So, um, Voss, Dave, Poe.  You know, you can see when Roland's kind of changing.  This was still his, he doesn't like sex.  Why does he?  It's because he likes an audience.  He just likes to throw random things out there that he thinks are hurtful, but he kids, he  kids.  But why are they always about you?  It's not always about me.  That particular incident happened to be about me. 
[03:34:30]  Troy, who is it most often about?  I do random people.  Maybe around you two he does, but when he's in the hallway, he's making fun of, you know,  some of the coordinators on the floor.  He does shit about you, Sam.  I think Roland's pretty balanced in his goofing.  Yeah.  Is he balanced or is he balanced in the sense that since we all make fun of Eric a lot,  we all brush it off?  No, I think Roland's a little different.  I think it's balanced because Roland will even go after, there's girls in this building  that like Roland and he'll go after them. 
[03:35:00]  What do you mean like Roland?  They come by to see if Roland's in the office.  They come by to talk to Roland.  They like him as a coworker.  They like him like on the playground.  I like him.  I suspect playground like, like, but Roland says, Roland says, he blows it off every time  I point it out.  It sounds like we found the solution to that vaginal problem you were talking about.  And then it's like the other guy when he yelled, boring, he was upset with me.  So you have girls here that like, like you.  Well, let's say this morning I walked into the office, right? 
[03:35:30]  You did.  And there's a.  Caught your breath.  Shut up.  There's a Valentine heart and a card laying on the desk for Roland.  Hey.  There's, there's a lot of girls that actually like Roland.  Yeah.  But Roland refuses to acknowledge it.  We have two mutual friends that both love Roland very much.  Who?  Who's, who's we?  Roland and I have.  Well, you guys are in a bromance.  Of course, that's the week.  It's two people that used to live in the same building.  Oh, and these don't even work here.  No, no, no.  But they like Roland very much in the sense that they think he's funny or. 
[03:36:00]  Well, they really like him a lot as a person.  I mean, I don't know.  He's not interested in either of them, anything romantically.  So I don't think he's ever pursued anything.  Why not?  Are they ugly?  Are they good looking?  They're both really hot.  So Roland, what are you, what are you doing?  They have issues.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, they have, they're, they're like major broad issues.  Yeah.  Crazy, crazy women.  It's better to enjoy them as friends and have a great time.  But aren't they all, don't most women have some kind of issue?  Some, yeah, they all have issues. 
[03:36:30]  Some, I said most.  No, they all do.  Oh.  Well, they have hormones and it just fucks everything up.  I think men have hormones.  They do, but women think, men think logically, women think.  Logically?  Hormonally.  Okay.  Whatever.  That's going to get a lot of people angry.  But, well, it is.  Controversial.  Every guy knows that's true.  All right.  And women know that's true, too.  Things, I fucking did something crazy.  Their hindsight is good.  Yeah.  But not their foresight.  No.  No.  No.  Short-sighted, even.  Right.  So, but these two broads are pretty, they're pretty, they're hot, they're cool, but they're 
[03:37:00]  fucking loony.  So I think Roland just doesn't feel like dealing with that.  And that's the right move, you think?  I mean, you have to put up with some bullshit to get pussy.  Wait, what about these girls that work here?  I don't even know who, which, which ones they're talking about.  I think he's the one, the guy who was talking to her, they yelled boring, they got upset  with me.  Oh, because you yell boring, and it was, well.  Yeah, another guy came to my office yesterday, they sent him around saying the hallway was  closed.  Roland just goes layers and layers deep into people that nobody knows who they are, and 
[03:37:30]  it's just like mumbling, like, what's going on?  Eric.  Yeah.  These girls that like Roland.  Yeah.  That like, like Roland.  I think one of them likes Roland, the other one tags along.  Are they good looking?  Yes, they're good looking.  With the one that like, likes him?  Yeah.  Is good looking?  Is good looking, yes.  Is she better looking than her friend?  That just tags along?  I would say so.  Oh my gosh, Roland.  Is she crazy? 
[03:38:00]  I mean, she doesn't, I've talked to her before, she doesn't seem crazy.  And I pointed out to him.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Roland just wrote a note.  E-Rock, I don't know if you heard this, I heard it, Roland wrote a note to Troy, I guess  it was somebody's name.  The name, yeah.  And Troy goes like this.  Oh, man.  Yeah, this girl's pretty hot.  She is, yeah.  Not that she's, oh man, like she's crazy.  No, no, no, no, no.  This girl's pretty hot.  Like, this girl's probably in the top, top girl, hot girls at this place.  Top what?  Top, top, top five. 
[03:38:30]  Top five.  Is it, is it, is it Monica?  No, no, no.  It's not Monica.  Well, you'd put Monica in that list.  Yeah.  Okay.  So now I've narrowed it down.  It's not, okay.  Well, she's been on the air, so we can't do that.  Now there's only four laps.  Now there's only four laps.  But in this case here, you know, this girl, who I guess we all agree is very good looking,  I guess, has talked to, I know has at least talked to me, and has dropped some subtle  hints where it inquires about Roland. 
[03:39:00]  And I've brought this to his attention, and he still refuses to acknowledge it.  I just don't think she is, to me, that way.  But you don't know unless you explore.  I think this girl, from the little that I do know about her, I don't think, I think  Roland's personality is, she would be attracted to that, and that would be enough for her to  be really into him.  She's like a cool, she's a cool chick in the sense that she's not looking for the, you  know, good looking.  In shape.  Yeah.  I'll say, let's call it, let's call it the Troy Kwan. 
[03:39:30]  Nah, I mean.  That's what he drew.  Yeah.  She's all right with, I drew Roland earlier today, and I told him it was easy to draw him,  because all you have to do is draw a snowman with arms, and that's, that's Roland.  And a panda face.  But you're saying that this is a girl who, even though she's banging, she's top five at  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  She'd be okay with a snowman panda bear.  I think, see.  That's the impression I got.  Oh my God.  Is she crazy?  I mean.  Based on your impressions.  What broad is it?  That's right.  You're the wrong person to ask. 
[03:40:00]  E-Rock, is she crazy?  She, every time I've seen her or talked to her, she has seen fine.  You would assume she's crazy because her genitals are internal.  Yeah.  Okay.  Roland.  Yes.  Isn't this worth, by the way, I love, and this is why  Opie yells at E-Rock about taking shit.  Like, we went from Roland saying E-Rock doesn't like pussy, he likes sandwiches, to E-Rock  being like, you know, Roland, you should really go after this chick. 
[03:40:30]  I think she likes you.  It's like, I gave up.  Eric's being like a good guy, though.  Like, Eric's being like a bro, and Roland's just being like, fuck you, dude.  Yeah, I mean, that's just, that's just Roland.  Is it?  Yeah.  Or is it, that's just Eric?  Both.  You know?  Yeah.  And that's the relationship we're stuck with.  That's the part that Opie can never figure out when he's like, I thought you guys are  supposed to be friends.  Like, Eric is just a guy who, at the end of the day, he'll be like, all right, I'll be  cool.  And Roland is just a guy, at the end of the day, he's going to bust your balls. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  I mean, but that's the dynamic of the relationship, because Roland just busts everybody's balls.  And Eric, he's easily, he can forgive pretty easy.  And he also does.  Or does he just forget?  I think he probably just forgets.  And he also, he's not going to really hold a grudge, because he needs Roland's help with  a lot of things.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  And we've discussed that before here.  Yeah.  I don't even think Eric wants to get into it.  I want to get into, Matt, in New Jersey, you're on the After Oak and Anthony Live.  Hey, Roland, man. 
[03:41:30]  I dig what you bring to the show, so please don't take this the wrong way.  But in all honesty, when was the last time you've hooked up with a chick?  How long has the dry spell been?  More or less.  I don't know.  You're a busy guy.  So let me put this into perspective, okay?  We've talked about Roland's stresses.  We've talked about the pressures.  He's dealing with publicists.  And Roland is a guy who cannot leave his job at work.  Like, he's constant.  He's a workaholic.  So that, put it all into perspective, you know.  Okay.  So it's not like Roland, he goes out and he's social, but it's just picking up women 
[03:42:00]  is something Roland doesn't really have time for the way his mind works, I don't think.  Is that right, Roland?  Yeah, I'd say probably Thanksgiving week.  Okay.  So it wasn't that long ago.  November.  What, guys, wouldn't it make it better then for him to Roland to try to go for this chick  that's in the serious XM building?  I think he's got to.  It's crazy.  Yeah, but.  I think he fears rejection.  No, not that either, in the HR issue, yeah. 
[03:42:30]  No, but you could talk to a girl without making it an HR issue.  I mean, you could be like, hey.  Let's hang out sometime.  Yeah.  And keep it completely as friends.  Just like, hey, let's go grab dinner sometime and see how it goes.  Let's go get drinks.  And there's plenty of people that met here, working here, and they're married now.  So.  There are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They all seem happy.  I mean, look at Troy and Monica, for instance.  No, come on.  I'm just kidding.  I mean, you're great production partners.  She's got a great voice.  I've heard and seen.  She's done a lot of production for us.  You know that.  Oh, you bet she has.  I'll bet. 
[03:43:00]  I don't even begin to know the production she's done for you.  You're a shit starter.  I want the best for Roland.  And I want.  Can we narrow down any more of who this girl is?  Eric.  I don't think we need to really mention on the air who she is.  Yeah.  She's never been on the air with us.  You know, she doesn't work in our area.  I want to get her on the air.  She'd probably come on the air.  You think so?  To talk about this?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Well, don't tell her what we're going to talk about then.  She'll come on the air in general. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Get her on.  The thing is, she doesn't come until, like, later.  I love to see her walking around in the morning.  You do?  Yeah.  If I see her, I'll grab her.  I got to talk to her.  Yeah.  Because...  I don't.  See, I don't think she sees me that way.  I'm like, as a buddy.  But isn't it worth taking a chance?  Like, this is...  Okay, so this is all...  The jury's out here.  Okay?  This is Eric and Troy.  And they've told you that, bar none...  Eric, you'll go with Troy and saying top five hottest girls at Sirius? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, I'd say so.  Top five.  Yeah.  Okay?  And that's confirmed now.  Everybody pooled has voted her in the top five.  There's a lot of girls here, okay?  That means you're hot.  You got a girl who looks like that, who could potentially be into you?  I would say it's worth the risk.  What do you need?  Another friend?  Here's why I won't.  Because he has to see her every day, so if he's rejected, he would have to confront her  every day about it. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, but you just said she doesn't even work around here.  She walks around.  She walks around.  I'd say she comes in, like, a little bit later on in the morning.  But you could avoid her if you needed to.  Not really.  Look, Roland just needs some confidence.  He just needs confidence that he could do it, and he's got a great personality.  He makes girls laugh.  I mean, that's huge.  Right.  And you do things that most guys couldn't get.  Like, if Troy did the stuff that you do, no girl would laugh.  They'd think he was just a fucking schmuck.  Right.  And Roland can pull off some pretty crazy shit.  Like, he can...  He's, like, taking girls to, like, Beyonce concerts and sat next to, like, Paul McCartney 
[03:45:00]  and shit.  Like...  We've talked about this before.  Like, he pulls some crazy shit.  Like, what girl wouldn't think that was great?  Well, then, why not test the water?  Just start testing the waters.  Why not see...  Have you ever hung out with this girl socially?  No.  Why not do that?  Why don't we all go out and hang out socially?  Fine.  And just see what happens.  Maybe.  Or.  Or.  Just something.  Just spitballing here.  What if you and Troy and her go and get jerked off? 
[03:45:30]  Well, no.  Well, I don't know.  Well, I mean, I don't know how that's possible.  Is that a weird first...  I mean...  For her.  And a lot of...  Fingered, then.  I guess the term is fingered.  Well, there's very, very, very few girls that...  That's not a good first date.  Okay.  That think that's a good idea.  And a lot of girls are kind of looked down on getting jerked off.  Some don't.  Some poo-poo on it.  Some poo-poo on it.  Some think it's hysterical.  But some really don't like the idea of you going to a complete stranger, handing them money  to have them jerk you off. 
[03:46:00]  People are sending in little things on feedback that...  What's that feedback we're supposed to be doing?  I thought so, too.  But feedback still works.  Boom.  They're saying that...  Do you not like...  They're saying you don't like women.  On instant feedback.  I do.  Very much so.  Yeah.  It just...  This one's a different situation because it's at work.  Yeah.  And I can vouch for that.  That he likes women.  How can you?  Well, because we went to a...  You know...  Jerkoff parlor?  Yeah.  And I mean, he didn't...  I mean, he didn't walk out of...  I mean, I don't know why he would go if he wasn't going to... 
[03:46:30]  You're not paying for a great massage.  And he didn't walk out being like,  Yeah, Troy, that was great.  I just wish it had been a guy.  Yeah, I wish I was a dude.  He didn't say that.  No.  Oh, okay.  So that's the confirmation then.  Yeah.  And then I got some Russian person.  Did she call in?  Do you like this girl?  Which one?  Oh, this...  Yeah, but I just...  Which one?  Which one that jerked me off?  Yeah, why don't you ask the girl who jerked you off to drinks?  I did that once.  It became weird.  You really did that once? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the other times you got jerked off.  Yeah, it was the Russian girl.  Yeah, it got weird.  At a massage parlor.  I took her to dinner.  It was awkward.  And you took...  Why would you take her to dinner?  Because she goes,  Eh, we should go hang out.  Like, sure.  You're hungry?  She goes, yeah.  And then she...  You had to pay for the dinner.  Yeah.  Well, it was like a...  Was she a prostitute?  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Was she still listening?  She wasn't.  No, no, no.  She just liked you.  You'd been in a couple times.  Yeah, we hung out with that.  Yeah.  Why did it get weird?  Because her... 
[03:47:30]  I thought she knew a lot of English and that.  And then you'd go,  Hey, how's it going?  She goes, eh.  Well, luckily, you're not the easiest person in the world to understand.  So I don't see how that would become an issue.  Maybe they would just cancel each other out.  Yeah.  Like, I would think even if she did speak a lot of English,  there would still be a giant language barrier.  Yeah, then...  Yeah.  It just got weird.  I'll tell you guys off the air.  I want to know.  No.  You can't speak in vagaries?  I guess...  No.  Like a little less vague.  Let's just say dinner.  Three guys walk by the table to wave at her.  Hey!  Oh, okay. 
[03:48:00]  So she's known about town as somebody who performs services.  And all of a sudden, you're the asshole who took her to dinner.  Yeah.  You don't want to be, like...  Yeah, the next place you go, people are high-fiving.  She's sitting there with calloused hands.  And you're like, you're not a construction worker.  I know how you got those calluses.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  That was embarrassing.  It was like...  You can look past that.  I gotta know what...  Somebody...  Colby something in Canada is suggesting,  go for it, Roland.  Poke her in the brown eye. 
[03:48:30]  Have you ever considered the girl who works here  poking her in her brown eye?  No.  No, you haven't.  No.  It's something, though, right?  He's not poking her anywhere.  Not right now.  No.  I mean, I think you should go for it, personally.  Would you if you were in Roland's position?  Yeah, I mean, I know that it is weird working with somebody.  I kind of have something against that, too.  But, I mean, it's a completely different department,  so it's like...  Plus, the thing about work is that Roland,  no offense intended,  your personality is your asset here.  You know what I mean? 
[03:49:00]  Like, you're not gonna...  You know what I mean?  Like, girls getting to know you  is what you need to land a hot chick, I think.  Is that right?  Wow, that's...  Is that fair for me to say, Roland?  Yeah.  But it is true.  No, Roland's got a great personality,  and girls love it.  But that's why he needs to do things like this at work,  because you can't just go and meet someone at a bar,  and they'll get the full scope.  Roland, I know what it is.  You think I have landed any girls  based on these Hollywood good looks?  It's personality-based. 
[03:49:30]  It wasn't your luscious hair.  No, it wasn't the luscious hair, either.  It's personality-based,  and I understand putting in the groundwork,  putting in the time,  and winning these chicks over.  But you know what I mean?  The journey doesn't get any shorter by not starting it.  That's some fucking wisdom for you.  Yeah, he just doesn't have the confidence  to take the plunge.  But he should,  because he knows that he can do it.  He just has to put his mind to it.  Oh, it's like,  hey, lady,  what are you doing on, you know, whatever? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, let's just go grab some to eat.  Yeah, or go over to Caroline's.  Let's get drunk and make some decisions  that she'll regret later.  Get her all fucked up if you have to.  You know what I mean?  Take her out and don't even try anything.  Just have fun.  Yeah, that's the key,  because like Troy said,  she likes your personality.  Give her a chance to know Roland outside of work.  Just take your time.  I mean, it's been since Thanksgiving.  It's not going to kill you  to wait another couple weeks  where you're putting in some groundwork.  Yeah. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, take care of lines.  Call Greg Charles.  Right.  Get hooked up for free.  And when Roland goes out, man,  I mean, like I said,  he's got some pretty good hookups,  so he's really treated like VIP.  Like, he can roll into spots  and be taken care of.  Those are the spots you want to go to, obviously.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  None of this bullshit.  Because he looks important.  Yeah.  You know?  And girls like that.  Girls like power.  Girls like a good personality.  I mean, you know Hollywood people.  You got a good job.  You know what I mean?  There's nothing.  You're making this girl laugh, apparently.  And she's coming down to your office 
[03:51:00]  and, Eric, did you say she left him a valentine's?  Yeah, I walked in and there it was there  with a little card on top.  And I saw the name on it  because it wasn't, like, a sealed card.  And I went, oh.  Who left you a valentine, Eric?  Nobody.  Exactly.  This is what I'm talking about.  Who left you one?  Don't worry about who left me one.  All right.  That's not what we're talking about here.  Nobody left you one.  I got plenty of valentines, okay?  I'm the most popular boy here.  I choose you, choose you, Sam.  Thank you, Eric.  That makes me finally...  I got one.  I got one.  Sam did have two hot chicks 
[03:51:30]  wearing your shirt.  Exactly.  I got the bitches in check around here.  That's what's up.  They know what's good.  But like I was telling Bobby Kelly,  I got to keep the bitches in check.  You understand.  Roland, you on the other hand.  Bobby Kelly and his videos  up on Opie's YouTube.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was going to say,  you on the other hand,  you got to make sure  you take those bitches off check  because you don't need that.  No.  You need the bitches clamoring for you.  Yeah, Opie, real quick,  we should mention this.  If you haven't seen it,  it's hilarious. 
[03:52:00]  John Bones Jones was in here yesterday  and he choked out Bobby  because he was doing moves.  By the way, he choked out Norton too.  And I was talking to Opie  during the break and he said,  I think that video is going up today.  He's editing it still.  He wanted to put him out separately.  But the video of Bobby Kelly  getting choked out is hilarious.  And passing out.  Yeah, he almost passed out.  He was in here yesterday  talking about it.  But he was on the show  and John Jones put him  in that choke hold.  And Bob,  he said that he got  completely confused 
[03:52:30]  because he heard something  in his neck crack.  And so at that point,  he forgot he had to tap out  because he was worrying  about his neck.  And then he tapped out too late.  The room was starting  to get dark.  And just for good measure,  John Jones waited two seconds  after he tapped  before releasing him.  So Bobby just falls  like a slump.  You got to see it.  If you're,  if you're,  if you want to know why  Opie and Anthony say  that the show needs  a visual element,  check out  Opie Radio's YouTube page.  Look at,  look at the video he took  of Bob Kelly  getting choked out 
[03:53:00]  in the studio.  And today he's posting  the punch of Jimmy.  And yeah,  and the,  and the punch.  He really threw a punch.  I'm waiting to see  who actually gets choked out  here in the studio.  Like out,  out.  Yeah.  Somebody should do it.  Well,  I think it was funny about  John Jones was that  he was the first guy  that was kind of like,  listen,  I'm a fucking fighter.  This isn't like a fun thing  for people to do.  If you want me to put you  in a move,  I'm putting you in a move.  Like most of the other fighters  are like really light  or they'll let you go.  Like John Jones was like, 
[03:53:30]  just so you know,  I specifically have the power  to end your life.  Yeah.  In the hallway,  he said he next time  have everybody  saying release forms  and he wants to actually do it.  He wants to fight.  He wants to do like  a one real punch.  This is a guy  who beat Rampage Jackson  and he's coming in here  and choking out Bob Kelly.  I'd probably let him  choke me out cold.  To unconsciousness?  Yeah.  The only thing is like  when you do that,  when you do that,  yeah,  you sometimes piss yourself.  That would be great.  Or,  and you know what you could do? 
[03:54:00]  You could wake up  and then if you haven't,  then you piss yourself  for the show.  Right.  Just something funny.  I've been choked out,  completely out.  As a goof or?  Because I used to train  jujitsu.  You did?  Yeah.  Well,  you just pick up  every hobby.  This was like 10 years ago.  You got weird,  you got an interesting life.  I've worked,  I worked with a guy  who tattooed  and he would just,  he would train  everybody in the tattoo shop  for free.  So you know jujitsu.  A little bit.  No,  a little bit.  A real little bit.  Not enough to fight  John Jones.  I would never,  ever,  ever try to put it 
[03:54:30]  into an actual fight.  But enough that  you would take a choke out.  You were,  and you were choked out  to unconsciousness?  Yeah,  I've been out cold.  Doesn't that kill brain cells?  Isn't that a bad thing?  It's cutting off circulation  to your brain.  Yeah.  Of course.  But it did have  his luscious hair.  Did it help your hair?  Sure.  I mean,  it didn't hurt.  No,  it didn't hurt at all.  Obviously not at all.  So you would get choked out  to the point of,  Yeah,  but I mean,  they're weird about body fluids,  so I don't know  if that would happen.  Did you piss yourself  last time you got choked out?  No,  but I've been around people  that have pissed themselves. 
[03:55:00]  That's hilarious.  I've been choked out,  yeah.  Well,  is it a matter,  maybe you just don't drink water  before.  Yeah,  I mean,  you just literally  let go of everything,  so I would just,  things start flying out of you.  Somebody just asked,  would you let yourself  be raped  after quote-unquote  passing out?  No,  I don't want to be raped.  You wouldn't let,  quote-unquote  let yourself  be raped.  What are you writing down?  Blue,  oh,  I'm only writing down  Blu-rays  like I should give more away.  I also,  oh,  oh,  and Eric,  I don't know  if you put these on 
[03:55:30]  the Opie and Anthony  Facebook page,  but the other video,  we were talking about  visual elements to the show.  Opie was on a tirade  of visual elements yesterday.  He posted a video,  and Troy,  you got a picture with him  of,  what's his name,  Tiny from the Harlem Globetrotters,  Andre the Giant.  Opie posted a video  of him walking in the studio  when he was on the show yesterday,  and I mean,  it's hilarious.  He's seven foot eight.  He's massive.  I had my picture taken with him,  and he was like,  he dwarfed you.  Yeah,  he's like,  easily like a foot, 
[03:56:00]  way over a foot.  Did you make it,  even with the top of your hair,  did you make it to the titty?  I made it to his shoulder,  I think.  It's on my Twitter and Instagram.  You can see it.  Okay,  that's Troy Kwan.  But yeah,  check out these videos.  Eric,  are they on the Facebook page?  Yeah,  they're on the Opie and Anthony  on Facebook.  Good.  Good,  because it was a sight  to be seen yesterday.  It was pretty much  a freak show.  So,  Roland,  have you thought  about your strategy?  Are you going to go  after this chick? 
[03:56:30]  I'll take it out for drinks.  You are going to.  I will.  You can do that like,  this weekend?  I have plans  after the publicist  this weekend,  next weekend.  Next weekend,  you're going to do it?  I will.  Troy,  I need you to be on top of this.  Yeah,  I mean,  it's,  I've been trying to encourage Roland  to do a lot of things.  Yeah,  I know.  He has to just sort of  make it up in his own mind  that he wants it.  Do you want this  or are you doing this  so we shut up?  No,  I'll go explore and see.  Just do what happens.  Not,  well,  the worst is  I'll get drunk.  Right, 
[03:57:00]  that's the way to get out  of any sort of HR  or weird issues  is  you just go and hang out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  And don't expect anything.  No.  Right.  Other than conversation.  And if this girl  is the girl  who I'm thinking of,  you shouldn't expect anything.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But a good time.  A good conversation.  And maybe get her liquored up  and she makes a mistake.  Who knows?  I don't know for sure  what's going to happen.  I just,  yeah,  I think Roland sitting here  always thinks it's a good idea  and then actually  when it comes down to it, 
[03:57:30]  he's just...  Well,  it's a scary thing to do.  Of course.  Because then you have to see  the person every day.  It's one thing if you hit on a girl  at a bar,  it's like if she rejects it,  you just walk away  and you don't have to ever see her again.  Right.  Now,  like even avoiding her,  she'll be here.  But she's a nice person,  you're a nice person,  and you'd move on from it.  Yeah.  And it'd be worth the attempt.  Yeah.  If it's,  you know,  the,  I don't know what the success rate will be,  but even if it's a 28% chance  of a yes.  Okay, 
[03:58:00]  fine.  We'll go 15.  I still think it's worth it.  That 15% is worth it.  Because how many other opportunities  are you going to get like this?  I don't know.  Probably not very many.  No,  no.  Probably not very many.  And tomorrow,  Andrew Lincoln on the show.  From Walking Dead?  From Walking Dead.  The Lead.  That's very exciting.  That's very exciting.  Um,  fine.  Roland,  this is one.  One.  Don't,  no,  don't,  anybody else call up for this?  I'm doing one for Roland.  Joker.  Hey,  guys.  What's up?  Roland, 
[03:58:30]  go with what you know,  man.  You are the connoisseur of,  of everywhere to go eat out there.  I mean,  absolutely everywhere.  You're the best at it.  Go to that girl,  find out where she'd like to go eat,  and you can name the best places.  Do you know what she,  what type of food she likes?  I know,  thank God she's not a vegetarian.  You don't like vegetarians?  No,  I took one girl out,  I thought she,  at two barbecue place,  and then she told me she was a vegetarian,  if we could leave,  but the problem was,  I really had a barbecue hankering at that moment. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah,  which is most moments,  by the way.  Yes.  So,  I said,  we should just stay here,  and then she goes,  I'm leaving,  so she left.  And you stayed for the barbecue?  I couldn't resist,  it's delicious.  It's too,  too good.  Joker,  Eric has a question for you.  Yeah.  Wasn't Joker the one who was going to give Troy  some information about joining those swingers clubs?  Yeah,  Joker is the one,  and Joker gave the information to Troy,  and Troy finally emailed me back,  said,  thank you,  but I'm probably not going to use it. 
[03:59:30]  Aww.  Why don't you swing?  Why don't you fucking have a good time?  We're over here,  you're giving Roland a hard time.  Why don't you have a good time in your life?  That one's a different,  that's like a life-changing step.  Yeah,  I don't know,  man,  that's a weird plunge.  That's a weird thing to take.  Thank you,  Joker,  I appreciate it,  man,  I don't know,  I don't really have the,  I don't know,  man,  that's a tough one.  Yeah,  because Troy will have to wear leather,  purple all the time.  That's an S&M club,  that's a whole different deal.  Yeah,  no,  that's how we'd know.  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  He'd have a handlebar,  or not a Hulk Hogan mustache,  all of a sudden.  He'll smell like Old Spice.  Yeah.  Oh my God,  he actually did it.  Joker actually called up  because he wanted a Blu-ray.  Does he deserve one,  Roland?  I'll give him two Blu-rays.  Which ones?  All right.  In Time,  and the other Jack Black movie.  Okay,  congratulations,  Joker.  Thanks,  man.  All right,  buddy.  I wanted to also give this another play.  Troy has started taking show elements,  and actually creating,  like,  club songs. 
[04:00:30]  Like,  this is the type of stuff you do.  Yeah.  Would you,  you did a,  the Henry Winkler PSA,  the You Are Never to Blame PSA.  You remixed it.  Yeah,  it just was so creepy.  It just had to be remixed.  And you,  and is this something you would play in a club?  Yeah,  I mean,  it's,  it's a little bit more like a radio base,  because,  you know,  a club,  you don't really have too many samples.  I know that it sounds a little weird,  but.  I was saying Fonzie.  You'd have like a little more minimal,  where this is actually like a little more like content from the PSA. 
[04:01:00]  Like people would be dancing,  and then all of a sudden you'd hear somebody saying anus,  and you'd be like,  what?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah,  I mean,  I don't know.  Who knows?  Weirder things have gotten into clubs,  but it's not really,  it was just the gold of,  I like that kind of music,  so it's fun to do,  so.  Well,  here's,  here's the Henry Winkler PSA.  Remix!  That's how you do it,  right?  You gotta like,  shout it.  Remix!  Like that.  You gotta have the record spinning backwards.  I don't have the.  Remix!  I don't have the record.  No.  I just play it then.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Don't touch me like that. 
[04:01:30]  Don't,  don't touch me like that.  No.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  You know I really like you,  but I don't like the way you touch me.  Touch me.  Touch me.  No.  Touch me.  Touch me.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Touch me.  No.  Do you ever hear anything like this?  This,  this,  this,  this.  Anus.  A-  A-  A-  Anus. 
[04:02:00]  Is a useful thing indeed.  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  Remember that anus  is the proper word.  Anus.  A-  A-  A-  Anus.  It's relief in time of me.  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  A-  No.  Bulba. 
[04:02:30]  Bulba.  Bulba.  Is what girls have down below.  Bulba.  Bulba.  Bulba.  When she's naked,  it will show penis.  Penis.  Penis.  Hip, hip.  Penis.  Here's what boys have down the front.
