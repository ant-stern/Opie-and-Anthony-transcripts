<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Rush Limbaugh's impending deafness, punctuated by jokes and impersonations.  This transitioned into a series of calls, some expressing varied reactions to the start of the bombing of Afghanistan, others featuring crude humor and offensive language. A caller shared an anecdote about attending a school for the deaf.  A significant portion of the show was dominated by a heated confrontation with "Stalker Patty," a frequent caller distraught over being denied backstage access at a comedy benefit.  The hosts and other callers verbally attacked and mocked Patty, who responded with emotional outbursts and tearful apologies amidst frequent interruptions and vulgar language. Malk, a French chef, was a guest, bringing pastries. Colin Quinn and Stephen Lynch were also scheduled to appear later.

The conflict with Patty continued, with Opie expressing particular anger due to Patty contacting his girlfriend. The hosts' anger escalated, resulting in a prolonged, uncomfortable exchange where they tried to force Patty to leave.  The situation involved numerous insults, shouting matches, and contributions from callers both supporting and criticizing the hosts' treatment of Patty.  Colin Quinn and Stephen Lynch were present in studio, and Snoop Dogg called in. Patty, visibly upset and crying, eventually left the studio.  Prank calls were interspersed after Patty's departure.

Snoop Dogg's call promoted his upcoming movie and soundtrack.  The hosts engaged in extensive, crude impersonations of AAVE, using sexually suggestive and offensive comments referencing Snoop Dogg's music and lifestyle.  They also made disparaging remarks about women’s bodies. This was followed by a segment featuring female callers "Marion" and "Lady Di" in studio. The hosts continued their offensive and sexually charged banter, making fun of their appearances and personalities with crude jokes and insults focused on weight, sexual activity, and mental disabilities.  Colin Quinn's presence was noted, but his contributions were minimal.  Further crude jokes and negative listener calls reinforced the show’s offensive tone.

A substantial portion of the show involved listener calls, many highly irreverent and offensive.  A young boy, Gary, engaged in a profane and combative exchange with the hosts, using insults like "fatso" toward the female co-hosts.  The hosts found this highly entertaining. Other callers contributed to the chaotic and offensive atmosphere, including one proposing discriminatory air travel legislation and another sharing a news story about a disruptive plane passenger, both resulting in derogatory comments from the hosts and callers. Anthony recounted a near-miss car accident. The conversation included various sexually suggestive comments and jokes. Robert Englund did a brief voiceover for a commercial break. The show ended with a "What Did We Learn" segment featuring humorous and crude observations about the show’s content.  Throughout this segment, the hosts frequently used offensive language and engaged in crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Live.  Live, that's right.  We're here today.  A lot of people think we're taking off today for some reason.  Because it's Columbus Day or something.  We were Columbus Day.  Right.  We were Columbus Day.  Our ears are on loan from God.  Please don't take them away anytime soon.  You are awful.  Please, God, don't take my ears away from me.  Holy S.  You're horrible, man. 
[00:00:30]  The poor guy.  Horrible.  It affects everybody in radio.  How?  It's your worst nightmare.  Wow.  If you haven't heard Rush Limbaugh announce today that he is deaf.  I am deaf.  He will be completely deaf within 10 days.  Wow.  That was quick.  He said in May, you know, the end of May, he started losing his hearing.  He said he announced today that he's deaf. 
[00:01:00]  And, like, in 10 days, he'll be just completely deaf.  He can no longer hear his callers.  No.  Well, that's kind of a good thing.  Why?  Oh, because his call.  Think about it, man.  Oh, we're just kidding.  Wow.  I bet the Democrats are getting a good chuckle.  You know?  Poor guy.  That's horrible, though.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Yeah.  That's, like, breaking news.  So, there you have it.  Rush Limbaugh dead. 
[00:01:30]  I mean, deaf.  No dead rumors.  Stop it.  People have been wondering what's wrong with his voice for the last couple of months, I guess.  Yeah, a lot of people have been writing on message boards and stuff.  Hey, Rush don't sound right.  Because he's got the deaf guy, like, accent thing going now.  I wonder if that affects his contract.  But, wow, he just signed for some huge money.  What was that?  A hundred?  A quarter, a quarter billion.  Oh, 250 mil.  A quarter billion dollars.  So, cut that in, like, tenths, and then it's probably the real number. 
[00:02:00]  We know how that works.  Every number they print is a lot less.  That's just horrible, though.  So, there you have it.  Ears on loan from God.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Rush.  Rush, you're on.  Music stop.  Whistle.  Rush, Rush.  Oh, hello.  The Rush Limbaugh Show.  Poor guy.  He's got that high-pitched voice thing going, the deaf people.  I told you the story. 
[00:02:30]  I used to live next door to deaf people.  They would get into arguments on the front lawn because they couldn't hear it.  And the daughter that lived there, she was able to hear.  So, she would start yelling at her parents.  And her parents are yelling back.  And all you'd hear is,  And their hands are going.  Sounds like it.  And they're going,  It's horrible.  Sounds like a creature from Jurassic Park.  It was.  It was.  It's two.  Do we have some?  Oh, no. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no.  Excellent.  They're more getting their way into my mimbo's mall.  With timing on all from gone.  It's my mimbo.  I'm about to have them and back.  They're about to have a horn.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There was no train.  Hey, he can't hear this.  Well, I give a crap.  There was no downtown.  Airborne.  Some time to disappear.  The bonds are forming in Afghanistan.

Is it true that it results untreated syphilis?  What?  Is it true that you went deaf because you had to clap and didn't treat it?  What?  You heard...  Well, somebody translate.  Give him the finger.  Uncle John, I'm writing it down as fast as I can.  Appreciate it.  Now, here's his question.  Oh!  No, I never had the crap.

Buzz, they didn't move to Vigno.  I want you to know you can function like a movement bear and even don't do that.  They didn't move to Vigno.  That's with this book, Arthur.  What?  Rush...  Rush!  Are we in commercial print?  That ought to hold a little ep in for a while.  No, no, no, Rush.  You're still in there.  Look.  Come here. 
[00:07:30]  I hate my listeners.  Rush!  I hate my listeners.  Rush!  Stop here!  That ought to hold the little effing ball of iron.  No, no, no, Rush, you're still in the air.  I hate my whittiness.  I hate my whittiness.  Rush, go over here.  Now I can kick back and smoke a cigar.  What a bunch of ants.  Rush, go over here.  Oh, hello.  We're back.  We're still in the air.  Uh-huh.  Have a moment of silence for Rush.  Oh, damn. 
[00:08:00]  Ow.  Hey, man, it's horrible.  Anyway.  Big thing I'm having.  Rush, your thoughts on the fact that we have started bombing Afghanistan?  Rush.  I can use the more pasta.  Rush.  I want more pasta. 
[00:08:30]  Rush, your thoughts on the bombings in Afghanistan?  My, my drawers on the calming of what?  No.  Rush.  No.  Look at the TV.  What?  Look at the TV.  I think that, oh, they're done both.  Yeah.  Draw, done, done.  Yeah.  Sarah.  Yes.  What's up?  Nothing.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Calling in from Boston.  Okay.  Went to school at RIT in Rochester, New York.  Had the National Technical Institute for the Deaf on my campus. 
[00:09:00]  Uh-huh.  Went to school, you know, with all deaf kids, had interpreters.  Freshman year, regular hearing kids in the deaf dorms.  They used to have strobe, um, strobe lights in their dorm rooms.  Hearing kids would go over to the deaf dorm, pull the lights just so for a laser show, you know, they'd be...  You know, Anthony, sometimes being deaf, I think, could be a blessing.  Ah.  Hello?  No, they got picked on at school, though.  Hello?  And we were ruthless.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[00:09:30]  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  All right.  Well, I called in to say you guys are mean.  I'm changing my name to Hush Limbaugh.  Well, I played the tie-in game every day.  It's going to be interesting to see how he does the show.  Ow.  All right.  I just want to announce that today, and... 
[00:10:00]  All right.  That's the cool bastard today.  I did nothing.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I have a theory as to why Rush went deaf.  Yeah.  I believe Lewis began calling his program, and he shoved a pencil through his ear.  A Lewis joke.  Hey, Garrett, talk to you later.  Very good.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Jim, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  Just wanted to know.  I wasn't aware that Blair's retarded sister from The Facts of Life just had her own radio gig. 
[00:10:30]  A jury reference.  Nice.  Thanks, man.  It was your cousin, though.  It was your cousin.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Frank.  Hey, Frank.  What's going on, man?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  So yesterday, I'm watching TV, getting ready for football games, and here we're at war.  Do I worry we're at war?  Do I think, oh, we're going to get retaliatory strikes?  No.  I'm just happy that Anthony will shut the F up.  Why?  Because you've been bitching all week.  Well, silly me.  I was bitching that we weren't bombing something last week.  That's true.  What?  Like everybody else wasn't pissed? 
[00:11:00]  And then I calmed down because, as I said last week, I have a feeling that it's going  to kick up, you know?  That's what I was saying.  All right, guys.  I'm out of here.  Okay.  Are you psyched that we've started the bombing or what?  Oh, absolutely.  Of course.  I'm totally psyched.  Makes us feel a little better, right?  Hell yeah.  I watched the bombing instead of watching football all day.  Better than the football.  There was nothing to see.  I know.  That stupid night vision thing.  I like the Gulf War program better.  I like that TV show.  Where you see the video of the bomb as it's next to the big penis building that was in 
[00:11:30]  Baghdad.  Well, it's early.  Yeah.  Maybe the ratings go up.  You never know.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  But, uh, is this true?  Magnum from Bayside saying that Opie took the Taliban and three points?  Uh-uh.  Not even.  Is that true?  Not even going to.  No?  Discuss that.  Tim, what's up?  Guys, how you doing?  Hey.  Ant, I got three words for you.  Yeah.  It's about effing time.  Yeah.  I have to agree with you.  You weren't, you know, you were pretty laid back, but I think we waited a little too 
[00:12:00]  long, but, you know, we have to get our information right.  I don't, I understand.  But, no, Opie, don't be such a puss.  No, I understand why we waited.  We had to get everyone in position.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know what the funniest thing is?  It was frustrating to sit here and wait, and I'm glad it has begun.  Did you read the paper today about the, uh, the food drop?  Yeah.  They made specific or special vegetarian meals for the Muslims.  Did they?  What the F, man?  Well, we're trying to win their hearts and minds at the same time.  But what are they going to wash it down with, a bowl of sand?  I think it's hysterical that we bomb their country. 
[00:12:30]  And then we drop food.  And we feed them at the same time.  Yeah, yeah.  Have some bombs and this.  Just this ridiculous way to deal with stuff.  But it's the guilt of being an American.  It's also a sign of accessory.  It's a good sign of faith for the United States to say, listen, we don't hate the Afghanis.  We just hate that scumbag bin Laden and the other guy.  And the government that's in place.  You know, it's the government.  It's not the people.  But, Ant?  Is it true that we dropped TV dinners right after we bombed Hiroshima?  Yeah, and they cooked in five seconds. 
[00:13:00]  They cooked on the ground.  I heard that one's true.  They cooked in midair.  All right, Ant, listen.  We're going to kick some ass.  Yeah.  All right, Opie.  Get with the program.  Tim, what are you talking about?  Come on, Opie.  I'm only busting Opie.  But I've been...  Get easy.  I've been frustrated just like everyone else.  I know.  I'm just trying...  Opie, I'm trying to get some chuckles.  You know, we talking chuckles before?  Okay?  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  See you later, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Yeah, you know what's...  You know what's cool?  We've been dropping this food.  You know, we cleared out the way a little bit from the anti-aircraft stuff and the planes, 
[00:13:30]  and now we're dropping this food.  But we've been dropping food.  Pakistan has all of a sudden cut off the food that they were sending to Afghanistan  because it's too dangerous to go in now that we've attacked.  So they were sending a lot more food than we're dropping.  Right.  So the net result here is that they're getting less food now than they were.  Great.  I don't really care.  I don't care.  It seems to me that there are cowardly people that would rather be killed and tortured by 
[00:14:00]  their own government than stand with the alliance or whoever they want to stand with  against their government.  They'd rather just sit in the sand and have their government kill them.  So, you know, what's it our business to feed them?  I could give a crap.  I say we just go in, bomb everything, take it over.  Now we have United States of the Middle East.  United States of Afghanistan?  Of Afghanistan.  Whatever it is.  It'll just be on.  It's only the size of Texas, they say. 
[00:14:30]  So it's another state.  I'm fine with that.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Oh, eh.  Yeah.  You know, I've been listening to you guys since September of 98.  I'm a loyal listener.  Yeah.  But all I got to say is that Rush Limbaugh, that's so wrong.  What Rush Limbaugh?  I'm like that.  We just started the show today talking about the war.  What's your problem?  No, well, eh, eh, eh, crap like that goes back to your doorstep.  You know, God can play a cruel joke.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  Yeah, B.B., you know.  Well, maybe.  So why is the pumpkin head?  So why is the blabbering idiot?  But maybe for the last 12, how long has he been on the radio? 
[00:15:00]  He shouldn't have said, you know, talent on loan from God.  Maybe God took it personally and decided to take his ears back.  Ow.  But still, you know, I'm a little compassion for the stupid, you know?  All right.  All right.  I'm being compassionate.  All right.  Now let's get back to the fun.  Goodbye.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  You got to admit, it was kind of funny, though.  Yeah, it was.  But that's the big thing.  That's what bothered you.  You're like, oh, my God.  This is so wrong.  But I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm saying to myself, oh, this is so wrong.  Oh, this is so wrong.  Right.  All right, Jimmy. 
[00:15:30]  Goodbye.  Bye.  And there is something funny, just thinking about Rush Limbaugh in his house, looking at  his dusty Walkman.  Oh, God.  What would you do?  He was saying today that he's got 10 years left on his ears.  Right.  What would you do?  Yes.  10 years left on his ears.  No, 10 days left.  I mean, 10 days.  I'm sorry.  10 days.  What would you do?  You have 10 days left to hear anything.  Would you listen to some Mozart?  No.  You know what I would do?  I would listen to girls having orgasms.  What the hell was that? 
[00:16:00]  Joseph Goebbels just walked into the studio.  Joseph Goebbels.  That was Malk.  That was Malk, the French chef.  He is coming to surrender his country.  Neville.  Neville.  Neville.  Neville.  What did you bring, like the French?  We dropped bombs.  You brought Napoleon.  Napoleon.  What is that?  Some paisley?  Yes.  I like that.  I had some this weekend, remember?  Malk, what is France doing to help with the American well-effled? 
[00:16:30]  They are digging a hole.  Yes.  They are putting themselves in the hole with a grenade.  Is that it?  Yes.  What?  They are putting themselves up.  Why does not the French help the American?  Because there are a bunch of effing morons.  Morons.  Well, you know, you can cook.  So supply the food.  Never.  What did you bring?  Because I like that.  I bought some Napoleon and some sherry pound cake.  You know what?  I went to Mark's restaurant over the weekend. 
[00:17:00]  Saint-Michel.  Saint-Michel.  Saint-Michel in Brooklyn.  And it's got to be good because Big Kev even liked it.  Yeah, you had desserts.  And he's picky.  And boy, you were on overtime when Big Kev was in there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I almost need two chairs over there for him.  Get me a bucket.  Get a bit of thrill up.  You went on a date with Big Kev?  Yeah, I went on a date with Big Kev.  That was it.  To a French restaurant.  Sure.  And I heard he drives very fast on the street.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  How about the resistance? 
[00:17:30]  Resistance is dead since 1945.  The French resistance.  We resist any conflict.  Yeah, they run away.  They're strong between their legs.  We resist battles.  No, you know what?  They're going to try to shoot American planes by mistake.  And has the French allowed us to fly over their airspace?  Yes, they do, actually.  Because they learned from last time.  I can have a man there, too.  Very good.  Well, thank you, Phil.  The pastry man.  I hope you would enjoy it as well.  What is that?  Is that hip cake?  What is it?  Yeah, hip cake. 
[00:18:00]  Hip cake.  All right, Mark.  Wait outside.  We'll play foosball.  He's supposed to be really good.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Mark the French man.  Mark the French man.  Mark the French man.  Some pastries.  Some pastries.  That's all we need today.  Pastries.  Uh-huh.  Thank heaven.  I'm horny.  All right, we're just getting started.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  Did we do anything this first break?  I don't even know.  Yeah, we did a little rush.  Ah, there you go.  Snoop Doggy Dog calling in today.

Ant's car accident.  Oh, and lots of other things.  We've got to talk about our trip to Philly that's coming up in just over a week.  Mm-hmm.  And more of your phone calls.  Stay there.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin. 
[00:19:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Feel the love.  Anthony Stackertu, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah, summer's over.  Summer's way over.

Let's start talking about Thanksgiving on the way and how you want to get thin before you stuff yourself this Thanksgiving season.  I'm going to go even further.  Summer right around the corner.  Get in shape for that bikini or bathing suit.  How about Halloween right around the corner?  You're going to eat a lot of candy.

Jim Norton sitting in.  Norton is just horrid at foosball.  We're out there during the commercial break playing.  Every time the ball goes near Norton, he's just, I stink.  Oh, I should have a C with how I play. 
[00:20:30]  That's how he's saying.  I'm a Mary.  I'm such a girl.  I should have a C.  He just spins.  It was Ann and one of the interns against me and the French guy.  And I've never actually seen foosball guys surrender.  Hey, Joe, what's going on today?  How are you guys doing?  Norton, you sick F.  How are you?  Good, buddy.  How you doing?  I was just watching CNN, and President Bush was signing the declaration, you know, proclaiming 
[00:21:00]  today Columbus Day.  And then he says, you know, like her mother before, who sang for the Kennedys, he goes,  Liza Minnelli is here.  Oh.  Dude, she came out, and she started singing this song.  And I know next time you have Canton in, he's going to go nuts about this.  But it was the most God-awful thing that my ears have ever had the displeasure of hearing.  I wonder if we can get a copy of that. 
[00:21:30]  Dude, it was, I swear to God, they had to like, they weren't, they weren't like showing  the crowd too much, because people were snickering.  Dude, Liza Minnelli stinks.  Dude, they couldn't contain themselves, and it was.  It must have been bad, because there's a ton of people calling saying, you should have  saw what was just on TV.  Now I need to, now I need to hear the song.  It was like, yes, I can, muggers on the streets.  Right.  It was, I would rather be tied to a chair and have somebody just punch me in the head over 
[00:22:00]  and over.  Wonderful.  I'll let you guys go, but yeah, get a copy of that.  You'll have a lot of fun with it.  We'll definitely find it.  Thank you, brother.  Let's move on to Colin.  Yes, Jim, sorry.  No, no, no, just saying that Liza, I mean, you know, as Linda Marola and Arthur, we all  believe she was brilliant.  But, you know, as a singer, she's just an overrated relic.  Enough.  Oh, Linda.  Enough.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, you guys.  What's going on?  You tell us.  I heard a rumor today on the internet that Rush Limbaugh slipped in a puddle of Helen Keller 
[00:22:30]  disease.  Oh, God.  I don't know if you know anything about that.  Helen Keller, always funny.  Oh, yeah.  Hilarious.  All right.  Peace, guys.  All right, bro.  Bye.  Bye.  Very pleasing.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  All right.  Yes, I wanted to know, last Friday, I didn't get a chance to see the Jay Moore show, but  how was that?  How was that?  How was that what?  Show.  How was the show? 
[00:23:00]  Well, yeah.  The benefit.  How much did you raise?  How did it turn out?  It was great.  Yeah, I'd like to know how much we raised.  It was a great time last night at the Beacon Theater with...  Dina Cola.  Dina Cola killed.  Lynch killed.  Lynch is coming in later?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm sure he was...  I'm sure he's still sleeping.  I'm sure he's a little hungover.  He likes to tip him back a little bit.  Who does?  We were all pounding him pretty good.  And then Jay Moore.  Yeah.  I've seen him, I don't know, 12 to 15 times.  He killed last night.  Killed.  Killed.  Only Jay could tell a story about how he was raped by a dolphin. 
[00:23:30]  By a dolphin.  That was a good idea.  You know, the weird thing about Jay Moore is for a guy who's a wrestler, he's a big  pussy, ain't he?  Why?  Well, I mean, last week I thought he backed down at Dice.  It was ridiculously embarrassing that if he didn't say anything to him, he'd call the  cops crying out loud.  You've got to be kidding.  He said some stuff to Dice.  They dealt with it in their own fashion.  It was funny last night because people were still convinced that the Jay Moore Dice thing  was not real, that it was fake, it was a radio thing. 
[00:24:00]  And just before Jay Moore came on, the crowd started kind of quietly chanting Dice.  Yeah, a few people were saying that.  Dice.  They thought he was going to come out.  They were just expecting that that's the grand finale, that Dice was going to be at  the Beacon show last night, but he was not there.  And I'm happy to report, we talked to Jay Moore backstage and the Jay Moore Dice fight  is over.  Yeah, I think there was a summit of sorts.  They spoke and cleared everything.  And neither one of them wants to go on the air and talk about it, but they did clear their 
[00:24:30]  differences in private.  Yeah.  So that's where we are today.  Wow.  All right, Andy.  You won't see any bombs being dropped on that front.  The comedy war.  The coalition of comedians all lined up.  Right.  Hey, what was going on with Stalker Patty last night?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  She's out of her mind.  All I know, she was trying to get backstage.  I'm sure she's listening.  So why doesn't she call in? 
[00:25:00]  Because I'm listening.  I'm upstairs.  She was trying to get backstage.  The security was keeping her out.  You know, she didn't have a pass.  No way to get back.  Someone, I think it was Dina Cola, gave her a backstage pass for some reason.  I don't know.  So she gets backstage.  And I guess security again, like, said, hey, you can't come back.  You know, get out.  She's crying.  She started crying. 
[00:25:30]  I thought we were friends.  Why are they throwing me out?  Look at my quivering little thorax and abdomen.  She had a little bag of Godiva chocolate.  Godiva carried all the time with me.  So that way I'm invited back to my aunt hole when I go back because I'm bringing sweets.  What's up?  Give Ben a mic because Ben's a little pissed off today. 
[00:26:00]  Sometimes they turn on you if you come back empty handed to the hole without some chocolate.  They love good sleep.  Update from the courtyard in front of the building.  She's downstairs crying.  Matt just saw her.  She's downstairs crying?  Get her up here.  Is she completely lost her, what little brain she has in her head?  Someone go get stalker Patty.  I got my antenna stuck in a little stick and I pulled and pulled and it hurt my head. 
[00:26:30]  She thinks she works with us now.  It's out of control.  She just thinks that she, you know.  Didn't she say, so who's arranging my transportation to Philly?  Yeah.  Did you really say that?  Yeah.  Yes.  She's out of her mind.  So our underground lair is very large.  We have no tunnels to Philly.  It's very localized.  To me, it's like thousands of miles of tunnels.  But to you people, it's merely a foot or two.  Hey, I'm getting a report from Crazy Paul about Ben.  Crazy Paul.  Yo, man. 
[00:27:00]  Last night, in between the show between Stephen Lynch and when Jay Moore went on,  I brought this chick to hang out and meet a couple of people and Ben was just busting  that poor girl's balls.  She got thrown out of her apartment.  She has no money.  The church is trying to help her.  She's like saying, I don't know if I could make it because I have two weeks' pay coming  Friday and that'll end up to like $180.  So what was Ben saying?  So Ben was just like, I can't even repeat it. 
[00:27:30]  Just doing like, trying to do the mimic of her, like mimicking her voice.  How are you, Patty?  How are you?  Do you have a place to stay?  And Patty's head was like spinning.  There's something wrong with her this time.  I mean, for real.  Oh, boy, I have a place to stay.  They're keeping me in chamber 648B.  Let me tell you guys something.  Ben is pretty quiet, but he's the sickest F on our show.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  He's just a pain in the ass.  The cruelest F.  She's a pain in the ass.  She's on all these hangers on.  She's the most pain in the ass.  She thinks that she should come backstage. 
[00:28:00]  What does she need to come backstage for?  There's nothing going on backstage.  She annoys everyone.  She's a pain in the ass.  She's bothering the security.  The security guard, she tells them she works for us, which is crap.  So the guy's asking me if she works for us.  She's just a loser.  Her little quivering, ant-like body, just not being able to take the rejection.  Here comes Patty.  And that is the nicest guy, but the biggest prick.  Later.  I love you.  And she has the most punchable belly.  It's just pasty, and it pots out a little bit. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Oh, would that feel nice?  Get her in here.  She's right outside.  Where is she?  Just a good sock to the midriff.  Come on, Patty.  Where's sweeping Patty?  Hello?  Come in, Patty.  Why are you crying?  Grab a microphone.  Put the headphones on.  What's the matter, Patty?  Put your headphones on. 
[00:29:00]  Patty.  What's wrong, Patty?  Why are you walking around upset?  There were three black guys.  I told them.  Uh-oh.  Enough said.  All right.  She might be on to something.  That's a joke to all our brothers listeners.  They put me on a pinball machine.  I said, listen, I'm a friend.  The three black guys are the security guys for the building. 
[00:29:30]  I don't know who they are.  And they all have names, and they're nice guys.  I don't know them, but they...  All right.  I said, can you please tell somebody I would like to come up for a few minutes to say hello  to people and hang for a few seconds before I leave?  Did they threaten you with some raid or decon foregone?  No.  They said, I'm sorry, you have to wait outside.  They disappeared for a second and came out.  Ah, so you're thinking they didn't even ask somebody. 
[00:30:00]  No.  How could they do it in one second flat?  You know, you have to go upstairs and find somebody.  Right.  There's no phones to call up.  So then I didn't understand why I wasn't permitted to come up there.  Because you're nobody.  Is it the same kind of not understanding that maybe math has or reading?  No.  Did they throw you out in the middle of it?  I mean, I know I'm not a VIP or an important person or anything like that, but I am a friend,  and you certainly knew me better than half the people that got up there. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, wow.  You know, they didn't mean anything.  Did you just hear that?  No, because Rick's talking to me.  She's not a VIP, she's a VIA.  Very important.  What happened?  Seriously.  She just said, I thought I was a friend, and I'm certainly more well-known, or what was  the word you used?  I don't remember what I said.  I just said, I'm a friend.  Then most of the people that were up there.  I deserve to be up there to say hello.  That's inappropriate.  Watch that language open.  Easy there, Greg.  Don't use that S word. 
[00:31:00]  You know, it seems like I'm nobody important.  Patty, let's back the effing truck up, all right, to last night, first of all, because  I have a problem with you right off the bat.  What the eff did you say to Sandy that made her cry to the point where it completely wrecked  my night?  You stupid bitch.  Wait, I'm sorry.  I thought she knew about this thing I got in the mail, which is not my fault.  Why are you telling my girlfriend anything?  It's none of your effing business. 
[00:31:30]  No, no.  The thing is, I asked that they wanted to say it.  The reason why I didn't tell Sandy was because it was no big deal, and I didn't want to worry  my girlfriend.  You set her off last night.  I'm really sorry.  I didn't mean to do it.  Patty, why are you holding your head like that?  Yeah, because she doesn't like confrontation, and I am pissed off.  Go ahead.  Now tell everyone what you told my girlfriend last night.  Watch this one.  Look, two weeks ago, I got something in the mail that I didn't understand, and I just turned  it in to somebody on the show. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know if I did the right thing or not.  I don't know what this person will do or whoever they are in that state, a villain boy  or whatever, and I kind of got scared because of it.  I'm just wondering if they said anything about it, like if everything's okay, they're going  to, you know...  What was the letter?  What was the letter that was sent to you?  I don't know.  Should I mention it?  It was stupid.  It said...  I don't know who the person is.  They're in Chicago.  This is a person that's probably very cruel, very mean, and wants to hurt people. 
[00:32:30]  So she sent me a letter that said to...  Well, how did you get that information from the letter, which we will say contained Opie's  phone number and address, but how did you get the inkling that there was some...  For the people that are listening, I'll tell everyone, because it's a big effing problem  now.  What happened?  No, someone sent Patty, of all people, my home number and my home address.  Why would they do that?  I have no issues with that. 
[00:33:00]  To Godiva?  Yeah, they must have called about 25 stores before they found me and asked if I worked  there, but didn't want to speak to me.  Right.  And nobody calls you unless they want to speak to you.  So where did you get the idea that this person wanted to hurt somebody?  Because they...  I don't know what they were trying to do.  If they could...  Suppose they called your number and said it was me, and it's not.  I didn't do anything.  It's not about you, Patty.  Well, what did they send it to me for?  What was the reason for doing that? 
[00:33:30]  They're probably a goof.  You're shaking like Michael J. Fox.  Look at you.  So you would call over your blog.  But who would do that?  Who would do that?  Who would take the time to do that?  People like you.  But I don't do things like that.  I'm not that kind of a person.  Patty, are you off the meds?  I don't have anybody in my life.  Are you okay?  You sound a little weird today.  I'm sorry.  Because she doesn't like confrontation.  You're very stressed out.  Hey, Patty, I hate you. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, B.  Now, it's not that bad.  Look at the tears coming out of her big compound eyes.  I've never hurt anybody in my life.  I didn't need to.  Just stay out of my business.  But it was...  It's not even funny anymore.  Stay out of my business.  Now, you're talking to my girlfriend, getting her freaked out about something that really  wasn't a big deal.  But how you explained it to her, it sounded like there was someone with a freaking rifle  waiting outside of my house.  You know, all I know is that I said, did they guess that way? 
[00:34:30]  Just stay out of my life.  All right?  Opie, she's going to kill herself.  I don't give a crap.  Everyone thought this was so funny.  Oh, Starker Patty.  Oh, she stalks Opie.  Please forgive me, Opie.  I didn't mean to.  Okay?  I didn't mean to say anything.  I didn't know what...  You know, I handed in...  How about don't say anything?  But I didn't have that wisdom, I guess, or something.  Well, there you go.  I don't know.  It was bothering me for two weeks because I wonder why I got that.  You've got to go deeper in the hole and talk to the queen aunt and get some wisdom. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, look at Mary just...  Mary just brought Patty a tissue to blow some snot out of her nose.  Oh.  I don't need to hurt anybody.  I'm so sorry.  Hasn't there been enough hurt in the city, Patty?  Oh, play that sad walking away song from The Incredible Hulk.  Yeah?  Would you like to apologize?  I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way. 
[00:35:30]  I apologize.  Okay?  It wasn't meant to be that.  Who are you talking to?  Oh, Jesus.  You're horrible.  I'm talking to you.  I don't want to hear it.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you tap him on the head with your antennae?  Maybe you can communicate better that way.  How's your thorax?  I don't need to hurt anybody.  Oh, Patty.  Okay?  I think you were just a little naive.  Maybe I am naive.  Just stay out of my life, okay? 
[00:36:00]  It doesn't matter what the person's intent was.  It just seems like there's a nut job that wants to show, hey, look what I know.  But who cares?  There wasn't any threats made or anything, Patty.  So when Sandy, when you told Sandy that last night, you made it sound like it was more than the phone number and address.  That maybe there were some threats made.  You know what I mean?  So Sandy got all upset.  And now you're all upset.  I was fearing that the person would do something else and do something further or whatever. 
[00:36:30]  Kick over the ant's help.  They don't know me and they sent this to me.  All I know is a little sunshine in a magnifying glass and my whole village is gone.  Did I do the right thing by handing it in?  Dennis, what's up?  I'm good.  Oh, you're such a dick, bro.  Leave her alone.  He's got enough nightmares of big shoes stepping on her in her dreams.  Leave her alone.  All right, all right.  Billy, what's up? 
[00:37:00]  Yo, can't you give us a break?  Bring her backstage for one minute.  You want to break for boobs?  Well, a lot of people are getting mad now because Patty wasn't...  Give her a break.  She brings in all these weddings for you.  Do we expect you to show us?  She brings in all these letters.  That's the problem.  And let Opie face it, man.  You like having her around you.  No, I don't.  You do, too.  You're such a whiny fake.  Ben.  I never heard any funny.  It's not like having her around you.  I never heard any goody.  Billy, because it's not funny anymore.  She's getting more and more involved with my life. 
[00:37:30]  Now she's talking to my girlfriend about crap that I didn't need my girlfriend.  Well, you get serious with her then.  Keep away from your girlfriend.  I didn't do anything.  Hey, Patty.  Stay away from Mopi's girlfriend.  You're a nice girl, but that's it.  Patty, you sound like old Mr. Hunnalee.  Bruce, what's going on?  Hey, man, why don't you back off of her for a while?  I didn't know I was going to.  Why don't you back off?  What are you guys?  Big shots now?  Are you going to start pushing little people around?  Bruce, she...  Why don't you back off for a while?  For what?  She got a letter.  Was it her fault that she got the letter? 
[00:38:00]  She thought she was doing the right thing.  That's not the point here.  The point is that...  Bruce, she did not do the right thing, okay?  She's getting more and more involved in our lives.  She's not getting involved in your life.  She got a letter with your address and your phone number.  You don't even know.  Okay?  Your address and your phone number, and now you're jamming it down her throat  because you thought she did that on purpose.  She didn't do it on purpose.  Bruce, that's not what we're getting at here.  She should just mind her own business.  Yeah, but she needs friends.  Don't you see that's obvious? 
[00:38:30]  Bruce, give your address out.  I'll send her over right now.  I'll give my address out.  57 West, wherever you guys are.  No, give out your address.  She needs friends.  She'll give it out over the radio.  She'll be there in an hour, pal.  And she'll never leave.  She wouldn't come down this far.  She can't travel.  You should see what she could do.  I didn't know.  I was still...  But, you know, she's got a problem.  You know what I'm saying?  I thought...  I know it's funny, but it doesn't get funny after a while, you know?  It's not funny, Bruce.  This is serious crap.  I'm really pissed off. 
[00:39:00]  My girl was in, you know, completely losing it last night over something that was really  not a big deal that Patty blew out of proportion.  And it's always something with Patty.  She thought somebody was trying to get after you.  I don't care.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't know how it works out.  I didn't...  Thank you, Bruce.  I didn't know I was doing the wrong thing.  JR, what's up?  Guys, listen.  I had no idea.  Just save the program.  Get her to the nearest tall building.  I'll scream, jump, step on her.  Get rid of her, this crazy bitch. 
[00:39:30]  She's no rating.  She's a loser.  Well, there's a...  I didn't know I was doing the wrong thing.  Yo, you guys better be careful, man.  Why?  Because Patty can carry 50 times her own weight.  That's right.  I carry big bald as big as my head.  I was not aware that she didn't know about it.  I thought everybody knew about it.  Patty, I stopped listening to you four minutes ago.  Will you shut up?  Okay.  I thought everybody knew about it.  If I was aware that it wasn't known about, I wouldn't have mentioned it. 
[00:40:00]  It's like...  All right?  But I was aware that I thought that everybody knew about it.  I had a pass to get backstage last night, but it slipped right over my whole body.  Yeah, who gave you the pass for backstage last night?  Mike was trying to be nice.  No, he wasn't.  He said, go ahead.  He was trying to be a wise...  He thought it was funny.  He was messing with you is what he was trying to do.  And why are you crying at the backstage door?  Because my feelings were hurt. 
[00:40:30]  But why do you deserve to be back there, Patty?  You don't work with us.  You don't...  You think you're like friends with Jay Moore and Steven Lee, you know?  But I know them.  I'm not...  And now I'm out of my mind, and everyone's giving me a huge hard time on the instant feedback  on the phones.  You guys don't understand.  I apologize.  Everyone thought it would be funny to have Stalker Patty around.  I even feel bad.  As much as Patty really deserves a good punch in the midriff, I feel bad for her.  Patty, we thought you might get stepped on back there.  You might get stepped on.  You know what I mean? 
[00:41:00]  Brian, what's up?  A lot of big people with big shoes.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, not much.  Hey, I got some...  I got a problem for all you...  I can't even talk.  I got a cure for all your problems on the show today.  Yeah.  It's a big can of Raid, man.  It'll take care of Patty in a heartbeat.  Right.  Extra strength, baby.  Oh, stupid.  All right, thank you.  Big Will, what's up?  Aubrey, what's up?  Hey.  For the first time, I'll call it.  Stick up to you.  Oh, thanks.  You got all the right, man.  She's getting a little too personal here, brother. 
[00:41:30]  Patty, why don't you go back up to your aunt home,  grow up in a little barn, and die?  Look, don't be telling...  Because I think Patty might actually take your own life.  You wouldn't try to take your own life, would you, Patty?  No.  That's a sin.  Don't ever do that.  So, Patty...  Oh, come on.  Let's go.  Thanks, Big Will.  I apologize.  Patty, so take us through it.  Like, you're sitting there, we're all having fun at the show,  and then you approach Sandy, and what do you say to her?  Well, I said, what did they say about the letter that I sent down to them 
[00:42:00]  that I got a week, like two weeks ago?  Yeah.  You know, what happened with that?  Because I would like to know, you know?  Nobody got back to me about that.  And, of course, Sandy goes, what letter?  And then you...  And then I said, what did I say?  I said, okay, last week, you know, somebody called G'day,  but that I just started at, it's a new job, part-time job,  and somebody called there and asking if I worked there,  and before, you know, they asked if they want, you know, 
[00:42:30]  she said she didn't want to speak to me, and click, you know, I hung up.  And then over the weekend, somebody handed me a letter mailed to the store,  and it was weird.  It had the address and phone number and some photo or something of Opie,  and I got upset by it, and I just handed it into the show.  Did I do the right thing?  You know?  Did you have to cross a puddle, and you and the rest of the colony  actually link your bodies so the rest of the colony can transport the letter?  No? 
[00:43:00]  No.  All I know is I said, I just want to know if I did the right thing.  John, what's up?  I'm not okay with that.  Yeah, I'm sick and tired of hearing her complain.  I mean, give it a break.  You say the same damn thing over and over and over again.  It's over.  You screwed up.  Patty, here you go.  You're right.  You're right.  You're like, Patty's wrong.  All right, John.  Patty, here you go.  This is the deal.  You giving the letter that you received to someone from the show was great.  That's what you should have done.  Because I didn't know the person was going to do anything. 
[00:43:30]  Zip it.  Zip it.  Zip it.  Zip it good.  No.  That's fine.  You giving the letter.  That good, Patty.  Did good.  Patty good.  Did good.  The then telling Sandy about it, that's somewhere maybe you should have hung back and not have  gotten involved in that aspect of the letter.  That Patty bad.  Patty bad.  Bad Patty.  Bad Patty bad.  Good Patty good.  Give letter.  Bad Patty bad.  Tell Sandy bad. 
[00:44:00]  Bad.  I made a mistake.  Right.  She's acknowledging the error of her ways.  You did one thing good.  One thing good.  One thing bad.  One thing good, Patty good.  One thing bad, Patty bad.  And so why are you here today?  That brings us to today.  Were you outside in the courtyard of this building weeping openly?  Yeah, because of the way those men were treating me.  The black men.  Are we back to the black men again?  Yeah.  They treated me like I was a criminal or something. 
[00:44:30]  What?  Well, there's shoes on the other foot there.  Patty, the city is in what's called a lockdown.  Do you get it?  You look like a terror.  No, I'm kidding.  They're only allowing people up that have IDs.  Patty, do they touch you in your notice spot?  I asked if in a nice way, can I go up and say hello?  They know me.  The answer is no, because you don't work here.  But what about all those other people that were up there?  Who were they?  They were.  Oh, my God.  See? 
[00:45:00]  Patty.  Patty.  No, I'll explain it.  Hold on.  Patty.  They're a whack job.  You know what they are?  Patty, they were people that were with Jay.  They were people that were photographers.  There are other people.  It wasn't our show.  This wasn't an Opie and Anthony Roadshow.  This was us hosting an event that Jay Moore put together.  No, we're talking about downstairs.  Okay.  Oh, no, I know.  I think she's...  Are you talking about downstairs or backstage?  Downstairs.  Yeah.  You know, the way the guys...  Oh, I was talking about the show last night.  No, downstairs, because they won't let her up. 
[00:45:30]  And then who's...  Who are you talking about?  Who are the other guys that are here?  What do you mean?  You just said...  I just said...  You know, the three men that were downstairs.  There's a big gap in that synapse.  It's not just not sparking.  Well, I don't know.  I just...  You said...  You need those gaps.  Gapped.  I said, all right, listen, let's back up.  I said, you know, they wouldn't let you upstairs because you don't work here.  And you said, well, then who are those other guys that are up here?  People, there were some people going up that were in the audience and I thought, you know... 
[00:46:00]  Now she's talking about backstage again.  It was at the end.  You're not talking about this building, are you?  No.  You're talking...  I'm talking about there at the end.  And they sang songs like Old Yellowstain and...  You know, what...  Wow.  Wow.  Holy Cain mutiny reference.  Sure.  Old Yellowstain.  I know.  How many portions of strawberry did you have?  How many portions? 
[00:46:30]  It was a key.  I knew there was a key.  It was a key.  And they made a copy of the key.  They sang Old Yellowstain.  I didn't cut the toe line.  I think Fred McMurray set her up.  Patty, why should it be any of your business who the other people are that are going upstairs?  Yellowstain blues.  I'm sorry, I know it's none of my business what the names were, but I couldn't understand why I wasn't.  Patty, maybe it was Jay Moore's brothers or something.  It's none of your business why those guys got up.  Yeah, it really falls into the category that it really doesn't concern you who is going backstage. 
[00:47:00]  If security felt for some reason that you shouldn't have been back there, then they were doing their job.  It's not our show.  It's not our show.  It was Jay's show.  Jay handed us passes to get us back there.  We couldn't get in unless we had passes.  They make sure everything is, like L.P. said, the city's very paranoid these days.  And security, even at an event like this, which was a charity event for firemen, the security's a little stronger than it used to be. 
[00:47:30]  So you had to understand if they said no, it meant no.  That's all.  You know, you enjoyed the show.  Did you enjoy the show?  Yes, I did.  Did you pay for the tickets?  Yes, I did.  You did?  Yes.  How did that happen?  Usually you get a freebie.  Those are expensive.  Well, I paid.  Well, that's good, because it goes to a good cause.  I know.  It goes to a good cause.  How do you get the money to pay for the tickets?  Yeah.  Did they give you a two-month advance?  I just gave up a couple things.  A couple, like food and clothing.  Like a place to live, right? 
[00:48:00]  Because now you don't have a place to live.  Well, I'm seeing a place tonight, and I have to.  So instead of paying your rent, you bought a ticket to Jay Morris.  Is that what you did?  Because I really wanted to see it.  I never did.  Rick would have gave you a ticket.  Somebody around here would have gave you a ticket.  Patty, you would have gotten a freebie.  Take it.  You're a lunatic.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes I'm so excited.  Don't be sorry.  It's like, you know, Patty, you have to concentrate on taking care of yourself.  Yes.  You really do.  You're a very functional retard.  You've got to take care of yourself, Patty. 
[00:48:30]  I'm not even going to deal with it.  I've had enough psychopaths in my life.  Just, ugh.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  If it means cutting corners.  You're just going to waste your time.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, because there's some problem.  It's like when you go to your dog, and you go, hi, boy.  You're a good boy.  And he's just hearing, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Is that what you're hearing?  Is this sinking in at all, Patty?  Do you think it's normal to not pay your rent so you can go to a comedy show?  That's a little crazy, Patty.  Especially to see Jay Moore. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  Well, no.  I didn't use rent money.  You know, I just had the $20.  The reason you're not living where you were is because you can't afford to live there anymore, right?  Well, it was $600.  Well, that's a story in itself.  It was an illegal rental, and I didn't know about it until the landlord downstairs confronted me about the two people I was renting the room for.  You're a criminal, Patty.  It was $500 to $625 a month, depending on whether there were four or five weeks, and I found out the rent was only $600. 
[00:49:30]  They got in trouble, and I had to move out.  Oof.  I have no idea what the hell she just talked about.  Keith, what's up?  You couldn't move into the lava room?  The pupa room?  I have a place to go see tonight.  Yeah?  You guys are just brutal.  Wow.  The two of you are sitting there hammering on this girl.  Hammering?  What, you don't think?  You know she's not stable.  And Opie, if you were serious, if you didn't want to deal with her every day, you would take her when she's off the show, not turn it into a bit, and tell her, listen, we don't want you here anymore. 
[00:50:00]  I don't want you involved in my life.  But you turn it into a bit, and then you play Mr. Tough Guy on the radio.  I don't want you.  Leave me alone.  Dude, tell her off the air.  Tell her, make it serious.  That'll be the big dirty language.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on, Keith.  Hold on, Keith.  Watch the language.  You can do it, though, can't you?  Watch the language.  You think he's foul language?  No, Keith, because it's so much more involved than that, you don't even understand.  This girl hangs outside the building every single day, always has an excuse why she's outside the building, inside the building. 
[00:50:30]  And you never take her off the air and take her into the air.  I don't want to have any relationship with this girl.  He thinks it's a bitch.  Patty, hold on.  Shut up!  There he goes, Mr. Tough Guy again.  Shut the F up, and I'll explain, you ass.  I don't acknowledge this girl off the air.  And she knows it.  She keeps coming back.  She knows it.  I do not talk to her.  She tries to talk to me.  I nod, and I walk away.  I don't want to be in a relationship with this girl at all. 
[00:51:00]  I don't want to be her friend.  I don't want to be her lover.  I don't want her to be a fan of this show.  I don't want anything to do with her.  And off the air, that's how I play it, and always have.  Ben, Rick, and anyone else will back me up.  Now she's starting to mess with my girlfriend and getting involved with my relationship.  I am sick of it, Keith.  It's not funny anymore.  Now you've got to do it off here.  You've got to pull it off.  Have somebody else do it.  No, because I don't ask anyone here. 
[00:51:30]  Russell Inbaugh is calling.  He said, Opie, you're being too loud.  I do not talk to the girl off the air.  That is a fact.  I want to have Anthony do it.  Have Mr. Funny Man over there.  Pull her aside and listen.  You're not welcome here anymore.  Don't come back.  Hey, Keith.  Keith, do some research on stalkers.  And then get back to me.  If you keep letting her on, obviously she's going to keep coming back.  Hey, Keith, here's my take on this whole thing.  I don't care if Patty goes to events just like any other listener wants to go to and stuff like that. 
[00:52:00]  It's just if she's getting herself all upset because she can't then go backstage or go to some of these road shows and stuff,  then she's making her own problem here.  Yeah, but you're saying it's okay for her to come to these things to be with you guys.  That's like saying she's a little bit pregnant.  If you don't want her there, she shouldn't be anywhere near you guys.  There are certain things, Keith, there are certain things that it's fine for Patty to show up at.  There are other times that she's got to realize that some things she can't be part of. 
[00:52:30]  And there are things she's got to realize that, like I said before, handing over the letter to someone on the show, Patty, good.  Talking to Opie's girlfriend, Patty, bad.  You know, I'm trying to, this isn't a black and white situation.  Yeah, but Opie doesn't want her about at all if she thinks it's okay.  By coming to these other things, she thinks by you letting her on the air to come up there and do this,  what you're doing now, she thinks she can do it again.  If you don't deal with her at all, coming to the show, coming to this, you tell her she's not allowed to, 
[00:53:00]  this might end.  But you guys, guys, bring it on yourself.  Well, you know, and you know, the way you're talking to her, she's going to do something to herself and it's going to be your fault when it happens.  I don't give a crap.  Obviously.  I've had enough crazy people in my life.  I am sick of dealing with crazy people.  Can I interject?  I swear to God, man.  You guys, you turn everything into a bit and something's really going to turn out, you know, horrible here. 
[00:53:30]  And you turn it into a bit and you know you don't care.  That's fine.  But, you know, one says, oh, it's okay for her to come to something.  And you know, but you don't want her there.  Keith, Keith, let me tell you the God's honest truth, okay?  I was kind of fine with everything because I don't deal with Patty off the air ever, okay?  But last night, it escalated to that next level where now she's dealing with, you know, people close to me.  Now that's where I'm completely pissed and I've had it. 
[00:54:00]  I'm not disagreeing with you.  All right.  Screwed up in the head.  Before then, listen, hear me out because now I'm not going to scream and I'll discuss this with you.  Before that, like you said, yeah, it was a radio bit.  Here's a stalker that's hanging outside the building.  What the hell, let's have her on the show.  We've got some good radio out of her.  Sure, she comes to some of the events.  Because a bunch of people have seen Patty on stage where Ann thinks it's cute to bring her up because she's my stalker and have her kiss me in front of 2,500 people.  Even that, I'm like, all right, that's funny.  But now it's getting to the point where she's now involved with people around me that I have to draw the line. 
[00:54:30]  And I've tried it.  Yeah, I agree with you 100%.  But now you have to do something about it.  It's up to you to stop it.  Bringing her on the air isn't doing it.  Last night is when you should have realized that bringing her on the air today is only going to make it worse.  If you do it personally, get a effing restraining order.  Keith, the mics will go off soon, okay?  When we take a break, I will not even acknowledge that she's in the studio.  And that's how I've played it for a long time. 
[00:55:00]  That's sticking your head in the sand.  Yeah, that's real good.  So she's going to be back.  Look, look, I apologize that there was a misunderstanding.  Patty, are you getting the point here?  Did you figure it out?  I apologize that I made an error in judgment.  It's our fault for allowing her to get so close.  Exactly.  Because she can't.  Now, Patty, you've got to figure it out.  She doesn't understand the difference between a radio show and reality.  Patty.  Hey, Patty, do you understand what's going on here? 
[00:55:30]  Don't come back.  They don't want you there.  They don't want you involved with anybody that's involved with the show.  They don't want to be involved with you.  Why can't you understand that?  But I'm no harm to anybody.  It doesn't matter whether you're harm or not.  They just don't want you there.  Neither is a benign tumor.  I would never do anything to hurt anybody in any way.  If I, you know, if I had been aware that no one knew about it, I would not have said anything.  I would have had a better judgment, you know?  Wait, hold, Patty.  Can I make a point?  I apologize. 
[00:56:00]  Here's the thing some people are missing.  I didn't mean it.  It's like, as a listener, Patty gets, like, air time.  And she does get backstage for some events and comp tickets.  And we don't run with tickets and stuff.  Hold on.  No, no.  And I'm saying, like, the once in a while when she can't get back, she can't just get pissed off and sulk.  Because you get back more than most people.  It's almost like this.  Let me use an analogy that I learned.  Right?  It's like if you have a dog.  And I don't mean this in a bad way.  And you're constantly putting doggy treat on your junk.  It will come at her and lick the treat off.  There's something wrong with you, Jordan.  I'm just making an analogy.  This is how my father explains things to me. 
[00:56:30]  And this is how I'm trying to pass it on to you.  Then every time you take your junk out, the dog will expect to have a treat on it.  And when there is no treat on your junk, the doggy will be disappointed.  Were you the dog in that relationship, Norton?  I really was.  Except I had to wear Mickey Mouse ears.  We didn't have dog ears.  Did you eat things off of your father's junk, Norton?  Were you the dog in that relationship?  All right, Keith.  Gentlemen, yeah.  Keith, I'm just doing it for your own good, guys.  You're going to put yourself in a bad position.  Well, Keith, I apologize for yelling at you.  But I don't know what else to do. 
[00:57:00]  You've got to do it off the air, man.  No, I'm not going to talk to her.  But you're going to have somebody else do it then.  But you've got to do it because she thinks it's okay.  All right.  Thank you, Keith.  Guys, have a great show.  All right.  Colleen, what's up?  Hey, I just want to call in as a woman.  I have to side with Rosie.  This woman is absolutely psychotic.  Like, you need to just be careful of her.  I think she needs to go get on some meds.  Excuse me, but I don't have a problem like that at all. 
[00:57:30]  I don't mean harm to anyone.  Patty, let's just break it.  What woman in their right mind will get on a national radio show and put up with this crap?  You have to be psychotic.  Patty.  No, I'm not.  Let's put it this way.  How long have you known us?  Three years?  Something like that.  You know that you have given me more cards than my own mom?  And you know who else didn't mean harm to anyone?  Lenny from Of Mice and Men.  He didn't mean harm to anyone.  He just wanted to pet her hair.  Do you know, if you listen to the show and you hear that I had a good crap, you will send a card. 
[00:58:00]  That's a little weird.  A classic case of a stalker.  I'm very happy to hear about your crap.  I hope it was wonderful.  My mom loves giving cards, and you know what?  She can't keep up with you.  I apologize.  I'm a very sensitive person.  If I feel someone did great, I want to say it.  Right.  You know, they have institutions for people like this.  All right.  That's all I mean by it.  Dear aunt number 6,433,009, you carried that cricket leg longer than you should have. 
[00:58:30]  What a great job you did.  You know, but anyway.  Bea, what's up?  Bea?  Yeah, I do.  Hey, Bea.  Hey, listen.  Patty?  What?  Are you there?  Yes, I am.  Okay, I can barely hear you.  Do me a favor, from one self-respecting woman to another woman, give Opie the finger, stand  up, turn around, and never give him the talking ass out of the whole radio station. 
[00:59:00]  No, he's just angry because I made him sick.  Bea, Bea, Bea, Bea.  Oh, God, listen to battered woman syndrome.  Bea, Bea, Bea, he's just angry because I made a mistake.  I walked into a door.  He chained her to the radiator, too.  No.  When you're angry, you're the first time.  How long have you been listening to the show?  I started listening when you guys started talking about, you know, Bin Laden because I thought  you were doing it very well. 
[00:59:30]  Ah.  And the last few times, like with Andrew Dice Clay, I hate that man.  And the way you guys treated him, I was like, he was apologizing to Jay Moore and the jackass  was like, well, I just can't find it within my heart.  I've been getting so pissed off at you guys.  You've been using your radio show.  Don't be, you stink.  Up yourself.  Shut up, stupid.  Don't listen anymore.  God almighty.  Put on the C-Network and listen to that.  Well, you know, I turned out today because guess what?  We're blowing up Afghanistan.  That's right. 
[01:00:00]  So tie that in with a stalker patty comment, you dummy.  We're blowing up country.  Shut up, stupid.  Go back to Mayberry and get stomach cancer.  You stink.  Oh, God.  I'm dead.  Just tell it one self-respecting woman who listens to a show she doesn't like.  Die.  Oh, good.  While we're blowing up people.  While we're blowing up people.  Don't try to be emotionally manipulative, you dullard.  This is a comedy show.  Shut up.  Don't try to make a poignant statement, you ass.  Oh, yeah, but you wouldn't understand it, you idiot.  I wouldn't understand. 
[01:00:30]  Just keep filleting your husband until he works and pays the bills.  You contribute nothing to that household.  Shut up.  I'd probably make more than both of you put together.  And so what?  Good for him.  He has to deal with you.  He deserves all the money he can make.  She has to tolerate your self-righteous nonsense.  Who am I talking to?  Am I talking to Snortin' Norton?  Yes, you are.  That was very clever of you.  Okay.  B, waka waka.  She's here all week.  Drive the veal.  Shut up.  B, bye.  Bye, B. 
[01:01:00]  I'm not hanging up.  Daddy, get up and leave.  I'm not hanging up.  You're really self-respecting.  I'm not hanging up.  I'm just going to get yelled at.  Wow, you have a lot of self-esteem.  That's really good.  No, I'm trying to save another woman who's in our distress over there.  Oh, you stop with your rescue mission.  Taking advantage of the mentally ill.  That's cool.  And look who we're talking to.  Shut your yap.  Hey, B.  Okay, Snortin' Snortin' Snortin'.  Snortin' Snortin' Snortin' Snortin'.  You talk like foghorn leghorn.  Shut up.  People enjoy the Neil Diamond impression.  Oh, yeah.  We really. 
[01:01:30]  And just like the O.J. Simpson thing.  That was really mean.  People love O.J.  You guys did a really good job before.  I was very impressed.  And now you're not.  So turn it off and listen to something else.  What the hell are they doing?  You stink.  We let our soft side poke out briefly.  We're back to doing our radio show.  Yeah, B.  If you don't like it, then find another show.  Goodbye, B.  I probably won't be listening anymore, but I just hope Patty is okay.  Hang on.  Don't punch your kids.  Shut up.  Can I ask me something for two seconds?  B.  Hang on, B.  B, did you have a problem with the bombing? 
[01:02:00]  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  No, I was actually with you guys.  When you were calling the Italians the soft-stirmed bastards, I was with you.  When they were not with us.  And that's why I liked it so much.  You said it the way it was, the way it needed to be said.  See, that wasn't our show.  That wasn't our show.  See, but we're saying it like it is today.  Right.  Unfortunately.  You know what?  I mean, I understand.  Hey, B, let me tell you something.  She's mental.  Get her some help.  Do you honestly think that I think that everyone is agreeing with me today?  I look like the biggest dick today. 
[01:02:30]  I know that.  But this is how I feel, and I can't help it.  You know, I understand your position, but maybe you should give her some help.  The phones want to kill me.  And B, stop trying to take care of everyone.  I'm not trying to impress the listeners by saying the right thing.  I am saying what I'm feeling in my heart, okay?  I've had enough mental patients involved with my freaking life.  I've had it.  Can I talk?  I've had it.  Taddy, you shouldn't be there anymore.  Just get up and go.  What is the matter with you? 
[01:03:00]  B is a C.  Go away, Taddy.  Get up and go.  B is a C.  He really is a C.  Don't talk to him anymore.  Why don't you go out and help some homeless people?  Stop trying to rescue everyone and make up for your own inadequacies, you dope.  Leave her alone.  She wants to leave.  She'll leave.  She doesn't need you, the strong woman, calling.  Get up and go, sister.  Shut it.  B likes a D and her A.  She really is.  And a little HIV on her face.  Or Snortin' Norton or whoever the hell you are.  Well, I'm Snortin' Norton, you know, elbow yourself.  I got her good, didn't I, girlfriend?  You sure did.  High five, high five.  The guy's name is Jim Norton. 
[01:03:30]  Where did you get Snortin' Norton from?  Snortin' Norton is the morning guy at 97 Rock in Buffalo, which is an embarrassing show.  Hey, B, shut up, okay?  Shut it.  You obviously don't know the history between Patty and the show.  You're very new to the show.  I understand that.  So maybe you don't have all the facts in front of you.  Okay, I'm just feeling, okay.  Hang up.  How's this?  How's this?  Hang up.  I feel bad for you.  I feel bad for her.  Hang up.  Are you a Buffalo Betty?  Who don't you feel bad for in the world?  Stop it already.  Stop it.  You know, Kathy, compassion. 
[01:04:00]  I feel bad for your husband.  Oh, a big heart and probably your big hips, too.  Shut up.  Oh, hell no.  I'm quite thin.  Oh, really?  Nice.  You're not a Buffalo Betty, then?  No, not a Buffalo Betty.  Do you have a nice rack, if I could ask, in the middle of this argument?  No, I don't have that in the middle of this argument.  What does Patty want to say?  I want to talk.  All right.  She's got a statement to make.  Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.  I'm sorry I made an error.  Oh, we're crying out loud, Patty.  There's no helping you.  Just cheating up at all. 
[01:04:30]  This B sure is right, isn't she?  I'm trying to apologize, because people misunderstand me a lot.  B could hang up.  Yeah.  We loved you in Fargo.  Goodbye.  B, hang up, all right?  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  I thought you said you weren't hanging out.  You're a liar.  You know, it's just that I was simply misunderstood.  I didn't intend any...  Yeah, so was Hitler.  Exactly.  I didn't mean to upset somebody.  I didn't even expect it.  I thought it was known, okay? 
[01:05:00]  I thought she knew about it.  I thought you told her.  I didn't know.  Anthony, we're going to take a break.  All right, Opie.  And when we come back, we'll continue the mess.  Steve Bullock's coming in the studio.  Were you saying something, Patty?  No, I was just...  I didn't think so.  Colin Quinn in the studio in about 15 minutes.  Snoop Doggy Dog calling in in about an hour.  And more of your phone calls.  I'm hiding.  I'm just trying to apologize.  You guys have redefined debauchery.

It's our first day on in Las Vegas.  We sound a little different than this, usually. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  This is some first, yeah, show that we have.  Now, people want to kill me, right?  Yeah.  And you've got to explain.  Nothing phases this girl.  Now, after everything you heard take place, the abuse, the crying, Patty, the second we  got off the air for commercials, we went out to play foosball, me and Norton, we're  playing foosball, and Patty is standing right by the foosball table, just, so do you enjoy 
[01:07:30]  your foosball table?  Like, not even phased by anything.  Like, it never happened.  So, I got one question.  Can I still come to Philly?  That's what she said.  I go, Patty, slow down.  Slow down.  I got a question.  Are we going to do Stonehenge tonight?  No, we're not going to effing do Stonehenge. 
[01:08:00]  Can I live in the foosball table?  I'm an aunt, so it's like a palace.  Patty, what's going on?  Hi.  It's another Patty, thank God.  Patty!  Hey, guys, how you doing?  How are you?  Good, hey, and I'll be, um, great with you.  I've been stalked, I know what it's like, and you can't explain to people the kind of  aggravation and crap you have to deal with, but...  Hell, I did it to myself.  I'll be the first to admit it. 
[01:08:30]  She's outside the studio.  I mean, we can't even get her off the floor.  Oh, what?  Someone, someone, get her in here for a second.  Patty, your phone stinks.  Call back when you have a better cell, all right?  Stalker.  Do you think Patty's an actual stalker, though?  Ben?  Yes.  Help me out.  Thank you.  Okay.  She's...  Every morning, I have to...  I've got a plan set in order, so I don't have to...  I can avoid her on the way in every morning, you know?  It's like, oh, hello, how are you? 
[01:09:00]  Let's talk about the show.  She started taking the same train as me.  I go that way.  Oh, there you go, Patty.  No, you don't go that way.  All of a sudden, you're on the train with me.  I take the W.  But how?  When was the last time I was on the train with you?  I switched lines, so the answer would be about a month now.  Ooh.  Mm.  It was just...  All of a sudden, she's hanging out.  Oh, I didn't know you took this train.  It was a coincidence.  Everything's a coincidence with you.  And why are you still here? 
[01:09:30]  Why are you still here?  Put the little magic things on your ears.  Put the magic headphone things on.  Why are you still here?  Why are you still here?  Why are you still here?  Why are you...  Ben, help me out.  Look at her.  She gets all weird, man.  Patty, you got to calm down.  Yeah.  Hey, Patty, can you just go jump into a river of anthrax? 
[01:10:00]  I think I was trying to say before.  246.  You know, I apologize.  Holy Jesus.  That's classic.  I apologize if I made a mistake.  How come your hands start going like Joe Cocker when you get upset?  So, what were you apologizing?  I made a mistake in judgment.  Patty, this is your...  No.  Patty, this is your exit music. 
[01:10:30]  Turn and walk away.  In a very special wee movie presentation.  You know, I...  Patty, a life.  Take your headphones off.  This is your exit music.  I've never done anything wrong to anybody.  I've been a fan of the show for three years.  A lifetime exclusive.  Walker, I'm...  I'm just taking my break.  I'm taking my break.  I like to sit there when I take my break. 
[01:11:00]  Portrait of a middle-aged virgin retard.  I...  Join a very special cast for a very special movie.  I'm sorry I misunderstood last night.  I just took it too personally.  That's all.  I should have understood.  Don't get me angry.  You don't like me.  You don't like me.  I'm angry.  Patty, just walk away.  This is your exit music.  I'm looking like the Hulk.  You don't mean that.  Just walk away.  Take your headphones off. 
[01:11:30]  You don't mean that.  Turn around and...  Please don't mean that.  Take the long walk down the hall.  Leave the fuel.  You will be safe.  Just walk away.  Just walk away, Patty.  Just walk away.  Isn't it possible...  Into the cold Manhattan afternoon.  Can't we be a little nicer to bundle flight?  Can you forgive me?  Oh, God.  The patterned woman syndrome.  It's a nice, crisp fall day. 
[01:12:00]  Walk out into the darkness of the streets of Manhattan.  I don't bother running.  Alone.  Alone.  Alone.  Patty, this is your exit music.  Walk away, Patty.  Walk away.  I...  Like David Banner.  Or like Cain in Kung Fu.  The end of the episode.  No matter who they met and who they befriended.  The end of the episode comes.  They're always what?  Alone.  Walking to the next town.  Like Bill Bixby. 
[01:12:30]  Like Bill Bixby.  Yes, David Banner.  Or like The Fugitive.  Still searching for the one-armed man.  That killed his wife in trying to clear his name.  Your final words before you take that long walk down the hall.  Your mom's books.  Please.  I'm just asking you to forgive me.  What?  Forgive me.  I had no intention of any harm.  What?  I had no intention of any harm.  I didn't mean to hurt anybody. 
[01:13:00]  What?  I don't want to lose anybody's friendship.  The music's too loud.  What?  I didn't mean any harm.  You know, I love this show.  I love everybody.  I've never heard anyone.  Anthony, I got Patty's final words.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I'm sorry to Sandy, too.  I didn't mean to be gross.  We want your D-O-R.  You know, I'm sorry. 
[01:13:30]  I didn't know.  I went over with the idea that she knew about it.  And she didn't know about it, and I was not aware of it.  All right.  Rush Limbaugh's checking in.  He says, thank God I'm deaf.  I handed it in.  I didn't hear anything for about a week.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Patty, it's time to take the walk.  Here it is.  The slow turn toward the door.  Toward the door.  Do we have U2's Walk On? 
[01:14:00]  Do you want to walk out on it?  As we play U2's Walk On?  We'll play Walk On, and you can walk on.  Thank you, Jim, for Manhattan checking in with that one.  Patty, what's your first stop?  Fetal position in a shower?  No.  Thank you, Ed from Brooklyn.  No.  God, that's great.  I really am sorry.  She will not leave.  No, I really am sorry.  Patty, just leave.  I did not mean to.  Would you be willing to take the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge? 
[01:14:30]  Here it is, Patty.  Here you go, Patty.  Patty, walk on.  Time to leave.  This is a song about moving on with things.  That's the edge.  I love the edge.  Oh, thank you.  I apologize.  I'm really sorry.  Fuck.  I'm really sorry.  Walk on, Patty.  I didn't.  Walk on.  Yeah?  Sorry.  Look at her shaking.  Your apology has fallen on Rush Limbaugh's ears. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, God.  That's fine.  Patty.  Yeah.  What?  What?  What?  No.  I made one major one, and my T-cell count shows it.  Okay.  It only takes one mistake.  Yeah.  But I didn't even know it was a mistake.  I didn't have any idea.  I'm sorry.  Patty.  I had no idea.  Patty, we've got a radio show to do.  No one wants to hear this crap.  Now you're wrecking the radio show. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Patty, here it comes.  And just, you could walk on to U2 as you leave this program.  Here it is.  Walk on!  Walk on!  Walk on!  Walk on!  Walk on, Patty.  Let go!  There you go. 
[01:16:00]  What do you say?  You're back in a suitcase for...  Um, you're still here.  You're supposed to walk on during that song.  Your lips quivering.  I know.  Patty, not for nothing, but ever since...  Look at her.  Woody Allen did your...  Nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Did she just slam that door?  That was Ben.  Ben.  Wow.  Can you believe that? 
[01:16:30]  That was a little sad.  Yeah.  A little.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I mean, it'd be nice if we threw B out of the studio.  What?  I hate this place.  The medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  Wow.  I think she took that quite well.  What is she doing?  Dude, this is awful. 
[01:17:00]  What is she doing?  Oh, now she's crying.  Is she just weeping now?  What?  That's horrible.  Mary had to walk her to the bathroom.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Mary walked into the bathroom?  With her arm around her, comforting her.  Comforting her.  See, this is what she wanted.  Now we have to bring her back because we look like idiots.  And we have to say, it's okay.  Don't cry.  I can't even say it.  It's slightly manipulative.  God, do I stink.  It's slightly manipulative on her part.  But as a retarded girl, you've got to give her leeway.  I'm actually sad about that. 
[01:17:30]  I'm not even being.  I'm really, I'm like, ugh.  Now we've got to invite her back in.  See what she does?  You can't let her leave crying like that.  Why not?  Why not?  Kimmy from Full House took her to the bathroom.  Kimmy Gibbler.  Kimmy Gibbler.  All right.  Can you get her back in now?  No.  We really have a show to do here.  You know what would be great if Mr. Carlson...  Stinky, you're a sick ep, by the way.  Why's that?  You're clapping and laughing.  Oh, this is the greatest.  She hasn't stopped crying for a while now. 
[01:18:00]  She's not coming out?  Can we put a big, can we put a big bucket of pig blood over the door so when she walks  in and dumps on her?  They're all going to laugh at you.  They're all going to laugh at you.  Rick, Rick, grab a mic and go into the bathroom with Patty.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  I'm just pilfering everyone's good lines off of instant feedback today.  Here, Patty.  Oh, Christ.  Here she comes.  Is she quivering crying?  Oh, yeah.  Ooh.  She is? 
[01:18:30]  Come on, stop laughing.  Patty, come here.  Is that her crying?  She's laughing.  She's laughing.  She's laughing and crying.  That's totally normal.  Patty, come here.  You nutty fruitcake, you.  Here we go.  Patty, what are you...  You're like a crazy person.  Why are you crying like this?  Jesus.  Cheswick handled things better.  Patty!  I'm trying to say I'm sorry.  You know, Patty.  I'm trying to say I'm sorry. 
[01:19:00]  This is horrible.  I want to apologize to Vegas.  This is their first impression of us, Patty.  They've seen this in every casino.  Yeah.  Picture.  Picture.  All right.  That's a great thought you got there, Norton.  Just picture the guy that just dumped his whole friggin' load.  I was kidding.  I thought I...  I doubled down! 
[01:19:30]  I was kidding.  I was only kidding.  I was only kidding.  Give her a quail or she'll let me in the morning.  Scott, what's up?  You know, guys, she's crying now, but it's not going to be funny tomorrow when she hijacks  a butterfly and flies into the side of the studio door.  I could do that.  Oh, man.  Now, now, now.  She's crying.  I bet she's the one that did Manny.  What?  Patty.  Oh, you got to pull yourself together.  You all right?  You need some Penderball or something? 
[01:20:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What kind of narcotics you need?  Are you going to say goodbye to me, Mac?  I'm just trying to say I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  So sorry.  I'm cozy.  Patty.  Patty, stop it.  Stop your crying.  I'm just trying to say I'm sorry.  We realize.  We've heard your apology.  And everything's fine.  Stop crying, girl.  You're like a crazy woman now. 
[01:20:30]  I'm not crazy.  I'm just obsessed.  That's all.  I'm trying to say I'm sorry.  Get a grip on yourself.  You're just saying.  Huh.  I'm just trying to say I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to hurt anybody, Sandy.  I feel you wanted to be too.  Patty, you know what it is?  It's not my fault if that letter came.  Patty, ever since Woody Allen did your voice  in that cartoon movie,  you've had an attitude. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  You're just blowing her nose.  Listen to that.  You all right?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Excuse me?  I don't know if this is the wrong time to mention this  because you look like a sleaze back in those shoes.  You stupid bitch. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  This is what psychopaths do, though.  I'm not psychopaths.  I just have family.  I'm not psychopaths.  Go to sleep, crazy lady.  You're going to be all right?  Yeah, but I'm a very good person.  This is how they pull you back in.  It was over. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, see?  That's right.  Because now, you know,  how could we make her leave like this  when she will in most likelihood  take her own life?  I'm not going to take my own life.  No?  I'm not like that.  Give it a few minutes.  I'm a person.  I've never heard anybody.  I'm a person.  Stupid.  What?  Stupid.  Here it is, Patty. 
[01:22:30]  I'm the party pooper.  Now we're having fun.  That stupid voice.  You all right?  You okay now?  Yeah.  You were, like, you were blubbering.  My God, Patty.  You don't have to get that upset.  But I'm very sincere when I say I'm sorry.  Right?  We understand.  It's not a bad person.  Right?  Yes.  Colorado Evan from Boston.  She's 45. 
[01:23:00]  And she's a virgin.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh, there she is, jumping in a puddle of anthrax.  You okay now? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, I'm just trying to say I'm sorry.  We heard the I'm sorry.  We have a radio show to do.  Yeah.  This is our first day on in Vegas, and they're treated to this.  They're treated to you crying on our radio show.  Perhaps the finest city in the country, Vegas.  There you go.  Legalized prostitution and gambling.  Love it.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal, Vegas.  We'll be visiting Vegas soon, that's for sure.  All right, Patty?  Yeah, I'm okay. 
[01:24:00]  Any final words?  I just want to...  Shut up!  ...say, I'm sorry, but...  Shut up!  What?  Shut up!  I don't do the shut up.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Patty, anything?  Why are you shaking?  God, I hate...  Anything, Patty?  I...  Ugh.  This...  Shut up, Demi.  I don't know.  Shut up! 
[01:24:30]  Shut up!  Anything?  What?  What?  I just...  Quiet.  Sorry.  Quiet.  Shut up, Demi.  Yeah?  What?  Could you shut up?  Patty, anything?  Anything, please.  We'll let you talk.  Let her talk, Amy.  All right.  You know...  Shut up! 
[01:25:00]  Yeah?  No.  You know, I just...  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  Yes, Patty.  Patty, go ahead.  Are you going to touch that sound machine again?  Boy, we're too smart for you.  The sound machine.  The sound machine, the infernal sound machine.  Man, you are one pathetic loser. 
[01:25:30]  You know, I just wanted to say I appreciate...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up, Demi.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  Patty, we've got to do a radio show.  Yeah, we've got to move on.  We're bombing Afghanistan and whatnot.  Your little, you know, thing worked.  You cried, so now we have to bring you back in.  I was sincerely trying to say I'm sorry. 
[01:26:00]  I want everybody to stay my friend.  You are even more stupid than I first computed.  The infernal sound machine.  I rule the world.  You know, I promise I'll think before I say...  Are you some kind of moron?  You know, I won't take things so personally.  Like, you know, I've just had a few things going on in the last week. 
[01:26:30]  And, you know, I guess I get a little more stuck.  That is your name!  If I said or did anything the wrong way, I apologize for that.  I'll think next time.  It's not so much that I want to kill her.  It's just I want her not to be alive anymore.  There you go.  All right, Patty, can you leave? 
[01:27:00]  All right, Patty.  Can I do accept my apology?  Oh.  You don't want to know the answer to that.  It's so, it's, uh...  Yeah, great.  All right, Patty.  Turn around and walk away.  You're angry.  And you have a right to be angry.  Turn around and walk away.  Colin Quinn's here.  We've got to move on with the show, Patty.  The long walk down the hall.  There she goes.  There she goes in.  Give people something a little less annoying than Patty to leave them with. 
[01:27:30]  A little less annoying.  Hi, fellas.  Hey, Colin.  Do you see the little treats that Himmler dropped off?  All right, Himmler.  There goes Patty.  Her head down.  Walking down the hall.  Into the cold afternoon.  It is a little sad, but it would be funny if she fell down the steps and was paralyzed.  You're out of your mind. 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  All right.  Finally.  All right, we're going to take another break and we're going to start our radio show.  Yeah, we're going to start the show.  We're going to start the radio show.  For the people in Las Vegas.  Las Vegas.  And, uh, apology to all of our, uh, cities that had to listen through that crap.  Colin Quinn is in the studio.  Colin.  Hello.  He's got a big benefit tonight.  We'll talk to him next about it.  Uh, and, uh, Stephen Lynch should be waking up any, any, uh, hour now and he'll be stopping by today. 
[01:28:30]  And Snoop Doggy Dogg calling in at 515.  Nice.  Want to play one of these, uh, prank calls that we did the other day?  All right.  Check this out.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  My name is Jeet.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Ah.  Do you suck a...  What?  Do you suck a...  Yeah.  Bull, I'll bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Terry, my ritual, brother.  Talk to, like, on this phone, man.  What you doing, man?  You don't scare me. 
[01:29:00]  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  Raj.  Well, no ****.  Come on, sir.  Talk to, like, on this seriously.  Hello?  You don't **** yourself or I will unsteel your head and **** on your neck.  Aye, aye, aye, aye.  What the...  Do you think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Who?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and **** my sister.  **** your sister.  What, you little magnet?  You make me want to vomit.  Aye.  Ah.  Are you about to call me an ****? 
[01:29:30]  Who are you?  Corma Pyle.  Huh?  Corma Pyle.  I don't understand.  Who are you?  Corma Pyle.  Huh?  Who are you?  No ****.  I'm not ****.  Who are you?  You at best don't **** yourself or I will unsteel your head and **** down your neck.  Any time, okay?  Come on, let's go.  Ah!  One, two, three.  Bye.  1027 WNEW.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:30:00]  Real fast, Dallas.  What's up?  Ah, not much there, man.  It's talking Patty, man.  She was crazy, man.  That's right, man.  Completely out of her mind.  Now she's just outside the studio.  She really out there, man?  Yeah.  That's, that's, that's...  I can't believe the way she was just, like, not paying attention to it.  A word you guys are saying.  She was just going on, going on.  There you go.  Crazy, man.  That was weird.  Well, it's getting even weirder because we got, uh, the retard of Laverne Shirley stopping 
[01:30:30]  by out of nowhere.  He was Stephen Lynch.  Not out of nowhere.  What happened?  They just introduced themselves to us.  So Stephen Lynch.  I'm burnt up from last night.  How you doing?  Oh, yeah.  How was the show?  You guys never met Stephen Lynch before?  No, I haven't.  I did good anyway.  No, we never did.  We never met him before.  I never did.  I thought you did.  I killed.  It's Colin.  I bet you did.  Thank you.  You guys like, uh, Stephen Lynch's songs?  I don't know anything about him.  What's, what's the favorite song?  No, you've heard the songs on the radio? 
[01:31:00]  I haven't.  She's a mountain and she...  You never heard Kill a Kitten?  I heard that one, yeah.  That's right.  That's the one I was just going to say.  Kill a Kitten or Special Olympics?  Where's your guitar?  Uh, I don't just work with the guitar.  I do a lot of stand-up on my own, too.  Okay.  Would you like to, uh, you know, take a taste of Lynch's mule juice?  So how was the show, guys?  After Patty, yeah, let's, um...  I didn't think it was possible to have a bigger sexual turn-off after she left. 
[01:31:30]  For some reason, Patty leaves in tears and we get ready to just move on and talk about,  I don't know, Afghanistan or the, uh, the anthrax or more anthrax found in Florida.  There's plenty of stuff to talk about.  But then we find out the retarded Laverne and Shirley, uh, we're upstairs waiting.  We need to go stay to Canada.  Yo, Snoop.  Yeah.  Yo, what up?  What's Cripple-A?  Uh, well, yeah, hey.  Shut up, ladies.  How you doing?  Snoop Doggy Dogg.  What's cracking, Captain? 
[01:32:00]  We got, we got, uh, the retarded Laverne and Shirley in here with us.  They're two, uh...  Penny Marshall and, uh...  The retarded version, Snoop.  These are the retarded version.  Oh, we got skinny Marshall.  Yeah, these are the retarded version.  Ugh.  If they, uh, smoked about, uh, I don't know, a couple pounds of chronic...  Uh-huh.  ...they would turn out like these two whack jobs.  Man, that's terrible.  That's an ugly thing to know.  You got all the hot chicks and stuff and we get this crap.  I'm gonna have to bring some up there to y'all.  Give me the address so I can drop some up. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, help us out, man.  I think he would appreciate that.  He's running low, man.  I getcha, gotcha.  We do a little, uh, little, uh, stairwell action, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, you gotta smoke it.  You gotta smoke it where you can, Snoop.  Man, I can dig it, dog.  Snoop, Snoop, you gotta teach us how to talk like you.  I mean, you just gotta take a six-month course in Snooponics.  It's not hard to do.  Snooponics?  Yeah.  I like that.  Can they, like, start us off slow with something that'll make us sound cool?  Yeah, we'll take it two, we'll take it two syllables at a time.  The first thing I want to teach y'all is for shizzle, Dizzle. 
[01:33:00]  For shizzle, Dizzle.  Exactly.  What does that mean?  That just means for show, dog.  Oh, all right.  For shizzle, Dizzle.  Okay.  I used the word, uh, cheddar.  Yeah, cheddar.  Cheddar works, right?  Oh, you could say, or you could say cheese.  He's so proud of using cheddar one day.  But he said it like, hey, do you need some cheddar?  It sounded real stupid.  Or say, or say fettia.  Fettia.  Fettia?  Yeah, fettia.  Isn't that some kind of cheese on a good dollar? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, that's paper.  That's money.  That's cheese.  Donatio's.  Ah, all right.  All right.  I'm getting it.  Yeah, y'all good, man.  I'm going to have to get y'all, move y'all up to the next level in the class.  All right, one more.  One more here.  Give me, give us one more.  Um.  Something really fancy.  Okay, uh.  Uh, what's crippling, my nizzle?  What's crippling, my nizzle?  Uh-huh.  What's happening?  Exactly.  You got it, dog.  Good looking, good looking.  Where the hell do you get crippling? 
[01:34:00]  I mean, you know what I'm talking about?  It's just a figure of speech.  Snoop, we know what like a hoopty is.  Yeah, yeah, what's that?  That's old school.  Yeah, it is.  Hoopty's old school.  Yeah, it is.  Hell yeah.  What do you call your bitches?  Holes.  That never changes, right?  All them hoes.  Nice.  And what about your weed?  Uh, Stanky Dank.  Stanky Dank.  Nah, Stanky likes that.  We got a guy in here, Stanky.  He loves his pot. 
[01:34:30]  Stanky?  Yeah, Stanky loves the stink weed.  Oh, no, that's right.  I got a bunch of it.  Yeah, every time I see you on TV, whether you're doing an episode of Cribs or something  like that, you're always talking about your weed.  I mean, that's my favorite pastime hobby, you know what I mean?  You know, a lot of kids grew up playing with racing tracks and, you know, wanted to do  this or that, but that's my favorite pastime hobby.  Are you stoned all the time?  I'm stoned right now.  I don't doubt it.  You do the wake and bake?  I do the wake, shake, and bake.  That's great, man. 
[01:35:00]  Watch me talk to the homie.  All right, Hoop.  Go ahead.  Try.  Snoop.  Yeah, what's crapping?  Is it cloudy over there?  Hey, man, it's misty like blue.  You know what I'm talking about?  It's foggy when you're next to Dougie.  Yeah.  See, I'm down with that.  You sound so white, Hoop.  It's ridiculous.  Snoop, could you tell us what's the deal with the new fad where all the brothers are wearing  the football jerseys backwards with the name across their chest?  Oh, no, I don't do that.  I don't get down like that. 
[01:35:30]  I was taught to wear my clothes the appropriate way.  But I got some clothes out right now, Snoop Dogg clothing in stores right now.  We don't sell them backwards.  We sell them frontwards.  So rush down to the stores and get it.  And if they don't got it, tell them to put it in stores right now.  And Snoop Dogg clothing?  Yeah, I got my own clothing line.  What's it looking like?  And it's cold.  Jack is from the West Coast.  It's got that flavor.  I mean, everybody's going to love it, man.  We got action wear.  We got sports wear, players wear.  You need to rush down to my warehouse.  Matter of fact, give me y'all sizes.  I'll send y'all some things up there.  Oh, I'm sure we'd look great wearing the Snoop Dog stuff, man. 
[01:36:00]  I'll wear some Snoop Dog.  Dude, I would wear that.  You could talk your way into any girl's pants.  Man, that's real talk.  You've got to be the coolest man alive.  I don't even think you're going to have to say that.  You just pull up with the clothes on and she's going to take her clothes off.  Yeah, it works like that, huh?  Yeah, Jack.  You have any formal attire, like suits or something?  Yeah, that's called the famous player wear.  And we're coming out with that in the middle of spring next year.  It's going to be like five-piece suits.  You know what I'm saying?  Looking sharp, right?  Yeah, yeah, with the hat to match.  Hell, yeah.  Goddamn, looking like Huggy Bear.  That brother looked good back then, huh? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, he did.  He was sharp, Jack.  He had the toe.  Pimping.  Hey, Snoop, you playing the Hammerstein tonight?  Yeah, I'm going to do the damn thing this evening.  You know, knock the roof off the mother.  Yeah.  Any tickets available?  No, not unless you got some good Ralph Mouth.  Wait, what does that mean?  Some Ralph Mouth?  That's for the girls.  The girls have got good Ralph Mouth.  We'll get them some tickets.  Are you talking about the lower lip drag?  Exactly.  The mind dog.  We call it Ralph Mouth for PG. 
[01:37:00]  Baby, I got good whatever it is you just said.  I got it, baby.  I love it.  Oh, look at that.  What's the Ralph Mouth?  Good.  I like, I'm going to have to use that one.  I want to be in your dog pound, baby.  You want to be in my dog pound, baby?  Well, here's what you must do.  First of all, you got to pass the class and shake your ass.  Only in private.  Okay, we can do that.  I can turn off the lights.  No, I want the lights on, baby.  I just don't want anybody else there but you.  Okay, we can make something happen.  Hey, Snoop, you still pimping the hose? 
[01:37:30]  Man, I can't stop, won't stop.  Do you know any girls that would drink out of our mules to get to you?  Man, you never know, man.  I mean, it's a wonder what these girls will do, man.  You know what the thing is?  You got to put your head in her head.  You got to control her mind because anybody can control a woman's body but the kids will control her mind.  Really?  How do you go about that?  Baby, you can control my mind and my body.  You see that, baby?  You see, I just did that and I ain't even seen her and I just put my head in her head. 
[01:38:00]  No bad, Ronald thought I was hot.  You're Snoop Dogg, though, man.  You got the moves, the voice, everything.  You know what I mean?  We're just a couple of ass wipes.  You never know.  How do you do the mind?  I mean, the body is easy with a hammer, but how do you do the mind?  It's like some supernatural powers you have to have to actually, you know, get into her mind.  It's like that Jedi mind crap, right?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, you know, it's a communication thing where y'all communicate with each other.  She's opening her mind up to you and then that's when you do that. 
[01:38:30]  And when she opens her mind, you drop hers out and put yours in.  That's great.  You are too amazing, Snoop.  Snoop, what's up with the new album?  Uh, Bones, the soundtrack.  It comes out next week for the movie that I got coming out starring me and Pam Grier.  Yeah, what is this movie about?  It's a horror movie, you know what I'm saying?  I play a villain and a hero at the same time.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You're like a ghost?  Yeah, I come back from the dead.  This ain't like goddamn Ghost Dad, is it? 
[01:39:00]  No, hell no.  Because that sucks, Snoop.  There's not enough weed in the world to make Ghost Dad look good.  No, you know, I wouldn't come like that.  I don't come halfway.  I'm going to come all the way.  Hell no.  That's good.  So what's the premise of Bones?  Well, it's actually set in 1979 and, you know, it's one of those tales where I end up getting killed behind some, you know, jealousy and hatred and my spirit can't rest.  So 20 years later, I'll come back and take care of those who took care of me.  20 years later.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you doing some type of, like, crow thing? 
[01:39:30]  Not really like the crow.  I think it's got his own flavor.  It reminds me of an old 70s black movie called J.D.'s Revenge, if you've ever seen it.  I used to love the blaxploitation movies.  That's right.  Of the 70s.  Our own Brother Earl here.  Brother Earl, what's happening to my brother?  He turns us on to all, where's Earl?  Get Earl in here.  Earl's the whitest black guy you'll ever meet, Snoop.  You ever seen The Soul of Nigga Charlie?  Yeah, I've seen that.  That one rocks, man.  Yeah.  You have the movie poster.  I have the movie poster from that. 
[01:40:00]  All right, Snoop, this is going to be a pleasure.  You are now talking to Earl.  We call him Black Earl because he always wears black.  He's the whitest black guy.  Earl, say hi to Snoop Doggy Dogg.  What up, baby?  What's up, brother?  How are you doing?  What is that?  What is that?  The guy would get on the mic any other time and just go, hey, what's happening?  Earl, why don't you flow with him a little bit?  Give him a little something.  Show him what you got.  Let's go.  Give him a song.  You're right there.  I'm the squarest guy you'll ever meet. 
[01:40:30]  Can you believe this guy's a brother?  Brother Earl, Brother Earl, what brings you to my neighborhood, my brother?  See, that's how you should sound, Earl.  You should be, like, smoking the big fatties and representing.  Well, I'm not as smooth as Snoop.  You should be pimping hoes.  Yeah, pimping hoes, slamming Cadillac dolls.  You should write a book on that, man.  Do you believe he's a virgin, too?  How old are you?  Hey.  How old are you?  I'm 31.  He's 31 and the brother's a virgin, Snoop.  You know, Smokey Robinson had a song called Can You Love a Virgin, Man? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah?  You need to go listen to it.  Well, that's Smokey's problem because, I don't know.  When did you lose it, Snoop?  13 and a half.  13 and a half.  Yeah.  How old was she?  She was...  Yeah, she did.  Yeah, she did.  She made it big.  And that just started a career for you, man.  I've been going uphill ever since.  It's like, hey, this ain't bad. 
[01:41:30]  That's great, man.  Earl, you have nothing for the Snoop.  What?  I love the guy.  You can't hang with Snoop, man.  I can't hang with Snoop.  All right.  Your new name is Brother Bobby Earl.  Bobby Earl?  Why Bobby?  Because Bobby makes it all the way black.  Brother Bobby Earl.  Bobby Earl.  Brother Bobby Earl.  That does sound blacker.  Yeah.  Yeah, Earl.  That's good.  You can get some hoes with that name.  Bobby Earl.  You want to talk to the retardler, Mer and Shirley? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Dude, if you're effed up right now, you're going to laugh your balls off.  Come here.  Give me Marion, man.  Marion, do you know who Snoop Dogg is?  Yeah, I've heard of him, yeah.  I've heard of him, too.  Shut up, lady guy.  This is Marion.  Marion, say hi to Snoop Dogg.  Hi, Snoop Dogg.  How you been?  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  Ying-yang party.  Yeah, Ying-yang party.  Oh, God damn.  I want to shoot myself.  What the hell is that?  Yo, yo, yo.  Party, guy.  See, you...  Yo, yo, yo.  And you wonder why they have drive-bys.  You got what you say. 
[01:42:30]  Their big thing is yin-yang party.  Ying-yang party, huh?  Long, long time.  Very long time.  Do you think you could work something with that, maybe, in the next song or something  you put out?  Ying-yang party?  Ying-yang party.  Doesn't sound too cool, does it?  Could you work it into a song about two fat pigs?  I'm not fat.  No, we're not.  Come on.  You've got a fat head.  Snoop, you like the big white ass?  Um, all whitey then.  I don't know.  Yeah?  Because I know some of the brothers, they appreciate the big ass.  Yeah, they do. 
[01:43:00]  They appreciate the big, you know...  Yeah, the big thing.  The big dumper.  The big dipper.  Not like these two.  No, I think...  I got the big ass.  I think Lady Di would do well in the community.  Yeah, me too.  She's got a smacking ass.  I think you'd be able to...  She waves on that thing.  You'd be able to pimp her pretty far, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think she'd go all around the world from Spain to Maine.  I think Bin Laden is hiding in her stomach.  She wouldn't be the one that the pimp takes home, though, at the end of the night.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Shut up.  We're talking to your dog.  How do you keep the girls in line that they don't get jealous that, you know, you're taking 
[01:43:30]  one home to spend the night with?  Well, you know, that's called, you know, discipline.  You keep her in line, you know?  Hey, Snoop, a few years back...  Wow.  My God damn, do you rule.  You do rule.  Hey, Snoop, Snoop, a few years back I saw you on Martin.  A few years ago.  When you were on there.  No, you did.  You think he cares?  I don't understand.  I don't listen to rap music.  You listen to rap music? 
[01:44:00]  We don't.  Sometimes we do.  You don't listen to hip-hop?  Sometimes.  I was younger, I did.  Yeah?  And we used to dance to it, too, remember?  Oh, I bet that looked great.  Two big, friggin' white champs dancing to hip-hop.  Two rhinos enjoying Run-D.M.C.  Two rhinos enjoying Run-D.M.C.  That's my life.  Snoop, we got to get you down in the studio.  Yeah, man.  We have fun every day.  We just mess around.  We'll talk.  I come in there and smoke the whole building out.  Hell yeah.  You know, that would be a pleasure if you got a little something going with Stinky in the stairwell. 
[01:44:30]  Man, I'll smoke the whole, you know what I'm saying, scenery out.  Yeah.  Come on down, Snoop.  When's the movie coming out?  It comes out October 24th.  24th.  Mm-hmm.  And the soundtrack?  The soundtrack comes out October 18th.  Cool, man.  Hey, have you talked to Shug since he left?  No siree, bud.  Just asking.  I've been on a mission, you know what I'm saying, trying to do this tour around the whole  world, just giving my people something to smile about through all this tragedy. 
[01:45:00]  There you go.  All right.  All right, bro.  Well, Snoop, it's been a pleasure, man.  Yeah, I appreciate y'all, man.  Yeah.  He says we're cool at the moment.  I'm going to say it like that.  Snoop.  Yeah, I know the radio call is going to be calling y'all, trying to throw y'all asses off  the air, but it's all gravy, baby.  It's all gravy.  It's all good.  I want to be able to think of you as one of the brothers, one of our brothers here  on the show.  That's right, baby. 
[01:45:30]  Y'all be good, man.  I appreciate y'all for having me on y'all's show, man.  And everybody out there listening, rush out and get that Snoop Dogg clothing that says  stores right about now.  Rush it or hush it.  All right, man.  Thanks, Snoop.  Thank you.  Snoop Dogg, your dog.  Chetch.  Hi, Snoop.  Chetch.  There, Chetch.  There you go, Snoop.  He can wear backwards these days.  He's outside.  He's a classic.  How cool is that?  Yeah, how cool is Snoop Dogg?  That guy rocks.  Snoop rocks. 
[01:46:00]  Yo, you heard him?  I sound like a transvestite, man.  Hey, baby.  You heard him?  Errol is now called Bobby Errol.  Bobby Errol.  Bobby Errol.  Bobby Errol.  Yo, Bobby Errol.  I like that.  That rocks, man.  That was fun.  Snoop, yo, Snoop's a character.  You see how badly, OD, you see how badly we all put on the whole black thing?  Like, we're like, all right, man.  Yeah, bro.  Yo, but when I heard you guys were going to have Snoop on, man, I had to go get me a blood. 
[01:46:30]  All my people were right there waiting for the brother to come on, man.  It was real good, man.  We were laughing when you guys were trying to talk to us, son.  I hear that, bro.  Yo, what's the deal?  What's the deal?  I'm bombing already, eh?  You happy?  We're very happy.  Yo, it's going to take a while, though.  I hear that, bro.  All right, old Dirty, we're going to let you go because you've got to take a break, all right?  Peace, baby. 
[01:47:00]  All right, old Dirty.  There we go.  Jesus, man.  How sick is that?  Adam, what's up?  Yo, Opie, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Yo, listen, man, I give you a lot of respect.  Right there with that conversation, you sounded like Carson Daly.  He gave us even an interview on TRL, man.  We've got to chill with that accent, man.  We were just...  Hear me?  Later on, guys.  I used cheddar.  Yeah, word.  Cheddar.  We were just messing, though.  But, I mean, you have to start sounding black if Snoop's on the phone. 
[01:47:30]  I know, man.  No.  Seriously, you've got to chill just a little bit on that.  All right, man.  We were just having fun.  Cool.  Peace.  Peace.  All right, man.  How are you, Snoop Dogg?  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  I did not say that this time.  It's Lady Di.  How are you?  I did not say that this time.  He's never going to come in the studio now.  I'm going to replay.  How are you?  I'm going to be a musical one.  He's going to think we're...  Colin, what do you think about this?  He's going to think we're a bunch of nerds now.  I think, yeah, I think it's... 
[01:48:00]  I might take my shoe off and smack it upside that mother-effing head.  How funny is that?  Hey, did you hear us do the video musical one?  That's classic, man.  Did you hear us do the video musical one?  No, I didn't.  Snoopy, how are you, Snoopy?  We missed it.  We missed it.  We were funny.  How are you?  I love Charlie Brown and Lucy.  You wear Tommy Hilfiger clothes.  I did not say how are you.  All right.  You tell Tommy Hilfiger you wear his clothes.  All right, Mary, Mary.  You wear...  That's Colin Quinn, not Stephen Lynch.  No, I know.  No, you didn't know.  Diane thought it was Stephen Lynch.  You didn't.  It's Colin Quinn from SNL Fallon. 
[01:48:30]  You didn't know that because you're a mush-mouthed horse's ass.  I'm not a mush-mouthed.  You know why?  Because I wasn't...  Well...  Who decided it was going to be Retard Day on the opening night?  Yeah, it is Retard Day, especially Vegas.  We're trying to, like...  The first day.  We're trying to hang with Snoop Dogg.  You know, he's never going to hang with us, you know?  I remember the old Saturday night.  Why not?  Why?  Because we sound like nerds having you guys in.  And Mary...  Like Snoop Dogg's talking about pimping and his chicks and, you know, the ones that he doesn't 
[01:49:00]  take home with him, he's got to smack him inside the head with his shoe, and we get  the Retard Laverna Show.  That's our chicks.  And Stalker Patty, who's still outside.  And Stalker Patty in tears outside still.  Patty!  You know what?  They came in, and the first thing that I said is, Patty, how are you?  Yeah.  You didn't listen, and she left the studio in tears.  Patty's outside looking for attention still.  You did.  You said, Patty, how are you?  I said, hi.  How are you?  No.  Hey, Lady Di.  Hi, Patty.  How are you doing?  She's crying.  That's how she is.  Lady Di, is it true you lost your job again? 
[01:49:30]  No.  Did you lose your job at the brewery?  I did not.  Colin, no crap.  She worked at a brewery.  Or still does.  Do you work at the brewery?  I still do.  Yes.  Look at Mary and now coming over to Opie to try to say some secret things.  Don't talk about...  Wait, wait.  Mary, come here.  Come here.  All right, come here.  The mic's off.  What?  It's all right.  Turn the mic off.  Mary, we're in break.  We're in commercial break.  Don't worry.  What?  We're in commercial.  Promotion at work.  You get a what?  You got a promotion?  A promotion at work you don't want anyone to know? 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  Why?  I got a promotion.  What?  You get to move stools and chairs?  I go from labor to maintenance person.  You're a maintenance person?  You were a laborer.  Now you're a maintenance person.  It probably says manatee.  You misread it.  Everything is fine with us.  Manatee.  It looks the same in writing.  Lady Di, did you lose your job again?  No.  No?  I'm going to tell you that.  You still work at the Shots Brewery?  All right.  I wanted to let you know because somebody at work asked if I was going to tell you guys.  So I said, yeah.  That is fascinating.  And I'm so happy you've told us.  What's the difference between a laborer and a maintenance worker? 
[01:50:30]  Pay raise.  Pay raise.  What do you do?  What's different about your job?  I do more work.  And more lifting, more stuff.  More lifting, more moving, more stuff.  More lifting.  More everything.  More stuff.  More of everything.  Colleen Quinn, what's wrong?  He doesn't think Collins is losing his mind.  He doesn't think these two are real.  They are as real as they get, my friend.  That's right.  It's just because of what you said about Snoop with his hoes.  And he calls up you guys.  What?  What did he say?  Let you guys know.  What did he say?  What did he say?  What did he say?  That Snoop's got his hoes.  And he's talking about, you know, that he's got to beat some upside the mother effing head 
[01:51:00]  with his shoe.  And we get this.  These are Opie and Anthony's broads.  This is our hoes, our posse.  We get that.  They took us to the MTV Awards.  It was great.  Yeah, that was our.  We had a great time.  They were our date to the MTV Video Music Awards.  We had such a great time with you guys.  How sad is that, Collin?  Collin, help us out.  We had such a great time with the three of us.  Collin's crying.  We had a wonderful time interviewing the celebrities.  Yes, I know you.  They don't shut up either. 
[01:51:30]  They just keep going, Collin.  Everybody over.  You know who you should be?  You two should be talking to Ricky Tiki Tave.  Who's that?  Well, Ricky Tiki Taffy, you mean, right?  The cartoon character?  Oh, my God.  That's wonderful.  They do rule.  That is a cartoon character.  Ricky Tiki Taffy.  All right.  So, ladies, why did you stop by today?  We came up to visit.  Just to say hi.  We haven't seen you guys since.  How are you?  I'm so glad the security is so tough out there. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah, our date.  That's why we came by.  That was our date.  To let you know that I'm back from my vacation in one piece.  You never called.  Were you talking to the mic?  To let you know I'm back from my vacation in one piece.  Oh, we're glad for that.  Like my sweatshirt, guys?  Like my sweatshirt?  Got it from Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.  Why is Colin on the floor, like, flapping around like a fish?  He's in the Margaritaville shirt.  It's all perfect.  I was in Orlando.  I didn't know they made sweatshirts that big. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, it's perfect to cover a Ferrari with if it rains.  It's a large.  What size are you?  Doubles as a hammock.  That is a big sweatshirt.  It is.  It is big on me.  It is.  It is, huh?  I didn't wash you in the blanket yet.  And Lady Di has a Stinky Rules t-shirt.  That's right.  I sure do.  I don't know why.  She's in the Margaritaville.  It's either that or the Jim Norton shirt.  Hey, Colin, look at the bling bling on Lady Di.  I know, I know.  Feel it.  How thin it is.  He's ready to snoop.  Feel how thin that is.  They used to wrap ring dings in thicker foil than that gold she's wearing around her neck. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, Di, when you're done with that shirt, are they going to hang it from the Verizontal?  No, I don't think so.  I'll just hang it in my closet.  This Stinky Rules shirt.  That's great.  Ow.  That hurt.  How do you come back to something like that?  Look at God.  I'm like, great.  Thank you, the Jimmy Buffett shirt.  You can't.  I got one from Universal Studios.  Really?  But is Jimmy Buffett's fun down there?  We're going to have a place.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great place.  I went there every night.  The four nights after there. 
[01:53:30]  Did you get it for free because you are the king calling display?  No, it's no coverage charge.  It's no coverage charge to get in that place.  You went to Universal Studios with your husband.  Yeah.  And is it true that he got arrested because they thought he was stealing some of the exhibits?  No.  From Universal when he walked out with you?  We went to Universal Studios and we went to Islands of Adventure and SeaWorld.  Did they accuse you of smuggling Epcot Center under your shirt?  No, because we didn't go to Epcot Center.  She got you there, Jim.  We didn't go to Epcot Center.  I was nowhere near Epcot Center or Disney World. 
[01:54:00]  Well, she got you there, Jim.  Wow, Jim.  How are you going to come back from that?  I know.  You're right.  You really fired a zinger.  Yeah, how are you going to come back?  All right.  But we left the day before the bombing.  I don't even know either.  Ah, there you go.  Thank God.  So I first come on an airplane on my last time.  When you were at Universal Studios, did somebody throw you a fish at SeaWorld?  No, you know what's the best part about Universal?  I don't know if you guys have ever been there.  The Blues Brothers thing that they do.  Oh, isn't that great?  That's great.  Watching people that vaguely resemble the real people do bad versions of their songs.  And what do they do as the Blues Brothers? 
[01:54:30]  They sing the Soul Man.  They sing like two other songs.  And then they walk around.  Isn't that great?  They walk around the streets, they come in at the police car, just like the movie.  Were you the only one at Universal with a hockey helmet on?  No.  No.  I didn't have a hockey helmet.  It's like watching things like the Indiana Jones stunt show where the guy that stars in  the stunt show, he's dressed like him but doesn't really look like him.  Like that?  I went to see that too at the stunt show.  Oh, you saw the stunt show.  Great.  Sing us a little Soul Man. 
[01:55:00]  No.  Did anybody comment on your Stormtrooper of Death hairdo?  No.  What's wrong with my hair?  I'm getting a cut.  Nothing if you work for Darth Vader.  It's not wrong with mine.  At least I have hair.  What happened to yours?  He just shaved it.  He got you there again.  Yeah, I know.  It looks like you need a shave too underneath hair.  You're right.  You're growing a beard.  Well, you all men grow beards.  Hey, ladies, what do you think we should do with Bin Laden?  Who?  Actually, let me tell you one thing.  Really, my opinion, after what the hell they're doing over here to all of us, we should just 
[01:55:30]  go in there.  I know they're bombing, but we should just, no matter where the hell we're hiding, just  go in there and just keep bombing and bombing and bombing and bombing until we get every  one of them.  You are an uninformed ass.  It's true.  That what?  It's true.  Where are we going to do the bombing and bombing and bombing and bombing?  Bomb and bombing and bombing and bombing.  I don't care.  Bomb and bombing.  Bag and bang.  Step in the future.  Step in the future.  I don't want to say one thing, though, until we get the SOB.  Woo.  Wow.  Who is?  Until we get the SOB. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, easy with the language.  No.  We're going after a five-second delay.  I can't believe it.  Why are we looking for a club on 7th Avenue?  Snoop Dogg is saying Mother F-er on our airwaves, and she's like, get that SOB.  SOB.  Right.  SOG.  God dog it.  Gosh darned it.  Why?  Colin, what's wrong over there?  Are you all right?  What's wrong with you?  Isn't it amazing?  Can you imagine these two on remote control?  Are you taking happy pills?  Say what?  Yeah, be happy pills is there. 
[01:56:30]  This is all perfect.  You're right, girls.  So you think, and Lady Di, what do you think about the whole situation and what we should  be doing to Osama bin Laden and various terrorist groups?  I say the same thing that Marion said.  Bombing, bombing, bombing.  Bombing, bombing, bombing.  Could you say it without a third grader's lisp?  Bombing and bombing and bombing.  Hey, can you guys make out?  No!  Jesus Christ!  We've seen enough horror in the past few weeks.  Can you guys make out?  Yeah, sure.  No. 
[01:57:00]  By the way, you were good on television and nobody is giving you the credit.  Can you guys make out?  No, I'm complimenting.  You were good on the show.  When you went ballistic in the third ring and ran out and they had to put you down.  You were kids riding you.  All right, ladies.  So you just stopped by to say hi.  Yeah, that's always good.  How are you?  Because Lady Di lost her job.  How are you, Anthony?  Hey, how are you?  He loves that.  Oh, she's on the red carpet.  I think we had a chance to let you know, but we did have a great time doing a music award.  Isn't that amazing that you were able to conduct interviews from the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards and the Emmys were canceled. 
[01:57:30]  So you guys were pretty much the last people to do big interviews at a red carpet event like that.  How are you?  She said that every two seconds.  That's all she was saying.  Do we have a clip of them from the BMA?  They didn't know.  They didn't even know who was walking by.  Come on, sing along.  I said a lot.  I said a lot.  Was this it, Marion?  What? 
[01:58:00]  Was this it?  Soul Man?  Were they doing this?  Were you doing the dance and everything?  I wasn't.  You and your husband were doing the dance?  No, we weren't dancing.  We couldn't dance in the street.  They did it and they did it on the stage and then they walked off and did it in the street and then they went in a circle and went around.  What was your husband doing besides looking at you and vomiting?  My husband doesn't vomit.  Hey, can we French kiss?  What was your wife doing besides looking at you and vomiting even though I know he's not married? 
[01:58:30]  That's why you're not married.  You can't get a wife.  Hey, Lady Di, can you do me a favor?  Yes, what is it?  Colin Quinn is like a new friend of the show.  He's just starting to hang with us and we like him a lot and we want to initiate him into the club.  Can you flash Colin, please?  Sure.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Look at this.  Watch this.  Oh, my God.  Look at those.  Nice.  Isn't that great?  What do you think, Colin?  Well, I thought they were actually very substantial compared to what I expected.  Lady Di, not just a name, a great suggestion. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, be nice, Anthony.  What's going on these days?  Yeah.  Please don't say Di.  What's going on these days?  She's right.  Well, you know, who am I to say that?  You're absolutely right.  I know that, but you never know.  You are so right.  Why would I do that?  You're right.  Right.  You're so right.  Do you hate being over a fire with an apple in your mouth?  What?  I'll go through the fire if you go first.  I want to live a long time.  That's bad.  Right. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  How about Lady Anthrax?  No.  Is that good?  No?  Is that too hard?  Did you go out and buy an oxygen mask?  Hey, Jim, did you go out and buy an oxygen mask?  What's that?  Did you go out and buy an oxygen mask?  I don't know what an oxygen mask is.  Everybody's buying these oxygen masks.  Gas masks.  It's their gas masks.  Gas masks.  Yeah?  Okay.  Riff on that.  Did you go out and buy one?  No.  You're afraid something might happen?  You can't walk around looking over your shoulder.  Tell me you bought a gas mask.  Nope.  I'm not going to walk around looking over my shoulder every day.  I thought she was wearing one.  Because you can't.  Why should you?  What are you looking over your shoulder for? 
[02:00:00]  I'm not.  You can't see what the gas mask protects.  Exactly.  No, but I mean, everybody's going out and buying these masks, buying this, buying that.  They're paranoid.  Are you nervous about swimming out onto the beach to spawn and then going back home?  I don't go on the beach.  A little leathery egg on a leaf.  How do you avoid the great whites?  Jim hates me.  I don't hate you.  I know.  I love you, Jim. 
[02:00:30]  I don't hate you at all, camera.  We've got to get together and hang out and party.  Marriott.  Marriott.  Hey, Jim, you're going to party.  What do you know about anthrax?  Nothing.  I don't want to know anything about it either.  So you think we're paranoid?  People are paranoid?  No.  A lot of people are paranoid.  Did you see what happened down the road?  I know what's going on.  So maybe it's not paranoia.  Maybe it's just concern for people's safety.  Yeah, but to each his own.  But if you start going out, start buying this, start doing this, start doing that, you end up with panic and anxiety attacks.  And then you're going over to taking all these anti-depressants. 
[02:01:00]  Could you possibly say something less poignant?  But it's true.  It's true.  I know a lot of, I've heard of a lot of people now.  Colin, comment.  I think you guys should come see Jim as his guest at the Comedy Cellar any night during the week.  Hey, why don't we, Jim?  You should.  Go down to the cellar.  I'll be down there, but Jim Norton will just go in and say Jim Norton's guest.  I'm telling you.  Why not?  I'll leave your name at the door.  I'll just tell him a woman with a head the size of a Stonehenge statue will be showing up. 
[02:01:30]  The guy who needs a shave.  Yeah.  Very bad.  You look like you just woke up.  You look like you've been, like, asleep for two or three days.  You look like you've been hung over for two or three days.  You look like you've been on a bench for two or three days.  Wow, she's tearing you up.  Wait, when you want to reach a verbal torrent.  Marion.  That's not funny.  Oh, come on.  Do you know anything about Jim Norton?  Not at a time like this, Marion.  Yeah, he's looking at me.  He knows I'm only kidding one of them.  Come on.  Marion, you know, a lot of people have lost sleep recently. 
[02:02:00]  And not at a time like this, talking about sleep.  You don't even know.  Jim has HIV.  No.  He'll tell you.  No, he does not.  I bet you feel bad now that you just said all those things.  I don't know about Jim because she's on a computer a lot and she tries to train them in when he's on a computer.  And she also has hair like a Lego person.  You have an Lego app.  Oh, my God.  What?  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you very much.  You said she had a Lego butt.  Yeah.  He said that.  I was just saying that in those pants she was wearing at the VMAs, her butt looked like a square Lego. 
[02:02:30]  Like you just popped her Lego butt on.  I heard the whole thing, Anthony.  Right, right.  I'm glad to see you're taking a more sexier approach to your clothing than you were that thing.  Thank you, Anthony.  How weird is Colin's life?  In about two hours, he's going to be hanging with Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld and Cosby.  They're going to be right around the corner.  Carnegie Hall.  Carnegie Hall.  Yeah.  And he's hanging with these two dumps schools before the show.  I would have loved to see and I would have loved to have gone to that show last night. 
[02:03:00]  These all went to.  All these big celebrities.  But I had a hockey game last night.  Ranger opening night.  Did you wear your hockey helmet?  Did people comment that you have the sex appeal of Komodo dragon feces?  What is a Komodo dragon?  Oh, that's some Japanese dragon.  Feels like a Komodo dragon.  There it is.  There's the comeback.  She's got the comebacks, though.  You got funny hair.  You got funny hair.  You guys go to the Video Music Awards parties after the show and everything? 
[02:03:30]  We didn't.  No.  We had to get home.  No.  We had them dressed up on the red carpet conducting all the interviews.  We had a lot of fun.  It was great.  They were calling hip-hop artists by wrong names.  How are you?  We could give them a taste.  How about Bon Jovi?  My favorite is Bon Jovi, who they, of course, grew up adoring.  We love him.  So when they saw Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora walking by.  I didn't even notice.  All right, shut up, Mary. 
[02:04:00]  Here's a little taste of Lady Di and Mary and the Retard of Laverne and Shirley at the red carpet of the VMAs when Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora walk by.  Oh, my God.  We love you.  Richie Sambora.  Richie Sambora.  We love you.  Richie.  Oh, my God.  It's Bon Jovi.  We love you guys.  A half way there.  All living on a prayer.  It's my life.  It's my life. 
[02:04:30]  It's my life.  It's now or never.  That's an interview?  That was an interview.  That was their interview with John Bon Jovi.  No, that was our interview for our national audience.  That was it.  That was all it.  And John Bon Jovi kept on walking.  I wonder why.  I wonder why.  You sound like a real member of the press corps.  You know, I would think Bon Jovi, she's chick.  She would want to go over and talk to him.  People didn't know you, but Karatop knew you.  This is what they had to say there. 
[02:05:00]  Karatop said he hung out with you.  When you sing, it sounds like Babe Ruth's farewell speech.  I don't know if that's true, but Karatop said he hung out with you.  You guys were roomies and everything.  Is that true, Jim?  I don't know.  He was pulling your trust.  He said you guys knew.  He said you were in college.  I don't know if he's working.  One question.  Where was Mark Wahlberg?  When we were interviewing Karatop.  No, you walked right by.  You passed up Mark Wahlberg for Karatop.  Who did they blow off because they thought they saw Kato Kaelin? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, yeah, Kato Kaelin.  Nate Dogg.  There was some guy that walked away.  Listen to what they said to Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, yo.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Show that live.  How are you?  How are you doing?  I can't ask you a question.  Come here.  Hey, nice shirt.  Tic-tac-toe, buddy.  All right.  How are you doing?  Hey, nice shirt.  How are you doing?  Like the earrings.  Nice shirt.  He took time out to goof on Marion. 
[02:06:00]  Nice glasses.  Wonderful.  That's an interview.  So damn funny.  Did you just call Will Ferrell a Polack?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because he had these pants on.  Hey, you know, you're a Polack.  What a Polack?  He had horrible pants.  Why would he be a Polack?  People used to, people used to, they don't dress the way he was dressed.  Did a match?  A Polack suit?  His clothes in a match.  Even her racism is irrelevant, you know?  Even her racist remarks are dated.  About the Japanese dragon and the Polack, Will Ferrell. 
[02:06:30]  Actually, he's going to be at the show.  He should go heckle him again.  Yeah.  He's going to be at the show tonight, Will Ferrell.  He should go over and heckle him again.  Really?  But the guy had on, he didn't even match.  Don't worry, checkers and stripes or checkers and whatever.  Thank God.  You do match.  Can I just say hi to somebody, Maverick?  Shut up.  What, your yap?  This is what they had to say to Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Listen to this.  Hey, who are you?  We'd like to do an interview with you.  We're going to do an interview with you.  Hi.  We're going to do an interview with you.  Who are you?  Dale Earnhardt Jr. 
[02:07:00]  Who's that?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't look like him.  I'm sorry about your dad and everything.  I'm sorry about your dad.  Yeah.  You know, so how are you doing since, are you winning any races?  No, he did.  He just won a race.  Okay.  All right.  I don't watch y'all.  I don't watch car racing.  I don't enjoy some.  Yeah.  Yes, we are.  There we are.  Good night.  Nice interview.  Nice jacket.  Nice pantsuit.  Pantsuit.  Nice pantsuit. 
[02:07:30]  That's a smart outfit.  No, you wear pantsuits.  That's very smart slacks.  You told Tommy, he'll figure he wears clothes.  You don't wear his clothes.  You don't wear designer clothes.  A pantsuit?  A pantsuit.  Who are you interviewing?  A math teacher in 1965?  Moron.  Nobody wears pantsuits.  This is what they had to say to Tommy Hilfiger, the famous designer.  How are you doing?  Tommy Hilfiger.  How are you doing?  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight? 
[02:08:00]  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after Watson performs.  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  I hope so.  All right.  Okay.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  How are you?  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  I will.  I will.  You always bust me because I wear flower shirts.  I'm full.  I'm full.  Flower shirts.  I'm done. 
[02:08:30]  I'm done with this.  But she said flower shirts, Anthony.  Because I wear t-shirts.  We always bust on each other about the clothes that we have.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, you can both, you know, trade bars.  Your clothes match, though.  Big and big.  This is a large.  What kind of pants are you wearing today?  Let me see the pants.  Let me see the pants.  Oh, God.  Colin, do you know one day Lady Di came in with leather pants on?  She wore leather pants.  And I still will come in with those leather pants, too.  It's a leotard or something, right?  And how come only Lady Di flashes in these? 
[02:09:00]  I know.  You want to see Marion's guns.  Believe me, they are huge.  Marion.  Come on.  Flash.  Colin Quinn.  Flash Colin.  Come on, Marion.  Flash Colin.  Flash Colin.  Come on.  Show your meaty cans.  Look at the big pocketbooks she carries with her.  They're pretty impressive.  Come on.  Show it.  Those are great.  Oh, yeah, she was having her time last time.  But she talked about it.  Her time seems to last like three or four weeks. 
[02:09:30]  Colin, know how big her pad was?  You know when you fly and they give you that little pillow?  That's how big her freaking pad was.  It was huge.  It wasn't even a tampon.  It was like a rolled up quilt.  I don't wear tampons.  From the description she gave, every month she bleeds like Sonny Corleone.  My wife had her period at the causeway.  Look how they massacred my pad.  Can I say something about the older you get, the more you have down there. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, is that how it is?  Right before you go through your changes.  Through your change of life.  Yep.  Into what type of creature.  No, just remember when your girlfriend's over 35 and 36 or 37.  Uh-huh.  Do you remember?  Okay.  What?  I'll remember that.  Do you remember any woman that you guys know?  Yeah, but the way you are, though, your crotch looks like the Zapruder film.  You don't know what I look like.  You probably don't have anything in there. 
[02:10:30]  There's the comeback.  Colin, isn't that the best?  Let's do it.  Like this?  These are some of the best comebacks since I Know You Are But What Am I, right?  Like this?  Like this?  All right, we have to take a break.  Like this?  Hey, can we start our radio show next?  I would love to start the program that we do on a daily basis for the people, especially in Vegas.  The other cities, they've heard our show on other days and understand what it's about.  Vegas only has this program to judge what we're all about. 
[02:11:00]  First impression, we are effed.  Maybe we should get the first impression from Vegas.  Hey, you lost Vegas.  Yeah.  Anyone from Vegas listening, give us a call at 866-277-4WOW.  It would be very popular in Vegas, the fat package.  We've all lost Vegas.  The fat package.  We're not fat.  I'm not fat.  Give him a comeback.  Give him a comeback, Marion.  Marion, he called you fat.  He called you fat.  I'm not fat.  I'm chubby.  Give him a comeback.  You got a fat head.  There you go.  Wow.  We're in.  Woo!  You actually have plankton on your stomach. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, come on, Jim.  We got to set up a date, me and you.  We got to go out.  How many shrimps can you strain through baleen?  That's wonderful.  What about what Marion just said about a date for her and Jim?  Oh, yeah?  You want to date Jim?  No.  Why?  Marion, I like the footage when you roll out of the water and somebody pets you and you  roll back in, but I don't want to go out to eat.  Show Colin your guns.  Show him your cans.  We'll go out.  How about show him the bunt?  No. 
[02:12:00]  How about the taint?  Do that famous...  Oh, the checker age.  Oh, thanks, Colin.  Ugh.  Do a taint checker.  Jesus.  I love Marion's cans, though.  When you used to flash...  You have a lot of people in the air.  When you used to flash, they were great.  No, not your can.  Your boobs.  Your breasts.  I love them.  We love your boobs.  When you used to flash in here a lot, that was the highlight of our day.  No, I don't...  I haven't seen things like that since they...  I just recently watched Pearl Harbor.  You know the torpedoes they use to bomb the ships with?  That's what they look like. 
[02:12:30]  Maybe another time.  Could you flash this?  We're not talking about your weeble-like hips.  We want to see your breasts.  I have hips, but I don't weeble down.  They're pretty good hips.  Can you just flop one out?  I don't know.  Come on.  I don't flop either.  Show Colin one.  How about show them...  I'll show mine if you show me yours.  Whoa.  Marion, Marion.  Really fast.  Just show them your bra.  Yeah.  Show them your bra, Liam.  Show them your bra.  Just your bra.  Your hips look like parentheses.  Wow.  You see that?  Isn't that great? 
[02:13:00]  All right.  We have to take a break.  That's wonderful.  Ladies, thanks.  You're welcome.  Fat.  Vegas.  I'm so sorry.  Las Vegas.  Hi, Marion.  I'm so sorry.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  ONA World, baby!  Yeah, sure.  And we're back with the ONA Show. 
[02:13:30]  Time to start our radio show with an hour left in the program.  I just want to say hi to Las Vegas.  Hello, Las Vegas.  God, this had to be our first show.  You picked the wrong day to start listening to us.  Damn it.  Bo, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, how are you, man?  Pretty good.  Man, I'm sitting there listening to you guys, man.  Yeah, you're in Vegas.  You're having on the...  Are those girls, like, fat or something?  Oh, my God.  With Harley, Barry and Shirley?  You wouldn't even believe it. 
[02:14:00]  Because, I mean, I want to ask her a question.  Is she still there?  One of them?  They're outside the studio.  We need to take a little break from them.  Colin Quinn puts it this way.  There's not one redeeming quality to the retard of Laverne Shirley.  That's a quote from Colin Quinn as he was leaving the studio to get ready for his gig tonight at Carnegie Hall.  And you guys, I wasn't digging you guys at first, but when I heard you guys capping on those girls, that was funny as hell.  Oh, all right.  Cool.  Ask her if her blood types ragu.  I need a blood transfusion.  All right, Bo, give it some time, all right?  All right, man. 
[02:14:30]  All right, bro.  Let's go to Mike.  Checking in from Las Vegas.  Mike, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I have to say, the first impression hasn't been all that great.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I'm going to agree with you, Mike, 100%.  Hey, Philly, does this sound familiar?  But, you know, when I first turned on, I listened right from the very beginning.  You guys were rocking and metallic, and I thought, cool, this is going to be all right.  Oh, the music thing.  Yeah.  What turned you off so far, Mike?  Well, honestly, you spent an hour on that sorry, miserable woman trying to get into your building. 
[02:15:00]  You're right.  I was so glad.  Five minutes would have been cool, you know, buster balls a little bit, and then move on.  You redeemed yourself with Snoop, so that was cool.  And I'm just hoping that you have some better guests.  Our whole schedule got rearranged here in Vegas.  Hey, we had Snoop Doggy Dog.  Come on.  That's what I said.  You guys redeemed yourself with Snoop.  And we had Colin Quinn, and he didn't say anything because we wasted the time with the  Retard of Laverne and Shirley. 
[02:15:30]  All right, Mike, give it time.  All right?  All right.  All right, bro.  Mike, definitely not digging it.  And there you go.  Two people listening in Vegas.  In Vegas.  We asked Vegas to call, and two people called in.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  What's up?  How are you?  Oh, my God.  Those two are killing me.  Yeah.  I'm going to drive off the road.  I'm driving home here.  I'm going to drive off the road.  I'd rather have a shot of anthrax from Magic Johnson's Balloon Knot than listen to them  two.  That ugly, retarded, scummy, down syndrome, disgusting pig. 
[02:16:00]  I think Jim Norton has had some influence on you.  Oh, yeah.  Norton rules.  All right.  I think he sucks.  All right.  How about that?  All right.  That's fine.  Our buddy, our pal, Psycho Mark checking in.  Mark.  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Hey, Colin.  How's it going?  I saw you over in the green room over here at Fox.  Colin's gone.  Colin's gone.  He's already left.  He went from hanging out with the retarded Laverne Shirley to going to the green room  at Carnegie Hall to hang out with Chris Rock, Bill Cosby. 
[02:16:30]  He's going to go shizzle his nizzle.  He's shizzling as we speak.  Those cancer twins.  Hey, I just came back from Times Square.  There's a bunch of communist bastards down there with anti-bomb signs and everything.  They're all, oh, it's disgusting.  I just want to wrangle each one of them.  There's peace protesting.  Is that right?  Yeah, they're down there.  Stop the burning.  Stop the burning.  Why didn't you get in their face?  I did.  I was doing it for about ten minutes.  I had to walk back here to Fox, but I gave them at least a good five minutes worth of screaming 
[02:17:00]  and yelling.  We would love to hear that live on the air, my friend.  Yeah, well, unfortunately, I was running out of batteries.  I tried to call in earlier when you guys were there, but if anyone's driving through Times  Square this afternoon or this evening, please roll down your window and remind them what  spineless Fs they really are.  Hey, Mark, were they all like college students?  Oh, dude, you just want to choke them.  You want to pick up the dreads.  They're like, peace, man, peace.  You're like, I want to take a hand in your head and smash it open. 
[02:17:30]  Why don't you look down the street and see the 610 people, you moron?  We didn't get where we are today by being peaceful.  Hey, we tried that out.  We were very peaceful for many years, and then look at where that got us.  Were they white guys with dreads, Mark?  Yeah, oh, absolutely.  The worst, you know.  Total communists.  100% communist bastards.  Kill them all.  All right, guys, kill them all.  Let God sort them out.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  I love that we're bombing Afghanistan.  Hey, what's the latest? 
[02:18:00]  I love it.  What's the latest on that hijacked plane?  Don't freak out, everyone, because it turned out to be...  No, yeah, it wasn't a hijacking.  Check out this story.  This just recently happened.  A passenger tried to enter the cockpit of an American Airlines flight, flight 1238 from  L.A. to Chicago.  Military jets raced to its side.  The plane landed safely at O'Hare Airport.  Two F-16s scrambled to the plane, creating a sonic boom as they broke the sound barrier.  Some of the northwest suburbs heard that noise, which sounded like two large explosions. 
[02:18:30]  So that freaked them out.  Someone said they heard a gigantic boom.  The house shook.  The pilot of the American Airlines plane called in a passenger disturbance when someone began  banging on the door of the 767 cockpit.  Airline officials now say the passenger is a young man who is mentally disabled.  Officials said the young man apparently just wanted to go inside the cockpit since he had  been allowed inside another plane's cockpit before. 
[02:19:00]  Where was his parents?  The FBI says it's possible that no charges will be filed in the case.  The F-16s escorted the plane to the airport because Corky, from Life Goes On, wanted to  see the pretty lights.  Corky!  Corky!  This plane could have been shot down.  Hey, parents, can you control your effing retards if you're going to stick them on an aircraft?  Why was a mentally disabled guy in the plane? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, no.  Ah!  I want to see the pretty lights!  This is Corky singing, right?  Yeah.  Let's listen to some Corky.  Open the door!  She comes out like a rule!  Open the door!  For everybody's own!  Tell which one's the retard.  She'll get you a touch.  How about this?  You can look like you've been a nice touch. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, I'm a retard.  That's a retard.  Oh, I'm a retard.  This is really Corky from Life Goes On.  A second.  It's late at night while you sleep.  Who's alive?  It comes creepy.  Oh, wow.  That's a retard.  She's pretty as a daisy.  It's like, look at it, man.  It's crazy.  Ah, you're crazy.  If you really do, you win.  It's still letting it get under your skin.  Ah, listen, I'm trying to work around that huge tongue. 
[02:20:30]  Listen, I'm trying to get words out around that giant tongue.  Joey!  Yo, what's up?  What's up?  Yo, so I'm watching CNN, right?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, this lady starts to talk about it.  Yeah.  Next thing she says, the kid is a retard.  You know, she doesn't say it like that.  But she goes, the father was holding him, and he was holding him so tight, the kid got  really, you know, pissed.  And he kicked the hell out of his father, and he ran towards the door. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, man.  He ran towards the door.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  So basically, there's a bunch of, like, you know, passengers, you know, sitting there  and, like, watching, you know, this stuff happen.  And this kid's banging on the door.  The cockpit guy freaked out.  Oh, my God.  So he pressed the, um, like, like, the hijack alert button, because now they have those  in the planes, right?  He's got the retard strength.  Yeah, of course.  You know what that is, retard strength?  They could, uh, they could break the hold of their parents and whatnot.  They're like ants.  They could bite your hair, man.  Yeah, all of a sudden, he just goes, they got that upper body, uh, retard strength.  Yeah, wait, so, um, how much are the tickets for this Carnegie Hall thing? 
[02:21:30]  I think that's already sold out.  Sold out?  Yeah, that's a big benefit for, uh, what's been going on here in New York, obviously.  All right, yeah, but I think the kid was a retard figgy, so, you know.  All right.  It was an F-car, basically.  All right, Joey.  Later.  Boy, I'll tell you one thing.  Uh, I wonder, I wonder why the passengers didn't get up and attack the guy.  He's lucky, man.  Right?  You see that happening?  I, I, I, at this point, you're a passenger on a plane. 
[02:22:00]  I don't, if someone doesn't like their drink they've been handed, I think the passengers  pummel him.  Just pummel him.  Jesus.  You could probably see footage of that on the Discovery show when retards attack.  I think Fox puts that on.  When retards attack.  Unbelievable.  You know, you gotta control your people on airplanes.  If you've got a retarded kid that's going to stop banging on the door. 
[02:22:30]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  And apparent hijacking was just the work of a retarded child banging on the door.  Talking in a retarded way.  I can't believe people actually talk with that retarded sound of their voice.  Why can't they be more professional like me?  How can we keep retards away from the cockpit? 
[02:23:00]  See my ex-school, ex-school, a one-of-a-kind report tonight.  That was me, Tom Brokaw.  NBC Nightly News starts at 9 o'clock.  Oh, there it's so.  9 o'clock.  Tom Brokaw.  NBC Nightly News.  Bombing continuing in Afghanistan. 
[02:23:30]  Oh my God, why did they have to bomb that place?  No, you said Afghanistan, right?  Yes, but in other cities, like, uh-oh, okay.  Bombing in Jalalalabon.  Jalalalabon.  Jalalalabon.  Jalalalabon.  Jalalalabon.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Someone get rid of the Heimlich.  I'm choking on my tongue.  11-year-old Gary, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  I just wanted to say, Morden, I worship you. 
[02:24:00]  Thanks, buddy.  All I want to say is, when I get into a car accident, I just want to say to the driver,  I hope you jump into a pool of acid.  Nice.  Nice, there you go.  All right, I just wanted to say, is the retardant Laverne and Shirley in there?  No.  You want to talk to the retardant Laverne and Shirley real fast?  I just want to diss him.  You want to diss him?  Yeah.  That could be fun.  Yeah.  All right.  Lady Diane Marion, uh, quickly.  We'll do this quickly. 
[02:24:30]  This is a child.  You know, Gary, this is 11-year-old Gary.  Gary who?  Hi, Gary.  Hey, Pastor.  Hey, Gary, I heard you on a phony.  I heard you the other day.  You're like an 11-year-old brat that called in.  I heard you.  On Friday, I heard you.  He's only 11 years old.  He's a little brat.  My son is 11 years old.  Gary, what's up?  And your point is?  And my point is?  My son is 11 years old.  Where's your parents?  You're from surgery on your cellulite butt. 
[02:25:00]  Where's your parents?  What?  Where's your mother and father?  Why?  They should smack you upside your head because you sound like a little brat.  Already, fatso.  Like ass.  Like a little twerp.  That's not nice.  A little twerp.  I don't care if it's nice.  You sound like a little twerp.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, we love talking to you, too.  Here, you little brat.  I'm so rich.  Girl, what are you doing? 
[02:25:30]  You should be home watching our cartoon network.  What?  You should be watching cartoons.  You're 11 years old.  No, I shouldn't be.  Why shouldn't you be?  Why?  What are you watching?  Because why?  Shut up, ladies.  What are you watching instead of the cartoons, Gary?  Family Central.  Nice.  South Park.  That's my cartoon.  South Park.  South Park is his cartoon.  Your parents let you watch it?  All I want to say, both of your mamas are so stupid and fat.  When they went to a train station, they saw a train, and they said,  Ooh, Snickers bar. 
[02:26:00]  They picked it up and ate it.  Hey, you're a little brat.  Don't talk about mothers.  Because you know what?  I can talk about your mother.  Oh, shut up.  And I can say one thing.  I can say anything.  Because you're alive in your house.  Sounds like a South Park.  And you're a brat.  And somebody should kick you right up to them.  I think you're jumping to a poor asset.  And you know what?  I guarantee you, you look the same way.  This is a cat that pulled in your shell on Friday, I heard.  I wonder why your husband married you.  Because I think he's just, like, uh, vomiting in bed. 
[02:26:30]  And he goes, goodnight.  And he pulls a bucket out and goes up.  He doesn't do his homework.  Do you go to school?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you what.  What school do you go to?  There's a lot of people in school.  She'll be smacking you up inside your little bratty head.  All right, brat.  Be a little brat.  Don't be smacking, fatso.  Bye.  See you, fatso.  See you, cute little ass.  Oh, please.  Marion, this 11-year-old kid is giving you the business.  He's shredding both of you. 
[02:27:00]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  What do you want me to do?  Curse this little kid out?  I can't curse him out on the radio.  No, don't curse him out.  You know what I mean?  You look the giddy.  Come on, curse me out.  I dare you.  No, you're not supposed to curse him on the radio, you brat.  I don't think you're a little kid.  What?  That's all they got?  No, then what'd they say?  What'd they say?  I couldn't tell her.  She has a mush mouth.  And I still can't believe you were a leather pantser.  I thought they were going to explode instantly and hit somebody in the eye.  A cow-exploding joke. 
[02:27:30]  I like that.  Cow-exploding jokes were always fun.  Marion?  Yeah.  Oh, and I just wanted to say, Marion, you can become Helen Keller soon.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  No one wants to hear a stupid-ass voice.  Nobody.  Nobody.  You shouldn't be on the radio with these guys anyway.  You're a little too young to be listening to these guys.  That's directly, um, it is.  And always your parents, both working. 
[02:28:00]  Maybe your mother's out partying.  Listen.  I don't have to be a beating.  So when I came down there and you said that, I would tell you.  Yeah, that's right.  He has to be a beating.  This is a kid.  It is a kid.  It is.  It is a kid.  And he's 11.  You could tell.  I'm going on 30, silly.  He sounds like he's old.  I'm going on 30 years old, silly.  He's 11 going on 30.  Yeah, 11 going on 30.  I'd be proud to have him as a son.  I believe that.  All right, Gary.  Great.  He's a good boy.  Gary?  Oh, yeah.  I just want to say one day.  What?  I'm just like Snoop Dogg. 
[02:28:30]  I already lost my virginity.  Shut up.  What did he say?  He lost his virginity like Snoop did.  Nice.  All right.  Any final words for Marion and Lady Di?  The guitar of Laverne Shirley.  All right, kid.  You should be spanked on his butt with a bell.  Hey, Marion wants to spank you, Gary.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You should be spanked on his butt with a bell.  I do not want that spank in hand.  He's going and friggin' slobbering me whole.  Where is your mother?  What are you going to be?  I do not want it.  He tries to punch me.  All the staff on my arm will come out and just swallow my head open. 
[02:29:00]  What are you doing on the left?  Listen to this kid.  Yeah, but he does raise a good point.  Marion needs to spend his point there.  What is his point?  Shut up, you stank.  Where did you learn your language at?  What the hell?  What are you going to watch?  Your porno movies?  Two after 12 o'clock?  Yeah, do you do that?  Do you watch porno movies?  Hey.  I can't understand your jibby-jabber.  He sounds like a juvenile delinquent. 
[02:29:30]  He's a good boy.  He's a good boy.  No, he ain't a good boy.  Yes, he is.  When I was 11 years old, I wasn't talking to people like that.  You were too busy eating.  No, I wasn't too busy eating at 11.  I went to school, took my homework, and watched TV.  Thank you, Gary.  No problem, man.  Anytime.  I apologize.  Oh, I'm stalking Patty.  You put her in the chair and you pull the chair, she'll fall and maybe break eight of  her legs.  All of her legs, because she does have eight of them.  Hi, Gary.  All right.  See you, Fat Sorrow.  See you, Ol' B. Anthony. 
[02:30:00]  Gary, I apologize that the return of the burn, Shirley, were mean to you.  Oh, you know what?  I just want to say, L.A., I'm sorry.  Las Vegas.  You're getting a bad impression, L.A.  He's got to go to men.  It's Las Vegas, Gary.  Las Vegas, L.A.  Good night.  I want you to do your homework.  Whatever.  Same place.  Marion, say goodbye to Gary nicely.  You better go to bed.  Go to bed.  I should not go to bed until 11, so shut up.  Do your homework.  Go to church.  Maybe a last summer.  I don't have to go to school today, because you know what holiday it is? 
[02:30:30]  Columbus Day.  I said go to school tomorrow.  No, you said today.  No, tomorrow.  I heard you.  Go to school tomorrow.  And Gary heard you.  Do your homework.  Go to school.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Gary.  All right.  See you, guys.  See you soon.  You'll be staying back for the next five years.  That kid is a classic.  Froy from Jersey says, thank God.  I'd forgotten how funny the word fatso could be.  Isn't that great?  It's so funny.  Hello.  Hello, fatso.  Fatso.  God, was that perfect? 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Lauren, what's up?  He's a fine boy.  I think that that kid should get in your studio and be on the air one day.  He's great.  He is friggin' hilarious.  Yeah.  We might have to find out if he can comment.  All right, Lauren.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Hello, Gary.  Hello, fatso.  He sounds like you're a 11-year-old bratty kid.  God, was that perfect?  Jim, you know him.  No, but if I had a son, I'd be honored if it was him.  He's a fine boy.  Someone is already saying, is that the spawn of Norton?  Rob, what's up?  You're jibber-jabber. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Rob.  I figured out a retard defense system for the planes.  Yeah?  Just put a little pinwheel in the first row and they'll get distracted before they get to the door.  Colorful pinwheel.  Ladies, did not...  Something bright and shiny like a quarter.  They're not talking about you.  They're not talking about you, ladies.  They're talking about the other retard in the plane.  Thank you, Rob.  I want to propose legislation, too.  Thanks, man.  I want to propose legislation.  It may sound mean, but while times are tough when retarded people ride on planes,  I would like them put in a dog cage in a cargo haul. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  Like any other creature that might be disruptive to the crew.  Brian, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I was driving up Nichols Road going on my way to Storybrook to class.  I'd spit coffee all over the place.  Listen to that Tom Brokaw thing.  What would he think of today's youth these days and Norton's effect on them?  The what?  What is that?  I don't know.  Was it your phone?  We couldn't hear you.  Sorry.  I'm driving up Nichols Road.  No, we heard all that.  Yeah, yeah.  We heard that.  What was the last part?  What would Tom Brokaw think of Norton's effect on today's youth? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, on today's youth?  I don't know.  We'll have to have Tom in to ask him.  Yeah, maybe when Tom comes back.  Thank you, Brian.  All right.  Thank you.  My main effect is it makes it harder for them to sit.  Oh, some have been a lot harder.  Amy, what's up?  I just wanted to comment on how ridiculous it is that those two bags of S can't even defend  themselves against an 11-year-old.  Bags of S.  What?  So stupid.  You guys had nothing.  And they can't even realize how retarded they sound. 
[02:33:00]  You play these tapes for them at a later date and they go, oh my gosh.  Well, we know what we sound like.  Bags of S.  Hey, you know what?  We were a lot of fun.  We do this for fun.  I like out of nowhere where you just go, shut up.  That was great.  Shut up.  A lot of these callers that bust aren't chopped, they don't know what fun is.  All right.  Ladies, thank you.  Ladies.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  All right.  Yes. 
[02:33:30]  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to start our radio show next for Las Vegas.  No.  We've got lots of stuff to talk about today.  What happened to Stephen Lynch?  Probably up late.  I can't even get a hold of him.  That's too bad.  All right.  We'll figure it out next.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  Hey, hey, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  What, are you taking a leak?  Yeah.  All right.  We're back with the O&A show.  What a mess today is.  Yeah.  Barely got to anything.  Can you tell we had a long night last night?  Yes, we did.  We did.  We did.  Where was Cowbell Bill?  He had more to add to that story with the retard on the jet.  The story with the retard. 
[02:34:30]  Maybe he'll call back.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just wondering.  Two things.  Number one, Norton, how much money are you paying that kid's mother for child support?  He's great, isn't he?  And number two, retarded Laverne and Shirley, two batches that should have been left on the tissue paper, baby.  Jeez.  You guys suck.  Thank you, man.  All right, bro.  Thanks.  That's out.  Pat, what's going on? 
[02:35:00]  Hey, how you doing?  How are you?  Norton, I just want to know, are you still going to be proud to have that kid as your son when he shows up with mom in a paternity suit in hand?  No, but when he opens fire in his high school, in his trench coat, he'll be again.  And Opie, you ruined Snoop, man.  One conversation with you when he's saying, no siree, Bob.  White-ified him, man.  You guys rock.  Take care.  You broke Snoop.  You broke him.  I think Snoop enjoyed his little conversation with us.  Oh, you know what?  One other question.  Yeah.  When Marion's walking around in Orlando, were people trying to cover her with wet towels and release her back to the wild? 
[02:35:30]  Good job, kid.  Take care.  All right.  Let's go to Cowbell Bill.  What's up, bro?  Hey, what do you say, guys?  How do you?  Hey, Opie, you know how you feel about vacuum cleaners?  Yeah.  That's how I feel about being on hold.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry about that.  Hey, no problem, man.  I was watching the news.  Yeah, this Bosi got into the cockpit.  Bosi.  Right?  Yeah.  Got the pilot in a headlock. 
[02:36:00]  Really?  Yeah.  The co-pilot was trying to pull him off.  Like 13 or 15 passengers jumped on him.  Oh, they did.  Right?  They got him down to the ground.  They gave him, like, multiple shots of Valium.  I'm on drugs.  Wait, Bill, you're not kidding?  He got in the cockpit?  No, I'm not kidding.  I'm watching the news here.  Right.  Oh.  Yeah, it was about 20 minutes ago.  Right.  The kid got into, I don't know, those retard muscles or something.  Got him through the door.  Yeah, the retard strength. 
[02:36:30]  And, yeah.  And, you know, they gave him multiple shots of Valium.  He was just rambling all the way until the plane landed.  Save the Sears Tower.  Save yourselves.  Yes.  Witnesses say the man was shouting, save the tower, save the tower.  Let's see.  Passengers, blah, blah, blah.  The young man was sitting in a coach seat when he suddenly jumped up and ran full speed  to the cockpit door.  The man, believed to be in his 20s, got through the cockpit door, but the pilot managed to force  him back outside.  Several passengers stormed after the suspect, rolled him in a blanket, and subdued him. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, they gave him a blanket party.  Remember, fat boy, it's just a bad dream.  A doctor on board the plane also gave the suspect some medication.  Here's your medicine.  A man, believed to be the suspect's father, was traveling with him.  Oh, my God.  The suspect has a history of mental instability and may have believed the plane was headed  toward the Sears Tower.  Oh, he was helping.  All right.  See, he, in his crazy, nutty, friggin' retard mind, thought the plane was headed toward the 
[02:37:30]  tower.  When the intruder entered the cockpit, the pilot declared an emergency by entering a special  code.  Passengers say the plane jolted.  The man even said he feared for his life, thinking the plane was going down.  One man.  Two F-16s scrambled to intercept, creating a sonic boom.  And they escorted the plane to the airport.  No one was injured, although there are reports a 50-year-old man was taken to the hospital, 
[02:38:00]  suffering from chest pains.  The FBI said, it's possible no charges would be fine.  Yeah, who wants to prosecute a BOCIE?  Could you imagine being on that plane, though?  Unbelievable.  Because you probably wouldn't know right away that it's a retard.  You'd just be like, oh, I am so glad to see, though, the passengers grabbed a...  15 of them.  ...a blanket and rolled him up in it and probably started bunching him silly.  Yeah.  Really?  They love that.  They leave the part about how the gang of passengers beat a retard silly in an airplane. 
[02:38:30]  I love it.  What, they couldn't tell by the Gumby-shaped head and the Walmart eyes?  And the mongoloid hairdo.  And, you know, for the record, even if he's just sitting there quietly, he should be rolled  in a blanket and beaten.  Noise.  That was over the line.  Oh, finally we're over the line?  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Bill.  All right, Ha-Beal.  Talk to you later.  Later, man.  All right.  Jesus, man.  Oof. 
[02:39:00]  Where was the father?  Oh, Hal.  Yo.  What's up?  Not much.  Gary has definitely got to be on your show.  Gary, the 11-year-old.  The 11-year-old.  Yeah.  I've never heard anybody shred two fatzos that bad.  That was funny.  That was great.  We're all imitating Gary outside the studio now.  Great.  Hi, fatso.  Stupid.  Shut up, stupid.  Shut up, shiznitz.  Hey, stupid fatso.  Hello, fatso.  I have one question for you.  Was he French? 
[02:39:30]  Yes, he was.  Jesus.  What's Bin Laden and Pantyhoes have in common?  What?  They both irritate the hell out of Bush.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  That's getting there.  It needs some hammering into place in a couple of areas.  Very good, bro.  That's good.  All right, man.  Thanks, Al.  You guys rock.  All right.  Let's move on to Juice.  Juice, you're next on the ONA show.  ONA was crap-related, man.  Hey, how did we do it, Snoop?  Hey, what happened to Anthony's crash story?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it was no big deal.  Well, it was on the way to the Beacon, Jay's show, and some ass went to go make a left turn. 
[02:40:00]  We're on 6th Avenue, which runs north.  It's a one-way street.  And another one-way street coming off the left.  It was all the way over in the left lane.  Some guy to my right.  Yeah.  No!  I hate that.  Some guy in the lane to my right decides to make the left right in front of us. 
[02:40:30]  And, yeah.  Oh, you hit them?  No.  He turned right into you.  One-way street.  Right.  I'm heading north.  Right.  There is another one-way street that goes west.  Gotcha.  I'm all the way in the left lane.  Gotcha.  So I am going straight.  Right.  That left lane is used for left turns and straight.  Right.  The next lane over to my right is used for straight only.  Right.  You do not make the left from there cutting across the lane that we are going straight in.  Yeah, so all of a sudden it was just, oh, here he goes. 
[02:41:00]  He's turning.  Hello?  But it actually wasn't his fault.  I heard a retard jumped into the front seat.  Is that what happened?  A retarded gentleman jumped in.  Jumped in the window.  And then the cops come, you know.  And he's like, you want to make a report?  He goes, yeah, I'll make a report.  Your insurance will just go up.  And then he goes over to the other guy's car.  Because I walk right up the window.  I go, all right, Dick.  You made a turn right in front of our car.  And he's like, and he's staring at me with this. 
[02:41:30]  I just smoked the biggest joint look on his face.  And then the cops come over and they go, oh, look what we found outside the vehicle.  Picks up a big brown paper bag with a bottle inside of it.  And he goes, I'll take care of these guys.  I was like, I got to get out of here.  I got to go to the beacon.  You know, we were hosting the show.  It was creeping up on 8 o'clock.  So he goes, all right, I'll take care of these guys.  So I don't know what came of that.  But, yeah, nothing big.  It was just more of a pain in the ass.  And now it's a brand new Jeep. 
[02:42:00]  Now it's got to be a brand new Jeep that had repairs done to it.  And they never ride after that.  They never run right after that.  We're trying to drive it back to the garage, back up here.  The steering wheel is looking like I'm making a turn, but it's going straight.  You know, the alignment's all screwed up.  Yeah, so now I got to deal with that.  Thank you.  Thank you, ass wipe.  But, uh, ONA, two more things.  You don't drive drunk.  Do it right.  Go ahead, Juice.  I'd rather have Gary in studio than OD. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, really?  For real.  OD ain't black.  I mean.  No, no, he's Dominican.  Dominican.  I know that, but, I mean, sometimes he's just saying some stupid things, and Gary's cute.  Gary's actually cute.  Cute.  You want to hate him?  Hey, hey, well, yeah.  Hey.  Hey, you want to be my intern?  Hey.  Hey.  I like that Gary child, yes.  Woo!  Reminds me of a young boy I once knew on a spaceship.  Oh, dear.  Woo! 
[02:43:00]  Suppered young 11-year-old buttocks.  Quite a big, delicious mule for a boy.  That is so wrong.  Flop chicken, isn't it?  Dr. Smith, get your hands off that boy.  Shut up, you clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  I need boy ass.  Woo!  Flop chicken.  I love it.  Hairless, hairless boy.  Right, Norton?  You know, yeah.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:43:30]  Always extra money for smooth.  Jesus.  Juice, thank you.  Dr. Smith, slip him some hiv.  I plan to, yes.  What's that, a shanker?  Yeah.  Jesus.  A pussy shanker?  Young boys love that.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Pashizzle, dizzle.  Pashizzle, dizzle.  Yeah.  I learned today that B is a C, and she likes a D and her A. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  Dizzy rule.  All right.  Later, guys.  Awesome.  Thank you.  It might seem like we're playing a lot of commercials today, but we're just playing catch-up.  Yeah.  We went about an hour and ten minutes without playing a commercial, and it really screwed  up the rest of the show.  But thank God we did.  It allowed Patty more time to cry.  So what we're going to do is we're going to take a very quick break, and we're going  to come back and play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show, okay?  Not much today.  Just a few commercials, though, Ben, all right?  Just a few.  Just a couple, all right?  All right.  We'll be back. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, this is Robert Englund here, a.k.a.  Freddy Krueger, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  See, there you go.  Quick break.  Actually, we have four minutes left in the show.  We killed ourselves with commercials today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Quick round of What Did We Learn?  Let's go right to the phones and talk to Turkish.  Turkish, what's up?  Turkish!  Yeah?  Hey, what's up, man?  You've got to go fast. 
[02:45:00]  Let's go.  Hi, I learned, uh, I've learned Earl tried to sound black and talk to each other.  Yeah, I learned it.  Earl?  You learned Earl says baby to seem black.  There you go.  See?  Uh, Aaron, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned two things.  One, I learned that it's foggy when you're next to doggie.  Yeah.  And also, there's no cool way to, uh, Snoop-onics spuds buckley either.  All right, thank you.  Spuds buck.  Oh, no.  Sean, what did you learn today?  Hey, guys, I learned that, uh, word fatso, always funny. 
[02:45:30]  Always.  Fatso.  You rule.  All right, thank you, bro.  Let's go to Virginia.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, I learned today that, uh, for shizzle, dizzle means for sure, dog.  Yeah.  And number two, uh, I forgot what I was going to say, man, but that's what I learned.  For shizzle, dizzle, and, oh, oh, to keep your hose, you gotta get in their head.  Right.  That's right.  All right, thank you, bro.  Lauren, you're next.  What's up?  I learned two things today. 
[02:46:00]  I learned that kids actually do say the darndest things and that you can't feel bad for retarded  stalkers.  Very nice.  Thank you, Lauren.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Cliff.  Cliff, what's up?  Yo, hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  I learned that, uh, Norton likes to lick dog treats off his dad's junk.  Yo, you guys got any more tickets to the, to an LQ show?  Um, I'm looking at Ben.  Me and my girl want to go down and see you guys.  All right, hold on.  Yeah, we're going to be there in a little over a week.  Give Cliff tickets on line seven.  Jacob from Philly. 
[02:46:30]  I learned today, rhinos enjoy Run-DMC.  The U.S. drop TV dinners after Hiroshima and Norton rules.  FN moron.  I learned if you wear Snoop gear, the hoes will take their clothes off.  Black girl is now known as Brother Bobby Earl.  Ying-yang parties are a good reason for drive-by shootings.  Marion's maxi pad looks like an airplane pillow.  And finally, today I learned Las Vegas picked the wrong day to start tuning in to this show.  That is so true.  I learned, uh, let's see, who is this? 
[02:47:00]  Who is this quickly?  Uh, Paul said he learned three black eyes, enough said.  Leo!  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Good show.  It was, uh, it was different.  All right, I learned, uh, Norton's literary allusion is always funny.  Hey, Stinky Rules, but he's no English major.  All right, thank you.  See you.  Matt, I think we've got to end with you.  What's up?  Matt?  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that 11-year-old kid and two fat chicks is really good comedy.  Oh, good.  Yeah, you guys hooked me up with tickets to the Philly show? 
[02:47:30]  Uh, see, I knew this would happen.  Cliff started a trend.  All right, we'll take care of you, though.  All right, thanks a lot.  All right, hold on.  Matt needs tickets for the show, too.  Okay, we've got to get out of here, right?  Yeah.  Oh, man, we messed up this show today.  With the commercials and all that.  I'll do better next time.  I'll do better next time, Barry.  We'll be more gooder tomorrow.  I got regular good hair and good teeth.  I'm a regular make-a-good man.  I'll do better next time. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, boy, chicken.  I'm going to rush the cockpit.  And that's how it ended today.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat-out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Hope you have them today.  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
