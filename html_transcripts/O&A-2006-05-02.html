<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a surprisingly conciliatory message from William Donahue of the Catholic League, wishing the hosts well after a hiatus.  Opie and Anthony then launched into their typical vulgar opening, insulting themselves, James, Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Rock.  A lengthy and graphic discussion about body odors followed, encompassing everything from earwax and belly buttons to "the greasy taint," fueled by numerous caller contributions and comedic exploration of baby wipe usage.

The show then shifted to mocking David Blaine's fishbowl stunt, speculating on potential tricks and digressing into discussions of other magicians like Chris Angel and David Copperfield, including a caller claiming insider knowledge of Copperfield's methods.  The conversation transitioned to *The Sopranos*, focusing on the characters' criminal activities and the arrests of cast members.  The birthday celebrations of security team members "Club Soda Kenny" and "Master Poe" concluded this segment, with Master Poe's catchphrase delivered off-mic.

The next section highlighted the "Assault on the Media" campaign, detailing listener-orchestrated disruptions of live television news broadcasts, including mooning incidents and forcing expletives from anchors.  The hosts discussed the resulting New York Daily News article and the near-firing around Christmas.  The move from XM Satellite Radio to terrestrial radio was discussed, comparing the shift to navigating divorced parents, with Opie sharing childhood anecdotes. Listener calls regarding the campaign and a discussion about a disappointing gift box from WBCN radio in Boston followed.  The segment ended with criticism of a Fox 5 News segment about a child predator sting operation, comparing it unfavorably to similar stings by Dateline and America's Most Wanted. Ben's frequent laughter and No Filter Paul's upcoming appearance (central to Sonny Ferrelli's feud) were recurring elements. "The Potato Diva" and the potato bit were also briefly mentioned.

The following segment began with jokes about a fan sending guns to the studio, and then moved on to John Daly's reported $60 million gambling losses, prompting anecdotes about the hosts' own gambling experiences. Bruce McCulloch of *Kids in the Hall* was then interviewed, discussing his new film, *Comeback Season*, experiences with other celebrities, and work on *Saturday Night Live*.  The conversation included discussions of *Monty Python*, *Benny Hill*, and *Mad Magazine*. Anthony also revealed his admission of adultery in his divorce.  The transition to commercial radio was discussed, highlighting challenges with replays, commercial breaks, and XM's three-hour block constraints.  A disastrous attempt to obtain a birthday cake for staff members in NYC was recounted, including a negative encounter at Mangia bakery.  The segment ended with discussion of listener feedback and future plans, including another No Filter Paul segment.

A segment featuring a fantastical scenario about moving money between studios gave way to a caller, Mr. Old, sharing a humorous story about a midget at a Richard Petty driving experience.  Jimmy Johnson's NASCAR win was attributed to his show appearances.  Listener complaints about XM and CBS replay discrepancies were addressed.  A discussion followed about a Jim Norton line deemed unsuitable for broadcast ("Why are your trousers down and you're sitting on my face?"), prompting an exploration of FCC violations.  The "no homo" promo, a humorous PSA, was featured.  Eddie Superstar called in with a life update.  An email from New Zealand white supremacists mistaking Anthony for a Nazi was discussed, followed by a gift basket from Dr. Steve.

Carlos Mencia joined the show, discussing his "The Punisher Tour" and sparking a lengthy, highly offensive discussion about illegal immigration, filled with vulgar jokes and controversial opinions.  The hosts and Mencia discussed family financial burdens, and several callers contributed to the immigration debate.  Further humorous and offensive banter concluded this segment.

The following segment also focused on immigration, particularly Mexican immigration.  The hosts jokingly suggested Mexico attack the US to solve the problem before shifting to a discussion about Mexican protests compared to those in African-American communities.  The "Immigrant Day" protests and the use of Spanish in public spaces were discussed. A caller recounted a story about easily crossing the US-Canada border by boat.  Carlos Mencia was in studio, discussing his Comedy Central show and financial struggles.  A gift of meat from Ralphie May led to more comedic banter.  Discussions of language barriers, cultural assimilation, and low-skill jobs for immigrants followed.  A rambling discussion about Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco was interspersed with more jokes. A comedic bit in English and Spanish and final calls ended the segment.  The segment was heavily laced with offensive language and provocative humor.

A final segment centered around audio clips of Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco, with crude and sexually explicit commentary from the hosts and possibly Bonnie Teagle.  Listener calls from various locations punctuated the segment.  Carlos Mencia remained in studio.  A discussion about a potential Fisher/Buttafuoco pornographic film ensued.  A listener shared a story about his girlfriend's obsession with Jimmy Norton.  An offensive advertisement for AIDS as a weight-loss method concluded the segment. The segment maintained the showâ€™s irreverent tone, filled with profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

[00:01:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up.  You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounce back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do?  Just sit around here and lambate O.B. and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people.  You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well.  I just wish you well.  Wish you well.  Wish you well.  Push the button.  Push the button.  Push the button.  Push the button. 
[00:02:30]  No.  Can you hear me?  No.  Shut up.  Me and Anthony.  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  O.B.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James. 
[00:03:00]  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We're like Chucky.  Martini Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating food that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. 
[00:03:30]  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Maniacal laugh.  Uh, it never gets old, though.  Every morning, I love hearing that.  Demonic.  Martini Steve laughing his ass off.  Yeah.  Uh, the rage is still too low.  Every morning, we gotta tell people the rage is too low.  Really? 
[00:04:00]  It's way too low.  Wasn't it too loud yesterday?  And then we were trying to yell over it.  No, it started too, it started too low, then it went too loud, and then went back.  It's, you need a dynamic.  See, people gotta understand radio.  The Rage Against the Machine thing is like, oh my god, they're there, and they're ready  to broadcast.  It's dramatic.  Time to rock.  But if you have it, you know, low in the mix, so low in the background, then you might  as well not play it at all.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It needs to just hit you hard.  Bam!  Listen. 
[00:04:30]  There it goes.  Thank you.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program, the ONA virus spreading across America, thanks  to XM Satellite Radio.  I can't hear you.  The music's...  What?  It's...  Now they lowered it.  Uh, and of course, we're on, uh, on, uh, some commercial radio stations as well.  Of course.  In some fine cities like New York, Philly, Boston, Cleveland, West Palm Beach, Dallas.  Dallas and Pittsburgh, right?  Pittsburgh.  All right. 
[00:05:00]  Uh, how's your mic, uh?  Ugh.  Smelling this one.  Ugh.  Oh, not too much.  Oh yeah, you need a lot.  Yeah?  What does that do to the electronics?  I don't care.  It helps the nose.  That's all I care about.  Well, good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Can you scrape your tongue and smell it?  No.  Scrape your tongue with your fingernail and smell it.  Because you can imagine that on the microphone.  There's some really, like, heinous parts of your body that if you scratch and sniff, it's 
[00:05:30]  going to smell bad.  You can't believe it comes from your body, right?  Yeah, perhaps right after you come out of the shower, everything's fine and dandy.  But there are certain things, and I don't know why people feel compelled to smell them.  Like, if you, if you, you, you got an itchy ear and you stick your finger in your ear and  you scratch around a little, people are compelled to then, you know.  Oh, that's it.  That's an easy smell.  What?  That's an easy one.  It's sort of...  The tongue is really bad. 
[00:06:00]  What about when you have...  But I've never scratched my tongue.  Huh?  I've never scratched my tongue.  You brush it in the morning.  Oh, yeah.  You know, with the toothbrush.  Yeah, but then you got to smell the toothbrush.  No.  Yeah.  Stop it.  You do not smell your toothbrush.  No.  Because that's, that's a little off.  I just check out all the, the nice brown goodness that comes off my tongue every morning  and I scrape it.  I'm like, man, am I smoking in the, in the middle of the night or something?  What's the, it looks like nicotine or something.  Oh, what the hell happens in the middle of the night that just gacks your mouth up with 
[00:06:30]  like brown?  Everything just festers and stews.  Bacteria just having a party in there.  You're making body stew.  Body stew.  All over.  Because, you know, with this stupid morning radio thing, I, I attempted the old take a  shower before I go to bed thing.  At night.  And, you know, it doesn't really matter, but we have meetings and stuff after we broadcast.  So, you, you got to kind of, you know, look fresh for people.  You need good hygiene.  If we just did this show and went right home, I, I don't think I would shower. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I would just come in here.  But, uh, so I, I, I did the, you know, the shower before I went to bed thing.  But like you said, man, whatever it goes on at night, you wake up and you're like, I, I  showered last night.  You're just, yeah, stewing in your own juices.  You're sauteing.  How about a little piece of sushi that might be stuck in between your teeth?  Comes out when you're brushing.  Comes out a couple of days later.  Oh.  A couple of days?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  That could really work.  Sometimes.  A couple of stench. 
[00:07:30]  Well, you got to get the dental floss going and you, and you pop out that piece that's  been in there a while.  That's a, that's a bad one.  That's worse than the tongue.  I got one place in the right side of my mouth between like my molar and the other one.  That's exactly where I get it.  Where I get like a little gap.  I know I have to rinse right after, otherwise I'm going to be pulling it out a week later.  You got to pay attention to that area.  Yeah.  A piece of rotted meat.  Yeah.  That'll happen though when you're brushing in the morning and something you ate maybe  right before you went to bed just comes flying out of your mouth.  What?  That was just hanging out in there all night long? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Ugh.  You're going to scrape your scalp and smell it?  No.  That's not a bad smell, is it?  No, but it's just awful.  It's like grandmother's head smell.  You kiss your grandmother on the head, she's got that scalp smell.  Well, that's because parts of her body are dying already.  I know.  That's really disgusting.  It's true though.  Translucent skin.  That's true.  You can see her pulse, the visible woman.  That's all that is.  Parts of the body have already decided to die.  It's dying off in sections.  Of course.  That's what happens. 
[00:08:30]  But everyone knows about the inner thigh area.  I mean really inner thigh, where it pretty much meets your body.  And you've got to give the scratch in between there.  And sometimes other things get itchy, and you need the thumb and forefinger roll, where  you just squeeze and roll your thumb and forefinger together, and you feel like a dog scratching  it.  Oh.  What about when you do that, and you're rolling up little pieces of dough? 
[00:09:00]  See?  That's disgusting.  That usually happens after an event.  And then my favorite that we haven't discussed is the old belly button.  I try to steer clear of that at all costs.  In the shower, the washcloth goes in, you know.  Oh, really?  You clean it out.  I wash my belly button maybe once a month.  And every once in a while, I'll get an itch in there.  And then I'll go back to doing what I'm doing.  I'm like, what's that smell?  And then you realize, oh, it's on my index finger? 
[00:09:30]  When you open it up and you realize it looks like someone's poured asphalt in there, it's  just what has turned black inside there.  Time to wash.  There you go.  Time to scrub.  Of course, the upper part of the crack, if you're a working man, and you scratch there  and pull out a bunch of lint, that can't be any good either.  And all this happens while you sleep.  Yeah.  The eye goo, the nose clogs up. 
[00:10:00]  Just you're growing like a chia pet, laying in bed with stuff just festering on you.  Because I do the shower the night before.  Because I have to.  There is no way in hell I am getting up earlier than I do to take a shower.  So I do it the night before.  And then you go into the bathroom and you've got to kind of wash up.  Defeats the purpose.  It's so gooey.  Yeah.  You've got to make sure your sheets are clean. 
[00:10:30]  Because if you shower the night before and you just get into a filthy protein stained bed.  You can't be laying around in that muck.  Let's go to Mike in Baltimore.  Mike, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Mike.  Hey, I wanted to know if you guys ever had a greasy taint.  A greasy taint?  Yeah.  It's a bug between your nether regions.  Yeah.  Everyone knows what the taint is, sir.  It smells like pure poo.  The taint the front, the taint the back, just kind of sits there. 
[00:11:00]  But why is it getting all greasy?  I don't know.  I think there may be a seepage problem.  Yeah, you've got major problems, my friend.  All right, Mike.  We're going to go right to Philly and say hi to Shane, listening to us on WYSP.  Shane, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  All right.  I had a bad story.  I was laying down and I picked my belly button.  And I rolled over and put my hand around my girlfriend.  And all of a sudden, she's like, what the hell is that smell?  I'm like, oh, oh, God. 
[00:11:30]  And I had to go wash my hands afterwards, guys.  It's embarrassing.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I got to get my stupid comforter washed.  I looked at it this morning because I was like, I don't usually make my bed.  Ugh.  Really?  It looks like modern art.  That's not healthy looking.  Well, you're a pervert.  That did I.  You're a disgusting man.  It happens to anybody who's, you know.  No, you got to clean up after certain events, whether you're alone or with somebody else.  You got to clean up and you can't use your bedding. 
[00:12:00]  No, no, no.  You can't use your bedding.  I don't mean like it's not that bad.  It's just like, oh, wow.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Let's go down to Virginia.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah.  You know, man, you have to get that sweat behind your ears and it smells like a doo-doo.  Well, Rich Voss has that problem.  It's some kind of cyst that was back there.  And he rubs behind his ear and it smells like dumpster juice and death.  It's really bad.  Rich hasn't been on this part of the show yet, right?  No.  Oh, my God.  We're going to have to get some listeners in here to take a whiff of what's going on behind 
[00:12:30]  Rich Voss's ear.  You're not going to believe it.  If you're dirty, if you haven't showered in a couple of days and you rub behind your  ear, yeah, because of hair grease and whatever else kind of grows, it's going to not smell  too good.  Right.  Let's go to Blinky or Binky.  Binky and Yonkers, what's up?  Yo, Dreamweaver, surgeon, what's going on?  What's up, Binky?  Hey, man.  Yo, you have to use the baby wipe in the front and the back.  You'll be with the girl.  We have discussed this many times on Satellite, on XM. 
[00:13:00]  I have totally taken, I have total faith in the baby wipe.  It's actually not even baby wipes anymore.  They make wipes for adult use now in the bathroom.  We all discovered on this show baby wipes when they were still called baby wipes.  Right.  But now it's like it's taken over the world that you don't have to buy baby wipes.  They just call them something else like, I don't know.  Yeah, well, everyone puts them out.  Charmin puts them out. 
[00:13:30]  Scott Tissue.  They all have their own brand, but it's the same thing.  It's some kind of cooling, alloy wipe that you use after, after you're done going.  And boy, if there was ever a problem, especially if you're a working guy and you're out on the  job site and you go, it gets sweaty and nasty and kind of chafed and you don't want that.  That baby wipe cleans it right up and you can walk. 
[00:14:00]  You don't feel any guise, guise going on.  No rash.  No nothing.  Those things are a godsend.  Thank you.  You do the baby wipes.  Yo, you got to do the front though too, bro.  What do you mean the front?  Stop.  You can't do the front.  I'm talking about when you're about to be with a girl and you don't want to smell.  You know what I'm saying?  How about just cleaning up?  No.  Baby wipe, man.  I'm telling you, you got to clean it nice.  Yeah, just wipe up the whole area.  The whole thing.  Yeah, why not?  Just lather it all up.  Why not?  The inner thigh, everything. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  All right, Becky.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Baby wipe smells awful.  Well, the baby wipe is, but the other ones, they're kind of like-  They're made for adults.  Alcohol.  Once they evaporate, it doesn't leave it.  Exactly.  You don't want alcohol there.  It's bad for you.  It dries your skin out.  It's not healthy.  No, but there's also an aloe thing in there.  Oh, it's magical, Jimmy.  They got it all figured out.  They got the baby wipes all figured out for adults.  Strippers use it.  That's what strippers use.  Strippers stink.  I mean, they use that, you know, just to stay clean for lap dances and stuff.  You got to give them something. 
[00:15:00]  When they just put that perfume on, strippers stink.  Theoretically, too.  They're just irritating.  Yeah.  Lap dances.  Aren't they?  They're awful.  It was great growing up and getting yourself, you know, in a strip club when you were a  kid, when you could sneak in, do something like that.  But nowadays, they are just the most annoying thing on two legs.  They don't even do what they used to do.  I remember growing up on Long Island.  It was great.  You could pop into a strip club in the middle of the afternoon and just get like, you know, 
[00:15:30]  they'd take some chances, pull the bottoms off.  They'd be some Long Island whore from somewhere in Ronkonkoma.  Just awful.  And it was great.  It was just like old school baseball.  Right.  They took all sorts of chances.  All kinds of chances.  They didn't care if like the alcohol, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms comes in.  Right.  They don't care.  Oh, they had no problem using the pine tar.  Yeah.  You know, occasionally they'd give the slip of the G-string over so you could see a lot 
[00:16:00]  more than they were allowed to show.  And then it got to a point where all of a sudden it's just Russian girls now looking  to just rape you for your cash.  It used to be for a buck, a simple dollar.  A girl would walk on the bar.  You'd be able to chug your beer down and she'd be right in front of you showing you.  And now it's just, you know, $20 I give to you the love.  I make to you the good love for the $20.  And you don't even get half of what you got back at your normal neighborhood strip club. 
[00:16:30]  Horrid.  They do that.  What's happened?  They've turned into a bunch of corn balls.  Like they do that when they lap dance you, they do that stupid bend over and the corny  like theatrical slap on their own ass.  There's nothing sexy about that.  They do the bend over.  They look over their shoulder at you and then smack their ass.  And it's like, just stop it.  Yeah, beat it with that stupid.  Stop.  And then who doesn't like the hair job? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, it looks like they're going in for the good one.  And all they do is wave their hair up and down on your pants while some big bruiser is  looking at you like, if you even touch her, you're dead.  Yeah, that's a nice sexy atmosphere.  She's talking about how back when I was in Russia, before I come here, I was nuclear physicist.  Now I'm dancing.  You know, Russia was so much better than United States.  Shut up, whore.  Take your clothes off. 
[00:17:30]  That is the best.  We used to talk about it like it was Africa and it would just lay a piece of meat out  there, but you can't have the meat.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Back in the old days, the day strippers.  We're just getting warmed up.  We got a lot to do, so we should take our first break so we can really get into the Opie  and Anthony program.  Give to me the money.  I will give to you the hot love.  No, you won't.  We have to talk about David Blaine when we get back.  We made the New York Daily News. 
[00:18:00]  Ooh.  The reference star, Assault on the Media campaign.  We'll get into that.  Ah, remember that trouble?  We got the sex offenders on Fox 5.  Now it's down to Fox 5.  Fox 5 is now ripping off Dateline.  Dateline and America's Most Wanted.  Ripped off Dateline and now Fox News decided to get in on it because it's so popular to  trap pedos.  Eventually MTV will be doing this.  You watch.  Why not?  I think we should do it.  MTV Cribs, but it'll be a whole different show.  Let's do it from the other angle, though.  Jesus Christ, come on. 
[00:18:30]  What?  I said MTV Cribs, but it'll be a whole different show.  All right, relax.  That's hysterical.  Let me tell you what happened there.  It's too early for you.  It was a great line, and I'm sure people out there are laughing.  We just weren't paying attention.  We weren't paying attention.  That's all.  And I know, and I point that out sometimes.  But it's not about us laughing.  They're laughing out there somewhere.  They're enjoying it.  It is about you laughing.  It gives me the will to continue.  They enjoyed it.  All right.  Don't be so paranoid.  They were out there laughing at you or laughing with you, I should say.  All right.  Also, news. 
[00:19:00]  Not in a dog, Alice.  I heard him, Ralph.  News teases on the way.  You have no sense of humor.  News teases on the way.  Also, Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco from Entertainment Tonight last night.  Yeah.  We'll get into this whole thing, but I'm convinced that Amy would bang Joey no problem.  You know she lives.  No problem.  She lives right down the street from my mommy in my mommy's gated community.  Yeah.  In the same gated community?  Yeah, right down the road. 
[00:19:30]  A few houses down.  Amy Fisher.  And your mom's a hot tamale, man.  Be careful.  Watch.  Don't open that door.  Don't open that door.  There you go.  Hi, Anthony.  Well, we'll get into all of that.  Oh, my mommy's sounding like that.  We'll get into all of that and your phone calls as well.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello.  Hi, Mom. 
[00:20:00]  Hi, Mom.  Mom, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Whew.  Finally.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  You're checking out the Opie virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE if you want to get a hold of us. 
[00:20:30]  Lots going on here in New York today.  David Blaine start his ridiculous stunt in the big fishbowl.  Is he just doing this or is it a trick?  Come on.  Someone's got to know.  Yeah, I don't know.  Is there any maybe magicians out there that can help us out?  Isn't Penn on this whole thing?  Yes.  Isn't Penn on Free FM?  Can't someone call him and say, is this a trick or what?  Because I don't know.  It seems like he's just lying in a tank of water. 
[00:21:00]  He's got an oxygen tank, a tube.  And apparently he was sleeping, which seems a little odd.  Yeah, they're showing him on TV right now just sleeping at the bottom of the oversized goldfish bowl.  Big goldfish bowl.  He gets in the thing and he's going to stay in there for like a week.  And then for the grand finale in chains and handcuffs, 120 pounds of chains and handcuffs, he's going to.  By the way, when did he add that to the stunt?  Just today or yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  Because he knows everyone's like, yeah, whatever.  A little lackluster.  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to hang out for a week again and we're all going to buy into this?  Yeah.  Remember when he was in London in a box, a glass box above the city for a week?  Throwing things at it?  Yeah.  Who cares?  What was impressive about that?  And then in the block of ice, which was proven to be one of the easiest things you could do.  Scam.  Because, you know, the space between your body and the actual block of ice is enough room to keep you warm, like an igloo effect.  And they were blowing some warm air in there. 
[00:22:00]  So this has to be some kind of trick as well.  So he's in this goldfish bowl with some oxygen.  And I don't know.  I guess he could strap it to his head when he's sleeping or else maybe pops out.  You know, that'll be a wake-a-rupper.  And then, yeah, 120 pounds of chains a week later and some handcuffs.  And then he's going to get himself out of that after eight minutes with no air.  Or nine minutes, something like that.  Nine minutes.  He's going for the record.  Going for the record.  And there's guys that take this record very, very seriously. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  So, you know, if he fakes it, we're all going to know.  Because there's record holders.  Uh-huh.  You know, people take pride in the fact they can hold their breath underwater longer than anyone.  So if he just, you know, scams everybody, I think these guys are going to have a lot to say about that.  How would you scam it?  Like, I don't know.  I hate magicians.  Well, there's got to be something.  Obviously, it's a trick.  They don't do this stuff, really.  I mean, did he prepare his skin to live in water for a week?  Yeah.  That's got to wrinkle you up.  And I think he should do it old school. 
[00:23:00]  Once again, we were talking about this yesterday.  You know, how does he go to the bathroom?  Well, he's fasted for a couple of weeks, he said.  So he doesn't have to do that.  And then they've inserted a catheter so he can do that without messing up the water.  Why?  He's in the water.  That's the beauty of being in the water.  That's what I mean.  How great would that be?  They should just do it, you know, look, you're in there.  You have to go.  You got to go.  Make sure the water turns orange or something when he goes. 
[00:23:30]  A week from now, he's just swimming in stew.  So we could all just point and laugh at him.  Yeah.  And if he has to go number two, so he goes number two.  You can't even see him.  That would be much more entertaining.  Then you got people checking it out going, how is he living in all of that mess?  Would that be funny or would it be good if, you know, he's been fasting so he really doesn't  have to go if just one slipped out and it's just floating around the tank with him?  You know what I would do as a goof? 
[00:24:00]  Just release a Baby Ruth bar.  Baby Ruth in there?  Give him the old Caddyshack?  Or a toaster.  That'd be nice.  Plugged in toaster.  Well, here are the facts.  We'll spend the next week in Waterfield Plastic Sphere in Lincoln Center.  Two tubes, one for oxygen and one for using the bathroom.  And the oxygen also gives him liquid nutrients.  So he's eating too?  He's eating.  He's drinking some kind of liquid supplement.  He shouldn't be allowed to eat. 
[00:24:30]  Of course you need the air.  And that's it.  Yeah.  Live in the fishbowl for a week.  Here's your air.  No nutrients.  Yeah, well.  If you gotta go, you gotta go.  Or if you want food, they should sprinkle it on the top of the tank and you have to go  up and get it yourself.  It's your mouth.  These world record things are so stupid.  Like when you do a world record, you know, Guinness Book of World Records allows you like  a break every hour.  Yeah.  You know, name one of these dumb things where you have to stay awake for a certain amount 
[00:25:00]  of time.  But they allow you five minutes.  They've made, you know, setting records so easy.  Yeah.  So you get like a five minute break every hour.  So then people, you know, collect their five minutes over a course of many, many hours  and then take a really, really nice snooze in the middle of a record where you're trying  to stay awake for hours on end.  You're sleeping.  Yeah.  You're sleeping.  That's the whole purpose.  It's stupid.  Like the longest kiss people just make out for 17 hours.  How disgusting.  Just standing there with their lips touched together. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  That dumb face.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Well, here's where it gets dramatic.  Air will be cut off next Monday.  He'll spend eight to nine minutes trying to escape 150 pounds of metal chains.  You think he's going to be able to do it?  I hope so.  You think he's going to be able to do it?  Stun will be broadcast live on ABC at 8 p.m. Monday.  And the world record for holding your breath is eight minutes and 58 seconds.  So he's going for that record.  We've got that one.  Just missed.  His lungs must have been ready to explode.  Yeah.  Thinking he got nine. 
[00:26:00]  58 seconds.  So, and some of his other previous stunts were just terrific.  I got to tell you.  Buried alive in a glass coffin.  Unbelievable.  I remember that.  Oh, no, I don't.  I saw him, actually, when he was there.  Really?  What?  I looked down at him for a few minutes.  When he was in that coffin, it was behind, like, the Trump buildings.  He wasn't really buried.  He was in a glass coffin, and you could walk and look right down at him, like, oh, there  he is, right there.  You're not really buried.  Over the top?  Was it open, you mean?  Yeah, so you could see what he's doing.  So he was in a glass coffin, and then there was another piece of glass or something. 
[00:26:30]  That's all it was.  Oh, over the top?  Yeah, so he could, and water in between, right?  Yeah.  But once again, go old school.  Get one of these really old graveyards, and if you want to be buried alive, then let's  bury you alive.  I think people that have tried that haven't made it.  There's been a couple of guys that haven't pulled through that one.  Remember the famous video?  Yeah, glass coffin.  Put him in the ground.  They were going to cover it with cement, and they poured cement in there, and of course,  the glass coffin couldn't hold the cement, and it collapsed, and they're trying to dig 
[00:27:00]  him out.  You know what it's like trying to dig wet cement?  And yeah, that guy died.  The whole thing collapsed on him.  There's video?  Where's the video?  It was, I don't know.  They show it on TV here and there.  Yeah, all you see is like a big bloop.  You just see like an air bubble come out of the cement.  And then the tractor and stuff, all the heavy equipment came in to try to save him, and  he was way dead.  Gone.  And then, you know, he stood on a pillar in Bryant Park for 35 hours.  That's got to be tough. 
[00:27:30]  Standing on a pole.  Just for 35 straight hours.  Yeah.  Standing, laying in a coffin.  These are unbelievable stunts, I've got to tell you.  Frozen in ice in Times Square.  That was the biggest, hackiest one he's done.  Yeah.  And then suspended over the river there in London for 44 days.  And that one, see, because they're not as polite overseas.  They just trashed him.  He's at him.  They started throwing eggs and everything else at him, because they know he's a hack.  Yeah.  But in America, we're going to be parading by this sphere for the next week going, oh 
[00:28:00]  my God, he's our Harry Houdini.  I believe they called him a wanker over there.  Yeah, they just were like.  A wanker.  They were like, go away with your stupid stunts.  Yeah.  These are awful.  So that's going on, and everyone's excited.  Are they?  Really?  Yeah, the local TV, it's got to be a big thing, because the weather guy is doing his  weather reports in front of David Blaine in the sphere.  Yeah, a lot of the news guys are down there doing their stand-ups for the weather and  little things.  Hey, we're down here in front of the David Blaine sphere, and let's tell you what the  weather's going to be. 
[00:28:30]  Is David going to have to worry about rain?  Ha ha.  David's going to need his umbrella tonight.  Shut up.  Stupid.  Other men.  Other men.  Can we get a magician on the phone to explain what the big deal is here?  Yeah.  Is he actually in there?  Or did they do the old switcheroo somehow?  It'll be the magician's code.  We'll never know.  No, that's the beauty of-  They don't tell each other.  No, that's the beauty.  You got the-  The rats?  Yeah, you got the guys out there that have no problem telling the- 
[00:29:00]  A couple of rats?  How every trick is done.  I like those guys.  Ever hear of Chris Angel?  Of course.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, did you ever-  I was just going to say, did you ever hear of that guy, Chris Angel, Mind Freak?  No, what's he do?  He's got a TV show on.  Why would we have heard of him?  Yeah, but he gets buried alive and whatnot, and he's actually buried under this cemetery,  and he crawls out of the ground.  Yeah, he doesn't seem as hacky.  We had him on our show in Vegas a few months back, and he's a really cool guy, and his stuff 
[00:29:30]  is a little more impressive, I have to tell you.  I don't know.  I think all of his stuff is fake.  I don't know.  I just can't buy into a lot of it.  Well, all this stuff is fake, but it's how you pull it off.  I mean, to me, David Blaine hanging out in an oversized fishbowl, just laying at the  bottom, sleeping, that's not impressive, but Chris Angel, like this guy says, crawling  out of the actual earth, that's a little more dramatic.  He did- I saw one show where he had- it was in Vegas.  It was- I don't know if it was a real audience or if they're plants, but it looked like he 
[00:30:00]  was floating in midair in front of this, like on the strip somewhere, which is kind  of impressive.  I would like to see how they do that.  A lot of that is done with plants.  Okay.  I mean, you know, not plants.  Yeah.  That would be silly if he was doing it in front of a rhododendron or something, but it  was, yeah, they have people that are in on it.  They've shown how this is also done on television.  When you see it on TV, don't believe any of it because it's all done with camera trickery  and then the people there are in on it. 
[00:30:30]  And sometimes they actually have people from the crowd that come up and they amaze them  with some other trick to get their face reaction.  And then they cut that in to the fake trick that he's doing.  So he does the fake trick and they go to the crowd shot and everyone goes, oh, and meanwhile,  all he did was a card trick.  I don't believe it.  It's a lot of editing being done.  David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear.  David Copperfield.  I wish he did for real.  Her and her stupid book that welcomes everybody. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  They should really kind of scratch that off a little bit.  Oh, please.  We brought a rewrite.  We broadcast in Vegas like once a year and the last two years or the last two seasons,  whatever.  You know, I would try.  I try to go see a show when I'm in Vegas and I saw some of that.  I saw some of that Cirque du Soleil, which was amazing.  Cirque du Soleil.  Or whatever.  Right.  Yeah.  I can't pronounce it, but man, is it awesome.  And then this year.  This isn't a circus.  Right.  And then this year they had David Copperfield in the hotel we stayed at. 
[00:31:30]  So I'm like, I got to go see David Copperfield.  Was he there?  Really?  Very interesting.  Who knows?  Was he calling it in from somewhere else?  Ooh.  He is the biggest freaking hack and I never realized it.  Never updated his act.  Does he have to?  The first 15 minutes of David Copperfield is all these TV clips and his appearances on  all these talk shows.  So it's 15 minutes of him talking about himself.  David Copperfield.  And showing the audience how great he is and how all these sitcoms have referenced him 
[00:32:00]  over the years.  I like the Simpsons.  Simpsons, Seinfeld, you name it.  All of them is going, what are you, David Copperfield?  Oh, that's terrific.  A whole montage of how great he is.  Yeah.  And then his stuff.  I'm not, we don't have enough time to get into it, but just so freaking hacky.  I was like the, he's like the old school of the new generation.  Yeah.  Remember?  Because when they came out, they were like the new magicians that were kind of separate  from the old Ed Sullivan type magicians, very flamboyant and flashy. 
[00:32:30]  But now that's just old and hack and everyone makes fun of it.  Now kind of the street magician is in like David Blaine.  And he does his fishbowl thing.  I'm a big fan of Doug Henning, the way he would make T-cells disappear.  Let's go to Nancy.  He's wearing a suit and now he's wearing a tattered robe.  Let's go to Nancy in Yonkers.  Nancy, what's up?  About a week ago, Pat Gillette was talking about David Blaine and said he's friends with 
[00:33:00]  David Blaine, but that this whole business is a trick and that it was T-celler who can  hold his breath for that length of time.  Really?  Yeah, about, it was a good two weeks ago before you guys were on the air.  T-celler can hold his breath?  Yeah, it's T-celler who does it.  When is T-celler going to talk?  We stop already.  Nancy, thanks for adding absolutely nothing to the subject at hand.  I greatly appreciate it.  She didn't enlighten us at all.  Nothing.  You gave us nothing. 
[00:33:30]  She's a magician.  She made the excitement that we were having for this show today disappear right before  our eyes.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Chris in New Jersey, then we're going to move on.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen A?  Hey, it's Lebanon.  Hey, I'm glad you guys are back on the air.  Oh, we're waiting for a damn year.  All right.  Yes.  All right, well, basically, I just wanted to say, like, about David Copperfield.  Yeah, that guy, he sucks, man.  I worked on one of his shows at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.  And, like, basically, I was in charge of, like, putting a lot of the props together. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, aren't you supposed to sign a disclaimer saying you're not going to yap about it?  Oh, I don't care, man.  I'm like the dude on the show.  I'm like, I'll tell you all the tricks.  All right.  All right.  Give us something.  No, I was just like, I don't know.  It's like he would do all his tricks, but tell stories over this big screen.  And, like, one of them was like he was going to make his car from his, like, childhood appear in the air.  And it was like this fake plaster car, like, on a track and stuff. 
[00:34:30]  And, you know, I put it together.  I put it together.  I put it together.  So it's supposed to be levitating in the air and it's on a track?  Yeah.  And it's like on this hydraulic lift or whatever.  And it's like part of it's behind the curtain.  Yeah.  It's too many people involved.  I actually saw that bit in Vegas.  Yeah.  It was so dramatic.  The car, what, his grandfather always wanted or something appeared on stage.  And here it is.  Like, ta-da.  My God, it's the car.  And it's floating. 
[00:35:00]  How does he do it?  So the car weighs, what, maybe five pounds?  Yeah.  It just looks like it's a real heavy machine.  Fiber glass or something.  Right.  Nice guy.  I want to make your grandfather appear so you can hug him and tell him you love him.  Go for the car.  Yeah, really.  Self-centered ass.  You're a hell of a magician.  Exactly.  And, Chris, aren't there look-alikes?  Like, there's guys that look like him so that when he disappears from a suspended cage,  it's really some guy that's kind of dressed like him.  Yeah, I think I saw some guy walking around behind the curtains that, like, kind of looks like maybe his, like, Mexican uncle or something. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  Well, thank you.  What do you tell people you do for a living?  Like, you ever see David Copperfield?  Yeah.  When he disappears, like, the guy that, like, puts his face out?  Yeah.  That's me.  That's me.  Yeah.  You're the guy who does that for three seconds and gets no credit for it?  Let's go to Dan in Albany.  Dan?  Hey, how about David Copperfield getting mugged the other day in Vegas?  Yeah, but he actually did a sleight of hand trick and didn't lose his money.  You got to respect that.  Yeah, I would like to see him disappear from a pistol whipping. 
[00:36:00]  That would have been better.  Yeah, watch his teeth disappear.  The guy knocks his molars out and yells, ta-da, while he bleeds from the gums.  Yeah, he pulled his pocket out to show that he had nothing in there.  Yeah.  And then he went for the other pocket.  Yeah.  And with sleight of hand, he moved his wallet to the pocket that he had just showed the crook.  So then he pulls his pocket out of the other side of his pants and goes, see, I don't have anything.  Meanwhile, his assistant's being beaten and raped by four other guys.  And he's doing card tricks. 
[00:36:30]  Look, it's my license.  It's some business cards.  It's all gone.  You know, you should have your skull cave.  Pulls a quarter from the crook's ear.  Ooh.  Punches him in the face.  Michelle, what's up?  Hi.  How are you guys?  Hey, Michelle.  Hi.  Hi.  I just wanted to say, I've been, you know, an XM listener and a subscriber.  I followed you guys all along, so it's been great.  So I just realized something that I love it.  If I miss something on FM, all I got to do is switch my steering wheel controls back to 202 and I catch anything I didn't miss. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, because of the delay or something?  I'm sorry?  I don't know.  You're going over her head.  I know what you're saying.  Yes, it's the thing with the delay thing.  Oh, okay.  Delay.  Right.  That's good.  It's almost like we're TiVo'd.  All right.  Thank you, Michelle.  Let's say hi to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve?  Yeah, that was a great story.  I really do.  Good point, Steve.  That really was awful.  You know, guys, if I miss this, I can listen to the XM thing in here.  Can you?  I got to tell you, we love a lot of phone calls during our show, but so far, it's a little shaky. 
[00:37:30]  We've had a good one.  I like the guy that told us about the David Copperfield floating car.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  That was a good call.  And now we got Steve from Faggot, New Hampshire.  What's up, Steve?  Not pretty much.  Pretty boring here, but I got to have a dad.  You guys are getting a lot of attention, though, man.  That's where the gay mobsters go.  It really is looking like a gay state on The Sopranos, my friend.  So they could have their Brokeback Mountain moment.  Oh, I don't know how to quit you.  Can you imagine all the men up there like, oh, great, great. 
[00:38:00]  The Sopranos are making my state.  Making the whole state look gay.  Making my state look like the gay state.  Yeah.  There's a good make-out this week.  Come on.  Doing the lean in, the eye contact.  Their heads both tilted the right way.  You know, they went a little too hot and heavy on that scene there with the shirts coming off.  It just wasn't necessary.  I mean, I don't need a rod.  I'm trying to watch television. 
[00:38:30]  A well-built fellow.  They are really pouring on the gay with Vito.  Yeah.  Someone call me when the gay stuff is done and they get back to, like, a real mobster storyline.  Where's Polly Walnut been?  Sensitive.  I don't know.  This season is getting a lot of mixed reviews.  Polly Walnut.  Oh.  And everyone's getting arrested, too.  You got Artie in the paper today.  He got arrested.  And who else?  You got the bodyguard got arrested.  Yeah, the one that Tony beat up.  The big brawny guy, right? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  He got arrested for breaking and entering or something.  Yeah, you're on The Sopranos.  I don't get this.  You're an actor.  You're on The Sopranos.  That's a big hit.  It's a misconception that if you're on TV, you're making a lot of money and enough to survive.  Yeah, but at least.  But you're on The Sopranos.  And the guy, what, kicked open a door and stole something like $2,500 worth of stuff?  That's it.  Yeah.  Got arrested for that.  That's in the paper today.  And then Artie, what?  I like his comment, too.  He goes, I'm innocent.  I'm always innocent.  Always innocent is not something to say. 
[00:39:30]  Makes people think you do this a lot.  And it looks like he knows some people.  Yeah.  And then what happened with Artie?  He's drunk driving.  Well, that's at least what they're saying in the paper.  Yeah, drunk driving.  And a bag of Coke residue in the pocket or whatever.  Those lights are off on his car.  He said he was trying to park his car.  And he couldn't get in the spot, so he drove around the block, but he has lights off.  Yeah.  Oops.  Brooklyn is just a bitch to park in.  You know, you get home from a bar or something, and they got that alternate side parking. 
[00:40:00]  So one side is completely taken up.  And I swear, sometimes you got to park four blocks away.  You got to circle the block.  They wear you down, and you park in front of a hydrant, and you get a $300 ticket the next day.  It's just a pain in the ass.  So he probably was doing that.  But, you know, it's risky if you've been drinking.  So he got a Dewey, and then they found some Coke.  And this guy's as big a screw-up as he is on the show.  I'm waiting for him to get killed on the show.  A couple of seasons back, it looked like they were going to kill him.  That should have happened a few years ago. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  But see, David Chase just knows how to pick him for this series, obviously.  He's getting real bad guys.  That's why they're all getting arrested.  Screw-ups.  Meanwhile, Gandolfini is spotted in a library.  He's the only one who, like, leads, like, a completely nice life.  Yeah.  The rest of them are all problems.  Got his nice family.  Yeah, here in New York, the paparazzi gets pictures of him, like, you know, I don't know,  with his little kid on a tricycle.  Yeah.  And the rest of the guys, yeah, you're right.  In a park holding, you know, an ice cream. 
[00:41:00]  A mochaccino.  Nice daddy moment.  All right.  Anyway, the guy, he hung up.  He couldn't wait.  The New Hampshire guy.  Aw.  I guess because we were calling his state a gay state.  Mm-hmm.  He said he knows how David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear.  Yeah, how do they do that?  You don't know that one?  When they make those giant, huge things disappear.  That's really obvious.  Are you on, like, a rotary thing?  The stage rotates.  Yeah, but what about the surroundings?  It rotates so slight and slow, and they're framing off the Statue of Liberty on a stage. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And you never get to see that the Statue of Liberty is now to your left.  So you can't see anything else?  Not really.  No reference points?  Not really.  Just enough.  And then they, while he, you know, puts the curtain down or whatever, he slowly, slowly,  slowly, slowly, you know, rotates the stage, opens up the curtain, and there's no Statue of  Liberty.  Well, that's just stupid.  No, no.  See, I think...  That's the way you do it, or he actually makes it disappear.  No.  Oh.  It's neither.  It's a trick, but you're getting it wrong what they do, and I talked to a guy. 
[00:42:00]  What's up is there's a big chain attached to the top of it, and, like, when the curtain  goes up, they pull it down on the ground, they tip it over, and they open the curtain,  it's gone, and they put it...  Ta-da.  Yeah.  My friend was on that.  Bro.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  All right, let's go to Danny in New Jersey, see what Danny's up to.  Danny, what's up?  Yo, Owen, hey, what's shaking?  Mr. Norton, good morning.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, for some of the new people that are just catching you guys on K-Rock, are you  guys going to bring in Stalker Patty?  Yeah, I don't know why Stalker Patty hasn't come by yet. 
[00:42:30]  Usually, she's good for a few gifts.  Yeah, it's kind of odd.  Usually, she brings you your little picture frames that end up miraculously blown apart.  After her last appearance, I don't think she wants to come back.  Oh, we did that on the XM show.  Yeah.  Do you want to explain that really fast?  Yeah, she had a fun time.  Well, whose birthday was it?  Yours.  Oh, Frank.  It was your birthday.  Yeah, memorable that was.  I was sick.  And a couple of people brought in a cake, and Patty was there, and, well, we wanted to 
[00:43:00]  shove her face in the cake, and that didn't happen because somebody tipped her off.  Dopes in our studio.  It's No Filter Paul.  Yeah.  And I don't think it was good enough that we were stapling signs to No Filter Paul's chest.  No, he should pay more dearly.  Yeah, he should pay on this show as well because we did it only for the XM audience.  All right.  So No Filter Paul, come on in, and we're going to just staple signs to your body.  Good.  Tomorrow, by the way.  So take off from work.  Good for him.  Anyway, go ahead. 
[00:43:30]  And then at some point, E-Rock decided it was time to pick the cake up and throw it at Patty,  and she had to go to work.  A huge sheet cake.  She started crying.  It was real sad.  It's just pathetic.  She was weeping with cake on her, and I don't think she'll be back.  Well, that's because O pretended to break her glasses, so she had...  That was the other part, right.  Cake on her.  Well, yeah.  No, my glasses.  I took her glasses, and she really thought I smashed them.  I have to go to work. 
[00:44:00]  And what did she have to do to get her glasses back?  She had to hold your mule.  Yeah.  For 30 seconds.  Wearing a surgical glove.  Because even she, as a virgin, was petrified.  Yeah, we'll have her on the show in the very near future.  Speaking of things we want to do on the show, what's going on with the mousetraps and the  tool tickets and the money?  I believe we were...  Do we have an update from Ben?  Yes.  All right.  Ben?  Ben very happy because his Sox beat the Yankees last night at Fenway.  7-3. 
[00:44:30]  7-3.  The return of Johnny Damon.  And I love Boston because they just booed him.  No, no, no.  It was a mixed batch.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  See, some of the signs, they were brutal.  Get the signs on the paper.  First of all, it wasn't a mixed batch.  I'll tell you what happened.  Yes, it was.  No.  Most of Fenway started booing Johnny Damon, and then Johnny Damon tipped his cap, and then  some of these people turned and said, all right, we'll cheer for you.  But at first, they were booing like crazy.  It wasn't mixed.  What a bunch of dopes they are.  He helped them win a World Series. 
[00:45:00]  What's the matter with that?  They don't care.  I think he should have got applause.  Enough with the Yankee obsession.  We get it.  Shut your faces.  They start that Yankee stuff, can't.  I'm right already.  Everywhere.  David Ortiz, I hope he gets shin cancer.  He does nothing but hurt the Yankees.  He is the Yankee killer.  You got to love him.  I like him a lot better than that dope they got from the A's.  That stupid Giambi.  He stinks.  I don't want him.  Enough with the sluggers, stupid. 
[00:45:30]  How about some pitching and a bullpen?  Randy Johnson is 58.  I don't think he's quite that old.  That's what he does.  He gets guys that were great, that he loved for a long time.  He's like me with celebrity photos.  He just wants to say he got them.  Right.  He doesn't care about the quality of the team.  Get a young pitcher with no name.  Yeah, that is true about celebrity photos.  We always get our pictures taken with these guys when they're just about dead.  Yeah.  I'll never forget my Rodney Dangerfield photo.  Yeah.  There were a lot of parts on his body that were dead when we got that picture taken. 
[00:46:00]  But anyway, what's up with the tool tickets, the mousetraps, the cold hard cash?  Looks good.  We just got to get the nudity.  The release forums just have to get done.  So the XM release forums are going to the CBS release forum, people, and they'll figure  it out.  Well, you know how quickly they were able to do paperwork between the two companies?  That ought to take months.  Yeah.  We got to get into that someday.  We got two girlfriends is what it is.  We got, we're working for two companies and, and it's funny, uh, you know, we started trying 
[00:46:30]  to put this deal together in 1994, right?  I think it was each company doesn't want to hear about the other company.  I'm noticing now because I'll give reports to Eric Logan and I'll also give reports to  Tom Chiasano and they don't want to hear about the other side.  No, they, you know, Eric Logan wants to hear XM, XM, XM, XM, right.  And Tom wants to hear about, uh, you know, 92, three free FM set and all the other, uh,  commercial stations were being broadcast on.  You know how chicks are.  So, so what day are we doing the tool tickets?  I was thinking Friday.  Yeah, let's do it Friday. 
[00:47:00]  We're going to have big A and Twitch.  Let's do the news on Friday as well, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Also speaking of birthdays, uh, our professional killers are celebrating a birthday today.  That's so weird.  They both have the same birthday.  The double mint twins.  Isn't that creepy?  Uh, we got club soda, Kenny.  Good morning.  And master Poe.  Good morning, gentlemen.  These guys kill people for a living and they're both celebrating birth, uh, birthdays today.  So our security team, are you guys bonding today?  It's an honor to share this day with my compatriot. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  I think we have a lot more in common now.  Oh, not a brain cell between them, man.  Let's be honest.  What do you guys want for your birthday?  Besides not a book.  Not a means no book, right?  Not a.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  No, not a Spanish.  See, I was like a play on words.  I saw that.  Oh.  That was good.  Very good, Kenny.  Very good.  Happy birthday to me.  You know what we could do? 
[00:48:00]  We got that, uh, the immigration test.  Do we still have that printed out from yesterday?  We should have these guys try to answer some of those questions.  Dude, I couldn't answer those questions.  They were easy.  And I'm smart.  Yeah, most people can't answer.  I'm a genius.  All right.  Well, happy birthday to Master Poe and Club Soda Kenny.  It's very unfortunate.  You gotta, you gotta, you know, share a birthday.  But there you go.  Any plans, uh, for the birthday?  What are you doing there, Kenny?  I couldn't share this day with a nicer man.  Hey, here's the deal.  You know, after we're done here, we gotta take the walk over to XM. 
[00:48:30]  You know, maybe, this is last minute.  I understand that.  But maybe there's a pest out there somewhere, an ONA pest, that could quickly get a birthday cake.  And we'll, we'll sing happy birthday all the way to the other studio.  Oh, that'll be nice.  For the guys.  Yeah.  I don't know if any pest are in the area that could really help us out.  Um, but that would be very nice if we show up.  We'll be outside the, this studio, what, around 850, 855, somewhere around there.  Okay.  You know, I, I appreciate the sentiment, sentiments. 
[00:49:00]  I thought you were going to say, I appreciate the sentiment.  I appreciate the sentiment.  Let's not forget a very special person's birthday is this month also.  So, um, who's that, Kenny?  No, it's like a little teaser.  You're doing a radio tease?  You are savvy.  How about you go tease over there?  That would be wonderful.  All right.  Keep up the good work and thanks.  All right.  Happy birthday.  Thank you guys.  All right.  You want to do an ONA party rock? 
[00:49:30]  Do it because it's very echoey.  So right there.  Poe's known for his ONA party rocks.  Not near the mic.  Not too close to the mic.  Because we're in a studio that's not done yet.  So the echo would be great.  Master Poe, when we do our live road shows, he's known for just getting on stage and doing  his catchphrase.  Yes.  The last time he did it, his mic wasn't on and it, and it, it was a, it was funny for  everybody.  But go ahead, Master Poe.  All right.  I may cry because I'm a little sick, but here we go.  You're sick too?  Yeah.  He's got the AIDS. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  All right.  We don't want the ONA party rock.  I'm sorry.  No, we want it.  We want it when you're a hundred percent.  I can do it.  He can do it.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  Here we go.  ONA party rock!  All right.  That was so awkward.  Thank you.  Thank you, birthday boy.  No filter, Paul.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  We're going to be stapling signs to your chest tomorrow. 
[00:50:30]  No problem at all.  I'll be there.  All right.  That's all I want.  Bye.  That's fine.  See you later.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low.  Don't you think, Ramone?  Ramone, call 9-1-1. 
[00:51:00]  Opie and Anthony, weekday mornings.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Steve on Long Island has a quick question.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right, we're getting more comfortable every day here in our new surroundings.  Congratulations.  I got a quick question.  Who the hell is cackling in the background? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, that's our own Ben.  Gee, is that how he laughs?  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He should die of throat cancer.  He cackles at everything.  You know, the people that haven't heard us in four years have no idea.  I mean, the Ben laughing.  Oh, my goodness.  I'll car crash you for that.  For asking for the car crash.  I just got a car.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Oh, that's why.  He wanted to do his Ben impression.  He wanted to do his Ben impression.  Yeah, we do enjoy the Ben impression if you want to give us a call. 
[00:52:00]  But, Ben, I love that he's back in the studio with us because at XM, he's in his office all day just staring at a screen.  We don't know what he does.  Nothing.  Yes, we do.  Yeah, exactly.  But at least over here, it looks like he's working on the show, he's in this huge studio that still needs walls and a ceiling, and he just laughs uncontrollably, and sometimes we don't even know why he's laughing.  He finds the oddest things funny.  Ben wants every day to be like Christmas morning when he was a little boy.  Yeah.  All you gotta do is mention Boston, like, ah, that sucks. 
[00:52:30]  Boston, ah, that sucks.  What?  What was funny about that?  Nothing.  He doesn't do the clap anymore, though.  Remember when he was like, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, I'm Randy Johnson.  Stupid.  What?  And he's herky and jerky.  Yeah, these are the conversations we have, Ben.  Nothing gets done.  It really does.  It's like one word things, the association, everybody.  Hey, hey, hey, Jim, thank you.  Ah, that was meaningful. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Moving on.  The other thing, a lot of people are asking about the Pal Talk cameras.  Yeah, well, we're waiting, I think.  On the computers.  Yeah, this is a show in progress.  I hope you guys understand that, because we were set up really nice at XM.  We got our own studio, and we're used to everything.  It's set perfectly for us.  Lack of supervision.  Lack of supervision, which is key to doing a radio show.  Yep.  And over here, the studio's not even built, but they insisted that we come over here immediately  and start broadcasting. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Because of the whole, you know, working for two companies.  Yeah, they wanted us here.  Well, they both want to show their manhood.  Yeah.  Mine is bigger than yours, if you know what I'm saying.  And they want to keep an eye on us.  You think?  Yeah, because they're really paranoid now that we're back on regular radio, that I don't  know, that we're actually going to...  Do something stupid?  Yeah.  I guess they have reason to.  Yeah, I was going to say, where do they get that?  Like we haven't in the past.  Where do they get that from?  We're wiser.  All right, speaking of blowing up our careers, believe it or not, you know, there's a lot 
[00:54:00]  of people, once again, listening to us for the first time in four years.  We've been back doing radio for 18 plus months on satellite, XM, and this past Christmas,  we almost got fired.  Yeah.  We almost got fired.  It came close, a little scary.  Didn't want to be out of a job again.  And once again, it was because we kind of relinquished our show to the listeners.  To the O&A pest. 
[00:54:30]  That's when we get in trouble.  And the reason we're bringing this up today is because we're being mentioned in a pretty  big article in the New York Daily News.  The headline, watch out, guys.  This is a terrific headline.  Oh, hold on.  No buts about it.  Live TV brings exposure to risk.  Buts as in behinds.  That's right.  I get it.  There was a full moon on Channel 5 Sunday night and not the kind they talk about during  the weather report. 
[00:55:00]  They don't talk about full moons during the weather.  Very rarely.  Never.  No, it was the human kind.  It occurred during a live report from correspondent Lisa Cabrera.  Was she marching yesterday?  From Union Square on the pending immigrant boycott scheduled for Monday afternoon.  Unbeknownst to Cabrera, while she did a live stand-up report during the station's 10 p.m.  newscast, a man walked behind her dropping his jeans.  Nice. 
[00:55:30]  For a few seconds while Cabrera closed out a report, the guy strolled on camera revealing  his bare bottom.  His bare bottom.  So now are they going to get like a big FCC fine the same way a radio show would be if  a caller blurts out something nasty?  Probably not.  Of course not.  No.  No, because, well, that's what we're going to get into in a minute or two here.  We've got lots of cursing on the air in recent months and almost got fired for it.  Then he walked back while pulling his pants up.  No one on the Karen Hepp and Dick Brennan-anchored newscast mentioned the incident. 
[00:56:00]  Of course not.  Why would they be honest?  Why wouldn't you mention that if that happened?  And do a little improv.  Ha, ha, ha.  That guy made an ass of himself.  Ha, ha.  Get it?  Ass?  Well, huh.  Too busy putting on their stupid news voices.  Oh, yeah.  Back to you.  Well, no.  It wasn't, you know, they couldn't read it.  If they can't read it, that's not on the teleprompter.  They're done.  It's not happening.  We did not receive any complaints regarding this incident.  A spokeswoman for the station said, calls or not to the station, the slow-moving moon 
[00:56:30]  again showed the perils of broadcasting live anywhere.  The perils.  Perils.  Viewers are already well aware of people standing, jumping, talking against a cell phone,  smiling, and waving into the camera over the shoulders of an unsuspecting correspondent.  So much so, people in TV refer to cameras as $50,000 idiot magnets.  And here we go.  Likewise, for a while, the Opie and Anthony radio show, now heard mornings on 92.3 FM in 
[00:57:00]  New York City and on XM Satellite Radio, has encouraged fans to disrupt live TV shots.  Arthur Chien was fired from CBS Channel 2 after using an expletive on live TV after one  listener stood behind him holding a sign.  Yeah.  Yes, we have that actual clip here.  A couple of other correspondents here and in cities around the country also had live  shots disrupted by the campaign.  The hosts, Greg Opie Hughes and Anthony Cumia, scrapped the campaign in December after a listener 
[00:57:30]  fired an air horn close to the ear of WABC Channel 7 correspondent, Anthony Johnson.  See, it always goes too far, people.  Yeah, well...  They don't know how to keep it in check.  We had a great thing going, I'm not going to lie to you.  Great run.  It was a great thing going, and then the ONA pest got very, very, very aggressive.  A little overzealous.  And they blew an air horn in the guy's ear live on TV.  Yeah.  He threatened all sorts of stuff.  Nah.  And then there was the weather guy from Fox. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  That said he was scared for his life because one of our guys kind of ran at him as he was  on TV.  What a girl.  Really?  There's also the risk of something bad happening to a correspondent while broadcasting live.  Earlier this year, Channel 7's Ken Rosato and his camera person, Barbara McCallick, were  nearly run over by a tractor trailer while broadcasting live in the dark in Jersey City.  That was their own stupidity.  Get out of the road.  So, this is the incident that, uh, this one didn't, this one didn't get us fired, right? 
[00:58:30]  Almost get us fired?  No, we were a little nervous at first, but, uh, got him fired.  Yeah, this is, uh, Arthur Cheehan.  He just lost it on live TV.  Yeah.  Showing he wasn't too professional about what was going on.  Yeah, he was a little angry.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy a couple of, buy multiple Metro cards, stand at the turnstile,  and just continuously swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit, 
[00:59:00]  but it's costing the TA a great deal, about 16 million dollars a year, and they're trying  to put a stop to it.  What the f*** is your problem, man?  Oops.  Oops, you were still on.  It was our own Nathaniel.  He had a huge Opie and Anthony, uh, sign behind Arthur Cheehan, and, uh, he was just,  he was very, very subtle.  Yeah, very subdued.  This was the beginning of the campaign when, uh, when it was very, it was, it, it, this  is the way it should have ran, basically. 
[00:59:30]  It was very subtle, but we were getting our message across to, to everyone out there,  and Nathaniel was just kind of going, Opie and Anthony on X-Men's LA Radio, and the guy  was going to a tape piece, and then turned around, because he just couldn't  take it anymore, and, and said, what the f*** is your problem, man?  He didn't even wait for the tape piece to start.  No.  Like, you'd think you would wait a couple of seconds to make sure you're clear, but he  just turned right around and blurted out the f-bomb, and that was it.  Bye-bye.  So we got, uh, some huge exposure on that.  Huge exposure.  And that just made the campaign, uh, take off, by the way. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Then everybody wanted to get involved with the assault on the media campaign that we did.  It was a great way to show everyone that we were back doing radio, by the way.  And, uh, you know, looking at a lot of these phone calls, uh, where they, they're, they're  saying they haven't heard us in four years.  It, it was a great campaign.  It really helped us out.  Yeah.  Really did a lot of good.  Here's, uh, the biggest pass.  One of the biggest ONA pass.  No filter, Paul.  He got involved in the assault on the media.  Obnoxious campaign. 
[01:00:30]  We're going to introduce this, uh, this audience to no filter, Paul tomorrow, and you will get  to hate them just like everybody else.  Does it hurt you to know that it's recorded music and that people were coming out today  saying, oh, great show.  That, that kills us.  Yes.  That really kills us.  Now, once again, the musicians make it.  Oh, my God.  The XMCA radio.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We had a problem there and, uh, Stacy got out of the way.  So, uh, that was Stacy Sager reporting live, uh, from, uh, Midtown.  We turn now to other news. 
[01:01:00]  That was the girl that just walked off the, the set.  Well, that's right.  Yeah, the videos are, are really, really good.  Unfortunately, we can't promote any websites yet because I don't know.  They got some weird rule over here about, uh, websites and porno.  Why don't they stop?  So I, I guess what we're doing is encouraging everyone to join our, my space and then, uh,  all the links will be up there.  Yeah.  That might be a way around it.  We don't even know.  I bet you that's not even going to be good enough.  No.  Just, you see the name of the show.  That's our, my space. 
[01:01:30]  How's that?  So join my space.  And then, uh, all the links that you're going to want to go to or should be on there.  Okay.  Well, I'm plugging my site.  Eatabullet.com.  There's no porn there.  It's just my stupid celebrity pictures.  No.  Nice.  All right.  And, uh, cause the videos are much better than the actual audio.  You just Google our names.  Yeah.  Google the names and you'll get to some of the fine websites.  Yeah.  A lot of them haven't changed for this, for some of the old time listeners that haven't  heard us in a while.  All right.  Here's another example of the, uh, the assault on the media campaign.  Mother nature's trifecta of high tide, steady winds, blowing rains, et cetera, forced this, 
[01:02:00]  the lake to spill over on both sides.  And the result was evacuating a lake from Holmes and also a nearby camera.  Yeah.  The news guys get so pissed.  Oh, they get pissed.  Yeah.  Backing up to the no filter Paul one, by the way, there was a guy with a, what was it?  A trumpet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A guy playing a trumpet.  They're jumping up and down with their arms in the air. 
[01:02:30]  And cause you did mention this.  I forgot.  We went off on a tangent.  The reporter actually just walked off the set.  She couldn't handle it anymore.  She walked out of the shot.  She was shocked.  And then other guys dressed in costume.  We had people in bear suits and various costumes.  Like a lion in Alabama.  Yeah.  Just like a lion.  Cause they're all just asses.  The media, they're so self-important.  It's just great to see their little moments in the sun ruined.  Yeah.  They have no, they can do whatever they want.  They have different rules than we do trying to be funny and they're built on the same 
[01:03:00]  thing, which is generating ratings.  It's sickening.  Yeah.  They try to come off like they're there to inform the public about things when the truth  of the matter is it's another entertainment show.  Of course it is.  You know, maybe at some point in history, the news was to inform people, but it's turned  into another show.  When Cronkite took his glasses off after JFK's assassination, that was what the media  was supposed to be.  That was when they were still, you know.  Yeah.  Credible.  Yeah.  But now they're just, it's all just a bunch of tabloid douches.  They deserve what they get.  They tease every two seconds during the show. 
[01:03:30]  They do their news teases, which are just made to scare you, to petrify the viewer into  watching their news because you're in danger.  Your kid's in danger.  Everything you use is dangerous.  So it's a, and that's just teases to get you to watch.  So they get ratings so they can generate revenue.  The news isn't a public service.  It's not there as a public service.  It's a business and it's more a business than it is giving you information.  That's what we deal with. 
[01:04:00]  So we figured we'd turn around and stick it to them a little bit.  Yeah.  We had a lot of fun.  Got carried away.  We really had a lot of fun with this.  Oh, yeah.  It was a very sad day when we had to stop the whole thing.  Yeah.  And we had no choice.  It was either continue doing it and not do radio.  Yeah.  You know, some people said we pussied out.  But the matter is, you know, we'd like to hold on to a job for a little while.  You know, it's easy to get fired.  Believe us.  All right.  Here's another example. 
[01:04:30]  The search dogs actually missed the 10-year-old boy the first time they went by that house.  Don't know if that matters now.  He's a little dehydrated with a few cuts and bruises, but he'll be okay.  We're live in Perth Amboy tonight with some company.  Jeff Begay's Channel 7 Eyewitness News.  Everybody celebrating out there.  Jeffrey, thank you.  Everybody celebrating.  Everybody celebrating out there.  Some of them pros, man.  They piled right through.  I remember that video, by the way.  The guy's doing his report.  And the O&A pass just slowly made himself known. 
[01:05:00]  Just his head appeared in the shot.  And then he pretty much started, like, tapping on the guy.  I don't think he actually tapped on the guy, but he was like, excuse me.  Excuse me.  You ever hear of Opie and Anthony?  Excuse me.  You ever hear of Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, the guy's in the middle of his shot, his live shot, and he'd start a conversation with the news guy.  Hey, what's up?  How are you doing?  You ever hear of Opie and Anthony?  Excuse me, sir.  And one more example here before we move on to some other things.  Todd Connor joins us live from New York Times Square.  Todd?  Hey there, Greta. 
[01:05:30]  Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending his day defending his actions to make the threat public and also to flood the city's subways with thousands of police officers and extra security saying he would rather err on the side of caution.  Of course, May's subways also being rather cautious today.  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items.  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown.  Police closing.  That one was no Phil to Paul again. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  He'll be in studio tomorrow.  And, yeah, there was a whole scuffle that was going on after that.  You could hear the arguing in the background.  Yeah, you could kind of hear when he got taken out.  All right.  You know, speaking of a fishbowl, it was Greta Van Susteren.  How perfect would it be to see her swimming around on that stupid bass face of hers?  Shouldn't you have a certain look to be on television?  Anyone over there kind of mediocre with a stroke face?  We'd like you to apply.  You should have to blink if you're going to be on TV.  That should be one of the rules. 
[01:06:30]  You've got to be able to blink.  She's a cadaver.  She died of a stroke in 1988, and they propped her up, and they just move her mouth with a stick.  She's had some plastic surgery over the years.  You see what she looked like before?  Oh, isn't she that lady in France that had a new face put on?  That lady has more natural face movements.  Enough with Greta.  Stupid Nazi name.  Greta Van Susteren.  I was only following orders.  Zagman. 
[01:07:00]  Stupid Dr. Mengele's secretary.  That's who she is.  Zagman from our fine message board.  Whackbag.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, Zagman?  What's happening?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I was just thinking about something you were saying before, how, you know, you say you  treat your two new companies like two girlfriends or two wives.  Yeah.  Well, you should be totally taking advantage of that and treating it like two divorcee parents.  Say, well, this guy, my mom says that she'll get me this, and then run over to the other 
[01:07:30]  companies.  Ooh, play them against each other for better presence.  You know, that's a much better way to look at this.  Yep.  A much better way.  Yeah, because it's like we have two homes.  Yeah.  You know, I mean.  We spend, you know.  We all had friends, or you might be one of these people that had divorced parents, and  they.  Oh, I was.  Did they set up two separate homes for you where you had two bedrooms and all that crap?  It was kind of like I lived with, you know, me, my brother, and sister lived with my mom.  And then on the weekends, dad would come and pick us up and, you know, take us to his 
[01:08:00]  apartment with his chippy of the week, you know, who would be there and tell us what great  kids we were trying to, like, bond.  And we're just looking like, shut up, dad's whore.  Could dad's whore not talk to me like you're my mom?  Shut up.  I don't want to hear from you.  Believe me, my dad doesn't want to hear a word out of you.  He's got you here for one reason. 
[01:08:30]  And it isn't to bond with his children.  But, yeah, it was, like, two different places, and we'd stay for the weekend.  Most of the time was spent, you know, in various bars in Mineola.  But that was, like, dad's weekend out.  Hey, where do you want to go?  You know, Adventureland?  I was like, okay, let's go to Adventureland, a little amusement park out on Long Island.  And we'd go there and have a little fun for a few minutes, and then he'd be like, oh,  I got to meet somebody.  And we'd wind up in some bar in Mineola.  Just, you know, have another soda, have another soda. 
[01:09:00]  And then, you know, he'd get hammered.  And drive us around.  And what would he do?  Just give you a handful of quarters to play the video games or something?  Video games?  Dude.  What?  I think I was, like, pinball machines?  I think I was, like, nine years old.  I don't think we had much video games.  Yeah, we had the pinball machines.  Yeah, pinball machines, things like that.  Squeeze the handle and see how strong you are.  Game, maybe?  I don't know.  The Nickelodeon?  I'd watch old films by cranking the handle. 
[01:09:30]  No, it was, yeah, he would just kind of hang.  It wasn't even that.  It would just give me, you know, I'd give him a Shirley Temple, you know, and I'd sit  there acting like I was having a drink and, you know, some peanuts.  And he would sit and talk, you know, whatever business he was doing at the time, whatever  he was running at the time.  Drugs.  Nah, never drugs.  It was always some, like, I remember my father worked for some vending machine company for  a while.  And his job was to fix them and to collect the quarters and bring them back. 
[01:10:00]  And I just remember for a couple of weeks, we bought everything with quarters.  We just was taking quarters.  I mean, my mother would go shopping and rolls of quarters would come out.  And then that job disappeared.  It was kind of like two camps, though.  And then back to mom's where, you know, she'd be kind of as responsible as she could be.  So is this kind of reminding you of the old days?  Oh, yeah.  Back and forth.  Two parents.  The whole thing.  We got, like, two bedrooms, you know. 
[01:10:30]  Sleep here.  I got to be honest.  We still like mommy's bedroom.  Yeah.  We like mommy's bedroom a little better.  A little better.  So far.  I mean, this bedroom doesn't even have walls or a ceiling yet.  We're not used to it.  No.  You know, this bedroom's sort of like sleeping in the bedroom you know grandma died in or  something.  Still a little uncomfortable.  Still a little eerie.  Feeling a little queasy about it.  And yet there's something hilarious about it.  Exactly.  Because, you know, as you're trying to, you know, you're trying to bang a girl.  You just know that she grabbed her chest and her stupid wig fell off the bed. 
[01:11:00]  Notice what this is like, too.  Mommy got all the money in the settlement.  Because there's nothing on the walls here.  It's like, you know, dad took what he could from the divorce.  Dad's got to get back on his feet.  He's got an apartment, but he can't really afford a really nice apartment because mommy's got  all the money, mommy's got the house that daddy paid for.  Yep.  That's what we feel like right now.  We're waiting for some money to come in over here.  Dad's just got to get back on his feet. 
[01:11:30]  He's a little broke in the divorce and, you know, so we got to deal with it.  Yeah.  Well, daddy's out there selling.  Well, I think recently for a few months, daddy dated an older woman who took a lot of his money.  Took a lot out of him, too.  And didn't do much.  Didn't put out much.  Nope.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, sure.  Chris on Long Island, what's up?  Not much, guys.  You guys should seriously take advantage of that situation.  That guy is right.  My parents divorced when I was little.  I had two Christmases, two Easter's, two of every holiday, two birthdays. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Two houses.  Well, it's great because, you know, we're on the CBS radio stations and they're planning a big ad campaign.  I guess we're going to be on buses and billboards and stuff.  So I was bragging about that the other day to the XM brass.  Guess what?  What?  They're going to be.  Are they stepping up?  Yeah, they're going to be stepping up.  And next thing you know, you know, we've been begging and screaming for marketing for a long time in our careers.  There's going to be too much now.  Nice. 
[01:12:30]  Overexposed.  We're going to be overexposed because, you know, CBS is going to have this huge gaudy billboard somewhere.  And XM's like, oh, yeah, right across the street.  Well, don't forget, they're also hurt over here.  Good.  Play them against each other.  That's right.  Let's go to Ed in Connecticut.  Ed, how great is that going to be, just seeing our faces on something?  Anthony, you're giving me flashbacks.  I remember as a little kid going down, you know, my parents would say, hey, kids, we're going to go see Grandma and Grandpa.  We'd go down and see Grandma and Grandpa.  Grandpa would say, I'm taking the boy for a walk. 
[01:13:00]  Go down to the bar, belly up.  I'm like, eight?  Give the kid a Coke with 15 cherries in it, you know?  Yeah, a bunch of maraschino cherries just happen to make kids happy.  Yeah, exactly.  That's all you need.  Something with maraschino cherries in it, and the kid will sit in a bar all day.  That's right.  That's right.  But you're giving me flashbacks.  Yeah, my grandfather would take us to Belmont when we're kids.  What else was he going to do?  Come on to Belmont.  But that's all he knows.  What else is he going to do?  Son of a bitch smacking the program on his hand.  Son of a bitch.  And we'd sit there as kids, like, she's betting on the horses. 
[01:13:30]  The track ain't fun for a kid.  Not fun.  My grandfathers, I'd love to tell you what they did, but they were both in boxes before  I was born.  Aw.  Never met them.  That's sad.  Yeah, I don't remember my grandfathers either.  You just keep sharing memories.  Yeah.  I remember one of my grandfathers and two of my grandmothers.  I said, one is still alive.  One grandmother is still alive.  Five shots and see she's still alive. 
[01:14:00]  All right, why don't we step aside for a little bit?  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  If you want to get a hold of us, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What happened to the potatoes?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From O&A Pictures.  You always liked potatoes.  That's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  It won't happen again.  I can promise you it.  How far will one man go? 
[01:14:30]  Well, I'm going to have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The Potato Diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing of potatoes, Danny.  Everything is delicious.  The Potato Diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  Coming soon.  I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.  God, you've gotten fat. 
[01:15:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  E-Rock.  Why is your finger up in the air?  Now he's trying to put headphones on over his headphones.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program, the ONA virus spreading across America.  He looks so troubled.  What's the matter, Eric?  What's going on over there?  You had your finger up in the air like you were going to cue me.  You having a flashback to that time your uncle snuck in, and you realized you really 
[01:15:30]  weren't eating cotton candy?  You're on.  What's up?  Nothing.  I was just getting the cues from the other studio.  Oh.  Because your hand was on the point.  Well, there was going to be dead air, so I started the music on my own.  We're still trying to figure out the system here.  Let's say hi to Sonny Ferrelli from Boston, listening to us on WBCN, and I'm sure he's  also listening on XM Satellite Radio.  Sonny, what's up, buddy?  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to do the torture in Nepal tomorrow. 
[01:16:00]  You want to come down and torture Paul?  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  I mean, I know you guys are biased and from the New York area, but really, I was better  at the Assault on the Media Contest than he was.  I won it two times in a row.  Yeah, these guys have an ongoing battle.  Very competitive.  Sonny, if you want to come on down and check out the show, by all means.  And don't forget, you know, it was him.  He called the studio, the TV studio, the last one I was trying to attempt, for the last  month that he won on.  Yeah, there's all sorts of controversy.  We could get into it tomorrow if you come on down here, all right? 
[01:16:30]  Cool.  All right.  Yeah, basically, he's convinced that No Filter Paul ratted him out.  Yep.  As he was going for the title, we forgot to tell everyone that the Assault on the Media  Contest, you know, there was bragging rights.  Every month, we had a winner who had the best Assault on the Media.  And pretty much...  Prices were given out.  Yeah, pretty much Sonny Forelli and No Filter Paul were going at it the most.  And Sonny Forelli, to this day, is convinced that No Filter Paul turned into a rat and called  a TV station up there in Boston to prevent Sonny Forelli from taking the title. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Tomorrow on the show, also, we're going to have No Filter Paul try to hold his breath  like David Blaine.  David Blaine's going for nine minutes.  And No Filter Paul, I think, will go for about nine seconds.  I give him...  Yeah, I was just going to say, I give him about 10 seconds.  If we hold his head under the water, maybe 15.  Right.  Sonny, we'll see you tomorrow.  All right.  Let's go to...  Speaking of Boston, by the way, do we thank BCN for the box they sent us?  Yeah.  WBCN sent their gifts.  And they're terrific.  What's wrong?  They're amazing. 
[01:17:30]  The box of gifts they sent us, it was a couple of sweatshirts and some...  Dude, I was overwhelmed.  Well, there's some wrestling stuff in there and some DVDs and really awful white t-shirts.  No one wears white t-shirts with logos on them anymore.  What is this wrestling stuff?  BCN Pat's hat?  A lot of WWE.  Why are they saying this wrestling stuff?  How old are they, nine?  Because Eric probably asked for it.  Eric took all the wrestling stuff.  Give me all your wrestling stuff.  Did you take all the wrestling stuff? 
[01:18:00]  Because you can have it.  Wrestling stinks.  A wrestling book?  Divas Uncovered?  What is that?  An action figure of who?  Pedro.  Napoleon Dynamite?  Yeah.  A Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite action figure.  Somebody cleaned out their closet at home and sent this dreck.  Here's your welcome back gifts.  UFC.  That's pretty cool.  Ultimate submissions.  I'll take that one.  Yeah.  Let me see that one.  That's pretty good.  This is the worst box you've ever seen in your life.  Well, it's from their prize closet and yeah, it's pretty obvious it's the stuff they weren't 
[01:18:30]  able to give away.  A Don Cheney doll?  Is this guy a hockey player in a suit?  There's this guy with a suit.  Thumbs up.  It's Don Cherry.  Oh.  That makes it better.  Who is he?  I don't know, but he spiked onto the floor.  He's a legendary hockey guy.  Oh, cool.  We're being heard on XM Canada.  They know.  Here's the card.  Opie and Anthony, welcome back to Boston from, well, I can't quite read who the card  is from. 
[01:19:00]  How about buying a card instead of that cheap crowd?  Oh, those are cool.  Some BCN 104.1 The Rock of Boston stickers that don't even say Opie and Anthony on them.  So I guess-  Well, a little short notice.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying they should be ready, but why would you send these?  What are we going to do with them?  Uh, put them on your new caddy.  Yeah.  Maybe on the windshield so everyone can see where I'm on in Boston.  Put it on the paint.  So when you take it off, it could peel the paint off.  All right.  Well, they were thinking about us.  They were?  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Kevin Spacey opened a better box at the end of that stupid movie than we just got.  What's in the box?  Uh, Dan in New York, what's going on?  I think you broke, uh, Mr. Cherry.  Hey, Dan.  Uh, just to say a thing about the old days.  When I was a kid, I guess around seven, eight years old, my, uh, father would go to the racetrack  with his, uh, brothers, uh, Roosevelt and the Yonkers Raceway, and they'd leave me in  the car all night.  Oh, tell my mother, oh, we went bowling, uh, he fell asleep. 
[01:20:00]  Leave you in the car?  11, 12, yeah, until I was like 11, 12, I couldn't get in the racetrack.  I thought they'd keep me in the car all night.  That was something that used to happen that just doesn't or shouldn't happen anymore.  Uh, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn.  I remember being left in the car.  All right, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.  Roll the window down a little bit.  The doors weren't locked, and you're just sitting there on the side of the road in a car.  And nowadays, they'd lock them up. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, because you could be snatched up, you know.  Be killed in there?  Overheat?  I don't know.  All right, Dan, thank you.  All right, take it easy, boys.  All right.  Uh, well, we got news teases.  We got Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco going at it last night on Entertainment Tonight.  We have the sex offenders story on Fox 5 News.  Fox 5.  I want to see how Fox handled it.  Do you really?  All right.  Well, yeah, let's see how they handled it, because Dateline did a great job.  Dateline started the trend, and now it's all about the pedophiles and trying to catch them. 
[01:21:00]  They rent out a house, or they have a house.  They use somebody's house.  They have a girl that looks like a young girl, or she can sound like a young boy also.  She sounds like Buffalo Bill when she tries to be a young boy.  Pump your nose.  Be right out.  Would you?  Thank you.  Would you?  You look a little handicapped there.  You need some help?  Would you?  Would you?  American girl.  Fat chick.  Puts the lotion in the basket. 
[01:21:30]  It does this whenever it's told.  Would you?  Love that would you.  Hey, can we play Silence of the Lambs, the musical over here?  She's a great big fat person.  A lot of cursing?  Yeah, there's a lot of cursing in that one.  Frederica Bimmel?  That cursing gets in the way of some great radio bits.  Oh, yeah.  I think I got a card here.  Mrs. Littman.  You want me to get Mrs. Littman's number?  Stupid Mrs. Littman.  One of the greatest characters of any movie ever, Buffalo Bill.  Just a horrible underwater voice. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  The mumbling ass.  Pinching his own nipple with filthy fingernails.  Oh, rotten little awful tattoos, unfinished.  That's fantastic.  Well, we got the sex offenders.  Now Fox 5 is on it.  They get the house.  They get the girl.  They go online.  Get these guys that want to hook up with the 14, 12-year-old girls.  And lure them to this house. 
[01:22:30]  And little do they know, there's reporters there waiting for them.  And now recently, reporters and cops to arrest them.  And Dateline did it.  Did a good job.  America's Most Wanted did it.  And now Fox News has to come in.  I have an idea for this show.  What?  I think that we should do the same type of a sting operation.  But instead of doing it the way they're doing it, we ought to have cameras set up.  So if the kid shows up, we have them arrested. 
[01:23:00]  Ooh.  You could car crash me on that one.  It was just a thought.  Wow.  All right.  Here we go from Fox 5 News at 10.  I had high hopes for that one.  Long Island man goes to pizzeria to meet 15-year-old.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  Are you about a size 14?  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you. 
[01:23:30]  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  Word, you.  That awful couch he had in his rotten van.  All right.  Here we go.  Long Island man goes to pizzeria to meet, quote, 15-year-old.  All right.  You're about to see a story the Nassau police hope will be a wake-up call to a lot of parents.  It's about an accused sexual predator.  No, it was a wake-up call when Dateline did it.  And it was a wake-up call when America's Most Wanted did it.  This is a tap in the afternoon. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  Ernie and Nassus.  He's going to give us the wake-up call.  Ernie stinks.  He really does.  How do you go backwards on this thing?  Quickly, Ben.  All right.  I figured it out.  Nice.  Figured out something new today.  A lot of parents.  It's about an accused sexual predator.  And when you hear who he was hunting for, you'll see why cops are asking you to keep a very close eye on your children when they go online.  It is a sex thing you'll see only on Fox 5.  Fox 5's Andrea Day has the exclusive details. 
[01:24:30]  Only on Fox 5?  Well, that exact one, maybe.  Oh, come on.  Stop trying to claim the exclusive.  Yeah.  They all have to do that.  That's why we hate, hate media people.  They don't even want to acknowledge that this has been all over.  Date Line's on, what, their seventh try at this?  Remember the fat suit thing of a couple of months ago?  Right.  When every news person for Tyra Banks, they were all getting in fat suits to see what it was like to roam around as a fat person, how fat people were, great big fat person, how they were treated in public. 
[01:25:00]  Well, the fat suit, now they're doing it with, what's her name from, which one has Diane Sawyer?  Frederica Bimmel.  What?  ABC.  ABC?  Yeah, the black chick on there, I don't know, I forget her name.  She's now going to live as an old person.  She's going to live like an 80-year-old woman.  She's going to get the makeup.  How badly old people are treated.  And they're going to fix up her hips and stuff so they don't move just right so she has to, you know, walk around and feel like an old person and then she's going to do a whole report on how it's like. 
[01:25:30]  That's great.  I had an embarrassing experience with those stupid fat suits.  How?  I met a girl and, like, we were going to hook up and I'm like, all right, well, just take off the fat suit.  You look like a pig.  And she said, what fat suit?  And I said, oops.  Oops-a-daisy.  All right, here's the exclusive from Ernie Anastas and the gang. 
[01:26:00]  So, I was Andrea Day as the exclusive details.  Yeah, Ernie, this guy drove more than 100 miles and cops say it was all because he was hoping to meet up with a child.  But when he saw detectives and our cameras instead, he was so stunned he could barely speak.  I'm not coming.  I'm not.  Tip four, from where I'm looking now.  That's him.  He's looking around.  This could be him.  You're watching an accused sexual pedophile hunting for a young victim.  He's definitely looking around right in front of the pizzeria. 
[01:26:30]  An accused sexual pedophile?  Is there another kind, you redundant ass?  An accused sexual pedophile who enjoys children.  That's him.  We get it.  How do they know that it was him?  Because she said it was.  There's a lot of people going to the pizzeria.  That's him.  There he is.  Make the move.  He had condoms and a Barney mask.  He's looking for a young victim.  He's definitely looking around right in front of the pizzeria. 
[01:27:00]  He thinks he's meeting a 15-year-old boy at this pizzeria on Long Island.  He's at the doorway of the pizzeria.  This is definitely him.  What he doesn't know is that he's surrounded by cops and a Fox 5 news crew.  Base sweater, blue baseball cap.  He's walking towards the rear of the parking lot.  And we're recording every move he makes from across the street in a van.  Watch as he goes up and down the strip, looking around and checking his watch.  He's walking south.  He's down in front of the candy store right now.  As he desperately looks around for the boy he's supposed to meet, 
[01:27:30]  he has no idea cops have used a white van to block in his car.  Oops.  They stink at doing this.  I know.  This is not as exciting as the dateline.  The house and everything.  The house.  The guy walks into the kitchen.  Just out on the street.  Fox is all cheap.  Yeah, they're cheap.  They can't go the distance.  So what you get?  Video of a guy walking back and forth outside of his watch.  And by the way, let me tell you something about Fox.  If you're going to go after pedophiles, go after guys that are looking for 13- and 12-year-olds and 11-year-olds. 
[01:28:00]  The guy who's looking for a 15-year-old boy, that's creepy.  But that's getting up into the age where, like, it's like, come on.  There's somebody looking for a young age.  Yeah, it's called a gray area.  That's still pretty creepy, Jimmy.  It is creepy, but it's like, you know, he thinks he's meeting a boy two days before his 18th birthday.  All right.  Any other units?  He's in front of the wash and dry to laundromat.  Blue baseball cap, base sweater. 
[01:28:30]  Here's something else this guy doesn't know.  The 15-year-old he's been messaging online is actually an undercover detective.  Listen, I came here today with the intent on picking me up at the location that we met him in.  Detective John McGee was posing as a young boy in a chat room when he says this man, Dale Dietrich, started messaging him.  They've been chatting now for more than a year.  More than a year?  You know something?  You really probably think you got it in the bag after a year. 
[01:29:00]  If a year goes by and you're chatting, that's some dedication.  I think the cop fell in love with him.  No kidding, man.  I think we need to talk to the cop a little bit.  Yeah.  He's talking to him for a year.  He's showing up to work in, like, little knickers in Angus Young outfits.  Schoolboy hats.  Angus Young outfits.  Beanie with a propeller on it because it's 1962.  You're under arrest. 
[01:29:30]  Wait a minute.  Mr.  No one has a problem that the detective was at this for a year?  A year.  You don't need a year.  Sir, when are you going to close this case?  Any day now.  Hey, I'm just collecting all the evidence we need.  By the time they meet, the perp thinks he's meeting a 68-year-old boy.  A year.  Wow.  I've been chatting now for more than a year, and cops say what the 58-year-old wrote about will make you sick.  He wanted to have specific sex acts with the child. 
[01:30:00]  And he delineated exactly what he wanted to do.  Over the computer, Dietrich planned a meeting with a boy.  Ah, my name's Dale Dietrich.  I'm running a few minutes late, leaving here now.  He drove for hours to make it to this meeting, showing up in a gray Subaru with Pennsylvania plates.  This man was willing to come up here today and have sex with a 15-year-old.  Something an adult cannot do.  Wow.  News breaking.  Yeah.  Danny, you got something over there?  I thought you had something to add to this. 
[01:30:30]  Well, no.  I thought you guys were going to say something about how the reporter, Andrea Day, says the word Subaru.  Yeah, that kind of annoyed me, too.  How did you say it?  A Subaru.  Subaru.  Subaru.  Really?  She stinks, by the way.  Oh.  She came in a Subaru.  We've been face-to-face with her on a few occasions over the years.  Subaru.  She acts all tough on TV, you know?  She's got to wear the trench coat, and she's getting stuff done for everybody. 
[01:31:00]  She's a mover.  There's a lot he doesn't know.  We understand that.  No one thinks the pedophile is aware of the news camera.  You don't need to say that.  Wait, what do you mean?  He didn't say the Fox 5 cameras?  The cops.  What pedophile wouldn't wave and tap dance?  God almighty, enough.  You want a strip mall?  What a bunch of chislers.  What kind of exclusive footage is that?  Here he is filmed driving away.  Get a house.  Get a house. 
[01:31:30]  Go the distance.  It's the only way to do it.  They can only find a pizzeria, and they weren't even allowed to go inside.  No.  Of course not.  And when everything looks good, cops make their move, and we are right behind.  I think you can think about why we're here, and we know why you're here.  Dietrich seems stunned.  Take it down one more time.  After a year?  Your wallet?  Of course.  That's all you had on yourself.  Take that one.  Thanks.  When cops check his car, they find a bag of candy he promised in an email.  Oh. 
[01:32:00]  You cliche.  Pitch 15, not three.  How about an Xbox?  1920.  Yeah, your candy.  Your gifts stink.  Awful.  He brought the lad a gobstopper.  Candy.  When they frisked him, did they look under his fedora for a weapon?  Kid drove to meet you.  I bet you it wasn't in Fox 5's budget, because I'm sure they got the gifts from Fox 5. 
[01:32:30]  Candy.  Candy.  What a creep.  When does candy just become candy?  Even if it was cheap.  When you're a kid, it's everything, right?  Yeah.  But obviously, at 15, it's just candy at that point.  You don't get excited over candy.  Yeah.  It's something.  A PSP.  You know.  You know that was Fox 5 to make the story more dramatic, right?  Yeah.  Because candy and kids is always that thing.  Mm-hmm.  There's a...  I know.  They probably found like half a roll of Lifesavers in his dash.  There was candy in the car. 
[01:33:00]  Really?  He tried to lure the 16-year-old boy in with a photo of Holly Hoppy.  Fox stinks at this.  Andy, he promised in an email.  And a cooler in the back seat stocked with beer.  Yeah.  Put your hands behind your back for me, please.  You go through the cases and read what they've asked these children to perform, the sex acts  that they want to do.  You realize you're dealing with people who are pretty depraved.  Nassau County's cap squad is one of the pioneers in stopping internet predators from getting 
[01:33:30]  their hands on children.  But it's not easy.  It can take months, even years, to get just one guy off the streets.  They're dangerous predators, wouldn't you say?  I would feel they're very dangerous.  This man was willing to come up here today and have sex with a 15-year-old.  After the cops questioned him, we got a chance to ask him a couple of questions of our own.  Hi, I'm Andrea Day from Fox 5 News.  What were you thinking sending those messages to a young kid?  I don't talk to old broads.  Shut up.  Hmm. 
[01:34:00]  She'll just walk up and go, hi, I'm Buzzkill.  What were you thinking?  Hmm.  Ops questioned him.  We got a chance to ask him a couple of questions of our own.  Hi, I'm Andrea Day from Fox 5 News.  What were you thinking sending those messages to a young kid?  Dietrich was awful chatty online, but today he's at a loss for words.  Do you have anything to say for yourself, sir?  Anything at all? 
[01:34:30]  And Dietrich is now behind bars facing half a dozen felony charges.  And that may not be the end of all of his troubles.  We've been told police in his hometown in Pennsylvania have seized his computer.  They are out there looking for any evidence of possible victim.  Oh, no.  They got his computer.  Oh, they got his computer.  Oh, no.  She's so bad at this, I'm siding with him.  I'm rooting for him.  She's such a hack.  She's really terrible.  So dramatic.  Yeah, he was so chatty online. 
[01:35:00]  He was so chatty online.  Well, with the TV cameras.  Yeah, he had a one-year relationship cooking with somebody.  Right.  TV cameras might have made him a little nervous.  You know how people kind of clam up when they see the cameras.  Yeah.  And you're convicted or you're accused of a felony.  TV cameras, lights, and lots of cops.  Despicable crime.  Who does speak in that situation?  You want to see him nice and chatty again?  You shaved down our own Travis and send him.  Boy, I bet that guy would talk up a storm.  What are you here for, kid?  Hey, someone saw this and wants to add to this. 
[01:35:30]  Pat on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I was watching this last night.  The guy had a big old bag of candy.  Did he?  Why candy?  What were they?  Sweet tarts?  Were they gummy bears?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I offered candy like Mary Janes.  A bag of Mary Janes.  Biddle, honey.  Sweet tarts were terrible.  Here's 3,000 candy corns, youngster. 
[01:36:00]  Those little Valentine messages.  Molest you.  Engraved on the front of the heart.  Forget those memories.  Horrid.  Well, I guess we all could agree that Fox 5 stinks at the pedophile thing, right?  Yeah.  I knew it would happen, too.  You knew after Dateline did the bang-up job of catching these guys.  They didn't make it saucy enough.  And they didn't make it exciting enough. 
[01:36:30]  They didn't make it saucy.  They made it too much about them.  We were right behind.  We had to ask a question.  Hi, Andrea from Fox.  But we get it.  We know.  We know who you are.  We know who you are.  You're a do-gooder.  The big five at the bottom of the screen lets us know you're Fox.  We're all a bit safer because you're out there.  Exactly.  Thanks a lot for wasting a year on one guy who wants a teenager.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:37:00]  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony program.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Getting more comfortable every day in our new surroundings.  A little Jimmy Norton eating some fruit.  I'm trying to be healthier.  Fruity.  Yeah.  I've eaten a lot of fruit lately.  That Dr. Smith got me.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear. 
[01:37:30]  Dr. Ian Smith.  Jimmy.  Ian.  Oh, Ian Smith.  I thought he meant Zachary Smith.  No.  Some fruit, young boy.  Yes.  Wow.  That would be a different type of diet.  Yeah.  You chubby scallop.  Eat some fruit.  Would you like some candy?  Some candy, young William.  Oh, dear.  I like that.  What's this?  Fox News.  Wow.  I was just protecting William from a monster. 
[01:38:00]  Please.  William and Penny.  You just wanted some pizza, right?  Yes.  That's all you really wanted.  Dr. Smith needs pizza.  You just wanted a piece?  Spare me the poisonous bobs, Fox News.  It's a bag of candy.  Just trying to lure little William away from the horrors of this planet.  Woo!  Of course it's not Dr. Zachary Smith.  Dr. Ian Smith. 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  Dr. Ian Smith.  Smith.  Excuse me.  Just got me, like, in the fruit.  I've eaten a lot of fruit lately, and I had a smoothie, because you always have smoothies,  and you're healthy.  The smoothies are terrific.  I said it yesterday when I saw you get the smoothie and the fruit.  I was like, danger.  I almost didn't make it through my front door.  It hit me on my elevator.  It was like somebody laid me on my back and dropped a cinder block on my lower intestine.  It was like, you ever see toothpaste when it's squeezed?  That was what I felt like. 
[01:39:00]  Like, I had to stiff-leg walk into my apartment like Frankenstein.  I almost didn't make it.  And I'm like, it's going to happen in the elevator.  I don't know how your body knows.  It knows.  Like, your intestines know when you're pulling up to your house, if you really feel it.  You pull up to your house, and all of a sudden it goes, okay, I know we're getting close.  I know we're close, so I'm just going to start the process right now.  No, wait.  Your body goes.  You know, the whole show's been sick. 
[01:39:30]  What a great way to start back up on regular radio, commercial radio, terrestrial radio,  whatever they want to call it.  Hell, they call it.  Wireless.  On the wireless.  I call what Anthony got, so I'm like two, three days into this thing.  And my body finally decided to release this morning, and it looks like an anaconda going  back into the river. 
[01:40:00]  This is horrid.  I've been packing for days, and it finally said, all right, time to get back into the water.  Are you going through the detox process or something?  Of what?  Dr. Ian's thing.  No, I'm not doing his diet.  No, you're not?  No, he's just giving me some pointers.  Pointers?  No, because, I mean, this Fat Smash Diet that's all the rage, he's got a book and everything.  I think he's stopping by in the next couple of days again, because he just loves doing  our show.  So, no, if I did the detox, I would lose 15 pounds. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, you can't do it.  I don't want to lose 15 pounds, maybe like a couple.  I want to lose 15.  Well, if you do the Fat Smash Diet with the detox, you're going to be right there.  I know.  So, the smoothie was a problem, huh?  Wow.  I mean, in the elevator, I'm like kind of measuring how much I could hold in each shoe.  I almost did it again in my apartment.  All right.  Other things going on today?  Steve's not here, so I guess we're going to have to do this on the second half of the 
[01:41:00]  show today.  It's Steve.  But he sent out an email, and some guy wants to give us guns.  Like, it's really weird.  A lot of people are sending in gifts, because for some people, it's the first time they're  hearing us in four years.  So, there's a big celebration going.  And Steve got an email from a guy that just wants to give us guns.  Guns, yeah.  Real guns.  Yeah.  And your email back to him was hilarious.  Like, what is wrong with you?  I go, yeah, how many lunatics are getting in contact with Steve on a daily basis? 
[01:41:30]  And he said upwards of six to seven hundred just kooks.  But I appreciate it and everything, but I'm going through the process right now of getting  my pistol license, so I can't accept pistols.  I can't accept handguns at this point.  It's just highly legal.  I don't know.  The guy just wants to send in guns.  He's a huge fan, and he just wants us to have lots and lots of guns.  Where is he from that he doesn't understand New York City, especially, gun laws? 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  We'll get into that a little later on this morning.  What a dope Steve is to forward that, like, it might be serious.  This guy just wants to send in a Molotov cocktail.  Do you guys want them?  Is it okay?  Head grenades.  We have to start a new feature with Steve because the stuff he suggests, it's ridiculous.  It is ridiculous, the emails he gets and the stuff he comes to the table with.  He forwards him like a good soldier.  He doesn't know.  Right.  Perhaps he thinks I might want to run an illegal gun running ring out of my house, and this 
[01:42:30]  guy might hook me up.  By the way, I know why he does this, because Steve is an ass.  That's one explanation.  That's the only reason he would do that.  He's an ass.  All right.  Other things going on.  John Daly in the news.  $60 million to gambling.  Over $60 million he's lost to gambling.  He's fessing up to.  And wow, I enjoy Atlantic City. 
[01:43:00]  I enjoy Vegas.  I enjoy going to Foxwoods.  But you keep things in perspective, and there is no way you could gamble away $60 million  and it's anyone's perspective.  That is just a gambling addiction gone horribly wrong.  The guy obviously has no one around him that is a friend or anything to keep him in line.  Well, his fellow golfers have been trying to take care of this guy for a real long time. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  You know how bad a gambler you are when you said to yourself, I wish I had only lost $50 million?  Yeah.  At last 10, I could have parlayed into...  John Daly says he has lost between $50 and $60 million during 12 years of heavy gambling.  You don't even know?  Like, there's a $10 million buffer there that he's not sure of.  Just not sure.  $50 to $60 million.  How much do golfers make?  I mean, I realize that they're paid, but I mean, how do you kind of not know if it's  $10 million this way or that way?  It's not even about the money you make on the tour anymore. 
[01:44:00]  It's all the endorsements.  That's where they can make most of their money.  And that it has become a problem that could flat out ruin me.  It could flat out ruin you?  Yeah, I think...  How much money do you have?  He chalked up a lot of debt doing this, too, because a lot of these guys lose this much  money, but they don't have it.  They lose it in markers and loans.  But do you understand this?  He's lost between $50 and $60 million, and this could flat out ruin me if he doesn't bring  it under control.  After $60 million, you're beyond the point of bringing it under control. 
[01:44:30]  Daily discussed his addiction to gambling in the final chapter of his book.  That's going to be released next Monday.  He told one story of earning $750,000 when he lost in a playoff to Tiger Woods last fall  in San Francisco at a World Golf Championship.  Instead of going home, he drove to Vegas and says he lost $1.65 million in five hours, playing  mostly, are you ready for this, $5,000 slots.  And he's playing slot machines?  $5,000 slot machines. 
[01:45:00]  At least have some fun playing cards.  Just got a note from Steve.  At least wait until I'm in the room before you throw me under the bus.  He's back at the yellow joint learning some stuff today, right?  How about this, Steve?  I'll throw you under now and back over you when you're in the room.  What do you think of those apples, punk?  Well, show them.  Tough talk.  Yeah, that's a lot of money to lose.  Oh, man. 
[01:45:30]  He's in deep.  The two-time major champion wrote that he spent the last 10 years paying off gambling debts  with his sponsorship income, hustling appearance money, and running myself ragged, doing corporate  outings instead of spending time with my family and working on my game.  He said he owed $4 million to casinos in two years of gambling until he won the 1995 British Open at St. Andrews, his second major.  $4 million.  They invented the game, called it golf without the L.  And because he won that tournament, he was able to pay his debt. 
[01:46:00]  Lucky him.  Yeah, but the gambling continued.  John Daly, three-putter from 15 feet on the second playoff hole against Woods at Harding Park.  He headed to Las Vegas and lost $600,000 within 30 minutes.  He said he took out another $600,000 line of credit and lost that in two hours.  Wow.  What a jerk.  What's the most he ever dropped?  $200,000?  $200,000?  Yeah, $200,000.  I'm not like you. 
[01:46:30]  I go, I have a little fun, and then I'm able to just walk away.  I don't care.  Dropped about $2,000, $2,500,000.  That's about it.  That's a lot of money.  $6,000,000.  That's a lot of money, $2,500,000, but I mean, that's like, most people can relate to having  had a bad gambling outing, and then I dropped a grand or two grand.  If you drop $600,000 in 30 minutes, you should just decapitate yourself.  You have nothing to contribute to any of us.  You're a stupid human being. 
[01:47:00]  $2,500,000 was over the course of like a weekend, and it was a horrid outing.  Believe me.  I have fun gambling.  Love it.  Yeah, we'll get into that on a future show.  We've got to take another break because we went really, really late.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, Ben.  It wasn't Ben.  I know.  Ben's whole job now is to hold up a sign that says break.  Mm-hmm.  It seems like he holds up that sign a lot and very often.  I wish we had cameras in here so people could see Ben's tight shirt.  Isn't it tight?  Ben's wearing a tight shirt.  We're going to have the Pal Talk cameras. 
[01:47:30]  When is that going to happen?  When is all this stuff going to happen?  La, la, la, la.  We're here.  We need all this stuff done.  I do not know.  I don't know.  I think they're going to put the ceiling and the walls in, what, this weekend?  Yeah.  Hopefully the Pal Talk cameras by the end of the week.  Can we get that going at least?  Let's make that a goal.  We've got a lot of hardcore, faithful listeners, O&A Pest, that really want to see the inside  of this joint.  Take a break.  All right.  We'll take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Who's coming in to say hi to us, Ben?  Bruce McCulloch.  Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall, and he's got a new movie that he's promoting as 
[01:48:00]  part of the Tribeca Film Festival.  We'll get into that next.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony laboratory.  Oh, my God, baby.  Hey, guys.  Anyone want a bagel?  No.  No.  Stop ruining the show, Eric.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Feel the love.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  The first half of the show is going to end in about 15 or 20 minutes, then we're heading  over to XM Satellite Radio.  In studio, Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall of Fame, right?  Check it out.  I remember you.  We all remember Bruce.  A couple things really fast.  David Blaine, an update.  He now has like a deep sea diver mask on. 
[01:49:00]  Big helmet?  Big, huge, metal, awkward football helmet thing.  I heard he's doing his taxes.  He's doing his taxes down there?  Is that what he does now?  He got an extension?  It's such a hack stunt.  I don't understand why the city allows him to continue to do these stunts for our enjoyment.  Yeah, what's in it for the city that he could just, like if any one of us went up to the  city and said, I need to put a big fishbowl here in front of Lincoln Center and I'm going  to stay in it, you would never get clearance.  I want to hear from the second guy that also had a suggestion and they said, ah, no. 
[01:49:30]  No, we didn't.  Oh, the guy that didn't get the chance?  You got to think there's other guys out there going, hey, I got a stunt too that I want  to do.  What?  I want to be in my kiddie pool out on my roof.  No.  And just said that, no, you're not allowed.  It's a safety violation.  Well, the guy who was a big Danny Kay fan, she said, I want to just like bring a glass  coffee table and lay in front of Lincoln Center.  And we're getting to know Bruce.  He comes into the studio and he asked Anthony about his wife. 
[01:50:00]  We were asking about morning radio.  Right.  We were actually talking about the hours and that I have to get up at four in the morning.  And I, of course, realized that his marriage was probably crashing.  And he asked me, you know, that must be tough on the wife and stuff.  And I go, I guess not.  I bought her a house recently out on Long Island.  I've never seen it, but it is tough on my girlfriend.  I said, how old are your kids?  He said, oh, I have one that's three and four.  I mean, 15 and 16.  Oh, thank God, no kids.  No, I don't know where the, uh, where the X is. 
[01:50:30]  All I know is I own a house somewhere out on Long Island and I've never seen it.  And she apparently lives there.  I saw your girlfriend the other night.  She was in a bar looking really sad, just sort of fondling a urinal cake and crying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That was her.  It's the hours, man.  It drives people crazy.  So Bruce, what are you, what are you doing?  You got a film in the Tribeca Film Festival?  I have a film that I, it was the world premiere at the, uh, Tribeca Film Festival, uh, which  is the Triangle Below Canal, which I've just learned, even though I've been to New York  a thousand times.  Soho, south of Houston. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  Dumbo.  Uh, something to do with down under Manhattan Bridge Overpass.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's the, supposed to be the cool, hip place in Brooklyn.  See, Brooklyn, trying to get into that hole.  If we have a cool name, a lot of cool people are going to move in.  But that whole area is blowing up.  It's NoHo that has the problem.  Well, there's some area of Brooklyn blowing up this morning, showing it all over the news.  So I'm sorry, man, I just...  Burning.  Your film.  It's a beautiful thing. 
[01:51:30]  It's a film called Comeback Season with Ray Liotta.  It's the star of it.  Heard of that guy.  It's a cautionary tale about adultery and the revenge that wives and...  Why are you pointing at Anthony when you say that?  No, I was pointing at everyone.  He's absolutely right.  But, you know, I didn't expect the point.  We don't blame Anthony.  We don't point fingers here.  You were, though.  No, we do.  You were pointing right at Anthony when you said adultery.  We point all the time.  Look, we're pointing at you, so most people don't see it.  There's several fingers pointing at me right now.  I don't mind the point.  You're absolutely right. 
[01:52:00]  Thank you.  It was adulterous.  I had to fess up to that, I think.  I was a cruel and inhuman.  That was something.  What did you agree to?  There's New York state law with divorce where you have to fess up to something.  It's not like California where you could just say, hey, irreconcilable differences.  We didn't get along anymore.  In New York, you have to fess up to either adultery, cruel and inhuman treatment, or separation for a year.  And I just wanted to get things over with. 
[01:52:30]  So I think I fessed up to adultery.  That's fun.  I'm an adulterer.  Woody Allen in the 60s did a joke.  And now it just makes sense where he said something about adultery and having to commit adultery in New York.  And that makes perfect sense now.  Yeah, you have to.  Isn't that great when you get a joke 30 years later?  And also now it's funny.  And not only do I get it 30 years later, but I just mentioned the point of it without any of the humor included.  It was just a worthless waste of air.  Woody, a grave injustice.  I should have just thought it and kept it to myself. 
[01:53:00]  Pointing at you.  It was a who cares fact.  It went really long.  I don't even care and I said it.  At least you pointed it out for a long time.  And here we are.  There you go.  So back to the movie.  It's called?  Comeback Season.  Comeback Season.  It's about adultery, Ray Liotta.  What else?  That's pretty much it.  No, and it's about the revenge that the daughters seek on him.  And it's kind of actually a dramatic film about keeping love alive and sort of mature themes like that.  Does it all work out in the end?  It sort of works out in the end. 
[01:53:30]  It always works out.  And how are you involved?  I was the writer and director of it.  Oh.  Yes.  Of course, I'm not in it because I've lost my looks to the bottle, as you folks can see this morning.  So that was that.  So how was Leona?  I mean, obviously, I met him once.  He seemed pleasant enough.  We didn't work together as much as I do have the acting chops.  Yeah, he mentioned you.  He's a very intense young gentleman.  When I met him, he said, who starts?  Oh, okay.  Really?  Yeah.  Who starts?  Like wants to just get this rolling. 
[01:54:00]  Who talks?  You know, I guess we've already started, sir.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's kind of intimidating.  Yeah.  And he didn't know the kids in the hall.  He thought we were a bunch of fags in dresses, which is partially correct.  Partially.  Partially.  And so he didn't understand why, you know, because he's funny.  He's funny in this movie.  And he didn't understand why I thought of him for being funny.  Well, that's weird.  He didn't know kids in the hall?  No.  Everybody around him.  I'd worked with his good friend, John McGinley, who's on Scrubs on a film.  And so he knew me really well.  And they were friends.  He was trying to figure it out. 
[01:54:30]  And I said, sir, just don't watch our show till after.  Till after.  You can watch it later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Might get the wrong impression.  Yeah, don't confuse you.  That the writer-director, have him come out in a dress.  Yeah.  Do some weird bit.  You guys big Monty Python fans?  I mean, like.  Very much so.  I think if there was one show that we always point to, if it wasn't Hee Haw, for its obvious  reasons, those girls in Gingham tube tops, I guess they'd be pop tops, it was certainly  Python.  And it stands the test of time.  Yeah.  Which is what an old guy says, stands the test of time. 
[01:55:00]  Benny Hill doesn't hold up as well.  There was something just queenish and campy about it.  He found the hot broads with the big boobies.  When was the last time you even saw a Benny Hill episode?  They're still on Channel 9.  No, they're not.  They are.  I was told.  That was a great show when you were just a teenager, though.  Yeah.  I mean, like.  Well, it's because you had the blonde chick running around in the bikini.  The old guy was funny.  With the Benny tapping his head.  You would get all worked up.  A lot of lather. 
[01:55:30]  PBS was good for getting worked up before the internet or before cable.  Yeah, because they was all we had.  Well, they were sneaking in all the English shows and no one was watching.  Yeah.  Those English shows had a little more going on.  Monty Python, I remember, showed breasts.  And that was kind of like your first glimpse at a bare woman's breast when you were a kid.  And then, of course, National Geographic would have some shows on PBS.  Mad Magazine, sometimes you could fold it and see breasts.  True.  If you fold it the right way. 
[01:56:00]  The right way.  Very risque.  It's good that you guys like your comedy horny.  Yeah.  Well, growing up, you would.  Mad Magazine was huge to me as a kid, though.  That was like your comedy.  That was it.  Then I went to National Lampoon, and then porno.  Then it was just, you know, who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  I loved Mad until they trashed Tough Crowd.  There's a picture in Mad Magazine of Colin made trees.  Is Mad still being printed?  Oh, yeah.  And stop it. 
[01:56:30]  You were in Mad Magazine, and you never brought it to our attention.  I probably forgot.  You should frame that.  That would even have been trashed.  You could see it's made.  It's like a cartoon.  They would say the worst things in comedy.  Mad, of course, you know, kind of disingenuously painted itself as number one.  Ha-ha, give me those ribs, you.  You know, number one, worst thing.  Tough Crowd was number two.  Worst thing, of course, because we were more conservative than liberal.  And they gave Chappelle number three, I think, is the worst.  You know, top 50 worst things in comedy.  Kind of an honor.  Yeah, it was.  Of course, those dummies at Comedy Central took us off after that, but it was a good picture. 
[01:57:00]  It's like a little picture.  You can see who we are.  A picture, picture, or a character drawn?  A couple of caricatures of Colin, me, Patrice, and Nick DiPaolo, and each one of us has  like a little something stupid over our head that we're saying.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm saying something about the worst ones being hot.  You know, some dumb, perverted.  Or like that Woody Allen joke thing.  Yeah.  Oops.  That was a good one, though.  But then Woody goes, you have to in New York.  But no, no, wait.  You don't even know.  No, Woody said, wait.  No, no. 
[01:57:30]  Woody was like, um.  Great, I brought him back.  I met Woody once.  No, you didn't.  Oh, I did.  Did you really?  I had a photo with him.  Of course, I would never lie about meeting Woody.  Did you talk to him, or was it, hey, you, can I have your picture?  Listen to me.  When I happened to go to the premiere of Matchpoint, you know how it is.  Right.  You know, hey, Scarlett, you say hi to the gang.  And, you know, our manager, Woody is my manager, walked me over and introduced me.  We chit-chatted briefly.  Did you see Matchpoint?  Yeah, I watched it at the premiere.  Did you like it?  Yes. 
[01:58:00]  It was all right.  You guys ate KFC together.  That's their true story.  I liked it.  No, he was polite to me just because my manager was the same.  Otherwise, he would have just ignored me completely.  Did you put your hand on his arm and go, Woody?  No, I just shook his hand.  Wood?  We talked for a minute about something that happened in the movie that I was surprised at.  And he commented, oh, yeah, I was surprised, too.  And then we laughed.  How awkward was it when you had to leave because you knew your time with Woody was up?  This is how your time with Woody ends.  You're just looking at the genius.  Then you go, and you turn around. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  And you go.  You always hope, meeting, like, huge celebrities, that something's going to happen during this  short conversation that is going to click where you will get some type of relationship  that you know, maybe in the future, there's a phone call, there's dinner, there's hanging,  there's stuff like that.  I had that moment out front of the Italian place, Opie, when we met Seinfeld with the  guy.  Oh, that's right.  Seinfeld was with who?  I forget now. 
[01:59:00]  He was with some big, like, writer.  Yeah.  Actually, he was huge in Hollywood, but it's the guy that was with Seinfeld.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  I don't remember anymore.  I remember meeting Seinfeld.  And we were with some guy.  Yeah, some guy.  I don't even know.  No, it was another guy that was going to throw us on TV.  Yeah.  But he knew the guy that Seinfeld was with.  Right.  So that's how we got it in.  And we got introduced.  And I was like, this is Jerry.  I'm like, hey, how you doing?  And just trying to figure out some way to keep that moment afloat long enough to where I 
[01:59:30]  can be friends with Jerry Seinfeld.  I met Jerry Seinfeld miserably.  At Colin Quinn's bachelor party.  Jimmy introduced me on stage after Seinfeld went up there and did a little bit.  And I'm thinking, all right, he's sick of hearing about the TV show.  Oh, you're going to take another angle.  Oh, you got to.  Jackass.  You got to.  So I go, hey, Jerry, I really love that movie you did, Comedian.  Hmm.  And he goes, ah, thanks.  And then he's looking at me why I might like this movie so much. 
[02:00:00]  And I had nothing.  But that's now you're in.  That's a conversation.  That's what I'm thinking.  He was waiting.  I was in.  I said the right thing, something that not many people bring up because they're always bringing  up Seinfeld episodes and all that.  He doesn't give a crap about all that.  So I go, yeah, I really love that movie you did, Comedian.  And he's all, oh, really?  Thanks.  I really appreciate that.  And then I went blank.  I had nothing else.  And that's why I'm laughing really hard at Jimmy.  I just had to awkwardly turn and walk away.  And go, Jimmy, make believe I had something to tell Jimmy.  How about how about how about how about how about how about how about Seinfeld at the 
[02:00:30]  Italian restaurant said he was introduced to us then because we know who Jerry is, obviously.  And then our guy there goes.  And this is a radio's Opie and Anthony.  And Jerry just kind of went, oh, yeah, yeah.  And then and then as the guy we were with was talking to the guy Jerry's with, Jerry's  holding on to the door handle of the restaurant because they were headed in and kind of looking  at the guy like, anytime you're ready, I'll open this up and we'll go in and leave these  guys.  Yeah, he said a lot by just saying that, just saying that was like, oh, yeah, he's 
[02:01:00]  I like Seinfeld because at first you think like, wow, he's not really friendly, but he  grows on you, man, because he's so honest.  The beauty.  He really will not talk to you if he doesn't want to.  There was a look at you making it sound like you do have a relationship.  I have a crush on him.  It sounds like I like him.  Sometimes I'll run up and I'll go soup Nazi and we'll laugh together.  No, I just I've just seen it at the cellar so many times and very rarely would he say  hi.  We just I watched the whole thing comedian be filmed and I had nothing to do with any 
[02:01:30]  of it.  I mean, I was in a half a second shot by accident, but I watched one time a fan wanted a picture  with him and Jerry's like, all right.  And he was kind of cranky about it.  They stood side by side and the guy tried to put his arm around Seinfeld and Seinfeld  said, we don't know each other.  There's no need to touch.  I'm like, that's exactly what he wants.  He comes off like a real bastard.  No, but he's actually not to people.  He knows and loves and has a relationship with.  He comes off like a bastard to everybody else.  I guess he loves me then like any Bruce. 
[02:02:00]  Any celebrity moments?  It's sort of.  Yeah, I remember actually the first time when I was writing a Saturday Night Live, I met  it's not really a moment.  It's I met Timothy Leary and Madonna within an hour.  It's like the same day.  Wow.  That's a little weird.  Bruce, do you know Madonna?  Timothy Leary?  That's my Lord, Mike.  That's good.  And it's like, oh, I thought this was going to be fine.  And then it was all downhill from there.  You know, but who would you like, how would you even talk to Madonna?  What could you possibly say to this woman that you would have in common or be able to?  That's just it. 
[02:02:30]  Like you can't.  There are some people that are very easy to talk to and others that are like impossible.  Perry.  What's his name?  Pomo.  Pharrell.  Oh, Perry Pharrell.  Perry Pharrell.  Pharrell, however you want to pronounce it.  He came in and he was on such a different planet.  There was no talking to him.  Oh, he's on his own planet.  He is out there where he's talking about how the aliens are going to beam into his festival.  Obviously, he created Lollapalooza was whatever.  One of the big guys as far as that goes. 
[02:03:00]  And he was starting a new festival.  So he came on our show.  And he's like, yeah, it's going to be â€“ we're going to do an all-nighter and we're going to start fires and hopefully the aliens will land in the field.  Because with the energy of that many people being beamed into space like aliens, I swear to you, Ali â€“ and he was serious â€“ are going to come and feel the energy there.  And how do you just go â€“ you play cards, you play hold'em.  I like the hold'em.  Yeah.  We're picking bands that can communicate with the aliens from the stage and maybe the terrestrials will â€“ what? 
[02:03:30]  Sounds good.  What kind of car are you driving?  Yeah, exactly.  Where do you go from there?  There's no talking to him.  All you want to say is, you know, if you weren't a rock star, I'd spit my gum in your stupid face.  There it is.  That's the only reason I'm listening.  There's some people you just can't talk to unless they're, you know, big.  What do you remember about meeting Madonna?  That she was beautiful.  Was she?  She was lovely.  Yeah?  Did she give you an attitude?  Did she care?  Was there any â€“  She was really sweet and nice.  Yeah.  It's the dullest story in the world.  How many years you write there? 
[02:04:00]  Just one.  Oh, okay.  Then I got out and we did all the â€“  What was the year?  It was Lauren's first year back.  All right.  In the mid-30s.  It was a disaster.  The mid-30s.  Well, that was after Ebersole left.  They were good years after Ebersole left, right?  I mean, with Eddie Murphy and all.  They had a really good cast.  Yeah.  Did you have Murphy or no?  No, no.  I was after that.  Yeah.  I was 87.  Who was the cast?  You know, Randy Quaid, Robert Downey Jr.  The rebuilding phase.  Oh, Anthony Michael Hall.  Yeah, that whole thing. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  That one where you see him on TV and it's some kind of special where it says Saturday Night Live  Alumni and you go like, really?  I â€“ no way he was on SNL.  Yeah, that's true.  There were a couple of tough years.  Let's go to Colin in D.C.  Colin, what's up?  Hey, I'm a big fan of Bruce's.  Big fan of Kid and All.  I had a question for you, though.  Yeah.  When you guys did a sketch a while back where you guys are standing outside a house and  you're just yelling the name Lopez. 
[02:05:00]  Yep.  And nobody comes out.  Is that a slam on Mexicans for being lazy?  No.  We just â€“ we're bad writers, so we couldn't come up with another idea.  So we thought we would just do it over and over and over.  That was our impulse.  Sometimes that works.  Wait, what was the bit, though?  It's actually â€“ Lopez was a chiropractor, and that was more that chiropractors are lazy.  You know, if I could get some chiropractors in my hands, I'd snap their neck.  And I think that's more what that was about, the chiropractors.  And you know who you are.  You're listening with your lab coats and whatnot. 
[02:05:30]  They're very lazy.  They're a bunch of creeps.  They get on a couch with you, put their arms around you, and make your back crack.  You need an adjustment.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  I was seeing a chiro on the Upper West Side.  I'm like, why are you sitting on me with your ass?  Do you need to do that to crack my back?  If it was a chiropractor, what are you doing?  Why are your trousers down, and why are you on my face? 
[02:06:00]  No need for this.  This isn't helping my back.  My jaw was hurting.  The piss nerve doesn't feel as bad anymore.  I'll be fine, sir.  I'm not thinking about it.  You took my mind off of my backache.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, we're getting the wrap-up sign.  Yes, we are.  Bruce, we have the weirdest radio show in America.  Yes, I understand.  We do about two hours and 45 minutes here.  Then we broadcast on the street to our other studio.  We actually walk as we broadcast about a block and a half. 
[02:06:30]  And then we do another two and a half hours.  Wow, it's like the Inuit wasting no part of the animal.  You guys, that is a rock.  Use it all for clothing.  And today we're going to sing happy birthday on the streets of New York to this fine gentleman.  Did we get a cake?  And Master Poe.  That's Club Soda Canning and that Master Poe.  They're professional killers.  And it's not even their birthdays.  That's so beautiful and conceptual.  It doesn't have to be.  That makes Lopez look nice.  It's the double mint killers.  And hopefully our homeless guy will be out there. 
[02:07:00]  We're going to give him a Yankee hat.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's wearing a Boston Red Sox hat.  And what kind of money is he going to make in New York wearing a Red Sox hat?  He's the dumbest homeless guy ever.  So we bought him a Yankees hat so he'll get more money.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Steve, anyone outside with the birthday cake for the boys?  Not yet.  Yeah, see, we did.  That's a no.  See, we weren't thinking ahead of time.  Not yet.  We should have had a birthday cake that we could carry over to the other studio and sing  happy birthday to the guys.  I see matches in cupcakes.  That's what I see.  All right.  On the program tomorrow, the first half of the program, we're going to do No Filter 
[02:07:30]  Paul's coming in.  We're going to see how long he can hold his breath, just like David Blaine.  Oh, don't worry.  We'll make it fun.  And on Friday, we got the mousetrap thing.  Yep.  For tool tickets and cash and naked women and all that.  That's going to be cool as we get this show up to speed, okay?  Okay.  So, Bruce McCulloch, once again, the movie is?  Comeback Season.  Comeback Season with Ray Liotta.  Nice.  It's part of the Tribeca Film Festival.  And then what?  I'm writing a film for DreamWorks.  No, no.  I mean, what happens with the film? 
[02:08:00]  A lot of these films, because I saw the whole list.  Right.  A lot of these films, you know damn well, aren't going to make it to the regular theaters.  So, they take a peek and then they decide if you're going to get the movie released.  But not mine.  Mine's different.  Yes.  Mine's different.  Mine's special.  So, it's funny and sad and beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It won't end up on iFilms.  But I'm just asking, what's the process?  Well, we've sold all the world and you sell America sort of here in one of these festivals.  Right.  Tribeca or Toronto.  Picks up a buzz.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  Very good.  Do your show and then it all happens. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, Bruce.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  All right.  We're out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  And blah, blah, blah.  For everyone else, we'll see you in a few minutes.  All right?  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work. 
[02:09:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Finally.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  We'll be right back. 
[02:09:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?  One step from lashing out and still hear what it is.  You get under my skin and call yourself a friend.  I've got more friends like you. 
[02:10:00]  What do I do?  Is there no second anymore?  What it takes?  Who I am?  Where I've been blown?  You can't be something you're not.  Be yourself.  By yourself.  Stay away from me.  A lesson learned in life.  No terms are gone all the time.  Me.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[02:10:30]  Me.  Hey, are we?  Bam.  Bam.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  Are you talking?  It's Opie.  Hey, you know, yesterday I was singing over the music and I heard it on the replay.  I thought I wasn't on, but I was on.  Is Opie on?  Opie.  This thing doesn't fit in my ear.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  All right, there we go.  I'm fine and dandy.  I'm on the radio.  Broadcasting?  Hold on, guys.  So there you go. 
[02:11:00]  That's the first half of the Opie and Anthony program.  Where's the birthday cake for Clucks on the Kenny and Master Poe?  Hey, turn the music down, shit dick.  It's a windy day on the streets of New York City.  Oh, it's cold and windy.  What happened to spring?  Hi, Jimmy.  Your mic works today.  Yeah, and now you'll see that yesterday was a blessing in disguise.  What a treat.  Hey, guys, hold on a minute.  Yeah, what's the problem?  Where's the birthday cake for Clucks on the Kenny and Master Poe?  Why can't we get one? 
[02:11:30]  Why did nobody bring a birthday cake?  It's two of their birthday.  Oh, we got a fan.  I don't know.  I don't know where the cake is.  I didn't hear about that at all.  What?  How about just a handy instead?  Okay.  You want to give them a handy?  Are both these guys or what?  He's got two hands.  All right, yeah.  You could have bought a cake, sir.  I know.  I didn't have enough time.  You chose not to.  Who are you?  My name's Alex.  I've lived in New York 12 days, and I'm a big fan.  12 days?  Where are you from?  Vermont.  Vermont. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  So you're either gay or you make ice cream.  You know what?  What do you do?  Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  Why do we?  Because, Jimmy, we...  Uh-oh.  Wait, move over here a little bit.  We're losing the signal.  Do you have a candle?  Giggly girls always make good for radio.  Do you have candles?  Why don't you say hi?  This is our age TV.  Look, they're running away like Tony Bennett did. 
[02:12:30]  Kenny, what kind of pastry would you like for your birthday?  Isn't it funny?  Anytime you put a phallic symbol on a girl's face, they run away.  Hey, what is this?  Not particularly.  That's like some kind of cinnamon bun.  It's like a cinnamon bun in a cupcake.  Kenny, you've got to tell us what you want for your birthday.  What is that?  Don't...  Be nice.  Be nice.  I don't know if we'll talk.  We actually do want to make a purchase.  What is that?  No?  Can we get one girl to talk to us, please?  We are purchasing stuff.  What is it?  Walnut. 
[02:13:00]  Walnut?  You can talk into it.  There's just some likes.  I'm not the big bun.  Walnut.  Oh, see, I don't like the walnut.  No one does.  I like cinnamon swirl stuff.  Hold on.  It's up to Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe what they want for their birthday.  Please don't make a fuss over me.  You want a piece of cake?  There's a nice cake, Kenny.  It looks beautiful.  Coke?  Cake?  Let's just do the funny for the radio show.  Forget about me.  We need a piece of cake for your birthday.  Could you just describe those cakes for us, please?  This would be a very good commercial for Mangia.  Is there somebody with a personality that works in this establishment? 
[02:13:30]  Let's get out of here, these bunch of cadavers.  Jesus Christ.  They're not going to talk.  Fuck them.  They're not going to talk.  All right.  Thank you.  We were going to purchase a whole cake, but they don't want to talk to us.  They don't want to make a sale.  All right.  If you're in New York City, don't go to Mangia on 57th Street.  I'd rather eat at a Dan Greenlegs asshole than come back in a Mangia.  It's an awful place with awful Russians working there.  I like your dog, sir.  It's beautiful.  I loved you at the end of the third Star Wars. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  Oh, why did you shoot Tony Soprano?  All right.  We're slowly making our way to the XM Satellite Radio Studios.  Anyone else noticing that this bit gets longer and longer every day?  Hey.  And worse and worse.  That's the beauty of us.  What is Ben babbling about in the background?  I hope Ben's just talking about that.  That's actually bad.  Don't I like that?  All right.  Tony Bennett.  Set it up for tomorrow.  We're a chachi.  Maybe if we didn't all scream Tony Bennett at the same time and run at. 
[02:14:30]  What are we supposed to scream?  It was Tony Bennett.  Sinatra's favorite singer.  We heard that story.  The homeless guy ain't there.  The homeless guy is not here today.  Let's hopefully the $50 we fucking gave him save the taxpayers a lot of money, if you know  what I mean.  Maybe today was the day they had to remove the leg.  Oh, hi.  Hello, miss.  Hello, miss.  Let's go this way today.  Careful, Opie.  You want to go this way?  No, the green light's this way, Opie. 
[02:15:00]  The green light's this way, Opie.  Cross at the green, not in between.  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  What do they say to keep safe?  I still want to buy something for Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe's birthday.  Hi, miss.  Want to take a dump on me?  All right, Kenny.  As we wait for the light to change, I want you to sing your own birthday song for everybody  on the streets of New York.  Here we go.  All right.  Happy birthday to me and him. 
[02:15:30]  And him.  Happy birthday to me and him.  And him, too.  And happy birthday to me and him.  And many more.  Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe.  Happy birthday.  All right.  All right.  Crossing over 6th Avenue.  Hey, let's see if Fred Gwynn wants to say anything.  Free put a bad foot. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  Look around for our homeless guy.  Maybe he's sitting somewhere else.  Nah.  Yeah.  Where'd he go?  This is his spot.  He's drunk somewhere.  You know, that's why he's homeless.  He can't keep an appointment.  Exactly.  We were scheduled to meet here today to give him a Yankee hat.  I'm going to speak to his supervisor.  Now fuck some.  Improviser.  Oh, sorry, miss.  Just talking on the radio.  You do what you got to do.  I'll get her.  You dropped something.  Apparently it was your personality. 
[02:16:30]  She ain't buying it.  Awful.  Nice dumper, though.  Ugh.  Get the secretary spread going.  Exactly.  I kind of like that.  Yeah.  Put my face in there and just take a sniff and laugh while she screams and blows that  whistle in her purse.  Are we stopping for smoothies today?  Why?  Would you like me to shit my pants as I get into a cab?  No, smoothie.  No, fuck smoothies.  That story was tough to tell on the commercial radio there.  I think people knew what I meant, though, because I really was stiff-legging it.  That's a tall drink of water. 
[02:17:00]  Wait, who's that?  Kenny, go interview that guy.  Well, we're sure.  All right, good.  Don't get hit, stupid.  Oh, my God.  Kenny is going to get hit by a car.  Hello, mister.  What's your name and where are you from?  Pete from Staten Island.  Are you sure?  Absolutely.  What if you're not?  I absolutely am.  What are you doing on 57th Street?  I'm supposed to be working.  I just dropped my boss off.  Going to pick up my other boss.  How many bosses do you need?  I work for a family.  Which family? 
[02:17:30]  The family.  One of five families?  No.  You're from Staten, Italian, you said, right?  Staten Island.  You got it.  All right.  Okay, have a nice day.  Thank you for wishing us a happy day.  What a horrible interview.  It's the worst interview I've ever heard.  It figures that the mics would work perfectly today.  Yeah, if ever a mic should have gone out.  Look at how he runs across the street.  Oh, cool.  Ooh.  What's your problem?  I'm a fan.  Happy birthday.  Don't touch me.  It's my birthday.  Happy birthday.  Where are you from? 
[02:18:00]  New York.  Could you be a little more vague?  A little vague.  No, I live here in the city.  Where?  Upper West Side.  Ooh.  75th in Columbus.  Well to do.  What's your address?  That's it.  And what's your name?  Steve.  He is so flustered.  Get out of here.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Ooh.  All right.  We're out of here.  All right.  Let's go back up.  Let's just.  Now we go up and do our filthy show. 
[02:18:30]  The second half of the show.  I hate this guy.  Oh, here comes your pal.  I hate him.  It's your buddy.  I hate him.  It's your buddy.  I hate him.  Please confront him.  No.  We talked about this yesterday on the show.  I hate him.  Please confront your ID up.  Oh, it's a little chilly out today.  I like that.  Hi, sir.  How are you?  We're losing the mics because we're in the building now.  Yeah.  Doing good today?  I hate him.  Good to see you again today, sir.  Hope you're dead by the time the show's over.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone's ID. 
[02:19:00]  And we're at the elevators.  We're going to lose the mics any second.  Yep.  We'll be back up in two seconds.  And we'll be broadcasting.  Two shakes of a lamb's tail.  All right.  We're out of here.  We'll see you guys in a couple seconds.  Where the fuck am I?  The fuck is this shit?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We played on TV screens for drawings.  They ran saddened, took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women. 
[02:19:30]  Virus spreading in our area.  Find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button.  I'm me and Anthony.  I'm a black ninja, fuck face.  All right.  We remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  There's going to be some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:00]  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  And he.  Oh.  With Opie.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Your old Ben.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when boss fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls. 
[02:20:30]  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah. 
[02:21:00]  Don't just stare at it. Eat it.  You like that, don't you, faggot?  All right.  Wow. 
[02:21:30]  That was a fun little walkover.  Right up until the elevator ride.  What the hell was blasting?  Huh?  Yeah.  Me.  That was you, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  When we were all on the elevator with other people from the building.  Oh, that guy got so pissed off.  Jimmy started farting. 
[02:22:00]  Just when the mics cut out, we got on the elevator, a full elevator, and Jimmy just started farting  immediately, really loud, and they were horrific.  Oh, you heard them?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was right next to you.  The smell was like rotten eggs and ammonia.  And Kenny hit every floor, so now that lady's got to stand there and fucking breathe it in.  She's stuck in the elevator on every floor.  She went all the way up to, what, 12?  Someone will get on and think she cut a gas right and they'll get off.  The guy that got off on three is an ass.  Of course he's an ass.  He's an ass. 
[02:22:30]  Lumbering businessman douchebag.  Dude, we were this close to having Tony Bennett sing Happy Birthday to Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe.  You know what?  He knew who the show was.  He just kept going.  No, we kind of freaked him out.  We all just yelled Tony Bennett at the same time.  I'm liking that walking bit.  It has a lot of potential.  A lot of potential.  Supposedly, according to Ben, he's going to be out there tomorrow morning.  Hopefully, we'll have a birthday cake and we'll sing Happy Birthday to those guys, Belated Birthday.  And then we went into Amanja, and it was all giggly girls, which never works on the radio. 
[02:23:00]  And we couldn't get one girl to talk to us about the pastries and the cake they had.  We would have got a piece of cake.  We would have got a candle and we would have done it right.  So Amanja on 57th.  Yuck.  Bunch of Russians in there.  Bunch of no-personality immigrants.  Hmm.  Fucking.  Hey, do you think we could talk?  At least if we would have gotten that out of them, it would have been nice. 
[02:23:30]  We got nothing.  They backed off of those mics.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, wow.  Got the Paltalk camera set.  We don't have them at the new place yet.  When is that going to happen?  This week.  They need computers, yeah.  Starting to feel a little more comfortable over there, by the way.  Hey, let's get some of these whores up on Paltalk.  What do you say, Ant?  I want to look at some box.  All right.  Let me get the usual suspects up.  That's how men talk.  Let's go right to the phone and say hi to James in Florida.  James, what's going on?  You're on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, how you doing, man?  It's a special program.  First of all, I wanted to comment on how excellent the replay was without the commercials yesterday.  Yeah.  And the WNEW that you guys have been playing are really good.  And one more thing, if I can, I drive a truck and I go to West Palm Beach a lot and they have a billboard up now for you guys.  In West Palm Beach already?  Yeah.  Yeah, it says Jim Norton, Orpheum, May 12th.  In Boston.  Thank you, sir.  What a good sign in West Palm Beach.  That is a good plug. 
[02:24:30]  Let me explain.  A lot of people are trying to figure out what the hell is going on with the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, this is a huge move for us to go to commercial radio.  Absolutely huge.  We get to talk to a lot more people, which will bring bigger guests.  It will bring bigger situations to the program, okay?  Trust me on that.  But we're still trying to figure it out.  We're trying to figure out what's going to work.  Eric Logan has been working really hard behind the scenes to take the CBS part of the broadcast, okay? 
[02:25:00]  CBS radio part of the broadcast, which is obviously the first three hours when we're live,  and crush it down to an Opie and Anthony on steroids replay.  Yeah.  All right?  Because obviously they're playing a lot of commercials.  We're not going to make believe they're not.  They're playing a lot of commercials.  In a way, it's a little frustrating.  But when you're listening to that on XM, instead of hearing all those commercials, we're starting to bring all the old bits from the last time we were on radio before we got fired. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  Some classics.  So people are getting to hear a lot of stuff they probably have never heard before.  I'm not talking about the hardcore listeners that have every show of ours taped.  It's not about you, douchebag.  And on a 24-hour loop in your home.  I'm talking about the people that haven't heard everything, okay?  But it's still a work in progress.  We're trying to figure out how to do the replays because people are confused.  They're like, why are you replaying the XM portion of the show first, then the CBS part?  That's so you have different stuff to listen to for the regular commuters out there that do the 9 to 5 thing. 
[02:26:00]  During different times, or else you would be hearing the same thing on your drive home as you heard on your drive-in dial tone.  Right, so we're trying to figure it all out, but right now how it is, they're replaying the XM show, then the CBS show, and then the XM show.  So at 3 o'clock today, you will hear this part of the show, the XM show, then go to CBS, and then XM again. 
[02:26:30]  And the CBS portion will be on steroids, meaning it's going to be squashed down.  They're going to take a lot of time out of it.  None of the actual show we do, but all that commercial crap.  The middle stuff.  So, you know, just be patient.  We're trying to figure out how this is going to work for everybody and make everybody happy.  And we're trying to make it so you don't have to hear the same thing driving in and driving home, so you can listen to two different things.  Right, we're not really sure if it's going to work, but that's what we're doing right now.  We're going to play with it, see how it feels, and then we'll go from there.  We experiment. 
[02:27:00]  I have a question, though.  If they do, and this is a good question.  Oh, Jimmy.  I have a question.  If they do squeeze it down, the steroid version, you probably would be hearing something different because the time you're taking, like, three hours of radio and putting it into a short period of time.  So maybe that will have something to do with it.  Jimmy, you would think.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you what's going on here.  I don't know.  For some reason, XM, tell, tell, it has to be programmed in three-hour blocks, which doesn't make any sense to me, this stupid person here. 
[02:27:30]  So that's the big problem because when you do the math problem, three, if they were able to squash it down and then run it, yes, you would hear different stuff.  But for some reason, the master computer could only do three-hour blocks.  How about this?  Get in the master computer and fucking fix that for this station.  Yeah, how about we get someone down at XM that has a creative mind and go, okay, I understand this is how it worked before we got actual talent on satellite radio.  Because when you're just playing music and having a lot of music channels, all that makes sense. 
[02:28:00]  It makes it very easy, okay?  But now you've got some creative programming on XM.  So someone has to figure out how to make this work instead of these dumb three-hour blocks.  I know I'm getting way too inside for a lot of people, but that's the problem.  It's three-hour blocks.  That's why at 9 o'clock, for some reason, they have to cut into our walkover to do a stupid station ID.  Wait, XM does?  Yeah, to reset the whole thing.  That we're not warned about. 
[02:28:30]  Because if it's about doing some legal ID, it's not because on satellite you don't have to do legal IDs.  Then we would just read the dumb thing as we're walking over.  Yeah, that really does have to be fixed.  There's no reason that the broadcast should be interrupted.  I mean, to put it in basic terms, it's a system that was put in place before we came aboard at XM.  And at the time, it made sense.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  It doesn't make sense.  Do you understand?  And I don't know if people can get this.  To put this into perspective as to how ridiculous this is, there's a possibility that that ID could interrupt something I'm saying. 
[02:29:00]  Perish the thought.  Let everybody just think about that for a second.  Perish the thought.  Then again.  That's what, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Then again.  No.  It can't be a good thing.  Then again.  Is that your BCN jacket?  It's certainly, it's a sweatshirt.  You took it.  You bitched about what they brought, yet you took it. 
[02:29:30]  Of course.  I'm going to wear the sweatshirt.  All right.  Why not?  I don't have one from any other stations.  Although I do have an Aussie thing that's tied.  Yes, you do.  I'm YSB.  I'm YSB.  Rich the trucker, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I just wanted to tell you guys that, you know, I'd rather hear the CBS portion first because  y'all did a call back on XM yesterday about the Donald Trump interview.  I missed it on CBS yesterday morning.  And it's like, I had no idea what the hell you were talking about.  See, that is the problem.  The continuity gets messed up with, you know, with what we're trying right now. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  First.  I think they got to fix the stupid master computer.  Absolutely.  Because if you crush down the CBS show and get rid of all the commercials, then the people  that drove in with us and are now driving home will hear completely different stuff.  Completely different stuff.  It'll never match up.  That's what really needs to happen.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Love you guys, man.  Y'all take care.  Thanks.  We're working on it, man.  Thank you, man.  We're trying to do it so everybody's happy.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  I'd like to be happy in the pocketbook.  Well, here comes the question.  It's asked every day.  Victor in Baltimore.  No, I'm not leaving.  So don't get your hopes up.  No.  Oh.  No, that question.  Go ahead, sir.  Go ahead, Victor.  Hey, guys.  Just a quick question.  Yeah.  I understand by going to commercial radio, you do open yourselves back up to the nationwide audience  if you're syndicated, but XM is basically giving you carte blanche to do and say what  you want. 
[02:31:00]  Are you guys going to be happy doing the commercial radio stuff again?  We're going to take turns answering this question every day.  Okay.  It's my turn today.  I never answered it.  Victor from Baltimore.  We went back to regular radio because we love money.  Oh, Jesus.  Now go screw.  I'm not even trying.  Dude, I never had a chance to answer that question.  And a lot of people have said to me, like, you know, does this bother you?  Do you feel like you're going to be creatively stifled?  Whenever I want to be creatively free, man, I always know that I have May 26th or 28th 
[02:31:30]  at the Stress Factory in New Jersey.  Right.  To be as creative as you want.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And that creativity, by the way, is overrated.  It certainly is.  It's not that great after all.  You know what makes up for a lack of creativity?  For what?  Money.  Lots and lots of money.  I can be creative at home in my fancy digs.  You know what I'm going to do one day from the walkover from CBS to here?  What?  I'm going to put all my money in a pile that I made for the week, and I'm just going 
[02:32:00]  to rake it from one studio to the other on a breezy day and not even care when they go  fluttering off down the street.  And I'll do the same thing, but with a fork.  Hey, that's not a bad idea, actually.  It is.  Let's get a whole bunch of ones and a couple of rakes and see if we can keep the pile, how  much actually makes it.  Yeah.  Do you know...  Start a riot.  How about... 
[02:32:30]  You know, this walk thing has a lot of potential.  Mm-hmm.  One day, I promise, I'm going to get lots and lots and lots of ones.  And not just a couple hundred.  I will commit.  Ooh.  And one day, on a windy day, when we know it's just going to be a windy day...  Just let them loose?  Let them loose.  Wow.  You are rich.  Let them loose.  Flutter, flutter, flutter.  Flutter, flutter, flutter.  I'll do the same thing.  And hopefully one of our fine listeners will be crippled by a speed bus. 
[02:33:00]  Stampede into the streets.  Trying to get that extra dollar.  I'll throw nickels up in the air.  Coink, coink, coink, coink, coink.  Clank, clank, clank.  I'll just lay there.  Coink, coink, coink, coink, coink, coink.  Ah, let's go to Mr. Old in Huntington.  Mr. Old.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, what's up there, fancy crack?  Um, yo, what's going to happen with ONA?  I, ONA, Ronan says...  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day. 
[02:33:30]  Ah, do shit.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  What's up?  I meant to call last week, so this is a delayed midget sighting.  Yeah, right.  A really good one.  All right.  I'm in Indianapolis, and they had the Richard Petty driving experience here at the Indianapolis  Motor Speedway.  Oh, no.  Yeah, and I saw a midget do the driving experience.  Now, sir, don't they give the participants the racing suits and everything?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they had, they had, I don't know if it was pre-planned, but they actually had the  booster seat to go in the passenger seat.  So he wasn't driving, but he was riding in it.  Oh, that's really funny.  So I don't know if this was pre-planned or what the deal was, but I saw him climb in and  strap in into the booster seat.  It was probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  He was Richard Petit.  I fully expected that. 
[02:34:30]  I know, but he's laughing.  Yeah.  They got a laugh out of him.  You don't have to laugh at every attempted joke.  That was good, though.  Anything else you could give us on this or what?  Richard Petit.  Just that it was something you had to see for yourself, but it was an ozone midget sighting.  I had to report it.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  To answer the Ron and Fez question, yes.  They've been fired.  Hey, by the way, speaking of racing, our boy Jimmy Johnson, we don't know anything about 
[02:35:00]  NASCAR, but we like the guy, and he's on our show.  He won Talladega.  He won?  Every time he talks to us, he wins.  He ought to now continue this.  Didn't he talk to us before Daytona 500?  Yes, he did.  And he talked to us before Talladega.  He won Talladega.  And I happen to know we're the only show that he did talk to before those races.  He couldn't have possibly done any other press.  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  Can we get him on the show today?  I would love to talk to Jimmy Johnson about his big win at Talladega. 
[02:35:30]  He's good.  He's good.  He did great.  Richard in Missouri, what's up?  Hey, you guys are going to smash me, but I'm going to explain why.  The replays don't work for people who listen at work.  All righty, sir.  Well, see, I head up here at 8 o'clock every day, right when the XM replay starts.  Right.  And it used to be where I would listen to the XM portion at work, but I would look forward  to 2 o'clock Central Time, where I could listen to the CBS version and close out my day. 
[02:36:00]  But now I hear the same show twice at work.  It's going to happen, dude.  You're going to have to bear with us.  Yes.  We've got to figure this thing out.  I think the words you're looking for are tough shit.  I just love you guys, man.  I'm just saying.  I'm not like a commuter listener.  You know, I listen at work.  It makes my day a lot easier.  You know what's going to be the best day for the Opie and Anthony listener?  Punch it out.  When they drop the prices on the portables. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Because we've got fans.  They have to hear every single minute of the show every day.  The portables, you know, I'm not going to lie to you.  The price is up there, especially the new ones, the Helix and the Enos.  They're unbelievable.  They're great.  I love mine.  It's so light and fits in your back pocket like it's your wallet.  But the prices are a little high still.  Wallet.  I believe the prices will eventually drop.  They always do.  I think you're going to see a lot of Opie and Anthony fans pick those up.  Because then you record the show and then you get to figure out how you want to listen.  Figure out when, where.  Right. 
[02:37:00]  You want to guess what got dumped today?  Yes.  Out of the show?  Yes.  You want to guess?  Wait, wait, wait.  I just looked at the email.  Let me.  I see.  What do you think?  There's one thing.  The anaconda thing.  Don't look.  Nope.  It was one thing that got dumped.  And actually, I believe it's the first one from someone on the show.  I think everything else has been.  Not when I said douche.  Don't get so defensive.  No, I'm just trying to say douche bag.  Well, I like to say piss off a lot.  And I'm surprised they're letting that go through. 
[02:37:30]  No, pissed off is okay.  Just don't use it all a lot.  Right, right.  And as long as it's not in the context of urine, pissed off is okay.  Was it our crap discussion?  No.  No, it was actually pretty late in the show.  Late in the show?  Late in the show.  And it was a line from, can I tell you who did it?  Yes.  It was Jim Norton.  Oh, you.  I fooled you.  You tricked me out.  Oh, you guessed it was Jimmy?  No.  Do you know what line it was?  Do you know what line it was? 
[02:38:00]  But do you know because you know?  Yeah, I got an email.  Oh.  Oh, forget that.  What the fuck?  What was it about?  Hey, would you crap your pants?  No homo.  I was thinking about that no homo thing all night long, man.  I listened to it on the replay.  I was laughing my ass off.  What was the line?  Hold on.  I'm going to look too because I want to play along.  Let me see.  Okay.  Let me see.  When did I say it?  845.  It was said.  Oh.  849.  849.  Yeah, I guess they, should they have dumped out of that? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, and you know something?  I'm kind of proud of myself.  I thought they were going to dump out of this.  But this was the only dump.  Yeah, the only dump.  And this is, we're not getting dumped a lot.  We're not getting dumped a lot and a lot of, you know, a lot of people are surprised  at that.  Yeah, we know how to do regular radio.  And the jackasses.  And the show's been, you know, it's been entertaining.  It's going to get a lot better.  Yeah, it's brand new surroundings and everything.  But every day, I feel like we're getting more in there, getting more comfortable, talking  more naturally.  It's weird when you first step into that studio or any gig to get acclimated to everything. 
[02:39:00]  It was the same way at WNEW.  If you remember the first few shows there, it was just me and you, Ope.  And we sat there and pretty much, like, just babbled about things, but didn't really  have a rhythm.  It's very hard.  I'm surprised how well it's going so far.  I know.  Another couple weeks, you're not even going to know the difference, except for the long  commercial breaks.  But then, you know, it's a steroid version of the replay and all that.  But trust me, we'll have it all figured out.  Here is the line from Jimmy Norton that got dumped. 
[02:39:30]  Can you say what it was in reference to?  All right.  Well, I'm kind of hard.  The subject?  It was such a throwaway line.  I don't really remember.  No, I can't really describe where or anything because it was just kind of a line.  Yeah, it was a line.  Why are your trousers down and you're sitting on my face?  The chiropractor.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That was the line.  No, I could see why.  Believe me, I'd rather not. 
[02:40:00]  But I could see why.  It's describing, you're giving a pretty good description now, trousers are down, sitting  on my face.  I disagree.  I'll tell you why.  Not because I said it, but because it's such, I purposefully didn't say teabagging or something  sexual.  Sitting on someone's face, using somebody's face as a chair is not a sexual act.  Being naked and sitting on someone's face is not an FCC violation at all.  Yeah, it is.  You can't give that graphic, even though to us that's nothing, but that is too graphic 
[02:40:30]  a description of what's going on.  You can either have the trousers down, you might even be able to sneak into sitting on  the face in the right context, but not, why are your trousers down and you're sitting  on my face?  Conjures up too graphic an image.  Wow.  I can almost understand if it was like in the middle of a sexual...  Guilty!  No, no, no.  Guilty!  All right.  I disagree with that, though.  And there it is for your trivia people, the first dump. 
[02:41:00]  Hey, man, I want to play this.  From Jimmy Norton.  I want to play the no homo promo, but it's not queuing up.  The line I was going to add to it was really much funnier.  What was that, Jimmy?  I got that.  Why are your trousers down and you're sitting on my face?  Conj, pussy, fuck, fart.  And I edited that.  Well, that might have skated through.  Who's the fat pig?  Anyway.  That didn't get dumped out of, by the way.  That was another line that was said earlier.  Let me see fats out.  Which one? 
[02:41:30]  That one you just said.  Who's the fat pig?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm missing all this.  Wow.  Yeah, you're not missing much.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Open up your discovery cam.  Oh, God.  I hate when I don't know.  It's really easy.  You'll see the one.  She has fucking hay in front of her.  I need the Hubble Telescope pal talk camera to get all that in.  All right.  The no homo promo, Steve.  What's this about? 
[02:42:00]  Using Bobby's little definition from yesterday, me and the boys came up with an idea for a PSA.  A PSA?  Based on the no homo concept.  Yeah, man.  That was a little weird yesterday.  Just in case you weren't listening yesterday, Bobby, one of the guys behind the scenes that  I'm proud to say doesn't work for our show officially, likes to touch other guys.  He likes to kiss them on their shoulders.  He likes to grab their packages very lightly, and he likes to scoop their ass a little bit. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, rub his hand from the taint area up the butt crack and then say, what, did you  crap your pants?  Right.  As a little joke.  Right.  And then it's okay because he yells out no homo after he does it.  Although he didn't after any of those certain things.  But he's saying that when he does do these with his friends, you just say no homo and  it's not gay anymore.  Renders it null and void.  Well, let me just throw this out.  Not that this means anything.  Hey, fat whore, close your camera.  Yes, that was kind of an awkward...  Holy shit. 
[02:43:00]  No hot-o.  I'm trying.  There's something there.  She has no idea we're talking about her either.  Why would she?  She's too busy thinking of food and other ways she can fucking have comfort without exercise.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Eddie Superstar is on the line.  Eddie!  Yo, what's up, Bo?  What's up, Eddie?  How you doing?  I'm good.  How's the garbage?  The garbage is good.  Everything's going well over here.  Superstar!  Superstar!  How you guys doing? 
[02:43:30]  Are you still delivering the mail, Eddie?  Yes, I am.  Yeah?  Doing it all.  So what are you doing calling our fine program?  Eddie used to work with us at WNEW.  Right.  And...  Check in to see how you guys were doing.  And his job was to empty the garbage and to deliver the mail to the wrong mail slots.  No.  I never delivered it to the wrong mail slots.  I had help.  Yeah.  So what's going on today, Eddie?  Same old stuff.  Yeah.  Are you retiring soon?  Yes.  You are?  When? 
[02:44:00]  At the end of June, supposedly.  And where are you going to go after that?  Sebastian, Florida.  Who are you going to live with?  My sister.  Your sister?  Yep.  She must be very, very excited.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope everything's going...  Everybody at WNEW is going good.  My sister, Sarah.  You got a girlfriend, Eddie?  Nah.  Nah?  Nah.  Everything at WNEW is going well.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Everybody's been asking for you guys.  Yeah.  Well, tell them to go screw.  Yeah.  No.  No.  I can't tell them that.  Ask them where the phone calls were when we were on the sidelines for two and a half years. 
[02:44:30]  Ask them that, Ed.  Yeah.  Why don't you ask them that, Ed?  Yeah.  Okay.  Tell John Montone to shove a fist in his ass.  Oh, okay.  John is a friend of mine.  Yeah, is he?  Then you tell him.  Everybody.  All right.  Well, Eddie, it's good to hear from you.  Same here, Opie and Anthony.  You know, good luck on your retirement, because I'm sure we're not going to talk before then.  Yes, you will.  Yes, we will.  Of course.  We won't.  Definitely.  I keep in touch with my friend.  Maybe we should go to the Brooklyn Diner for a little lunch so you can stare at all the 
[02:45:00]  girls' boobies.  Okay.  Not too uncomfortable when that happens.  Exactly.  The bigger the boobs, the longer the stare.  Right, Eddie?  Yep.  He knows.  Everything's going well.  This is very uncomfortable, though, man.  Yes, it is.  Yep.  So I just want to congratulate you on your great deal over there.  Oh, thank you, Eddie.  Come by and see us, will you?  I will.  One day soon, yeah.  Scott Herman says hi.  Okay.  All right.  It's Eddie, everybody.  Superstar Eddie.  Eddie.  Okay. 
[02:45:30]  Eddie?  Yes.  Yes.  Eddie?  Yes.  All right.  So, Eddie.  Yes.  Where are you going to be living in Florida?  Sebastian, Florida.  Sebastian, Florida?  Yes.  Can you tell us a little bit about what that's like?  It's going to be different.  Like, what's it like?  What's the weather like there?  It's going to be 95, probably, all the time, but I won't have to worry about snow and stuff  like that.  What are you going to do for fun down there? 
[02:46:00]  There's baseball teams and stuff, football teams.  Smother a few babies.  Do you ever pet a girl's hair in the barn?  No.  Do you attend rabbits when you're down there?  No.  This is us trying to be nice.  I mean, please, Eddie, just hang up.  You're killing us.  Okay.  I will.  This is like, you can't do this.  Okay.  Talk to you guys later.  Eddie, thank you so much for the phone call.  Wait, Eddie.  Eddie, wait.  Yo.  Yo.  Eddie. 
[02:46:30]  Eddie.  Yo.  Eddie.  Yeah.  Pete Rose here.  Eddie.  No.  Eddie, you know we love you.  I know you do.  All right.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye.  Eddie.  Yo.  All right.  That's super stuff.  So, the no homo promo.  We've got to take a break because Carlos Mencia is outside.  Right.  He's going to have some great stuff to say about this immigration thing, I'm imagining.  Perfect day to have him in.  So, what's the no homo promo about? 
[02:47:00]  No homo promo.  It's a little PSA that the guys and I came up with based on Bobby's little rule of the  phrase, no homo when invoked nullifies any really gay behavior.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Here at the Opie and Anthony Show, we encourage our staff to be open and honest with one another.  But sometimes, the lines of communication get crossed.  And in order to alleviate confusion, simple rules need to be put in place to protect our  employees.  Introducing the no homo rule.  Put simply, the no homo rule states that any overtly homosexual comment is rendered meaningless 
[02:47:30]  when a simple no homo is invoked.  For example...  You know what, Nathaniel?  I wouldn't mind tasting your semen.  No homo.  Even the most disturbing comments from a closeted intern become trivial when applying the no  homo rule.  Oh, Eric, I want to stare into your eyes lovingly while I masturbate you.  No homo.  Ultimately, the entire staff feels more comfortable knowing that this behavior is all in good fun. 
[02:48:00]  Say, guys, I would love to bury my cock balls deep in your anuses.  And...  Oh, sorry.  Please...  Is this even a bit anymore, Travis?  I'll let you decide.  Hee hee.  Oh, my God.  What?  These guys are sleep deprived.  That is funny.  That is funny, man.  The no homo game, see?  No homo rule.  Why does Travis have to play the gay guy in all your promos, Steve?  Play.  Gee, why does it all play the black guy? 
[02:48:30]  He's the homo promo.  Or the promo homo.  God damn it.  Can they fix this, Mike, so it doesn't fucking fall?  No.  No.  They've tried it.  There you go.  That's good.  If you weren't leaned back so far, so it has to stick straight out.  See, there's no anything about leverage.  Let it go.  Let it go.  It's going to...  It just keeps falling.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We got Carlos Mencia joining the program in...  I'll take a leak.  ...just a few minutes.  Speak the truth.  Come make your peace on my way. 
[02:49:00]  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I never knew, but I believe that you're trusting me.  Oh, speak to me.  Speak the truth.  Come make your peace on my way.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, we're back.  Thanks, Dr. Steve, for sending us.  Congratulations on this historic move. 
[02:49:30]  Vindication at last.  I wish you all the best.  Your pal, Dr. Steve.  We love Dr. Steve.  This is addressed to the staff and interns of Opie and Anthony.  He sent us a gift basket.  If that should be addressed to staff,  if the interns put their dirty fingers in that chocolate,  I'll fucking chop them off.  What chocolate?  Exactly.  The chocolate I brought home?  Good time.  I brought some of it home.  I took a couple pieces.  No, no, I just opened it.  Oh, there's another one?  Yeah.  We're getting gifts like every day.  Very yummy. 
[02:50:00]  Dude, you're on the Fat Smash Diet.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm smashing this in my mouth.  He's been trying to start the Fat Smash Diet for a second.  Ah, that's fucking good, man.  Have some chocolate.  Godiva?  Ah.  So, where is this?  Where is it?  He hit it.  I guess I'm going to bring it in.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  That was Godsmack and Speak.  Ben just gave me the latest CD.  I can't wait to check it out.  It's called Four from Godsmack,  and I think they're going to be on the program.  Who knows? 
[02:50:30]  I think at the other place when the studio's set,  so they could perform live for us.  Good.  People are getting the wrong idea about me.  What happened?  I don't know why.  Did we interview Carl Smitzio, by the way?  Carlos?  Because he's going to start talking.  No, that's all right.  Go ahead.  What are people doing to you?  They're getting the wrong idea.  Apparently, this email just came in.  Steve forwarded it to me.  It's from a couple of gentlemen in New Zealand.  They listen online.  Enjoying the show from the Internet down here. 
[02:51:00]  Ant is our hero.  We have a lot in common.  Keep up the good work and keep the faith, Ant.  Sig Heil.  And they sent pictures of themselves.  They are covered in swastika tattoos,  and they are white supremacist Nazis from New Zealand.  And apparently, they are getting the misconception  that I am some type of Nazi.  Well, how would they get that?  They're brave Nazis, by the way.  They pick New Zealand. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, isn't that like the whitest country in the world?  A lot of Malor Indians.  No, I'm not kidding.  There are, huh?  There was no joke attempt there yet.  A lot of what?  Malor Indians.  What are those?  They're like...  Like Aborigines.  Yes.  Yeah, Aborigines.  They're the Aborigines.  Oh, the Undesirables.  They were...  Did you ever see Once for Warriors?  Uh-huh.  Amazing movie about New Zealand and the Malors.  We didn't know you were actually going to give us a fact here today, Jimmy.  I'm the fucker.  I think that was a fact toy. 
[02:52:00]  Hey, Fatso, close your camera.  Shh.  You're on the Paltalk cameras, by the way, Carlos.  Oh, really?  Say hi.  There's people all over the world looking at you.  Yes.  There's a bunch of people.  No, don't do that.  From one German to all the rest.  A bunch of people and one manatee.  Good news.  Keith Richards is out of the hospital.  He's fine now.  After chasing a coconut, he fell out of a tree as he was trying to get coconuts.  A lunatic.  What a great story that was, but he's been released. 
[02:52:30]  How old is the guy?  And he's climbing up a coconut tree.  Falls like a stone.  I get it.  Because he's in the...  Yeah.  Shut up.  Banned.  All right.  Carlos, you said you were thinking of Anthony on...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking of Anthony all day yesterday because we were shooting promos for my new special whatever.  I'm going to have a tour at the end of the year.  So we're shooting promos right now for the actual tour.  And the tour name was going to be My Name is Ned. 
[02:53:00]  That was going to be the actual name of the tour.  But then they came up with this concept.  So it's actually called Carlos Mencia, The Punisher Tour.  And every single time I would say The Punisher, I would hear you laughing your ass off in my head.  And I would actually hear you going, The fucking Punisher?  The fucking Punisher?  The Punisher?  All day long, dude.  We're up at like 12 midnight and I go, You gotta get that fucker out of my head.  And people are like, Who? 
[02:53:30]  Anthony, I keep hearing him say...  Well, I'll tell you something because it goes both ways.  Because I can't go through cable and see the movie The Punisher without...  Out loud, out loud, I go, The Punisher!  It has nothing to do with you.  Nothing to do with it.  It's a comic book friggin' movie.  And I go past by and go, The Punisher?  They're calling the Pal Talk camera The Punisher now.  Punisher cam?  The Punisher cam?  Yeah, you're on the Punisher cam. 
[02:54:00]  Hey, we should get into this immigration thing, man.  Because you're very opinionated and do some really, really funny stuff on immigration in general.  Recently, I cannot believe that black people actually have started to come out against the immigration.  I was like, What?  Black people were like, Oh, that's bullshit.  I was like, Listen, black people, I got nothing against you.  But let's get one fucking thing straight.  The only reason why illegal immigration exists in this country is because back in the 60s, you fuckers quit. 
[02:54:30]  Seriously.  Oh, boy.  Check out the actual year when illegal immigrants started to come in this country and when black people's civil rights movement ended.  That was the same year, 1965-ish.  I was on to something yesterday when I said Abraham Rodriguez.  I told you, Anthony.  I told you, Jimmy.  That's exactly what happened.  Black people said, Hey, listen, we ain't gonna do that shit no more.  Fuck that.  Fuck you, white people.  And Julio said, I will do it.  That's exactly what happened. 
[02:55:00]  And that's why we gotta watch this situation very closely.  We blew it once.  We don't want to blow it twice.  Is something burning in here?  What is that?  Yeah, what is that?  You smell it?  Yeah.  Someone starts cooking this time of the day.  From way out there?  Yeah, Bruce.  I swear, it smelled like the console caught on fire.  Yeah, no, it's Bruce.  He's cooking up something.  Oh.  Yeah, so the blacks stopped working.  Yes.  And then we needed illegal immigrants to come in.  Well, it's all the jobs.  All the jobs.  It's all the jobs we don't want to do. 
[02:55:30]  Julio just showed up.  Yeah.  Julio just showed up.  How many Mexican train porters are there?  Are there a lot of those?  Because I remember blacks had those jobs.  You're on a board.  You know, and they get your beds up.  There aren't any trains anymore, dude.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  How fucking back in time are you going?  I did.  He's in the 1820s.  You know, the stagecoach horses need someone to currycomb them.  How many Mexicans are putting out fires by handing a bucket from person to person?  No shit, dude.  He's a vampire.  Keep handing me buckets, Julio. 
[02:56:00]  Keep handing me buckets.  I know nothing.  What was that other thing you said, the thing?  With the stagecoach?  Oh, the horses had to be currycombed.  What?  You never used a currycomb on a horse?  It's that round brush that you put on your hand and you brush in circular motion.  It's the round brush.  Yeah, it cleans them out.  It's called a what?  A currycomb.  And how do you know that?  Actually, I used to have horses.  Forget Aristotle.  Fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[02:56:30]  More from Cowboy Anthony.  He knows a little bit about everything, Carlos.  You know, it's good to go through life not knowing a lot about one subject.  But if you know a little bit about a lot of things.  He just knows a little bit about everything.  A currycomb.  You get through.  A currycomb.  That's perfect.  Yeah.  So, what do you think of this immigration thing?  Dude, it's fucking hilarious.  Was the economy affected yesterday?  Do we know?  No, we had the big.  Is everyone back working today?  Actually, it was.  Like, I think Foster.  No, some meatpacking company, 20,000 employees. 
[02:57:00]  They close for the day.  I know more in L.A., like a lot of clothed manufacturers and stuff.  No, the reason why this thing is big is because they're crossing too many lines.  Now, like I was in Birmingham, Alabama, like about a month ago, and there's a place called  Hoover.  Have you ever performed at the, in Birmingham, at the club there?  No.  There's a club.  There's a club in Birmingham, Alabama.  It's in Hoover, Alabama, like a suburb.  And there's so many Mexicans in Hoover that they actually call it Guadalajara Hoover. 
[02:57:30]  Hoover, that's why this thing is getting, like, weird.  Because all of a sudden, I'm hitting Sikh, and it hits a Spanish station in Birmingham.  And that's why people are pissed off.  You know, because all of a sudden, you know what I mean?  The topography of your landscape is changing.  Well, the Hispanic population, fastest growing in the country.  Well, they bone.  All the time.  And they have nothing about it.  They have like five.  Dude, I have.  There's no English.  I mean, there's no Spanish translation to abortion. 
[02:58:00]  No.  They just don't know how to, you know.  They don't want to.  El Hangaro.  Why would they want to?  El Kiko with El Doc Martino.  El Pancho in the stomach-o.  Is that what you're saying?  But they don't look at it that way.  No.  They just have kids, and, you know, you get another one, and that's it.  No big deal.  Plenty of them.  There's 18 in my family, dude.  Who am I to talk?  18.  18.  You were, like, the last to come out?  17th.  17th.  17th. 
[02:58:30]  By the time I was born, dude, my mother had me alone.  With no doctor, no, nothing.  Oh, by that point, it's...  Nothing.  It's like having a cold and blowing it out.  It's not even a procedure.  For the last three months, I was in there, dude.  I'm, like, holding on.  Looking at the grounds.  It's like a slip and slide, bro.  It's like when you have an old car, and the floorboard's rusted out, and you see the  street going beneath you.  Yeah.  But it's like you watch a walk, and you see the rug.  Yeah.  It's like those old...  It's like the old cars that had the bench seats, and every time they turn, you slide  from one end to the other. 
[02:59:00]  Damn.  My mom actually didn't even know that I was going to be born.  Like, she literally was like, I want some milk, and whoever was with her went to go get  milk.  And by the time she came back, I was born.  You were born.  Like, literally, that's what I was.  There was no birthing pain.  There was no...  No labor.  There was like, I want milk.  Poof.  And I was born.  It was that badass.  Wow.  18 kids, dude.  How many hit you up for money since you hit?  That's a lot of brothers and sisters.  Dude, fuck you.  That's painful, man.  It's so fucking bad. 
[02:59:30]  Seriously.  I have a family phone that I literally...  A family phone?  I have a family phone, dude, and I answer it like this.  How much?  That's how I answer it.  Oh, wow.  I'm not even kidding you.  And then sometimes they get offended.  You know what I mean?  Like, I'll be like, how much?  I really don't have time.  Really?  Seriously, how much do you need?  Just give me a figure.  And then, oh, why would you say that?  You're an asshole.  We love you.  Blah, blah, blah.  20 minutes later.  But, you know, since you brought it up, fuck!  Now you made me waste my time talking. 
[03:00:00]  Yes, 20 minutes.  I don't have this kind of time.  What did you need?  And then, you know, I write them a check for whatever.  My sister called me up bitching that when I go on radio stations, I say stuff like this.  And she was like, I can't believe you.  You put us down.  30 minutes.  She puts me on speakerphone with everybody else.  Pissed off.  You're an asshole.  You're putting us down.  43 minutes later, they asked for $15,000.  Oh, Jesus.  I swear to God.  I'm not even kidding you. 
[03:00:30]  15 grand.  And I was like, are you serious?  After all that, I'm the asshole?  And you want money?  See, you got too big a family to be rich.  Yeah.  Are you close to all of them?  You got too big a family.  You're close to all of them, Carlos?  Yes.  Yes.  Did you give it to her or no?  Huh?  Did you give it to her?  Have you said no?  Like, have you said no?  No, no, no.  I was going to say no, and then my mom pulled out the, you know, Jesus gives you so that you  could give to everyone.  Ah, the Jesus.  She pulled out the Jesus Catholic line.  The Jesus Catholic.  I can't fight Jesus, dude.  No, I can't fight you.  I would tell my mother that fucking Jesus needs to cut the middleman out and just starting 
[03:01:00]  to hand you people cash because I'm giving you shit.  I have one sister, so it's easy for me.  Yeah, but, you know, when you grow up like Catholic, dude, it's, you're fucked.  There's nothing you can do.  You grow up Catholic, you go to Catholic school, it's done, dude.  They say Jesus.  You're writing checks and lighting candles.  It's that simple.  That's it.  Nothing I can do about it.  There's no comeback to Jesus.  There is no comeback to Jesus.  There's going to be college help in all the years because we love a big family, a lot of  kids, there's going to be like a lot of money, it's money for college. 
[03:01:30]  Wow.  I've already, I've already started college funds for not even, I don't even have kids  and I have like five college funds.  Wow.  That's how bad it is, dude.  It's horrible, man.  I have a nephew, he's like 11, and I'm just praying he becomes retarded and doesn't need  any kind of further school.  No fucking retards in my family, not one goddamn Down syndrome, not fucking one, dude.  Not one, every little asshole.  All those kids.  Yes.  14 kids, not one.  No cars, no college money, just hand them a doll.  Here you go, stupid.  Enjoy that.  No, I don't have no Down syndrome. 
[03:02:00]  Of all the kids in my family, dude, not one retard.  Not one.  So I'm, dude.  You're screwed.  And then the kids that aren't going to school are into skateboarding.  So I got to buy these expensive ass skateboards and these expensive ass shoes.  Dude, it does not fucking end.  What about medical benefits?  Do they have any?  Because now if they get hurt, who's going to have to pay?  Well, luckily, if illegals can get, you know, that, I think my family can too.  Oh, yeah, they just go down to ER and... 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, you would believe that.  Bullshit.  No.  And by the way, I do not believe that whole thing that these guys, that all these illegals  are going and taking up, you know, all the money from Medicare.  I don't believe that because I know fucking wetbacks, they don't go to the doctor, dude.  No.  They do not go to the doctor.  I've seen guys with, like, their hands chopped off.  Dude, you got to go to the doctor.  No, they're going to ask me questions and I don't want to answer.  It's like, your fucking hand is in your, your right hand is in your left hand and your 
[03:03:00]  right arm is up in the air.  Right.  You need to go to the doctor.  No, they're going to ask questions and then I don't want to answer.  So I just put a tourniquet.  It's like, all right, fine.  Get some duct tape.  Yeah, exactly.  I go to Home Depot, they fix it for me.  Let's go to Dan in Arizona.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Carlos, man.  You're fucking hitting it right on, man.  I'm a Chicano, too.  And what about your vehicles, man?  Do you ever have a vehicle at home?  Did I ever have a vehicle at home?  Yeah.  You know, did they borrow your vehicle all the time they want to use a truck or something?  Oh, do they?  No. 
[03:03:30]  You know what I did?  That's the smartest thing I ever did, dude.  I got, I bought a 1992 Nissan Pathfinder that was brand new for like, I don't know, five  years or whatever, then I started getting good money.  So I got all these other cars, but I never sold that car, ever.  So whenever they want to borrow a car, they can borrow my 1992, 198,000 miles Nissan.  Fuck it.  That's the car you take, bastards.  You do have a lot of cars, too, man.  Yeah.  Well, and what I started getting into is motorcycles.  So I got like 10 custom motorcycles, and they're all worth like 100 and something grand 
[03:04:00]  each.  So nobody wants to ride those.  So luckily, I'm off on those.  Because I'm like, if you crash it, you got to pay for it.  I'm not even going to throw it to you.  They'll borrow the money from you to pay for it.  Great show, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dennis in New York.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I'm a first generation American, and I think there definitely needs to be some sort of immigration  reform.  But I wanted to make one specific point.  I often hear people talk about how if they paid American wages for some of these jobs, you 
[03:04:30]  know, then Americans would work at them.  But there's another way of looking at it, too.  A lot of people in my neighborhood use, like, day laborers for garden work and things like  that.  If those people getting that work done on their houses had to pay American wages, they probably  just wouldn't have that service done.  So the way I see it, it's not really money out of an American's pocket, because if they  had to pay full wages, they just wouldn't have the work done.  Does that make sense?  Yes, and I just wanted to say that it made sense, but you could be the most boring human 
[03:05:00]  being I've ever listened to in my life.  What am I supposed to do?  Did you make a fucking joke out of that?  How am I supposed to make that a joke?  Oh, hey, hey.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  What the fuck, Jimmy?  What's this world coming to?  Exactly.  Can't somebody make a goddamn point, Jimmy?  You're a fucking comedian.  Listen to me, sir.  I don't make a joke out of that subject.  You're telling me.  You look a fucking professional.  I think that was a challenge.  Listen to me.  Uh-oh.  I'm not saying you had to make a joke out of it.  I'm just saying that you're...  Shut your mouth. 
[03:05:30]  You're a droning dullard, and we all lost interest after eight minutes.  Just get to the fucking point.  I didn't make a fucking act five years ago, faggot.  Fuck you.  What dirty language.  You certainly have such strong feelings, sir.  And Jimmy's doing a bunch of new stuff from...  That's right, sir.  You can't deal with my point.  All you can do is just make a fucking joke.  I can't deal with your point?  What is the point again?  What point, sir?  I got lost 20 minutes in.  The point was is that if they paid more money, they had to pay more money, they wouldn't  have Julio cut their grass, because the only reason why they have him do it is because 
[03:06:00]  he does it for five bucks.  Whatever.  Do you know how many people he said that to?  Do you understand?  Oh, I know.  This boar has had...  He's had that conversation in the mirror.  He's pretended he was in front of a group, and he's bored everybody he knows with that  point.  It's a valid point.  Nobody cares.  So what?  But you know what?  I believe, personally, having hired both recently, by the way, recently, just as a test, Cribs  came to the house.  And my wife was like, we are not letting Cribs come to this house. 
[03:06:30]  So I had to redo the whole fucking house.  And for one week, I had illegal immigrants come in and do the painting.  And then for the next week, I had people from America do it.  And I painted them the exact same.  You know what the difference was?  The wetbacks worked way fucking harder.  Way harder.  They didn't bitch about anything.  I remember there was one room that they painted, and I was like, this color looks gay.  I need to repaint this.  We need to repaint it.  And the illegal immigrants were like, okay, no problem. 
[03:07:00]  Tomorrow we come, we paint, we fix it, and we do it again.  It's no problem.  Just like nothing.  And then I did the same thing with the American guys.  And I was like, guys, we're going to need to repaint this.  Oh, this is bullshit, man.  We already finished.  Fuck.  This is bullshit.  I can't fucking.  We already did it all.  We got to do it again.  And I was like, I'm giving you more work, you fuck.  But see, now the second you give the illegals legal status and everything else.  Is that what you think?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:07:30]  That's what we talked about.  See, this is what will happen.  Ah, I had not thought about that.  Everyone knows what the arrangement is.  If all of a sudden you let all of the people that are here now and give them all the benefits,  and now they're American citizens, they get all the insurance,  everything that's available to American citizens,  they then become American citizens.  Now, they're not going to do the shit job anymore because now they can go out and get good jobs.  I completely agree with that.  So then where are the shit jobs going to be done?  As long as they don't know English, dude, as long as they don't know English, 
[03:08:00]  they're going to keep doing those shit jobs.  You think?  Trust me.  Fuck yeah.  It's all in our DNA not to work hard.  Yeah.  See, here's the thing.  Do as well as you can doing as little work as possible.  A lot of dummies out there think that if the wages were different,  people wouldn't get the work done.  Like, a lot of people say, well, illegal immigrants will do people's yard work,  but if there was American prices, they would not get that work done.  Right.  But they would get the work done.  Yeah.  So there's a lot of douchebags that make that kind of point, 
[03:08:30]  but it's just never a valid one.  Can you believe this guy?  Aaron.  Is just yapping over Jimmy talking.  Aaron.  Yeah, he's talking about supporting like 10 of his fucking cousins already.  Aaron.  Aaron.  Hello.  You babbling ass.  What's up?  Hey, not much.  So I'm not too sure exactly what the point's going to be about illegal immigration.  Yeah, I know.  All right, dude.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from California, man.  All right, good.  Cool.  All right, so you're right there where it's happening. 
[03:09:00]  How is it affecting you?  Well, actually, I'm going to be up at the Boston Orpheum May 12th with Dave Attell doing a gig.  Yeah.  At the Orpheum.  Yeah, we're looking forward to getting up there and hitting Boston again.  I love Boston.  Nice.  It's a beautiful place.  Aaron.  Go to Ticketmaster.  Aaron.  It's Beantown.  I love Beantown.  Aaron, the show is yours.  Aaron, what are you waiting for?  Please.  Well, I just noticed that out here...  Hey, Eric, how are you feeling today?  You look like you're a little quiet, a little bummed out.  I know.  It's been quiet.  All right, cool.  You all right, dude?  Yeah.  Doing all right.  I got an orange.  Yeah.  Get some...  An orange just chippers you right up.  Aaron.  Just eat it then. 
[03:09:30]  Don't look at it.  Aaron, I'm impressed by his improv skills.  Me too.  You're terrific.  And he picked it up, too.  Whoa.  He was right there.  I want to see all scene.  Hello?  His eyes opened up like a frog.  Yeah.  Aaron, could you make your point?  We're on a time constraint here.  Okay, you bet, man.  Hey, I'm out here in California.  Northern California.  What part of California?  Northern California.  No, what town?  What city?  Northern California is a large area.  I'm in Eureka right now.  It's like a little north of Sacramento, actually about five hours north.  A little north.  Out here, we have a bunch of liberals. 
[03:10:00]  It's funny.  I've actually worked in Sacramento.  I kind of like...  You ever do the punchline out there?  It's a great club.  It's a great fun place on Hardin and Al.  Excellent club.  Right across the Mongolian beef.  It's a great place.  I love Sacramento.  Beef.  Good stuff.  All right.  Thanks for the call, Aaron.  All right.  Good job, man.  Good point.  Good point.  That was a great point.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island.  Mike.  All the liberals in Eureka.  Aaron stinks.  Yeah.  He wants to talk to me.  He wants to say there was a lot of white people.  What's that?  You kind of said my point.  I was going to ask if you knew that white people still know how to start their own warm  mowers.  It hasn't changed very much. 
[03:10:30]  But I want to ask, what do you feel about the Recon Key Store?  I don't know what that is.  I don't know what that is.  What does that mean?  Some of the Mexicans feel that since we beat them in a war and took California and part  of Arizona and Texas and all that.  That they're going to get it back?  Oh, I agree.  That makes sense.  It'll probably happen.  So I think we might as well just start moving out now.  That shit will never happen.  So I don't know.  Dude, that is never going to happen.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  And you know why?  Because blacks will get reparations before that happens.  And Mexico sucks. 
[03:11:00]  Like what these people, listen, what you got to understand is when these people say, you  know, this used to be ours and we wish it was back, they don't put into the equation  that if California and Texas hadn't become America, they wouldn't look that fucking nice.  No, it would be Mexico.  It would be Mexico.  You know what I mean?  That's the whole point.  Everybody thinks that these wetbacks, illegals, whatever, they want to come to this country  and turn this country into Mexico.  They don't. 
[03:11:30]  If they did, they'd have fucking stayed there.  The whole point is.  They'd think in the 1800s, the buildings were there.  Yeah, exactly.  All the infrastructure.  Yeah.  Everything that's there now is there when the malls and all that shit.  No, if that was Mexico, there wouldn't be a mall.  There'd be a fucker selling chiclets and a guy on a donkey saying, you want to see that  show?  That's what it would be.  And they know that.  Let us put it back to how it was.  And then we'll put it back to you.  We'll put it back the way it was and then give it to you.  That could be a lot of fun.  Yeah, exactly.  And it's yours.  That's what it is.  Look, the system that we have is great right now. 
[03:12:00]  It's hard to get in this country.  You know, we should make it harder.  That's the one thing that we should do.  Hey, we need to make the fence electric so that we start getting the good jumpers.  You know what I mean?  But what we have is cool because there's like a little obstacle course set up.  Yeah.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Like right now.  You make a great point, though.  They should make it even tougher.  So it's like a game show.  But that's what it is.  See, the problem is, OK, let's just say that we close the border down and we make immigration  legal.  We're still going to need a shitload of people.  All right. 
[03:12:30]  But how are we going to weed them out?  How are we going to know the good ones from the bad ones?  How are we going to know the ones that are hard workers from the ones that are not based  on a paper?  And, you know, we're not going to be able to put them through some training camp facility  to see how good they are because that's going to be racist.  But we already have that right now.  We got some swimming events, some jumping events, some running events, some distance  events.  Climbing, digging.  Exactly.  We've already got what we need to do is like, you know, put border patrol really strong in  certain parts of the border.  And then the parts that are hard to cross, then just kind of let it be and see who can 
[03:13:00]  make it.  You know what I mean?  The guy that makes it is good.  But yeah, let's not put water there because there's some assholes that put water.  Oh, they're going to starve.  Fuck that.  You know what?  We need illegal immigrants that are going to want to walk all the way to like New York  and Chicago.  We need those guys.  So if they need water in Arizona, fuck you.  Go back.  We don't need your ass.  It's kind of like, I don't know if you know this, it's the way it works in Miami with  the Cubans.  Yeah.  You know the law, right?  If they make the beach.  Right.  If they make it to the beach, you're in. 
[03:13:30]  If you get caught in the water, you get sent back.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  That's exact.  Because we want the good ones.  We want the one that fucking actually made it.  We don't want the pussy in the water.  Please, I need the help.  Fuck you, dude.  Go train, bitch.  The guy that's going to make the sprint at the end.  Exactly.  We want the ones that are like that Cuban chick in the Winter Olympics.  Michelle Rodriguez, is that her name?  She's from Miami, and she's a speed skater.  That's what we want.  We want somebody that's going to land in Miami, put on some skates, and skate in the fucking 
[03:14:00]  asphalt so she can bring some medals.  That's the kind of attitude we want.  Yeah.  So I don't know how legal immigration is going to fix this.  Yeah.  I don't see it happening the way they want it happening.  But we do need to tighten up the border.  Make the fence alive.  Make it a little harder.  Put more of an obstacle course.  Build a couple of mountains on the way.  Or funnel them through like it's a triathlon type of deal.  Amazing.  And see, once you get past the finish line, we just go.  Here's your papers.  You know what I mean?  You're in.  You made it.  Exactly.  And if you fall halfway through, you just get kicked back.  Go train, bitch.  We don't need you. 
[03:14:30]  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Yeah.  I'm out right now landscaping.  And all this has got a point there.  You know, there are Americans out there that want to work.  But they do nothing but bitch all the time, you know?  I mean, my crew's out here right now.  And we're laughing at listening to this, you know?  Shitty jobs suck.  People don't like doing them.  It's just the way it is.  So if you have certain people that want to do it, that are willing to do it, and for cheaper,  why wouldn't you want them to do it? 
[03:15:00]  They have no choice.  Yeah, but they do.  Because where they come from, they work way harder than this.  But it's an arrangement.  Yeah.  It's been in place for years.  We can't change it by saying, we all know it's happening.  We're not stupid.  Right.  But we can't then accept it.  It's like an under-the-table thing that's going on.  Right.  The government can't then just say, all right, you're all in legally.  Right.  It's like a bunch of mistresses saying, we want to move in with you and your wife.  We want it to be an honest thing.  Now, no one's going to go for that.  Look, I'll fuck you in the hotel.  I'll throw you a few bucks.  I'll take care of you. 
[03:15:30]  But you can't be legitimate.  Keep it on the QT.  It's got to be quiet.  It's got to be kept quiet.  It's one of those arrangements.  It's like waitresses with their tips and declaring them in their taxes.  Do you think the IRS thinks that this waitress lived on $8,000 in a year?  Or that perhaps she's getting cash tips and not?  It's known.  But you just leave it alone because that's the way it's been.  It's like when you're being blown by a black girl in a blonde wig and she goes, hi.  You pretend the voice isn't quite as deep as your mind. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  You both know the truth.  The blow job is good, so keep those panties on, you silly goose.  Yes.  Jennifer.  Daddy.  Great head.  Rob, anything else?  No, man.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Pete in New York.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Pete.  Hey, Carlos, man.  You really nailed the midiman the other day on your show.  When did I do that?  I don't know.  I've done so much shit on the show.  I don't remember which one it was.  When you did the Serrano's. 
[03:16:30]  That was a funny skit, man.  Oh, when I shot the minute man?  Yeah.  Because they were breaking and entering, dude.  It was illegal.  Well, I'm listening.  Minute men are retarded, though.  Minute men.  Minute men are retarded because they don't say what they want.  What they should say is, and I'd respect them for it.  You know what?  I don't want wetbacks coming in and putting signs in Spanish.  I get that.  I get that.  Well, it's not.  But don't say.  Hold on, bro.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, bro.  But don't say.  It's for security purposes. 
[03:17:00]  Because the security.  The 19 hijackers came through Canada.  There's no fucking security in Canada.  There's places in Canada where you can just walk across and come back.  And Canada's the country we need to worry about when it comes to terrorism.  Because those fuckers are so nice.  They'll let anybody in.  Ahmed will call them up and be like, we want to go visit your snow.  Oh, come over, fuckers.  Mexico ain't like that.  I don't know if you know.  Policy in Mexico, you can't come into our country if you're Middle Eastern.  Cannot go to Mexico.  Try to get a visa.  Wow.  Fuck no.  Because they know if one Middle Eastern dude crossed that border and blew something up in 
[03:17:30]  this country, the very next day, we would close that fucking border down.  Because they know that there's an arrangement.  And they have a part.  In the recent, like, seven months, in the past seven months, seven groups of illegal aliens  of Middle Eastern descent have actually tried to cross the Mexican border.  And they all got caught.  And you know how they got caught?  This is not a joke.  They all got caught because as soon as they crossed the border, the Mexican wetbacks went  up to immigration officials and pointed to the Middle Eastern people and went, they 
[03:18:00]  no speak Spanish.  I swear to God.  That's how they caught them.  So they know, dude.  Don't worry about security.  Hey, what about this new law?  Mexico wants to pass the drug law?  Right.  You hear about that?  No, no, no.  They want to legalize pot, heroin, all kinds of drugs in small quantities to have on your  possession.  Make it legal.  And they say that this is going to be better to fight the war on drugs because it won't 
[03:18:30]  be so much the casual user that they're busting all the time.  It's going to be the big dealers now, America, especially the San Diego mayor was just livid  because he now sees all of his kids, his teens from going to Mexico, going to Mexico.  Now it's easier to get your hands on some dope.  But that's going to solve the immigration problem because nobody's going to leave Mexico  after that law.  Yeah.  Don't stop the Americans from coming in.  Exactly.  They're going to reverse the flow of traffic. 
[03:19:00]  Like, holy shit, they keep coming.  What's the matter?  But it looks like this thing went through whatever they got down there as their Congress.  And then Fox is supposed to sign it into law.  Really?  And it really looks like you're going to be able to carry around more quantities.  So that's it.  They solve the immigration problem.  See, if I was the president of Mexico, I would just attack the United States.  That's what I would do.  Yeah, that's always been one of those things.  That would be the easiest thing to do.  Just attack the United States.  Have a fight.  They win.  We're yours.  Puerto Rico number two.  Let's go. 
[03:19:30]  Help us out.  Exactly.  Just attack with nothing, too.  Like with those old frigging big red furry hats.  With the hose and shit.  Yeah.  Like gardeners from back in the day.  Those old, like Santa Ana.  Yeah.  And his army in those uniforms.  With the muskets and the big hats.  Muskets.  Just attack the Alamo.  Just fucking.  We're at war with you.  Why?  We will attack you.  And they don't kill anybody.  They just keep running.  Surrender.  That's it.  And then we take over.  And we got that problem. 
[03:20:00]  Exactly.  Well, Mexico's actually a pretty rich country.  They got a lot of oil and stuff.  Then what the hell has been the problem?  They're so corrupt, dude.  They are so corrupt.  Their government is so corrupt.  Let me put it to you.  Why can't the Mexican people then take the energy?  You see the organization it took to get multi-city protests.  You want to know why?  Here's why.  Here's why.  Straight up.  This is why.  This is why Mexico sucks and Cuba sucks.  There's a real reason for that.  It takes only a certain amount of people actually have the balls and the fire and the wherewithal to actually fight shit and say, no, no, we're going to the streets. 
[03:20:30]  And all those Mexicans that would have changed Mexico are here.  They're here.  That's the problem.  But there is a way to unite them.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  If these people would have stayed over there, stay there.  Get millions of people in the streets to show your displeasure with corruption.  Yes.  And change the government there.  Yes.  There's resources.  I mean, there's an imaginary line that was decided where the United States starts and Mexico ends. 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  It's not so different that nothing grows here.  Yes.  You know, across this river is a lush fucking prairie.  It's paradise and green and grass.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's because it hasn't been worked.  Yeah.  But those Mexicans, all those illegal immigrants yesterday, dude, they did a better job of being Americans than any Americans I've ever seen in the last...  Using their right to peaceful protest.  Fucking long ago.  Peaceful protest.  Yeah.  Like, Jesus Christ.  These guys got together and rallied and did the shit. 
[03:21:30]  Organized.  And they protested and they organized.  I'm sitting here going, fuck, we need these Mexicans to teach our kids how to be fucking Americans.  Because we suck at it.  You know how many times black America has tried to do this boycott day?  Yeah.  The day of outrage.  They pulled off a million man march years ago.  Where like 300,000 showed up.  Yeah.  In one place.  Right.  In Washington.  And since then, there hasn't been this...  Look at them up.  Look at them up there.  Yeah, see?  They're everywhere.  Look at that street.  Everywhere in the country.  But since then, there hasn't been this cohesion that the blacks have been able to do what the Mexicans have been able to pull off a couple of times now. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  And each one is getting bigger and bigger.  And they made it bigger by calling it Immigrant Day.  I know.  I love this sign.  Immigrant.  How fucking badass is that, dude?  Immigrant, motherfucker.  How about Illegal Mexican Day?  How cool was that?  Like 99.9% of them are Mexicans.  And they went, eh, it's the Immigrant Day.  And all of a sudden, I see Chinese people.  You know, my people came from China. 
[03:22:30]  Holy shit.  Get the fuck out of here, Chad.  Julio.  Julio's a genius.  Come in.  Come in the party.  It's everybody.  It's everybody.  It was awesome.  Immigration Day.  Fucking Immigrant Day.  It was genius.  I saw a sign that said, immigrants, give immigrants rights.  Immigrants need equal pay.  Immigrants need health care.  And it's like, well, they get that.  They get all that.  If you're an immigrant, could you paint the illegal part?  Over immigrant, please.  You forgot a word on your sign.  You forgot a very important word, bro. 
[03:23:00]  Illegal.  Yeah, you forgot.  No visa.  You forgot that part right there.  Holy shit.  I saw so many of those signs.  Let's go to St. Louis.  Oh, man.  Let's go to St. Louis.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey, Jim.  Ah, I'm a first-time caller.  Don't be nervous, Jim.  You're doing fine.  Great.  This won't take the energy out of the program that we just developed for the last half hour.  What's that?  Go ahead, Jim.  Go ahead, buddy.  Go, Jim.  Go.  Yeah, I wanted to tell you, a friend of mine lives in Chicago, and he's got this big-ass 
[03:23:30]  boat, and we took it up to Canada and spent some time in Canada and come back, and neither  border checked us anywhere.  You know, them fuckers are just coming down through Lake Michigan all they want.  All they got to do is go to Canada and rent a boat and come across the border.  But Canada is just filled with a bunch of dummies.  They could get to America, no problem, and they don't go for it.  You know, Jim, the next time you're on a boat between here and Canada, I want you to have  the same output as the... 
[03:24:00]  You ever hear the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald?  I hope you fucking drown in Lake Gitchy Goonie, you flow stopper.  And there's no song about it.  Yeah, exactly.  Never write a song about you.  Two douchebags from Chicago and somewhere else.  They hopped on a raft and they drowned, and that's the end of the song, because no one  gives a shit about these two.  And then other people died because...  He gave us a hearsay story, dude.  It was hearsay.  It wasn't even first person, bro.  I know these two guys up in Canada.  Yeah, these two guys.  My friend.  Yeah, a friend of mine. 
[03:24:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break here?  We got to get your opinions on the Hispanic version of the national anthem when we get  back.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, that's another good one.  Wow.  A lot of people outraged about that.  It's Carlos Mencia.  Are we promoting anything today, Carlos?  Just Michelle.  Mind the Mencia on Comedy Central.  Mind the Mencia on Comedy Central.  That's about it.  Doing very, very well.  Well enough that you can take care of 17 family members.  It's horrible, dude.  It really is bad.  It's bad. 
[03:25:00]  I mean, it's bad because of the stuff that I got to pay for.  They're probably studying the ratings themselves.  You know what the funny part is, is that they all tell me, you need to take time off.  I don't mind paying because I have enough money, thank God.  But what pisses me off is they're like, you know, you need to take time off.  Take some time.  You need to really take some time to relax and spend it with your family.  Yeah.  Can I have 10 grand?  Well, how the fuck am I supposed to take time off when you're bleeding me like a fucking  vampire? 
[03:25:30]  I swear to God.  But I love them to death.  I love them to death.  Another gift has arrived.  We got the box of chocolates from Dr. Steve.  Yeah, that's old news.  Where's the other gift?  Well, Ralphie Mays sent something.  Oh, nice.  Ralphie Mays sent something.  Ooh.  Ben's bringing it in right now.  Is it one of his old shirts that we can all wear?  Holy crap.  That we can all fit in?  Yeah.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  It looks like equipment of some kind. 
[03:26:00]  Steaks?  Ralphie said that steaks.  Oh, wow.  These are no good.  They're fucking cold.  All right, guys.  Guys, we got four filet mignons.  All I see is sausages.  We got a couple boneless strip steaks, a couple boning strip steak.  We got four veal porterhouse chops.  Yeah, mate.  We got, what's andouille?  What is that?  Chicken supremo Italian sausage. 
[03:26:30]  Andouille?  Is that andouille sausage?  Oh, my God.  That's a French sausage.  All right, knockwurst.  Rum.  And kielbasa.  Goddamn it, that was good.  Very good.  A biscotti.  Thank you, Ralphie Maeve.  Thanks, Ralph.  Is it cold enough we can bring these home?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are they frozen?  A little bit.  That's how they ship them.  A little bit.  A little bit?  They're a little bit frozen.  They have dry ice in there.  Yeah.  I can't cook.  Dude.  You put it in the oven.  I'll take a couple steaks.  No problem.  Someone can make mine and give it to me?  Go to some little store. 
[03:27:00]  Get yourself any kind of marinade.  Let it sit there for a while, and then throw it in the oven at about $3.75.  Let's do a little broil action.  How about this?  No.  I'll just go to Morton and pay, because I can't cook.  Yeah, but that's a nice, fresh steak.  Or you can hire a wetback for like $10, and they'll cook it for you.  Absolutely.  Think about that.  Dude, there's some fuel.  And you'll probably cut your grass in the meantime, if you've got a lawn.  We've got meetings today.  I'm going to just throw a few in my backpack and walk home with a steak in the back. 
[03:27:30]  Steaks in your backpack.  I'll be really sick by Friday.  More with Carlos Menci in just a bit.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:28:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Progress on XM Satellite Radio.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  God damn.  Good stuff.  You like the Godiva?  Yeah.  Dr. Steve is the best.  He rules.  I'm taking the steaks home.  I must get this away from you, though.  I just want the coffee now.  What coffee?  Godiva coffee.  They have coffee now?  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Are you going to make it at home?  Sure.  One day I can make it.  Carlos Menci in studio.  Mind of Mencia on Comedy Central.  Check it out.  That means you don't tour as much, right?  Yeah.  Not a lot.  Not a lot.  Keep you busy.  Yeah.  But I was up in University of Niagara.  Ah, that's right.  That's right at the border there, yeah.  Yeah.  So we were up there.  Went into Canada.  Niagara Falls.  Yeah, they actually have, like, border patrol there.  It was hilarious.  It was the funniest shit I've ever seen. 
[03:29:00]  They actually had, like, these border patrol boats going up and down the river.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Making sure that the Canadians didn't come over.  Like, what are they going to do?  They're known for, you know, crossing the river.  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  Play hockey over here?  Yeah.  Like, what?  Cheaper than other people.  Stupidest shit ever.  Awful.  We're on in Canada, too.  We haven't heard from the Canadians in a while on this show.  XM Canada is doing pretty well so far.  They're just sitting back enjoying.  They're just hoping that the Mexicans don't figure out there's another country. 
[03:29:30]  And a little further north, right?  It's too cold for the Mexicans out there, man.  Before we get out of here, let's talk to some Canadians.  Give the show a call.  We're going to build a tunnel, like, from Mexico, and then, like, have the United States this  way, and then just build it all the way through to Canada.  This thing is a long trip.  Comes up, welcome to the United States.  Yeah.  Fucking 10 feet from Canada.  They just think it's been a long trip.  They won't even, they won't know, anyway.  I mean, what's the difference between Canada and here to most people?  A long trip.  A military.  Exactly. 
[03:30:00]  Might have to chloroform them and take them by train, and then just drop them off in Canada.  Welcome to the United States.  I don't know.  So what do you think of the Spanish National Anthem?  That's fucking retarded.  It's amazing.  That's not cool.  It's called, Oh, Say What?  Oh, but you want to hear something funny?  We were, like, a couple months ago, we were at a game, and my cousin stood up to seeing  the National Anthem, and I swear to God, the first words out of his mouth were, 
[03:30:30]  Jose, can you see?  Jose.  And I looked at him, and I laughed, and then he gave me that look of, like, what the fuck  are you laughing at?  And then I went, are you kidding me?  And he really thought...  Thinks it's Jose.  He really thought that it was Jose.  Can you see?  But the donger, I swear to God, I was like, how the fuck would Jose be in the National Anthem  that was created, like, 150 years ago? 
[03:31:00]  Are you still...  Or whenever it was.  What is Nuestro Hymno?  Our Anthem.  Where is it?  Our Anthem.  You got the Spanish one?  Yeah.  See, I'll translate it for you.  No, we got it in English.  In English.  Can I say that I think 85 to 90% of all resentment over immigration is a language issue?  Yeah.  No one ever minds...  I never care about seeing Spanish people.  I don't care about seeing Chinese people.  If people speak English or make an honest attempt, I never mind seeing immigrants.  And where did that start?  I'm still...  I ask that question a lot. 
[03:31:30]  Where did that start?  Because years ago, Italians, Irish, a lot of people immigrated here, and eventually they  did learn the language.  I mean, it became a part of their upbringing where they would talk to each other.  Like, I see Asians sometimes talking to each other in English in the elevator.  Right.  And people that you can tell with accents, and you see, you know, that they speak Chinese  or whatever.  It's fucking different.  So all you ask is that you attempt the language, man.  Stop trying to make two...  That's the cultural assimilation that people want.  Here's the difference.  The problem is, is that they've been coming in, and it's never stopped.  See, like, with Italians, it was like one giant rush. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  And that was it.  So then once they assimilated, it was cool.  With Mexicans, it's different.  Because, as an example, my parents came here in the 60s, but they speak Spanish and English  now.  But since every year, there's, you know, a couple hundred new thousand, whatever, it  never ends.  That's the problem.  The never-ending flow.  The never-ending flow.  It's like you move out.  Like, I moved out of the ghetto.  But then when I go back, it's exactly the same as it was because I got replaced by some 
[03:32:30]  dude who can't speak English.  So it just, it was, because when I was a kid, we lived in East LA, and next to East LA is  a place called Monterey Park, where it's like everybody's Chinese, everybody.  So when we were in our side of the neighborhood, I would tell my dad, you know, this is why  I would tell my dad, this is why white people get pissed at us, because all these fucking  signs are in Spanish.  And my dad would say, well, you know, it's the way it is.  That's why we talk.  It's no big deal.  But then we would go next door, where all the signs were in Chinese, and then my dad would 
[03:33:00]  be like, this is fucking bullshit.  Why don't they put them in fucking English so we understand what the fuck it says?  I was like, exactly, dick.  That's how people feel in our neighborhood.  Because you don't realize, you don't realize when you speak another language, you don't realize  how weird it is until people start doing it to you.  Yeah.  So, you know, like one of the guys out there just started speaking to me in Spanish, and  I just responded.  But I'm really aware now of it because... 
[03:33:30]  That had to be Master Paul.  Yeah.  And when I got in and out...  What did he say in Spanish?  He said, do you still speak Spanish, or are you one of those that forgot?  That's what he said to me in Spanish.  Wow.  Look at that.  Like, am I keeping it real?  A little pride going on there.  Yeah, a little beaner pride over there.  So, but it's weird when other people do it to you.  And I didn't realize this until recently, because I was getting in an elevator, and these  two Middle Eastern guys said, hey, how are you doing?  And they even recognized me.  They're like, you're the guy with the show, and oh, you're funny. 
[03:34:00]  And I was like, cool.  And as soon as the doors closed, they started doing that.  I was like, whoa, what the fuck, dude?  What the fuck?  No kidding.  Are you starting to blow shit up?  What the fuck?  Are you planning, dude?  Always planning.  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  I was like...  Two Arabs start yapping to each other.  It is always...  It sounds like a plan.  Yeah, the language just sounds like they're planning something all the time.  They could be talking about how nice the weather is, but...  It doesn't matter.  It just sounds like they're planning something.  Yeah, and I was like, so like, dude, what the fuck?  And they were like, I was telling him about your show. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  No, fuck that.  You're blowing up my show.  I heard 16th floor.  Yeah.  I heard some shit.  Wait, who lied?  Oh, E-Rock's got a little communique.  Right.  Poe is saying that Carlos lied.  Oh.  Bring Poe in here.  Master Poe.  Or whoever the guy was.  Master Poe.  Was it Master Poe?  Yeah, it's his car.  Master Poe.  No, it wasn't Master Poe.  It wasn't Master Poe.  It was the guy sitting right here.  Ah, they all look alike.  Who is that?  It wasn't you, bro.  It was the other guy right there. 
[03:35:00]  It didn't sound like Poe or you one who forgot.  A short-haired with a white t-shirt.  Oh, Mars.  Oh.  Mars?  That sounds like Mars.  He says creepy things.  Yeah, he's the one that said it.  All right, Mars.  So Mars is being uppity.  Mars.  I like that Poe came in like he's going to kick my ass.  It's like, whoa, hey.  That's what he does for a living.  Mars is a problem, too, though.  He's one of Poe's students.  You know how well you tell jokes?  Well, he's that good at kicking ass?  Yeah, exactly.  I love you, Poe.  He's the punisher, and it's for a different. 
[03:35:30]  It's for real.  It's for the real reason.  It's for real.  It's frightening.  It's not some comedy shit?  No.  Uh-uh.  No, he's.  What is Master Poe's nickname?  I don't even want to know.  I know Master Poe is a nickname in itself.  I don't know, but I bet you his buddies call him something.  El Killer.  So you want to.  We haven't even done this yet.  The actual translation of Nuestro Hymno.  All right.  The day is breaking.  Do you see it?  Translated in the light of dawn.  Translated, that means there's no border patrol. 
[03:36:00]  Now is the time to go.  I'm going to translate for you what it really means.  All right.  So you know what?  I'll do the actual line for the song, and you translate for us.  Okay, okay.  Let's do that.  So verse one.  This is actually the national anthem, the Spanish version.  It translates this way.  The day is breaking.  Do you see it?  In the light of the dawn.  Do not cross the border in the light time.  Uh-huh.  What we so acclaimed at nightfall.  We will do it at night. 
[03:36:30]  It stars.  It stripes flew yesterday.  We're going to change the flag soon.  Oh, Jesus.  In the fierce battle in a sign of victory.  We will claim victory soon.  The glow of battle in step with liberty.  At night, they said, it's being defended.  That's exactly what it means, bro.  They say it's being defended, but they're slipping in.  But it's not.  That's my point.  They're coming in.  And then, oh, say, the voice of your starry beauty is still unfolding over the land of 
[03:37:00]  the free, the sacred flag.  This song stinks, Jose.  So that's the Jose part?  Yeah.  Jose.  Jose.  Follow the stars at night.  The voice of your starry beauty is still unfolding over.  I don't think it goes to the same tune, does it?  No, no.  This fucking song is ridiculous.  See, see.  There's a lot of arribas in this song.  The voice of your starry beauty is still unfolding. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, but that means follow the stars.  So the country will not be good.  Follow the stars.  Is that what it means?  It's what it's saying.  See, you're...  Follow the stars as a navigation.  I'm seeing it as the flag.  Your voice, the voice of your starry beauty is still unfolding, which means the country  won't be beautiful.  It's still unfolding until all the Mexicans are here.  No, they want to keep it beautiful.  They don't want to change it.  Trust me.  All the Mexicans being over here are kind of... 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Shoddy it up a bit.  I think what they want to do is switch places, basically.  They want America to go to Mexico and fix it up.  Ah, yeah.  And then they want to come here and enjoy all the niceness.  And then in all 50 years, yeah, we want our country back.  And then just flip-flop.  Isn't Mexico great?  That anthem stinks.  It's not good.  The Westro hymno is a fucking bomb as far as I'm concerned.  There's still verse two.  Oh, I spoke too quickly.  I call no hymno. 
[03:38:30]  No hymno.  No hymno.  I go back to the no homo.  The no homo.  That was funny, dude.  I don't know.  It's funny.  There's something weird going on behind the scenes here.  All right, verse two.  Where's that chubby queer?  Is he in today?  You want to play no homo with one of our guys?  What?  And I just say no homo?  Sure.  No, he does.  You want to play no homo?  Seriously.  This guy is twisted.  Where is he?  Is Bobby here today?  No, Bobby.  You're so lucky.  No, he's not here.  He does very gay things to other men, and then he just calls no homo, and it's okay. 
[03:39:00]  Whatever.  He grabs guys' crotches, lightly.  He scoops up where you would wipe your ass.  He sounds like Bobby Lee.  That's what Bobby Lee does all the time.  And does he say no homo?  He doesn't say no homo, but I'm going to give it to him.  But he just says, I'm not gay.  Does he kiss you on the shoulder?  He tries to kiss you on the lips, dude.  Does Bobby have that little naughty playfulness?  I didn't know he did that.  Yeah.  All right.  He'll, like, whip it out.  Verse two.  He's Asian.  That's ballsy.  Yeah.  No, Bobby could not be packing more than fucking five hard, and it's got to be thin. 
[03:39:30]  It's just my guess.  No, it's about five hard, but pretty thick.  Bobby's got good girth?  Yeah, good girth.  Cool.  Verse two.  Verse two.  It's stars, it's stripes, freedom, we are equal, we are brothers in our anthem.  You cannot kick us out.  In the fierce combat, in a sign of victory, the glow of battle, in step with liberty, my  people keep fighting, it's time to break the chains, at night they said, it's being defended. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, brother.  Oh, say.  Don't sound good.  Your starry beauty is still unfolding.  The glow of battle, in step with liberty, that's the fight of us stepping into America.  My people keep fighting, we will keep crossing, it's time to break the chains.  It's time to cross the border.  At night, they said, it's being defended.  They said that at night, they were going to stop us.  Oh, say.  Well, you know what, this is going to start. 
[03:40:30]  There's going to be an Asian national anthem now, and, well, maybe not.  Exactly.  Not a Polish one, but.  Your starry flag, we're still folding.  The Polish one?  No, the Asian, because they all do laundry.  It's a laundry joke, Marles.  Come on.  I'm sorry, because I thought he was saying the poles are still folding, and it's because  they haven't been able to get it right.  That was a pull-out joke, dude.  Either way, it works.  I enjoyed it. 
[03:41:00]  All right, let's go to Toronto and say hi to Bob listening to us on XM Canada.  Bob.  Hey, thanks for spreading the virus to Canada, boys.  We appreciate it up here.  Canadian redneck.  This is great.  That's awesome.  Hey, since we got all these towel heads up here, and there's free trade now, how about  we trade our towel heads for your Mexicans, and we'll teach them how to shovel snow, and  once a year, we'll let them go out and pick the frustration zone club seals to death. 
[03:41:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Can you tell that joke over, dude, because your phone crapped out?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Your phone crapped out, dude.  All right.  Hey, I was saying, we'll trade your towel heads there for your Mexicans.  All right, Bob.  You're good enough.  Bob.  You're good enough for the air.  Hold on.  We're going to go to you next.  All right.  Let's check in with Canada, XM Canada.  It's Bob in Toronto.  Bob, what's going on?  Bob, you're on with the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, boys, what's up?  How are you doing?  Thanks for spreading the virus to Canada. 
[03:42:00]  You know how it is.  Hey, I got a deal for you.  Oh, wait.  We're not back.  We're not back yet?  Shit.  Hold on.  Hold on, Bob.  We thought we had one more promo left.  Keep that energy, though.  Keep the energy.  Yeah, the energy is good.  The energy is great.  Keep it up.  As a matter of fact, go put him back on hold so when we pick him up, he just sounds like  he's natural.  We're sorry about that, Bob.  Hold on.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The phones have exploded.  Let's go to XM Canada.  We asked for Canadians to call the show, right? 
[03:42:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Bob in Toronto.  Bob, you're on the Opie and Anthony program.  Bob, what's up, man?  What's up, Bob?  Hey, not a lot.  Colin from Toronto.  Thanks for spreading the virus, sir.  Yaddy, yaddy, yaddy.  We'll trade you the towel heads for the Mexicans so we can teach them how to shovel stone.  Bob, hello?  Hello?  Check.  Hello, Bob?  Check.  Are you on a cell phone?  Oh, believe it or not.  Yeah, we have those in Canada, boy. 
[03:43:00]  You're on a cell phone?  It's a real invention.  You were breaking up a little bit.  Let me check the line.  Hold on.  Ah, Harry.  I know.  I'm sorry, Bob.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to come back on to the show.  Two seconds.  And, Bob, when we go to you, can you just say, I'm Bob from Toronto and no homo?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Carl Smith, C. in the studio, doing a great job for us. 
[03:43:30]  You guys are dicks.  Don't forget to check out Mind and Mencia on Comedy Central.  We asked before the break to talk to some Canadians.  We're going to hear from Canadians.  We're on the XM up there, XM Canada.  Lots of guys from Canada checking in.  Let's say hi to Bob in Toronto.  Bob, you're on the Opie and Anthony program.  What's up, Bob?  I am Bob from Toronto, and I ain't no fucking homo.  Yeah, Bob.  No homo. 
[03:44:00]  No homo.  So what do you got for us, Bob?  Hello?  That fucking...  Oh, you dumb canuck.  Bob is an ass.  That awful joke.  He had energy, though, dude.  Yeah.  He came firing off like a pro.  Hey, hey, it's Bob.  Hey, it's Bob.  I'm here in Toronto.  I'm here.  Change your cow heads for the men.  Teach them how to shovel, Sny.  No, no.  Hey.  Wow.  He should be singing The Streak or Ahab the Arab with that fucking stupid voice. 
[03:44:30]  Bob, I hope you're dead by tomorrow.  Joe in Chicago.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  I just want to let you know in Chicago, you know, it's always been a Polish city, but  the Polish immigrants in the last 10 years is unbelievable.  There'll be a Polish national anthem here.  Everywhere you look, there's Polish flags.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, huge influx.  So that's next, too.  So don't make fun of that.  All right.  We better not.  Yeah.  Let's not do any Paul jokes. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  God forbid we make fun of our group.  God forbid.  I tried to ask him a question.  He just fucking barreled through.  I know.  Eric in New York.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, listen.  30 years ago, I immigrated from the great land of Russia.  Yes.  And I grew up in Washington Heights, you know, predominantly 85% Spanish.  There's no effort for them to speak English.  Right.  They just don't want to do it.  Do you think because all the signs are...  Do you go to...  It's because they don't have to. 
[03:45:30]  Right.  The signs are Spanish.  That's what I was saying about...  The radio's in Spanish.  Everything's in Spanish.  You don't have to.  Listen, you turn on the radio.  Hola, Megatron.  Para ti, los Latinos.  You know, you turn on the television.  Univision.  El gordo, la flaca.  You know what I mean?  You go to work.  Yeah.  Hola, como esta?  Yeah.  HBO Latino.  Para ti.  It's like, of course they don't want to learn the language.  Right.  Did I lose him?  Eric?  No, he's right there.  Eric.  I think I...  Eric.  Yeah, I lost him.  Okay. 
[03:46:00]  They don't have to.  That's what...  But that's part of the genius.  Yeah.  Hello?  Of what's going on.  Hello?  Hello?  Uh, hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah?  Simon.  What's up?  Yes, I'm here.  Okay.  What's going on?  What's up?  No, I'm not.  Who's this?  Is this O&A?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  You guys can hardly hear you.  That's all.  I don't know what happened to you. 
[03:46:30]  You're like crapping out on me or something.  I'm from Canada, man.  We got problems with our French people over in Quebec.  You know, they got their signs are all in French.  They want everybody else to have English and French signs everywhere else,  but they don't want to put English on their signs.  You know, it'll be the same thing if it goes through in the States.  I don't know what happened to you.  You're like crapping out on me or something.  I'm from Canada, man.  We got problems with our French people over in Quebec.  You know, they got their signs are all in French. 
[03:47:00]  They want everybody else to have English and French signs everywhere else,  but they don't want to put English on their signs.  You know, it'll be the same thing if it goes through in the States.  I don't know what happened to you or something.  I don't know what happened to you or something.  I'm from Canada, man.  We got problems with our French people over in Quebec.  They got their signs are all in French.  They want everybody else to have English and French.  You guys are cock suckers.  That would have been a never-ending loop. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, the mirror looking into the mirror.  Yeah, into the mirror, into the mirror.  Is it still gone now?  Right here.  You guys are still there, you fucking old ones.  You guys are brittle, man.  I can't go fuck off.  All right, Simon.  Later, man. 
[03:48:00]  Thank you, sir.  Remember what you were saying earlier that when they become Americans,  they're not going to want to do those jobs?  Yeah.  That's the beauty of the system that we have.  We keep them illiterate so that they can always do those jobs.  That's the beauty of it because we have Spanish radio, Spanish TV, Spanish sign,  so they never have to learn English, which ensures that they'll never work at Merrill Lynch.  We made it easy for you not to have to learn English. 
[03:48:30]  Right, but it's so that they can keep doing those jobs because if they learn English,  if hardworking people learn English.  Oh, you mean that's a strategy on our part.  Think about it.  Wow, I never thought of it that way.  Get a hardworking guy.  Give him a guy that you know is really hardworking.  Give him a little bit of an education and some English.  That dude isn't going to be fucking cleaning houses very long,  but keep that dude speaking Spanish.  Yeah, but it does come from also like a lot of parents and stuff don't like kind of  drill it into your head that you have to speak English.  I mean, there is a part of it too where it's cultural and it's family where it's not drilled into you. 
[03:49:00]  Look, you should learn the language.  I don't understand being a parent that speaks another language and you have kids in America  and you don't push them to learn English.  That I don't get on any level.  And radio stations and TV stations go to Spanish because monetarily,  they know they're going to get them.  That's why Spanish stations are number one in every major city because there's like one of them or two.  So they know it's a smart move.  Yeah.  That's what they do.  It's a smart move.  It's smart, dude.  Keeping them down.  The next guys are always smart.  Keep them uneducated.  All right, we're going to take one more break.  And when we get back,  we've got to talk about Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco before we get out of here. 
[03:49:30]  What happened with them, Ope?  Uh-oh.  Are they back?  Heard they had a problem.  At some point.  Couldn't be helped.  Yeah, we are getting a request for this.  I don't know.  Should we play this today?  Wayne in Carolina.  Wayne?  Hey, guys.  Just wanted to see if maybe you could play the Bill's Day in honor of the immigration game for Carlos there.  Do we have the whole thing where it's, you know, in English and then Spanish?  Well, we have the Spanish. 
[03:50:00]  We have the Spanish.  It won't make sense unless we, you know, do the English first.  Yeah.  That was code for Eric.  Get it.  Derek might have it, actually.  He's looking.  Derek.  Hawk is good.  He's always got it.  Derek, you got it?  Derek, you got it.  Yeah, Derek's got it.  Well, so did our own little Eric.  It's a virus promo?  All right, that'll work.  Basically, we found out that these radio stations that are speaking two languages are doing so well.  So, Ant and I decided to do some of our bits in Spanish.  In Spanish, too?  Yeah, just to get some more Spanish listeners. 
[03:50:30]  Sure.  So, we hacked it up here.  Check this out.  Like sun is through the hourglass, so is the only name virus.  So, Anthony and I came up with a cute little idea, a quick idea, that maybe we should translate  some of our better bits into Spanish for the...  Maybe we'll get some Spanish listeners that way.  ...for the Spanish-speaking audience.  Imagine they're just tuning around the dial XM, and they hear all of a sudden some Spanish  coming out. 
[03:51:00]  And go, oh, what's this?  I think XM is launching a Spanish station or a couple of them or something like that.  So, maybe we could, you know, give this bit to the Spanish station on XM.  And they could play it a few times.  So, the only way this is going to make sense is to play the Bill's Dead phone call again.  I know it's kind of overplayed, but it is one of our favorites.  Yeah.  Basically, this old lady called one of the old stations we worked at.  Wrong number.  Wrong number, and we messed with her a little bit by telling her her dear friend Bill was  dead.  A little bit.  So, we're going to play the original, and then we'll come back for a quick second, and 
[03:51:30]  we'll play the Spanish version.  All right.  All right.  But first, here's the original.  Royal Caribbean Cruise Line.  Hey, Ann, could you move that one thing?  I want to see if that fucking elephant signs off.  Good.  I think she might still be there.  She's not there.  Why the anger, Jimmy? 
[03:52:00]  I'm not angry.  I'm just concerned.  Fat girls want to be seen, too.  Exactly.  It should be seen in happy slapping videos.  What's the happy slapping videos all about?  Does Steve know what's going on with this phenomenon?  I'm sure he does.  I'm sure he knows the guy who produced them.  CNN did a whole piece.  What are they?  Websites?  Well, I don't know.  It seems to be something that's happening in London, where they're walking up, and it  sounds funny, slap, or happy slapping, where they've been videotaping people on camera  phones and stuff, or walking up and slapping other people in the face. 
[03:52:30]  But it's more than just slapping.  This is friggin' haul off and bash someone with a closed fist slapping.  One guy got kicked in the face.  Happy cold cock.  Yeah.  He got knocked out, and then he's on the ground, and he gets kicked in the face.  And they seem to be doing it with their camera phones and stuff in England.  Cholly good.  I'm waiting.  I asked E-Rock for aspirin, and he just handed me aspirin.  They need a hobby over there.  No water or anything?  No, that's what I'm getting at.  Why would you need water?  Do it like they do in the movies.  They chew it. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  Never see when they got it like the guy.  Oh, yeah.  It's a big handful, and he chews it.  Thank you, E-Rock.  You yelled at E-Rock for no reason.  I didn't yell.  He was coming in with water.  Eric, are you sad?  Are you okay, Eric?  Well, you scalded.  Hold on a minute.  Did you forget the water?  Be honest.  No, I thought you already had it.  I just went and got your aspirin.  Hey, an attitude.  You hear that tone of voice?  Where would the water be that you thought I had?  I thought you had it.  What, do you think I'm a camel?  No. 
[03:53:30]  He's stored in his hump.  How could you think that I had water?  All you would have to do is look around the area and see there's no water to be had.  Hey, fuck you, Tommy.  Jimmy, I think it's time for a, uh, what do you think?  I don't like the fact that Eric's being hollered at, and I think that while everyone likes  to berate you, I think you need a tender sentiment.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  One of E-Rock's tender sentiments.  A little different than Jimmy's.  I know.  They're all meant to make you feel good.  I want to hear one of Jimmy's first. 
[03:54:00]  Jimmy, let me hear one of yours.  Well, I'm not sad, but.  Well, if you are.  We have to introduce the bit again.  All right.  We've got to reintroduce bits.  The Breathe Right strip looks stupid on you.  I didn't mean that.  It was like when Kirk said, um, shut up.  I'm sick of your half-breed interference to Spock.  It was to, you know, get to the end of the bit.  What does it say?  You have something to contribute. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, see?  That's a nice tender sentiment.  That's sweet, dude.  That's kind.  That makes him feel better, and well, it should.  E-Rock.  You need a hug?  E-Rock.  What?  Maybe E-Rock now, since Opie, you maybe yelled at him a little.  What?  Opie said hepatitis C.  Well, something to contribute.  I thought that would be funny.  That was mean.  Uh-oh.  Tender sentiment.  I thought you interrupted because I bombed.  I'm like, phew.  Right? 
[03:55:00]  This one says.  You deeply and completely love and accept yourself.  Oh, man.  That's nice.  Of course, because who else is going to love you?  He's going to run out of tender sentiments if you keep mocking his tender sentiments.  Yeah, don't mock it.  I think he's okay.  I'm fine.  Are you sure?  Are you shaking him up there?  There it is.  You enjoy your own company. 
[03:55:30]  What?  You enjoy your own company.  I don't even know you, but you have to, right?  You don't have friends?  Is that what I heard?  Oh, what?  He's trying to enjoy a tender sentiment.  I'm sorry.  Only loners enjoy their own company.  That's what I was thinking myself.  Uh-oh.  Is he reaching for the box? 
[03:56:00]  That's his own tender sentiment.  He just blasted out of his ass.  That's his protection.  It's like a skunk.  What does it say?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  You're not sharing?  Nope.  You're not sharing?  No.  He's just going to enjoy it himself.  Come on.  I'll tell it later.  See?  Wow.  He learns.  He adapts.  He stinks.  What does it say?  He opens it up.  What does it say?  How they do, too?  What?  Farts smell like hot garbage. 
[03:56:30]  What is the last tender sentiment?  It's not important.  I'm not going to say.  I haven't.  He's saving it and feeling good about it.  Not letting you ruin it.  Well, he's really letting that one sink in.  Yeah.  Well, it's real.  It makes him feel better.  It's for sure it does.  Well, E-Rock got yelled at.  All right.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's a tender sentiment for E-Rock.  Separate box, of course.  It's just his.  Everyone has to have their own.  There's only like two left.  Shake.  Awful.  Shake.  All right.  Here's E-Rock's tender sentiment. 
[03:57:00]  People equate meeting you with finding prostate cancer in their Christmas stocking.  Wow.  There is a difference.  A large difference in tender sentiment.  And it's between Jimmy and you.  Whatever makes you feel good.  Is that what makes you feel good, dude?  Jesus Christ.  What kind of fucking human being are you?  Oh.  That's a great one, man.  Did they sneak that one in there? 
[03:57:30]  Or did you write it yourself?  Yeah.  It's different tender sentiments.  Wow.  Other people that write those tender sentiments feel differently about E-Rock than E-Rock.  All right.  Let's do the Amy Fisher, Joey Butterfickup thing.  Let's hear some Amy.  Wow.  And then we'll get out of here.  Carlsman, see you.  Hang with us today.  Doing a great job.  So Amy Fisher and Joey Butterfickup, it's, I guess, some kind of anniversary.  How many years?  20?  15?  15 years were they up to?  15.  15 years ago, good old Amy Fisher walked up to Joey Butterfickup's house and shot Mary  Joe in the face. 
[03:58:00]  Shot her in the face.  There was, uh, she was, uh, she was, uh, having some relationship with Joey, a little jealous  teen, and, uh, figured she'd get the wife out of the way and then she'd have Joey all  to herself.  We should have had a Canadian explain the story.  Eh?  You think the Canadians know this story as well as we do?  Yeah, this was worldwide.  It was worldwide, but especially in New York, it was unbelievable.  The Long Island Lolita, they called her.  Oh, wow.  I remember that.  That's right.  The Long Island Lolita.  She was having sex with Joey, underage, underage sex. 
[03:58:30]  She was a, uh, call girl.  She had a beeper.  Was she a call girl?  Yeah.  Oh, that turns me on.  How old was she?  Like 17?  16.  She was 16.  16-year-old call girl.  Remember when she was arrested?  She had the little shorts on.  Yeah.  And the little shirt, and she was handcuffed and pulled her hair all in front of her face  and walked out her head down.  She looked so hot that even though she shot somebody, part of you was like, come on.  You can't blame her for that, right?  She's a kid.  Now she's saying she was on ecstasy or something when she shot Mary Jo. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, yeah?  They didn't even have ecstasy back then.  I'll give you a right.  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck kind of bullshit?  They didn't even have ecstasy back then.  What a bad liar.  She blamed me a right for it.  No shit, dude.  Yeah, right?  What a fucking idiot.  9-11 stress.  What?  I was on ecstasy.  That was invented 10 years ago.  Well, it was different back then.  Yeah.  Come on.  And I met Barnafuco.  And he went to jail for sex with a minor.  Statutory rape.  Yeah.  His hands. 
[03:59:30]  You know what I mean, Barnafuco?  You had to the comedy store?  Yeah, yeah.  He goes to the comedy store all the time.  His thumbs are like my legs.  His cock must be like that fucking basket full of gifts.  Like this microphone.  Like this microphone.  One of those big Italian fat tuna cans.  Fucking Amy Fisher probably smuggled the gun in her pussy after Joey got fucking done  wrecking it.  I don't know.  That would be a bore.  I had higher hopes for that one.  You had higher hopes for that one?  Yeah, that was a big pussy joke.  It was a good setup, though.  It was a good setup.  We would have laughed if you shared your tender sentiment with everybody.  Well, then I guess I'll sacrifice the laugh. 
[04:00:00]  Wow.  Wow.  That important to you.  That's real.  He's not budging, man.  He's not.  Wow.  It must have said something really fucking nice.  Maybe it said something really, really.  And how many years did Amy Fisher get?  Seven years?  Something like that?  Yeah.  When she came out, she looked like a hardened criminal.  Yeah, but she kind of gussed herself up.  Who fucking married that?  A guy that looked like.  A guy that looked like.  A guy that looked like.  Yeah, looks like Joey.  But why?  Like, I understand banging her.  She must be.  She must be an incredible lay.  Nice resume stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  Like a psycho bitch like that. 
[04:00:30]  You know she fucking rides that shit hard.  Well, her and her new husband met online.  And he didn't know who it was.  He didn't know who she was, like, online.  They met online?  Yeah.  After she got out?  Yeah.  Yeah, where do you fucking live that you don't know who she is?  I'm not sure.  But, well, because she didn't say who she was.  And then she, online, I guess, said, look, there's something I got to tell you who I am.  Right.  And you might remember blah, blah, blah.  And the guy's like, oh, okay.  Well, I don't care.  You know, they already had kind of a relationship. 
[04:01:00]  Meanwhile, this cock went through the roof.  Of course.  That dirty girl from the news.  Yeah.  Filthy whore.  But I understand banging her.  Don't get me wrong.  I get that.  I don't get the part where you want to marry her.  Marry her.  That's the part where, you know what I mean?  She's got two kids.  She got face work done because she doesn't want people recognizing her.  She looks just like Amy Fisher.  And then she goes on TV to do this big, huge expose that everyone's playing.  She's a genius.  She looks more like Amy Fisher did back then, now, than she did when she got out of prison.  So she don't want people recognizing her. 
[04:01:30]  I'm going to disguise my face.  Yes.  And then I'm going to come out on camera and tell everyone who I am again.  Who I am looking just like the girl that shot the woman in the face.  But even if she looked different.  Yeah.  You're just telling us who you are.  You fucking are.  That's what I mean.  How dumb are you?  Chris in Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Hey.  Just to call you guys out.  Actually, he's been around since like the late 70s.  He used to be a pharmaceutical for post-traumatic stress disorder.  Yeah, but I heard that it was originally distributed as that, and then there was a whole recall. 
[04:02:00]  Shut up.  Well, then people found out how to make it.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But it was called something else, and then they had to remark it.  Yeah.  What was it called back then?  What was it called back then?  MDMA.  Yeah.  It's a chemical.  But the kids weren't buying it.  No kids were buying it.  Yeah, but it was.  So they had to remark it.  I'm sure crack was around in the 40s, too.  You could get it.  It was just like getting value, or getting like Quaaludes or something.  Yeah, but she didn't say I was on MDMA.  She said she was on Ecstasy. 
[04:02:30]  Ecstasy.  As soon as they changed the name to Ecstasy, and they got the William Morris agency behind  it to market it.  Yeah.  Then it started doing real well with the kids.  Then it started kicking ass after.  Dude, Ecstasy has been around since the late 70s.  Yeah.  It has?  Yeah.  It was actually MDMA.  Oh, got up, Jimmy.  Really?  I didn't even know that.  Jimmy knows his stuff.  All right.  She walked up to Mary Jo's house, spinning around glow sticks to techno music, and then  shot her in the face.  You got any skittles?  No.  Well, then hold this.  Did they even have techno back then? 
[04:03:00]  Of course not.  Sure.  They did, actually.  What was it, late 80s?  They had it.  Yeah, they had a little techno.  Yeah.  Early 90s.  Glow sticks?  Did they have glow sticks?  No glow sticks.  Other things they had glow sticks.  Yeah.  You can't have Ecstasy without glow sticks.  No.  The military used them.  They only used them.  It was called the DF4C-022.  Now they're just known as glow sticks.  I want to know how many letters in.  Oh, those were the ones that you cracked, though.  Those were the ones that you cracked.  That was going to pop.  Because I knew it was way longer than one of your...  DFFF...  Oh, fuck. 
[04:03:30]  Slash 209-5.  I wanted it to sound military.  It's got to be long.  Holy shit.  It wasn't real.  I bought it.  Hook, line, and seeker.  No, that one.  When I was a kid, my dad took me to see Kiss in, like, 1979.  Ah, funny.  I wasn't joking.  No, I wasn't kidding.  That joke stunk.  And then he made me put on Kiss makeup and he raped me.  Oh, that's funny.  And the guy behind us, a couple rows, had a glow stick. 
[04:04:00]  It's the first time I've ever seen one.  He had, like, an afro and a glow stick.  Holy shit.  You keep plowing, dude.  You're fucking badass.  No, but it's true.  I'm saying they have been around the 70s.  That's my proof.  Oh, really?  The glow sticks were around the 70s.  There's a guy who was actually wearing one in, like, 1979 at the concert.  Yeah.  Let's go to Lawrence the Tucker.  I'm not kidding.  I don't care.  Oh.  Wait, I'll do it as a joke.  I get there at 79.  He's wearing one around his head. 
[04:04:30]  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Lawrence.  Look at this Mexican-looking guy saying that he has border concerns.  He was white.  He's a Mexican-looking dude going, we need to stop these Mexicans from coming over.  Lawrence called back.  Someone from Canada wanted to defend Canada.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead.  Right?  It's too late now.  What happened?  Oh, damn it.  They hung up.  Couldn't be helped.  Let's hear some Amy.  Yeah, so Amy and Joey got together.  Is this for the first time ever? 
[04:05:00]  Yeah, I think so.  They chose entertainment tonight.  They probably paid them good.  They chose entertainment tonight.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  And they're doing a Facebook page.  Oh, they didn't want to go to extra.  And then they're interviewing.  Me, you, Joey, Amy.  A bottle of booze, some Coke.  Come on.  If you agree with any of this, just shoot my wife in the face.  Shoot my wife, Betsy.  Betsy.  Betsy.  I just want to fucking eat your ass.  Lolita.  So they sat down.  The premise was that they were going to interview each other. 
[04:05:30]  There's going to be no interviewer.  They were going to interview each other.  Ah, good.  Because they both have questions that need to be answered.  That works out great.  Exactly.  Yeah, they said hi in the green room.  Yeah, what was that going to be?  What's that going to be like?  Hey, why'd you shoot my wife?  Hey, why'd you tell me you were going to leave her, you fucker?  Yeah.  Back after this.  What's more shocking revelations?  That's what we need, two fucking idiots to interview each other so we can enjoy the  stupidity of it.  What is that all about? 
[04:06:00]  Lawrence, is this you?  Yeah, it is.  All right, you want to defend Canada?  Yeah.  I'm from Canada, but I really got nothing.  Great.  Good job.  All right.  Great job.  Well done.  Punch it in Canada.  Wow.  She goes, punch it in Canada.  Punch it in Canada.  All right, here we go.  So this is the first clip.  They just start yelling at each other.  Great.  He's an animal.  I didn't pick up a gun, and I didn't shoot anybody.  I was not a hooker.  I was not taking exorcist.  You're disgusting. 
[04:06:30]  Nearly 15 years of intense emotion and unspoken feelings, pent up and festering, broke loose  when E.T. brought the two former lovers face to face.  Okay.  You don't care.  You never cared about me.  You know what?  And I loved you.  You know what?  I loved you.  And that was sad.  And I was a young girl, okay?  And maybe it didn't mean anything to you, but it meant something to me.  So she'd still fuck him.  I said that the first thing this morning.  Absolutely.  If she had the chance, she would fuck him.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely.  You really got a fukio. 
[04:07:00]  After nearly 15 years, the tension that's been your job.  These announcers on these stupid entertainment shows speak human.  They're adding in.  They're trying too hard for that voice.  They're sounding like the radio guys from back in the day.  Remember those?  The fukers.  Hi, everybody.  It's a comfortable 43 degrees outside.  Here we are.  We've put them in a room together.  Well, that's a chat.  And chalk out their pre-employment. 
[04:07:30]  15 years of this.  15 years of this frustration.  And they're coming to us here on the National TV Show.  Only on entertainment.  All right.  Speak human.  They got a wah-wah pedal in it.  Wah-wah, yeah.  Horrid.  Here's the next clip, so.  I was only 16.  It meant something to me.  I loved you.  Yeah.  Great.  That teenage pussy god.  Do you know how fucking great that must have been, man? 
[04:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Like cotton candy and homework.  Yeah.  That smells like...  Like eraser.  Like sweat and popcorn.  Here's what piss tastes like.  Oh, like a little salty from the sweaty.  That's it.  Hubba Bubba and notebook paper.  Yeah.  Worthy of John before you's cum.  Like an Abba Zabba.  Thanks, Jim.  All right.  Visual I didn't want to see.  I always count on you to take the hotness out of anything.  All right.  Here we go.  The second track.  I don't know. 
[04:08:30]  Whatever.  Let's just play it.  Turn back the clock those 14 years when a young Amy Fisher called the Long Island Lolita pulled  out a gun and shot Joey's wife, Mary Jo, in the head right on the Buttafuco's doorstep.  The emotions that created the crucible of violence back then are still running strong.  Then sit back.  I mean it.  Sit back.  You took my whole life away.  Took my whole life away.  You know what?  You took my life, too.  I was a 16-year-old girl.  You know what?  I should have been with 16-year-old boys, not 35-year-old men.  I think you were.  Well, that was her choice. 
[04:09:00]  Well, she acts like she was 11.  She was a little girl, not able to make up her own mind.  She was seduced by the charm that was Joey Buttafuco in his 1980s Long Island Gavon sweatpants.  He was suave back then.  Remember what he looked like?  What a tool.  He had those multicolored Joey Buttafuco sweatpants coming out of his body shop in Merrick or somewhere.  Where the hell?  South Shore Trash. 
[04:09:30]  What the fuck is Jesse Jackson doing at the immigrant rally?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  I know.  It's like multimedia in here.  It's a multimedia experience.  We're like the Fox News Channel screen.  We got five things going on.  We got scrolls and shit going on.  We got five things going on.  She really had the balls to blame him for the fact that she banged him?  Yeah.  More yelling in this.  I was 16.  Emotions ran high with E.T. producer Bonnie Teagle acting as referee between the two fired-up former lovers. 
[04:10:00]  Let's get it out.  I was looking at things were getting out of hand.  I couldn't get a word in edgewise, and they were basically yelling at each other.  That's disgusting.  Why do you even put yourself in that light?  Why do you even put yourself in that light?  Why do you keep doing that?  You have to make it dirty and ugly and something it never was.  Wow.  Did he just pull out it was never dirty and ugly card on her?  It was like a beautiful thing.  Is that what he's saying?  That's what he's saying.  He's like, you got to make it ugly. 
[04:10:30]  It was never like that.  It was love.  I was 35 and you were 16.  At those sleazy South Shore Long Island hotel rooms.  Right?  With a 16-year-old hooker.  Yeah.  You dirty piece of shit.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  I got to side with Joey on that one.  That's a tough one to pass up, man.  That's a tough one to pass up?  I don't care what Uncle Sam says.  That's a rough one to pass up.  16-year-old hooker?  I mean, I'm a good man.  That's a gray area.  But she looked the part.  She didn't look like a kid. 
[04:11:00]  She looked young, but it wasn't like...  Yeah, but you can't call it a beautiful thing 15 years later.  Call it what it is.  Statutory rape?  Yeah.  Nasty, skanky, statutory rape.  Let's go up to Northern Canada.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Bobo!  I'm just wondering what...  You guys make all this fucking money, and I'm way up in Northern Canada.  Do you guys have subscribers in Alaska?  I don't know.  A third of our base, actually. 
[04:11:30]  I don't know, because the fucking reception sucks up here,  and everybody's telling us to get serious, and fucking serious sucks.  No, serious is really good.  You can hear it well if you stand on 44th Street.  Yeah, well, 44th Street.  I'm a thousand miles south of Alaska, and I ain't buying no fucking serious.  A thousand miles south of Alaska.  Where is that?  It's in who gives a shit.  It's right next to where the fuck is this place.  If it wasn't me laying out these oil wells, you guys wouldn't be running your fucking cars down there.  Hey, don't get me wrong, dude. 
[04:12:00]  Oh, yes, we would.  They should put a lot of XM repeaters there.  There's 11 people in your city.  No one cares.  A country of 11.  Hold a seashell up to your ear.  Dude, when a satellite signal can't reach where you are, you need to fucking move, dude.  Really?  It's in space?  That's, yeah, when the most advanced technology the world has ever known can't fucking send a signal to your house.  You need to pick up and get the fucks out.  That's all I'm saying.  He's gone.  Laying oil pipe. 
[04:12:30]  He's mad at you guys because he lives in shitville.  Yeah, let's go to Kurt in Pennsylvania.  Kurt.  Hey, boys, how you doing?  Hey, good.  We're trying to get out of here.  What's going on, bud?  Hey, the first time I met Jody, or, yeah.  Amy and Joe, with the Lingerie Bowl, they put them guys in the coin toss.  They were facing each other.  It was, like, really strange.  They weren't making eye contact.  They both like the attention.  They both like seeing their faces in the news. 
[04:13:00]  They need money, man.  They've got to be paying them to have them do that awkward shit.  Yeah, but you know what, man?  I mean, if they're going to...  Yeah, I agree.  Absolutely.  Yep.  I couldn't have said it better myself.  All right, let's get back to the clips here.  Here's Amy talking about how Joey took her childhood.  You took away my childhood.  You mean?  Good.  You didn't say that.  Okay.  Yeah, you didn't say that.  You said that holding my hand.  Oh, I understand.  We all make mistakes.  Blah, blah, blah.  Because when I found out she was on drugs, it changed everything. 
[04:13:30]  Everything.  Perfect.  Everything.  Once again, violent emotions are impossible to quell,  and the fighting begins all over again.  Terrible attorney to this.  This is a big fight.  You did it, not me.  I wasn't playing.  Yes, you were.  That's exactly what you tried to do.  You know what?  He's not going to let you do that.  I was not.  How about I ask you a question?  You be civilized, even though we know you're not going to be honest,  and then we go home, okay?  And we never see each other again.  Until next time, someone pays us a lot of money.  All right. 
[04:14:00]  What about the radio DJ?  Do you know how much money...  The radio voice.  Did you hear that guy?  Yeah.  Who was that guy?  You know how much money you'd make  if you got those two to do a porno together now?  Do you have any idea how much...  Maybe not as much.  Only you.  Dude.  She sucks his cock and he fucks her in a movie right now?  Yeah.  It'd be better than Rumble in the Jungle.  You think that'd sell?  You think people wouldn't want to see that?  Who wouldn't?  More than they'd want to see this is a Pruder film.  I wouldn't pay, but I would watch it. 
[04:14:30]  You'd pay.  Someone else would burn me a copy.  Well, fucking Eric does it constantly.  He burns Hollywood movies and gives them out.  Larry.  I agree.  That'd be a moneymaker, dude.  What's up, Larry?  Man, he got something all wrong.  He got it all wrong.  Up up here, Canadian.  Ramon!  Canadian sucks spick cock!  All right.  The next clip here, Amy...  Did he just say that he sucks spick cock? 
[04:15:00]  Yeah, that's what he said.  It would have worked, but he said spick unnecessarily.  It was not...  I don't mind that he said it,  but he said he wants to suck my dick.  No, he was saying Ramon.  It's just a stupid thing that Steve does.  It's just a thing.  Oh, that.  We hate the Ramon thing,  but we, you know, Steve could beat us up,  so we got to play it.  Right.  It's just one of those things.  We have no choice in it.  Right.  Do you know Steve?  Yeah, you know.  Okay, you know.  The only guy that doesn't say no homo.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Matter of fact, if you say it to him, 
[04:15:30]  he goes,  why not?  I'm glad, though.  He could have said,  I said cock.  He didn't.  His game is called why not?  Now, Steve's is no homo,  but there's a comma.  No.  Homo.  No.  No comma dash dash pause.  Homo.  There are things he says to himself in the mirror.  All right.  Why don't we jerked off to this week's Sopranos? 
[04:16:00]  Jesus.  Shirtless, stashioed, man.  The field scene.  Oh, wow.  Just let me know when they stop being gay  so I can watch the Sopranos again.  I don't know.  All the other storylines,  is they drop.  This one,  they have no problem not dropping.  They're sticking with the gay line.  Yeah, they're sticking with that whole gay thing.  They're sticking with this one,  but all these storylines that start and end  and you never bring them back.  But the homo angle,  oh, this one.  Oh, they're going to ride that right to the end.  No problem.  And that guy,  every time he walks,  he creeps me out 
[04:16:30]  because he's got that left leg  that pops up into the air really weird.  Have you noticed that?  Yeah.  Well, he just got a hip replacement.  He's a friend of the show.  Oh, okay.  Which guy?  Val.  Whatever his name is.  Did you see this week  when Phil fucking said,  I tell you,  he's getting fucking fresh.  Oh, brother.  The ecstasy is kicking in.  I'm tired.  We've been on the air too long today.  Five and a half hours.  Another reason why this deal is so great.  You get to hear us punch drunk 
[04:17:00]  on some days.  All right, here's the fifth track.  Amy talking to Joey.  What does your wife think of this?  Now, Joey divorced Mary Jo.  Mary Jo.  Well, Mary Jo divorced Joey  because he was having an affair  and cheating on Mary Jo, I believe.  So he has another wife.  Yeah, but not after she got shot.  Not after that.  Like, it was way after that.  Yeah.  Like, that wasn't the straw.  You know what I mean?  How fucking weird is that?  Yeah, the shooting thing  and the adultery and stuff.  Yeah, that's fine. 
[04:17:30]  It was like five years later.  It's like you, you...  Something happened.  She didn't like his hobbies.  Yeah, what do you think?  You like model planes?  What the fuck?  Building them all day.  No time for me.  That guy never takes out the garbage.  Who builds Spitfire's?  I said I've had it with you.  All right, here's the fifth track.  If I can ask you,  what was going through your mind  the morning that you shot Mary Jo?  Cock.  You know what?  I know this sounds like a horrible answer,  but I'm not really sure.  I think it was just... 
[04:18:00]  I think at that particular moment  when I think I was thinking,  I was like...  I thought of you almost like a father figure.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It's really a blur.  She had taken so many pills that night  that she just could not remember a lot.  When I come up in conversation,  like, you can't help it  because we're in the media and stuff  with your current wife.  I mean, what do you tell her about me?  We really don't discuss it.  She'll tell you the same thing.  So she's never asked?  Um, she does.  We talk about some things. 
[04:18:30]  If something will come on the news  or a movie or an old clip,  she'll usually not discuss it.  She won't ask.  That answer pisses off Amy big time.  We don't even talk about you.  Yeah, we don't talk about you.  Sometimes I say,  why not?  Amy used to let me.  But that's about it.  Let all you come up.  That would be so badass  if he actually did that.  Yeah.  That would be so cool.  He's trying to rail her in the ass. 
[04:19:00]  You put it in your ass.  Come on, man.  No, no.  Amy would let me.  Come on.  You know, Amy let me do that.  Yeah.  Odds are,  he ain't getting it after that line.  You getting hard on, Jimmy?  You getting hard on?  I already got a half one.  It'd be very funny  if he actually had said that to Mary Jo  while she still had a bandage  on half her head  and wanted to put it in her shitter.  I don't like that.  Come on.  Amy used to let me.  Amy would have.  Where'd you?  Where'd you?  Where'd you?  Where'd you?  What if you said Amy would have? 
[04:19:30]  Like, Amy would have.  Amy would have.  Amy would have.  Okay, go ahead.  All right, Dowie.  Really?  Dowie can mug me in the ass.  Go ahead, Dowie.  Amy would have let him.  It's horrible.  We're going to fucking hell, dude.  That's great.  Here's more Amy talking to Joey  about the children.  Joey's children.  So what do you tell your children about me?  I don't have to.  I don't have to.  They've never asked?  My children know everything, the truth. 
[04:20:00]  Okay.  I have beautiful, well-adjusted children  for everything that you put them through.  Okay, I did it single-handedly.  Again, you take no responsibility  for your actions, correct?  I take no responsibility  for a relationship that I had with you.  You said you had no relationship.  But I don't take any responsibility  for shooting marriage or any of that stuff.  You said you had no relationship.  This whole time you were sat here,  you've had no relationship.  Well, we were friends.  Oh, friends?  We were friends.  Why would a 16-year-old want to be friends  with a 35-year-old man?  Why don't you tell me?  You accused me of that. 
[04:20:30]  Are we going to start that again?  Yeah, we're going to start that again.  The music.  Yeah, the music.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  And I actually know Joey  and Mary Jo's daughter  because she's friends with a girl,  Tony, who works for Lucky Louie.  She's actually very nice.  Her and Mary Jo came from the show, yeah.  Cool.  That's a girl.  I kind of wanted to hook up  when I found out she was his daughter.  You met Mary Jo?  Yeah.  She's actually, you know,  she knew my stuff.  She's very sweet, yeah.  Has she seen you perform? 
[04:21:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She knew my show.  I forget where.  I think she knew me from Colorado.  Can you spot out her laugh?  Oof.  I don't...  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Everybody's laughing in the middle.  You're wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  That bird is...  Oh, hi.  Wah, wah.  See, Jimmy's funny.  Wah, wah, wah, Jimmy.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Do the joke about the anal.  Wah.  We're just about done.  Here we go.  We're so fucking wrong.  Here's more Joey. 
[04:21:30]  love my children. My family is gone. It's done. You know what? You left Mary Jo for your current  wife. You had an affair with your current wife and you ended up leaving her. So how has your  family gone? You left her. The inner mechanics of my relationship with Mary Jo, you don't know.  You didn't leave. Because if you did, you wouldn't have shot her. You cheated on her with another  woman and you ended up leaving her. The only difference is your wife wasn't 16. Thank God  she was age appropriate and you ended up marrying her. So you know what? God bless you. You're  happy, but it's true. Wait, the husband was there the whole time? No, no, that's another 
[04:22:00]  exclusive that Amy Fisher did. Amy still wants Joey Butterfuco. It's so obvious in these  clips. She cares way too much about his current life. Yeah, she keeps asking, like, what do  you think about me? Yeah, right. And when you talk about me? Do I come up? What do you say  about me? What do you say? That's when you meet that ex-girlfriend that you thought it  was over and then she starts, so, you know, do you guys ever think about me? About me?  Oh, fuck that. No. Once you shoot a person for another person, you're never going to not 
[04:22:30]  want the person you shot that person for. You can't be that into somebody that you shoot  somebody. Did you blast one? Before I did, but no, no, no. When they started yelling,  I got scared. Yeah, he gets scared. Once you blast someone with a fart like that, you never  forget the face. You never forget. No, here's what happened. I was going to hold it and you  look like a fucking ninja over there. Yeah, I have to. I wanted to use the restroom, but 
[04:23:00]  they yelled and I went, oh. Too much half and half today, I think. I didn't have any half  and half. All the skim milk. What's in there? All skim milk. Soy milk, actually. All right.  Is that part of the Fat Smash diet? What is the Fat Smash diet? I've been hearing about  this. It's top secret. Jimmy's reading his 10th sentiment. What is it? What is it? What  is it? I'd love to hear it now. It's an A and B. It's an A and B sentiment and you can  all see your way out of it. Wow. I feel like I'm in grade school. A and B. Whatever you 
[04:23:30]  say, bounce off me because I'm rubber. You're the glue. I am rubber. You're glue. Whatever  you say, bounces off of me and sticks to you. Absolutely. And Hollywood is run by it.  Well, let's play the last clip here. Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco.  I don't know. I'm so disgusted with you. I can't even help it. You're disgusted with  me. I am. You came to my house, shot my wife, destroyed my family, my children, and everything  that was ever near and dear to me. You know something? You're attacking me. 
[04:24:00]  You are a pervert. You are a pervert. You are a pervert. You are a pervert. You are a  body of mine. Shut up. Why is the fucking interviewer there? No, it's something like  producer with really big boobs. A referee, this thing. Why is she there? She had a t-shirt  arm with massive boobs and she was trying to, like, separate them. Exactly. She should  do nothing. Just put them in a room together and let them fight it out and argue. Tyler  and Jersey, we got to get out of here, but what do you have for the show today? Hey, what's 
[04:24:30]  up, guys? Hey, Tyler. What's up? Jimmy going to see you in a couple of weeks at the Bergata.  Cool, thanks. I can't wait. And what I really had to get off my chest was it absolutely disgusts  me how bad my girlfriend wants to bang a little Jimmy. She has stupid pictures of him all over  the wall. No matter what horrible things she says, she still wants to bang him. She wears  a slip-in-a-puddle of AIDS t-shirts to the supermarket. It's terrible. How heavy is she?  Is she fat? No, she's actually pretty hot. Well, how about this? Send me a picture of  this girl. I won't contact her, but to Yellow Treats at AOL. And I just want to look because 
[04:25:00]  I like that. That turns me on. Tell her she can come see me. Right in the middle in the  Bergata. And you got to get a picture with it. She'll love it. It'll be all over her room.  I will. Or she can come see me at the Stress Factory at the end of May.  She'd have to go to that one solo, but I'll let her know.  Fine. You wouldn't let her go see Jimmy Norton solo?  Absolutely. She loves the guy. Most girls, they got all these little vanity things. She has pictures  this Jimmy Norton all over her bedroom. It's terrible. That's because I make love to the 
[04:25:30]  camera. You're not afraid he's going to bang her? Sorry, Jerry. I didn't mean to laugh  too hard. No, go ahead. I'm not afraid. Laugh if you have to. I'm an easy story. I'm an easy  target. But if there's nothing serious, it would be a story. All right, Tyler. Thanks,  Ty. Jimmy will be banging her girlfriend. You could bang his chick and he said it would be  a story. You guys say that, but they really don't mean it. What would the story be? He knocked  my teeth out and then killed her. Nothing. I thought that would get like a big chuckle.  I was all standing up ready to bask in the wall of the lamp. Leave on a high note. Nope. 
[04:26:00]  Well, there's always high notes. All right, Mike, what's up? Hey, what's up, boys? Hey, yo.  Hey, the dentist is at it again. He's saying, Ryan, it says it's going to Free FM.  Yes. Let's go to Lou in Minnesota. Lou? Hey, today I learned that AIDS is not only a disease,  it's up to a dietary supplement. Did we play that today? I know, but I'm a slow learner. 
[04:26:30]  Oh, all right. Let's say hi to Big Bopper. Big Bopper. Hey, I learned if you're rich and  famous and Catholic, when your mom says Jesus, you're writing checks and lighting candles.  There you go. We did learn that. Thanks to Carlos Mencia. John in Utah, what's up?  Yeah, today I learned that all the Canadian callers are standing in large smoking craters.  Let's get a mic in Queens. Mike?  Yeah, today I learned that Carlos' idea of immigration is like the running man. I'm Ben Richards. 
[04:27:00]  Die. Die. Die. Die.  Mark in Ohio, what did you learn on the show today?  I'm too scared. I'm too scared.  That's what he learned. All right, Carl in Jersey.  I learned that. Little Jimmy's going to be at the Boston Orpheum May 12th with David Tao.  Thank you. Very good.  Carlos Mencia, thank you so much.  You're welcome, guys.  The Mind of Mencia on Comedy Central, right?  Yeah.  Anything else?  No, I was just going to hang out with you guys. 
[04:27:30]  Websites.  Oh, go to carlosmencia.com.  Okay.  carlosmencia.com.  There is one other thing.  Oh, yeah.  What, buddy?  Oh.  Oh, you're going to see it?  Oh, you're going to hear it.  Dick, I thought I was going to hear it.  Come on.  Read the goddamn sentiment.  Let that be the last thing we hear today, your sentiment.  Yeah.  That way nobody can say anything.  That's right.  You're going to feel good.  It'll be the last thing.  That's right.  People miss you when you're not around. 
[04:28:00]  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant. 
[04:28:30]  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
