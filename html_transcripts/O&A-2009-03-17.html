<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about Barack Obama's purported 3.1% Irish ancestry, sparked by a truly awful song celebrating this fact.  The hosts played a snippet of the song, deeming it "horrendous."  The conversation quickly transitioned to their upcoming live broadcast from Connelly's pub at 47th and Madison (after initially stating an incorrect address).  This led to a discussion about the annual controversy surrounding the participation of gay rights groups in the St. Patrick's Day parade.  Jim Norton, a guest in the studio, recounted his recent appearance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, with the hosts joking about how his appearance looked in high definition.  The hosts also addressed Don Imus's cancer diagnosis, sharing humorous text message exchanges they'd had with him. A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a very graphic and sexually explicit discussion about prostate exams, including detailed descriptions of the procedure and punctuated with numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  Colin Quinn was mentioned as a scheduled guest who would join them later at Connelly's, along with the planned appearance of a bagpipe band, though neither appeared during this particular segment of the show.
