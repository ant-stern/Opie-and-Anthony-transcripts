<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Reg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and setting the tone with their characteristically unfiltered and profane style. Reg recounted a humorous, albeit painful, back injury sustained while lifting his eight-month-old child.  This led to a discussion about the dangers of painkillers and their irresponsible prescription to celebrities.  The conversation then veered towards the U.S. Open golf tournament, with Norton expressing his disdain for the course, the wicker flags, and Bob Costas.  Phil Mickelson’s golfing woes were also heavily criticized.  Norton's recent Twitter posts of childhood photos spurred reminiscing about his family and upbringing, filled with humorous anecdotes.

A YouTube personality, Max, known for his Sopranos impressions, called in.  He discussed his voice acting experiences, including being unexpectedly replaced on a Bill Cosby show.  Max detailed his YouTube channel, his impressions, and future plans.  The segment concluded with discussions about the UFC, a man found dead in a garbage truck, the Miami Heat’s playoff series, Norton’s sensitive skin, and the hosts’ Father’s Day plans, interspersed with further clips of Max’s Sopranos impressions.

The next segment began with Opie’s unexplained absence, prompting humorous speculation and inappropriate comparisons.  The hosts discussed franchising their show, envisioning a relaxing beach retirement funded by their brand.  They then promoted their podcast, highlighting segments featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Dwight Gooden.  A brief *Man of Steel* review praising Danny McBride's performance, and discussion of Black Sabbath's new album (with sympathy for Bill Ward's absence) followed.

A significant portion focused on Joe Piscopo, playing and dissecting a cringeworthy song he wrote for his then-fiancée, Kimberly. The hosts engaged in highly vulgar and sexually explicit speculation about Piscopo’s relationships and numerous children, interspersed with unsuccessful attempts to reach him for a birthday call.  Other topics included a montage idea based on their mic-on sounds, listener calls, further discussion of Piscopo's children, Barry Manilow’s 70th birthday (and Sal's mother's obsession with him), and their upcoming trip to Branson to see a Greg Brady show.  The segment was punctuated with frequent use of vulgar and offensive language.

The following segment heavily featured Barry Manilow's 70th birthday, beginning with embarrassing personal stories and a rambling introduction about a Manilow concert.  The hosts debated the importance of birthday acknowledgements on radio, admitting to past fabrications.  They reminisced about old radio segments like "Pet Patrol" and "Swap and Shop," and Dennis Falcone, a frequent caller, joined the show.  A large portion focused on a phone call with Joe Piscopo, revolving around his children, dating life, child support issues, and comedic persona.  A running joke involved a rumor spread by a deceased homeless man ("Tippy Tom") claiming a sexual relationship with Manilow, which the hosts repeatedly urged Falcone to incorporate into a birthday tribute (to no avail). Piscopo performed a Bruce Springsteen impression.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Manilow/Tippy Tom rumor, bizarre animal-related imagery, and brief mentions of Chris Cuomo and a CNN morning show’s set design.

A caller then recounted a purported romantic encounter with Barry Manilow, leading to speculation about Manilow’s sexuality. This transitioned to the caller's own sexuality and the hosts’ attempts to set him up with women. A substantial portion mocked contestants from state beauty pageants, focusing on their appearances and perceived lack of intelligence using derogatory terms.  The hosts discussed a studio remodel, specifically the removal of a wall with Paul McCartney and Paul Simon autographs, debating the wall's material.  The conversation continued with crude and offensive generalizations about women and different racial groups. E-Rock's wife, Erica, called in to discuss her husband's extensive toy collection, their plans to have children, E-Rock's fashion, and interracial dating.  The segment ended with further discussion about racial demographics in the US, vulgar statements, promotional announcements, and a transition to another segment.

The final segment analyzed the evolution of hip-hop fashion and its appropriation from other genres, particularly punk rock.  The hosts discussed Dwayne Wade’s unusual suit, Kanye West’s style, and the influence of Tyler, the Creator on skateboarding in black youth culture.  The conversation addressed the N-word, debating its evolving social context and usage.  Jay-Z's album announcement via a Samsung commercial was also discussed, contrasting his style with other rappers. The creative processes of Timbaland and Rick Rubin were touched upon.  Callers Brian (from South Carolina) and Christopher (from Michigan) contributed to the conversation about racial slurs and Troy's music projects respectively. Kanye West's leaked album and its stylistic shift concluded the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ew.  Ah.  No palaver on that one.  What happened to the palaver?  The palaver.  No palaver?  Shocked.  Oh, well.  Is that an old intro? That was nice.  I guess, uh, you know, they want palaver.  They need palaver.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  Hope everyone had a lovely Hatter's Day.  It was wonderful.  Yeah?  Sure.  All the dads?  Sure.  Everyone was tweeting me saying, uh, hope you're having a really good Father's Day.  And if they only knew, I was on the couch with a bad back.  Oh, you are?  Oh, God.  I just told you.  I fucking, I fucking pulled my back out old school.  I haven't done it in like three fucking years.  Oh, let's go. 
[00:02:00]  I've been in like major rehab and strengthening exercises for years.  Yeah.  And, uh, just lifting up my little, uh, eight-month-old on Friday.  Yeah.  Just nothing.  Nothing.  No twisting.  Nothing.  Oh, boy.  And, bam, just knocked it out.  And, psh, where did it go?  And pain ever since.  Huh?  Yeah, the neck, the back.  No, the back.  Oh, boy.  I got the, uh, two herniated discs real low.  Ow.  But I've been really, really happy because I thought I was over it with all the, you know, 
[00:02:30]  rehab and, like I said, the strengthening exercise.  I got all this shit I do.  You ain't got time for that.  Dude, at one point on Friday, I was like a cripple.  I was on the ground.  I decided I needed to lay on the ground.  And, uh.  Does that help?  And I was naked.  No.  Because I took a hot bath.  Oh, come on.  And then, uh, my wife, like an old man, had to try to get me off the floor.  It took us 15 minutes for me to stand back up.  What?  I was in fucking pain, man.  And you're nude?  Oh, I'm nude.  And I'm like. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no.  I'm like, I will kill myself if I'm an invalid.  I'm not dealing with this.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's trying to, like, pick me up off the floor like I'm an old man.  Was she laughing?  Yeah, of course.  There's humor in our house.  Fuck it.  I would hope.  Did you catch her glance at herself in the mirror?  Like, what the fuck am I doing here?  Pretty much, man.  She's a trooper.  And then I laid around for the entire weekend.  So that's what I did for Father's Day.  I couldn't fucking move.  That's kind of good.  I'm leaning to my left here today, so. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, you are capsizing a bit.  No, I mean, I'm much better.  But fuck, dude.  Back pain is the fucking worst.  It's fucking horrid.  And, you know, the doctor wanted to give me painkillers and all that.  I ain't doing the fucking painkiller shit.  But no way.  It never turns out bad when you read about celebrities and back pain.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, it does.  Yeah.  And it all just, you know, it all begins with, well, you know, I pulled out my back.  Next thing I know, I'm taking 80 Vicodin a day.  To deal with the emotional pain. 
[00:04:00]  It was from the Pratt Falls I did on television.  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  It was a movie I did.  Remember that stunt in that movie?  In that movie?  It's always that, and then you're fucking degenerate.  I pulled my neck in the shower.  Now I'm addicted to Vicodin.  Yeah.  Which led to some heroin.  I got on the oxy.  Right, right, right.  It was a car accident back in the 80s.  A little whiplash.  Now I'm taking 200 oxys a day.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  I've always been, like, on high alert of that shit.  And for the people out there that can take, you know, pain kills, and God bless you, but  I've heard the horror stories over the years.  Yeah, yeah.  Those fucking guys just did their stupid office with their scripts.  They just, like, write it like it's no big deal.  They're just like, okay, here's a new fucking drug addict.  Here's another drug addict.  Just fucking starting people down these horrendous roads.  And doctors with, like, celebrities, it seems, they're just kind of like, hey, let me write 
[00:05:00]  this out for you.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, not even check-ins.  Like, ah, you're not, like, a regular guy.  I know you can handle your oxys.  Don't worry about it, right?  Give him a little wink.  Right.  Yeah.  Down this with some vodka.  You'll be fine.  Ah, yeah.  So, I couldn't fucking move yesterday, man.  So, I got to watch that stupid U.S. Open.  You're not a big golf guy, I understand, so I'll keep it short.  No, I actually had it on at the house.  I had a bunch of people over there for Father's Day, and it was on. 
[00:05:30]  It's good to just have it on in the background, right?  You don't have to sit there and study the whole fucking thing.  No, you see some really amazing shots.  You see people cheese whizzing it the whole time.  Well, first of all, you know, I'm a big Philly fan because, you know, I got the in-laws  and stuff down there, and I spent a lot of time in Philadelphia.  First of all, the Marion Golf Course sucks a dick.  I hate their little fucking basket flags.  Well, that's the second thing.  The wicker baskets suck a dick.  They're the stupidest thing ever.  I don't give a fuck they weigh eight to nine pounds.  I don't give a fuck there's a guy that's been working on them for 43 years. 
[00:06:00]  They look ridiculous.  They're stupid.  What's wrong with the flag?  I guess they don't like the wind thing where you could judge the direction of the wind?  Yeah, I guess, which is part of golf.  That's what I was saying.  It's like it's part of the game is being able to look at the pin and go, all right.  Yeah, because you're looking at the flag from, you know, quite a distance.  Yeah.  So, you know, and if you could figure out, oh, I see the flag is moving a bit to the northeast.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  I'll take a little less club.  Look at that thing.  It's the stupidest thing ever.  But NBC Sports, look at the amazing wicker baskets.  They're just such a tradition here of Marion.  Couldn't say enough about the dumb baskets.  Why doesn't someone say they look ridiculous?  They're stupid.  There's no need for them in golf just because this stupid golf course wants to be different.  Yeah.  I hope it doesn't start a trend.  No.  And then Bob Costas.  Did you see this?  Yeah.  All of a sudden he pops up and you go, why is he there? 
[00:07:00]  Why is Bob Costas doing anything?  Like all of a sudden they got to stop everything for a Bob Costas segment or a Bob Costas sports update.  Like why?  What the fuck is he doing there?  And then, of course, somebody.  Like, he's the face of NBC Sports.  That's why he's there.  Someone told you.  I guess.  Because everyone else was on the same page with me on this one.  They're like, yeah, why is he there?  He has nothing to do with the golf.  But there's always one guy.  Oh, there's always one guy.  Jesus. 
[00:07:30]  And not the fake guys that like to do the Twitter voice too.  There's always one real guy, genuine asshole that has to fucking explain why Bob Costas is there.  He's not needed.  He's not needed in that situation.  Did you see him at all?  But he's the face.  I don't know.  I guess because he signed a huge contract with NBC Sports, I guess he has to be at all these events just doing his stupid, you know, vignettes or whatever the hell you want to call them.  And then all of a sudden they go, well, we'll get back to the action. 
[00:08:00]  But here's Bob Costas.  And he does like a five-minute sports report about all the shit going on.  Stuff we could find out about on our phones.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  It's a shitty course.  I mean, they had to, you know, praise it and say, oh, you know, they're calling the course a she.  What?  Yeah, because, you know, it's such a tough golf course.  It's she.  Oh, God.  It's not in anything.  It's a fucking grass.  But if you've got the best golfers in the world and not one guy is under par for the week, that's a shitty course. 
[00:08:30]  And I understand that the U.S. Open really likes to find these really, really tough courses.  But it's a shitty course in the end.  And if not one guy is under par, period, that's my two cents on it.  And then, of course, Phil Mickelson.  Jesus.  Did he choke again?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just, I loathe him.  I don't even watch golf.  I hate him.  He is a choking motherfucker.  It's the sixth time he's been the runner-up at the U.S. Open. 
[00:09:00]  That's, I can't even, that's unbelievable.  How close was he to winning it?  He was leading.  All he had to do was, you know, not fall apart.  I mean, he, I mean, Justin Rose had a really good round yesterday.  But, yeah.  Phil Mickelson was three over yesterday, I think it was, in the end.  Yeah.  Right?  Yep.  Wow.  No, he started the day.  In the end.  In the end, he was three over. 
[00:09:30]  He started the day one under, is what I'm saying.  So he was four over yesterday, yeah.  And all he had to do was fucking not blow it.  Yeah.  You know.  And he put it in from my, what was it, the tenth hole from 76 yards out.  Yeah.  So if he doesn't put that in, it's even worse where he would have ended up.  Yeah.  And, of course, Tiger's a non-issue.  Just a non-fucking.  Plus 13, I think.  Player.  Yeah, but he's having a great year.  But he's panicking now because he wants to catch Jack with the, you know, the majors. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, well.  The majors records.  He's going to do it like that.  He's panicking at this point.  How many more does he have to win?  I think, what is he, five behind, I think, something like that.  You think he'll get it?  People thought it was a no-brainer, but now it's, you know.  That would be a Hall of Fame career to win five majors for anybody.  And he still has to win five more.  How many has he won?  Honestly, I don't know.  More than ten, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, fucking lefty on his birthday, blowing it again. 
[00:10:30]  Ugh.  Just makes me sick.  That's my father-in-law's guy.  And he went from, look at Phil, all excited to, fuck this choke artist, this guy sucks.  What did he write?  It was hilarious.  All he does is choke.  Well, some would say, yeah.  Some would say.  Golf is so weird to have on TV, too, because it's just, it's an all-day thing.  It's like all fucking day.  Yeah.  You just sit there, turn around, well, it's still going.  Yeah, you just put, game is still on. 
[00:11:00]  You put it on as background music.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of like background music, you know.  Yeah, when you walk in, it's, here's the typical thing.  Like, walk in from out back, because it was kind of nice yesterday after a little while.  Walk in from out back to go downstairs to the bar.  And as I pass the couch and the TV is, you know, a rotation of different people that are  on the couch.  People get up, they go outside, new group of people, sit down and watch the game a little  bit.  Right.  And I walk in and just go, hey, how's it going out there? 
[00:11:30]  And then people will be happy to tell you what has happened in the past few months.  Oh, you missed a good shot here.  Because I don't really care.  It's just kind of wave and then you go about your business.  That's all day.  It's a sport where you can just like, all right, I'm going to blow it off for an hour.  And then you come back and not much has changed.  Not much.  Imagine blowing off an hour of a football game.  Right.  Yeah, it is.  And assuming not much has changed.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I like it, though. 
[00:12:00]  I like just laying around on a Sunday as long as it's not really nice out and just fucking  checking it all out.  So.  Yeah, it was fucking kind of shitty.  Then it got kind of nice.  Very windy.  Had a bunch of people over, though, you know.  Nice.  A lot of kids.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of the kids in the pool.  And you just look around and go like, wow, what a stark difference my little get-togethers  are.  A week makes.  There's like, yeah, there's like, you know, the kids in there and they're flapping around. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Then you think back and go, oh, my God, there was just fucking debauchery going on.  Right.  Yeah.  It was good, though.  And I could see the family.  Nice.  I was digging the old school photos you were tweeting.  Oh, my God.  Dawn found a bunch of them, my sister.  They were great.  Those fucking.  And put it up.  Oh, my God.  It was fucking hilarious.  We had a bunch of little faggots.  Yeah.  The famous fur coat.  Mm-hmm.  The picture of the whole family with the dad and mom dressing me and my brother up with 
[00:13:00]  the same shirts and everything.  What the hell she was thinking.  Yeah.  We have pictures like that, too.  Yeah.  We have the same shirts.  Same shirts.  And then one picture where my dad's cigarette is right in my face.  Right.  Like, let's take a picture.  Yeah, look.  There's me with my fur coat.  Joe looks like a girl.  Joe just looks like a girl.  Yeah.  It was the time, though.  We all look like girls.  Everyone grew fucking hair back then, right?  Terrible.  My fucking gray fur coat. 
[00:13:30]  Who's the broad?  Who's the broad?  That's mom.  That gray one is your son?  That's really mom?  Yeah.  I've seen this photo over the years, and maybe I'm thinking of another photo where I assumed  it was your mom and it wasn't.  Wow.  That doesn't look like your mom.  Nah, that's, you know, back in...  The day.  I get it.  The day.  Nice.  Still going.  I still go to that place now.  It used to be my grandparents' house.  Now my aunt and uncle live there.  Still go there.  Wow.  Still go right in there.  It's fucking the living room and the kitchen over there.  It's just, you know, the wallpaper's changed over the years, the light fixture. 
[00:14:00]  Oh my God.  The house is still in the family.  Yes.  I go there on a lot of holidays.  And there are pictures of us younger than that in that house.  Wow.  Are you your aunt Fran?  Yeah.  Aunt Fran and Uncle Tony's house.  Yeah.  That house, I've been going there since I can remember.  No kidding.  Yeah.  It's pretty weird.  Just look at...  Like, I go through a thousand pictures, and it's in the same fucking place.  Just, you know...  And the background changes for the decades that go by, but same place.  Oh, that's wild.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, and then the picture.  A lot of people are very excited to see my dad's pictures of that, because I don't  think...  I don't really think there's...  There's not many pictures of them around.  I think I've seen only, like, one over the years, until yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  You had a couple different ones.  I was...  When I was texting you yesterday, I'm telling you, your dad looks like a fucking character  actor.  He looks like Richard Kuklinski in this one picture.  I was going to say, you look like bald Wolverine. 
[00:15:00]  That was Smokey.  Joe Holden's Smokey the Cat, if you remember the story of Smokey.  Yeah.  Dad said that Smokey ran away, and then I found Smokey on the side of Hawthorne Avenue,  crushed.  And I turned him over with a stick, and he was flat on the bottom with maggots eating  him.  Were you bummed?  Oh, yeah.  Look.  He was a little Smokey.  Yeah, it's the whole happy family.  That was the most tumultuous period in our lives when we lived at the garden apartments 
[00:15:30]  in Central Islip.  But you take a very happy family picture.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, boy, look at that.  The tears behind those smiles.  What was going on during that period of time?  That was October of, whoa, I guess there was a misprint on the film.  It says 70.  What?  Are you serious?  That's, wow.  All right.  I don't know.  The Polaroid must have been on the fritz. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I guess that was, I don't know what that was.  I don't know why we're even together.  I don't know who's taking the goddamn picture.  Who's in the green?  That's my father's mother.  Nana.  That's a Nana.  She said, of course.  But who's taking the picture?  Why are we there?  Who's smiling?  Why are we smiling?  Well, it's for a picture you're supposed to smile.  It's the only time you guys smiled, right?  Oh, was that a fucking...  That apartment is actually a spaghetti on the wall apartment. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Central Islip.  Right on Hawthorne Avenue, the garden apartments.  And, yeah, that was that.  There was a lot of fighting.  That was the apartment where my mom repeatedly over and over again yelled at my father and  called him a fuck face.  And I just remember, you fuck face.  You fuck face.  And I'm just like, oh, well, I'm crying.  That was where we used to sit on the couch, on opposite ends of the couch, to watch Ronan  Martins laughing. 
[00:17:00]  Sure.  And I would try to sneak out and watch around the doorway of the bedroom.  And they were just like fucking snipping at each other about things.  That was terrible.  I hated that time.  Your mom's hot there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I used to love that all my friends thought she was really pretty.  She was absolutely a milf.  I'd make her go to...  You had a milf her, mom.  Oh, yeah.  I'd make her go to field trips and wear fucking mini skirts and pigtails. 
[00:17:30]  Why did you make her do that?  Because I wanted my friends to think my mommy was pretty.  Why?  What a fucking ghoul.  That's creepy, man.  It was nothing like that.  Did you actually ask her?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To wear the pigtails?  That was a pretty put-in pigtail.  Oh, my God.  Mom, where's the short skirt you usually wear?  What?  Oh, that's hilarious.  She would.  She would.  She would wear go-go boots and fucking mini skirts to go on field trips as the field mother 
[00:18:00]  on the school bus.  What's going on with you, man?  Huh?  I saw you tweeting a picture of your sister's cleavage yesterday.  I'm like, what are you going on with this guy?  That's hilarious.  That's a weirdo.  It's just fucking...  I goof around on my sister all the time.  I had a Vine video where you said Dawn's almost touching herself.  She wasn't...  She was singing...  It made me click on it.  I'll be honest with you.  But she was singing the Divinal song, I Touch Myself.  See, I couldn't really hear the audio.  Yeah, that was why. 
[00:18:30]  I said, is Dawn touching...  I got excited because I'm like, oh, I get to see maybe Aunt's sister touching herself.  No, no.  It was a joke about the song she was singing.  She was singing the Divinal song, I Touch Myself.  No, and then I just took a picture of Warren drawing and showing his drawings to Dawn, and  I didn't even notice until I looked at the picture that Dawn's kind of leaning over.  Yeah.  Her ample boobage is...  You might want to have explained that a little better.  Well, I did.  Because it made it seem like you actually saw the cleavage and said, I got to fucking take 
[00:19:00]  a picture of this.  I always goof on her like that.  I know.  Yeah.  Just fucking around.  Yeah.  A little Warren.  How's his drawing skills?  Oh, he just...  All he draws is cars.  Really?  It's just...  And then he'll have to tell you about it.  This is a car, this is a truck, and a bus, and these are the machine guns on the side  of it.  Dude, the kids are fucking weirdos.  They are weirdos. 
[00:19:30]  How old's Warren?  He's a little older than...  Yeah, he's like fucking...  My son, right?  Yeah, he's a little older.  Because my son on Friday lined up 30 of his guys.  His guys could be anything from a fucking Yo Gabba Gabba fucking thing, to a Toy Story  thing, to an army man, to just a car, an airplane, it doesn't matter.  He lined up 30 of them, and I had to...  He asked me what each guy's favorite ice cream was.  What the fuck is that?  And he had to go through all 30.  I ran out of flavors after 10. 
[00:20:00]  Of course you would.  So then I said Maple Walnut.  He goes, Maple Walnut?  That's not an ice cream.  Oh, boy.  So then I started repeating ones that I already came up with, and he caught me on that.  So I had to come up with 30 fucking ice cream flavors for his guys.  Why do they all have to like different ones?  Why can't any of them enjoy chocolate?  Oh, boy.  Why don't you talk to him about that?  And maybe he'll explain.  I have no idea what goes on in that head of his.  But he picked up each guy.  What's his favorite ice cream?  And then I had to say it, and then he would put it to the side.  30 of them. 
[00:20:30]  30 of them.  You don't go after like five.  You don't go, we're going to do this.  We're going to finish this.  Yeah.  And his...  Yeah.  You'll learn that in their stupid little fucking brains.  It's the most important thing ever.  So you kind of let them do their thing.  It's like, why does an airplane have a favorite ice cream?  That's a great question.  That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  That's a great question.  You should have explained lactose intolerances.  None of them like ice cream.  None of them.  Because they fart a lot when they have it.  It hurts their little stomachs.  Let's try to...  It's like, you know, when you fly your fucking drone in the fucking air. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  That's...  In his mind, he's flying a drone.  It's very important.  Very important.  Above the Long Island Expressway.  You know, you can't...  You just got to go through the process.  Yeah.  He made up awful ice creams.  Oh, he likes...  Oh, I did.  He likes pea ice cream.  Just take it from ground peas.  You have a bowl of peas and you mash them and you freeze it.  And that's pea ice cream.  No.  He likes lima bean ice cream.  No.  Just terrible ones.  30 of them.  I had to come...  30 of them.  This was my Friday night. 
[00:21:30]  I'm like, you know what I used to do with a Friday night?  Oh.  Oh, we got Max calling in.  Oh, hey.  Yo, Max.  Good morning.  That's Max.  See, we didn't want Max.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on, man.  Let's try this again.  We're going to try this again, Max.  Oh, no.  Go on.  Hey, everyone.  It's Max.  Let's say hi to Max. 
[00:22:00]  Max, what's going on?  Oh, how the fuck are you?  Jesus Christ, you're straight and fucking boarded out here.  You're in L.A.?  I am.  And I just talked to E-Rock.  Oh.  And I looked him up on the internet.  And I found the first picture I find is a picture of him with my ex-girlfriend.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  Alex Borstein.  He's a hell of a lot more successful than I am.  Yes.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  From Family Guy.  From Family Guy.  Oh, okay. 
[00:22:30]  I thought a real...  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's really...  That's really your...  Was your chick?  Yeah.  In the old days.  The glory days.  When she drove a convertible red Volkswagen.  And a lot of things happened on the hood of it.  Oh.  Whoa.  Can I just tell you guys something?  You have no idea the boost you have given me.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Sopranos was 2006 when it ended.  I'm trying to move on with my life.  And this Sopranos thing haunts me.  And now, with you guys talking about me, and believe me, it's infinitely more entertaining 
[00:23:00]  listening to you guys do commentary on my videos than watching the videos.  No, you do an amazing job.  Of course, Max is the guy that does the Sopranos.  Yeah, Tony.  And the Sopranos videos.  Christopher.  Yeah, amazing job with that shit.  Yeah, we found that and was just like, holy shit, this guy's amazing.  Who turned us on to it, actually?  Somebody.  I did.  Was in.  No, it wasn't you, Jimmy. 
[00:23:30]  I thought it was you, Ed.  I don't think it was me.  It wasn't me.  I have no idea.  Hey, have you ever done voiceover work for cartoons or anything?  Because you're really good.  Yeah, I'm on a show right now that's on Nickelodeon called Kung Fu Panda, Legends of Awesomeness.  Oh.  Yes.  And I actually just won the Daytime Emmy for Best Series.  And I play Master Mantis on that show.  That's the character that Seth Rogen voices in the movies.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've done about, you know, we've done about three seasons of that and it actually, new 
[00:24:00]  episodes start airing this week and so all of this timing is crazy.  It's really good.  The fans are great.  Even though it brought in, like, new haters.  Yes, of course.  But, uh, no, I mean, they've been amazing.  See what happens with our show?  Like, why can't people just fucking enjoy this shit?  I love how you address the haters, too.  It's very funny.  Your video is just, like, in character, you know, addressing the haters.  Right.  Max, where are you from originally?  I was born in Lansing, Michigan, and that didn't, that kind of sucks, so. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  When I was a kid, you know, I was, I was pretty messed up with, you know, doing voices and  weird faces in the mirror and wigs and dresses and shit.  So my mom's like, we gotta get him out of here.  Yeah.  Brought me to L.A.  So you've been out there a while, huh?  Yeah, my whole life.  It's been a series of hit and misses.  I've come very close to, you know, to the big breaks or whatever, but, uh, now it's  pretty good.  Like, actually working in voiceover's been great.  I do a lot of video games, commercials, you know, dubbing. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Um, so yeah, I mean, I've been on a billboard, but if you look at me, I look like a fucking  Cro-Magnon man.  Really?  Like, voiceover is so much better for me.  Yeah.  What, what else have you, uh, you done as far as any other cartoons or, uh, uh, well,  oh, I, uh, I got cast in Nickelodeon's, uh, Fatherhood, which was a, a Bill Cosby series.  And, uh, he decided to, uh, replace me two episodes in, I was doing like this crazy old 
[00:25:30]  man character.  And I told everyone that I was going to be on this show, everyone, and everyone gathers  around on a Thursday night to watch a primetime cartoon that Max has, you know, two big scenes  and, and I'm listening to the voice and he comes out and he sounds more like this or  whatever.  And I, my heart sank in my asshole.  That's not me.  That's not me.  They replace you like that and they don't tell you all these people are calling.  What was that about?  It almost like told me to, to stop acting altogether. 
[00:26:00]  Wait, they don't even tell you?  No, they don't tell you.  Holy fuck.  You're indispensable.  What a bunch of pussies.  Wait, had you, had you recorded all your scenes first and they just decided to pay you?  Oh yeah.  Got paid and everything.  And then, you know, next thing you know, maybe Cosby's cousin wants to do a voice on  the show or something.  Oh wow.  Holy fuck.  But they don't even have the balls to fucking tell you.  But the courtesy.  It's the courtesy.  Really?  Fuck the balls. 
[00:26:30]  No, no, there's no courtesy.  No, no courtesy.  Oh, once you're, once you're paid and stuff, you go fuck yourself.  Right.  Damn.  Go fuck yourself.  And with the Tony impression, which is fucking amazing, I mean visually and audio wise, it's  just amazing.  How did that come about?  Was it a natural?  Did you get right into it and be like, holy shit, I can't believe I could do Tony really  well?  Or did you have to work on that?  Well, I got to tell you something.  And, you know, that show infected me like a very bad virus. 
[00:27:00]  I was really strung out on it and it hit me on a personal level and I was so into those  guys.  I mean, I was always into crime and mob shit anyway, of course, like all of us or whatever  I was talking.  But The Sopranos had something else.  It had a whole other element.  And I had never seen a performance like Gandolfini.  It's so funny, too, in the first season when you look back, because he kind of like has a  little bit of a list when he's talking about it.  Yeah, yeah.  And then by the time I get shit, he ended the show, he's like, hey, shit, he's loyal, 
[00:27:30]  buddy.  So it's like, I'm watching it and it just wore over me.  And it wasn't like one of those things where I practiced in a mirror.  I just would be at parties or whatever and people would talk about the show and they'd be  like, hey, do your Tony.  I'd do that.  And then my friend said, you know, you ought to put it on YouTube.  You ought to make a video of yourself.  And I didn't even know what the hell YouTube was.  So I spontaneously shot the Maxi channel Tony Soprano and here we are at 3.5 million 
[00:28:00]  views.  But that's for everything.  But that's really kind of low in numbers on YouTube if you're a real YouTube star.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, it's the goofy shit that really goes over the top.  I mean, your stuff is really, really clever and just funny, man.  Yeah, you guys have been so great.  Seriously, I'm so grateful.  And now I'm getting into your show.  Oh, oh, really?  Yeah, I wasn't a listener.  And now I'm totally into it.  I'm starting to, I just watched you guys with Scott Thorson. 
[00:28:30]  I was dying.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  There wasn't a soft cock in the room.  I guess we should say, I think he exaggerates a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because people have been breaking down that interview.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I guess Scott Thorson said he was with Liberace for 17 years.  Yeah.  But the math doesn't add up.  He said on and off, so I'm guessing that he just kind of kept in touch.  Yeah, but Liberace died in, when, 87 or something like that? 
[00:29:00]  A long fucking time ago, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was impossible for him to have a 17-year relationship with a guy.  And then he has a Charlie Manson story.  He's got a lot of stories.  Yeah.  It's going to be on this week's podcast, by the way.  Guaranteed.  Who in Hollywood didn't suck that apparently giant cock of yours?  Everyone sucked his big cock.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Ronald Reagan, when he was the governor of California, sucked my cock and Nancy held it.  All right.  Good for you.  So, Max, you kind of blew off your YouTube channel.  And all of a sudden, we kind of, I don't know. 
[00:29:30]  I was going to say we discovered it.  Yeah, I guess we discovered it within our own fucking community.  Yeah, our own world.  And now you've got to start making videos again, it looks like.  Yeah, I was done with YouTube until you guys revitalized me.  And it was so great.  I laughed so hard when you guys were trying to get through the Jack Nicholson thing.  You're like, what the fuck?  Why is Jaws there?  I was like, wait a minute.  What?  A 40-year-old movie reference guy? 
[00:30:00]  I know.  I can't help it, though.  I'm a real weird dude.  Like, I'm not one of the, I don't consider myself an impressionist.  I can't stand in some fucking shitty club with a brick wall doing impressions.  And I would rather blow my brains out.  And it would look something like this.  Right.  I like the Jaws character in that video, by the way.  Yeah, it was fun.  I mean, I was just like, oh, I want to do something so weird.  And I had just seen The Shining again.  And a lot of stuff really freaks people out.  And a lot of stuff like, I mean, I have a lot of people that send me presents. 
[00:30:30]  And, you know, I mean, I've got a really great little fan base on my own.  But, no, I do like making the videos.  I'm going to make some more.  It's so funny because now everyone wants more Tony.  But there's just so many Tony videos.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to put something else out.  I have a friend who I think would make a great Carmela.  Oh, shit.  And I've already written her and me.  And, you know, because the whole thing about the videos was I wanted to continue the show. 
[00:31:00]  And nothing would make me happier if HBO hasn't put out a Blu-ray yet.  But I don't know if it'll ever fucking happen.  But it'd be amazing if on an extra disc they put all the Sopranos videos I did on there.  Because, you know, I've worked actually with a lot of the cast members doing Tony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and they all give it the stamp.  So who knows?  It is good, man.  And the facial expressions, that squint off to the side thing.  Right.  With the lilt in the voice and that part. 
[00:31:30]  It's like just to pick up on those little things is so fucking clever, man.  And you nailed Christopher, obviously.  Oh, that was...  Holy fuck.  The way it just pops on.  Hey, Tom.  It's fucking head going back.  Oh, my God.  My long-suffering wife just came out.  And she's like, can you keep it down?  I know this is important.  Oh, shit.  That never ends.  No, no. 
[00:32:00]  Derek, a bunch of people calling.  They're excited you're on the line.  Derek wants to know if you've moved on to other impressions.  Yeah, well, I'm trying to develop all the Sons of Anarchy dudes.  Wow, yeah.  My new Sopranos.  And I think that show is awesome.  So, I'm working on those dudes.  Because I have a big Ron Perlman head.  So, I think it would be good to channel that dude.  Yeah, Ron Perlman's fucking scary.  That giant fucking head.  Is he the guy we had in?  Yeah, we had him once. 
[00:32:30]  Man, he was pretty good.  He was very cool.  Pretty fun to have on.  He does voiceover now, you know, a lot, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we liked him a lot.  He was very cool.  Yeah, video games are pretty sweet, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I was on an Xbox series called, excuse me, 3 in the morning, Outlaw Golf.  Yeah.  Outlaw Volleyball.  Oh, sure.  I just played all these, you know, psychos.  There's just nothing like getting in a booth, getting behind a microphone, and being paid to be a maniac.  Yeah.  It's really great. 
[00:33:00]  Kyle, we should get him over to Rockstar.  Yeah.  We know the gang over at Rockstar.  Oh, is that true?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we've had ourselves on a couple of those little ditties there, Grand Theft Auto and stuff.  Our good friend is in charge of all the sound for GTA and other games over there.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  Yeah, I've actually worked for them in the past.  I don't remember the games, but I've done some stuff for them.  They're great.  Yeah, I was, hey, watch where you're going. 
[00:33:30]  Utility player.  Yeah, yeah, whatever they need.  That's exciting, though, for us in our dumb world.  Oh, shit.  Anything in the pipe there?  You got anything you're working on?  Yeah, well, just still working on the show.  We're in post-production for one more year, and I'm auditioning a lot.  I'm being asked to read for a lot of different things.  So, you know, I really just want to take it up a notch with the videos.  I wish I had a budget and a crew.  I mean, you know, if I didn't have, because I film myself all the time. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  No one would have the patience for me.  I mean, I'd have to really get someone who is good with a camera.  I suck at editing.  I'm still editing on a, like a PC, you know, like Windows Movie Maker.  So I bought a Mac.  I bought a new camera.  I bought Final Cut or whatever, and it just sits there.  So I've got to take it on.  They look good, though, the videos.  Absolutely.  It's not like, you know, it looks true to form.  Yeah, definitely.  Hey, was that siren actually playing in the background? 
[00:34:30]  No, no, that totally happened spontaneously.  And, of course, I had to cut the sound from that and make it as if they had both stopped for a second.  Yeah, yeah.  And listen to the siren.  It's just one of those crazy organic things.  It's just that there's another Tony Soprano video where I do Tony talking to AJ.  And he's, like, 35 now, and I've got a black wig on, and Tony's sitting on a couch or whatever.  And a helicopter flew through, so I had to work that in, too. 
[00:35:00]  I'm a little bit of a method-y actor.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of annoying.  No second take.  No.  You got no patience.  That's like the World's Worth Doctor, right?  I got no fucking patience.  Oh, shit.  All right, there, Max.  They're telling us you got to go.  I got to go.  Wait, give us a little more Tony, man, before we leave.  Before we leave, please.  Okay.  You guys are fucking awesome.  I'm going to go back in the fucking bed, and I'm going to grab my fucking wife's ass, 
[00:35:30]  and I'm going to fucking squeeze it.  And I might even stick my fucking dick in there.  Blow a load all over.  Yeah, and then you whack her.  Oh, Jesus.  Chip.  Bye, guys.  You ruined everything.  Once again, the big plug.  What's the YouTube channel there, Max?  Oh, thank you.  It's Bowler Hat on YouTube.  Bowler Hat, I think, without the S.  Bowler Hat.  Okay, one word.  Bowler Hat without the S.  And then you can find all my links.  Go follow me on Facebook and all that shit.  Right.  So, it's all good. 
[00:36:00]  And I believe we've linked you to our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  So, Max, pleasure meeting you, man.  Yeah, definitely, man.  Thanks, guys.  Good stuff.  Yeah, we look forward to your next video, and if you're ever in New York, please look us up.  No, I would love to.  It'd be great.  You could sit in and do some Tony and some other shit with us.  That'd be fun.  All right, brother.  Thanks, Max.  All right, Max.  That was a big deal.  That's a big deal for him right there.  He's fucking great.  Is this the one where he talks to AJ? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Let's listen to this for a second.  Let me see it.  Oh, he's got a little Bowler Hat logo.  Bowler Hat Productions.  Watch out.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Part 8.  Jesus.  AJ, what the fuck?  You were dreaming.  Yeah, I had a few drinks. 
[00:37:00]  I must have passed out.  Well, what are you doing?  Cupping some fucking Z's.  I need permission from you?  Whatever.  Listen, I need money.  What?  Please show mother.  Mom doesn't live here anymore.  Remember?  Wake up.  I need money.  It's pretty good. 
[00:37:30]  Jesus fucking Christ, AJ.  How the fuck old are you?  I'm 32.  I'm 32.  And you've not changed in 20 fucking years of living.  A salute.  Fucking cop, there's overhead and shit.  He's laughing.  I got issues.  I almost tried to off myself.  I need money.  I should have let you drown.  What about your job? 
[00:38:00]  I don't want to be in the movie business anymore.  That company you hooked me up with?  They don't even make real movies.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What about Cleaver?  What was that?  Chopped sausage?  That movie sucked.  Even you said it.  All the movies they ever make are fart bombs.  And they never turn up on DVD or even show up on cable in the middle of the night.  Cadence is good.  What do you want from me?  I want money.  Oh, I got that part.  I'm going into the city.  It's my night. 
[00:38:30]  Your night for what?  To make an asshole of yourself again somehow?  To pay for the Cristal.  It's my night.  I'm going out.  Hernan.  He knows every episode, man.  That little dwarf I always have to tip?  Are you fucking kidding me right now?  Have you not seen the news?  No.  I watch cartoons.  Cartoons that make me feel like a high man.  That's all I do. 
[00:39:00]  My shit for brain, son, huh?  Look at you.  Have you not picked up a fucking newspaper?  God forbid ever, AJ.  Don't you know that this country is flying face first into a fucking catastrophic depression?  Huh?  Blame Bush.  Don't you fucking talk about George Bush that way, AJ.  You got no right.  And you can forget about Cristal.  You drink Andres. 
[00:39:30]  Or Cooks.  Or Barefoot Bubbly.  Or whatever the fuck.  Whatever the fuck.  That's all your wish.  I hate you.  Oh, yeah?  Huh?  What the fuck else is new?  Should have disowned you a long time ago, AJ.  Huh?  Fucking breathing.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it's funny.  AJ.  AJ, come back. 
[00:40:00]  I'll give you the fucking money.  AJ.  The wig.  Jesus.  AJ's wig.  The wig.  Bowler hat on YouTube.  Check it out for yourself.  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  That's just fucking funny.  You close your eyes.  You really think it's Tony Soprano?  Yeah, he does that.  He does that.  Amazing.  With T.  You hear us improv-ing before?  Yeah, yeah.  That was good, Chipper.  Chipper was over my house. 
[00:40:30]  Watch UFC.  UFC.  UFC's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did that go?  Oh, my God.  It was good.  I love Chipper.  It was good.  Rashad won, right?  Yes.  Nice.  I didn't get to watch.  Neither did I.  Why?  I crap right out.  I fell asleep during the...  Yeah, me and Benny just wound up watching the Rashad fight.  But as soon as they were weighing in, that's my aunt's eyes going back.  Yeah, I've been up like all fucking day.  I woke up so fucking early because it was kind of nice out. 
[00:41:00]  And I was like, I'll wake up early and just fucking lay outside instead of in the house.  And I didn't go to sleep.  I thought I was going to fucking go to sleep.  I got pretty burned up.  Yeah.  I got quite the color on me.  I'm getting quite dark.  The Rashad fight, was it good?  It was decent, yeah.  I heard it was like lackluster a little bit.  What do you want?  Good, man.  Yeah, he did win on a decision and...  We're big fans of Rashad, man.  Yeah, and Roy Nelson got beaten.  Right.  He fought terribly. 
[00:41:30]  Right on.  Rashad.  This guy, by the way, that's on the cover of the Post, who got the fucking...  They put him in a garbage heap.  He died and they threw him in a van with garbage bags.  Right.  He got drunk and just passed out on the street after he got home.  And then he got run over?  He got run over.  He fell asleep in the street.  What a way to die.  Jesus.  That's how you die.  You fall asleep in the street.  And then we put you in a van with a bunch of garbage.  And the family's outraged by that part of it?  I don't know if it's the family.  I'm guessing, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  What was the problem?  What happened?  I kind of saw that.  I didn't really understand it.  It's saying that...  He gets hit by a truck or something because he's passed out drunk in the street.  And then they got to remove the body, so they happen to put him in a van or something with garbage?  From the back of the medical examiner's office, there was grimy bags of trash in it.  But, you know, if that's what's available...  I get it, but it's his body who gives a fuck.  Yeah, he didn't seem to care too much about his own body. 
[00:42:30]  I fell asleep in the street.  I feel bad for him.  It's a terrible way to go, but fucking come on.  I've had some nice buzzes over the years, but I've never fucking decided I need to sleep in the streets.  I don't understand that.  People, I guess, just black out, huh?  That's a real thing?  I guess so, man.  Black it out, yeah.  I've always felt like I never officially blacked out.  Yeah, I felt like...  I was too paranoid to fucking just black out.  I don't know.  Not like that, or when you just...  They say they've just found themselves driving the wrong way down the expressway, and it's 
[00:43:00]  like, how the fuck do you get like that?  I don't know.  I don't know how you could figure out how to get on the Long Island Expressway the wrong  way.  Yeah.  It's not the easiest thing.  That's a hard turn.  It's a little hairpin turn.  It's unbelievable.  Wouldn't you know that something's not right at that point?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I know you're not into the NBA, but keep your fingers crossed.  Why's that? 
[00:43:30]  Miami Heat might be going down.  What's the score of the series?  Three games to two, but the last two are in Miami, so...  I haven't watched any of it.  But Spurs are looking pretty damn good.  Do you want the Heat?  I fucking hate the Heat.  I fucking hate LeBron James.  I haven't been watching.  I don't like the one guy who's not nice to me.  I support Cleveland.  I support Cleveland and what happened to them.  Those poor fuckers.  And LeBron had every...  Yeah, I know he had every right to go to wherever the fuck he wanted to go, but it was the way  he did it that I and many others have a problem with to this day. 
[00:44:00]  Where the whole city was just assuming that he was re-signing because, you know, he...  Because they had a giant picture of him up there.  It's like, he's got to re-sign.  What are we going to do with this big wall?  Just completely unaware of what he meant to that whole fucking city, I guess.  Yeah.  Do they cheer him when he goes there?  Oh, God.  Not at all.  Yeah.  And then, you know, he joins Dwayne and the gang and the dinosaur and fucking Chris Bosh  is just a strange looking dude. 
[00:44:30]  He was a douche when I met him, Chris Bosh.  Bosh?  Yeah, I didn't like him.  Most NBA players are douches, right?  Yeah, most of them.  Although the guys that have been here, have come in here, have been great.  Chris Weber was amazing.  Kareem was amazing.  Dr. J was amazing.  Shaq was unbelievable on our show.  Just couldn't be cooler.  Yeah.  I think that's about it as far as NBA players we've had.  Yeah.  Because most of them just blow us off.  Most athletes blow us off for whatever reason.  Because they're dicks.  You think?  Most of them are, yeah.  I'm very itchy. 
[00:45:00]  My fucking shirt, I washed it first and dried it.  I hate my skin.  It's so sensitive.  Baby pussy skin.  You are very baby-like.  My whole body is one giant baby ass cheek.  Fucking put some desicc on my whole fucking body.  Yes, yes.  Is that shirt brand new?  It is, but I washed it.  It's a new Sabbath shirt.  Is it soft, though, or is it kind of that itchy black?  It's an itchy...  All these dark, deep black dyes are itchy, and you have to wash them a few times.  I can't wear stiff t-shirts anymore, man.  They have to be ridiculously soft.  Dude, this is fucking... 
[00:45:30]  It's a cool-looking shirt, by the way.  Black Sabbath 13.  Your skin feels like...  Really?  Like that fucking...  And I thank God I washed it.  You are a sensitive boy.  It's a giant baby ass cheek.  Oh, my goodness.  All red and tender.  You get diaper rash everywhere.  I do.  I fucking hate it.  We got to play that bimbo from the pageant last night.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We could do that after the break.  Yeah, we'll eat something, I gather.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  How was everyone else's weekends?  Sam?  It was good.  Yeah?  Iraq?  I was good.  Yeah.  Oh.  Iraq, are you trying to become a father?  Yeah, we're working on it.  Oh.  Doing some of that fucking...  It's the only way to do it, I hear, right?  Well, really.  You know, you could do that shit.  But, you know, if you're just trying, you know what they're doing.  Iraq is going to be a good father.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The kid will outgrow Iraq's toys in fucking three years. 
[00:46:30]  Dad's toys are faggy.  He'll be a great father until the kid turns.  Yeah, you're right.  About eight.  Only Turks.  Only babies.  My wife takes over.  Aw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about...  Probably good at making those babies, though.  What about Sam?  You working on it?  No.  No?  I'm not trying right now.  Pulling out or are you rubbering?  I'm the pull-out king.  Pull-out king?  Yeah.  Pull-out.  Jesus.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Jeez Louise.  At some point. 
[00:47:00]  At some point, we will.  At some point, you'll leave it in there.  At some point.  Oh, yeah, it will.  I feel like it's going to be good.  At some point, I'll give up my crown.  Hold on.  Here it comes.  At some point, are you going to pull the goalie?  Oh, God.  Right now, you're just pulling out and spraying?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  All over the walls, the windows.  Sam the Sprinkler Roberts.  Yeah.  Right there.  Like a cat in a new home.  Oh, yeah.  Spraying everything.  Just fucking spraying.  Marking that territory.  Do you say when you're going to come...  I can't picture Sam talking dirty and saying, I'm going to come. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, jeez.  He probably just says something unsexy.  Now.  Move.  Code word, yeah.  Yeah.  How was Pop's Father's Day?  You guys do it upright?  A little barbecue or something?  Yeah.  The same Father's Day for the last 29 years.  Exactly.  Really?  Same routine.  We were over there.  You know, he'd barbecues.  Right.  I'd fix his computer.  Right.  Oh, that's nice.  You know.  You have to erase his history.  How do I get rid of these pictures? 
[00:48:00]  Don't open that.  Don't open that.  Yeah.  Don't tell your mom, bud.  I really need some help here today, Sam.  Look at this cash thing.  That's really dangerous to have.  Look, I don't need you asking a whole bunch of questions.  Yeah.  I love it.  A lot of...  I respect the Boy Scouts.  That's all you need to know.  Well, your mom's in the kitchen baking cookies.  Could you join me in the study?  This is going to be between me and you.  Oh, yeah.  I made a delicious chocolate cake.  I got myself in a situation, young Sam, and I really need your help. 
[00:48:30]  I joined a site with my credit card that I probably shouldn't have.  I'd appreciate you don't say anything to your mom.  My dad used to do that.  What?  Not the computer thing.  But he would give me shit that...  And he goes, don't tell your mom.  But it was horrific medical news he was getting.  Yeah.  He goes, I don't know.  I don't really know if I have much time.  But don't tell your mom.  Oh, God.  Jesus, Dad.  What the fuck?  That's kind of morbid, yeah.  Don't tell your mom, but the results came back. 
[00:49:00]  And the prostate's not doing too good right now.  The fuck are they doing outside Fox today?  I don't know.  There's always shenanigans going on out there.  Dumb shit going on out there.  Are they going to...  Oh, man.  They better not have the hosts do this.  Oh.  Oh, we're going to exercise.  They look like they're using romper stompers.  Oh, I get it.  Oh, Ira?  Do you know what?  You guys weren't here Friday, so I couldn't tell you.  But do you know what to start?  Yes, I was.  Well, Jimmy was.  Who ended up doing the show Friday?  I love that.  Jimmy and Bobby.  It's rules. 
[00:49:30]  Me and Bob Kelly.  We're just going to do a little while.  So let me just come in and do it.  Right.  Days like that are when, like, hey, when I go away.  And now I make up for a day that I've been away.  Nothing wrong with it.  There you go.  I say we do more of that.  Yeah.  Who else was it?  That's great.  Just me, Bobby.  Do we have anybody else in?  No.  It was fun.  I'm just hanging out going, fuck, the show's running.  It's so nice.  We get credit for it in the end.  I guess I was arrested Friday.  That's what happened.  Just some computer shenanigans.  Something on the hard drive.  Sorry, so Dan couldn't make it in. 
[00:50:00]  Something happened.  I'm amazed every time on Twitter.  People are like, what happened, Anthony?  Like, but really?  But at least that's cool.  My asshole.  What was wrong with my asshole this time?  It's always Opie's asshole.  What was wrong with it this time?  But he was arrested for kiddie porn.  I'll take the sore asshole over the kiddie porn bus.  I don't know.  They're both pretty brutal.  You talk about, like, the fans not getting it.  We turned off the mics at the end of the show, and Bob Kelly looks at Jim and goes,  Really, dude?  What happened?  Oh, God.  Bobby. 
[00:50:30]  Jesus.  It's every time someone's out, Jimmy has a story.  Yeah.  We're going to be the first franchised radio show in history.  Yep.  Fuck yeah, you know.  Yeah.  There's some Kentucky Fried Chicken dude that just sits back, does nothing, and fucking  Exactly.  Let's the colonel do the talking.  Gets a shitload of money, right?  Yeah.  I say we go down that road.  I hear ya.  Keep your name going, and we'll just be fucking lounging on a beach somewhere.  Lounging.  Fuck yeah.  Lounging.  There's something else I want to ask you about your dad, but it'll come to me, I guess. 
[00:51:00]  Ah, there was something.  Ah, damn it.  Wonderful desserts, barbecues, corn on the cob.  Oh.  You know, it was great.  Nice.  Sounds it.  Mmm.  All right.  What's up?  I think we're running out of energy.  We'll take a break.  I just, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Make love.  I thought it was a great first hour, and ah.  Ah, well, ah.  Let's not forget about the podcast. 
[00:51:30]  We didn't really promote it last week.  I think it's a really good podcast, too.  Great podcast.  You've got the Ozzy with the whole birthday thing that Jimmy did, the 18 pounds of books  that Ozzy left behind.  That's on the podcast.  Who doesn't love that one?  The whole saga of that.  Me.  What else is on there?  Oh.  God Gooden trying to squeeze a word in edgewise.  Oh.  David Lee.  That's great.  No, what was the old bit?  That's what I was trying to remember.  The old bit was Jim and Ozzy.  Oh, you're right.  What was the other?  What's the third bit?  Oh, and it wasn't a Brewer versus Anthony. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, right.  Okay.  Right, right, right, right, right.  And then, of course, the O.P.  Anthony Nuggets.  Yeah.  A Nugget.  Yeah.  We're heading toward a brand new podcast.  Every Wednesday, the podcast goes up.  Right.  Give you a little hour or so.  And someone has to say it's not a podcast because we're playing old material.  It's like, what do you want from us in the end?  We're not allowed to do a fucking different hour.  Where are you dopes?  Where are you dope out there?  Right.  Exactly.  So we know that there's people out there that can't afford this anymore.  And it's also an excuse to get some older bits out there and highlight some of the better bits of the week. 
[00:52:30]  I think it's great.  I think it's perfect.  Yeah.  How we're doing it so far.  So go and get the latest O.P.  and Anthony podcast.  Yes.  In all the usual places.  iTunes and...  Oh, yeah.  Subscribe and leave a review.  That's all you gotta do.  Right.  A good review, damn it.  And I use BeyondPod because I get tweets about that every fucking day.  So easy.  I hate when people give a bad review and it's like, I couldn't get it to work on my computer. 
[00:53:00]  It's like, fuck it.  That isn't a review.  Right.  That's like reviewing a movie in the movie theater when the film breaks.  And you're like, this movie sucked because the film broke.  You asshole.  By the way, this is the end.  I saw everyone tweeting about it.  They really enjoyed the movie.  Second place.  Well, I mean, it went up against The Man of Steel.  Right, of course.  Iraq, I saw you tweeted it.  Yeah, we went and saw it Saturday.  It was great.  Wasn't it great?  Yeah.  And is Danny McBride a pimp or what?  Yeah, he's amazing. 
[00:53:30]  When he's there, he disappears, comes back again.  It's fucking great in that movie.  And they used two Sabbath songs in it.  They used War Pigs.  Yeah, they remixed War Pigs in the middle of the movie.  And it worked perfectly.  What was the new one at the end?  I don't know.  End of the Beginning or something?  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's the first track off the new number one album.  Yeah, they play that during the credits.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Black Sabbath's the only band doing a rock album these days.  Yeah.  Who else is in the rock category? 
[00:54:00]  It's the number one album in Britain and in the U.S.  Wow.  Who the fuck is their first number one album since 1970?  That's amazing.  I'm very happy for them, yeah.  Damn.  Poor Bill Ward.  I want to hug him.  Aw.  To not be a part of it?  Yeah.  It's going to suck.  You're a part of it.  Yeah, you know.  Go to the gym?  Go to the gym.  I'm going to hum.  Eatin' better.  Eatin' better, go to the gym.  I'm going to eat.  I wish I was humming on the album.  I wish I had some kind of a part of it.  Humming.  Yeah, I was just like the humming section.  A little tambourine playing. 
[00:54:30]  I'm very happy for those guys.  Yeah, we'll break and then we're going to play the audio of Miss Utah next.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  The Opie and Anthony Show will return in a moment.  After all, millions have to piss, too.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On SiriusXM.  Well, it's time to bring it down a bit.  Yeah, making plans with Jim and Tom. 
[00:55:00]  You going to stick around for the Sunday show?  You know what?  Everybody got there on the day.  Sunday is the day of the Lord.  You got to pay your rest?  I don't like to work on the Lord today.  If the Lord don't work, I don't work.  So I fly casual.  I fly casual on Sunday.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm going to come home and relax and praise his name.  You best have a good show.  It's going to be a third-year anniversary down there.  Go home now. 
[00:55:30]  I do believe we will be going to that show.  It's fun.  Lordy, it's hot today.  Yeah.  Why are you going to be gone today?  Gone.  Yeah.  Calling in to your favorite radio show can be one of the funniest experiences there is.  Boys, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir. 
[00:56:00]  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey, hey.  I'm trying to keep it nice.  Yeah.  Of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level. 
[00:56:30]  And I wanted to plug, too.  It's Scottsdale.  Yes.  Tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan.  Only the good place is for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together.  It's bad you didn't have a beach holiday.  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage. 
[00:57:00]  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello?  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  What?  Where are you?  I got you?  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:57:30]  What happens?  What happens?  Love, love, love.  We should do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on.  We should do a montage of the first things of the first thing when these mics go on.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Make sure all the tones are there. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, you got to feel it out.  Make sure all the tones are there.  Yeah, you got to feel it out.  Get some lows, get some highs.  Get some lows, get some highs.  Get some lows  Get some highs  Get some lows  Get some highs  Noises

[00:59:00]  Let's do it  How we doin' this morning  Let's do it  Let's do it  Noises  Let's do it

[01:01:00]  Oh boy  Our pal  We haven't heard from him  From him in a while  Wonder why  Why?  We were nice to him  He was a delight  No actually that whole  Production piece we just played  Was  A warning to not call into the show  No we smoothed it over though  Remember he came in  And we all got along  And then he asked us not to replay that 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  Because he might have said some things  Oh right  Some libelous or slanders  Whatever the spoken word is  He might have said some things  Oh yeah  He was trying so hard to impress you guys  Right  That he might have gotten himself  In a little legal trouble  Maybe  A bit of a pickle  But we kind of need that audio  To bring it all together  Yeah  But he begged us  He said please don't fucking play it  62 today right  I'm sure it's been enough time now  We can play it  Is this new kid  Born yet?  Didn't he like lay that on us too? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah  Or was that off air?  Oh my god  Was that off air?  Yeah  Was that off air?  Could have been off air  I'm not sure  I don't know now  Oh  He might have got another girl pregnant  So he's starting all over again  At 62  I love Joe Piscopo  Joe loves planting his seed  Oh he does  He does  Loves it  Does he ever  He's not pulling out Sam Roberts  No he's not  He's not spraying  No he likes to come deep  Joe's an ass cheek hugger  He likes to reach under and grab an ass cheek  And pump seed in  Joe likes fertility 
[01:02:30]  Yeah  Nice  Good for Joe  Yeah  This is where you know it's a problem  Yeah  His Father's Day  Thank you  Was just this broad  He just wrote on Twitter  To all my children  Thank you for the honor of being your father  And to dedicated dads everywhere  Happy Father's Day  Oh boy  It's not very personal  There's way too many of you  Yeah  Hey to all the kids

[01:06:30]  Oh please  Yeah  The intro's important  Look I think the reason  Piscopo begged us  And called us  Uh huh  After his appearance  And said please don't ever replay that  Yeah  Was because of Kimberly losing her fucking mind  Hey it's a video on YouTube  Or he was thinking that she would lose her mind  No I'm talking about the stuff he talked about  Oh that he was saying  Yeah perhaps  Because you know you fast forward a bunch of years  This whole Kimberly song  Yeah  He regrets the day he wrote this and performed this  Of course he does  You don't have a professional love for someone in music and video 
[01:07:00]  Right  And then they fuck you over in divorce court  Right  And you look back at that like  Ugh what was I an asshole  Yeah he's going through some ugliness with Kimberly  Yeah  But back in the day you know  They were in love  And he wrote a song about it  Uh huh  And Jimmy wants to hear a little piece of this  Yeah I love it  It's delightful  I want to hear the build up to it too  It was a good one  You know  I wonder why Joe never ages  He's in that thing the whole time

People say it's so wrong  But it feels so right  I like that part  Child bluster say  Who's saying it  Nambla's fucking  Who's saying it's wrong?  Anybody with ears  It's their catchphrase  Cause it was the babysitter thing  It was that why  It's saying it's so bad  It's so wrong  Right  People are like what the fuck you doing 
[01:20:00]  Blowing off your wife for the babysitter  But he's basically saying  No man it's true love  This is true love  It's gonna last forever  Right  What do we got now that Sam's laughing at?  Oh no  What is this?  Sam doesn't laugh at much  But what he does  He loves Joe  He's all in  Look he starts crying  He's a big Joe Piscopo fan  Joe Piscopo gets me going  Since the 80's  Since I'm a little boy  Of course  Good what is this?  This is uh  Oh we did the New Jersey song already  Right right  Well we also did Kimberly  Yeah we did  Can we hear the New Jersey song?  Let's hear a little of the intro  This is from the New Jersey Hall of Fame 
[01:20:30]  Wow  Yeah  Nice  Great pride  Gives me great pride to be here  In the hometown of my parents  In the greatest performing arts facility  In the whole world  The New Jersey Performing Arts Center  He just tries to be a nice guy  Always  I wanted to  If I may  Do a little tribute  To the greatest place  On planet earth  It's not good that he has to beg the audience  To stay with him  Before he performs these songs  I'm just a Jersey boy 
[01:21:00]  Boo  You got a boo on that one  I'm just a Jersey boy  Born and raised in the Garden State  Be more funny  He gave the turnpike to the parkway  West on 78  People ask  Are you from Jersey?  Will I tell them it's the only place to be?  I don't care that no one gets it when they ask me 
[01:21:30]  What exit?  New Jersey's hope to me  Okay  Will I drive the official car at Jersey  Long and shiny black  O-M-G  Gold trim  Landale roof  It's a big black Cadillac  The music is Sinatra  Bon Jovi and Springsteen  And everyone knows that the Sopranos 
[01:22:00]  Are only make-believe  This is the most shoehorning  Hilarious  Shoehorning  That is funny  He does these impersonations  I swear you would think of his real people  I don't care that no one gets it when they ask me  What exit?  New Jersey's hope to be  Now there's so many jokes about Jersey  I've told some of them a few more 
[01:22:30]  About toxic landfills and oil spills  And syringes on the shore  But the truth about New Jersey  That'll keep you coming back  Well it's the people that are great in the Garden State  Whether it's Italian, Jewish, Portuguese, Latino, Polish, Indian, Greek, Pakistani, Asian, Irish, or black  Okay  Alright  This is fucking great  What's he doing? 
[01:23:00]  Are you from Jersey?  Will I tell them it's the only place to be  I don't care that no one gets it when they ask me  What exit?  Do you relate to this?  Being from Jersey  Fucking hilarious  Yeah  I love you Jersey  Yeah  I love you too Joe  And then a smattering 
[01:23:30]  Yeah  Smattering  And then a smattering applause  Polite applause  Just a smattering  I've heard louder applause at backyard badminton games  A bit of a smidge  Yeah  Of applause  The cruelty of it all really gets me going  Oh it does  But he's so not aware  We have called him multiple times  To him he just sang Rosalita  He just sang Rosalita to everybody  Oh yeah that was going to be the B-side to fucking 
[01:24:00]  No in his mind that was his Rosalita  All right let's call him again  What's going on?  Oh  Why did we stop calling him for his birthday?  We just did  He's not answering  Did you leave a message?  Of course  How many times have you called?  And Rowan's texting him  Maybe he doesn't want anything to do with us  He loves us  That would suck  Maybe  We love him  We love the guy  Maybe you could reach out on his Twitter  Yeah maybe you could  Yeah  Hey what's  By the way  What is the name of the song Greg Brady sings at this 
[01:24:30]  What is the big one  There was a  What?  The Greg Brady song  That he sings at Branson  Yeah  We did it  I know  I don't remember what it was called  On the real Greg Brady  That one  Well no I don't think that's it  It's more of a you know he's rocking  At the 70's music celebration  Yeah that is a good one  Why are we going after our old friends  I don't want to make fun of him  I think it's great  I just want to see a minute of it  Because I really enjoy him  And I think his work is very good  Look I got his phone number  But someone else has to talk to him  No calling Barry Williams 
[01:25:00]  Let's give him a call  Come on  Let's just see what he's doing  No no  I'm too scared  Is that it?  Is there a  Oh yeah  Yeah he's on stage  Here he is  He's got a jacket over his shoulder  Look at the many  Multi-talented  This is a montage though right? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  It's a montage of the show he puts on  But he starts singing  Oh okay  Mass fire  I love it  Oh my god  This is an extravaganza  It's a celebration  Yeah yeah  Choreography and everything  It's great  When the foggy started to explode  Here we go 
[01:26:00]  Somebody said  Burn, baby, burn  Just going for a little  Burn, baby, burn  Call now for tickets  All those kids that are performing with him  Are all kids that had to call their parents  And say  No I did  You always said I wouldn't  But I got a job in theater  I'm in theater  I'm in Branson, Missouri  Barry Williams  Remember Barry Williams?  Barry Williams is doing  Greg Brady  Yeah yeah yeah  I'm doing the 70's music celebration  Out there in Branson  Hello  Burn, baby, burn 
[01:26:30]  That is  You must have  100 stories  And he sings it over the top  You like that?  Oh he is way over the top  And he had like a jacket slung over his shoulder  Sure  Holding it with like one finger  And he's kind of dancing around  Like he's just a man about talent  Yeah  He is good  He ain't fucking a talent  We have to go to that show  Triple threat  We got to see that  And we got to see Yakov  I think he's done  Yakov might not be there  Yeah I think Yakov might be done 
[01:27:00]  Now they do still have the Yakov dinner adventure  Do you want to go there?  But I don't think  Why isn't he there anymore?  He retired  Did he have an understudy or something?  It was an understudy?  Maybe  He couldn't have been there every night  I'm sure people had reservations  Showed up and he was like  I'm feeling a little sick today  And then you know  They have an understudy  I'm sure  Or something  Please make sure that that's not true  I think it is true  How old is he?  He went on tour  He's taken a tour of the country  And he's not going to be at Yakov's dinner 
[01:27:30]  Well can we see him on tour?  I don't know  I don't know  Are we still planning on broadcasting the Branson show on the bus tour  Out of Greg Brady's driveway unannounced?  Well that's without Greg Brady's knowledge right?  Right right right  Yeah that'll be a problem I'm sure  Yeah?  I'm positive  Yeah  He can come do the show if he wants  But what does this have to do with Joe Piscopo?  Good question  It's his birthday  Not Barry Williams  You're right  And everyone sent me pictures  And said you know  Kimberly used to be hot 
[01:28:00]  Yeah  Yeah  That's not what it's about  It's not about it at all  Right  Of course she was hot  It's about what she did to him  Fucking  Many years later  Fell head over heels in love with her  Because she was hot  Right  And now he's fallen in love with somebody else  And is giving that woman a baby  At 62  Oh my god  Yeah  He rules  His cum has running shoes on  He's fucking Piscopo as an animal  Wow  Big heavy cock  He's just got a fucking horse cock 
[01:28:30]  Dude he's got a horse  A heavy horse cock  It looks  His dick always  Like fresh out of his shower  Looks like mine does  When it's three quarters  Just a heavy horse dick  Just a heavy fucking horse dick  Oh and does he love impregnating women with it  Dude he can't do anything  But take that fucking  That giant well lubricated  Head and shove in  Doesn't he have like 30 year olds  Yeah  I'm sure he does  Yeah  I think so  Yeah  Uh huh  Now did we confirm whether or not  He told us on the air or off the air  That he said  I don't know  I'm a little worried  I'm not really sure  How are they going to keep that from people 
[01:29:00]  But I'm not sure  The way the paparazzi swarms Joe Piscopo on a daily basis  Exactly  It's like the Kardashians  Right  You know she has a baby  Everybody knows  Joe Piscopo's fucking lay down  Has a baby  Did she have the baby a month early?  Is that true?  Yeah  Yeah it is  Uh  They induced huh?  I don't know  A lot of these Hollywood women  They induce early  So it doesn't fuck up their bodies  So they don't stretch out too much?  Really?  Or they think it's going to fuck up their bodies  That sounds like a great thing to do  But she already fucked up her body 
[01:29:30]  She was enormous  Oh yeah  For a pregnant woman  She was fucking huge  Oh yeah  Not supposed to get that big  You think she's going to be able to snap back?  No  She doesn't have the body type  She doesn't have the discipline to go through the  You know  Through the workouts  Yeah  No of course not  You think Paris Hilton hates that she's that famous?  Yeah  Yeah it looks like they don't really get along anymore  Oh boy  She's way more famous than Paris  She is right?  Yeah  Yeah  What a rapid cunt Paris was 
[01:30:00]  Oh yeah  She's a beautiful baby daughter  Huh?  Is that what they have?  Yeah  Beautiful baby girl  This was the big news in entertainment  Trending everywhere, right?  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Big whoop-dee-doo  Are they already whoring the kid out?  Big whoop-dee-doo  No  They're waiting for the offers  Who says that?  Big whoop-dee-doo  My fucking ass  How old are you?  Big whoop-dee-doo  Said without a hint of irony 
[01:30:30]  Yes  You're an asshole  No they're waiting for the magazines to come through with their offers  Is that it?  With their offers  For pictures and stuff  That picture's worth at least a mil  Before they dress it in a bikini and throw it out there  At least a million, right?  Mm-hmm  How many mil?  Maybe close to five, you think?  Yeah, I think so  Really?  This is probably  A baby picture is worth five million dollars in her world  Why does anyone care? 
[01:31:00]  Like who gives a fuck?  Oh, it's crazy  Why does she have fucking ten million Twitter followers or whatever the fuck it is?  I can't believe it  What's the little kid called?  I don't think they've said what the name is  Wow  Even that  And Chloe told me that they were not going to have the baby on the show  Oh, sure they won't  Why wouldn't you?  Until you get one little dip in the ratings  They do everything else  Yeezy doesn't want the baby on the show  From what I hear  Who?  Yeezy  Who's Yeezy?  Kanye  Why is he called Yeezy?  He could be  Yay  He could be the biggest douche out there, that guy 
[01:31:30]  He makes it really tough  He's hateable  It's like you try to like him  He's beyond hateable  And there's just something about him  He's such a graceless baby  And it's like  I don't want to dislike him  Because he's talented  But what a fucking baby  Yeah  His music is really good  And he makes it really difficult  He's hateable  He really is  Yeah, I told you  My manager was at that fucking garden thing backstage  He said Kanye was going over  And they were going nuts  He went way too  I wasn't supposed to go that long  Right  It's hateable  Yeah  By the way, I just checked my Twitter  Stevie Knight 
[01:32:00]  Who's a definite regular to this radio show  As a listener  He tweeted all of us and said  I don't remember Joe mentioning the new baby on air at all  Whoops  Happy birthday, Joey  Happy 62nd  I don't know  The oopsie column  I don't know  He mentioned it, right?  Sure, at some point  I'm trying to think  Oh, fuck  Maybe not  What if it was preceded by 
[01:32:30]  Hey, keep this between us guys, alright?  I don't know, man  Sometimes, you know  You're in here  And you don't know if the mics are on or not  That's true  It's very hard to remember  If something was on or off air  Such a conversational show  That it's like  Yes, yes  It's really not your fault  Oh, boy  For the record, I really thought he said it on the air  I'm not really sure anymore, though  Sam's crying  I'm not sure either  Sam sits here stone-faced  A lot of the times 
[01:33:00]  While we're all laughing  But man, when he finds something funny  Why do you find this so funny?  Such a bummer for him  No, the whole thing you find ridiculously funny  Well, it's just so cruel  Is it the lack of self-awareness when he's singing his songs?  Yeah, it's every element  It's like, it's the meanness of the whole thing  He really thought his whole TV audience was really like  Oh, yes, Joe  We need to hear the Kimberly song  And then the fact that this can just go on and on and on and on  Because of the lack of self-awareness 
[01:33:30]  You know what I mean?  Because Joe is like  Oh, we're all in on the joke together  And it's like  No, Joe  Don't let them make fun of you  Stop it  Why would you come into the studio like you're friends?  Oh, that part  He spent an hour and a half tearing apart  But I feel like we are friends with Joe Pissler  Yeah, I'd like him  We met him back in the day at N.E.W.  Yeah, so he did  He popped his head in  Yeah, but like  He popped his head into your show  Yeah  You know, 12 years ago  And that gives you carte blanche to tear apart everything he's ever done 
[01:34:00]  It's not everything  It's just  I don't know  Like that show  It all started with the show that was on what?  HBO  Oh, showtime  Oh, boy  Anthony was the one  Who started this, by the way  I woke up out of a dead sleep  Opened one eye  Saw it was on  And within seconds  I could not take my eyes off of it  Couldn't go back to sleep  Had to watch the whole thing  I didn't know what it was  And he's sitting there going  Yeah, Ant said he loved it  I don't know what  I don't know what  He couldn't turn it off 
[01:34:30]  Couldn't turn it off  Yeah, that's true  Alright, now a lot of people are saying he did mention it on the air  He did say it on the air  Alright, I feel better  Good  I really do  Because he's given us so much  So I don't want to blow up his spot  Don't say he's given us so much  He's given us so much  Thanks to Anthony  Waking up in the middle of the night  You've taken so much from him  He hasn't given you that much at all  You've robbed him  Of his dignity  Of his pride  You know, all that stuff  Is stuff that you took 
[01:35:00]  He didn't give that to you  Yeah  Your bit  Oh, they're doing the  Your bit  They have the news people doing the  Yeah  The little  They're doing kind of a  Look, he even has an army hat on  Even though he's still wearing a tie  Because he's got to do the army workout  It's your bit  Where they have to get involved  Yes, they always have to get involved  With the shenanigans  I see these assholes in the park  It's like  It's not good enough to go to a gym  Or get a regular trainer  You join, quote, boot camp 
[01:35:30]  And I see these guys  Yelling and screaming at  Like, fucking soccer moms  In Central Park  Just yelling at them  Like  Like  Yeah, like they're in basic training  It's like  Yeah  Look, they're just  Trying to get back  They're just trying to get in shape  Yeah  And you're yelling at them?  Supposedly works, though  Like, those boot camp things  Like, people I know go to them  And they say  If you go through the program  And they're amazing  But I just  I couldn't get yelled at like that  I'd be like  Stop yelling, I'm trying  Thank you, yes  That's how I would be  But they want to  A lot of these moms  That's what they want  They need someone to scream at them  You think they get a little moist? 
[01:36:00]  Of course they do  When they're getting yelled at?  Exactly  And told to run the steps  In Central Park?  You know what their nickname  For each other is?  We're members of the Wet Cunt Brigade  Ooh  So yeah, where's the steps  In Central Park?

I don't know  This is a lovely song  It could  Could it be magic?  Could it be magic?  It had the big intro  I think a big musical intro  Yeah  Let me hear it  This is like his epic fucking song 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  Yeah  I remember  Barely  I was very, very young  In the mid to late 70s  Before I became a child  Of course I picture you  It's weird  I'm like, holy fuck  I photographed a lot older  Oh, okay  Yeah  But I remember these were on the radio all the time  Barry Manilow  They were staples?  Oh, I know this one, sure  And this is like a classical piece 
[01:48:00]  Sometimes you should clear up that you're not at a Barry Manilow concert  Well  Oh, that's right  Ooh, talk about embarrassing  Yeah, humiliating  That's what I do  I just  It's one long act of humiliation  My life  Broken up by moments of victory  A lot of it's revolved around Ozzy, too  All of it  Your embarrassing moments  Yes  This is a really long intro  It's a hugely long intro  He was doing his Elton John thing  What year is this?  His Elton John thing  Well, I mean, listen to him  Yeah  What is this? 
[01:48:30]  The answer's two and a half  Did he play the piano?  I don't even know  Oh, God, yeah  Yeah, yeah  Yeah  It's one of those guys  He sings behind the piano  Yeah  Remember this?  Every time I'm near you  I don't remember this one  Whirling like a cyclone in my mind  Oh, jeez  Wait, where's the hook?

Yes  He texted Roland  He's going to be calling instantly  All right, let's take a break  We have to take a break  Oh, God  Why does he  Why?  I'm even saying  Why is he doing this?  All he has to do  Is not answer  Is just ignore us  Just ignore us  He could be very excited  All right  You know, if he had just ignored it like 
[01:49:30]  Now  It was already forgotten about  Right, right, right  We even moved on  Finally  We finally moved on  Barry Manilow  We were about Barry Manilow  We were going to beat him up for a while  All right  When we get back  Joe Piscopo will be on our phone  We'll return after these messages  We guys are back from the toilet  And now, back to our show  Jimmy, very good news 
[01:50:00]  Dennis Falcone is walking down the hallway  Excellent  I know you're a big fan of Dennis Falcone  Probably the biggest  He's different every time he's on  I can't get enough of him  Ah, there he is  We've got to kill a few minutes  Because we've got a phone call  Scheduled with Joe Piscopo  For 8.35  A mere 10 minutes from right now  We will have the great 
[01:50:30]  Jersey's own  Yeah  The great and Jersey's own  Joe Piscopo  Jersey Joe Piscopo  Who's celebrating his 62nd birthday today  So we figured it was up to us  To give him a call  And wish him a very happy birthday  That's a good thing to do  For some reason, Dennis  Birthdays are very important with radio  Yes, they are  And how did that happen?  Why are birthdays so important?  That jocks feel compelled every day  To tell celebrities' birthdays  Or taking your requests 
[01:51:00]  And let us know if it's your birthday  What is that?  People like, if it's their birthday  It's more important than saying  It's Barry Manilow's birthday  Oh, it is  Or somebody like that  Now, when you're doing birthday wishes  For people  Do you go with the celebrities' birthdays first?  Or do you go with the people's birthdays?  Well, it's always good for a tie-in  Like if you have Barry Manilow  On your music log  You know, hey, happy birthday today  To Barry Manilow  Brooklyn Zone  Celebrating  And also  John Smith from Tulsa, Oklahoma  John called in  Does anybody give a shit, though? 
[01:51:30]  Like, I've never cared about anybody's birthday  Hey, it's Frank's birthday  It's fuck Frank  No, people like hearing their name on the air  Frank's birthday was better  Yeah, Frank cares  Maybe a couple of his family members  But the rest of us don't give a fuck  That it's Frank's birthday  No, but you know  The thing is  It would compel people to  Hey, let me send in, you know  My birthday  Hey, we got a birthday request  Going out to Bob in Massapequa  I was a music jock for a while there  And I just  I made up all that shit  You did?  You just made it up?  I made up the requests  The birthdays  Did you?  Yes! 
[01:52:00]  Everything  We had a whole segment of his show  Called the All Requests and Dedication Hour  He didn't take one request of dedication  I know  But then you do the laundry list  And every song was out to somebody  I would just like  Pull a name off the wall in a town  A Long Island town  Because it doesn't matter?  No, it doesn't matter in the end  That's just more busy work for the DJ  Busy work  What do you think of this practice?  I worked for a DJ named Scorch  In Syracuse  Right  And I witnessed  The Great Scorch  The Great Scorch  From Syracuse  The Scorch  And I witnessed multiple times 
[01:52:30]  Somebody would call up and say  Hey, Scorch, it's my birthday  Can I get a shout out?  And Scorch would respond  No, no, we don't do that  And they'd go  Yeah, we don't do that on this show  Why can't we do that?  And he wouldn't take the call on the air  He wouldn't acknowledge them  I really would do that  I guess he thought he was a little too soft  He's not doing the Pet Patrol  I mean, he's just announcing somebody's birthday  He wants to never acknowledge a birthday on the air  What's the Pet Patrol?  What's the Pet Patrol? 
[01:53:00]  This is an old one  I'm not kidding you  You know, radio stations  Local community radio stations would have  And we have a little lost dog  It's a black and white  Scotty goes by the name of the McTavish  And if you happen to see Scotty  Make sure you call, you know, the area code  They would have jingles and sounders for it  And sadly, you know, what happened over time  People, like school closings  It was, you know, a benchmark  Don't forget, coming up, Pet Patrol  Being brought to you by  Pet Patrol 
[01:53:30]  And it's sort of a public service  Exactly  Yeah, that doesn't bother me  What was the Pet Patrol jingle?  In different stations, what happened  Pet Patrol, Pet Patrol  You know, barking and, you know, cats meowing and stuff  Hopefully your dog isn't on the side of the road  It's Pet Patrol  Yeah, yeah  His little legs are broken  Maggot's calling in and out of his face  It's Pet Patrol  The only thing you loved is dead  With a tire track on its face  You know, like Pet Patrol, Jimmy 
[01:54:00]  Detest  No, but because it is kind of public service  So that doesn't bother me  Swap and shopper is always fun  Swap and shopper  None of this is fun  What is swap and shopper?  What could possibly be fun about that?  It was community service  It was like a penny saver on the air  Yeah, hi, this is Jimmy  And I'm selling a 1972 Chevy Vegas  Got 350,000 miles on it  And I'm looking for $600  Oh, okay  And you would call in  You would call in  But that's like fucking before the little flyers were out  Remember, you go to the supermarket  And they always be at the end of the 
[01:54:30]  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Well, okay  Swap and shopper  Penny saver  I'm selling a bag of zippers or something  People would sell me  What is a bag of zippers?  I noticed you got an empty clipboard today, Danny  I was just carrying around just in case  There's nothing on it yet  Just a while  The day is young  It's a long day ahead  Yeah, yeah  What have you learned about today so far?

Yeah, two of the original six teams  Bruins and Blackhawks  Doing a battle  What else?  You guys were saying it's Barry Manilow's birthday  Yes, yes  What a showman  You guys ever see Manilow?

Was it Copa Cabana? 
[01:55:30]  Copa Cabana, yeah  Was he famous before that?  Oh, yeah  1975, you know  He broke on the scene with Mandy  And Could It Be Magic?  Yeah  75 was a big  The mid to late 70s for Barry Manilow  Very big years  A breakthrough year  Yeah, a breakthrough year  He was on all the fucking variety shows  That were so popular in the 70s  Be out there with the piano  And Charo would come out  Oh, Jesus  We just found a picture of Barry Manilow  With a t-shirt  That says, I love Beagles  Oh, that's cute

One of our old friends  He does  Swears that he fucked Barry Manilow in the ass  Yeah  I wouldn't know about that  Might want to put that on your clipboard  That's not really one of the fun facts today  Might want to, you know  70s on 7  Might, you know  Play some Barry  And it's his birthday  And you might want to tell the people  And we said  Tippy Tom  That's just crazy  You can't say that  And he said  That he had a Beagle named Bagel 
[01:56:30]  He had a Beagle  His name was Bagel  Bagel the Beagle  And I guess he had to walk the dog  In between fucking him  Yeah  In between fucking Barry Manilow  He had to walk the Beagle  Poor little Bagel  Had to fucking lick up the cream pie  Dripping out of fucking Barry's ass  This guy swears  We don't know  Yeah, this is stuff  You don't find this on the  Tippy Tom is a gay homeless  It was  God rest his soul  A gay homeless man with AIDS  So that's  Yeah, yeah  And Barry  Apparently took a man at some point 
[01:57:00]  In his life  And they were  They were lovers  Hey, you know what?  A nice song for you guys to play  When you open up your show  Why are you blowing off the  Date break?

[01:58:30]  The one with the plague episode  You know  That was a big two-parter I think  Paul Ingalls had to go to the town  Where there was a big plague going on  And it turned out  Some shyster fucking grain salesman  Sold grain that had rats in it  Rat grain  Yeah  That's a good one  Were they alive or dead?  They were what?  The rats?  They were alive and dead  You know  But they just kind of  Threw the rats out  And put the grain  And sold it anyway  And gave this whole fucking place  The plague  Oh really?  Yeah it was a crazy episode  But Paul made everything okay  Oh good  Like he always did 
[01:59:00]  How?  He kind of smiled  Read a little scripture  Pointed at his asshole  And yelled ouch  Getting some of the coffee enema  Natural holistic fucking medicine  So you're telling me  With all the ladies  That you've dated  Over your lifetime  You've never gone to  A Barry Mallow concert  Which one?

[02:44:30]  Oh, shit  It's the middle of the fucking morning radio shift  How about you come in at 6 or 6.30 and do that  9.30  That's when everyone gets to work  It's everyone here  It's the worst time  Bathroom closed  They got that sign up  I fucking hate  Oh, get a guy to clean it  Get a guy to clean the fucking men's room  So I can go in there and piss  Without running up the steps  Gotta get back on the air  I wanna piss  Gotta run up the steps  To another floor  And they have part of the lobby blocked off  Because they were doing remodeling  Why wouldn't they?  What do you mean they're remodeling? 
[02:45:00]  Remember the wall that had McCartney  And Paul Simon's signature?  Yes  They cut the actual concrete off the wall  Okay  Why?  To save the signatures  To save it  But they already had plexiglass over it  Well, they cut the  They took the plexiglass off  Cut into the wall  To save that part of the wall  And then they were redoing the wall  Where'd they put the wall?  How much is that costing?  It's a wall  It's gotta be half a million bucks  No kidding  Yeah, that's funny  Yeah  They do the weirdest shit around here  They don't mind doing that  But they can't knock the hole in the studio  Right, right 
[02:45:30]  But they'll cut Paul McCartney's signature out of it  Good call  Right  Fuck it  Get a guy to clean the fucking men's room  So I can go in there and piss  That's true  That's the new thing  For the guy  They do it around this time every day  Enraging  So I didn't even notice  Did they cut that already?  They were doing it on Friday  Where'd they put the actual good signature?  Who knows  They took two parts of the wall  One had Paul McCartney  And the other one had  Paul Simon and somebody else  Keith Richards  Was it sheetrock or cement?  No, it was cement  I'm sending a photo 
[02:46:00]  They cut cement out of the wall?  No, it was sheetrock  It had to be sheetrock  That's cement  That didn't look like sheetrock  It's sheetrock  It had to be sheetrock  How do you know?  I know it is  Because we know sheetrock  I've touched it  Is that cement?  He's got rock in his name though  I know  That's right  And sheet in his work ethic  That was good  It was sheetrock  It's sheetrock  Everyone knows it is  Fucking dummy  It was titanium  No, it wasn't  Titanium  So they cut out the sheetrock 
[02:46:30]  With Paul McCartney's autograph on it  Yeah  That's real fame right there  Yep  What are they going to do  Yeah  They were always upset  That he had signed the column  Why?  Because they wanted him  To sign a plastic thing  But they hadn't put up  A plastic thing yet  But why would you want  Paul McCartney signing  A plastic thing  With everyone else?  Half those names  On that plastic thing  Are nobody's now  Well they probably  Would have taken his down immediately  Or taken his section  I think it's cooler  That he signed the column  And now they're  Removing the column  But how are you going to  Remove a piece of concrete? 
[02:47:00]  They did it  That's sheetrock  Exactly  Oh, gotcha  Oh  Concrete  Sheetrock  E-rock  Sheetrock  Sheetrock  Sheetcake  Sheetcake  Sheetcake  Sheetcake  Rock candy  Slobo  Slobo  You said it  Oh boy  I feel bad  I came up with that one  That one really  Took off like wildfire  Sticking  Well Roland really sold it  Oh yeah  Roland sells

[03:19:30]  How did we get here?  Yeah, right to cuckolding.  All roads lead to cuckolding.  That's the name of my life story in my book.  All right, Kenny's going to shit down there in my truck waiting to get a ticket.  He gets very nervous now.  Yeah.  Ew.  He'll shit in my truck.  Well, ever since he got that ticket, because my truck used to be waiting for me.  I felt like a king.  I'd go downstairs, truck's waiting.  Now, he don't like pulling the truck up because the traffic guys are just cocksuckers. 
[03:20:00]  They walk right up to the registration and go, bam, and just instantly put it in their computer before anyone could say anything.  And Kenny's like, hey, what are you doing?  I'm there, you know, and he wants to get some cards out there and stuff.  Hi.  Hi.  Who are they?  Oh, hello there.  Oh, hey there.  How are you?  I ordered a delivery.  Is it bring your daughter to work day?  Hello.  Yay.  Oh, she's very cute.  Right here.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Yeah, so then Kenny freaks out now, and he won't really get my truck until I'm ready to go. 
[03:20:30]  I know this is all very fascinating, but I've got to get down there.  So, Mrs. Nagel, a pleasure seeing you.  You too.  Again, you're looking very lovely.  Thank you.  Mr. Nagel.  You're looking.  Stay tuned for the Eric Roberts show.  Oh, yes.  Jimmy Dornan.  Eric Roberts show.  Exactly.  Eric Roberts.  Exactly.  What is the Eric Roberts for?  Because you wish he was sitting there, as do I.  That is true.  That would be good.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:21:00]  Charlie!  They took my nickel-flicking foot, Charlie.  I flipped a nickel, Charlie.  It was a quarter.  Oh, was it?  Of course.  Give him the credit.  Amy Schumer will be here tomorrow, and we added a comedy show.  We're doing Saturday, July 20th.  The first show is totally sold out.  A 10 p.m. show has been added with Amy, myself, Artie, and David Tell in Bethlehem, PA, at the Sands Casino Resort.  Tickets on sale this Friday morning. 
[03:21:30]  So, buy them.  There you go.  Stay tuned for the Eric Hartman show.  Yeah.  Of course.  The Sam from Quincy show.  He's just going to discuss forensic evidence in a bland manner.  I love it.  All right, everybody.  Hostie Spumont.  The O.P. and Anthony show is available later today with SiriusXM on demand.  All right, you've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose. 
[03:22:00]  Head.  After O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next.  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After O.N.A. Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right.  After O.P. and Anthony Live, 866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number. 
[03:22:30]  Phone lines are open.  Sal is showing me photos.  Apparently, the new thing in basketball is to dress like a black hipster.  I'm not going to use it for you.  Well, you can use it if you want.  What'd you call that?  The niggsters.  I'm not going to say that.  That's horrible.  You're not saying the word.  Yeah, but you know what the root of that word is.  Yeah, but you're not saying it.  I'm not going to support it.  It's like just saying guh as opposed to gur.  No, I'm not going to support it.  I'm putting a star at the end of it.  It's completely different. 
[03:23:00]  Eric, you've been in radio a long time.  Is that a word I should get behind at all?  I want nothing to do with that word.  Me neither.  It's not bad.  It seems very, very bad.  Go ask Sway for me.  Go ask Sway.  I'll ask hookah, but not Sway.  Could you do that for me?  Could you just run into Sway's studio and ask if that's a cool word for you to use?  Look, Urban Dictionary, the most reliable source on the internet.  Okay, well, I bet I could figure out some other offensive words that are on Urban Dictionary, too.  Sam, you want to work in the future, right?  Of course I do.  Then stay away from it.  There is sort of a...  That hipster style, though, is definitely morphing into the hip-hop gear. 
[03:23:30]  You know what I mean?  Because I guess hip-hop is so used to...  They're always trying to be different.  And so what could be more different than dressing like white kids in Brooklyn, right?  Yeah.  Because it's a rule that you have to show up to the game.  You can't dress up wearing your pants around your ankles.  Oh, okay.  So this is all part of the dress code.  Yeah, so now they're kind of pushing the boundary of...  How do I maintain the dress code but still be cool?  Right.  And they're like, well, you can't have your pants sagging. 
[03:24:00]  And they're like, okay, well, I'm just going to wear capris then.  Yeah, yeah.  Dwayne Wade wears these fucking highwaters.  Dwayne Wade from the Miami Heat.  Yeah, capri pants.  Look at these fucking things.  Let me see.  Dwayne Wade walking...  Look at this shit, dude.  That's pretty cool.  And he's wearing a double-breasted jacket.  Okay, yeah.  Dwayne Wade is walking him around.  And he's wearing a double-breasted jacket.  He's got two buttons buttoned up.  He's got the white shirt under it with no tie.  And capri...  It's a matching suit.  But the pants are capris. 
[03:24:30]  Is that right?  I'm not incorrect there, am I?  He's wearing low socks and he's wearing dress shoes.  How does a guy like that pull it off?  I don't know.  He pulls it off, though.  Yeah, I don't know.  Look at this thing.  Sal, if you or I walked...  What the hell is he wearing there?  It's like a kid in play jacket.  Is that a floral print?  Yeah.  Can you make that a little bigger?  Sure.  That's flowers, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  Didn't Kim Kardashian get made fun of for wearing that while she was pregnant?  Yeah, I don't know.  But these guys can pull it off.  He can pull it off, though.  I don't know why.  They just can't.  It's accepted.  A lot of them wear the big, oversized, black-rimmed glasses that they don't need lenses in, pretty 
[03:25:00]  much, too.  And a half of them don't have lenses in them.  Yeah, Russell Westbrook wears glasses with no lenses.  He doesn't have lenses.  Yeah, he doesn't even try to hide it.  Oh, my God.  But there's something...  Like, if you or I, Sal, walked in here wearing a double-breasted suit with capris...  Okay, that's Dwayne Wade again, isn't it?  Yeah, that's Dwayne Wade.  He's wearing glasses with no lenses in them.  Those are just glasses frames.  Yeah, I don't know.  A lot of young black girls do that, too.  I don't know why.  Just frames.  Just frames. 
[03:25:30]  Just the frames.  I see it on the subway all the time.  There's Chris Brown wearing some frames.  That's Russell Westbrook.  That's not Chris Brown, Sam.  It looks like Chris Brown.  It's only half his face.  I couldn't see.  It's Kevin Durant doing it.  Yeah.  My God.  That's a weird thing.  If you or I came in dressed in, like, a double-breasted suit, you should try it.  Yeah?  I don't think I could pull it off.  I can't pull it off.  But I get made fun of just for wearing a dress shirt here.  Right.  But you at least have a little more hipster credibility than I do.  That's true.  And you're younger than I am, so it's like, you can come in and say, what are you talking 
[03:26:00]  about?  This is what we're all doing now.  Whereas if I did that, I'd be like, this is what we're all doing now.  And they'd be like, what?  All the 30-year-olds walking around are wearing capris?  And I'm like, well, Dwayne Wade is not a young man anymore.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  Maybe we need to...  These guys just have infinite amounts of money to spend.  We have wealthy basketball players first.  And they just fucking spend on the most stupid shit.  But you can get...  If you have enough money, you can get the stupidest clothes to fit perfectly.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, it looks like... 
[03:26:30]  They look like this is how these clothes should fit.  Yeah.  That's not what they should look like.  They should have about an extra quarter length of pant.  Yeah.  You know Walt Clyde Frazier, right?  Of course.  Yeah.  He kind of started the whole outlandishness of it.  And, I mean, he goes into, like, stores and he's like...  He says, what has no one bought here?  Right?  And that's what he buys.  That's what I was trying to tell you.  That's the thing.  That's what started.  Like, in hip-hop, everybody was wearing, like, you know, big, giant jeans that hung down below 
[03:27:00]  their ass and, like, a big hoodie or something.  And eventually, somebody, whoever wants to be on the cusp, has got to start wearing hipster  gear.  It's true.  Kanye West was wearing, like, you know, polo shirts back when everybody was still wearing sports  jerseys.  Yeah, that's very true.  Wasn't Outkast doing that, too?  Yeah.  Andre 3000?  Andre 3000 started wearing some weird shit.  So Kanye wore that fucking leather skirt.  Yeah, now he's wearing leather skirts.  No one's going to convert over to skirts.  I don't know.  It worked for Axl.  Yeah.  It worked for Axl Rose. 
[03:27:30]  And Diddy's butler was doing that for a while, too.  Farnsworth Bentley?  Farnsworth, yeah.  The whole thing changed when, like, you know, hip-hop is very homophobic.  Definitely.  But Lil Wayne showed up on the cover of some rap magazine wearing pink camo.  And everybody started, it was years ago.  And then it became okay.  Like, do you know what Lil Wayne wears now?  He wears, like, Bret Michaels.  That's what he wore on the cover of a magazine.  And everything was like, okay, now it's cool to wear pink and baby blue.  Now Lil Wayne goes on stage wearing Bret Michaels' old gear from the Poison days. 
[03:28:00]  He wears leggings and, like, leopard print leggings.  I don't know, man.  And yet, you have trouble because you're like, I don't want to say this is not cool because  I don't want to be out of touch.  Yeah.  But I don't think that's cool.  You know?  I'm pretty sure that this is not cool, but I can't say that yet.  It's Nickster, Sam.  That's what it is.  I'm not going to say that.  Why?  That's horrible.  If who came in here and gave me the pass on, I'm sure it'd be fine.  That's horrible.  Troy, you're not going to say that word that Sal keeps saying, are you? 
[03:28:30]  No.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  Good.  There's nothing bad with that word.  Because, but the connotation is also, there's like an ER in there.  It's just very racist and racial and...  I can't wait till we get over the point, though, where we can actually just, everybody just  say that.  Say those words.  That's not happening.  Eventually it will.  No, it won't.  Of course it will.  If anything, we can say less words than we used to be able to.  No.  Yes.  Eventually it's going to be fine for white people to say nigger.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely.  Absolutely not.  Guarantee it.  We have less words we can say now than we could ten years ago.  There's white kids getting away. 
[03:29:00]  Because everybody's saying it now.  And it's like, if you have Hispanic kids saying it...  Let me ask you this.  I hate that.  When you see a clearly Puerto Rican dude just dropping the M-bomb, it's like, dude...  Believe me, dude, I'm in the hood here in New York City.  There's a lot of white kids saying it around black kids.  Do you think that white people will be able to use that word before, like...  Because, like, you can't say...  People can't say retarded anymore without getting in trouble.  Yeah, but it's just...  Rappers are...  Everybody's still using the word nigga in rap.  But they always did.  Yeah, but...  So now it's just going to become...  No. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  It's going to happen.  We can't even say retarded.  That's...  That's retarded.  That's what I'm saying.  And watch out.  You're going to get yourself in trouble.  Nah.  Let me go to Jay.  What's up, Jay?  Alright, I need to give y'all a little bit of news from the black community.  Please do, Jay, because I'm in here with a bunch of white guys that are just trying  to find excuses to use the N-word, and I don't like it.  Well, yeah, anyway.  First of all, the way we're wearing that pantsuit, we clown him.  You do.  It's not working. 
[03:30:00]  He looks like he put Hillary Clinton's pantsuit on and went to a fucking game.  He does.  Yeah, he looks like those are Hillary Clinton's pants.  His calves are showing.  Yeah.  Second of all, all this hipster stuff that y'all are getting into now, we did back in  the late 80s, early 90s.  I'm an older cat than y'all.  I'm 36.  I'm around 60 Rocks age.  So, I got rocking the high top spades, the...  Tight Adidas jumpsuits?  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  Not that far back.  You're going back to Run DMC 86 days.  Talking about, like, Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool Jack, kind of like that late 90s, early 90s,  late 80s phase, where you wore, like, felize and...  So you're saying black people invented this hipster shit?  Look, look back, look back to, like, um, rock-based DJs, the rock, some of those styles, um, Kwame, how he dressed.  What do you think, Troy? 
[03:31:00]  How they dressed?  I mean, yeah.  I mean, that's, that, that was the, that was in the streets in the 80s.  But, I mean, it goes away and then it comes back.  Yeah.  You know, it has to reinvent itself.  And it's like...  I think, I think, uh, it seems like white kids brought it back and then black kids kind of adapted that.  It's like...  I will say that.  I will say that.  But, Ben, we own it.  I'm sorry, we own it because we didn't do it at first and y'all just picked it up and tried to run the ball.  Can I tell you the truth?  Yeah, but...  You guys are the ones that are making it look cool.  Yeah, but you know what? 
[03:31:30]  It's like, you own it.  Well, white people then own punk rock.  And that's all I see black people now is they have spikes all over their boots and all over their jackets.  It's like, okay, cool, then white people own that.  So give that back.  Lil Jon was in there.  How fucking stupid is that?  No white person can make that suit that LeBron James is wearing right now look cool.  You know what it is?  Honestly, you just, you have to own it.  You just, when you, when you go out with that, you just have to be like, I'm the shit.  It's like, I know it's hard to think about this now, but think back to when Kanye started rocking bow ties. 
[03:32:00]  That's what I was saying.  And how out of place he looked.  And everybody was like, that is so fucking stupid.  And now everybody still, like, I see so many black people rocking bow ties all the time.  Well, that's what I was saying, that he was wearing polo shirts when everybody was still wearing jerseys.  But that's how fashion happens.  You just have to be so far ridiculous that it becomes the trend.  Or you're one of the, you're in a picture in a magazine five years from now being like, look what he tried to make work.  That didn't happen.  But that happens all the time.  It's called, it's fashion risks, Troy.  It is.  It's fashion risks. 
[03:32:30]  It's being fashion forward.  It's being bold.  Yeah.  Quite frankly, it's being bold.  And you know, a lot of times in the rap community, people will see something.  They'll see Lil Wayne doing it or whoever doing it.  And then they will have to mimic it immediately.  Yeah.  And they don't think about it.  Is this going to work?  What's the future in it?  And that's probably what they're banking on.  Like guys who are like NBA players that are walking around with glasses with no lenses in them. 
[03:33:00]  They probably saw a rapper do it first.  Yeah.  One NBA player saw a rapper do it first.  Then the rest, then other basketball players are seeing those guys do it.  So they start wearing it.  And they're all banking on the fact that kids are just going to start doing it without thinking.  Yeah.  Like, please God.  And they will.  And it's like, there's pictures of Chris Brown and there's pictures of Kanye West with  leather coat on rocking like old punk rock patches.  Yeah, sure.  Like DRI patches.  Sure.  I guarantee if you ask Chris Brown, name one DRI song, he couldn't do it. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  I think the way I've been looking, I think you're actually exactly right.  It seems like the punk rock style is where like hip hop kind of borrowed a hipster.  And now they're starting to move towards punk rock.  Yeah.  But that's happened before.  Show Troy the Dwayne Wade suit.  Oh, Dwayne Wade.  Yeah.  I just tweeted it.  At Not Sam.  What do you think of this, Troy?  You're a bold fashion guy.  You're a bit of a fashionista.  That's a rough one.  It's a double breasted suit.  Okay.  The jacket is even longer than is really what's in style right now. 
[03:34:00]  And he's wearing capri pants.  And he's wearing like penny loafers, no socks.  You gotta be fat to pull off a double breasted suit too.  You gotta be fat?  Yeah.  You have to, you have to be fat to, to like fill it out better.  You don't look like a fucking idiot.  He's not a fat guy.  He's in great shape.  If you got money and it's tailored perfect and you just, you own it.  That's what I was saying.  And he's got like, probably got like $3,000 sunglasses on.  Yeah, these rich guys, you can make, you can get stupid clothes tailored to look like  they fit like they're supposed to, even though they're not even supposed to be worn. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, but you ever watch like fashion runway shows and shit?  No, I never watch fashion runway shows.  Some of those, some of those outfits are so far ridiculous, but that's what you have  to do in order to try to make something.  Sal, you ever watch fashion runway shows?  I mean, I've seen like photos and shit.  Like it's very, it's more conceptual.  It's like, this is a zipper with a fucking chicken hanging off it.  And it's like, oh, maybe some way we'll use this color palette.  Right.  Or like something will come off that that inspires the next whatever.  Yeah.  Joe in Texas. 
[03:35:00]  Hey, you want to know why Wade was wearing that?  He wore that outfit during the, the Bull Series.  He was dressed up as a matador.  You think so?  I mean, I guess they are matador pants, but that's a bit of a stretch.  It's probably from like 2009-ish.  And this is, this is Kanye West with all his boys in Paris.  How many layers do you need?  I don't know who the fuck this guy is, but he's wearing like leopard print leggings with  cowboy boots. 
[03:35:30]  Okay.  There's one guy in this picture that Sal pulled up.  These are Kanye West and his crew.  And one of them is an Asian guy.  I don't know how he got there, but it's Kanye West and his crew and they're hanging out  in Paris.  And yes, one of them is simply wearing women's clothing.  Like that is, those are leopard print leggings with cowboy boots that kind of, what's that  called?  Where they kind of arrow up at the top there.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those are just cowboy boots.  Like traditional slide on cowboy boots.  A green jacket that appears to have tails and some kind of checkered thing with a pocketbook. 
[03:36:00]  And he's got a man purse.  But you know what?  I appreciate what's going on in hip hop now because, you know, for so long it was literally  like, everybody rocked like the oversized Coogee shit.  Sure.  Everything was so like 5XL, too big, everybody's swimming in it and just everybody looked stupid.  You know what I like?  I was watching a bit of, ever since I was, I think it's, I don't know what it is.  Obviously it influenced me, but ever since I was on the crossover last week, I'm actually 
[03:36:30]  making a concerted effort to keep up with what's going on in sports and to watch some  of these games.  Because you don't want to be caught with your pants down again, huh?  I wasn't caught with, did you see the show?  No, but you were scrambling.  You were trying to figure some shit out.  But did I figure it out?  Okay.  So then how was I caught with my pants down?  I bought a motherfucking belt.  That's what I did.  You know that, Sal, didn't I?  Oh, yeah.  You saw me on that show.  I didn't get to catch it, but I heard you did very, and no one, no one has said you  did bad.  Everyone said you held your own.  No one person.  I didn't get caught with my pants down.  Well, you were going.  Well, I bought a belt. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, but you got, you got previewed on what they were going to be talking about.  And I said, there's not one wrestling topic here.  Not one.  Not one for me to do a little internet research.  But yeah, so I've been trying to keep up.  And I saw, it was a highlight for me, because I'm such a big Jay-Z fan, that did you see,  did you watch the, obviously you must have watched the Heat game last night.  Yeah.  So did you see the three-minute Jay-Z commercial that came out?  That's what I actually came in here to talk to you about.  Yeah, so middle of the game, and people got upset with me because I tweeted about that  being more exciting than the game. 
[03:37:30]  I mean, it was, they put out this three-minute commercial, because I guess Jay-Z is now in  a partnership with Samsung phones.  But what it really was, was just a three-minute long commercial announcing that he's got a  new album coming out.  But like, we talk about style and what people are wearing, like, Jay-Z I can handle, because  he looks like he's a person, he's just got a sweatshirt on that fits him well, he's got  a nice watch on, he's got some jeans on, and that's it.  That's his look, though.  He's keeping it simple.  He's been chilling with Rick Rubin at Jungle City, that's fucking awesome. 
[03:38:00]  And Rick Rubin's laying down again, that's what he did for Black Sabbath.  Rick Rubin, yeah, he's amazing.  In his contract, he requires, like, 28 pillows, and they have to, like, form them and shit.  Yeah, he's a loser.  Yeah, he's out of his fucking mind.  I love him.  He's the man.  But see, like, I don't understand the outcome, it has to be like, well, we're not gonna wear  oversized Coogee anymore, instead, we're gonna wear turquoise sweater vests with capris.  Like, why can't you just be like, you know what, how about I wear some clothes that fit me well  and I'm comfortable in?  Well, I mean, Jay-Z can do his own thing, you know what I mean?  Like, but I like, I like in hip-hop that not everybody's looking exactly the same. 
[03:38:30]  You know what I mean?  They're trying to develop their own style.  Like, look at, look at Trinidad James.  Like, he looks so far goddamn ridiculous that it just becomes, it just becomes, it becomes  funny.  Ridiculous.  And then it's almost like, it's like he stands out.  Right.  I have a friend who's a cop, I was talking to him over the weekend, and he was like, I  saw Trinidad James coming out, we've talked about Trinidad James before, he's the one that,  I talked to Lil Jon about him most recently, but before that, Troy and me played a song  for you on the air, and it's the one where he's just rapping about everything being gold 
[03:39:00]  and dropping the N-word literally 150 times in one song.  So, he's coming out of the Best Buy Theater here in Times Square, and my cop buddy is talking  to his people, and Trinidad James comes over, and my cop buddy goes, Trinidad James!  And Trinidad looks over at him like he's in trouble, and my buddy goes, Pop the bottle,  I'm sweating!  Woo!  I'm just like, what?  You're a uniformed police officer. 
[03:39:30]  You can't do this.  That's great.  Another thing I noticed about black youth pop culture is that a lot more black kids  are skating now, and like Supreme, you know Supreme, the skate brand that was pretty much  in the shitter in the early 2000s has been revitalized because of everyone, everyone  buys Supreme now.  Like, their shit gets sold out, and it flips on eBay for like twice the price.  Yeah, Tyler the Creator.  Tyler the Creator fucking brought that shit back like crazy.  And you know who bid it off Tyler the Creator, who's a lot more famous than Tyler? 
[03:40:00]  It's Lil Wayne.  Oh yeah.  He jumped all over that.  Like, he saw...  I feel like he started skating because Tyler the Creator and all these...  I think that's right.  But nobody knew.  Tyler the Creator is like, he's his rapper.  He was on...  His biggest claim to fame is probably at last year's MTV Awards when he came out and just  said he didn't like Bruno Mars.  Like, he just said, I don't like that music.  It's not good.  But yeah, he's like this kind of as famous as you can be underground rapper, I would say. 
[03:40:30]  He's up there.  He's at the top of the kind of not mainstream.  Right.  You know what I mean?  And yeah, I guess Lil Wayne saw him coming like years ago.  And just bit him a mile away.  Yeah.  He just stole all of his style because he's just like...  Like, everything that they sell at Urban Outfitters, if they have an Urban Outfitters  at the mall near you, everything that's at that store is just something that they saw  Tyler the Creator wear.  And his crew is Odd Future, and all of those guys are all dressed like that.  They wear like shirts with fucking donuts on them.  Right. 
[03:41:00]  That's like their thing is like a pink donut.  Right, right.  Like a Simpson's donut.  Right.  But it's not like they went to Urban Outfitters and just outfitted themselves.  Right.  They kind of did that, and then now everybody's kind of biting off them because they're not  famous enough yet for people to realize we just, you know, their whole shit just got  stolen.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's true.  Like, at least here in the city, I mean, every black kid's skating now.  Yeah.  And they're amazing.  They're a lot of great skaters.  Brian in South Carolina. 
[03:41:30]  Hey, Sam.  How you guys doing?  Good.  I was just thinking about what you said earlier about Troy, how he said eventually that words  that aren't acceptable now eventually will be.  I was thinking about all my Mexican friends that are okay with me now calling them wet  back and beaner because it's been a while, and we all use it now.  Yeah, but you couldn't go up to a stranger and do that.  You have to put your time in with those people, you know?  I'm just being ironical.  Sorry.  Well, I mean, I could picture you having friends that were okay with calling you them  wet backs.  I mean, what I'm saying is you're right, too.  As time goes on, you don't gain words. 
[03:42:00]  You know, it doesn't become more acceptable.  But you can't just walk around and just be like, yo, what up?  Yeah, but it's like calling somebody a dude.  Eventually, it's going to be like calling somebody a dude.  No, it won't.  Yeah, it will.  It has to.  It's not becoming, it's becoming more politically correct, not less.  No, I hear everybody saying it.  Everybody.  Well, I think that we have, thanks, buddy.  Different, I think we're looking at different scopes then.  Like, are you saying I'll be able to use it on, I don't think you'll ever be able to  use it because I think our generation won't be. 
[03:42:30]  Kids will be able to and then they'll grow up and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  But, like, I don't think I would ever be able to, but, you know, maybe my.  You'd feel weird saying it.  Right.  But my kids will probably be able to use it.  But we'll never be able to, you know, admit to using it.  You're not going to be able to go on television and start saying those words.  Well, I don't even think you can really say it.  Black people can even really say it on regular television now.  Right.  And that's what I'm saying.  Like, that's what I meant.  That's what's not getting any better.  But it's going to, it's still going to be, you know what's going to happen is a white,  a white kid's going to come out with, with a black crew. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  And they're going to be like, no, it's cool.  He can use it.  Then again, by the time we have kids, nobody's going to watch television anyway.  So a difference doesn't make what they let people say.  They'll be on YouTube.  Well, kids are going to be rapping.  White kids are going to be rapping using it.  That's what I'm waiting for.  That's what I'm waiting for.  One of these white rappers to step up.  Does he drop M-bombs?  Oh, yeah.  Good.  It's like, fuck, dude, you're a white dude from fucking Poughkeepsie.  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  No, I'm glad he does.  And it'll be like a half black kid.  And it'll be like, okay, well, I'm half black.  I can say that. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Look, if Drake can drop M-bombs, anybody can.  The grassy motherfucker.  Exactly.  He's like a child actor.  It's half Jewish.  The word is something that black people have held on to and they're going to hold on to.  You know what I mean?  They should.  That's the other thing.  It sounds right about that.  Like, you wish that you could have free range with that word.  You've asked Hook it many times for it.  They gave me a pass.  Yeah.  You want that word so badly.  Yeah, I do.  Don't you think black people know how cool that word is?  They do.  But eventually, white people are just going to take it. 
[03:44:00]  They're just going to snatch it.  Because that's what they do throughout time with black people.  We've stolen all their music.  Right.  And then black people are going to realize, oh, fuck, we let Mac Miller use it.  Now, God damn it.  We gave it up.  And I see, like, on Twitter, like, little white girls from the fucking middle of nowhere are saying nigga, like, tweeting it like it's nothing to all their little friends.  So it's like, it's only a matter of time.  If all these, like, kids that are, like, 18 now, 17, they're all saying it, eventually it's just going to be... 
[03:44:30]  I guess there's less people nowadays that are young that will punch you in the face for dropping an M-bomb.  And they just, they never lived through what we lived through where it was so...  Like, to them, that word is simply a word used in rap songs.  That's their context of the word.  It doesn't have the connotation that other people...  It is not an offensive word.  ...from the 60s or, you know...  It's just like any other curse word.  Yeah.  It's like dropping a C-bomb.  It's like it doesn't actually mean anything.  And we were old enough to remember in rap music when they were first saying that...  Yeah, it was like, whoa!  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  And it was like, oh, well, yeah, white people can't...  It wasn't cool for...  You were not allowed to say that.  They would, like, white people would say, you're not allowed to say this word.  But you know what's weird, though?  White people could absolutely not say that word, but black people could say it on the radio.  Back then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why they've changed it.  Everything...  Things got flipped somewhere where it became so taboo to say it anywhere in media that,  like, kids were just like, I don't care that much about it.  But then remember Cypress Hill in Staying in the Brain, you know, that dude's a straight-up 
[03:45:30]  Hispanic dude.  Yeah.  And he's dropping it.  So it's like, well, obviously it's not just black people.  Hispanic dudes do it with a certain confidence that I think everybody just goes, okay.  White people are going to have to see, that's what white people are going to have to do.  They're going to have to take it.  Yeah.  Just like rocking a double-breasted capri suit.  You just do it.  Just like rocking some tight LeBron James red plaid pants.  You got to own it.  You just do it like that's...  No, this is how it's supposed to be.  Yeah.  I saw one of my favorite hardcore bands, Sheer Terror.  This dude is Paul Bearer, the singer.  Just massive dude, covered in tattoos. 
[03:46:00]  He passed away, correct?  No, no.  Different Paul Bearer?  No, this is the Reverend Paul Bearer on Sheer Terror.  Gotcha.  And he was on stage, a white dude from New York City, just saying the word nigga.  Nobody said anything to him.  Nobody had a problem with it.  Right.  The guy's just...  He just stood up there and owned it.  Well, that's what you got.  Yeah.  If you drop a word like that and you got just a little bit of glass in your eye.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Just like a little bit of moisture in your eyeball.  Just that tiny little inkling of doubt, then you're done. 
[03:46:30]  Like that's what you got to...  If you're going to have the balls to just walk around and be like, this is a word in  my vocabulary.  I was just getting my hair cut the other day.  I was in the barbershop.  Black people in the barbershop.  Did you go to a black barbershop?  That's where I go, yeah.  How come?  Because it's right by my house and they just cut me up.  You don't do it because it's like cooler?  Like, oh, look at me.  I'm trying to go to a black barbershop?  It's cheaper.  I don't know.  Eric, do you think Troy goes to a black barbershop to be cool?  Nah, I think it's just because it's cheap.  It's cheap because I got to cut like every week or every other week. 
[03:47:00]  Survey says you go because it's cheap.  Okay.  So this white guy was in there with black people just dropping nigga this, nigga that.  And nobody had a problem with it.  It was fine.  White dude was doing it.  A white dude, yeah.  Like an Irish white dude.  He wasn't like a wigger.  No, I mean he dressed hip-hop.  Okay.  Like he had gold on and...  All gold everything?  Yeah.  Tattoos?  Yeah.  Sideways hat maybe?  No, he didn't have a sideways hat.  No hat?  No.  He said it was just short.  He had a fade.  But do you have to kind of try to embrace the hip-hop culture quite a bit if you're going 
[03:47:30]  to try to get away with that?  Well, I think if there was like a hillbilly running around saying nigga, it would really  seem out of place.  You know what I mean?  It probably would.  What did you think about the big Jay-Z commercial last night?  I think he's going to have one of the best hip-hop albums of the year.  I told you he still...  And I don't know how he does it.  But he comes out with that commercial.  And like I said, he doesn't have any of these ridiculous clothes on.  He's in a room.  Everybody in that room is 40 plus.  They're all older gentlemen at this point. 
[03:48:00]  Rick Rubin has a giant white beard.  You know, Jay-Z's in his mid-40s.  You had Timbaland in there, who's in his 40s.  Pharrell's probably the...  Who?  I said Pharrell.  Pharrell.  Who's that Pharrell in here?  Pharrell, sorry.  And he's still in his early 40s.  Yeah, Pharrell's in his 40s.  Yeah, for sure.  Holy shit.  He's been around forever.  But all those guys look like, oh yeah, those guys are cool.  Yeah.  I don't know how they do it.  But speaking of Pharrell, he was skating...  Actually, you may be right with your theories about the word. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Anthony Cumia just texted me.  Uh-huh.  He said, I've said nigger five times since I left the studio.  So, maybe you're right.  See, Anthony's always...  Anthony's on the next level shit.  Yeah, I think it's going to be...  I got so excited when I saw that commercial.  Just the little snippets they gave.  I was like, this sounds cool.  But see, you know what has to happen, though?  And Jay-Z knows, man.  He has to surround himself by the best of the best.  Because if he comes out with a record at his age that's a flop, 
[03:49:00]  it'll make him look like a real asshole.  But if he comes out and he puts out a banger,  then it's like, oh, yeah, Jay-Z's the fucking man.  He's got a...  I don't know who he surrounds himself with.  It's the top people in the industry.  But that's...  I mean, he...  But there have to be...  Because, like I said, all those people have been around for so long.  And most of the time,  people have their time when they know what's going on.  And that kind of gets away from them.  And then they kind of just do what they do forever.  But all these people, 
[03:49:30]  there's got to be other people around them  who are forward-thinking  and know what the next thing is  and the next thing and the next thing.  Because these six guys in that room,  there's no way that by themselves  they have known how to stay ahead of every trend.  Sam, all these big producers,  and I know this for a fact,  all these big producers have teams of people working.  That's what I'm talking about.  And I mean fucking teams.  Yeah, and it's not like Timbaland sitting there  ironing out a beat in front of Jay-Z.  He probably has guys writing probably  three, four, five hundred beats 
[03:50:00]  and maybe they'll pick one of them.  It's not like Timbaland is just sitting there  with his drum machine anymore.  He hasn't done that in many years.  And not to discredit him, though,  that's just the way it is.  He's probably so fucking busy.  Well, he shouldn't be.  He doesn't have time to sit down.  If Timbaland was behind a drum machine,  I'd be like...  Come on, dude.  Yeah.  But he figured out his sound.  So basically he pays a guy to,  this is my sound,  this is what I want,  and then I'm sure he goes in and tweaks it.  Of course.  And if it's not Timbaland quality,  he'll just be like,  no, this sucks,  and it will never see the light of day.  Right.  Because like all those guys,  I mean,  Diplo pumps out so many beats after beats. 
[03:50:30]  It's like, dude,  there's no way he's writing those beats.  Right, right, right.  But, yeah,  that's going to be,  it's going to be the album of the summer.  I mean, this,  yeah,  because it's coming out July 4th.  4th.  Yeah.  And just from that clip,  you're just like,  God damn.  It says for free, too.  And it's funny.  Well, it's coming out for free  if you get that Samsung phone.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's funny, too,  because like...  Timbaland is like,  you know,  he hasn't really done anything too awesome lately.  No.  Pharrell's made a comeback,  but like we were saying, 
[03:51:00]  like six months ago,  we were thought,  that dude's done.  Yeah.  Like he,  Pharrell,  as you guys know Pharrell,  we were doing the summer,  song of the summer break a couple weeks ago.  Pharrell is the guy  who's on the Robin Thicke song.  Yep.  The Blurred Lines.  Pharrell is on that massive Daft Punk song.  That's his voice on it.  So, apparently...  He also,  I heard a song recently,  he was on the Up soundtrack.  Did you ever hear those tracks?  No.  They're actually...  From the movie Up?  From the movie,  I know it's really like kiddie,  but...  Where the old man... 
[03:51:30]  It's really good.  Attaches his house to balloons,  and his wife is barren?  That's a terrible movie.  I've never listened to the...  Maybe not, it's not Up,  it's definitely...  I've never listened to the Up soundtrack.  I don't listen to Pixar...  Is that...  I was in a car with a kid recently.  The last time I listened to a Pixar soundtrack,  it was Randy Newman  singing all the Toy Story songs.  You've got a friend in me.  Christopher in Michigan  has a question for you, Troy.  From time!  What's up, buddy?  Hey, the Ratchet Party mixtape  is fucking phenomenal, 
[03:52:00]  and I use it when I work out.  I was wondering when  Troy was going to release something new.  It's fucking awesome.  When's that new shit coming out, Troy?  When are you dropping it?  I'm slowly working on mixtapes.  Right now,  I'm just working on  this metal project  called Serpents That Swim.  Some kind of like  balls deep in that,  but I'll put out a new mixtape.  Keep it balls deep.  Just like Joe Piscopo.  He stays balls deep.  That's right.  Coming in bitches.  That's the way you gotta be.  What were you saying, Sal?  Yeah, it's from Despicable Me.  Oh.  Isn't that movie years old?  Yeah.  But I mean, 
[03:52:30]  it's interesting that  someone like him  would be able to pull off  these pop songs.  I don't know if you pulled it off.  I never heard of this song  and it came out years ago.  Right?  I suppose so.  Good thing he made a comeback.  All his old shit, man.  You listen to that  old Neptune shit?  Old Pharrell shit?  It holds up, doesn't it?  It's just fucking...  It's still his.  He was skateboarding  before anybody.  Yeah, he was.  He was cool.  He is still cool.  He is still cool.  I mean...  And we wouldn't have said  that six months ago.  No way.  And I questioned you  when you were like,  yeah, he's making a comeback.  I said, whoa, 
[03:53:00]  he's on like one song.  And you were like,  no, he's gonna be on a couple.  And now he's attached  to this big Jay-Z thing.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe  how many people  were talking about  that Jay-Z commercial.  It's huge.  It was amazing.  Because just right off the...  Just those clips,  you're like,  this is gonna be fucking great.  He's such...  He's just a businessman.  Yeah.  Like, he's like,  no, we have to get into  the NBA Finals  and buy three minutes.  Like, a whole break.  And he's smart  because you know  Samsung is like,  well, we want to do  like a phone commercial  and you're on the phone 
[03:53:30]  and everything.  He's like, no.  We'll mention the phone  at the end.  Trust me.  People will be talking  about this.  And it works.  Because if he was just  on there being like,  yo, we are not  Samsungs.  We are not Samsungs.  Everybody would be like,  that was dumb.  Like, I don't care about this.  But you know,  my question is,  what the hell  is Kanye doing now?  Well, Kanye's album  got leaked over the weekend.  Yeah.  First of all,  Kanye is a father.  Yeah.  He's got a child now.  He's got a mouth to feed.  Okay.  His new shit is just not...  I haven't heard it. 
[03:54:00]  It's not for the clubs.  I didn't hear the leaked...  It has like bluesy drums  in it and stuff.  It's like he's going  kind of dark and angry.  I heard the songs  that he put out on SNL  when he said something  about being a follower,  but I'd rather be a dick  than a swallower.  Something like that.  I was like,  that's very clever, Kanye.  They're terrible.  I don't know what he's doing.  I was hanging with this girl  yesterday that went and saw him  at what just happened  the other week.  He just played around here  in the city.  But he just said  it was awful. 
[03:54:30]  He said it was terrible.  That's that quest  to be different, though.  At some point,  there's a lot of wrong turns  you can possibly take  when you're trying  to be different.  But we talked about Kanye West  and everything he puts out  in the last...  After his first couple albums,  everything he puts out,  at first,  you don't like it  because it's not  mainstream sounding  and it grows on you.  I don't know  if this is going to grow on you.  I haven't heard it yet,  so I don't know.  I don't know.  Bob in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, I just wanted to ask.  Didn't Jay-Z retire 
[03:55:00]  a few years ago for music?  Yeah, so did Michael Jordan  and then he came back  and won some more championships.  It's not like they have  to stay retired  and collect a pension.  They can make an album  and they can make it.  But you've got to figure,  though, when is it over for him?  You know what I mean?  Because if the dude's  pushing 50,  it's like,  you can't be rapping  in your 60s.  Yeah, but you can't be  rapping in your 40s.  Yeah, I guess not.  You know what I mean?  I guess if he can still  pull it off.  At some point,  he just won't be able  to pull it off anymore.  I hope he stops  before that happens. 
[03:55:30]  I hope he doesn't put out  a couple clunker of albums.  Because it's so strange  that it's not embarrassing  yet for him.  Because you want it to be.  And I'm sure everybody  listening is like,  in theory,  on paper,  it is embarrassing.  Yeah.  He's like a dude  in his 40s  that's just up there  rapping like he's  in his 20s or whatever.  And on paper,  it's foolish,  but he's still doing it  better than any kids  are doing it.  Right.  So it's like,  well, no,  he is still  the best guy  doing it right now.  Yeah.  On that level. 
[03:56:00]  I mean,  that gives hope  to all the rappers  that are coming up  that are like,  they thought they had  that short show.  No,  he gives hope  to bust a bus.  It's who he gives hope  to.  Busta Rhymes is somewhere  going,  oh yeah,  I can still make  my big comeback.  He's tried.  He's tried.  I know.  They're terrible.  Nobody gives a fuck  about that style anymore.  Yeah,  got it.  You can go fast.  It's like,  nobody knows what  you're even saying.  That's good for an album.  It's like,  you know what's fun  about rap  is when you can  rap along to it.  Right.  I mean,  you're in your car  shouting all the niggas  and everything.  No,  you don't have to  shout every n-word  that you hear.  You know you do that too. 
[03:56:30]  You know when that's,  you don't,  when you're listening  to a rap song,  you don't pause  when those words come up.  I mean,  you're in your car  by yourself,  you fucking say them.  That's the past.  I do,  I do like the Drake song  that Ant played  on the air the other day.  So,  I mean,  there are,  you know.  So what are you going to do,  pause every time  when you're singing along?  No,  you're not going to pause.  Then you would sound  like an idiot.  Right.  It's like,  what are you covering up,  dude?  You know what the word is.  So,  in your car,  when you're by yourself,  you're using the word nigga,  right?  I'm not going to say  it has never happened.  Okay.  But,  So would it be just nice 
[03:57:00]  if we could come out  of the closet  with our niggas  and just come out and  No,  it wouldn't be nice.  Okay,  that's up to them.  That's up to,  that's up to whoever  wants to leave it up to.  I'm demanding they let us,  they let us out.  Well,  I think they should  have a funeral for the word.  I think they should just  be like,  white people,  go ahead.  That would be the funeral  for the word.  That would be smart.  If they were like,  you know what?  This is not a cool word anymore.  All you white people,  feel free to use it  as much as you want.  The word would be dead  in two weeks.  They jumped the shark. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  They have nothing to,  to hold against us  at that point.  Like,  like you said,  we've taken everything else.  But they just make up a word.  Yeah,  remember when Snoop was like,  I'm going to stop  saying the word nigga,  I'm going to start  saying nephew?  Right.  I was like,  fucking fuck you.  Get the fuck out of here.  Start saying nigga again,  asshole.  Alright,  alright,  I will.  Yeah,  I guess who's back  to saying nigga.  He's like,  I'm going to stop  smoking weed too.  Shut the fuck up.  Alright,  I'll start smoking again.  Exactly.  What made you cool?  Yeah,  as a matter of fact,  I will smoke so much weed  that I will develop  a Rastafarian alter ego  named Lion.  Yeah. 
[03:58:00]  You're on some way  other fucking shit now.  I don't know  what you're doing anymore.  This is that Kanye track  if you want to hear a second of it.  It's fucking weird, man.  I don't know how I feel about it.  Yeah.  I mean,  I don't know.  It's like Black Keys  and he,  yeah,  he's Kanye.  He's shouting.  I don't know  what he's so mad about.  If I was Kanye West,  I'd be pretty happy  banging Kim Kardashian  and making millions of dollars.  Yeah,  let's leave it at that.  Got all kinds of clothes and shit.  He's on SNL.  What's he got to be  so pissed off about?  He's pissed off  that everybody's still mad 
[03:58:30]  that he took  Taylor Swift's microphone,  but that was a dick move.  You acted like a dick  and people treated you  like a dick.  What are you mad at?  Maybe he's just  to take risks.  Maybe he's just trying  to take a risk  to see if other people  will follow along.  What I do is put out  a record after this  of just bangers  and then people will be like,  oh cool, Kanye's back.  He probably knows too.  He knows in his back pocket.  He's got a whole album  full of just like  right down the middle hits.  Right.  These are all guaranteed hits  so I'll put out  whatever I want  until it doesn't work anymore  and then once it doesn't work,  here's some hits for you. 
[03:59:00]  I'm back.  He's got videos from now  people making shit like this  and he's like,  look, I did it back in fucking  It's like,  look what happened  when Bob Dylan went electric.  People hated him for it.  And then all of a sudden  it's like,  oh cool.  Look,  your music history lesson  is over for today  because we got to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.
