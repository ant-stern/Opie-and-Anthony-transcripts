<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with significant technical difficulties, much to the hosts' frustration.  The unusually large crowd outside their Times Square studio was attributed to Jim Norton's impending appearance on Fox & Friends.  This led to a discussion about Justin Bieber's presence in the area and the ephemeral nature of child star fame, contrasting Bieber's short, intense career with the hosts' longer, less successful ones, using Leif Garrett and Hanson as examples.  Jim Norton, a guest in the studio preparing for his Fox & Friends appearance, joined the discussion, which then heavily featured mockery of John Sterling's Yankee's home run calls and a controversial umpire call in a Detroit Tigers game.  The conversation shifted to the deaths of Rue McClanahan and Gary Coleman, with significant focus and criticism directed towards speculation surrounding Coleman's ex-wife's behavior and statements. Several callers provided humorous anecdotes and contributed to the Gary Coleman discussion.  Patrice O'Neal joined the studio near the end, briefly commenting on the BP oil spill and hypothetical disastrous weather events.  The show ended with continued discussion of Gary Coleman and ongoing technical problems.

The show continued with a lengthy and darkly humorous, often profane, segment on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The hosts and callers speculated on the disaster's scale, the inadequacy of the response, and the potential for catastrophic consequences, including the hypothetical creation of a "fire hurricane".  They also discussed the perceived lack of emotional response from President Obama.  Later, a panel discussion featuring Jim Norton, Tom Shalhoub, Amy Schumer, and Patrice O'Neal joined the hosts.  While the oil spill remained a central topic, the conversation broadened to include media bias, Al Gore's divorce, and other societal issues.  A call with Dr. Michio Kaku offered a more scientific perspective, addressing the challenges of capping the well and the unlikelihood of a "fire hurricane".  Patrice O'Neal also mentioned his recent purchase of a Barrett .50 caliber rifle.

The next segment revisited the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, focusing on the challenges of capping the well at 5,000 feet.  Dr. Michio Kaku was again called, emphasizing the physics involved and advocating for a team of top physicists to solve the problem.  The conversation remained vulgar and sarcastic, criticizing BP's response.  The discussion then shifted to baseball umpire Jim Joyce's controversial call that prevented a perfect game, sparking debate and references to other controversial calls, including the George Brett pine tar incident.  Patrice O'Neal heavily used offensive language throughout this discussion.  A caller criticized Dr. Kaku, followed by more oil spill discussion, including the nuclear bomb solution.  Another caller expressed skepticism about time travel, leading to jokes about women's and men's prisons as depicted on MSNBC and a caller describing inmates tattooing the whites of their eyes, culminating in a discussion about prison absurdity. The hosts utilized highly offensive language and engaged in crude humor throughout.

The show continued with a graphic description of a man named Quill getting an eye tattoo, prompting disgust and concern from the hosts about the potential risks.  The conversation then turned to a TV show about bank robberies, inspiring a host to contemplate robbing a bank, leading to a discussion about firearms, particularly a .50 caliber rifle.  Carrot Top then entered the studio, engaging in a conversation about his career, including his appearances on Regis Philbin's show, his Vegas residency, and his personal life, with explicit references to masturbation and groupies.  His cynical demeanor was noted.  The conversation included other Vegas performers like Terry Fader and Danny Gans.  Bobo, another comedian, joined, engaging in a comedic segment describing Carrot Top's props with crude and offensive humor.  Carrot Top revealed he was experiencing urinary tract infections, prompting more jokes.

The final segment focused on Bobo's significant weight loss and health concerns.  A call to Bobo's mother, Aurora, revealed he had blood in his urine and pre-existing health issues.  The conversation became irreverent and vulgar, with numerous jokes about Bobo's health, his mother, and his genitals.  Carrot Top was initially used as a prop in this discussion before leaving.  The hosts called a urologist, Mike, who advised Bobo to seek medical attention.  The segment also included a call to someone who may have been a gun shop owner and further off-color discussions and jokes regarding Bobo's condition.  Significant time was spent on attempts to weigh Bobo, ending in humorous chaos.  The show concluded with well wishes for Bobo, promotions for upcoming events, and continued jokes at Bobo's expense.

I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend 
[00:04:00]  This stinks  Fucking shut the fuck up  We get it  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Friday  Yeah  Now I'm a little confused  We're in the middle of Times Square  Just off Times Square  And usually when we get into work  There's not a lot of people  There's not a lot of hustle and bustle  It's pretty much a ghost town out there 
[00:04:30]  A few people that want to hit you over the head  And take your wallet  Yeah, riffraff is all that's out on the streets at that hour  A few of the minorities that are going to be  Cooking  And making the donuts  Those type of people  You want the Giro?  Then a bunch of people that are coming into this building  To do radio  That's basically what we see every morning  This morning it's a fucking zoo out there  Lots of moms  Lots of kids  Something big is going on 
[00:05:00]  Up and down the street like crazy  And I figured it out  Jim Norton's going to be on Fox and Friends  And they can't get enough of this Jim Norton  That really is what it is  The whole gang is out there to see me  Fox News building is right over there  And Jimmy's got to make his way  So he needs the police escort to walk him over  I heard a band warming up as I was coming  You actually just got me on that  That was the last thing  But they do  My walk-in music for Fox is  Yes 
[00:05:30]  Yeah  Jim Norton is here for 15 minutes  Because he's just crazy  And then he's going to go over to Fox and Friends  Do a little TV  And then he's going to come back  And do a little more radio  Yes  Yay  How many shows are you doing these days?  You've got three or four radio shows  You're doing two or three TV shows  On a regular basis  I'm just at a point  Where I'm kind of coming to  Like a full realization  Of my abject failure  And it's time to fucking  Spread yourself thin  Time to spread myself thin  Yeah really  I've come to realize  That the fruit of all my labor 
[00:06:00]  Has been for naught  Actually  The hustle and bustle  Is for this god damn  Justin Bieber  Justin Bieber  Justin Bieber is a mere  Two or three blocks away  From us right now  Where is he playing  Today show  Or Good Morning America  Yeah what the fuck is he playing  I think the Today show  I don't know  There's a band right outside of Fox next door  They probably have Skynyrd or something  Somebody different right  That's how they're going to compete  Combat Justin Bieber  Yeah who do they have  I don't know  All I know is I saw  Gary Glitter  Yeah Gary Glitter 
[00:06:30]  I saw people camping out yesterday  When I left the show  When I left yesterday  And drove down the street  There was a blocked off area  With police barricades  And young girls  Camped out  They were starting to camp out  For Justin Bieber  And there I was  Me with no candy  But a tent  Note to self  Have candy and escalate  At all times  Have candy  Right  Oh this Justin Bieber 
[00:07:00]  Is a joke  It's Bieber  Fieber  Yeah really  Fieber  Fieber  Bieber  Fieber  Yeah is it  I hate when they say that  It doesn't rhyme  Shut up  Bieber  Fieber  Bieber  Fieber  Would you rather have  A career like us  Which is  I don't know  This is a career  Well  That has spanned  The rear part  That has spanned  About 15 years  Yeah  Mediocre at best  Or a Justin Bieber  Two year holy shit career  Which one would you rather have 
[00:07:30]  The fucking skyrocket to nowhere  Yeah  Or the long nice haul  Yeah  The grind  This kid will be miserable  By the age of 20  You think he's gonna even be that long  How old  How old is this little fucker now  Well history shows that  This type of thing  Doesn't last that long  These Justin Biebers  There's been a million Justin Biebers  Before Justin Bieber  Oh my god  Right  Yes  You know who you gotta look at  I was trying to look up names  And that's how  That's how it happens 
[00:08:00]  Where you can't even  Remember the names  Of the past Justin Biebers  Bieber is 16 years old  He'll be done by 20  Done  Look at  Let's see  Who's a prime example  I tried to do this last night  Okay  Leif Garrett  Look at Leif Garrett  Back in the 70s  And look at Leif Garrett now  Wow  Wow  Aaron and Nick Carter 
[00:08:30]  Is another example people are giving  Okay  Yeah  They were as big as Justin Bieber  See you forget even  How big some of these past guys were  Well  Hanson was pretty big  Hanson's a good one  Hanson actually is a really good one  Was big  No one gives a shit about Hanson now  One guy  He's got like five or six kids  He's only like 24 years old  Yeah  He decided to just have a million kids  Yep  Yeah this Bieber kid will  Well he appeals to an audience 
[00:09:00]  That is going to  Outgrow him very quickly  Right  And then  There aren't usually new people  Come up and latch on  His audience is very distracted  They see something shiny  And they'll forget about Justin Bieber  Oh look  And have you ever camped out for anything  It's not  It's not  All it's cracked up to be  I sat out for Aussie tickets one night  In New Brunswick  Overnight  Many years ago  But I mean for the actual event  No never  Because at least with that  You could go home  Sleep  And know you have really good seats 
[00:09:30]  When the show actually comes back to town  I'm talking where you  Hung around for 20  30 hours  Because it's free  And then finally  Like people do it at Times Square  And all that crap  But by the time the event happens  You're miserable  You're like  Why did I just wait here for 36 hours  I don't give a shit anymore  I'm too tired  I want to go to bed  You never did that right?  Ugh  How many followers  No I never did that  Justin Bieber has  2,876,000 
[00:10:00]  And change  Followers on Twitter  That's kind of a few followers huh?  You think he reads all of  His  I've had a response to everyone  You think he sits there and reads them  No because he's never gotten back to me  I always write to him  Look I know it's weird for a 41 year old man to say  But I feel a connection  I want to tussle your hair  Yeah  If you just want a quick comparison  Aaron Carter  Who was like the biggest kid star  Like what three years ago?  Yeah  Has 62,000 followers 
[00:10:30]  Oh  See that's what happens  Was he that big really?  Aaron Carter?  Yeah he was getting there  I mean I don't think he was blowing up as big as Bieber is now  But he was definitely on his way  Bieber had that mall riot  When there was too many people  It was a regular riot  There's been a million of those type of mall riots  Yes  And stuff over the years  Yes  Did I say spandidid?  Yeah  Whatever  That spans  Whatever  Why don't you just listen to the fucking show  And shut your mouth  I miss Kenny already 
[00:11:00]  It's like we're supposed to have coffee every morning  The one day I got to come  Where's the coffee?  I know  Can we have a fucking  Can the producer just take care of us?  Yeah  For one day  Fuck  We didn't know you were coming in  No one knew you were coming in  If we knew you were coming  I'd have baked a cake  I say that just the opposite  Yeah?  Yeah  I knew you were going to bake a cake  I'd have come  I love cake  Cake is good  Crisscross 
[00:11:30]  New Kids on the Block  Ooh  You know  New Kids  Then every once in a while  You get one that has real talent  Like a Justin Timberlake  He was one of these guys  He was able to break out  He was a breakout star  He broke out  And was able to survive  This whole fever thing  That Justin Bieber's going through  How about the gay man  Yes  Ricky Martin  Ricky Martin  Ricky Martin  He was in Manudo  Manudo  Manudo  Ricky Martin  Stupid Ricky Martin 
[00:12:00]  Anyway  So we got that going on  It's a zoo around the building today  Jimmy's doing Fox and Friends  What time is that going to air  Jimmy?  I don't know  It's live  I've got to be over there  Is it really?  You're one of the friends?  Yeah  You're going to be one of the friends?  I'm the Fox  I've got to be over there  At like 6.30  It's a 7.15  Why did you come in?  He's weird  I don't know  He's a weirdo  I figured I could  I would have just sat there  I'll wait  Like Rupert Pupkins  Just sit in the Fox lobby  I'll wait  I'm going to try to sit  With the same pose he had 
[00:12:30]  When he fantasizes  That he's talking to Jerry  How do you do it?  He's just  Lean back with his two arms  Between his knees  In that very stiff pose  Stiff  Jimmy  Jimmy so doesn't have to be here  If it was me or Ant  We'd be like  Ah you know  We've got the big TV thing today  So I'm going to have to take  Three days off  To prepare  I was just going to say that  Yeah I'm not going to be in Monday either  I've got to wind down  From the Wants and Friends thing  I'm just really tired  I drank coffee  At the gig last time 
[00:13:00]  How was Caroline?  It was great  Yeah but I'm just really  Good crowd  Yeah yeah really good for Thursday  It's been fantastic  But I'm just so tired  So I drank coffee  It's like you drink coffee  At like 9 o'clock  You're like what the fuck  Am I doing?  That's the worst  Because then you're up  Yeah I mean Kenny made out  In the truck for a few minutes  Oh no  Hey uh  Bud Selig is a cunt  Oh he's  And we're going to talk about that  In a few minutes  We're going to let people  Wake up a little bit  Wake up  But because we're going to lose  Jimmy in a few minutes here  He cares more about this  John Sterling call  Than I would  Oh my god yes 
[00:13:30]  And Anthony pointed this out  To the guys  And we pulled it  For everybody today  Of course John Sterling  The play by play guy  For the Yankees on radio  And he has his stupid home run calls  That I don't know  I don't think people like it  But the media doesn't point that out  And we've put it out there  To other people in other cities  To have their announcers  And dumb things that they say  For their sporting team  And send it in 
[00:14:00]  And no one has ever sent us anything  That tops the pure shit  That is John Sterling's fucking calls  Correct  And  Look you can still send him in  But  Yeah send him in  But until you know  You find someone better  And believe me  We could do this  After every single game  Right  After every single game  We could play John Sterling calls  And just douche chill you out  But last night  Or yesterday  It was just  Horrific with this one  Takes the cake  Horrific 
[00:14:30]  I think we start with the A-Rod one first  Of course  Alright  This is the warm up  And then we'll get to the really bad one  The payoff is drilled  To deep right center field  It is high  It is far  It is gone  Alex Rodriguez  Drove it a little further this time  About four rows back  In the right center field seats  An A-bomb  From A-Rod  A two run blast  And the Yankees take a 4-1 lead  It's just terrible  An A-bomb 
[00:15:00]  An A-bomb  An A-bomb  From the Enola game  It's a good home run call  Up to that point  Up to that point  I don't mind it  I don't mind it at all  That's what bothers me  That he's ruining a genuinely good  Home run call  Yes  Right  Right  And he's just trying  Much too hard  Much too hard  Because  The next one  Is just beyond 
[00:15:30]  Well who  I don't know who  Brett Gardner is  By the way  If Danny's telling the truth  I might get nauseous  Oh a ribby from Robbie  In the first day  In the first day  Robbie Cano  A ribby from Robbie  Oh now he does ribby  So it's not just home run calls  Where he's getting a little weird  He's expanding  He's expanding his repertoire  To fucking thrown out at first  Yeah sometimes on the drive home  If there's an afternoon  Yankees game on  I'll just throw it on  Just to douche myself out  Yeah  Yeah  Shoot  Shoot  It didn't even take  It didn't even take  To the second inning 
[00:16:00]  A ribby from Robbie  Yuck  Ugh  Alright well  Who's Brett Gardner  I don't know  Is he  One of the newer Yankees  Yeah  Yeah he's  New addition  A utility player  The hell's a utility player  Utility player  One day he's in left field  The next day he's a shortstop  I was just a fucking faggot  No the next day he's a truck driver  Comes and goes  Well he had a home run last night  And John Sterling made it very special for him  Oh good  And Millwood deals 
[00:16:30]  Swung on  There goes the deep right  That ball is high  It is far  It is gone  Brett Gardner  Of the Gardner  Has planted one  In the right field seats  Gardie  Goes yardie  And the Yankees  Take a 6-1 lead  He had to get in two  He got two in  He probably was trying to decide which one to use  And said  Fuck it  I'm using both  That  I am  I am douching out  Gardie  Goes yardie 
[00:17:00]  That's a Brian Regan thing  Gardie goes yardie  Gardie goes yardie  Gardie goes yardie  Hey  Right  You can hear Brian Regan doing that as a goof  I've got a baseball announcer  I'm walkie and talkie  That's what I'm  Yeah  That's what my little bit's based on  Gardie goes yardie  Gardner planted one was bad  Yes  Real bad  Gardie goes yardie  Yes  Real bad  Both are bad  It's horrible  Yeah  He really forced it 
[00:17:30]  Nothing worse than when he really forces it  Yeah  You think he practices them  Of course he does  And then it's like  Here it is  Here's the moment  I have to say  Gardie goes yardie  He has a hairbrush  Looks in the mirror  Big fat tiff jiggling  His wife tolerates it  Because he probably makes like  You know  2.6 a year  Gardie goes yardie  Matt calls retardie  He stinks  He really fucking does 
[00:18:00]  He hated  And what's her facey there  Who's in the booth with him  Now Susan  Susan Waldman  Just keeps her mouth shut  During his call  If she perked up  In the middle of one of his calls  And cut him off  He'd punch her in the face  It would be over  How great would that  Gardie  I'll draw it  He really did hit it deep  He would knock her  You got one yardie  You cunt  He just loses his shit  He would knock her cancer wig  Right off her head  Oh god  She doesn't have the cancer anymore 
[00:18:30]  I hope not  I think she did alright with that  Gardie  This is the most exciting thing  Oh my goodness gracious  What are you doing  It's my call bitch  Has she ever raised her voice again  Since that famous incident  Nope  Nope  Not even at home  No  She knows to keep that yap shut  Oh she's a good lady  She sounded silly that day  Silly I tell you  I like Susan Waldman  I really do  Even though she's kind of  You know  Susan Waldman  Yeah  We should all leave at 6.30  Because Jimmy leaves at 6.30 
[00:19:00]  Because Jimmy's got a good  You're going to be to do  A 20 minute fucking radio show  No just run breaks  Until like 8  Yeah  We'll just keep going  Oh you're coming back at 8  When are the commercials  Why don't we get Patrice  Fucking Steve  Oh Jimmy's going to be out  Until at least 9.30  I'm like alright  Get Patrice or something  It's going to be good  To have Patrice in here  Of course  Patrice is always fun  I didn't know  It was going to be that quick  Why are you  Yes  What's he doing  I don't know  I mean it's fine  That Patrice is coming in  But I figured out 
[00:19:30]  What the hell  If you're going to be gone  For most of the show  Bring someone in  Why not  Yeah no I knew  I would only be gone  From like  I knew it was a 6.15  They wanted a 6.15  Pick up 7.15 on air  But I'm like  Nah nah  I'll just go  I'll walk over from  Yeah it's very difficult  They have to shrink him down  And put him in the television  Yeah  I don't know how long  The regrowing process takes  Like in Willy Wonka  I'm a blithering idiot  And we got Carrot Top  Coming in today  I thought he said  You were going to be gone  At least till 9 
[00:20:00]  No I might be back  By 7.35  Whatever it don't matter  It'll be good  The Carrot Top  Hey Jimmy what else  Is on your mind  Before you move over  To Fox and Friends  Oh not much  Just the Obama oil spill  Yeah  Larry King  And let's see  Is Bush to blame  For the Gore's breakup  You know  Oh look  You got your notes  I like it  Yeah I'll be talking  About something else  Oh yeah  Hey Bud Selig  A cunt or what  He's fucking  I mean it's disgusting  Baseball should be embarrassed 
[00:20:30]  Because they did change it  With the Pine Tar incident  And I'm sure somebody will say  Well there's a reason for that  And not this  Because that wasn't a judgment call  That was a rule misinterpreted  Whatever  This was a rule misinterpreted too  You're supposed to say  He's out when he's out  And he's safe  When he's fucking safe  They have an opportunity  To do the right thing  It would be just great PR  For Major League Baseball  They've had shitty PR  Over the last  Terrible  Last decade  Some of them can pitch  Huh  I didn't hear  Oh  Oh  I didn't hear  Sorry  Yeah  I so missed it  And I was looking right at you

[00:23:30]  Travis not a fan  Of this young man  No no  Of the pitcher  All I hear about  Is what a piece of shit he is  And how he lucked out  From Travis  Travis will only talk about  How shitty this pitcher is  He was 6-10 last year  With a 564 ERA  He's not the greatest pitcher  Wow  He got lucky  He had a good night  He makes 400,000 a year  That's not a lot  In baseball  Yeah  A lot for everybody else  But not a lot  For a baseball player  And they gave him  A Corvette right  Yeah 
[00:24:00]  Yeah  Can I tell you this  He will be more famous  From this  That's what I was saying  Jimmy  Than he would have been  From a perfect game  Because he'll always  He'll be in the history books  But he's going to have  A fucking asterisk  Next to his name  Throughout the history of baseball  People will always remember him  He's the guy  That got fucked on a bad call  For real  And because of this  It'll lead to some other opportunities  It's kind of like  The Taylor Swift thing  I mean Taylor Swift was famous  But then became really famous  After the Kanye West incident  Yeah  Really famous  And the umpire  Got to host SNL  That wasn't going to happen  No  If Kanye West didn't 
[00:24:30]  You know  Basically tackle her on that stage  And the umpire  It's like you know  Chris just said  Look just get the call right  And he's right  But you know what  If you're the ump  And you're weeping before the game  Alright fair enough  He really feels bad  Like  Jim Joyce  Get a hold of yourself  Yeah  It really is only a game  You fucking twat  Why don't you cry  For the people  Having their legs blown off  By IEDs  Fucking stupid asshole  And he's such a  Like man's man looking guy  And he's just  He looks like Goose Gossage  In like 1979  You know  When he's walking  When he's walking out

[00:26:00]  His applause  They gave him a vet  They gave him a Corvette too  They pulled it up there  Right behind home plate  Before the game  It'd be great if he  Drunk drove right after  He killed somebody  Killed Jim Joyce  Yeah  Or he killed everybody  With a mustache  Right  He just ran over  Men who looked like  The umpire  He's just running over  People that look like  Like that cabbie in England  He's shotgun  Blasting people  What a lunatic  That guy is  I know  Talking about guys  Guy wanting a tip  For his taxi cab driving  Oh right  Chip  Alright 500 bucks  To be nothing but  Chip on Fox

[00:29:30]  And say  Well that's a little sexist  So we should call them the Swisherettes  As well  It was fucking horrendous  Can they just shut up during a game  Really  And not even  Not even call it  Really  Don't even call the game  Just sit there  No um  Sirius XM has the baseball right  I think they have the baseball  Do they have the John Sterling  When you're watching the baseball  Um yes  They have the John Sterling  Oh they do  Yeah  I was thinking that might be an option  For Yankee fans  Uh no 
[00:30:00]  No  So alright  So fuck baseball on satellite radio  I was trying to give them a plug  I was listening to the 88  CBS  The 88  I was listening to the 88  For the Yankees  And the John Sterling  Yeah  In my  In my vehicle  Yeah  Uh Larry King is doing  The hokey pokey  And he's putting his left shoulder in  Thank you Kevin  Put your left shoulder in  Put your left shoulder out  Shake it all about  How important is the hokey pokey 
[00:30:30]  He really looks like a ghoul  So your thoughts on Bud Selig  Is that right  He should just overturn this fucking thing  Yeah it should have been done  It's not gonna  But in the long run  Uh this makes the pitcher more famous  What if he starts uh  Feeling a lot more pressure  Nah he's he's not  He's done with this  He's done with this  He's done and he's gonna move on  It's over Johnny  Really  Uh yeah  He's gotta look like he's in control  And he made his decision  And it shan't be changed  Uh huh  That's it  Hey we lost a golden girl overnight too 
[00:31:00]  That's right  The whore  Rue McClanahan  She was the original Samantha  The original Samantha  Rue McClanahan  Rue McClanahan  Of the golden girls  She was Blanche right  Yeah  She was Blanche uh  Oh you know her name  Her last name too  Devereux  Devereux  Devereux  Not gonna be around here no more  Uh  Not gonna be doing television  What's up with these brain hemorrhages  That's what got her too 
[00:31:30]  Wow  Age 76  Did someone smack her on the top of her head  With a frying pan  Like I think happened to Gary Coleman  But no one's saying  Well we don't know that yet  Look  We don't know that  This has  Murder written all over it  Wow  You can't just say that  I can say it based on my opinion  Okay  Make sure  My opinion  Make sure you add my opinion  This  The Gary Coleman situation  Is everything I watch  On every crime show  Cold case files 
[00:32:00]  First 48  First 40  Well not so much  First 48  Why not  Cause first 48 is  Is the gangsters  Gangster  It's very  Um  I'm sorry  Yeah  Yeah  It has nothing to do with insurance money  Or anything  It's just you disrespected me  And shit like that  Last night  Um  I had to watch a fine gentleman  Named Tree  Be put in prison  Uh  For his crimes  Against humanity  Was he  Tree of course  Somebody must have  Stepped on his foot  And he had to shoot his head off 
[00:32:30]  Oh good  And uh  Left him there  And it took 48 hours  For  Was he born with the name Tree  Uh  No of course not  He got the name Tree  And uh  And then I watched  Killa  Try to lie his way  Out of um  Murder rap  What did Killa do  It goes so well  Killa  Uh  He killed somebody  Well he's gotta live up to his name  Killa  But he wouldn't even  Fess up to his name  They're driving him around  To take a lie detector test  Because he was like  Look I take a lie detector test  I take one  And they were like 
[00:33:00]  Alright  They throw him in the car  And on the way there  He's like  Hmm  Maybe this ain't so good  And he's like  Is this stuff legal  What you're doing to me  Oh shit  And then  And then the guy in the backseat goes  What about your nickname  He goes  I ain't got no nickname  He goes  What about Killa  And he goes  I don't think I want to talk to you guys anymore  Oh shit  He goes  Maybe I should have a lawyer  And they go  Alright  We're not talking to you then  He goes  We're through with you  And then he's like  Why  He goes  Nope  Not talking to you  Not bothering with you anymore  They cuff him  Brought him out  They go  We're booking you on murder 
[00:33:30]  He was found innocent in the end  I heard  No  Oh  Not Killa  Not Killa  So getting back to the Gary Coleman  Yes  Gary Coleman's wife  So you're an expert  Because you watch a few of these shows  On TV  I am such an expert on forensics  I am an expert on 911 calls  I am an expert on the post-crime slash accident interview with people that you usually see when children are missing or killed and they go to the guilty parents 
[00:34:00]  You can tell when they're lying  You can tell when they're lying  Just shit like this  Expert  And this woman  Gary Coleman's wife  Ex-wife  Whatever the fuck she is  Who doesn't like blood  We learned yesterday  She don't like the blood  She didn't want to help Gary Coleman  Taking care of loved ones  She didn't want to help Gary because there was too much blood around  Too much blood at the scene of Gary's head injury  I guess she didn't really listen when the priest said for better or worse  Or worse  She thought worse was  What do you think worse means?  Look at him  Worse was right there at the fucking 
[00:34:30]  At the altar  You kind of blew it with the worse part  Worse was the second they took their vow  She looked at him and went  This is about as bad as it's going to get  I'm married to a midget  I'll bring you some ginger ale when you're not feeling good  Because you have a little fucking flu bug or something  She married an angry broke midget  Right  And that to her was the worst thing  Worse could be some horrific stuff  Of course  When they say for better or worse  It could be some sick ass shit  And some blood spewing out of his head 
[00:35:00]  After he allegedly smashed it on the floor  But you're saying a frying pan from her might be more logical  I am not implicating her in any crime  I understand that  I'm just saying the circumstances  And all of this put together  Are a bit suspicious  A little suspect  With everything  Her 911 call  The circumstances of him  Having this head injury  In the first place  Then her making the decision 
[00:35:30]  To pull the plug and kill him off  What a perfect crime  Just and not having him maybe  Regain consciousness  And say  Hey the bitch hit me on the head  With a frying pan  What a perfect crime  Of course it is  This horse tooth bastard  What did you say  This horse tooth bitch  She looks like a cross between  Molly Ringwald and a horse  And a horse  And she really does  Has a little Tiffany in her too right  Yeah  Was Tiffany the red headed brud  Yeah yeah  That was her  Yep  A little bit  A little bit of Tiffany  Yeah looks a little like her 
[00:36:00]  So then she gave an interview  We got the interview  And it was on TMZ  And wow  All I saw was  A woman  Here's what I saw  A woman  Who committed  A horrific  Murder  Trying to talk her way  Out of it  And doing a poor job  See cause I've seen a lot of that  On these shows  Right  And to me  She looked exactly like that 
[00:36:30]  In your opinion  In my very educated opinion  On  What do you think's going on  Post murder interviews  What do you think's going to end up happening  Someone's going to start looking into this  Really  If they aren't already  Very casually  You know what  You know what I mean  The casual detective  Just kind of snooping around  Just a little bit  One of these detectives  That said  You know  Something just didn't smell right here  So I looked a little deeper  I talked to some people  Maybe there were problems 
[00:37:00]  Between the two  Maybe there was  Physical conflicts  Between the two  Over the years  Maybe Columbo  Yeah  Some kind of Columbo thing  You know  Pardon me ma'am  I found a frying pan  With some  Little afro hair in it  Can you explain that  Um  I was cooking  Uh  Uh  Chicken  And you know how it has the feathers in it  Of course  Miss Columbo makes it every so often  And yes  I'll leave you alone now 
[00:37:30]  With your grief  You are feeling grief  Aren't you  This woman can't feel grief  He never leaves him alone  He always says he's going to leave him alone  But he always says one more question  One more thing  Are you half horse?  Oh wow  Holy shit  The ABC mystery movie  A Quint Martin production  Tonight  Columbo  Was that a Quint Martin production?  The case of the tiny negro  Ha ha ha ha 
[00:38:00]  Starring Gary Coleman  As Gary Coleman  I used to hate  When they did that  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  It's just a bloody frying pan  On the floor  I'll leave you to clean up  Your pots and pans  Miss  Well  Why don't we play  Some of this audio  Yeah  This is uh  Gary Coleman's wife  Speaking out  Speaking out  When she should have  Probably shut her mouth  I've had a lot of  Speculations out there  I've had a lot of people  Sit there and say 
[00:38:30]  Yeah she pushed him  This and that  You know  People are so cruel  They don't even know  I was upstairs  He was downstairs  Okay look  Yeah that's how you  Push somebody  Let me see  If you push somebody  Guess what  You're gonna  You're gonna stay upstairs  And he's gonna be  Downstairs  And when you're  Coming up  The fuck  When the first thing  Out of your mouth  Is an alibi  Right  You know  It's like  This is what  Everyone used to do  On an episode of Columbo  People used to do this 
[00:39:00]  All the time  It's like  Well I just can't understand  Why there are footprints  Outside the window  And they're your footprints  From your shoes  Well Lieutenant  It's easy  My gardener  Was wearing my shoes  That day  His got wet  With the sprinkler  And I gave it to him  And oh  So you're saying  Your guardie went yardie  Yes my guardie went yardie  And I  You never try to explain  When people are accusing you 
[00:39:30]  Of something  What you didn't do  That is rule number one  Amazing  But she is  Right away  Look  Hey  The people are accusing me  I wasn't even near the guy  I was upstairs  He was downstairs  Well that's  Yeah  That's  Not letting you  Getting you off the hook  That you could have possibly  Pushed him down  After he tumbled down the stairs  Right  She was upstairs  Still  He was on the floor pleading  You know people are so cruel  They don't even know  I was upstairs  He was downstairs  How am I going to push him 
[00:40:00]  Oh my god  Seriously  You know that affected me  More than anything  Because the scrutiny  That just people come up with  They're just heartless  More than anything  The scrutiny  Not  Not him being dead  How can I push him  She  She is  Covering  Like  What good is it going to do  If I push you right here  Yeah  What does that do  I just fall on the floor  You wouldn't even fall on the floor  You would be  Pushed back a little bit  Maybe hit a wall  If you're going to push someone  We all laugh  If you push someone 
[00:40:30]  You want a ledge  You want  The rim of the Grand Canyon  You want a cruise ship  Top of the stairs  She thinks she made the right decision  Pulling the plug  Because otherwise  Gary would have been  Like  And I won't say the name  Because this is  Just amazing  This is a brilliant statement  By this woman  You know the doctors told us  That you know  Even if they had done surgery on him  He would have died  He would have bled to death  During the surgery  And they said  Even if they did take a chunk  Out of his brain 
[00:41:00]  He would not be the same  He would be basically  Like Muhammad Ali  He wouldn't be  You know  And  And I mean  He would have died  Sooner or later  Anyway from that  Okay  Hey look  He died sooner or later  I gotta stick up for  The great one  Muhammad Ali  Is completely there  People know that right  He just can't communicate  He just can't communicate  That's a lot different  Yeah  Than what  What Gary Coleman  Would have been  This woman  He would have been like  Muhammad Ali  Muhammad Ali 
[00:41:30]  The fucking  Things crystal clear  And he'd have died anyway  He'd have died anyway  So I figured I'd just  Kick the cord out the wall  Right  You know  The second he started going  She  She took  She took a pen  She took  Beep  That's it  Yep  Alright Gary  She can't sign those papers  Quickly enough  Unbelievable  Oh my god 
[00:42:00]  And then finally this from her  I don't want people to be so hard on me  Thinking  That you know  I had to pull the plug too early  He wouldn't have made it anyway  His heart would have just given out  And I don't want people to sit there  And think I'm  A bitch  And that I didn't care about  She's more concerned about  What people think of her  Yes  She's not grieving  I don't hear any grieving  There is not  An ounce of sorrow  In this woman's voice  Her eyes weren't even  The least bit red  That perhaps  Or swollen  That she had been crying 
[00:42:30]  Beforehand  There was no indication  That she gave a flying fuck  About Gary Coleman  Or what happened to him  It was all about her  And this is one of those  Personality traits  Where if you see  Like a mother  That  Murdered her children  And they interview the mother  Before they find the children  And they have some kind of a story  They can't muster up tears  Is a huge thing  And they put the whole thing  On themselves  And how bad it is  For them  And this is what 
[00:43:00]  This woman's doing  Unbelievable  Yeah  And I don't want people  To sit there and think  I'm a bitch  And that I didn't care about him  But you know  Be in my situation  I mean look what happened  With Terri Schiavo  I always think of her case  Always  When it comes to this  So do we  I mean  Gary was gone  His eyes were dilated  He wasn't  He you know  He was  He was just gone  She's a doctor now  And you know  He's done a lot for me  He bought me a car  Which 
[00:43:30]  He chose to do  Which  I never  Asked him for  And I thought  That was  Very sweet of him  To do that  She's a lunatic  She's covering  For the car purchase  Right there  Cause they'll be like  So uh  You got Gary  To buy you a car  What'd you do there  Like recently  Yeah yeah  It's like  You bought you a car  Did he  Did he want to buy you  That car  What are you doing  What happened in that house  What happened in that  You know  Once  Look 
[00:44:00]  Things happen  Things happen  That's all I'm saying  You have watched  Too many of these shows  Things happen  Accidents  Maybe  Rage  We understand  He wasn't the easiest  Person to live with  Look  We understand that  And um  We know  What happened  We just want to hear  Your side  We're helping you out here  Is what we're doing  So  You talk to us  We can help you  We know what happened 
[00:44:30]  Why don't you tell us  What happened  Your side  Why do they fall for that  Every time  Why do they fall for that  The dummies  Lawyer up your shithead  Why  Why would you fall for that  Oh my god  I love it  Why would you fall for that  Oh is that the best  And they do  They start putting their head  In their hands  They rub their face  And then they just go  Could I at least get a soda  They just want to trade 
[00:45:00]  Their freedom for a soda  At that point  A little lunch  A cigarette  Yep  Jimmy James  Morning boys  Good morning  Hello  I just picture  I just picture  That this woman  Tried every cartoon  Method possible  To kill Gary  Cartoon method  She was leaving  Roller skates  At the top of the stairs  Banana peels  Right  Yeah  Very good brother  That's great  I like the Jimmy James call  And Anthony  Wow I haven't heard this yet  Let's go to Steve in Florida

[00:47:30]  Gary Coleman's coffin  Already has his name on it  One  Coleman  And then they have  The Coleman cooler  The first one that tweeted that  Was Gary Busey  I follow him  But is it the real Gary Busey  Does anyone know  Maybe his name is  The real Gary Busey  Is the real Gary Busey  But he tweeted that first  Hate when people have to put the real  Because somebody's being an asshole  Gary Busey's one of the best ones  To follow on Twitter  Is he real  I don't know  If he's not  It doesn't matter  Because whoever's doing that account  Is doing a good job 
[00:48:00]  Of imitating his lunacy  Has some great stuff  Yeah absolutely  Let me say hi to Tom in Utah  Tom  Hey there Tam  Hey gentlemen  Good morning  Good morning  After further investigation  Of Gary's death  We've determined that  The ex-wife had placed a quarter  At the top of the stairs  And when Gary bent to  Pick up the quarter  She proceeded to  Push him down the stairs  Yes  We fingerprinted the quarter  And lifted her fingerprints  From the quarter  And 
[00:48:30]  What is he getting at  After bribing her  With that same quarter  She had confessed to the crime  Punching out  You can't punch out  You can't punch out  Of a crater  Of burning jet parts  You know what I was doing  I'm going in  You know what I was doing  During your phone call  I've been doing radio  Since I was 18  And I'm thinking to myself  What type of radio  Would enjoy  Tom from Utah's phone call  Yes  We certainly didn't enjoy it

[00:49:30]  Hey buddy  Hey you missed one thing  If he bought her a car  Then how come  In the 911 tape  She said she couldn't drive  Because she would have seizures  Yeah she did say that  Anthony  She can't drive  Because she gets seizures  She can't fucking touch  Gary Coleman  Because she doesn't like blood  Exactly  Alright boys  Run her down  Yes  Good job  Good job  Thanks  So you're thinking  That this  This is  Not a  Not a closed case  I'm thinking  Some detective  Somewhere  Is thinking 
[00:50:00]  Ah  We better just  Take a little  Just  I'm going to take  A little closer look  Just a little  And then they get  What is called  Their hunch  They go  I had a hunch  I had a hunch  And then they  They pursue it a little  And realize  Because this woman  Is no brain surgeon  Although she talks  Like one  Knowing exactly  What Gary Coleman  What his problems were  When his heart  Would stop  That his pupils  Were dilated  She knows all  The lingo  Most people's 
[00:50:30]  Pupils are dilated  On the weekends  Right  Get well  They've had a frying pan  Put over your head  Right  It'll dilate your pupils  Well she went to  Medical school I think  Yeah  And you know  She'll say  Something stupid  She'll trip up  If she was  In any way  Responsible for this  She's not going to  Pull an OJ  And get away with it  Poor Gary Coleman  Little  Old Gary Coleman  She  Even though 
[00:51:00]  They were divorced  She was allowed  To pull the plug  There was some kind  Of thing  They knew that  How is that though  They were divorced  In 2008  So why was she  Even in the house  Imagine  Your ex  Whether it's a girlfriend  A wife  Or something  Imagine any one  Of your exes  Having the authority  You'd be in there  For a checkup  Right  And fucking  You'd be with your  General practitioner  As he's got a stethoscope  On your chest  And she'll come in  Kill him  Right  Just kill him  Hey I only broke  My leg skin  What are you doing

[00:52:00]  Decision  Yeah there was  There was something  With a life insurance  Policy with me  Where  You know  I had some  Life insurance  And it was in  Somebody  Let's just say  Somebody  Was the beneficiary  Of this thing  And had to be  For a few years  I never got life insurance  For that reason  I know where you're  Going with this  But I had to  Because my paranoia  I'm like  I don't fully trust anyone  Oh I know  Right

[00:59:30]  Look at that pelican  Are pelicans supposed to be that guy  Pelican no  God is fucking mad  If you don't believe in God  If you don't believe in God  You're an asshole  I think we've messed with the portal to hell  Like it's a mile down  And it's five miles in the ground  And it's just fucking  And we breached that portal to hell  And now it's pumping out evil  We all thought it was fire  Yeah  But those dumb Arabs  That wrote the bible  Yeah  They just said fire 
[01:00:00]  Be more interesting  But it was really oil  It's oil  The devil's just an oily  Yeah  An oily messy evil thing  It's a big oily bird  Yes  I can't wait  Till he flies out of the ocean  Oh like the fucking kraken  He's gonna come out covered in oil  2700 gallons  I was gonna say  2700 gallons a minute  Yeah  It's flowing out of the air  I don't even understand  How much that is  But if you had 2700 gallons  You can't clean that up  Of a truck  Just by itself  2700 gallons  2700 gallons of oil 
[01:00:30]  That you and some friends  Were driving around  And just dumped it  In a river  You destroyed  That river  You would be prosecuted  To the fullest extent  Of the law  You killed everything  In that fucking lake  If you did that  Every minute  Every  A conga line of trucks  Is driving into the gulf  How many dead dinosaurs  Died right there  It must have been  Gwillions of dinosaurs  Gwillions  That just got  They must have  It must have been 
[01:01:00]  A super bowl party  Where those dinosaurs died  Gwillions  Oil  Won't stop flowing  Out of that fucking border  No they cannot stop this thing  They can't put the cap on it  Why are we moving on  From the fire  They need the  Fire hurricane thing  Dude  It's  It's gonna happen  Fire hurricane  It's gonna blow  Oil  Everywhere  Yeah  Oh man  Would that be something  Pure crude  Just oily  Oily  Gunk  Fucking  Ten miles inland

[01:02:30]  Petro  Petropolis  Petropolis  Yes  I can't wait  Cause this is just  It is  We deserve it  We fucking  Deserve it  It's fucking  Disgusting  We've opened it up  We deserve that shit  It's gonna  How many days  It's been leaking  For 40 something  50 days  Almost 50 days  Right  Yeah  Hey Dr. Kaku  Was on Oberman  Last night  Will he call  Our show today  What is he saying  Michu Kaku  Was on Oberman  Last night  Thank you Dave C 
[01:03:00]  Talking about  Nuclear hurricane  Oil spill  If they used  A nuke  To stop the oil spill  Are they  Are they talking  About nukes now  They could not  Possibly  This is not a movie  They would never  What would a nuke do  What do you mean  They would never  It would blow  A giant hole  In the ground  You know what they are  This would be called  Day 50  Of Operation Hope Stop  They don't know 
[01:03:30]  What to fucking do  Why  I don't  Understand  They don't  Know what to do  They can't  Figure out  How to fucking  Close this pipe off  They're hoping  It stops  There's little robots  Down there working  Their little robot  Asses off  Doing what  Cutting the pipe  Because the pipe  Was a jagged edge  So they're trying  To cut it  So they could fit  A cap on top  And they can't do that  The saw got jammed  And then got unjammed  And they  They cut it  But the edge 
[01:04:00]  Was jagged  Like there's just  A problem at every turn  With this thing  We have a lot of  James Cameron's  Calling them assholes  And they don't want  To listen to James Cameron  No  Maybe  Maybe get his friends  From that fucking moon  Just give us  Seven, eight hundred  Giant blue people  To fucking clog it up  Hey  I gotta go to the phones  We have a lot of truckers  Hold on  You wanna see  What Jimmy  Hold on  Morning to you  Funny people  Morning  Alright so this is  Not a funny matter  At all  What's going on  Down in the gulf  But the president  Has been accused  Of not showing 
[01:04:30]  Enough emotion  Eight  Is that a fair assessment  No  I mean  People always  Bond over anger  More than they do  Over what they love  And so I think  You just  We want  The president  To be impassioned  About it  And I think he is  But he needs  To just act logically  Out of  The best actions  To take  Rather than  Just emotionally  I totally get it  Jim some people  Said that he was  More impassioned  Listening to Paul  McCartney  Perform at the  White House  The other night  Than he has been  About the gulf spill  How would you respond  Well I think  First of all  We're all a little  Uncomfortable that  My shirt's open  Far too wide 
[01:05:00]  He's the president  It's like  What do they want him  To do  You know  Shake his fist  And drop the F-bomb  You know  He's supposed to  Handle things  Tom cool and collected  A very good point  But Tom  Even Spike Lee  Who was an ardent  Supporter of President  Obama  The other day  Said hey  If you're gonna get  Mad about anything  This might be it  And you're shocked  That I disagree  With Spike Lee  No I have to agree  With what everyone's  Saying  There's no reason  That he has to get  Angry 
[01:05:30]  Because what's gonna  Happen when they  Plug the spill  Are we gonna say  Oh you're not happy  Enough  You need to celebrate  With us  It's ridiculous  I think a lot of  People are thinking  About the images  They saw of President  Bush down in the pit  At 9-11  And that was  An image they could  Embrace  And maybe hold on to  It would be hard  For Obama to stand  On the oil spill  In the middle of the ocean  Like how the media paints  He could at least try  He could at least try  No but the last time  Our president reacted  Emotionally  We wound up in two wars  Alright we're gonna  Leave it at that  But we're not gonna  Leave our comedians  Because they're gonna 
[01:06:00]  Talk about this  Vice President Al Gore  What really broke up  His marriage to Tipper  Wasn't President Bush  That's the ugliest  Pretty woman I've ever seen  And the driver blows  Through the  Watch that  Through the toll  The whole thing  Caught on camera  Right back  What do they do  Are they kind of  Ripping off Red Eye here  I don't know what  They're getting like  Topics and comics  To kind of talk  About the topics  And  Why do they have  Comics on these shows  Hold on  Patricia's just like  Why do they have  Comics on these shows  Like for 15 
[01:06:30]  It's like  Alright funny guy  Topic guy  And it's just like  You know  Amy Schumer's  You know like  You know the world  It's like  You don't have enough time  Like if she had  10 minutes  She could be funny  And go the world  Right right  With 30 seconds  It's like  You know what  Norton did  It's like  What they want you to do  Yeah just  Go find yourself  A little bit  And then she goes  And then moves on  To the next one  For his 20 second  Take on the whole thing  You're right  Long form  It would be 
[01:07:00]  A good watch  A good view  You can  Expand  I was saying  We have a lot  Of truckers  They're going to  Explain how much  Oil is spilling  In the gulf  We got Scott  In New York  Because you said  One tanker truck  Or whatever  No I mean  I'm just saying  I don't know  How much  2700 gallons  Well we're going  To find out now  Scott go ahead  What it is  Is that  Your average  Tanker truck  Like fuel tanker  Holds 6,000 gallons  Of diesel fuel  Or oil  Gas  Whatever they're  Hauling in them  And Patrice said  That thing's pumping out 
[01:07:30]  Like fucking  30,000 gallons  A minute  2700 gallons  2700 gallons  A minute  2700  Yeah roughly  Oh 2700  Yeah  Yeah  Oh well still  That's one full  Tanker truck  A minute  That's two  According to you  Yeah  A minute  What the hell  Are you talking about  You said  Wait six  Oh no no no  That's half a  Tanker truck  All the math  Half a tanker truck  A minute  So half of those  Big things  A minute  A minute though  A minute  That's it  So every two minutes 
[01:08:00]  It's a full  A full tanker  Of fucking oil  Is pumping out  Of that ground  Every minute  Everyone's like  How are they going  To clean this up  How are you going  To clean up  That much oil  How  It's funny to me  How you could  Clean up all that oil  You ever see  One of those things  Tip over  In the fucking highway  The highway's closed  Yeah  Till tomorrow  Forever  Yeah  They gotta clean  That shit up  Off the ground  With brooms  With shit  With brooms  Kitty litter  Vacuums  Kitty litter  And brooms 
[01:08:30]  What the fuck  Are they gonna do  It's a mile  Under the water  I don't know  It's a mile  Under the water  What the fuck  Are they gonna do  Do you understand  What I'm saying  This is the  This is not even  Let me tell you man  This is why  There's three comics  On this fucking show  In the morning  Right  Cause they cannot  They keep showing  The sad music ducks  Yeah  But they are trying  To take away  They're trying to  Make it a duck thing  And this is bigger 
[01:09:00]  Than the ducks  I have to say  Yeah  This is  This is planet earth  Type of shit  The gulf  Is the ocean  It's the fucking ocean  Oh yeah  Yeah  There's  There's  Bazillions of  Of fucking oil  In the ocean  If this was in the middle  Of the pacific  Yeah  Motherfuckers would  Oh my god  You know  Where this shit  Could possibly disperse  I  I was reading something  That the Exxon Valdez  Still has remnants 
[01:09:30]  Of some bullshit  Some of that shit  See considering  A doctrine  Of proprietary facts  What is it  Well in order to  I thought she was  Coming back with  Jim Norton  What do they do  They got to  Just sit there  While this girl  Babbles  While this pretty  Ugly woman  Is this a practical  Beginning  Or another example  Of more government  Interference  We're back with our  Panel  For a very heady  Topic  For our panel  Of comedians  Tom let me start  With you on this  So basically  What they're saying  Potentially  Is that 
[01:10:00]  Journalism needs  A bailout  Why  I mean  Isn't  First of all  Isn't  The journalism  As a whole  Isn't it supposed  To be  Providing a  Kind of a check  To government  So why is  Government  Interested  In propping them up  Aren't they supposed  To just tolerate them  It's like freedom  Of the press  Is freedom  We're not going  To put you in jail  But we're not going  To bail you out  A lot of newspapers  In trouble right now  Right Jim  Well yeah  They should be in trouble  I mean  It's like the days  Of Walter Cronkite  And integrity  Are over  Really  I mean 
[01:10:30]  These are the same  People who are  Trying to get  Satellite photos  Of Tiger Woods'  Genitals  They don't deserve  A bailout  They've done nothing  But they're tabloids  They should be treated  Like tabloid journalists  They should just  Kind of die  When they die  The trend  The trend of the bailout  Amy  Should we bailout  The media as well  I agree with Jim  I don't think so  It's like  It would be trying to  It's a dying  It's a dying media  It would be like  If we tried to bailout  VHS tapes  You know  It's like  Newspapers  I still enjoy  A physical newspaper  If I need to like  Kill a fly  Or if I'm potty  Training a pet  But I mean  That is a physical newspaper  That is a physical newspaper 
[01:11:00]  And also  I think  You know  People are blogging  For free  What people  Spend time and money  Learning how to do  Legitimately  And I kind of like  Some of what the FCC  Is saying  Because it would  Make liking people  Like Perez Hilton  To an illegal immigrant  Taking a job  From a real American  Alright  So the panel  Seems to agree  On all of this  Jim we heard the news  This week  That Tipper and Al Gore  Getting divorced  I was heartbroken  Sally Quinn  A columnist  Blaming it on Bush  Unbelievably  Do you blame Bush  For the gift  For the gift  For Tipper and Al 
[01:11:30]  Getting divorced  No  I mean look  What kind of a marriage  Can't survive  One stolen presidency  It's so annoying  They blame Bush  For everything  And it's like  I think the problem  Is she was probably  Just so sick  Of the environment  His environmental babble  She's like  Enough  I get it  It's hot  Shut up  Amy from a female  Perspective  What was it  Oh I don't have  That perspective  But I  No I think  You know  Everyone blames  Bush for everything  Like if they can't  Find parking  And I can relate  To that  But I think  The real culprit  Here is global warming  As the globe's 
[01:12:00]  Gotten warmer  Al's gotten colder  And Tipper's sick of it  Tom is there  A statute of limitations  Out there  For when people  Will stop blaming Bush  There should be  A statute of limitations  For playing that video  Of him kissing his wife  I don't want to  See that again  Making out with his wife  I think that's what did it  The way he grabbed her  And made it  I'll never get that image  Out of my head  It's tough  It is hard to leave the brain  Alright real quickly  Where are you all appearing  Since you are comedians  Amy  I'll be at the San Jose Improv  June 9th through the 14th  Saturday night at Moonwork  It's hard to find  But those who find it

[01:17:30]  People  200 dead  Did you see that giant sinkhole  In Guatemala  Oh yeah  What is that about  It just  It was another  What's that about  That's God's toilet  He made a toilet  So he could sit down  And read a newspaper  While he's watching  Look at that  It just fucking  Another portal to hell  Jason's laughing at the sinkhole  There used to be someone's house  On top of that  I hope that's Galactus  On the way nigga  Who's gonna get us

[01:18:30]  I think the Russians  Had this same kind of thing happen  And they  You know  Put a  Nuke  About a mile down  In the ground  And blew it  And when it  Went off  It creates  This space  That it just kind of  A big enough space  Where the oil  Will just suck down  Or you know  Just kind of  Gravity will bring it down  Into the ground  It looked like  From what I'm watching  That it crushes  The whole pipe  And squeezes it off  And pinches it off  Yeah 
[01:19:00]  I think  My understanding is  That it created a vacuum  That just sucked the oil  Down  And killed the pressure  Going up  You know  And  And that  That's something  That they've actually  Talked about  Sticking a nuke down there  And doing it  Jesus  Yeah  How do you stick  A nuclear device  Under the gulf  A mile down  Oh my god  And what does it do  What is the nuclear  Thing going to do  It shows in this cartoon  It kind of like 
[01:19:30]  Squeezes off the pipes  It fucking  The pressure just  Collapses everything  See the nuke goes off  And then  It collapses everything  This doesn't seem cool  And also  Collapses the world  Yes  I can't wait  This is great  I'm gonna  I'm gonna fucking go home  And start meditating  Front row seats  About death  The only thing about death  That fucks me up  Is the  Is the infinity of it  Yeah  Colin  Colin Quinn said  It's the infinity  Yeah  If I can get used to

[01:20:30]  Yeah  I think we even do  Anything that  Anything that's been  Alive since  The prehistoric  Motel  True that  True that  I think we fuck  With roaches too  I think  But I mean  We're not making a dent  No no  I'm not saying make a dent  But we fuck with everything  I think some of those  Sea creatures that are  A couple miles down  Where we just can't get to them  To fuck with them  I think there's fucking  Do we even fuck with those things  Those weird fucking  I think there's that shrimp  With flashlights on their head  That fucking  Exactly  That big tooth fish  Yeah with the Christmas light  On his head 
[01:21:00]  Those fucking  Things yeah  I think one day  One of those things  Was swimming around  Looking for shit  And a fucking  Pepsi can  Hit him on the head  And he said fuck this  Just like sunk down  It took years to get there  Oh I sure  Where's all the garbage  Go  From the middle of the Pacific  In a big fucking whirlpool  But we're just  We're don't  We're don't ask  Don't tell  In terms of that shit  Yeah  You know you take a dump  It just goes someplace  It goes somewhere  We don't know  I don't care  Dude  It's out of my house  We deserve this  We just deserve  Earth getting revenge 
[01:21:30]  On us somehow man  You think it's turning on us now  We've done enough  Don't you think  We've just done enough damage  You don't think  Yeah you go to some places  It looks pretty pristine  You know  Rich people  Where they  Where they make sure  That there's no filth  In a 12 mile radius  I mean like  You know  If you ever go to  Yellowstone  Or something like that  Yes  You see like  But Yellowstone  Has a volcano  Getting ready to fucking  Oh I know  Yeah  That will take out  What half the United States 
[01:22:00]  Or something  But that's not us  You know  We didn't fucking  Put that there  But you go there  You know  There's forests and shit  That you can walk through  And go  Wow this is pretty untouched  I think the big problem  Is this  And it's guys like  Kwaku  Over there  Oh  Michu  Kwaku  Kwaku  Years ago  When I was a kid  And they told  They did a thing  About how the sun  Was going to  Extinguish  Yeah  And I said  You know 
[01:22:30]  How do you know  And then  Why are you trying  To know that  It's trying to be God  And I think  That's what  God is mad about  It's just too much  Trying to be God  You think with  With everything  Too much  Even like cloning  Yeah just too much  Things like that  We're getting a little  Too close  God's letting us know  That no matter what we do  We'll open a big hole  In the middle of your  Fucking earth  Trying to be  Trying to be  The daddy  A little too much  Just trying to run shit  That's all  I think that's what it is  It's just like  The sun will extinguish  God's like  How the fuck  What 
[01:23:00]  Nigga I'll turn the sun  Out tomorrow  Wow  Did you run Jimmy  No  Oh look at you  You were just on the TV  Hey I just saw  You were the guy  You were  But I  But you were the guy  Same guy  Same guy  Right there  Same guy  Same guy  Anthony now has a crush  On Amy Schumer  She looked so fucking good  Sitting there  Oh yeah she looks really good man  Yeah  With the curly hair  And the legs  Yeah you ever saw her  Gams before  Nah nah 
[01:23:30]  She came in here once  And she looked good  And stuff like that  But TV  She looked good  And then Patrice of course  Has got to like  Knock me back down  A peg or two  Saying like  He's like  You know  I understand  In the comedy world  She's you know  Who she is  She's hot  She's hot  And everything  But you know  And then he accused me  Of calling Halle Berry  A monkey  Yeah  And in the same breath  I say that  She's you know  Nappy headed pussy  And then  Amy Schumer  You start doing  The fucking soft shoe  On Amy Schumer  I show you  She's a beautiful  Black woman

[01:24:30]  I said they should have  Just had you  If it's a 10-12 minute segment  Just have Jimmy  They're trying it  It's like something  They're trying  That was brand new  It's kind of an experimental thing  So I think that they just  Didn't know how it was  Going to work out  Are they kind of trying  To do a red eye  Segment thingy  You know  Topics  I don't know  But I had a lot more prepared  Yeah  I didn't like just doing  One or two lines  I'm the six line kid  You know that  That's my thing  Yeah yeah yeah  Six line kid  Six line kid  You got your shirt in here somehow  I had to  This looks good with a jacket  But open  I look like a fucking tool 
[01:25:00]  I think I'm the situation  She's like  You think Obama's doing enough  About oil  Hold on bitch  My shirt  Let me get my joke in  After Shalhoub and Amy Schumer  Gave us the fucking  Four score and 20 years ago  You're a  There's not enough time  For that shit  Yeah you gotta just kind of  Jump to it  Yeah yeah  Get right in there  And Jimmy knows this  Because you've done enough of these  Yeah  Other people kind of don't know  And just go on  And then get cut off  Never allow  Allow them to throw a topic to you 
[01:25:30]  But I won't allow them  To throw the exact question at me  Because I don't know  Where I'm going to go with that  It's like  So what's your comment  On Obama's exact comment  Well look  Here's what I wanted to get at  Larry King is irrelevant  Or whatever  You can use whatever they say  Leave me a little  Lateral movement here  I gotta be able to  I gotta work a job  The old tough crowd days  Did prepare my fuckers for  Yeah  For a goddamn shotgun  Extreme interviews  And shit  So what do you think  I don't know  My balls itch 
[01:26:00]  But I'm gonna tell you  Something else  You big face hoe  Why are your arms so wobbly  Go down there  And soak some of that oil  Up with your shoulders  You fucking squishy eyed hoe  Boom  Holy shit  What's your next question  Next  It really does fucking  It's like a boot camp  For fucking doing  Fucking two minute interviews  And Shalhou  Fucking sips his coffee  And takes a drag  Of his cigar  Well see what I was  Shut up  Shudo 
[01:26:30]  Shalhou  Nigga  There's comic  Under your name  Stay home  Say no to something  This is my big chance  To go on Fox and Friends  Say no to something  No that's not my  Up my alley  It's too  It's a little bit too  Rifle  I'm not that kind of guy  I like to  Expound on my  Yeah yeah  I like  I agree with  I agree with Jim  See  People don't  Is this the bitch  From last comic standing  Get your shit together 
[01:27:00]  What the fuck  I don't think  Yuck it up  He didn't  I'll say this  The first segment  With Obama  None of us knew  Really  Yeah  He pushed one  Of the ground zero moment  Believe me  I wanted to get to  I don't want Obama  Screaming  I had some kind of  Carlo Rizzi  From the Godfather  Reference  I don't want to be yelling  Clean it up like  Carlo from the Godfather  Clean it up  But it was just  I should have said that  But I didn't realize  We were going to stop  Like literally that quickly  So yeah  I think threw us all over  The president  That's the worst thing  That can happen 
[01:27:30]  As a president  Because it's something  You cannot control  Is a natural disaster  But this is right in line  With the movies too  Because there's always  A black president  When the world is  Fucking blowing up  It's Danny Glover  Tiny Lister  And fucking Morgan Freeman  Morgan Freeman  And now Barack Obama  Is the real deal  And this is the end  Of the world  God is white  God damn  It's not even that  Bad of a disaster  The planet's kind of  Just taking a liquid shit  Who cares 
[01:28:00]  For now you didn't hear  About the flaming hurricanes  Dude man  We're talking about  Flaming hurricanes now  It is fucking  What if there's a hurricane  See we had the whole scenario  There's a hurricane  It lifts all the oil up  Atomizes it a little bit  In the atmosphere  And then some idiot  Goes to light a cigarette  And woo  You have firecane  That's enough to call it  A himicane  If it's a guy who does it  Oh Chip  Another sign of the apocalypse  Chip Chipperson  And isn't that the hub  Of where all the ships  Kind of go there 
[01:28:30]  Oh yeah  And then  That's where they get  The trucks are  And then  And then they spread  Pipelines  Food  And fucking  And clothes  And whatever  They gotta deliver  That's a major seaport  Is shut down  Yeah  Watch  Watch the prices of food  Watch the price  It's just  And it's some guy  On the top of a building  Jacking his dick  Just  Making a buck  It's the same guy  That was jerking off  After Haiti  Earthquake  He's just like  Oh  Pipes  And  The fucking  The guy that owns  The cement factory 
[01:29:00]  And just  Sticking his own finger  In his ass  Just like  Oh the money  Sorry but it's  The end of the world  Does it matter  Front row seats  It's bad man  It is real bad  We're gonna have  Michu Kaku on  He was talking about  Nukes and shit  Nukes  I just hope  Something happens to him  So he can go  Oh my god no  Oh god no  No god  They'll just plug it  They'll figure out  A way to plug it  That's all it is  Oh really  Yeah of course  And then  What's next though  It's 50 days 
[01:29:30]  It's been 50 days  So what  Do you ever dissipate  There's a few  Dead fish and lobster  That's what  They've been hoping for  They've been like  It can't be that much oil  It's a whole lot  It really is  The earth has a lot of oil in it  How many  I think a brontosaurus  Has gotta be  Oh man  8,000 gallons of oil  Just one of them  Just one brontosaurus  I think one brontosaurus  But that's just it  I think one brontosaurus  Ain't shit  I don't think it's a drop  Of fucking oil  In the long term  I don't think  Like  I think this is  Massive amounts  It was a lot  Of dinosaurs 
[01:30:00]  Massive amounts  Of dinosaurs  And just  Sediment of  Plant life  And everything else  For millions upon  Millions of years  Just sitting there  And now it's just  And we had to poke a hole  We poked a hole  And this sounds like  A real douche question though  But why not sand?  Like  How did  How did oil  End up the shit  That we love?  Sand doesn't burn  Yeah  We need shit that burns  Oil doesn't get your ass crack  While you're fucking on the beach  It will now 
[01:30:30]  You go down to Louisiana  You gotta fucking  We are  An animal  Based on fire  Making heat  And fire  The first time  That caveman  Fucking  Looked at that shit  They went  Yeah  We need this  Fire rules  And we figured out  Better ways  To make shit burn  Longer  And oil just burns  And oil is the shit  Oil just burns  Oil burns  It's great  It's fucking 
[01:31:00]  It's as simple as that  Transportable  We fucking poke holes  In the globe  It's all over the place  And now we're kind of like  Whoops  We fucked up on this one  I fucked up bad on this one  I fucked up Frankie  Would it be better  If this was like  Over there somewhere  We would just be like  We wouldn't give a shit  If it was over there  If this was pouring into  Fucking  Somewhere over  Yeah  If it was in India  They'd be bathing in it  I love this idea though 
[01:31:30]  The end of the world  It's fantastic  It's just interesting boy  To prove these  Goddamn dishwashers right  I thought there was  Some horse shit  These dishwashers  These ancient  These ancient delivery boys  They're fucking  Ancient dishwashers  With their fucking  With their fucking rock axes  And they're fucking  Using ants  To fucking sort wounds  They were right  The first calendar 
[01:32:00]  City of gold  And now they're fucking  Scrubbing my shit  Off a plate  In the back of a restaurant  Lost everything  To Cortez  Yeah  Douchebag motherfucker  And now  It's all heading right  Toward 2012  Isn't it  Dude  This is  With the volcano  And now this  Sighting  When they showed  When the first trailer  Comes out right  For movies  When does it come out  About a year and a half  Before the movie  It's a year and a half trailer  Coming soon  Coming soon  The end of the world  Get your shit ready  Starring Barack  Louis  Hussein Obama  I'm going to trade 
[01:32:30]  Let me tell you  As the president  My garage is going to be  Full of tuna fish cans  Yeah  And beans  Whatever the fuck  Just to sow  Just in case  Ready to go  Just in case  You're going to have  Horrible farts  Yeah  Tuna and beans  Keep them away from my house  God damn  When the fucking  I am legend monster  Start fucking knocking  On my door  I'm telling you  I'm set  My mother couldn't go  She couldn't get  When the fucking  Bacteria was in the water  In Boston  My mom's had to  People panic  And they went out 
[01:33:00]  And bought water  So we panic  And it's going to be  Everybody's going to be  Trying to hoard  It's going to be riots  It's going to be insane  That's going to be great  Insane  Fuck anarchy  All it takes is to  Turn the lights off  For a week  That's all it takes  A week  I'm being nice  No electricity  Over a widespread area  With no food deliveries  No garbage pickup  Cops  And then it's just  Completely insane  Three fucking days  You think three days  I don't think three is enough  Before  Somewhere between  Three and seven  I think three days  And shit starts happening  Let's go five days 
[01:33:30]  People start fucking  Freaking out  Five days  And all hell  No I mean like  You got to understand  Three days  With no hope  Like no one giving you  Hey we're coming to help out  We're doing this  Three days  With like  Uh oh  This shit is going to last  Just basically  If the lights go out  For seven days  And you would assume  They're going to go back on  There'll still be riots  In the street  For food and shit  Oh my gosh  Absolutely  There's going to be  People banging on my door  And I'm going to go  Andy can't wait  Fuck yourselves  Oh you can't wait 
[01:34:00]  You're going to have to get food eventually  Back down the hatches  You're going to have to leave that house eventually  And get food  So what  I'll wait  I'll be like fucking  I am legend  With no electricity  How you going to plug in your guns  Plug in my guns  Because we saw it in Boston  It got a little crazy up there  And the water was bad for what  Three days  Four days  Just when the water's bad man  It got a little crazy up there  And they tell you  They just tell you  What not to do  Right  I just made another purchase  Patrice  Which one  I got the  The Barrett 50 Cal  You got a 50 Cal 
[01:34:30]  The Barrett 50 Cal  The M107  What's on the way  Rhinoceruses  This fucking  Elephants  The shells are this big  You got a 50 Cal  You can hit a target  A mile away  If you're proficient  A mile away  Yeah  Someone actually killed someone  With it  A mile and a half away  Oh that was  Just fucking  Blasted some terrorist's head  He didn't even know  What was happening  He's going to get  In his fucking car  Oh  No no no 
[01:35:00]  Just below  Just below  Big digits  But this thing  Is just a pisser  And the bullets too  You got the bullets  Oh they're like  Four bucks a piece  There I am  Holding it  You're not supposed  To hold it that way  No  So in this store  You had to order this  No it's in the store  It's in the store  I pick it up today  They're putting  The scope on it  And shit  Is that legal  I'm going to  And then where  Are you going to shoot it  It is now  It is now  Where are you shooting it 
[01:35:30]  Hopefully on his toilet  Like fucking  Private pile  I go out to  Calverton  They got about  300 yards  Out there  Which  You know  How far is that  Calverton  Calverton's out  At exit  70  Oh Long Island  Something  Way out at the end  There  Holy shit  So what took you so long  Why this wasn't  On your list  It's been on my list  For quite a while  But I just  Wasn't able to really  Find one  Where is that place 
[01:36:00]  What town  Uniondale  Long Island  That's where you  Kind of need it  Dude that's the bullet  Yeah  Five and a quarter inch  Five and a half  Almost  The one all the way  To the left  The bullet  Is the standard one  That they use  To shoot like  Out of your  You know  AR-15 type rifles  That they use  In Iraq and stuff  And that  Is a .50 caliber  And is that what  They're killing people  With these fucking  Oh yeah  That's the sniper  Drones  Oh no no  The drones  They're shooting  Like hellfire missiles  That though 
[01:36:30]  They're shooting people  In the head with  And just ripping  Their bodies apart  We'll go back  To your gun purchase  In a second  Dr. Michu Kaku  Michu Kaku  Hello  Hi  How are you sir  We saw you on TV  Last night  Talking about the  The oil spill  And we certainly  Wanted to get  Your take on our  Show as well  Considering you're  A friend of the show  Yes now  Using a  Nuclear device  How viable  Is this  It's not  A good suggestion  At all  First of all 
[01:37:00]  It'll make the area  Radioactive  It'll release  Radioactive iodine  Cesium  Strontium  Which will contaminate  The area for decades  If not centuries  Depending upon  You know  The flow of  Motion currents  And during hurricane  Season  You can imagine  That tar balls  Will be shot  Into the air  That are radioactive  Radioactive tar  Yeah  Can you imagine  Radioactive tar balls  Whining up  It sounds like a horror movie  Dr. Kaku  It sure does  Now with these hurricanes 
[01:37:30]  We're going to have  Tar balls flying around  Yeah hurricanes  Will actually  Grab water  Several hundred feet  Below the surface  And loft it up  Into the sky  If a hurricane  Comes into the gulf  From the western direction  They spin  Counterclockwise  So if it's west  Of the oil leak  The counterclockwise  Motion will then  Take this water  Leaded with oil  Lock it into the air  And dump it all  Over the south 
[01:38:00]  Wow  How far inland  Could that actually  Take tar  And oil  Oh potentially  Hundreds of miles  Inland  Hundreds of miles  So people on the coast  That are worrying  And people inland  That are saying  We have nothing to worry about  Might actually have  Something to worry about  That's right  They could have oil  Redoactive oil  Raining down on their hair  On their barbecue pits  On their rooftops  It's going to be  It's going to be a mess  Think of all the lawsuits  Coming out of this thing  Dr. Michio Kaku  What do you think 
[01:38:30]  About this whole thing  Now I know  We've heard your point  On this 2012  End of the world  Kind of thing  We're seeing a lot  Of man-made  And natural disasters  Happening lately  I know you're  A man of science  But spiritually  How are you feeling  About this?  Well look at  Mother Earth  Okay  She rocks the planet  Almost like every month  With a gigantic  Magnitude 7  Even magnitude 8  Earthquake  But they happen 
[01:39:00]  Underwater  They happen away  From the television cameras  So Mother Earth  Rocks  Mother Earth  Gets rocked  All the time  But we never really  Notice these things  Only when we  Only when we get rocked  So we are so arrogant  We're so arrogant  That we think  That when our  Little domain  Is rocked  Then it means  Oh my god  Chicken like chicken  Little  We think that the  Whole world  Is falling apart  Dr. Kaku  Another thing  I want to ask  That I've been  Very curious about  How come a natural 
[01:39:30]  Disaster  Has never caused a  Fissure in the earth  That has leaked oil  Into the ocean  Well they have  I mean in the sense  I mean in the sense  That we've had  A blowout  Like this before  But they usually  Happen at 200 feet  I mean like an earthquake  Let's say an earthquake  Happened  And a couple of  Plates move  And lets out  Some oil  From a deposit  That maybe  Hasn't even been  Drilled  And all of a sudden  You're seeing oil  Spurting up 
[01:40:00]  Into the gulf  Or anywhere else  Where there might  Have been this earthquake  How come that's  Never happened  We haven't seen that  The reason is  The deposits of oil  Are actually pretty rare  You don't find them  Everywhere at all  Only a tiny tiny  Fraction of the earth's  Surface  Actually has large  Deposits of  You know  Commercially viable  Oil  And if you then  Superimpose upon that  The fault lines  The fault lines  You find that  The fault lines  And the oil deposits  Usually don't match  Ah  So we're in a situation  Where we think 
[01:40:30]  There's oil spill everywhere  But actually  If you're a shale oil  Engineer  You know  That only a tiny  Fraction of the earth's  Surface  Has large oil deposits  And they happen  Not to be  Where there's  Lots of seismic  Activity  Thank goodness  Otherwise  Yes that would be  Oil all over the place  You forgot to ask  About the fire cane  What's the possibility  You get a hurricane  It scoops up the oil  Then you get a little  I don't know  Lightning strike  And next thing you know  You got a hurricane  That's on fire  Is this possible? 
[01:41:00]  Well a little bit unlikely  In the sense that  The oil is an oil  Water mixture  Called an emulsion  Some people think  That well  Oil separates  From water  In which case  You should be able  To burn off  The oil  Well that's partially true  But how can we have  So many plumes  Plumes of water  Going down 22 miles  That are 22 miles long  Why is that?  Because water and oil  Do mix  Sometimes  Creating what is called  An emulsion  Look at mayonnaise  Look at lotions 
[01:41:30]  Look at your kitchen  This fucking guy  Is smart as shit  Fuck  You motherfucker  Man  Go on Jeopardy  Nigga  What you doing?  Patrice  Patrice  Jesus Christ  This is  Dr. Michu Kaku  He's a physicist  Oh please  Fucking guy  It's phenomenal  Dr. Kaku  I want to apologize  For  Latrice O'Neal's language  Yes he's  It gets a little salty  It's just prodigious  As hell  God damn  He gets a little salty 
[01:42:00]  With his language  He's a comedian  We don't really know  Much about him  He's playing in the area  He came in to do a set  And I didn't know  He was going to  Use that language  Yes  You've really impressed him  And that's how he  Shows his  That he is  Indeed impressed with you  We apologize  For the language  Yes  Sorry to interrupt sir  Sorry  So it is an emulsion  Like mayonnaise  That will not  Just burn  Randomly  With maybe a lightning strike  That's right 
[01:42:30]  And also by the way  The nuke option  That I talked about  On the Keith Overman show  Last night  Yes  It is also not  Not a good idea  Because what happens  If you detonate  A hydrogen bomb  Underground  Okay what happens is  You create  An underground sphere  A sphere of vaporized dirt  A hollow sphere  The sides  The walls  Of the sphere  Get glassified  Nice  So you have  This glassified  Hollow sphere  Underneath the ground  Which then eventually  Collapses 
[01:43:00]  Giving you a gigantic hole  Now the people  Who want to  Do the oil well  Think that the oil well  Will be glassified  And therefore  Sealed up  But the walls  Are unstable  Eventually the pressure  2,000 pounds  Per square inch  On the bottom  Of the ocean  Will cause a cave in  And then more oil  Will spill out  Potentially  And create even  More places  Where oil can seep  Into the environment  What do you think  About  Are they  Are they  Are they  Going to get it  Cleaned up 
[01:43:30]  Or is the oil  Just going to  Keep spilling out  Like a whole bunch  Of Crisco  Or something  Well let's hope  That the capping  Procedure  Which they're doing  Right now  Even as we speak  Let's hope it works  However a month ago  It failed  Because of methane  Crystals  Right  That got into  The siphon  And jammed it  So now they're  Putting hot water  Hot water  Down the pipe  And we're waiting  And seeing  We're waiting  And seeing  Whether or not  The hot water  Will dissolve  The methane  Crystals  So that  They can  Siphon off  Some of this  Water  Now it's not  A plug  It's a 
[01:44:00]  It's a  Very loose  Fitting cap  So oil  Will in fact  Splur it out  The outside  It's not  A perfect seal  That's why  They have to  Use a diamond  Wire cutter  To get a  Nice clean cut  In order to  Get a nice seal  But you know  We're just  Keeping our  Fingers crossed  Right now  Sir are they  Talking to you  About this  Like are they  Coming to  People like you  To help  Are they  Calling you  Oh put it  Like everybody  And their  Brother  Are making  Suggestions  About how to  Cap that  Well I get  Hundreds in  My emails  However  Maybe these 
[01:44:30]  Procedures  Will in fact  Work  But they  Work at  200 feet  That's the  Key  That's the key  The key  To the whole  Puzzle is  What works at  200 feet  Does not work  At 5,000 feet  Where we have  2,000 pounds  Of pressure  Think of putting  A car on  Every square inch  Of your chest  How long  Would you last  If you put a car  On every square inch  Yeah only a few  Weeks or something  Oh chip  Yeah that's the  Problem  The problem is  High pressure  So all these  Suggestions that I  Get in my email  A lot of them 
[01:45:00]  Will in fact  Work at  200 feet  What's your  Idea sir  Well let me  Give you an example  Okay one person  Said why not put  Tires  Tires inside  The leak  That inflates  Yes we saw that  The pressure  From the inside  Well at 200 feet  It might work  But at 5,000 feet  Where the pressure  Is great  The tires  Will collapse  How do you  Inflate a tire  When the outside  Pressure is  2,000 pounds  Per square inch  Yeah that  That wouldn't work  But what is  Your suggestion  Well my 
[01:45:30]  Suggestion is  That when the  Thing happened  Obama should  Have called out  The navy  At that point  The military  And that's  What I said  And instead  Of putting BP  In charge  He should have  Just removed  Them and he  Should have  Had a panel  Of some of  The best minds  In the petrochemical  Industry  You know when  Gorbachev  Was faced  With the  Chernobyl  Accident  Back in 1986  He had a  Raging fire  At a nuclear  Fire plant  You know what  Gorbachev did  He didn't  Set up a committee  He sent in  The Red  Air Force  Yeah 
[01:46:00]  The Air Force  It was the  Red Air Force  That finally  Stopped that  Raging fire  At Chernobyl  Oh some of  Those poor guys  That's what  That's what  Obama should have  Done  Called in the  Military  Brought in the  Best minds  And then  These procedures  At 200 feet  They all work  He tried  They've tried  Seven procedures  They all work  At 200 feet  None of them  Work at 5,000 feet  How much oil  Do you think  Is there  How much  Oil can you  Possibly think  Is just there  Can it just run out 
[01:46:30]  Possibly enough  To last for years  Can you imagine  This oil well  Spill lasting  For most of  Your lifetime  There's enough  Oil in some  Of these wells  To last a  Lifetime  Wow  So that's why  They're panicking  Realizing it's  Going to get  Into the  Atlantic Ocean  It's going to  Go around the  Tip of Florida  And it's going  To go into  The Gulf Stream  And it may  Even go all  The way back  To England  So British  Petroleum  May get some  Of their oil  Back in their  Backyard  Oh shit  British  British Petroleum 
[01:47:00]  I forgot  That is  British Petroleum  That's right  So what  Are you  British Petroleum  Is that  Some of their  Oil back  And what is  This going to  Do to the  Gulf  In the end  Well hopefully  It won't create  Dead zones  The worst  In the worst  Case scenario  The thing  Leaks for  Months  And years  And creates  Dead zones  Where no  Life can  Exist  In the  Gulf  Already  They partition  About a  Third  A third  Of the  Federal  Area  It's off  Limits  To fishing  A third  Of it  Wow  So we're  Talking about  Large portions  Of the Gulf 
[01:47:30]  Becoming a  Permanent dead  Zone  Unless they  Can cap  This thing  This weekend  You know  The relief  Well  In August  We have  Problems  There  With the  Relief  Well  The relief  Well  By the way  Is the  Gold  Standard  That's  The gold  Standard  Four  Stopping  An oil  Leak  The problem  Is it  Never works  In the  First try  Never  Really  We need a  Lottery  You're drilling  A hole  That's like  Two miles  Long  And you  Want to  Hit  Something  The size  Of a  Dinner  Plate  At two  Miles  Wow  Where does  This rank  Where does  This  Disaster rank 
[01:48:00]  On disasters  Is this  One of  The worst  Of all  Times  Or  There have  Been  Other ones  That were  Actually  Bigger  However  The economic  Damage  The property  Damage  This could  Rank  Perhaps  Number  One  In terms  Of the  Ultimate  Property  Damage  And lawsuits  That it  Generates  But there  Have been  Other oil  Slicks  And oil  Leaks  That were  Actually  Bigger  But not  In such  Sensitive  Areas  That are  Laded  With  Property  With  Fishing  Industry  Yeah  The gulf  Is very 
[01:48:30]  Important  To the  United  States  Of course  Yes  Strategically  Important  For the  Whole  Country  And also  Of course  For the  Whole  Economy  Of the  South  Dr.  Kaku  Our friend  Dr.  Steve  Is a big  Fan of  Yours  And he  Wanted me  To ask  How long  Would it  Take the  Oil  That's  In there  Now  Like how  Long  Would it  Take it  To dissipate  As it  Is now  Oh  That's  Hard to  Say  Because we  Don't  Even  Know  How much  Is down  There  You know  There's  An  Argument  As to  How much  Oil  There  Is  We've  Seen  Plumes  Of  Oil  22 
[01:49:00]  Miles  Long  22  Miles  Long  In the  Gulf  Wow  And so  We're  Kind of  Clueless  As to  How much  Came out  Now  BP  Uses  Satellites  To calculate  How much  Oil  There  Is  But that  Only  Look  At  The  Top  And like  I said  The oils  Large  Amount  Are emulsified  Doesn't  Rise  To  The  Surface  All  Right  Yeah  Submarines  That have  Gone  Down  Have seen  These  Plumes  22  Miles  Long  And we  Now  Realize  It  Could  Be  Five  Times 
[01:49:30]  More  Oil  Underwater  Than  We  See  On  Satellites  Unbelievable  How do  You  Clean  All  This  Up  In  The  End  Well  Like  I  Said  I  Would  Have  Called  Out  The  Navy  You  Know  We  Have  Basically  The  National  Guard  Being  Called  Out  And  We  Have  Volunteers  That  Are  Working  Themselves  To  A  Frazzle  These  Are  Like  Heroic  Volunteers  Working  24  7  I  Say  We  Should  Declare  War  On  This  Thing  And  Bump  The  Military  And  Get  All  Sort  Of  Military  Expert  What 
[01:50:00]  Would  They  Be  Able  To  Do  That's  Different  Though  I  Mean  Aside  Having  The  Unlimited  Resources  What  Would  The  Navy  Be  To  Do  Different  That's  Dr.  Steve  Just  Texted  What  Would  The  Maybe  Be  Able  To  Do  Differently  Okay  Here  Here  Is  The  Key  It's  A  Physics  Lesson  They  Tried  Seven  Things  At  This  Oil  Leak  And  They  Failed  Because  We're  Not  At  200  Feet  They  All  Work  At  200  Feet  Where  Pressures  Are  Not  So  Great  At  5,000  Feet  You  Have  Complications  You  Have  Methane  Ice  Crystals  Forming  You 
[01:50:30]  Have  High  Pressure  That  Will  Blow  Things  In  Different  Directions  You  Have  To  Compensate  For  It  That  Requires  Scientists  Who  Understand  Working  At  5,000  Feet  But  You  See  BP  Has  No  Operating  Experience  At  All  Zero  That  Hardly  Anyone  Has  Any  Operating  Experience  Operating  At  5,000  Feet  Tapping  A  Raging  Oil  Well  That's  Why  We  Have  To  Bring  In  People  Who  Are  Experienced  So  These  Procedures  They  Will  Actually  Work  But  You  Have  To  The  Devil  Is  In  The  Details  The  Details 
[01:51:00]  Of  High  Pressure  That's  Right  Right  So  Eventually  Maybe  The  Same  Thing  Can't  They  Just  Put  A  Why  Can't  They  Just  Put  Something  Around  It  Like  A  Big  Bell  And  Then  Just  Put  A  New  Pipe  On  Top  And  Filter  It  Up  That's  What  I've  Been  Saying  To  Any  Woman  Who  Will  Listen  Loudly  Well  That's  More  Or  What  They're  Doing  Now  That  The  So-called  Cap  Is  Actually  A  Bell  It's  Actually  A  Dome  They're  Putting  On  Top  Of  The  Thing  It's  Not  A  Perfect  Seal  And  They  Hope  To  Siphon  Off  As  Oil  As  They  Can  By  By  Capping  The  Thing  Which  Means  Putting  A  Dome  Around 
[01:51:30]  The  Leak  And  Then  Siphoning  Back  Up  So  They're  Doing  That  Now  Let's  Hope  It  Works  But  Again  I'm  Not  Optimistic  Because  They've  At  That  Altitude  That's  At  The  That  Depth  That's  Where  The  Problem  Was  I  Should  Hour  And  Altitude  First  Why  Do  We  Even  Have  This  Problem  We  Have  This  Problem  Again  Because  They're  Not  Experienced  At  Working  At  5,000  Feet  At  That  Depth 
[01:52:00]  Methane  Gap  That  You  Find  In  Your  Kitchen  Is  A  Solid  Ice  And  Because  It  Is  So  Cold  This  Ice  Will  Actually  Go  Right  Up  The  Can't  They  Just  Have  A  Split  Can't  They  Have  A  Split  Pipe  And  Maybe  Somehow  Filter  At  The  Bottom  And  Maybe  Gas  Up  One  Side  And  Liquid  Up  The  Other  No  It's  All  Mixed  The  Bubbles  In  The  Picture  Were 
[01:52:30]  Methane  Gas  So  It's  All  Mixed  You  Had  The  Mud  You  Had  The  Oil  You  Had  The  Gas  It's  All  Mixed  Together  So  In  Other  Words  It  Was  Methane  Gas  It's  Methane  Gas  In  Solid  Form  That  Could  Once  Again  Come  This  Procedure  Up  You  Have  To  Compensate  For  All  The  High  Atmospheric  Effects  And  That's  What  They're  Slow  To  Do  But  How  Do  They  Get  This  Shit  Down  There  What  Like  They  Got  It  There's  Pipes  And  Shit  Down  There  What  Did  They  Do  How 
[01:53:00]  Did  They  Get  How  Did  They  Build  That  Thing  If  No  One  Knows  About  5,000  Feet  Things  How  Is  There  A  5,000  Foot  Destroyed  Structure  At  The  Bottom  Of  The  Fucking  Gulf  Building  Is  Not  The  Problem  Is  It's  All  Automated  It's  Done  By  Robots  Done  By  Remote  Control  It's  Pretty  Easy  Drilling  These  Things  They  Can  Drill  These  Things  Pretty  Much  Anywhere  The  Problem  Is  You  Have  The  Leaky  Fire  Hydrant  A  Fire  Hydrant  That  Blows  Mud  Blows  Caps  Back  To  Where  You  Started  From  This  Leaky  Fire 
[01:53:30]  Hydrant  Down  There  Is  A  Non  Trivial  Problem  They  Thought  They  Thought  That  What  Works  At  200  Feet  Will  Work  At  5,000  Feet  But  The  Pressure  There  Is  That  Is  The  Problem  That  People  Have  Always  Neglected  And  That  Why  It's  Killing  Them  The  Details  Are  Killing  Them  Right  Now  It's  Like  The  Three  Stooges  Running  Around  That's  What  They  Call  Us  Like  The  Three  Stooges 
[01:54:00]  Oh  My  God  Yeah  The  Three  Stooges  Running  Around  Trying  To  I'm  Saying  No  No  You  Missed  The  Point  The  Point  Is  Remove  BP  From  Leadership  Make  Them  Consult  No  No  You  We're  Talking  About  The  Issue  At  Hand  We  We're  Not  Talking  About  We're  Talking  About  The  Impact  Not  The 
[01:54:30]  Intent  You  Talking  About  Cure  We're  Talking  About  Curing  A  Cold  That's  In  The  Future  I'm  Talking  About  I  Got  A  Cold  Right  Now  The  Cure  For  That  Do  You  Do  You  Know  Much  About  5,000  Feet  2,000  Square  Inch  Pressure  Do  You  Personally  Know  How  To  Deal  With  This  Kind  Of  Stuff  Do  You  Know  What  I  Know  Is  That  You  Have  To  Bring  In  Physicists  Who  Understand  The  Mechanics  Working  At  High  Pressure  This  Is  A  Physics  Problem  It 
[01:55:00]  Not  So  Much  An  Engineering  Problem  It  Is  Physics  As  A  Physicist  What  Do  You  Think  The  Solution  Is  Like  I  Said  Let  Read  This  Again  Let  Let  Read  Again  Until  I  Until  People  Understand  This  Wait  Just  Say  You  Don't  Know  You  Being  Self  This  Is  Self  History  Sir  You  You  Not  Saying  You  Don  Know  You  Refuse  To  Go  I  Don  Know  Just  Say  I  Don  Know  Problem  You  Have  To  Bring  In  The  Top  Physicist  I  Agree  You  Analyze  What  The  Pressure  Is  Like  Otherwise  You  Run  Like  A  Headless  Chicken 
[01:55:30]  What  Do  You  Want  To  Do  I  Don't  Fucking  Know  I'm  Just  An  Asshole  You're  Amazing  I'm  Saying  Do  You  Your  Mind  Is  Amazing  I'm  Saying  I'm  Not  I'm  Not  Inditing  You  I'm  Saying  Do  You  Know  Or  Maybe  Hawkins  Knows  Or  Somebody  Let's  Be  Blunt  About  This  At  The  Present  Time  Nobody  Knows  Because  We  Haven't  Assembled  A  Team  Of  Top  Physicists  Who  Will  Then  Say  This  Is  Not  An  Engineering  Problem  Anymore  It's  A  Physics  Problem  We  Have  To  Work  Out  How  To  Get  This  Thing  Working  At  5000 
[01:56:00]  Feet  Then  Of  The  Seven  Procedures  That  Were  Tried  All  Of  Them  Working  At  200  Feet  Every  Single  One  Will  Work  So  As  The  Top  Physicists  Might  Not  Have  The  Answer  Right  Now  He's  Saying  They  Need  To  Put  Together  This  Think  Tank  And  Figure  This  Problem  Out  With  Physicists  Because  It  Is  A  Kind  Of  A  Lot  Of  Things  With  A  Little 
[01:56:30]  Bit  Of  Fluid  Dynamics  Some  Pressure  Temperature  All  Kinds  Of  Fun  Things  That  Physicists  Like  To  Talk  About  Yes  And  Like  I  Said  Nobody  Knows  How  To  Deal  With  It  Because  They  Haven't  Assembled  This  Top  Panel  Of  People  Who  Will  Then  Take  What  Works  At  200  Feet  And  Extrapolate  All  The  Conditions  That  Are  Different  At  5000  Feet  That's  Why  All  Seven  Procedures  Failed  And  That's  Why  Right  They're  Making  It  Up  As  They  Go  Along  This  Is  Incredible  Making  It  Up  As  They  Go  Along  All 
[01:57:00]  Well  Thank  You  Dr.  Kaku  I  Mean  Hopefully  They'll  Find  Some  Kind  Of  Solution  For  Absolutely  When's  The  Big  Show  Let's  Get  That  Plug  In  For  Everybody  Again  Well  You  know  Sci-Fi  Science  Is  Going  Into  Second  Season  Starting  September  Yep  Very  Good  We  All  Watch  The  Number  One  New  Show  On  The  Science  Channel  And  12  New  Episodes  Starting  In  September  Of  This  Year  Very  Excited  Thanks  Dr.  Kaku  Dr.  Kaku  Thank  you  And  Dr.  Steve  Says  Hello  Yes  Dr.  Steve  Idolizes  You  So  We're  Saying  Hi  For

[02:01:00]  If  Someone  Deserved  A  Day  Off  This  Jim  Joyce  Did  Why  You  Reception  Is  That  The  Ref  Really  Was  Like  He  Dropped  That  Ball  But  He  Just  Felt  He  Didn't  Drop  It  What's  His  Name  Franco  Harris  Where  It  Hit  Off  The  Heel  The  Word  Is  That  He  It  Hit  And  The  Ref  Felt  That  It  Hit  And  That  Fucker

[02:02:00]  That  Will  Tell  Would  Have  Ended  The  Game  It's  Not  Like  Well  There  Was  One  Out  In  The  Ninth  Where  The  Next  I  Could  Have  Homered  Or  Got  The  Double  This  Was  The  Last  Out  Of  The  Sometimes  You  Know  What  Fucking  You're  A baseball  Fan  Right  I  I  Hate  Them  I  Really  Do  I  Hate  Their  Guts  Because  You're  A fan  Though  Yes  And  No  I  Have  Been  My  Whole  Life  But  Name  Three  Of 
[02:02:30]  My  Point  Is  It's  Like  It's  A  Feet  But  I  Think  This  Situation  Makes  I  Think  I'd  Rather  Have  The  Sympathy  Of  Getting  Fucked  Over  As  This  Guy  Especially  If  He  Ends  Up  Being  A  Good  Pitcher  I  Rather  Have  That  Sympathy 
[02:03:00]  Of  Man  You  Know  He  Threw  A  Perfect  Game  If  It  Wasn't  For  Such  And  Such  And  Being  The  Reason  That  They  Now  Implement  Fucking  What  Everyone  Is  Goddamn  Technology  To  Baseball  He  Is  More  Famous  Now  More  Importantly  Kelly  Pickler  Is  Playing  Outside  Of  Fox  Right  Now  Here's  How  Stupid  I  Am  When  I  Walked  Into  Fox  I'm  Like  Who's  For  The  Band  For  And  The  Woman  Was  Like  Kelly  Pickler  I'm  Like  Oh  What  Kind  Of  Music  Does  He  Sing  American  Idol  Broad 
[02:03:30]  They  Yeah  You like  Her  Too  Yeah  I  Think  She's  It's  Pretty  Sad  She's  Performing  On the  Street  We  Park  On  Every  Morning  And  People  Just  Walking  By  Not  Much  Of  A  Crowd  For  Kelly  Pickler  But  Right  Down  The  Block  Justin  Bieber  Is  He  Done  I  Don't  Know  She  Had  Dreads  Right  She  Was  A runner  No  She  Goes  Back  A  Few  Years  Now 
[02:04:00]  Three  Four  years  She  She  Was  That  Dummy  Yeah  Give the  Ump  The  Day  Off  There  He  Chose  To  Come  In  All  Right  Patrice  Says  No  Jimmy  Says  Yes  I  Say  Absolutely  To  Just  Sick  Of  Technicalities  Stopping  People  From  Doing  The  Right  Thing  We  All  Know  What  Happened  And  Yet  They're  Finding  Reasons  Why  Well  What  About 
[02:04:30]  How  About  This  You  Fucked  Up  They're  Fucking  Detroit  They're  Fucking  Detroit  Fans  Who  Sat  Through  That  Game  And  That  Dog  Shit  And  They  Watch  The  Guy  Do  Something  Good  And  It's  Like  You  Want  Baseball  To  Be  About  More  Than  Just  Balls  And  Strikes  Well  In  That  Case  It 
[02:05:00]  Something  Something  Something  Like  Three  Three  And  Half  Weeks  Later  They  Picked  Up  The  Game  Right  Where  That  Whole  Thing  Went  Down  So  It  Has  Been  Done  And  It  Didn't  Set  A  Precedent  Where  Everything  Changed  After  That  But  Was  That  An  Ump  Decision  Thing  Like  This  Was  Oh  Yeah  Someone  Goes  Hey  George  Brett's  Got  Too  Much  Fucking  Pine  Tar  Remember  The  The  Is  Sitting  There  Like  Studying  The  Bat  For  A  While  And  All  A  sudden  Calls  Him 
[02:05:30]  Out  George  Brett  Was  Going  To  Rip  That  Guy's  Head  Off  His  Body  That  Sucili  He  Just  Could  Not  Well  He's  A  Worthless  Cunt  He  Might  Be  I  Don't  Like  David  Stern  Either  I  Don't  I  Don't  Like  Bud  Oh  Bud  Is  Way  Worse  And  Bud  Is  I  Don't  Like  Goodell  I  Don't  Tagliaboo  You  Know  And  Roselle  Roselle 
[02:06:00]  You  Didn't  Know  Tagliaboo  You  Didn't  Like  Cause  They  Just  Did  Good  Shit  It  Wasn't  A  Bunch  Of  Stupid  Shit  That  They  Always  Involved  In  They  Didn't  Make  It  You  Have  To  Reverse  This  One  Too  And  This  One  Was  Really  A  Home 
[02:06:30]  Run  And  Not  A  Foul  He  Just  Can't  Do  It  He's  A  Pussy  Oh  This  Is  Pine  Tar  Free  Run  Homer  Right  Holy  Cow  I  Don't  The  Scooter  That's  A  Home  Run  Call  Right  There  Of  Of  Course  He  Is  Coming  Out  With  A  Drink  I  Get  Back  To  Dugout  And  Everybody  Shaking  My  Hand  Is  He 
[02:07:00]  Want  To  Rip  The  Guy's  Head  Off  His  Home  School  Shit  The  Umpires  Rule  That  Brett  Had  Too  Much  Pine  Tar  On  His  Bat  And  The  Home  Run  Was  Taken  Away  The  Inning  Was  Over  And  The  Yankees  Won  But  The  Ops  Were  Overruled  And  Three  Weeks  Later  1200  Fans  Showed  Up  To  Yankee 
[02:07:30]  Stadium  For  The  Completion  Of  The  Game  Brett  Homer  Made  The  Score  Five  To  Four  But  The  Yankees  Appealed  That  Brett  Had  Not  Touched  All  The  Bases  Yes  He  Did  Said  The  Ops  Who  Presented  Billy  Martin  With  A  Signed  Statement  From  The  Original  Umpires  To  Prove  It  Oh  Shit  Martin  Was  Reading  That  As  He  Was  Driving  That  Was  The  Problem  Wouldn't  A lot  Of  Pine  Tar  Mean  It  Would  It  Would  Be  Detrimental  To  George  Brett  If  It  Was  A  Whole  Bunch  Of  Sticky  Shit  On  His  Bat 
[02:08:00]  I  Think  Even  Worse  Wasn't  The  Pine  Tar  Too  High  Up  Up  The  Bat  Where  He's  Not  Even  Holding  The  Bat  Which  I  Guess  Would  Give  You  Some  Traction  On  The  Ball  Hitting  The  Bat  Is  That  What  They're  Talking  About  Instead  Of  Slipping  Off  Like  One  Side  Of  The  Bat  You  Probably  Get  A  Little  More  Leeway  I'm  Not  Sure  I'm  Talking  My  Ass  I'm  Just  Thinking  You  Got  A  Microphone  In front  Of  You  That's  True  Everything  I say  Is  True  Because  I  Have  A  Mic  So
