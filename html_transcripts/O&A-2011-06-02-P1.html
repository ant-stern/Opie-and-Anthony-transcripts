<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Reg Hugh, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and their infamous, often controversial style, referencing a past FCC violation and suspension.  They briefly wished Stacey Keech a happy birthday before discussing the cancellation of her show and a poorly received joke about someone named "Kareeb."  The conversation transitioned to other cancelled shows, contrasting them with the upcoming appearance of Paris Hilton and a rumored major A-lister. They speculated about questions for Paris, including the whereabouts of a clay Lionel Richie head from a music video (which, surprisingly, had a Facebook page).

A caller, Cooper from China, provided a traffic report, leading to a discussion about time differences and the simultaneous visibility of the sun in parts of both countries. Cooper described working in a Chinese factory, noting his height (six feet) made him stand out. He discussed language barriers, the quality of Chinese food and teeth, and the necessity of a VPN for internet access. The conversation then took a sexually suggestive turn, focusing on Cooper's experiences in China.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a sex scandal involving an attractive 23-year-old teacher and a minor, with the hosts commenting on what they perceived as the leniency of the legal system due to the teacher's attractiveness. This led to a segment reviewing a list of teacher-student sexual relationships from a website, with the hosts using crude language and sexual innuendo to comment extensively on the teachers' appearances and the details of the incidents.  The discussion was filled with interruptions, tangents, and jokes.

Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal was the next major topic.  The hosts shared their opinions on Weiner and played a clip of him angrily addressing the Senate, making jokes about his name and situation. A caller, Rob from Queens, recounted his own explicit sexual experience with his high school English teacher when he was 16, detailing the encounter and its consequences.  The hosts responded with further speculation and jokes.

The show continued with more sexually explicit listener calls. One caller described inappropriate behavior between students and a male teacher in highly offensive and crude terms, with the hosts speculating on the teacher's impending downfall. Another caller, Warner, detailed a graphic sexual encounter with his bus driver, using explicit language and offensive terms.  The hosts frequently interrupted with crude jokes and comments.

The discussion returned to Anthony Weiner, with the hosts playing clips of his interview with Wolf Blitzer. They highlighted Weiner's denial of sending an underwear photo, focusing on his use of the phrase "with certitude" to express his uncertainty. The hosts and a caller named Danny offered theories about the photo's origin and Weiner's motives, speculating about potential additional compromising materials.  The discussion was punctuated by crude jokes and sexual innuendo, with the hosts analyzing Weinerâ€™s responses and suggesting his evasiveness indicated guilt. A technical malfunction in the studio, involving a water spill and damaged equipment, led to further off-color comments and jokes from the hosts, who also complained extensively and profanely about the lack of interns.

The Weiner scandal remained a central theme, with the hosts expressing disbelief at his claim that the photo leak was a prank and questioning his inconsistent statements using highly offensive language. They speculated on the scandal's political implications and compared his evasiveness to other politicians.  A caller, Mike from Chicago, called in to discuss *Breaking Bad*, prompting the hosts to angrily and verbally abuse him for spoiling the show.  The conversation then shifted to Shaq's retirement announcement via Twitter, leading to a discussion of his legacy and comparisons to other athletes' retirement announcements.  The hosts also discussed various other topics, including acid reflux, bowel movements, vitamin intake, the accuracy of futuristic portrayals in movies, and their personal technology habits.  Several calls from IT professionals debated the plausibility of Weiner's hacking claims, offering differing opinions on password security and hacking techniques.  The segment ended with continued discussion of the Weiner scandal, a digression into a Mickey Rooney song, and anticipation for the Paris Hilton interview.  The entire conversation was laced with profanity and vulgarity.

A studio interview with Paris Hilton followed, preceded by discussion of technical issues with the online feed and bizarre, sexually suggestive comments from a producer, Steve.  The hosts made numerous sexually explicit and derogatory remarks about Hilton's appearance and intelligence before the interview. The interview itself was marked by Hilton's apparent disinterest and defensive attitude.  She discussed a stalker incident and her business ventures. The hosts asked about her relationship with Kim Kardashian, her past partying, and her community service, prompting frustration from Hilton, who briefly mentioned a conflict with her porn-writing assistant.  After the interview, the hosts and guest Sam Roberts criticized Hilton's behavior and the interview's outcome using highly offensive language, discussing whether they should have been more confrontational.

Finally, the show revisited the Paris Hilton interview, expressing extreme dissatisfaction with her performance and attitude using highly offensive language.  They detailed their attempts to make the interview work, despite Hilton's perceived poor attitude and lack of engagement, mentioning an awkward autograph request from Jim. They discussed the interview's fallout, angrily reacting to criticism from OutQ, insisting that Hilton was solely responsible for its failure, while acknowledging they could have been more aggressive.  They mentioned the possibility of Hilton's publicist being present and expressed frustration with Hilton's unwillingness to be revealing. Pictures of Paris Hilton, some signed and some not, were shown and discussed. The conversation concluded with continued anger towards OutQ and Paris Hilton, alongside speculation about the reasons behind Hilton's behavior and subsequent interview cancellations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hugh, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just, like, hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. 
[00:01:00]  Real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah.  Morning.  Oh, there we are.  Hello.  Morning.  Yellow.  Yellow.  I want to wish Stacey Keech a very happy birthday today.  Stacey Keech's birth?  I just looked down at our one sheet, and Stacey Keech came in here recently, 
[00:01:30]  gave us a great interview.  He certainly did.  Now he voices the intro for this fine radio show.  Yes, he did.  Unfortunately, his show got canceled that he came in to promote.  What, Kareeb?  Kareeb.  I know.  We didn't ask him about Kareeb.  Oh, I wasn't here.  I'd have been all over Kareeb.  I met him when he came in.  I don't think he knows his stuff, Ian.  You're saying Kareem.  No, Kareeb.  That's not a good one?  No, no, no.  Wow, that was the quickest bomb ever. 
[00:02:00]  I haven't even sat down yet.  How about you sit down?  Shock and awe.  Take a sip of your coffee and relax a little bit.  Kareeb.  Stacey Keech is 69 years young today.  You have to say it that way.  69 years young.  I absolutely thought he was older.  Yeah, I kind of think so.  Do you think he's shaving?  Do you think he's shaving a few years?  Just a bit.  Shaving a couple off the top.  That show Kareeb was on in like the mid-70s and he was like a man.  He wasn't a kid in that one. 
[00:02:30]  I liked Lights Out, too.  I was bummed that got canceled, man.  It's tough to find an audience with.  There's so many channels.  And no one has patience.  A million channels.  Nothing to watch.  What are you going to do?  No one has patience anymore to fucking let these shows develop.  Did you see it?  I really enjoyed that.  We had Hoyt Holton here, the lead, and I liked the show a lot.  I chose not to watch that one.  No?  Instead, I watched the Paris Hilton show last night.  Ah.  Because we have Paris Hilton coming in.  What the fuck happened to us? 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  We're getting real celebrities coming in finally.  Yeah, yeah.  This is one I guess we've been waiting for, huh?  Yeah, for a while.  And then Roland and I were wandering around the neighborhood yesterday, and he's hinting  that there's a big A-lister coming on the show Tuesday.  Oh, yeah.  Did he tell you?  Yeah.  Are we allowed to announce it?  Probably not.  Not yet?  Yeah.  Big A-lister.  It all started with Brooke Shields.  That's what he says.  That was a big one, and I just wanted to take full credit for that.  Brooke Shields turned 46 yesterday.  I just wanted credit for something positive.  Well, there you go. 
[00:03:30]  You get the credit.  She was blowing out candles in the paper this morning.  You know what, I might just want to ask Paris, nothing more than, does Nicole Ritchie know  where the clay head is from Lionel Ritchie's video, Hello, back in the day?  The big clay head.  It's funny because I don't think she gets along with Nicole Ritchie anymore, because she would  have been part of that show.  But she grew up with her, right? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And that reality show they did, I have no problem admitting I liked the Nicole Ritchie  Paris Hilton show.  That whole dynamic?  Simple Life?  Was it called Simple Life?  Simple Life.  I kind of liked it.  It was goofy and stupid, and Nicole Ritchie's a funny man.  But I asked Nicole Ritchie about that when we had her.  Right.  But now I want to know, because if Paris and Nicole grew up together, you know, maybe  she knows where the big clay head is.  Possibly.  And, you know, a little more stories about the big clay Lionel Ritchie head that the 
[00:04:30]  blind girl made in the video.  Is that all you're going to ask her?  Nah.  I'll ask her a few other things, you know.  We've got to ask her about Kim Kardashian.  We'll keep it all on the QT now, you know, because they're listening.  I want it to be, like, kind of spontaneous.  Yeah, they're...  The big clay head.  Supposedly they're listening to us to make sure we're on the up and up.  Wait, the big clay head has its own Facebook page?  Why wouldn't it?  The clay head from the Lionel Ritchie hello video.  8,606 people like it. 
[00:05:00]  Come on.  Wow.  That's great.  That's great.  Look at the big clay.  It looks a lot like Gaddafi.  It does look a little like Gaddafi there.  That's funny.  They're stretching a little bit, but all right.  No, it looks like Jaws from Bond.  Oh, from James Bond movie, yeah.  Yeah, Superman 2.  A little bit.  That's a good one.  All right, well, we have Paris Hilton later.  That's very cool.  Did everyone shower and then put on their nice shirts today?  I was just...  I have a photo with her, and I just...  What? 
[00:05:30]  I don't look good in it.  You look fine.  You do look good in that one.  I look unshaven.  You look good in that one.  My grays are poking through.  Yeah.  How many years ago was that?  I want to say two and a half...  She was being interviewed at the other Time Warner facility, and Iraq called me, someone  over there.  I didn't shave.  I didn't either.  I wanted to think we were rugs rugged.  Yeah.  You guys want to know what the traffic is in China today?  Why?  Why is that?  Because when do you get to take a phone call from China?  Anytime you answer it.  This is still cool shit when someone from a faraway land calls. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  Another year or two.  I don't think it's going to matter anymore, but now it's still cool.  Cooper in China wants to give us the traffic report to start the show today.  Hey, now.  Well, y'all always started out with Anthony's traffic report, and he talks about the Chinese,  and it's out of control over here.  There are no lanes, and...  Obviously, this phone call's not doing well.  But it's China.  But it's China. 
[00:06:30]  If this was Jersey, we would be gone.  Which boosts it up a little bit, yeah.  Right.  If this was Jersey, we would have been long gone.  Yeah, it's all about location.  But it's China.  It's all about location.  I swear.  All right, well...  What time is it in China, Cooper?  Yeah, what time is it?  It's 12 hours ahead.  Six...  Something.  What, it's nighttime or something?  Is it only...  Yeah.  Is it a solid 12 hours ahead?  That's it?  Yeah.  And is it the same day?  Yeah.  It's Thursday, but in like six hours, it's going to be Friday for you? 
[00:07:00]  Correct.  So it's happy hour.  It's 617 in China right now, at night?  Right, but they work till 9 o'clock.  Is the sun still up over there?  Yeah.  How is that possible?  Because we got the sun up over here.  That's crazy.  Well, I'm on the equator next to Hong Kong.  He's getting the sun going down.  We're getting the sun coming up.  Wait, is that possible?  Yeah.  That someone in China and someone in New York could see the sun at the same time? 
[00:07:30]  Is that possible?  Come on.  Yeah, a piece of it.  Yeah?  It's up here.  I would think, right?  How high up is the sun in the sky right now?  The east coast of the United States and the western edge of China, I would say.  Could still see the sun.  Are you on the western edge of China?  Yeah, I'm right outside Hong Kong.  Hong Kong.  Isn't Hong Kong on the water?  Is that on the water?  Yeah.  So that wouldn't be the west?  Whatever.  There's no whatever.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The east.  The east.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  That's a little different. 
[00:08:00]  Wait, so how is he seeing the sun on the east?  If you just said you could see the sun from the west side of China.  Well, I didn't mean the west.  I'm on the east and the sun is still up in the...  It's up in the east.  It's up in the west.  I'm looking...  Well, not in America, sir.  I'm looking at the sunlight map.  California's not seeing no sun right now.  He's in.  He's in?  Yeah.  Are you looking at the map of the world where they show you the sun?  Yes, I'm looking at the world's sunlight map.  Let me see.  It's about an hour left.  Right here.  Here's us, right? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, we just...  And we just came in to the sun and here's where he is.  Holy shit.  That's kind of weird.  And it's like, there's the sun.  That's crazy.  Right there.  That's cray cray.  That is insanity, isn't it?  Wow.  Does he have sun too?  He's working here.  Yeah.  There's the world's sunlight map, Jimmy.  Wow.  I love the world's sunlight map.  Why is the world's sunlight map in the shape of kind of like a cereal bowl?  Like a...  It's because of the sphere shape of the earth.  There's more sun. 
[00:09:00]  When they flatten out the picture, if that was rolled into a sphere, you would see that  that would be a swath.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  The world's sunlight map.  I never ever thought I would use the world's sunlight map in my life.  I've seen them and I've been like, that's kind of cool, you know?  And then the guy says he's in sunlight in China.  We're in sunlight.  Hey, let's see.  That's kind of cool.  Go to the world's sunlight map.  I might have to bookmark this.  And as we look at the world's sunlight map, Africa is baking right now.  Africa just baking. 
[00:09:30]  Africa is right in the middle of it.  A lot of people getting a tan.  Oh, wait.  Oh, boy.  Well, that's...  I guess not.  They've tanned everyone they could possibly tan over there.  Unless they're doing this.  Cooper, why are you in China?  I'm on his back with his hands on his shoulders.  I took a job with a manufacturing company.  Where are you from originally?  What do you manufacture?  Rubber dog shit?  Carniture.  Basically.  Where are you from originally?  Mississippi. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  All right.  That's not much of a culture change, huh?  No, it definitely is.  Holy shit.  Oh, literal Jimmy.  Are you getting Chinese pussy?  Yeah.  Well, it's been a couple of weeks only, and I'm out in factory land.  If you want to go out, you've got to get a car.  It takes about an hour.  Wait, you just got there then for this gig?  I got here middle of May.  Middle of May.  And what happened that you went like, I'll take this job in China?  All of my friends are getting married, and I don't want to, and I didn't, nothing hold 
[00:10:30]  me back.  Wow.  That's kind of a, why didn't you pick something like, I don't know, drilling in Alaska or something?  It's kind of a family connection.  Oh.  You got family connections to China?  Oh.  Well, they have.  Triads.  Yeah.  Triads.  You're a triad?  Triads.  You're a triad, aren't you?  I'd go to China.  When'd you go to China, Ant?  For work?  Like, to live there?  Do you live there now? 
[00:11:00]  Is this your life?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't plan on coming back?  If the company allows it, I mean, there's no opportunities there.  It's all over here.  Do you feel like a monster when you're walking around?  I always wondered that.  How tall are you?  Six feet.  You're six eight?  Six feet.  Oh.  Oh, he seems like he's six eight over there.  I thought I heard six eight.  But I think anyone over six foot in China is considered a monster.  You see them walking through little villages and stuff, and they're way above anybody else. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  What's the average height over there?  It's got to be five four.  Yeah.  Wow.  And you work...  And they stare at you because you're white.  Now you...  Yeah.  Well, you work at a place with all Chinese people?  Me and one other person.  So what about the language barrier?  Do you speak Chinese?  I'm learning.  Two weeks on the job, but I speak a lot with my hands and point. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, God.  You're never going to learn...  You're that idiot.  You're never going to learn Chinese, sir.  Yeah, that's not like Spanish where, you know...  No, kid.  In Spanish, you can almost figure it out.  It's like, all right, I can pick up that word.  That sort of sounds like the American version of the word.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And even with Spanish, they all of a sudden will say Texas or something in the middle of  a fucking Spanish rant.  There'll be a few American words in there.  Huh?  Spanish people don't have personalities, so they don't pull it off well.  You're not going to be speaking chinky anytime soon, man. 
[00:12:30]  Then I'm going to get fired.  Do you drink Coca-Cola over there?  It's cola.  But do the Chinese people come up to you and go, me Chinese, me play joke, me make pee-pee  in your Coke?  Just a couple.  I remember that one.  Remember that one?  Yeah, that one I do.  I love that one.  How are the teeth over there?  I hear they're not good.  They're terrible.  Especially in a factory atmosphere.  I would imagine the teeth are horrendous. 
[00:13:00]  The breath is...  The breath is what?  The breath is worse.  There's a lot of bad breath over there?  Well, because their teeth are rotting in front of you.  Haratosis.  And I have to stare at their mouth to try to learn the language, and I'm just grossed  out.  Wow.  Wow.  And is Chinese food over there like it is here?  No.  I just got served my factory food, and it's...  Factory food?  Chinese factory food? 
[00:13:30]  I ate lunch and dinner at the factory.  You're going to lose a lot of weight.  So, how many hours do you put in at the factory?  Well, they take a two and a half hour break from noon to 2.30.  So, it's 8 to 6.30.  Well, what the hell you do for those...  That's not that bad.  Yeah, but what do you do for those two and a half hours?  Uh, listen to the replay of y'all, or take a nap.  Or look at disgusting Chinese mouths to try to figure out the language.  No, Chinese food over there is way different. 
[00:14:00]  They eat everything.  Yeah, yeah.  They only picked a few things.  Fish heads and shit like that.  All that shit.  They only bring a few things over to America for the Chinese restaurants over here.  What about a billion people there?  They have whatever is available.  Yeah.  Would you like a side helping of shoes?  If you watch any of these food shows, China has some horrendous shit that they eat in China.  Oh, my God.  I haven't seen the skinned dogs hanging from the windows yet.  No.  What about TV?  What is TV like?  Well, I'm trying to get the hotel cable package, but out where I am, they don't offer it. 
[00:14:30]  So, I don't even care about regular Chinese cable.  Chinese cable.  Honestly, I just listen to y'all all night.  Wow.  All right.  And what about internet?  Is it opened?  Can you go to a lot of the sites, or is it restricted from the government?  You have to sign up for a VPN.  What's a VPN?  It's some sort of expat thing you can get, and you can access Google and anything you want. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, because you're a virtual private network?  Is that what it is?  Right, right, right.  And that's for Westerners?  Well, anybody, but I mean...  Yeah, I heard the Chinese youth have figured out how to communicate with each other and get  around the government shit.  A lot of them, anyway.  Do you feel you're being watched by the government a little bit because, you know, they don't want  you poking around?  He's in a stupid factory.  Yeah, but you know...  What do they make, though?  That's what you do.  Yeah, what do you make?  What kind of lead toys do you make?  They're hydrogen bombs. 
[00:15:30]  No, we make furniture for American companies.  American...  Oh, great.  So you're part of the problem.  Great.  Great.  He outsourced himself.  Yeah, you take it.  He outsourced himself.  Yeah, really?  He did.  He's like, fuck this.  I'm outsourcing.  I'm going where the work is.  Yeah, what kind of American are you taking our jobs?  They're not shy to ask how much you make, and I don't want to tell them, and they tell  me, and it just makes me feel terrible.  Do you have money-wise, do you make a lot of money over there?  I mean...  Well, I mean, it's starting out, but everything's paid for, so it's just all... 
[00:16:00]  Everything's paid for?  I mean, apartment...  Because it's commie?  Wait, are you in management?  No, no, through the company.  Are you in management?  You have to have a managerial role, right?  I will be, but...  What do you mean you will be?  You said there's family connections.  Well, he's just not going to start me out at the top.  Right now, I'm quality control, sweating in the factory.  Okay, so you make sure one reg is as long as the other reg on the couches and stuff? 
[00:16:30]  Nail head's got to be straight.  Right, I gotcha.  Are the people nice to you there?  Yeah, I think they like me, or they're quietly making fun of me.  How far from Hong Kong are you?  An hour drive.  Hong Kong, ding dong!  That's what I say.  If you don't know the language, they're making fun of you, sir.  Well.  They're absolutely making fun of you if you don't speak Chinese.  Even over there, the Mississippi accent does not sound bright.  No. 
[00:17:00]  Just kidding, sir.  The ladies love it.  You know what?  What Australian guys do here, I bet you he does over there.  With that Mississippi accent?  They probably think you're this amazingly...  Every guy over there is jet black hair.  What color is your hair?  Oh, I mean, I'm six foot thin.  I got, you know...  It's alright.  I'm doing well.  Oh, the women like you?  Alright.  Alright, bro.  They probably think he's a cowboy or something.  Yeah, they don't.  He probably...  Whatever he wants to tell them, he can.  He can probably walk around with just like a boots and a hat and get laid all the time. 
[00:17:30]  I'm from Mississippi.  I don't own a pair of boots.  You got a big hog?  Well, I'd like to think so.  Over there?  Over there, it's a monster.  Comparatively, you really are...  You're probably a legend already over there.  One guy probably saw him in a urinal and he's a legend in the province.  I like to go to the KTVU.  It's clear his fingers.  Some asshole's going to write a movie about us.  Yeah, like they've never seen someone hold a penis with more than two fingers before.  Right.  Alright.  If you look up the University Games in Shenzhen, I live right next door to that. 
[00:18:00]  That's alright.  We don't need to do that.  Cooper, you rule.  Yes.  First call of the day from China.  That's alright, man.  It started out to be a real dud, but I think it kind of turned around and became a home run.  Yeah, we did alright.  I didn't have any...  I just wanted to call and say I was here.  I really didn't have much.  That's fine.  You're lucky it's China or we would have hung up on you.  Yes.  And we're both seeing the same sun, which I think is kind of fucking weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is weird.  That's kind of weird, I think.  Because California's not going to see the sun anytime soon and they're in this fucking  country, but China's seeing the same sun as us. 
[00:18:30]  I'm trying to wrap my fucking mind around that.  Alright, Cooper.  Thank you, sir.  Alright.  Goodbye, my love.  Let's go to South Carolina.  Closer to home, it's Chris.  Chris.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Welcome aboard, Chris.  It seems that we have a little sex scandal down here with a 23-year-old female teacher.  Oh.  She's semi-hot, kind of blonde, freckled type of gal.  Well, we'll be the judge how hot she is, because we're experts at the teacher having 
[00:19:00]  sex with the students thing.  And we learned many, many years ago, if you're an ugly teacher banging the students, you're  going to get a lot of time.  But if you're hot, you get off.  Is that the same girl?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  We're looking at...  Her name's Abby Kate McElhaney.  McElhaney?  McElhaney.  That's a cute name.  McElhaney.  McElhaney.  McElhaney.  McElhaney.  McElhaney, McElhaney, brother. 
[00:19:30]  McElhaney.  McElhaney.  Whatever, right?  Danny, which one is she?  The one on the right there with the freckles.  Hmm.  Blue eyes, got the blonde hair, but the freckles, there's a lot of freckles going on.  How many years she does?  Which one?  The one on the right.  Does she have big boobies?  She's not bad.  What does she look like?  She looks familiar.  Eastside Dave.  No, she's...  Her eyes are a little creepy.  She has way too much white around the bottom of her eyes.  She's a little bizarre looking. 
[00:20:00]  How does the story go?  How many kids did she bang?  I think just one.  It was a 16 to 17 year old.  All right.  No specifics in the article.  But the parents signed a waiver of prosecution, so the parents don't even want to prosecute.  But of course, the sheriff, local sheriff, he's...  Oh, God.  Another language teacher, too, man.  23 year old Spanish teacher.  But 23 and the kid's 16 or 17?  16.  16?  It's legal.  It's legal here in the South, I think.  She'll lose her job, but she'll probably won't go to jail. 
[00:20:30]  But that's...  I mean, that's tough for a 23 year old teacher.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I think if you're teaching high school kids, you got to be at least 40.  So they're not as tempted as much.  I got in trouble one time for that.  Yeah, you did, Uncle Paul?  Yeah.  What happened?  I said, why two people that like each other should be able to be friends outside his school.  We had a good connection.  Very mature girl.  Mature girl.  What did you guys do outside school? 
[00:21:00]  We made love.  Made love where?  Everywhere.  In the car.  Yeah?  In the battle.  Take the...  Pull the seat out.  And back at my apartment.  Made love.  What kind of apartment do you have?  I have a lovely apartment.  Yeah?  It's a studio.  Was your apartment featured in the New York Post recently?  Yeah, but not for the reasons you're thinking.  No?  Yeah, it was a raid.  A raid.  Somebody planted pictures on it. 
[00:21:30]  They took my hard drives.  You're right, Daniel.  I got to ask you what you think of Wiener.  Anthony Wiener.  Oh, I don't like him.  No?  No, he's disgusting.  Why is he disgusting?  Sending pictures of his you-know-what out.  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  Just show it to him.  Here you go.  Do you do oopsies?  Yeah.  Oops.  Look where I spilled the ice cream.  Oops.  Look, there's a little bit of ice cream on there.  You better go get it.  Oh. 
[00:22:00]  Hmm.  All right, Chris, South Carolina, thank you.  We're looking at her.  She's all right.  She's going to have to do a little time, though.  She's not pretty enough to let off the hook.  No.  The site that I'm on right now, they have a whole bunch of teachers who have, I guess,  fucked students over the last year, if you guys want to take a look.  In the last year, yeah.  Let's take a look.  It's kind of one of my...  It's a pretty long list.  I was kind of surprised how many pictures there were.  It's kind of one of my things, man, because I go back to Harborfields High School and that 
[00:22:30]  French teacher, man, I would have fucking...  I would have went there and I would have shut my mouth.  I was in love with my French teacher.  Same thing.  I would have been one of those kids yapping, because I know they would have told somebody.  These four?  Well, no, there's more than that.  I thought maybe you wanted to start with them and move on.  All right, this chick, Brittany, spelled B-R-I-T-T-N-I, Collips, it looks like, 27.  She's doing a lot of fucking time.  She's got like a mustache.  She is ugly.  Kind of.  She's got a little, little, tiny, I'm just starting to grow a mustache.  Oh, no. 
[00:23:00]  That you see on like 14-year-olds.  She looks like David Spade.  Yeah, looks like David Spade, and she has no chin.  And she has extremely greasy hair.  She looks like the kid, not Bobby from King of the Hill, but his best friend.  Right.  Forget it.  Now, Angela.  Now, Angela.  Oh, you want to start there?  Oh, you want to keep...  Angela's cute.  Angela knew, a little older, 39, but she's all right.  I think she's going to do okay.  I don't think they're going to give her a lot of time.  Do they say what they did? 
[00:23:30]  Uh, well, you want to know for Angela?  Let's see.  She was, uh, arrested.  She taught English.  Uh, there was a tip about an affair between her and she's 39 with an 18-year-old student.  Had the offense taken place.  That's fucking hot, dude.  Mom later, after the teen graduated, she might not have been charged.  So, she was just dumb.  That's fucking hot.  Don't you always feel bad for the husbands?  Like, especially if it's on like a 13 or 14-year-old.  Oh.  Like, your fucking wife dumped you for a 13-year-old?  For a 13-year-old. 
[00:24:00]  Your dick couldn't compete with his?  You would stink.  You know the 18-year-old?  That is terrible.  The 18-year-old could go six to eight times without even blinking.  Yeah.  That 39-year-old had a good time.  Bethel Shepard will do no time.  She's, well...  Mary Fisher's going to be executed.  Yes, she is.  Wow.  She looks like she should have been in deliverance.  Her head.  She looks like if you shave the beard.  She looks like the guy in Death Wish 2 who bronzed and goes, do you believe in Jesus? 
[00:24:30]  Yes, I do.  Wow.  She has those stretchy ears that you see every once in a while.  Stretchy ears.  They're kind of stretchy.  What was her thing?  21 was last month charged with having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy after sending  the explicit text messages.  Fisher, who worked in the special ed department...  Uh-oh.  Wow, she barely looks like she should be...  They respected her.  Exactly.  Okay.  Is alleged to have sent him a photo of her half-naked breast and later slept with him. 
[00:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Who else we got?  Who else pops out?  Oof.  Carrie Schaefer?  What's that?  Carrie Schaefer looks like she should be reading the news.  Yeah.  A biology teacher, 38, was caught in March by police partially naked in a car with one of  her students.  That's fucking hot.  Married mother of two.  Something about that is fucking hot.  Dude, it's amazing.  It's hot, right?  Of course it is.  It's hot because I just think back to when I was 16, 17, I was going to get nothing. 
[00:25:30]  And if one of these 38-year-old teachers came along, I would have had no problem with  that.  Oh, no.  I don't like that.  An arrest report revealed the married mother of two from Kentucky was in a compromising  position with a 17-year-old student.  Yeah, compromising.  In her school.  Police said the windows of the car were steamed up and both occupants were partially closed.  You've got to get a hotel room.  That's fucking hot.  Yeah, what are you doing?  A cheap motel.  Just fuck for 30 bucks.  Don't...  You don't park in the car? 
[00:26:00]  Then you got Gail Gagney, right?  29.  A weight room supervisor was sentenced to two years probation, because she's not that ugly,  after having sex with a then 16-year-old student, both at her home in Bloomington and at a nearby  hotel.  She went hotel.  Yeah, but I guess he blabbed.  You don't must have to.  Oh, my God.  Look at the Roseanne one.  Oh, Deborah Cox.  Deborah Cox is going to fucking do some time.  Yeah.  58?  Oh, yeah.  She's gone. 
[00:26:30]  Let's see.  She's really fat.  I can't read from my angle here.  The teacher's aide, I can see, had been...  Yeah, she became involved with a boy while he was at a high school.  The teacher's aide had been the boy's personal academic tutor for several years before she  was arrested in March for having an alleged sexual relationship.  She's heinous.  She's brutal.  That doesn't go with my fantasy whatsoever.  Want some more?  Yeah.  Ashley Blumenschein, 27, P.E. and dance teacher, was arrested in January behind a department 
[00:27:00]  store.  Perv switches, man.  After police caught her in a car with a 16-year-old boy's student, police believe they had sex  shortly before the officer arrived, and say the relationship may have gone on for more  than a month.  Do you think some officers let some of this shit go?  I think in this day and age, everything is so documented and computerized, it's hard  to.  At one point, they might have...  But I don't know, man.  If you're an 18-year-old guy or a 17-year-old guy, and you're fucking your 25-year-old teacher, 
[00:27:30]  maybe.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  Chandra Frank, I don't think they let go.  Chandra Frank, no.  She's going to do some time because she's ugly.  I'm telling you, we figured this out a long time ago.  Yeah, yeah.  The ugly ones are...  Do time.  She looks like Brian Dennehy.  Physical education coach at high school was charged with sexual battery.  What's sexual battery, Jim?  You hit somebody with your dick.  That's what I always say.  It's assault, almost.  Is it really?  But I think because it was the age, I was a 14-year-old female.  After allegedly fondling a 14-year-old female student on her softball team. 
[00:28:00]  What the fuck?  Nice.  Is softball team just a euphemism for vagina?  Happened at least twice between the dates of blah, blah, according to...  All right.  No, battery is like assault and battery.  It's like some type of a molestation or a bothering, I guess.  Yeah, battery could be...  A buggering.  It's a buggering.  What about Stacey?  Did we do all these sex acts?  Stacey Shuler's pretty...  For a teacher who fucks students, she's attractive. 
[00:28:30]  She's not bad, yeah.  Right.  She faces 19 felony counts of sexual battery involving five male students, three misdemeanor  charges of serving alcohol to underage youths, and more than 96 years in prison if convicted.  Wow.  96?  She was the one having the party.  Oh, God.  One in each hand?  How is it sexual battery with a high school football team?  They can handle themselves.  Wow.  At a little keg party at the teacher's house?  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Fuck.  What do you think happened there?  She just probably drank with a couple of them.  One of them talked, and then he introduced her to the friend, and all of a sudden, before  you know it, she's like fucking Goldie Hawn and Wildcats.  She's doing a rap with her mouth stuffed.  You think she went gangbang?  19 felony fucking counts.  That's a lot, man.  You would have to think at some point she fucked a couple of them at the same time.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's a football team.  Who's not double teaming the teacher over the football team?  Can we go over Courtney?  Courtney Bowles, 31.  A teacher who advised... 
[00:29:30]  These are all in the last year, you said?  That's what it says.  A teacher who advised colleagues on how to avoid affairs with students.  So she was the one...  Oh, she was the one to go to.  Yeah.  Was caught having sex with a teenager in a car.  Bowles was found by a police officer lying naked on top of the boy, who was also naked.  A party consumed bottle of...  A partly, excuse me, consumed bottle of vodka was also found in the car with the couple.  And she was the one that was trying to keep other teachers away from this.  To keep, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  How are you naked in the car with a student with a half bottle of vodka?  How do you think you're getting away with that?  How dumb are people?  I don't know, man.  Dumb.  This is great.  What a great gig she had, though.  She was telling everybody how to avoid it.  She would probably go, what students with large genitals do you suspect?  Can't read all these, Danny, so just pick out some good ones.  Well, this caught my attention immediately.  Marcy Lynn Rousseau, 34, had sex with a 16-year-old student at least 100 times.  Wow.  What a week.  What a week, yeah.  She's going to get a minimum of four years having pleaded guilty to all the charges. 
[00:30:30]  Wait, 16-year-old, so he hasn't even been around a long time, so 100 times, that's probably just one year.  Yeah.  That's probably one year tops.  The Michigan English, oh, you read the rest of this?  Well, it says, the bottom paragraph is good.  It says, her defense lawyer said of the student, he took part in this also.  He courted her, brought her lunch, and brought her flowers.  I can't believe that shit works.  Dude, I used to jerk off to my French teacher every day.  I can't believe I had a shot.  I can't believe it. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, you wonder if you had a shot in high school.  Maybe you didn't, but who had the balls to take it?  Right, because I always just saw that line that you didn't want to step over.  She would always say everything.  Because like Anne said, you have to have the balls to go, you know what I'm going to go for.  Yeah.  What happened with the sister?  Her last name is Killings.  Felicia Killings.  English teacher.  English teacher, arrested in November on allegations of having sex with a 16-year-old student.  Police believe relations took place at the home.  Wow, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  I think Gina Wartring is pretty disgusting.  All right, Gina Wartring, 40, was jailed for five years last September.  Five years.  After admitting having sex with a boy, 10.  Jesus.  At the primary school in Dunham, North Carolina.  The mother of two had faced up to 70 years after being charged with dozens of offenses.  70.  That's a real shot in the arm for the husband.  Yeah, no kidding.  When she fucked a 10-year-old.  Oh, God.  How do you tell your friends like, I just wasn't getting it done?  That's bad. 
[00:32:00]  Kid was.  Oh, God.  No, the worst is Elizabeth Colleen Wallace, 34, sentenced in March to four months for having  sex with a former underage special needs student.  Oh, no.  We know how big their dicks are.  Get us away.  Yeah, that's true.  It came to everyone's attention when they were notified.  When he yelled at holding sparklers.  A concerned family member got suspicious. 
[00:32:30]  Wow, special ed.  And the student was in love with Elizabeth.  Of course.  Of course he was.  I love you.  Yeah, I'll tell you.  Any other good ones?  This is all just in the last year?  She just fed him cookies while she fucked up.  I wasn't expecting to.  Hit the mother load of teachers.  Of hot students.  This is the mother load.  Damn, man.  They keep going or is that about it?  No, that was about it.  Any others?  God, that's great.  I could find some.  I'm sure this happened.  No, no, that's fine.  No, I mean in this little website. 
[00:33:00]  I think we pretty much did it.  I think we got it.  Can we say with certitude?  Certitude.  I cannot say with certitude.  Yes, with certitude.  That's all of them.  Fucking Anthony Weiner.  This fucking guy.  That Weiner is just a...  I tweeted him personally yesterday.  I said, enough.  It's time for your fake apology.  Will you stop already?  It really is time.  It's just time.  For the fake apology.  I need my time.  I need blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The fucking guy sent this picture.  Come on.  It's time.  Part of me wonders if he sent it or if he was hacked, 
[00:33:30]  but he knows what else is in there.  Like, I'm wondering, because of...  He's now saying adamantly, I did not send this photo,  but he knows that it's him.  So I'm wondering, did somebody fucking...  Know why he's saying that, Jimmy?  Because he did a little research and realized  it's going to be hard for anyone to prove that.  Right.  Unless he gets the authorities involved to get the IP address,  but it looks like he's not going that way.  Yeah.  They could find out almost immediately what computer this came from,  but that's why he's not going there.  So if he's not going there, then he could say, 
[00:34:00]  I did not send this picture, and then what?  How are they going to prove that he did?  Right.  He got smart.  I liked him, too.  I watched a clip of him on YouTube yesterday.  Like, I saw a link when I Googled him.  I tweeted the link because it was like him just yelling.  I don't even know if he was right or wrong about the issue,  but he was screaming in the fucking...  I guess he was in the Senate.  I kind of...  I liked it.  Well, there's a House of Representatives, wherever it was.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that one.  I liked him.  I checked it out.  It was hysterical.  He was hotter than a collar, this guy.  You're a gentleman. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, he's...  The gentleman will change.  He's all fucking...  Arms are flailing.  Wow, he was fuming.  We should play this.  Yeah, I don't remember...  We should play this.  He's a crazy person.  Dude, he was screaming.  When that shit happens, you got to just write someone  and get it for the show.  What's on my Twitter from a couple of...  Yeah, let's check it out.  It made me like him because I'm like,  you know what?  I can't dislike this guy.  I kind of liked him before all this because he is very animated.  Oh, he's crazy.  He's cray-cray.  He has a co-co.  People say he should just admit it, 
[00:35:00]  but it's really hard to just come out and admit this stuff  because it can ruin you.  No, I guess I understand that part of it,  but I don't think he's fooling many people.  He's yelling at the Republicans on the health care bill.  Oh, there was no advertising when I saw it yesterday?  Well, wiener is hot right now.  Oh, you know what?  Anything wiener is hot right now.  Vote wiener.  You slap commercials on anything that has to do with a wiener.  Wow, that's actually not a bad point.  I retweeted your wiener video yesterday.  No, no, no, no.  When I caught you in the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  I saw the camera underneath. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Did you get him?  Yeah.  Oh, that's two years ago.  Oh, that one.  I just retweeted it.  And then I got his genitals,  and we had to put a little fucking Jim Norton head on his head.  Yeah.  And Jimmy was very shy.  I was very shy.  I was dropping a deuce.  The last thing you want to do is look at a fucking flip cam.  Dropping a deuce.  There's nothing worse than a flip cam when you're fucking spraying mud.  You were shy and embarrassed.  I was very shy.  You were shameful.  Here he is.  Anthony Wiener ripping apart Republicans on 9-11 health.  Oh, I remember this clip. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Just kind of made the rounds.  Gentlemen from New York, Mr. Wiener.  The gentleman.  Gentlemen's wrecking.  Great courage to wait until all members have already spoken,  and then stand up and wrap your arms around procedure.  We see it in the United States Senate every single day,  where members say,  we want amendments,  we want debate,  we want amendments,  but we're still a no.  And then we stand up and say,  oh, if only we had a different process,  we'd vote yes.  You vote yes if you believe yes.  You vote in favor of something,  you believe it's the right thing.  If you believe it's the wrong thing,  you vote no.  We are following up procedures. 
[00:36:30]  I will not yield to the gentleman,  and the gentleman will observe regular order.  The gentleman will observe regular order.  The gentleman thinks that if he gets up and yells,  he's going to intimidate people into believing he's right.  He is wrong.  The gentleman is wrong.  The gentleman is providing cover for his colleagues  rather than doing the right thing.  It's Republicans wrapping their arms around Republicans  rather than doing the right thing on behalf of the heroes.  It is a shame.  A shame.  If you believe this is a bad idea, 
[00:37:00]  to provide health care,  then vote no.  But don't give me the cowardly view  that, oh, if it was a different procedure,  the gentleman will observe regular order and sit down.  I will not.  The gentleman will sit.  The gentleman is correct in sitting.  He's steamed.  He's correct in sitting.  Obviously not in order.  The gentleman will sit down.  I will not stand here  and listen to my colleagues say,  oh, if only I had a different procedure  that allows us to stall, 
[00:37:30]  stall, stall, and then vote no.  Instead of standing up  and defending your colleagues  and voting no on this humane bill,  you should urge him to vote yes,  something the gentleman has not done.  And then he leaves.  Crazy.  Yeah, but it was about the health care  for the, I guess,  for the 9-11 responders.  I don't know what the procedure was,  but man, he was...  How do you not like that guy?  He was hot.  He was fucking...  How do you not like that dude?  Did you want to say  he was hot under the collar  and then you stopped yourself? 
[00:38:00]  No, I thought I already said  hot under the collar.  I love saying.  You like hot under the collar?  I love it.  I like that one too.  He was steamed.  Hot under the collar.  What is that based on?  I don't know.  That's when you've got to  pull your collar away  and go...  Your face gets all red.  And the heat comes out  from under your tie.  But I'd love to know  who he was yelling at there  because the clip just doesn't show us.  Or what procedure that guy...  Because what he's describing  is somebody who would have voted  a certain way,  but it's...  Because the procedure  he would have voted  when he could have...  Yeah.  Maybe around the procedure.  Call him cowardly. 
[00:38:30]  Cowardly.  How great is that?  Well, this wiener  went on Wolf Blitzer.  He's all over the place  and he's trying to describe...  He's trying to explain himself  and...  Did he go in the situation room  with the fucking music bed under?  Oh, boy, yes.  He was in the situation room.  And boy, what a situation he's in.  Nothing better than a penis situation  that Wolf Blitzer has to get involved with.  Yeah, Wolf loves a good penis skin.  Loves the cock.  Well, we don't know  if he loves the cock, but...  Well, he's...  Did you say...  Oh, sorry, sorry.  On his show yesterday,  he must have loved 
[00:39:00]  Anthony Wiener coming in  and talking about the cock pick,  so I'm just putting  two and two together.  He loves the cock.  You heard it here.  And I said it yesterday,  and I wish I had examples,  but the name always works out  with the scandal.  Ah, yes.  Wiener.  And maybe it could be  a little side bit today  if the listeners can help us out.  There's always something  that happens to someone  and then their name  goes along with what happened.  Yeah.  Susie Cunt.  I remember when she was accused  of showing her genitals  to us of students.  Or that time that I fucking met  that girl,  Becky has a dick. 
[00:39:30]  That's easy.  Why couldn't I do it  better than that?  I love it.  You know what?  We've got to go to Rob in Queens,  and then we're going to go  into Wiener.  Rob ate at rest.  All right, great.  Because Rob had sex  with his English teacher.  No way.  No, he didn't.  Rob.  No way, no how.  Did you want to just be on the radio?  We've got a story here, sir.  Listen, guys,  I'm giving you an exclusive,  and this is absolutely true.  Okay.  And I never told anybody, 
[00:40:00]  especially my parents,  and it's a good thing I didn't,  because otherwise,  this woman's career  probably would have been ruined.  Just don't say her name.  Yeah, don't say any fucking name, sir.  My career's going to be ruined.  No name.  Huh?  No name whatsoever.  Okay.  I was in high school, right?  And I was a sophomore at the time.  And would you believe my teacher,  I'm not going to say who,  she called up  on my mother's birthday  to my house  using the Delaney card booklet  where they got the phone numbers.  And she calls me 
[00:40:30]  and tells me she has a crush on me  while we're celebrating  my mother's birthday.  So what I do  is I take the phone  and I go talk to her.  I'm like talking to her  all night, right?  And the thing about it is...  Hold on.  I got to slow you down.  How old were you?  You said you were a sophomore,  so you were 16 about?  Oh, wow.  I was about 16, 17.  All right.  And how old was she?  She was like 25, 26.  And was she pretty good looking?  Uh, to tell you the truth,  um, she, I mean,  she was okay,  but the thing about it is 
[00:41:00]  she had these big mammoth titties  that I really didn't like  because I liked small.  Mammoth titties.  Huge fucking,  just huge mammoth titties.  What, what 16 year old  doesn't like the huge mammoth titties?  It's when you get older  you start realizing,  okay, relax with the big titty  because they get sweaty underneath.  Like the perky ones.  It was just huge.  But, um, basically it's like this.  Um, like I worked a job  and I'm not going to say  what type of job.  Well, don't do that.  God, don't do that, sir.  No, no, no.  Don't say what type of job.  Why wouldn't you? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, don't say what field.  Unless you're the president  of the United States,  there's other,  there's other people  that do what you do.  I know.  Why don't you be so specific?  It has to be him.  Yeah.  Right.  If I can't tell the job,  I'll just say I was a congressman.  So anyway, um, basically.  Boom!  Be more funny.  This is a rough crowd, man.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Hey.  Like, um, like, um.  This is going great. 
[00:42:00]  This is a rough show  to call it to.  No callers get this much abuse.  The guy has one little  missed joke  because he's a little nervous.  But if he used that line  on any other radio show,  it would get a laugh.  A polite laugh, yeah.  It would get a laugh.  Not a polite laugh.  They would think,  oh my God,  you should be on the Daily Show.  Let's try that again.  Do that again  so we can finally be  a nice radio show?  Yeah, let's be nice.  Okay, okay.  She started coming up  to my job  and she started visiting me  at my job, right?  And I had a female manager  who was...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:42:30]  She started visiting you at your job?  No, I'm going to back him up.  So, we got the back story.  Big tits.  You're 16.  She's 25.  It's your mom's birthday.  She calls the house.  You go in the other room.  Now you're talking to her.  Now continue.  I'm talking to her on the phone.  So, she calls me up.  She tells me she has a crush on me, right?  And she did it  as we were singing  happy birthday to my mother.  That's pretty hot.  Oh, no.  Jesus Christ.  I had no idea what to say  when she said that.  So, I basically said,  oh, well, I have a crush on you, too. 
[00:43:00]  I had no idea what to say.  So, I started talking to her  in my bedroom  and we're just talking and talking  and then she starts  to ask me questions.  She's like, yeah,  how big's your cock?  And this, that, and all that.  And back then,  it wasn't like you had cell phones.  Subtle hint.  How big's your cock?  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, you couldn't take  a picture back then  because this was back in, like, 95.  This was back in the 90s.  Oh, yeah, they had no cameras.  You're right.  Well, you already said 95, you dope.  Yeah, exactly.  It was 95.  I mean, in the 90s.  In the 90s.  Well, so, anyway. 
[00:43:30]  Poor guy makes a mistake.  He's attacked.  So, you're 32 years old.  We're going to figure out  exactly who you are.  Exactly.  And who is this Jezebel whore?  I'll see.  All right, go ahead, sir.  You said you wanted to see it, right?  Yeah.  So, basically, one of the days  when we were in class,  and back then, of course,  there was no security cameras  in the schools, either.  So, back then, when we were in class,  she basically pulled it out  and she just went to work on it.  And the reason why I wanted to call,  I was always waiting for you  to do this, Tom, 
[00:44:00]  because the thing about it is  I think it's wrong  when the females go to jail for this  because boys like me,  we know exactly what we're doing.  And we know,  I wasn't sure of the risk  because, like, recently,  this female teacher thing  has gotten, like,  way out of hand  and now they're arresting,  like, everybody.  But the boys didn't get arrested.  I fucked on her, period.  I fucked in the back of the classroom.  Fucked on.  I fucked in the closet of the classroom.  I fucked in her car. 
[00:44:30]  This, that, and all that.  I was just having so much fun with it.  Keep going.  Yeah, exactly.  Name other places.  It's pretty hot, though.  I fucked up by the glue.  I kind of,  by the pencil sharpener.  Yeah.  I love this dude.  By the pencil sharpener.  I kind of like the story, though.  Yeah, it's hot, man.  She wants to see how big the cock is.  Her husband wasn't getting it done.  Did it fuck you up mentally?  No, no.  Listen, well,  if you want to fuck me up mentally,  well, I'll just say it like this.  Today, I'm an assistant principal.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, that's why.  He can only come on his mother's birthday.  Are you trying to return the favor?  I'm married,  and I'm an assistant principal.  Yeah, but let me ask you this.  Do you get the itch  to maybe go the other way now?  Fortunately, she didn't fuck around,  so I never caught anything.  So I got lucky.  I didn't get anything.  I'm not talking about an actual itch.  Are you getting the itch  as a fucking person  that works in a high school  or wherever you are  to maybe have sex with a student?  Um, well, you know, 
[00:45:30]  I, no, first of all...  Yes.  All right, the answer is yes,  but obviously...  He's got a wiener answer.  So he's 32,  he's an assistant principal,  and he has the itch  to maybe have sex with a student.  Exactly.  See, we're great  at reading between the lines.  Yeah, that's right.  If you knew  a Congressman Wiener answer,  basically, you know,  they dress one way,  but you're allowed to think one way,  but you can't say anything.  Yeah, I got you.  So how did this end  with the teacher  back when you were 16?  Murder, suicide.  Your husband? 
[00:46:00]  Basically, I had my way with her  and for a while,  and then basically,  I just told her,  I was like,  okay, I got to stop seeing you  because it's getting, like,  dangerous.  I don't want nobody  finding out about it  because if somebody found out,  they would have mentioned it,  and then I would have had rumors.  So basically,  the way it went was  I kept my mouth closed  until now,  and now I'm telling you,  so you got an exclusive.  Oh, boy.  Is she still alive?  Regular Ian Halperin.  I know.  Yeah, she is.  We're Twitter friends, in fact.  Oh, shit. 
[00:46:30]  So she's about 50 now, right?  I looked her up, basically,  and now she has her,  I didn't ruin her career  by saying anything,  and now she's married,  she has two kids,  and she just goes about her business,  and we never mentioned it  ever again.  Hey, you thinking of going in there  and maybe laying a little more pipe?  Yeah.  So this guy.  Wait, actually,  I fucked up the math.  She's only 41 now.  Once again, yes, you're right.  Number one, she's old,  and number two,  I really don't like massive pitties.  I want to see what she looks like.  I know you can't say her name. 
[00:47:00]  How can I find out?  I can show you the picture  because it would be too easy.  I can't even...  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I understand.  I wouldn't either.  I'm just trying to cockblock  and get in there.  Wow, so you guys just moved on.  Do you live close to each other still?  Relatively.  I'd say within about seven miles.  And you wouldn't go there again?  Why not?  No, absolutely not  because she had a husband and whatnot,  and I wouldn't even want her  to even mention it to him  because you never know  how people are these days  because the media's always starving  for some bullshit.  You wouldn't get in trouble, though. 
[00:47:30]  I strongly feel that  it doesn't fuck up a kid.  Not a 60-year-old boy, no.  No, but for some reason  it would fuck up a 60-year-old girl.  Yeah.  Well, no, listen, you know...  Maybe not all of them, though.  Right.  This is global standard.  As a male in education,  first of all, men know  when they come in  they can't touch nobody.  Right.  But the women,  I don't know what it is.  Touch nobody.  They're throwing everybody pussy  at this point.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, I guess the guy comes in,  he knows that he can't put  his apiskadeel  in there or anybody.  I love this dude. 
[00:48:00]  Fucked him by the back,  by the water fountain.  By the back door,  by the gym door,  the accordion folding gym doors.  Yeah, I fucked the way  the Jigaboos was smoking  as an animal.  Can you tell you  one last thing, though?  Yes.  A lot of these girls  are so fast at this point  until they do  these nasty things  like they brush themselves  up against the teacher,  the male teacher.  Jesus.  And they do types of shit  that like...  They're ricksin' for it.  What'd you think?  This guy,  it's just a matter of time 
[00:48:30]  before we see this guy  on the front page.  Yeah, they're ricksin' for it.  This guy is itching, man.  Oh, he is.  Perf switch.  He's just waiting for the...  Perf switch is just ready to trip.  He's waiting for the perfect opportunity.  The girl will be staring  up the ceiling terrified  and he'll just be whispering  in his ear,  you kept rubbing against me.  You had to notice  what's going to happen.  I'm still retiring  in about five years,  so basically I don't...  Hey, Rob,  how about you just shut up  at this point?  I know, Rob.  You really are panicking.  I'm even thinking,  just let's save this guy.  Let's save one.  Yeah.  I think if this guy's on 
[00:49:00]  for another five minutes,  we're going to know  exactly who he is.  Yeah.  You're going to give yourself away.  Yes, Rob.  You're probably right.  All right.  Why don't you take a seat  over there by the blackboard?  All right, Rob.  Thank you, buddy.  Good story.  Some interesting calls today.  That was kind of a hot story.  Yeah.  You want a not-so-hot story?  Sure.  Sure.  Let's balance it out.  And then we'll move on  to Wiener.  Warner in Oklahoma,  he fucked his bus driver.  Oh, no. 
[00:49:30]  Warner.  Yeah.  You had sex with your bus driver.  Yeah, I got a...  I ditched my...  I want you to fuck me.  I want you to put this  in your mouth.  Yeah.  Was it the Madison Avenue  bus line?  I got cum on my pants.  Mr. Marshall's going to yell at me.  Now, how am I supposed to meet  Mr. Marshall 
[00:50:00]  with cum on my pants?  Mr. Favish Ham,  I would like my cock sucked.  He's supposed to make me  head dispatcher.  Why don't you just put it  in everybody else's ass  on the odd and even routes?  Well, don't you shut up.  That was from Anthony to me.  He's right.  I love that one.  I know.  And war.  Now, that's very interesting.  Fucking the bus driver.  Mr. Norton,  what a great idea. 
[00:50:30]  When did he say,  why don't you shut up?  Yeah, why don't you shut up?  Don't forget the $50 fine.  Why don't you shut up?  Why don't you shut up?  Why don't you shut up?  That could be my favorite thing  he would say to Norton.  It's fantastic.  Why don't you shut up?  Just shut up.  All right, sir.  So you fucked your  dust briber.  He was my first black chick, too.  Oh, really?  What?  He was my first black chick. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, wow.  All right.  Damn.  All right.  Break it down a little bit.  How old were you?  I was 17.  I was a troublemaker freshman.  And she was the first  shaved chick, too.  Did you say a 17-year-old freshman?  And a shaved black chick.  Yeah, I was a fucking troublemaker.  Bus driver.  I was a troublemaker, man.  I got caught.  You guys didn't.  But anyways,  back to the fucking story.  What did you get caught doing?  Yeah, man.  I got caught fucking a pig  and it squealed on me.  Any more questions? 
[00:51:30]  I knew what you said.  Boo!  Anyway, I did sweat.  Hey, I'm a bird.  Suck it, duck it.  Quack, quack.  Quack, quack.  Quack, quack.  Quack, quack, quack.  I hate you.  What did you say?  I didn't hear what you said, sir.  You fucked a pig or something?  Yeah, I fucked a pig  and it squealed on me.  We don't understand  what that means.  We're from New York.  Figure it out.  Figure it out.  I honestly don't.  Maybe it's your phone,  but I cannot hear a word. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, we're looking for you.  I know you're saying  you fucked a pig.  Yeah.  And?  Well, I'll fix and lose  the call anyways.  Did you fuck an actual pig?  What happened?  Yeah.  What did the pig do  to deserve a fucking?  You fucked a pig and?  What happened?  And we heard you!  You stupid fuck.  I'm sorry I did that.  Okay, sir.  So you have a...  Keep fucking that chicken.  Keep fucking that chicken.  All right.  So I'm sorry.  We didn't mean to interrupt you  with humor,  but go ahead. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, fuck.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  All right.  So what happens?  You're on the bus.  You're 17.  You were just falling off.  Oh.  God damn it.  We actually wanted the story.  We finally all got our rods out  ready to hear the story.  17.  Black chick on driving the bus.  And she was shaved where?  Everywhere.  Mid of your head.  She had cancer.  That's my first shaved chick.  She had melanoma.  She was trying to pay for treatment  by driving a bus.  He fucked a crooked wig off her. 
[00:53:00]  I fucked her  until her wig fell out the wind  and blew away.  It was a fucking  a Shirley Hemphill wig.  He fucked it off her head.  Big fat lady.  Hey, for whoever's in the office,  CNN just had an eyewitness  for the tornado in Springfield.  It was a black guy  and it just felt like  it had potential.  Felt like he was talking.  It felt like it had potential  that he was...  Freaky diggy.  I might be way off.  Fine.  But maybe just rewind CNN 
[00:53:30]  a little bit  if you're in the office  and see what that guy  was talking about.  A little shuggy-duggy.  It looked like  it could have been  a leprechaun situation.  Springfield, Mass, huh?  What a fucking...  Yeah, I saw that.  It was a tornado.  Tornado.  Tornado.  I think one of our fans  actually has a viral video.  He was on 91,  and you remember 91.  Oh, certainly do.  He was on 91  when this fucking thing  pretty much crossed the highway  and I think he's  a big-time fan of the show.  Yeah?  I believe so, yeah.  And the video's doing really well. 
[00:54:00]  Right across the highway,  see the shit flying everywhere?  I tweeted late last night  if you want to check it out,  but...  These tornadoes are crazy  this year, huh?  Yeah, it's getting a little weird.  Crazy.  I wonder if we're going to have  a bad hurricane season.  I wonder if that's going to happen.  I hope not.  Because we...  I got my Adam Banks house again, man.  I hope not.  Oh, really?  Fuck yeah.  That's...  All these weather things going on.  I hope not.  Hurricane season started,  I believe, yesterday, right?  The day before?  June 1st.  Seriously? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It starts June 1st?  Yeah.  It's early, though, right?  So they're only in the A's?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think...  Was it Agnes or something?  I don't even know.  Sometimes they just name these things  and then they go nowhere  so you never hear of them.  True.  And it starts at like C.  You're like,  what, what, oh, oh, oh.  How come they always name  hurricanes after girls?  They used to.  They don't anymore.  I think it alternates now, Chip.  They would be called  hemocanes.  Oh, oh.  Okay, I didn't know  you were going for the big joke.  Hey, why don't we take a break 
[00:55:00]  so we could clear the field  and get into this wiener gate.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  That's right.  We're going to do some wiener gate next  and talk about that tornado  in Springfield.  Why don't you shut up?  That was the great...  Because he would always just chime in  and it was just,  it was such...  Because he would yell everything.  Yeah.  Why don't you shut up?  Oh, is that...  That was my favorite thing  he would do on that show.  Fantastic, man. 
[00:55:30]  Tell him to shut the fuck up.  Another million times.  Of course.  Love him.  And, of course,  Parris Hill later on this morning.  Ah.  Oh, you've got to tell me  who this A-lister,  alleged A-lister is  that might be coming on the show.  She's close, though,  but I'm not going to say who.  It's not 100%.  Not on the air,  but I would like to hear,  you know,  off the air who we might.  No, let's get your reaction.  See if you care.  I don't even know if I care.  I don't that much,  but it's kind of fun to have her.  Let me say.  Eh. 
[00:56:00]  It's still cool.  Yeah, it's, you know,  it's a name.  I've met her, but...  There's a name right there.  Yeah, we're too famous  to care that much about someone.  We're big shots.  Yeah, we're big shots now.  Yeah.  I'd like to get that  Brian Cranston  there from Breaking Bad.  Oh, man,  I'm just not watching Breaking Bad.  I just finished up season two.  Holy fuck.  You're marathoning at your house.  Yeah, yeah.  There's so many of those.  There's plenty of, like, 
[00:56:30]  holy fuck moments on that show  where you're just like,  holy shit,  what the fuck is going to...  It is a cool show.  My eggs look like  the fucking inner thighs  of a fat person.  Oh!  And with that,  we'll be back.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. Serious Maxx.  All right.  We're earning it,  we're earning it,  we're earning it,  we're earning it.  Really fast,  I just want to say  the Canucks won game one 
[00:57:00]  of the Stanley Cup Finals  for the hockey fans out there.  What happened?  Oh, shit,  are we going up the air?  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  Water everywhere.  If anything,  the dump button's gone.  All right.  It happens.  What's that?  They're cleaning up water.  That's okay.  The Canucks scored  with 18.5 seconds left  to beat the Bruins  one zip  in game one  of the Stanley Cup Finals.  It was an amazing game  for hockey fans.  Stanley?  Not so amazing 
[00:57:30]  for Bruins fans,  obviously,  but wow.  Great game.  Great start  to the Stanley Cup Finals.  Never done that.  It happens.  Yeah.  Oh, well,  what are you going to do?  What's that?  I don't know.  Oh, I thought it was me  for a second.  Huh?  Move your toodley-dee horn.  Oh, toodley-doodley-doo.  There's ice on there now.  Do you have more?  Can we have an intern  come in and clean?  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, there's a spill here. 
[00:58:00]  By the way,  was yesterday  like intern day  or something?  Yeah.  New intern day?  Yeah.  Not that we'll see any.  Yesterday was new intern day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a spill here.  I can't be bouncing jackers.  I can't be spilling it.  Just don't punch  his fucking camera off.  What can I say?  Guys love coming on camera  and just jerking off.  People are fucking sick.  People are just disturbing.  Oh, of course.  I thought we were making progress 
[00:58:30]  with the intern problem.  Oh, God.  I guess not, huh?  No, no.  I heard someone  was going to work on it,  but we just missed  another fucking...  A new batch of interns  and one of the high-profile shows  for SiriusXM  doesn't get them.  It's just mind-boggling.  It's really fucking mind-boggling.  There's no reason for it.  And this is all going to lead up  to the end of our contract  and then what do they expect  from us, really?  What do you expect from us?  To stay in this horse shit?  That ain't happening.  To be, uh...  I want to make it perfectly clear  that that ain't happening.  Sorry, I'm just drying the horn. 
[00:59:00]  Is that a slang for something?  Just drying the old horn.  Yeah.  It means I'm getting my ass fingered  by a couple of strangers.  Anyone have an update  on the intern problem?  Because they said  that they were making progress,  but obviously they weren't.  Yeah.  I didn't know  this was going down yesterday.  No.  Fuck.  I haven't heard anything  except for the last,  um, you know,  bullshit meeting.  Roland,  I'm still getting coffee.  Roland has to go get coffee. 
[00:59:30]  Roland's got to go get the coffee.  Skinny.  I'll take it.  Goddamn.  I don't know  what the fuck it is, right?  What, with this place?  Yeah.  Coffee.  What?  Let's see if this works.  La, la, la, la.  No, huh?  My on-off button  doesn't work anymore?  I guess not.  Oops.  How come this box  isn't waterproof?  Language.  Hopefully, by the fall,  we'll have interns again. 
[01:00:00]  Fuck these people.  Fuck you.  Seriously, fuck you.  Enough already.  Everyone was punished.  We told you.  Everyone was punished.  Enough already.  Help us out over here, Henry.  What does Greenstein do around here?  We need some interns.  Can he go upstairs and say,  look, uh,  one of my high-profile shows  needs interns,  so let's get this done?  What the fuck does that guy do  down the hall?  Enough of this fucking guy.  Get us interns.  What do you do every day? 
[01:00:30]  Are we a high-profile show  for SiriusXM or not?  Get us our fucking interns.  Scott?  What the fuck does this guy do?  Not get us interns.  You should have told me  that it was intern day yesterday.  God damn it.  Yeah.  The fuck does he do, really?  I don't know.  Can't get us interns?  And what use are you around here?  Fuck.  I don't even care at this point.  It's insulting, though, dude. 
[01:01:00]  There's fucking shows  that are shitty, shitty fucking shows  that do nothing for this company  except take up space.  They got interns.  Then we got a guy  who's just in our face.  Got it, got it, got it, got it.  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  He wants to meet with us  for horseshit reasons,  and here's a real fucking situation  that he can't even take care of?  What is his use?  God!  The fuck?  Once again, we had a problem. 
[01:01:30]  Something happened.  Unfortunately, it does happen, okay?  Yeah.  Everyone involved was punished.  And this is six fucking months ago.  This wasn't yesterday.  Yeah.  Enough already.  Yeah, what's this prolonged shit?  You punish the people.  This prolonged fucking bullshit.  The probation is over at this point.  When you commit a crime,  you do the time,  and then you get a little probation.  Guess what?  We're past all that.  So get us our fucking interns.  I was listening to Ron and Fez yesterday  on the way home  and intern day, 
[01:02:00]  and they had three new interns in,  and Ronnie's talking to them and shit,  and I'm just like,  yeah, that was kind of a cool part of the show,  being able to talk to them,  see who the fucking goof guy was,  and who the guy you think  might be the responsible intern,  and just interacting with them,  finding out who new people are.  Right.  Because that's really the only  steady influx of new people  that come in  that you're able to kind of  talk to  and find out  a little bit about people.  You get some great bits. 
[01:02:30]  Their quirks.  You get some great bits out of them.  Also, yeah,  do they get coffee  and do shitty fucking tasks  for us?  Yes.  But also,  they do stuff  that helps the fucking radio show.  Right.  And that's where our show's suffering  a little bit,  is there's things,  like yesterday,  I needed Sam to do something,  he goes,  look, I can't,  I'm on the phones today,  because if one guy's out,  then we're fucked.  Yeah.  So there's no one  that could step up into roles,  like we used to have an intern  that would jump on the phones  if we needed one of those guys  to get something real done  for the show. 
[01:03:00]  He'd go to the bottom  of the totem pole there,  and then everybody moves up one notch,  and problem solved.  Fuck,  this guy wants us to walk around  Times Square  with stupid fucking wireless mics,  it's like,  how about you start  with getting us interns  and getting the show back  where it should be,  with everybody in place,  and then we'll go from there.  God,  who likes this guy around here?  Anyone?  All I hear is fucking people  complaining about him  all the fucking time. 
[01:03:30]  I do miss fucking  with them on the air.  David was gold.  I loved David.  I had an interaction  with David yesterday,  You saw David?  No,  no,  I didn't see him.  I had a quick interaction  with him.  As you know,  I've been championing  the cause  of Casey Anthony  and the trial.  Right.  So yesterday,  I decided it was time  to make a Facebook support page.  Did you make that page?  Oh, yeah.  What a piece of shit.  Oh,  what a piece of shit. 
[01:04:00]  What is it?  It's gone now.  Oh, is it right?  Why?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, not only  did I make the page,  but a lot of people started,  it was called  Casey Anthony Freedom.  Why is it gone?  Well,  a lot of fans  of this very program  wanted to get on board  and follow  and leave comments.  Did they fuck it up for you?  No, no.  They actually didn't fuck it up.  All right.  But it's like,  that's preaching  to the converted,  right?  So I decided 
[01:04:30]  I would click on Friends  and then click on Location,  which was Orlando,  where the trial is,  and just start  trying to  befriend  moms.  When you see,  from Orlando,  when you see the profile pic  of a mother  holding a young child,  I would just  please be my friend,  friend, friend, friend,  and just kept nailing those.  And the responses  that I was getting back  they didn't want 
[01:05:00]  to be friends.  And some of them,  whoa, very angry.  Piece of shit.  Why would you  try to be my friend,  you fucking  douchebag asshole.  And then some of our  fans would come up,  language.  It really was.  And it only was up  for maybe two hours.  Who took it down?  I had pictures.  Well, then Facebook  does this thing  where they go,  hey,  I tried to access it  and to edit it  a little more.  And they go, 
[01:05:30]  hey,  by the way,  if you want to  access your page,  you got to put in  a phone number  now to verify  that this is you.  And I'm like,  I'm not going to do that.  So I saw other option.  Well,  if you don't want  to put in a phone number,  take a picture  of a government  identification  with your name  and address on it  and send it to  us here.  I'm like,  no,  I can't do that either.  So I guess  after a while  of not responding  to that,  they shut the page down.  And that's their way  of getting around,  shutting a page down  that, 
[01:06:00]  you know,  you weren't really  breaking the rules.  I have a solution  for you.  What's that?  You needed  your naughty boy phone.  Oh!  A good boy phone  and his naughty boy.  If you had the naughty boy phone.  I didn't have  a naughty boy phone.  Then you could have  done it that way.  He has a live baby phone  and a dead baby phone.  A naughty boy phone  and his good boy phone.  He's got a good boy phone  and a naughty boy phone.  He's got a good boy phone 
[01:06:30]  and him good boy phone.  And him good boy.  So I,  people are getting  so stuck in their  fucking heads.  Oh, it is.  I love that someone  tweeted that the Irish one  was really annoying them.  Oh, yeah, yeah,  the Irish one.  It is fun to sing  because it's more of a  jolly.  He's got a good boy phone  and a naughty boy phone.  A naughty boy phone  and a good boy phone.  Your head's got to move.  Yeah, it's got to move  to the left of the right. 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to do  some more verses  for Drew Boogie.  And we got to  hit our hands.  Yeah, that is a biggie.  That is a good one.  Yeah, so I did that  and one of the invites  that I sent out  because I was just  clicking on people,  you know how you get  the thing,  suggestions for people  to invite?  Yeah.  So I just was slamming  all those  and one of them  was Intern David.  So I get back  a message,  a private message  that says,  I don't just accept 
[01:07:30]  people's invites  if I don't know  who you are.  By the way,  who are you?  So he has no clue  who she is  or anything.  Why would he know  what the news is  and one of the top  stories in the news?  So yeah,  that David.  Your old David.  He was great.  Dummy David.  God, was he fucking great.  We're not going to have  any new Davids  anytime soon  because...  That's the hard part  because who was  the other one?  Who was the guy  that wasn't too bright  that we,  the last one? 
[01:08:00]  Was it?  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz, right.  Love Buzz was fucking...  Love Buzz.  The guy,  please don't fuck  my girlfriend.  Oh, that guy  was great.  It was some good ones, man.  Let's just put it this way.  Someone told me  that Howard's off this week  and he's doing intern week.  There you go.  Oh, really?  If you do a good radio show,  you get some great shit  from interns.  Oh, right.  So it really is taking  a part of our show away  that's kind of important.  But why would you know  that down the hall  when all you do is go,  I got it, I got it, I got it. 
[01:08:30]  And if you wanted to...  I got it, I got it, I got it.  If you wanted to do that,  you know,  reprimand us...  He did.  ...some kind of thing  for a month  or two months, whatever.  We're talking like  fucking six months.  It was before Christmas.  Yes, I believe.  And now it's June, what, second?  Yeah, let's just get some interns.  Enough already.  Let's get some interns in here.  Can we do that?  No, we can't  because we bring this up  every month or so  and then all we hear  is we're making progress.  Well, obviously,  we're not making progress  because now it's too late  for this semester. 
[01:09:00]  Go upstairs to the people  that are stopping us  from having them  and tell them we need them.  That's it.  And what's the holdup  if everyone was reprimanded  and put on notice  and all that shit?  Yeah.  I want to...  Wiener?  Yeah, let's hear Wiener on...  I guess this was Wolf Blitzer.  Wolf Blitzer?  Yeah.  And he was just kind of  hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  Everyone knows the story  by now, hopefully?  Yes.  Representative Anthony Wiener  talks to Wolf Blitzer  about his Wiener picture  that he says he did not send 
[01:09:30]  to a young lady...  a lovely, excuse me,  young lady in Seattle.  But he's kind of  almost fessing up  that it might be him  in the picture.  He's not sure.  What was his quote?  I can't say...  With certitude.  With certitude.  With certitude.  Certitude.  If you use the word  certitude, you're guilty.  You know, I can't say  with certitude.  That motherfucker  got a bad certitude.  You got me certitudes?  My breath stinks.  Pictures can be manipulated.  Pictures can be dropped in 
[01:10:00]  and inserted.  When he got asked  if that was a picture of you.  Danny had a good  fucking theory, though.  I don't know how...  Yeah, we'll get into that  in a second.  Let's play a couple  of these Wolf Blitzer clips  and then we'll discuss.  Did you send that picture  to that college student  in Washington State?  I did not.  She says she never got it  and doesn't know me.  I certainly don't know her.  This seems like it was a prank  to make fun of my name.  You know, when you're named Wiener,  that happens a lot.  We've got 45,000 
[01:10:30]  some odd Twitter followers,  hundreds of people  that I follow.  This seems like a prank  that has gotten  an enormous amount  of attention.  This is the picture.  I'm sure you've seen it by now.  Is this you?  I can tell you this.  We have a firm  that we've hired.  See, when you answer  questions like that,  then the answer is yes.  Sure.  I'll tell you what.  We have a firm  that we've hired  to see if that is  a picture of me.  You know if you took  a picture of your fucking  underwear with your  half-hard dick in it. 
[01:11:00]  It's semantics.  If you, if you,  if you,  you're going to say no to that?  No, no, no, no.  Why would you not  quickly go,  that's not me?  What I'm saying is  he's covering for something.  I don't, like,  of course that's him  and he knows it's him.  But he could say,  yeah, that's my,  that absolutely is me,  but I have nothing  to do with this.  Something is,  my theory is he's covering,  like,  something else  is fucking bigger  that he's worried about.  And I don't know  if it's like he got  pictures of his hard cock  actually exposed  that he sent 
[01:11:30]  to other files.  There's something else.  Oh, could be.  Like, I think he's worried  that if this goes bad,  what it's going to open  is fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  Because why would you,  I mean, I could be wrong,  but it just seems like  he,  someone said that the hacking,  if it was a hacking,  the person who uncovered it  was like a blogger  or something  that had been  fucking with him before.  Fucking bloggers.  But it was the way  it came out  which was kind of suspicious.  The way,  like, the person who uncovered it  or something,  so I'm like,  is he worried about  what else they got  or do they have 
[01:12:00]  other private messages  that he sent?  I was wondering  why everyone was coming in.  Everything all right?  Everything's fine.  All right.  Dandy.  But I think it's his photo.  I think he knows it's his photo,  sure.  Yeah,  just how he's answering the question.  I just think he's worried  that, like,  knowing that that's out there,  he might also know  what else is out there.  Hey, this.  We have a firm  that we've hired to,  I've seen it.  It's,  I've seen it.  A firm that we've hired  to try to get to the bottom of it.  I can tell you this,  that photos can be manipulated.  Photos can be of one thing 
[01:12:30]  changed to look like  something else.  We're going to try to get  to the bottom of what happened.  Maybe just...  How has the photo changed?  You know what?  He's trying to...  What is he trying to say there?  That's more of that smoke and mirrors.  He's trying to say, like,  well, pictures can be photoshopped  and you can do this to...  No one's saying...  What is changing that photo?  Because if you show, like,  a woman or something,  you can maybe change the head  off a fucking naked body,  something like that.  But it's a picture  of a guy's boxer shorts  that might have  a semi-hard on.  That's why I think  he might be covering  for something else.  So what is he saying?  That is a picture 
[01:13:00]  of me in the boxers,  but they made it look like  I have a hard on in there?  What was manipulated?  He's backpedaling.  He might be worried...  Again, this is my only theory  is that he's covering  for what's coming next.  Like, he might know  that there's photos  of his cock  and dirty things out there  that...  It's almost like  he might be setting up  for, like,  the shit that he's afraid  is going to come out  in a week.  Because, like,  pictures can be manipulated.  He might just be  double-talking this one  or he might go,  uh-oh,  this one...  If they got this one,  they have this,  this, and this, too. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, all right.  All right.  I'm going with what you...  All right.  What if that picture  has been sent out a lot?  So now he says,  yes, that's my picture,  and then all of a sudden  people are like,  holy shit,  he sent it here,  he sent it over here.  Right.  Holy...  Right, right, right.  Right?  Maybe he has sent it  to a few people  who go,  I got that same picture  from him.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe that's what  he's worried about.  He knows that maybe  he sent this picture  to a bunch of different places.  Right.  And now he's like,  fuck, if I admit that,  it's going to be...  Other people are going to 
[01:14:00]  come out of the woodwork  and go,  I got that picture, too.  Yeah.  There's something else  I think is...  Not that he would admit it,  but the way he's covering up,  it sounds like somebody  who is covering up for one  because he's worried  about two through five.  So maybe now he's thinking,  okay, it is me,  but if I admit it's me,  people are going to  come out of the woodwork  saying, you know,  this picture was sent  to a whole bunch  of other people.  But at least I could say,  look, yeah,  that picture's been sent  around a lot,  but I didn't send it.  So someone is using 
[01:14:30]  my picture to maybe  pick up bruds.  Yeah,  then he could feel  that pictures can be  taken out or put in  like it was inserted  into his Twitter account.  I'm going with  this picture's been  sent out a lot.  Yeah.  That's my new  fucking take on this.  Yeah, possible.  Very possible.  This picture's been  seen by a bunch of people.  Because it's plausible  deniability.  It's just an underwear bulge.  It means nothing.  Right, but now he's like,  yeah,  someone got a hold  of this picture somehow  and they're using it  to represent themselves.  His wife knows.  Of course she does.  That's just it. 
[01:15:00]  His fucking wife knows.  And that'll fucking...  She may not know  he sent it though.  That'll cause some problems.  She may know  the picture's him,  but she literally,  she may be believing  that it was hacked.  Why is he taking  those pictures then?  Like, that isn't a picture.  Hey, let me take  this picture.  Fuck if it was hacked  or something.  Just the fact that  that picture was taken,  why is he taking  that picture?  Yeah, believe me,  they've had that discussion.  One night I thought  you'd want it.  Yeah.  You're just scrambling. 
[01:15:30]  Nah.  Like, right now  they might just be  in damage control  because she's a political wife.  Yeah.  So she might not be giving him  the fucking husband-wife  grilling.  Like, she may be going,  alright, let's just get this fixed  and I'll fucking kill him after.  It'll look like something else.  We're going to try to get  to the bottom of what happened.  Maybe Jon Stewart last night  had it right, unfortunately.  But we're going to find out.  Look,  this is turned into  this kind of international  whodunit.  What it really is  was, I think, a prank.  I'm treating it like a prank 
[01:16:00]  and trying to get back  to the work I'm trying to do.  I understand you.  You want to pursue the story  and we're going to try  to help you the best we can.  So all Wolf Blitzer  wants to know is,  is this you?  Yeah.  And he's not going to stop.  Well, we just want to resolve it  once and for all.  You would know  if this is your underpants  for a second.  The question is,  I appreciate you continuing  to flash that at me,  look,  I've said the best I can.  He's really starting  to bother me.  He really is.  I appreciate you  flashing that at me.  Hey, if it's not you, 
[01:16:30]  who gives a shit?  Why are you giving  these interviews?  Yeah.  Because you look stupid.  When you answer questions  like that,  it's obvious there's guilt there.  Yeah.  Very obvious.  He's handled this so fucking  badly.  He handled it by doing  all the interviews.  Wow.  Because he's probably  loving that he's getting  a bunch of attention now.  He's handling it poorly.  Terribly.  All these guys want attention.  So he's like,  oh, fuck it,  I'll go with this thing.  I can handle this.  But the fucking media  is eating them up.  Killing them up.  Look, I've said the best I can  that we're going to try 
[01:17:00]  to get to the bottom  of what happened here.  But, you know,  I just want to caution you  and you understand this.  You're a pro that  photographs can be manipulated.  Photographs can be taken out  from one place  and put in another place.  Photos can be doctored.  And I want to make sure  that we know for sure  what happened here.  It certainly doesn't look  familiar to me,  but I don't want to say  with certitude to use  something that I don't know  to be the certain truth.  But I do know  some certain truths here.  I didn't send any  Twitter picture.  The person who allegedly  it was sent to,  this poor woman  who was frankly a victim 
[01:17:30]  in all this,  didn't get it.  She put out a statement  saying as much.  I don't know her.  She doesn't know me.  It seems to me  that this is what goes on  in the internet world,  in the social media world  of 2011,  that sometimes  these things happen.  Is it unplugged?  Of course.  You guys missed that question.  Sorry.  What happened?  You smell it?  A little bit of water  is burned up some equipment.  Spilt into the buttons  that operate, you know,  a certain thing. 
[01:18:00]  Coming in again.  Fucking Jimmy.  Roland just nailed Jimmy.  Just got me so good.  Holy shit.  Best one ever.  Wow, did Roland get Jimmy.  Roland was getting me  a hot coffee,  and when he handed it,  he acted like he dropped it on me,  and I just leaped back  about 10 fucking degrees.  He dropped an empty cup,  but he had it set up  where it looked exactly  like a full cup of coffee  with the little hot protector 
[01:18:30]  cardboard around it  and everything,  and he fumbled it  and dropped it  right in Jimmy's lap.  Jimmy was horrified.  Just as Anthony is talking  about the fucking  stuff burning.  best one ever.  That was good.  Wow.  That was good.  I know that's the real one.  Thanks.  I'm trying to make it  better now.  I know, relax.  You did good.  Dude, my seat is  eight feet from me.  I see that.  You pushed way back.  I didn't know 
[01:19:00]  what the fuck happened.  And Anthony's...  Look at all the water  pouring out of that thing.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, I'm thirsty now.  Holy shit.  Hey, Mars,  I thought these were  low voltage.  Holy shit.  I thought this was  low voltage.  It is totally.  We had to unplug some shit.  So why...  How come it could burn  so easily like...  Oh, fuck!  Something's barbecued  in there.  Smell right in there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Anthony just opened  his asshole  because I know  people can't see.  It's lovely.  Smells like 
[01:19:30]  Casey Anthony's trunk.  P-U.  Got it.  Wow.  That thing  just started  barbecuing.  I'm sitting here  during that clip  and I'm just like,  I know the smell  of burning electronics  and that's it.  Wow.  That's from  the water earlier.  Yeah, that was  from the...  Oh, it's old 
[01:20:00]  Spiller Willard.  I need a bounty.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was bad.  You guys hear  the end of that clip?  No, I heard  up until that poor girl  and then I started panicking.  Yeah, until the place  was ready to burst  into flames.  No worries.  That was when I stopped.  Oh, yeah,  that was a brand new  box, by the way,  because Eastside Dave  ruined the last one  a few months ago.  Do the same thing?  Maybe we need  like a gasket  put around that.  They're going to  make us not be able  to fucking drink in here.  That'll be the next move 
[01:20:30]  they make.  Eastside Dave's punishment  was no more beverages  in the studio.  I've never done that before  in all the years  that I've...  Never!  I do like my water  in a cup of ice.  Maybe a lid is necessary.  But, uh, yeah.  A little sippy lid.  A lid or something.  I don't know.  Well,  missed that clip,  goddammit.  Alright, we'll play the...  Yeah.  We'll play the second half  of it again here.  Um, we'll affirm  that we've hired  to try to get  to the bottom of it.  I can tell you this,  that photos can be  manipulated, 
[01:21:00]  photos can be of  one thing changed  to look like  something else.  We're going to try  to get to the bottom  of what happened.  Maybe Jon Stewart  last night  had it right,  unfortunately.  Um, but we're  going to find out.  Look, this is turned  into this kind of  international whodunit.  What it really is  was, I think,  a prank.  Uh, I'm treating it  like a prank  and trying to get back  to the work  I'm trying to do.  I understand you.  You want to pursue  the story  and we're going to  try to help you  the best we can.  Okay, it's not a prank.  You sent the picture.  No.  Maybe by accident  or something got  fucked up with your  whole Twitter 
[01:21:30]  when you were doing it.  Prank picture!  Prank picture!  Stop using the  prank thing.  Yeah.  You sent this  fucking picture.  Maybe you didn't  mean to send the picture  and you, whatever.  I don't know the details  but stop already.  And it is you.  You didn't even  answer it again.  Again.  Again he didn't  answer it.  Every time he doesn't  answer it,  just reinforces  that it's him.  Here's the theory  that Danny is not  in the studio  but he came up  with the idea.  He said what if  it was  an auto 
[01:22:00]  fill?  Like what if  he was going to  send it to somebody  else in a PM  accidentally  had it open to  because you know  Joe Rogan has done  that.  Where he's meant  to PM somebody  his phone number  on Twitter  and he actually  had to change  his number  because he sent  it out regularly.  He sent it out  over Twitter.  That happens  because the window  looks very similar.  Very similar.  So what if  he was entering  somebody's name  and fucking  the auto fill  and it hurts  and he just  didn't realize  that he had  filled it out 
[01:22:30]  to the wrong  person and sent  it.  Like he might  have done  two things  wrong there.  Being distracted  he might have  done it a bunch  of times before.  So I asked  Daniel like  that's a great  theory.  Can we get  an alphabetical  list of his  Twitter followers  or who he's  following and  if you look  at ones  that are  close to  what her  name was  just a theory  you may find  the person  that he was  attempting to  send that to.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  That was a  brilliant idea.  I don't know  if it's accurate  but even if  it's wrong  it's still 
[01:23:00]  a fucking  smart thought.  He obviously  didn't answer  and this is  where we were  when the whole  water thing  happened and  the coffee  thing happened.  It's called  the water  incident.  It's Watergate.  Yes.  The coffee  gate.  Water.  You know  he gave me  the wrong  fucking coffee.  Wolf pushes  the issue  of whether  or not  it's a picture  of him.  That's all  Wolf wants  to know  in the  situation room.  He's trying  to get to  the bottom  of the  situation.  Well we  just want  to resolve  it once  and for  all.  You would  know if  this is  your underpass  for a second.  The question  is this  I appreciate  you continuing  to flash  that at 
[01:23:30]  me.  Not answering.  I've said  the best I can  that we're  going to try  to get to  the bottom  of what  happened to  you.  I just  want to  caution you  and you  understand this  you're a  pro that  photographs  can be  manipulated  photographs  can be  taken out  from one  place  and put  in another  place  photos  can be  doctored  and I  want to  make sure  that we  know for  sure what  happened here.  It certainly  doesn't look  familiar to  me but I  don't want  to say  with certitude  to use  something that  I don't know  to be the  certain truth.  Dude I know  my underpants  I know what  I look like 
[01:24:00]  in my underpants.  You remember  taking the  picture.  Is he taking  hundreds  thousands of  pictures of  his dick  where he's not  sure if that's  what.  And I think  his underpants  are not like  the run of the  mill top  No they're not  run of the  mill undies.  They're not  your foot of  the looms.  Something else  is what he's  worried about.  He has sent  this picture  out a lot.  That's very  very possible.  That is my  fucking new  theory.  Or there's  one that is  him full body  in those  underwear in 
[01:24:30]  the same  account that  got hacked  if it was  hacked or  there's one  with his  fucking cock  popping out.  There's  something else  he's worried  about.  He has sent  this picture  out a lot.  It's not  even that  good of a  like he  doesn't look  like he  has a big  dick at  all.  Which are  the ones  he rejected  to send  a girl?  That's not  a good  photo of  a cock.  That's  very  unimpressive.  You can't  even tell  it's weird.  You can't  even tell  if it's  hard honestly.  No it  looks like  it's plump  because is  that the  head of  it at  the end?  But more 
[01:25:00]  importantly  the pee  hole area  that no  guy ever  uses.  that's a  weird  pattern  thing.  It's  almost  designer  underpants.  He wouldn't  know.  They're  gray.  They got  like a  weird  seam  thing  going  on.  It's  just  not  running  the  mill.  Yeah.  So he  would know.  He'd be like  oh yeah I  got those.  Yeah ask him  do you have  underwear like  that at home?  He has sent  this picture  out a lot.  Well I'm  looking into  my underwear  drawer.  We have  people looking  into this 
[01:25:30]  to see if  really he  is scared  that this  picture is  out in  the puzzle  because he  has sent  this picture  out a lot  and he's  scared that  other people  are going to  come forward  and go holy  shit I got  this fucking  picture too.  Sam's outlining  his dick with  the cursor.  Yeah we know  where the helmet  is.  That's the  helmet.  That's his  helmet.  Yeah.  I think.  I think.  Can you see  the ridge?  Yeah.  I think the  ridge is right  there.  He doesn't  have a big  helmet.  No.  I can't even  know what that  is.  Helmets I 
[01:26:00]  think is  supposed to  be like  bigger.  Let's just  say pronounced.  Okay.  I have a  picture of  my penis  in spandex  and you  can definitely  see.  Oh yeah I  got that one  too.  Helmet?  Yeah yeah.  You could  definitely see  your.  You got  gyms?  Get it.  Yes you get  it.  Gay.  Gym pictures.  If you want  it I'll get  it to you.  Sam it's not  gay if he  sends it to  everybody.  Yeah that's  true.  I didn't  get one then.  Well because 
[01:26:30]  he thought  he might get  turned on by  it I guess.  I wouldn't  mind seeing  it.  He sent  a task for  pure comedy.  Yeah.  I think it  was funny.  Here's Wolf  Blitzer continuing.  But I don't  want to say  with certitude  to you something  that I don't  know to be the  certain truth but  I do know some  certain truths  here.  I didn't send  any Twitter  picture.  The person who  allegedly it was  sent to this  poor woman who  was frankly a  victim in all  this didn't get  it.  She put out a  statement saying  as much.  I don't know  her.  She doesn't know  me.  It seems to me 
[01:27:00]  that this is what  goes on in the  internet world and  the social media  world of 2011 that  sometimes these  things happen.  No.  It didn't get sent  to her.  She didn't get it.  It got posted and  taken right down.  So do you think he  posted it accidentally  realizing it was the  wrong person and  took it right down?  And then too late.  What do you mean she  didn't get it?  I think when he  saw there was a  public message instead  of private message  he immediately took  it down.  Right.  Because that means  anybody could  hold on.  No, no, no, no.  With Twitter and  your feed and all  that it could have 
[01:27:30]  been on her Twitter  but she never saw  it and by the time  she's like fuck it  people are saying he  sent me a picture  then she looks on  her timeline.  It's not.  It's got to be deleted  already.  So she technically  did not see it.  Right, that's what  I'm saying.  She never got it but  he realized as soon  as he did it that  it was a public and  not a private.  We've all sent out  tweets this morning  I'm sure but all  our followers, only a  small percentage of  our followers are  going to see the  tweet we just sent.  And this is the  situation here as  well. 
[01:28:00]  But why would he  send it to her?  Especially if you  now delete the tweet.  Somebody he doesn't  know.  This is where the  autofill thing may be  correct because why  would he send it to  someone who's  he doesn't know  at all?  Like why would he  risk just randomly  sending it?  He fucked up.  Plus was she  following him?  Because she said  she doesn't know  who he was and  you can't direct  message somebody  who doesn't follow  you.  So how does that  even work?  Maybe why would  he send it to a  stranger with rep 
[01:28:30]  wiener?  Like that's his  professional fucking  Twitter.  I don't buy it.  He went to send  it to somebody else.  I think Danny's  autofill theory  might be very  accurate.  Yeah and it  might have filled  in and he sent  and went oh  God.  She's not suicidal  politically.  You wouldn't send a  hard on photo to a  strange girl in  Seattle that you've  never talked to.  But your face isn't  in the picture.  But your name is  attached to it.  Like you would never  just send that  randomly unless you  knew she wanted it.  Well maybe that's  what he was thinking.  Oh she fucking  wanted it.  Maybe he's thinking  I feel good about 
[01:29:00]  this.  I could trust this  situation and if  God if anyone  calls me out on  it my face isn't  in this and I'll  deny that I ever  fucking did this.  So that theory's  correct.  She got it some  other way.  He would have  been in a lot  worse shape if  that autofill had  not come back  like a hot  college chick.  If it had been  just like some  dude.  Oh a guy.  Oh a young  political page.  Wait till it.  It comes out a  few dudes got this  picture.  Oh no.  A 15 year old.  This picture has  been sent around. 
[01:29:30]  That's what's  going to come out  next.  Wolf Blitzer  continues because  he's in the  situation room.  Have you ever  taken a picture  like this of  yourself?  I can tell you  this.  I can tell you  this.  Have you or  have you not?  I can tell you  this should be  followed up with  yes or no.  I can tell you  this.  Yes.  Why can't he  just say no?  He could just  say I have not.  No I haven't  taken any picture.  If you never  took any pictures  like that of  yourself and  you're asked have  you ever taken  any pictures of 
[01:30:00]  yourself like this  wouldn't you just  say no?  No I haven't.  I haven't.  Because his wife  knows.  Yeah.  And he's already  probably gave her  some bullshit  story.  And he knows.  Like I took this  picture for you  sweetie because  you travel with  Hillary Clinton and  I wanted to send  this to you but I  didn't because I  was a little scared  to do so.  And the lie is worse  than the actual  fucking event.  Right.  You know?  Because now if he  says yes I did  take that picture  you know because  he's told his  wife that already.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  If he said no it  isn't me and then  he finds out it is  now you got the  picture of him and  the lie.  So.  But why is he  saying when they  say have you ever  taken a picture like  this of yourself?  Why isn't he just  saying no because  his face isn't in  it?  Why isn't he just  saying no?  Either A.  Ope's right.  Other people have  it.  Or B.  Wherever this came  from there's worse  and he knows it.  There's worse.  There's more.  There's worse.  With the same  underpants.  Same underwear.  With the head of  his dick sticking out  the pant leg.  The leg of it. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poking out saying  how do you do?  You can hack a  flicker.  Like he may have an  anonymous flicker  account and he's not  famous enough where  anybody would just  rank.  I never would have  recognized him.  Yeah.  There's something  else.  I keep saying that  but.  What is his answer  to that whole thing?  Well let me tell you  this.  Yeah let's find out.  Have you ever taken  a picture like this  of yourself?  I can tell you this  that there are I have  photographs.  I don't know what  photographs are out  there in the world of  me. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know what  things have been  manipulated and  doctored and we're  going to try to find  out what happened.  But the most important  reason I want to find  out what happened is  to make sure that it  doesn't happen again.  Obviously someone got  access to my account.  He didn't ask you  that.  He didn't ask you  that.  He asked you have you  ever taken a picture  like that and he goes  into this fucking  speech that has nothing  to do with answering  Wolf's question.  Did you take a picture  like that? 
[01:32:00]  Yes or no?  Well let me tell you  the pictures are out  there.  Things are going to be  manipulated.  They didn't ask you  that.  And didn't ask you  that.  I want to thank  Droid XM.  He writes Wiener's  undies are Munsing  Wear brand.  Munsing Wear?  Are they?  Are they really going  to take off now as  far as that?  Can we go to the  Munsing Wear website?  F-U-N-S-I-N-G  Wear.  Why don't we all get  some and take pictures  with our hogs like  that and just send 
[01:32:30]  them out?  I would Twitter the  photo of my hog but  they would suspend my  account.  Oh they certainly  would.  Even though it's in  underwear.  Ooh.  Sexy.  In your underwear  you think?  No.  Yeah.  Here, here, here.  It's to make sure  that it doesn't  happen again.  Obviously someone  got access to my  account.  That's bad.  They sent a picture  that makes fun of  the name Wiener.  I get it.  You know, touche.  Dr. Moriarty, you  got me.  At the time it  happened, I tweeted  right away that I  got the joke and I  continued on with my  life. 
[01:33:00]  And I think that  frankly, that's what I  would encourage everyone  to do.  I don't believe that  this is a big federal  issue, but people are  free to pursue it if  they like.  But you would like to  get to the bottom of  it.  So the question is,  have you asked  Capitol Hill police or  New York police or  FBI or any law  enforcement authority  to investigate?  Have I called the  cops or the FBI  because someone sent  spam?  No.  However, I did.  Oh, this guy.  You are guilty of  something.  Someone sent spam.  No one believes  him.  You are guilty of  something.  What a terrible, that 
[01:33:30]  shows you the  arrogance of fucking  politicians.  This is why they  legislate the way  they...  This dumb  motherfucker actually  thinks that he's  believable saying this  shit?  Yeah, yeah.  I got the joke and  moved on.  No politician would  get the joke and move  on like that.  I got the joke.  My name's Wiener,  right?  Knowing that this  could be, you know...  Wiener picks.  I get it.  Right, right, right.  His fucking political  career is about to be  destroyed.  Believe me, you would  get the police involved  to save yourself.  But doesn't this  explain to you who  these people are? 
[01:34:00]  This is exactly why  fucking Bloomberg  does what he does  with not giving a  shit about people  driving down Broadway.  This is why they  legislate the way  they do.  This is how out of  touch they are with  fucking how full of  shit they are.  Yep.  Nobody fucking  believes what you're  saying.  It's do as I say,  not as I do is a  politician's motto.  Like he's trying to  be slick.  Like you're not in  the debating society  here.  Like you're not  arguing, like in  the law, and most 
[01:34:30]  of these guys are  fucking dirtbag  lawyers, in the law  if a confession is  gotten illegally, the  confession is not  admissible.  Even though the  confession was gotten,  you cannot use it.  This is not that kind  of situation.  People either know  you're telling the  truth or they don't.  You can't say, well  technically I didn't  send it so it's not  admissible.  It doesn't work that  way in the real world.  Everyone knows you're  full of shit about  something.  You're not being  straightforward.  The one, I'm going  to paraphrase, where  he said it was a  prank and I wrote, 
[01:35:00]  got the joke and  just moved on.  No.  Get the fuck out of  here.  You're crazy.  They're threatening  your political career  and you got the  joke?  Right.  We're just dopey  shock jocks if that  happened to us.  I wouldn't just get  the joke and go,  okay, and move on.  Dude, because someone  hacked your account?  Right.  No fucking way.  Bullshit.  There's more to this  story that we can't  figure out, obviously,  but I will say this.  That is absolutely a  picture of him in some  fancy boxers, boxer 
[01:35:30]  briefs, I believe, by  this Munsing Ware  company.  Yes.  And that's his  fucking cock.  You think they're  selling a lot more  underwear?  You think they're like,  oh boy, look at this.  What's that big thing?  We can make it look  like you don't have  genitals?  Is it the same  underwear, Danny?  Looks like, yeah.  Yeah.  From Munsing Ware.  The last part of the  clip.  Munsing Ware.  From the Wolf  Clipser show.  Look at this.  It's everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  It's not going away,  Mr. Weiner.  Body of evidence. 
[01:36:00]  Uh-huh.  I'm talking about  cock on the news.  It's great.  They're pretty much  just, you know,  hey, we need to  talk about cock.  The FBI because  someone sent spam?  No.  However.  Well, is it spam  or is it a prank?  Because those are  two very different  things, idiot.  He's throwing every  word he can out  there except for  I took that picture.  It's my cock.  He's in a way  clever, but it's  not working. 
[01:36:30]  If he said,  do I call the FBI  because someone  pranks me?  Well, yeah, if  you're a congressman.  Do I call the FBI  because someone sent  me spam?  Yeah.  Sounds better, right?  Yeah.  By the way.  But he already said  this isn't spam.  This is not an  innocent.  If they had sent a  picture, if they  had put his head  on a nude black  body, that's a  prank.  Right.  That's not a  genuine threat to  your political  livelihood.  This is.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know it.  And now that you're  caught up in it, 
[01:37:00]  you're still like,  get the, it just,  as much as like,  it makes you hate  these people, all of  them.  Because the way  Clinton lied, the way  any of them lied,  I did not, the  technicalities,  these fucking.  I did not have  sex with them.  And then it's like,  well, blowjob ain't  sex.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  It's that political  speak.  It works when you're  trying to dodge  that you signed a  bill that maybe you  didn't read or  that works.  Then you sit there  and go, well, my 
[01:37:30]  colleagues had  dictated to me the  bill.  And that works  because then people  are like, oh, well,  whatever.  It's doing the  political thing.  But when you're in  this situation, that  political speak doesn't  get you out of this  fucking trouble.  Because we're not  lawyers.  We're just regular  people going, you're  full of shit, pal.  Say it.  When I'm asked yes or  no question, you answer  yes or no.  Would he accept that  answer?  Would Anthony  Weiner accept that  evasive horse shit on  Capitol Hill or wherever 
[01:38:00]  it was?  Yeah, yeah.  He'd be sitting up  there going, answer the  question.  Answer the question.  Input forth to you.  Or maybe he has a  girlfriend, Denise and  PA.  What's going on with  Denise and PA?  He's really afraid that  I hope he's blowing  this story apart.  He's really afraid that  his girlfriend is  wondering who else he's  sending the pics to.  This picture has been  sent to a lot of  people.  Yeah, I bet.  Oh, this story is far  from over.  Far from over.  Do you know I almost  said there's something  else again, but I 
[01:38:30]  stopped myself.  Yeah.  I just, I swim in a  pool of redundant  agency.  I'm a fucking fool.  Here's the end of the  clip.  The cops or the FBI  because someone sent  spam?  Yeah.  However, I did get a  firm, a law firm who  specializes in these  things, who specializes in  white-collar crime.  I've got someone who is,  and they're going to get  someone who's an  internet security expert  to try to get to the  bottom of how we secure  my accounts.  You change your password,  dope idiot.  How to secure my  accounts.  What are you talking  about?  So it's not, it's not 
[01:39:00]  somebody, a lawyer, to  handle this problem.  Right.  Or a security expert.  Right.  It's to, to...  You don't have a problem  with a guy that's trying  to ruin your political  career, which means the  guy is still out there,  by the way, dope, and  that he's not going to  stop.  But that isn't what he's  even addressing.  He's doing the old, you  know, shutting the barn  door after the horses are  out thing.  Right.  And he's not really  paying attention to this.  And like Jimmy said, this  is a political career  ender, if it turns out  that it's him. 
[01:39:30]  So wouldn't you fight for  your political life by  hiring lawyers,  investigators, to  investigate this specific,  not just blow it off, like  I get it, he's making a  wiener joke, ah, forget  it.  Why would you allow a  guy like that to still be  out there?  Yeah.  What does this guy have  up his sleeve next?  Track him down.  Right.  Yep.  You're a congressman.  You can't allow this if  you're innocent.  He would absolutely say,  I've turned it over to 
[01:40:00]  the Capitol Police.  My account was hacked.  I understand the prank,  but they hacked my  account.  That's a federal offense,  and I'm going to  prosecute when we find  out who hacked.  Because if they hack  your email, how do you  know they didn't hack  your email?  I mean, dude, the amount  of contacts he has for  real, stop it.  He has Obama's number.  He's a Democrat.  He can call Obama.  Right.  We got an IT guy.  Oh.  Mikey in Chicago.  These guys are exciting.  Mike.  Mike.  What's up, guys?  Please try not to bore  the shit out of everybody.  Language. 
[01:40:30]  Go ahead, Mike.  Language.  Hi, buddy.  How's it going?  Good, good, good.  Good.  We don't need to do all  that.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  Hey, first of all, Ed,  Breaking Bad, season three.  The first one.  All right, I'm not going  to fucking listen to this shit.  I'm not listening to any  fucking hang up on this  cocksucker.  Sir, just hang up on this  fucking cock.  We lose you, Mike.  I'm not going to fucking...  I ripped my headphones off.  I'm not going to fucking  listen.  He's gone.  He's gone.  I'm not going to fucking  sit there and listen to a  spoiler, you cunt. 
[01:41:00]  Go fuck your mother's  asshole, you IT  cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Wow.  You geek.  Wow.  Hate people.  I hate people.  I hate them all.  He's probably just going to  say, like, whatever.  Season three.  It's really good, man.  You're going to love it.  I didn't know if he was  going to say that.  I don't care.  Fuck with me.  All right.  Do we have an IT guy that's  never seen Breaking Bad?  Yeah, that's what we need.  Is this the latest? 
[01:41:30]  I know he did some other  shit after Wolf Blitzer,  but this is pretty much what  everyone is focusing on.  Yeah, the Wolf Blitzer is  pretty much the one.  Yeah.  If anything new comes out  of this, please let us  know.  We're going to break, I  think.  Paris Hilton at 930.  Oh, wow.  The World According to  Paris.  Was it on last night?  Yeah, it was on at 10 on  Oxygen.  I saw it before yesterday.  Oh, but it started yesterday.  Oh, it started last night?  Okay.  What else?  I'm trying to find other 
[01:42:00]  things after the break.  Yes.  Okay.  The virus.  You're listening to  Obi and Anthony.  What's up, guys?  We all went to pee-pees  together.  Oh, no.  That was fun.  Third dump of the morning  for me.  My dump looked like 
[01:42:30]  something I've seen  while scuba diving.  That's not good.  Come.  Welcome.  It can't, that can't ever  be good.  It really did, though.  There's nothing down there  scuba diving that would  look like a healthy dump.  It looked corally.  Like coral?  Looked a bit corally.  A reef?  I had some horrendous  acid reflux two nights  ago, and now it's  finally, and now it's  coming out.  Worked its way down. 
[01:43:00]  So whatever the hell  I ate.  Was it burning the old  ring?  Was it burning the old  wrinkled ring?  That acid reflux will  fucking convince you  you're having a heart  attack, though.  Holy shit.  Really?  Middle of the night,  I'm like, I think this  might be it.  Oh.  I think this might be  time to call the old  911.  Damn.  Yeah, because they're  very similar, obviously.  Similar symptoms.  It was fucking bad.  Just up in bed, holding  onto the wall like this,  like, what the fuck? 
[01:43:30]  That bad?  Wow.  I get it really bad.  I've been good lately,  though.  I've been good for a long  time with the acid  reflux.  What, do you got to  take that shit that  shuts off the pumps?  Yeah.  The acid pumps in your  tummy?  Yeah, I thought I had to  be on the pill on a  regular basis, but a long  time ago, I said, fuck  this.  I don't want to be on  any fucking pills ever.  Yeah.  I'm one of those  stupid idiots, but I  stopped taking the pill  like, I don't know,  six to eight months  ago.  What about vitamins?  Do you take vitamins?  I don't do vitamins.  I do juice drinks with 
[01:44:00]  rolling every afternoon.  I like the vitamins.  You do vitamins?  I like taking, like,  B-complexes.  You got to find it.  And the D.  I like the D.  Say that again.  Because there's not a  vitamin N.  I'd be deficient.  I don't even like  niacin.  Problem with living on  Long Island, you can't  find these health food  stores.  But you get a nice  health food store that  makes a vegetable drink. 
[01:44:30]  You should see how many  vegetables they shove in  one damn drink.  It would take you all  day to eat that.  I hope you're absorbing  some of it.  Yeah, yeah.  I think my theory is  you're just peeing it  out.  You just piss it out.  Yeah, I don't know.  When you take vitamins,  though, and you take a  piss, it looks like that  fluid that's in those  glow sticks.  Oh, yeah.  When you take a leak,  it's like, whoa, that is  some yellow, bright urine.  Supposedly, that's all the  vitamins.  Vitamins that's coming out  of you, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  That didn't really...  That's the shit that you  didn't absorb.  Yeah, it didn't absorb  into you.  But I figure maybe the  last bit of it, like the  vitamins are absorbed into  your dick through your  urethra.  I'm sure some of it.  Like the last bit of it,  it's like, yeah, I'm  giving my dick some  vitamins.  I'm sure some of it's  absorbed.  Yeah, you never know.  I don't know.  Shaq retired on Twitter  yesterday, huh?  Yeah, a lot of people  announcing things on  Twitter.  That's kind of an odd  thing.  It's the easy way to go,  and then the mainstream  media picks it up, so why  not?  Why call a press conference  when with one tweet you  can tell the world what 
[01:45:30]  you're doing?  And you could tell, you  could just put your side  out there.  You don't have to answer  anybody's questions.  Yeah, that is kind of...  He actually made a video.  It's only 10 seconds.  Yeah.  This is it.  We did it.  19 years, baby.  I want to thank you very  much.  That's why I'm telling you  first.  I'm about to retire.  Love you.  Talk to you soon.  That's it.  That's it.  Yeah, goodbye.  Retired.  Shaq might have wrecked  his legacy.  He probably should have  retired two, three, maybe 
[01:46:00]  even four years ago.  Yeah.  He was one of those  players, we've talked  about this on the show  over the years, where all  of a sudden he started  looking funny in other  fucking uniforms.  Who did he play for at  the end?  Did he do Phoenix,  Cleveland, Boston?  Wow, really?  He was at Boston?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I didn't remember.  Yeah.  He was injured pretty much  through the playoffs, but  I think he did three teams  in three years, right?  What do we got there, Dan?  Well, obviously, yeah.  He was with the Magic  from 92 to 96. 
[01:46:30]  96 to 04 with the Lakers,  04 to 8 with the Heat,  8 to 9 with the Phoenix Suns.  So that's one season, right?  Because the basketball season  was over.  He's been off the Lakers  since 04?  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah, 2008-2009 season  was the Suns, 9-10 was  Cleveland, and 10-11 was  Celtics.  Right.  Wow, just a year here and  there?  He should have probably left  after the Miami Heat run,  probably.  I think that kind of wrecks  your legacy a little bit  in the end.  Damn.  If that matters to a guy  who probably made a billion 
[01:47:00]  dollars in his career.  Well, who is it?  Is it the Lakers that are  going to retire his number  or something?  Who's doing it?  The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar thing  where they're trying to get  that done?  Really?  Is that going on?  I don't know.  I heard somebody,  one of these fucking teams  are retiring his number.  Shaq's number?  Yeah.  That's what I heard.  Already?  I would think it's the Lakers,  right?  Who is?  Lakers.  Lakers, yeah.  Wow.  How about Kareem's numbers  retired, right?  So it's Magic's. 
[01:47:30]  They have to be.  There's no one.  I think 33 was Kareem.  There's nobody with 33.  It has to be done.  Even though they don't  like Kareem, he's still.  No one wanted Magic's number.  Yeah, his number 32 jersey  was retired by the Lakers  in 92.  Kareem is 32?  No, that was Magic.  Oh, okay.  Magic.  Go with Kareem, though.  I don't know about Kareem.  What is his number  retired?  I'm going to guess in 1989.  He wore number 33.  Yeah.  Isn't there...  It has to be.  Isn't there a campaign  to retire...  What's going on with him?  Statue.  Oh, that's a statue. 
[01:48:00]  And he will get it.  Okay, okay.  He just didn't get it first.  They don't like him.  And then they had to have  retired his number.  Come on.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Kareem.  Apparently, he just...  In the organization,  they don't love him.  No.  Why?  He had a little too much  fucking bullshit.  Yeah, I don't know.  He might be a difficult guy, but...  Give the fuck.  It matters what he did  on the court.  Didn't kowtow to the man.  I agree.  Man.  Give the fuck with the guy...  How he'd present himself  when he's not on the court.  That's Skyhook.  I agree. 
[01:48:30]  Skyhook.  Enough already with that crap.  George St. Pierre,  for all the MMA fans,  will face fucking Nick Diaz,  UFC 137 in October.  Yeah.  That was announced yesterday  on Dana White's Twitter.  And Brock, by the way,  had the surgery.  We're supposed to be getting  Brock in next week,  the 7th.  That ain't happening.  The day Sugar Ray came in,  but I think he had  a surgery early, so...  Will they take a foot or two?  I heard a foot,  but I don't know.  That's all I heard.  Of the intestine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I hope he can fight again. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, we'll have to wait and see.  That's got to be fucking...  I thought he had a bag.  Get to the bag for a few weeks.  My dad had some intestines.  It's awful.  Part of his intestine.  I think they...  I would have to ask a brother,  but I think they took a lot.  Passed out of my college graduation.  Really?  I'm all happy.  I graduate college,  and you know how you're  in your stupid gown and stuff?  Yeah.  And it's Geneseo, so...  Actually, no, I don't know,  but I know of it.  Trust me, it didn't help, obviously. 
[01:49:30]  Geneseo, long ride from Long Island,  so it's my mom, my dad,  and my sister came up  for the graduation,  and you're kind of psyched  after it's all over,  and you're looking at the crowd  for everybody.  Hey, where are they?  Where is everybody?  Are they under the apple tree  so we can take some pictures?  And all of a sudden,  I just see my sister and my mom,  and they look sad.  I'm like, that's weird,  because they shouldn't be sad.  But I guess there was  a huge commotion  in the back of the fucking...  Oh, no, a scene?  Was it the ice arena up there? 
[01:50:00]  I forgot where I even graduated.  I think it was the ice arena.  Supposedly, there was a scene  I never even noticed,  and it was them  taking my dad out.  Oh.  Passed out.  Because he had kind of  the same thing as Brock.  Oh, boy.  And then they had to do  emergency surgery  in the middle of nowhere  in Geneseo.  I don't even know  where they went,  Dansville or something,  to get local  for some people up there.  Ooh.  Maybe Mount Morris.  And, yeah,  he had some shit removed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We went on partying, though.  Yeah, you have to.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:50:30]  It's a graduation.  It's a graduation,  for Christ's sake.  I like the...  I do like this whole thing  of how Shaq retires  on Twitter and things.  I was talking to somebody  about the way  this is the future.  We had our preconceived  little notion  of what the future  would be years ago,  but it turns out  it's just fucking...  pretty much communication.  Right.  It's like...  And there were so many things  that you'd read about  as a kid  in popular science 
[01:51:00]  and popular mechanics  about what was going to be  in the future,  and it was all these gadgets  and things  that were supposed to  help you do things  and get information,  but they were all  spread around  because we didn't know  how small things  were going to get,  and then you realize,  wow,  they put it in one thing,  that's your communication device,  and now that's like  everything.  That's your dictionary,  your fucking encyclopedias,  your fucking...  Your map.  Your own personal TV station 
[01:51:30]  to put out your videos  to everybody  that wants to watch,  and that ended up being  what the big thing  of the future is.  And I like how you don't  even have to go back  too far to kind of see  how everybody got it wrong  because people try to think  like, oh, the 50s and 60s,  the Kitchen of Tomorrow,  and all that stuff.  Meanwhile, I've been watching  all these movies  from like the mid-90s  where they're trying  to speculate  like what the future will be.  Like future movies  made in the mid-90s.  Yeah.  And boy, is it just  fucking funny.  And they just had it wrong.  They didn't know...  You got an example of that?  Well, sure. 
[01:52:00]  Like in The Matrix,  you know,  like the guy standing  in front of like a huge,  you know,  what do you want to call it?  A wall of television.  But they're all like  gigantic tube televisions.  Yeah, yeah,  big tube TVs.  In the year 2100,  we're not dealing with CRT.  I like how they had to have  little shitty flip phones  because that was the tech  at the time.  And so the tech of the future  had to be exactly the same.  So everybody's running around  with these shitty flip phones  and it's just like,  that never happened.  Oh, fuck it.  I gotta watch The Matrix again.  Yeah, it's dated  when you look at some of the things.  The Matrix is dated?  That's kind of weird to say.  It's incredibly dated, 
[01:52:30]  but not just The Matrix.  It's almost any sci-fi movie  that was trying to like  get into the future  when the internet  was just so, so, so baby.  Wasn't Minority Report  have it right  where he was writing  in mid-air  kind of with his glove?  I was just watching  Minority Report  the other day.  They did well with that.  I like Minority Report.  I like that movie.  Yeah.  And that was like  2002, I guess?  Something like that.  And it still kind of holds up.  It's not...  But that's not far-fetched to me  as you're using  your finger on your screen.  So why not?  Now it's going to just be 
[01:53:00]  in the air.  Of course it's going to be.  That was a great foresight  by them  way before the touch fall.  What Spielberg did  for that film  was he hired like  four or five  of the top tech experts  to consult on the film.  So that's why  a lot of that tech  is legitimate  because if all that shit  was in development  or they knew  what was going to be  in development  where was it potentially  going?  smaller, better, faster.  The problem years ago  because I was always  into getting  the new shit  and stuff like that  and you'd realize  you're buying stuff  and you just 
[01:53:30]  you couldn't carry everything.  You had your Palm Pilot  and your phone  Stylus  with the stylus  Trio  and a digital camera  so you had to carry  a bunch of shit around  and then just the idea  of consolidating it  all together  where you know  stupid Captain Kirk  and his dumb communicator  the thing stunk on ice  big flip phone  and then the Spock  with his tricorder  and you got all 
[01:54:00]  the information you want.  We got a ways to go though.  It still has to become  your credit card.  I know that's  sort of happening.  It's getting to the point  where they're starting  to use  you'll be using  your phone  at cash registers  to pay for shit.  Right.  They're using that elsewhere.  Yeah.  They're already doing that.  Checking it online  on the computer  at the airport  you can do  with your iPhone.  Yeah.  With your phone.  It's getting there.  There's no reason  why you shouldn't  be able to pay  for whatever you want  through your phone now.  It's getting there.  With a quick little scan.  It's really getting there.  It's close. 
[01:54:30]  But it's like  then you realize  okay I got my phone  this is you.  This is like  this is digital you.  It's your spending.  Remember when you used  to lose your phone  it was obviously a drag.  It's always a drag  when you lose  your wallet  but now you think  about fuck  I can't lose  my phone anymore.  Yeah can't lose  there's too much  information on there.  There's too much shit.  You don't know  anyone's phone number  anymore.  Yeah that I don't  want to replace.  Yeah.  There's so much 
[01:55:00]  information on there  and stuff that  you've written  pictures  your whole fucking  life of pictures  you know you can  back that shit up  and stuff on your  computer so you have it  but just have that  shit out there.  Most people don't  back up this shit  on a regular basis.  Yeah you gotta.  I know.  I do.  It's just the worst  if you don't out there.  It's probably been a  month or two at this  point for me.  Yeah.  I'll do it today  now that I'm thinking  about it.  And your whole  me and Danny  were talking about  your whole like  life is in your  phone in pictures 
[01:55:30]  so if you just  scroll through your  pictures and go to  the beginning  and then keep going  you could be like  oh this is you know  two years of my life  in you know  because you take  you probably take  an average of at  least a picture a  day probably more  so you just scroll  through and it's like  here's here's two  years of my life  documented pretty much  on a daily basis  of what I did.  My last two years  were all right.  Yeah.  This is good.  I remember that.  Oh there's my dick  in those unique 
[01:56:00]  underpants.  This is cool.  Oh yeah I remember  when I was dating her.  Yeah yeah it's like  oh yeah that's right  I went to the concert  with that one.  Yeah and here's the  concert and not me  I get rid of that  shit.  Do you?  Yes.  I save all photos  of girlfriends.  Goodbye.  I just put them in a  place like a folder  and I don't go to them  but I save all that  stuff because it's my  life.  Yeah it's your life  you gotta kind of  hold on to it.  I save every note  or all the letters  I save everything  man.  You're a prick.  They start out that  way.  Dear prick.  Why does my vagina 
[01:56:30]  itch?  It's all gonna be  very like it's gonna  be on a computer chip  with that eventually  that's implanted  and everything is gonna  be done through that  like literally  you're gonna pay  for all items  everything ID  scan  boop  over  done  it's gonna be  that fucking  quick  and I think  that the phone  all that stuff  will be  computers  all your information  in a hard drive  will be on a  fucking microchip  with that in your  finger  you'll have a  10 terabyte  device  You just hold  your hand over 
[01:57:00]  something  and it'll all  be that quick  it's like here's  all your info  there you go  be so hackable  though  just up against  somebody in a  fucking train  and they could  just  get a machine  to decipher  what you have  on your  what's that  they can't do  that to your  smart phones  believe me  they'll figure  that out  that's why  I don't like  those credit  cards that have  that RFID  built in  where you could  just kind of  tap to pay  yeah  because if I  could tap  to pay  what's stopping  someone else  how about tap  to steal 
[01:57:30]  in your pocket  yeah  because I mean  with a credit  card  and this  happened to me  once  a waiter  was just  taking his  taking your  credit card  and he would  have a little  slide reader  in his apron  and he would  slide read your  card  and then ring  you up  bring you the  check  and then go  home  plug the shit  into his  computer  and start  using your  fucking credit  card  it would be  easier  to just pick  up people  that are using  those quick pass 
[01:58:00]  things  and  all you have  to do is  literally bump  into them  and they still  have their  wallet  they still  have all  their stuff  so if  they were  paranoid  and checked  their pockets  everything's  there  everything's  still there  but you  just grabbed  their electronic  information  yeah it's  kind of creepy  we got people  want to talk  about minority  report but we  also have  IT people  I want to  ask the IT  people first  we got two  of them  Jack if you're  listening we're  going to you  next stay there  but first Sarah  in Florida  Sarah in Florida  Street  Sarah my 
[01:58:30]  sister she lives  on Florida  Street  dummy  he was a  dope  and then they  kicked me in  the guts  deserved it  you fool  who kicks  stupid in  the guts  oh the guys  at the mental  hospital  they would  kick me in  the guts  apparently in  real life too  I got regular  good hair and  good teeth  no you don't  shut up  you chicken  eating retard  love that movie  Sarah  Sarah  you chicken 
[01:59:00]  eating retard  he really  was  put the piece  down  now I can't  eat it  because you  have dumb  fingers that  were probably  scratching your  butthole  all over our  chicken  the ones that  pick up pennies  out of garbage  juice  touching my  chicken  dumb  bellow  dumb  bellow  now I know  why my  dumps look  cool  oh god  that's going  in the same  way it comes  out  looks like  it was  compressed  in the  Star Wars  garbage  machine  it's called  raw crunch 
[01:59:30]  handmade  uncooked  unprocessed  energy bar  no artificial  nothing  no shit  with those  with this  go  go  goy  berries  how do you  say  G-O-J-I  that's a  hot berry  right now  is that a  hot berry  yeah  you know  when the  acai berry  was putting  everything  now they're  going with  this goy  fucking  berry 
[02:00:00]  alright sorry  wow  it looks like  little red  fucking  it looks  awful  well it's  probably  what's it  held together  with  some type  of  fructose  cum  fructose  cum  cum  when I was  a kid  I ate  I remember  I ate  bird seed  because it  was there  of course  so is  shit  yeah but  every once  in a while  you got  the sunflowers  in the bird  seeds  this tastes  like bird  seeds 
[02:00:30]  I used to  say go  ahead make  the chirpy  noise  chirp  chirp  give me  some seeds  you want me  to chirp  like that  oh no  no  what do  you have  for the  program  sierra  so this  is my  thing  if the  whole  reason  wiener  doesn't  want to  let it  out  he knows  we can  ping  his  address  back  ping  his  address  back  yeah  basically  what it  is  whenever  you send  anything  out  from a  computer  it  bounces  off  a place  that's  called  ping  a single  ping  it's a  ping baby 
[02:01:00]  he's been  pinged and  he doesn't  like it  so do you  think that  we were  theorizing  while fair  too that  he may  not want  websites  he's been  like once  an IT person  gets in there  they know  everything  like it  like let's  just say  he had  gone to  gay websites  or whatever  it may be  we would  see it  all  there's no  way of  hiding it  I'm sorry  and that  may be  would you  be able to  see like  where else  he sent  photos  and all  that stuff  if it  was done  yeah  as a  norm  yes  you can  see it  unless it's  on a  highly  secure  website  which even  the government  can't hide  everything  that's why 
[02:01:30]  they hire  people like  me  I'm a  hacker  actually  are you  really  yeah  so you  can  now  okay  as a  hacker  how  plausible  is his  excuse  like what  do you  what do  you think  like did  he have  a flicker  account  your opinion  that someone  got into  or is he  just  bullshitting  or did  somebody  hack into  an account  and he's  worried about  what else  is in  there  he is  bullshitting  he doesn't  want anyone  to box him  for anything  so you think  that his  computer  he might  be  if I could  get in  his computer  I could  probably  have him  at my  knees  groveling 
[02:02:00]  wow  Sarah can I  ask you  something  does  does Wiener  have a  a naughty  boy  computer  he has a  good boy  laptop  and his  naughty boy  laptop  he very  well could  yeah  I think  he has  both  but the  fact is  he got  his  wiener  stuck  boo  this is  going great  be more  funny  poor Sarah  quiet 
[02:02:30]  quiet  quiet  so as  a  how long  would it  take you  to crack  a passcode  on a  good day  between  45 minutes  and an  hour  come on  like  how many  characters  up to  80  you  can crack  an 80  character  passcode  in an  hour 
[02:03:00]  that's  what they  pay me  for  are you  hot  wait a  minute  hold on  no way  wouldn't  that take  no way  to crack  an 80  code  password  would take  millennium  no because  we have  different  programs  that we  can use  in order  to help  us  oh you  do  ah  um  like what  kind of  meaning  she's a  cyberpunk  no no no  no but  even  great  hackers  I mean  there's  so many  combinations 
[02:03:30]  yeah but  the average  person  really isn't  that smart  I know  that they  they have  certain  procedures  certain  words  combinations  of words  and a lot  of stuff  but they're  saying if  you're using  lowercase  and uppercase  and all  characters  there's a  formula  for how  long it  would take  them to  crack  in eight  characters  say  in eight  yeah and  okay so  a lot of  people what  they do is  they use the  word like  password a lot  right  they think  they're really  cute by  changing the  characters in  the middle  okay that's  super easy  right like 
[02:04:00]  P-A-F-F  P-A-F-5-5-W  yeah right  sure  oh my  shit could  you hold  on a second  oh jeez  gotta change  I gotta change  mine too  oh no  yeah and  all the  different  combinations  that people  will use  but if  it's like  a unique  like that  because if  you had  one that  could crack  in a short  period of  time  Julian Assange  had a  256  character  encrypted 
[02:04:30]  message  with a  tremendous  amount  of  information  how come  nobody  has cracked  that  because  believe me  they're  trying  hey what  do you know  about  people that  actually know  things  we know  how to  really hide  things  that's the  problem  but see  I'm hired  for the  average  idiot  basically  what do you  know about  brute force  lockouts  that's not  my  exactly  what is  that  I'm not  saying  that's  some real  shit 
[02:05:00]  man  it's only  a handful  of us  that know  what brute  force  lockouts  are all  about  and certainly  Sarah does  not know  I don't want  to be  locked out  brutally  iPhones and  computers have  brute force  lockouts  that's when  you start  getting to  someone  that  actually  knows  what  they're  doing  the company  that hires  me  basically  lets me  sit behind  a computer  all day  and hack  into their  system  and what  look pretty  yeah what  are you there  for eye  candy  so  go get  the men  some coffee 
[02:05:30]  that doesn't  mean  a shit bit  a  what was I  saying  make a shit  bit of  difference  I want my  IT bra  to be ugly  because that  means she has  more time  to be doing  some of that  IT shit  in all the  movies  they're those  fat or  quirky or  ugly looking  girls  that are  helping all  the attractive  crime fighters  and they go  and visit  the ugly  girl that  is typing  away  because she  doesn't use  a mouse  for some  reason  otherwise  known as  Janine  Garofalo  ah yeah 
[02:06:00]  here's IT  people in  movies  they never  use a mouse  they're just  always fucking  typing shit  and they always  mouth with  their typing  1527  yeah  and you could  see the  fucking numbers  and letters  on their  faces  in their  glasses  usually  yeah  that was  another funny  thing about  like weird  90s tech  that's you  know  I was watching  Mission Impossible  the original  one  with Tom Cruise  the original  one  and one of the  guys that's  like masterminding  one of these  big you know  missions that  they're on  he's got his  laptop open 
[02:06:30]  and he's got  like full motion  video from like  eight cameras  that are like  hidden in  buttons and  glasses and  stuff  and then he's  got behind it  Netscape  Communicator  Netscape  with those  big awful  back and  forward buttons  and that  pulsing N  you remember  that from  back in the  day  Netscape  it just  made me laugh  so hard  like just  the juxtaposition  of these two  technologies  on the same  screen  first of all  we didn't  have full  motion video  like that  oh without  a stutter  or anything 
[02:07:00]  it was  fantastic  what is this  cracking  oh does  Sarah leave  because we  were on to  her  she sucks  she didn't  know what  brute force  was  no  brute force  lockouts  make her ass  bleed  pink soccer  with some  brute force  can crack  passwords in  seconds  not months  but Jimmy  please tell  everyone what  brute force  lockout is  all about  a brute force  lockout is  when there's  too much  activity on  your phone  you take it  and you throw  it against the  wall that locks  out any more  shenanigans 
[02:07:30]  there you go  you can't access  it  a brute force  lockout  there you go  no wait  anyway  Danny was opening  an article  that said  cracking  14 character  complex passwords  in 5 seconds  now let me  when you have  it is believable  that a hacker  could crack  his passcode  but how about  the response  time  meaning  if you try  to get into  an email  more than  a couple  of times  it shuts  you down  like it says  like whatever  you can't get  in for 24 hours  so how do  these hackers  bypass that  all kidding  aside  that's sort 
[02:08:00]  of what  brute force  lockouts  all about  yeah  if you try  more than  a couple  times  for a bank  you have  to call  them  so how  do these  things get  by that  it's probably  part of the  fucking  code  of the  a lot  of times  you're thinking  of things  from a front  end point  of view  when a lot  of the  hacking takes  place  on a back  end  hey don't  tell them  about our  back doors  i don't  know  what's funny  no  that was  war games  that stupid 
[02:08:30]  guy  oh yeah  hey  you're giving  away all  of our  secrets  i got a  guy  i still got a  corporate  phone  blackberry  and my  son now  plays with  this  it's almost  like his  toy  and also  it'll say  five out of  five i have  to get the  password right  because he  fucks around  enough that  oh shit  it's gonna  lock out  yeah  because it  has brute  force lock  out  so he  fucks around  enough he's  hitting buttons  and i don't  know it 
[02:09:00]  goes to the  password thing  i guess and  he fucks it  up three or  four times and  when i get it  back it says  password five  slash five  meaning this is  your last  fucking shot  your last  chance  so that's i  think that's  what brute  force lock  out is  but if  somebody like  let's just  say they  do go back  door and  they do try  to get into  an account  with a hundred  billion calculations  a second how  does the machine  or the place  they're going  process each  one to say  yes or no  to let to 
[02:09:30]  open or not  open like how  does that happen  that's something i  can't answer  yeah i'm curious  about that like  it's obviously  possible yeah  but how does that  happen how does  he feel like yes  no no no yes  yes no no no no  yes no we got a  guy bt5 no  computers panicking  1130 no wrong  wrong wrong wrong  wrong wrong wrong  100 billion wrong  wrong wrong  indirect wrong wrong  yes good good  yes no wrong  we got a guy that  can answer your  question everyone's  saying sarah you  better fucking call  back and defend  yourself because  everyone's saying  you're full of shit 
[02:10:00]  sarah is full of  shit my ears are not  garbage cans because  everyone's saying if  she was in in uh this  industry she would know  brute force lockout  let's say hi to jack  in michigan jack  jack and jack in  michigan i suddenly  like michigan hi jack  really it's not that  easy to crack a  password um i mean  they would have to get  into the server um  find the the hash file 
[02:10:30]  decrypt it and then  then run some some  type of program that  will keep trying  different combinations  of letters numbers i  mean that could take  days  could you uh talk way  the fuck over our head  where only four it  people that are  listening to the show  understand yeah please i  want to i want to know  what that's like like  make believe you're  talking to an expert it  guy yeah we're just 
[02:11:00]  not dummies  yeah one of your  peers how would you  explain it  okay so what would  you what would you  like me to start to  explain how um how  his password might have  gotten hacked  yeah how you can hack  an eight character  password very quickly  but don't dumb it  down you're now  talking to one of your  peers another it  guy i want to hear  how this conversation  will go okay the  most most likely  scenario was there  was a key logger on  this computer which  is scary if he's  in political because  there's obviously  other shit on there 
[02:11:30]  um otherwise there  was there was some  some dummy that he  fired that looked  over his shoulder  so i can't understand  what you're saying  i know a key logger  no it's not working  nah the it guys don't  know how to really  get into that you  know what i i really  fucking hate on these  password sites when  you have to uh make  up an account for  something when they  give you that little  smeary writing that 
[02:12:00]  smeary writing that  you gotta it's like  okay now put in what  you see above and it's  so you know you can't  just use a bot to do  the whole thing nine  out of ten of those i  can't fucking read  they're too smeary  it's like is that an  s or a five why is  it so smeary because  they don't want they  can't you they can't  let the machine read  it and then put it in  so that they could just  have a fucking 
[02:12:30]  automated system uh  keep over and over  making accounts and  doing that uh kind of  um uh shit so so they  they put the smeary  thing on so only your  your human eye is  supposed to read it it  sucks it's a captcha  code no captcha  captcha captcha it's  fucking sucks because  at first it wasn't that  bad but now they're  making them where you  can't fucking read the 
[02:13:00]  goddamn things i can't  see god damn it i can't  see the captcha code i'm  trying to log in here and  it's hurting my eyes and  my wiener i want to get  make a gmail account and  i can't because the  capture code smeary and  i fell down the stairs and  my underwear covered small  cock fell out i don't do  the voice i just do lines  my name's wiener and i've 
[02:13:30]  been hacked or something  they hacked me and now my  my penis is out for the  world to see it's very  embarrassing my wife is very  angry with me now and if  you look at wiener he  should sound exactly like  that of course with my  schnozzola i wish my dick  was as big as my nose i  should have put the  underwear on my head and  snapped the picture  capture code eat those 
[02:14:00]  things all right stop it  now nick is in connecticut  he's an it guy saying jack's  full of shit right oh boy  nick hey guys um yeah you  know i have security guys  working for me on my  company and uh what that  guy was talking about with  the hash code what they're  doing now is they're copying  the hash codes up the  databases and they hack the  hash code and then just save  it in the database so now  they're up to about 14  characters so when you  password up to 14  characters that hash code is 
[02:14:30]  saved in the database on a  hacker website and you just  match up the hash code and  you get a password i don't  know what that mean what  goes on ticket the  password the passwords have  to get longer and longer  because the hash code just  keep getting copied up  what's what's a hash code is  that like an imprint of what  the password is yeah it's a  jumbled up uh algorithm that  jumbled up the password into  garbage how but how does  if he was coming from a  corporate office so wouldn't 
[02:15:00]  he have a firewall to go  through though to get to  these hash codes  hick yeah you i think you  just randomly generate  passwords get the hash code  and dump it into a database  oh that's all well and good  but what i want to i want to  ask you about rainbow tables  what exactly exactly  another phony that's what  fags eat off of rainbow  tables you don't know about  rainbow table sir well there's 
[02:15:30]  probably a pot of gold on that  table it's all oh chip now  jack rainbow tables go  the rainbow tables exactly  anyways these people are hard to  catch because they can hop on  different proxy servers  um and and it make it look like  they're doing it from let me ask  you about a proxy server is that  somebody who's willing to serve a 
[02:16:00]  proxy if it comes into the  restaurant we don't serve proxies  here let them use their own  drinking fountains exactly hash  hash code and proxy water  fountains proxy let me go back to  nick wouldn't it be easier to use  bombing  nick wouldn't it be easier to use a  forensic uh toll kit  yeah absolutely of course yeah  forensic toll kit  hmm of course jack did you have  the answer to that no  i didn't hear that i'm sorry can you  repeat the question oh no see that's a 
[02:16:30]  trick a forensic tool kit  mm-hmm you're about to enter the  world of forensic medicine yeah  but anyways the black guy and the  chinese guy fall down and faint i  can't believe they cracked my  password it was sam  it was a three-letter password and  the hint was  my asian friend with a bowl of  hairdo  sam  had to change it to flat ass  yes but there was a hyphen so i 
[02:17:00]  thought the added character would  make it harder to crack  everybody knew  but it was cracked by monaghan  detective monaghan watched me enter  it  and then he hacked in and he sent  photos of my genitals to abigail  she was on codeine she twittered it  by mistake  stupid abby my members only jacket was  hanging  what by my old balls  because i'm in a wheelchair now  cue end of the bit music  right on it eric 
[02:17:30]  there you go  bravo  oh wow  play it lower because  no  really  who hears that  dogs  no one's hearing it  he's programming for dogs  what do you do eric no one hears that  hey uh what about what about the uh  satellite radio brought to you by  kennel ration  what about the nop  see it's a dog thing  pilot to bombardier  pilot to bombardier  we are over target  oh  oof  oof 
[02:18:00]  oof  i want to ask these guys about nopics  what  nopics  nopics  no block  no nopics  nopics  that's what you say when someone's taking a picture  of your brother  nopics  oh we lost our it guy that's why  all right well  hey  hey liz  um  like i said we lost our it guy  you already shown you don't have the knowledge jack  no i don't really  yeah i do  you didn't know what forensic toll kit was  everyone knows that one  exactly  a forensic tool kit 
[02:18:30]  toll  exactly  okay  oh i got easy pass  i'm here to take these  you sure do  i have to get on the bomb highway  believe me  i almost fired that one out too  i was like  that's great  bomb highway  i can't find the exit  it's around here somewhere  i hope so 
[02:19:00]  jesus  what was the song dumbbellies are saying  hey  what was that fucking song  what  mickey rooney song and bill  oh oh oh yeah  all right  my friend my  billy boy billy boy  where have you gone  darling billy  i went down to the town

[02:37:00]  in in a few minutes  we were just talking  a little hollywood real  quick this got  jonathan banks yeah he  was in um beverly  hills cop one of the  bad guys he was a  definitive bad guy in  80s movies and uh  he's i saw i was  watching breaking bad  last night and he's  in that but he's so  fucking old now like  you look at him and  barely recognize him  see you can that's him 
[02:37:30]  from the old days  that's that guy no  yeah see see like  remember him that guy's  old now that guy's that  guy no that guy's that  guy even i know that  guy yeah you know the  guy i wouldn't  recognize him as that  guy now no i saw him  and i was like wait  that guy looks familiar  wow and then just like  it's because he had that  weird kind of wow  crooked no way that  guy's been in a million  movies besides beverly  hills yeah he was he was  always the bad guy in  the 80s movies he's a 
[02:38:00]  guy that shot um he  shot eddie murphy's  buddy in uh the  beginning of beverly  hills cop okay  michael tandino  yeah and and in  breaking bad he plays  like almost kind of a  uh uh the wolf kind  of a guy from pulp  fiction sure problem  solver and um he's  he's fucking old they  got makeup on him  though no he's just  fucking old man how  long uh ago was  beverly hills cop  though 25 wow 20  wow fucking eight  that's 27 years 27 
[02:38:30]  28 years ago yeah  yeah wow you know  but you look at eddie  murphy and he just  looks a little chubbier  in the face because  black don't crack black  don't crack man if the  black man got something  it's that fucking  anti-aging thing you  know they average age  of death is 55 but you  know florida welfare  recipients must now  pass drug test i know  uh jimmy was tweeting  about this yesterday  because the people the  aclu is of course  against it they're  objecting they they're  so predictable and 
[02:39:00]  anyone who's like oh  it's civil liberty we  have the right as the  fucking public if we're  gonna give you public  free money right public  funds they can drug  test you for certain  jobs right we have the  right to say you're not  gonna waste this money  on fucking drugs if  you're on her on yeah  that's an absolutely  legitimate why would  they have a problem  with that because they  just they like to  complain about it's  what they do they never  put things in a context  i i know someone was  asking you what about  the children it's not  their fault that the 
[02:39:30]  mommy's on the her  on because you really  the mother's responsible  irresponsible enough to  not work and to  collect welfare and to  be on drugs but she's  gonna be responsible to  take the drug money and  spend it on food don't  be idiots so if they  don't pass the drug test  you take the the the  children away from the  mama that shit away  was on the her on yeah  it's like you that's a  solution i i'm not gonna  be blackmailed because  their kids oh shit well  they're not gonna feed  the kids they're not  gonna feed them anyway if  they're doing drugs  because chances are if  you're doing drugs you're  spending the little money  you make on welfare to 
[02:40:00]  buy drugs to buy the  drugs we absolutely have  the right to ask for  drug testing enough  yeah alcohol no alcohol  is a legal substance i  agree with you of course  the aclu fights of course  they do does it really  does it really happen that  you're not allowed to  smoke in parks in new  york city now are people  are they enforcing that  you know the shit that  we breathe in living in  new york city please  they're fucking just the  piss smell language  someone said that we're  still breathing in shit  from the ground zero when  when the wind kicks up 
[02:40:30]  we're still getting some  poisons ten years yeah  break they've been  digging that shit up but  now you you know i'm not  a big fan of the smoker but  i i also am logical enough  to know if someone's  smoking in the park and  you get a quick whiff it's  not really gonna do  anything to me unless i'm  getting that quick whiff  over and over and over  again for many many years  i would like to know how  is that how is that a  problem i'd like to know  what health effect uh we 
[02:41:00]  get from brake drum and  power brake pad dust that  alone because with the  traffic in new york city  there's constant braking  stop and go traffic a lot  of that dust just goes into  the street gets blown up  into the air you breathe it  in what the fuck i bet that  is contributes hugely to  lung fucking damage right and  disease absolutely that's  probably one of the worst  things but no one wants  to acknowledge that but 
[02:41:30]  like no one really thinks  about it because it's such a  minute thing you know well  how about dumb it down  further um city bus city  buses a city bus goes by  with that exhaust shit how  many dumb little cigarettes  do you have to smell in a  park somewhere before you get  one  before it equals one  before it equals one of  those yes big puffs of smoke  some asshole like throwing a  frisbee around he's got a 
[02:42:00]  cigarette in his mouth and  you might get catch a whiff  maybe if the wind's blowing  correctly how is that worse  than uh what's happening with  city buses going by people  have the right to feel uh that  their health is not being  impeded upon oh oh is that a  penis let me suck it  uh she is good huh just crazy  shit mayor  come on ladies just crazy shit 
[02:42:30]  though yeah dumb dumb crazy shit  it's another one of these you  know i'm in charge fucking laws  he just throws those in place  whenever he wants but once again  it goes with the easy shit that's  an easy one to do but what you  know tackling the exhaust coming  out of city buses that's a major  issue that's gonna take take a  lot to change yeah so go after  the dumb smoker that's in a park  that's huge with wind blowing  well because they could get they  get a fuckload of money out of  that that's true too i i think it's 
[02:43:00]  a revenue stream myself all about  revenue right because you know  whatever every every state is  doing their uh their part to uh  try to come up with cash uh and  and they're doing it in great ways  too i know over there in jersey  watch your ass new yorkers watch  your ass going into the fucking  tunnels what happened because uh  they're setting up speed traps  before you get to the tunnels i know  these things they're setting up speed 
[02:43:30]  traps so if you if you you're  speeding you got a new york plate  they'll fucking zap you and ticket you  before you go into new york and then  uh now you're getting in jersey is  getting new yorkers money to pay off  their fucking shit it's amazing and  they got shit that needs to be paid  off huh yep yeah yeah and then you  know you get uh their governor over  there flying around fucking helicopters 
[02:44:00]  going to his kids fucking baseball  games oh really oh really i'm gonna  christy he's gonna be eating his dick  on this one he's got to uh he's got to  address it in a speech today but um yeah  governor christy over there in jersey  was using a helicopter to uh chopper  himself to one of his kids ball games  i have no problem with it as long as  he wasn't landing on the pitcher's  mound yeah no it was probably pretty  close but that's you know taxpayer  money and it's they're they're  strapped i mean they're cutting back  on police and fire oh god and he's 
[02:44:30]  fucking taking uh goddamn helicopters  why to his kids fucking baseball games  traffic was bad or i guess where he  figures is faster yeah he didn't want  to go but he could have just driven  real fast like corzine yeah but but in  this day he's got to think someone's  going to catch him doing that and they  did democrats obviously are going to be  all over that shit yeah they ain't gonna  let him get away with it should be i mean  oh yeah yeah i believe hey look i you  know i'm a republican but you know when  when they do dumb shit like that you got 
[02:45:00]  to say uh you put yourself you put  yourself in uh perfect position for the  democrats to jump all over your shit  dummy uh we're gonna have glenn close  next week on the show  who's he and how close it's a woman  why you gotta take everything and just  make it stupid sorry chip  there's no winning with chip but  imagine if she was a guy her name would  be john glenn close  is paris here i wouldn't unfortunately 
[02:45:30]  no very close though i think you'll you'll  know because there will be what i like  to call a hoopla a hoopla in the hallway  you will see pandemonium excitement uh as  they bring kind of like when i walk in  the building yeah exactly without the the  boredom and disinterested part which i  would bring when i walk in the building great  all right that means we gotta do filler  if what do we uh talk to glenn close  about like um um did you really cook a 
[02:46:00]  rabbit go yeah so what's where have you  been for the where where the hell have  you been what happened to you wait just  because she used to be famous why are we  taking her roland tricked me on this one  he tricked me too because he goes i'm  thinking about it i don't give a fuck about  her i don't mind talking to her i  wouldn't i i would have said no but  yeah i mean all right so but the way  he this is where roland is smart kind of  tricked me he tricked all of us because  he goes i'm really close it's 99 i'm  working on an a-lister so all of a sudden 
[02:46:30]  he says that and you go oh good who you  don't think let me make a judgment on  whether or not i want this person i'm  thinking maybe will smith exactly maybe  uh who else he didn't say what decade  the a-lister was from yeah that's fair  enough yeah what are we doing i don't  care where is he he's getting good he is  getting good he's getting good this is  our fault though i mean he did fucking he  did trick us by the way he set it up he  is as my father would say a sneaky pete 
[02:47:00]  sneaky pete oh he's downstairs waiting  for paris hilton yeah what should be  like what i don't understand what words  you're saying opie's a blonde guy and  and then he's a hat and jim and anthony's  did you get this here's roland asking me  something uh did you get the ticket  that they give you yeah what am i i'm not  hearing right what did you just say  hey did you get that send you we're doing 
[02:47:30]  filler i've always wanted to ask jimmy this  sure oh you sit the closest to guests yes i  do are you ever like freaked out no because  like i have a buffer i got this whole i  got this and that and a whole bunch of  shit between me and the guest love is and  ants got some buffers but you're lots of  buffers sometimes you turn around and  they're 18 inches from you totally fine  the only time i've been freaked out um  was the first time in xm when ozzy came  in and he was right there gene simmons got  me at any w that's many many years ago i 
[02:48:00]  hadn't introduced i was so scared because  it was gene and when ozzy was in and i  loved ant that day because you were so  good with him you were so good with ozzy  and i was panicking because i don't think  i'd ever sat down with ozzy no at that  point you hadn't that's right i fucking  helped out pretty good that day too i  remember that day where me and ant are  both looking at you like oh my god he's  not talking it's his hero that was  funny but i thought i said to myself this  is ozzy osmore and i just started  talking to him and i figured how the  trip but that that day i was nervous  because i was sitting too close to  i hadn't talked to enough like guys 
[02:48:30]  who i love like ozzy and uh you know  there's some guys i really didn't care  about as much about and now your pals  that was 2005 yeah so uh but now even  when ozzy comes in i'm always nervous  because i like to be nervous around i  feel like i love him so much but yeah i'm  not uncomfortable talking to him i  actually requested that was the only  time uh patrick in wyoming what's  going on isn't glenn close married to  your guys his favorite godfather character  or was married to him before he died uh  who's our favorite godfather character

[02:49:30]  kazale died but that was uh meryl  streep's boyfriend that was meryl  streep her fiance right she was married  to fredo  john kazale what oh he's dead hey if i  know because the guy's dead  i'm trying to think about when brando  died too but she wasn't married to him  no that's why i say fredo  talia shire's still alive and she's not  a lesbian so that rules her out if luke  eric was alive today yeah he'd be 70  that's right  he was minus three when he played for the 
[02:50:00]  yankees  really a phenom  first of all if he was alive today he  wouldn't be moving too well no that we  know  he would pretty much be a statue at this  point  uh he would be a hundred and seven years  old  wow  but he could have made it to a hundred  i mean if you didn't get that man in  the world  luke eric thing  yeah  but uh look when we got back on radio  he would have been he could have been  a hundred  a hundred  that's kind of weird to think that he  possibly could have been alive if he  didn't get that fucking disease his  paracillin here  yeah 
[02:50:30]  oh who's the uh  oh my god  oh  but no i know it's really weird  here comes roland  roland  we got one assistant  let's see how many  two three four five  you always know  eight  uh niner  you always know  three  there's the photographer  four  she comes always with photographers  five  yeah  i think we hit it right on the head  five or six  i think we hit it right on the noggin  really  with that one  yeah i think we're done  damn she looks sexy 
[02:51:00]  wow  cell phones  what are they bringing around  cell phones  okay  what is hillary talking to her about  i don't know  what is hillary talking to her about  everybody's busy  oh okay  what's going on there  what happened sam  she's  getting something to eat  she looks really good  really  wow  she's what  she looks good  she's still man  look at her  yes sam  she's ordering a little brekkie 
[02:51:30]  well that's good  brekkie  i want to punch you  that's they call in england  do they  yeah  how do you know  i live there  in england you're a cigarette  i didn't live in england  hey dude that's why  the schedule  and the costume  no  i asked you once  why you talk so silly  yeah  and then you  you wind up that  hello  hi paris  how are you  take a seat  welcome to the show  we're on the air by the way  people don't usually  realize we're on the air  hello 
[02:52:00]  hi  how many  we were trying to guess  how many people  do you come with  we guessed five  a publicist  assistant  photographer  somebody from the network  and who was the other  and one security  was five accurate  or no  um  yeah it was  oh  plus roland texted me  he said five or six people  i'm weird when i travel  like i never like  to have people around  i'm so like  i don't like people touching me  before i have to be  like are you weird like that  no one wants to touch you 
[02:52:30]  fair enough i'm not saying  that everybody's trying to  get their hands on this piece  i'm just  i don't like being bothered  before i'm interviewed  did you like roland  was he nice to you  yes very  yeah  did he creep you out a little bit  no  because he talks really odd  nobody understands what he's saying  he's like  and he has to nod and go  all right i guess that kind of  made sense  so now you're uh  wandering around uh  promoting  the world according to paris  yes  on oxygen  wednesdays 10 p.m 
[02:53:00]  yeah  saw the first episode  yeah  and it starts with uh  you really freaked out  over a stalker  yes i have a couple of those  but uh  this guy was in your uh  in your house  um yeah he showed up  with two huge knives  right  and um  thank god  my boyfriend was there to  what a creep  protect me  how close did he get  because i mean  you live in a big place  obviously  um yeah  he was like  right by the kitchen  and um  we got him  so thank god  he didn't get to me  you're not packing any heat 
[02:53:30]  i'm not  you gotta pack some heat there paris  we have some heat at the house  so  nice  they talk about  dummy bringing knives to a gunfight  her boyfriend pulled a gun  good for him  but it's like a reality show  normally doesn't deal with stuff that heavy  i was kind of surprised  that they opened with something  that was like  a guy who was actually  she's like he was there to stamper  yeah yeah  that wasn't like  a light lighthearted way to open a show  the show opens huge  absolutely  why didn't he uh  shoot  um  he had every right to shoot  right  because it would have been too much  it's a mess right  yeah you didn't want to clean up the blood 
[02:54:00]  and all that  that'd be funny  they could play wacky music  while you're just cleaning up blood  and you're both digging a hole in the yard  ah what are we gonna do with this guy  that would make for great reality show  it really would  that would be good  you're murdering and burying stalkers  oh that paris  boy would people be shocked at the first episode  yes  coming up next week  the murder of the guy who's been bothering her on twitter  you tease it every week  some new creep is dead  yeah you say you get a lot of uh stalkers  and stuff like that  i'm sure there are probably different levels  like guys that come to your house with knives 
[02:54:30]  and then  and then uh  guys uh  on on twitter and online  and stuff like that  you get a lot of harassment that way  um  there's a lot of weird people out there  yeah  i just don't bitch  i block them on twitter  you do  do you  do you take some of that to heart  like  we talk to a lot of people  and uh  some people  say  well i don't care what they say  or something like that  but do  do some people kind of  you read something you go you son of a bitch  you kind of got  yet like they kind of got to you  a little bit  you know  i'm a human just like anyone else  so if i read something  no way 
[02:55:00]  it's ridiculous  you're a superhuman  i don't really pay attention anymore  really  yeah  there's been so many  lies and ridiculous things written about me  that  at this point  i don't pay attention to it  it is a little hard to figure out  what's true  and what's not about you  because there has been so much written over the years  and uh  some of it like  so outrageous  that you're like  that can't possibly be true  and then other things  that it's like  all right i could see that  but um  have you read things that  you're like  wow where the hell did this come from 
[02:55:30]  it's complete fabrication  it happens all the time  really  there's actually  this lookalike  and she lives in la and new york  and  i always get blamed for things that she does  oh sure there  there  no i'm not kidding  you can literally go online  and she has a website  she looks exactly like me  if she puts sunglasses on  what was the worst thing she uh  did as you  she  like during new york fashion week  she'll go to all the shows  and sit front row  she'll go to the gifting suites  and get all this free stuff  pretending it's me  damn  it's just  annoying  yeah 
[02:56:00]  wow  for you  for her that's great  i wish i looked like somebody  other than just  i just look like somebody  that doesn't belong  in any kind of  an event  like even when i belong there  they're like  do you have id  what is uh  what is your relationship  with the paparazzi  because we always wonder  like  because they're so hateable  but then again  celebrities use them  because they can  help promote the film  before it comes out  i mean they do serve a purpose  so do you kind of have  a love-hate relationship  with them  you know just like anything  there's good and bad  they are really annoying  when it's every single day  following me  everywhere i go  so i think it's okay 
[02:56:30]  to be at like  a red carpet event  where they're supposed to be  but just everyday life  it just gets  really invasive  well you  like there's a scene  in the show  where you had community service  and you had to kind of  clean walls  as part of the community service  and the paparazzi  is literally five feet away  just snapping photos  is that irritating  or is that like  that kind of comes  at the territory  i've been doing this  for 15 years  so it's been  a very long time  you just get used to that  but the community service  she didn't take it seriously  jimmy  she was goofing around  a little bit  yeah it wasn't  exactly heavy sentences 
[02:57:00]  that she wasn't  painting the wall  properly  even community service  you like having  a little bit of fun  well she brought  another person  i just want to show her  that i saw the show  she brought her assistant  so it was two people  working on the wall  that day  so she's thinking  maybe she should get  double time  it's a good idea right  because you brought  people with you  yeah she brought it up  too and the guy  like who could care less  that Paris is painting  a wall  wasn't happy with you  what was the  community service for  um i just have to do  something for a little  thing 
[02:57:30]  a little thing  yeah  it was a little uh  possible  a little mishap  jesus  really  your assistant by the way  you're out of your mind  you're a little  you're a little too wild  i think  no not anymore  not anymore  have you  i'm so busy  i run a huge brand  i have 17 different  product lines  i am constantly  traveling the world  working  so um  yeah i'm way too busy  no much  no more time for  like complete shenanigans  or  no i'm actually  getting up every morning  early and  sucks  living life to the fullest 
[02:58:00]  do you still stay  up late though a little bit  not really  take a drink every so often  not really  no more partying for Paris  now i've grown up  christ  does spending time in jail  kind of change you at all  like did it make you go like  ugh  like i really don't want to do  something that  causes me to come here for a  long period of time  i spent one night in jail  doing a radio stunt  and i'm like i will never  go back  misbehaving  one night  made me never want to go back  it's just a disgusting  horrible place  yeah it's pretty brutal  so what did it do for you 
[02:58:30]  did it make you  not want to get high anymore  or party anymore  or what did  how did it change you  i've really grown up  i'm an adult  and um  i just  i have so much to live for  do you see other celebrities  like uh lindsey  and go like  oh boy  what she's going through  like  you want to smack her  in the face or something  no i wish her the best  you know  yeah but there's got to be  something in you  that goes like  okay i've been there  i've seen what  what  where that leads  um  i just wish her the best  you know  she's going through a lot 
[02:59:00]  and  i thank god  that i have such  an incredible family  behind me  and i think that's  what it's about  yeah that's just it  like you  you don't have any  of these uh  deep-seated family  problems uh  that that would  would have led you  to do uh  things like drugs  and hanging out  and partying and shit  um  so what do you  attribute that to  just wanting to  have fun as a kid  yeah i think everyone  goes through things  when they're younger  and you experience life  and you learn  from your mistakes  not with cameras around 
[02:59:30]  though not everybody  anyway  yeah that's true  it seems true  it's like in la at least  celebrities it's hard  to a lot of times  celebrities  get away with more  and it almost like  it kind of sets you up  for when  when they fall  what is that about  nothing i just want to  come here to talk  about the show  i don't really  want to talk about  lindsey and things  like that  it's kind of a waste  of time  just kind of talking  about like  i was actually  i was  i'll tell you  contributing it to you  though  i was actually  talking about you  i was saying  yeah  i saw the look 
[03:00:00]  yeah but the question  was celebrities  get away with more  does it make it harder  because without certain  things stopping you  along the way  when you finally do  get in trouble  it's big  so that's  kind of what i was  yeah  getting at  all right let's move on  okay tell us all  about the show  i guess we'll just  talk about the show  the world according to  paris is amazing  and it's on every  wednesday on oxygen  at 10 p.m  and um  yeah everyone was  writing me on twitter  and saying how much  they love it  and how funny it  is so i'm very  proud  are you annoyed 
[03:00:30]  and excited  you sound annoyed  now  it's very early  in the morning  i'm tired  she sounds annoyed  i know i've been  on a press tour  all week  you know  it's been a lot  of work  we didn't want  to annoy you  i'm a little annoyed  are you annoyed  jimmy  yeah  jimmy gets very  annoyed  only because i'm  not i'm not  i'm not asking  a jerk question  and i'm not being  a dick  i watch the show  i like the show  more than i thought  i would like it  i thought it was  ballsy the way  they started off  but it's a legit 
[03:01:00]  question  it's not it's not  a hey what about  i'm not trying to  get a sound bite  i mean it's a real  question and the show  is a reality show  yeah  so kind of asking  about your reality  i think is fair game  it's somebody asking  in some tabloid way  yeah it was more  like just lifestyle  question  does it make it  harder  yeah  i understand jimmy  paris didn't  fair enough  she doesn't want to  talk about that  no  she wants to talk  about the show  that's why i'm here  what uh  well what uh  what other um  hijinks uh  you get into in the 
[03:01:30]  show  you know every episode  you never know it's  gonna happen  my life is very  unpredictable  yeah  skydiving  traveling  going all around  the world  kind of an honest  assessment of what  you you go through  in your your daily  life  yeah  following around  the cameras  interacting with  your family and  friends  everyone it's  it's it's pretty  crazy  your assistant  your assistant  writes porn  and there's a  conflict about that  i don't know if  i'm allowed to go  there uh but it's  in the show so i 
[03:02:00]  figured i'd ask  about it um did  she did she stay  away from writing  it because i know  that she had to  make a decision so  what did she  finally do  you have to stay  tuned and watch  the show and  find out  but i wasn't  happy  all right  you're a tough  one paris  you're a little  tough  you know we  have a lot of  people in and  out of here  and uh  uh some are  easy  some a little 
[03:02:30]  tough you threw  us a little  with that um  that little spin  around and the  want to talk  about the show  thing but the  show if the  show's about  your life  you know we  were just kind  of leading up  to getting to  know you a  little more  about your  life and stuff  so huge  i think it  kind of i think  you kind of  took that in a  weird way  i think a lot  of people  followed her  lead i mean  you've moved  on to other  things but you  know the  partying and  the the oopsie  shots coming  and going in  yeah you kind  of you kind  of were you  know at the  forefront of  that whole thing  that was going 
[03:03:00]  on you introduced  the world to  kim kardashian  where are you  at with her  we're great  we're fine  you guys are  still friends and  all yeah i wish  her the best  she wishes  everyone the best  i know i'm  happy for her  that's great  but you're  getting married  and i'm really  happy for her  you don't hang  out anymore  with her though  i'm so busy  i'm traveling  the world all  the time so i  don't really have  time to hang  out with all  my friends  oh i got a  good question  uh obviously  you grew up  with uh  nicole ritchie  lionel ritchie's  uh daughter  uh what about  that big clay  head in lionel 
[03:03:30]  ritchie's uh  video hello  you ever see it  um no i  haven't seen  that i love  that song  though  god i'm  obsessed with  the big clay  head  i have to  check it out  yeah  on youtube  i haven't  seen it  because i  thought it  was uh  i thought it  was on display  somewhere in  uh lionel ritchie's  house and i  would assume you  would have been  there at some  point in your  life yes  and seen the  big clay head  i haven't seen  that one  oh well  jimmy  check it out  next time  i'm trying to  think of  something from  the show  there is a 
[03:04:00]  scene where  she's driving  a pink rolls  royce i think  which is a  nice car  is that  yours  it's a  bentley  thank you  yes  what's it  like to  just be so  completely rich  i've worked  for everything  that i've  achieved  stop  so i feel  very blessed  i thank god  every day  now worked  in what way  um well i  run 17  different product  lines  i have  created my  entire business 
[03:04:30]  out of it  i've been  working since  i'm 15  years old  yeah what  was your  first job  making a  model  a model  yes  well that  makes sense  i would  never  i'm not  going to  dismodels  did you have  a preconceived  notion about  because a lot  of people come  in here and  they think that  we're going to  be a certain  way or they  think that we're  going to be  aggressive with  them or they  think that we're  going to try to  do something  awful so they  kind of come in  defensive because  they're expecting  something that  we're not going  to honestly  yeah i've seen  that before  i've seen it  happen and i've  walked into radio  stations or  whatever i think  that they're going  to be a certain 
[03:05:00]  way and it's  okay did you  have a preconceived  notion about us  honestly no  no she's just on  it she's just on  the radio tour  she's being very  defensive about  about like like i  could see the way  you're sitting like  you're on guard and  you don't need to be  like i don't know  what we're not  trying to screw you  over we're trying to  help you promote the  show but it's a  reality show when  we're asking you  about life and  you're getting like a  little right the  world according to  paris yeah it's on  that wednesday is a  10 on the oxygen  huge so we thought  we could talk about  the world yeah  that world according 
[03:05:30]  to you which is  very different than  the average person  that's why it makes  for a good show  yeah right yeah  exactly so as as  the season goes on  what kind of  situations uh we're  going to see you in  um everything it's  there's a lot of  fighting going on  there's a lot of  drama there's  fighting and drama  with who family  members um with my  friends my boyfriend  my mom just like  anyone how's your  relationship going  good it's going  really good i'm  really happy yeah 
[03:06:00]  oh that means  you've been going  out um like a  year and a half  year and a half  oh that means they  don't break up  during the show  well how do you  know because the  show's already  filmed oh damn  it what uh there  is a good fight  scene in the first  one yeah i'm in  the car i won't  give it away you  have to stay tuned  there is a good  argument which i  did enjoy watching  um yeah jimmy's  really annoyed yeah  i am but uh  whatever i mean i  did enjoy the show  i'm not going to  tell you i didn't  like the show i  didn't expect to  like the show but 
[03:06:30]  i did and it's not  i'm not your target  demo thank you but  i did like the show  i thought uh the  way you started was  uh and i'm even  saying this irritated  i i have to be very  honest the way it  started was uh was  ballsy i didn't expect  them to go into a  genuine statement  about stalkers it  wasn't it wasn't  cute it was done for  real and uh they  address stalkers a  little bit who i have  a particular hatred  for yeah and the  way you address them  and kind of mocked  them and shit on  them a little bit i  thought was uh i like 
[03:07:00]  that a lot again i  don't want to give  away any dialogue just  stay tuned watch the  show and you'll get  everything roland's  doing the uh wrap up  signal that's a shame  but uh doing a wrap  up signal all right  they were worried we  were going to talk  about the sex tape we  weren't going to fuck  with you for that none  of that stuff i mean we  were just going to ask  real questions just real  little lifestyle  questions but it's all  about the world  according to paris uh  10 p.m of course on  oxygen yes uh so uh  tune in is it a  thank you very much  for uh stopping by  thank you boys no i 
[03:07:30]  just was going to  wonder if it was  because for people to  watch a reality show  they want to know that  they're seeing your  life for real as it  is yes you cannot  write the things that  happen it's nuts i love  it i don't know if we  sold the show today no  we didn't sell it at  all we did oh  listeners don't like  her what yeah they  don't really like you  for some reason i  spoke i spoke highly  about the show but i  wasn't bullshitting when  i spoke highly about  the show i really  wasn't i mean if i  didn't like it believe  me right now i would 
[03:08:00]  tell you but i do  yeah yeah yeah yeah  yeah they're all  getting up to uh yeah  yeah roland's uh  standing at the window  um just peering out  but uh paris thank you  very much thank you  for stopping in and  uh good luck with the  show thank you guys  take care have a  fun morning we're not  going to get off the  air we're just going  to keep talking so yeah  feel free to remove  your headphones and  huge you know  whatever we even took  a photo together a while  ago i was gonna ask  you to sign up i don't  want to bother you  i don't mind are you  sure because i i mean i  hate to be more of a

[03:09:30]  what i got the quote  direct from her mouth  what  she said and i quote i am  not gonna sit and waste my  time being berated  end quote  when just now  yes walking out  but we didn't berate her  about what  i don't know her  one of the ladies in her  entourage was making  excuses out there that  she probably doesn't feel  like playing because she's  tired  we weren't playing  playing  we weren't we're doing  it's a reality show  the way it's called an  interview  when she comes in here 
[03:10:00]  i understand they want to  plug the show but we  can't just sit here for  10 15 minutes saying the  name of the show the time  it's on and who's in it  we have to get like the  people kind of you know  involved and and and  listening to her story and  maybe something that  what has hasn't been heard  what a spoiled human being  and i'm gonna tell you i i  bit my tongue  oh i know you're better of  the show yes and for you  roll and by the way we  fucking if we hear one word  of shit from a publicist  about that we i have never 
[03:10:30]  we were not rude to her i  have no no nobody said  anything i have never hear  something no no i'm not  gonna blast her now  they're on your side  though they're all on  your side they're more of  the what they were saying  yeah her number for you  what  i thought we should have  atom bombed her  no it wasn't  now that i'm thinking  you know what wasn't it  wasn't worth it wasn't  worth the listeners  burning bridges the  listeners  it was just too easy it 
[03:11:00]  was like she's just gonna  sit there and just walk  away like a baby  yeah yeah  and i was so fucking  aggravated  that out in my head i  there was no there was  no glaying into her it  just would hurt  relationships that  roland has with people  i don't want to fucking  do that but it was  obvious that she was  annoying us  beyond comprehension  back there all her  people not they said  nothing about you guys  or i was just saying  oh no she's having  one of those days  i don't care  i've never held back  like that i've never  i know again i'm not 
[03:11:30]  gonna say it now that  she's not i've never  held back like that in my  life you can call her  spoiled breath  hold on hold on hold  you get her back in  here for one more  question i'll give you  a thousand bucks  she ain't coming back  a thousand bucks i'll go  right to the fucking  uh bank  the fact that she  thought she was  berated i have one  more question is  mind-boggling  i have one more  question  i mean that's  awesome deal but i  don't think she  will come back  why  i don't know  because we're  despicable 
[03:12:00]  how are we  we're awful people  that we're trying  to just ask her  questions  i was so fucking  nice to her  there's nothing i hate  more than when you  how spoiled are you  where you think that  legit questions  do celebrities get  away with more and  does that eventually  hurt because you're  not getting stopped  on the way  that to me is a  you want to do a  that's a real question  and again i should i  should have fucking  look melted down with  her so i can't do it  now because she's gone  that that that's that's  a pussy move  yeah we hate when  yeah you're right  no i'm not gonna do  that but there were 
[03:12:30]  things that were  addressed when she was  here the lindsey  lohan thing and i said  to her i said we  weren't trying to get  anything out of you  that isn't just you  know because she had  the same experiences  growing up i was like  what do you think  about what she's going  through and what you  went through and equate  it and she's just like  take it back it's not  like i was saying  what's the dirt on  lindsey can you tell  me what you've seen  her do that's different  than saying she's going  through something that  you went through with  the press in your face 
[03:13:00]  while you're going  through this time what  you know she was  awful what's your  opinion on that  situation and she was  annoyed when i asked  the first question about  how many people but i  even equated it to  myself because i didn't  want her to think that  i was saying hey how  many people do you  travel with like a  dick i was just saying  that i i personally  hate when a publicist  comes with me anywhere i  hate being fawned over  before like i want to  be left alone so i was  like maybe you know do  you hate that does it  bug you to have so  many it's great just  atrocious so if you  want to watch the show  on the way she sold it  um fair enough it's  great i'm happy i i  said right in front of 
[03:13:30]  her where did it all  go wrong it was just  oh i i regret the  second she turned  around look oh yeah  yeah you know what i'm  getting a i'm gonna i'm  getting a great text  right now and i believe  this and now this  second uh seconds my  thought uh she feels  like she's too good to  be there i felt that  oh yeah i absolutely  felt yeah yeah yeah  and the reason she has  to be here is the  reviews on the show  are horrendous  horrendous  and also  whatever  uh i wrote 
[03:14:00]  i wrote this to someone  last night watching  paris's new show  not good  i i didn't like it  i thought it was better  i figured i would play  it cool for once  it's not my it's not  my i'm not her  target demo but it  was better than i  thought it was gonna  be i i again i can't  i gotta be honest or  i would have believe me  i would have blasted  it in front of me i  didn't watch it i  didn't like it i i  watched two seconds 
[03:14:30]  of it turned it off  i was a fan of the  simple life i thought  nicole richie was  hilarious this show  needs nicole richie  it's uh simple life  without nicole richie  i'm not gonna sit there  and be berated like  what are you talking  she did  to who on the way  out kenny just  said that  berated i've never  held that what's  you don't think that  you can be annoying  she uh atrocious  i love that way it  goes stop when she  says she didn't make  her own money  yeah it's like stop 
[03:15:00]  i i i it worked for  everything i have  families in the world  everyone knows you  didn't work for you  and that's why it was  maybe uh making some  money now  did you hear what she  said she runs 17  different brands  yeah yeah great  what's wrong with you  that's work let me how  many brands you run  there mister  well i run zero  none brands  exactly so shut  you up  i am i i  where's she now  uh she's doing  larry flick  um the out of  queue like a channel  thank you  all right so she's  gonna come walking  back this way  wait i don't want 
[03:15:30]  to fuck with her  now it's like she  was in and i didn't  blast her i should  have i i was like a  real conscious effort  i let her know i was  annoyed but i was  like what what's the  way to do it do you  blow it up and then  she just walks out and  we don't get guests  or what's the right  fucking move but that  was extraordinarily that  that interview could  have been played this  past weekend well part  two's around the corner  sorry during the awkward  interviews uh segment  uh sam roberts is in  studio sam sam roberts  did you hear the entire 
[03:16:00]  paris hilton interview  you bet i did uh  opinion comment what what  was happening how you  maybe would have handled  it just a little you know  give us something uh  well i was very excited  about the paris hilton  interview as i'm a big  pop culture junkie yeah  uh i kind of felt like  the way she responded to  the first question of  set the tone yeah and  she didn't really come out  of that that's not to say  it was a bad question  because uh another person  would have said yeah five 
[03:16:30]  yeah i mean i don't  really like them but it's  kind of necessary and  then you move on yeah to  the next thing she  immediately i mean she  was kind of shut down  before she got in i think  there was this feeling  i'm sorry she was like  that before yes because  she was ordering and  she didn't come right in  so uh and she didn't  take off her big yeah  giant sunglasses better  than better than better  than us better than the  room better than the  show she got the  impression she didn't  want to be here right  simple as that exactly  it was tough we i we  were going for an angle  there it's a it's it's  it's a reality show she  invented people being  famous for no fucking 
[03:17:00]  reason she has now moved  on to being famous for  other things but she  started out as just a  beautiful girl that's  famous and no one can  figure out why and  since then there has  been people like kim  kardashian uh believe  it or not lindsey lohan  lately is famous for  doing nothing but  partying and then and  showing you know parts  of her body by accident  so we were going  somewhere with all that  extremely pop the sex  tape up for when she  walks by extremely  pop the sex tape up  unrevealing and we'd  have to close this  block you have to  close the curtains 
[03:17:30]  extremely i'm really  not a revealing person  at all and if you're  going to watch a reality  show you would hope  that somebody revealed  it revealed something  like a legit question  was the girl who did  your uh your assistant  was writing porn did  she stay with that or  what did she do do you  really think that a  teaser like you have to  watch is more  interesting i know you  you went through a thing 
[03:18:00]  where i was listing shit  that's happened in the  show i had obviously  watched it right where  it's like hey uh what  happened with that  you'll have to watch  the show what was the  right move there because  i really wanted to be a  fucking dick and then i'm  like oh that was that  was an atom bomb  situation that we would  have been uh within our  means of doing we could  have but but again like  like jimmy even said it  could have been so easy  what and then she just  went uh smoky goodbye  she's she's not a tough  the thing was someone got  to her and said look if 
[03:18:30]  this show's gonna work  you're gonna have to do  things you've never done  before like radio you  know radio sucks to a  lot of these eight  listeners like why the  fuck do i have to do  radio shows but they  said look if if this  show's gonna have a  chance you're gonna have  to do all this stuff i'm  not gonna be out of  your comfort zone and  and instead of going  with it she came she  she sat out there  ordering breakfast  knowing that we were  like come on in and  then she sat down and  then she had her  glasses on and she was  just like yeah she was  a mope she was a  fucking mope because 
[03:19:00]  she didn't want to be  here she didn't give  that to pierce morgan  the other night she  was all chipper and  fucking uh rocking the  interview she's very  revealing with pierce  morgan i watched it  yeah she sat there  barely talking pulling  teeth to get three  words more than three  words at a time out of  her and we're the  fucking assholes i  apologize to the  audience i i apologize  they they aren't even  worth uh fucking i  don't know anything  good i don't know  not fucking these  people i meet them  they suck i don't at  all because it was  entertaining in another 
[03:19:30]  way man it was so  uncomfortable in here  but it was i was  openly laughing at how  uncomfortable i'm so  annoyed and i should  have been more  vocalized how  disgusted i was you  don't give your  your passive  aggressiveness and  your annoyances come  through it came  loudly and clearly  especially very very  clearly the audience  that knows you but  yeah but it's almost  like i can't i i want  to blast her right now  so bad my head almost  hurts but that was part  of the fun of like  even in the other room  us watching we were  all travis and me  were laughing because  we knew how badly you 
[03:20:00]  wanted to blast her and  we could sense that but  it's like jimmy jimmy  here's it she wasn't  giving anything that was  blast worthy right she  wasn't saying anything  mean she was just being  an i almost wish she had  been nasty exactly but  but here here's the deal  don't feel uh that you  can't voice your opinion  of how the interview went  how she was in in blunt  terms because uh we  understood and believe  me i understood also 
[03:20:30]  with the situation we  were in there are  people you can't burn  bridges i don't want to  get uh roland in a bad  position with publicists  and whatnot and that's  the only reason that i  kept my mouth shut but i  could call her a fucking  cunt now that she's not  here without feeling like  i'm a pussy for not  calling her a cunt when  she was here because uh i  didn't want to fuck with  the publicists and no no i  understand that game  works but the publicists  are one thing and we  we've been really good  with that but this was  legit she was awful and 
[03:21:00]  terrible interview terrible  interview not revealing  at all and it was like  one of those people who  didn't want to be here  yeah everything i despise  because i'm very revealing  in interviews yes and i  just again i can't blast  her now because i should  have blasted her when she  was here because she  deserved it what's one  thing you want to say  um you're a fucking  horrible interview you're  a you're an extraordinarily  coddled unrevealing person  not not to opie to her 
[03:21:30]  i'm not i just blonde hair  confused me  shut up  what i'm kidding  he's joking  we all trash each other  here  i was gonna say jimmy but  it's just funny  i was actually gonna say  me  um that i would love to  have said that but i  didn't so again it's a  it's it's to me it's an  absolute pussy move to  not say it and then say  it when they're out the  door and i just i mean  i've gone after people  before  what's two things you  would say to us  that was the main thing 
[03:22:00]  it's like your problem is  this is why you're  extraordinarily uninteresting  to me because you have  not one ounce of ability  to be revealing and  reveal something about  yourself  sam  um  sorry  i just i should have  told her that she stunk  as an interview  and not as an interview  she looked good she was  tired though  what we really did  we should have said  those words  we absolutely called her  i said that the listeners  uh aren't aren't digging  her they find her  what did i say i said 
[03:22:30]  they they don't like you  she did not leave here  thinking this went well  believe me  but she didn't care  because she didn't want  to be here to begin with  so she doesn't give a fuck  because she doesn't give a  fuck about radio  right  but someone got to her  and said this is what  you're gonna have to do  for this project  someone on twitter said  you completely caved  when you asked for your  picture signed  i will tell you  legitimately  that was kind of done  to be annoying  i'll never hang this  honestly i was beyond  being starstruck at that  point  i was legitimately  aggravated  that's why when  i was surprised she did 
[03:23:00]  it  when i said uh  uh roland  is saying wrap this up  it was like okay  you can take your  headphones off and  leave  like we're still gonna  stay  we're not going to  break to take pictures  with you  like it was in the  situation i knew  no one wanted a  fucking picture with  her  at that point  when jim said  uh i would ask you  to sign this but  i don't want to  bother you  yeah i don't want to  bother you  because i've been  aggressive  and then he goes  because i've been  such a bother  did i say that  yes you did  it was it was  funny  really  underestimate  like the brattiness 
[03:23:30]  and passive  aggressiveness that  you combat people  with it it hits on  a different level  it really does  but it's hard  it's nauseating  what you do  i know that but  again i'm only  saying it ain't  about me but i  literally if i'm  going to be a  certain way now  not that i wouldn't  have called her a  con because she  honestly didn't do  anything that merited  that's just  being verbally abused  like that  oh wait iraq iraq's  coming in do you  have something  no does he ever  iraq  ow he pushed me  she left  she's gone  she blew everybody 
[03:24:00]  else off  and the oxygen  people are like  why did we do  opie and anthony  you see they  blame us  fuck you you  fucking oxygen  cocksuckers then  how long ago  she blew off  every every other  station she was  supposed to  did she do  another interview  nope  and oxygen people  are like oh  opie and anthony  shouldn't have done  that show  we're not gonna  get the blame for  this  it's not our  fucking  don't blame us  because your  fucking client  was being an  uninteresting piece  of shit  she was terrible  and i've never  held back like that  in my life  yeah 
[03:24:30]  we held back  we were trying  to be nice  I couldn't have  been nicer  we were trying  to make it work  but you know  what this is  exactly what i  thought was gonna  happen when i  was thinking about  this interview  last night  i just knew  holy shit  it wasn't gonna  work  i could not  have been  fucking nicer  to her  i could  it was  rolling  no fucking  way man  i ain't taking  the blame for  this one  no fucking  way on this  one  there are times  where  i never said  anything  no no  i'm giving you  ammunition now  no fucking  way on this  one  there are times 
[03:25:00]  like yeah  i guess we  might have pushed  it or that  no fucking  way  let me see it  look at the  unsigned  e-rock  the unsigned  picture of  e-rock and  paris hilton  unsigned  forever  forever unsigned  that's funny  and look he's got  one hand in his  pocket  not forever  you want it to  look like you two  are going out  you want to put  this on  classmates.com 
[03:25:30]  me and my  girlfriend paris  hilton  would have done  it a long time  ago  oh e-rock  i'm sorry  it's not even  the bad one  remember this one  oh wait wait  there's another one  this is the one  you guys gave me  shit for  oh with your  bedroom eyes  you guys remember  this one  e-rock with his  bedroom eyes  look at this  sure look at  e-rock  he's in love  where's she now  what are you  what are you  doing roland  roland  the information  you need to  make a few 
[03:26:00]  phone calls  you need to  get some  fucking answers  rolling  and again  oxygen may  have just  fucked them  but again  they might not  have heard the  interview  they may just  her publicist  was right here  so  no no but  did oxygen  hear it  no her publicist  seemed almost  cool with  everything  i'm gonna call  that network  carbon monoxide  from now on  it's a chemical  joke  attaboy  she was fine  with it  and oxygen  for the interview  she was atrocious 
[03:26:30]  horrid  and i literally  again  travis has a clip  of jim being  passive aggressive  i don't mind  that i didn't  curse at her  passive aggressive  i don't know if  that is the  aggressive aggressive  i think  i have a clip  of how jim  decided to ask  questions after  okay  after  okay  all right  it's  it's pretty  crazy  your assistant  your assistant  writes porn  and there's a 
[03:27:00]  conflict about that  i don't know if  i'm allowed to go  there  uh but it's in the  show so i figured  i'd ask about it  um did she  did she stay away  from writing it  yeah that just  sounds i should  have been more  aggressive  i should i should  have told her the  truth  i should have just  said that you're  you're right now  being extraordinarily  unrevealing  and horrendous  but i didn't  and i'm annoyed  at myself for  not so again  i apologize to  the audience  i don't think i  should have called  her a cunt  i shouldn't have  screamed fuck  you get out  none of that  nonsense but i  should have been  brutally honest  god damn rich  cunt 
[03:27:30]  god damn rich  cunt  i'm disgusted  with myself  well i did say  uh we're gonna  continue talking  so take your  headphones off  and leave  basically  yeah well that's  true  we did get  some little  fucking jabs  in  jimmy like  that was a weird  position for for  this show  because because we  were trying very  hard to be nice  and the interview  was short enough  where we couldn't  really step over  the line  it was weird  we were in a weird  position i know 
[03:28:00]  believe me i i'm  going a little nuts  here that we didn't  really unload and i  know you were  holding back  uh because you  know you you  we've seen what  you've done with  with jesse ventura  and shit it's like  you reach a point  where someone's  being an asshole  and you call them  out on it and she  wasn't completely  called out on it  but she knew to  the point where  she left the  fucking building  she left the  building and blew  off all interviews  and blew off all  the other other  interviews  see the thing is  she was abysmal  and i know when  we're aggressive  but i know how i 
[03:28:30]  felt when she came  in it was like oh  cool she's here i  watched the show i  wrote down some  fucking question it  wasn't like  we like and i  even answered  hold on out  q's ripping us  but they don't  know what happened  we'll get to the  bottom of that  shit calling us  oh don't say  bottom  are they ripping  into us  get to the sloppy  party bottom of  that one  did they get an  interview or are  they blaming  i think they're  blaming us  blaming us  we did nothing  she was atrocious  every station that  was supposed to have  her is going to  blame us for  fucking that up 
[03:29:00]  they're going to  complain to  management and  we're going to  catch the shit for  being mean to  paris hilton  no we won't  fuck you  fuck her  fuck oxygen  fuck out q  fuck everyone  fuck it  fuck fuck  fuck a fuck  i'm tired of  it uh joan  connecticut  yeah uh yeah  i flipped over  to out q radio  real quick  that means you're  yeah  yes go ahead  what happened  uh he called  you guys a bunch  of fucking  assholes saying  you're fucking  up other live 
[03:29:30]  shows trying to  be howard stern  without the name  howard stern  why you  fuck you  suck a cock  suck a cock  i've had it  oh he went  off  ah son of a  bitches  ah you  fuck things  up  ass  yeah  we were  fucking  what bothers  me  nope sorry  i'm not taking  the heat on  this one  she was an  abysmal  cunt  fucking  interview  she was  awful  she terrible  why don't  you fucking  before out  q blasts us  why don't you 
[03:30:00]  fucking learn  what happened  instead of  attacking us  you fucking  idiots  she came in  with a horrible  attitude that we  were trying to  work through  usually when  someone comes in  with an attitude  like that  we don't even  try to work  through it  we're evil  right off the  bat  never  never held  back like  that  she was  awful  we watched  the show  we asked  about the  show  i complimented  the way the  show started  i said i  thought it  was ballsy  i liked  where it  went with  the stalkers  i couldn't  have been  fucking  nicer to  her  pull the  tape of  the show  first  listen to  the whole 
[03:30:30]  interview  and then tell  us when we  turn into  assholes  alright  you alternative  lifestyle  motherfuckers  tell us  when we  turned into  assholes  what's going  on now  if it's  any  consolation  talent  she's gone  and talent  does not  think that  you guys  did anything  wrong  well why  doesn't talent  go tell  out you  so they can  apologize on  the air  we're nice  to those  fucking guys  when we  see them  we are  instead of  giving us  the benefit  of the doubt  and going  well maybe  she was  awful  they automatically  wait  wait  nicole  did you  guys lose  because of 
[03:31:00]  us  did you  lose  paris hilton  because of  us nicole  from the  morning  matchup  she was  atrocious  we had  nothing to  do with it  i know you  didn't  i've interviewed  her  she's the  worst interview  ever  she's terrible  she has nothing  to say  no nothing  but i mean  i can be brutal  and i was  consciously  asking like  real questions  like you want  to be treated  like a real  person  we can't give  you a coddled  brat interview  but i was phrasing  things like  this is where  she got annoyed  and i was like  do you think  that celebrities  get away with  a lot of stuff  and the point  i was making  was that it  makes it harder  because once  they finally do 
[03:31:30]  have to answer  they've already  gone farther down  the road  i asked her  hey how did  spending time  in jail  change you  like that's  an opportunity  to say hey  it made me  not want to  do this  this and that  and this dummy  didn't know  what she was  being fed  question was  don't worry  you're completely  not everybody's  defending you  you guys didn't  do anything wrong  perfectly good  interview  now granted  maybe we should  reverse the order  maybe you guys  shouldn't be first  because it's a  little bit  no we continue  to be first  yeah  but the thing is  we did nothing  that would have  led to a 
[03:32:00]  bad interview  she was horrible  we did our  best to  make the  interview  move along  probably hungover  or something  in terms of  why she was  here  they said  their main  prerogative  in coming to  Sirius  was to hit  who they  usually hit  but they  wanted to  reach a  guy audience  for this  show  and they  said as  long as  the guys  watched the  first episode  which i  did  i made it  perfectly clear  i did  and who  else has  a guy  audience  here  there was  a hockey 
[03:32:30]  game on  last night  i missed  some of  it  i'm like  shit  i promised  i would  see this  show  what did  you think  about the  show  it's not  good  it's really  bad  i tried to  make matt  my fiancee  watch  he's like  i'm not  watching this  crap  he was not  happy  it's not  good but  i said to  roll and i'm  like but i'm  gonna play this  one cool which  i rarely do  everyone knows  that but i'm  like you know  what it's not  that good it  needs nicole  richie  simple life  was a great  show because  nicole richie  was hilarious  and played  off paris  very well  this is not 
[03:33:00]  one of them  was do you  think celebrities  have a much  easier time  getting away  with things  because i knew  where i was  going with  that  can you be  going to  ask that  question  yeah  and i  started off  i made the  point about  she had to  stay with  her sister  because a  stalker with  a knife  her boyfriend  pulled a gun  it was kind  of a heavy  way to start  a fun reality  show i wrote  that down as a  point to address  then i put  community service  you have  here's one of  the questions  i was gonna  ask you had a  problem with  your new assistant  who writes  porn but you 
[03:33:30]  got very  famous  off a  sex tape  and you  refer to it  as a  sex tape  nightmare  wasn't a  kind of a  double-edged  sword  meaning it  made her  more famous  i didn't ask  that one but  that's one i  was gonna get  to um do you  resent when people  wonder why you're  famous because she  i think resents  that uh was there  any regret in making  that sex tape  obviously there  would have been  that would have  given her a  chance to go  yeah it was a  horrible low point  nothing out of  line and i can't  see uh where  was the worst  place a paparazzi  tried to get a  photo of you uh  the most invasive  place i asked her  about paparazzi  when she came  in and i had 
[03:34:00]  like a little uh  uh and then i  said it was a  more intense show  than i expected  and then i put  what is your  relationship with  paparazzi none of  those were fucking  dick questions  believe me if i  was gonna be a  dick i would have  been a dick  we all know you  guys know how to  do that but out  queue those  motherfuckers  watch your mouth  blasting us on the  show like it's our  fault and said  fuck those guys  it's our fault  that they didn't  get her we want  to be like  howard stern and  shot instead of  finding out what  happened first  yeah listen to the  tape of the interview  and you tell us  when we were being  outrageous how about  you fucking listen  to the tape and  then find out  every morning i see 
[03:34:30]  those guys and  they're pleasant and  you wouldn't give us  the benefit of the  doubt on a fucking  parasitic what  everybody knows is  horrible tell us  where in the  interview we went  so wild and  outrageous the  opening question  about how many  people do you have  with you was not  intended to be a  dick because i hate  when people come into  an interview with  me publicists are  funny it's just  irritating so i even  said like i hate that  when i'm being  interviewed i hate  being touched or  bothering me she  stood out there on  her phone while we  were just waiting for  her to come in  anyway she fucking  stunk hold on 
[03:35:00]  hold on burger in  texas burger of  course burger  yes she was an  absolute fucking  cunt yes she was  yeah we're trying to  be nice but that  that's the word uh  that certainly defines  the situation it was  it was i've  all right get to  the point get to  the point out q  situation what it's  going to be one of  the most uncomfortable  interviews but it was  not y'all's fault  get to the point with  the out q thing  and now he has to  go with all this 
[03:35:30]  shit they were  bitching about how  y'all treated her so  poorly we didn't  treat her poorly at  all no no  absolutely not at all  the whole town  department's on your  side why doesn't  someone go and tell  those fucking  dickheads that we  didn't probably  probably didn't know  that that's fair  enough they didn't  know but they  but they didn't  give us the benefit  of the doubt at  all they just  start attacking us  yeah they want to  be like howard  like that that's  what's annoying me  if they said hey  oh and a are  assholes all right  fine you didn't hear  the story but that's  shit that they  probably wanted to  say for a while  just we're all  being out 
[03:36:00]  crazy glue your  fucking ass cheeks  together and you  march in there and  tell them what is  going on  is this like a war  now it's like an  out here oh yeah  we're all gonna be  crazy yeah  they're blasting us  when she was a  radio war for the  ages abysmal i don't  think talent got to  them yet probably not  no excuse but i don't  think talent got to  tell them yeah obviously  and i don't mind i don't  care if they were  if they were annoyed  at us and they said  hey those dickheads  cost us whatever but 
[03:36:30]  the fact that they're  blasting us on a  personal level you know  that that shit that  they've they've wanted  to say for a while  that's like i want to  attack them for the  obvious but i'm not  going to they're just  they're fucking assholes  and they should know  what they're talking  about before they  start blasting people  yeah i do want to be  like howard on  vacation holy shit  you're absolutely right  yeah we want to be  part-timers too so  you're right there  three days a week  starting i do a lot  of interviews i'm  interviewed i'm  revealing an interview  so i don't respect  when somebody isn't  and if you're pushing  a reality show you  fucking dummy how  about you be 
[03:37:00]  revealing and i  didn't say that to  her and i wanted to  say that to her i  admitted i was annoyed  because i can't be a  total pussy and not  say i'm not i'm very  annoyed so why don't  we talk about the show  last time it's like  okay so we instantly  go into talk about the  show mode ask her a  question she's like yeah  it's crazy yeah last  time we interviewed her  she was just going kind  of smiling every time we  asked her something or  she'd be like yeah and i  said paris listen and i  said it on the air you've  gotta you gotta throw me a  bone here you're not on  tv you have to talk you  have to people are only  hearing you have to say  something and she didn't 
[03:37:30]  just get it really no no  no she was she was  horrible and again i feel  i don't even really want  to blast her now because  like i've said i i if i  didn't attack her while  she was here it's like  it's a pussy move to do  when she's gone but the  out you guys really annoyed  me with that i do have  one more question and i  like those guys too that's  what bothers me i genuinely  like those fucking guys  what's the question you're  gonna have to follow me on  twitter to find out i  follow you oh jesus that  is cheap it's a good  question  i swear to god if  roland got her back a 
[03:38:00]  thousand dollars just to  get her through that door  from one more clip she  ran right out well she  was out of here all right  so maybe she went from  here and left she didn't  even think about doing  anybody else no that  means she was looking for  an excuse to get the  fuck out of here because  she felt uncomfortable in  general not with us by  the way that's what they  thank you she was  supposed to be here till  noon  what a fuck a lot of  shows what a fucking  brat she left here like  opie and anthony  that's right quickly  quickly and unhappily  what a fucking brat 
[03:38:30]  look what it takes for  us to stay past 10  you know what's funny  i don't like it she  wrote on the picture  you're hot love paris  hill it's like what a  fucking fraud yeah am i  hot really that's the  catchphrase well no  hot oh she's terrible  she should she did fuck  the show you should have  said i don't want your  autograph on my picture  jimmy that's what i would  have said i kind of uh  i was asking to be a  dick and i believe me  if i i'm i'm a worm and  i will ask at any point  but that was one that i  know that was one that's 
[03:39:00]  like legitimately did not  expect when you said  like you know oh if i don't  want to be a bother i  already have been that  annoys me i tweeted the  picture of her signing your  picture oh good oh there  you go oh my those out  you guys oh that's an  apology she was atrocious  also when she left here she  went to the green room and  then her people said they  wanted to meet all the other  people who were going to  interview her first so i  guess larry was next in  line so they had to take  larry from his show to  come down she probably 
[03:39:30]  said though they berated  me they berated me we did  not her people wanted to  meet who was going to  interview her next she  said i'm not doing this  anymore and they said oh  paris is done and they  paris stunk what an  entitled spoiled absolute  fucking horrible brat  usually when people come in  they're not what you think  they're gonna be and it's  kind of a cool surprise  we've gotten along with  some very odd yeah i mean  fucking we get along with  bernard hopkins who we  probably all tense  probably should not we get  along with everyone who 
[03:40:00]  are some of the people  we've had in here that  we've brooke shields was a  great time that to me is a  fun celebrity she's got a  great sense of humor she's  fucking open she's not a  baby there have been a few  when we had uh bettany  yeah george wentz  travis tritt didn't we have  travis tritt yeah he came  in a while ago he's our  producer  but we had him and  thinking you know what are  we going to talk to him  about it but but it went  off great and then you have  someone like her you know 
[03:40:30]  what were you expecting yes  a bad interview no i was  not you were absolutely no  no absolutely i just knew it  couldn't go well i i and it's  not because i wanted to blow  it up or i knew you would try i  knew on this one we wanted to  try to make it work but i  just had a bad feeling going  into it absolutely yes yes  and then when i saw her out  there ordering her breakfast  and then when she sat down  mopey with her clothes the  second she sat down i i was  just like oh boy and then i'm  thinking to myself this is  going to be tough but all  right let's try to you know it  was almost like a challenge 
[03:41:00]  that's why i wanted to get  right into it but i knew it  would be tough she looked  scared to me she looked  scared and she's not as hot in  person i'm wrong about that  too i was attracted to her  she's got a bony tiny little  ass but she was uh she  looked scary and it's like  somebody who looks scared  i think i i try you try to  relate to them and not but  but there was not one ounce  of aggression in what i wanted  to ask her that's what's  enraging yeah yeah jesse  ventures a guy who you're  challenging his views you  know what i mean like he's  saying stuff and you know  it's going to be combative  because you already know 
[03:41:30]  when he walks in that you  don't believe what he  believes you're hot love  jesse you know what i mean  it's like that's different but  with this one there was to me  there was gonna be no  conflict i figured it'd be  kind of fluff thing it  wouldn't be a big deal  maybe we get one or two  real answers out of her  that's that's exactly what i  was expecting i thought you  would be fun with it right  right it's going to be fun  and fluff thing get some  info that baby voice shit  her level of being  unrevealing was mind-boggling  she's doing a fake reality  show wow yeah yeah it's not  even really a reality show  oxygen what else is on what 
[03:42:00]  other shows on that oxygen  channel that we might even be  interested in in having  somebody on that oxygen is  owned by nbc oh what does  that what does that mean no  just like you have the whole  family of people who run  nbc and that so so now is  that going to affect us with  anyone from nbc  you shouldn't because it was  not within your fault that's  the whole thing  yeah that doesn't matter you  think they're gonna fucking  they'll take all that word for  it believe me they ain't gonna 
[03:42:30]  listen oh they're gonna listen  to dumb radio show over their  fucking talent they'll hear the  talent they'll hear the tape  yeah they'll hear the tape  and the publicist they know she's  awful they know she's awful  well they have to know she's  awful yeah her poses was here  seen down laughing i cannot  believe fucking shows what an  entitled uh i i know i'm being  naive i say i can't believe  what a brat paris hilton was  but like what a really  uninteresting interview you  kind of thought she'd be like  at least somewhat tongue-in-cheek  about some of her outlandishness  you went to jail asking about 
[03:43:00]  that makes you more interesting  to people you want people to  watch your show it's a show  about you how did going to jail  change you oh i guess this  doesn't this means we're not  getting anyone from tory and  dean  god i'm not getting that i love  tory oh jeez that sucks  oh all about aubrey we're not  getting anyone from that show  how about house of glam i was so  hoping to get someone from house  of glam oxygen sucks a cock  whoa fuck the channel fuck them 
[03:43:30]  fuck her fuck everyone now you're  getting competitive can we go now  oh that's true let's go home now  i'm so irritated hair battle  spectacular hair battle  spectacular is that competing  with jersey licious no i sure hope  not okay good that's more hair  battling jersey licious is not  hair battling yeah jersey couture  that's a jersey licious  competitor oh boy i'm team  jersey licious i don't know i gotta 
[03:44:00]  check out this jersey couture before  i make any judgments what are you  doing though i'm calling my local  cable cable provider and having  oxygen removed from um from my  cable it went exactly how it's  supposed to was it yeah did it i  mean what was it well i will say  this i'm flabbergasted not blowing up  and cursing at her makes me feel  better now because now the rest of the  platform can't blame me exactly for  uh for her walking out on her  interview can't blame any of us we  were doing a fine interview with a 
[03:44:30]  bore for once fucking bore for once  the opie anthony show was the bigger  person that was fucking that was  two feet on the jaw no and a pliers in  the mouth to tooth pulling that that  that we were trying to go through no  what would have made this interview much  better night vision nice like the porno  night vision oh yeah turn the lights  down and she would have got them glowing  for us the glowing eyeballs that's right 
[03:45:00]  right and you know to her credit  nicole ritchie had a much better answer  for the lionel ritchie head i try to you  know i try to bring it all around and  lighten it up with the clay head didn't  work at all oh look at some nudes of uh  there we go all right danny knows where  to fucking go and find this got some  nudes get the nudes oh holy shit she  coming back for my question i think  she is what is that what's that  question gonna be there she is let's  get up tits you're curious about the 
[03:45:30]  question aren't you they are you're  curious about the question i work oh  that's the girls gone wild guy yep and  she's just showing her tits yeah that's  is that her working since she was 15  shut up she came in here i even said  doesn't work the hard day in her life  and i'm glad you called her out on that  one did i even ask you like did you have  what did you say really you were just  yeah really i worked uh i worked my  whole life stop i'm not even mad i  really am not didn't you have i asked  if you had a preconceived notion about us  like did you think that we're almost like  i understand why you'd be a little 
[03:46:00]  defensive but we're not fucking with you  here we're not trying to fuck with you  i i god almighty i i would bet a lot of  money she doesn't even know who we are  that's fair fine but someone said that  she didn't want to do the show her  lifestyle we're not in her fucking in  her wheelhouse there she is getting  her pussy eaten her fucking pussy yeah  getting eaten out there you go proud  moment god that's hot proud moment for  the hiltons right there that's right up  uh it goes that goes right up where 
[03:46:30]  when conrad fucking built his first hotel  hey uh it doesn't hey boys and girls  paris hilton is checking her twitter so  uh you know keep retweeting the picture  i just uh i just sent out because like i  said she was very boring i would just go  to google google uh paris hilton night  vision and uh and uh you know tweet her  some pictures she probably loved being  reminded she was not a good interviewer  and she and she feels what bothers me so  much is she didn't she's got she's no one  tells her that she's awful and she has no 
[03:47:00]  idea like she really thinks she was wrong  like i guarantee you right now she feels  legitimately like she's not spoiled and  awful and that she was wronged  fuck her really terrible and those out  queue guys annoyed me that annoys the  shit out of me too sam much the whole  talent department's outside just talking  about how she obviously just wanted a  way out of this and it was very obvious  because she was also supposed to meet you  know some of the bosses it's not where  the fall guys  everybody's not everybody's on your guys 
[03:47:30]  side excited i'm sure the out queue guys  are going to come around because  everybody out there is saying that for  once opie and anthony didn't do anything  guess what they bit their tongues i don't  come around they held back sorry  yeah now i don't come around nope i've  never held back like that i was i was i was  furious at that fucking one word answer  shit and again if she was promoting a  record yeah i would have more  understanding of why somebody doesn't  want to get into the personal stuff  because it's a record it's music but 
[03:48:00]  you're promoting a show which says this  is my life it's your life and then you  are fucking don't want to talk about  your life i can't as a performer i cannot  comprehend that lack of ability to  reveal yeah i cannot comprehend that  lack of desire to be open oh god god that  drives me fucking berserk oh it was she  was awful she was abysmal yeah she was  abysmal i thought we you know you're  talking about lindsey lohan it's to but 
[03:48:30]  she was associated with lindsey lohan  and so do you not know how to talk  about lindsey and go you know what  she's still having some tough times i i do  wish her the best but yeah i relate to  that i mean you go a little crazy out  there yeah you can't discuss something  like it was the lifestyle that i was  asking she couldn't even understand that  i was talking about the lifestyle not a  specific give me an instance where you  saw lindsey lohan fucking snorting lines  off a guy's boner no one said that it  was like i just it was the lifestyle it's  the hollywood lifestyle thing of the you 
[03:49:00]  know young and privileged and uh you  know give us a little fucking info on  that but no she's too stupid roland yes  oh nice tits oh those are nice tits  who's those good job dude dan hey uh  roland oh god did you go talk to the  alq guys fucking big night vision cock on  the screen i'll listen to him i'll talk to  him all right you're not gonna talk to  what do you got anything else dad i'll  talk to them on that phrase oh boy  they're saying this was worse than  george went which means better i mean 
[03:49:30]  yeah i i liked it i liked it for  different reasons make the shit out of  it because it's very uncomfortable we  got a little something for most  uncomfortable interviews volume two  you know that is uh true big hit on  memorial day i didn't feel  uncomfortable i felt angry no no that  was just anger afterwards it was  uncomfortable for everybody and then  it became awkward because you yeah i  i wasn't trying to get back into the  interview  oh there she goes yeah she's getting  slammed now nice this makes me feel  better here's some of the hard work 
[03:50:00]  she is sexy dude i'm fucking fucking  pounded she has the best sex tape i'll  say that it's hot really yes absolutely  i like it i can't disagree like she's  just atrocious  imagine trying to argue with her that  sense of entitlement like in a  relationship like oh come on get them  balls slapping on her lips  that's nice  fucking pounded fucking didn't we  also  didn't we compliment the way she  handled stalkers i like the way they  addressed it like oh you want a guy  audience that's what you do yeah but 
[03:50:30]  all that doesn't matter because right  from the get-go  she didn't have any of it there she is  working hard  look at that look at that well she's  giving a guy there you go blowjob  she's sexy man  she gives a great blowjob i gotta go  finder i got one more question i can't  pretend i'm gonna be checking your  twitter  can we go  yeah let's get the fuck out of here  i'm gonna get an apology from the  out cue guys  absolutely they owe us an apology  what  if they blasted us like that they 
[03:51:00]  absolutely you know now we're just  going by what a caller said imagine  if the caller's wrong  i don't mean imagine like it's that  far-fetched that a caller could be  wrong they're always wrong  they probably said opie and anthony are  great guys that asshole paris health  that's why it's best to not get  along with anybody in the end  because they always disappoint  in the end  because we were getting along with  those guys and then they they  turned that quickly get the fuck  out of here  well maybe they were just  i don't acknowledge them  and they'll apologize  son  i don't i don't i don't need or  want an apology i could give a  fuck 
[03:51:30]  not an apology would matter  no not really  it would be nice  yeah  not playing that shit anymore  i've had it  that's what those guys really  think of us and that's it  simple as that  we're peers  stay tuned for the shit hour  the ob and anthony show  the ob and anthony show  damn it </pre>
