<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts' characteristically bombastic introductions, followed by Anthony's usual bragging about his wealth and lifestyle.  They then launched into a mocking commentary on the overblown media reaction to a predicted New York snowstorm.  This transitioned into a gripe session about their subpar SiriusXM studio, contrasting it unfavorably with their previous, better-equipped workspace.  Their frustration extended to management, specifically citing Scott Greenstein, and the lack of a visual component for their show, blaming missed opportunities stemming from the Sirius/XM merger and a lack of support from their agent.  The possibility of leaving SiriusXM after their contract expired was also discussed.

A video clip showing Anthony being called a "pervert" was analyzed, drawing comparisons to Saul Alinsky's "Rules for Radicals." The conversation shifted to Game Six of the World Series, with vivid descriptions of the game and the subsequent celebration, including one host's description of the celebratory actions as a “rape” of the winning player. The show then delved into a discussion of Foley artists, punctuated by a humorous anecdote about their methods, before previewing upcoming segments with Jim Florentine and Jennifer Hutt, also including a brief, humorous exchange with Steven Tyler.

Opie recounted a humorous and sexually suggestive encounter with Jim Florentine.  This segued into "Adventures in Docking," a phone call with a listener detailing his experiences with the sexual practice, including a urologist visit to modify his foreskin. The hosts then discussed Charlie Daniels' birthday and music, focusing on "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," though struggling to recall many of his other songs.  A significant portion was dedicated to Bernie Madoff's prison life and the media's portrayal of his apparent contentment, including a Barbara Walters interview. The hosts expressed strong disdain for Madoff.  The Occupy Wall Street movement was briefly criticized for its shifting protest goals. This led to a humorous game attempting to define what’s worse than "cookie-cutter."

A substantial portion dissected a "John and Jeff" segment, criticizing its poor execution, lack of listener engagement, and repetitive, offensive discussion of wealth and marriage, including an exceptionally long, repetitive list of possessions. A call to Radio Shack for technical assistance devolved into absurdity.  The hosts mentioned upcoming "You Might Be a Child of the 80s" and "John and Jeff" segments, the discovery of old Opie and Anthony show clips on Facebook (including a lacrosse team interview), and a story about a woman mauled by a chimpanzee.

A poorly executed trivia game, "Occupations That Drink the Most," dominated a segment, featuring repeated failures by John and Jeff to properly explain the rules.  Callers, including Mark, Richard, and Trace, attempted to guess occupations (attorneys were repeatedly mentioned).  Jeff eventually revealed part of his top ten list: 10. Sanitation engineers; 9. Advertising executives; 8. Carnival workers; 7. Musicians; 6. Construction workers; 5. Radio talk show hosts; 4. Restaurant managers; 3. Lawyers; 2. Sailors;  The number one occupation remained unrevealed.

Jennifer Hutt joined the show, discussing her career, weight fluctuations, relationship with Alexis Stewart, and a lavish Sweet Sixteen party, with frequent, sexually suggestive comments about her appearance and body.  Photos and video clips were referenced, along with discussions about Botox.  The conversation repeatedly circled back to her strained relationship with Alexis Stewart, marked by frequent use of the word "cunt" to describe her.  Joe Curry briefly promoted his upcoming gig.  The unrevealed top occupation in the trivia game continued to be a recurring point of frustration and comedic tangents.

A further segment with Jennifer Hutt featured Sam Roberts.  The interview was highly sexually charged, with crude questions and comments about Hutt’s physical attributes, using highly offensive language. Graphic sexual topics and discussions of various sexual acts and body parts were prevalent.  Topics also included an upcoming Jim Norton appearance, Hutt's work on Ron and Fez, Jocktober, and reactions to images from Hutt's Facebook page.  Lily Hassani appeared, promoting a movie role. Joe Curry again promoted his band McClinton and their upcoming gig. The show concluded with a song from McClinton.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little...  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, god damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm doing my voice warm-ups for everybody live. 
[00:04:30]  Feel it?  Feel it in the air?  Feel what?  Friday.  Oh, shit.  Shit, I thought you were going to say fucking snow.  Chlamydia?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, god damn with the snow forecast.  God, this...  Why do I have to hop into my car the second...  It's still pitch black.  I'm in my driveway.  I put on 1010 Winds, the local news around here in New York.  Yeah.  And I hear snow coming.  Ho, ho. 
[00:05:00]  Stay tuned for AccuWeather, this, that, that.  And then I instantly look at my radio like, get the fuck out.  I know where this is going to go.  And then they go, yep, going to have snow.  Going to be snow.  First snow in October in quite some time.  And apparently they teased it for a while.  And then talk about how our area, and the city, and the coastal areas, and everything  where industry is, and where the millions upon millions of people work and reside, is 
[00:05:30]  going to get what amounts to some slush, maybe, tomorrow.  It's going to start out as rain.  Right.  And it's going to get a little slushy mix.  And then it might turn over to snow for, like, a second, and then back to rain, or just  stop, or, and there might be some slush on the ground.  And then they go, and north and west of the area, look out, because you could get up to  three inches.  And then north and west of that, they're looking at six inches. 
[00:06:00]  It's like, yeah, that's the mountains.  It's the mountains.  North and west, they're now doing the forecast for Cleveland.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  What the fuck?  Well, let's look at Canada.  Yeah.  It's a way to get people to, you know, tune back in, to start the chatter around the water  cooler at work.  Hey, Joe.  Bloop.  Bloop.  Did you hear?  I heard the news this morning.  It's going to...  Bloop. 
[00:06:30]  Bloop.  It's going to snow.  Snow?  Did I hear snow?  Here comes Bob walking over.  Bloop.  Bloop.  I love your bit, but HR took water coolers away.  Years ago.  Was it the girls bending over and getting smacked on the ass?  It was that.  It was some kind of a hazard.  Kill joys.  Yeah.  They realized that there was a very slight possibility they could tip over and maybe  break a toe.  I like old school, though.  Bloop.  Bloop.  I can't even do that noise.  Bloop.  It's all old school. 
[00:07:00]  Water cooler.  Well, like, you know, Larry Tate.  We should do weather radio.  Yeah.  Oh, look out.  Because these fucking dummies...  And when I say that, I don't really think we talk to as many dummies as other places.  But there's fucking dummies that can't get enough of weather.  They love it.  They love panicking for it.  They can't wait for their local forecast.  They love running to fucking Home Depot and getting batteries for slush.  You know what?  You know when I learned about the day's weather?  The weather is when I walk out of my building, I go, fuck! 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Why didn't I look at the weather?  And also, I don't have a jacket.  It's 40 degrees.  Yeah.  And it's cold.  That's how much I give a fuck about the weather.  Because in general, in my head, I'm like, it just swooshes around.  It's like, it's October.  That means maybe a light jacket.  Maybe.  You know not to put shorts on when you leave.  Of course.  That's what I mean.  Unless you're rolling.  So you dress appropriately, but every once in a while, you get fucking knocked in the teeth.  But in general, I sort of know what the weather's going to be every day.  And I don't own any rain gear. 
[00:08:00]  Never have, never will.  Who, your Santa Claus?  What are you talking about?  Rain gear.  Oh, gear.  See, I thought.  Sorry.  Hold on, hold on.  But they're hoping that it's...  Throwing out the first bomb of the show.  They're hoping that it accumulates an inch, because that has never happened.  I learned that.  Oh, no way.  It did.  Back in 1921.  Nope.  They're saying it never happened.  Central October.  I heard, first of all, I heard there hasn't been any snow on the ground on Halloween, 
[00:08:30]  maybe, since 1921.  And then, any measurable snow in the New York City area in the month of October since the  50s.  Nope.  Now, that's what I heard.  Nope.  I heard differently.  Well, what weather are you listening to?  10-10 winds.  That's what I was listening to.  Oh.  Maybe I was...  How did that happen?  Proving seed that I don't give a fuck about weather.  I was listening with half an ear.  By the way, we are talking about weather.  Weather.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now, like I said a few days ago, everyone's got what I like to call their smartphones. 
[00:09:00]  Smartphones.  And when you pop it on, the weather's right there in your face.  Yeah.  You got a stock ticker, the little weather thing.  And you know the five-day forecast before anyone has to tell you.  The news obsolete.  You got your pool open.  You're trying to keep it open for your big party.  Here's what happened.  Tomorrow's the big party.  I finally had to power down the heaters. 
[00:09:30]  I thought you were going to try to keep it open for your Halloween party.  What's wrong with you?  Here's the problem.  You could have fucking fired up the heaters for one more weekend.  I got so close, but when I heard what the actual forecast was for tomorrow, which is  this cold.  It's going to be a cold rain.  It's not going to be snow, but it's going to be very cold and very rainy, and it's not  really conducive to drunks being in there.  Now, there's a caveat here.  If it's not too bad. 
[00:10:00]  What the fuck is a caveat, first of all?  Another word I got to learn?  God damn it.  It's fish eggs.  Congratulations, Hans.  I knew you were hot.  I looked at you.  I knew you were going.  That means you guys got to blow each other.  You and Chip landed on the same joke.  Hold me a cup of cum.  Yeah, like Rudolph thought might.  Exactly.  Oh, Chip.  If I feel so inclined, and it's not all that bad, I can fire up the propane heater.  Now, all I shut down is the electric heater. 
[00:10:30]  I'm actually following the logic.  Because if it was an okay day with no perspiration in the air, then you can keep the pool open.  Yeah.  But knowing that it's at least going to be cold rain, possibly some weird slushy shit,  there's no reason to keep the pool open.  So I'm not sure.  So if people do want to go in, though.  You wanted that pool open for your party.  I wanted a Halloween pool party, and it's very tough to do. 
[00:11:00]  You just missed it.  I just missed.  But I can fire the propane up, get the jacuzzi rocking, so there can be some jacuzzi action.  Nice.  Which will be nice and steamy.  But, yeah, the pool itself, at your own risk.  If you want to jump off the little waterfall into the pool area, I'm not coming in after you.  You're going to have at least one person doing that.  Oh, of course.  What will be the water temperature tomorrow?  The water temperature, I checked it.  It's now dipped from the 70s, where I've been holding it for a while. 
[00:11:30]  It's in the 60s right now?  It's in the upper 60s.  So people will absolutely jump in that.  Yeah, because if it's 40 degrees out, 60 will feel kind of good.  Right.  But then when you get out, there could be some hypothermia at the house.  I'm just thinking.  There could be some hypothermia, which, yeah, you give them a little brandy.  I'll get one of the, maybe Travis could bring his little dog over,  and we'll put a little barrel under his neck, a little barrel of brandy,  and he could go around like the St. Bernard, pulling people out of the pool 
[00:12:00]  and giving him some brandy.  Hey, we're in a contract, right?  We are?  Yes, we are.  What if I retired?  You could do that.  If I retire, they can't hold me to a contract, right?  I don't know about that.  Maybe I'll do it.  No, they could, but I think, I don't know what the terms are.  I'm thinking of retiring.  Can you just sit down and do nothing?  I know they can hold you like you can't work, probably.  But what if I'm working at something sort of different? 
[00:12:30]  They start retiring.  What?  No, I'm retiring.  I've been over this.  They don't like it.  What?  No, it's different.  It's different.  I saw exactly what we're supposed to be doing yesterday,  and we tried to do it three years ago,  and we've been shut down by this company,  and now coming into the studio with, by the way,  the still shitty yellow lights.  I'm out of my mind today, and I will not waste your time with this.  It's actual color on the catalog. 
[00:13:00]  Just a couple of minutes.  Shitty yellow.  But Glenn Beck is doing this GBTV,  and they invited me to do an interview.  And I walked into this place and went,  this is exactly what we should be doing,  and wanted to do and started doing three years ago.  Yep.  But instead, because this company and our stupid fucking agent  doesn't have a vision,  we just sit here and continue to do lousy radio,  meaning...  Lousy radio.  We'll continue to give you a substandard product. 
[00:13:30]  Meaning the presentation.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Pick up the New York Times.  The Clear Channel just fired another, I think, 600 DJs.  Radio is dying in front of our fucking eyes.  We knew this three years ago.  We had cameras in our beautiful studio that they were supposed to replicate here.  By the way, I ran into the engineer at GBTV that...  Where does he park his choo-choo?  Whoa.  That built our old studio that we all loved, obviously.  We were all in agreement with the bleachers and that massive room. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And you were just bathed in the proper lighting.  Everything was set up nice.  I hear you.  When we had eight people that came in to do the show,  they all had a spot on the big console, right?  Beautiful.  He goes...  He got fired.  But he...  You know, he's doing well.  Of course he did.  Because he built GBTV for Glenn Beck.  He goes,  I need to know.  He goes,  what kind of studio did those guys give you at Sirius?  I'm like,  you don't want to know.  Studio?  I go...  They just threw us in a...  Room closet with mics.  Yeah, a shitty little, tiny little studio like everybody else. 
[00:14:30]  They went,  oh my God,  they fucking lied to you.  They were told...  They told this guy and his people,  because he was Mars' boss.  What's that guy's name, Mars?  Philip Altenberg?  With the mustache.  Philip Altenberg.  Damn, he's a good boss.  Philip was told by the people in charge at the time  that we were supposed to have a studio  that was pretty much comparable to what we were leaving.  And then it turns out, he tells me,  that studio that we had to leave,  that these people insisted we had to leave, 
[00:15:00]  sat there until last June?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  We could have been in that awesome studio.  They were paying for it anyway.  They're paying for it,  you broadcast from it.  Because the one thing,  I'm thinking,  well,  they don't want to pay for that  when they can move us over here,  but they had to pay for that anyway.  So that beautiful fucking studio  that we all loved and miss,  sat there for a year and a half after we left.  Yeah.  A year and a half.  Wow.  Maybe two years, actually.  Remember E-Rock was going back to the 57th Street studio 
[00:15:30]  and taking pictures?  Yeah.  He has a bunch of pictures.  No, I know.  We used to,  well, now I think they finally tore it apart,  but they're finally out of there.  Salvaged it.  But the point is,  we didn't have to rush out of that beautiful space  to be thrown into this tiny little studio.  And we had the cameras,  just like Glenn Beck's doing,  beautiful cameras,  beautiful lighting.  We were on our way,  and they shut us the fuck down,  and now we just sit here in horrible lights  in front of extremely cheap microphones 
[00:16:00]  as radio's dying.  Yeah.  Well, you know,  if somebody was smart and on the scene  and saw this happening over a year ago,  probably would have built something in his basement.  Yeah, you're right.  A nice visual studio  with three high-definition camera angles.  Yeah, you're ready to go.  With lights and mics that are,  blow these away.  Yeah, yeah.  It would be great.  Oh, that's right.  I did that.  I don't think we make it  to the end of this contract.  Yeah, believe me.  Because we're going to be infuriated  to the point  we're going to have to fucking walk.  I already got...  I'm not even joking 
[00:16:30]  because I already got T-shirts out there  that people are mad  they're not getting fast enough.  Right.  But I pack them myself,  so hey,  you might get an errant pube in there.  Hey,  you might get an Anthony pube in there.  What is their logic,  seriously,  for this show?  To just let us fucking rot here?  Sit here and tell the next  contract  and then Bob comes in  and then he goes,  please,  please keep them here  and then they throw a number at him  and he goes,  hey guys,  this is all you got in the world.  Right.  And then we go,  oh fuck.  Right.  Because that's all we had in the world. 
[00:17:00]  But now there's options.  Yeah,  that ain't happening.  There's no fucking way  that's happening.  Yeah.  But I had a great time at GBTV.  I don't even know how you see this thing.  Whatever.  It's fine.  I don't need to promote it.  People will see it.  And then you come back here today  and you're like,  seriously?  We were visionaries.  We were starting all this shit.  Oh man.  We had the visual element.  We had five or six cameras.  We had a beautiful studio.  We had beautiful lighting.  And all it would have taken 
[00:17:30]  was someone that understood this  and Eric Logan understood it  and we were moving forward  and then of course  he fucking bolted for Oprah.  And we have no one  that replaced Eric Logan  on that level  so now we just sit here and rot.  We sit here and rot.  We still do good radio,  yes,  but radio is dying.  And it's going to take us with it.  Radio,  it's dying.  Come on.  I don't want these fucking...  That's great.  I don't want these fucking lights  and I don't want this fucking studio.  I don't know how many times  we have to tell these people. 
[00:18:00]  Mars, get the lights out of here.  Yes, sir.  Oh.  Right away.  Damn.  That's a dark studio.  But, you know.  I know.  I know.  Do you want the big lights on?  No.  I don't even want to...  I wore a long sleeve.  I don't even want to joke about it, man.  It's unbelievable.  We were moving forward.  We were moving forward  with all this shit.  Remember that.  Couldn't they have charged  a little extra money  to have the visual...  Wasn't there a way  to negotiate that  where you had the visual  and the audio? 
[00:18:30]  Our listeners are so hard  fucking core,  at least a percentage of them.  If we had a visual element,  they would pay five bucks a month  to see the show.  To watch the show every day.  They would pay five bucks  on top of their subscription.  I know they would.  For those that wanted it  and those that didn't,  would just listen.  It would be fine either way.  It would be a nice revenue stream  and we would feel like  we're not being stuck  in the past.  I would.  I would.  I would.  Easily would.  Of course!  I would.  Of course!  I tried to pay something. 
[00:19:00]  People actually tried  to pay something.  Right.  That's hilarious.  But we got this guy,  Scott Greenstein.  He fucking sucks.  Oh boy.  He sucks.  Now you're yelling at the boss.  I don't give a fuck.  Now you're yelling at the boss.  He knows I don't like him.  You're going to have to  meet with him though.  No, I'm not meeting with anybody.  I'd rather walk at this point.  He sucks.  He doesn't understand  the potential of this radio show  or he doesn't give a fuck.  One of the two.  It's simple as that.  Did he write you back  about the display?  Yeah.  What did he say? 
[00:19:30]  He said,  I think he would just  look into it.  He answered me.  Another look into it situation.  You're the guy.  You're the guy.  So why are you looking into it?  You should know ahead of time  if Opie and Anthony  are going to be part  of the new displays.  You saw the other side there.  yesterday and now it's  like you saw the Alice in Wonderland  or the  you've opened the doors  and you've seen  a whole new world.  Yeah.  See?  But it's frustrating  knowing that  this is exactly 
[00:20:00]  where we were heading  and then the brakes  were pulled.  The big fucking brakes  stopped everything.  Stopped all the progress.  It's because the wonderful  management at XM  wasn't able to  hold their lead  over Sirius.  Yep.  Right.  And we were absorbed.  We were fucking absorbed  like the Borg.  It was a takeover.  To the collective.  And their business model  was very different  than XM.  They're all about  paying attention  to one guy  and hoping that 
[00:20:30]  that's going to  keep the company running  years from now.  Yes.  Simulated.  Right.  XM was all about  trying to get  a whole bunch  of things  they were proud of.  Absorbed during  a takeover  is almost a nice  way of saying  it's like  we were the  victims of a rape  and we're something  that was thrown  into the bag  on the way out.  Right.  The door.  There was a rape  that took place  and Sirius definitely won.  Absolutely.  Had a much bigger dick.  Raped XM  and we just got  thrown into a bag.  Like come on  let's go let's go.  Right. 
[00:21:00]  And then they fired  all the XM guys  and kept their own guys.  That's just stupid.  I've been to GVT.  Some of the XM guys  were way better  at their jobs  than the Sirius counterpart.  But they had blinders on.  Yeah.  You've been there right?  Yeah.  It's a fucking beautiful.  It was great.  And it's not even that  it's not even that expensive.  Look at that.  It was just  We're looking at some clips  right now.  Wow.  I wasn't even in that studio.  That was the big one. 
[00:21:30]  I was only in  SE has a little studio.  That's a fucking  different studio  than I was in.  Yeah.  That's the main  big huge studio.  That's Glenn's studio?  Yeah.  I sat next to  that fucking green plant.  And that's Scott Walker.  He's cool.  He's a big fan of the show.  Don't call him a green plant.  He's a nice gentleman.  Wow.  That's an amazing  that's like a TV studio.  Oh yeah.  I didn't see that one.  Totally.  I don't want to wait  to the end of the contract.  I really want to know  what the fucking  vision is  for this radio show  with this company.  Wow.  I want to know  sooner than later 
[00:22:00]  because this is not working  anymore for me.  Here's how you find out.  You read your contract  because that is exactly  what they will give you  and that is exactly  what you're going to get.  It's too bad.  Fine.  11 months to go.  11 months to go.  Fine.  Because there really isn't  any...  I don't see any  good faith  bargaining  in between  contracts.  It just doesn't happen.  It's not even  bargaining.  It's like,  okay,  these guys are under contract.  We want to keep them happy  and hopefully keep them here.  So what can we do 
[00:22:30]  right now?  They're obviously not happy.  They have to be hearing this  one way or another.  Yeah.  You know?  I see that there is  still potential here.  Yeah.  But for some reason  nothing gets done.  No,  it's just status quo  and hope the subs go up  and that's pretty much it.  We don't like our studio.  This was supposed  to be temporary.  Yeah.  You know,  the other day  when we were all  beating the shit out  of each other  when Bob Kelly said,  wow,  your studio is getting  smaller and smaller.  It's kind of sad. 
[00:23:00]  Who,  Bob Kelly?  Yeah,  he wants to get  smaller and smaller.  Oh,  that's why they do  the close-up,  I see.  Yeah,  they do extreme close-ups.  Extreme close-up!  I guess there's  a preview clip  online of my friends.  Is that Stump Rines?  That's right.  Yeah,  he works for them.  Let me hear it.  Stunty.  Play it.  Go back a little bit.  Stunty.  Stunty.  And then,  and then all of a sudden  two people,  pervert,  and then pervert,  pervert,  and then they had  20 to 30 people  out of nowhere  pointing at me  and calling me a pervert.  And man,  if you want someone  to leave a crowd fast, 
[00:23:30]  that's the way to do it.  That's the way to do it  because no one wants  to be known as a pervert.  All of a sudden  in a big crowd.  Now,  Mike,  when you heard this,  I'm sure you're looking  at this and you're just thinking,  this is a bizarre scene.  I was confused by it.  I'd never experienced  anything like that before.  But you had  an interesting reaction  because when you saw  this video  and you heard  what happened,  this struck a chord  in you  because you were like,  this sounds like  something familiar.  Well,  we've been studying  the protest  and seeing what's  going on down there.  Right.  And this seemed  like a tactic  right out of  Saul Alinsky's  rules for radicals.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  And that is  the freeze technique.  And of course,  you were fully familiar  with Saul Alinsky's  rules for radicals.  You probably had  a pie copy  in your back pocket.  I might have missed  that day in high school.  So how?  It's social studies.  Of course it was that.  Of course it was that.  What else could it be?  I had a good time, man.  It would be funny  if they had just  cut your answer  when you said  they were yelling  pervert, pervert.  And that's when  they stopped it.  And they just stopped it  and they said  something about you  in a grammar school  and they totally  twisted it.  I'm sure people 
[00:24:30]  who grab that clip  would do just that.  That's great.  I think the whole  thing plays today.  It was so fucking  nice and freeing, man.  Dude, it's fucking  it's a pisser.  You know?  Yeah.  Just hanging around  like doing what we do  with a visual element  that you can be proud of.  I just want to be proud  of what I do.  All right, slow down.  Yeah.  I'm serious, though.  I take just being content.  I like that, too.  I know we're always  negative and beat  the shit out of each other  but in the end  that's what I want.  I'm not proud  of this shit anymore.  This is disgusting. 
[00:25:00]  I had better microphones.  We had better microphones  at AAF and a better  studio at AAF.  We left there  fucking, I don't even know  what, 13 years ago  at this point?  It's disgusting.  Somebody complained  about the app  because they said  that they had heard  about our announcement  when the guys  were in about Patrice  and they listened  to hear that  and they said  right before you get to it  the app craps out.  Yeah, but we gave up  talking about the app  and trying to figure out  the app.  I don't promote our app 
[00:25:30]  because I know people  are extremely disappointed  with the service  and all I hear is like  that's what I hear  or I'll look into it.  We'll look into it.  We'll kick it upstairs.  I think a lot of people  are hammering  our fucking app.  You think that's  what it is?  Traffic?  Yeah, I think the app's  being hammered  but they're not smart enough  to figure that part out.  It's just too bad, man.  Because we were on our way. 
[00:26:00]  Well, on our way  to a new and exciting future.  I think, anyway.  There's a lot of doors.  A lot of doors out there.  A lot of potential.  A lot of things to do.  A lot of options.  Yeah.  And believe me,  I'm diving in  head fucking first.  right into an empty pool.  Nah.  I don't know.  That's it.  I don't know.  I could say a lot more  but until I get 
[00:26:30]  a few more things  figured out  I gotta shut up for now.  It's frustrating  to not have a visual element  though.  It's kind of necessary.  It's so necessary now.  You know,  just the audio thing  doesn't work.  It's great for some  podcasts and things like that  on a smaller scale  and even in some cases  on a larger scale  but for the most part  and especially  a very dynamic show  you need  a visual element  to it.  You need to show  people clips.  You need to  be on camera. 
[00:27:00]  People want to see  you interacting  with people.  They want to see  facial expressions.  They want to  you know,  there's so much  out there  and it's so much  easier to do now  than years ago.  There's a phone  all they want to see  they just want  to look at shit.  Oh look,  what do I  hold it up to your  ear like a transistor  radio listening  to Mickey Mantle?  What the fuck  year is this?  Read the New York Times  article on Clear Channel.  I'm not sure  if I got a preview article  or if it came out already  or if it's in today's paper  I'm not really sure  but they just laid off  a mother load 
[00:27:30]  of DJs  because they  understand  that the business  is dead.  Remember they tried  to go local?  They said fuck local  because we have to  pay all those people  and we have to pay  their health insurance.  They said fuck this  and they're now  getting rid of  their morning shows  because what  regular radio  was down to  was they still  kept the local  morning show  and got rid  of everybody else.  Everybody else.  Now they're saying  fuck that  we don't even need  the local morning show  anymore.  They let a shitload  of people,  look,  Clear Channel  cuts DJs 
[00:28:00]  across the country.  Really?  And they did how many?  It was like  they're being very shady  about the number  but people are saying  hundreds of DJs  were let go  on this round.  I wonder where  600,  I don't know,  600 regional radio.  The layoffs  were not made  to cut costs  but were part  of a revamping  of its 600  regional radio stations.  And Scott Shannon  continues to have  a job by the way.  Thank God.  Right?  Our old boss  got fired who?  One of your old bosses, 
[00:28:30]  Bob Buckman.  I don't know Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Who's Bob?  It's with  a different company  but it happened  at the same time.  He was program director  at KLOS  out in LA.  I knew that.  He's a great guy.  And he just  got let go.  Wow.  Hey,  the cue of the day  is where the fuck  am I going to work?  The writing's on the wall,  man.  Bob used to do  a staple  on Long Island.  You have to have  the combination.  Excuse me.  You have to have  a combination.  Especially if you guys 
[00:29:00]  want it.  Let all these other  schmucks around here  not give a fuck.  That's why I don't  even know half  these people's names.  Because they don't  give a fuck.  That's Sam.  That guy is Mars.  I don't even know why.  Yeah.  He's like floating  or something.  Yeah,  like in space.  That's what I meant.  Sorry.  Steal my shit.  Bitten.  So.  By the way.  By the way.  Enough of that.  By the way.  Probably went longer  than I should have. 
[00:29:30]  It's fresh in my mind  after my experience  yesterday going,  yes.  Maybe Bob will get on it though.  This is exactly  what we want.  You think Bob will get on it?  Oh yeah,  he'll get on it all right.  I've lost all faith  in my agent.  To be honest with you.  Sorry Bob,  you have to hear this.  Oh that's right,  you probably won't hear this  until fucking next week  sometime.  I think we're ready  for a vote of no confidence.  You think the guy  would at least call  about Patrice.  Patrice was basically,  it was me,  Anthony,  Jimmy, 
[00:30:00]  and then probably  Patrice would be  the next guy  in the line.  Absolutely.  And he has a stroke,  you think Bob  would probably check in.  You're kidding.  Of course he didn't check in.  He probably doesn't  even know it happened.  That's the guy  I want representing.  He seems preoccupied.  That's all I'll say.  I noticed that too  the last few times  I've said he seems preoccupied.  Because he's preoccupied,  now I've got to pay two guys  because that's how  it works in this stupid business.  Yeah.  That's how I've,  he struck me  the last few times  I've communicated with him.  Yeah.  Was not disinterested  but really preoccupied. 
[00:30:30]  Really like,  like distracted  or somewhere else.  How was that  baseball game yesterday?  Oh my God.  Amazing.  What game?  This fucking  dumbass World Series  that I had no  interest in even watching.  You're all in?  Is becoming like  so fucking exciting.  It's great, man.  St. Louis was,  one strike away  from elimination.  Texas ready to win  the World Series.  But I told you yesterday 
[00:31:00]  every World Series  has to go to Game 7.  So why were you tricked?  I know.  You knew it was going to happen.  It just happened.  I told you yesterday.  What game was this?  Six?  Game six.  Texas was one out  away from winning it.  Texas only had  one strike.  One strike away  from winning.  And yeah,  what was it in the ninth?  And then they tied it up  in the ninth.  Hold on.  They have a 3-2 game lead?  Yes.  And they're playing where?  Texas or St. Louis?  St. Louis.  Okay.  Yeah.  And they play in St. Louis  now again  because they tied it up 
[00:31:30]  in the ninth  with one,  like I said,  one strike away  from elimination.  What happened?  What was the score?  Was it on?  Well,  there was one guy  that was on  and then one guy,  I don't think,  fucking what am I?  A play-by-play guy?  Yeah, they tied it up.  But I mean,  was it like a one-run home run  or was it basically loaded?  In the 11th,  it was a walk-off.  They went into extra innings.  11th inning,  walk-off,  fucking home run  to win it  for Game 7. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, but...  Which,  amazing.  I saw the highlights  and all.  Yeah.  You know,  good for the Cardinals,  but some homoerotic shit  happened after that home run.  I was very uncomfortable with.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What's his name?  The walk-off home run,  they raped him pretty much.  Were they trying to rape him?  They were raping him  on the field.  I'm very confused  why they needed to  try to tear his clothes off.  Why are you tearing  his clothes off?  They were ripping  his shirt off.  Why?  I don't know. 
[00:32:30]  They probably heard  rumors of the V  and just needed to see it  at that moment.  They were so happy.  Yeah,  they were very happy with it.  Yeah.  But really cool.  Really, yeah.  I want to see that  ninth inning  because I want to know,  if they were one strike away,  I'm wondering,  was it a base hit that did it  or was it a...  If you wanted to see  the ninth inning,  you should have watched  the ninth inning.  Nah, just go to the website.  In the ninth inning,  they had two outs,  last strike,  and David...  What was the score?  7-5.  Oh, two runs down.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  And they tripled in  the two tying runs.  Oh, that's cool.  Fuck, that's exciting.  Yeah, yeah,  because they were done.  And then top of the tenth,  Josh Hamilton  for Texas  hits a two-run home run,  so Texas is up  two runs again.  Yeah.  Bottom of the tenth,  Cardinals down  to their last out again.  Tie the game.  Amazing.  How fucking...  By the way,  if you're a Texas fan,  how badly do you want  to strangle  your relief pitchers?  Oh, fuck, right? 
[00:33:30]  Especially because  they've never won  a World Series.  Like, these fans...  At St. Louis?  Yes, St. Louis won  a couple years ago.  They're rabid  to win this,  and they had the chance,  I mean,  with one strike away.  There was a story...  Was there volume on this  or not?  Launch that.  There was a story yesterday  from a 75-year-old  Rangers fan  whose dying wish  was to see the Rangers  win the World Series  died two days ago.  Whoops!  Oh, wow.  Sucks to be here.  Sorry about that.  We always get what we want,  do we?  Sorry.  Oh, Scheller.  You can't always get... 
[00:34:00]  Whoa.  Oh, how fucking...  And then they raped him.  Yeah, watch the rape list.  And it's still just...  Ripping his shirt off.  He probably wanted  to keep his shirt  as a nice keepsake.  Now it's a side  I've been here now.  Swing and a high drive  to center feet.  Get up, baby.  Get up, baby.  Get up.  Oh, yeah!  Now David Lee  just sent us  in the game.  That's a horrible home run.  And he's the same guy  that hit the triple  in the bottom of the ninth. 
[00:34:30]  Hero.  That guy does stay...  Joe Buck had a good call.  Did he?  Yeah, Joe Buck  had a good call.  Fantastic.  Well, you know what he did?  He did his father's call  from 20 years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  He's on high fly ball  to center field.  Hamilton going back.  He's on the track.  He's at the wall.  It is gone.  And the Cardinals  have won it.  Terrible.  Who's this guy?  Who's that?  A walk-off run  by David Williams.  And a walk-off run. 
[00:35:00]  I'm assuming  that was the Rangers.  All right.  That could be.  Good point.  All right.  That's fair enough.  Oh, look at Nolan Ryan.  Oh, fatso.  And he's a pitcher, too.  That's so hard to watch  as a pitcher.  Nolan looks like  fucking Charlie Brown.  He looks exactly  like Charlie Brown.  He's got the big round head,  no hair on his head,  and he just looks miserable.  That's hilarious.  That's a heartbreaker, man.  Yeah.  Twice when you blow  two-run leads,  your pitcher should be  fucking flogged.  With a strike.  All you need is to  throw a strike. 
[00:35:30]  Anything.  Just fucking get him out.  It should be all.  And they lost  the World Series last year.  My God, it should be  a slobber knocker tonight  in St. Louis.  By the way,  it's the first Game 7  since 2002.  My thing's just a dumb bit.  What?  They lost last night, too?  No, they lost last year.  I mean, last year?  Same way?  No.  It's the exact same way.  Oh, it's terrible.  Fuck them.  Why don't I go?  Who beat them last year?  San Francisco.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  You heard Buck's  home-run call, right?  No.  Joe Buck's call was good. 
[00:36:00]  I didn't see the game.  Yeah, it was.  He did the exact call  his father did 20 years ago.  See you tomorrow night  or something like that.  In one of the same situations.  Is that his dad's famous?  I don't remember his father.  Oh, wow.  His father was amazing.  I think you have the call.  No.  Okay, good.  Oh!  No, I don't.  Oh, sorry.  I could have sworn I gave it to you.  All right, I got it.  Oh, you do?  All right.  I was ready to yell at Sam  and praise Danny.  Let me take away that Danny praise.  You're in the back office, Danny.  Gas yourself with carbon monoxide.  Hope has the call.  All right, I got it. 
[00:36:30]  By the way,  using fucking DVD players  from 15 years ago.  Not to keep having a point.  This.  We made our demented world  on these things.  Yeah, remember that?  Just chick-click-click-chink-chink-chink.  The Denon.  The old Denon.  They can't even update that for us.  It's a workhorse.  It's still good.  Yeah, is it?  Oh, yeah.  Two strikes on Freeze.  Two strikes on Burton. 
[00:37:00]  Freeze hits it in the air to center.  We will see you tomorrow night.  What would happen if they would have...  What if the guy would have quoted...  We will see you shortly.  In a moment.  After this,  it's a commercial for douche.  Just a big gust of wind blows it back in.  Oops.  Oops. 
[00:37:30]  You got to put some spunk in a home run call.  Yep.  I was good at that.  I used to divide local games.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I did.  Sure I would.  Hit the play.  Hit the ball.  Hit the thing.  I'll do a quick call.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What team?  How do we have to take it?  What do we got to do a fucking...  Schenectady.  A Foley thing here?  No, that's not...  Wait.  You got to find a...  I'm experimenting.  Oh, okay.  That's fair enough.  I'm so happy that happened. 
[00:38:00]  You broke your megaphone.  Stupid broke his megaphone.  Now all the batteries just broke.  I only wish that you were looking down the barrel of a shotgun when you did that.  I was trying to get a crack sound.  Why did it break so easily?  No, it's just a little door open that the batteries...  You got to get some wood.  That's why we don't do Foley work around here.  Some wood.  No Foley work.  We do the...  Yeah, the horse.  See?  That's a horse.  Oh, and he's riding into town.  How do you...  I can't do that.  It's the Lone Ranger. 
[00:38:30]  My horse has fucking palsy.  And specialty is horses and mine is fire.  Oh, that's a good one.  The studio.  The studio.  Oh, no.  Oh, I'm so glad this is happening.  I hope all the exits are locked.  Better get on your horse.  Oh.  The horse is on fire.  What?  The horse is running.  But wait, it's windy, too.  Oh, I hope the wind blows out the fire on the horse.  Oh, it just blew out the fire. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, no.  People are jumping out the windows.  Oh, they almost went up first.  It's an updraft.  Oh, come back.  Oh, they're jumping out the windows.  This is crazy.  Bellhop.  Bellhop, get my bag.  I need to leave the burning building.  The bellhop's on fire.  This is crazy.  Oh, no.  My horse ran off.  Get back here.  We need some wind, Jimmy. 
[00:39:30]  Come on.  That's a cat.  That's an angry cat.  Your wind sucked.  My wind is very good.  I was voting windiest boy in school.  I hate your wind.  Oh, that's very windy.  That's a good one.  You can't go off in the middle doing wind.  That hurt your lungs, didn't it? 
[00:40:00]  You went a little too deep.  Oh, no.  Those little parrot lungs.  Oh, no.  Now it's that lightning that's real close to your house.  I hate that.  That crackly lightning scares me.  Why?  Because I think the lights are going to go out.  You got to fucking be in New York City for a lightning storm when it echoes around the  buildings. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I've been there.  It's the coolest fucking thing ever, man.  Pretty scary.  You should be on top of one with a fucking tinfoil hat.  I love it.  By the way, is there a place online to find on YouTube?  Yes.  I didn't know it was called Foleywork, but is there an example of amazing Foleywork that  they say this is great Foleywork?  I've seen some documentaries on movies that show them actually doing it, and then they  show the movie behind them while they're doing the Foleywork.  It's amazing.  It fucking really is amazing. 
[00:41:00]  It was the Steven Spielberg of its time.  Yeah.  Old time radio?  They still use it today, though.  They still use that shit today.  There's Foley guys.  Oh, I've got so many different bells.  There's the bell at the end, which is one that Tom Andrew lent me.  Big shit.  And there's a service bell that rings.  Yeah, look at me.  And there's a little cash register bell that's very important in the show.  What is Moby doing?  Oh, yeah, at the drugstore, where he works as a kid, right?  Yes, and also at Martini's Bar when things turn dark. 
[00:41:30]  And they do turn dark.  I bet you like when it turns dark.  It's a Sawzall where I make a glory hole.  We'll bring it at the end of the play when George Bailey rolls.  This guy's terrible.  Yeah, this is horrible.  This is like a Foley thing.  We don't know.  Sam.  Sam, we want a bit.  Sam.  We don't want movie Foley.  Exactly.  Not Foley Edge.  Sam.  A bunch of leaves.  It's like Foley for a podcast.  Exactly.  It's terrible.  Mr. Foley from...  Mick Foley.  Mick Foley, yeah.  Axel Foley.  You know, I don't think we're going to be able to do Jack-tober next year.  There's no more radio stations left. 
[00:42:00]  I know.  There is no job.  Oh, jeez.  There's any sound that needs to be replaced.  The first time that I ever found out that this job existed, I just said, this is for me.  You get to play in the dirt all day and come up with funny props.  The hardest part of the job for me really is the physicality.  Pratt Falls.  That was perfect.  Let's move on.  A big pad for the body sound, a bunch of celery for some high-end crunch, and a nice  wet chamois will give me a fleshy sound.  Wow. 
[00:42:30]  I'm going to take some breakfast cereal, put it in here with the cornstarch.  Uh-huh.  Skim!  These are gloves with paperclips taped onto the ends for the dog claws, and you get a good  paw sound out of the glove.  The creative part of this job is using anything and everything that'll work, whether it's real  or not.  Hey!  That's a long time you do it until it's right, period.  That's a little sweetie whistle.  That was fucking cool.  That is amazing.  I've done what they call, like, I forget what it's called, but we have to-  Shit.  Yes.  As a body of work. 
[00:43:00]  You need that thought.  I should have it ready.  I should never pause.  You should have that thought ready.  Never pause.  Never pause.  I hate pausing on this show.  Wait, I was eating a big, giant, um, you know, I hate pausing on this show.  It's the worst.  Pauses do suck.  I've done the voice where you have to just follow the lips and do a word.  Oh, you've done that?  Sure, for Lucky Louie, for TV, and for-  Is it hard to do, Jimmy?  Very.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Even though you're looking at yourself on screen?  Very hard. 
[00:43:30]  Because you hear a silent boop, boop, boop.  And then you come in.  Yeah.  Come in.  It's called looping.  After the third beep.  Yes.  Boop, boop.  Tire store!  Oh, shit.  I fucked it up.  And then it looks bad.  It's mismatched if you do it wrong.  You can see bad looping.  Oh, yeah.  It's terrible.  It's hard.  You can absolutely see it when they do it correctly.  And he was saying that Murphy was so good at doing that.  That's what Brett Ratner was saying when he was doing cartoons.  He'll knock the whole fucking movie out in 10 hours.  That's what a pro Eddie Murphy is in the cartoon. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  10 hours and then walks away with how many million?  Oh, with huge amounts of cash.  What is this?  Jurassic Park Foley?  Let's see.  Really?  What are they doing?  Why don't you go to the beginning of it?  Why don't you go to the Aaron Foley?  There's Foley clips on YouTube if you're interested.  Foley artists.  It's kind of cool.  Rubber gloves.  Just latex gloves.  We create the sound effects for things that the characters do.  And we usually do them inside the studio.  Wow.  We're going to do a scene for the dinosaur, the little baby dinosaur's hatches.  And so we need a sound of the egg cracking, the wet sound of the egg inside, and then 
[00:44:30]  one of the major characters gets the dinosaur little baby in his hand and sort of pets it  and wipes the goo off.  So Foley comes in and does the dinosaur.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  These large ice cream cones will end up being the egg cracking sound.  The cantaloupe is more of the wet sound.  She's just digging into the middle of a cantaloupe with her hands squishing.  A gooey pineapple skin. 
[00:45:00]  And then the editors come in and make it absolutely perfect.  Mixers mix it perfect and then you have the end prompt.  And there's the scene.  Holy shit.  Very good.  Push.  Push.  Very good.  Ice cream cone cracking.  I can tell.  Yeah.  Sounds like a bunch of pineapples.  And then the gushy.  How come she's not talking? 
[00:45:30]  The editors leave her talking.  And look, you pet the pineapple.  No, you're ruining it.  Stop.  You're ruining it.  That's what Uncle Paul hates because he always recognizes.  He did a lot of Foley work when he was a younger man.  He always yells out in the movie theater what he actually is.  That's an ice cream cone.  That ain't no dinosaur.  Found out something new about Uncle Paul today.  He was a Foley operator.  Yeah, I did.  Foley work.  Foley work.  I don't want to know what Foley work is. 
[00:46:00]  It's like Foley work.  Different.  Yeah.  Sure.  Like you take your hand and you put Earl on it and that sounds like the baby's bottom  getting kissed.  Oh, God.  He actually uses the baby's bottom, of course.  Yeah.  To make the sound of hands clapping.  Everything he uses is something horrible.  Oh, God.  Oh.  How do you make the sounds of skiing?  You just blow into his hiney. 
[00:46:30]  He's got to bring young children to every session.  They're helping me with my Foley work.  Figuring out the perfect sound effects that involves young children.  Oh, my God.  How great would that be?  The thwock, thwock, thwock of a bird flying out of a nest.  Well, you've got to yank his little crank.  Yeah, you yank his little privates.  And when his feet are kicking your chest, that's his.  You tug his private parts.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That sounds like the tribal drums. 
[00:47:00]  That's terrible.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, if we break right now, I think we could do some John and Jeff.  I think we should because of that.  Because I didn't forget about John and Jeff.  I'm not going to be the one that ruins Travis's best day of the year.  Day two.  Day two.  We're a studio full of guys that want to hear two guys that suck.  Right?  That's right.  And you're an audience who has been.  There's actually four guys.  They didn't delete a single thing from their Facebook.  Facebook page, by the way.  Oh, really?  They're all still up there.  We're really going to do Jennifer Hutt today? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  We should.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Nine o'clock.  I'll bet you she's good.  Not a fan?  I'm a fan if she opens up.  Well, it's your job to get her to open up, isn't it?  We were negotiating if she was going to open up.  And she said no negotiating.  So I didn't acknowledge that she even wrote that.  And you guys still booked her.  Yeah.  Well, Eric asked me, should we book her?  I said, yeah.  She's going to have to wait outside, though, for a while until we're feeling it.  Until the shit show.  That's right. 
[00:48:00]  She's welcome to come on after Open Anthem Live.  One question only with Steven Tyler as we go to break, I think.  Oh, by the way, ADR.  You see the picture of him?  ADR was called EROC there.  Yeah.  With his chipped tooth.  What's that?  I looked over.  And, yeah, his eye.  He looks like an old lady, doesn't he?  Yeah, he really looks bad.  He looks like an...  Know what he looks like?  Like a Puerto Rican grandma.  Yeah, it did kind of look...  I couldn't figure out what it looked like.  Because it's easy just to say old lady.  That's him?  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  It's easy to say old lady, but that's like a Puerto Rican grandma.  Dude, I saw that on the news behind you when you were talking before.  Yeah.  That's Steven Tyler.  I fucking thought that was an accident victim.  A woman who was injured.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  He slipped in the bathtub or passed out in the bathtub.  Yeah.  Fainted, whatever it was.  His teeth.  Fell face first into the side of the bathtub.  And he's saying he's, you know, still sober.  Oh, wow.  Because I said yesterday, it's almost impossible to fall and break your teeth.  Unless you're under the influence. 
[00:49:00]  Because you will put your arms up every single time.  He was doing some very dedicated Foley work.  We need the sound of a man hitting his fucking face and tooth.  Oh, look at his lips are all swollen.  A picket fence.  He looks like a Puerto Rican grandmother.  That's exactly what he looks like.  His eyes fucked up, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, man.  He fucking fell.  That's funny.  That was a bad injury.  We love Tyler, though.  We go way back with that fucking guy.  Six thing and falling in a bathtub, though.  Gotta be careful.  Yeah, he's like he didn't break a hip.  Oh, yeah.  Lay in there.  That's the death knell of the old person. 
[00:49:30]  Isn't it, right?  That fucks old people up.  Oh, yeah.  For some reason, they don't come back from that.  Once that hip goes, it's over, Jenny.  Younger people could come back from that, not the older ones.  Oh, yeah.  One question with Steven Tyler, because he doesn't do our show anymore, I guess.  No, he was in at 11 o'clock, so.  He would do our show again, I believe.  Yes, he would.  His management was familiar.  And when me and Roland said hi to him and said we were from the Opie and Anthony show,  he said, look at these fuckers.  That's what he said?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Is that good?  Yeah.  He's just that he's familiar with the show.  He remembers you guys. 
[00:50:00]  After his American Idol time's up, he'll do our show again, right?  That's how that works.  Jesus Christ.  It's West Coast based, I'm sure.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest  we couldn't get.  Rock and roll icon. 
[00:50:30]  Steven Tyler.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  I didn't hear like that, by the way.  Nice.  There was Steven Tyler.  Steven, do you wear belts?  I do.  Thank you so much for your time.  The finest belts in all the land.  Look at that.  Come on now.  Ah, booyah.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM. 
[00:51:00]  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend, Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden.  And we met this guy out front who would sell wrestling pictures.  This fat guy, 300 pounds, a bad mustache.  You know, and we became friends with him somehow.  He's like, oh, give me your address.  He started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before.  And my voice was about this. 
[00:51:30]  It was this deep at 14.  He's on the other end and I'm asking all these questions and he's fucking breathing heavy.  I had no idea.  But then he but then he wound up staying over my house.  What my he knew all the kids in the neighborhood because we all go to matches.  He convinced my dad.  He's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York to New Jersey.  And my parents are a little weird about it.  Like, I don't know.  But like, all right.  You know, they talk to the other parents and neighbor.  You think this is all right?  You know, he's a 40 year old guy hanging around 14 year olds. 
[00:52:00]  They put him in a guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand on my pants.  He snuck down there and I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He grabbed my cock.  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick?  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers.  And he blocked the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I'll give, I got 50 pictures.  And I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything.  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you got to tell mom and dad  about this.  I go, no, because they were going to make me get their pictures back.  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them. 
[00:52:30]  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got that in this camera.  This has been a molestation moment with our friend, Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to put it on.  Ah, this is nice.  Oh, you're awesome.  This is a story about a man. 
[00:53:00]  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  It's late at night.  And now you have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and lost for all my friends. 
[00:53:30]  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he says, that angel.  This is my life. 
[00:54:00]  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  Welcome back, everybody, to Adventures in Docking. 
[00:54:30]  Now, as we all know, docking is when two gay men have their penises erect.  And one man takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the head of the other man's penis.  So, let's go to the phones.  Let's see.  We have Sam here from New York.  Let's see.  Now, Sam, when did this docking fetish begin for you?  Well, I was in college.  I was a freshman in college.  So, I came home for spring break.  And I scheduled it to do it on the first day.  Wow, the very first day, huh? 
[00:55:00]  You sure are eager to try new things.  Yeah.  So, like, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  Okay, so I see what you're saying.  And basically, you figured, hey, I have this extra skin on my penis.  I might as well use it to my sexual advantage.  Yes.  Now, Sam, would you say that your penis is big enough for proper docking?  Like, I don't know, six inches?  I mean, I don't know if I'm quite there.  It's average.  It's fine.  Now, it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman.  And it didn't quite work out.  Tell me about that. 
[00:55:30]  The hole in the foreskin, it wasn't big enough to stretch over.  Well, over his giant cock head.  Gotcha.  So, it wasn't getting stuck to the head.  Right.  It's not stuck to the head.  It's just the hole is too small to fit over the head.  That is so embarrassing.  What did you do about it?  Going forward, I don't want to have to have an explanation.  And so, we went to the urologist to get, you know, a word on it.  Right.  So, you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you could dock with bigger men.  The urologist said, you know, it happens.  It's not typical if you want to change it for aesthetics or for whatever reason. 
[00:56:00]  It's a simple procedure.  And you come in and you do it and you're out.  Well, that's great.  Now you can dock with anybody.  Yeah, that's correct.  Well, Sam, thanks for the call.  This is all the time we have for Adventures in Docking this week.  Join us next week where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party.  See you then.  Series XM.  XM.  The Opinetry Show. 
[00:56:30]  The Devil Went Down to Georgia.  He was looking for a soul to steal.  He was in a bind.  He was way behind.  All right.  Iraq is playing some rejoiner after the first break, which always means it's the magic.  There's a theme to this, a reason he's playing The Devil Went Down to Georgia.  You want to try to figure this one out?  Uh, let's see. 
[00:57:00]  It's the, it was five years ago today that the last person in Georgia was injured at  a Freak Nick event.  Damn.  Give your, ah, no.  I think that was it.  Freak Nick!  I'm going to guess that it's been ten years since anyone gave a shit about Charlie Daniels.  Am I right?  Ten.  I'm being kind.  Yeah.  Turn this part up.  I love this part.  Oh, he's playing a fiddle. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, play that fiddle.  I was a big Charlie Daniels fan back in the day, and when this song came out, this was  like their song that took them from that kind of a cult thing, kind of a, you know, if you  were into southern rock and shit like this, you were into this.  Right.  But this song put him in the mainstream, and then we were like, fuck your guy!  Oh, really?  Sellout!  Yeah.  And then anybody that liked this song, we were like, fuck you, man, you don't know Charlie  Daniels.  You actually knew Charlie Daniels before this? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  What were the other songs before this?  Oh, my God.  I have no idea.  It was fucking...  I know, it's a long time ago.  We didn't prepare for our Charlie Daniels break.  I know.  I understand that.  There was, um...  I used to know every word of this fucking song.  It was that damn good.  And I used to play the air fucking fiddle.  Long-haired country boy.  That was before this.  Yeah.  I'm gonna go with, um...  Uh...  Hmm...  Wow.  I just realized I don't think I know another Charlie Daniels song.  I remember a few... 
[00:58:30]  If I heard the names, obviously I'd remember them, but...  Uh...  Yeah.  Let me see.  Where are the songs?  Down there?  Uh...  All these are the ones before...  All right.  Well, we can take it from here.  Uneasy Rider.  Not many people would know as far as mainstream goes.  Long-haired country boy.  Sure.  The South's gonna do it again.  Sure.  That's about it, Ant.  All right.  Let me see.  Let me think about it.  Hold on.  Sure.  For more, like, radio hits and mainstream is what... 
[00:59:00]  Trudy, I remember.  Which one?  Trudy.  Trudy.  Yeah.  Oh, that one down in Georgia?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The devil bowed in.  I'm pissing.  I just came back.  I got so money.  The South's gonna do it again.  I said that one.  Oh.  That's about it.  Uneasy Rider?  What are the hits before...  What are the hits after The Devil?  He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e.  Here's the hits after.  Wee-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e- 
[00:59:30]  Simple Man's totally different, though.  It's weird.  I didn't know that.  It's very good. 
[01:00:00]  Give me Simple Man.  Yeah.  Fucking love Skinner.  Damn, are you?  I do, too.  Play some Skinner, man.  Find Charlie Daniels' Simple Man.  This Charlie?  Yeah.  By the way, he's 75 today.  That's why.  Oh, 75.  Gee, many creaky.  Devil's playing fiddle.  That's right.  And you don't like that sound, right?  What?  That guitar?  No, this is kind of cool.  All right, good.  See, there's a difference between this fucking whoozy thing and slide guitar. 
[01:00:30]  Slide guitar, steel guitar.  Call me a red and you reckon that I am, but this thing's going up.  Yeah, this is a good one.  Down to the core.  Core.  Core.  Core.  I have to work like a dog that make ends meet.  There's crooked politicians who cry in the street, and I'm madder to hell.  I ain't a gonna take it at no molar.  I'm sure you do that with other people, too. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know what's wrong with the world today.  People not known with the Bible, the way they believe it.  By the Lord, the jungle, not the Lord, the land. 
[01:01:30]  All right, we're not going to go over.  Unless you want to.  I was thinking of the problem with this radio, this studio here, the feeling back here.  Remember where you been?  Is that they're all the same?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And everything, it just, it's just, it's all the same back here.  Just, it feels cookie cutter.  Everything back here feels very cookie cutter.  Why are you doing that? 
[01:02:00]  Well, he kind of made a, made a deal with himself that he would say cookie cutter in that way.  Because I said everything you're doing.  On the air.  It just feels cookie cutter.  I don't know why he says it that way.  It's the only way to say it.  But, it certainly is.  Fuck.  I don't even know my thought right now.  That's too good.  What are we doing, John and Jeff?  Yeah, we got to do John and Jeff. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, no, no, I do have something.  Quick, Anthony.  Is it a kiss for everyone?  I know how much Jimmy especially loves Bernie Madoff.  I just respect his business ethic.  And his wife is really hot, and I love how he raised his kids.  Good egg.  Yeah, he's got a relationship with them.  This guy continues to be the biggest scumbag that almost has walked his planet.  Almost.  He's right up there.  Hitler?  He wants to announce to the world that he is happier in prison than free. 
[01:03:00]  And that he's been, he hasn't been this happy in about 20 years.  He needs people to know that.  He's away from his wife.  He needs people to know that.  This scumbag.  The weight of all that fucking crime and thinking he's going to get caught is gone.  And that was probably so taxing on him.  He's kind of respected in prison.  He's in jail.  He's a fucking goddy. 
[01:03:30]  He fucking stole a billion dollars.  No one in jail has stolen a billion dollars.  And he doesn't have to worry.  But he continues to show the world how much of a piece of shit he is.  He's a gangster.  And by the way, if you knew what you did to other people's lives on the level he did it.  Well, I'm a straight up gangster.  Wouldn't you just shut your fucking mouth and not tell the world how happy you are?  And that you haven't been happier in 20 years?  His own son fucking hung himself.  Yeah, I wonder if he's happy about that.  Right.  This is why he should not be in a minimum security.  And this is why the hatred for these guys is so strong. 
[01:04:00]  He should be in a horrible, maximum.  I know he's on a flight risk, but the punishment should be so fucking horrid and extreme.  Fucking ass prison.  Yeah.  Beating prison.  I guess so happier in prison than he was on the outside because he no longer lives in fear,  like Ant said, pretty much, of being arrested and knows he will die in prison.  Baba Walters interviewed him.  Oh, yeah?  How does he get, how do they let him talk on Barbara Walters?  Because the media and Barbara Walters and the ilk are vultures, and they just know that 
[01:04:30]  it's going to get great ratings.  No, no, but how does the prison let him talk?  How about no?  How about no, you don't get to go on Barbara Walters and tell everybody you're fucking happy,  you cunt.  You know what I bet it is?  I bet it's like anything else.  I bet the warden or whoever's got to make the decision is like, well, I get to meet Barbara  Walters.  Yeah.  This is going to be great.  They're probably going to show me, and yeah, we'll talk to you.  It'll be great.  It's not on camera interview.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  No, Barbara.  What is it, by telephone? 
[01:05:00]  They did, and Barbara interviewed him, and then described the interview.  Because she interviewed his wife.  Yeah, that's right.  Who what?  That's right.  Oh, so he wasn't even on camera?  No.  So it's like it's some stupid cookie cutter interview.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Madoff said that while he contemplated suicide during his early days behind bars, he lacked  the courage and never thinks about killing himself.  Now, he was distraught over his son's suicide.  A little distraught for a week. 
[01:05:30]  And then his wife wanted to stop visiting him in prison after that, and he agreed.  He has not seen her since.  He has terrible remorse.  He says he knows that he ruined his family, Walter said.  Adding that Madoff told her that with the help of therapy, he does not think about what  he has done.  But at night, he says he has horrible nightmares.  That's good he's in therapy.  Fucking, this is why, and I know you hate the man, but these Occupy Walls, just because  they're hassling, how else do you fucking, well, no, you, but you're way behind, Jimmy. 
[01:06:00]  They're not hassling that.  Now, today, the Occupy Wall Street people are going to be protesting against the TSA,  or not TSA, the MTA.  They want free rides for the unemployed.  Yeah.  And where are they going to be?  So the bank thing, the Wall Street thing, it's just symbolic now.  They don't care about Wall Street anymore.  By the way, which, you know, bounced into the 12 grand area, it's having one of its  greatest months. 
[01:06:30]  But they're so fucked over there, they don't know what they're talking about.  Now they want free rides on the MTA for the unemployed.  Good luck with that one.  Everyone thinks they want free, they want money, they want this.  Where are they going to be?  Same place.  Their dumb fucking park.  Might just kind of go back down.  They're saying the protest is not original like it was at one point.  Yeah.  It's what, like a dime a dozen, kind of very similar to others.  Same protest I've seen. 
[01:07:00]  It is the same protest I've seen.  No, but Jimmy's trying to find the words.  It's become cookie cutter.  The protest is cookie cutter.  How obnoxious.  That is the worst thing ever that he has come up with.  No, it's not the worst thing ever.  No, Chip.  It's not the worst thing ever, right, E-Rock?  Hit it.  Exactly.  Oh, no.  He threw his arms up in the air.  He should be a shotgun trigger with your toe.  Exactly.  He just mouthed the words, what the fuck does he want? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, shit.  Sam, do you know the answer?  No, I don't.  You don't know the one thing that is worse than?  Cookie cutter.  I can't make myself do that.  I would think, but I love that.  It's a rusted choice.  This is great.  Oh, this?  We all live in a yellow submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich. 
[01:08:00]  Submarine sandwich.  Submarine sandwich.  You know what?  We're in the middle of a bit.  Oh, worse than.  What is worse than?  Ann says it's the worst thing ever, and I said, no, there's one thing worse.  You mean that if I'm pointing out that everything is the same, but I'm saying that it's cookie cutter.  It's cookie cutter.  Ann said, worst thing ever, and I said, no.  Relax.  So I need E-Rock to focus and read my mind.  Worst thing for Opie, not for you, because all of a sudden we start playing treadmill sounds. 
[01:08:30]  Because he doesn't like to get his feet dirty.  What is worse than that, E-Rock?  Come on.  I know you can do this.  Come on.  And it's not just for me.  I would say it's for the whole show.  Right.  He doesn't have confidence.  What do you got?  No.  What's worse than cookie cutter?  But he's thinking.  Yeah, because he loves cookie cutters, because that means cookies are coming.  I like to sing. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, that's why, then.  Everyone's watching to see what he will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh, everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  See, everyone's trying to get it right now. 
[01:09:30]  Everyone's working for the weekend.  Everyone's working on the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  You want a piece of my heart? 
[01:10:00]  And I didn't know that.  No, you missed that.  That's not worse.  It's pretty bad, but it's not worse than cookie cutter.  You can't get a musical number and say it's going to be worse, because it's music and it's great.  Anyone else in this room got it?  No.  One thing worse.  One thing worse.  No.  Unrocky got it?  Oh, wow. 
[01:10:30]  Someone is writing Hugh Pinero's breath.  Well, that's pretty bad.  That was bad.  And that's old school, but no.  That was bad. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  Not the Duke.  Not two bad knees.  18 years ago, I left Dayton.  We love this.  Two very bad knees.  We absolutely love this one.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  What happened?  Who gets credit for it?  I thank God the dream came true. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God gets the credit.  It did come true, though.  That's good.  Well, crying like a motherfucking bitch.  I will give a clue.  Sissy.  Yes, that's what I was looking for, E.  Oh, E-Rock.  It just hit him, he said.  I hate when he talks into earphones.  I hate it, too.  I know.  And then he chooses sometimes who to talk to.  Yeah, he talks to me.  He'll talk to you.  Sometimes he'll talk to all of us, and sometimes he'll give us individual private messages.  What is that, E-Rock?  Talk on the air.  It's creepy. 
[01:12:00]  I know.  This is not your private IM fucking service.  Just say it on the air, because then it sounds like I'm talking to myself.  Because I'm talking back to you.  Yeah, because all of a sudden I'm listening to one thing, and all of a sudden you're in my ear  peeping about.  He did say it just came to him.  He loves that talk back button.  He really does.  His pizza delivery.  Anything he says.  Jimmy just came to me.  It just hit me.  Yeah, what did you order?  A whole bunch of pizza pies.  Can you humor me?  Because what you did is the second worst thing ever.  Okay. 
[01:12:30]  Can you do it one more time?  Because then I got the answer.  Um, I just don't want it to be like a bit that's a cookie daughter.  This is the only thing worse than that.  Hit it, E-Rock.  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think women who keep their maiden names in marriage are high maintenance.  We're two guys who think DNA tests should be mandatory before a man's name goes on a  birth certificate.  We're two guys who think nobody should get married before the age of 30.  The John and Jeff show. 
[01:13:00]  The John and Jeff show.  They are just fucking rebels.  They're wild.  That is crazy to even put out there because people hear that, by the way.  They're saying it like no one's going to hear it and react to it and write in or call  or just get upset.  Well, Anthony.  Taking chances.  Those two.  We're two guys that believe that if there's not enough half and half, Starbucks should refill  it.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:13:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You take a picture!  Oh!  Oh!  Wow!  A lot of people saying this one is just sad, though.  Yeah.  This John and Jeff is just a sad one.  Well, they also don't check their Facebook page very often because the pests, as they like  to be called have literally for the last 24 hours been attacking their facebook page they're still 
[01:14:00]  going from yesterday they have twitter yeah i guess i'll look it up here's the thing um sam  decided we were halfway through john and jeff before we did our amazing mark walbert yes fucking  amazing that guy was great amazing i can't wait to have him back yeah looks like he'll come back  yes for a longer visit yeah um so we got like three clips left from john and jeff to finish  up yesterday's october and then sam decided you know what why not have a bonus john and jeff today 
[01:14:30]  holy shit well a lot of john and jeff on the on the plate the problem is that i john and jeff is best  served in its full form you were sprinkling john and jeff yes it's very cold in space  you're sprinkling john and jeff throughout the show yes i don't like that and i don't think that's  respect to john and jeff yeah and so i thought that we should have a more concentrated john and  jeff thing how am i going to disagree with that all right so we got to finish up yesterday where 
[01:15:00]  they had some topic i forgot the topic oh god the topic was about the house and the car and the  fucking jet ski and the thing how rich your marriage or yeah if you're if you're wealthy  what uh and have things like a lot of nice things um you're not as happy and it makes more tension in  your in your marriage let's say and i'm just going to throw out the top of my head you maybe you have  a house a big house a nice cars motorcycle motorcycles a boat jet ski a really nice barbeque 
[01:15:30]  jewelry uh a pool uh child pornography yes uh jet ski jet ski a big house house electronics  all right how many times did he fucking go over that it was an uninteresting list the first time  by the 35th time it was just unbearable are you ready for the list for the 36th time so let's talk  about this think thinking back maybe it was just a few years ago the more materialistic possessions  that you had in your relationship did it help or hurt the marriage or relationship that you were in 
[01:16:00]  give us a call 877-300-7645 it's a free call 877-300-7645 the big cars the expensive houses  did it actually help your relationship having all of that or was it the stress of trying to pay for it  all yeah the more you have the more you have to pay look wow that's uh really radio guys do topics 
[01:16:30]  all the time right and i thought i really thought i heard the worst radio topic ever when i was  driving through uh i think i was on my way to cape con i think i remember this one and i was listening  to howie carr yeah who's supposedly terrific some would say oh yeah he did a uh ice cream topic  your favorite ice cream what's your favorite ice cream what's your favorite ice cream which  is a great throwaway topic he did it for an hour and a half he did it until i think every ice cream  flavor was mentioned because that's all you could do with that topic it's a dumb topic you can't go 
[01:17:00]  off on a tangent story yeah about how it became your favorite uh flavor yeah why it is who else has  that favorite flavor it's uninteresting you know how you do it you go around the room quickly what's  your favorite ice cream and then people like oh okay hope likes that and likes that jimmy let's do  that then gregory ted i am curious what is your favorite ice cream i prefer lima bean ice cream  with little delicious pieces of lima beans sprinkled about that sounds horrid it's lovely it's green 
[01:17:30]  with a giant skin over it oh my god lima bean ice cream where do you get that you have to make it  yourself gregory take a bunch of lima beans and you make the ice cream and it gets cold what you  just mash them up and put them in the freezer you most certainly do with an ice cream like flavor  well that's not ice cream that's just frozen that's just frozen you need some kind of cream to make  it's ice cream yes it is i have cream like i'm making ice cream and then i fill it with lima  beans and i have like a nice skin over it sounds great with little real lima beans in there like 
[01:18:00]  treats you'll find one like a treasure see i would listen to that for an hour easily but howie car  did it until every ice cream flavor was mentioned and then he moved on to news or something uh i  officially think this is the worst real topic i've ever heard okay because it means this means  nothing of course people's lives are better if they got cool shit no they're saying lives are  better if they don't got cool shit what that's what the top that's what the survey says who would 
[01:18:30]  ever agree to that nobody because nobody calls oh no one calls no so we're moving on to the next  track and john and jeff refuse to stop setting up this topic this is the fifth track on are they getting  no calls no they weren't getting any calls on this topic whatsoever we've thrown shit out there and  go oh fuck okay that's dead and you just move on you move on why aren't they moving on they suck  they have four topics and we're talking about a new survey out that suggests the more materialistic  items you have during your marriage the more problems you're gonna have you know i swear to 
[01:19:00]  you by the way this is a new fucking track we did not play this either what they're not yesterday's  tracks either they're brand we haven't heard them before that's what i'm saying this is a new track  we haven't played this one yet it's the more problems you're gonna have like what you're not  going to communicate as much you're not going to resolve your differences as well because of  materialistic things oh so if you live in a big house you got a nice car chances are you're gonna  have more problems in your relationship the question is the house of the car why would a house cause 
[01:19:30]  more problems in your relationship why would an expensive car cause problems in your relationship  maybe because you're not making your payments on time get into that or maybe your relationship  is driving into the garage of that expensive house shut the door and start it gets out of  control the spending and your overhead is starting to cave in on you oh and or maybe you feel that  pressure that you can't got an idea you can't hold that up anymore financially or maybe you resolve  your differences by saying i'm sorry honey here's a piece of jewelry and then suddenly the woman's like 
[01:20:00]  okay he still loves me i swear to you i'm sitting here as a radio guy with an open mind trying to  figure out how this would possibly work on a radio show what's the angle i'm not even joking  what would the angle be it's fucking awful it's it's just terrible it's fucking beyond me how bad  it is dreadful i can't even imagine one phone call that would be of interest no if they got any yeah  the best possible phone call with this bit still would be almost as bad as having no phone calls 
[01:20:30]  right it doesn't make any sense were there any calls no are you cutting the calls out  no i'm not cutting the calls out calls on this no if we're hearing the tracks how long is each break  before commercial that's a great question this is the fifth track so how how much time has gone by  uh with the same topic trying to be uh pushed forward they would do the topic and then they would  read a news a different news story go to break come back with the same topic trying to get the 
[01:21:00]  phones lit up again like they would go to they went to break i think twice and they read another  news story here or there uh and then they would go back to this survey trying to light those phones  up so usually when you set up a topic like that then you go to a phone call they never went to the  phone call there was no phone call and they just kept like this probably lasted here and wonder why  radio is a disaster yeah yeah of course it's a disaster sucks all told uh them searching 
[01:21:30]  resetting this bit up over and over again would have lasted 20 to 30 minutes  20 to 30 minutes all right well good news holy shit good news what they mentioned the fucking john  and jeff teased next story which is apparently romantic and said included is a casey casem  impression oh that's right they're finally moving on they moved on this is a new so they gave up on  that topic officially or no there's yes there's no conclusion to it that was it that's it it just 
[01:22:00]  sat there with no phone calls that's where they never had a phone call oh my god we'll check out  the news file for news and nonsense including this is one of the saddest most romantic stories you'll  ever hear coming up sad yet romantic yes i read this story and i said wow it's very sad very romantic  there's two words to describe this what do you think they are i don't know sad uh-huh that's the first 
[01:22:30]  romantic you got both of them yeah they didn't do that you don't have to reiterate that oh my god  very romantic all right i think we'll have to whip out casey casem for long distance dedication  long distance dedication yeah can you still do your casey a little bit i'm casey casem and we're  counting them down not bad and i love casey i love casey too yeah i used to listen to casey casem  every weekend and but you know but i i i saw this story and i said uh i gotta share this very 
[01:23:00]  romantic about a couple very sad i'm gonna say stick around for the rest that romantic and they  were scared they did a casey casem you know we're not making fun we're not making fun we're all big  fans here so i hope he doesn't get mad that i just did a who gives a fuck uh rendition of his  voice i don't want to burn that bridge sad and romantic uh you got to go to avert 91 here hopefully  the story is his mother died choking on his father's cum that would be unexpected hilarious 
[01:23:30]  that's uh both sad and romantic do we get a conclusion same time yeah i included the story  oh thank you and let me tell you thank you is it romantic it is is it sad is it said yeah  yeah it's sad yes it is i would say and i heard this story and i was listening to the show  and after after jeff did the story i thought to myself wow that is sad and romantic  they can't be enjoying this right now are they enjoying this out there i cannot believe how bad 
[01:24:00]  they are no they're horrible it's horrible radio and at the very least and cbs decided to make these  guys their go-to overnight show hey why not syndicate them and this story that they put out  maybe the least uplifting story i've ever heard in my entire life oh really it's horrible it's horrible  it's a tragic story where's the romantic part then it's somewhat romantic but it's i mean in the end 
[01:24:30]  of the day you just oh that's horrible like the two old people spooning in the titanic scene yeah  it's it's it's romantic in a way where it's like oh they got but the sadness way blows away  yeah any of the romance part why don't you help her out you old doddering idiot sit and lay in there  taking a nap go to the fucking top of the ship spooning uh becomes not fun when you're in freezing  cold water freezing cold water starting to come up to the bed drowning to death when you're in freezing 
[01:25:00]  cold water and your lungs are filling up with it with extremely cold water at what point do you  think they stopped spooning and realized it was a horrible idea that it was beyond horrific  oh shit we should have got upstairs this isn't gonna be quick yeah it's gonna be a slow horrid  death when it's just like creeping up over their ankles and they're going oh no now we can't get  upstairs when did the guy realize it's so horrific that he pushed off his loved one i gotta get the  fuck out of here trying to find a way out i left her spooning her own stupid self 
[01:25:30]  all right john we got a story here uh it's sad and romantic all right so it's like it's a double  shot here a couple who was married what for check this out 72 years ah they were married 72 years  when did they get married 72 years ago you dumb motherfucker he said it twice when did they get  married do some math with one of the worst radio voices ever when did they get married they were 
[01:26:00]  married for 72 years i wish why would that be the first thing in your head 1920 i wish that he had  responded exactly how you did 72 years ago fuck dumb fuck no it's like well let me do some uh  where's the calendar it would be the calendar it'd be like 38 39 you don't have to know exactly  they were probably if they're married 72 years they probably got married relatively young so right 
[01:26:30]  there's no reason to ask that and really who gives a shit when they got married  it's like before 2000 yeah yeah when did they get married 12 they got married i'll explain what  happened um so they're married 17 72 years they passed away one hour apart in a hospital together  holding hands wow gordon and norma yeager in iowa um they met the day after high school 
[01:27:00]  graduation they tied the knot in uh and got married 1931 but the story takes a turn they met  while they were participating in a uh a lynching in the south she had falsely accused a negro of  of touching her buttocks in the store and he and his friends lynched the boy only to find out they  were wrong and then he and her fell in love and got married married it was wonderful love at first 
[01:27:30]  sight there's love at first sight of course it was he loved the smell of rope oil on his hands  that story isn't sad or romantic it's hysterical it is great yeah wouldn't you just like  that's what you're doing radio to annoying people down at what why they die now apart maybe there was  a fucking reason what was did they have diseases did they fucking they probably one bull gave them  both aids one young strapping bull instead they used the slow quiet voice to you know we they died 
[01:28:00]  together yeah together in the hospital actually holding uh the way you two should go hands  actually holding hands john and jeff holding hands yeah the hospital dying fucking both burn  fucking head to toe i wish they would fucking hold hands and jump off the rim of the grand canyon  oh i don't know about it no i'm serious that's not even a joke fucking go jump i hate these two  why are we doing this still talking about lady boys on their facebook page by the way all right  let's find the why i don't know this dumb story right sad got married in 1939 she was 90 he was 94 
[01:28:30]  what happened was the two were in an auto accident and rushed to the icu  now the icu nurses didn't want to separate them so they're in the hospital together next to each  other and they were looking at the cd and they were holding hands and they wanted to be together  you know i mean if you're gonna you know you're a married couple i think that'd be the way to do it 
[01:29:00]  yeah i don't care  well no shit 
[01:29:30]  that's how you do the fucking story they're gonna do it who cares who gives a fuck they lived a long  life together yeah car accident too which sucks they were 90 yeah at least he was their fault  yeah right why the fuck are they still driving that's how we would handle that turtle play rear  end of them fucking old burdens slow yeah exactly an old beetle i wish it was a better story that 
[01:30:00]  they're both fucked today by a large dog oh like he thought the husband came home and found a giant  saint bernard fucking the wife in the ass and her she's grabbing her chest and he tried to help  so the dog fucked his mouth for good measure well you have to yeah that the uh the the humorous thing  would be if the hospital was now sued by the family for not separating them putting them in  uh separate uh or or er's and uh and fixing them trying to do something yeah they just sat there 
[01:30:30]  watching them hold hands and went oh okay yeah let them be watch them drop dead um this clip  it's not it's just not used enough on this show yeah it's there's so many things that clip is that's  kevin so many things to not care about who died first i wasn't listening i was listening to kevin  he was cracking me up the other person i don't know what it was but there was a quote that said  this has been the happiest hour of my life finally finally an hour of peace away from the shit stain  and that was the last word they said shit stain those two holding hands they were probably 
[01:31:00]  fucking welded together by heat their old fucking skin melted they weren't trying to hold hands  he had his fist in her vagina it was a fisting accident their studebagger was hit by a dump truck  while he was fisting he parked on the expressway fuck those guys aren't guys  no no why would you do that story and you hear the way he said it  uh yeah they were uh brought in and uh the uh the nurses wouldn't separate them the uh holding 
[01:31:30]  hands suddenly bob during contract talks ah terrible uh guys guys i didn't know work in the past year  so i uh sitting with this is the best i'm gonna be able to do for you sitting with management i was  holding hands with them right and uh your deal died maybe i should have looked at options for the  last year but chose not to so now it's up to you guys  yuck pluck pluck pluck yeah all right we got a decision to make you know john and jeff i'm saying 
[01:32:00]  it right now bonus bonus john and jeff yes after the break now here's this is why i gave you a bonus  disc because you guys took the easy way out yesterday play a couple of tracks here play a couple of tracks  there and then go into today and play a couple of tracks yeah i got one bit from their show  and i would like to see how long you guys can stay on board for one bit well what they're doing is so

[01:40:30]  my hair long to hopefully look younger the page hasn't mentioned yesterday the page hasn't been attacked yet  but uh what's happening is they're finding old stuff and posting it as if it's you guys like the  the caption says this video is gnarly man  and it's uh you guys interviewing the lacrosse team  could we could you play that really fast yeah and that's it i mean jocktober victims don't realize we spent a month  playing real rock tv clips oh yeah oh wow hey it's opi and anthony we're kind of hanging out at the 
[01:41:00]  boston blazers lacrosse practice with jeff how you doing deep inside the hindenburg by the way we're in  a dirigible floating high above boston all right it's a visual yes jeff just got off the field and  he's like really sweaty and stuff but mike mike he's been nice enough to join us on real rock tv  now i know one misconception about indoor lacrosse  okay you guys don't make a million dollars a year that was hilarious he goes i know one 
[01:41:30]  misconception about indoor lacrosse and then opi who just said that tips the mic over to the lacrosse  guy like like that was that wasn't a question it was it was a statement but then it came right  back to you yeah it's like you anointed him yeah we don't even make uh a tenth of that  i heard rumors that you guys make about a hundred to two hundred dollars a game uh average player  makes about two and a quarter uh highest paid player is only about 550 he's getting like 60 minutes 
[01:42:00]  with you uh probing at him like this hope you're scaring me no i know this because i had a few  minutes but why were you scared because uh he was scaring me because we are so different from 60 minutes  and that he was becoming so much like 60 minutes i was frightened that our show was done with  jim jimmy i think you might have been scared i might piss him off to the point he takes a shot at us  i was just happy to be there we're basically laughing at him that you do all this and you don't even 
[01:42:30]  get paid and you don't get paid what else did prince valiant ask  no i know this because i had a few uh buddies from high school that played indoor lacrosse and  they did it just for the love of the game man no that's the only thing that we can do it's like  the nhl started with the original six i guess we're the original six oh yeah the pioneers of  indoor lacrosse say hi to mark man from the boston blazers hey how's it going no day noticed about  you dude you got some like gnarly scabs on your name man all right we can stop 
[01:43:00]  well that's fair he had some gnarly scabs man  i thought i was gonna be found out to be  you're gonna be the next like mtv no i was i was too old for that gig so i grew out the hair and  changed up my fucking what your vocabulary vocabulary vocabulary and talk like the kids 
[01:43:30]  talk yeah exactly words hit it check it out you got to get on real rock tv yeah  oh yes okay obi just just swatted the mic away from in front of him in utter disgust  yeah how am i connected to that guy would you what would you do to him you go back right now  you're right there you're in the lacrosse area yes and you just heard you say yeah i would absolutely 
[01:44:00]  take two fists full of hair and just yank it out of his fucking stupid head and then and then pop  it on top of yours yeah exactly i'll take that thank you yeah i can use a little of that up top  now why is it noticeable no i'm just kidding there's a there's a cool face i remember there's a cool face  to the camera too you want oh yeah i think i think it's after this i think if it's the clip i'm uh  remembering i think i hit his shoulder all right yeah don't you go i can smack his shoulder pads 
[01:44:30]  there's like an awkward like there's nothing to do here so i'm gonna why are we interviewing these  guys why tv set it up yeah yeah guys uh i think didn't we have to do something there like uh yeah  we did something that night there or something at the lacrosse game i don't oh i remember uh stupid  jim and i say stupid lovingly yeah what's his last name again sales guy oh boy mcgreevey he was jones 
[01:45:00]  dare to dare to dream i forgot his last name holy shit you nazium jim nastix used to love showing  any cricket he used to love showing us his dick at all times eat crack corn and i don't care i don't  care he did the fame is putting his fucking balls and cock through the uh the stand-up uh wrestler cut  comic i'll cut out who was the wrestler again that's some good we had it in our uh studio and he 
[01:45:30]  decided to come in and just put his ball bag and his dick through the where the rock no it was one of  the fucking steel or something oh shelly bedford he's a big wrestler uh steel couldn't have been  georgie animal steel no no fucking steel and then he would try to get our attention and we're like what  and then we finally noticed that he just had his he was the sales guy yeah yeah imagine one of the  sales guys around here coming in just showing off his fucking ball bag it wouldn't happen never but 
[01:46:00]  i remember at the uh indoor lacrosse game he had this camera that had one of those lenses that went  oh yeah the lens that came came out yeah they used to have those cameras man remember the lens would  really come out like in three levels yeah yeah and he thought it was hilarious to put it in his  pants and undo his fly and just over and over again make the lens get like that yeah the lens pop out of  us didn't take a lot to entertain us maybe the xfl people saw this and knew you could do a sports  show of course i get it let's hear the rest the rock tv yeah how to go back awesome awesome 
[01:46:30]  these pads really do work were you hitting him that hard yeah i know you tapped him like three  times on the shoulder with the big giant fucking tortoise shell pads he's got on and you're like these pads  really work he didn't yell in pain when i fucking gave him i gotta tell you that could be the funniest  thing that was not intentional that i've ever seen in my life it wasn't supposed to be funny obviously 
[01:47:00]  but i had nothing else to ask the guy so then out of nowhere i just i i lightly tap him and and and  think i'm punching him like mike tyson really work why aren't you screaming awesome  these pads really do work something oh yes he got hit with daffodil is this linked to our real  facebook page e-rock it should be all right we'll uh link it to what opian anthony on facebook is that 
[01:47:30]  what we got yeah we'll put it up where's Anthony i think i hope it's in this one there was a face you  made at the camera where is it if it's here now dude when you're not playing lacrosse what do you do  for a living i'm actually a stripper apart we've decided to find the worst scar on the team my god  what is going on over there oh you know it's part of the game once in a while you just strap it back  on six months later i gotta ask how how did that happen man uh a guy came around gave me a two-hander

[01:54:30]  well there were a couple edits okay but you know i mean look at the lengths on the tracks  how long did this take in their show to do 45 minutes oh  and john and jeff have a top 10 list yeah top 10 occupations  that drink the most ah well we could sink our teeth right into this one how long would you spend  on it we wouldn't even do it wouldn't do it at all why would we do it you'd see it on the  sheet and move past it here it is is there gonna be some kind of surprise there like oh 
[01:55:00]  oh i don't know tap 10 kindergarten teacher oh i would have thought that wow wow that's how you  do list what that's the reason you do lists like that right a surprise answer to go oh really the  president of the united states i didn't know wow i would have thought now that's scary airline pilot  yes yes william teft and if that were the case wouldn't you say oh man this new statistic just came  out that the president drinks more than anybody else not we have a top 10 list if you can name 
[01:55:30]  the other nine i'll tell you and they're gonna take phone calls until they get all 10 probably  they're gonna try that's a trick in the business and this one does get phone calls  and that's the other thing i wanted to show you that there are bits that sometimes get phone calls  oh good and so they like to keep the callers on for a long time as well now uh is the first clip  a setup clip why yes it is opie it's a minute long well they have to how many different ways could you  say top 10 occupations that drink the most oh my plus uh coming up uh that's a fun list 
[01:56:00]  plus uh coming up uh 10 occupations that drink the most 10 occupations that drink the most  could i please take a couple of guesses gregory oh oh yes i'm going to say uh um sardine salesman  headphone manufacturer shoe cleaner um basketball stitcher terrible guy i uh 
[01:56:30]  got those on the list basketball i don't think so not on the list i don't think so  yeah old school ones yes you make those no footlocker hat snacker  they drink them excessively for tired  drink the most plus that some third shift trivia coming up all right these occupations that drink the  most let me just see if i can uh guess a couple of these okay if it's come heavy drinkers are 
[01:57:00]  i'm going to say dentists cops uh let's see other heavy drinkers firemen firemen cops firemen  attorneys no that's on the list let me just write down five occupations that i think are heavy drinkers  how about you just say it i'm going to say dentists you just did too and then he's going to go through  the other two that he did realize how fast they're going to get through this one yeah slow it down whoa 
[01:57:30]  they are they are they are the kings of slowing things down slow it down middle of the night they  gotta get through it i'm gonna say that it's dentists  can you imagine how thin their pile of show prep is for every show it's one piece of paper with one  topic on it drinkers i'm gonna say dentists  i'm gonna say truckers you think truckers are uh enjoying the booze 
[01:58:00]  yeah dentists truckers attorneys right i'm scanning that the i got the top 10 here and uh  oh god tv news people  tv news anchors yeah  they just stink did you know that he had the top 10 no i'm so glad he told me sam because i really 
[01:58:30]  didn't know who had the actual list i was very confused by that yeah it's like who in the room  has the list oh oh jeff okay is it on the wall maybe or does an individual have yeah no jeff was  holding it is it on a computer screen does the intern have it i need to go  this is  shit i got the list  that's why he wanted to remind everybody in case in the in those 60 seconds you had forgotten 
[01:59:00]  right the reason that john was naming jobs is because jeff had the top 10 list he's a list  yeah yeah the list in his hand  i um i think the uh way to do this is to have somebody guess to have someone guess  to have someone guess the uh uh list so somebody should guess i uh i have a list  oh okay and i'd like one of you to guess um there's 10 of them not 11 this is ponderous 
[01:59:30]  you have a list of 10 well i can't even do it it's the good news um jeff decides to set up the  bit one more time you can't do this it's true it's all true it can't be true it is true it's not  like it's not misleading it's not out of context it says jeff decides to set up the bit one more 
[02:00:00]  time in case because it takes time i think people i think their strategy is to just keep hammering a  topic so people have to call in because they realize look they're not going to get to anything  more interesting if i want to call a radio show i have to do it let me throw this question out john  see if you can figure it out what occupation drinks the most well i i said a few so i'm going to say  attorneys attorneys he already said that all right i've got the top ten john he's got to see here i'm 
[02:00:30]  scanning with my bionic eyeball it did oh boy you see he was looking at the top ten list that he  had previously mentioned but he already told them attorneys are on the list i heard that he's  already set up you i'm going to say attorney yeah that was one of the few you said the one it was  the one you said that he said was on the list he already said it was on the list he knows it's on  the list so he doesn't need his bionic eye no why would you just scan a list of i can see me 
[02:01:00]  should i have a list of 200 000 and your bionic eye yeah if you have a list of ten charla nash could read  that's do you really need a bionic eye yes yeah i love uh how they what what happened  i don't know just when they good when they attach a camera to those fucking high altitude balloons  oh yeah that's pretty cool john let's see here i'm scanning with my bionic eyeball  it did crack the top ten it is number three oh it's number three so that is not 
[02:01:30]  the answer i have here so let's let's uh see if you can figure this out all right what is he talking  about what do you mean it made the list it made the list what is he talking about guess the number  one i think they changed it because they're saying oh it is on the list we got it okay now we're  looking for number one oh god because we can't end this now is that a wrong answer because he didn't  explain that he was going for the number one answer he said it up he just said what's on the list 
[02:02:00]  he set it up 19 times and he didn't set it up properly this is horrible this is infuriating  it was on the list we were better in 1997 it's true and this is by the way yesterday's show  yesterday answer i have here so let's let's uh see if you can figure this out all right it's time to  play occupations that drink the most and here's a question according to a recent survey here's the  question you just said what the question was holy shit what a bunch of milking idiots i gotta hear 
[02:02:30]  that again no he didn't say the question he named what the name of the game was and now the question  associated with the game now it's a game it's a game it's a game now uh by the way i got it all the way  i gotta communicate from uh michael mike oh pelka stunt brain stunt brain old stump brain we know i'm  a stump brain he uh he wrote me he went down to occupy wall street he's a big fan of ows he goes  down there a lot protest last night was awful oh no he's not a fan in that way i know okay 
[02:03:00]  protest last night was awful fucking cold wet half empty mostly homeless people yeah that's what's  really going on once it starts getting uh really cold really well the people that you think are hanging  out there they're going to warm abodes yeah and then they just spend the day up on nice days  and well they spend the day there and then they go you know sleep comfortably somewhere else and  it's just uh the dregs are staying there every night so let's let's uh see if you can figure this  out all right it's time to play occupations that drink the most and here's a question according to 
[02:03:30]  a recent survey what occupation drinks the most oh god  i didn't even reword it you don't have if you say that that's what the top ten is you don't have  to do the question no and the question's exactly the same thing the same thing he stinks  they really are oh that's abominable cbs gave them a shitload of stations yeah they've lost a  lot of them fucking stinks did they yeah they've lost a bunch of them they're not even in uh 
[02:04:00]  los angeles anymore oh isn't that their home market yeah not anymore oh not anymore so that  oh that's gotta suck how many are they on one two three four one two so thirteen yeah it might  not yeah thirteen four eight twelve thirteen how many were they on i mean they were on over 20  i would say over 20 yeah we're losing uh los angeles they lost los angeles they lost new york  obviously that's gotta but they kept charlottesville so never it's never good when you get that call  you're losing oh boy i'm losing this city right thank you uh good news guys john and jeff get their

[02:08:00]  at the front desk and the question was so you're talking about the hotel clerk the one that sits at  the front desk front desk yeah the hotel clerk you know hotel clerk do well he sits i'll be at the  front desk talking the hotel clerk the guy at the front desk it's such an out there answer too all  right let's see if that's the answer no let's see here hmm did it crack the top 10  that is not the answer i have here the bionic eye stinks 
[02:08:30]  this is a goof right it's not a goof hopey  move on to the next track they haven't cracked the top 10 i'm gonna be stubborn i'm playing every  fucking track okay now i know i know what you're doing i know what sam's doing he watches the punch  out yeah and move on to whatever's next but you you won't do that we're gonna suffer through every  fucking one of these tracks you're gonna suffer through every one of these tracks people keep 
[02:09:00]  guessing so you're not enjoying these tracks opie's not enjoying the tracks all right opie is suffering  through these tracks now he's going to suffer through all of them all of the tracks opie's  going to suffer through every every track people keep guessing john and jeff keep stretched uh  stretching yeah sorry stretching well we're talking about the tracks and how opie's going to suffer  through all of them he sees insisted that he's going to suffer through every track everyone if you 
[02:09:30]  think opie's suffering through the tracks call up the show uh because opie said that he's going to  be suffering through every track which track is the worst though for opie well opie's got the game  list of tracks in front of him that he's going to be suffering through now we have two possibilities  let me scan what was travis's favorite track by the way was that yesterday or today uh travis 
[02:10:00]  liked the sad romantic one he hasn't heard any of the one that he really liked was the we're doing  this for travis because i was openly admitted this is his favorite day of the year when we feature  john's up yeah here we go trace is next hello trace trace hey guys hey trace hey i uh if i could  i wanted to take a stab at the uh top occupation for drink and i'll tell you why i'm going to choose  what i'm choosing because here recently they had the top list of smokers and the number one in that 
[02:10:30]  position was uh construction workers oh and typically smoking and a lot of times drinking go hand in  hand yeah i was going to pick construction workers or the top occupation for drinkers all right  construction workers let me check the top 10 here construction workers is number six on the countdown so  that is not answer i have here why does he get the same he gets the same you're not asking for the 
[02:11:00]  number one answer you're just asking for one that's on the list that guy got the same buzzer that the  guy got for not even getting one on the list holy shit at least do the dump it properly marmalade color  dye inserter yes got the same respect this construction worker yeah it should be like a  yes that's on the list but uh it's not number one but yes it's on the list it's your game you're 
[02:11:30]  looking for the top 10 fucking people that drink the most you didn't you not once did you say you're  looking for the number one answer because then you get at least 10 guesses to fill the list but  if someone gets number one you could be over in three because otherwise you would have to acknowledge  all the other ones and then go to the calls for number one so now this takes a little more time  huge you like ants you hit the bell ding ding ding yes that's on the list but it's not the number one  still looking for number one but no it's the wrong and you're wrong that is on the list it's your game 
[02:12:00]  it says top 10 occupations that drink the most let's take your calls i'm gonna say rapist  well ready for this the game's going so well at this extremely basic game that people do in high  school radio it's a game jeff reads part of the top 10 part in big letters why because it's not the  whole list uh jeff reads part of the top 10 list and takes a really really really long 
[02:12:30]  oh my god why wouldn't they can you do that in in uh really really really long  you even get the part in  i love slow motion  that's how i live my life yes i talk slow right i'm going to the store 
[02:13:00]  chip is good  chip that was perfect good  you want me to crack the top 10 yeah all right here we go i've got the top 10 occupations that  drink the most according to a recent uh survey number 10 damn it we sanitation engineers  garbage men well if you were picking up everyone else's garbage i think you'd want to have a few  shots too take the edge off after a day of uh collecting all the garbage so uh number 10 what 
[02:13:30]  the sanitation engineers their show number nine i agree i agree with this one totally i thought it  would be higher on the countdown child molester who travels number nine advertising executives  oh yeah of course i forgot sales people right sales people drink the most i think yeah it's only  number nine so i was i was really surprised i mean i've never met a salesperson holy 
[02:14:00]  i don't think i could walk around manhattan all day i don't think i would find one person that was  really surprised at that fact hey i would give them the list and and beg to find one person that  would be surprised by that look at number nine and how surprised are you not at all  who doesn't drink all the sales people here at this radio station man they uh they they they  they like to have a good time oh absolutely no why because they have to sell your horse  shit show you dopes and they need to listen to something else at night if they like to have a good 
[02:14:30]  time yeah absolutely they have a good time and they're always the ones buying you know expense  accounts number eight top ten occupations that drink the most number eight carnival workers  carnival workers of course that's why that explains the bad dental that yeah that's why you don't go on  the zipper you know the carnival comes to town the rides have been put together in six hours and then 
[02:15:00]  the guy has to operate the ride with the he's got a hint of bourbon and bo and you're right missing  the teeth and he's saying hey come on my ride trust me no i'm not gonna trust you look at you  that's good number seven good stuff top ten occupations that drink the most good stuff  hey this is come on my ride trust me come on my ride trust me i've never had that happen uh  growing up going to carnival and the guy pulls out his pick and comes on his ride 
[02:15:30]  come on trust me i am a carnival worker holy trust me to come on my ride come on my ride  they're only at seven i can't i can't believe this have you noticed is it just me or does it seem  like between each number they're re-establishing the list the whole list i was wondering what is their tsl  a minute eight seconds well the average listener tunes in for one minute so reset every one minute  number one with goldfish yeah occupations that drink the most musicians of course i said that 
[02:16:00]  and sometimes that's the only compensation they get is free drinks yeah and number six  construction workers wait so uh coming up we'll crack the top five but we're still looking for the  number one occupation that drinks the most according to a recent survey by the way idiot you also said  lawyer was on the list so we know already we know so go and of course your answer which was attorney 
[02:16:30]  except he was surprised twice when he said so he's gonna be surprised for the third time when he says  attorney watch that is on the list i didn't listen to these tracks but i bet you there's gonna be a  surprise when attorneys mentioned for the third time oh fuck dude fuck well the problem is that we  still don't know what the number one occupation we don't people that drink is or is that what this  list is what's the question the question is the occupation where people drink the most the game is 
[02:17:00]  what occupation do people drink the most oh okay so it's different i understand  wait explain that again well game we're playing a game where uh we find out which occupation do people  drink the most at okay so we're asking the question yes which is the occupation where people drink the  most at this is fucking horrendous you're still smiling though dude i'm so tired this is just so  draining their show 
[02:17:30]  it is draining people probably go to sleep with it i wonder if that's why they part of their method  they probably pay them nothing is that they know people are going to sleep to this old people listen to  it and they want to be comforting yeah but they say they're after like people who work during this  time like in a factory whatever turn it on or driving around so they're just putting people to sleep  while they're driving on a highway yeah i know they've caught how many auto accidents do you suppose  john and jeff have caused yeah let's have the top 10 uh paralysis cases due to their program fatal 
[02:18:00]  accidents caused by john and jeff how many forklifts full of oranges have been dropped on  this one this one this one really bothers me why is that i can't imagine anyone that would listen to  this no yeah i mean there are people calling in saying i'd really like to take a stab at that trivia  question but who are those people i don't know they're friends uh another uh yeah okay another  caller oh has a guest let's go to san francisco and talk to nick of course you're next on the john and 
[02:18:30]  jeff show hey nick in between first things nick hey how you doing call um i'm good how are you  excellent what do you want to talk about um i want i want to make a guest on that profession  what the fuck do you think he wants to talk about oh you fucking asshole you as a radio host has to  you have to move things along so you go all right nick you have an answer to you know top yeah yeah 
[02:19:00]  fucking come on move move go go talk talk talk well this is like a perfect topic you don't let the guy  you don't let the caller lally this lully gag lully gag this topic should be on like a  a quick radio show like fast pace like oh let's go to nick nick what do you think lawyers nope not  on the list nick that that and then hit a song yeah and then hopefully have some jokes in there  of course talk with people a little bit at that profession that that drinks the most okay i got the  top ten we know occupations that drink the most excuse me what is the number one occupation 
[02:19:30]  um my guess is uh the regular eight to five office workers office workers all right  that's not an occupation terrible fucking they're working harder than ever that's right  what what is that not editorializing the answer i have here why would you just say nick you're  stupid that's not an occupation eight to five doesn't exist it's nine to five dumb no expression  asshole i wouldn't sales people that they just talked about and advertising people those are office 
[02:20:00]  workers technically and they work from nine to five no eight to five oh hey you're right eight to  five the people who worked in regular 7 15 to a 609 people stupid asshole i'm so mad and i'm not  this is not a joke i i want to look up flights to la for the weekend why what would you do i want to  just yell at them in person you could you should go and treat them the way you would treat your former  self get on the plane i don't want to be violent i just want to fucking yell at them because this is 
[02:20:30]  ridiculous can we call them get on a plane and just punch them in the face yeah just beat them with lead  pipes is there a phone number i mean we could but they're i gotta yell at these guys they're on  overnights they're in bed they're third shifters yeah we get here at six that means three o'clock  they're still on yeah so let's try to call them well i think that it's no they're not they're  third shifters our time because remember when we were on k-rock they used to lead into the ona show  um good news time to read the list of course jeff has to recap oh no how many fucking recaps

[02:38:00]  doing there because i don't know your relationship with her i just knew it was obviously uncomfortable  right um and something was wrong and she wasn't going to give you anything anyway so to try a joke  knowing the person right next to you who who she actually laughed from the notary thing because  that was an old yeah she knew that already how long had you been how long have you been in radio  with okay i'm gonna give you guys the whole history here i'm gonna so i recap your life i'm  gonna recap my life in two minutes basically i grew up in long island where i where i still live

[02:42:00]  explain it get the hell out of here i'll explain it from the start i always was a little fat i like  went up and down my whole life but then but then my mother got sick and died and it was during that  That I just freaking ate.  I didn't fucking gain 200 pounds.  I ate.  Opie, I'm not proud of it.  You ate what, your mom?  Everything.  Jesus, come on.  I'm not proud.  I'm alive. 
[02:42:30]  What am I going to do?  It happened.  So you got a little, you gained some weight.  A lot.  It was ugly.  And I wouldn't get on the scale.  It was terrible.  So you gained weight.  Because I didn't have a scale big enough to accommodate me.  Hey.  You got on.  I was like.  How dare you.  No, listen.  I got a body like my mutter.  Did you.  We'll go serious for a moment.  Sure.  So you started gaining weight after your mom's death?  I started gaining weight while she was sick.  Unexpected, obviously. 
[02:43:00]  Because I have listened to your show.  She had pancreatic cancer.  Jesus Christ.  It was fast.  It was like a nine month.  Jesus.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Damn.  Sorry to hear that.  It's all right.  It's not even a joke you can make about that.  You can.  I ain't joking about it.  Listen.  You know what the joke is?  My sister and I, years and years and years ago, when we talked to my parents and talked  to my mother about when they would be old and infirmed, my sister was like, I'm never  changing a diaper.  Jenny will be changing diapers.  I'm not doing it.  I'm out.  Cut to then.  All of a sudden, my mother's sick.  And there's a fucking diaper. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, shit.  And who changes the diaper?  You?  Me.  No wonder you got fun.  My sister hightails it out of the hospital.  You think that would cut down on your appetite?  I guess not, huh?  It didn't.  Chocolate covered pretzels still were pretty damn good.  Holy shit.  My mother needed a diaper and I just pushed her face in it and showed her what she did.  Of course she did.  You hit her on the nose of the rolled up newspaper and they never do it again.  Yeah.  But that was just...  No!  On purpose, she did it.  So you started eating because she died?  Well, I just think that it...  I think a lot of times the issue with overeating is that we don't even realize that we're  eating.  It's sort of unconscious. 
[02:44:00]  I'm not the type of person to be like, oh, I didn't eat.  No, no.  I ate.  But I don't think...  It wasn't like I was paying attention and...  Was it more snickety snacks or was it more...  It was just all day long.  It was like whatever...  Like real food.  Do you think it's a disease?  Do I think obesity is a disease?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, I think it's a complicated situation and differs person to person.  Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that one out.  That's what I thought.  That's a political correct answer there?  No, no, no.  I'm being politically correct.  I think it's not as simple as...  Listen, I think my mother also tortured me about my weight my whole life and I... 
[02:44:30]  Oh, she did?  I got thin at 22 and then that freaked me out and then I got thin after she died, so...  Was she a tough mom?  She was tough.  Yeah, she was tough about that and not really anything else, but that was a lot of importance.  What did she want you to be?  She just wanted me to be skinny.  What's that?  And get a good man?  Well, she...  Yeah, and I think that...  Oh, she never saw you skinny?  That's kind of sad.  She didn't see me...  Yeah.  When did you hit the gypsy woman with your car?  She... 
[02:45:00]  She...  My mother was really kooky and really beautiful and horribly insecure and so I think...  Hotsy Totsy.  I love Hotsy Totsy.  I used to love Hotsy Totsy back in the day.  She was sexy the weird way she was.  I can't believe you're saying I look retarded.  I mean, I know what's wrong with me, but...  Hotsy Totsy doesn't look retarded.  She was cute back then and then welcome back to her days.  A little bit retarded looking.  How is that retarded?  No, I mean, if she...  There's a little bit of downs in her eyes.  No, and Hotsy Totsy had her mouth closed.  She looked good.  Wait, wait.  Go up.  You don't see the bum teeth as much.  Go up a little bit.  Downs-y. 
[02:45:30]  And right...  All the way to the right.  All the way to the right.  Down.  TV Guide cover.  Let's see TV Guide cover.  See?  Let me see.  See?  No, that ain't it.  See?  Oh, jeez.  Don't you hate sightseeing?  You click on the picture and...  I think it's because her eyes are very spread apart.  Are they?  Mine are not.  Mine are a little too close.  Let me see Hotsy Totsy.  I can't see.  Oh, that's her from the match game or something?  Look at that.  That's kind of sexy.  Kind of sultry.  She just has...  She's got a sultry look.  Yeah, she has like a young Mick Jagger.  Pouty lips.  Yeah.  Yeah, big head of 70s hair. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I always had 70s hair.  Yeah, she has like a perfectly symmetrical face.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Perfectly symmetrical.  And she wasn't ever fat.  You guys got to hear about her sweet 16 party.  Oh, yeah?  You had a big sweet 16 party?  I did, but...  She's blown off her dad.  Her dad was a massive...  But it was all a surprise.  Radio...  Not radio.  ...music guy.  Yeah.  For who?  And he had a massive daughter.  Everyone?  There we go now.  But at 16, I was skinny.  Were you?  Wait a minute.  Really?  Yes.  Oh.  Pictures?  Yeah, there's actually video. 
[02:46:30]  We're the inspiration for heavy D.  There's video on YouTube from my sweet 16.  All right, punch that up.  Let's see this lavish sweet 16.  Hey, what did you get for your 16th birthday?  16th birthday.  Let me think.  Thank you, you rock.  I believe I got a bus ticket back to New York from L.A.  I think I got a 10-speed bike, if I remember correctly.  Oh, that's pretty nice.  That's nice.  So I guess I shouldn't tell you guys that at 17, I got a Mercedes, right?  No.  Oh, really?  I hated people like you.  I love the Jews that get German cars.  Is that you?  That's me.  Ew.  Oh, yeah.  Nah. 
[02:47:00]  How dare you?  Wait, wait, wait.  Start it over.  Cute.  Yeah, she's just like.  No, she's frightening.  Did you live in a mansion?  Yes.  I'm sad.  I just want to thank you so much for my party.  Ew.  I'm really excited.  Is that your house in the background?  And I'm mostly excited because all my friends are here.  Are you kidding me?  Right.  Wait, let me ask you.  Why are we feeling sorry for you?  Were you upset because.  Just stay on a treadmill.  You're fine.  Well, how come you.  I do stay on a treadmill.  You think if you go up with cash, it means that everything's always perfect, don't you?  Look at this.  Did your stepdad get you a pony and then you ran to him?  I'm not a stepdad. 
[02:47:30]  But your real dad got you like a little Susie Bake Oven.  There was no fun.  Did the maid climb on the roof, put a noose around her neck and say she was doing this  for you?  Damien.  It was pretty funny.  That house is fucking exquisite.  Did the dog knock your mom off the balcony?  Yeah.  What?  It's a big house.  That's a nice house.  How many rooms did you get?  How many rooms did I get?  My room.  That was it?  Yeah.  I would take over a bunch of them.  I bet your room was huge.  Yeah, it was a nice room.  Yeah.  Did all your friends always want to come over your house? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, my friends lived in my house.  That's Muttentown.  That's the Muttentown shit.  Or Old Westbury.  Old Westbury?  Yeah, it's Old Westbury.  Yeah, that's Old Money also.  That is an old school mansion.  It's an old house.  That's an estate.  Yeah.  That's an estate.  One of those North Shore estates.  Oh yeah, write it down.  I can do that.  Oh, well, okay.  Well, okay.  Let me see.  I see why you don't want to say anything.  No, it is.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's close.  Yep.  It is.  Jiminy Cricket.  Yep.  Do you have a house like that now? 
[02:48:30]  I don't, but I do live next door to that house.  Well, the house next door to me.  I do.  Yeah?  I do.  Yeah.  And my sister does as well.  You have to look at that wonderful house that you used to live in from your house?  Yes.  Is your house nice now?  Wait, so you're-  Yes, but not like that.  So the land, you guys had so much land that you just built houses around the original house?  We bought property.  Jesus.  Oh, I know that.  That's right.  This bitch is fucking rich.  I know that.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  It was fun.  Are you worth a few mil? 
[02:49:00]  No.  Me, myself?  No.  Mm-mm.  No.  Mm-hmm.  But I work hard.  I like to work.  I want to hear the video from you.  I like it that if you grow up privileged, then you can have a work ethic.  No.  I think you have a work ethic.  I do.  I said that.  It's very important to me.  I think Alexis didn't have a work ethic, but you said I was wrong about that.  Yeah.  She liked to work.  I think she just lost interest in the whole thing.  I think she lost interest in it.  She liked being a bitch.  We'll get into that, hopefully.  All right.  Whatever you want.  All right.  Here's the Sweet 16 video.  Oh.  Thank you so much for my party. 
[02:49:30]  I'm really excited, and I'm mostly excited because all my friends are here, and everyone's  going to be here.  There's two people there.  And it should be great, I'm hoping, and I left it in your hands and didn't know anything  about it.  It's one big surprise.  Are you acting?  And that's great.  No, it was true.  My parents always did stuff like that.  You know?  My wedding too.  Thank you.  Stacey, you're incredible for living with me for 16 years and not murdering me.  And Brian.  My brother.  You two, the same thing.  Listen, I was just there. 
[02:50:00]  I used to sound like that.  Grandma, Grandpa, of course.  How could I forget you guys?  She sounds like her nose.  It's all plumb.  Wait, it gets even worse.  Hi again.  I had mono at the time.  How you doing?  You look like a young Bette Midler.  Now I look like an old Bette Midler.  What year did you get the rhinoplasty?  I never had my nose done.  Pause.  Look at it.  All right.  Turn sideways.  Same nose.  I'm just thinking from the front it doesn't look right.  You got it scraped slightly.  I swear to God. 
[02:50:30]  It looks wider on here from the front.  First of all, I got laminates on my teeth so that I didn't have to get my nose done because  my mother said that my nose was too angular.  So you were going to chew your own nose off?  No, my mother thought because my...  Listen.  All right.  My mother thought that because my nose was like turned down like a Jewish nose because  I'm a Jewish kid that I needed to round my teeth so she made my teeth bigger.  Wow.  What a nut.  So I made that.  There's no sense.  It's kooky.  So kooky.  Let's make everything else bigger and our nose will look smaller. 
[02:51:00]  Something like that.  Pretty much.  Big fucking Mardi Gras float head.  And I have a little head.  That's also wrong with me.  I have a teeny tiny head.  You do?  So it's not good when you're fat.  I don't know.  But you're petite.  No, you're petite.  Well, now I am.  Everything's in proportion.  Speaking of that.  Yeah.  Do you like...  Oh.  There she...  Will you like that?  Dude!  No!  No, I was not.  Did you think what I was thinking?  What?  Jimmy comes back in studio.  I thought he was going to drag her in.  And he's smiling like, look what I just got accomplished.  And we see Precious walking.  I'm like, holy shit, Jimmy got Precious to say hi. 
[02:51:30]  And she walked right by the studio.  Oh, you know why I didn't think of it?  Because they were talking to her.  I talked to her for a second.  She's got to get to the Empire State Building.  And who is bigger, you or Precious?  But look at the light behind me.  Oh, wow.  I was not...  I was not...  I was...  Whatever.  How much are you weighing now?  I don't give my weight, but I hadn't hit 200 pounds, thank God.  Oh, no?  You never hit two bills?  Not at that.  Let's see.  Hold on.  I've got to see the picture.  Look at the bright light behind me. 
[02:52:00]  The light behind us, too.  Oh, my God.  She's got the complexion of a Hershey bar.  That's nice.  Oh, no.  No, it's shiny.  It's nice.  She's very...  She smelled very good.  She's got nice skin.  She smelled good?  Like what?  She smelled like cream.  Fucking...  Parfume?  Barbecue?  She was actually thinner than I expected her to be.  What?  Thinner?  Than I expected her to be.  You might want to get your eyes done.  Than you expected her to be.  I do want to one day get my eyes done, Opie.  You're going to get your eyes done?  Eventually.  Why?  Because they're wrinkled.  I look like a Sharpie.  You're going to have your eyes done?  Don't do that.  You do that Botox shit?  I do.  I do Botox on my forehead.  So your forehead doesn't move. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  I enjoy the paralysis.  I don't like that Botox shit, man.  You get Botox done?  I do.  But that's it.  Where?  I do my forehead.  Try to crinkle it.  I can't.  It's paralyzed.  Let me say.  Do you like, ew, it is.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's fucked up.  I know, right?  I didn't mean ew in a bad way there.  I don't care.  This is weird.  You could say ew.  But don't do this shit with the Botox.  I'm not.  Because then you smile.  Then you smile weird.  Yeah.  Then you really look like you might have down.  Where's your smile?  It's nice.  Oi. 
[02:53:00]  Oi.  There she goes.  Oi.  Well, so.  Comes out.  Right?  Comes out.  So we were watching your video here.  It gets worse.  Whiny Long Island.  I did, but I was.  Stuffed nose accent.  But she's being very.  She's being.  She's not being bratty.  No, I wasn't bratty.  No, she's being very magnanimous.  Yes.  And I got to tell you.  Don't be confused.  We like you.  Thanks.  This is how we show our love.  This is just.  Totsy Totsy.  I like you guys.  I crack up.  You guys need to know that when yesterday you guys were making fun of my boobs and everything  else about me.  Who said that?  The two of you.  It didn't matter. 
[02:53:30]  I didn't mind it.  I liked it.  There's stuff in my hair and my boobs, my cleats, whatever.  So on Twitter, everyone's going crazy.  And I'm listening and I'm laughing because I think it's also funny.  It's good stuff.  Nice to have you.  You know, Jewish girls do have nice boobs.  They usually do, right?  They usually do.  That's what I'm talking about.  What do you think that's about, Ant?  Just talking about, I don't know.  It's, I don't know.  Because.  What is that?  We don't nurse our babies.  I'm just kidding.  Hence all the problems you got.  Oh, boy.  No, that's just too much inbreeding. 
[02:54:00]  See, it's better.  I think it's good at this point to mix the genes.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  You get healthier stock that way.  How long have you been doing radio?  That's why I look so beautiful.  Six years.  Six years this week.  What?  You want to do radio six years?  Radio six years.  You're good at it.  Thank you.  I really love it.  I don't know why.  And you guys were talking earlier this morning about Scott Shannon.  So years ago, I used to call into all the PLJ radio shows.  You did.  Uh-huh, such a loser.  At 16, I used to call into, I think, the Showgram and into A.J. 
[02:54:30]  Showgram and into A.J. Hammer.  And at one point.  Oh, A.J. Hammer.  Fuck, man.  And then there was something I did, a sounder for someone.  I was like, it's hip.  It's happening.  It's like totally rad.  And they used that over and over again.  And I thought it was cool.  Uh-huh.  On the air.  Loser.  What would you do?  What would you call into Scott Shannon?  Oh, anything I could.  Just for fun.  Was he nice to you?  Did you do voices?  I tried to, but I wasn't any good at that.  And what a coincidence.  And now both your faces are paralyzed.  It's cool.  There you go.  Well, the Botox. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, I know.  Well, the Botox.  Just don't go below the eyes.  No.  I'm fine.  I don't do anything else.  Don't do that.  I don't know why the women do that.  Listen, I started doing Botox.  Listen.  Listen.  I had Botox and I can talk about it.  We'll allow you to shave down the Juno's a little bit.  Oh, wow.  Listen.  Don't fill the lid.  Here's the problem with the shaving down of the Juno's.  Yeah.  It ultimately doesn't work out because it starts to just, it can, it changes your face completely.  Yeah, it does.  And then as you age, I think, it gets weirder and weirder.  Yeah.  Or can. 
[02:55:30]  I don't know why that's happening.  You need all that meat in there for like, as you get older.  I need the hook to hold it up.  Your face feeds off of your nose meat as you get older, I think.  Nose meat?  And if it's not there, your nose kind of just dries up.  By the way.  What is nose meat?  That's that stuff they remove when you get a nose job.  The cartilage?  Your nose meat.  Her nose isn't bad, which means she's not.  No, no.  She definitely had a nose job.  She obviously doesn't want to talk about it.  I swear to God, I didn't have a nose.  That's what I think.  Yeah, because look at the video we're looking at.  You guys are idiots.  Look at my nose.  We know that.  She has a little nose.  No, you don't have a hooked nose.  It's a small Jewish nose. 
[02:56:00]  It just wasn't big.  It's a Jewish nose.  It's a little nose.  It's the same nose I've always had.  It's the type of nose I want to grab and go, aw.  You could do that.  I don't care.  Honk.  I'm okay with that.  Let's see the rest of the Sweet 16 video.  Oh, brother.  Oh, hold on.  You're here like Jeff Conaway.  Leslie, Allison, Kim, Liz, Anna, and Sarah.  I'm still friends with like three of those people.  Every single other person here.  Oh, and Alyssa, you're not here, but you're going to be watching the tape.  So hi to you two.  Hold on.  Pause for a minute.  Where was Alyssa?  Alyssa was a friend of mine. 
[02:56:30]  And you were probably.  Huh?  On a yacht.  No, no, no.  She was at another person's Sweet 16.  Why couldn't she make yours?  And our daughters are friends now.  Isn't that funny?  Why didn't she make yours?  Because we were newly friends, and she'd been friends with the other girl longer, and she  had to go to her Sweet 16.  Okay, but you think she really watched the tape, though?  She did watch the tape, and years later, we laugh about it, that I say hi to Alyssa.  It's so bizarre.  Okay.  I ended the video saying goodnight to her.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to say hello to all my friends.  Pretty much.  Sarah.  Yeah.  Anna and Sarah were identical twins. 
[02:57:00]  Cuomo.  Hold on.  Hotsy.  Hotsy.  Anne Frank.  Listen, boys, do you want to know why I have to have Botox?  Why?  Because I'm a chronic worrier.  You know the death in the family?  No, but I've always...  You got worry lines in your head?  Yes, at all times, and I don't want them.  Like this?  Yes, Anne.  I got them.  I want them.  But what if somebody tries to surprise you, and you just sit there?  Oh, they can't do it anyway.  I'm too sleuthy.  You're too sleuthy?  Yeah.  I don't get surprised.  Don't be anti-xamatic.  That's weird, because you're also a toothy.  She's toothy and sleuthy. 
[02:57:30]  I am toothy.  I told you that.  You sleuthy toothy.  They're big and white teeth.  They're big and white.  It's all right, Jim.  You can shave the teeth down, too.  I know, but it costs a lot of money to do that.  You got money.  Your teeth are fine.  It costs like 30, 40 grand to do teeth.  Dad's retired?  Shit.  No, my dad works.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's not real work.  No, no, it's real work.  It's like rich people work.  No, no, God, no.  My father?  Of course, he's digging ditches.  No, my...  That's real people work.  Yeah, see?  That's real work.  He does a ton of different things. 
[02:58:00]  Does he play golf?  He does.  He doesn't work.  It's like Bernie Madoff?  He works.  No, not now.  What's his handicap?  I don't know.  His daughter?  There he is.  He's got two.  Oh, okay.  Two daughters and a son.  All right.  My brother is a screenwriter, and my sister is a mom.  Oh.  And that's it.  What does your brother write?  I'm a stay-at-home man.  Brian wrote Rounders.  Okay.  Really?  Oh, a little movie called Rounders.  I love that movie.  And he wrote and directed Solitary Man with Michael Douglas this past year, and he's doing 
[02:58:30]  the game, Neil Strauss' game.  We should be talking to him.  You should.  What the hell are you doing in here?  My brother happens to be the coolest guy.  I mean, well, this was a big difference.  Neil Strauss' game was a very good book.  He's a good interview, too.  He was a weird interview, but I needed help meeting a girl when I was in L.A., and my manager  who was friends with him couldn't get a hold of him, but I interviewed him anyway.  I was kind of annoyed.  He was in.  Yeah.  Yeah, we liked Neil.  Yeah, but his book was great.  You guys want to see the rest of the video?  Does it get to some of the Sweet Sixteen party, hopefully? 
[02:59:00]  No, it doesn't.  It's just you yapping like this?  Someone sent it to me after I'd been on the radio a while.  Someone sent me this clip, and so I posted it.  What else is in the clip?  Is it worth playing?  Just that I'm so affected.  It's nauseating.  Oh, you are nice.  Let's see more.  I was nice, but affected.  And, well, Vicky, and everyone, thank you for coming.  Oh, please.  And I hope you all had a good time.  Well, now have a good time.  See, this makes me sad, because it makes me nostalgic.  For what?  I can't believe it's here.  I don't know, being a kid.  I'm excited.  Oh, it wasn't so funny.  Hi.  Oh, there we go.  This is my sister, Stacey. 
[02:59:30]  Stacey's high.  Stacey is high.  Stacey.  Fuck, if Stacey's high.  She's smoking high.  Uh-huh.  She's smoking high.  Stacey's wearing a little low-cut number.  She was always sexy.  My sister.  I love her.  You guys might have different fathers.  We have the same dad.  Oh, isn't that sweet?  Yeah.  Look at Stacey.  Rich and fucking bitch in front of a castle.  Stacey looks a little bit like Kate Gosling.  No, she has nothing like Kate Gosling.  Yeah, she does now.  She does.  That's a compliment.  Kate looks very sexy now.  I just saw Kate yesterday.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind plowing her. 
[03:00:00]  Stacey has bigger boobs.  She does.  Stacey has great tits.  My sister has the best boobs.  All right, so your brother can come in and tell us about movies, and your sister can  show us her tits.  Yeah.  No, she's not going to.  She's cool.  Look at this fucking house.  It's a big house.  It's crazy.  She's a record executive.  Yes.  That's crazy.  She's a record executive.  That's right.  Man.  Damn it.  Mm-hmm.  Who did he work?  Barbara Streis and Barry Manilow.  She ever walked through that door?  Yeah, for a while.  Babs ever come through that door?  Yes. 
[03:00:30]  People thought it was her house.  You know, Barry Manilow, by the way, had a dog, a beagle named Bagel.  Oh.  Barry Manilow performed at my sister's wedding.  What?  There you go.  I hate people like you.  I really do.  What?  Should I not have said it?  I'll never get past that.  I hate people like getting things handed to him like this.  By the way, it's not even good.  Who has Barry Manilow play at their wedding?  Her sister?  Yeah, my sister did.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Why are you working?  Because I love to work, because I have drive, and I need to feel good about myself, and it's  important to work. 
[03:01:00]  You don't feel good just because your father has money.  You want your own things.  Are you kidding me?  So what did he sing?  Constantly needs to sing.  Mandy!  No, Can't Smile Without You.  That's a good thing.  He only did one song?  No, I think he did a medley, but that was her wedding song.  A medley?  Yeah.  Wait, do the songs, you fucking cheapo.  Wait, her wedding song was Barry Manilow, Ashley's.  Yeah.  Can't Smile Without You.  Yeah.  I know, right?  Oh.  It was fun.  I want some band they threw together at the last minute.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Fuck.  But at my C16, so what you guys are trying to get to with my C16 was that Run DMC performed 
[03:01:30]  and the Beastie Boys.  And my father threw out the Beastie Boys because they were throwing beer and stuff all over  the guests.  They're crazy.  They were crazy.  Did you get pictures with them?  I'm not sure.  I'm sure maybe somewhere.  How much does Run DMC and the Beastie Boys cost?  Oh no, it was back in 1986.  I know.  It was probably big then because they were huge.  Run DMC was massive in 86.  But Run, he remembers because I saw him here one day and he came on the radio show and he  was like, it wasn't often that I was told to go, I was hired to go to a C16 in Long Island. 
[03:02:00]  Wow.  Anyway, who ran first?  The Beastie Boys and then Run DMC?  Yeah, Beastie Boys.  They got thrown out and then Run DMC.  But the Beastie Boys did perform.  Yeah, but then they got stopped mid-performance and then were out.  Were you mad they got stopped?  No, I didn't care because it was right before Fight for Your Right to Party became a huge  hit.  Oh, for License to Ill.  I was really a Run DMC fan.  Yeah, Run DMC, which album?  You Talk Too Much.  I wrapped my Sweet 16 video. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, my Sweet 16 invitation.  Oh, wait a minute.  Can we see that?  I have it.  God.  You talk too much.  I know, I have it.  Girl, you never shut up.  Shut up.  You talk too much.  Homeboy, you never shut up a big blabbermouth.  Oh, God, please don't.  That's what you are.  I like the raps.  You're a talk show host.  Did you only date rich guys?  No.  In high school?  Uh-uh.  Where was your high school?  What?  Hey, kids over there.  You know it's about the time. 
[03:03:00]  And if you don't know what I mean, then it's sure a crime.  A crime.  Boo!  Wow.  Sensational, right?  I wrote that in algebra class.  God, your dad was wishing you were going to be the next Barbra Streisand.  No, he was not.  He was actually anti that, which is pretty much the whole thing.  So I wanted to sing and I wanted to act.  I wanted to do that as a kid.  And then my parents really didn't want me to do any of it because it's a horrible business.  And then I still wound up here.  It's not a horrible business if you have rich parents.  Well, it wasn't like that.  How bad could it be? 
[03:03:30]  It's not a great business.  Do you know Barbra Streisand?  I do.  See, Opie, we should show the video and have her say if that's Barbra or not.  She probably would know.  I don't think it is.  What is it from?  It's her.  I ran into Barbra Streisand.  Opie thinks he didn't run into Barbra Streisand.  I swear to God, I'm not going to play along.  I don't think it is.  It is her.  But Jimmy thinks it is.  I know it's her.  I haven't seen her recently, but let me see.  If you knew or if you grew up with her, if you went down on her, you would understand  if it's her.  If I got Barbra Streisand in this...  I'm sorry, what?  Roland, just our luck.  I think Barbra Streisand is standing right over there waiting for a city bus. 
[03:04:00]  She was waiting for a city bus, too.  Then that's not her.  Well, that's...  She wasn't waiting for a bus.  This would be a really big video if it was her.  Are you Barbra Streisand?  No, I'm not.  That looks like her.  That's her.  Roland, Barbra Streisand.  Can we go back?  We should be showing there.  Can I just...  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's here.  It's not her.  It's absolutely her.  That's her.  I mean, it looks like her.  She would never dress like that.  She's trying to... 
[03:04:30]  It just would never be what she'd wear.  She's meeting somebody in public.  She's dressing down, wearing a big hat.  That's not how she dressed down.  She does not want to be recognized.  What street was this?  That's on, like, Upper West Side.  She doesn't want to be recognized.  It's absolutely her.  Upper West Side.  That's where I live.  I'm guaranteeing...  She wouldn't take the bus.  She wouldn't take the bus.  Hold on a minute.  Now, show from the other side when she walks away.  It's absolutely her.  I don't...  What she's wearing concerns me.  No.  She's trying to dress down. 
[03:05:00]  That's what she goes out in so no one recognizes her.  Let's see.  Play and then pause again, Sam, when she turns her profile over.  Are you Barbra Streisand?  No, I don't...  Is her face that...  That's her.  The hat could be hers.  I don't know.  I'm telling you, that's absolutely her.  It's just a coat.  I can't see her wearing that.  That's exactly why she's wearing it.  It's freezing out and she doesn't want to be recognized.  All right.  She's probably going to meet someone for coffee or a bagel.  Right.  Or perhaps whatever else people do.  Put a schmutz of something on something. 
[03:05:30]  A schmier?  A schmier.  A schmier of schmutz.  A schmier of schmutz.  Are we officially promoting your book?  Yeah, we're trying to.  What is it?  It's called Whateverland.  And what is it about?  Your life?  Yeah, it's basically a self-help, non-self-help book.  It's just about my life and Alexis' life and lessons we've learned and lessons to...  And how people make themselves feel better.  Does it do well?  It's selling.  I mean, not well enough, but I'd like to continue to sell some more.  Let me ask you, how long...  You guys were radio partners and how long did you...  Five and a half years.  Well, could you get to when you met Alexis?  Okay, I'll give you the whole Alexis stuff because it's really not... 
[03:06:00]  Everyone's looking for some dramatic turn of events that didn't happen.  So basically...  Goddamn rich cunt.  I met...  Thank you.  Not you.  Thank you for that.  Not you, it's Alexis.  Oh, oh.  Goddamn rich cunt.  There you go.  I kill rich cunt.  Oh, my.  Okay.  Did we just get an oh, my?  Why does the word cunt work?  I love the oh, my.  I've only added that word to my vocabulary very recently.  I used to not like saying that word.  What?  Cunt?  I didn't like saying it.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It should be on cards. 
[03:06:30]  I don't say it a lot.  You should say it more.  Stupid cunt.  I like that word.  Okay.  Anyway.  It's hot when it's written on a forehead.  That is fine.  Very hot.  Right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  All right, so you meet Alexis.  Okay, so Alexis and I met...  Alexis.  I was my father.  Goddamn rich cunt.  We're selling a lot of books, trust me.  This is our style.  I hope your listeners will buy some books. 
[03:07:00]  Why do you have to live next to your dad's mansion?  Well, first of all, I have a very...  We're like a close family.  But you can be close by living in the next town over.  I lived in New York City for years, and then when I had my kids, I wanted to move closer  to home.  How many rooms does your house have?  I don't know.  I don't count them.  I mean, like four bedrooms, five bedrooms.  Yeah, if you don't know how many rooms...  Who counts the rooms in their house?  I do.  People that have four...  One bedroom.  She doesn't mean two rooms.  Count them.  She easily has a mini mansion.  Yeah, you probably...  People who don't have...  Yeah, I have a lot.  Yes, yeah.  People who don't have a lot of rooms, count them. 
[03:07:30]  Yes, I have a mic.  Because they go, go in that room.  Get away from me.  Go in that room.  So they know how many they have.  But it's not really done.  It's...  I think we're, like, probably...  I don't care.  I think we're, like, neighbors.  We are.  I think we're, like, really...  Aunt.  Neighbor-neighbors.  We're neighbors.  I told you that.  Yeah, yeah.  Aunt, I told you I would set up your whole life for you.  Why?  And I asked you if you had food one day out there after your all-night party thing.  Jesus Christ.  And you were like, there's some frozen steaks or something.  And I'm like, dude, I have, like, seven people who will deliver right to you.  Really?  And, like, the best bread in the whole world. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, but you're not rich.  And everything in our town.  I've got people that do that.  I know, but I can hook you up.  She has a lot of money.  It's not about the money.  I just have lived there my whole life.  I'm Italian.  I don't know how to live like a Jewish person in that neighborhood.  Well, but I do, and that's a fun way to live.  I'll fucking take free food.  No, no, he has to purchase his food.  I could just make it really convenient for him.  All right, so, no, you meet Alexis as Martha Stewart's daughter.  Right, so I'm assisting my father.  I go to work as my father's secretary.  This is six years ago.  As Martha Stewart's daughter, she's probably got a lot of cash. 
[03:08:30]  I mean, I don't know.  She lives well, but...  I don't know how...  The family does, though.  Yeah, but Martha was not wealthy when she was a kid.  Martha only became wealthy when Alexis was in her 20s.  God damn rich country.  That's for the mother this time.  Oh, brother.  That is gracious.  So you're working for your dad as a secretary?  I was.  I was a secretary.  It was really fun.  I was an excellent secretary. 
[03:09:00]  I was good.  Secretary?  Yeah, I worked hard.  Left it.  I did.  Anyways, I meet Alexis, and that was when the Martha channel was being launched.  But how did you meet Alexis?  I was doing a radio show with her.  How did you meet Alexis?  She just walked in your dad's office?  She walked down the hall, and I was there, and it was like, hey, and hey, and it took a  while for her to really respond, because I'm a little more outgoing than Alexis was.  And she wished she wouldn't even answer you, right?  But then, not initially, but then we just kind of hit it off, because, though very different,  both of us didn't have big edit buttons, and that's not a euphemism for anything else, 
[03:09:30]  and both of us weren't dopey.  So there you go.  So you hit it off?  Yes.  How could you hit it off with someone like her?  Because I pretty much like getting along with everyone.  But she's like an ice queen.  You would agree, right?  Well, she's just not.  She's just, listen, she's just not, she's not warm, and she's not, she's not a Jew from  Long Island.  She's not.  Goddamn rich country. 
[03:10:00]  We've lost Jimmy a bit.  It happens.  Jimmy will not be back with us for at least 10 minutes.  Oh, some of your Twitter followers want me to go to Afghanistan and be beheaded.  These fucking people.  That means they love you.  Don't be confused.  That's how they show their love.  Don't be confused.  I'm all right with it.  Be beheaded.  They love you.  It's all right.  I think she's nice people.  I'm cool with it.  It's fine. 
[03:10:30]  So wait, you met Alexis.  She's not, she was not particularly warm.  No, never was, but listen, we were very different, and we launched this radio show that was so  cool because neither one of us knew what we were doing.  What made you say, let's do a radio show together when you met her and you realized she was kind  of cold?  She asked me to do it.  She was going to have a show, and she was going to call it whatever, and she was going  to do it at midnight, and then instead she asked if I'd do it with her, and then it was 
[03:11:00]  at noon.  That was pretty much it.  That was a great name for a show.  And so there you go.  And that was six years ago.  Wow.  But cut to now, really, everyone's looking for some big, dramatic reason why we stopped  working together, and the fact is, can I just take that everywhere I go from now on?  I just have that on a thing.  I just press a button.  Sorry. 
[03:11:30]  It's all right.  It's important.  It's important.  No, it isn't important.  It's stupid.  It's stupid that anyone even cares.  I'm dying to know.  I think it's bullshit that you guys were friends for six years, because I did listen  to you two.  For about a year.  And it seemed like you guys were friends off the air.  Right.  So we were for a long time.  You used to make your little videos together and stuff, and you had something going on.  Yes.  And then out of nowhere, she blows you off.  Yes.  That's a twatty move.  That's bad.  Why do you think she did that?  Why do you think she did that?  I think that, I think that, I'm not sure.  I think she was just done with everything, and that included me. 
[03:12:00]  I think that was how she, I think she was done doing the radio show.  I think she was over it, and I think she was bored by it, and bored by me.  But wait, no.  That's a goddamn rich cunt.  Well, we saw you guys on the Today Show.  She doesn't like, she doesn't like you.  Something happened.  Yeah, she absolutely doesn't like you.  But nothing happened.  There wasn't a fight.  So if something happened, it's her thing.  I know.  That's her treadmill videos.  That's one of my treadmill videos.  So that's why my treadmill was broken.  Could you tell on the, when did you guys start realizing you didn't like each other anymore?  So you're, hold on, you're running in place? 
[03:12:30]  I am.  I'm running in place, dancing, I'm singing.  I thought I was desperate to make a video.  Oh, no.  Listen.  For the fucking treadmill to be fixed.  I'm going to tell you that I have to work out a lot, and making videos, and the fact  that anybody's willing to watch them gets me to work out more.  But how about you don't run in place for this one?  That one I did run in place.  People liked it.  Cleavage is holding up, by the way.  It's just whatever.  It's just boobs.  You can't just say whatever to boobs.  I can.  How come I'm a girl?  I mean, I've never been in a girl's. 
[03:13:00]  I don't get the whole, like, boob thing.  No?  Here, and then my kids, my arms.  Here, all my flaws are.  I have my arms are okay.  Okay, except there's, like, a little that could be a little tighter.  Wow.  Just shoot that up with some Botox.  You can't shoot your arms up with Botox.  Paralyze your arms.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  Walking around with your arms just sticking straight out.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, Anthony would love you.  I do.  Start doing some tricep exercises.  I do them.  I do tricep exercises.  I do.  It's not bad.  You beat yourself up.  I don't get that about you.  What do you mean?  You make it easy for us.  It's okay.  It's true to fall. 
[03:13:30]  You don't have any flab under here.  Listen, I'm 41 years old.  I think you have a lot lower self-esteem than you should.  I totally have low self-esteem.  It's from being fatty.  Thankfully, I'm married.  It is.  How long have you been married?  I would probably be a whore if I wasn't married.  I'm with my husband 16 years.  Would you be a whore?  Yeah.  Today, I would be.  That's a shame.  But I probably really wouldn't.  It's like, because I never was.  No, you probably would be, though.  Really?  Yeah, you'd probably start really getting to the point where it's like, ah, my self-esteem.  He better, what does he keep it?  He's so cute.  Is he always like, oh, you're beautiful, sweetie. 
[03:14:00]  What?  No.  No?  I mean, he likes me most of the time.  But how does he keep your self-esteem up that you don't go out?  He tells me I'm beautiful.  He loves me.  I mean, he loves me.  He lets me be me.  Do you give up where the, you know, the poo comes out?  No, I don't.  I'm not into that.  Oh, God.  My tishy is off limits for that.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Not interested.  Would.  I'm not.  But I like sex.  Will you take a finger there?  I don't want a finger there.  I don't want anything in my ass.  I don't want anything in my ass.  Not even a tongue?  I just don't want things in my ass.  How about a finger swiping?  Not interested. 
[03:14:30]  I like my ass to be left alone.  That specific portion of my ass.  The Jewish people are used to giving other people the shit in the ass, right?  No.  Yes.  That's what we know.  Just go down to the Wall Street man, the bankers man.  All right.  Thanks.  So Alexis just blew you off.  Yes.  God, she's a twat.  Listen, it's okay.  At what point?  Hold on.  It's not okay.  That's why you're here today.  Stop with this shit.  Here's why it's okay.  The only part that was not okay was that I had.  The only part that was not okay was that my concern about my radio show, which is still  a concern because I'm on Martha's channel and I hope I'll get to stay there and I just 
[03:15:00]  don't know.  I love doing my show.  Oh, that's why you can't trash her because she could easily have your job.  Of course.  Well, the point is, the fact is she's a twat for blowing you off for no reason.  When did she...  You can see it on the Today Show.  She doesn't like you.  Listen...  She wouldn't even look at you.  Why wasn't she pleasant to you?  Let me ask you.  Yeah.  Opias is a good point because if you just get bored of each other, relationships fall apart.  But there was obviously an aggressive dislike by that.  In the back of that book, she talks about the fact that in the back of Whateverland... 
[03:15:30]  Can I have it?  Sure.  Okay.  Whateverland?  So, Whateverland.  Yes.  Okay?  Basically, I think I'm annoying to her.  And by the way, I'm annoying to most.  God damn it's a cunt.  There you go.  And so...  There you go.  I don't like the fact that you're taking the blame all yourself.  I don't think there's anything wrong with me.  I think that she has a very low tolerance for people of my disposition.  Which is what?  And I have an unbelievably high tolerance for most people. 
[03:16:00]  So do you all?  I just don't care.  I take the good.  I leave the rest.  What else matters?  We're all alive.  Like, people are fun.  But weren't you resentful of the fact that all of a sudden you were doing this radio show  and she's getting bored?  Is that in Whateverland?  Well, it was a tougher time to do...  It was harder to do the show, Jim.  Wait, what did she say, Jimmy?  Because I wanted to be doing a great show and I felt like it was a little compromised because  I knew that she didn't want to be there anymore.  I don't care.  Oh, I love Kevin Meany.  By the way...  I just don't go over.  I don't care.  He performed at my sister's 21st birthday.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you. 
[03:16:30]  Of course he did.  So wait, you're doing this radio show.  Do you know that she's bored?  It is a drama.  When do you start to realize?  How do you start to realize?  Because I would start to tell a story and then she just wouldn't respond to it.  Maybe it's you.  But again...  Yes, for her it was me.  She would leave you hanging?  Yes.  For her it was authentically me.  That's...  But that's not you.  That's her own...  I think because she's an only child.  She seems to me like probably a spoiled brat.  Yeah.  That's my opinion of her.  Here we go.  Who's not that interesting.  I love getting rid of friends.  This is from Whateverland. 
[03:17:00]  Okay?  Okay.  I love getting rid of friends.  It's so much fun.  Because usually there's a reason I'm getting rid of them.  Like they've done something nasty, which means they're going to do something nasty again.  Or they're annoying.  Which means...  Goddamn rich cunt!  Which means they're just going to be annoying again.  Or they're chronically late.  Late to the point where every time you meet them, they're 45 minutes to an hour late.  Oh boy.  That just means they're not good friends because they can't show up.  Functionality is very important.  It sure is.  That's...  That's...  Again, that sounds like a control freak.  He always says I should try to work things out, explain to people that what they do bothers 
[03:17:30]  me or hurts my feelings, but I don't do that.  No, I say, you know what?  That's it.  We're done.  You're late again.  And then I'm done with them.  Done.  Finished.  Can we read the whole thing?  Holy shit.  Because by that time, I'm so angry, I don't want to be around them anymore.  What are you?  John and Jeff?  I'm just explaining that it wasn't like there was a time matter.  Better explain it, fool.  But when did you sense...  I sensed it for about...  I would say for probably a year before she left the show.  Okay.  She's a fucking brat.  That's not what I'm not.  I'm saying it.  You don't say it.  I'm saying it.  Jim Norton's saying it.  Don't blow up her show, because that means we're going to not deal with her every fucking  day.  I think that she's a fucking brat whose mommy has a channel, and that's why she's on the 
[03:18:00]  radio.  I hope you deal with me.  I love you, people.  Is there an extra book?  No, you can have it.  Oh, cool.  Take it.  My fridge is rocking back and forth.  You can then pull it apart and rip it and tear it.  I don't care.  By the way, leaving it here, I fully expect you to go through it, rip things out, make fun of  it, go for it.  You look pretty glamorous in the...  Yeah, let me tell you this.  And she doesn't look bad.  I want to see the pictures.  She looks good.  No, I really do.  I really do.  I mean, that's...  So, does Alexis have friends in general?  No, but that's her choice. 
[03:18:30]  What a jerk.  I don't know that makes her jerk, but that's how she wants to just live.  She sucks.  She sucks.  I'm saying she sucks.  Yeah.  At least you have a personality and you can express yourself.  She's just a fucking spoiled nothing.  Oh, please, but I cry a lot.  I mean, I'm like a typical girl.  I know, but you're also...  You're also...  You've also had to deal with her and your whole thing, instead of just being outward and venting  on her.  Oh, really?  Just to blame yourself.  And she didn't have money growing up?  That's a pretty solid fucking house.  Turkey Hill, whatever the fuck that is.  She had money. 
[03:19:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  And she's too used to people giving her access because of who her mother is.  Nobody gives you access because of your yoga, stupid.  It's because of your mother and her Tanner Boyle haircut.  I'm saying that.  Jennifer's left the room.  I'm saying that.  And Alexis was married, right?  Yeah, she's divorced.  I know.  Oh, wow.  Of course she is.  I hope he cheated on her.  That's what I hope.  Oh, damn.  I don't know what happened to Jimmy.  She's still friends with him.  Oh, okay.  I know who it is.  Oh, you do?  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Oh.  What kind of work does he do?  Long Island guy, right?  No, I don't...  Yes.  Maybe he was from Long Island.  Ron Conkoma?  I don't know.  Ron Conkoma?  I just like saying Ron Conkoma because Colin Quinn loves Ron Conkoma.  Possibly the Huntington area.  Oh, yeah?  Let's just see if there's more...  Huntington, like Huntington Bay?  Uh-huh.  Nice area.  Nice area.  No, no, no.  No, that's...  No, no.  Let's just see some more.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Oh, here we go.  Jennifer Hutt.  Like, she's Jabba's daughter.  Does the name Ted mean anything to you? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, shit.  Wait, there's more.  Of course it does.  It's hard dragging a dead body.  What are you doing?  I'm reading the tweets that are mean.  I actually know some things.  What?  Oh, yeah.  I do.  Do you?  Yes.  Don't read the tweets.  How much longer are you under contract for with them?  How much longer?  Not much longer.  Less than a year?  Yeah, I think like now.  I think like now.  Do you have an agent?  So this is a good time to trash her on our show.  I do.  I mean, yeah.  Yeah, wow.  You're really...  Are you going to do negotiations? 
[03:20:30]  I don't know what time...  My hope is that either I'll stay on Martha Channel and that Sirius XM will put me somewhere  else.  I mean, that's just...  I love my shows.  You're absolutely good enough to continue.  You get along with Lily well?  Love her.  Okay.  She's great.  She's great.  She works hard.  She's interested in being here.  The fans need to realize this is not a Jocktober segment.  There's no reason to attack Jenny Hutt's Facebook page.  Oh, no.  They're not.  That's awesome.  Yay.  That means I truly love you.  Why is Jared Loeffner's picture there? 
[03:21:00]  I saw you bruised by that.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God damn, which cut.  Oh, man.  Yes, look.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Right there.  That's written there many times.  He shot that congressman, Gabby Diaz.  Oh, please.  And there are children who look at this.  Oh, no.  Remember when you were gangbang by Run DMC?  This is horrific.  Gangbang.  Stacey has great tits.  Thank you.  Stacey has no E in her name.  Oh, goodness gracious.  A rare topless photo of Jennifer.  What are we going to do now?  Two fried eggs.  People are ruthless, man. 
[03:21:30]  By the way.  As long as it ups my numbers, go for it.  Botox, more like lightbulb.  By the way, your husband looks like he would kick our ass.  My husband's a big dude.  Oh, yeah?  Jenny had her largest, and it's a photo of a cow.  It's a cow.  You'd like my husband.  He's a poor guy.  Oh, no.  There's a really big, fat person there.  What a big, fat person.  Oh, no.  Good man.  I definitely want to thank Frederica Bimble for stopping in today.  This hurts.  Oh, God.  This really hurts my feelings. 
[03:22:00]  Maybe they're buying Hudaholics t-shirts.  I don't know.  That's a fan of yours who is a fan of mine, isn't he?  Remember that time you were thrown in the well with the little dog?  I do.  I do.  Yeah.  It was cute.  Yeah.  You mean in Silence of the Lambs?  Oh, yeah.  That's who.  Yeah.  It was the governor's daughter, someone said.  No, she was a congressman, I thought.  Oh, no.  Yes.  So the political, who knows.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  No.  Oh, no.  That's disgusting.  Two women kissing with cum all over their face. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, this is terrible.  This is painful.  You're really going to have to sort through these and maybe delete a few postings.  Oh, no.  There's at least two or three postings you may have to delete.  Oh, golly.  Oh, golly.  Oh, Chip just is asking, what's this, some kind of goddamn rich cunt or something?  Oh.  I'll be all right.  Yeah.  You'll be fine.  Yeah.  You were raised very wealthy and well-to-do, and you had things a lot of the children didn't  have, and now later in life, you're paying through this abuse. 
[03:23:00]  That's okay.  Oh, goodness gracious.  Oh, no.  That's a man train.  It's an all-board man train, and it's a daisy chain.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's daisy chains of digs going into asses, but it's been photoshopped, so there's a picture  of Troy.  Yes.  One of the guys.  Troy.  The last guy getting a dick in the ass is E-Rock, and then there's me saying, that's  hot.  That's hot.  That's hot.  Wow.  I wouldn't want to be taking that train.  No.  How old, Donny? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, God.  Help me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Giant vagina.  I can't even look at that.  Nobody wants to see a monster.  You're a damn rich cunt.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh, I can't even look.  This is disgusting.  She's very nice.  Hulk Hogan knocking down the towers.  Oh, that's trap.  Oh, prolapsed asshole.  You want to see that?  No, I think I might vomit.  It's not horrible.  You guys, this is disgusting.  This is not Jocktober.  Why did you do this?  Why did you do this?  Oh, golly.  The listeners don't understand.  I'm sorry.  I got to apologize.  It's okay. 
[03:24:00]  No, they got to do what they got to do.  You met Gorbachev.  I did.  I did meet Gorbachev.  You did?  Really?  I did.  Why?  Because he was something my dad was honored for.  He was honored for.  You don't talk about your dad, I noticed.  Huh?  You don't talk about him.  I talk about my dad all the time.  I love my dad.  You're very vague.  What record company?  I'm not vague.  My father had a bunch of record labels.  He had a company first called The Entertainment Company.  Then he had SBK Records that he founded.  And then he ran EMI for several years.  Did Gorby say, I should tear down those teeth? 
[03:24:30]  He did.  He said, let me tear down your teeth.  It was awkward.  Yeah, he said that.  Yeah, that's terrible.  What bands did your dad be friends with?  Well, I mean.  That Bobo's dick.  I have to recall one of his early ones with Love and Spoonfall.  Dolly Parton.  I already said Barbara.  Lionel Richie.  Do you know Dolly Parton?  I did.  Dancing on the Ceiling, Lionel Richie?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that was back when he was huge.  Yeah, yeah.  My father, yeah.  Did you ever see the big, giant clay head from the video? 
[03:25:00]  No, not in person.  You ever see, you know that one, Hello?  You mean from Hello?  Yeah, yeah.  He's at me all looking for.  And the blind girl makes that big, giant head that looked nothing like him?  Yes.  You ever see that?  Not in person, but I saw the video.  God damn it.  Yeah.  I think I'm obsessed with that.  Big, dumb clay head.  You could get one made, Ant.  Nah.  Yeah.  That's a one-of-a-kind by a blind girl.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, it's Bobo's dick.  Just make me look at these things.  I don't want to see.  What's that picture right above?  Ante, by the way, if she liked us, she would get that clay head for us.  I do like you guys, but I can't get that clay head.  Who knows where it is?  He knows where it is.  Maybe it's in the Smithsonian. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, God.  What is that?  Disgusting.  That's the channel next to us.  I don't know why they did this to you.  I don't know.  You know why they did this to me?  There's no reason for that.  Oh, my goodness.  Is that you at your birthday party?  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Yes, that was me in my birthday party.  Yes, that's me.  Yes, that's me.  That's right.  Thank you.  It's all fun and games when there's a former fat girl in the room.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all right.  I can take it. 
[03:26:00]  Well, you're honest.  Yeah, well, kind of can't not be.  You're holding back with the Alexis stuff because you don't want to lose your job.  I'm really not holding back.  Well, first of all, I don't want to lose my job, O.B.  That'll be part two.  Because there wasn't a fight.  You probably hate her.  You hate what she did to you.  Listen, I have said this.  I've said this before.  I'm pathetic enough that I would still be friends with her because it's just who I am.  I'm not proud of the fact that she's around.  But what did you do that annoyed her so much?  Everything about me.  Everything about me.  I'm friends with everybody that I know my whole life.  Did you listen to Last Hour? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, boy.  Exactly, Opie.  I know.  It's okay.  I think Jennifer's a sweet girl.  She's really nice.  She's fun.  She's perky and peppy.  She's got a nice personality.  And you can see that she has that really rotten little...  She has probably a rotten temper when she's allowed to let it...  Who?  Jennifer?  That's pretty hot.  Who put on the hottest internet picture ever?  I know.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that is so disgusting.  I know.  Holy mother of God.  I can't decide which girl is luckier.  That is not okay.  Why?  They look too young.  Why?  Oh, yeah.  That's the problem.  Look, I don't have a problem with the jism all over their faces.  I just have a problem with their age. 
[03:27:00]  You don't have a problem with the jism?  You have a problem with the age.  It's just the age.  It's crazy.  Someone posted a picture of George and Robbie.  Did your dad have a connection to the Beatles at any point?  No, uh-uh.  Were there solo careers?  No.  Did he run Puddin' Head records?  No.  But he's had a pretty extensive music business career.  How do we sell this book for you?  Oh, puppy and a duck.  I don't know.  Just ask your people to purchase it.  Whatever land.  Puppies.  Whatever land it's called.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you've got a grandma that's still living, pick up whatever land. 
[03:27:30]  By the way, wives, girlfriends, teenage daughters, they're all going to like it.  It's a fun read.  I'm going to buy whatever land for Jess.  Are you?  I'm going to purchase it.  You think Jess will like it?  Yes.  I know she will.  It's a fun book.  It happens to be.  It's good.  Do you think that, honestly, I know you don't know this, but do you think that Alexis has  a large vagina?  Oh my God.  What?  No.  What?  Jimmy loves large vaginas.  Like a wide set giant box?  No, just plump.  Just plump.  A wide set giant box.  Because she's skinny with a yoga body and they usually have great vaginas. 
[03:28:00]  I'm sure she has a lovely vagina.  She's very aesthetically pleasing.  Think she shaves it?  She's very clean and well put together.  Let me see what she...  All right.  Finally.  Oh my God, I got it.  Finally.  I can't do it.  It's the gentleman jerking off using diarrhea as lubricant.  What do I do?  It's your Facebook page.  We have nothing to do with this.  What do I do?  If you want this stuff on your Facebook page, so be it.  This is embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  Hey, look at that fine gentleman wearing a t-shirt.  You guys help me.  It looks like a swastika.  That is a swastika. 
[03:28:30]  No, it's...  Ask Jennifer.  She's a Jew.  Too little...  If she's insulted by your logo.  Two nubs are knocked off of it.  Who's that guy?  Somebody found a picture of my uncle.  That's your uncle?  That's my uncle.  Somebody found a picture of your uncle.  I have no idea.  That's hilarious.  I don't know.  Look at my picture.  It's very creepy.  Goodness gracious.  That could be the funniest thing ever.  And you got your uncle's eyebrows, I see.  Yeah, that's my uncle.  Sure he is.  Holy...  How did they find that?  I don't know.  You're crying.  Where does this come from? 
[03:29:00]  It's horrible.  So, whatever land, learning to live here, Alexis Stewart, and Jennifer Huppelman-Hutt.  I'm Jennifer Hutt on Twitter.  Anthony won't follow me.  I follow him.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  You won't follow me back.  You're obsessed with Anthony.  Oh, I'll have to do that.  You want to take care of him, don't you?  I like him.  I do.  I'm a Jewish society.  I'm a good guy.  Yeah, I know.  You're going to be very nurturing and maternal.  Do I follow you?  We're just neighbors, yes.  Is that you?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That is not...  Is that a problem, Opie? 
[03:29:30]  Do you like Lemon Party?  No, God, I don't.  I don't like that.  Look at how much younger the black guy is.  Wait, let's ask her.  Jennifer, this is a question that's been bothering us forever.  Who's the luckiest guy in that photo?  That's Lemon Party, the three older gentlemen.  The real question is...  Honestly, who's the luckiest one in that picture?  No, no.  The real question is...  It's either Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, or Buzz Aldrin.  I say the one laying on his back, because he gets to kiss the guy and get his dick sucked. 
[03:30:00]  Now, who's the gayest in that picture?  Or who's the least gay, I think we usually ask?  The gayest is the one sucking the cock.  No, wrong.  The guy kissing and gently playing with the nipple.  The caressing.  The guy sucking dick is just doing it to get a gay.  Well, you decided a long time ago, kissing is way gayer than actually sucking the penis.  That's for queers.  Kissing.  Yeah, the kissing is like...  Sucking dick is what your friends do.  So making out is more intimate than a blowjob?  Yeah.  Who wants to fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  If you talk to guys, and you talk about like porno, gay porno, the fucking part of it 
[03:30:30]  is just like bad and fucking...  It's when they start getting like all kissy face and like stroking the cheek.  That means there's actual...  That means there's actual love at all.  Oh.  Black girl naked.  There's black girl naked if you...  Oh my goodness.  What the hell is that?  Oh my gosh.  Oh no.  There's a new photo of Jenny.  I have a nice body there.  That's okay.  Now I understand why Ronnie B doesn't like you.  Now I totally get it.  Stop it.  It's not even subtle.  Huh?  I love Ronnie B.  This one's not even subtle.  There's a photo of...  Your face is full in that picture. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, it was fat.  But on top of it, it says in big white letters, God damn rich cunt.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all right.  They made that up nice.  I can work with that.  It's a good logo.  It's okay.  Oh my goodness.  It's a kid with elephantitis legs or something.  That's not good at all.  That's sad.  This is fun in here.  Is it?  It's like a party, yeah.  It is a blast.  Yeah.  My buddy Joe Curry's here too.  Oh.  Joey!  I gotta ask.  You know, obviously Joe, you know what it's like to be bumped and stuff.  Hi.  But Joe's got a band and gigs and stuff.  And I was just wondering if the wonderful Sam Roberts doing the after show... 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  ...would like to have Joe Curry perhaps sit as a guest for a moment and maybe play one of his tunes?  It would be my pleasure.  Oh, sure, sure.  You having an album release?  Yeah.  Well, we're doing a play.  We're opening for Ace Frehley on Sunday over at Mulcahy's out in Center Reach.  That's fucking cool.  Yeah.  That's a good gig.  Yeah.  We're opening up...  That's pretty amazing.  I'm going to come out to that because I'm fucking interviewing him.  When will we have him?  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  That's cool.  So it's Mulcahy's...  Yeah.  Mulcahy's out in Center Reach.  When?  It's going to be this Sunday, 7 o'clock show.  That's fucking cool.  Sunday, 7 o'clock. 
[03:32:00]  7 o'clock.  Yeah, that's good.  And you guys got a frigging album together.  Yeah.  Who's in the band?  Well, we got Johnny Rock and Roll Race is in the band.  Johnny Race.  Rock and Roll.  Mike McClinton.  It's his band.  And we got a really good bunch of guys.  We're going to be putting out an album.  He actually got signed, so we're going to be doing an album.  Yeah.  And then he got a tour.  Wait, he got signed?  Yeah, we got signed.  Yeah.  So talk to Jennifer's father.  Yeah, wouldn't mind.  Yeah, yeah.  Talk to that father. 
[03:32:30]  That's cool, man.  And then as luck would have it, I'll be in Baltimore next week doing stand-up at Sully's Comedy Club.  Still got to pay the bills.  Still got to pay the bills.  The dreams don't happen that easy.  Sully's Comedy Club in Baltimore.  That'll be 8 o'clock Friday, 8 o'clock Saturday.  Cool, man.  And check it out down there.  Yeah, hang out for the after show, as I like to call the shit show.  See, after opening Anthony Live.  And that way I'll be able to listen as I'm driving home and listen to the track off of Foots' album. 
[03:33:00]  Aren't you also, I heard you guys, November 3rd, 4th, and 5th, were appearing at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Someone's there.  I am.  Jimmy Norder.  I am.  November 11th, 12th, I'm at the Brookridge Comedy Club.  And Jennifer, when's the show on, man?  At 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  How many hours do you do?  Eastern on 110, 2.  Fuck.  I know.  I'd do more.  You'd do four.  I would do more if I was asked to do it.  Listen, I like to work, so happy to, whenever. 
[03:33:30]  We'll give you one of our hours.  I'm happy to take it.  What channel, though?  110.  Like Route 110?  Yeah.  Up there on Long Island.  That's right.  Bring it home, Anthony.  Right.  Bring it right home.  Do you get 110 on both?  I keep it local.  If you have the premium, but there's some sort of pal talk room if you don't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to see fucking H-Freely in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to be a good day.  He's great live, man.  Fuck me, man.  What was the best Christmas present you ever got?  Christmas?  Well, Hanukkah. 
[03:34:00]  Hanukkah.  Oh, yeah.  Hanukkah.  Oh, yeah.  Hanukkah.  I think I got a...  I got a...  Hanukkah.  That's how a party will all dance a horror.  Gather around the table, we'll give you a drink.  Spinning tufts and dribbles with good things to eat.  While we are playing, the candles are burning bright.  One for a giant day, shed a sweet light.  Okay, anyway.  Can you sing a hover?  It's time at my house.  Sing the Jave song.  I don't know if there's a little Hava.  Hava, Nagila, Hava, Nagila.  What's that mean?  I'm not a super Jew, you guys.  What does Hava, Nagila, Hava mean?  I don't know. 
[03:34:30]  I don't know.  Were they asking you if someone owned a Nagila Hava?  I don't know.  It's like if someone wants a Nagila...  That's racist.  Don't be racist.  What am I going to do about this?  Hey, look at that guy's asshole.  It's open.  My mother's was like that while the guy was on top of a smoke in Newports.  What am I going to do about that?  And he would stretch it open.  I would look in there.  This is not pleasant.  That's what Jay Moore says.  What are we going to do about that?  What was the best Hanukkah present?  Yeah, what was it?  I got a Keith Haring print at one point.  Like a sign something. 
[03:35:00]  Right.  Who's Keith Haring?  I was like...  He sounds sishy.  It's too good for children.  That's good.  Keith Haring is an artist, Jimmy.  I'm telling you, the best rich girl story that I could possibly tell is when I got in  a car.  People would die for a Keith Haring.  That's my best story.  You got your car.  A what?  A nice German Mercedes, right?  The best rich girl story that I have is when I was 18 and my dad took my sister, my brother  and I all for cars in the same day.  It was a surprise.  That was fun.  Cool story, bro.  Cool story, bro.  I don't know what I'm going to do about this. 
[03:35:30]  I'm supposed to have a modicum of professional something or other.  It doesn't matter.  You're going to find a band.  Nobody's going to want to sponsor me.  What do I do?  You're going to have to take your site offline for a little while.  Now, why?  Do you think watery diarrhea pouring from a woman's asshole or a man?  Can I just delete them?  I've made the mistake.  That's the array of gay. 
[03:36:00]  That's the array of gay.  We're all representing that one.  What am I doing in that one?  I like a puppy.  Could somebody post on Jennifer's Facebook page that I have an amazing gig announcement  on Monday?  Oh.  A very good gig announcement.  Really?  Yes.  First show, yeah.  First stand-up show.  Very excited.  That is exciting.  On Monday, I'll tell you.  Not until Monday?  Can't do it until Monday.  Could you give us a hint?  Do you want me to put it on my Facebook page?  Somebody could do that.  Just say, I have a gig coming up. 
[03:36:30]  I'm going to plug on Monday.  Yeah.  Could somebody just emit the jizz, the doody?  Can you just plug that Jim has a gig?  Look at the little kittens in a cup.  I got a plug, too.  I'll be on GBTV today.  I don't know how or where it is, but I'll be there.  Amazing gig announcement by Jim Norton next Monday.  They already got it.  Just Jenny on.  Yes.  All right.  Jennifer, you survived.  Thank you.  No, thank you for having me on the show.  Yeah, that wasn't bad, right?  I wanted to be here.  This is fun.  We didn't say one bad thing about you.  By the way, you can say...  Goddamn rich cunt. 
[03:37:00]  That'll be Monday's show.  You guys have a lot to talk about.  Oh, well.  I was enjoying it.  I bet you wouldn't even remember you were here.  Right.  Yeah.  Anyway, you both have awesome voices.  That's just yourself.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, maybe I'll see you in the neighborhood paying the fucking landscapers or something.  I asked you if you went to a certain grocery store.  You said no, but they'll deliver to you.  I've asked if there's...  I don't go to that one.  Are you going to do breast implants?  I like walled breasts.  Breast implants.  No. 
[03:37:30]  Are you going to change the color of your hair?  I'm not going blonde anytime soon.  I've been blonde in my life.  Lighten it up a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Really?  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, no.  You look too much like my old sister.  There I am.  Jabba the Hutt.  Thank you so much.  Do you have big nipples, Jennifer?  No, I have normal nipples, thankfully.  I don't like giant.  Are the nipples starting...  That's where we part company.  No, they're okay.  And they get hard.  They start to look like gravy stains?  You're good.  They're okay.  I like an obscenely large nipple.  Oh, I don't have that.  Obscenely large.  Really?  I don't like that.  It carries around to the shoulder blade. 
[03:38:00]  I want it to look like fucking Charlotte Nash's hand.  Jimmy likes when it looks like a baby's...  A baby's...  Oh, fuck it.  How long will this go on for?  I got a little eye on the show.  I had a baby bottle.  I'm joking.  I'm not going to shut it down.  Whatever.  I think it would be...  Thanks.  ...like two red yarmulkes on your tits.  It's not.  It'd be like big nipples.  Do you just want me to show you?  Kidding.  I would love to see.  No, I would never.  I would love to.  I'm a mom.  We were excited for...  I'm like married with kids. 
[03:38:30]  I love how she didn't even wait for the answer knowing the answer would have been a no.  Yeah.  Oh.  I would love to see.  Yeah, yeah.  I would hold them.  No.  Would you hold them?  Yeah.  Nicely.  She's very...  I think she's sexy.  All right.  You're going to hang out for the shit show?  I was going to say, you're welcome to come on after Open Anthony Live.  I'm here until I have a thing at 11, so great.  Look at this big areola in that fucking girl.  Look at how hot.  That's not great.  Sam, go back up to you.  You're queer?  I know.  What's Sam doing?  I'm the same.  Oh, no.  That's disgusting.  What do you say about that? 
[03:39:00]  That's fucking...  It looks like there's clay on her.  That's not so queer.  That's not right.  Why would I want that?  You guys are fucking Peter Pompers.  I love that.  Why would you love that?  That's a little rough.  Those big fucking...  Oh, they're hot, man.  Big is fine.  Those look like...  Those are udders.  It was like clay.  Something was clay.  Big, juicy, dark areolas.  Oh, look.  It's a penis sandwich.  That's right.  You know, that's actually a penis, I think, in shit.  Oh, wow.  Look at that head getting crushed.  Oh, God damn.  He smokes by a truck tire.  Oh, you don't like that?  Make sure you don't put any fucking graphic violence pictures on. 
[03:39:30]  Ant doesn't like it.  Yeah.  Those nipples fucking rule, dude.  Can we go home now?  Yes, you know.  Yeah.  Dark areolas.  Who the fuck doesn't like that?  Oh, no.  That's not...  I mean, why post that?  It's not flattering.  Jennifer, you're all right, man.  Thanks.  Thank you.  You're kind of sexy.  Oh, there she is.  I think she's very sexy.  How many fats do you think you got left in you?  Scarface Anthony.  That's a good one.  No more fats.  How many fats do you got left in you?  I hope none.  I do everything I can to not get fat.  Yeah?  I'm crazy.  Yeah.  Well, we know you're crazy, but... 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, no, I'm sick.  Crazy like a fox or something.  Oh, that's good.  It would be so horribly embarrassing for me to ever be fat again, and it's...  Listen, I don't...  I know how easy it would be, so I'm constantly trying to not eat too much, and I exercise  a lot.  Great stuff.  I'll do that.  What are you going to do?  Tell your story.  Walk it.  We're out of here.  Right out the door?  Is that what you're saying, Colby?  Anyway, thank you, you guys.  I've had it.  It's Jennifer Hutt on Twitter with two N's, I think, because there's a fraud out there.  There is a fraud.  I would say...  It's Jennifer Hutt with two N's and two T's. 
[03:40:30]  I plug her Facebook page, but the fans have found it, so there's no reason to.  Thank you so much for that.  Don't forget, her book is called Whatever Land, and it's definitely worth buying.  I'm enjoying it.  Yep.  You guys are awesome.  For real.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  I've never heard that as a question before.  I know.  Sometimes you put things in the form of a question.  Go back down.  What is that picture of the leg?  No, there, there.  What is that?  Open that.  Oh, wow.  Ooh.  Look at that leg missing. 
[03:41:00]  What's wrong with that?  Look at that.  Dan, did you see that?  Oh, God damn it.  Oh.  All right, we'll see you guys Monday for the conclusion of Jocktober.  Yeah, buddy.  Oh, we didn't get to that, did we?  I don't know.  No, we did Jocktober.  I meant the last John and Jeff clip.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, we did.  Wait a minute.  Oh, a lot of people might have missed it.  If you missed it, just listen to the replay.  You'll hear what the number one answer was.  Yeah, hopefully they don't cut it out of the replay.  People need to know what number one answer was.  Oh, I know what it was.  Yeah?  All right, we're just babbling now, obviously. 
[03:41:30]  Have a good week.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All the hustle and bustle that's going on in here.  Yes, we are, Lily.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  There you go.  The headphones were down.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Everything's going on all at once around me.  What a Friday show.  The Ron and Fez interns are setting up for Ron and Fez. 
[03:42:00]  Sal, the intern, is trying to figure out if Eric's talking to him.  Let me tell you something.  Sal, the intern, he gave me a disc before we went on the air just now.  During what we call in the business the commercial break.  I'm pretty sure people out of the business also call it a commercial break.  That's Lily here.  Sorry.  No, I told you you could come in.  If what's on this disc, if this disc is as advertised, because Sal gave me the hard pitch on this, 
[03:42:30]  then this is going to, I mean, Sal, grab that.  Is this, don't tell what it is, but is this, do you have confidence?  Do you have as much confidence as you did right now when you pitched it to me off the air?  Yeah.  It's all good.  It should be pretty funny.  Because if this is what you say it is, Jocktober is going to end in a major way on Monday.  And this isn't O&A related.  This is related to one of the, all I'm going to say is, it's related to one of the other shows that we did for Jocktober. 
[03:43:00]  Yep.  And by the way, a lot of the shows, the best shows that we did this year will be featured on the best or the worst,  I don't know what they call it anymore.  It's the worst of Jocktober.  Okay, it'll be featured on the worst of Jocktober, which is running all weekend.  And this was the best year that Jocktober's ever had.  And it's all because of you fans.  I can't take any credit.  I can't give credit to Opie, Anthony, Jim.  It's all because of you and the way you took it upon yourself to make Jocktober so interactive.  But Sal, if this is what I think it is, you're going to make Jocktober extra special. 
[03:43:30]  If it's what I think it is.  If it's what you say it is.  I mean, I have full confidence that...  I'm not going to play it on the after show.  That's fine.  If it is as you described, it's good enough that I want to wait until Monday's real show.  Perfect.  Not this nonsense that we do until 11.  You know what I mean?  I wouldn't call it nonsense.  Come on.  I appreciate that.  And you know what?  We shouldn't call it nonsense because this nonsense, or whatever it is, is brought to  you by Trojan Bearscan Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand. 
[03:44:00]  So funny over there, Paul.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Jenny Hutt is still here.  I see.  Now, Jenny, I don't know.  Do you know Jocktober?  Do you know what we do for Jocktober?  Tell me.  Jocktober is something that we've done for the last...  This is the fourth year.  Lily, can you believe that?  The fourth year of Jocktober.  I mean, I remember the first year.  Yeah.  You were there.  Were you there?  Yeah, I was there.  You were there.  Okay.  I didn't think it was going to make it to the second year.  Yeah, well, we're in the fourth year.  I'm so excited about it.  And, Jenny, what we do is we go to different radio... 
[03:44:30]  Good job, Sal.  Good find.  I listen to different radio stations.  Eric potted the mic up so the listeners could hear him being nice to me.  No, I leaned on it by accident.  Your belly hit him by mistake.  That was hurtful.  I shouldn't have said it.  He's very nice.  I know.  Eric is very nice.  We go from...  He's jolly, is what I say.  Oh, my God.  We go from across the country.  I listen to different radio stations at random.  I mean, yeah, pretty much at random. 
[03:45:00]  So they don't know it's coming.  And what I do is just pull clips from the shows, bring them on to Opie and Anthony,  and we spend pretty much every time it was an hour a day unmercifully destroying them.  Oh, no.  Just verbally.  Oh, God.  And heavy emphasis on the women on the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or just...  You know, you coin phrase the hole.  The hole.  It's cool that you do that.  There's actually an article.  We made the Idaho news this year for Jocktober.  One of the local DJs, a female, said that she was left in tears. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, no.  Like, for real tears or tears of joy?  No, she was in Idaho.  Because you got her show now.  She was in Idaho.  Yeah, she's just...  Oh, boy.  She's in Idaho, but she's crying because of the reaction that she's getting from the big city.  Really?  Yeah.  But, Jenny, the reason why I bring this up to you is because what happened this year,  for the first time ever, is without our requests even, the fans took it upon themselves to  start attacking people's Facebook pages.  I didn't notice that.  Yeah, so every...  So every radio show that we did had to take their Facebook page down. 
[03:46:00]  Okay, got it.  Like, the goal of our fans was to get every radio show to close their Facebook page.  That's just super.  And they've been successful.  That's why I tried to explain that you were not brought in.  We did Jocktober today.  Right.  Because we do it every day in the month of Jocktober.  And my being here wasn't part of that.  We did it before you came in.  Got it.  And then you came in, and they figure, well, why end Jocktober now?  You've got overzealous fans, that's all.  They'd love to participate in the show. 
[03:46:30]  Jumped the gun a little bit, I see.  Well, it happens.  Jenny and Lily, you work on Jenny's show now.  You used to work on Ron and Fez.  That's correct.  Then you went upstate for a while.  We went on Ron and Fez.  I worked with Brother Weez.  And you went back downstate for whatever reason.  Yeah.  And, you know, you're still a friend of Ron and Fez.  Absolutely.  But you work on the new whatever show.  Yeah.  New and improved, is what I say.  Yeah.  Jenny, you think...  Go, Lily!  You think this one's better?  I'm having a really good time.  I think everybody there is just happy to be on the show.  So, it's fun. 
[03:47:00]  What did you think coming on this show?  Because I, like...  I was very nervous because of the Twittersphere.  So, I wasn't nervous.  Whenever I've seen Anthony or Opie, they're always nice to me.  I mean, I don't have problems with them or anything.  And I like them and I'm a fan.  So, from listening, I...  Of course, they don't say, when you're not around them and they're on the air, not as nice.  But I've heard them when I'm not around them.  And I've heard them talk about me.  And I think everything they say is funny.  Okay.  I don't know what the big deal is.  So, everyone's like...  Before I was coming on, everyone was like, well, you're going to be in so much trouble. 
[03:47:30]  And they're going to beat you down.  And there's this and that.  And I'm like, well, how can they really beat me down if I already know everything wrong with me?  Right.  I guess they could find some more things wrong with me.  But I'm pretty much, like, aware of my problems.  Your list of what's wrong with you is so long.  Yeah.  How could they add...  Now, you're like the female Sam Roberts because you try to get on every show you can on SiriusXM.  I like to work, Sam.  Whenever a studio leaves their door unlocked and there's a live mic, hey, it's me!  Yeah, I know.  Hey, Sam Roberts here!  We can, you know... 
[03:48:00]  I told you you could come on my show anytime you want.  I'm going to take you up on that offer.  I promise you.  Okay, good.  But how did...  Because, you know, you started with Ron and Fez and then you went around...  I love Ron and Fez and I'm trying to...  I want to get back together with them.  Why did you...  What's the falling out?  There was a miscommunication and it's blown up bigger than it should, I think.  What is the miscommunication?  There was a...  I don't even want to rehash it.  Okay.  It was like...  But I feel terribly because I would never disrespect Ron.  I love him. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  And I hope one day he'll move past it.  That's all I can do, right?  I hope so, too.  Mark Zito, you heard that, right?  Just to be here as a documentarian.  What is...  But you've done...  You did Howard.  Yeah.  You did everything.  Yes.  What is your experience?  Is it a different experience being on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, so much fun.  Let me tell you something.  First of all, I'm a Long Island girl.  Yeah.  So I have seen the stickers all over the cars forever.  The Whip Them Out Wednesday stickers.  Of course. 
[03:49:00]  And my sneaker guy...  Like one day Opie retweeted something I had tweeted.  And the guy in the sneaker store that I've gone to forever...  Yeah.  ...flipped out when he saw me.  Was like, oh my God.  Oh my God.  You know Opie?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  They love us in Long Island.  Live for you guys.  Like I have major street cred where I live.  Joe Curry, you know about this.  Yep.  Major street cred.  At the sneaker store too.  Yeah.  No, no.  I'm at the sneaker store.  He knows.  This is Ira at Sneakerology.  Well now he's going to be super excited.  I know.  Yeah.  But like normally people bring you on to do what they call an interview where it's like 
[03:49:30]  they ask a question and then they stop and then you answer that question.  Whereas here it was more like...  A roast.  Yeah.  They throw a question at you.  It's fun though.  As you answer they play sound effects and call you a fool.  I don't mind.  I come from a lively family.  Did you pick up on the things that...  Because I was picking up...  What the rich cunt, the...  No, I figured you'd be able to tip it like that.  A little under the breath, little cuts, of course. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  No, I thought that the...  That's Jeff Goldblum, by the way, saying...  Goddamn rich cunt.  That's Jeff Goldblum from...  What's that movie?  I'm not sure.  Oh, it's with the...  That's the Jeff Goldblum movie.  I would ask E-Rogg, but there's an empty microwave.  It's on the tip of my...  Death Wish, right?  Right, right, yeah, right.  That's what that's from.  I figured you picked up on that since...  Yeah.  Ant played that, I think, more than once, didn't he?  He played it a few times.  Yeah, I thought so.  I think the count was 14.  14?  You were keeping count. 
[03:50:30]  Joe Curry.  Yeah, I heard that a couple times.  But I meant like Opie was over here just kind of while it was all going on.  Like at one point he called you a fool.  Yeah.  I heard him...  It's all right.  I pointed out to him.  I guffawed it loudly because I thought it was funny, but also because...  That's just such a rude thing to do is to invite somebody to sit in the studio.  I would like to interview you.  And then as they're talking to somebody else...  Call me names.  I didn't mind it.  ...under your breath, you call them a fool.  Yeah, it's okay.  Like a fool is a specifically rude thing, though.  It's not just like, oh, we're just poking fun. 
[03:51:00]  Like he looked at you like you fool.  That's okay.  You know?  Yeah.  I'm all right with it.  I'm not going to cry from that.  I'm glad.  Yeah.  Because you said you're a very sensitive person.  I'm super sensitive.  What would make you cry then?  Because I...  Are we going to try to get me to cry?  No.  Let's think of all the things we can do to make you cry.  Make your Facebook page.  I did.  It was really not good.  You have close comments on your Facebook page.  I did.  Yeah, I had to.  Just because other people go to it.  It's not that...  Well, yeah.  I mean, you try...  That's the whole reason.  And Lily, you could also...  Go to Martha Channel.  Right.  You guys don't do the whole like pink socking. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  Do you know what a pink sock is, Jen?  What's a pink sock?  She's a Jewish girl from Long Island.  You know what a pink sock is?  Sure, I do.  Could you explain to Jenny?  I believe it's having to do with the asshole.  Yeah.  Am I correct?  It's when it's prolapsed.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a prolapsed anus.  Oh, I've heard of that.  It comes out, you know, sort of pink.  And they call it a pink sock.  There were pictures of that on your Facebook page.  There were.  And is that kind of the topics that you get into on whatever?  Not usually.  Okay.  But if someone has a medical condition that results in a prolapsed anus... 
[03:52:00]  We'll call it a pink sock.  Yeah, we'll deal with that.  Do you discuss travel at all?  Well, because all aboard the gay train was on there as well.  I don't know if that...  That was a tough thing to do.  The gay train.  And it was news to me that...  The truth is, out of all those things that were posted on my Facebook page, the poop is  what upsets me the most.  It's gross.  I can work with the jizz.  I can work with the gay sex, the street sex.  You can work with that stuff.  Yeah.  But the poop is where I draw the line.  Well, you said you don't give up any sort of anal sex or butt play on the show today. 
[03:52:30]  That's not my thing.  That's tushy.  Did you notice that Jim looked at you like you were from another country where you said  you wouldn't accept a tongue?  Not a tongue?  What?  What are you doing?  Listen, there's other places that tongues can go and it doesn't need to be in my butthole.  That's true.  I just feel like if everything's clean, there's not a place on my body that a man shouldn't  want to go.  But if everything is clean, I'm just not interested.  Now, is this the type of...  I would be offended if a guy was like, I'm not going to do that.  He'd be like, then get out of here. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, I watched that.  And I won't do you.  That's like a tale of two cities right here.  That's a whole other story.  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that I'm not interested in that.  I'm worried because is this...  You and Lily are now arguing over butt play.  Is this the type of argument you and Alexis would get into before it blew up?  No, no, no, no.  Again, there wasn't a big blow up.  See, this is what people don't understand.  It's hard to convey the nuance of a relationship and the dynamics between two people adequately,  certainly in very limited time.  This is a six-year partnership that just wasn't meant to last forever. 
[03:53:30]  I mean, sometimes it just doesn't last forever.  And we would always argue about everything.  It's just that I think then Alexis was overdoing the radio show, wanted to have a change in  her life, and I was a part of that change, letting me go.  So there you go.  See, but it is, like, it sucks for you.  It did, but it did.  Because it wasn't like you grew apart.  No.  Because you were still down.  Yes.  She grew away from you.  Yes.  So it did, sure.  It sucked.  But at this point, I mean, she left in June.  So by now, I'm okay. 
[03:54:00]  We're not getting closer to the tears?  No.  Because you said you were a sensitive girl.  I'm very sensitive.  Like, my fiancee is also very sensitive, but she would have been bawling in tears if this  type of thing had happened to her.  I did.  I did cry.  I used to cry all the time.  No, no, no, no.  If what happened in this studio today had happened to her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because, I mean, you were treated as less than on more than one occasion.  Nah, it's all in good fun.  I think so.  Honestly, I think that they knew they could wreck me because I could handle it.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  I think that's why.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  What am I going to do?  They can't.  Yeah, I just didn't feel it was mean-spirited.  I felt it was ribbing.  I felt it was like what fraternity house hazing would be like without the alcohol poisoning.  Yeah, it was.  He's like Eminem in the movie Eight Mile.  You know when he comes out with that freestyle in the end and he's like, look, I'm going to lay  on the table everything that's wrong with me, where I'm from, and then nobody can say  shit about it.  That's kind of, Jenny's like the M&M.  But right before she does that, she throws up pasta all over herself. 
[03:55:00]  If I had eaten pasta.  If I had eaten it.  Too many carbs in pasta, she won't eat it.  You don't do that.  Nah, I do.  But if I eat that, I won't eat anything else.  You've got to treat yourself sometimes.  Yeah.  Were you nervous coming on?  Of course.  Were you nervous because it's a big show or nervous because you didn't want them to humiliate  you?  More because it's a big show.  I really, I don't think they're mean-spirited men.  They are.  You're wrong.  I just think.  Yeah, you've read them completely wrong.  And they're listeners?  The most vicious human beings on the planet.  Well, now, tell me this.  Again, I, I, I don't think like that. 
[03:55:30]  Well, those sweet things that you posted on there.  Tell me this, Jenny Hunt.  I'm just all wrong.  I'll give you that, that the guys were just, were ribbing you because they knew you could  take it.  Yes.  Like they wouldn't, if you were sitting there crying.  Honestly, if it had been some weird, like, random straight interview and they treated me not like a regular  person who comes in here, that would be a problem because then I think that they thought that I  couldn't take it, handle it, or do my job of being on the radio.  What good would that be?  Do you think the listeners are the same good-natured people that they are or are the listeners?  Listen, I think there are some listeners who are phenomenal and treat me really well and I'm so 
[03:56:00]  thankful for them.  Yeah, yeah.  And then there are some who spend the day calling me a cunt on Twitter.  And the shit pics.  Yeah, and so I'm like, all right, if this is what they have to do, if they're paying attention,  they're paying attention.  I, I, it's all okay.  I, I can't knock any of them, frankly.  They all serve their purpose.  You could knock some of the listeners.  I mean.  Quite frankly, they deserve to be.  Yeah, I mean, they're our listeners.  They're my listeners.  And I knock them, you know, constantly because a lot of them are just horrible human beings. 
[03:56:30]  And I am.  This is the part that I cry about.  What is?  Because if, because when I have gone through really rough times on the air, the listeners  have been so good to me.  Yeah.  That I am appreciative and I am thankful.  Not these listeners.  Oh, these ones would just be, kick me when I'm down.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd be like, look, I'm going through some hard times.  And they'd be like, you deserve it.  And they'd be like, yeah, well, what do you expect, cunt?  And you'd be like, I'm just trying to open my heart.  Right.  And I'm trying to do something different here.  See, someone said, take a tongue in the ass, you goddamn rich cunt.  You see?  And now it's like, that's their new thing? 
[03:57:00]  Because you closed off comments, but you left your posts up?  That's okay.  That's a sign of affection.  They said, I had a great time jerking off to you.  Okay.  Because now they, now they comment on your posts.  That's fine, because they can't put pictures up.  That's what we call, that's what we call phase two.  Jen, I'll buy your book if you show your tits.  And, uh, dude, Jennifer Hutts' asshole mustache.  Wow.  Jen and Lily should les out.  Have you guys thought about that?  No.  Just, not like in like your personal life, but as like a ratings thing.  Oh, for like sweeps week or something?  Yeah, something like that, just to get like a buzz, because I gotta tell you guys, the 
[03:57:30]  Martha Channel is, it's like the buzz, it's a little stale.  Yeah.  Not a lot going on, and maybe if you guys went on, not here, on your show.  I don't want to steal that heat from you, but if you went on your show and just-  And made out, just like made out.  I mean, you'd have to do a little more than make out, but-  What would we have to do?  Les out.  I mean, that kind of-  Like, can I'm married?  It would be inappropriate.  No.  I think it's a line that we should go down on each other.  Oh, really?  If that's where you would take it, scissoring, something.  No, that's all involved.  No, scissoring has a positive benefit to us. 
[03:58:00]  What is that?  You get to have an orgasm.  That would be nice for both of you, right?  It seems like their show needs to do more stunts.  Right, yeah, you don't have any stunts.  After we make this pie, scissoring next.  Yeah.  I tune in.  It's not what I want to do.  I'm not into girls.  I like boys.  Now-  Men, what?  Where can they-  First of all, Lily, are you jealous you're not in the book?  No, I wouldn't be jealous of that.  Because, all of a sudden, it just came to me, all of a sudden, you know, Jenny Hut is 
[03:58:30]  traipsing around the Today Show with Miss Yesterday, and you're like, what the fuck?  What about me?  What about Today?  How come I'm not going on the Today Show?  How come the Lily picture wasn't pasted over the Alexis picture on whatever land the book?  No, I'm absolutely not jealous.  You're okay with it.  Because, I have a movie that's out in theaters.  Oh, look at that movie!  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Today Show didn't book me to talk about that.  No, you didn't.  You must have a huge part. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, when I was living in Rochester, there was a movie that was being filmed up there,  and it was based on UFC fighter Matt Hamill, who's a deaf UFC fighter, and it's a biopic.  What?  Get it?  Yeah, I got it.  That was good.  I got a laugh from John Allen, so I'm good.  So, I actually got a small role in it, playing a special ed teacher, and I'm in SAG because  of it, and it actually just was released in theaters yesterday, in about, I think, 90  cities.  Yeah, 90 cities across the country.  I think for, I think today, or through the weekend, it's only going to be in theaters. 
[03:59:30]  It's in New York.  Go out.  It's in 90 cities across the country.  You must promote that today on the show.  Yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.  What's the, is there a website?  Yeah, thehammermovie.com.  You seem so unsure.  Because I couldn't find that.  And now, just Google, just Google.  Which is probably really easy to find, then.  Just Google Matt Hamill movie, and then you'll see there's a bunch of showtimes and cities  that it's available in.  I'll look it up.  Hold on.  And how can listeners find you on the interweb so they can give you some lovely pictures  and comments?  Oh, great.  Lily Hassani on Twitter.  Yeah, like anybody's going to know how to fuck to spell Hassani. 
[04:00:00]  Like, that's a name.  H-I-S-E-N-A-J.  Oh, very good.  You couldn't, like, why don't you start a fan page that's like Radio Lily or something, you  know?  All right, so where am I looking for the movie?  Just Matt Hamill movie or The Hammer?  Do you have a big part?  Have you seen the movie?  I'll Google it.  I'll try that.  I haven't seen the entire movie, but I did get to see the scene that I'm in.  Matt Hamill?  Now, are you worried that they have cut your scene out?  Are you in enough scenes?  I'm in one scene and I have, like, three lines.  But I am in it because I saw the final cut of the movie. 
[04:00:30]  Somebody did show me the first five minutes, which is where my scene is.  It's in the first five minutes.  Oh, so you can go and walk out.  The movie's not good, which it is good because it's won a bunch of awards at film festivals  in the past year.  That's it.  Yeah, so that's it.  So to find out, you go to thehammerfilm.com.  They won an award at the Cleveland Film Festival.  That's not a film festival.  The Cleveland Film Festival?  Film Festival.  What, are they showing on an 8mm in the back of a warehouse?  What the hell?  It's all over the place.  Lincoln Grand Cinemas and Lincoln, Nebraska.  It's in Omaha.  So, yeah, go to thehammerfilm.com, not the URL that Lily gave you. 
[04:01:00]  She was wrong.  She didn't have it.  Thehammerfilm.com, because this thing won at the Maui Film Festival.  Come on, now.  So it's got to be good.  It's a very big deal.  Look, just buy a ticket.  Support, guys.  Come on.  You've paid already.  It's not like ratings based.  You just have to buy the ticket.  You go, you watch Lily in the first five minutes. 
[04:01:30]  You know, according to Jenny's Facebook, some of you may beat off it the way it is, what  you do.  And then you go home once you're finished, once you're all done.  And Lily is plugging the movie.  Jenny Hutt is plugging whatever lay in the book, which is on Amazon.  And my website's justjenny.com.  Justjenny.com.  By the way, if I could give a recommendation or whatever, I have a website, too.  Oh, yeah.  My comments aren't open on it, ever.  And they're my feelings.  My comments aren't open on the web.  I have to approve each comment on the website. 
[04:02:00]  The chat box is open, but I can delete.  Yeah.  You can have your work cut out for you today.  Yeah, the chat box is going to be rough.  Yeah.  That's okay.  That's all right.  They have to sign in to do it.  That's part of, I guess, having fans.  Like, I don't...  You were saying, like, the listeners support you?  Yeah.  I don't know what that world is like.  I don't understand that there's a different world in this one, but...  It is.  Oh, you're on...  I'm going to sign you out of this Twitter.  Oh, thank you very much.  It is funny, the difference in the fans, because sometimes if a caller calls up and I disagree  with them, I fall out and we're like yelling down and I go, wait a second, I'm not on 
[04:02:30]  the virus anymore.  I can't do that.  This is Martha.  I feel bad sometimes, but...  These listeners don't have personal vendettas against me.  And then you don't go on your website and see somebody blowing a horse the next thing  you do.  Yeah.  Carolina man wants Jenny to know that there are normal people out there who really appreciate  her.  Thank you.  I can't believe there's not some joke after that.  I appreciate it.  I was waiting for ellipses.  Yeah.  But Joe, the ladies aren't the only things here at the club.  You're damn right.  You know?  What are you doing over the weekend?  I am going to be busy with my band. 
[04:03:00]  I have a new band, McClinton.  And we are opening it up for Ace Freely at McCahey's in Center Reach on Sunday at 7 o'clock.  Big gig.  We also signed a deal, record deal, so we're going to be having an official release party  in probably coming up in the new year.  That's awesome.  Ace Freely.  Yeah.  Ace Freely.  Pretty good.  What's the name of the band?  It's called McClinton.  You can find us at michaelmcclinton.com.  Also, go on our Facebook page, McClinton.  Oh, that's dangerous. 
[04:03:30]  Ah, fuck it.  Horses, I don't give a shit.  As long as you go there and like it, you go about horses, mules.  Put Gay Train on there if you want.  They will.  They'll take you up on that show.  And the great thing is, if you're not sure about the band and you don't want to give  a band that you haven't heard a chance, they're opening for Ace Freely.  If you think we blow, you've got Ace Freely coming up in 20 minutes.  Just go early enough to catch the opener.  That's right.  That's right.  And we're going to play, and plus he's friends with Anthony.  Yes.  I've played in a band, I've been in a friend with him for years and years and years.

Joe Curry, friends with Anthony.  Great musician.  Anthony only surrounds himself with the most talented people.  That's why I am rarely invited to the compound.  Very rarely.  Also great comedian, too.  I will be at Sully's Comedy Cellar in Baltimore, November 4th and 5th.  That's next week.  You do it all.  Yeah.  And yeah, because music isn't making money.  And that's November 4th and 5th.

You can catch the podcast at Anthony's Podcast Network.  And Lily, all you got is this crummy movie.  Yeah.  You feel like, what?  She's insane.  You are in SAG. 
[04:05:00]  I would like to get in SAG.  Hey, she beats us all.  You know how bad I want to SAG?  Go ahead.  When can they hear the Jenny and Lily experience?  Well, it's whatever with Jennifer Hutts.  Oh, okay.  I didn't remember that.  Lily is a huge participant.  She's awesome.  Thank you.  Is she going to get co-billing at some point?  I just let...  It's all that I don't know what's up with the show.  That's no.  All right.  No, no.  That's not...  That's not no.  I just don't know what's up with the show.  You're in Skate Under the Radar.  Yes.  Yeah, no questions about anything.  I'm hiding out.  As long as the studio is unlocked at 5 o'clock. 
[04:05:30]  Then I'm good.  Right.  It's on 5 p.m. Eastern.  5 to 7 Eastern on the Martha Channel.  That's Sirius 110.  So if you're listening to the replay, you've missed it.  Replay plays at what time?  9 p.m.?  Oh, you have a replay?  I think replay at actually 11 p.m.  Oh, because the replay of this show starts at 7 p.m. Eastern.  Oh, damn.  So...  But guess what?  Yeah.  You'll be back on on Monday.  That's right.  So it's not that big of a deal.  You can catch it anyway.  Well, I want to close with one of Joe Curry's songs.
