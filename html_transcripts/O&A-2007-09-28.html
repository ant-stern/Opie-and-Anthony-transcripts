<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with significant technical difficulties, the audio described as "bassy and tinny."  The hosts extensively reviewed the previous day's show, discussing Carrot Top's surprisingly large physique (with listener speculation of synthol use), Sandy Kane's eccentric appearance and subsequent YouTube videos, and the New York Mets' poor performance.  They recounted awkward encounters with Jerry Seinfeld and the challenges of interviewing celebrities.  A "Guess the Sound" segment featured E-Rock's reaction to a foul smell, followed by a listener's "Wake Up Your Spouse" suggestion involving dynamite.  The show included a lengthy discussion about the generally awful nature of sports mascots, with listeners and hosts suggesting ludicrous alternatives (gurneys with toe tags, a crushed car, a headless Indian carried by a settler).  The infamous failure of the Yankees' mascot, Dandy, was mentioned, along with anecdotes about other mascots like Slider, the giant crab, Steely McBeam, and the 76ers' hip-hop bunny.  A detailed account of a man named William, who enjoys wearing dresses, was played.


The broadcast continued with more mascot discussion and a humorous anecdote about a video of Sandy Kane being pelted with garbage, followed by E-Rock's vomiting reaction to her smell. An old AIDS news report was played, highlighting initial public fear and misinformation.  The hosts then discussed a woman who frequently undresses in her apartment, visible from their studio. This led to a conversation about urban privacy and perspectives. A Canadian listener called in, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees were debated, particularly Chic and the Beastie Boys.  The "F.U. Line" segment followed, and comedian Bill Burr appeared as a guest, sharing his experiences.  A musical interlude featured Roland performing a karaoke version of a Poison song.


Bret Michaels then joined the show, the conversation heavily focusing on *Rock of Love*.  Details about his relationships with contestants, including a neck tattoo incident, were discussed, along with a TMZ report alleging a threesome (Bret initially expressed regret at missing out, then downplayed it).  His post-*Rock of Love* dating life and contractual obligations were explored, along with a horrifying experience with a 75-year-old burlesque dancer.  Football predictions sponsored by Dish Network were given, followed by an unsubstantiated anecdote about Bret's father videotaping opposing teams' plays.  Hypothetical threesomes were debated, leading to humorous discussions.  Big John, a large associate of Bret, appeared as a guest, showcasing impressive stripper pole skills.  The segment featured numerous sexually explicit and crude anecdotes from Bret, Big John, and Rich Voss, including detailed accounts of sexual experiences and a mishap with a condom.  Bret's guitar being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame before him was also recounted.  Maury Povich's show, particularly segments featuring overweight children, was criticized.  A segment of poorly acted 1970s audio pornography was played and analyzed, highlighting its poor acting and unusual dialogue.


A later segment featured another extended playing of extremely graphic and sexually explicit audio from a poorly made pornographic film, filled with crude and offensive language, including repeated use of the word "cunt." The hosts highlighted the terrible acting and nonsensical dialogue, repeatedly playing and analyzing particularly bad lines.  Upcoming events, including Bret Michaels' appearance on *Rock of Love* and Bill Burr's performances, were mentioned. Big John remained in studio.  Jeff was credited with sending in the pornographic audio clip.  A caller, "Big A," revealed a surprising personal fact, creating a cliffhanger.  The show ended with the "line of the day" segment, featuring multiple vulgar and offensive entries, culminating in a long, repeated chant of “CUNT.”

[00:03:00]  it's only a nationally syndicated radio program did you turn your headphones up yeah i'm good is  it better it's all right yeah it still seems a little weird to be honest with you but something  maybe now a lot better than it was maybe now our ears are tainted right we have taints in our ears  man we had a great show yesterday i mean a fantastic radio show and and it doesn't matter we have to do  it again now we have to do it again that was yesterday my friend this is today it's just a 
[00:03:30]  memory now we had a lot of fun with carrot top yesterday in studio who'd have thunk it and then  never met the carrot top guy i heard jimmy jimmy though had uh met him a few times and said uh  carrot top was a cool guy yeah uh fun guy and then he sits down on the couch and he's hysterical  a bit funny he had a great time a bit strange looking i mean you know that comes to mind your  ass well that's why i didn't say it to his face kick your ass that's why i didn't say although we 
[00:04:00]  kind of like we play the great giraldo stuff that he said to him at uh the flame roast he was which  was a nice uncomfortable moment yeah he was really really nice but uh wow he's got a i don't well and  he's just giant i don't want to accuse him of anything but you just can't get that big by just  lifting weights i'm sorry he insists he does that's my my humble opinion he insists there are no uh  uh steroids or anything being used yeah but he is one of the most recognizable guys out there i i 
[00:04:30]  walked out of the building uh with him and uh out to 56th street and uh jesus everybody knows who the  hell he is he just everyone knows that's carrot top it's just well well when you look like a comic  superhero that came to life it's it's not like he's gonna blend in with everybody else walking to  work he is just a large walking action figure right for him not to get recognized he'd probably have to 
[00:05:00]  ponytail his hair i bet he can do something with his hair where he straightens it or he ties it behind  his head it probably no he gets recognized hair yeah because as soon as you see him he looks so  different than most human beings there's something with the eyebrows well i feel like he tweezes them  or then and then like colors them in i think they're tattooed or something tattooed there's been rumors that  some of that stuff on his face is tattooed uh like yeah they tattoo like mascara in so you never  have to put mascara on really yeah because it's all dark around his eyes that's like mascara 
[00:05:30]  but done in a way where it doesn't look uh girly to be honest with you you know what i mean it's  very kind of subtle but so i've heard rumors that that's kind of tattooed on that must have hurt to  get mascara yeah how the hell do you do that women do it all the time eyeballs it's a thing women do  ow but not a lot but there's a there's a small percentage of women that tattoo the mascara on i think  uh tammy faye had it done and they still they never have to do that again oh they're awake great 
[00:06:00]  yeah i have no idea i gotta put you out is that a real picture is that photoshop no that's a real  picture of uh carrot top it's on tmz.com i think that's him leaving regis before he came over and  saw us or the day before whatever yeah that's the real deal what you cannot get that big i'm telling  you my god man you can't get that big by just lifting weights do you get a picture of carrot top  from like 10 12 years ago because i he's got arnold arms yeah absolutely i'm carrot top 
[00:06:30]  he might be doing some you know protein shakes or what whatever i'm not gonna sit here and try to  figure it out but uh you just can't get that big by just lifting look how look what he used to look  like is this an older picture look how much thinner he is i know there's a radio i'm you know we you  could do this when we're saying look we're talking each other right you could do this your yourself at  home though you're listening in you could you could google carrot top you could you could go to  tmz and see like what he looked like two days ago and then you google uh carrot top images and you see 
[00:07:00]  uh what we're looking at a picture that's not even 10 years ago and he's uh a lot thinner yeah a lot  thinner and he's getting he's only getting bigger yeah like his his arms are are huge uh let's say  hi to sean in philly sean's got something on carrot top sean what's up  sean or john whatever you are you he's using posing oil in his shoulders there's pictures on  the internet right now of him where you can see his shoulders are really blown out but nothing else 
[00:07:30]  is proportionate right and what it is is synthol it's a posing oil that guy from manhattan posing  oil exploding arms right they do is they inject it in and it it blows the muscle bellies right up  anybody who's been looking for a few years knows what that is and knows that he can't deny it  so what he you're in your opinion you're saying that he's injecting something right into his  shoulders to pump them up that big exactly and it's called synthol oh no it's a posing oil 
[00:08:00]  the pros use it to bring up one small body part and have a doctor put it in for them so it's done  correctly right carrot top apparently does it himself because it looks silly how how long does  it last for if you do it uh probably about three to six months it looks like he's having more because  his side delts are so protruding in some of the pictures on the internet that it just it looks  ridiculous and it'll give away right away as soon as you see it you know yeah it is uh his shoulders 
[00:08:30]  look just way out of proportion it's like he's wearing flesh shoulder pads and and this and the side  shoulder uh is really tough to work that work out to begin with to get uh you know toned and and bigger  and his is just over the top big that's that's a hard body part to bring up and to bring it up  just like that by itself without anything else coming up with it yeah there's no way if you want  to it's a shame because with his time and his money and his schedule i'm sure he could actually be huge  the right way but he just he might be there's been a few pictures of carrot top on the internet where he 
[00:09:00]  you know he's caught and he doesn't look like he's on anything you know and and and he looks  disproportionate look how thin he is in this uh picture with uh paulie shore that's him  that's 96 that's when he was 96 he's just beat up he's just a really really thin guy he's svelte  extremely thin with absolutely no chest on him whatsoever he's travis skinny so all right hey  thanks for the info man oh okay calm down i want to inject that stuff but only into one arm 
[00:09:30]  that'd be great you have to just have one big arm yeah let's go to christine uh christine oregon go  ahead yeah i was just um letting you know that mascara goes on the eyelashes and eyeliner gets  tattooed on the eye but i think everyone understood but you know thank you they tattoo each individual's  hair right right right well i didn't think you guys would know so i was just helping you out but  but it's true right uh some of the girls they uh tattoo the eyeliner on permanently yeah yeah saves us a 
[00:10:00]  lot of time and a lot of money a lot of money how much could it possibly cost over a lifetime compared  to a tattoo artist i don't know but it cost me about i don't know twenty dollars about a month to do  yeah you broads when you're doing in your car in the morning right that's great to get it done  one time and never have to do it again but miss doesn't it hurt miss doesn't it hurt when they put  the needle on your eye not if you take a cup of vacuum before then okay all right well thank you 
[00:10:30]  all right bye dude all right uh and then we also had sandy canin here yesterday and those videos are  now up on youtube just throw in opie and anthony and do a you know latest video search but uh  she never disappoints she is just a disaster a disaster we used to know how old she was  because we figured out with her id one day but that was like five years ago i don't remember what  we figured out at the time she's got to be in her 70s right she's got to be at least pushing an old  burlesque dancer that uh we're stuck with she comes in every once in a while she was part of the uh 
[00:11:00]  phil specter uh murder trial because she claimed that phil specter raped her yeah at gunpoint  single-handedly right but i guess she was an actual witness because i remember you know they  were talking about her in the i think it was the new york post you know a while ago oh no not really  yeah imagine that on a witness stand yeah oh bill specter when they found out that sandy  kane was going to be on the witness stand was like oh my god thank you thank god  hey and abroad but uh uh you know no one's gonna believe this no one's gonna believe this 
[00:11:30]  i was uh i was waiting for my vehicle out on uh the street yesterday and um sandy kane comes walking  down the street now she was dressed like if if there was this hot dallas cowboy cheerleader  they would be dressed the same way uh but it's sandy kane so she's walking down the street and she's got  the red white and blue cowboy hat on and the little shorts and just everyone was looking at her and 
[00:12:00]  like smiling and laughing and shaking their heads and i'm hiding behind a parking sign  as she walks by so as not to draw her attention so she would talk to me because i didn't want  to be seen talking to her just amazing yeah she never disappoints because she always disappoints yeah  that's true but she gave us great radio yesterday she's doing some kind of dolly parton thing she's 
[00:12:30]  she's so uh delusional she thinks she's starring in a dolly parton movie or something yeah and i  think that's the look she was kind of going for yesterday in a weird way it was like the stars and  stripes but it was like like dan said kind of like a dallas cowboys cheerleader but then she kind of  had a a jean benet ramsey type of thing happening with the cowboy hat on looking dead right yeah  but she had the cowboy hat on and like kind of like cowboy boots or something yeah she's wearing  like thigh and not thigh high they were up up to almost her knees right white go-go boots and if 
[00:13:00]  you go to youtube and check it out those are stop stop boots on her just get away no you want her to go  go go go if you go to youtube uh you get to see her like singing a song and us throwing crap out of  her and dumping garbage on her head that was my favorite when she's dumped the entire garbage pail  over her head yeah and then um and then if that wasn't good enough we decided to have e-rock um smell 
[00:13:30]  some horrific body parts yeah you know certain parts of the body throw off more of an odor than  other others and uh we had um e-rock uh give it a whirl and take a take a sniff so at uh actually it  was two areas yes and um yeah one worse than the other exactly but barely i think they're pretty much  well no the one i thought i think they're pretty much similar the area i thought was going to be worse

[00:19:30]  What do you think that is?  Give us a call.  What could that possibly be?  8-7-7-2-1-2-0-N-D-A.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  See what I mean, Ed?  Air Guitar Friday.  Let it go.  It's one of those songs you could air guitar to.  Do you do that on purpose?  Are these songs being picked out on purpose?  We're trying.  We're trying for the people out there.  It is Air Guitar Friday.  Nice.  On the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Matt, the therapist from South Carolina.  He's writing, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Gee, I wonder what that's about.  And then he writes, I'm pointing and laughing at Opie because the Mets suck.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of the big.  The big joke is on.  They can't pull out a win here.  Know what I say to that?  Go Islanders! 
[00:21:00]  Looking toward your hockey.  And where's my season tickets?  Rich.  Uh-oh.  Now using the radio show for personal messages.  I was going to say, maybe you should just go down there and buy some.  I got my guy and he's trying to figure out where I'm going to sit this year.  And don't worry, Tom.  I'm paying for the tickets.  So, I'm not doing a free plug here today.  Do you realize I'm looking at the paper right now?  Yeah.  The top five TV earners of, I think, last year. 
[00:21:30]  Number one was Oprah at $260 million.  That's always, yeah.  Number two is Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Jerry made $60 million last year.  That show has been up the air since 98.  $60 million.  $60 million in syndication.  If you're making $60 million a year on TV, you should at least show up on TV a couple times during that year.  That show is all over the country, multiple times a day and night.  And it does very well.  Guy is making so much money. 
[00:22:00]  Simon Cowell was number three at $45 million.  Wow.  Because he owns a part of that show.  Yeah, he owns a part of that show.  He owns other shows.  Who else?  Round off the list for me.  Letterman made $40 million, and last was Trump at $32 million.  Wow.  Yeah.  Letterman makes more than Trump, huh?  Well, no.  Trump.  TV-wise.  Oh, TV-wise.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  But that's pretty.  That makes sense.  I mean, Trump doesn't need the money, and he made $32 million doing TV last year.  That's just amazing.  That's crazy.  And Jerry's going to be on the season premiere of 30 Rock.  Yes. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know when that is.  Is that next week, I believe?  I should give Jerry a call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll have his number.  We'll get him on the show.  Yeah.  We've been trying to do that for years.  That'll happen.  And every time we run into Seinfeld in Manhattan, we're like, yeah, Opie and Anthony, we met  you at Colin Quinn.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could care less about Opie, Anthony, and Jim Northean.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard of you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  We got a few yeahs from Jerry.  That's about it.  He's not.  We don't get we don't get this, Jerry.  The Elaine, what are you doing?  Come on, guys.  Kramer.  We don't get that, Jerry.  We get that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember you guys.  Seinfeld has this great way of like he'll like kind of lean back and like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then just not acknowledge you're even there anymore.  I got to meet Jerry Seinfeld because of Jim Norton.  I went to the Colin Quinn roast.  That was for his bachelor party and then he was married for about a week. 
[00:23:30]  Rice.  Which is true.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  And after the roast, Jimmy and I go on stage to talk to Jerry and I didn't want to be Seinfeld  douche.  So that is great because that actually sums it all up.  He must get so many Seinfeld douches.  And, you know, the fans I like to talk to are the ones that don't really mention the  show, to be honest with you, or it's a little bit about the show and then it's about other 
[00:24:00]  things.  Yeah.  Because it's a little more interesting because, you know, everyone walks up to us thinking  that we've never heard what they're about to say.  Yeah.  For the most part.  So I use that same logic when I meet celebrities.  Uh-huh.  Like real celebrities.  You know, I'm not trying to put us in the same category, obviously.  But you try to come up with something that they haven't heard.  So I don't want to be Seinfeld douche because I just assume everyone is doing the Seinfeld  thing when they meet Jerry Seinfeld, talking about their favorite episode or this or that.  Yeah.  So that movie comedian was out, his documentary, and I just said, man, you know, I just saw 
[00:24:30]  that and I thought it was terrific.  Really, really well done.  And he got all excited and was like, oh, thanks.  And I engaged him, right?  And then I sat there.  Now you have nothing.  And then I'm just staring at him like, ah.  I'm out of things to say to you.  Oh, boy, this went great, but I have nothing else.  Okay.  I'll be leaving now.  And I just walked off the stage awkwardly.  Yeah.  And you want to say, I mean it.  And he'll go, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  It works at that one moment.  You'll be friends.  But that's what's so sad.  I actually engaged him where there was definitely an interest, nothing over the top exciting,  but he was like, oh, wow, cool.  I'm glad, you know, because it wasn't one of these things that everyone went out to see.  Yeah.  And then I had nothing to follow it up.  Nothing.  And I just sat there and stared.  You should think of a follow up.  And then you had a good approach, but you didn't have the follow up.  You should think of a follow up first.  Right.  So when you walk up, now you got a backup plan.  I had nothing, man.  I just awkwardly walked off the stage and I had that uncomfortable feeling inside and it 
[00:25:30]  was just bad.  And then Ant and I ran into him going into a restaurant.  Yep.  And then I brought up, I met you at the college.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what he does.  Yeah.  He just makes that face.  Lean back.  He's an honest guy.  He don't give a crap.  He doesn't care.  He's not going to sit there and act like it was a big deal.  He's making gazillions.  And then there was another time we met him.  I forgot where else.  And same thing.  We're just trying to like get this little, little like relationship. 
[00:26:00]  A little toehold on, on a, a, a friendship.  Right.  And once again, just, just recognition.  And then, then the, and then it was more like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember  that.  I said, why don't you get the hint?  I don't care about you guys.  I'll never be on your show.  I think I remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh God.  It was so horrible.  It is so horrible.  Well, he, one thing he is not is a phony.  He is not a phony at all.  He will let you know. 
[00:26:30]  Not you.  That's the famous Bob Kelly.  Right.  Not you story.  Not you.  Pop thought he was becoming friends with Jerry.  All right.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  I said boxing, right?  You ass.  Jerry.  In my little read.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Just fighting with people as we try to do a radio show.  All right.  We're trying to figure out what this sound is.  Let's play it again.  Guess the sound.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  By the way, the phone call I wanted to go to, the guy hung up, he's guessing that  it's E-Roc's dentist.  I know what that is, by the way. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  It's Ope beating his head against the bathroom stall after not having a follow-up question  for Seinfeld.  Soft sobbing.  I didn't think ahead.  I was like, okay, I know what will engage him in conversation, but then I needed more  and I had nothing.  You know, it's showing interest.  I think I was hoping that he was going to say something that would spark something else.  Yeah.  But no.  But no.  Showing interest in some kind of a new, more obscure project like that was good. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Because that's something you want to, you know, if we did something else other than the radio  show and we really felt passionate about it and people came up and were like, wow, you  know, like Jimmy with the book.  When people come up and go like, oh, I read your book.  It was really great.  That makes you feel really good.  That's what Ope did and then had nothing after that.  And that's the worst is when you do engage somebody like that and we've all had those  and you really grab them and you're like, you're almost better off just going, man, 
[00:28:30]  I'm a fan.  I really love you.  And they'll go, okay, because then you expect nothing.  But when you, when you see the eye contact and they're like, really?  Right.  And you're like, uh-huh.  Then you just got to skulk away.  It really is the worst.  You know, you know, it's really bad too when a friend comes up to them, like a really good  friend and starts talking and you're just stuck there.  Yeah.  A complete outsider.  And then you're not a friend and you got to just kind of turn and walk away.  And then you realize that you're such a zero because, you know, then I, at that actual 
[00:29:00]  roast, I saw Seinfeld talking to others and it was just natural conversation.  Yeah.  You know, there wasn't any thought, like I was thinking exactly what I was going to say  when I went up on that stage after the thing, you know.  I've had an experience with Ronnie, Ronnie B, Ron Bennington in a restaurant.  We sit down.  It was after one of the gigs or something and we're just laughing and talking and I think  Dan was there too.  Yeah.  And a fan comes over to say hi. 
[00:29:30]  He actually came over to say hi before Ronnie sat down and it was like, yeah, how you doing?  And he's talking.  He's a little intoxicated.  So it's all show related stuff, but you know, it's cool.  And then Ronnie comes down and sits down and me and Ronnie just start like talking and  he's still sitting there just injecting himself in like, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, like it was so awkward and Ron just, he just looks at the guy like, what are you 
[00:30:00]  still doing here?  There's nothing worse than as a performer when somebody won't leave and there's nothing  worse than as a fan when you know you should.  You should just leave.  Gotta go.  Yeah.  Because we've been on kind of both sides of that thing where you're like, oh, wow,  this guy's kind of overstayed his welcome a little bit.  And I've been there where it's like, I think I should leave.  I'm not part of this anymore.  This is, this is beyond just saying hi.  And the best thing you could do is just turn around and walk away, walk away and just get 
[00:30:30]  the uncomfortable moment done with, instead of sitting there going, when do I make my  escape?  Because they don't even notice anymore that you're still standing there.  Just get it over with.  Yeah.  I think part of you just wants to extend the magic for as long as possible.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I was trying to do with Jerry Seinfeld.  Absolutely.  There's no magic, but you're just like, oh, there's none whatsoever.  Yeah.  Why can't time stop?  There's nothing worse than when you run out of steam, you just, and you feel it and you  both feel the moment is gone. 
[00:31:00]  And you're going to stand there like a little kid though, always tugging like on the bottom  of your shirt, waiting for that moment.  Like, I'll think of something.  Maybe something will come up or he'll say something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll want to know something about me.  Yeah.  I told you when I talked to Alan Alda at Louis CK's thing recently, I had him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You had him.  We were talking like, like, cause I was talking about something, an angle on mash that he  liked and, uh, he agreed with and we chatted, but then I could just feel it like I'm being  an intense fan and I could just feel him start talking to somebody else.  Oh, yeah.  And then the old turn is what you don't want to see when they, they turn away from you 
[00:31:30]  and they're talking to somebody else.  It's time to go.  And in your head, you're like, I'm losing him.  I'm losing him.  Yeah.  And then you have to decide, do I actually say, well, take it easy and actually try to  get his attention again just to sign off?  Yes.  Or just turn around and kind of look.  Like, you're still just standing there, but you're no longer engaging them in conversation.  There you go.  All right.  People trying to guess the sound still.  Lawrence in Gainesville. 
[00:32:00]  What's up, Lawrence?  All right.  I think that is, uh, E-Rock yesterday after smelling an unmentorable area.  Ah.  Okay.  And we're going to replay that audio in a little bit here.  Uh, that's a good guess.  Uh, go Gators, by the way.  Thank you very much, guys.  My nephew, uh, he spends all his money just traveling to watch the Gators play.  He's ridiculous.  And still has a, he still has like a 5.0 in college.  Ooh.  All right, Lawrence.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, uh, that sound is the sound of the Red Sox gasping for air because they suck. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, you know.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  You could say it's the sound of the Mets.  No.  He's obviously a Mets fan.  Choking.  Daily News cover.  Ah, quick message.  Ah, quick message.  Ah, I see you.  Woo.  That is great. 
[00:33:00]  Trying to figure out what that is today.  And by the way, I meant to say that guy's obviously a Yankee fan by saying the Sox suck.  But anyway, what were you going to say, Jimmy?  Daily News cover, to play sports in New York, the papers here are pretty brutal on the teams. 
[00:33:30]  But it says, meet the mutts instead of meet the Mets.  The mutts.  I'm going to laugh about that all day.  What an awful thing to call your hometown team.  You mutts.  And Newsday's even better, though.  They got Mr. Met with a sad face.  Oh, they put a sad face on him.  Put a sad face on him.  I don't think his expression could change.  And then it just says, help.  He still looks silly, all smiling.  Yeah, we're losing.  Hands stretched out to the sides.  And Mr. Met just going, help.  With that tiny little Met hat on top of that gigantic ball head of his. 
[00:34:00]  Big, mongoloid head.  And then it says, Phil's catch Mets.  Where will this end?  Hello, Philly.  How are ya?  All right.  People are still waking up.  We got a nice thing to wake up people with today.  We do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday we woke them up with Roland singing some opera.  Today we got a...  You got to just wait for it.  Okay.  It's one of those wait for it, wait for it. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  A little wake up.  Enjoy the sounds...  What can we say about this?  Nothing whatsoever.  Nothing.  Can I say...  Talk for a second here.  Okay.  I'll have a little chit-chat.  I want to play the Meet the Mets theme and just listen to it.  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Step right up.  And then what are you supposed to do?  Meet them again?  You'll probably beat the Mets.  Beat the Mets. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Why today?  All right.  Why today?  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Expectations as usual.  But also has top to bottom type...  Pau, choke yourself.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  E-Rock played the wrong version of the song.  Yeah.  Pau, choke yourself.  All right.  Anyway.  Now lean forward and choke yourself.  E-Rock, what'd you do?  Huh?  E-Rock, are you panicking?  He said, E-Rock, what did you do?  And he said, nothing. 
[00:35:30]  That sums it up.  How can you say nothing?  You did something.  Even if it was just pushing a button.  E?  E-Rock, were you up on pal talk a little too late last night?  No.  The file that I usually go to, they added stuff to it.  Oh, they.  Who's they?  The Major League Baseball channel.  Oh.  All right.  Damn them.  Well, the moment's gone now.  All right.  Here you go.  Enjoy the sounds of a fatty. 
[00:36:00]  I love the music.  Who is this?  The music, I mean.  I don't know.  Toby Keith.  Is this?  You don't know.  Travis Tritt.  You don't know.  Oh, God.  Help.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  She must be a big fan of country music, I guess. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love the change in voice.  What happened there?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I am the werewolf.  I am the werewolf.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses. 
[00:37:30]  Dresses.  What the hell?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, sweetheart.  She likes country music.  Yeah.  Obviously.  It goes from like...  I like turtles. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, we know.  Turtles are great.  Enough about the turtles.  Why didn't we discuss William's fingernails?  I mean, the dress was sexy.  Yes.  Yes.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  Polish.  He's leaning in and making love with his voice.  I like fingernail polish.  You know, just a mere week ago, it was all about...  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[00:38:30]  But that's quickly being replaced by...  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  Dresses.  I like to wear dresses.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  You want to just belt him into his own wheelchair and then just push him into a pool.  Well, I don't know if he's a kid anymore, but he's got to be in his...  He's an adult, I thought, right?  I don't know.  I would guess like in his late 20s and he's in a wheelchair, he's a mess and he wears dresses 
[00:39:00]  in a wheelchair.  Do you think the father tried to skulk out of the delivery room with his little mask on?  Like that...  Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink.  Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink.  Like he had to just get out of there.  I might have the sounds of William's father leaving the hospital.  Ah, well, maybe not.  Because I think I got it.  Here it is.  Ah, congratulations.  It's...  Oh my...  Oh my goodness. 
[00:39:30]  It's a...  Well, it's a boy.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, where do you...  Hey, where do you think you're going?  Hey, hey!  Where do you get back here?  Hey!  No, you can't...  Hey!  Hey!  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  Get back here!  Hey!  You're a father!  You're a new dad!  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses. 
[00:40:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Do we have any more William stuff?  William.  William rules.  Can we go long form on William today?  William's great.  Oh, he's the greatest thing since he's had.  He's now better than werewolf guy.  Uh, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey!  Hey, Max.  I actually know the name of that song that Fat Girl was listening to.  Yeah, yeah?  It's by a guy named Billy Dean and the song's called If There Hadn't Been You.  Aw.  That's sweet.  Well, I guess she's a big Billy Dean fan then. 
[00:40:30]  Who wouldn't be?  All right.  Sounded great.  Is this, uh, the long form of William?  William.  Uh, is this just William?  Or do we have to listen to the whole thing again, Danny?  Uh, well.  Hey!  That disc is, uh, when him, when William and this girl are having a back and forth.  Like, she's, she's saying a line and then he's repeating it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  If I could be a woman, my body would be stunning.  If I could be a woman, my body would be stunning. 
[00:41:00]  It would be steamy, fiery, and I would probably weigh a hundred pounds.  It would be steamy, fiery, and I'd probably weigh a hundred pounds.  I would be six foot and have a B cup.  I would be six foot and I'd probably have a B cup.  By the way, uh.  A B cup.  We're lucky enough to see the video as we play this audio.  Yeah.  He's got a long, creepy blonde wig on with, like, a ponytail on the back.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:41:30]  He's got a dress that, uh.  But he likes wearing dresses.  Uh, yeah, but the dress is like a dress your older aunt would wear to a wedding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he looks ridiculous.  And he can't even, like, he can't even go all the way with the whole drag thing.  He's wearing red sneakers, even though he has no use for those red sneakers.  No.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  I forgot he's in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  Yeah, so.  My sneaker treads are pristine.

[00:59:30]  Somehow it doesn't  Have that impact  Of knock-a-Homer  Of course it doesn't  I'm a Chief  And I knock-a-Homer  Steven S. from Bayshore  He's obsessed  With Tom Chiasano  You know  Tom walked in  To say good morning  And  Yeah  And Steven S.  Notices every morning  Of course he does  And he was making fun of his tie  And  And he noticed how  Tom came in today  And just sucked the  Humor right out of the room  With him  But he also writes  On the Instant Feedback  I think the sound  Is anyone after  A two hour meeting  With Tom Chiasano  Just banging your head  Against the wall 
[01:00:00]  Screaming  Tom is humor  Flypaper  Like when there's  Like a bunch of laughs  Buzzing around  He walks in  And they all just go  And then he walks  Out with them  These won't be needed  Yeah  How about  Chief legs out  A double  Rob on Long Island  What's up  Oh Opie  I hate mascots  Sparky the Dragon  Could your islanders  Find a more pathetic  Excuse for a mascot  Sparky the Dragon  Rob  That's why 
[01:00:30]  See you guys  Don't understand  How smart I am  Actually  That's why  I started this bit  By going  Let's just  Stick to baseball  Stick to baseball  That's Sparky the Dragon  Yeah  Right  Oh my god  Get that  F out of here  F the Rangers  By the way  Sparky the Dragon  Yeah  Why do they  Who comes to  The people in charge  And says  I got an idea  Look  We need a mascot  Yeah  Alright  Alright  I was thinking  A dragon 
[01:01:00]  Named Sparky  Why  Where  The Islanders  Because we're from  Long Island  It has nothing  To do with dragons  Yeah  That's one of those  Mascots that have  Nothing to do with  Anything  It just  Yeah  It has nothing  To do with the team  Where the team plays  Remember when the Islanders  Tried to like  Get that whole  Fisherman thing going  Yeah  Well  We like to forget  About that  It was like the  Gortons of Gloucester  Fishermen  With their new logo  You think somebody 
[01:01:30]  Would have said  He's a dragon  He breathes fire  That will melt the ice  Yeah  It's a stupid one  That's a dumb  Mascot for hockey  Sparky the hibachi  Sparky the rock salt  Stupid  Does somebody already  Have like  Sam Boney  Is that like  A mascot  There's gotta be  There has to be  He's real big  And he goes on the ice  And just  I'm Sam Boney  Yeah  Hockey shouldn't have  Mascots  No team should  None  Unless it's really brutal 
[01:02:00]  And we'll scare children  Look  The beheaded prostitute  Coming out  Must be the  Seventh inning stretch  How great would that be  You know that would be  Things to frighten the children  That would be hilarious  Like next baseball season  Like we as a show  Should come up with  Our own mascot  That we try to get  To catch on  We get like season tickets  To the Yankees  Or somebody  And we just  Have this  The most god awful  Mascot  Ever invented  Horrible mascots  Every single game  Your parents were murdered  Somehow  Two parents murdered 
[01:02:30]  Yeah  You're never seeing  Mommy again  The mascot  The mascot is just a guy  But his outfit is  Two gurneys  That are covered up  With a big toe tag  One says  One says D  And one says M  On the toe tag  And he runs around  With a boohoo  Playing over the loudspeaker  Kansas City Royals  Yeah they have  Slugger  He's got three R's  Three R's  And Slugger  That's the Royals 
[01:03:00]  Yeah and then you got  Yeah  Wait Cleveland Indians  It says a light purple  Fuzzy monster  With yellow spots  And eyebrows  Is Slider  Is that the new one  Slider yes  They took Chief Nakahoma  Away  Of course  Oh there you go  Well Slider  Has a big gut  And a big nose  And I bet he likes  To slide  He slides  And then people  Chase him around  Hey what are you doing  By the way the Yankees  Were not immune to mascots  Dandy was a short lived  Mascot of the New York Yankees 
[01:03:30]  He was a large  Pinstripe bird  That sported a Yankees hat  He had a mustache  That gave him an appearance  Similar to that  Of former Yankee pitcher  Sparky Lyle  His name was a play  On the classic  American folk song  Yankee Doodle Dandy  What year was this  He appeared at the start  Of the 1980 season  And was so unpopular  Unpopular that he was  Quickly cancelled  Yeah  Dandy was beaten up  By fans who didn't  Want a mascot  They beat him up  Yeah Dandy  This is official by the way  This is not us writing  This crap 
[01:04:00]  Dandy was beaten up  By fans who didn't  Want a mascot  And quit  Leading to the elimination  Of the character  As the Yankees chose  Not to replace him  Dandy  And that's what they  Try to do up there  In Boston  With Wally  Ladies and gentlemen  Let's give a big hand  To Dandy  As he comes out  Onto the field  What's happening  To Dandy  Oh my god  Someone help him  Dandy is down  Maybe somebody  Can help  Oh they're continuing  To kick and punch 
[01:04:30]  Dandy the mascot  This is terrible  I've never seen  Oh my goodness  I've never seen  A beating like this  In all my life  Goodness gracious  Of all the dramatic  Things I've ever seen  Goodness gracious  You should see  What's going on  In the Yankee dugout  Passada  Exactly  Passada's smiling  Like Dandy's  Flapping his wings  Dandy  Dandy's got the  Bird flu  Dandy in George 
[01:05:00]  Steinbrenner's box  Being punched  Dandy stinks  Dandy  That should be  Horrifying mascots  No more cute  Kids are so jaded  Anyway  The kids love it  Let's go to  Chris in Pennsylvania  You need a horrifying one  Like the Phillies mascot  Could be like  A drunk driving wreck  Like 7th inning stretch  And it's a guy  Dressed like a car  That's been crunched  With a bloody  Inside windshield  And he runs around  With like EMS 
[01:05:30]  Like guys  Next year  We gotta come up  With the most  Horrific costume  And go to every  Yankee home game  Is that  Samboni  Oh we found  Samboni  Good call it  This is the  Providence Bruins  Oh Providence  Samboni  Oh he's a bear  Wow  Ladies and gentlemen  Let's give a big hand  To the Miami  Empty Crib  The Miami  Empty Crib  Let's go to 
[01:06:00]  Chris in PA  Chris what's up  I don't know  Where they came up  With it  But the 76ers  In Philly  Have hip hop  A bunny rabbit  That is their mascot  Hip hop  Hip hop  Because he hops  And does he do  Hip hop like dance  And stuff  Yeah does he have  Hip hop  Oh I bet  The old  Like real old school  Hip hop plays  And he does like  Like dances  Like in  What's his name  Fred Berry  A rerun  Rerun  I wouldn't mind  Hip hop  If they hired  Heather Mills  To be the mascot 
[01:06:30]  She just hops out  Dragging two bags  Of money  That she didn't earn  He does spring off  A little trampoline  And slam dunk  Every once in a while  Of course  Thank you  Is this true  Mike  Mick  Mick  DB  Let's just call him  Back in the 80's  The San Francisco Giants  Introduced a giant crab  As a mascot  Giant crab  When it came onto the field  For the first time  It was pelted with beer  And other assorted  Projectiles  It never came back 
[01:07:00]  Is that true  What do you think  They tell these people  In the suits  That have to go out there  It must be like  The gladiator  Having to go out  Into the coliseum  Alright look  You're probably  Not going to be appreciated  The first time out  Right  It's a slow build  And then you just  Get pelted so badly  They pull you  It's really baptism  By fire  Yeah  Yeah  Well especially in baseball  There's a lot of purists  Out there  They don't want  A lot of tradition  They don't want  Their game to change  So all of a sudden  You're like  You throw Wally 
[01:07:30]  The mascot  Onto you know  The field at Fenway  People lose their minds  They're like  What are you doing  We don't want this  It's named after a wall  What is the green monster  It's a wall  You should have  A crushed vehicle against him  That'd be great  You know  Ted the divider  Travis you got something  Yeah that crazy crab  Thing's true 
[01:08:00]  That is true  Yeah but it was  Intended as a parody  Of mascots  Oh was it  Yeah  Yeah but they didn't  Explain that ahead of time  I guess  But like the Giants  Players would  You know throw stuff  At him  And there was commercials  Beating him up  And stuff like that  That's horrible  Why  It's  Let's bring on  Ted the big dig slab  It falls on the opposing team  Killing them instantly  It's just a guy  Pulling a hand truck  With a big hunk of concrete  And people point at it  And two feet sticking out  From underneath it 
[01:08:30]  The Cleveland Indians  Have a new mascot  Or Benny  Benny the beanbag bullet  Benny the Boston beanbag bullet  Comes out  Hits girls in the eye  Cleveland has a new mascot  Up there for their  Baseball team  Yeah we said that  The slider  The headless Indian  Actually  Oh my god  Yeah it's actually 
[01:09:00]  It's a settler  On horseback  Just carrying an Indian head  And laughing  What is that one  Oh that's the crab  Oh that's the crab  Okay  I can see how  That might be a parody  That's frightening  That would scare the children  It's like a big piece of toast  It doesn't resemble a crab  Let's acknowledge  It's actually  A genital crab  It's not even  One of those edible ones  It's a giant crab 
[01:09:30]  With a human fingernail  On it  Someone from their cell phone  Hey Ope  The Mets should adopt  Mama Cass  As their mascot  That's a choking joke  I get it  Oh there you go  Thank you sir  Hey let's go to Sean  And let's acknowledge  That Pittsburgh is alive today  Sean what's up  The Steelers got  This guy Steely McBeam  Yeah  They have cheerleaders  But they have Steely McBeam  Is it  What is it  An I-beam 
[01:10:00]  It looks like  Max Headroom  Steely McBeam  Yeah  Why  That is the dumbest  Who's thinking of these  And approving them  Yeah  We're you know  It's a  We  Our whole city  Is all about steel  Hold on  Iraq  You're spelling  It's Steely McBeam  No  Oh my god  And then Iraq  Goes no  I'm not  Even though he is  And then he replaces  Yeah  What do you got there  Travis  Steely McBeam  Was actually voted on 
[01:10:30]  By the fans  The fans  All submitted their mascots  And that was the best one  Out of 80,000  Were they joking?  No I think they were serious  There was another option  Diaper McLoaded  Horrendous  Daddy McMiner  Oh my god  Wow  It ain't getting better than that  So  Why don't we take a break

[01:13:00]  Already have  A disgusting old mascot  His name is Yogi Berra  And he sits in the dugout  And all the Yankees  Pet his head  Before every game  Yeah that is true  The Yankees  Got that weird thing  They uh  They pet Yogi Berra's  Head there  They do  They should just like  Not even tell Yogi Berra  That he's the new mascot  He doesn't know  And just have him  Walk around the field  Every game  In between innings  Instead of bothering  Yogi Berra  They should just leave  Scooter propped up  In their  Old Phil Rizzuto  They should slap 
[01:13:30]  His face  Hey thank you Susan  Call him  Rigor mortis  I'm surprised  That the listeners  Aren't jumping on  This mascot bit  Usually they  They help us along  But they're a little slow  The listeners  Are a little slow  At times we're a little slow  But I think I gotta say  The listeners are slow today  Brian Huntington  What's up  Hey what's going on  First of all  Scooter the holy cow  Is the  Staten Island Yankees  Mascot  I thought that was pretty funny 
[01:14:00]  Scooter the holy cow  What's it look like  What's it look like  He's a big cartoon cow  With a halo on it  Holy cow  Ew  Yeah exactly  I also know why Sparky  Is the Islanders mascot  Yeah  He's actually  The New York Dragons mascot  The arena football team  That plays in the same building  And they just throw  A hockey jersey on him  Because the Islanders  Are very cheap  They get a second hand  Mascot the Islanders  Yeah we gotta share  The mascot  With an arena football team 
[01:14:30]  He's probably a holdover  From the Millberry  I hope he  All right  F the Rangers  Let's say hi to  Greg in Kentucky  Greg what's up  Hey I wanna guess the sound  Oh guess the sound  Yeah we gotta  You wanna give this away finally  Yeah  All right what do you got there Greg  Hey is that  Anthony at the gym  Trying to bench  Press 20 pounds  Hey  About time they get off me  And got on something else  I can bench  More than 20  I think I can do

[01:16:30]  As hard as he can  Yeah  Watch Jimmy  Watch to your right  And  Why is he doing that  Actually it would be a little  Confusing to say  He puts something on the table  He puts a couple of things on the table  There you go  And then  Hits it with the heel of his shoe  That he has in his hand  And he might be reacting to that  Yeah  It looks like someone taking a shoe 
[01:17:00]  And hitting a shiny brain  Hmm  That could be marginal  We'll see  But that's pretty much  The only time  You would make that sound  Why  You would do  Something like this  I don't have a clue  No  But here it is  Quick message

I don't know  What are they waiting for?  Maybe Erock's camera to be unfroze on Paltalk? 
[01:25:30]  Who knows?  They could be waiting for that  And waiting and waiting and waiting  I was lucky enough to see Fatty across the way naked today  I haven't seen Fatty in a while  Oh my god yeah  We had a great view  Of uh  The  The  Well she  You know something?  She wasn't that fat  When we first got here  She doesn't exercise as much does she?  No she used to exercise  And she realized it was a lost cause  Because when she was exercising 
[01:26:00]  She was still chubby  Yeah  Now she's like  Ah screw it  She gave up  And speaking of screwing it  She's decided to screw a lot of things  And I'm not talking about sex  So relax  Yeah  She's let herself go  Let's just put it that way  Oh did she put weight on?  Yeah she  She let herself go in many many ways  Is what I'm getting at  Like  Oh yeah yeah  For the people that linger longer  My brother would love her  Yeah  Does it look like Phil Spector is in the room?  Yes  Yes  Absolutely  The arrested  The mugshot 
[01:26:30]  Yeah  Of Phil Spector  Just a wreck  And she's got a bunt now  And she got like double hips going  And I watched  She got the set of hips  And then another set  I watched the whole thing go down too  We're talking about this girl  Across the way in this apartment right  So she's fully clothed  We're in break  And I'm just  We always look out the window here  Because we got a great view  We're just checking things out  And I watched her whole thing go down  Yeah  Before she gets completely naked  She puts the blinds down  Maybe two feet 
[01:27:00]  So it's still pretty much  You could see it  Pretty much  You still could see her  So I don't even know why  She put the blinds down two feet  And she didn't close that part of the blinds  Yeah  You could still see through that  Those blinds  They're wide open  She knows  And she puts the light on  Like she's kind of like  Making believe that she's  Getting some privacy  So she could get naked  And then she proceeds  To take all her clothes off  And just march around the apartment  She loves being looked at  Yeah  If you put the lights on 
[01:27:30]  Especially when it's kind of dark outside  You put the lights on  You are absolutely getting a look  Inside the apartment  If the lights were off  Or really dim  You wouldn't be able to see  Because you get the reflections  Off the windows  But  Yeah  You know what though  I'll bring you to point before  About perspective  Because like  I'm in my apartment  And that one corner  Has got glass windows  Floor to ceiling  Yeah  And I'm naked a lot  And you really do  Just start to think  That no one's looking  In a way  It sounds like  No I think the opposite Jimmy  Oh you think they're all looking  Yeah from my building 
[01:28:00]  When you're looking out a window  Your perspective is  That everyone can see you  And are looking at you  See I  But the reality is  That you're one of many windows  In a building  Right  Yeah  But when you're looking out  Look out the window right now  Doesn't it feel like  Every window you see  Could see us  And is looking at us  It's a perspective thing  I stop worrying  I don't know  Maybe I  First I did  Because I was like  It was like  It was so hard to like  Do what I wanted to do  On the computer  Because I had no blinds  Or anything  In the middle of the afternoon  Yeah  So I was like  Trying to prop something  Up in front of my desk  So you couldn't look under it 
[01:28:30]  And then after a while  I just  No one's looking at me  No one cares  Ah they're looking  In New York City  They're looking  At some point  Everyone's looking out the window  It is  And if they see something  Yeah  It is amazing  You can look at any building  In New York  And you'll see telescopes  In every other window  Binoculars  In every other window  We went shopping  For our binoculars  Yes  Matter of fact  Last weekend  No not me and you  But  Oh I thought you meant  I thought you meant  I'm talking about  Me and my girl 
[01:29:00]  When we went  When we did go shopping  Though for the binoculars  We did  When we first came to New York  Yes and I was staying  In that hotel for a while  Yeah  We could see a whole  Apartment complex  And we had to get  Our binoculars  You're right  Of course  Yes and that was  Hours of fun  So now you got some  For your apartment  Well now that I'm living  Like a human being  In this apartment  I get to see this building  Right next to me  And we went  And got binoculars  And I'm like  Cool man  This is great  I could you know  Kind of check things out  Yeah  See I want to go 
[01:29:30]  See your apartment  With my chick  But it's like  A part of me  Doesn't want to  Because it's almost  Like I think  One of the things  That keeps her coming around  Is she thinks I'm important  And I don't want her  To go to the apartment  And then just realize  What a lackey she's dating  Well I could like  I could like  Wall off a section  Like put plywood up  So it looks like  Just a big one bed  Yeah okay  I could do that  I could cover some  Of the doorways  The door  The doors  Get a Murphy bed  But here's my dilemma  So we went  And got the binoculars  Together  And she's  Now noticed 
[01:30:00]  That I'm using  The binoculars  So now I got to  Take a picture  Of the binoculars  Where I left them  And make sure  When I'm done  With the binoculars  They're exactly  In the same position  Wow  I'm like  What is this about  We got the binoculars  Together  Just for that reason  Maybe it's the  Kleenex box  Next to them  I'm like  She goes  You were spying  On that building  I'm like  How would you know  Oh the binoculars  Moved  I'm like  Great  Now I got to  Put the binoculars  Back  Exactly the way  I picked them up  Yeah  Take a picture 
[01:30:30]  Of them  Take a picture  Of them  Make sure  Do you look  And go  Okay  I can see  There's a little  Like a paint  Thing there  And put it  Exactly back  Where it goes  But I'm a bit  Confused  Because we bought  Them together  Yeah  But I guess  We got to  Use them together  I don't know  Did she think  You were going  To be looking  At the stars  With them maybe  Well you know  Yeah  No she's not  No she knows  To peep  While she was  At school 
[01:31:00]  I decided  To take a peek  Yeah  What's up Kenny  I was encouraged  Yesterday to use  The binoculars  Oh yeah  See that's what  She used  Because she's cool  Yeah  But for some reason  This one night  She's like  Ah you were  Spying  Well did she  Well yeah  That's why we  Bought these things  Did she just say  That or was she  You know  She wasn't mad  Oh okay  I can't even  I don't think  She's ever been  Mad at me  That's kind of funny  It's like  Oh hey  I know you were  Licking  But it was kind  Of applied  Like I know  What you're doing  While I'm at  Skule  At Skule 
[01:31:30]  Must be nice  For someone  To look across  The window  And see Kenny  With the binoculars  Oh god  Why is Frankenstein  Peaking in our window  Yeah because  She was real happy  To point out to me  That you got these  Like nice new  Powerful binoculars  So I  And I looked  Like across the  Hudson River  Yeah  In Jersey  She's like  No no  Don't look over there  Look in this  Building next door  He probably  Picked them up  And went  Everything looks  So far away  Well the funny thing  Is  Turn them around  Backwards  Of course  Yeah you were  Everything's dark  Lens caps are on 
[01:32:00]  Why don't you get  A telescope  Why binoculars  A little easier  For mobility  You mean  Because I'm not  That creepy  Telescope's pretty good  Because you get  A stable platform  Yes  I think the reason  You don't get a telescope  Because that  Definitely  Puts you in the  Creepy category  Like binoculars  Like ah binoculars  But it doesn't  Telescope  You really  Really thinking  About your  Hobby  You could then  Look up at  The stars  Can you  Dude they got  But I  No  But I saw  A couple telescopes  Where you could  Take pictures  Through the telescope  It's all in one piece 
[01:32:30]  Now  Really  Yeah that's  That's when  You got a problem  I'm thinking  Binoculars  It's like  You know  You're just kind of  Trying to check  Some stuff out  That's all  Problem  My name is  Obi and I like  Watching  I like binoculars  Doug B  Alright  Binoculars  Let's go to Canada  And say hi to Derek  It's been a while  What's up Canada  Hey how you doing man  Hey  I just wanted to  Give a shout out  To the boys  At ONA  And especially  Jim Norton  That guy is my

[01:56:00]  If she doesn't  If she doesn't win  She really  Did something silly  Yeah  There he is  Bret Michaels everybody  Hey  Good morning  Hey Ben  Good morning  What's going on man  I was trying to figure out  What baseball team that is  But it's  Yeah I know  I got it now  Wait sit down there Mike  So we can hear you  He's wearing a baseball cap  That looks kind of like  The Tigers logo  But it's a P  And I was like wait  What team  It's old E  Yeah I got it now  The design 
[01:56:30]  The old E design  That's the font  So  Before we start  We want to do something  A little different for you  Bret  Because you were in here recently  We had our own Roland  Who's just a fantastic singer  And he did a little karaoke  Of Poison for you  Yes  And we're going to listen to that now  Yeah just like a minute  To the first hook  Okay  Here we go  It's rolling everyone  We both lie 
[01:57:00]  Sounding scared  When the dead is a knife  Although we both lie  Close together  We feel  Miles parked inside  Was it something I said  Or something I did  And I was not  Come all right  Though I try not to hurt you 
[01:57:30]  Hang on key  Might be a good thing  But I guess that's why  They say  Every road  Has its thorns  Thorn words  He's singing about Christ  Just like every cowboy  He's a sad, sad song  Every road  Has its thorns 
[01:58:00]  Thorns  Wow  Did he also do the drums?  I give him this much  He knows how to keep up  With the music in the song  Regardless of whatever  Key he's singing  Sure, sure  Notes he's trying to hear  Yeah, the key's not important here  What the important thing is  It's like spoken word  It was very Lou Reed  Wow, yeah  As if I'm third person  Roland, how embarrassed are you?  Yeah, I'm embarrassed  You were just singing his song  I know  And when I sang it 
[01:58:30]  I go  Brett's coming  And I'm sure  I'm going to play in front of him  And I suck so bad  Because I could hear my voice  When I sing  Well, the music covers up  How bad you sucked  So just really fast  We got this version too  We both lie  Selling and stealing  Dead of the night  Oh, acapella  Raw tracks  Although we both lie  Close together  We feel  Miles parked inside  Miles parked  Sounds like Southern  Was it something I said  Or something I did  Did my words not come out right? 
[01:59:00]  It's like New York meets  Atlanta, Georgia  It's like good company  Though I try  But I guess that's why  They say  A rose has a thorn  These aren't outtakes  From my first version  Are they?  Wow  You really improved  Getting good  Scars and Scotch  Calls it  Acapalling  Yeah, boy  Seems a sad, sad song  A little Bob Dylan 
[01:59:30]  A rose has a thorn  A his is thorn  He did the rows  Yeah  That's what I'm saying  How did Bob Dylan  Lou Reed meets something?  There you go, Roland  Neats tone deaf  Actually, he's a big fan  Of that song  Because what?  Your girlfriend  Used to play that  All the time?  He used to play that  All the time  Your ex  Dreaming of having sex  With that man right there  Yes, probably  Trying to figure out  How to get out  Of the relationship  With you  She didn't like me at all 
[02:00:00]  She just wanted to get out  She's like  If I continuously  Play this song  Yeah, maybe it'll  Catch the hint  She was picturing  Sex with anybody  Basically  Basically she thought  You were more thorns  Than rose  Yeah  Yeah, you know  That whole thing  The rose and the thorns  What would Dave  Think about all this?  That's what my buddy  I don't know  It's probably  His forehead is sweating  Yeah  He's just a mess 
[02:00:30]  Creepy  He is now sopped  Big Mussolini head  Looks like Bill's leather couch  This morning  He does  He has a dictator head  A dictator head  But he's a trooper, man  Mr. Dictator head  Gets so nervous  But he still does this crap for us  His Pavarotti is just to die for  To die for  One of our favorites  It's the range  So one of the girls  Got your name tattooed  On the back of her neck there  Yeah, yeah 
[02:01:00]  Heather  Wow  You found the biggest psychos  For this show  Yeah, it was  That's how they cast it  We're looking for psychos  That are even remotely  Interested in Brett  Or someone of that  Stature  Genre  That's freaky, man  When a chick will do that  I'll tell you what  When we went down there  This is a true story  I told her for about a half hour  Which none of it  They aired on the show  I'm like  You don't want to get  This is your first tattoo ever  I said  There's a chance  This is going nowhere  A chance  But you know what I'm getting at  I mean  There's a chance 
[02:01:30]  This could not go anywhere  Yeah  And I said  Man, you know  Someone's going to flip you around  And see that in the back of your neck  That isn't me  Or the next boyfriend  Better be named Brett  But she  I loved her though  Because she was really  When I say this  She was really  A lot of fun  We had some great  Absolutely great times together  But that was a pretty big  All right  He had sex with her  Well, yeah  Well, yes  That's pretty much  He had sex with her  That wasn't good  But it was often  He just underlined his name  He just blew  He just blew the finale 
[02:02:00]  He had sex with her  And he picked the other girl  It's so obvious now  Why do you know everything  It's so obvious  You're not actually  Going to date these girls  After the show's over  Of course I am  It says it in my contract  You have to date these girls  You got to be  Yeah, they got to shoot you  Somewhere together  Just to keep it going  For a little while  Absolutely  And then you're like  Beat it, sister  Stand over by the park  And take a nice walk  You have to have a walk  Along the duck-filled park  I could have girls  Hotter than you  That aren't as crazy as you  Get the hell out of my life  That's not necessarily true 
[02:02:30]  Show over  More unattractive  And more crazy  Is what I'm looking for  Wait, you could have  A threesome  TMZ's reporting  You could have a threesome  And now you're pissed  Could have or did  Wait  Wait, move down there  Rock-a-love porn star  Threesome was one-time deal  Bret Michaels was pissed  When he heard he missed out  On a threesome  With one of his reality show  Contestants  But Brandy tells TMZ  She doesn't do them  All the time  TMZ spotted the  Baby-got-boobs.com star 
[02:03:00]  Britney with Rock of Love  Co-star Heather  Shopping for some  Paparazzi attention  Without being asked  Brandy admitted  She was  The video vixen  Saying it was just  A one-time deal  I just wanted to try it out  See what it's all about  It was an exciting  Fun time  But it's done  Oh, so you did have  The threesome  Yeah  Oh  Well, yeah  Well, yeah  I'm angry I didn't  And now I know  See, I wasn't angry  Until I found out  I could have  And I didn't  Now I'm upset  I'm leaving the show  Thank you for having me  I could have, yes 
[02:03:30]  It may have happened  It may have happened  Brandy was great  I told you  When Brandy left  That's probably  The most upsetting  Of all the  Brandy C was a lovely  Lovely girl  Which one was  Yeah  Was that the one  With the cow  The old one  With the cowboy hat  No, that was  That was Rodeo  The kid, yeah  Yeah, she was great  Yeah, she was cool  She was very sincere  But she was going nuts  I don't think she was  Prepared for the  You know, reality TV  As we talked a little bit  About last time  Is pretty  It's a pretty strange thing 
[02:04:00]  Because it's  It's about  Our show is about  95% reality  And about 5% of just  5% of just  Weird TV insanity  You know what I mean  Because you're  Obviously we did  Everything that's on there  Is really unfolding  But when a camera's on you  24-7  Up until you take a poop  Or a shower  You're pretty much  You know, that's it  You know what I mean  You feel weird  You come out  You sleep  You're watching TV  I'm like  This cannot be exciting  But they build  The whole story around  Whatever else is going on  Besides  What you're doing at that time 
[02:04:30]  Do you literally have to say  That to the camera crew  Like, alright  Taking a dump  No, they follow you  Right up until the door shuts  And then they just wait  Out there  And you're done  Getting sound  You come back  Turn on the water  Oh, I'll be right  Hold on  Tell her I love her  I'll be right at them  Everyone's saying  You've got to pick Jess  She's the effing hottest thing  Yeah, Jess is  Jess is hot  But I  I thought Heather was hot too  It was really  And they're right  I thought what TMZ  Was talking about  Is the end of the show 
[02:05:00]  Because I really wanted  Both of them  To continue  Outside of the  The show that we were filming  To kind of date both of them  And it's a pretty bittersweet ending  To the show  Oh  You killed them  I know  I did  But listen  Bittersweet  I've got about another hour left  Before the show premieres  And then after that  I'm going to jail  And the ratings were good enough  Where after you pick one of these girls  You're going to have to come out  In public  And go  Ah, it didn't work out  So we've got to do it all over again  Quit telling everyone the truth  Second season  Listen, you know the only time 
[02:05:30]  You say that it worked out  You know when it worked out  Is when the ratings tank  Right  You know  Yeah, why would you ever say  It's working out  When you could get a second  To the season  It's likely  Thank you, please  Who knows  Hey, you got the stripper pole  From the house  I see  Yeah, yeah, there it is  Oh, yeah  That was used yesterday  By a 70  Let's just say  75 year old  Ex-burlesque  Well, no  She's still burlesque, I guess  Burlesque dancer  Yeah  Was it good?  I didn't  No  Horrific  She's terrible  She's a fetish  Yeah  That's the best you could say 
[02:06:00]  You better  It's something you need to  It's an acquired taste  It's an E.T. body  Yeah  Oh, hard  I've watched the Crypt Keeper  Dance nude  Yes  It was good  So what you're saying  So on the season finale  What are we doing?  You're going down to Mexico, right?  Yeah  We go down to Cabo  And that was a great trip  Because I could land there a bunch  This is great  Yeah, I've had many, many good times down there  And so we went down  And rode dune buggies  And partied  And went to Squid Row  I've got to throw that in  And good times  What's Squid Row? 
[02:06:30]  It's basically where all the restaurants are down there  And it used to be like two  Okay  And then because it blew up  And everyone kind of discovered it over the years  But it's down where Cabo Wabo  And all the clubs are down there  Yeah, so we had a good time  Went out in a boat  And jet skied  And just had good times  What website was that on about the threesome?  Because like  They're amazed that Bret Michaels might have been in a threesome  I'm still mad about that  I'm still getting upset  Something tells me over the years  It probably happened 
[02:07:00]  Don't you hold the record for the most threesomes by a human being?  It says that on my coffee cup  I was jotting that down on the side of my cup  Yeah, something tells me  It probably happens sometime  Sometime over the years  And didn't we talk about this last time?  It's got to just get boring after a while  Yeah, that  I've never been bored  It's pretty good  Another just  All right, spin around now, sweetie  Oh, God, this sucks  Oh, that move  Oh, okay  That old move, yeah  You know, after this one  That's it 
[02:07:30]  I'm bored with it  I started wearing black sops  And just a cape now  Just to throw some excitement into the  He's probably got something going on in that mind of his  That makes it a little more interesting  Yeah  You get freaky with something every once in a while  I picture me and CeCe fighting at the MTV Awards  They're just something to throw  A little extra kicker in there  Sometimes you chuckle  And they go, what was so funny?  Oh, nothing  I was just thinking  Turn around  Just spin around  Had it with you  Hey, really fast  Before we get off the air here  The football picks 
[02:08:00]  Yes, we do football picks every week  Sponsored by Dish Network  Time to get more TV from your TV  Sign up for Dish Network today  My brother's picks  Or me  Eagles over the Giants  You a football fan there, Brett?  Huge  You're cheating  Who's your team?  I'm the Steelers  Steelers?  We're having a good season this year  Roethlisberger's back  Parker's doing great  Oh, is that the Patriots?  Yeah  Oh, no, the Steelers  Oh, like the real Steelers  The team  Not the Steelers of game  Oh, I was confused 
[02:08:30]  I couldn't hear you  I got too many Super Bowl championship songs in my head  I love how people  Yeah, like we're going to give the rings back  Yeah, but you know what?  There's no Santa Claus  People cheat  You think the Steelers aren't cheating?  Ben Roethlisberger  My dad's been videotaping the other sideline for years  You know, with the old cam  The old 8mm  Yeah  You know, the old film  Every team does that  We've been saying that for weeks now  Yeah, Chuck Knoll  The old coach of the Steelers  Used to have my dad in the 70s  Run over and film their plays 
[02:09:00]  And just  Wow  Really?  He only had two defenses  Prevent and, you know  Are you being serious  Or are you just messing around?  I'm being completely unserious  But you don't know  Everything's true  Except for the lies I told  Right, alright  You don't know  Lawrence Taylor used to send hookers  Exactly  To the other guys  The other team's running backs  Would he really?  Two which were on my show  Two of his hookers were on my show  Yeah  They wouldn't say we're hookers  He would literally find out  Brett's a liar  He would literally find out  He would find out  Like who he was into  Yes  What kind of people they were into  And then he'd call Brett Michaels 
[02:09:30]  A rock of love  See, I bring it back around  I see what you're doing  Yeah, tying it back in  He would send whores to the other running backs  Yeah, like  Say like somebody like  If you were a star running back, Jimmy  He would find women who like to defecate  You know  On a chest  Yeah, on a chest  And they'd send them over to you  And you'd get four yards the next day  Yeah  You have no sleep  So you got the Eagles over the Giants this week  You got the Jets over the Bills  Sorry, Buffalo  You got the Dolphins over the Raiders  Lions over the Bears  Packers over the Vikings 
[02:10:00]  Panthers over the Buccaneers  And Seahawks over the 49ers  Thank you, Dish Network, for the football picks  All right  Hey, I got a question for Brett  Yeah  If you could pull a train with any guy  Right, right  For me, it would be Ozzie  Right  And like a girl  If you could have a threesome with another guy  No gay stuff  Did you even have to add that in?  Well, I don't want to make sure that  Well, that's kind of weird  You could do it with a guy  No rubbing helmets, though  There's no  No  No gay stuff at all  Helmetless contact  Yeah  If you and another guy could say  Share a woman 
[02:10:30]  Without touching each other  Like, who would be the guy you would go  Like, that's my idol  Well, you took Ozzie away from me  Who I love  Yeah  And George Burns is not going to happen  So I'm going to go  I'm going to go with  I'd probably go with Steven Tyler on that one  He seems like he could throw down pretty good  Yeah  You know  I'm an Aerosmith fan  He ties the garb around her neck  Why in the room like that?  Yeah  I wouldn't be  I'm not comfortable with another gentleman  Yeah, I'd say I've never crossed that 
[02:11:00]  No, the threesome thing with the chicks  Like, it's the knee  You don't want to touch up a knee  Yeah  Yeah  I've done that with like four friends  Four buddies I've done that with  What?  Share  Not at the same time  But we're just looking at each other giggling  Yeah, I've done that with a few guys  That's a little weird  You're looking into each other's eyes  With erections  That's there  There's just something  All comedians  I just don't see like what that adds to it  Like it's like  Nothing  It's a goof  It's a goof  It adds comedy  Why do you go to the movies with somebody instead of yourself?  Because you want someone to talk to 
[02:11:30]  It's the lead  Listen, are you Steelers or Raiders?  Who are you taking?  He makes a great point  Yeah  Jimmy's a big Cowboys fan there  Well, Brett, they're going to shut us off here unfortunately  You were late  Was it me?

Yeah, is it really considered rock and roll?  That was my whole point  With things like  And chic  Disco  You know  That's a disco band  Africa Bambata  Yeah 
[02:15:30]  That's rock and roll  Is that rock?  That was like  I mean, that was like  Early  Early urban rap  Yeah  Yeah, I'm not sure that that's  You know, when I picture it  I picture like Skinner  Zeppelin  Stones  Yeah  You know what I mean?  Rush is still not in the Hall of Fame  No, come on  Rush should have been in there  From album one  I don't think Rush is in there  That's ridiculous  Why wouldn't they?  Listen, can I tell you a sad but true story?  Yeah  And I'm not always lying when I say this stuff  Wait, it's a sad story?  It's a beautiful story but sad  My Every Rose Has a Storn guitar  Got inducted into the Hall of Fame 
[02:16:00]  Long before I asked  I was like  Like, I'm standing with it  I'm like  I was like the friend that comes  As the proxy gate  You know what I'm like  With your guitar  They took a picture of me holding it  Yeah  And then made me set it down  And separated me from the photo  Like, okay, get away from the guitar  And it's like five  We were playing in Cleveland that night  There's like 5,000 people  There's a picture on my site  Of all the people  The place is sold out  People are packed in there  To see me  And they're like  Thank you, Brett  You can move to the side now  And just stick the guitar on the wall  You were the fat chick 
[02:16:30]  Who was driving the hot one home  That's me  That's me  That's my life story  That's why I just roll with it  We walked through the Hall of Fame  That's  It's just garbage  Nothing up there  It has to be said  It's garbage  It's like  They went into people's attics  And got some stuff  That most of the stuff  No one gives a shit about  You know, like the real stuff  You really want to see  Are in the hard rock cafes  And in private collections  And this and that  What the Hall of Fame  Has up there in Cleveland  It's not worth going to  I wouldn't go to it  Come on  Britney Spears' jumpsuit  That you wore in there  Yeah, exactly  Well, I put that on  While I was there  But just for a while 
[02:17:00]  And I slipped out of it  Makes a boy feel pretty  It did  Alright, here's a perfect one  Yes, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Who came over this?  Sam  They have Jim Morrison's  Cub Scout uniform  It's like they found  You know, Jim Morrison's parents  And said, just  Could you give us something  For the Hall of Fame  Not the leather pants  From the Lizard King  Thank you, exactly  It's his Cub Scout uniform  That's the best thing  To do for Jim Morrison  How many badges  Were on it, though?  That's the big  Did he get his merit badge?  There's like marijuana  In the pocket  There's a marijuana cigarette  In here, you know 
[02:17:30]  How did that get there?  Big John just sounds  Like he's a problem  Listen, come on  I'm an enabler  What can I say?  Yeah, one of those guys  That if you're hanging out  Within the bar  You know there's just  Going to be trouble  What's a bar?  I've never been  What's a bar?  No, never  I have no idea  John's never been sober  A day in his life  Sober?  What's sober?  And Big John had some good  Scenes on Rock of Love there  Yeah, see  We have been  Besides the fact  Obviously we worked together  We've been great friends  A long time  And John got to  Do some stuff 
[02:18:00]  Finally the one night  I was out  And all of a sudden  I come out for a minute  And he's dancing  On a stripper pole  Now remember earlier on  We were talking about  You know  If you've ever been  In a room  Where your friend's  Doing another girl  Right  I've never been in a room  While John's  Or him with me  We've never crossed that line  It's buddies, right?  But when I walked out  And saw John  In a stripper pole  I've got to tell you something  I was  I was very, very  Taken back  He was actually good  For his 6'7 size  He actually could do  Some pole work  The girls even gave me  A few dollars 
[02:18:30]  What can I say?  The girls were like with him  He had no idea  I was watching  I'd come out  I'd look  And I'm like  It freaked me out  Because he was actually  Doing  How do you  There was a double hand  The spin backwards  The spin  Wait, wait, wait  That probably comes from  Watching a lot of  The cameras over the years  Hold on  We have a stripper pole  We have a camera  We've got to do  At least one move  I know it's going to be  Awkward for everybody  Can I leave the room  Now  You know when  Something disturbs you  Mentally  But it kind of  Turned me on  In some weird  Odd  It's violating  And yet you're  Leaking clear stuff  Exactly 
[02:19:00]  Hey, John  What's your stripper saw?  Oh, God  I have no idea  Just put something on  Good answer  By the way  Very good answer  I have no idea  We're testing you  Yeah  You mean I have  A designated song?  I got all into it  For a minute  I was like all serious  I'm like  Go with walk this way  That's a good one  Alright, now we've got  To walk this way  I was going to do  Some poison  But that's probably  A hack at this point  No, just throw  Some poison in there  Because I've got to  I've got to pay  The cab bill  And if you don't 
[02:19:30]  Pay that  I'm doomed  Play it  Make a little cash  Make a little bing  Everybody get your  Dollars out  Alright  Hey, John  There's the stripper ball  Yeah  Uh-oh  I like how  It's going to the ceiling  So there's a chance  It might tip over  Or unskinny bop  It's not attached  To the tops  So be careful  Alright, here's unskinny bop  Here's Big John  From Rock of Love  We're filming this  For our website  Get the size  He's too big  For the stripper ball  Can I get him a microphone?  Usually the girls  Have to climb up  To that point  He's called  The stripper ball 
[02:20:00]  He is  John's larger  Than the pole  He's up to the ceiling  Oh my god  I'm going to die  His head's hitting  The ceiling  Alright, wait, wait  He did the spin  Wait, he's got one more  Hey, Finn  You got the mic  I'll be amazed  Alright, here we go  John's swinging around, baby  Come on  Alright, here goes Big John  Oh, Jesus  The whole thing's going to break

No, it's a different one  Tell Brent Michael  It's the cat turd  I was telling him  Actually, Mike 
[02:25:00]  Tell me the story  Me and Voss  Picked up this girl one time  And we were both  Fooling around with her  I love Voss  Voss rules  And he's on one side of her  I'm on the other side of her  And we're both jerking off  And Voss was so funny  He goes, all right  Let's slip a coin  Whoever loses has to fuck her  Like he said that to her  And fucking  He's really said this  So he's a real gentleman  That's how he opens up  He's just shit personified  But then he goes  Voss came quickly  And he goes into the bathroom  And I'm still trying  To jerk off and cum  And she had a cat 
[02:25:30]  And the cat shit stunk  In the bathroom  So I hear Voss going  My fucking dick is wilting  Like scalding tea  Had been spilled on  Here's a two loose situation  One, the cat box smells  Like piss and pneumonia  And every, you know  It's the worst odor ever  And two, you're losing  Your heart on  But your buddy  Who was whacked off quickly  Is like a man  Because he's  He got done  And you're wilting  He's done  He doesn't care 
[02:26:00]  He's dumped his load  I pulled another train  With Voss  Jesus, how many times  You have Voss  He ghosted  He was such a fucking  Tactless piece of shit  Like he's banging the girl  He came immediately  She's blowing me  And he's like  All right, I'm gonna go out  And smoke a cigarette  It was so uncomfortable  All right, beat that  I can beat it  But not as well  Of course he can  Hold on, no, no  It's not a better story  I just wanted to add  To the cigarette comment  My virginity  Lost of virginity  Was, you know 
[02:26:30]  We're talking about buddies  It was my three buddies  On a dirt bike  Who remain nameless  Because they're married  And with children now  So I'll leave them  Out of this story  But they're still  My best friends  We took her  In the lovely metropolis  Of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania  Into the woods  By the fish hatchery  All right  We take her  On my dirt bike  We throw the blanket down  And we had stopped  At the Sunoco gas station  For a condom  Now all of us  Grew up together  So we all said  To each other  We're not  We all told each other  We're not virgins  Which we plainly were virgins  Because we'd known each other  Since birth, right  We get into the woods 
[02:27:00]  She lays down  I won't mention her full name  Started with an M  She knows who she is  And she's a little older than us  And going to show me  The ways of the world  And I'm beyond horny excited  My friends say  Because we couldn't do  The touching  Or looking at each other  We were too close a buddy  So they take off  On their dirt bikes  Now I can see them  Just outside of the wood hedge  They're like riding  It's a sunny day  And I'm looking  And the thing's laying down  In the summer  By the fish hatchery  You know so it stinks  She lays down  She lights a cigarette up 
[02:27:30]  I turn around  And put the condom on  Right  Now I'm not saying  And I know this for a fact  I'm just saying  I'm an average  Or maybe slightly above average guy  So I'm looking at the condom  It has the N  Which is a reservoir  I've never used one before  And it's non-lubricated  I'm thinking  Man I must be huge  Because my dick  Ain't going in the top  Of this thing  You know what I mean  And it rips  And I  This is no lie  I turn around  She goes  Is that thing on  I go  Of course  She goes  Alright  You're not lying to me  This is where it all started  For me  I go  I would never lie 
[02:28:00]  About something like that  Now I'm in the woods  With my pants around my ankles  You know my boner  On a summer day  By the fish hatchery  I lay down  She has a cigarette  She leans over  To put it out  I did a two pump chump  And I was not  I'm not making this up  I've never seen  You know  Because I had not  Whacked it before then  Or nothing  It was mesmerizing  The amount of load  The fact  First of all  She never got to  Put the cigarette out  She leaned to turn  To put the cigarette out  I was done  And standing up 
[02:28:30]  And I was looking  We both were staring  At her stomach  Going what  It was like  Four quarts of milk  And then I ran out  And my buddies  My buddies screw me  Both of them split  They never did it  And they just left  And I was left  Holding the  The proverbial  Cigarette-less bag  That's great  True, true story  And listen  My timing has gotten worse  So it's  That's why  My Rock of Love  Sunday premiere  Sunday  Season finale  Season finale  One time I was really sweaty 
[02:29:00]  It was during the summer  And my fucking balls were sweaty  Of course  I'm getting a visual here  This is what's scary  Was Voss with you?

Did you ever see monkey butt?  No  Yeah, it's good  I mean  But it doesn't clog up on you as bad  No, this was just regular Johnson 
[02:29:30]  Thinking it would make my balls smell nice  Fucking Bisquick  It was like pancake batter  Exactly  It's not that I've ever had that  But I've heard  Some boss  The girl's blowing me for a second  All of a sudden she went  My balls must reach  White powder flying out of my mouth  She's asking for some butter and syrup  Disgusting fish  That's horrible  People can't get enough of your voice there, Big John  Fred from Brooklyn wants you to say

She's starting to sneak food  Is he a crier?  Well, how about you stop fucking feeding that thing?  How bad is Mari making the baby?  He rolls up fast  Makes the babies come out without shirts on  Yeah  And this is the thing that makes me laugh 
[02:31:30]  It's supposed to be  And I say this  You know, having two daughters  I understand the kids on there  The mom's upset  Yeah  But there's supposed to be an emotional moment  And I'm like  They're backstage  And we all know what's going on  Listen, take his shirt off  Yeah  I'm not going to get a reaction from the crowd  Lose the top, honey  But then this  Then he goes out there  And tries to be nice to him  Right  Yeah  I feel embarrassed  Remove your shirt  I saw one of these shows  And they bring out a whole table of food  Right  So the kids are just constantly going for the table of food  Oh, God  Trying to have that serious moment  That's perfect  And Maury just sits there  We love Maury  We've had him on this show a couple of times

[03:19:00]  Still in the dead of the night  Although we both lie close together  We feel miles parked inside  Whether it's something I said  Of something I did  Did my words not come out right 
[03:19:30]  Though I try not to hurt you  Though I try  But I guess that's why they say  Every rose has its thorns  Just like every cowboy  Sees a sad, sad song  Every rose has its thorns 
[03:20:00]  Yeah it does  I listen to her favorite song  Playing on the radio  I hear that DJ says  Love's a game of easy come and easy go 
[03:20:30]  But I wonder does he know  He has never felt like this  And I know  That he'd be right here right now  If I could let you  Now somehow  I guess  Every rose has its thorns  Just like every cowboy 
[03:21:00]  Every sad, sad song  Every rose has its thorns  But within a while now  I can still feel so much pain  Like a knife that cuts through the wood heels  But the scar  The scar remains  I knew I could have stayed alone that night 
[03:21:30]  If I can't know what to say  Instead of making love  In both ways  On separate ways  But now I hear you sound somewhat new 
[03:22:00]  And I never meant that much to you  To hear that tease me up inside  And to see me  Could be like a knife  I guess  Every rose has its thorns  Just like every night has a storm 
[03:22:30]  Just like every cowboy  Sees a sad, sad song  Every rose has its thorns 
[03:23:00]  Yeah  I guess we have the guitar  So too  Hey this is Bret Michaels of Poison  And you are listening to the one  The only magnificent  My pal  Lil  Jimmy Norton  I love Lil  Lil  Jimmy  All right  You cunt

[03:36:30]  Nah I wish  Cause I mean  The new studio  Blows this place away  Yeah  And this is a pretty nice studio  We've been in some shitholes over the years  This is pretty nice  But  What XM just built for us  I saw some of it  Holy shit  About a week and a half ago  And I was discussing radio with someone  Of course  Cause that's all I do  And uh  They're penny pinching us  About going to Boston  For their Halloween show  Like they'll only pay for three people  And only for one night  And  And they're now bitching  Cause we want to take a train  Instead of drive ourselves  A train  And it's like 
[03:37:00]  And  And then we walked over  Or I walked over  To see the finished product  Of our studio yesterday  They had to have spent  Millions of dollars  On this for us  The difference between  The two companies  They're bitching about  You know  Saving a little money  So we could get our faces up  To the Boston gang up there  And uh  And XM is  Just throwing money  Out the window  What kind of a thing  Is it in Boston  It's supposed to  It's a party  Is it a band  Or is it music  Or no  It's their Halloween party  They want us to be a part of it  Which is fine  So then we're like  You know  We  They can't get us up there early 
[03:37:30]  Cause they don't have money  For more than one night  And then they only want to  Pay for three people  And they only want to pay  For three people  If we drive ourselves  And  It's just a whole nightmare  This is what regular radio  Is doing to us  And then yesterday  I'm looking at  State of the art  Brand new fucking equipment  That had to cost  Millions of dollars  You gotta come at them  Like that dude  In that opono audio  Yeah  Listen you prick hound  Uh  One more runner up  Line of the day  Here it is  I hate to see you go  Who's leaving  You dumb bitch  What do you mean
