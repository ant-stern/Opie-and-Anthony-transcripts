<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the usual title announcement and introductions, including Jim Norton.  The hosts immediately begin mocking Psy’s "Gangnam Style," dismissing him as a one-hit wonder, and then transition to similarly dismissive jokes about Justin Bieber and Oprah Winfrey.

The bulk of the broadcast focuses on the hosts’ Thanksgiving experiences. Opie recounts a family gathering marred by racial slurs and political arguments, expressing particular disdain for the word "mash" when referring to mashed potatoes. He details his Thanksgiving meal, preferring roast beef to turkey, and shares a humorous anecdote about his brother’s numerous cats.  He also describes his strained relationship with his mother, recounting her bizarre and demanding behavior at dinner, culminating in her abrupt departure before dessert.  The hosts speculate about her potential mental health issues.  Jim Norton details his own Thanksgiving, mentioning seeing his cousin and ex-girlfriend, and then launches into detailed reviews of the movies *Lincoln* and *Skyfall*, critiquing acting, historical accuracy (including the use of the n-word in *Lincoln*), and runtimes. This segues into a discussion of Civil War-era political history.  The conversation then shifts to Black Friday, with the hosts criticizing the violence associated with it and comparing it to other examples of aggressive consumerism.  The show concludes with more food-related discussions and personal anecdotes, including Jim Norton's use of the word "mash," and the return of staff member Iroch.

A segment focusing on old photos from the show's past, sourced from the Twitter account @OA_Photos, follows. Opie, Anthony, and producer Sam review pictures depicting numerous on-air stunts involving nudity, various sexual acts (fellatio, cunnilingus, anal and vaginal penetration with objects), and encounters with guests, some identified as escorts.  Specific individuals mentioned include Montana Gunn (in an ice cube incident), Jim Cook (featured in a teen photo gallery), and Ken Stevens (whose absence from some events is noted).  The hosts express disbelief and embarrassment at the past level of on-air sexual content. Many photos depict multiple nude women engaging in various sexual acts, sometimes involving ice cream and whipped cream. The segment also features anecdotes about various guests and staff members, including Crystal Storm and a producer whose staged photoshoots are described as suggestive of a serial killer. The conversation then diverges to Opie's recent mall trip, his opinions on drivers, the deaths of Hector Camacho and Larry Hagman, and a retrospective on 1980s television shows like *Dallas*, *Dynasty*, *Falcon Crest*, and *Knots Landing*.  A promotion for the audiobook *Fifty Shades of Gay* is also included.


E-Rock then details his Thanksgiving experience visiting his wife's wealthy relatives, which leads to discussions about Disney's purchase of Star Wars,  *The X Factor*, and a young contestant whose performance of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" sparks a discussion of her age and marketability. A listener calls complaining about smaller Jimmy Dean sausage rolls, followed by a series of random audio clips. A substantial portion of the show focuses on a "psychopath test" scenario involving a runaway train, leading to a discussion of the test's psychological implications.  There’s a lengthy segment on Fireman Ed, the New York Jets superfan, and his resignation, which spurs a debate about superfans.  The show concludes with further discussion of the "psychopath test" and other tangents, including brief mentions of the Casey Anthony trial and Martha Stewart.


A segment focuses on college football and Sirius XM host Jenny Hutt's treadmill video blogs, during which the hosts make sexually explicit and derogatory comments about Hutt's appearance and sexual activities. This is followed by a review of various show bits, including a poorly received song about fish and a humorous segment featuring a man interacting with leaves, all punctuated with sexually explicit jokes and racist remarks. Three Rockettes from the Radio City Christmas Spectacular appear as guests, leading to a crude and sexually suggestive conversation focused on their appearance and high-kicks. The interaction ends awkwardly. The remainder of this segment includes the hosts’ holiday plans, work discussions, and sexually explicit banter.  There’s a recurring discussion about obtaining tickets to events like Rolling Stones concerts and Broadway shows.


The final segment begins with a discussion about whether John Mayer is a "douche," transitioning into a discussion of booking guests.  This leads to the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment hosted by Sam Roberts, which heavily features John Mayer's personality. An intern admits to masturbating to John Mayer's music, which Sam Roberts humorously reprimands. There is speculation about Stan's absence from the "Morning Mashup" show. Sam Roberts shares Thanksgiving anecdotes, including his mother's alleged masturbation to Barry Manilow. Mark Zito, a former Ron and Fez employee, joins, defending Mayer's musical talent while acknowledging his personality flaws. The conversation compares Mayer's talent to other guitarists like Jack White and Eric Clapton, debating whether his personal behavior outweighs his musical skill, specifically focusing on his "John Mayer Trio."  The segment concludes with a call to follow various Twitter accounts, including Mark Zito's.

It's a fucking second.  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you want it.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:30]  Gropan Gangnam Style.  Man, I'm style.  Oh, we put this song over the top.  We were just discussing our favorite parts of the song.  Everyone's got a different favorite part.  I like the big buildup and then it just goes dead for a split second.  And then goes into...  I like the sexy lady part.  We put this video over the top.  You know that, right?  Oh, believe me.  And then he just starts talking in some strange language. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, this is a very strange language.  Is this Klingon?  I don't know what it is.  Morning Massive Style.  I remember that.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  This has to be like the biggest non-English American hit.  Gotta be.  Right?  Gotta be.  What else was there?  Police Navidad?  That was pretty big.  I take solace in knowing he's just a loser, though. 
[00:06:30]  He'll never have another fucking song.  Nah, he's just a loser.  Oh, man.  You can't top this.  And he's not getting the sexy ladies.  You know that.  Everybody Gangnam Style again next summer.  Yeah, that's what it's gonna be like.  Let's twist again.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Still Gangnam Style.  Hey, it's those sexy ladies again.  Yes.  Like we did last summer.  Yeah, that's awful.  They try to follow up a monster like this.  Back to Gangnam Style. 
[00:07:00]  Well, he's gotta have another song by now.  If he doesn't, he's stupid.  What's the follow-up?  Gangnam Style, better than ever.  Maybe we should listen to one of his older singles.  Yeah, he's gotta have more.  See if he's got that staying power.  No, I think he has to have another song out.  Yeah, he's gotta.  Or he has the dumbest people behind him helping him out.  Oh, mashup style.  Do we have a Gangnam Style? 
[00:07:30]  No?  No?  If you find it, let me know.  Wow, he's literally a one-hit wonder.  He's not even trying for the second hit.  Why would he?  Anyway, this is what?  The most viewed video on YouTube now?  This would be like fucking Neil Armstrong making a big deal of going to the fucking 7-Eleven.  It's like, he just...  Ah, good for you.  Oh, good, good for you.  Good for you.  So, there you go. 
[00:08:00]  We're discussing that, so we might as well bring it to the air.  Yeah, it's got like 800 and some odd million views now.  It's the most viewed YouTube video.  Just beating out Justin Bieber.  Ah, what Bieber song?  Baby?  Which one was that, baby?  Baby, baby, baby, baby.  You mean Evolution of Dance isn't the number one video anymore?  Oh, what happened?  Well, that guy's gonna have to update his video with the Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  You know he's gonna try.  Oh, God.  Although, I think that guy's really old.  I think that video was around for a while before YouTube. 
[00:08:30]  Because I remember somebody put that guy on a talk show, and they were like, oh.  Oh, wait, you're old.  Wait, you're not the same guy.  You can't do this anymore.  Where's your son?  Right.  I think the Biebs is gonna be on the Oprah, so that should be a terrific fucking interview.  Ooh.  Yeah, the Biebs and the Oprah.  When is that happening?  Very soon.  Clash of the Titans, huh, Dan?  Two people struggling to remain relevant.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that was hurtful.  They are.  It's terrible.  Oprah's doing well. 
[00:09:00]  She's reinventing herself.  I was talking about this show.  Oh, our show sucks.  Our show fucking sucks.  At least Oprah had a fucking good 30-year run.  She did.  We had about a three to four-year good run.  Oh, man.  Out of almost 20.  We, uh, we...  Hey, sexy lady!  This show knew how to fucking...  Burnout?  No, throw it in neutral at the right time and coast.  All right, right.  Yeah, this show finds the hills when we need to.  We're just hoping there's a gas station. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  We gave it a good shot with the throttle for a while.  Because this hill is running out.  That's funny, man.  You know, if you can't laugh at yourself, laugh at the people with mental challenges.  Oh, those are the best.  Nice.  They say the gauntest things.  That's it, I see.  What, uh, what, what happened for Thanksgiving?  Everyone have a good one, or?  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, I had a blast.  Yeah.  Yes.  Went over my aunt and uncles. 
[00:10:00]  Nice.  And friend, Uncle Tony had the whole family there.  So, you know, we all get there, shut the door, and the racial epithets fly like the turkey.  Oh, it's amazing.  Do they really?  Oh!  It's basically a Klan meeting with sides.  It really is.  We were discussing the election for a little while, and, um, oh, boy.  You know.  Wow, really?  Oh, God.  A lot of people not very happy.  You were in heaven.  Well, you know what?  I love my family.  They're like-minded people, and a lot of fun. 
[00:10:30]  No, not offended.  Did you eat the turkey?  Oh, yeah.  I had some of that turkey.  My brother had it.  Some stuffing, some mash.  Oh, mash.  Well, all the basics.  Do you do the cranberry?  Do you do the cranberry sauce?  No, I don't do the cranberry sauce.  I think I hate-  Wow.  Anyone says mash without saying mashed potatoes.  Why?  Yeah, I had some mash.  Why?  I don't know.  It just sounds fucking stupid, and people shouldn't say it.  Really?  Yes.  Is that a big one? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, I had some, you know, hey, can we have a little mash?  Fuck mash.  Throw potatoes in there, you dummy.  You can't just say pass the mash.  No!  You gotta say it like that, too.  Pass the mash.  No!  I hate it.  What about the cranberry sauce?  Ah, some cran?  Oh.  There was a discussion down there in Philly yesterday.  We were having the leftovers.  Yeah.  And I go, hey, you got any of that cranberry sauce?  And I like it in the can where you slice it.  Oh. 
[00:11:30]  It comes out in the shape of the can, even with the little ridges in it.  Yes, of course.  And then the mother-in-law's like, I think I got one more can laying around here somewhere.  And she goes, look, I'm not going to use it for a year, so we might as well, you know,  open it up.  Yeah.  Then I was thinking to myself, why don't we eat that shit all year long?  That stuff is delicious.  Isn't it odd?  That shit is good.  Turkey stinks, by the way.  Every once in a while, you get someone that prepares it properly.  Right, right, right.  It's a bit moist, and it's white.  And if you got the nice gravy, you're good.  None of that dark meat shit.  But in general, we don't eat turkey the rest of the year, because it really does suck 
[00:12:00]  when you have all the other meat choices.  And chickens really fucking can be done very well.  It doesn't take 18 hours to cook the fucking thing.  Yeah.  So, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we broke out the last can of cranberry sauce.  I never eat it, man.  I don't know why I can't enjoy cranberry sauce.  Oh, my God.  You have that with the mash?  The mash?  I'm not going to do it all day now.  It's kind of fun to say.  I know.  You take the cranberry sauce.  You mix it in with the mash?  I was doing it all weekend.  A little gravy, some corn. 
[00:12:30]  Annoying myself.  Just going, yeah, you know, I enjoy a good, you know, just give me a dollop of mash.  Mash.  Ugh, shut up with your mash.  Who said that?  It sounds like Ira.  No, it was actually some guy at Yankee Stadium in the, you know, the legend section when you  get dinner.  Yeah.  And he was pointing at the counter and go, you want to put a little more mash on the plate?  Nice.  That really bothers you?  It bothers the shit out of me.  I really would suggest you do not tweet Anthony Cumia with the word mash. 
[00:13:00]  That would not be nice.  That would not be nice.  But cranberry sauce, I'm going to add that to my diet.  Every once in a while, I'm going to break out a can of that shit.  It's a running gag with my girl, and what I do is I just text pictures of, like, the opening  to mash.  Oh, really?  The logo, the helicopter, and it really annoys her, too.  Too funny.  It's terrible.  My brother did Thanksgiving this year.  We kind of, you know, move it around a little bit from house to house. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, you were like fucking, you're like marauders going from house to house.  Dude, I've been on the road since Wednesday, man.  I just got back last night.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Fucking beast.  Yeah, I went to Long Island, then I went from Long Island to Philly over the Verrazano.  At least it's on the way for you.  So you went opposite ends of the spectrum.  Oh, God.  One big triangle.  Yeah.  Over the Verrazano.  You could see some of the damage from the storm just being on the Bell Parkway.  Oh, really? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, fuck you.  Of course you can, because you're dead stopped.  You could always just look over.  Fucking road.  There were some boats thrown about that you could even see from the highway.  Really?  How the fuck did that boat get there?  Hell yeah.  Anyway, and he's the owner of F.H. Reilly's, of course, in the heart of Huntington Village,  which is doing very, very well.  Oh.  And he did it up right.  He had the turkey all nice and white and moist.  Well, I would hope so, for the love of God.  But then all of a sudden, he breaks out the roast beef. 
[00:14:30]  I'm like, yes, thank you.  Someone finally gets it.  Fucking house with a carving station.  Crazy.  That's what you need.  You do need some roast beef.  Because all the sides are so damn good.  What's missing is a nice piece of fucking meat.  Real meat.  Right.  We all make believe of that turkey and mix it up with the gravy and the mash.  Yeah.  But what that meal really needs is a nice piece of roast beef.  Yeah.  And we had it at his house.  That is why the fuck doesn't everybody do that?  Why isn't that part of the tradition? 
[00:15:00]  I was so happy.  I'd like some roast beef.  Until his cats got me.  What?  They might collect animals.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  They might collect the animals.  You didn't kick one in the liver, did you?  Oh, no.  You've got to protect that meat.  I know how up he gets.  Him and his wife.  Yeah, you're right.  Look out.  The prime rib.  Oh, please.  And him and his wife will not tell me how many cats they got.  And you couldn't count them?  I counted five.  Oh, shit. 
[00:15:30]  Which means it's probably ten.  Probably.  And, you know, the opes are very allergic to cats.  Hoarder?  Hoarder?  How many cats?  Borderline hoarder?  They won't tell us.  They won't tell anybody.  They won't tell anybody.  They have two dogs and a lot of cats.  They won't tell?  They're animal people.  You know, those, no offense to my brother, but those crazy people that like to try to  save every single animal they see.  So they take them in.  They usually take them in, fix them up a little bit, and send them on their way.  But I think they got a few extras laying around, hiding here and there. 
[00:16:00]  Are they spayed and neutered?  Oh, yeah.  And she keeps a very, very clean house.  Yeah.  But, man, when that sun went down, we had to go inside after playing the basketball,  the wiffle ball, and the football.  A little sniffly?  Holy fuck.  Me and a few of my relatives, because we all have the shitty fucking immune system.  So that was a little rough, unfortunately.  Even when people say, no, it doesn't shed, or no, I take care of it, no, no. 
[00:16:30]  There's that part of the day where the light is shining through a window, and you just  see every hair and fucking speck of shit in the air, and you're like, I'm breathing this  in.  And all you have to do is take your fingertip, touch the rug, touch your eye.  Oh, my God, I'm now allergic.  Yeah.  That was insane.  I needed a teller.  Why does it take such a little bit of it?  Fuck.  I don't miss my stupid cats.  Oh, I introduced my mom to my daughter, finally. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  How'd that go?  She liked talking about milk glass more than my daughter.  Milk glass?  Milk glass.  I guess it's a type of glass.  Oh, it's like a glass that's got some white kind of...  It's very white.  It almost looks ceramic, but I guess...  There it is.  There's milk glass.  She had way more excitement talking about milk glass than my daughter. 
[00:17:30]  Milk glass.  What happened?  What'd you...  Because my brother took, like, I guess, one of these serving dishes from my parents' house.  He put some mash in it?  As a keepsake.  Oh, we went with the potato chips and the onion dips.  Oh!  Which is a staple in the Hughes household.  You have to have the onion dip with the potato chips.  Oh.  Fat.  Chips.  That doesn't sound good.  Chips.  Fat.  Fat.  No.  Oh, no.  Chips.  Stuck in a loop.  Chips.  What's that? 
[00:18:00]  Chips.  I hear something.  Chips.  Who's calling me?  Chips.  Hello?  Who would that be?  Chips.  Someone is calling me.  Chips.  We could do this till 10 o'clock.  I would love it.  Oh, boy.  I would have fallen to a chip loop.  Would we gain listeners or lose every single one?  Hmm.  I don't know.  It could go either way on that one.  Could.  If you tune in two hours later, we're still going chips.  What's that?  We would lose them.  We would lose them, but they would tune back in just to hear if it was still happening. 
[00:18:30]  It's like when you check your light when the power's out.  Well, I...  So you go over there.  You have your daughter, of course.  Oh, God, dude.  It's just like...  I've been having some...  A little guilt lately.  Wondering if I'm doing the right thing with my mom.  And, man, when I went to Thanksgiving, I realized, no, I'm right on track where I need to be.  Really?  I plunked my daughter down right in front of her.  She did say, wow, Greg, she's beautiful.  And that was pretty much it.  Oh.  And then I tried to get a picture with her and my daughter, and she wouldn't... 
[00:19:00]  What?  She wouldn't take the picture.  Wait, wait, wait.  What picture?  She doesn't like pictures.  Oh.  She doesn't like pictures.  All right.  And then I put the baby in her arms, and she started like, I'm going to drop her.  I go, I'm right here.  Nothing's going to happen.  Yeah, relax.  So I go, relax.  And then she finally said, take the baby.  Ooh.  Was that the awkward part of Thanksgiving?  I just took the baby and walked out of the room, and that was it.  That was the interaction she had with her new grandchild. 
[00:19:30]  That'll be it.  That's fine.  That's it.  Yeah.  And then we were sitting around, and she was really into talking about milk class.  Way more than my daughter.  I don't even think she asked her name.  Wow.  Now that I think about it, I don't even think she asked her name.  Yeah, she did.  Boy, that's something to be reckoned with.  Huh?  That's something to be reckoned with.  Not really.  Not when you're an old fuck like myself. 
[00:20:00]  You just deal.  Maybe when I was in my 20s or something.  I don't know how you do it now.  I'm not sitting around feeling sorry about that shit.  I got my own family.  And I got people that are beyond cool to me and my family and kids.  That's how you deal with it.  And then she wanted to go home, and she picks the guy that's throwing the whole party to drive her home.  Your brother?  And he goes, look, man, I can't drive you home because, you know, I'm trying to serve dessert for everybody.  Oh, no. 
[00:20:30]  You know, I got 30 people in my house, and I got to serve the dessert.  And I got to clean up the mash.  So what happened?  And so then she asked my brother.  She's annoyed at him because he won't drive her home because she has no concept that he might be busy.  That's what's amazing about this whole.  She has literally no concept.  I could see it in her eyes.  She has no fucking concept that the guy she asked to drive her home is really fucking busy at that moment. 
[00:21:00]  No concept.  So then looks at my other brother, and my other brother said the wrong thing.  He actually said, yeah, I could drive you home, but I'm feeding my three-year-old.  So after I feed him, I'll be able to drive you home.  Why is that the wrong thing?  That sounds reasonable.  Yeah.  Because it's not happening right at that moment.  Oh.  Because she has no concept that maybe a father needs to feed his three-year-old because she's on the same mental fucking level as a three-year-old.  So then all of a sudden she gives him a look, and then the kid takes a bite and runs out of the room. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, boy, was that bad.  Because then she turned around and she goes, you're not feeding him.  Wow.  So then he goes, he ran out of the room.  He's chewing his food.  I could see him chewing his food.  So then she moves on to my next brother and goes, I don't want to mention names, but she goes, he, meaning, you know, his name, said he would drive me home, but he said he's feeding his kid, but he's not feeding his kid. 
[00:22:00]  Can you drive me home?  Wow.  I'm getting angry.  Yeah.  The only reason I bring this up, I swear to you, don't feel sorry for me.  I'm way past this.  But I know other people deal with this.  That's the only reason I bring it up at this point.  So then everything has to stop.  And then the brother that was feeding the kid, because now I'm like, I'll fucking drive her home.  I don't give a fuck.  Because I was going to record her for the radio, actually. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, boy.  I had my SoundCloud ready and everything.  Oh, boy.  And then my brother who was feeding the kid goes, no, I will.  And she marched out of the house without really saying goodbye to anybody.  Wow.  Right in the middle of everything, though.  Literally right in the middle of everything.  The game is on.  Well, that's the whole thing.  Dessert is being served.  That's the M.O.  Like, it's not the end of the night by any stretch of the imagination.  There's easily another hour and a half to go.  Easily.  The entire family should absolutely just cut communication. 
[00:23:00]  With any person doing that, 100% of a communication sever.  It's all, it's just completely exhausting.  The fact that she has no concept is what's the most amazing thing about the whole thing.  Then there's the side that would go, you know what?  You got to love people even though they're messed up.  Like, maybe I'm looking at it wrong.  Like, you have to.  Look at your mom.  It's easy for me to say.  Ah, fuck that.  Fuck that at this point.  Like I said, I was wondering lately.  And then when I saw her, I'm like, oh, yeah.  Okay.  No, she reminds me all the time that I'm absolutely doing the fucking right thing. 
[00:23:30]  Sometimes you got to cut these people off because they continue to do their damage.  There just has to be some kind of self-awareness.  There has to be.  You know, she enjoyed talking about the milk glass.  There you go.  It just sounds like someone needs to have attention from everybody.  And the best way to do it is to throw a monkey wrench in the middle of the works.  Well, last year she was at the top of the stairs in my other brother's house screaming at everybody to drive her home. 
[00:24:00]  At least we didn't get to screaming this year.  Wow.  What exactly is it?  Like, has it been diagnosed?  Is it like extreme narcissism or is it?  No, I think what happens, she gets a thought in her head like I want to go home and that's it.  That's it.  She's got OCD.  That's just a really extreme.  She's got OCD and other shit, I'm sure, which I don't really even want to know about.  But I think the thought gets in her head and then she's like, all right, I got to go right now.  I got to go right now.  I got to go right now. 
[00:24:30]  I got to go right now.  That's all she hears.  I got to go right now.  I got to go right now.  I got to go right now.  Regardless of consequence to anybody else or any of that stuff.  Oh, she don't give a fuck.  Wow.  And she always asks the person throwing the party because she's at their house, I guess.  They're busy throwing a party.  At least this house was close to where she's living.  Wow.  It usually happens when we're way the fuck out east.  You know how many holidays I left back in the day because she wanted to go home right  in the middle of it?  I missed dessert at Thanksgiving a few times because I was the one that had to drive her 
[00:25:00]  home.  Get a car service.  We probably should have.  Yeah, just get her a car.  It's going to cost you a couple hundred bucks and no one has to do it.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're going to go down there, if she's going to come and say, hey, we get  you a car.  It's just ridiculous.  Fucking ridiculous.  But my kids have really cool grandparents on the other side.  So they'll have what I have.  I didn't have fucking grandparents on one side at all.  I didn't want them either.  You know, the famous precious lady.  Yeah, yeah.  That broad.  That broad.  Who was way worse than my mom. 
[00:25:30]  And then I guess hopefully I won't be as bad to my kids and then eventually, hopefully  it'll be, you know, normal people.  Yeah.  It'll take another generation or two because I'm sure I'll fuck up my kids somehow because  I had a weird mom.  But I'm on high alert.  Yes, be on alert.  Oh, I am on high alert.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't yell at my kids or nothing.  They're going to get away with murder, I think.  Wow.  Besides that, it was a great Thanksgiving.  That made me angry for you.  Every year you make me angry for, I'm angry for your family. 
[00:26:00]  That is like.  I just bring it up because I know people deal with this shit.  Like when you have like, when you have a family member that God forbid has cancer or  any of these other horrible illnesses, you look at them, you're like, oh, okay, they  do what they do, whatever, because look what they're going through.  But when someone has mental illness, they sort of look healthy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's what is like, that's the dilemma.  Like, what the fuck?  Why do I have to deal with this? 
[00:26:30]  Why is she allowed to just, you know, fucking throw, like you said, the monkey wrench into  our family constantly?  God.  Constantly.  This was a daily thing, though, man.  Now it's just every once in a while when I see her.  There's always a problem.  Always an issue.  Every time, right?  Something.  Always.  And it's the dumbest, stupidest thing.  Like, she's probably still mad that no one drove her home right away.  And she probably only waited 15 to 20 minutes tops. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  But I guarantee she's livid wherever she is right now.  Livid about it.  It's just waiting for a dumb ride to go home.  Wow.  Did you see all your brothers were there?  Yeah, everyone was there.  Okay.  Cool.  It was fun.  Just avoid that part of the house and you're good.  Where'd you go, Jimmy?  Enough about my shit.  I honestly didn't do much.  I saw my cousin Bob and his wife, Kelly. 
[00:27:30]  What's at Bob Kelly's house?  Oh, yes.  I'm sure they do it upright.  They did.  His wife cooked the shit out of the turd.  It was really good, man.  Wait, it's just you three?  And Kelly from his podcast.  Oh, yeah.  She's cool.  Yeah, she's a sweetheart.  I beat her up, but she's a cool lady.  She's great.  Yeah, yeah.  She's really nice.  We pigged out.  And then I saw my ex was in town, so I saw her for three days.  We just went out and ate.  And it was fun to see her.  Any?  No, we're just friends.  I mean, but I'm glad we're friends. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Like, I'm really happy that she's still one of my favorite people alive.  Then we went and saw Lincoln.  Lincoln.  I heard Lincoln was a little fucking long, man.  A little too preachy and a little too much like a documentary.  A little too long, so was his tenure in office.  I heard it was sort of like being in school at some point.  It was long, but the acting in it was fucking.  I saw your tweet.  Daniel, it's just embarrassing how good he is.  Like, the guy is so great every time he decides to act. 
[00:28:30]  Sally Field.  But did he act like he was happy about what happened?  But, you know, he gives you a real grasp on, like, Lincoln.  And it's like, you know, it's hard to humanize these people because they're so iconic.  It was so long ago, yeah.  But he made Lincoln a real person.  And Sally Field was the crazy wife.  Mary Todd Lincoln?  Yeah, but she gave, like, a real personality, like a crazy personality to her.  You know, they were grieving their one kid had died in the war.  Right.  So she was a bit cunty about a lot of things and psychotic and really fucking good man. 
[00:29:00]  Tommy Lee Jones was in it.  He was amazing.  Some abolitionist he played.  I heard they don't show the fucking shooting.  They don't.  What the fuck?  Well, I guess you kind of know what happens.  But what is the point there?  The way they showed it, well, I don't want to say it, but they, of course, address it.  Right.  But I was wondering why they didn't.  And they probably felt they just didn't need to.  I kind of wish they would have, too.  It was like Spielberg just made that artistic decision. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, God.  It's not about you.  I think you have to show that.  Yeah.  You don't have to, like, spend a shitload of time on it, but you got to show it somehow.  No?  Yeah, give us the happy ending.  Right.  But he really wanted.  Lincoln was a good man.  Like, they really show him as a good man.  Like, everybody knows what he freed the slaves.  But it wasn't just a move, a strategic move with the war.  It really wasn't just that.  He genuinely wanted to do it.  And he genuinely, they said he almost, it almost looked as if they were, they said the 
[00:30:00]  Confederates were sending up people to broker a peace.  They wanted to stop the war.  And if the word got out that these guys were on their way, this measure, this 13th Amendment  never would have passed.  Yeah.  Because the South would have said, we have to keep our slaves.  We will not sign this.  So if they were coming to make peace, then there would be no reason to free the slaves.  You know what I mean?  Because the peace was going to be made or whatever.  But Lincoln almost, they said, kind of delayed talking to them until the vote was taken on. 
[00:30:30]  And I don't know how much of that was done for the film.  But it seemed fairly, like, it kind of stuck to history.  Well, didn't he also have, there were a bunch of ideas batted around.  Did they address the idea that he wanted to free slaves but then return them to Africa?  No, they didn't.  Oh, right.  I read that.  They didn't.  You read that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I read it on a website.  Oh.  Was it a good movie?  Yeah, really good.  I mean.  Was it slow? 
[00:31:00]  Slow, yeah.  But the acting was so good.  Like, just watching this guy, I'm like, I can't believe that somebody's this good at that job.  Did you feel like you were actually watching Lincoln?  You really do.  I said to my ex a couple times, I'm like, he looks exactly like that fuck.  Exactly like him.  Nice.  I mean, fucking, um, because you're always so used to Gregory Peck, you know what I mean?  The four score, an idiot.  You know, the way these actors do this deep voice shit.  That overacting crap.  And he just, I guess they said he read somewhere that Lincoln had a weirder voice and he just 
[00:31:30]  did it how he thought it should be, like a regular guy.  Right.  And he played him like a, they always say play the man, not the uniform.  You know, like when you're, uh, when you're acting, like, you know, if I audition for  the part of a cop, of course, you know, I don't know what, I'm not a cop, so I try  to be Joe cop, you know, hello, badge, badge, hat, badge, hat, gun, you know, instead of  just being Jim, who's in that uniform.  Yeah.  And that's the genius of this guy is he's so great.  But how do, how do they know his voice was a little higher?  I guess it was written about.  That could be some asshole that didn't like Lincoln and goes, nope, he had a really whiny, 
[00:32:00]  high voice.  He starts playing the part.  So, first card, seven years ago.  And we saw, um, what else did I see?  I also, oh, good.  No, no, no.  I heard that there were like 45 minutes of previews before the movie started.  What?  That it was completely out of hand.  There was some, I don't remember if it was long or not.  Oh my God, I heard that.  So some people are saying they were in the theater for well over three and a half hours.  Yeah, we did.  Actually, there were long previews. 
[00:32:30]  But anyway, go ahead.  Did they show any Civil War action?  In the opening scene, it's like, you know, like Saving Private Ryan.  Saving Private Ryan.  There was only a couple of minutes of it.  But I'm going to tell you, the Civil War stuff they shot, you're like, oh, that was a down  and dirty fucking war, man.  They didn't fuck around.  Really cool.  They're showing them fighting in the mud.  They're fighting in like just fucking like knee deep mud.  It's hand-to-hand combat.  Brutal stabbing.  And they showed a couple of guys just getting their faces stepped on in the mud like a Union 
[00:33:00]  soldier or Confederate soldier boot in the face being driven under the water in this gross  and you're like, wow, that is so not like the little toys I had pointing perfect guns  at each other.  This was a bloody fucking up close ugly war.  But they really humanized Lincoln, which again, you know, I'm always amazed when they show  home videos of John F. Kennedy because he's just become this Zapruder film, this moment  in history.  And Lincoln is just this guy on the $5 bill or this guy who freed the slaves and you forget 
[00:33:30]  that he just had to deal with his cranky wife and he had to finagle and get shit done  the way politicians do.  And you realize like he was a politician and he was, he had to get, they had to, oh, James  Spader was fucking great.  Really?  Great.  He's a good actor.  Every time he's good, man.  He's good in everything.  Come back though.  He hasn't been in much.  He, uh, you forget that it's him.  He's doing one thing where he's talking to Daniel Day-Lewis.  Like he's, he's one of the, I think the senators or the congressmen, they had to go out and 
[00:34:00]  bribe people to get votes.  They were 20 votes short.  And everyone forgets the Republicans were the ones that did this, not the Democrats.  Um, they had to get 20 Democrats and, uh, just Spader was so good.  So good.  Oh yeah.  Look at him.  Isn't it true back then the Democrats had the ideology of what the Republicans have now  or something like that?  And they, they kind of switched.  They kind of did.  Yeah.  They were the more liberal party.  Do you know that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did that change?  The Democrats are the ones that, um, they didn't want, uh, slavery abolished. 
[00:34:30]  They fought it hard.  Right.  New Jersey voted against it.  A bunch of Northern states voted against it.  And even, um, into, uh, into the 1900s with segregation and whatnot, you know, even then  the, the Republicans, uh, were more open to it than, than the Democrats were.  He said that he wanted, I think one of the reasons was, was it's not mentioned, slavery  is not mentioned in the constitution.  Oh, then there was a, the problem was that's amazing.  Like you're looking at that.  This is our country, but they were arguing. 
[00:35:00]  One of the, the things was one of the abolitionists was very much, and this was Tommy Lee Jones's  character.  It's something Stevens, he played, believed that blacks should be able to vote and that  they were equal people in the eyes of God.  But you could not indicate that you felt that way.  It had to be only before the law or you would have lost that vote.  Like, and they were trying to get him to slip and cause the whole press was there and they  said that, uh, they're going to get, they're going to find a way to get you to say, you 
[00:35:30]  know, you can't say that, uh, you think blacks are the same and should be voting.  What's next women?  And then it was like, um, but the thing was, they were afraid that he was going to go.  Yeah, I think blacks should be able to vote and they are equal people.  It was only before the, the eyes of the law.  So it was so weird that you couldn't even slip and say that.  And this is the 1860s.  Like, I know it's ancient history, but it's really not. 
[00:36:00]  This is not Alexander the Great.  This is not the fucking Roman empire.  Right.  Yeah.  It's 150 years ago.  What, uh, any N-bombs in the movie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A couple.  Not, I'm sure they, I'm sure they toned it down.  Uh, you know, obviously I'm guessing it was a PG movie.  But it was weird to hear nigger said in a movie, like, and you had to for historical.  That's my home movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  You see Anthony giggling as a child and, you know, that's just, you don't even see who's  saying it's just coming, but there's a beach scene, there's a seagull, and you hear fucking  N-bombs flying. 
[00:36:30]  The Kumia household was not a peaceful one.  But yeah, it was weird to hear it said, but you realize it's in historical context and  you had to.  It would have seemed weird.  It's jarring to hear it in a movie now.  Was it only the bad people in the movie saying it?  No, it was said fairly.  Because it was kind of, back then it was more accepted as a, you know, that's what you  called people.  James Spader said it at one point.  Um, and he turned out to be one of the guys helping Lincoln.  So no, it was, it was more like, I forget what he said. 
[00:37:00]  I'm kind of glad they did that.  Yeah, I was too, because it was like, you know, again, they didn't overuse it.  Like, you knew that they probably could have used it a lot more to be historically accurate.  Yeah.  Could have been every other word.  But then it would just be distracting.  It would have been distracting and it wasn't necessary.  Yeah.  I mean, uh, but when you-  They made their point?  They made the point.  They showed you that they were, that this was being true historically.  That word was thrown around a lot more freely.  What you realize too is the access people had to the president.  Like, there's scenes where Lincoln's with his son, his, his, his, his adult son. 
[00:37:30]  Whatever happened to that guy?  Does anyone know?  Well, he had two-  I like knowing that shit.  I did too.  I Wikipedia'd one.  Oh, you did?  He had two kids.  Um, he had an adult son who really wanted to go into the army because the, the older one  had been killed.  And he's like, if I don't go fight, I'm going to regret this for the rest of my life.  And his eight-year-old son, Ted, who I guess had a, had like a tadpole.  And that was why they nicknamed him Ted.  One made, uh, one went on to make, uh, uh, cars and the other to make logs. 
[00:38:00]  Whatever happened to his kids?  Did they have a, uh, an important life or just a regular?  I don't know what happened to the older one.  I know Ted, because I looked him up, was, uh, died when he was 18.  The younger son, who he concentrated on and showed a lot of in the movie, um, went overseas  after he was assassinated, went on to, uh, I guess go to England for a couple of years  and he got to, they might've said it might've been tuberculosis, but he died when he was 
[00:38:30]  18 and the mother was, they said inconsolable.  She couldn't travel because she had lost one son in the war.  You know, again, that was just what I read.  Right.  But I, I also, uh, off the subject, looking up old footage, it just reminded me, I was  watching about Kennedy assassination.  I watched like a two hour block of like CBS that day and they had, they showed Walter  Cronkite, his entire, can we only see that one moment where he's, uh, where he's like,  uh, at, uh, 1 PM central time, two o'clock Eastern time. 
[00:39:00]  Uh, and it's such a great moving moment, but there's a lot more of that.  Like you could see Cronkite for a lot of that broadcast struggling not to cry.  It was fucking.  Wow.  And there's one moment where he goes, uh, to update you the tragic news, uh, president  Kennedy has been assassinated and to hear those words, it was such a fucking, it was  cause you don't hear that in the, in the version that we always see.  It was such a, and again, I hate to use the word jarring again, but it was such a powerful  thing to hear a guy say.  And that was the real part of history. 
[00:39:30]  The bluntness of that was so final and so awful.  You had a presidential weekend.  I did.  I don't know why I watched that.  I watched that beforehand.  I think it might've been last week.  And there's connections between the two, uh, assassinations aren't there.  Oh yeah.  Those Lincoln Kennedy coincidences.  Wow.  By the way, uh, a few people, uh, writing and calling saying the previews, uh, started  at 815 for this guy and the movie started at 847.  Wow.  That's 32 minutes. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  About a half hour.  Did, uh, did your ex go with you?  She did.  Yeah.  She has some comments.  Well, she, she actually, she thought it was a little slow, but she liked, cause she's  in that business.  So she, she liked, she liked it.  Um, and by that I mean interracial.  She makes a couple of porn.  We also saw the night before we saw Skyfall.  Oh yeah.  In IMAX.  Not as good as I thought it would be, but it was good.  Daniel Craig, I think is a great, uh, he's a great Bond.  Yeah, he makes a good Bond.  Javier Bardem was an interesting bad guy. 
[00:40:30]  I didn't love the story on this one.  Yeah, yeah.  I agree with that.  I thought it was a little, a little slow.  I thought he was a good bad guy because, and Bond bad guys are supposed to be a little  weird and fucking flamboyant and cartoony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His wig was horrendous.  Horrible.  It was so bad.  I thought, Tommy Lee Jones has a horrible wig in Lincoln.  Horrible.  And, uh, we were joking about it.  She's like, that fucking wig is awful.  But in the end, he acknowledges it's a wig.  You know, cause back then they all wore shit wigs, so. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  They don't, it's, they, they, you act like it's really Javier Bardem's hair.  Yeah.  Um, I, I, I thought it could have been a lot better.  I did not love double, uh, uh, Skyfall.  Wow.  I thought it was good.  Did you like the song?  The Bond song by Adele?  Yeah, it was good.  It was good, but there was a weird moment.  Yeah.  Skyfall.  That voice is butter.  That's butter.  But I didn't, um, and we, I was debating, Amy, Amy went to see, uh, 
[00:41:30]  I almost went to the third movie, but I couldn't have another thing of popcorn.  Wow.  That's why, and I had to spot, but to see the, uh, the De Niro book,  the playbook, Silver Lining Playbook or something, which I heard was,  did you like it?  It was alright.  I heard it was good and.  The what?  Silver Lining Playbook or something, right?  Yeah, it was the one that Chris Tucker was in here promoting.  Oh, that guy.  It's kind of, uh, remember that.  Barely.  Um, with De Niro and who else?  De Niro was good in it.  Uh, Bradley Cooper.  Yeah.  And Jennifer Lawrence from The Hunger Games.  They play, like, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have bipolar. 
[00:42:00]  And they fall in love or whatever, but it's very, ugh, shiny.  Why did you go to that?  It's like a comedy.  What a fag.  What are you doing?  It's a comedy.  Go to a real movie.  Like what?  Skyfall?  Lincoln.  Skyfall.  Fucking.  Sold out.  You should see Lincoln.  I will.  You should.  You owe him, half of you owes him a lot.  I want to see Lincoln.  Yeah, I, again, just as.  At this point, I would love to see any movie.  Oh, God.  Oh, really?  How is it to see movies?  Tell me about it, please.  It's a miracle.  It's amazing.  Is it nice still?  Yeah, it's so nice. 
[00:42:30]  Fuck.  It's awesome.  Kind of funny.  Good babysitter.  Seats are getting better in the movie theater.  Dude, they were fucked.  I'll tell you off air where I went, because there was one theater I went to, which is not  a lot of people go to in the seats.  Why am I not going to say it on air?  Like, what, 5,000 people?  I just caught what a dummy I am.  And you're not even going to go there anytime soon.  Battery Park Theater.  Bobby Kelly recommended in Battery Park in Manhattan, Lower Manhattan.  And the seats go way back.  It was very comfortable.  And that's a weird area of the city.  That part of the city shuts down. 
[00:43:00]  There's a brand new Hilton there, apparently, from like six months ago.  It's really, it shuts down, though, man.  It gets really creepy at night.  Was the theater packed?  No.  And neither was Skyfall.  I thought Thanksgiving was going to be mobbed, and Bob said no, and he was right.  And then I'm like, dude, it's a fucking gang weekend.  That's why I won't, but I thought, I was thinking of Easter weekend, which is the one  where there's always the gang initiations at Easter weekend.  Oh, right, isn't it?  It might be Easter.  Down on 42nd Street, there's always like gang violence, because the gangs have these  weird initiations they do on this one night.  I think it's...  How about they knock it off? 
[00:43:30]  I couldn't agree more.  Let's stop that.  Just stop it.  Please.  It's like fucking, it's like when you look at Black Friday, people just trampling each  other for fucking discounts.  I was just watching the videos.  For shitty stuff, right?  It's so stupid.  And I'm like, fucking, these people are animals.  And by that, I mean just anyone shopping like that.  But then I'm like, is really, am I just jaded because I make good money?  Like, is it really that hard to get your kid a good gift that people are worth?  I think it's just become a thing to do.  Maybe.  If you read Facebook postings and stuff, people are like, oh, well, waking up early to go 
[00:44:00]  to Black Friday.  They just want to be part of something.  You could get any of that shit online for a very comparable price.  They just want to be part of something.  Like, yep.  Just so they have something to write about on their Facebook page.  Getting up early, got my Starbucks, going to Black Friday, waiting online.  Been waiting online.  I mean, why?  There's no reason.  Walmart is in trouble, too.  They had a fucking death in the parking lot.  Some guy stole two DVD players.  I guess the cops said he had been put in a chokehold.  Oh, yeah.  Really? 
[00:44:30]  It's like, man, I don't care what your merchandise is.  You cannot hold a guy by the neck in the parking lot.  Yeah, store security put him in a chokehold.  And I get they're trying to do their job.  Look at this.  Why would you do this?  I have no comprehend.  Do we got sound?  I want to hear the eeking and eeking.  He's going to have a very crowded store.  Who came up with this dumb idea? 
[00:45:00]  Well, it started out as a good idea, but now it's just an event every year.  Yeah.  Now it's just a dumb event.  People, I think most people realize they're not even saving that much money.  No.  Just that whole mentality, you've got to be part of something.  Look up the fist fight.  These guys had fist fight over sneakers.  Over sneakers, yeah.  White guys, too, I must acknowledge.  Yes.  But it was still good to see these guys just duking it out in the mall.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing?  Getting punched in the face.  Then there was like a near riot in a mall, and that was a bunch of black guys. 
[00:45:30]  And they were just throwing shit off of the, like throwing garbage pails off at the top level of the mall.  At each other?  At the mall and beating the shit out of the shit on the floor.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the cops came in with German Shepherds.  It was hilarious.  Jesus.  Yeah, I love this shit.  Where was that?  Was it like a...  Urban.  Some urban mall.  Like the north and south, or...  I think it was the...  Was that Michigan?  Maybe.  I might have seen some of that.  There was another one in Baltimore, too.  When we did the homeless shopping spree, our people were...  It was wonderful. 
[00:46:00]  No problems at all.  Way more well-behaved than these Black Friday videos that are coming out today.  Stupid Black Friday.  It's a joke.  It really is ridiculous to think that people go through this violence to get...  And you're right.  You can order it online.  You're right.  Online.  You get it for just as cheap.  Pretty much.  It's stupid.  It's just a thing.  It really is...  I'll say it again.  Stupid.  Make your point ten times, idiot.  I do the same thing, though.  I just...  I don't know what...  I just want someone to acknowledge I'm making a good point. 
[00:46:30]  No, but it's not...  And these idiots out there, they can't talk back.  I do it, too, man.  I'm like, what am I afraid of not being heard?  They heard me.  They speak English.  But I do the same thing.  My father would do that.  I love my father, but he'd make the same...  I'll take a good container of coffee.  You know what?  Nice cup of coffee.  I'm like, Dad, I understood container of coffee, man.  Right, right, right.  But I do it, too.  Yeah.  Just reiterate.  Oh, yeah.  I fall.  Just get...  I fall.  Listen, I'm going to say that. 
[00:47:00]  Butter.  I'm going to say that one again, too.  Our voice is like, butter.  You know why I'm so sore today?  Kettle bells.  Because yesterday was a kettle bell day!  A Sunday.  It's a kettle bell day!  Whoa.  I need to get to the gym today.  Today's a kettle bell day.  Really?  Achy.  Did he eat a lot?  Today, kettle bell.  No, I didn't really eat a lot.  My downfall is I'll eat pretty good around the holidays.  I won't pig out too much. 
[00:47:30]  And then they break out the pies.  God damn it!  Apple pie is delicious!  Gotta love a good pie.  My apple pie pieces are just disgustingly huge.  Half the fucking pie.  Oh, God.  I had one bad day.  I'm like, what are you doing?  You just ate well all day.  You avoided all the dumb shit.  And then you fucking ruined it with a big piece of apple pie.  And then you always tell people, like, yeah, you know, I did one day, just because you  want to hear someone go, you gotta, once in a while.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you gotta.  You know, you gotta.  You have to, once in a while. 
[00:48:00]  Otherwise, you know, it's too difficult.  You can't cut yourself off completely.  That's, uh, that's known as a Tuesday for Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  That's where I ate bad.  His wife made some fucking snacks.  Yeah.  I can only imagine.  It was so good, dude.  It was so good, the food at the house.  The turkey was great.  The stuffing was great.  Oh.  She makes candied carrots, which no one eats, but it's what.  I hate candied carrots.  I don't go for them.  I hate candied carrots.  I don't go for them at all.  Jim just likes your regular baby carrots. 
[00:48:30]  I'm a carrot guy.  Yeah.  I like it in a good stew.  Oh.  Yeah, carrot stew rules.  I like that.  A little stew.  Oh, yeah.  It's getting to be stew season.  It sure is.  Oh, yes.  A little borscht.  I do like a good stew.  I haven't had stew in a while.  Let's have stew.  Someone make stew.  And maybe a side of mash.  No mash.  Well, let's just think about something.  If we can't eat stew, let's just think about something and get angrier right here.  I'm on it.  Jim's just going to stew. 
[00:49:00]  I'm on the other side of the mash thing.  I kind of like saying it that way.  Oh, no.  I'm not even doing it to Bobia.  Hey, pass the mash.  Mash.  But I'll say it like that.  Mash.  Mash.  Because we like to say whipped as well.  Whipped.  Whipped.  We go to Jubilee and drive the Asians nuts by asking, where is their whipped cream?  We made a whole thing of it one day.  That's how bored we are.  Five different people.  We go, where's your whipped cream?  Whipped cream. 
[00:49:30]  You're whipped.  Say it at home.  It's fun.  Worst customer service there.  Worst.  My brother-in-law thinks they're all Mexican.  I'm like, you're Asian.  They're not Mexican.  They're Asian.  I go, how do you mess that one up?  Chinese people do not have good customer service.  Oh, they're horrible.  And I'm telling you, it's because there's a billion people.  They're so used to the turnover rate.  Like, well, I know.  Come back.  Go fuck yourself.  There's a billion people here.  It's cultural.  It's hard to pick your favorite Patrice O'Neill bit.  But when he talked about the Chinese restaurant, where he went there over and over again for 
[00:50:00]  10 years, and 10 years later, they don't even acknowledge him, that he's a regular customer,  and won't give him just a dumb little free thing of anything.  Just because you're a steady customer, right.  I mean, he does, you know, a 10, 15-minute bid on it, and it's hilarious.  And Fish Tank Guy, which was also Asian.  Fish Tank Guy.  I forgot about him.  It's one of my fucking favorites.  Heard you did well with the chip this weekend there.  I didn't hear any of it, but people seem to enjoy it. 
[00:50:30]  I'm happy people enjoyed it.  People loved the weekend programming, whoever put that together.  Oh, good, good.  They fucking loved it, and they loved that Chip was hosting.  Yeah, I didn't hear any of it.  Iroch, I think you're the one that gave me this stuff, too.  Iroch's back.  Yes, welcome back, Iroch.  Hi, Iroch.  How are you?  I'm going to ask Iroch about his time off.  Hi.  He had more time off than we did.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Do anything special?  No.  Just hung around the house?  Had work done on the house, watched movies, played games.  And updated OA photos on Twitter. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yes.  Been working on the old photo library, too.  Dude, I forgot what we used to get away with.  I'll be completely honest with you.  Dude, every fucking picture is some nude woman girl with something in her.  My memory is shot, because I have memories of what we used to do at AEW, and in the very,  very early days of Satellite, I forgot the debauchery.  Well, you guys all forgot this, and a lot of the old school listeners were writing in  saying, I can't believe you can't do this anymore.  I remember this stuff.  Do this.  Stinky wrote me and goes, I thought these girls were much hotter. 
[00:51:30]  It must have been in my mind.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember them being hotter, too.  You're right.  They were just a bunch of slobs that came up.  Dude, there's full-on vagina shots, girls eating each other out.  You should check out Teen Week.  I did.  I'm like, why didn't we get arrested?  Wow.  Steve in his Kiss shirt.  Wow.  Did you see the picture of, now I understand why he doesn't want anything to do with us.  We've just fucked them over way too much.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jim Cook is represented in the teen photo gallery. 
[00:52:00]  Is he?  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  There's a lot of pictures there.  Wow.  Who the fuck is that?  Let's see some.  And you know, none of these girls are as fuckable now, even in the hot ones.  This is 12 years ago.  Anyway, the big plug, if you follow OA Photos on Twitter.  Some pictures, for the love of God.  What are you doing, Sam?  Click, click, click.  Run through them.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  It's all our old school fucking bits, man.  Just get girls and make it.  Oh, look at the rump on that one.  We used to have the lesbian couch.  I remember that.  And girls would come in. 
[00:52:30]  Look at this.  It's a fuck-up girl.  Hold on, hold on.  Girls would come in and have their first lesbian experience.  Keep going!  Their first lesbian experience.  Yep.  Right in front of us.  Yes.  Holy shit.  That blood is smoking.  Oh my God, what is going on?  This is pretty.  The girls just kissing.  This is hilarious.  How did we get this many girls up there?  There's like four or five.  Hot girls.  Hot, young girls just lezzing out.  They're naked.  That girl's eating box.  Look at this.  What the fuck?  Dude, I ate pussy on the air.  Wow, that's right.  Do you want to see it?  I have photos of Montana Gunn. 
[00:53:00]  Remember when she popped the ice cube out of her asshole and I hit it in my mouth?  Oh, I heard about that.  Yes.  Look at that girl.  That girl is completely nude, arching her back with nice boobs, getting eaten out.  With the WNEW library behind her.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Where the fuck was Ken Stevens?  This shit went on.  Look at this.  That girl's getting fingered on our show.  There's totally fucking...  Look at that.  There's totally four nude girls going at each other.  Dude, there was pussy eating in the studio.  What a laugh.  And now we can't even... 
[00:53:30]  What?  We can't even make believe that we're...  There's a photo where there's a girl trying to get her whole hand into another girl.  Yeah, we can't even make believe because in the movies they can reenact...  They can fake murder, but we can't fake a blowjob.  We can't even make believe that a girl is doing something in here.  This was on regular radio, too.  Yeah, yeah.  There's another gallery...  It's embarrassing.  ...when you're done with that called Escort Wiffleback.  We'll get back to that, Sam!  That's a good one.  Did you put that up yet?  Oh, that went up way before Teen Week. 
[00:54:00]  Where is it?  Yeah.  This only photos Twitter account has just been kind of like...  This is great.  ...laying low, I guess.  But I'm telling you, if you want to see what we used to do, holy fuck.  Crazy.  I felt dirty after seeing some of these pictures.  That's Baz?  I never really knew him.  In his Boy Scout uniform.  Made of dress in his Boy Scout uniform.  Why all that money?  What's going on?  I don't even remember this.  I don't know what this was.  Escort Wiffleball Bat.  Is this an actual escort?  Probably.  E-Rock? 
[00:54:30]  According to what the folder was labeled, yeah, I guess so.  No, it was actually a Wiffleball Bat, and then we drove an escort into her.  Oh, no, you walked someone into her.  Oh, my God, she's taking her panties off.  What the fuck?  You're not even allowed to do that.  A girl's not even allowed to get naked in the studio.  That's fucking sickening.  Not even allowed to get naked and just stand there.  Wow.  We just had fucking the amount of nudity that was in that studio back long ago.  Fucking that was a good guy, too. 
[00:55:00]  What an idiot.  She's shoving the...  Oh, wow, she's shoving a Coke bottle.  A Coke bottle in her vagina.  That's it.  Shoved in her pussy.  That's great.  I think that was the test run.  She's squatting down on it.  Yeah, she put a condom on the...  She's got the Wiffle Bat.  Yep.  She has a weird pussy, though.  Was that her ass in her ass?  It wasn't her ass.  What, the Coke bottle was in her ass?  Look, look, here...  This is exactly what's going on in this world right now.  They're closing the curtain, so we can't even show pictures of what we used to do.  This is only pictures of what we used to do. 
[00:55:30]  We used to do this, but now we can't even show pictures of what we used to do without closing  up the fucking studio.  Oh, my God.  You see that?  They had to close the curtains for images of what we used to do.  That's unbelievable.  Crazy.  Thank God we got rid of the Wiffle Ball Bat.  We were going to get in some deep trouble.  Oh, that was great.  Because everyone was trying to...  Well, they were trying to beat the record.  They didn't give a fuck about their organs.  They were smashing that thing in there. 
[00:56:00]  Ew.  She really is gross.  That's a horrible vagina.  She's got a divot pussy.  Yeah, it's the worst.  Pushes in before you even get to any of the goodness.  What's going on there?  Yuck.  It's just something nasty right there.  Go on another one, Sam.  Quickly.  Stop having a ball by yourself.  Once again, it's 08 photos.  I think you're going to get a lot of follows today there, Iraq, on this account.  That's good.  We got a lot more coming.  You do?  We just started getting through the year 2000.  Hell's mad.  So we still have another two years of stuff.  I got... 
[00:56:30]  Oh, remember these two?  Wow.  Yeah.  Keep rolling.  I remember Corinne...  Keep rolling.  ...we used to say, she's all right.  Yeah, but, you know.  By the way, 2000, I think she was 17 or 18.  She's now 30.  Yeah.  That girl right there is now 30.  Yeah.  I remember that.  We're a little stuffed animal.  Wait till you see Jim Cook.  Like, has no idea what he's...  Oh, my God.  Jim Cook.  We fucked him over. 
[00:57:00]  Holy shit.  As an age, though, he looks exactly the same.  I know, right?  That stupid Sam Adams is pickling him.  It really is.  I saw my TV a couple days ago.  Yeah, he just looks the same.  He really does.  What is this?  Corinne and Jessica just...  Yeah, just hanging out.  In little negligee.  It was like a little party thing they were doing.  And, Iraq, you got...  What other photos are going up?  I don't remember offhand.  I got to go through the whole hard drive.  We have pictures of the famous bottle rocket incident. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a big titty.  Why is there a midget and a fucking...  Crystal Storm with a midget under her toes?  That's not her real name.  Oh, I don't think it is.  Well, that guy used to come in and do our show from time to time.  That's Voss.  Hot Wax Shannon.  Oh, yeah.  She was all right.  Oh, she's sexy.  Yeah, I think you would have liked her.  She gets the hot wax on her.  She has a big vagina, it looks like.  I love that.  There's a gallery up there called Lesbian Ice Cream Threesome. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, nice.  Where you just put ice cream on girls.  Two lesbians and you.  Sorry.  Welcome back.  She's helping.  Really?  And you definitely have a lot more photos going up?  Yeah, there's more being put together.  We're looking at Lesbian Ice Cream Threesome.  All right.  I think you just had naked girls who didn't know what to do,  so you threw ice cream on them.  Go through them.  You're not going through fast enough.  I know, Sam.  Stop fucking lollygagging.  Playing around, looking for wrestling pictures.  We put a blue tarp on the floor. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, he's hoping fucking Mick Foley shows up.  They're just all naked.  Right.  Kissing with ice cream and whipped cream.  Now they're kissing with whipped cream and ice cream.  They got it all over their faces.  Now these girls are definitely pretty hot.  That's a better caliber of girl than...  Yeah, topless.  Now they're putting all kinds of ice cream, cakey type toppings all over their titties  and licking it off of each other.  Whoa, there's a dollop of whipped cream on some woman's vagina.  You can tell the time period by the hairstyle. 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  They're 69ing and eating ice cream out of each other's pussies.  And we can't even have the curtains open to look at these pictures now.  Why didn't they throw a little spoonful of mash on there?  How the...  Ugh.  Mesh.  All right.  Now we're just looking at pictures.  Oh, wait, photos.  Yeah.  Check them out for yourself.  The shit we used to do.  Yeah.  You know, when we were so much better.  You know that, guys?  There's an old photo of your old PD where you're obviously making him uncomfortable 
[00:59:30]  by having Crystal Storm put her big boobs on him.  Which PD?  Oh, what's his name?  Jeremy.  Jeremy, yeah.  Let me see that picture.  Does Jeremy work here?  I've seen him.  He does?  Yeah.  Of course.  I see him whacking around.  I think we used to be pals.  What happened?  I have no idea on that one.  I say hi.  You can't blame me for every single fucking breakdown of a relationship.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting. 
[01:00:00]  Dude, those are probably fake.  Look at the two biggest tits.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Four boobs.  Who's that?  That's bad.  That's Jeremy?  Oh, that's Jeremy.  That's Jeremy.  Yeah.  Oh.  She got her hand right under his belt.  He's got a thumb up.  He's just like, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Is he not enjoying that?  Her giant tits are on his head.  Yeah.  Who's that guy?  Who's that guy?  Pete!  Oh, Pete, the engineer.  Pete Johnson.  With the fucking, we made him wear the dildo.  Dildo gin.  The gin dildo. 
[01:00:30]  Did he wear that?  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson ruled.  Oh, Pete was great.  He retired by the end of our run.  Oh.  Who's that?  What the hell's going on there?  What a delightful young lady.  She's all right, huh?  Bent over.  What a delightful girl.  Whoa.  She has a wow sticker on her hiney.  Fake tits that don't move.  Whoa.  Splits across the couch.  My God.  Strippers were better for the afternoon show.  You think?  Yeah, because they all fucking roll out of bed at fucking three o'clock in the afternoon.  They had time to clean all the cum out of their crevices. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, they had cum behind their ears.  Worse that cum behind.  In the morning, they would probably still come in here with the cum and the crevices.  Oh, God.  What's that Stalker Patty thing right there?  This is Stalker Patty and Jay Moore.  Is that new?  No, that's not new.  Stalker Patty?  Was that any W?  Oh, yeah.  She went back to our first week.  Did I know that?  She went back to our first week, pretty much.  Oh, of course I knew that.  I gave her a fucking finger.  I touched her with Ron Jeremy.  I did know that.  We started in July.  She came around November for the, I don't know, that charity thing. 
[01:01:30]  With cookies.  Yeah, me and Ron played with her vagina together and she touched his penis.  Together.  Ah, right.  That was at XM, wasn't it?  No.  Uh-uh.  Any W.  Oh.  Oops.  We put our hand on our pants.  Oh, that seems not that long ago, but I guess it is.  You're saying it was very cookie cutter.  I haven't been at any W in 10 years now, you know.  I know.  Okay.  So, once again, OA photos.  How many follows you get during this segment?  I would bet 20 or 30 at least. 
[01:02:00]  That's huge.  Oh, I think you might have just squeezed out 1,000 like it was nothing just now.  Yeah.  Like you're just throwing some mash on.  Mash.  Can I get a little mash?  Yeah, can I have a little more mash on the plate?  A little more mash?  You hate that, right?  Who would like that?  A little more mash on the plate.  A little more mash.  That's only great if they're throwing Frank Burns on and Hawkeye.  Yes.  A little more mash on the TV. 
[01:02:30]  Watch it.  Channel 5.  I want it on the plate.  Oh, God.  Everyone wants something.  How can you?  They can't remember what I said.  They want me to tweet the page?  Oh, come on.  Fine.  I'll tweet it.  Just retweet the shit out of it.  People should see these pictures.  Isn't that great, dude?  What we used to do.  My God.  Now we sit here and just talk and hope people give a fuck.  I have some, too.  I wonder, E-Rock, maybe you and I should coordinate.  Oh.  And I'll see if you have.  You probably have the ones I have.  And I got a lot of photos myself, E-Rock. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  But they're more celebrity shit.  I don't think I have the wilds.  No, tweet.  Put them up.  I've been sorting your celebrity photos from those days, too.  In case you didn't have the wild stuff.  Where one of our old producers there would fucking pose the girls like he was a serial killer.  Oh, he would do the photo shoots with them.  And then make believe he was in a happy relationship.  Get against the wall.  Fucking idiot.  Spread them.  Like Jerome Brutus after he fucking chopped their feet off or whatever.  That guy was getting numbers. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Getting numbers.  I pulled good numbers at any W, too.  I did okay.  I fucked a lot of girls from there.  There's a few I never got that I wanted so bad.  But I pulled more than my weight with load distribution.  Nice.  Yeah, I dropped a few loads.  Unless you have a better one.  My favorite is the one that you're dragged to the fucking toilet.  Yeah, I fucked her.  That was I fucked her a few times, but I fucked her over the toilet.  That was after the 50-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:04:00]  So she cleaned up and she reeked.  And I took her into the bathroom at any W.  And she was bent over holding onto the toilet while I stood behind her and fucked her.  Wow.  You want to write the book or what?  Are we going to do this?  I would love to, man.  We should go over all those.  I'm telling you, there's a really great book in there.  I got a good concept for a book.  Craziness.  It's not the obvious one.  We have to start with our end.  I was born in the story queen to a crazy mom and a normal dad.  And then we moved out to Long Island when I was five. 
[01:04:30]  I'll tell you, start the book with getting kicked off the air.  That's how you start the book.  Oh, yeah, of course.  And then you don't acknowledge why.  Yeah, you just do that and then the whole rest of the book is just relaxed.  And then a lot of blank pages.  Right.  Although the book looks like it's about 300 pages.  Exactly.  You got 20 good pages and that's it.  There is a great book in there with just on-air transcripts of what was said.  Well, I just want to do a...  I mean, well, it's our concept so I can say it. 
[01:05:00]  No one can steal this concept.  They're not us.  Yeah.  Just simply the stories of Opie and Anthony.  Boom.  Boom.  But you should spell it.  We can have volumes of that shit.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  You should spell it like that.  No, we shouldn't, Edgar.  That would be a very, very easy book to write.  Simple.  We just sit around and fucking just tell the story.  Some of these stories I forgot about, though, until I saw these pictures.  That's just it.  I have to listen to some of the segments. 
[01:05:30]  Forgot.  Get the feel of what was going on.  Yeah, but it's well worth it.  That would be a great book, man.  That would be a very...  Enough photos in it.  It would be really fun.  Yeah, yeah.  An amazing book.  Block out certain faces of girls that might have a Coke bottle in their pussy, but I mean,  it could still...  It would be a great, fucking easy book.  No one's going to recognize these girls.  That's 12 years ago.  When was the last time we had a naked girl in here?  Oh, man.  What could you call it?  Oh, boy. 
[01:06:00]  I have no idea.  Opie and Anthony.  Book.  Fifty Shades of Gay.  See, because...  I don't know.  That's a good book, man.  That's too much work, though.  That would be a good book.  It's not.  I'm telling you, so many transcripts would write...  Who wants to work so hard?  You could literally have...  I told you they're coasting.  Everyone tell their side of the story.  We all tell our side of the story.  I mean, you guys obviously have a much longer history before me.  It'd be great.  But, yeah.  Oh, we have shit from AF. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  We really do.  Oh, my God.  We have shit from AF.  Oh, man.  Might tell a tale or two.  Tale or two.  Might have a couple tales to tell.  All right.  We should break, get into some other shit.  Yeah, we'll eat.  We got somebody, the Penn State coach, saying fuckers.  Oh, he's talking about coaches.  My Jets suck.  Fireman Ed retired. 
[01:07:00]  He's getting into too many confrontations or something?  I was one of them.  Yeah.  We went back and forth good, man.  I think at the games, he was getting too much nonsense.  Yeah, we'll explain that whole thing.  I don't know.  Other shit, too.  There you go.  Chop, chop.  It's a kettlebell day.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  On Sirius XM.  New from Grody Publishing comes the audio book, So Erotic, it will make you question everything. 
[01:07:30]  Damn, that's a good book on tape.  The best-selling cultural phenomenon evolves just for men.  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.

This book is freaking hot as shit.  Holy fuck, this is wrong.  But holy hell, is it erotic.

Some are nice  Everybody calls it  Kong's County Mall  I swear  Who are the everybodies? 
[01:13:00]  Who are the everybodies?  I guess Erock's got a comment  Erock, comment  That was the mall in the 90s  They used to show  Where people were having  Their sneakers stolen  As they were coming out  Of the movie theater  Yeah, yeah, yeah  They would just  They would jump you in  It was like prison  Take your sneakers off of you  It was like a prison  Would you bring a girl there  To a movie?  No, no  I wouldn't  Oh my word  You wouldn't bring a date?  Shut my sound off  No, no, no  I wouldn't  I wouldn't go to the movies there  I went shopping there a few times  And it was impossible to go shopping  Why? 
[01:13:30]  Because all the merchandise  As you walk into a store  You're just so distracted  Shit is laying on the floor  You know how people take stuff off the rack  And they look at it  And go, nah, I don't want that  And they put it back  Yeah  These people would take it off the rack  And then throw it on the floor  I mean literally  Throw it on the fucking floor  So there was shit everywhere  And then there was no one around  To really pick it up  No workers that were doing anything  It was the worst mall I've ever been to  In my life  And you definitely felt like  You might get involved in some gang violence  Jesus  By being there 
[01:14:00]  Kings County in Brooklyn  Is that near the new arena?  I don't think so, no  No, no, no  I forgot where it is exactly  It's not Flatbush  Yeah, it's not Flatbush  What day did you go to the mall  For the Apple 5?  I went  The Apple 5?  I went Saturday  Saturday  Saturday, yeah  That was still Black Friday time  Exactly  So you get a lot of people there  I got in and out of the Apple store  Pretty quickly though  It wasn't that bad  But then walking around 
[01:14:30]  You just like  It's throngs  And the parking is another thing  Like I can't deal  With being in a fucking parking lot  They got the curbside  I don't want no valet parking lot  Why?  Because sometimes I got like  Valuable stuff in my vehicle  You know?  I don't like that valet shit  Someone's got a case of big shotitis  Someone's been bitten by the big shot bug  You got to go into the parking garage  You don't valet  Or the parking levels 
[01:15:00]  And then you go around and around and around  Right up to the top  All the way to the top  And then you got to go back down  No, because there's an elevator  Right there  No, then your car got to go around and around  Oh, that's fine  It turns out there's nothing  No, there's always something up top  There's always something up top  Because people don't like going up that far  Because now you're outside officially  Yeah, you're absolutely  You're outside  But then the elevators are right there  To take you to the mall  Yeah  So, you know  Got to do that  But  I just can't stand  Going shopping around this time of year 
[01:15:30]  You just don't like being around  A lot of people, right?  Let me think  I kind of like it at times  In that atmosphere, no  Everyone's just in my way  Why? It's kind of festive  Because everyone's in my way  The Christmas tunes are playing  No, because it's not festive  It's inconvenient  Don't you like Christmas music?  I love Christmas music  You do?  I love being Christmassy  My house is all fucking decked out  Yeah, you kind of do like being Christmassy  Love Christmas  What the hell is that about?  But to me, Christmas is not standing behind  A fucking shoulder-to-shoulder  Fucking animals  That you can't get past 
[01:16:00]  That are just walking  No, no, I just mean everybody  That could be  I'm just joking  Yeah  It's horrible  To not be able to move  Go  Go  And everyone's got a problem  Trying to pay for things  With like drachma  But you're kind of strange  Because you always picked  A weird time to go to the mall  You had all those opportunities  To get the Apple 5  Before the Black Friday weekend  No, I didn't  I tried  I called them many times  And they were out of stock  Oh, they really were  And then they finally  I guess stocked up  For this weekend 
[01:16:30]  Ah, alright  Yeah, so I was finally able to go  And I had no problem  In the Apple store  It was actually very nice  It went pretty quickly  But it's getting in and out of the mall  And then the parking lot  Is another thing  It's like  People don't know how to go  Like when you're pulling out  Of that fucking parking garage  People are stopping  And there's plenty of time  For them now to go  And then they just fucking  Yeah  They stay there  And they're looking around  Like for something  People move  And I swear to God  And I tweeted it 
[01:17:00]  And I say it a lot  And I know I do  But  Hey, Asian people  They don't get the fucking left lane  The concept of it  You gotta move over  If there's no one in front of you  And you look in your rear view mirror  And you see a line of people behind you  You go  Why the fuck are you there?  And then I gotta whip around them  And I'm obligated to cut them off  Obligated  And then I'm obligated  To get my tires  Right in the shoulder 
[01:17:30]  To fling them rocks up  Into their windshield  It's  They  Every time that happens  And I have to go around someone  That's going really slow  I'm not even talking  Like I wanna go 90 miles an hour  I'm talking  They're totally backing up traffic  And I look over  I go  Bop  That figures  I agree with you  They're terrible drivers  I completely agree with you  Horrible  At that point  Sounds to me like  Someone's got a case  Of big shotitis  Someone's got bitten by the big shot bug  Apparently  Is this a new character? 
[01:18:00]  No it's just me  Someone's got a shot of big shotitis  Someone drank a glass of big shot this morning  A tall glass of big shot  Black Friday sales hit record  Alright  I thought we were in a  What about the fiscal cliff?  If everyone's buying their shit  Why the fiscal cliff?  Everyone's trying to get rid of their money  Before  It's taken  Yeah  Before it's taken away from the world  Before it's stolen by the shit government  Yeah 
[01:18:30]  The shit government  That 50% death tax  Is driving me nuts  And I'm not even dead  It's so annoying  It's amazing  That any government  Would reach their hands  That far into your pocket  Is fucking  This should be an armed revolt  You should be allowed to leave it  For your family  Let them live a little better  How fucking dare the government do that  It's disgusting man  Wow  It's terrible  That  You've been paying taxes on it too  Yeah  You've already been taxed on that money  I've already been taxed  What is their  What is the  What is the reasoning behind that?  What do they say 
[01:19:00]  These fucking  Terrible terrible people  To get money  They don't just say that honestly ever  Many people don't know about this shit  They just don't know  The majority of the country  Have no idea  Wow  What is taxed  They just don't know  Oh well  What are you gonna do right?  Fuck didn't have a Hector Camacho  Oh man  Fucking macho man  Shot and killed  Macho  Dead  Macho Camacho  There are strong rumors that  You know  He had some issues 
[01:19:30]  They said there was coke in the car  He had some issues  With the drugs  Involved with some people  Might have  You know  They don't know for sure  But they're very suspicious  That it could be  The issues he had  Leading to this  Horrendous end  Wow  Yeah he's dead man  Shoot him in the face  He was only 50  Him and his buddy  Were both shot in the car  Drive by right?  I don't  Was it a drive by?  I don't know  That's what it was  Maybe  That was  It was first reported as such  I don't know  Some of the good aim  I mean fucking  He should kill both of them  Both guys done  Yep 
[01:20:00]  He was on life support  He got pulled off  But he's fought Sugar Ray Leonard  He fought Felix Trinidad  Roberto Duran  In De La Hoya  Yeah he was one of the best  For a while there  Wow that's terrible  And then we also lost  The Larry Hagman  Larry Hagman  Yep  He was doing Dallas  I guess huh?

[01:28:00]  Yes  They were a very rich oil family  Oil barons  With a lot of diabolical schemes going on  And what was uh  What was this about Dynasty Sam  It was another oil family  Oh  Enough with the oil families  I know  In Denver  Denver  Colorado  Were they all loopy with the altitude  Oh good god  Why is it there's one good show  And then they all have to jump on it  I know  Enough with the oil families  So what were they doing  Looking for oil in Denver

[01:29:00]  I've never heard of any of these shows  I know Dynasty  That's where you can be a failure in radio  No it's not  How do you not know this stuff  You know why  It's gonna be a failure  Because people have moved on  No they haven't  Yeah they have  The phones are lit  The instant feedback's lit  That's all they want to talk  All they want to talk about is Linda Gray  We have different  And the Colby's  Linda Gray  We have different Target demos  What are you talking about  They even used the last name Ewing  Yeah  Yeah because it was a spin-off  Oh it was a spin-off  Yeah yeah yeah  Okay of Dallas  Yes  Not Slanding  Yes 
[01:29:30]  Um  I bet  This was way before  Fucking VCRs were in homes  I mean you missed it  You missed it  Yeah  That was it  You had to wait for the reruns  Oh  Was that a show too  You missed it  You missed it  You missed it  You missed it  You missed it  Yes  But I never knew  If I should put a comma  A dash  Or a semicolon  In between the two  You missed it  Well thank God  Now you can get  Not Slanding on DVD  Well thank God  You never have to miss it  Let's start playing  Fucking clips from that show  On a daily basis  A Not Slanding  Eight minute clips 
[01:30:00]  Out of context  A Not Slanding moment  Yes  And you have to be  Eight minutes every time  Eight minutes of  Not Slanding  I totally got a sequence  I love a Not Slanding moment  That's a great idea  Oh yes  Every day  A Not Slanding moment  Be careful  Troy is in the mood  To make bits  He may want to put together  Some Not Slanding moments  Oh I got three bits  In front of us  Last we left the people  The guys behind the scene  Got a talking to  That they needed to bring  Even more bits to the show  Yes  So we got bits  Should we play some  Of these bits 
[01:30:30]  Wait  Not Slanding  If you want to  I mean Troy wanted me  To emphasize that his  Focus  Let's start with a bad one  Okay  Which one's the bad one  Any one you did  I think Fish Song 1  Is not great  Alright  You always want to start off  With a little  You know  Oh yeah  Sorry  Rollington texted me  Rollington  Remington Steel  So I put them together  And made  Rollington  Rollington Steel  Nice  It's the adventures  Of a man  With a food addiction  And some self hatred 
[01:31:00]  Who's shy  And yet he's not  Yet he's not shy at all  Remington Steel  Remington Steel  Rollington  What about  Hardcastle and McCormick  Oh that's right  I hated that show  Now we're going a little too deep  Yeah  No that was a big one  Hardcastle and McCormick  Tell me what the show was about  I think they were cops  God how do you know this  Not a big one  Were they cops or no  That was a big show  I think they were private  It ran for three years  I've never even heard of it  I mean people knew  A retired judge  And his last defendant  Follow up on cases  That were dismissed  Due to technicalities 
[01:31:30]  This is the Hardcastle and McCormick theme  This is not a big show  Alright  How about  What's the one that's on  Rizzoli and Isles right now  That name makes me so crazy  I see that big poster for it every day  No no  It's something in Isles  Yeah Rizzoli and Isles  Terrible  You never call women by their last name  No one does  It's too tough as nail  What's it about  Can we read what it's about  Oh this looks horrendous  Two different jobs 
[01:32:00]  One killer team  Nice  What are they  They're probably like  Are they killers  Sam how about a synopsis  All the synopsis is  Series based on  Some novels  Featuring Jane Rizzoli  Ugh  What are you gonna do  Oh my god  Somebody sent me the fucking movie poster  For the Billy Crystal  Fucking  Marissa Tomei movie  The movie poster  Is infuriating  Marissa Tomei  Marissa Tomei  Billy Crystal  Fucking  Oh 
[01:32:30]  Bette Midler is in there  Bette Midler  The movie looked funny though  Parental guidance  Is this a new movie  Look at  Look at  Ooh  Ooh  Ooh  Oh  They're just having a good time  Oh boy  Look at the guys like  Oh boy  I gotta deal with this  And Billy Crystal's holding  Two kids up  In a very photoshopped  Manner  But is Marissa Tomei  Still playing that young  That's amazing  That she's still playing  She's playing Billy Crystal's wife  I'm sure 
[01:33:00]  No  No  The daughter  Bette Midler's the wife  Yeah  What  And I think those two are married  Those are the grandparents  And those are the grandkids  Oh okay  Gotcha  So Billy Crystal and Bette Midler  Are the grandparents  Yeah  Oh I thought they were trying to pull off  That Billy Crystal  Could actually be a father still  The guy's like  I don't need this  Oh boy  That's some family  I like the  I like the slug line  On top of the poster's good  Oh what does it say  Would you  Would you put it in Bette Midler's  Oh man  It's the parenthood  Fucking  It's the same poster 
[01:33:30]  The same  Well that's what they do  They just redo the posters  Over and over again  Oh it's so stupid  Would you put it in Bette Midler's  Shitter  Ew  No  I respect her a lot  When she was the last guest  Not enough to put it in her shitter  No  But she looks pretty good  Considering she was Johnny's  Last guest  And she sang to him  That was kind of moving  That's about  Do it for Johnny  How many years ago  93  That's 93 already  Almost 20 years  Wow  Johnny's been off the air  Almost 20 years  Off the planet for how long  Jay's had it for 20 years  Jay's had it since 93 
[01:34:00]  Wow  How long did Johnny have it for  Since he had it for 30 years  Wow  And Jack Parr  Had it before then  I think it went from Jack Parr  To Johnny Carson  Wow  Wow yeah  His mother was awful  Carson  No trailer I've seen a few times  Since we played it on the show  Was the one with Seth Rogen  And  Oh Streisand  And Barbra Streisand  Oh my god  I love Seth too  But that one just doesn't look  Well then again  It's probably not a movie for us  But  It'll probably do really well 
[01:34:30]  But you gotta think  I wonder how those guys think  When they make Hollywood  Because Seth Rogen's hilarious  And  I wonder if he wants to be making  Better comedies  He's probably like  Instead of these like  Cookie cutter fucking comedies  He's probably done enough  Brutal ones  Like Seth has played some  Pretty fucking hilarious  Brutal roles  So it's like  Once in a while  You do a mainstream one  I wonder where his head is at  With all that shit  Or he don't mind  Oh jeez  He's working with Streisand  He's probably signing it  No it'll do well  It's not a movie I would enjoy 
[01:35:00]  No  It's not for me  What's it called?  Guilt trip  Right  And then what  Les Mis  Les Mis is getting a big buzz  About it  Is it a musical or no?  Of course  I don't want to see a fucking musical  Not only is it a musical  But I believe it's  One of the first musicals  That they sing it live on the set  As opposed to in a studio  What are you talking about?  They do a whole featurette  For Les Mis  In the movie theaters  In the Regal theaters  Where they show that the cast  Sang the songs  As they were filming it 
[01:35:30]  So it's like a Broadway  Yeah yeah  Doing it more like that  Instead of them  I like that  So they had to get real people  That could sing and stuff  Wait it's a movie with  What?  It's a musical  But they don't lip sync the words  They actually sing it in the scenes  And not in the studio beforehand  Right  With filmed musicals  They usually go to a recording studio  Like three months before they start filming  And then they do all the songs  And then they go back  And when they act  They just dub the songs in  Lip sync it  Yeah  So they actually sang it  Oh fuck  At the time  Gives more of a real Broadway feel 
[01:36:00]  Does it?  What is Les Mis about?  Les Mis  It's about the French Revolution  Oh  Yes  It's got Wolverine in it  Which is cool  Hugh Jackman  And then it's got  That chick's younger sister  It has to be awful  That fanning girl  People are just fucking brutal  What?  You know when we were talking about old shows  Daryl in South Carolina 
[01:36:30]  Insists that we talk about Jake and the E-Rock  Jake and the Fat Man  Oh god that's not me  Oh come on  You gotta be kidding me  That was I guess William Conrad  But he's insisting  Cannon  We bring that up in the discussion of old TV shows  That was Cannon's last role or something was it?  I'm sure E-Rock didn't miss us  E-Rock was gone for almost two weeks  Was he?  I don't know  It seemed like it  Jake and the E-Rock  You didn't realize?  No  Jake and the Fat  What a terrible name for a show 
[01:37:00]  Jake and the Fat Man  Which one would E-Rock play?  Oh  I don't know  You'd be saying hi Jake  Every morning  You got any drinks Jake?  Got a piece of cake Jake?  Joe Penny was in that  From  From  Yeah  That show with  I saved him and earned him at the same time  Yeah  I gotcha  It's Penny  Pen saved  Jesus  With Perry King  Was in the show with Joe Penny

It was on that video time machine app  So I was just  No in a weird way  That's kind of cool actually  It was kind of cool  It was like  They were announcing what stars were going to be there  What were the stars of Eighty-three?  See if you can't find it

He's got a facade of being the nicest guy alive  Why?  You can just tell  You look into those eyes  There's something going on  He was part of the coverage for either CBS or NBC  For the parade?  You can tell  Yeah  Oh he would fucking  He would yank your head right off your body

Wait in line  And then  You can't even take a full step  It's so packed  And you're in the gates  Whatever  You can't even  You can't even get out of line 
[01:44:30]  When you realize  What a fucking waste of time this is  You're stuck  Fuck that  It takes hours  To get through the whole fucking thing  And then when you exit  You're like  Alright I live that way  They're like  Oh that's nice  But now you have to walk  Five blocks the other way  To get out of the whole fucking maze of shit  And then finally try to make it back  Toward where you live  That's inconvenient  So when they say  How great it is on TV  It's all bullshit  It's a pain in the ass  Tom Papa asked me  If I wanted to go look at that  Dude it would have taken you hours

[01:48:30]  I don't know why I'm yucking them  They just earned their money  They own corporations  Why wouldn't they?  They own corporations  Really?

Big whoop  Pretty good  Pretty good  You're rocking that giant cock  He just studded his way into money  That fucking big Florida dick  You're comparing it to the Nagel fortune  I'm sure too  Yeah I was going to ask you  What did your  Was it an arranged marriage?  Like was it the meaning of these two fortunes?  All right  Very good  Or settle an old score 
[01:49:00]  Or are you of  As some would say  Lower stock  Oh  Yes  No  Not of lower stock  What kind of food did you guys eat?  They had to give E-Rock to his wife's family  Because years ago  They shored them on a goat  And they said  We'll take your least competent  First born  And they did  Holy shit  Yeah what'd you have to eat?  Yeah what'd you have  Candied yams?  We're all patiently waiting  It's all the traditional stuff  Turkey  Stuffing  Cranberry  Sweet potatoes  Regular mash 
[01:49:30]  Mash  Did you eat any bread?  No  Stuffing  But that's about it  What about potato chips?  What's that?  Thanksgiving  No  I said potato chips  What's that?  Potato chips  Who's calling me?  What's your like one thing you can't stop eating?  For me it's that dumb apple pie  For him it's a snack called everything  Sorry E-Rock  It's not good  What'd you think?  Stuffing  You like the stuffing? 
[01:50:00]  Oh it's fantastic  How do they make it though?  Cook it inside the bird  I like that shit with the gravy on it  No I know but what's in it?  Is there raisins in it?  No  I hate raisins and stuffing  Stop that  Or when they put raisins  Or when they put sausage in it  No  Just leave the bread  That was good  Wait did he say sausage  Sausage  Sausage  And then you dump a bunch of gravy on it  It's fucking great  Can we play sausage into break please?  It's been a while  Thank you  I hate when the stuffing is cold  Because they prepare the meal at a different time  And by the time you get the fucking help of the stuffing 
[01:50:30]  It's all cold  I don't like that at all  And you gotta take the stuffing in a ball  And put it under your arm to warm it  Ew  That's the most stuffing warming at the Norton's house  I can't eat the stuffing  Because it feels like it's the turkey's poo-poo  I can't do it  You don't like stuffing?  That's great  I feel like it's the  Yeah it's the whatever  That's wonderful  Didn't work the first time  Why would you try to rework it idiot?  No  What?  People who know Dallas  Are not the same people who say poo-poo  Yeah you said poo-poo 
[01:51:00]  You probably would have got a laugh  If you said it's like eating turkey shit  Shit  Yeah  It's just a shorter way to get to it  I'm trying to go more mainstream though  Poo-poo is not mainstream  Eating turkey poo-poo is not mainstream  You gotta clean up your language  If you wanna go mainstream  I learned that  No you're just appealing to very small children  That's not the same thing  Mainstream has seen us  And said no  Mainstream has decided  That train has taken off  It's fucking  That ship has sunk  Dude I failed the psychopath test  I wanna know if you guys would fail the psychopath test 
[01:51:30]  What's the psychopath test?  It has something to do with a train  That's the only reason why  I fucking totally veered off our subject  They show you a picture of a person  If you bite it  It's like  What's the test?  Well  I'm fucking sick  There's a video  You wanna do the psychopath test  Yeah  After the break?  Yeah  I don't know what it is  I'd fucking pass that  With flying fucking  With flying knives  Oh god  I failed  But then I wanted to take back my answer  For real  Alright 
[01:52:00]  Cause I thought I  I thought I  Answered correctly  But then I really thought deep  And said no  I probably  Wouldn't  But they say  Rape a corpse  It's an interesting test  Hmm  You wanna do the psychopath test?

[02:06:30]  yeah he's quit as far as being the super fan for the new york jets  and i think a lot of people are happy that uh the male cheerleader is going home yeah like a whitey  little bitch  why why why he's saying like he couldn't take the the shit that was going down  you probably had so many confrontations with people who are you know because sports fans are  dicks well there's a quarterback controversy in new york but not really because rex ryan doesn't 
[02:07:00]  believe in uh tim tebow but was forced to take him on his team by the owner woody johnson  that's how that went down that's why you're not really seeing tebow at all because  rex ryan doesn't believe in him at all  and maybe he feels like  if he takes out sanchez and plays  tebow that's going to destroy sanchez then love no quarterback  it don't it don't matter we're not winning a super bowl with uh  fucking mark's oh he stinks dude he's we're not winning a super bowl so it doesn't matter  crush his ego i don't give a fuck yeah rex ryan's a dick and then maybe they could  fucking regroup in the offseason mark sanchez is not getting us a fucking super bowl 
[02:07:30]  he's terrible skills wise uh he's got the mechanics of a of an nfl quarterback yes but  he stinks he doesn't have the fucking heart terrible when it matters he stinks  holy  fuck the patriots the patriots embarrassed us did you see any of that  shit part of it i was enjoying patriots scored three touchdowns in 53 seconds my cousin actually  made it uh worth my while to watch the game first half yeah well thanksgiving jets pats why 
[02:08:00]  wouldn't you watch that's that's a good one to watch that's football what are you gonna do yeah  but he uh i was able to make a wager i was able to make a wager  on the uh first half of the jets game i took the over and fucking made it what was the over  well it was like 30 fucking oh 30 30 something was the over no no it might have been more than  that yeah jesus i forgot but i but we were like fucked at the beginning and then uh pats  fucking before halftime fucking that sounds like a high number for an over uh it was it was a high 
[02:08:30]  fucking uh it was a high fucking um score no i understand that yeah but it was really high and  i was like what the fuck is that about because yeah i don't i don't think the jets are good for  their fucking portion of that obviously yeah they're not gonna score a lot of points of course they're  not gonna score a lot of points yeah i have no team i was down in philly watching football with 
[02:09:00]  everyone red zone and all that i'm like i have nobody what was the over uh for the first half  someone's gotta know they'll know i totally forgot i was fucking drinking 30 seems loving the fact that  30 something seems a little high it probably was a little high yeah yeah first half ended at 35 to  three no no but the bet oh right right no i know it was 35 it was 18 18 or 19 probably yeah yeah yeah  what do you mean 18 or 19 uh points i think that was the that was the over on the first  oh that makes more sense i thought you meant that you had a bet no no no no i'm like why would you 
[02:09:30]  take that bet that sounds no no it wound up being like 33 was it no 35 3 35 3 yeah so it's 38  right crazy no i i i understand now but i'm thinking why would you ever like take oh yeah if the line  was 30 and you're going over no no no first half that sounds a little crazy i don't know what it was but  it was no it was in the the what high teens or something like that all right um so it was kind  of exciting to watch that first half anyway but they got their asses romped i guess fireman ed 
[02:10:00]  couldn't take the heat and uh i guess he did he chose to wear a sanchez uh jersey this year which  was a bad call he normally wore 42 but this year oh he wore six and people noticed you um so that  so they're totally so they're taking it out on him because he's got the sanchez uh jersey  and uh jets nation hates fucking sanchez by there you mean you what by they're taking  it out on him you mean you you are directly responsible i put you directly responsible 
[02:10:30]  for fireman ed giving it up from your insensitive tweets insensitive that was a good fucking twitter  battle and then he's like he totally deserved it because he was still raw raw about the jets i'm like  you're an idiot yeah i said some things i forgot my tweets at this point they were they were they were  well crafted oh they were hurtful they were well crafted and we went back and forth a bit and then  he uh deleted his uh twitter account i guess and now he's quit the team but he'll still be a fan  what does that mean oh the quote was so self-serving so now does it mean he's not going to go and stand 
[02:11:00]  up and quote no he's he's gonna go to the games as a fan but he's not gonna be the super fan  because uh uh where's the quote how is everyone gonna know when to go j-e-t-s jets i don't know  i guess a new super fan is gonna fucking take over oh there's a there's a position  jeez oh i did say i would hire him for my kid's party uh because my kid loves clowns oh yeah i did say  that say he you made him feel like a clown and i said something about you know washing his pom-poms 
[02:11:30]  oh he's a male cheerleader yeah well he was too rah rah rah about the jets when obviously  everyone else that is a fan of the team realizes that this team is in deep trouble yeah across the  board then he's just fulfilling a role instead of being a genuine of course you should have  fucking called him out of course we've had some injuries this year you know but a lot of people  saying at this point why not throw tebow in just to see what the fuck he could do is he a better 
[02:12:00]  quarterback uh mechanically than sanchez absolutely not but then someone sent me  his stats about the last 16 games for both quarterbacks and and tebow had the edge yeah  that's how bad sanchez is where's the fireman ed quote before we move on  it's in the other paper can you grab the other paper over there i think he said i'm a dick can i  quit i don't do it you got him wait till you hear what he said he says basically like families and  i don't know it's uh what it's so douchey fireman ed someone say something i don't find it 
[02:12:30]  uh casey anthony web search what a blunder that was uh yeah i don't think that would have made any  difference tell you the truth the days the kid went missing last day the kid was seen alive there  was a lot of testimony about um web searches it would always it had already been put out there not  this particular web search but there had already been google searches that were made for the same  subject matter and they wrote that off as other people had access to the computer yeah the mother 
[02:13:00]  was doing certain searches um certain things were misspelled or so i really don't think that would  have made any difference in um in the outcome of that trial she was going to be found um not  guilty very good i got the quote the stadium has become divided because of the quarterback uh  controversy as well said fireman ed the fact that i chose to wear a mark sanchez jersey this year  and that fans think i am on the payroll which is an outright lie have made these competitions more 
[02:13:30]  frequent yeah a lot of people say that uh he got his season tickets from the jets organization  themselves ah but he's now watch doesn't he sit right in the front there yeah man they used to sit  way up high and they got him nice and low and in in some prime real estate at the stadium and then  this is the douchey fucking quote ready jimmy i'm gonna watch jimmy here i think i've read it although i  can hold my own i do not want to lose my temper and make a stupid mistake i have a responsibility  to the families and kids that enjoy the game and fireman ed uh he he talked about himself in the 
[02:14:00]  third person there it's embarrassing to the families and kids that enjoy the game and firemen who really  enjoy i i've always detested super fans oh i hate them i was really you know as much as  i had my twitter beef i it was he was all right it stunk it always stunk you never liked it no it  stinks and it always i liked it when it was organic it came out of nowhere now it became a thing where 
[02:14:30]  they started really like you weren't allowed to cheer yourself at the game you had to wait for him but  there was a time when i back in the day it was very organic and people like what the  fuck this one guy he's pretty crazy how long has it been happening get the stadium going he's 53 so  no but how long has he been firing out of the game i'm thinking i don't know it's been a while now  i hate the fact that people know this guy but then it became became more than this organic thing where  they put him on the screen at key moments in the game and he'd sit there like what 
[02:15:00]  oh god with his arms to his side like no wait for me oh god forbid you cheer on your own everyone  would be pissed like wait for fireman ed didn't get the signal yet well then the rest of the fans are  assholes too you know what that was fireman ed is fine it's an arena full of assholes listening to  some guy yeah bunch of dopes 1986 is when he started oh okay he i was gonna say 15 years but 
[02:15:30]  it's more that guy's a real fan he gets green uh that's 26 years just about the idea that um  the the idea that he riles up a stadium full of people like he's gotta he's gotta love that  like that's why he would do it like to have the control you you can make him quiet and then you  could stir him up in a big cheer and then you can make him say j-e-t-s jets jets jets if he was in 
[02:16:00]  the fucking germany in the 30s we know what he would have done yes oh boy the fuhrer oh they waived his uh  personal seat license according to drew barg on twitter hey what oh so he wouldn't have to it's not  good enough anymore where you just get season tickets you have to get you have to buy the license for the  seat now license amazing they were able to fucking uh push that one through and the fans just ate it  up yep if fans had one ounce of ability to stick together and not pay it it wouldn't have gotten 
[02:16:30]  through yeah but hey before you get your season tickets you have to buy the licensing fee crazy  for whatever it is it's nonsense holy fuck because they can't fuck you hard enough who thought of that  in the meeting right and then presented it and did they all go like snicker a little like of course  at first but then wait dude that's fucking brilliant you think they went with that i think they went  with like they laughed at first like a little chuckle right and then they started thinking about 
[02:17:00]  it went holy wait a minute so you were having to pay for the seat before they even pay for the tickets  yeah you're brilliant my god johnson well people pay it yes they do well they have no choice they want  to follow their fucking team so he quit he quit twitter and he quit the jets i guess the cowboys  are also a disgusting organization terrible they're a terrible fucking team before you move on to that  one last point about this you think he's gonna now sit at the stadium like nope not gonna do it 
[02:17:30]  i ain't gonna do it no no not gonna i'm just sitting here as a fan they put the camera on he'll go like  this and be like nope nope sorry sorry the fans will demand it and then he'll go like  and stand up and start doing it like he'll have a one minute retirement his first time standing up  they're all gonna clap for him yes basking glory i think i gotta go to the game i gotta go to the  game sunday because you know it's gonna be a lot of nope nope no no no i'm not gonna do it no no no 
[02:18:00]  like this no i'm retired no i appreciate it but no how many confrontations with firemen and  oh i fucking can't stand super fans then he threatened me because he knows a lot of firemen  i'm like i know a lot of firemen too you douche look out the fuck that's  shit we were getting emails from people uh tweets and i was saying that uh people in  his firehouse don't like him really i don't know that's what people were tweeting me those rumors 
[02:18:30]  he's outstate is uh welcome there but you know i'll be at the game just oh yeah sitting back  they'll make some big comeback now oh yeah everyone will be like oh yay five minutes god  now we know when to cheer again yay there should just go team someone should just put a fireman's  hat on go there and completely just take over his place yeah like how angry would it be fireman ted 
[02:19:00]  fireman ted would be great what was it well how about uh fireman lyle uh fireman lyle  fireman chip that would be uh sounds bad i would stand up there i would  fucking crack the whole place up i would go j e s t jest jest you know because i tell jokes  but i'll just do mets you guys want to take the psychopaths some guy m-e-t-s 
[02:19:30]  metz metz the fucking place would go nuts this fire person chip is out of his mind  let's get jimmy a seat oh that'd be great with that crazy look on the big screen  all right well so he's gone g e t z gets gets and all the white people are sharing there there's a  good question coming in why jimmy don't you like the uh super fan because they make it about them 
[02:20:00]  it's it becomes their identity yeah like first of all and i've been a sports fan my whole life but  i the more of the athletes and i'm i get to meet a lot of them and to to blindly root for guys who  are just dicks sometimes i i kind of found you know and again most people don't get to interview  them but we we got to talk to enough of them and i met them in functions they were just kind of dicks  so and then the super fan makes it about them like that asshole banging his potty i guess 
[02:20:30]  clark clark clark clark me me me me me me yeah baby yankees me me me me me me me me me me  oh go that's all you heard what's his name who cares dead he died exactly i'm sure he was lovely  uh freddy yeah freddy says freddy says and then this fireman head  me me me me me me me me me me me me me me shut up he would dramatically hold it too 
[02:21:00]  when it was obviously time to get the chant go he goes no wait wait for me wait for me yeah let's  get a good one from fireman i think i've seen where he does the arm and i fucking made me sick to my  stomach uh the amazing uh mets used to have the guy with the signs he was fun he would come up  was he amazing didn't say this team sucks and we should all be killed those are signs that should  hold up for the mets games got his name but i always found it pretty amazing that he was able to get all 
[02:21:30]  those signs into the game yeah they were big all right here we go is this the best one this is a one  and another reason i hate the super fan is because they're fucking you for tickets making you buy those  and you're sticking with it and you're showing up every week like fucking lemmings  what is he doing he's saying come on why is he smacking himself in the face that's a bad one 
[02:22:00]  i guess he's a big intense fan rooting for the team there was one what  what does he do with his hat and it's about him and he smacks himself in the face and then he points to  the fireman hat with the jets logo he wearing a fireman hat kind of cool oh it's all about him 
[02:22:30]  man that's why i hate the super fan they're sticking a big team dick in your ass and instead  of going fuck you i'm not paying a licensing fee for tickets you pay it 
[02:23:00]  yeah we gotta break down i forgot about that part what he only he he kind of takes the hat off but  when it's time for the chant he dramatically puts the helmet on like oh yeah here we go  now i'm becoming watch how he dramatically puts the the because he's ed right there he's ed  he's eddie and now watch watch the how dramatic this is  oh 
[02:23:30]  yuck oh  fucking yuck and then he sits down man 70 000 yucks in a row assholes they should do it they should  chant how do you spell licensing fee how do you spell that how do you spell dick in our ass and we enjoy it  it dopes 
[02:24:00]  uh oh he's a douche chill oh it's i didn't know he like did all those things  yeah oh he's making like he's all serious he ramped it up right around 9 11 right i'm not sure what  he did oh did he i don't know i bet because the fireman a very huge around 9 11 so he was looked at  more beloved well oh this is nice no this is nice dan in new york go ahead sir hey oh and a big fan  danny kins

[02:33:00]  hide them out and you heat them for just a lovely simmer and then you take your your  innards from your hysterectomy and you sprinkle your hysterectomy gook into the tomatoes  sounds like julia exactly they're all just one big fucking lady turns out that scott guy from  buffalo is just a dope he's not listening to the show because he's an idiot oh really everyone's  saying you you could listen to us online of course without any special packages so we were 
[02:33:30]  fuck them we lost the dummy good riddance oh by the way maybe at times it doesn't sound like it  but we're team uh jenny hutt what we're team jenny hutt what makes you say that because it's  martha stewart and her cunty daughter trust me we're team fucking even after that  fucking horrible twinkie song it was all right it wasn't there remember we were want we wanted to  kill it more than we did yeah it was pretty she was on the today show on friday for what the  twinkie song no oh jenny hutt who the fuck would have her on she went on the today show to talk 
[02:34:00]  about how she makes videos on her treadmill and i swear to god i was watching it which is the dumbest  thing when you're her age it's all loosey-goosey and literally it's kind of dumb for an older woman  she's put together all right but when you throw that shit on a treadmill the shit's bouncing that  shouldn't be bouncing looks like that guy that got shot in the stomach with the cannonball  why would you do that you know her demo probably enjoys you know oh sure but it was like it was a 
[02:34:30]  feature on the fact that this talent jenny hutt has the ability to both walk and talk simultaneously  it is stunning when you meet her that she can so do we have the clip of her in the today show now we  have to play that today yeah i can get it what about the psycho test oh yeah let's do that which one  let's do that psycho test i don't know what that is got a hundred i'm gonna this is the psycho uh  it's called are you a psychopath on youtube it's uh it's a bit highbrow if this stinks please tell 
[02:35:00]  me and we'll just fucking bail but this guy explains the scenario and then how you answer uh says if  you're a psychopath now what if can we do it at the same time or do we have to see yeah i guess we'll  be able to i don't want it to influence yeah yeah because i i took it do you really need to take the  test no i know it's plain are you consumed with anger it gets a little word are you more comfortable  when you're angry is it like a little blanket you get a misshapen pleasure out of 
[02:35:30]  he sounds a he sounds like a teacher at times here i'm just gonna warn you in advance so  if you hated the classroom i don't know but let's see let's let's at least we all know about the the  psychopaths enhance killer instinct they're uh they're finely tuned vulnerability antennae but  it may surprise you to know that there are some situations in which psychopaths are actually more  adept at saving lives uh than they are at taking them so let me give you an example of what i mean 
[02:36:00]  by that all right imagine you've got a train and it's hurtling down a track in its path five people  are trapped on the line and cannot escape fortunately you can flick a switch which diverts  the train down a fork in that track away from those five people but at a price there is another person  trapped down that fork and the train will kill them instead question should you flick the switch pause 
[02:36:30]  write your answer down  oh you're already annoyed by this everybody write down the answers so we know if you're legit  so you got you got a you got a train come down and you got the five people stuck on the train uh  train tracks pen please train tracks and you're sitting there you're like there's a switch holy  fuck i could i could make the train go this way but down that path is uh one guy stuck what do you do  do you switch uh do you flick the switch just writing a simple yes or no right we'll be this is a trick 
[02:37:00]  question or is it just a genuine question i don't think he's trying to trick anyone all right i think  he wants your your answer there's no trick here okay and an explanation did you write down jimmy yes  i have my answer all right well what you want to explain your answers ahead of time and  and i say no this is my reasoning i didn't put the five people on the track in the first place  i didn't put the one person on the other track i didn't start the train i ain't getting involved  fuck them all if if if if i had put the five people on the track and the train was hurtling 
[02:37:30]  toward them then perhaps i'd flip the switch to save those but i had nothing to do with this  so life fucking goes on my friends interesting jimmy of course i would make the switch the reason  why that means one of you one out of the two reason i was a psycho i'll tell you why i would  make this is perfect why i would make the switch why is given only only that information yeah given 
[02:38:00]  only the information he gave which is no rhyme no reason uh who knows the four people could be  innocent and the one person on the other track could be the one that fucking put the other four  there and then accidentally got stuck i was simply four people are al-qaeda and the one person is  fucking um somebody you like ted kaita i would uh i would make the switch simply because given the  opportunity to save four lives over one life i would choose to save four over one it's a simple 
[02:38:30]  numbers of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one as uh mr spock all things even let's see  who passes this psychopath i don't believe this test is accurate all right let's uh let's see what he  says the answer should be you would stop the train all right most people you're the engineer uh have  little trouble deciding what to do under those circumstances uh though the the thought of flicking  the switch isn't exactly a nice one uh the utilitarian choice as it were killing just the one person 
[02:39:00]  instead of the five represents the least worst option okay but now let me give you uh a variation  you've got a train speeding out of control down a track um and it's going to plow into five people  on the line but this time you are standing behind a very large stranger on a footbridge above that track  the only way to save the people is to heave the stranger over he will fall to a certain death but  his considerable bulk will block the train saving five lives all right pause so he basically says most 
[02:39:30]  people would pick the you know uh flicking the switch to you know save more people but now he  adds this little uh twist to the same question it's getting um a lot more personal i think is the  problem here uh again i stick with my same thing i didn't put him there fuck him that's life so you  wouldn't push the fat guy people are getting run over by cars as we speak i'm not there but you happen  to be there so i happen to be there but it doesn't change my feel of responsibility you're like oh 
[02:40:00]  fuck i'm here and maybe i can do something here wait my choice is to push the fat guy not given a  choice of at the cost of someone else or something else if there was a way to save everyone without  hurting anybody did he say that maybe did he say that you if you push the guy you are you know it's  a guarantee that you'll save the other lives because yeah just pushing the fat guy isn't a guarantee  no but i think he said he said he said it would save him yeah but he said you would know that  he said you'd have no board off but i mean would you do it 
[02:40:30]  what about the people on the train getting injured but i guess that's not part of the  fact so anthony says no i say no i don't fucking do shit i say no reason being um a then i'm committing  a murder like the difference is people say well by flicking the switch you are but no because now i'm  taking a guy in a safe position and putting him in a dangerous position whereas the prior thing i'm 
[02:41:00]  simply deciding between helping more people in a dangerous situation than another person it's still  exactly the same you're helping all those people that are going to get hit by the train you're  sacrificing one person just like you did by flicking the switch yeah i understand but however that guy  on the footbridge is not i would just feel better about it maybe technically it is the same thing but i  still would not do it is absolutely the same thing but i'm not putting the no but the guy on the  tracks who's tied up on the tracks or whatever i didn't put there there's a difference between 
[02:41:30]  that and pushing a guy onto the track but he wasn't going to be like even though he was tied to the  tracks he wasn't going to be hit by a train before you came and pulled a switch so he was just as  safe as the guy on the bridge so you're saying that i'm committing the same act one is one is cleaner  by flicking the switch exactly when you when that's the whole thing you killed him i still  say no i was the difference between shooting somebody or firing a missile from a plane and  killing somebody you know it's it's the more mechanical i said uh when i took this test last 
[02:42:00]  night i said yes okay but then over but then i sat there went no you you wouldn't do that i would not  push him but i couldn't say yes at first and i'm like well no of course not i would watch with the  fat guy like oh wow this sucks for those people yeah yeah i absolutely wouldn't push the guy but at  first i did say to myself yes no i would not let's see what he says continue  now we've got what we might call a real dilemma on our hands okay while the score in lives is 
[02:42:30]  precisely the same as in the first scenario five to one one's choice of action appears far trickier  now why should that be to pause for a second the reason it turns out and go back slightly i wish we  thought of this um spy guy nine two five changed the question for anthony uh it's it's five teenage  girls on the track oh five we'll break it down racially  you got five teenage girls and and now you got the fat man scenario yeah yeah well you know what 
[02:43:00]  you gotta think they have all their wonderful lives ahead of them  old fatty's probably gonna die anyway see you would change your tune is what you're saying oh  why not oh why do we think of a proper location for this first scenario five to one one's choice of  action appears far trickier now why should that be well the reason it turns out all boils down to  temperature okay case one represents what we might call an impersonal dilemma right it involves those 
[02:43:30]  areas of the brain the prefrontal cortex the posterior parietal cortex in particular uh the anterior  paracingulate cortex the temporal pole and the superior temporal focus bit of neuroanatomy for you  there uh primarily responsible it's cracking so what we call cold empathy for reasoning and rational thought  case two on the other hand represents what we might call a personal dilemma it involves the emotion 
[02:44:00]  center of the brain known as the amygdala uh the circuitry of hot empathy um what we might call the  feeling of feeling what another person is feeling now psychopaths just like most normal members of the  population have no trouble at all with case one they flick the switch and the train diverts accordingly  killing just the one person instead of the five but this is where the plot thickens quite unlike normal  members of the population psychopaths also experience little difficulty with case two psychopaths without 
[02:44:30]  a moment's hesitation are perfectly willing to chuck the fat guy over the rails if that's what the doctor  orders now moreover this difference in behavior has a distinct neural signature uh the pattern of  brain activation in both normal people and psychopaths is identical on the presentation of the input  this guy's a psychopath but radically different looks like when things start to get a bit more 
[02:45:00]  personal imagine that i were to hook you up to a brain scanner a functional magnetic resonance imaging  machine and were to present you with those two dilemmas banner night what would i observe as you went  about trying to solve them well at the precise moment that the nature of the dilemma switches from  impersonal to personal i would see the emotion center of your brain your amygdala and related brain  circuits the the medial orbital frontal cortex for example light up like a pinball machine i would 
[02:45:30]  witness the moment in other words when emotion puts its money in the slot but in psychopaths i would see  precisely nothing and the passage from impersonal to personal would slip by unnoticed because that emotion  neighborhood of their brains that emotional zip code has a neural curfew and that's why they're  perfectly happy to chuck that fat guy over the side without even batting an eye wow so what did you  say you said i said i i said yes you said yes to the fat guy but then honestly i sat down went of course 
[02:46:00]  i wouldn't i would just fucking make the train kill them all i'm a fucking psycho you're crazy you are a  psycho damn wait so jimmy failed the first part sort of no because he said the psychopaths would  switch pull a hair out of my nose no i was only saying what i would do like would flip the switch  he said that was the typical response though yeah that was the typical response of people in a cold  oh he said normal people and psychopaths would do the same thing yeah normal people say yes and then  no okay gotcha but i made the switch because i'm not a psychopath as i know i'm very empathetic and 
[02:46:30]  then we all in the end said no to the second part even though are you okay i quickly said why i'm  just being empathetic  just to make sure  how long have you been sitting on that it just occurred to me  it's funny that was that was kind of yeah very interesting actually because because it wasn't  just a dumb question when he gets into no he the reasons of the brain the the regions of the brain 
[02:47:00]  he kind of knows the brain yeah what he sees in psychopaths obviously that was that was very  interesting i didn't think you could learn much from just those two questions but but he broke it  down like that it was it makes sense yeah that makes sense and of course anthony said no and no  i fell into no scenario he presented whatsoever no you're you're you're the next one either you're  an asshole who doesn't give a shit you're a sociopath who is only concerned with his own self  and has no feeling for other people's joys or sadness he's just an angry man in a red car 
[02:47:30]  all right because i am not a psychopath i do not engage in the front temporal lobe of the brain  floating in and out of that accent yes i am i enjoy the rear coldly detached part of the brain  chip what would you do i'd fucking push everybody in front of the train i'd kick the  fucking fat guy too ah right in the fucking balls take that you fucking fat fuck 
[02:48:00]  fucking die you don't you don't worry what people would think of you i don't give a  fuck let the train kill him  is that a new song let the train kill him jesus oh wait no but there was a new one songs oh no  no no i can't remember  chip would just rock out playing guitar on the roof of the train while it was running over people  fuck yeah yeah goodbye legs 
[02:48:30]  that's it can we do the jenny video next sure and we got production to play  yeah and we got the penn state guy saying fuckers oh boy we got lots to do still between now and 10  damn damn somewhere over my big toe i'll find hair and puberty says my mother  the opi entry channel oh yeah  on sirius xm nobody is supposed to touch your private parts don't touch me like that don't 
[02:49:00]  don't touch me like that no nobody is supposed to touch your private parts you know i really like  you but i don't like the way you touch me touch me no touch it touch it stop it stop it  touch it no do you ever hear anything like this this this this is anus 
[02:49:30]  anus is a useful thing indeed we all have an anus all have an anus remember that anus is the proper word  anus  anus  anus gives relief in time of need we all have an anus all have an anus 
[02:50:00]  no  is what girls have down below  most people call it vagina some children call it virginia 
[02:50:30]  nobody is supposed to touch your private parts  nobody is supposed to touch your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a private parts. 
[02:51:00]  No!  Stop! If you don't, I'm gonna tell my dad.  Touch it.  No.  Touch it, touch it.  Stop it, stop it.  Touch it.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private porch.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:51:30]  All right, we got the Penn State coach, Bill O'Brien, talking.  Hi, Bill O'Brien.  And it sounds like he's saying fuckers instead of what?  What was he supposed to be saying here?  I think fighters.  Nuns.  Fighters.  How do you mix up those two things?  I don't know.  They're saying his voice correct, but it really.  Coach, we've talked all game long about the emotions of this senior class, 
[02:52:00]  the emotions of this team.  How were you able to get them to focus and get this win?  They're a bunch of fighters.  They fight hard.  They're a bunch of great kids.  It's been a memorable year.  You know, we're not an undefeated team, but I think we're a hardworking,  tough football team.  And now, you know, at the end of the day, that's what Penn State's all about.  He said fuckers.  That's so obvious.  Because he started laughing afterwards a little bit.  Coach, we talked all game long about the emotions of this senior class,  the emotions of this team. 
[02:52:30]  How were you able to get them to focus and get this win?  They're a bunch of fuckers.  They fight hard.  They're a bunch of great kids.  He realized, he said, oh, yeah, yeah, they're a bunch of fuckers.  He's like, oh, I said fuckers.  But you know what?  Compared to what was going on, that's nothing.  He meant the coaches.  It's one thing to say, it's another to do it.  Yeah.  To young boys.  The bar's been raised in order to really offend over there.  Yeah, whatever.  Penn State's doing well. 
[02:53:00]  Are they?  Yeah, considering.  That college football.  They didn't lose all their guys.  A lot of the players decided, fuck it, I'm going to stay with Penn State.  And I don't know their exact record, but they're doing way better than most thought.  I know that much.  And I do know Notre Dame is number one in the nation.  A lot of people happy about that.  I don't know.  And I do know that Jenny is on a dumb treadmill on the Today Show.  Ooh.  What is that about?  Oh, boy.  Is that one of those Uma broads? 
[02:53:30]  Who is that bitch?  I don't know who she is.  I don't know.  I think she has one of those Uma names.  She looks like an Uma.  Uma Plata?  Uma Plata.  What'd you do?  One woman has a unique approach.  Sirius XM radio host Jenny Hutt does her video blog from her treadmill.  And guess what?  She has lost 70 pounds in the process.  And Jenny is here with me with some tips on making exercise more betrayed.  What a pig she was.  What a slob she was.  Good morning.  Good to see you.  Hi, Tamron.  Thanks for having me.  We're from afar, but we thought, listen, you live your life on the treadmill, it seems. 
[02:54:00]  So we put me on the treadmill with you.  I do.  I'm going to kick it up a notch because I don't want to look like a wimp over here.  Oh, it doesn't make you look.  So I've got to be honest.  Like most women, I want to work out.  And I just don't find it fun.  But this video blog was really an inspiration that got you going.  No, it wasn't.  Well, what happened was I was already doing a lot of video blogging.  And so I was also spending a lot of time on the treadmill.  And I figured, see, how everything's loose.  Loosey-goosey.  But I mean, did it just come natural to you?  Oh, yeah.  Because I multitask.  But I'm on the treadmill. 
[02:54:30]  She doesn't look bad right there.  She doesn't look bad right there.  She looks pretty good right there.  Yeah, a pigtail.  She's got to be honest.  I just started recording and talking to my listeners.  Whereas before she lost the weight, she had a pigtail for another reason.  I love how we're not even listening to what she's saying.  No, no.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I got my friends on the treadmill.  I make appointments on the treadmill.  I take care of my kids from the treadmill.  Ah, right.  We heard you.  Do you fuck on the treadmill?  Yeah.  That's what I want to know.  I take a shit on the treadmill. 
[02:55:00]  I wipe my ass on the treadmill.  She just fucking squats down, lifts her legs up like a dog on the carpet.  She just walks like a horse.  Jeez, I'm all clogged up from you.  And the shit just falls on the treadmill.  It flops out like a pony.  And she just fucking cleans it.  And then the treadmill wipes the duty on the floor.  And then I think she just has to find what she likes, if it's an exercise that she wants to do.  Or she should just start with one thing.  Maybe if she's a...  She gained a couple pounds.  No, I think she looks good.  She gained a couple pounds.  There was an instance where she looked slimmer on the other cliff. 
[02:55:30]  She might be starting to go back the other way.  I mean, especially with the holidays and everything.  I eat hoagies on the treadmill.  I eat pizza on the treadmill.  Ew.  She looked a little bigger in the face right there a little bit.  A couple pounds.  The cheeks are slightly more filled out than they used to be.  A little bit.  What about them tits?  A little loosey-goosey.  What about them tits?  They didn't look bad in that one shot.  Not the pigtails?  But tits.  Let's tell her not to show the cleavage.  It bounces around a little too much. 
[02:56:00]  And not in a good way.  That loosey bounce.  Is she a goer?  Or is she a prude?  No, she's married.  She's got kids.  I don't know.  What year is this?  I don't know.  She'd probably suck your prick good.  You think so?  Yeah.  Who?  Jenny.  You think Jenny is a...  She'd probably give your prick a good suck. 
[02:56:30]  Your prick.  You told her you put her on TV, she would.  Maybe.  Yeah.  How long do you think she had her hair done before the spine?  Oh, my God.  Hours.  That looks like hours of work right there.  That's my advice regarding just a belly.  Yeah.  As long as you're healthy.  Yeah.  You're living with your shape.  I mean, people are saying it's so nuanced.  You think she's really working and going, I think I might get a segment on the Today Show.  It's going to be a big thing for me.  Advice with Jenny on the treadmill.  You run and I'm going to test.  She's getting pissed at that chick, though.  Thank you very much. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  The host is running.  Jenny's like, fuck, I can't do that.  What the fuck?  All right.  What happened?  That was a waste of time.  That Jenny would really work your prick good.  You think so?  Yeah.  She'd probably do a good job on your prick.  Yeah.  I didn't know you guys had such feelings for Jenny.  How about it?  Fucking.  Fuck you.  She would fucking do the twist with the hand up your rod.  Yeah.  Wouldn't even need to.  The mouth would get all the way down.  She'd probably take it down.  I've been to high school.  Her nickname was Jenny to the root.  Hey, it's Jenny to the root. 
[02:57:30]  Instead of Jenny from the block.  Jenny to the root.  She'd probably take your prick all the way down.  I'm just.  I'm just.  Yeah.  Jenny to the root.  Don't be fooled by the cocks that I got.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  Used to weigh a lot.  Now I weigh a little.  I'll suck it till I make him shoot.  I'm just.  I'm just.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  I'll put it in my mouth and give it a toot.  I'm just Jenny to the root. 
[02:58:00]  Everything I say is moot.  Cause I'm just Jenny to the root.  Don't let that guy do it.  He's a fruit.  I'm just.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  I blow it like it was a flute.  Cause I'm just Jenny to the root.  I used to gag on a cock a lot.  That's more Jeff in the block.  Like a flute. 
[02:58:30]  A young guy or an old coot.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  I have so much heart and cum.  I could make a three piece suit.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  I'm cheap.  You don't have to spend a lot of loot.  I have cum all over my face and my glute.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  Whether you're a small guy or a big. 
[02:59:00]  If you look like Romney or Newt.  Right after I suck it you can give me the boot.  Cause I'm just Jenny to the root.  Put it in my throat or in my poop chute.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  After I'm done you'll tweet woot. 
[02:59:30]  I'm just Jenny to the root.  Oh boy.  You got them all.  I went through the alphabet.  Yeah.  You got them all.  I was trying to figure out how you were going to work booting.  Hey.  Even a Spanish guy in a zoot suit.  I'm just Jenny to the root.  I'm real humble not a snoot. 
[03:00:00]  So which is the bad production?  I think.  I didn't forget.  We have more bits.  Fish song one is probably the worst.  Whether you play the guitar or a ute.  Is it a ute?  A lute.  Whether you play a guitar or a lute.  This is a bad bit coming in.  I think so.  Fish.  Fish.  Fish.  Get a trout dog.  Fish.  Have a clam witch.  Fish. 
[03:00:30]  Lay in sea bass.  Fish.  I hate scallops.  Fish.  I love a good scallop.  Fish.  I do not eat lobster.  Fish.  Tilapia is a shit eating fish.  I ate sea bass last night.  They are tasty.  I can't eat tilapia anymore.  I don't want a garbage fish.  No.  Not a fan of scallops.  Patagonian tooth fish.  Look at him.  Yeah.  I know I'm yummy.  Chili and sea bass.  That's like, oh, nice.  See what I mean?  It's just about fish.  What's going on?  Why are you guys doing so much production?  It's repurposed.  Troy told me.  He said he wanted to make sure that you guys realize that his focus. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  This is Troy Klein.  His focus is more on quantity.  So they're promising you guys raises if you work harder.  Is that what's going on?  Troy felt as though.  Something will fall through at the last minute.  Like always?  What's going on?  The job that Troy and me do is to make production, and it's your job to filter through it.  What's the next one?  Well, there's another fish song that's actually pretty good, and then there's a bit with Jim  and Cakes that's not as good as the fish song.  A fish song?  Who sings it?  Abe Vigoda?  Fish. 
[03:01:30]  Fish heads.  Fish heads.  Fish heads.  Roly-poly fish heads.  I hate scallops.  I love a good scallop.  I do like a good Chilean sea bass.  Fish heads, fish heads, roly-poly fish heads.  Yeah, I know I'm yummy.  I looks like Nixon.  Look at him.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[03:02:00]  That's kind of good.  That was a little funner.  That was kind of fun.  Yeah, that was a little better.  Kind of fun.  It's like a commercial, though, like a Heineken commercial or something.  Right, except about fish heads.  We're all sitting around toasting beers, watching the game with our multiracial friends.  Right.  Every ethnic background on the screen.  Like a Sonny D commercial.  Oh, it's amazing.  Mom, that is Sonny D.  Oh.  And they pan and they're all raping mom in the kitchen with a sausage link.  Any Sonny D, mom?  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, God.  And she just smiles and opens the fridge and it's just full of Sonny D.  Yeah.  It's an amazing house.  And she pointed to the black kid, you know who stole it.  And then we got this bit.  Yeah.  The last of the bits today?  The Sonny D was taken by the naughty end.  My nigga. 
[03:03:00]  You about the Twinkies shutting down, son?  Them shits was off the chisel.  Yeah.  Fuck.  No more Twinkies, kid?  No more cup chisels?  Damn, yo.  What kind of cakes do you like, kid?  I love a good clergymerc.  Damn.  What the fuck is that?  That's a cookie filled with spinach.  Come on, son.  I never heard of that.  You can't even get a cherble anymore.  I used to love a good cherble.  Huh?  It was wet tuna fish and dry flaky coconut.  And what you'd do is you'd put a cherble on his cheek and allow them to dissolve in your  mouth.  Ooh, that shit is crazy. 
[03:03:30]  Why the fuck would you eat that, yo?  That shit ain't even dessert, son.  I like the red asphalt.  What the fuck is that?  It's a chocolatey, delicious treat with a lot of Tabasco sauce in it.  You're lying, son.  It's delicious.  Nigga.  You don't want PCP, yo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn, little Jimmy.  You crazy, son.  That's the hookah.  Hookah and little Jimmy hanging out.  Yeah, just hanging out on the street corner. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we inspired us.  Word.  Word.  So that's today's production?  Yeah.  Damn.  That's three bits.  At least there's quantity there.  Troy Quantity is his new nickname.  Troy Quantity.  Troy Quantity.  What did he do for the holiday?  What did Roland do for the holiday?  Oh, please.  I saw one of his...  I saw Choo Choo Train pictures.  What was that about?  Well, he raged.  He went down to Allentown and raged in Allentown.  Allentown.  Yeah.  There's a great song about Allentown.  Really?  I've never heard of it. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Billy Joel.  I thought it was just a song about a town that made wrenches, but it's not.  Oh, oh.  I'm in wrenches.  Yeah.  Troy Quantity.  I saw one of Troy Quantity's Instagrams, and he goes,  Chilling on the L.E.S.  Yeah.  The Lower East Side.  Nice.  The L.E.S.  I like the Lower East Side.  Chilling on the L.E.S.  He's chilling.  There's some shit going down.  Yeah, yeah.  There was shit going down.  It was cold, too.  Yeah.  So you probably were chilling a bit because it was cold. 
[03:05:00]  On the L.E.S.  Yes, on the L.E.S.  Not literal.  What did you do for Turkey Day?  I just went home to Pennsylvania.  My family's in Allentown.  Oh, you're from there?  Yeah.  Clank.  Born and raised downtown.  Do you know that song?  Clank.  Yeah.  Clank.  Do you hear that song?  Yeah, I've heard the song.  Living here in Allentown.  Are they sick of the town?  And they're closing all the factories down.  Are they sick of the song, I mean?  It's actually about Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  Clank.  No, it's about Allentown.  It's right in the song.  Allentown.  Well, it's in the song, but he's talking about Bethlehem Steel. 
[03:05:30]  He's not saying that.  He's talking about Allentown.  Living here in Bethlehem.  Right.  And they're closing all the factories.  Dem.  Yeah.  Doesn't work.  All we do is eat lettuce and spam.  Doesn't work.  Did the song make a difference?  No.  Allentown's a shithole.  It's a total shithole.  I had to get out of there.  You would think they would get their shit together after this song.  No, I think it got worse.  Downtown Allentown's a fucking mess.  Is it really?  Yeah, it's bad.  What do you got downtown?  Nothing.  What kind of people?  I mean, I think you know how to answer that question. 
[03:06:00]  No, it's not a ghost town.  I mean, there's people.  Basically, what happens is all the people from New York City, rent gets too high, and then  they move out to Allentown and just make babies.  Wow.  How far is Allentown?  That if you go live out there?  About two hours.  Is there nice sections of Allentown?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's beautiful sections.  I mean, Dorney Park's out in Allentown.  Oh.  You ever been out there?  That's nice.  Dorney Park?  An amusement park, right?  Yeah.  That must be great, waiting in line while fucking savages try to cut you.  Well, some days are good.  Yeah, cut you in line and literally cut you. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, I was trying to figure that out.  They try both.  Yeah.  Right.  So why don't you get mom and dad out of Allentown?  They're fine.  They're good.  Amusement parks have just been destroyed, by the way, across the country.  By what?  There's no fucking...  A horrid element in this country.  Oh.  You cannot go to an amusement park and not have some kind of fucking problem.  It's amazing.  That's amazing.  That's why.  Whatever they're doing.  It should be a place of amusement.  Oh, to park.  I go to amusement parks and don't have problems.  I have a good time.  Well, you're half.  They stink at me.  I hate amusement parks.  They're half wide.  Oh, you child. 
[03:07:00]  What am I talking about?  Well, until they see your face, they think you're, you know...  I go to Six Flags.  You're one of them.  Disney.  Because you got the hair.  Disney's different.  Disney.  Disney.  You don't have to work on anything.  It's the happiest place on earth.  Six Flags is fun.  They got great roller coars.  Six Flags.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm with Ed on that one.  That place used to scare the shit out of me.  Six Flags.  Just to fucking stand on line and just have people cutting you and all loud.  Do they cut?  I went on his ride on the gym.  Get up here.  Get up here.  I'm up here.  And then 50 people come in front of him.  They cut?  Oh, they cut like crazy. 
[03:07:30]  Is there anybody objecting?  No.  You object.  You get fucking punched in the fucking face.  Wait, you can't say, excuse me, sir.  Side of the head.  Oh, excuse me, sir.  I was here first.  You can't say that?  That's how you get cut.  Yeah, that's how you get the other kind of cut.  Right.  You get the blind side punch to the side of the head is what you'll get.  Do you not like roller coasters?  Well, you know what?  No.  I don't like the lines to get to the roller coaster.  If I was able to just go right up to the roller coaster and hop in, I'd go.  Yeah.  Went to Hershey Park last summer.  That's awesome.  Yeah, that's exactly.  You probably took that highway to get there, too, didn't you? 
[03:08:00]  Fucking Peter Pumper.  It's not funny.  It's hilarious.  That's when you went to Shady Maple, right?  That's right.  I went to Shady Maple this weekend.  What is Shady Maple?  It's the shit.  Shady Maple is the shit in Pennsylvania if you're out in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Why are you doing Shady Maple?  It's an Amish smorgasbord.  Amish.  But not like tourists are Amish.  No.  Like actual Amish people run it.  It's all organic vegetables.  Everything's organic from the Amish farm.  Sounds like shit.  No way, dude. 
[03:08:30]  It's great.  It's horrible.  Is it a flea market?  It's nonsense.  No, it's just like a big all-you-can-eat buffet.  It's like a trucker buffet.  So what?  You eat corn and shit?  No, I had steak.  I had steak.  I don't eat steak.  It's probably good.  Everything you could imagine.  It's a big trucker location.  It's not a...  What year?  Like what day is it that they do it?  Every day.  Every day.  That's their gig.  It's huge.  It's like $14 for dinner and you just go in and stay all day if you want.  I haven't been to Lancaster in years.  Yeah.  Why would you go?  Or you could pay a little less and opt out of the fish, which is what I did. 
[03:09:00]  Did it say fish?  Why?  Oh, you didn't want it?  I didn't want any fish.  How much without the fish?  I think it's a good thing.  It's like $3 off if you want the fish.  That's pretty righteous.  Did they have good mash?  Mash was sick.  The mash was sick.  The stuffing.  The mash was sick.  Delicious cakes for dessert.  Give me a little more mash.  You should check it out.  I want to go there.  You should have never said that to me.  I know.  It's all about the mash.  And they have a huge gift shop, too.  I have a Shady Maples hoodie.  Would you get a wooden fucking lamp or a wooden fucking little truck toy or a wooden fucking action figure? 
[03:09:30]  Of course not.  What'd you get?  I got a sweatshirt that said Shady Maples on it.  No.  Wooden sweatshirt.  Obviously not.  Everything's made of wood over there at the Amish.  That's ridiculous.  There's fascination with wood.  That's a metal.  It's insanity.  Are all the games on the TVs up there when you go eat?  Yeah.  Do they have TVs?  No, I don't think they have TVs.  Do they have little cakes at schoolhouses?  They got lights, though.  Wait a minute.  I'm trying to figure that one out.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Jimmy, I don't know.  Hold on.  Just a tasteless joke.  And then when you're out there in Lancaster, you've got to ride the railroad.  It's what I did this weekend on the old steam locomotive at Strasburg Railroad.  Yeah.  All the long day.  It's great.  It's cool.  Where do you go, though?  In a big dump circle?  I saw the choo-choo.  No, you just go down and they come back.  But they have like all these-  Where do you go?  You've got to go somewhere on a train.  You just get to ride the train and Santa's on the train.  I finally gave it up. 
[03:10:30]  It's a lot of fun.  You go on a train and it just goes over there and then comes back?  What's over there?  Sometimes the journey is the location.  What's over there?  Well, you just get to ride in old railroad cars and then Santa's on the train.  Santa!  Yeah, and you hang out and then you look at all the biggest locomotives that went on the train.  It's an old-timey train, right?  Yeah, like an old steam locomotive.  Yeah.  Isn't Santa busy this time of year? 
[03:11:00]  Nope, he's on the train.  And it really works.  They didn't fucking retrofit it with some kind of shitty motors.  It's awesome.  It's really fucking steam.  Yeah, and they have a bunch of them, too.  And they have the Railroad Museum right across the street.  They have all these old locomotives in there.  It's great.  What's great about the Railroad Museum?  You just get to see it.  It's just amazing to see how trains.  Can you go on them?  Oh, yeah.  Can you paint them?  You can't paint them.  Can you bring on a little engineer's hat and sit in the front and go,  Choo!  Choo!  Really loud?  Sure. 
[03:11:30]  That's a lot of fun.  I don't know why you would.  You guys like the bits?  I turned in some bits.  They're good.  I like the fish bits.  Yes.  Okay.  Why are you turning in all these bits?  What did they tell you?  Why do they have to tell me anything?  Why can't I just come in here and just be excited?  You're growing a mustache?  Nah.  I think you're growing a mustache.  Hey, how's Sal's mustache coming in?  Yeah, Sal?  Sal?  How's that mustache?  Yeah, it should be a beard, if you know what I mean.  Sal?  How's that mustache?  I saw him earlier today.  How's the mustache?  Apparently, he doesn't grow very quickly, because that upper lip is clean. 
[03:12:00]  Even after we scolded him for not growing the mustache, you would think at that point,  he would grow the mustache.  This kid's amazing.  And then we said, don't bother growing it now, and instead of being like, you know what,  just to prove, I'm going to grow it anyway.  Then he didn't bother.  He was like, oh, okay, I won't then.  He's not going to grow it.  He's about a piece of shit.  He is about that.  He was, we had a discussion on Sal.  Who did?  He was the example of how shitty his generation is.  He's really terrible. 
[03:12:30]  Walking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's sauntered.  Who's that?  Who's this?  The fuck is this?  Who's that?  I don't know.  Find out.  The Rockettes, I think.  Oh, yuck.  Who?  No, they looked good.  Oh, I can't wait until a fire breaks out, and then all that dumb performance fucking burns  them.  I saw some of the Rockettes during the parade, the Thanksgiving Day parade.  Of course you did.  You know what they did?  Were they playing the Lakers?  I don't know.  Yes.  Like Kers, the Rockettes. 
[03:13:00]  Yes.  Is that funny?  It's very funny, Sam.  At one point, they put their arms around each other in a long line, and they kicked.  It was really amazing.  Wow, is that like a thing they're doing?  Wouldn't that get old after 15 seconds?  Dude, it's so fucking like, all right, what is this, 1930?  How many times do they do it during the show?  Too many.  Ridiculous.  What do they do when they're not doing the kick line?  Then they'd do the thing.  Why would you see these people?  Then they'd do the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[03:13:30]  Nice.  Then they'd go backwards, and kind of fall into each other.  Backwards?  Yeah.  Yeah, so they got all sorts of tricks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should have used my toodley horn.  Let's get a little Christmassy.  Nice. 
[03:14:00]  Taking my time.  Hello!  You said get Christmassy.  Oh, I meant Christmassy like joyous.  Can you mark that, please?  That's a bit crazy.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Come on, let's do it.  Let's just do it.  Oh, God.  Come on!  It is post-Thanksgiving.  Ah, already. 
[03:14:30]  You don't like this?  Not it.  I like when he extends the la la  It's coming up  It makes no sense  La la la la makes no sense 
[03:15:00]  It does none of it make sense  It's not as low as like a sea  Like a sand about the beach  The lights walking in the trees  What?  The people shining in the street  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night 
[03:15:30]  That was nice  Oh  What's wrong with you guys?  You realize this doesn't have any meaning to it  When he says la la la  Look at this dumb leaf  This dumb leaf thing  That's how crazy this guy is  Goodbye Mr. Leaf  There he goes  Mr. Garrett  Don't you understand  You fill in the la la's?  No  No  Depending on who you are  No  I hate the la la's  That's the brilliance of Sherwin's leaves  You fill in the la la's  No  Fucking don't fill in the la la's  It's your song  Put it in words  No, you fill it in 
[03:16:00]  Yourself  You go  Oh, what does the la la mean to me?  No  Yeah  Yeah  And then you get those  The imagery of Christmas  My favorite kiss song is  Rock and roll all la la  Yeah  I got a little lazy  La la la la  I'm not writing words  La la la la  That's what he's doing  I don't think about a thing  What do you see when you listen to this?  Welcome to the la la  I see a relatively small town that has hustle and bustle usually  But they're all slowing down a little bit for the fucking Christmas spirit 
[03:16:30]  And there's a lot of snow on the ground  And it's snowing at the time of this song  I don't  I see a man trying to explain the child molestation notifications around the neighborhood through the door  What are you doing in there?  La la la la  La la la la  I got her in my house  La la la la  I also see  Smothered her in panic  La la la la  DNA on her little buttocks  La la la la 
[03:17:00]  Take a shallow grave  La la la la  You don't see that?  It's dark in the town  But everything's lit up with the fucking Christmas lights  No  And snow coming down  No, it's the same guy that said  There's a warmth in the air  Oh, there goes Robert  Because the chimneys are in use  Bye-bye, Robert  Go down the river  How dare you make fun of the leaf video  There goes  There goes Steve  Bye-bye  There goes  Oh, there's  Gwyneth  There she goes  Oh, get around that rock  There you go  That's the same guy  So no, it doesn't make any sense  It makes sense 
[03:17:30]  No, he's a crazy person  Oh, Mortimer  That's right  Thanks, Noodles  Mortimer  Mortimer  There's Mortimer  Harrison  Harrison  Down the river there  Have a good trip, Harrison  Have a good trip  Can we hear the leaf  What an ass  Why is he an ass?  That's so stupid  Talking to leaves  Oh, please  Maybe you gotta smoke some of the weed  Kevin from Connecticut  Yeah, maybe  Here we go  Here we go  The shepherd of leaves 
[03:18:00]  The shepherd of leaves  It's doing well  It's up to almost 10,000 views  Oh, come on  Look, he's an old man  He's been doing this for a long time  Why don't you get this shit?  From a bench in the town  To a bench in the trees  A bench in the trees  Under fallen old snow  Over fallen old leaves  Leaves  Like a leaky old boat  On an empty old sea  An empty old sea?  To leak till you're empty 
[03:18:30]  When empty you're free  What's it leaking?  It makes no sense  I hate his songs  What?  It can't be long  Like a golden flower  Sunlight for bread  And turn is my power  In a ballroom dream  What?  Amen  That dance with the old river queen  Should sing me a song in my dream 
[03:19:00]  I hate this part  I love his voice  His voice is good  His voice is terrible  Maybe he should go mainstream with that voice  A little mainstream  Alright, here we go  That was the intro  This just gets stupid  He should have made it a real song  This shows what he is  Talking to twigs like an asshole  Get in line  The leaves are getting in line  A doddering  He's a doddering old fool  He really is  Fucking  The twig whisperer  Oh, good one, Sam 
[03:19:30]  What do you have to make it bigger for?  He fucked it all up  He had to go full screen  What do you want to see?  Marmaduke the leaf?

[03:21:30]  That are on the banks  That don't make it in the water  Yeah  Have we ever gotten this far  In the video  I think so  I remember Mortimer  Yeah, but I don't think  We've gone much further  Shepherding the leaves  What ends up happening  Mortimer always picks  The trickiest  Chip leaf  Making everybody else  Slash  Very dangerous  Wood spike  Something of a cop in there 
[03:22:00]  What?  Something of a cop  No good video  Had been sent  We've never  Got this  Nah, I don't think we have  There's a spike  The leaves can't fall  On the spike  Where they fall  From the trees  Very dangerous  Wood spike  You might think  Beaver had done this  But  It's the natural  Beavering of the world  Through all these  Sticks here  Where the river  Was running so high  I can't get out there 
[03:22:30]  But there's a beautiful  What is he talking about?  I bet he has to shit  While he's saying  This stuff  Oh, I know  It's like a hand  Is it?

Like, who's been at, what's seniority there?  Hmm  Women used to do it for 20, 30 years  Wow  But now it's, I think, the longest that we know of is 18 years

Or do you all gotta go run and change into those, like, wooden 
[03:24:30]  We're all in every single number  Really?  Yes  Wow  Not two squads or anything?  We, we change our clothes very, very quickly  I would assume  Our quickest change, we have 90 seconds  90 seconds to change  90 seconds  Wow  And, uh, what kind of, like, dance background do you need  Before you can even, uh, consider being a Rockette?  Were you girls, like, big into dancing?  Yeah, ballet, tap, jazz  Yeah  All that stuff  Yeah  Yeah, because there's a bunch of different types of dancing  My mother told me I had two left feet  Oh, Chip  That's Chipper

Are you, are you kind of like that? 
[03:25:30]  Are they allowed to do a kick thing?  Just make sure no one's tying their shoes or something  Go see the show  There's not enough room for us to kick  There is a lot of  Break your equipment  We're just kicking it  Really?  They got, well, they got the long legs  That makes it really cool  When they kick  They do got legs for days  Yeah, it's very nice  How about the animals there on the Christmas show?  How the hell do they even, like, keep those things around?  Yeah  It must be a chore, keeping them around that long  What kind of animals are they?

That's a lot  He didn't wait for him to answer  And he just sits there with his face going  Well, he gets nervous  Oh, it's very uncomfortable to watch  He actually asked if they got the Adamos hotel rooms  Yes  Nobody was paying attention 
[03:28:00]  Let's be honest, the one in the middle was the  She was the one, right?  I don't know  The tall one  She was kind of  Want to be on  Like one of those George Costanza fantasies  I want to have sex with a giant  She was very tall  She was  Yeah, a tall girl  I was going to do the can-can or something  How about the can-t-cant?  I was waiting for that  There was zero surprise in that line  Zero  You know 
[03:28:30]  Will you ever mispronounce it and say the cunt-cunt?  Oh, God  That would have been great  We can bring him back in  Go get him back  No  I just  I love some of the sense of feedback  Because Nordo  Because you could  You could feel the anger  Even though he just wrote this line  He just writes  What the fuck is the natural beavering of the world?  Feeling pretty good  That was, yeah  The natural disses  You might think a beaver  A beaver made that 
[03:29:00]  But no  It was made of the natural beavering of the world  Of the world  That's what he said  Because the river kind of came up to a point  We never made it that far  And then when it receded  Into the video  Yeah, it left a bunch of twigs  And it looked like a beaver dam  But he had  You know  Sleeves had determined that  No  It was from the natural beavering of the world  Beaver  You gotta love him  Yeah  What happened?

We did  We did  You said, well, maybe they felt like  We were a little rude, but we did ask  Well, then that's why  They probably felt threatened  I wouldn't kick for you  Did you kick?  Oh, shit  I kicked  Let's see you kick  My kick isn't as good  Because I'm wearing Uggs  And I'm not  I don't have bodies like them  Did you video the kicking?  Oh, yeah  It's going up  You guys are trying, huh?  It'll be up at facebook.com 
[03:36:30]  Slash morning mashup  Nobody's going to watch it  I even put on my red lipstick for them  I know, it's a little red  You don't like it  It's too much  No, it's good  Matt tells me I look like a whore  When I wear it  When he's at home  When he's at home  Remember?  I do remember  I'm not going to beat her up for that  But I'm mad that she fucking kicked  With the Rockettes  You got to get up there  And kick with them  And then they would have done it  Beforehand  But I was the one  That got the Rockettes  To, like, do radio today  How mad are you going to  No, you got them to do this show  They were doing all the other shows here  Yeah, we had them booked  It wasn't all you 
[03:37:00]  I went, yo, are you the Rockettes?  Is that how you said it?  You did  That's why they didn't want to kick with you  Why?  They came in  We had a good time  How jealous are you going to be  When the morning mashup  There they are, the Rockettes  Yo, you got to kick with us  You know what?  Only one of them's really, really pretty  The other two are like  One's like hot  Like I would  Oh, how jealous  Are you going to be  When the morning mashup  Get their viral video before you?  No, that's impossible  I don't think it's going to go viral, honey  I mean  You're trying  You guys are trying  We're not trying  Yeah, shut the fuck up  You had your Gangnam Style dance with Cy  That was not  We weren't trying to be viral 
[03:37:30]  We just wanted to learn  How do you  And you just happened to put it on video  And upload it  How do you have a YouTube video  With the Gangnam Style guy  And only have like 10,000 views?  No one really gives a crap about our  Holy fuck, dude  He's got an 800 million view video  Yours 10,000  What is this vomit  That you're drinking over there?  This is called  It looks like vomit  Carrots  Yeah  Oranges  Yeah  Tell them, Jimmy  Tell her  Beets  I had a little spinach  Trying to be healthy  Carrots  Beets  Good kids 
[03:38:00]  Didn't you eat like shit  The last few days?  You throw a little vegetables in you  I did eat so much  I was so disgusting  I was dipping turkey in mayo  Like it was a dip  That sounds good  Disgusting  You know what Roland just said?  You might try eating vegetables  Instead of stick them in your  Fucking cooch  I don't think I've ever tried that before  I'm sorry  I'm trying to be nicer  Didn't work out  Roland said that he thinks  Nicole has gained holiday weight  Do I?  Do I look a little chunky?  No, you look good  Maybe  You could use a few pounds on there  I gotta go back to the gym this week 
[03:38:30]  Give me a second  You maybe gained a few pounds from yourself  I'm comfortable but you're fat  Oh  Don't you love when a fat person calls a skinny person fat?  I know but we're comfortable  What can we do?  I'm trying to help you  What did you do, Jimmy?  Oh, sorry, just straightening up  Jimmy, you look good, baby  You see the movie just did?  I did  He opened up his code, making believe he's like  You got no belly or nothing?  You look good  No, I still have belly but it's going  It's still there though  I'm proud of you  I'm sorry you didn't get the Rockettes to kick with you 
[03:39:00]  I'll show you my video as soon as it goes up  That'd be nice  Okay  How's your relationship?  The relationship is  Back on track?  It was a rough week but you know  It's tough when you're with all the family  And the family gets you stressed and annoyed  So it wasn't  And now Stan's not here  So I'm probably going to get my ass kicked  Because Stan's not here  Why's Stan not here?  He ate something bad  He said in the middle of the night  Did Clemo go pick him up?  After 12 days off  You guys have to talk for four minutes an hour  How bad could it have been what he ate?  I know  I don't know  What did he eat, crushed glass?  I gotta go 
[03:39:30]  I don't know what that means  Chop, chop  Get me the Rolling Stones tickets  Oh, and I need tickets  That's a really rude way to ask  And I also need tickets to the killers  He said, chop, chop, get me the Rolling Stones tickets  Please  Write your list  That one's going to be a tough one though  That one's going to cost  The killers or the Rolling Stones?  Stones  Then I'm going to my guy Leeds there  Have you ever been to the Stones?  Yo, Leeds, get me my Stones tickets  Do you know the line?  Rude guy  The line for him is already huge for the Stones  Yeah, but he's open  I guarantee I'll get Rolling Stones tickets 
[03:40:00]  For free  I don't know  You guarantee that?  You're a really impolite guy  That's a tough one  You work on the Killers  And the Broadway tickets  I got the Stones  You're so worldly  I'm not going to Broadway  It's Broadway  It's a block away  What's worldly about that?  I don't know  I've not  It's in the name  Broadway  Yeah  It's for the bruds  For the bruds  Oh, it's for the wifey  That was a good one  A little more tone  I would have liked that better  It's a Christmas Story musical  We bring him in 
[03:40:30]  I'm not going to a shitty Broadway show  That's a shitty Broadway show  Which one?  The Christmas Story  This pitch is not going well, Roland  Don't do the Christmas Story  That one is a shitty one  Oh, no  Roland, this pitch is going very well  Do you like the Jersey  Have you seen the Mormon one?  What's the Mormon one?  Yeah, the Mormon  I really want to see that  And I still can't get tickets to that  Yo, get me the tickets to the Mormons  That one costs money  Guess who went and saw the Mormons for free  Was it good?  With the original cast  With the original cast  Oh, so I saw  That'll never happen again  Oh, look it 
[03:41:00]  Someone took my bag and my purse  It's nice to have handlers  I bet it is  Yeah  Can I go?  Yeah  I'm just mad  I'm sorry  We tried to get the Rockettes to kick  And for some reason  They wanted to kick for you  Well, because you were rude to them  Sam  Obi's got his own viral  Yeah, you were  But Obi's got his own viral video  Oh, you got a  It's going to be better than your kick video  Did you surpass  What's her name?  Rebecca?  He's got some upskirts of the Rockettes  That he's going to post  Did you really?  Without them knowing?  You son of a bitch  Sorry  It's going to be kicking  It's not as much fun if they know  Do you see any vag? 
[03:41:30]  Yep  Some lips  A little lippage  A little clits  They're still right there  They're still right there  Yo, Rockettes  Why didn't you dance for us?  I gotta go get my ass kicked  That's Nicole's fake morning mashup laugh  Shut the fuck up  It was fake  That was a fake one?  It was  No, it was not  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha  Damn, Obi  You so crazy  What the fuck?  Yo  Yeah, come on  Let's kick  Obi's making faces 
[03:42:00]  At the Rockettes  And kicking  They don't see me kicking  You gotta see this  Obi is air kicking  At the Rockettes  This is  This is why people  Don't do things  When you ask them to  Look, they're  They're not laughing  Yeah, but they're  Uncomfortable  They're not uncomfortable  You're not a charming guy  I gotta go  What do you got going on?  None of your business  Yeah, it is  I gotta take care of my Hollywood trip 
[03:42:30]  Hollywood trip?  Yep  What's this TV show?  It's like, uh  What's it all about?  It's very, very complicated  Is it?  Yeah  Who's in it with you?  Sewage Joe  Who's Sewage Joe?  I don't know who that person is  Too bad you don't know  Who Sewage Joe is  Let me Google him  It's gonna take a while  Sewage Joe?  Sewage Joe  Yeah, I'm not getting any  Oh, from Parks and Recreation? 
[03:43:00]  Oh, I know that guy  Oh, that's the guy  And he was on your Instagram, too  He's definitely in the show  Kirk Fox on Twitter  Follow him  How come he's not in  Tell him the oldster said hi  How come he's not in Parks anymore?  Yo, Rockettes  Let's go kick our way out of this joint  Roland's gonna try to pitch  The Christmas story  People seriously now  There's no way  If Roland were smart  He would take a lesson  From what happened today  And what's happened  In previous days  And realize that  The secret to getting guests  Booked on this show 
[03:43:30]  Is to just have them  Walk across the hallway  Like, if they  If they turn it  Like, there's no way  If Roland had pitched  The Rockettes  Opie and Anthony  Would have said yes  But you just show them  And they go  Oh, bring them in here  Yo, Rockettes  We gotta take a break  We'll be right back  After Opie and Anthony live  The Opie and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  This show will be available  Later today  With Sirius XM  On demand  After Opie and Anthony live  Is next  Sirius XM 
[03:44:00]  Hey, hey, hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After Opie and Anthony live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  After Opie and Anthony live  I'm just talking about  What a douche  John Mayer is  My brother's probably listening  But still  In my opinion  Your brother's a douche  Eric, do you like  John Mayer?  I always forget  Or do you just like him  Because he was in here  And he's a celebrity  Like when he was a fan 
[03:44:30]  Of O&A  You kind of liked him  I was never the  John Mayer  Kind of guy  Intern Anthony is  Yeah, I guess  I'm  He's shaking his head  He fingers himself  To John Mayer  You do?  Ask him  Ask him what song  Would he finger  What song do you  Finger yourself to?  Edge of Desire  See?  Edge of Desire  Edge of Desire  He's got that finger  On that vagina of his  Just pumping and pumping away  It's after Opie and Anthony live  It's not even in the system  Of course it's not 
[03:45:00]  Because we had to  Take it out of the system  When we hired intern Anthony  Because he'd just be  Going around fingering  His vagina all the time  And we can't have that here  We need our intern  To clean up the studio  To get coffee  If he can't keep  Those little digits of his  Out of his vagina  What can we count on him for?  You know?  Anthony, I hope you're listening  If you're planning on  Walking around later  Not Anthony Cumia  Intern Anthony  Intern Anthony  I hope you're listening  If you plan on  Walking around with fingers  In your vagina at any point  Know that that's not  Allowed here 
[03:45:30]  Because we need you  For other stuff  Did you hear  When Nicole was in here?  This is what the song  Sounds like I guess  I'm gonna never listen  To that song  I'm not gonna listen  To that song  I would never listen  To that song  Why would anybody  Listen to that song?  Sounds like it's  Played in an elevator  Like a girl  Could listen to that song  The first comment is  Gives me goosebumps  Every time  I think it's  Douche Chills  You're confusing that with  Goosebumps  Anyway  It's after  Open Anthony Live  I don't know if you heard  Did you hear 
[03:46:00]  Nicole in here  Say that Stan  Couldn't come in today  Because he was sick  Like  It's the morning mashup  But she said  He ate something  Late last night  He ate something  And so he couldn't come in  Like  I couldn't imagine  Any reason  To ever not be able  To do that show  It's the easiest show  On the platform  To do  You have like  40 minute breaks  In between  They talk  Like for maybe  Three minutes  And then they gotta  Play like  20 minutes  Of songs  That's plenty  Of time  To take a shit 
[03:46:30]  And then they come  Back for another  Three minutes  Or just pinch it  Just hold it in  For three minutes  And then you could  Even run  Take a shit  Run back  Do another  Hold it in again  Do another three minutes  And then  That's the whole point  That you can be  In any physical condition  And you could fake it  For three minutes  Before you play the hits  Plus  It's not like it's  Stan by himself  There's four of them  Maybe let somebody else  Hold a lot of the weight  You know  All Stan has to do  Is be like  Yeah  And then he could  Go take a shit again  866-WOW1-WOW 
[03:47:00]  Is the number to call  What if they just make  Soundboard Stan  There's no reason for it  Or they could just use that  Maybe just use my voice  Yeah  If they just used  That sound clip  Of me doing that  Most of their listeners  Would be like  Oh Stan's there  Did you say  Box office biggies  Is that what he says  He says it on the countdown  How does he say it like  Uh  Box office biggies  He's always  Sounds like Yogi Bear  Is that what he sounds like  Good lord  I can't imagine though 
[03:47:30]  I guess you do anything  For long enough  And it just starts to  It just becomes work though  Because they've been  Doing that show  For a few years now  And I guess eventually  They just get sick of it  And forget how easy it is  Imagine if all of us  Had to go back  Into regular jobs  What a difficult time  We would have  We'd be like  What do you mean  Eight hours  When do we get  To just fuck off  For like four of them  Like what  You mean  I can't just sit  In somebody else's office  And kibitz with them  And pretend I'm  Brainstorming ideas  What do you mean 
[03:48:00]  I can't look at this  On my computer  Right  Eric would be like  What do you mean  Bikini girls aren't  Excuse me  This is research  Excuse me  I'd like to talk  To the manager  I'm at my computer here  And all my bikini girl  Websites have been  Blocked on the company server  I don't understand  They're not safe  For work  They'd be like  Sam  You've been to that  Wrestling site  Seven times in the last hour  And I'd be like  Yeah I'm at work  What else would I be doing  Oh it's Cyber Monday  Time to go shopping  They'd be like 
[03:48:30]  No you actually have work to do  It would be terrible  I don't think any of us  Can handle it  I know what would  Tyler Durden do  That's one of Eric's favorites  Yep  But the thing is  He can always be like  No this is  This is pop culture  That's why  That's why this show happens  Because like  Even in personal interactions  Now that's why  I bring all the  Behind the scenes stuff  On the air  Because they're like  Sam you're just  Gossiping with people  You just walk around  Gossiping all day  And I'm like yeah  Well I need to talk about  Something on my show  Don't I  For instance  Stanley T not being here 
[03:49:00]  Is a topic I want to cover  And I wouldn't get there  If not for  The gossiping  The kibitzing  And all that  Did you have a  Did you have a good  Thanksgiving sale  I did  Hipster Thanksgiving  What did you guys have  Like Cornish game hens  Or something  No we had like  You know the normal thing  But it's like somewhat  Churducken  Did you have a churducken  Churducken no  Did you wear a trucker hat  And be like mom  Let's do a churducken this year  And your mom was like  You know I'd really like  To fuck Barry Manilow instead  Is that how it happened  There was some Barry 
[03:49:30]  Playing that day  Seriously  Yeah  With your family there  Yeah my mom doesn't give a shit  It was you  Your dad  And your mom  Well no we were at  An uncle's house  And you know she has to  Yeah there we go  And it was your mom's brother  Yeah  So like your  Mom's husband  Your mom's brother  And your mom's son  All have to sit there  While she is playing  Her John Mayer  What she plays  She told us on the air  If you can't find that  You gotta find that show  I called Sal's mom  On the after show before  And she told me that 
[03:50:00]  She told me what  Barry Manilow's song  She masturbates to  You know like we  It's confirmed  And that Sal was  Originally going to be  Named Barry  Right because  She had some kind of  Oedipal thing with Sal  Where she wanted to  Fuck him for some reason  I don't know why  But  It's alright  We don't need the clips  Now she's inviting  The family over to Thanksgiving  And she's got her  Masturbation fodder on  As like a family  Get together song  Well it's light  In the background  You know you can  Get away with it  It's not too offensive 
[03:50:30]  Very soothing  Anytime the conversation  Lulls  Does she just go  Something like that  She throws the iPod on  Your dad just rolls his eyes  Like what the fuck  It's so embarrassing  And then your mom's brother  Is looking at your dad  Like  What a fucking dick you are  Like  My sister  Is just completely  Making a fool out of you  And your dad is just like  Look as long as  Nobody says anything  Everything will be fine  Yeah  You don't get cringy 
[03:51:00]  When your mom puts on  Barry Manilow songs  Now I do  After that day  After that conversation  What was the worst part  Of the conversation  For you  When I talked to your mom  Uh  Probably  It was either  It's like  Saying that she was  Still sexually active  It's one of those things  That's just like  Well yeah  I mean it means your parents  Are still having sex  With each other  You know what I mean  And they still are  It's one of those things  It's like yeah  It's probably going on  But you don't want  To think about that  But now you know  It's definitely still going on  Especially since he doesn't  Live at home anymore 
[03:51:30]  Oh they're fucking up a storm  If you're not at home  In his old room  Do you think they ever  Fucked  Is your room still intact  Yeah  Do you think they fuck in there  I hope not  Your parents  Do you think they do though  I slept in that bed  This past week  And I hope not  Was there a cum on the sheets  I don't think so  Was it the same sheets  When you left  Yeah they were  If there was  It was your dad  What's  Why is Mark Zito  Why is he pointing in here  Mark Zito is pointing at me  There's another John Mayer guy  I saw a picture of John Mayer  From the hallway  Oh we were just talking about  What a douchey is  No he's not  Yeah no 
[03:52:00]  We were talking about  What a douchey is  And how our intern  Who's a man  Fingers himself to John Mayer  There's  Okay  Because he sits at home  Listening to John Mayer  Do you like this song  Yeah  It's a good song  John Mayer's a good artist  No he's not  He's just a douche  You have to realize that  Like when are you going to  Grow up and realize  That he's kind of douchey  No  It's one of those things  It's just like an OCD thing  Mark Zito  He used to work for Ron and Fez  It's like an OCD thing  Where like you liked  John Mayer as a kid  And so like the realization  That he's fairly douchey  You can't allow it to set in 
[03:52:30]  I understand people  People say he's douchey  Quite douchey  In his like personal life possibly  And just the way he comes across  Yeah but you have to admit  He's like fucking talented  I guess he knows how to play guitar  If that's what you're saying  I'm just being a douchebag  About this now  He has the ability to play guitar  Yes  He's the biggest Hendrix ripoff ever  Sam  Do you think his doucheyness  Overshadows his talent  Oh he's way more of a douche  Than he is a talent  No way  Definitely  Fuck no  And he's the type of guy  Like when he was doing stand up  Like here's the thing  He's doing stand up right 
[03:53:00]  He wants to be like a funny guy  But then he stops doing  Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez  Why?  Because Ron and Fez  And Opie and Anthony  Bust balls  And he doesn't want to get  His balls busted  Because he's a famous guy  And he can't take  Being made fun of  So now he wants to be  A comedian that only  Gets laughed at  Which makes him a douche  That is  That part is douchey  Hugely  Well I also think he  Kind of learned the hard way  They had to like  Shut his fucking mouth  What do you mean the hard way?  He was a megastar  Fucking teen idols  While he was learning that  He didn't learn the hard way  No no no  The playboy interview 
[03:53:30]  The Rolling Stone interviews  All those stuff  Yeah but that's because  He thought he was cool  Like he thought he had his past  Because he was on  The Chappelle show  So he thought he could  Drop end bombs in interviews  And be like  Yeah I'm cool though  I'm John Mayer  Yeah I know  But I think it's fair to say  That one of the reasons  He probably doesn't come  On this channel anymore  Is if you're trying to avoid  Finding yourself in situations  Where you might  Accidentally say the n-word  Or something like that  This is not the fucking channel  You want to be on  But he can't even be himself  Like the reason that  That happens on this channel  Is because people  Are themselves on this channel  I agree  And he can't even just be like 
[03:54:00]  What's up everybody  I'm an artist  I'm just being me  He's like  Oh I have to make sure  That you know  The pop audience still likes me  And I have to  Blah blah blah blah blah  But I would say  Regardless  Best generation  Best guitarist  Of the 2000's  Jack White is significantly  Better than he is  No way  At least equal  Significantly better  No way  Slow Hand Jr.  This guy  Rolling Stone  Annoying him  Slow Hand Jr.  Rolling Stone is a douchey publication  Yeah seriously  Who the fuck  Gets their musical opinion  They fucking blow Jack White too  Rolling Stone is a magazine  Nobody even reads them anymore 
[03:54:30]  Magazine  Says the guys on the radio  But it's  Satellite radio is the future  I don't know if you've heard about this  But it goes from coast to coast  It's almost commercial free  What?  And we're even now  Get this  We're on demand on the internet  Oh what?  Yeah so we're in the future  What's the internet?  That's right  It's a thing that you'll  You'll figure out  When it gets more  Something for the masses  It's the future  And satellite radio is the future  And magazine is the past  And John Mayer is a douche  And these are just truths  That's not a truth 
[03:55:00]  You should at least check out  The John Mayer trio  No  That's a fuck  No John Mayer trio  Actually I will defend that  Is fucking killer  Well I'm not going to check them out  You know why?  Because the first two words  In that band name  I'm not going to look at  I'm not going to check them out  No they're really good actually  I will say that  Pino Palladino and Steve Jordan  Is fucking killer  Okay so you  Wait wait  Is that the other two in the trio?  Yes  They're killer  Yeah  Pino plays for the Who  And Steve Jordan's version of everyone  Yeah he's a major studio musician  Alright so he can surround himself  With talented people  He is talented 
[03:55:30]  John Mayer  You can't say he's not talented  At playing guitar  I told you he knows how to play guitar  Alright so he's a major part  Of that trio  And he's a phenomenal artist  He is  Those are two other major dudes  That really is a trio  I saw the John Mayer trio  For New Year's Eve  In Vegas  So  They're very very good  So John Mayer is good  When surrounded by other good people  Yeah but also  I believe some of your musical heroes  Would also say  John Mayer's talented  Jay Z thinks he's talented  Yeah but Jay Z  Jack White probably thinks he's talented  Jay Z just wants to  Somebody else who signed your arm  Probably thinks he's fucking talented  Rob Zombie  Probably doesn't like John Mayer 
[03:56:00]  And Jay Z just says  White people are talented  To get the audience  I mean Jay Z doesn't  Because he has to  So Jay Z's racist  That's what you're saying  He doesn't think any white people are talented  No but Jay Z will go and say  Coldplay and John Mayer are talented  Because he wants to relate  To a white audience  Coldplay's great  I'm not saying Coldplay  Why doesn't he just like  Watch Homeland or whatever  There's numerous other ways  To relate to a white audience  And lying about John Mayer  And he's not lying  Jay Z speaks truth  Jay Z doesn't sit there  Listening to John Mayer  Katy Perry likes him  Yeah Katy  Exactly  Oh wrong 
[03:56:30]  Exactly  Katy Perry likes him  And Taylor Swift likes him  And you know  I don't know if Taylor does  Well probably not anymore  What about Clapton  She's mean  Buddy guy  Why do you have to be so mean  Exactly  Clapton  Buddy guy  Any of those names  They probably like the trio  You know  Everybody likes the trio  Fine  He's a third good then  And they are senile  Probably at this point too  Probably  Eric Clapton  I would say he's senile  Yeah  That's an astute observation 
[03:57:00]  Billy Bush said so  Billy Bush said Eric Clapton  Well  Rolling with the hot Hollywood gossip  585  You're on after  Obi-Anthony live  Hey  Hey  I think John Mayer  Is a douche  But  Eric Clapton  Co-signs him  And says he's one of the best  Guitarists alive  So  I'll go on there  Eric Clapton  Eric Clapton needs to make  A statement like that  Because if he said  Stay relevant  Because if he said  That John Mayer  Hacks everything that I do  He would look like an asshole 
[03:57:30]  And  An Eric Clapton  No one will buy  You know  A younger generation  Wouldn't buy Eric Clapton  Do you think Buddy Guy  Would be in that same category  No  Buddy Guy would just  Tell him  As it is I think  Buddy Guy loves John Mayer  He's a John Mayer fan  I don't know  He's probably just old  Yeah he's  Okay you can't  Alright  What I said 10 seconds ago  Ignore that  I've changed my mind  I've changed my mind  It doesn't agree with my opinion  I got some more facts  And then I  Decided I hated them  Jack White is significantly 
[03:58:00]  More talented than John Mayer  No I wouldn't say  Technically talented  Jack White provides  A more original sound  A more creative direction  Well that's part of being talented  I mean I'm not just saying  Like John  Yeah John Mayer's good at practicing  Right  I will say  John Mayer practiced a lot  One of my biggest bummers  About working here  Was I thought like  You know when I  When I got the job  With Ron and Fez  I was like you know what  John Mayer listens to that channel  Probably calling up all the time  Coming in and hanging out  And then that literally  Never happened once  No  And if anything  Things went the other way  Right  And it was just very sad 
[03:58:30]  Yeah he was on the show  He was on the show once  Twice  Yeah and then that time  Was he in studio twice  For Ron and Fez  No he did Ron and Fez  Once  And then ONA  No he didn't do us twice  He did us once in studio  It's not just one big show  Yeah yeah  Radio world  Nine hours every day  He did us once  His brother's still a big fan  Of the channel  That's what I said  When I started saying this  His brother's probably listening  And you know  If you're  You gotta understand  You got your supporters  You got your  Anthony the intern  And your Mark Zitos  Who will stop by  I mean 
[03:59:00]  Sal being on my side  Is not the strongest thing  Because Sal also  Musically backing though  I can  You're a musician  Yeah I can provide you  With some insight  Excuse me  Sal has been trained  By James Eha  Of the Smashing Pumpkins  One of them yeah  He has an ear for it  An ear for what?  The music  Oh  Sal you mean  Yes  He does  Because James Eha  Trained his ear  Who else trained you Sal?  Buddy Guy?  Buddy Guy did not train me  No and neither did Eric Clapton  But  Oh  No I think I preferred 
[03:59:30]  Jack White's music  It's much better  Of course you prefer it  Yeah  But the John Mayer  Trio  And it's more of  Yeah the John Mayer  Trio  Fine  That's like being like  Jack White sucks  But the raconteurs are good  Yeah  Everything Jack White does  Is awesome  I would argue  Everything John Mayer  Does is awesome  You'd be wrong though  You would lose the argument  His new song  Walt Grace  Is one of the top  Five songs of all time  No it's not  Okay that's  Alright  Fucking  I know you're trying  To help me  Top five songs of all time  Of all music ever written  I really like that song  But that's probably not even 
[04:00:00]  One of my top five  Favorite John Mayer songs  Of his songs  John Mayer started going  In this direction of like  Sting where he just started  Doing a lot of like  Fucking ukulele shit  No no no no  Yeah he did  He did  Oh oh oh  Both John Mayer authorities  Said in front of me  I'm sorry I forgot  Guys continue  Go ahead Mark Zito  Is this not true  Did he not do a ukulele album  No he didn't do a ukulele album  It's a  It's a  More of a  It's just a  There's not so much  Electric guitar on this album  Born and raised  I guess it's more of like  A folksy type  Neil Young-esque  A western feel  Sort of thing  Is that why he showed up 
[04:00:30]  On the Ellen show  In character  He has to wear a costume  He lives out  I believe in Montana now  Exactly  Or Wyoming  I forget which one  What is he like  A method actor  Of musician  Like that's not him at all  Maybe it is now  He wanted to do  He did a VH1 skit show  Look at it  The guy goes through  Fucking phases  Look at every  Like album  There's like a new look  You know why  Because he's a poser  That's the  The people who goes  Through phases  Are posers  What are you saying  Like they have like  Multiple projects  And different stuff  Or  No no no no 
[04:01:00]  Because they change  Their identity  Every time something  Is like oh  This will be popular  Oh that'll be popular  Jack White's whole  Fucking career  Is different identities  He's in like  Nine different bands  Yeah but he always  Comes back to the  Red white and black  Every time  Plus  He doesn't go to  Pre-established bullshit  He makes guitars  Out of coke bottles  Did you see that documentary  Yeah I  May get loud  Yeah  That was awesome  Coke bottles  Mark Zito  Oh fuck  So he's like  The equivalent  Of a homeless person  Fashioning something  Out of what you  Previously thought  A homeless person  Okay fucking  Who's fucking  The greatest dude ever 
[04:01:30]  210  You're on  After Open Anthony Live  This Mark Zito  Yeah  John Mayer  Is not only good  But he's good looking  Hey Zito  Lady  Zito  Would you wanna  Hi Jill  Hey  Do you wanna  Touch  John's penis  Great question  Jack White  Could probably  Make a guitar  Out of it  Which would be awesome  Jack White  Could make a  Jack White  Jack White's the only  Thing that could  Make John Mayer  Sound good  By making a  Guitar out of his  Penis and playing it  Well  Would you touch  His penis  If he gave you  The opportunity  Just to touch 
[04:02:00]  I mean like  Maybe just like  If he was like  Hey Mark Zito  Would you please  Touch my penis  Would you  One finger  This is a weird story  Yeah I'm gonna  Do that for the story  Okay would you  Anthony  Intern Anthony  Okay if he was like  Okay  What if Jack White  Said just touch my penis  I would shove my asshole  On top of it  Now  If John Mayer  If John Mayer  Said alright Mark  That was actually  Really good  Could you grip it  Please  I don't know  Would you grip it  It's kinda getting  It sounds like 
[04:02:30]  This is getting  A little homosexual  What if he said  This  Will you grip my penis  And feel it grow  No  You wouldn't do that  For John Mayer  I feel like  The act of holding  The penis  While it grows  Would be gay  For John Mayer's brother  Oh  For John Mayer  You wouldn't hold it  Carl's really nice  I read him one time  Don't name drop  You wouldn't  You're name dropping  John Mayer's brother  I like Carl  I do like Carl  It was super nice  We met one time  Whatever  You wouldn't let  John Mayer  Grow to full capacity  In your hand  No  That's uncomfortable 
[04:03:00]  Anthony  Intern Anthony  You would  Why  Yeah  I mean  When is that gonna happen  When is that gonna happen  In your life  Okay so you're already out  I mean would you wanna  Blow your own hand off  That's not gonna happen  That many times in your life  Here's the next question  Then  Okay  Once it grew in your hand  Right  If John Mayer  Then looked at you  And said  Well it's not gonna suck itself  Would you suck it to completion  No  What if he played a song  You're no fan  Your body is a wonderland afterwards  Yeah  What if like  What if he let you jam with him  If you put it in your mouth  If I could play 
[04:03:30]  That would be great  But I can't  I'm getting a text coming in  Roland will perform sexual favors  For anyone who's famous  Male or female  We've established that  Roland will actually  Jesse McCartney  Roland will blow  More professional wrestlers  Than I will  We got text coming in  Anthony Cumia  Wants to know  How bummed is Zito  That I left before he got there  Are you bummed  So bummed  Yeah  You wish that Anthony  I haven't seen Anthony  Since that night  You know  Yeah  Since we hung out  Do you do this sometimes  Do you just kind of cycle  Around the studio 
[04:04:00]  Thinking oh maybe  Anthony will be here  I was like  It's a picture of John Mayer  Why are they  They're probably saying shit  Seriously  About that night  That you showed up  At the bar  And it was at  You read his twitter  I did not read his twitter  One day you'll come  Clean about that  One day  No but I have to say  Zia does frequent that bar  He invited me before  For a drink at that bar  I talked to Ryan  From the morning mashup  He believes you read  Anthony's twitter  And that's true  And your morning mashup  Is your little butt buddy  So  I don't understand  Why Ryan would say  He said it to me  In private  But now I'm making it public  Well  Fuck Ryan then 
[04:04:30]  He's wrong  Would you  No  He doesn't play guitar well  Okay  Alright that's good  Well  Why don't we listen  To this a little bit  I don't want to  I don't want to  Sam  I talked to Steve Leeds  About the Stones tickets  Oh yeah  Opie wanted Stones tickets  He said he's definitely  Going for free  What did Steve Leeds say  I hope he did  He made the announcement today  He said  Roland  Get me some Stones tickets  Roland said  That might be a little tough  And Opie looked at him  Angrily  And said  I'm guaranteeing you 
[04:05:00]  That I'm going to see  That show for free  I'll go to Steve Leeds  Yeah and Steve Leeds went  Ain't gonna happen  Oh  Free  It's not gonna happen for free  He said  It's impossible for free  Opie's gonna be disappointed  Well I'm going for free  You could probably get him  Into John Mayer  That'd be awesome  Of course you could get him  Into John Mayer  They're all free tickets  At this point  They're paper in those arenas  Oh I went to a  John Mayer concert one  Why  Yeah  I went to two  I went to  It was at the Nassau Coliseum  It was  The worst  It's the worst arena  But it was the most  Beautiful Long Island 
[04:05:30]  Like trashy girls  I've ever seen  In my entire life  Like if you want to get laid  Go to a John Mayer show  Ladies love John Mayer  People always say things like that  But like who's walking around the concert  If like a dude was just walking around  And women were like  You know I was going to go to this concert  But why the fuck  They're getting all juiced up  Seeing fucking  John Mayer  Hey you like this song  Yeah  I do too  Should we just  Go out  Or something  What  Did you say  Trout  No  Let's go to 717 
[04:06:00]  717  You're on the air  On After Open Anthony Live  Hey guys  Zito  How about this  If John Mayer  Were to teach you  How to play guitar  As well as he does  Would you finger his asshole  Yeah  Oh easily  That's not even anything  With my mouth  With your tongue  Okay no  See  Yeah probably still yes  If I could play guitar  Like John Mayer  That'd be fucking awesome  Yeah but  So it would just be practice  I'd like give my foot  To do that  Like you said  He doesn't do anything innovative  Why'd he give a foot  If he just blow somebody  Yeah dumb right Rowan  Yeah come on now  I need a manager 
[04:06:30]  Cause at the end of the day  A blowjob is just a blowjob  What's done is done  You can deny  I didn't blow him  And then you're like  I did  Cause like you said  Instead of limping around  Who's that limping guy  Who can play guitar good  John Mayer doesn't do anything innovative  He just practices  Well he does do some stuff  That's innovative  Like what  Does he make guitars  Out of coke bottles  Why are you being such a  Motherfucker about this Sam  Does he  Why are you being a  Motherfucker about this  Or does he just go to  Guitar center and be like  Oh I can practice on this  Guitar  I think he's very very talented  I feel like you're  You're just diminishing 
[04:07:00]  His achievements  Do you play with  The Edge  And Jimmy Page  I don't think so  They certainly  When they were making  A documentary about people  Who are awesome at guitar  They weren't like  Let's call John Mayer  You know who they called  They did call Jimmy Page  Obviously  They called The Edge  From U2  That's a little band  And then they  You know who the third  Person they called was  I know who the third  Person it was  You tell me  I believe it was  Jack White  That's correct  Mark Zito  And they didn't even think  About calling John Mayer  That's a trio  That's one hell of a trio  That's a trio  And they didn't even  John Mayer wasn't even 
[04:07:30]  On the short list  You don't even know  Did you make the film  Yes I did  Or even at the end of the film  When they all jammed  That was pretty sweet  Exactly  And you know who they were  Nobody was like  Oh we should invite  John Mayer next time  We do this  No  Because they were like  We'll just put on  Somebody else  Put on a CD or something  He's not a jam artist  He just practices  I really like that song  Say what you need to say  You like that  With the ukulele  Ukulele on it right  Well that's off his  Ukulele album  He doesn't have a  Ukulele album  God damn you guys  Mark Zito  Thank you for being here  And defending John Mayer's honor  Mark Zito on Twitter
