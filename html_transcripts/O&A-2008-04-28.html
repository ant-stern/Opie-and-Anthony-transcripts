<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Anthony suffering from a severely hoarse voice, a result of boisterous birthday celebrations documented on YouTube videos featuring him, his brother Joe, and his heavily pregnant sister Dawn.  Initial audio issues, described as "bassy" and "muffled," are noted. The show then dives into a lengthy discussion surrounding the Sean Bell shooting, debating the legality of the officers' actions, the potential disciplinary consequences, the pressures faced by police, and the role of race in media coverage.  Numerous callers, including several NYPD officers, participate in this debate. Reverend Al Sharpton's planned city-wide protest in response to the verdict is also discussed.  This segment transitions to a shocking discussion of an Austrian incest case where a woman was held captive and repeatedly raped by her father for 24 years, resulting in multiple children.  The hosts also preview their upcoming animation festival, featuring segments based on show material, including one about executive producer Steve Carlesi.  Audio clips of Reverend Al Sharpton, a Hillary Clinton song parody by Sophie B. Hawkins, and a play-by-play of an umpire being knocked unconscious by a fastball are played and discussed, with humorous emphasis on the umpire's dramatic fall.  Danny is present in the studio during this portion of the broadcast.

The show continues with a discussion about Roger Clemens and Mindy McCready’s alleged 10-year affair, punctuated by a comedic playing of McCready's music.  A comedic bit about George W. Bush at a White House Correspondents' Dinner is played, followed by a remix of Bush's speeches set to U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday."  The box office success of *Baby Mama* leads to a discussion of the movie-going experience, before returning to the horrific Austrian incest case with further listener calls.  This is followed by a discussion of Miley Cyrus's *Vanity Fair* photoshoot and the appropriateness of the images, and an in-depth analysis of racist Warner Brothers cartoons from the 1940s that have resurfaced online, along with listener calls offering varied perspectives.  The segment concludes with a discussion of an eBay auction for Barack Obama's half-eaten waffle and a collection of listener-submitted "FU" messages.  Crude language and sexually suggestive humor are prevalent throughout this segment.

The broadcast then addresses a *New York Times* article alleging the hosts run a website featuring racist cartoons, specifically "Cole Black." Audio clips from the cartoon highlight seemingly racist imagery and dialogue.  A caller, Jeff, shares his experiences working for Ted Turner, detailing censorship of classic cartoons deemed racist.  The discussion expands to other examples of perceived racism in classic cartoons like Speedy Gonzalez and the Little Rascals.  The show then shifts to a news story about a bondage incident resulting in a man's death, sparking a discussion about BDSM, including listener calls detailing personal experiences and perspectives on the practice. A paramedic caller details a similar incident resulting in a manslaughter charge.  Megan, a female caller, shares her experiences as a submissive individual, and the hosts and callers explore the dynamics of power, control, and pleasure in BDSM relationships. A humorous aside about a locksmith removing a padlock from the mayor's son’s genitals is included. The show concludes this segment with a lengthy analysis of a CNN interview with Reverend Jeremiah Wright, featuring the hosts and Jimmy Norton offering opinions on Wright's controversial statements,  followed by an interview with Emile de Ravin from *Lost*, discussing her experiences filming the show, a major explosion scene, and speculating on future plot points.

A subsequent segment features an interview with Emily VanCamp from *Lost*, discussing fan speculation, character developments, and shocking plot points.  The conversation touches on her role in *The Hills Have Eyes* and includes a humorous anecdote about Ted Levine’s performance.  The hosts repeatedly pressure VanCamp to use profanity, playing on her Australian accent.  Inaccurate information about VanCamp’s marriage on Wikipedia is discussed, jokingly blaming producer Sam.  Listener calls include an unnecessarily graphic query about *The Hills Have Eyes*.  Eric Logan, an XM Radio executive, joins the show to discuss discrepancies between Arbitron ratings and XM's internal data, explaining the flaws in Arbitron's methodology.  The segment further discusses *Lost* and features a brief conversation with Leslie Nielsen.  Logan concludes with a personal anecdote about a car accident caused by a cell phone-using driver.

The final excerpt begins with a discussion about an ongoing radio merger, with updates from Eric Logan regarding FCC approval.  Anthony’s birthday is celebrated with a call from Shawnee Smith, which quickly turns sexually explicit.  A song from Smith and Pyle, Smith's rock band, is played.  Deb, "Happy Typing Girl," arrives with cupcakes, leading to sexually suggestive banter and discussions about expanding the cupcake business. A Wendy's training video parody is played.  A preview of a heated argument between Tony and Pat Duffy from a previous Than and Sam show is aired.  The show concludes with sexually suggestive conversations and mentions of upcoming guests, including Adam from the Beastie Boys.  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous references to sex, genitalia, and other offensive topics are prevalent.

[00:08:00]  last night  i imagine you  probably uh  slept uh  the entire day  yesterday  yeah i think i  was up and  around for  probably two  hours  two hours  total yesterday  total out of  bed for two  hours and then  the rest of the  time just in  bed watched uh  tv caught up on  lost because i  had missed a  couple episodes  and then uh  turned on that um  alpha dog movie  okay which was  pretty good  i like that yo  and uh  that was pretty  much it  then always go 
[00:08:30]  to sleep to  something you've  seen eight  thousand times  so you don't  get like  caught up in  it oh  so you don't  get nightmares  no no no  because i'll  stay up and  watch something  if it's cool  so you know  you pop on  gladiator or  something  so you know  how it ends  so you don't  aliens  so you feel  like you could  turn it off  yeah yeah  you could just  fall asleep  fall asleep  and it doesn't  matter but  i uh  i didn't talk  to anybody  for hours  yesterday  voice started  getting good  and i come  into the office  and start  chuckling  and uh  there went  the voice  unbelievable 
[00:09:00]  yeah it should  be alright  though  the one movie  i saw over  the weekend  such a dumb  little kids  movie but  it was good  that jerry  seinfeld movie  the b movie  the b movie  was a good  animation  the b movie  you like that  one  oh i'm a big  fan of animations  in general  and uh  yeah  it was  yeah it was  really good  actually  yeah  yeah  you know  no harm  no foul  just throw  it on  and uh  you know  i don't know  is there  a creamer  bee  like making  fun of  black people  yeah right  yelling racial  epithets 
[00:09:30]  no no  yelling at  half the  stripes  on the  bumblebee  well we got  a situation  here in  new york  city  uh we're  trying to  get reverend  al sharpton  on our  show  good luck  he's a  fan actually  what do  you mean  he's a  fan  i just  felt like  oh jeez  i said that  like with a  little hope  in my eyes  like really  oh he  couldn't  be  someone of  his ilk  is listening  to this  radio  program  yeah  this show  we're  finished  no kidding  but uh  what was i  gonna say  yeah  reverend al sharpton  is attempting  to shut down  new york city 
[00:10:00]  i guess they  had a little  like a little  drill yesterday  in harlem  or or  saturday  what was it  they had a  march  uh in harlem  but it looks  like they're  shut down  some traffic  it looks like  they're in  like spring  training  because they're  just practicing  up there  yeah reverend  al has vowed  to uh  meticulously  organize  a uh  protest  here in  new york city  where he  will shut  down the  entire city  that is  what he's  saying  and they  practiced  yesterday  and they  had people  like holding  arms like  uh  across intersections 
[00:10:30]  stopping traffic  and uh  taking over a few  storefronts i believe  i was quickly  reading the article  and now  he wants to make  it an even  bigger deal  wants to shut  down broadway  times square  yeah  because the  verdict uh  didn't go  uh  his way  right i'm  sure most of  uh  most of america  knows what  happened here  in new york  with oh yeah  it's a cop  shooting sean bell  hours before his  wedding as he  was leaving a  club for his  bachelor parties  leaving a club  uh the cops that  were undercover in  there on some  kind of narcotics 
[00:11:00]  uh uh  operation  heard uh  some altercation  between bell  and some other  people uh  bell was heard  telling one of his  friends get my  gun  that's when the  cops followed  them all outside  they got into the  car and as they  were driving  away the  cops uh  pulled their  guns told  them to stop  they didn't  stop drove  into some  of the officers  who then  opened fire  on the car  killing bell 
[00:11:30]  and uh  injuring a  lot of his  buddies in  the car  and uh  the judge  because this  wasn't a jury  trial the judge  after hearing  all the evidence  uh determined  the cops were  justified in  what they did  sometimes it's  not as a  clean cut  where it's  like okay  he wasn't  armed  um  his intent  wasn't  to kill  the police  officers  apparently  but if  a police  officer fears  for his  life 
[00:12:00]  and and  thinks his  life  is in  jeopardy  he does  have the  right to  defend  himself  and uh  that includes  deadly physical  force  but does he  have the right  here's my  question  because i  think i  don't think  the cops  should have  went to  jail but i  think it  was definitely  excessive  if he was  armed i  wouldn't care  if they  pumped 200  bullets  but the fact  is it is  when you  when i know  that they said  that the car  kept going  and then you  hear the other  shots from the  other officers  yeah mistakes  were made  terrible  obviously mistakes  were made  but you hear  the shots from  the other 
[00:12:30]  officers and  it's very hard  to determine  who's shooting  at you at that  point you get  into that frenzy  uh where you  unload your  magazine into  what you think  is a car full  of people that  are shooting  at you  uh it was a  mistake but  again there's  there's laws  that say that  there is  justifiable  a justifiable  shooting  because when  they feel  they're being  threatened  it's justified  with abner  the wema  i'm sorry  diallo i think 
[00:13:00]  where he  they thought  the echo  was coming  back they  thought the  cop fell  and they  thought it's  like yeah  because the  cop slipped  he fell  after the  first shot  his  buddy's  look see  a downed  cop after  hearing shots  you gotta assume  he got shot  you're gonna  start unloading  it's just  you know  it's tragic  i'm not gonna  say it's not  but um  a judge listened  to all the  evidence and  found that they  were justified  some mistakes  were made 
[00:13:30]  uh that wasn't  even acknowledged  but you know  you can't  start locking  up cops  for situations  like that  when you  get a situation  where a cop  is in a  bathroom  with a  plunger  abusing  uh  somebody  that's been  brought in  then of  course  you know  jimmy  is it too  early  yeah it's  probably too  early  but uh 
[00:14:00]  but something  like this  it's uh  you know  it's deemed  justifiable  i don't think  they should  go to jail  i'm not  saying that  i don't think  i don't think  they set out  to kill  somebody  i don't think  it was a  criminal  but sometimes  you gotta  lose your  job  i mean like  it's not  to that's  it's like  when you do  something  when you  when you  make such  a mistake  on your  job  again i  don't think  that they're  bad guys  but when you  do shoot a  guy 50 times  who didn't  have a gun  it is kind  of hard to  explain  and sometimes  you gotta  lose your  gig  i don't think 
[00:14:30]  they should  lose their  gig  i think  you know  a little  more training  i don't know  maybe change  some policies  i don't know  i don't have  the answers  but i don't  think they  should lose  their jobs  you know  you can't  have  because this  is a  situation like  this is  very rare  a lot of  people would  say it  happens all  the time  it really  doesn't  considering  how many  times police  are put in  this situation  but occasionally  it happens  it's like  it's not like 
[00:15:00]  walking into  a deli  and saying  hey i ordered  mustard instead  of mayo  and the guy  goes oh i made  a mistake  and i'll fix  it  and i'll put  ketchup all  over your  shirt  when cops  make a mistake  you know  unfortunately  in worst case  scenario  some people  and innocent  people get  killed  it's awful  sure it's  awful for the  cops  but again  i think these  guys need  a little bit  of leeway  or else  we're all  going to be  in trouble  if these  guys have 
[00:15:30]  to start  second and  third and  fourth guessing  themselves  in a lot of  these situations  you're going to  find dead  cops and  dead civilians  if they really  have to start  second guessing  every move  they make  because there's  this threat  that they  might go to  jail  the leeway  they get  and i agree  with you  they shouldn't  go to jail  i don't think  what they did  was criminal  i don't think  their intent  was criminal  but that said  just because i  love cops  and i side  with cops  and i normally  do  and it's like  even in this  case i do  i don't want  to see them  go to prison  right  but that said  it doesn't 
[00:16:00]  mean that you  can make such  a mistake  and not lose  your job  it's like  you just can't  allow them  like anybody  in any gig  to make such  a grave mistake  and just be  put on desk  duty  but on the  outside it's  a grave mistake  when you look  at it  as police  feeling threatened  the shots  are being fired  there's a lot  of confusion  i don't think  you can look  at it as  a mistake  that they're  making  saying  ah screw  it i'm just  gonna unload  my magazine 
[00:16:30]  into the car  you know  they obviously  because of the  verdict  thought their  lives were  being threatened  they thought  they were being  shot at  and they were  returning fire  on the people  that they thought  were shooting  at them  that is a  mistake  but it's  a justifiable  mistake  in the terms  of prison  yes i agree  with you  no even  even as far  as losing  your job  it's a  justifiable  mistake  it's tragic  turn of events  but it's  justifiable  in their mind  they thought  they were being 
[00:17:00]  shot at  it's easy for us  to say  because it's not  like somebody  we know dead  but if somebody  i loved was  dead  oh i know  you'd want to  well taken  if you take it  personally  you'd want  the guys in jail  you'd want them  you know  dead  the family  you know  wants them  in jail  i mean  if you take it  personally  of course  but if you just  take it by  like the judge  did with the  evidence  the testimony  of both sides  and you know  that's what he  deemed  and you'll never 
[00:17:30]  you'll never get  the police  the police department  to start firing  their guys  based on this  it'll start a precedent  that's just  it won't stop  let's go to  bob  he's  he's nypd  bob what's going on  how you doing  pretty good  what's  i want to make a  comment on  what you were  talking about  the mistakes  that they made  and things like  this  but the general  public doesn't  understand  is  the police  department  pressures 
[00:18:00]  all the cops  i mean  we heard about  voters and  everything  but i mean  it's really  a pressure  system  where these  guys go out  there  and  you know  they're aggressively  aggressively  even on patrol  you're aggressively  out there  stopping people  asking people  stuff  you know  digging around  and getting  yourself involved  in things  where you get  in these positions  and when you get  these positions  not even the police  department supports  you when  i mean these guys  got families  these guys got  pensions  these guys got  children  yeah they want 
[00:18:30]  to go home  well yeah i mean  obviously that's the  biggest thing  they want to go  home but i'm  saying you know  it's not like  they're going out  there actively  saying well who  are we going to  shoot today  well that's what  bob hold on  that's i agree  with you and  that's why no  one thinks that  there should be  criminals  no one's saying  they should go  to jail  because i think  that you're  right they  didn't go out  there saying  we're going  to go out  and do  something screwed  up  right and i  mean uh  you know  like yesterday  you know we  were we had  something i  work in the  bronx but we  had you know  some kind of  a call  two guys  with a gun  i mean 
[00:19:00]  we stopped  these guys  on the street  and we got  40 people  standing in  the bodega  looking at us  you know  and the  cell phone  cameras are  coming out  i mean  you're getting  put under a  microscope  every day  and they're  making split  decisions  you know  split  minute decisions  why everyone  else can review  the tapes  and take a  look at  you know  it's it's  it's a very  hard job  on top of  that the  morale in  new york city  is is  is completely  you know  in the garbage  can uh  we haven't had  a contract  it almost 
[00:19:30]  it's going  our fifth year  will be in  august  we're not  getting paid  you know  i mean  you know  how bad  could it get  for these  poor guys  and now  you know  this is what  happens to you  when you try  to do your  job or try  to make  the city  safe for  everyone  supposedly  you know  what i mean  and these  guys  we all know  these guys  have had  extensive  records  for weapons  charges  assaults  they've had  an instance  with the  police  you know  and they're  all made  out to be  a nice  little guy  that went  out for  his bachelor  party  i mean  why do you  think the  cops were  in these  clubs  looking at 
[00:20:00]  these guys  no one  say  no no  the guys  thugs  like at least  the one  guy  seemed to  be  i don't  know what  sean bell  he had a  record on  he might  have  i don't  know  but no one  is saying  anything good  about the  guys uh  or even  sean bell  but the  thing is  you you  did see  a guy  uh get  shot  50 that's  excessive man  it's it's  it's excessive  and we have to  hold the cops  to a different  set of standards  because this  way we can  back them  when they're  completely  right  it's like i  do back the  cops when  they're totally  right and  again if a 
[00:20:30]  guy had a  pistol i  don't care  if they  pump 200  shots into  good but  if you don't  have a gun  one or two  shots is one  thing when  you get a  bunch of  cops firing  and not even  knowing who's  shooting it's  like to me they  have a gun and  they have our  trust they should  at least have  some system  where they  understand who's  shooting when  as much as i  know i can't  do that job  i i understand  but like anthony  said before you  know you hear  it's at night  you know you  got guys in  different positions  around his car  or whatever and  you hear one  shot you have  no idea who 
[00:21:00]  did that one  and this isn't  like a movie you  know how quickly  all those shots  were fired off  in a matter of  seconds it was  over it's not  like you can  take three shots  and start assessing  what's going on  when you're hearing  more shots you  just it's it's  bang bang bang  bang you know  they panicked  point at your  target and fire  it's not panic  it's kind of  policy you know  you you you try  to end the  threat shoot to 
[00:21:30]  kill when when  no even like to  say that i think  when a cop feels  his life is  justifiably  threatened like a  real a real like  that's like again  if a guy reaches  in and pulls out  a toy gun or  pulls out a  wallet it looks  like a gun like  they said uh  diallo pulled out  a wallet i can  understand that uh  on a different level  than a bunch of  guys just firing  into a car and  no weapon being  found i mean it's  tough to explain  how you thought a  gun was being  pointed at you  when no weapon  the lead up to  that is the  detective hearing  get my gun  why didn't they  stop him before  they got the  guys they were 
[00:22:00]  watching him they  were seeing where  he was going what  he's doing why do  you let a guy go  get a gun if  that's the case why  if a guy goes i'm  going to get a gun  why do you allow  him to go and get  a gun yeah let's  stop him let's go  to patrick in  ohio patrick  yeah uh anthony  why is it that uh  every time something  comes up with a  black person it's  justifiable well it's  a black cop too sir  he's not being  it doesn't matter  anthony i have a uh  i have a mac 11  i have ak-47 if a 
[00:22:30]  robber came into my  house and i put 30  30 holes in him i'd  be in trouble  wouldn't i well you  probably would be but  it's not like uh  somebody else is  shooting behind you  uh or on the side  of you and you  think with the gun  where was the gun  where was the gun  that sean bell had  you if if you felt  threatened after 10  shots and you could  absolutely prove in  court that you still  felt your life was  being threatened then 
[00:23:00]  you would be able to  shoot him another 10  times how yeah it's  it's the truth it's  deadly physical force  is all based on your  assessment of the  threat if you  honestly believe and  people and a jury or  a judge believes that  you felt your life was  being threatened you  can use deadly physical  force anthony what  are the chances that  somebody's gonna find  a cop what was using  excessive force look at  rodney king i'm sure  anthony you being as 
[00:23:30]  dark as me and you're  considering yourself  white i'm sure you  thought that was just  what are you trying to  pull some true romance  crap on me here i'm  just telling you the  moors my mom's white  my dad's black ears dark  as me and it doesn't  make any sense how you  like always bash black  people doesn't make any  sense don't bash black  people see because it's  always turned into a  racial incident that's  what pisses me off how  many times you ring that  little bell how many  times you ring that  little bell anthony every 
[00:24:00]  time you have like yeah  well that's that's the  inappropriate that's  not there for black  stuff it could be it  could just be too  dirty could be for the  jews yeah absolutely  yes okay uh what is  definitely for the  asians time for what's  what's before 95% of  the time anthony i mean  jimmy you're you have  sense opi has some  sense anthony i hope  it's a character because  if it's not i don't know  what to tell you oh  jesus all right well  then i don't know the  fact that you think that  opi and i have sense  then i don't know what  to tell you  you feel good yeah let me 
[00:24:30]  ask you this question  okay sure uh all that  stuff you say on the  radio would you go down  to like uh compton say  it without kenny or do  you have to have kenny  with you every time i  don't have kenny i have  keith exactly no i would  i would uh i would not  go to compton why would  i why would i go to  compton well my point is  if you can't say  something in front of  people you shouldn't be  saying it i say in front  of a mic that's my job  he's standing on the  radio it's not exactly  hidden you gotta give 
[00:25:00]  anthony this much he's  not saying in a closet  he's living in one  but he's not saying  in one yes sir  all right how many  black people a lot  do you think if you  were on hot 97 you'd  be saying half that  stuff yeah well if i  had a job on hot 97  i'd be speaking my  mind and this is it  and i think what do  you want from me i  think it would be  exciting as hell to  have the morning show  at hot 97 oh my gosh  you want conflict every  morning no one's  turning that radio off  dude i'm just i'm just 
[00:25:30]  stating what the judge  found and the situation  at hand and what what  what i know about uh  uh the law and the use  of deadly physical force  okay and you're turning  it into a huge racial  thing okay anthony i  understand that yeah you  like guns i love guns  got four glocks great  if somebody broke into  my house back to back  10 paces and i am  loading 60 rounds from  all my glocks yeah i  that's excessive 50  shots isn't not if you 
[00:26:00]  had uh four other  people in your house  shooting and didn't  know if the perpetrator  was one of the guys  that were shooting and  if there was a car in  your house chasing you  around your kitchen maybe  there'd be a problem  too scuffing up your  new linoleum let's uh  thank thank you patrick we  gotta hit a break here  we said could sound less  like joan rivers while i  said this hi tara reed  tara oh my god guys  wild on anthony what  was your show called  i don't know what 
[00:26:30]  sluts around the world  all right uh phone  number eight seven  seven two one two oh  and a we got everyone  fired up every phone line  is lit and wants to talk  about this sean bill  thing and the fact that  reverend al sharpton is  uh attempting to shut  down new york city is he  going to give us a heads  up at least yeah he's  having a meeting today on  uh the date and uh  logistics and how he's  going to do this he'll  be nice enough to give us  a heads up yeah i think  he's going to give us  heads up and we'll all  all right he'll take the  day off we'll take the  day off i'm sure a lot  of us have days coming  to us we'll just take  the day off good al  you'll piss off a bunch 
[00:27:00]  of cabbies yeah way to  go plus you'll you'll  affect uh you'll hurt  obama's campaign trust me  on that i'm sure that'll  come into play but i don't  think reverend al gives a  crap about anyone except  himself so yeah uh all  right uh we'll be back  opie and anthony stay there  what are you yelling in  the background drink orders  oh really it's the opie and  anthony show  hey late last night a story  broke it's going to be all  over the place this morning  we'll get into it in a little 
[00:27:30]  bit but we got to get back to  the phones immediately here  uh incest hell for 24 years  yeah i heard about that this  is unbelievable and it broke  really late last night so the  papers picked up on it a little  bit of the news is just  starting to uh get on this  story but basically in  austria in austria police  have found a woman missing  since 1984 who told  authorities that her father  had kept her in a cellar for  almost 24 years and that she  had given birth to at least  six children after being 
[00:28:00]  repeatedly raped by him  not very good at lock  picking is she 24 years the  same lock unbelievable we'll  have more info on that in in  just a bit here but our phone  number 877-212-ON-A  we got to get right back to  the phones let's say hi to  dave in jersey dave what's up  you're on the opian anthony  show hey what's going on  boys hey man hi i'm a i'm a  cop in jersey and um it you  hear a lot of it's been all  over the news and it's excessive  and if you do a little bit of  research i'm a veteran also you 
[00:28:30]  do a little bit of research and  you look up online in in a  wartime situation in a wartime  situation i understand that but it  it winds up being like something  ridiculous like 3 000 rounds to  kill one person just the nature  of combat and you get what i  don't know has anybody brought up  sympathetic fire syndrome where  where you're shooting and you you  don't stop shooting until your  buddy stop shooting your buddy  doesn't stop shooting until he 
[00:29:00]  hears you stop shooting and it can  work as a chain like the one guy  fired 30 rounds he could have been  in the middle of a magazine his  other buddy's still shooting he  goes he's gonna reload because  his friend's still shooting and  it's a car what finally stops  him the daylight comes and they  have to the shipment of when  when he should finally stop  completely out of ammo they send  an intern out for more rounds i  mean how does this end my god and  he had the two rounds and so on and  so on and so on all right thank  you sir we're gonna try to get as 
[00:29:30]  many people on as possible we got  uh chris in freeport chris what's  up hey guys i love you love the  show yeah thank you chris uh jimmy  i'm a police officer here in  shreveport this it's really  frustrating man because i you get  the opportunity monday morning  quarterback something that nobody  saw the supreme court standard for  police force is if another  reasonable officer based on the  totality of the circumstances would  have done the same thing then it's  reasonable force okay i'm telling 
[00:30:00]  you if a guy that just told me that  he's gonna go get a gun goes out to  his car and then drives his car at  me yeah he's gonna get shot a lot  but there's an officer we had an  officer shoot a guy in the head  last night here in treeport  leaving a burglary when he aimed a  car at him and just about  clicking with the vehicle and i  you're gonna notice that almost  every cop that calls is going to  tell you the same thing i know let  me ask you a question this that's  one of the problems i have with it  with the car argument i i've heard  different things about that because  i was at first like yeah they  should have shot because i heard he  was using the car as a weapon but 
[00:30:30]  maybe he was trying to i don't  know what he was trying to do with  the car but when you say i'm going  to get a gun why don't you stop  that guy why do you wait if you see  a conflict in that in this  situation this is why i'm saying  this was so poorly handled if and  you know what do we do monday  morning quarterback we have to  that's how you you assess what was  done right and wrong do you think  you have a case against somebody  when they say go get my gun and  then you stop him and he doesn't  have a gun and he doesn't have this  and now you don't really have a  a right to search him because all 
[00:31:00]  you he just said go get my gun  that's absolutely to me that is  absolutely a justifiable reason to  search someone and no court would  say you couldn't if a guy said go  get my gun and then you stopped him  and other officers heard him say  that i don't think there's any  court in the land that would give  you a problem for that and it's  like what are you gonna do let it if  a guy says i'm going to get a gun  what cop says okay go get the gun  so i have a case i mean if you're  flying by the seat of your pants  you're trying to to survive when  the guy says i'm go go get my gun  you stop everything right there and 
[00:31:30]  i'm not a cop but that's just who  lets a guy go get a gun doesn't  make sense all right we got a lot of  nypd checking in i don't know mike  uh what's going on  hi what's going on guys hey mike  i'm a cop in the city uh no i  understand exactly what you guys are  saying that uh it sounds excessive but  it's um it's it's hard to judge you  know what i'm saying and uh what what  you guys saying is what why didn't  you stop him as soon as as soon as he  was in the middle of this club saying  go get a gun these guys uh they were 
[00:32:00]  involved with undercover officers which  in that case makes your identity  almost uh obsolete and they were  embedded in an investigation either  into one thing or another and to stop  him in that club that opens up the  entire investigation now that doesn't  make it right to you know let them go  and grab a gun and you know come back  and start shooting the place up but  you know what they do is they follow  them outside to try and stop them  outside and you know when you use a 
[00:32:30]  car as a weapon you know with green  in the city to use deadly physical  force to save our lives another live  or to save our lives or another live  from serious physical injury which  could be caused by getting hit by a  car now this is all contingent upon  the fact too that they did identify  themselves properly i've heard they  did and i've heard they didn't um and  the argument i've heard that was made  that was sean bell driving yeah i'm  pretty sure he was the driver it's  almost like somebody raised a pretty  good point about why is a guy on on  the way to get married gonna just say 
[00:33:00]  i'm running a cop over like it for no  reason at all you're having an argument  a couple guys and all of a sudden you  have real cops and you go i'm gonna run  them over and get married that isn't  even the point though that that that  becomes secondary the point the whole  point in this thing is did those cops  feel like their life was being  threatened to the point where they had  to respond with deadly deadly physical  force and everybody the judge the  cops all determined yes they did and  they were justified but regardless of 
[00:33:30]  they're not thinking in their head hey  this guy does a bachelor party he's  driving why would he do this is he  they react you just have to react  quickly i'm only asking that because  i'm saying did they identify  themselves properly like did he know  it was cops or did he think that it  was some kind of another problem  like what kind of like that's what it's  and to me his his headspace does mean  something because like was he trying  to run cops over or did they maybe not  identify themselves right he's going  that there's a problem here i'm getting  the hell out of here so that's that so  yeah it does matter um and the whole  thing was as an afterthought it matters 
[00:34:00]  but in the moment i don't think it  matters i think it doesn't matter if  they identify themselves yeah when is  this is my question and i again 90% of  the time i think this stuff happens  the cops are justified i really do but  like the 10% of times they're not like  and the police department has to take  a certain line and i hate playing the  house liberal believe me it makes me  sick but it's like you never hear the  cops come out and go you know what they  screwed up we're very i can't remember  when you hear that so it's like if a  hundred percent time they're right how 
[00:34:30]  is anybody ever supposed to to believe  they're right you understand i'm  saying it's like they never call  themselves into question at least  publicly so how like blacks are  getting shot with okay you got the  ally you got that if i was black that  would kind of annoy me i would probably  go well what what is the police  department going to say it was  unjustified force i've seen cases where  they've uh gone to jail or um lost  their job i think it's these cases that  get the most publicity because there is  such a gray area where we don't know 
[00:35:00]  how it's going to end up uh the media  jumps on it with the whole race angle  they love that uh so i think these get  the most publicity but it's usually  these type of situations which result  in the cops being acquitted because it  is this weird justifiable uh situation  that i i don't think a lot of people  understand the laws i don't think a lot  of it that seems to be the problem i  don't think a lot of people understand  that police officers can shoot unarmed  people if they feel that they're armed 
[00:35:30]  that their uh life or the life of their  partners or citizens are in danger uh  they're they're allowed to use deadly  physical force it doesn't have to be an  actual threat a perceived threat uh  against your life or the life of the  people you're trying to protect is  enough to justify the use of deadly  physical force legally yes that's why  again we have an agreement they should  not go to jail but how do you to say  that they shouldn't lose their job i  don't think that was part of the trial  i don't think that was called into  question i don't know that's the 
[00:36:00]  hey they might lose their job you know  i mean who knows now i'm sure the  police department didn't want to admit  to any guilt by firing them before the  trial's over uh that would look a  little fishy you know that would kind  of uh yeah i'm sure there's gonna be  make a little bias more stuff that goes  on yeah we'll see what happens i'm sure  they'll be looked at what they did how  they handled the situation and realize  that mistakes were made and perhaps  they will lose their job we got sal from  the nypd he's gonna uh explain deadly  force uh sal what's up hey guys i 
[00:36:30]  love the show you guys are the best but  uh as a police officer this is a tough  time for us and uh you know we're just  trying to get through it right now let  me explain something to you the penal  law that's a deadly physical force a  person does not have to have a gun but  it's such like a car now i wasn't there  okay and a lot of police officers will  tell you we weren't there so we don't  know the situation okay but of course  at nypd our restrictions someone has to  have basically a gun pointed to us and 
[00:37:00]  for us to use our gun which is a little  ridiculous since the penal law definition  is a lot different than the nypd  definition now so let me ask you a  question not to interrupt you but did did  they violate uh nypd uh standards when  they did what they did or technically  technically uh if you want to go by the  nypd you know as the nine rules here  they they did but you know what i did  the situation the tensions were high you  know if if someone said go get a gun and 
[00:37:30]  you know a car was backing up towards  another police officer i would have took a  shot too you know and and you know my  life comes first before anyone's life and  my fellow police officers life comes first  before you know and but you know the  thing is right now this is this is  turning into uh... you know more of a  racial issue when when two of the police  officers were black and one cop was  lebanese well you know and al shop is  making this a black white issue and it's  not is he saying race though is sharp  insane race other than the victim being 
[00:38:00]  black because i'll take i think the fact  that the cops were all white was why  there weren't riots uh to be honest with  i think there would have been riots like  in la but the cops the even even people  who are pissed off know that it wasn't  like a quote-unquote racist cops but  you know what you know what makes me mad  they're putting these pictures of uh sean bell  they're portraying them at like he's a  sink the guy has a criminal record  they've been arrested before you know he's  not a thing you know and and the daily  news puts pictures of like what was so 
[00:38:30]  bad people you know we give our life and  we were out there every day and we got to  try to defuse situations you know and one  situation and one of the last time there  was a shooting like this maybe like ten  years ago five years ago you know how  about how about in the in the seven o'prest  and a police officer was shot about three  years ago dylan stewart and he was shot by  another black man where was al sharpton on  that he wasn't around for that why because he  only gets involved when it benefits him  well yeah he's a bum yeah we all know that at 
[00:39:00]  this point he's a piece of garbage we all  know that we have the reverend house song we  should play that yeah there's been plenty of uh  cop funerals uh between these these episodes  believe me you never hear anything out of al  sharpton let's go to greg on long island you're  on the opian anthony show what's up greg  hi guys hey i just want to answer that one  question that you you asked uh you know why uh why  don't they the cops just apologize for uh you  know uh shooting them or whatever wait no i'm not  saying that i'm saying like what you never seem to  see like you seem to you never seem to see them 
[00:39:30]  come out and go yeah that was very excessive like  other cops i'm not saying that they the one guy did  apologize i'm sure that they would love to but  they would open themselves up to to a lawsuit in  this country you can't say i screwed up no no not not  them bro not not them i you're and you're right it is  litigious awful uh annoying uh society but i'm  talking about other cops in general like you never  seem to see the other side come out and go yeah what  those officers did was excessive and while it wasn't 
[00:40:00]  criminal they do have to lose their jobs i think if you  heard that occasionally people would give them the  benefit of the doubt a lot more i think this guy brings  up a good point though because then those people get  subpoenaed to repeat that in a civil case for money  when they're being sued the other uh officers being sued  and then you got to sit there on the stand and go yes i  did say that he made a mistake and shouldn't have done  that you know so everyone keeps their mouth shut  okay then cops can't get mad when when everyone constantly 
[00:40:30]  questions every single case so harshly if people are worried  about uh a litigation when something like this happens  of another cop it's not even them so you can't worry  about having to be called to testify yeah when something  like this happens but you know even if you say it's a cop  at another precinct it's not even you then you call a cop  at another precinct to testify well you thought it was  unjust you're being called to testify i'm sure there are i'm  sure there are people out there cops out there uh that uh  think it was unjustified but they're not going to say  anything we got to take another break so uh reverend i was 
[00:41:00]  meeting today to decide what day he's going to shut down new  york city shut down new york city that's it wonderful all right we go to break  with this it's opie and anthony who comes running when the cops get out of hand  who thinks the mayor's in the kukla's clan  yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob  he wears expensive suits but he doesn't have a job  reverend how  reverend how  well he's staffing off the people in his own community 
[00:41:30]  why is the white man always picking on me  he's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease  we hear his battle cry  no justice no peace  the man with a plan who you know you can trust  the portly little reverend with an ass just like a bus  reverend how  reverend how  he's your pal  reverend how

[00:43:30]  hey we're checking out a brand new animation  that came in over the weekend  the animation festival of course is happening  June 5th at the Roseland Ballroom  here in New York City  it is sold out at this point  very very exciting  we got I think $10,000 in prize money so far  that's a lot of cash  I think we're adding more prizes to the thing  all the details and info is up on  onaradio.com  after the animation festival we're going to make these animations  available online but basically  it's animations based on 
[00:44:00]  some of the fine bits you've heard over the years  on the Opie and Anthony show  and somebody sent in an animation  should give him credit  it'll definitely make the animation festival  oh hell yeah  so well done  he did an animation on Steve's Day  good old executive producer  Steve Carlesi  also known as Steve the Bear  he took that  don't worry be happy song  that Drew Boogie  gave us  I don't know  over a year ago at this point  and animated it 
[00:44:30]  it is amazing  how good it is  amazing  animations great  very good job  so we're hoping  more animations come in  in the coming weeks  because we're getting a little nervous  we got  we got a handful so far  and we got  a lot of really good ones  and I'm assuming that  the other animators  are still working on them  for the big festival  we're a month out  a little over a month out  so  a lot of money up for grabs  animation festival  June 5th  at the Roseland Ballroom  don't have to really promote that anymore 
[00:45:00]  it's sold out  and all the details  are on  onaradio.com  the only thing we ask  the animators  two things  you got to send in  a high res copy  the email  the mailing address  is up on  onaradio.com  and our website  that we can't promote  and also  don't show these animations  anywhere  until the festival is over  because we want it to be  a nice big surprise  because  you know  the people that bought tickets  for the animation festival  they're hardcore  faithful listeners  and you know  if you spread this out 
[00:45:30]  on the internet  they're going to see it  ahead of time  these are the type of people  that search out  all our material online  so please do us that favor  but this is what  this is the audio  of what was animated  that we just saw  in the office  Jimmy what did you think of it?  really really well done  amazing right?  yes 
[00:46:00]  thank you so much for watching  We'll be right back. 
[00:46:30]  Monday, Monday, Monday.  We didn't really explain the animation, but basically it's Steve getting ready for work.  His alarm goes off, and he just gets ready, gets in his little hybrid space car and flies to work. 
[00:47:00]  It's very funny.  It's really, really funny.  I think people are going to enjoy it when we do the animation festival June 5th.  Reverend Wright on TV as we were playing.  Don't worry, be happy.  I love this guy.  I just watched you.  He's at the NAACP dinner.  Yeah.  Which is good, because the first black candidate is possibly going to be derailed by this guy.  So the brilliant NAACP gives him a national stage.  Yep.  Instead of this selfish bastard just shutting up, just let Barack get the nomination.  He can't think of anybody but himself.  And the NAACP, these dopes, give the guy a national stage. 
[00:47:30]  Can't you ever look at the bigger picture?  It's all white people are doing is looking at him and tying him to Obama and looking at his crazy political ideas and conspiracy theories and saying, ah, see?  See?  It's an excuse for white people to just say, I won't vote for Obama because of this Reverend Wright guy.  And it's the only thing that can derail Barack right now, I think. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  The only thing that can cause him a problem is Reverend Wright.  So instead of just shutting his mouth for a couple more months, then he can come out and make all the statements you want.  And just, it's stupidity that I can't even fathom.  There's political ads running now that show Reverend Wright and what he was saying and tie him to Obama in various states that are going to be voting.  And, you know, people, it's effective.  People are looking at it and going, eh, I think I like this. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And Hillary's using it against them.  Well, Hillary's pretty much out of the race, though.  Oh.  You watch all the Sunday political shows, this is like, yeah, she's pretty much out.  Well, the NAACP seems to want to drag her right back into it.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Let's give this guy a national stage.  Yeah, no kidding.  Give him a national stage.  That's good.  We got the latest Reverend Wright audio.  Please run and tell my stuck-on stupid friends that Arabic is a language.  It's not a religion. 
[00:49:00]  Barack Hussein Obama.  Barack Hussein Obama.  Barack Hussein Obama.  There are Arabic-speaking Christians, Arabic-speaking Jews, Arabic-speaking Muslims, and Arabic-speaking atheists.  Arabic is a language.  It's not a religion.  Stop trying to scare folks by giving them an Arabic name as if there's some sort of disease.  It's fine.  Man, that's whatever.  I like him.  I really do like him.  I just wish he would shut up for two more months and then keep going. 
[00:49:30]  He's great to listen to.  How can you not like him?  You can't not enjoy what he talks.  He's all fire and brimstone.  Oh, boy.  Get a room listening.  He gets it going.  Now, we can do this break.  We got a lot of very interesting audio that came in.  And also, we're going to have some audio of this incest story that's going to be huge today.  I'm telling you.  This daughter that was repeatedly raped by her father for 24 years and kept in the basement  and was pregnant seven times by her own father.  Yikes.  Six of the kids lived. 
[00:50:00]  We're going to have the latest on that hopefully in about 15, 20 minutes.  We got Bush at the correspondence dinner making just hilarious jokes.  That's always the best when they do that correspondence dinner and the president gets out there and just starts telling jokes.  We got an ump that got knocked out cold.  He got knocked the F out.  By a 96-mile-an-hour fastball, which is pretty amazing.  And we have a brand-new Hillary Clinton song.  Oh, I like the other one, though.  The Laverne Shirley? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Who doesn't like that one?  Well, the weird thing about this, Sophie B. Hawkins, remember her?  Damn, I wish I was.  Yeah, the damn song.  Well, she reworked the song to say, damn, we wish you were our president.  You want to take a quick listen?  Oh, please.  I don't think we're going to make it through the whole song, but a little taste.  I've heard enough.  It stinks.  One hit wonder.  Zilch.  Hillary, you're making history. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, wow.  It doesn't matter how they try to bring you down.  Just don't give in.  Brilliance is beneath the skin.  Oh, wow.  We have a dream.  You'll be our hero.  Damn.  Wish you were president.  Oh, shoehorned.  She's doing a song parody with her own hit song. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  This isn't another band.  It's the actual.  No, it isn't.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  It's actually.  See, I didn't know that.  It's actually Sophie B.  Hawkins working.  Okay.  I was going to say, wow, she kind of sounds, you know, but she can't really hit the note  like she used to, but she's doing her own song parody to her own hit song.  Oh, that's horrible.  I wish you were president.  You rock us in the street like house.  Make us independent and strong.  You are everything America represents. 
[00:52:00]  You do such things to ease our pain.  We all might have to bring us home again.  It's got to suck to be a one hit wonder.  Yeah.  You're just spending the rest of your musical career trying to come up with that second  hit.  How long ago did her hit come out? 
[00:52:30]  God, that was 90s, right?  Yeah.  I would guess early 90s.  I'm going to guess like 92.  Like when do you realize after you're a one hit wonder, like that's what I am?  Like how many, like sometimes you take a couple of years to get it.  Like look, stupid Meatloaf had won an album and then many, many years later he has another  massive hit.  But when do you finally go, that's not coming?  No.  I got to go do something else.  Yeah.  This is how she used to sound, by the way.  Right to the hook there, Iraq.  Damn.  I wish I was your lover. 
[00:53:00]  I'm going to produce.  Yeah, sounds like she couldn't quite get up the money that she used to get.  Produced that.  Yeah.  And now here it is reworked.  A woman's place is in the White House. 
[00:53:30]  Damn.  White House bathroom cleaning that toilet.  You're a president.  You'll rock us till the daylight comes.  Make us independent and strong.  You are everything America represents.  Really?  It's just soft and it's horrible and it's full of lies.  Who knew we had Sophie B. Hawkins fans listening to our show? 
[00:54:00]  Jimmy Collins from Poughkeepsie.  He writes, hey, be fair.  Rope, Sophie had another song, As I Lay Me Down.  It was a top five in 1995.  Was it?  As I Lay Me Down.  Whatever.  Most people just remember, damn, I wish I was your lover.  All right.  There's not much going on with that thing, obviously.  You want to hear the play-by-play of Umt getting knocked out by a 96-mile-an-hour fastball?  Sure.  Just shows you these guys are just robots.  I mean, this is a pretty significant thing that happened, obviously. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Pitch, I think, bounced off the ground and hit the umpire square in the head, and he's  out cold, and this is how they called it.  Pretty exciting call, I have to be honest.  Pull over, folks, first.  The audio is amazingly engaging.  Esteban Loaiza.  Dodgers will then go out on the road, and they'll start in Florida, and oh my gosh.  The first pitch.  Oh my gosh.  Oh my gosh.  I think the FCC, I think the baseball community, I think the station you're broadcasting  on will all accept a god in that situation. 
[00:55:00]  He was able to keep it safe with, oh my gosh.  And they'll start in Florida, and oh my gosh.  The first pitch is in the dirt, bounces up, and hits the umpire.  And Kerwin Danley, who is the crew chief, on his back.  I'm not quite sure.  He'd have to look at the tape to see where the ball hit him, but it was in the dirt and  bounced up.  Here it is.  Here comes the ball, off the glove, and it got him, I believe, on the neck, under the 
[00:55:30]  mask, and just about knocked him out.  Wow.  All he can muster up is a, wow.  Wow.  What do you got on that, Danny?  Good gravy.  It's just funny, because the guy, the commentators, they get it completely wrong.  The ball did not, if you watch the video, it didn't bounce in the dirt at all.  He took a 96 mile an hour fastball to the face.  That ball was nowhere near the dirt.  Really? 
[00:56:00]  I think, he probably was, he was probably looking at his scotch and water on the side  or something.  I watched it.  Look at this.  It didn't hit the dirt.  It hit the catcher's glove on the other night.  Oh my God.  I watched this video probably.  That's an oh my God, not a gosh, and wow.  Probably 25 times.  We'll get the video up on onaradio.com later today, unless you find it yourself, but check  this out.  Here's the windup, and then all of a sudden, I don't even think, I don't even think,  I don't even think, he goes down in slow motion, and his legs are up. 
[00:56:30]  It didn't hit him in the neck, though, did it?  It hit him square in the head.  Square in the face.  Oh my, it hit him like in the jaw.  That's how you knock someone out.  He had a mask on if it were to be dead.  Good eyes.  You can't knock, good eyes.  I don't think you can knock someone out by hitting him in the neck, but I mean, you hit  anywhere in that jaw that hard, he's going down.  I'll bet you the umpire wasn't calling a game, and so the catch went, man, we'll let this  one fly over.  That'll show you, that'll show you to call an inside pitcher strike.  Wow, what a lame call.  Who was on the play-by-play for that? 
[00:57:00]  I gotta get their names.  It was an out-of-town game.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, gosh, and wow.  No, that's like, holy crap.  Oh, golly gee willikers.  You're right, it was a bad call.  Looks like it bounced off the backstop.  I know it did.  Yeah, it went off the third baseman.  It is Vince Scully.  I thought it was Vince Scully.  Thank you.  I was going to say it's Vince Scully.  It sounded like him, but then I'm thinking to myself, I think Vince Scully died a few  years back, but of course Vince Scully's a legend. 
[00:57:30]  You don't have to tell me.  It sounded like him.  I just thought it might have been someone that just was a sound-alike.  Look at him go down.  Bam!  Legs in the air as he's out pulled on his back.  He looks like he's going to have a gynecological exam for a few seconds there.  Looks like his legs are going to be in a stirrup.  He should have laid another pitch into him when he was laying there.  That hit just off the right side of his jaw, front jaw. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Glass jaw on that fat bastard.  Oh my god, that guy.  Out cold.  He's lucky he's not dead though.  Imagine if he didn't have that mask and he had bigger teeth and he was just smiling.  You mean if Rich Voss was behind home plate?  Hi.  Yes.  Louie Bings.  Louie Bings.  I was thinking of that all weekend.  For some reason it would pop in my head.  I just started laughing.  Ah.  Buy new Louie Bings.  They're the best beans out there.  Louie Bings. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  I've officially seen this now 24 times and it's not getting old.  Not even close to getting old.  I want this looped as an hour and a half and released as a movie.  He catches the ball right.  Like the catcher puts his arm above.  Catcher.  It doesn't even deflect.  Like now the more times you see it, the catcher completely missed it.  I thought at first that.  It looks like it bounced off the Goodyear blimp.  Yeah, yeah.  And came down.  It was a fly ball.  That was.  No, it was.  How could you say this was in the dirt and popped up?  I mean, the catcher completely missed it. 
[00:59:00]  At first you think it goes off the catcher's glove, but catcher just missed it.  Yeah.  What a bad catcher.  Yeah.  He wasn't paying attention.  No, he obviously was doing something else.  I mean, those guys could have his legs up in the air.  See his bulge.  Yeah.  He's funny.  You can see his taint through his pants.  His punt.  Yeah.  Someone like Vince Scully, he could freaking call a baseball game in his sleep.  So he's probably doing something else.  Well, apparently he was.  Still, we got it completely wrong.  The line drive to the third baseman.  Oh, no.  They hit the catcher's glove and hit the man's face.  It hit him? 
[00:59:30]  Well, it did.  He was probably checking out the girls on Pal Talk as he's calling the baseball game.  He is out!  Too bad John Sterling didn't have a call.  The umperino goes down.  How about stupid Susan Walden?  And that would have been a time for some excitement.  Oh, yeah.  Goodness gracious!  Well, her favorite pitcher is in the news today, too.  Roger Clemens, they're saying, had a 10-year affair with that country singer.  What's her name?  Does anyone remember her name?  Dolly Parton?  Does it matter? 
[01:00:00]  No, she was 15 when this liaison was supposed to have started.  Ended.  Ended.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Yeah, what's her name?  Miley Cyrus?  No.  Swing in a mess.  Hannah Montana.  Well, she's in the paper, too.  We'll get into her story in a minute.  That is so stupid, that story.  Yeah, we'll save it for a minute or two.  But it's, yeah, Mindy McCready.  They met when she was 15.  She was doing some karaoke singing, and Roger Clemens happened to be in the bar.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  And he was 28 with two kids already, and he threw a shirt that he signed and a few other  ballplayers signed on stage, and then they met.  And he's saying that there was no, like, sexual thing.  Panky or panky.  No sexual thing going on, but that they know each other very, very well over the last 10 years.  There's other people saying that it's complete BS, and that they had an affair for 10 years.  A 10-year fling.  Wow.  And she didn't even know he was married until she went to a Red Sox game, I think it was,  and was reading, like, the program, and it gave him his stats. 
[01:01:00]  Like, he's 28.  He's married.  A little 15-year-old.  Oh, he said, I'm going to the game.  Right.  Well, this is great.  Wait, what do you mean, married?  Yeah.  So, that's a biggie today.  That's a big story that has hit.  So.  Is she a good singer, at least?  I don't know, man.  She's had all sorts of problems over the years.  E-Rock's got her song.  Can we at least hear part of the hook?  I'm curious to what she sounds like.  More sounds on the O.P. Anthony show.  Is this her hit song? 
[01:01:30]  Is this the biggest hit she ever had?  All right, let's see how many people in this studio recognize this song.  All righty.  Go ahead.  I just do it all the time.  You expect us to understand.  When the shoe's on the other foot.  Know that's when it hits the fan.  Get over it, honey.  Life's a two-way street.  Or you won't be a man of mine.  So I had some beers with the girls last night.  The girls do it all the time. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yuck.  Wow.  That dumb country music.  I know we broadcast to a lot of country music places, but ugh.  She really puts the tree in country.  You know, it's FM.  Wow.  Her follow-up hit was, Roger put his sweaty rosin bag on my nose.  Very funny, Jimmy. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, Bush at the correspondence dinner.  We're doing a little bit of everything this break here.  Roger Clemens takes the mound.  And, of course, there's nothing on it.  There's plenty of grass on other parts of the field.  Yeah, it's true.  There's just one area on the field.  There's no grass.  That would be the mound.  Here's Bush trying to be funny.  Bush.  President Bush once again showing he has comedic chops and more. 
[01:03:00]  The president made his final appearance at the annual whiteout correspondence dinner last night  and brought down the house with his conducting skills.  I'm going to say my farewell to you by doing something I've always wanted to do.  Imitation of our Bud Dwyer.  How about that?  The president conducted the U.S. Marine Band through a number of patriotic marches.  It'd be funny if he made his lipstick and did some soft show.  He comes out in blackface.  Fab Calloway impression.  Here we go. 
[01:03:30]  This ought to be funny.  Screw it.  I can't be elected again.  I'll listen to some of the jokes.  He's just terrific.  Oh, he tears them out.  Senator McCain's not here.  He probably wanted to distance himself from me a little bit.  You know, he's not alone.  Jenna's moving out, too.  The two Democratic candidates aren't here either.  Senator Clinton couldn't get into the building because of sniper fire and Senator Obama's at church. 
[01:04:00]  I like the sniper fire line.  That's funny.  Well, he didn't write it.  Church line's good.  Yeah, he got it.  Who wrote his material?  Do you know, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Usually we know the people that go down there and write the material for the president.  They probably have guys like Tonight Show writers or Letterman writers.  They probably have bonafide TV clean writers.  Yeah.  Why don't we go to a break with one of our Bush remixes?  We haven't played this in a really, really long time.  This is so creepy.  It's Bush pretty much singing Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Somebody took a lot of his speeches and were able to find all the words. 
[01:04:30]  A word at a time.  A word at a time.  Found like all the words that make up Sunday, Bloody Sunday and came up with this as we go  to break on the Opie and Anthony show.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  I can't believe the news today. 
[01:05:00]  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long?  Let's be singing this song.  How long?  Too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Our broken bottles under killing speed.  I'm a stern across the goddamn street.  But I won't leave the battle hard.  It puts my back up.  Puts my back up against the wall.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday. 
[01:05:30]  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  How long?  Let's sing this song. 
[01:06:00]  How long? How long? Let's be singing this song. How long? Too long. Too long.  Tonight, we can be as one. Tonight, tonight, tonight.  Sunday, Sunday. Sunday, Sunday. Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. 
[01:06:30]  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember.  Park, park.com.  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your shot of eyes.  Sunday, Sunday.  Sunday, Sunday. 
[01:07:00]  Sunday, Sunday.  Sunday, Sunday.  Let's roll.  And it's true, not a mean.  What fact is fiction and TV reality?  And today, the millions are.  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.  Sunday is Sunday. 
[01:07:30]  Sunday is Sunday.  Sunday is Sunday.  Sunday is Sunday.  Sunday is Sunday.  Yeah, exactly.  How's everybody this morning?  for a Monday.  Why?  Stupid Monday.  877-212-ON-A.  What else is going on in the world?  Baby Mama's number one at the box office. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  I didn't see it, but I did hear it was a funny movie.  I actually went on Saturday to get out of the house.  What?  Yeah.  It was all right.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  It's one of those movies that, you know,  you can't even say it's like an all-out chick flick.  It's all right.  That guy, Dax, or Dex.  How do you say his name?  Yeah, he was pretty damn funny in it.  The one that was banging Kate Hudson?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I heard her and Owen got back together  way to the gossip section of the show.  Good thing.  Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, you know, 
[01:08:30]  they're really funny.  Both of them are very funny people.  Yeah, everything Tina Fey touches now.  I mean, the movie's getting 60% of Rotten Tomatoes.  That's really good.  That's good reviews, absolutely.  And number one at the box office.  And Amy's a really funny improv.  I've watched her improv.  It's depressing.  It's because I stink at improv.  And I've watched her do it,  and it's just like, it's brilliant,  and it annoys me.  Yeah.  Like, look, everything I do goes below the waist  in three seconds.  It's a little hooker joke. 
[01:09:00]  I stink at improv.  The only problem is that Tina Fey plays  the exact same character in everything she does.  If you like 30 Rock, she's that character  in Baby Mama.  Amy Poehler, though, you know,  just out loud funny, man.  Out loud funny.  But I realize I just can't go to the movies.  I can't do it.  No.  I have a nice system for the first time in my life.  First of all, I mean, we've brought this up many times,  but it just looks so dated  as you're sitting in that theater. 
[01:09:30]  So dated.  When are they going to update the movie theaters?  Yeah.  Because now pretty much anyone  could get a flat screen at home.  Well, not everyone.  So the people that are going to the movies  are more and more boisterous.  Yeah.  I would say more and more boisterous.  And the thing that drives me nuts,  I'm sitting there and I'm trying to figure out  how can they allow, like, the candy wrappers  and just the noisiest.  It's just, it drives me nuts. 
[01:10:00]  That doesn't bother me.  It drives me insane.  The first half hour of my movie experience  is just miserable  as everyone is shoving as much food  down their throats as possible.  And then finally everyone gets done  with their candy and popcorn.  And then finally I can enjoy the movie.  It's just something about that  and vacuum cleaners that go right through me.  They're just opening up the packaging  and it's, like, so effing loud.  Yeah.  I do hate that.  But anyway, hey, we got a crazy incest story 
[01:10:30]  that is hitting today.  And the news is going to be all over this.  Man, this lady was imprisoned  by her own father in Austria for 24 years.  Austria.  Raped repeatedly.  Seven children.  Six survived.  Locked in the basement for 24 years.  They just assumed she was missing.  I don't know.  And I think he was, I don't know.  Let's get to the story  and try to figure out what's up with this.  This is the house where a 42-year-old Austrian woman 
[01:11:00]  claims she was kept locked up for 24 years.  Yes.  For 24 years.  Yes.  This is the place.  She claims she was locked up  with nothing to eat but wasabi and sushi.  How do you get away with this for 24 years?  Oh, wow.  If you attempted to do this for a weekend,  you'd be out of your mind.  In jail.  Yeah, obviously,  but you'd be out of your mind freaked out.  Oh, yeah.  How do you pull this off for 24 years?  This is the house where a 42-year-old Austrian woman 
[01:11:30]  claims she was kept locked up for 24 years  and abused by her father.  She is said to have six children by him during that time.  The case only came to light  when the eldest child, now 19,  became seriously ill  and had to go to hospital.  Police...  To hospital.  What is it, the hospital?  He's going to university.  The university.  Do we know anything else on this?  I don't get it.  How about the kid could have taken a note to someone  when he was 12?  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  19 years old, he's sick,  they've got to get him to the hospital  and that's how this all comes out.  Yeah.  Come on.  Ill and had to go to hospital.  Police said the search for the child's mother  led to the shocking discovery.  Shocking.  And this is what they found out.  This was not a mother abandoning her child.  The mother was kept in prison by her own father  for 24 years in the basement of their house  and subjected to sexual abuse.  The unfortunate woman has had six children  since her 18th birthday,  presumably some of them in her prison,  and all of them supposedly were fathered by her father. 
[01:12:30]  The victim has been named only as Elizabeth F.  It's claimed she had a son.  Elizabeth F.  Elizabeth F.  You couldn't say the whole word.  You claimed it by the rules.  Elizabeth F.  The victim has been named only as Elizabeth F.  It's claimed she had a seventh child  who died in infancy.  The alleged abuser's wife  was apparently unaware  of what was happening in the basement  where the man provided food and clothing  for his daughter and three of the children.  How is she unaware? 
[01:13:00]  Wait, wait.  The guy had a wife?  Apparently.  I'm getting the story the same time you are.  How the hell does he have a wife?  27 years,  he's got his daughter locked up in the basement  having sex with her and kids,  and the wife doesn't know?  Come on.  Can you say denial?  Yeah.  Apparently unaware  of what was happening in the basement  where the man provided food and clothing  for his daughter  and three of the children.  DNA samples had been taken  from all the people involved.  The case has evoked memories  of another Austrian woman, 
[01:13:30]  Natasha Kampusch.  She spent eight years  locked up by her kidnapper  in a windowless cell  before dashing to freedom  in August 2006.  Dashing.  You sure like doing that in Austria, huh?  The difference is 24 years,  like the kids were there  with her the whole time  or did the kid take,  like,  I don't understand the timeline.  He said he started abusing her  when she was 11.  24 plus 11 is 35.  She's 42.  What happened with those seven years?  Those seven years.  Yes.  Around,  I don't know,  somewhere in there 
[01:14:00]  they claimed she ran away.  So obviously he was abusing his daughter  while they were all living together still.  Oh, okay.  And somewhere in there  he locked her in the basement  and then claimed that she ran  and they just assumed  she was gone forever.  Right.  But no,  she was in the basement  the whole time  popping out kids  that are crying bloody murder  and the wife doesn't notice  and there's something  that's going on in the basement.  I mean,  more is going to come out  on this story.  Is there anything else  in the AP story, Jimmy?  Not really?  Pretty much.  I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah,  we got to read through it.  This is a biggie  that's just hitting,  but unbelievable.  The guy who held the young girl,  she was 10 years old.  There's another case in 98  and she was held  for eight and a half years.  But this guy  threw himself in front of the train  hours after she got away.  You're right.  Yeah,  let's go to Ray in Jersey.  Ray,  you got something on this story?  Yeah,  I was reading CNN this morning.  They were saying  this father  evidently pre-planned this  because he built a kitchen  and a bedroom  in the basement  with no one knowing  that's controlled 
[01:15:00]  by an electronic passcode.  So he had a keypad  somewhere hidden in the house  to dial in  to go screw his daughter.  And he only told anybody  about it when the police  showed up.  He was like,  oh, by the way,  the keypad's over here,  here's the code.  And that's when they found  all these other kids.  But how did he explain  to his wife  the screaming babies  down in the basement?  He found me, man.  I mean,  maybe,  I don't know,  a baby monitor  from the door  or HBO  or something good.  Who knows?  Was it kind of like  a basement apartment  and he's just saying, 
[01:15:30]  oh, that's got to be  somebody that's living  below us?  I mean,  I don't get it.  And what about the kids?  Did they go to school  and leave the house?  Because you can't keep  like six kids  locked up in a basement  with their mom  for 24 years.  Yeah,  what do you do?  The way the article read,  they said that  out of the six kids,  he and his wife  adopted three of them  and raised them  as normal kids.  He told the wife  the whole time  that his missing daughter  kept showing up  and leaving kids  on their doorstep  in the night.  Oh, okay. 
[01:16:00]  Let me just jump in here.  You're really helping us  out, actually, Ray.  According to the police statement,  Joseph F.  and his wife,  Rosemary,  had told authorities  they had found  those children  outside their home  in 1993, 1994,  and 1997,  each time with a note  from the mother.  In the first letter,  Elizabeth F.  had apparently said  she already had  a daughter and son.  In another letter,  she said she gave birth  to another son  in December 2002.  So basically,  I guess the father  was making believe  that these kids  were being dropped 
[01:16:30]  off at the doorstep  and then raised them  as his own,  as his own daughter  is still downstairs  locked up.  Right.  And he was repeatedly  raping.  Oh, my God.  Would he just let her  have the kid alone  down there?  Where's Maury?  I just want to know  where's Maury  when we need him.  So three were living  with the father  and this other wife  or his wife,  I should say.  The other three children  were apparently  held captive  in the cellar  with their mother.  Yeah.  So then,  okay,  so then the 19-year-old  that was really sick  and had to go to the hospital, 
[01:17:00]  I guess,  I'm assuming that 19-year-old  was with the father  and the wife.  Yeah.  And somehow they were  looking for the real mother  and then I don't know  how it led to,  you know,  discovering what the hell  was going on  for 24 years.  Like I said,  this story just hit  late last night  on CNN.com.  A lot of odd,  unanswered questions.  Huh?  The 19-year-old  evidently had a note  from the mother  asking for help  is what CNN said.  Oh, okay.  Unbelievable.  24 years,  she finally gets tired of it  and sends a note out.  You know,  it's boring.  Well,  but I'm saying, 
[01:17:30]  how did she not  figure out a way?  Maybe the passcode  worked both ways  so that,  like,  if she killed  the father down there,  she wouldn't have been able  to get out  because she didn't know  the passcode.  But couldn't she have  knocked on the door hard?  You got to think  that there was some kind  of soundproofing going on  because you got to think  somebody was yelling  and screaming.  Yeah.  Yeah,  or at least it had to be  some kind of dance party.  Right.  And maybe the daughter  was too scared to yell  and was just going  with the whole thing.  But,  I mean,  you got to think  the kids were just  crying all hours of the night,  especially when they were younger.  Yeah,  I want to see an interview  with the wife.  I want to find out  exactly what kind 
[01:18:00]  of mental capabilities  this woman has  that my daughter  has been missing,  but don't worry,  she comes back  every few months  with another baby.  It's cool.  Yeah,  no kidding.  We're seeing a picture  of this guy.  Look to you right there,  Jimmy.  What a creep.  Oh,  what a ghoul.  What a ghoul.  Yes.  Mustachioed fella.  Steven S. from Bayshore,  not only is she  the kid's mother,  but she's also their sister.  Charming.  There you go.  All right,  thanks, Ray,  for helping us out  with that one,  all right?  His hair is mussy  to the dad.  He has a...  Yes.  In other news,  Miley Cyrus  is creating 
[01:18:30]  quite the controversy today  because what,  she showed her back  in a photo shoot  or something?  Her back  in a Vanity Fair  photo shoot.  Vanity Fair  is known for getting  some outrageous...  Who's that?  That's the other photo.  Wait,  no,  it isn't.  What?  It's not her.  Shut up.  The two on the celebrity sites  are this one  from Vanity Fair  and this one right there.  Who's that?  It's supposedly  Miley Cyrus.  I don't think it is.  We're looking at a picture  of a topless girl.  What's with the stars  over the boobs? 
[01:19:00]  That's pulling down  her like Abercrombie shorts,  Abercrombie fits,  you know,  boy shorts,  revealing like a thong  and this girl  is wearing a headband  and she's got her hair  and a ponytail  and she's like  pushing her chest  way out.  It don't really look like her.  It doesn't look like her?  Not really.  Little resemblance.  Doesn't really look like her.  What website is that on,  E-Rock,  for the people out there  that want to check it out  for themselves?  This one was from  egotastic.com. 
[01:19:30]  But that looks like  an underage girl.  How do they get away with that?  Well, her breasts  are bleeped.  You can't see anything.  She's not,  she's dressed.  That's why,  yeah.  She has stars over  where her breasts are.  Yeah, that ain't her.  That's not her.  Stop it.  It's just a look like it.  Stop it.  Go to the other one.  Ant's an expert at this stuff.  Of course she is.  Yeah, that ain't her.  It's not her.  Yeah, that ain't bad though.  Ant,  give it another year,  please.  That one's still cooking.  Give it another year.  Done.  It's almost, 
[01:20:00]  no,  it's almost done.  I like it rare.  That's not even  a good picture of her actually.  The one in Vanity Fair  is not even a good shot.  No,  and it's just her  showing her back.  At Vanity Fair  is known for,  you know,  doing edgy photographs  of celebrities and stuff  and they got,  yeah,  the picture is her  with what,  like kind of a silk  like sheet or wrap  that's kind of,  she's holding up  to her boobies.  It's because she's 15.  And it goes way down  on her back  so you can see  her complete back. 
[01:20:30]  That's it.  You know,  she's a big 15.  It's not like  they're putting  Dakota Fanning  on there  next year maybe.  Well,  it's creating  a media tizzy  they're calling it.  The 15-year-old star  of Hannah Montana  is a teen TV sensation  but today she's gracing  the front page  of the New York Post.  It's a photo shoot  for Vanity Fair magazine  that has the singer  putting out apologies  to her fans.  The provocative photos  taken by legendary  photographer Annie Leibovitz  show Miley Cyrus  clutching a blanket  to her chest  with her back exposed. 
[01:21:00]  The teen released  a statement  about the racy photos  to People.com  saying, quote,  I took part  in a photo shoot  that was supposed  to be artistic  and now seeing  the photographs  and reading the story  I feel so embarrassed.  Her father,  Billy Ray Cyrus  also poses  in the photo shoot.  Nothing to be  embarrassed about.  She's embarrassed  about...  She's trying to  protect her fortune.  Save that Disney job.  Yeah,  this girl makes  something like  a million dollars  was a...  What?  A week?  No, no.  Episode? 
[01:21:30]  No, a million dollars  per concert.  I was just reading.  Is that true?  Something like  a million dollars  per concert date.  I think it just came out  that she made  18 million last year.  18 million dollars.  Wow.  Here's more to the story.  The Disney Channel  took a stand  issuing a statement  that unfortunately,  as the article suggests,  a situation was created  to deliberately manipulate  a 15-year-old  in order  to sell magazines.  They ain't blaming her.  Why would she  like agree to this  knowing what  Disney's all about?  Because now I'm seeing  other, you know, 
[01:22:00]  photos from the photo shoots.  There's nothing wrong  with that,  but the fact is  she's working for Disney  so that could be  a major problem for her.  Disney's not letting her go.  She's so popular  she could pose with her goat  and they would find a way  to make an excuse for it.  And if they got rid of her,  she'd get picked up  in a second  by somebody else.  The kids seem to love her.  Yeah.  Well, because she  talks like a 30-year-old.  I'm trying to get her  on Foundry.  Yeah.  Let's say how to Tom.  Foundry.  The girls of Foundry. 
[01:22:30]  Foundry made  the New York Times yesterday.  It certainly did.  I'll explain.  Trying to get us in trouble.  No kidding.  I'll explain in a second,  but Tom in Florida,  what do you got, Tom,  on the incest story?  Hey, I heard that  the dad took,  the dad,  which was the grandfather  of this child,  took her to the hospital,  the 19-year-old,  when she was sick,  really, really sick,  couldn't explain,  or she had a note  from her mother  explaining that  she was held captive  and everything like that.  It didn't add up  with police, 
[01:23:00]  so eventually  the story unraveled,  and he brought  the daughter,  who he had captive  for 24 years,  out,  and, you know,  it just kept getting  fishier and fishier  with the police,  and then so they  investigated it further.  Well, he really shed  a lot more light  on that story.  I hate you,  Ant.  Well, no,  you should hate  all of us,  because Ant just said  what we're all,  we're thinking,  including the listeners.  I want to add  one more thing. 
[01:23:30]  Ron and Fez,  noon to three.  Thank you, Tom.  All right.  Very nice.  Yeah, halfway through that,  I'm like,  oh, my God,  he has nothing else  to add to this  story there.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah, I don't think  it's any big deal.  I mean,  15.  Talking about  the Miley Cyrus thing.  She's got a sheet on her.  Yeah.  That's a normal picture.  That's not a...  It's not even a good picture.  If she was showing  a little side T, 
[01:24:00]  that's one thing,  you know,  where the arm is moved,  but she's not even  showing any side.  It's a back.  It's a scoliosis test.  She looks dirty.  Like, I don't mean  sexually dirty.  It just doesn't look  like a clean photo.  It's not a good picture.  I don't think  it's a good picture at all.  She's going to grow up  to be ugly.  Maybe.  She's got youth  on her side right now.  When we get back,  we're going to tell you  about a half-eaten waffle.  Okay.  Jesus?  No. 
[01:24:30]  Mary?  No.  Joseph?  No.  A diamond?  No.  AIDS?  Very famous celebrity  that's in the news  almost every day now.  Jim Norton?  It halved his waffle,  and it went up on eBay.  Uh-huh.  And you're not going to believe  how much the bidding  got up to.  Well, you're doing  a Channel 11 tease.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We'll answer all those. 
[01:25:00]  I already know the answer.  Yeah, go ahead.  It was Owen Wilson,  and the bidding went up  to $11.  I have no idea.  I'm an idiot.  There you go.  Moving right along  with the Opie and Anthony show.  So I got a Google alert  last night  with our names in it,  and the New York Times 
[01:25:30]  did a piece on racist cartoons.  I don't know if it's in  today's New York Times  or yesterday's.  They're like old cartoons,  old Warner Brothers cartoons,  things that were put out,  you know,  mainstream stuff.  But, you know,  they portrayed blacks  in a stereotypical ill light,  and they're not,  wouldn't be considered  acceptable or politically  correct today.  So they've taken these things  and pretty much tried to  eliminate them from history. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Like they never were,  never existed.  Did these cartoons run on TV  back in the day?  Oh, yeah.  Or in movie houses?  Like, how did that work out?  Do you know, Ant?  Were they in just regular rotation?  Because, I mean,  the N.A.A.C.P. there,  yes.  They were all over this  back in 1943.  Oh, they didn't like it then?  No.  So we got dragged  into this story.  Cartoons of a racist past  lurk on YouTube. 
[01:26:30]  Among the millions of clips  on the video sharing website  YouTube are 11 racially offensive  Warner Brothers cartoons  that have not been shown  in an authorized release  since 1968.  So they've been banned  for, what, 40 years?  But that's kind of funny  that in 68  they were still showing them.  So for 40 years,  like, no one has seen  the light of day.  I actually got a copy  of all these cartoons  from my old pal, Buzzy.  Yeah.  Buzzy got all the cool stuff  way before the internet.  Buzzy was the internet  before the internet.  Somehow he was able 
[01:27:00]  to, like, collect  all this crazy stuff.  Some of the cartoons  were removed  on April 16th  from YouTube, that is.  A message saying  the cartoons were no longer  available because of  a copyright claim  by Warner appeared  in their place.  By evening,  the messages disappeared  and some of the cartoons  were back.  The cartoons known  as the Censored 11  have been unavailable  to the public  for 40 years.  Postings no longer appear  if YouTube is searched  for Cole Black  and De Seven Dwarfs.  I'm just reading this, folks. 
[01:27:30]  A parody of Snow White,  no kidding,  and the most famous  of the cartoons.  But a search for Cole Black  does find the cartoon, still.  Oh, yeah?  These cartoons  were controversial  when first released.  The NAACP  unsuccessfully protested  Cole Black  before it was shown  in 1943.  So they were trying  to get this shut down  in 1943.  They were unsuccessful  back then.  Richard McIntyre,  the director of communications  for the NAACP, 
[01:28:00]  wrote in an email message  that the cartoons  are despicable.  We encourage the film's owners  to maintain them  as they are.  You're despicable.  That is locked away  in their vaults.  Vaults.  W-M-A-V-O-1,  a YouTube user  who posted some  of the cartoons  and preferred  not to give his name,  wrote in an email message  that these cartoons  were never officially  banned by any law  and added that  the cartoons  had historical value.  W-M-A-V-O-1  said the cartoons  were available  on websites like, 
[01:28:30]  and they mentioned  Steve's website,  I don't know if they're  going to dump out,  so I'll just say that,  which is run by  the Opie and Anthony show,  a talk radio program.  So how the hell  did we get dragged  into this?  We're running Foundry?  Because I posted  one of those clips  when someone said it to me  maybe three years ago,  and of course  I was tagging  everything by then  because it shows up  on YouTube  with the tags on it.  Yes.  And I've since  taken it down,  so I mean,  again,  it pops up.  You didn't put this  on YouTube?  No,  I didn't put that  on YouTube. 
[01:29:00]  No,  but people can grab  the video however  they want,  they can put it  wherever,  so I've since  taken it down.  Can we get the audio  of Cole Black?  We're watching it  on YouTube right now.  They spelled seven  with two B's  instead of V.  They spelled it wrong.  They spelled seven.  And why does this  only get four out  of five stars?  Just kidding.  I don't like the idea,  I mean,  I understand that  Warner Brothers  isn't going to show them,  they are pretty brutal,  but to ban things  like that,  when there's news  footage of murder,  it's like,  again,  it's a misdirected  energy,  all right?  You can't show them 
[01:29:30]  any,  why is the Times  doing an article  on YouTube  having some  But it's not just  these cartoons  that are being,  I'm sorry.  Have you ever seen  these cartoons,  Jimmy,  in their entirety?  Yes.  Oh my God,  it's brutal.  All it is is like  black guys being lazy  with flies like  around their head  eating watermelon  as,  isn't,  this is in some  of the Bugs Bunny,  cartoons,  right Ant?  Oh yeah.  The ones we saw?  Yep.  Just brutal stuff,  man.  I don't think  any of this stuff  should be bad,  but I could see  where people would 
[01:30:00]  have a problem  with it.  Look at that,  we,  oh,  go back to that clip,  it says,  we rub out anyone.  Murder Incorporated.  Murder Incorporated,  we rub out anyone,  you gotta go back,  and it says,  no,  a little further back  there,  oh no,  alright,  it was after this,  okay.  We're trying to get  the audio of this,  I don't know if  it'll play well  on the radio,  but,  sure it will.  But you could put,  you could put  Cold Black  in the search  and it pops  right up still. 
[01:30:30]  We rub out anybody,  one dollar,  midgets,  half price,  well,  can't say that word,  Jewish American  princesses,  you know,  the,  why would they want  to kill Jewish  American princesses?  Yeah.  And this company  will kill them  for free,  according to this  cartoon.  Obviously this was  made during  World War II,  so.  Yeah,  but this is like,  this is Warner  Brothers.  Warner Brothers  cartoons.  Derogatory term  for Japanese people.  Is that what that was?  Yeah.  I don't know,  I don't see it.  Let's say hi to Dave  in Jersey.  Dave,  you're on the  Opie and Anthony 
[01:31:00]  show.  Hey,  morning guys,  how's it going?  Good,  Dave.  Yeah,  the Seven Dwarfs,  oh my God,  you want to talk  about so stereotypical,  I mean,  you've got the  Prince Charming,  who looks like  your typical  70s pimp.  Right.  And he comes out  with this huge,  huge rimmed hat,  and the best part  is when he flashes  his teeth,  there are dice  that are there.  There are dice?  Oh yeah,  there it is.  There's a dice  in place of his  two front teeth.  Yeah,  and the white,  well,  Snow White,  which obviously 
[01:31:30]  isn't Snow White  in this one,  I mean,  is obviously,  the Seven look like,  she looks like  she came out  of that basement  from 24 years ago  with all those kids.  I mean,  she is literally  the worst looking chick  you've ever seen  in your goddamn life.  That's how,  I hate this  African-American she is,  if I could say that.  Yeah,  we're looking at it now.  Can we,  of course we're not  going to be able  to link this  to onaradio.com.  Why would we?  I'm not sure  if they also have  them up there,  but the old ones  with Bugs Bunny  and the Jewish-American  Prince Air Force.  Oh my God, 
[01:32:00]  those are just amazing.  If you want to talk  about stereotypical.  Oh,  they took Japanese,  they took the Japanese  and Germans too,  like the Nazis.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Took them to task  during the 40s.  Yeah,  part of these  band cartoons,  they show the swastika  and everything  and they're Bugs Bunny cartoons.  Yeah.  Which swastika is  and just showing.  They show Japanese  guys with the  big thick round glasses  and huge teeth  and really. 
[01:32:30]  Derogatory,  and derogatory comments  that Bugs Bunny makes  to these Japanese people  are,  oh my,  you look at this  and you're like,  oh my God,  my friend Paul,  about,  maybe about seven  or eight years ago,  they were actually  selling these  at Chiller Theater.  Oh sure.  Oh hell yeah.  These are,  these are a collector's  item, man.  I mean,  these things have been  banned like,  like we just read  for 40 years.  And because of  the new technology  with YouTube  and all these  video sharing sites,  you know,  they're seeing  the light of day again. 
[01:33:00]  I mean,  I mean,  there are,  it was really hard  to get your hands  on these things  before the internet.  That's for sure.  I gotta tell you guys this.  I don't know  if anybody knows this.  Many years ago  it was in South Carolina  outside a place  called South Cherry Grove.  There is a breakfast  restaurant that is  so racial  and it's still down there.  I hate to say it,  but the place is called  Tar Blankies,  if you know what I mean.  Babies,  you can say that, sir.  Tar Babies,  okay,  and it's still alive  down there.  And the thing is,  if you pull up  to the front, 
[01:33:30]  the sign out front  has your stereotypical  black gingerbread character  with a torn jean shirt  with a straw hat  licking its lips  with a stack of pancake  in one hand  and a butter knife  in the other.  Can I get away with that?  I don't know.  And if you go inside,  I hate to interrupt you,  but right above the buffet  and it says,  and I'm going to say  this verbatim,  the Tar Baby says  you take what you want  but you eat what you take.  Wow.  Right above the buffet.  Where is this place?  What's scary is,  you know it by heart. 
[01:34:00]  How many times a week  do you eat at this joint?  I've only been there  once and over 10 years ago.  Where is it?  It just left that much  of a memory.  It's in South Cherry Grove,  South Carolina,  about 10 minutes  outside Myrtle Beach.  Hey, can you go to  Cold Black,  which you can find  on YouTube?  This Steve  and his dumb website,  he watermarked  a racist cartoon.  Yeah, he did.  How desperate are you  for exposure, Steve?  I want my logo on this.  Are you crazy?  This is a Warner Brothers  cartoon that has been 
[01:34:30]  banned for 40 years  and look, look, look, look.  Brought to you by Foundry.  It says,  this was not brought to you  by Foundry Music.  Are you crazy?  Why are you watermarking  a Warner Brothers  racist cartoon?  Probably for the same reason  I watermarked everything else  because I didn't think  anybody was going to  pay attention to it.  And look,  four years later.  And that's how  you executive produce.  Yes.  Exactly. 
[01:35:00]  Let's say hi to Jared  in Boston.  Are we getting the audio  from Cold Black?  They're working on it?  I'm kind of stalling here.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, Anthony,  I thought your ex's closet  was a gun closet,  not a movie vault.  Blee, blee, blee.  Blee, blee.  Justin.  Blee, blee.  Justin in North Carolina.  What do you got, Danny?  Well, it's coming.  I just wanted to let you know.  It's like an eight-minute cartoon.  Eight minutes?  The copy I saw  was like a minute and a half.  No, the one on YouTube,  that's not the original.  That's been heavily edited.  The one,  it's almost like a remix.  That's not the original cartoon.  I'm getting it now.  But is the remix worth playing?  No, it's retarded. 
[01:35:30]  We need the good one.  All right, let's go.  Sucks.  Justin, what do you got?  Yeah, when I was in college,  I did a research paper  on racism and censorship  in cartoons.  What they're not telling you  is when those movies  originally came out,  they were held  as some of the greatest animation  at that point  because everything  actually synced up,  like the sound  and the movement  and everything.  All right, good.  That helps.  I know.  I love when they just stop  and you're like,  is that it?  Is that all you had?  So them being quality animation 
[01:36:00]  doesn't exactly override  how awful they are.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, they might be really racist,  but man,  the animation was just  ahead of its time.  Sure knew how to animate.  Let's go to Detroit.  This can't be good.  Steve, what's up?  Oh, it's got to be good.  Okay, good.  Steve, what do you got?  I came across  a cartoon for Anthony  a while back.  It's called  Hitler's Children  and it's almost  like a documentary  to Disney cartoon  and how the Hitler youth  were raised  from their babies,  how the Nazis come, 
[01:36:30]  they take the babies  and put them  in the youth camps  and all that stuff.  And it's kind of odd  because you guys  talk about Disney  and his dislike  for the Jews  and all that,  but you could tell  it's like a Disney animation  because of the fat,  cheruby kind of little guys  and Nazi outfits.  You almost expect  something like  from Alice in Wonderland  or something,  but look it up.  It's on LimeWire.com.  Yeah, look at it.  Well, actually,  go backwards there,  Iraq.  Education for death.  You know what amazes me  about this?  Walt Disney presents.  I'm reading this 
[01:37:00]  as it goes.  Continue.  The story of one  of Hitler's children  as adapted from,  and yeah,  that's over a swastika.  Education for death.  Nice.  Education,  the making of the Nazi  for death.  Unbelievable.  Booby Man from Brooklyn  writes,  look up the Bugs Bunny video  when Bugs is being  hunted by a black man.  The black man has  big lips and big feet,  and how does Bugs beat him?  He plays dice against him  and takes all his clothing 
[01:37:30]  and gun.  Look at,  they got a cartoon  version of Hitler  in a Warner Brothers cartoon.  I mean,  Disney,  sorry.  I don't want to,  yeah,  Disney,  sorry.  Unbelievable.  Still stalling.  Are they mocking Hitler?  Huh?  I got to appraise him.  Well,  if it was Walt Disney,  he's probably a hero.  Yeah.  He's Prince Charming.  Hey,  remember that waffle thing?  This is called filler.  I told you about that waffle  before the break.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Here's the answer  to all the pertinent questions.  Wait,  the question,  what was the question now?  Celebrity ate a waffle,  ate half of it.  Yep.  Somebody grabbed that waffle  and said,  oh my God,  I can make money off this.  Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise?  No.  No.  I think I know the answer.  All right.  I think,  because it's being sold on,  the celebrity was  Gerard Depardieu  and it is  250,000  on eBay.  Did you read this story?  Gerard Depardieu. 
[01:38:30]  I'm trying to think  of relevant celebrities.  A celebrity that is  in the news  every single day.  That should give it away.  Mimi Driver.  A guess?  Every day.  You see the celebrity  every day?  Every day.  We see him every day.  Every day.  Without a doubt.  Steve Carlesi.  Jamie Farr.  1,400 bucks.  This isn't about  a candidate waffling, 
[01:39:00]  it's about a candidate's waffle.  Wafflegate began  when Senator Obama  visited the glider diner  in Scranton, Pennsylvania  and decided to order  a waffle.  It's delicious.  When the Senator  got up to leave,  his leftovers  got left behind.  Well, I guess  one of my employees  must have taken it  and had an idea  that they were going  to do something with it.  That something was this.  Up for bid,  the campaign breakfast  partially eaten by,  as the eBay listing put it,  Barack Hussein Obama. 
[01:39:30]  People are insane.  Like, all right,  let's play this out.  So you decide  you need, like,  Obama's waffle  and you get some money  to spend  and you get this thing  and it gets mailed  to your house  and then what?  Now what do you do  with it?  Now what do you do  with this dumb thing?  Show people your soggy bag?  Put it in a little showcase.  And how much do you think  this thing went for?  Three dollars.  Exactly.  No.  You're not going to believe it.  The plate was wrapped  by a waitress  and given to a loyal customer. 
[01:40:00]  On eBay,  the bidding war was on  $76,  $177.50,  $10,100.  All this for a homemade waffle  that lists on the menu  for $275?  Oh, wait, $275 for a waffle?  No wonder he only ate half.  She has a really nice voice.  That's at Gina Most or whatever.  Yeah.  Over $10,000  for Obama's half-eaten waffle.  Well, that's insanity. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  That is crazy.  The eBay listing noted  all proceeds go to Hillary  for president.  Ha ha.  The diner's owner  wanted the waffle  removed from eBay.  I don't think it's right.  I don't think it's right  without permission.  Next thing you know,  the waffle had disappeared  from eBay.  And this wasn't just  any half-eaten Obama waffle.  This waffle was actually  used by the candidate  to deflect a pesky reporter  asking her question  about Jimmy Carter  meeting with Hamas.  Now that really is waffling. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I hate her.  Oh, my God.  She's the worst.  I wish it was a pancake  and then as she was saying  the story,  she was run over by a truck  and flattened like one.  Like a pancake.  She's just terrific  with those human interest stories.  Just wonderful.  Why would the diner care  if you want to buy  Barack's waffle?  Who knows who it is?  Yeah, why take it off?  Who cares?  Yeah.  I would sell 10 of them  like that.  Just eat 10,  have 10 delicious breakfasts  and sell them  to whoever wants them.  Like $100,000. 
[01:41:30]  Getting back to the band cartoons,  E-Rock is just finding  a million of them, man.  Aldous and Rabbit Stew.  How are you finding  all these so fast on YouTube?  This one Sam found  while we were looking  at that.  Of course he found it.  Look at this.  Aldous and Rabbit Stew.  more stereotypical black stuff.  If you just put in  the N-word and the cartoon.  Try that.  Try it.  See what comes up.  All right, after the break  hopefully we'll have audio  of Black Hole.  That's the cartoon 
[01:42:00]  they're mostly talking about  in this New York Times article.  Told you.  Huh?  A bunch.  Wow, all you have to do is  put in the N-word  and then cartoon.  Yeah, but you have to spell  it like the gangsters, right?  No, I think either way.  Either way?  And that will come up?  I never spell it like  the gangsters in Google  or Yahoo.  That's right.  I pop that word in  a few times.  I'll see what comes up.  Usually it's some  white Aryan page.  You could click on that 
[01:42:30]  and chuckle.  Are you just trying  to get the latest news?  Get some chuckles.  Getting the latest news, man.  I'll tell you,  just as funny as going  to the militant black sites  or you're going  to the militant white sites.  They're hysterical.  They have little  cartoon drawings  that some of their members  make, I guess,  about Jews and blacks  and homosexuals.  Well, Laugh Riot. 
[01:43:00]  All right, hopefully  we'll have the black hole  audio after the break.  Let's go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling  the Opie and Anthony  FU line.  Here's the latest batch  of FUs.

That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  Danny's in studio. 
[01:45:00]  He just cut up  Cole Black.  If you weren't listening  a little while ago,  we made some kind of  New York Times article  either today or yesterday  talking about these  banned cartoons.  There's 11 of them.  11 Warner Brothers cartoons  that they banned  in the year 1968.  So for the last 40 years  they've been banned.  But they've been making  their way up on  video sharing sites  like YouTube  and other places  in the last few years.  and now Warner Brothers  are trying to get 
[01:45:30]  the cartoons off YouTube  by saying copyright infringement  and all that.  They just want these  cartoons gone.  Never to see the light  of day again.  It's, you know,  part of history,  I guess.  And they dragged us  into the article  because Steve's website  has featured these cartoons  in the past.  I don't know if they're still  up there.  I have no idea.  So they dragged our names  into this little article  that's in the Times.  They're saying we run  the website.  Yeah, whatever.  Sure we do.  Danny took a look  at Cole Black, 
[01:46:00]  one of the ones  they have a problem with.  And he said the racism  is very, very visual.  In what way, Danny?  Well, I mean,  for instance,  they'll be like,  they'll show you  the Prince Charming  in the Snow White cartoon.  And there'll be a graphic  that pops up  like a sign  and it says  Prince Charming.  You know,  it's like spelled  C-H-A-W.  You know,  and he comes on screen.  He's got like gold teeth  and like his two front teeth  are dice.  You know,  it just doesn't translate well  in the audio wise  because it's not like  an over-the-top  stereotypical,  you know,  like quote-unquote  black person impression. 
[01:46:30]  Can we hear how long  it takes to pick up  something auditory  or like how long  into the audio  you can actually...  Well, because it's a cartoon  they go a long way  with just visual humor  and visual racism.  The scene,  it jumps around like crazy  so I just pulled  two of the most.  We got a couple examples here.  Okay.  So this is in the actual  cartoon,  Cole Black.  Oh, honey child,  what story would you like  to have Mammy  tell you tonight?  I would like to hear  about the old 
[01:47:00]  white Andy Stanton  dwarf Mammy.  Well, once there was  a mean old queen  and she lived  in a gorgeous castle  and was that old gal rich?  She was just as rich  as she...  Rich as what?  What happened?  Probably as she could be,  I'm guessing.  I don't know.  I think that's been a problem  with the disc.  Yeah, it's basically  it's a little girl.  She's on the lap  of her grandmother  or mother  and that was the only  that she wants to hear  a story in 
[01:47:30]  so she's going to  tell a story about  Mammy's telling her one.  Cole Black.  Yeah.  D7 dwarves.  Mammy.  Get Sam on this.  He's got to go through  all the band cartoons  and get some audio  for tomorrow's show, okay?  Yeah.  Because there's a million  of them out there.  And he'd know  half his culture.  My hair's Cole Black  but my name's so white.  I wash it all day  and I got the blues  in the night.  Some folks think 
[01:48:00]  I'm kind of dumb  but I know someday  my friends will come.  So what you're right for  I  has  come.  See, it's not so over the top  I has.  It's like a musical.  Yeah, I mean  I think it's more visual  than  Yeah, it's just  chock full of sound effects  and you know  goofy sounds  from the old timey cartoons.  I mean, look at the lips.  I mean, my God.  Yeah, they really went wild. 
[01:48:30]  What's wrong with Warner Brothers  back in the day?  They made the lips too big.  You think?  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Calling from Atlanta.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  How's it going?  Good, man.  I worked for Ted Turner  for 15 years  and  in the early 90s  we had a  young lady  a black woman  who  started doing new  she hired about  oh, 20 or 30  of her closest friends  and all of a sudden  whenever we showed  a cartoon  that had  oh, like Tom and Jerry 
[01:49:00]  the mammy  who  couldn't even show her legs  and let her speak  anything  that was slightly  off color  all of a sudden  had to go to the editing department  who would that  they would do  20, 30 a week  my favorite  is an R-gang episode  where  it's  I was exposed  to the measles  and  at the end  the doctor  goes in  and tweets home  says  sees Buckwheat  laying in a bathtub  covered in ice  and he says 
[01:49:30]  what in the world  have you done here  and she looks at him  and says  well, you told me  to isolate him  and that  had to be cut out  of the  oh, yeah  that isn't racist  that's like  it's amazing  what they've done  to the old cartoons  I mean  you don't even  recognize  the cartoons anymore  when you  see them on TV  the big one  I mean  we've talked about  this too  hell with the racism  I mean  they cut out 
[01:50:00]  all violence  in cartoons  yeah  all the good stuff  just chop them  to a point  they're not even  worth watching anymore  you might as well  just throw them  on the shelf  and be done  with it already  there was another one  where  a man was on  safari  and his bears  just didn't  look quite right  so they  they all cut out  you know  they had bones  through their noses  and whatnot  and that was  a little racist  I suppose  but  I mean  go ahead  I'm sorry  but does Ted Turner  have to be such  a spineless worm 
[01:50:30]  God almighty  Ted  if you want  to change  something racist  how about  you fix  the braves  everybody's doing  that tomahawk  chop  they're named  after a conquered  people  how about that  if you're going  to change  something racist  don't  little band-aids  with the cartoons  go right after  your big money makers  there you go  thank you Jeff  yeah I don't blame  them for not liking that  someone didn't  understand what I was  saying  it's coal  they thought  I was saying  cold black  the whole time  I said coal  C-O-A-L 
[01:51:00]  black  coal  black  if you go  on to  YouTube  what do you mean  they banned  Speedy Gonzalez  there Iraq  how do you know  that  Cartoon Network  which is under  Turner Broadcasting  in the 90s  started banning  Speedy Gonzalez  cartoons for  stereotypes  with his cousin  Slowpoke Gonzalez  yeah  okay  okay Speedy  he could never  keep up  he was always  taking a  siesta  Mexicans  but that's not  even a good  stereotype  they work their  asses off  when they come  to America  well 
[01:51:30]  not in the  cartoons  enough already  nation of fruits  huh  just a nation  of fruits  goody two-shoe  hall monitors  the little rascals  had a funny one  with stymie  he was cooking  something  and it was  real hot  in the kitchen  and he wiped  the sweat  off his forehead  and like  threw his hand  a little  to kind of  knock the sweat  off like you  would  and it hit  the side  of the white  stove  and it was  brown  like his  sweat was  brown  unbelievable 
[01:52:00]  I don't see  that no more  like someone  would choose  to be that  color  is that what  they were getting  at with that  I have no idea  I was like  well they just  sweat that color  hey uh  bondage  if you're into  that bondage  out there  you gotta be  a little careful  we gotta  a fine story  in the news  here  bondage  gone horribly  wrong  on the surface  Rebecca and  James Bargy  seemed like  any other  happy couple  married for  seven years  relatives say  the pair  loved each  other very  much  but they had  no idea 
[01:52:30]  what was going  on behind  closed doors  that was his  request  he wanted her  to tie him  up and then  leave  Mona Phillips  says a few  days ago  her son-in-law  dressed himself  in ladies  lingerie  and asked  Rebecca  to tie him  up  deputies say  Rebecca admitted  she bound her  husband's hands  and feet  behind his  back late  Friday night  placed what's  called a gag  ball in his  mouth and  taped it shut  then left him  alone in their  bedroom  when she returned  home hours later  he was dead  what is the 
[01:53:00]  being left  alone  that's so  bizarre  yeah that  the guy here  in New York  that same  thing he was  left alone  and he was  on his  tippy toes  or something  and he  fell out of  his high  heels  he was in  like what  women's  lingerie  or something  and he  ended up  like yeah  getting  he survived  though right  but he was  unconscious  but he too  wanted to be  left alone  in that  situation  why  I'm a  pervert  and I don't  get that  maybe someone  could explain  that  you just  use a  fake name  change your 
[01:53:30]  voice  I don't  care  yeah  explain why  you want  to be in  that situation  alone  for hours  and there  was a bust  recently to  Rebecca's  hidden chamber  here in  New York  which is a  you know  a dungeon  for dominatrix  six of them  were busted  there were dungeons  if someone in the  office can find  that story  I think it was  in yesterday's  or Saturday's  paper  it's a pretty  funny story  the residents  of the building  got really  just pissed  off and finally  called the  authorities  they had it  with packages  arriving at  their building  boxes of 
[01:54:00]  adult diapers  and all sorts  of crazy stuff  that this joint  was using  well that's not  what got them  in trouble  no I know  but that was  that tipped people  off  some of the girls  were offering  sexual favors  I don't know  how much  they quoted  like 200  and something  dollars  they didn't  quote a lot  of money  so I don't  know exactly  what they were  doing  I've never  been there  unfortunately  yeah we gotta  find a story  but  I went to the  stupid den of  iniquity a couple  of times  they didn't do  anything  what's the  another dungeon  and what were you  looking for there  what I got  humiliation  in what way 
[01:54:30]  or you don't  want to really  say  let's just say  picture the worst  thing you can  have on you  oh my god  and they decided  to do that  they didn't  decide  we made  prearranged  financial  restitution  for them  if they would  but it seemed  like you weren't  happy with the  experience  why  because then  you get up  off a cold  dungeon floor  your chest  smells  I have friends  I have a family  I have a career  I got a mommy  that loves me  why am I doing  this 
[01:55:00]  am I even  turned on  I'm not turned  on by that  dumb talk  hello slave  shut up  yeah you're  gonna listen  to me  am I  when does it  go from  you're thinking  it's a turn  on to  complete  what am I  doing  in a split  second  yeah let's  just say  as soon as  there's half  and half  to be cleaned  up  here's the  second half  of the  bondage  story  the murray  county  sheriff's  department  says  james  bargy  apparently  suffocated  and many  factors  including  the sexual  bondage  led to  his death  rebecca 
[01:55:30]  is charged  with reckless  homicide  it's just  a strange  case  that  there was  you know  real odd  to us  and actually  I don't think  anybody here  ever saw  one quite  this strange  rebecca told  her family  james always  managed to  untie himself  and would even  be watching tv  when she  returned home  they say this  was his  sexual fantasy  not hers  but now  she's paying  the price  we got  secret name  from philly  the being 
[01:56:00]  left alone  thing is all  about the  fear  the sub  wants to  feel the  fear of  being alone  in a  vulnerable  position  and perhaps  being caught  that's what  that whole  thing is about  according to  this guy  secret name  someone's going to  walk in and  see you in  this ridiculous  situation  let's say  hi to kevin  in philly  kevin what's  going on  hey buddy  how you doing  good man  hey i think  the whole thing  with being  caught up and  left alone  is the  anticipation  for the  person coming  back and  whatever's  going to  happen when  they come  back  that's coming 
[01:56:30]  in a lot  is it a  sexual turn  on though  i think so  yeah i mean  not with me  obviously but  all those wacky  things have a  sexual base  some people  will say that  but some  people will  say they  don't  no they  all have  sexual  they all  is the  sexual part  of it  later  later down  the road  when you're  out of that  situation  think about  what you  just went  through  i don't  know if  the sexual  has to be  necessarily  an orgasm  i mean like  in serial  killings a lot  of times  they say  they're very  sexual although  there's no  sexual assault  you know there's  a sexual base 
[01:57:00]  for a lot  of them  yeah  all right  kevin thank  you i don't  get it to be  honest with you  no i've never  gotten that  whole dominatrix  and whenever  we've had him  on the show  it's like shut  up i met a  few and i'm  gonna beat you  now you've  been a bad  you've been  bad haven't  you i have  my writing  crop and i'm  gonna get  away from  me don't  even come  near me  mostly because  it's just  bad acting  yeah really  bad my  thing is it's  just gotta be  believable  like when the 
[01:57:30]  strip in the  strip clubs when  they act like  they care about  you when they're  doing a lap  dance i'm just  like i'll look  at you  girlfriend experience  is that what  you want  huh no i  mean it i i  would be more  into like the  lap dance if i  knew the girl  was like actually  into into the  uh into like  giving me a  lap dance yeah  i i could see  right through it  that's all just  about the exchange  of money it's  just i know  that i don't  mind but the  whole tom no  i don't mind  going there and  checking it out  but the actual  one-on-one  experience i'm 
[01:58:00]  like come on  i know what  this is about  you just want  uh you know  twenty forty  dollars whatever  it is go on  to the next  sucker please  a good dom  i'll watch his  dance from afar  a good dom is  amazing they're  rare though most  of them are  terrible but a  good one who is  really organic and  a pervert for  real who knows how  to talk to you  because it's who  she is man  there's nothing  sexier than that  yeah i've had a  few that were  just amazing but  most of them are  awful this and i  got i got a riding

[01:59:00]  and one of them was  being hung from the  ceiling standing on  a chair and the  other guy was in  front of him doing  whatever and he  wound up i guess  things got out of  control and we get  there and we get to  like this it's like  in a basement and  there's like these  bottles of like  lubrication all over  the place and the  guy is like in  cardiac arrest on the  floor and we're  trying to do like a  cpr on him but he's  got so much oil all

[02:01:00]  hot uh but again it  wasn't anything because  she was a beautiful like  she's the type of girl  you'd want to hit on in a  club or you'd want to she  was gorgeous yeah that  helped like this is a  woman i would see in a  club and want to i mean  she smelled good and  she was clean and she  was just she was just  exuded sexuality and  when a woman like that  is a is a filthy  pervert you really hit a  home run all right just  a pig but just but  wouldn't let you do  anything to her you know  because she was a dom  she wouldn't let you  touch her or do any

[02:15:30]  we can't  i'm not embarrassed  i'd say tit fuck  but uh  they'd probably dump out  they would probably  dump out of me saying that  all right megan  obviously we're  trying to figure out what to do with you  we're just kind of exploring your  your submissive behavior  you're gonna have to call the show again okay  all right i will  i think we can do something with you  you keep in touch  okay  all right there goes megan from jersey  sharing with us today  uh  is that it 
[02:16:00]  you got something there jimmy  yeah i just wanted to plug this friday  i'll be in pittsburgh  my last road date for a while  may 2nd  8 o'clock  buy them theater  go to box office  uh  with ticketmaster for tickets  very good  we're off to xm  you guys have a great day  bye  the opium anthony show  xm 202  in the world of radio shock jocks  the biggest are opium anthony 
[02:16:30]  these people say  shocking things  that border on offensive  uh in order to entertain  their office  i refuse to sit here  and think that radio  has to be nice  why  why does radio  out of any other medium  have to be nice  we are being now held  to a standard  where we have to be nice  and make people  shock jocks  go  screw  radio bad boys  opium anthony  controversial radio personalities  opium anthony  infamous dj's opium anthony  shock show radio host 
[02:17:00]  opium anthony  opium anthony  opium anthony  I want to be called the A-Man.  Like you're the I-Man?  I want to be the A-Man.  How about I call you the A-H-Man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to give up my name, Jim Norton.  I'm going to find a dead baby, take his name.  I don't know where I'll find the social security of him.  Passed by houses where you see brand new cribs at the curb. 
[02:17:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Those stupid Australians whose national hero got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's a hell of a show intro right there.  Here we are, XF Satellite Radio.  A miserable day in New York. 
[02:18:00]  What happened to spring?  Or actually, what happened to summer?  We had summer for a couple days.  Now it's back to late winter.  I don't know what to do with my stupid coats.  You know I wear my big heavy homeless guy coat.  You wear the homeless guy coat when it's 75 and sunny.  I went winter coat today and you're in spring coat.  Yeah, because I thought it was going to be nicer today than it is.  No.  And I'm trying to retire my heavy coat for the rest of the year.  You got that fancy iPhone.  As soon as I wake up.  I do. 
[02:18:30]  I go like this.  I go weather.  As soon as that alarm goes off, I go weather.  And then I'm like, oh, all right.  I got to wear something a little heavier today.  Here's what my weather says.  59 degrees.  Oh, 61 degrees, actually.  61?  61.  So I'm like, all right.  I'll wear something light.  But then I forget the walkover is a lot earlier than 61 degrees.  Yeah, no.  It's in the high 40s.  And with the rain.  Well, we got a few people that decided to do the show today. 
[02:19:00]  What's up?  That's nice.  Two or three people.  Three people on the bleachers today.  Disappointed that they're the only ones here.  No big camaraderie.  Friday.  No big crowd.  Honestly, Friday is becoming the day for like a live studio audience.  The big audience.  We bring the bleachers into the studio here.  We're always kind of reinventing ourselves.  A lot of people love the walkover.  We hated the walkover.  After a while, it was the same block.  And there was just nothing we could really do with the damn thing. 
[02:19:30]  Maybe we should bring it back a little bit in the spring here and there.  Not on a regular basis, that's for sure.  But I think the new thing is the live studio audience on Fridays.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  It motivates you.  It makes you want to be funny.  Yeah, and it gets you through the Friday, because after doing a week of radio, you're dragging  a little bit, but they give you a pump of energy, and it's turning out that it's the best show  of the week.  Dragon Ace.  Last Friday, we got the bleachers in here.  We got a rule.  20 people show up, we move the bleachers inside. 
[02:20:00]  Yep.  For now, because I know what's going to end up happening.  We're going to have 20 people every day.  It's going to be annoying.  Screw moving the bleachers.  And then we're going to have to push you animals outside again.  Screw it.  In front of the big glass wall.  All right.  Man who took lampshade lie detector seeks settlement.  This is the story of the day, and we just ran out of time on the other side of the show.  This is just an amazing, amazing story.  Jackson, Mississippi.  There's a lot of laughs in this story, people.  By the way, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright is speaking right now live, so maybe we can record it. 
[02:20:30]  Our congregation, as you heard in the introduction, took a stand against apartheid when the government  of our country was supporting the racist regime of the Afrikaner government in South Africa.  Our congregation stood in solidarity with the peasants in El Salvador and Nicaragua.  So this guy doesn't support Obama, obviously, because he's just fucking up his campaign, 
[02:21:00]  like Anthony was saying earlier.  How much do you need publicity that you would come out now and really go forward?  Now they got him on CNN Live.  What's he saying, though?  Yeah, let's hear some of his bullshit.  This guy was just a nobody.  With an additional 40 currently being enrolled in seminary while building two senior citizen  housing complexes and running two child care programs for the poor, the unemployed, the  low-income parents on the south side of Chicago for the past 30 years.  Baddest part of town.  If you go down there, you better just do our man named Leroy Brown. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  But I hear.  ...needy families every year while our government cuts food stamps and spends billions fighting  in an unjust war in Iraq.  Well, the cutting food stamps saying, yeah, get a fucking job, it's called.  Our congregation has sent dozens of boys and girls to fight in the Vietnam War, the first  Gulf War, and the present two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  My goddaughter's unit just arrived in Iraq this week, while those who call me unpatriotic have 
[02:22:00]  used their positions of privilege to avoid military service while sending...  Well, no one's denied that.  It's cheap applause.  It's true.  He's ex-military, too.  I like this guy.  He is?  What was he?  Marine.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He was a Marine.  ...while sending over 4,000 American boys and girls of every race to die over a lie. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, man, is he liling them up.  Our congregation...  Our congregation has had an HIV-AIDS ministry for over two decades.  Our congregation has awarded over $1 million to graduating high school seniors going into  college, and an additional $1 million to the United Nuclear College Fund.  The guy got a million bucks.  And the six HBCUs related to the United Church of Christ, while advocating for health care 
[02:23:00]  for the uninsured, workers' rights for those forbidden to form unions, and fighting the  unjust sentencing system, which has sent black men and women to prison for longer terms for  possession of crack cocaine than white men and women have to serve for the possession  of powder cocaine.  How many of you don't have crack cocaine on you?  Our congregation has had a prison ministry for 30 years.  A prison ministry.  A drug and alcohol recovery ministry for 20 years.  A full-service program for senior citizens and 22 different ministries for the youth of 
[02:23:30]  our church.  Talk about how you said 9-11.  ...to high school, all proceeding from the starting point of liberation and transformation.  See, no one's arguing what he's saying here.  It's wonderful stuff that your congregation's talking about.  ...for changed minds, changed laws, changed social orders, changed lives, changed lives...  ...in a changed world.  ...this guy's trouble.  ...in a changed world.  I like him, man.  Shut up.  I really do.  No, you don't.  I absolutely do.  You want the mic to roll?  ...the black church is a theology of liberation, it is a theology of transformation, and it is 
[02:24:00]  ultimately a theology of reconciliation.  What?  ...the apostle Paul said...  You're a separatist.  Shut up.  You're a fucking separatist.  ...for you.  I'm a separatist.  So are you.  I know one when I see one.  You guys should get along.  You guys are both separate.  ...or...  ...let's just hang out with our own kind, everybody.  Right?  What do you say?  But why do you get so riled up?  You get, like, really...  Because I'm not allowed to.  He's defending his position.  I don't think...  I think he's actually defending his position fairly well by putting a focus on the... 
[02:24:30]  He knows he said fucked up things.  They can't come back.  So he's focusing on the stuff that's good that they've done.  On the good stuff.  I don't think that hurts Obama.  ...the third principle in the prophetic theology of the black church.  How about why should we have...  Why should we have a prison ministry?  ...of a black church experience in North America.  I like him now.  I didn't like him.  I'm taking care of the problems.  Why there's a disproportionate number of blacks in prison.  Instead of making something to make it a little easier while they're in there.  Yeah, we'll have to go through some of that. 
[02:25:00]  ...the next to white worshippers, they...  All right, we'll go back to him.  I like Jeremiah Wright.  He's going to be talking for a while.  Oh, I don't...  I don't know how you like him.  You are the weirdest guys to me sometimes, Jimmy.  I know, because it's like...  Even though I don't like what he said about 9-11 at all, I don't like what he said, you  know, God damn...  But again, I think that's his right to say it.  It doesn't bother me that much.  And the bottom line is the congregation probably has done a tremendous amount of good things.  And when he makes the... 
[02:25:30]  A, the guy did do military service.  He's not a coward.  He did his service.  And his goddaughter's going over, and he's right.  These people who are accusing him of being un-American do use their positions of power  to avoid service and to avoid it for their families.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  Some of the privileged, yes.  Yeah.  I mean, so who the fuck are they to criticize?  Like the president of the United States of America.  Yeah, and the last one before him.  Yeah.  So who the fuck are they to say the guy's un-American, even though he did say a few things  which were kind of shitty, but tough shit. 
[02:26:00]  I like him now.  He did.  And just because he served doesn't mean he can't be un-American.  I've known some assholes who have served.  That's true.  Anthony, do you like any black guys in power?  Does Patrice O'Neal hold office anywhere?  Because I really love Patrice.  Is there one you like, though?  In a place of power?  Yeah, just a black man that has some power.  I used to like Colin Powell before he turned asshole and Bush crony and went into the UN  with a bunch of bullshit. 
[02:26:30]  Have you ever seen Colin Powell live?  No.  Oh, my God.  What?  Big guy?  Big cock?  No, they brought him out before an Islander game.  I think I told his story.  Brought him out?  You sound like Kong.  What the fuck?  They brought him out.  They had some big thing going on at the Nassau Coliseum.  I wasn't really paying attention because I was still getting our food order in and stuff.  But they brought him out to drop the puck.  They do it at every game now when the Islanders are playing and not playing golf.  And I didn't think he was on the ice because all I saw were white guys on the ice. 
[02:27:00]  No joke.  Really?  Yeah.  And then I had to focus on all the white guys because they had about 10 people, you  know, coming out.  He's very fair-skinned.  Oh, my God.  Is he fair-skinned?  He's light-skinned.  And so what?  He's beyond light-skinned, though.  He's God over us and not Emmanuel, which means God with us.  If I see God as mean, vengeful, authoritarian, sexist, or misogynist, then I see humans through  that lens.  My theological lens shapes my anthropological lens. 
[02:27:30]  And as a result, white males are superior.  All others are inferior.  All right.  He said it.  I kind of like what he says now.  All right.  He just said that.  There you go.  You heard it from Robert Wright himself.  Boy, I sure hope he was quoting something else.  I don't like what he said about the government fucking putting AIDS for black.  That's black paranoia.  Sure.  I don't like that either.  Exactly.  In America or South Africa, I can construct a theology of apartheid in the African literature  Jimmy, he's got the same cadence.  Not the same, but his cadence is like George Carlin. 
[02:28:00]  You hear a little George Carlin in him?  How he's just kind of doing that, that, that, that.  All right.  Look.  This guy's a great...  The guy's going back to apartheid, though?  And talking about apartheid?  A right?  No, he's talking about how he's taking unpopular positions now, but it was an unpopular position  when they opposed South Africa before anybody else did.  He was saying we had a free South Africa sign in the 70s before it was popular.  Well, I'm sorry.  The majority wasn't really paying much fucking attention.  Sometimes it does take a little kick in the ass for people to realize it. 
[02:28:30]  Where is he now with the Congo and the Sudan and fucking...  Yeah, what's his position there?  Why not send black guys over there to help out?  Ah.  Fucking hypocrites.  It's only when Whitey ain't fucking helping enough.  Go screw.  Go screw Reverend Wright, that douchebag.  I hate Reverend Wright.  Anthony's unbendable.  It's unbelievable.  I really do like the good Reverend.  I would love to go to see the good Reverend Don to speak.  But there's something else going on with Anthony because he gets so irritated.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Something like this.  This guy isn't going to change your life.  It's irritating.  There's this double standard thing.  No, he is going to change.  But you really get very, very worked up.  Very worked up.  I get it with the Reverend Al thing, but...  And this guy's never just like a Farrakhan speech coming out of this guy's fucking mouth.  Come on.  Another guy I love.  I love Louis F.  Do you like Louis?  Yes.  With the fucking wheel in space and black people fucking were building things in Africa 
[02:29:30]  thousands of years before Whitey was.  Nonsense.  It's drivel.  The same as fucking the guy with the holes in his hands booted the rock out of the way  and skipped past the Romans.  Zombie guard.  Zombie guard.  Yeah.  It's all nonsense.  If I like Farrakhan, too.  I love these radicals.  We got a big star waiting outside the studio, so...  There you go.  A little taste of Reverend Wright live on CNN and I'm sure on POTUS.  A dumb XM station.  POTUS.  Ugh.  Has anyone checked it out? 
[02:30:00]  I have POTUS.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  You can't touch me.  I'm active.  Oh, I wish I could tell the story of POTUS.  Someday I will.  What an awful, awful concept.  Are you checking the mic?  Awful.  But I'm sure they're running it.  This is a big get for POTUS on XM.  Politics all day long.  What does it stand for?  Political.  Yeah, that's what I...  What?  President of the United States.  Oh, President of the United States?  POTUSA?  POTUSA. 
[02:30:30]  POTUS.  POTUS was a favor to someone before they left the company.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, Christ.  It was a little favor and it made a lot of people have to work many, many hours.  Another good decision.  Well, you know, the guy had...  A lot of people that didn't want to, like, you know, spend hundreds of hours on such nonsense, but they had to.  Job well done.  Hey, we got to get Eric Logan on the phone because satellite ratings came out.  And if you believe what you read, we're doing really, really bad. 
[02:31:00]  But according to, like, the people in the know, it's complete bullshit.  And I just want to get Eric Logan's take on it.  Sure.  Because according to Logan, the in-house research shows this channel is one of the biggest channels on all of XM.  I mean, we just destroy.  But Arbitron paints a different picture.  And we're not hiding behind anything.  But I really want him to explain what that's all about.  Because Arbitron, they put out a ratings thing, I think, Thursday or Friday. 
[02:31:30]  And the problem is they're not asking satellite subscribers what they're listening to.  Oh, it just goes out to people that have it or don't have it?  No.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  So the odds are it's going to mostly go to people who don't have it.  Yeah, not to make excuses, but basically Arbitron throws their survey out into a community.  And they're doing all of radio.  And mostly it's regular radio.  But this is, like, based on people actually writing down that they listen to, let's say, Howard.  Right.  Or listen to us or listen to the 60s channel on XM. 
[02:32:00]  He says it's complete bullshit.  And actually someone on Orbitcast did a little quick summary on the ratings and then said,  I'm going to explain why this is complete bullshit.  But he did a little fucking tease and is making everyone wait until sometime today or tomorrow  for his thoughts on why it's bullshit.  So Orbitcast, I'm very curious to see what that's all about.  All right.  What do you got, Jimmy?  We have to bring our guest in.  If I say her name wrong, she can smash me in the head when she comes in.  I'm very happy she should.  Well, she should anyway.  I'm going to lead you, Raven, from Lost, of course. 
[02:32:30]  She's Claire on Lost.  She's one of the stars of one of the biggest shows on television.  Oh, Emile's here?  Emile D.  Emile, what?  Emile D.  Raven.  Watch that be right.  Emile D.  Could you straighten him out on your name, please?  No, I got it.  First, take a seat.  Welcome.  No, it's Emile.  Look.  It says it right there.  Emile.  No, it's...  It's the French spelling.  I'm sorry.  Wow, you're beautiful.  My God.  Thank you.  I'm very...  You don't really...  Do you watch Lost?  She's one of the big stars on Lost. 
[02:33:00]  I'm very happy you're here.  I have not seen an episode of Lost.  I have not missed an episode.  So, he's in the minority because...  Oh, I know I'm in the minority.  And I'm stupid.  I know I should be watching Lost.  I just haven't...  I got a box set that I got for Christmas.  And one of my brothers grabbed it.  I can't get it back from him.  And then I start from the beginning.  I DVR it sometimes.  And then stupid Than, who watches it all the time, goes,  Hey, did you watch Lost last night?  I go, No, shut up!  And then he'll start going, Oh, probably best episode ever. 
[02:33:30]  Best episode ever.  And then I sit there and get very annoyed at them.  But I watched last Thursday's episode last night.  And I was a little worried about you.  Were you?  With your little legs sticking out from under the wreckage.  But I came through.  It's okay.  Yeah, actually, there was an exploded house you're in.  It was a big explosion.  You just needed a Band-Aid.  How big was the explosion you were in?  Oh, boy, Jimmy.  What's wrong?  It was a huge explosion? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, the whole house was.  The whole house is gone.  The whole house?  Jimmy, you hear that?  The whole house.  I've seen every episode.  Except that one.  I saw half of that one.  I downloaded it on iTunes while I was on the road.  And I got through half of it.  And then my flight had to leave.  She's fine.  Don't worry.  I would assume that they wouldn't have a dead person promoting.  That'd be kind of silly.  Well, for the flash-forwards, perhaps.  Because some dead people have been on the show.  Which is, you know something?  They could kill you off on this show.  And you're still on the show.  You're still on the show.  I know.  That's hysterical.  People die.  And they don't even care. 
[02:34:30]  It's like, oh, I'm dead.  They can do anything they want.  The artistic license they have is incredible.  But Michael was in season one.  And then all of a sudden he was gone.  And my theory is it was because the kid, Walt, probably grew too fast.  And the problem is when you have a 10 or 11-year-old, it takes two years to film.  All of a sudden he's 51.  You can't replace him easily.  Enough with Walt.  I hate the idea that everybody had to suffer because of stupid Walt.  Why?  Because.  Who cares? 
[02:35:00]  He's a kid.  Oh.  I liked Walt.  No, you didn't.  Uh-oh.  Am I supposed to like Walt?  Yeah, Walt's a good boy.  Is he a good boy?  How many babies have you been through?  Malcolm, he's such a nice kid.  How many?  Because you have a baby on the show.  How many different kids have they used before they get big?  Oh, I've lost count.  But they're all really sweet.  Do you get attached to them or are you just kind of overplayed out?  Yeah, sometimes.  I mean, sometimes you use, you know, if I'm in an episode for one day of work, that's sometimes  the only time you'll use that baby.  But sometimes if it's, you know, two episodes back to back that you're in a lot, you'll get  to know them. 
[02:35:30]  Really?  It's like only one baby per episode?  No, they'll last a couple of months if they're good.  A lot of them, you know, don't enjoy being held by other people.  What is their mommy like right next to you?  And stuff to try to keep them quiet.  Oh, yeah, with the little toys.  Okay, make mommy some money.  How far in advance do you know what's going on?  I know the writing is so all over the place.  I mean, it's brilliant.  How far, how much in advance do you know?  You know, we get scripts about a week to two weeks before we shoot. 
[02:36:00]  So that's all I know.  Oh, cool.  So what's going to happen?  And we're shooting right now.  Like, we've got about two, three weeks left.  Yeah.  And then we're done.  So there's like a two, three part finale.  Yeah, they cut out a couple episodes on because of the strike to catch up, I guess.  Yeah, we were meant to do 16.  We're very bummed out about that.  I'll be honest.  Yeah.  Well, the thing is, film some other stuff for the box set. 
[02:36:30]  Film some filler stuff for us.  Mobisodes.  Yeah, we need it.  If they're still shooting, like, they don't shoot the whole season and then just, like,  I thought it was like, it was like The Sopranos or The Wire or something where they shot the  entire season.  They actually just kind of shoot as they go.  What do you mean?  Like, you guys don't have the last three episodes of the season shot already.  No, not yet.  No.  Oh, I'm surprised.  I thought they shot the whole season.  What a dope eye.  I'm secretive.  Okay, I guess spoilers and stuff would leak out.  Wait, so you have to go back to Hawaii?  Yeah, I think I've only got one more day of work. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, that means she's done.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, that was a spoiler.  Oh, the internet's going to be a chatty.  It's going to be a buzz.  Are you surprised about, like...  Maybe more.  I don't know.  Ah, maybe more.  That's good.  Too late.  Too late.  No, I haven't read the last script.  Oh, okay.  You don't know.  Yeah.  But you heard it here one day.  That's right.  Are you surprised at the amount of internet speculating and sites?  And do you read any of that stuff?  Not really.  I kind of used to be...  I mean, we all used to speculate and ask these questions of what's going on and what's going 
[02:37:30]  to happen and where are we, why are we here?  And we all kind of gave up a while ago.  Because they'd never tell you the truth.  They'd be like, no, that's not it.  No.  Have you ever read somebody's speculation, though?  Because sometimes we'll go on websites, you know, fan sites, and read some speculation  as to what people think is going to happen.  And then you go like, wow, that makes perfect sense.  This guy figured it out.  And then the next episode you go, that guy was an ass who knew nothing. 
[02:38:00]  I haven't read any that I really thought that's it.  I mean, you know, the whole purgatory thing was a big thing for a long time.  Yeah.  I think everyone's trying to figure out the big picture.  So, like, there's this one big answer to the whole thing, and I just see it as a bunch  of little stuff going on that, you know, I'm kind of one of those enjoy the journey  instead of the destination kind of guy.  What interests me is the whole island being able to move.  Yeah.  That's just crazy.  Yeah, that's a little odd.  That's just, okay. 
[02:38:30]  What do you mean?  Yeah, I don't know what you mean.  Well, like, you know, no one could kind of find it again.  Yeah, it sort of oscillates around.  It's not just in one area.  Yeah.  It's like a big boat.  Yeah, it's like a giant boat or something.  And then it's got some power over people.  And the whole time travel thing is very confusing.  It's in a different time period sometimes.  And then it kept, like, what happened when, what's his name there, Michael wanted to, you  know, off himself.  And the island doesn't want him to.  Right.  So, it does what it has to do to prevent him from doing that. 
[02:39:00]  And they make bad guys good guys all the time.  Like, in season one, The Others, you couldn't picture what The Others were.  They must have been these monsters.  Horrible people.  And then you realize, no, they're just more victims.  Yeah.  And the doctor, Ethan, who, oh my God, this guy's awful.  He's a murderer.  Oh no, he was just trying to save babies.  Yeah.  Who don't like it anymore.  Sam pointed out, Ethan has more time post-mortem than he did live on the show.  Yeah.  He's killed off more time, more screen time.  It's like, how many times can you die? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Apparently a few.  What's the biggest shock you've had?  Like, I mean, I know you guys probably see certain things coming, but of all the things  that I've done on the show, what's one or two of the biggest ones that made you kind of  really, you couldn't believe they actually went in that direction?  Well, good or bad?  For me, one of the big things was Dom dying, because I personally worked with him so much.  Yeah, yeah.  And, well, not Dom dying, Charlie.  Yeah.  Dom's fine.  Dom's fine.  When she said Dom, I didn't want to be stupid and go, who's Dom?  I didn't want her to think I don't watch the show. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, Charlie, okay.  Just because, you know, you work with someone so much, and that's your work.  You go to work, and you go work with this person, and suddenly that's just, boof.  And then he's gone.  But then he pops up every so often.  Yeah, exactly.  Everybody's still kind of hanging around.  You were in The Hills Have Eyes.  Yes.  Which, it was kind of cool, because I didn't see that until after I saw A Lot of Lost.  I'm sitting there going, who is that girl?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:40:30]  Pretty nice there when you're sunning in the little lounge chair, I must say.  But you...  I didn't see any part you remember.  Well, no.  That movie was horrific.  Yeah, it really was.  But really graphically gruesome.  Cool movie.  But one of my favorites in that, what's his name?  From, um...  From, uh...  God damn it, why can't I remember now?  Would you?  Oh, uh, Ted Levine.  Yeah, Ted Levine.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  Would you?  He has a line in there that is so funny, and it's just one word. 
[02:41:00]  When, uh, the one guy asks, well, can you fix it?  When the truck wrecks, and he just turns around and goes, what?  Isn't that voices?  What?  What?  Oh, we have that clip?  Yeah, I made them get it for me.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Can she hear it?  I don't know.  Can you hear that?  What?  No.  I can hear it out there.  Yeah, she's got it.  Yeah, that guy is hysterical.  Like, everything he's in, I just...  Yeah, he's a great actor.  ...picture the tuck dance that he did. 
[02:41:30]  I had a really good cast on that movie.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very gruesome, though, man.  I mean...  Whoa.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I was going to say, like, it says here on the thing, you get married to, uh, it's off  the subject, to an actor for, and you were divorced less than six months later.  No, we never got divorced.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  Okay, well...  Incorrect information.  Well, here's, this, this is exactly...  We're happy and married.  You know something, then?  Kill somebody.  This is what it says.  Someone needs to die.  She got married to actor Josh Janowitz in June of 2007 and was divorced within six 
[02:42:00]  months.  What are you, giving a deposition?  She can't believe these things you read.  No, but who made up the prep sheet?  Sam.  Bring them all right now.  Bring Sam.  Bring Sam in here right now.  Sam dies.  Are you still happily married?  Yes.  Okay, good.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  If you wonder why we're languishing in mediocrity as a show, it's because we have guys that  are going to, uh, I don't know, a blog to get information.  I want to see where they, I want to see where Sam went for this.  You know, it doesn't matter where it is.  It's just, it's, there's so much stuff out there that's written.  But that sounds interesting.  Like, if you got married and divorced within six months, like, there's probably a story 
[02:42:30]  there.  But, like, we got married.  No, it's terrific.  We're still married.  There's really no story there.  It really is.  Nobody wants to hear about happily married people.  As we get, as we get Sam in here.  Oh, here he is.  I'm so sorry to be happy.  Sam, where did we get that info that she was, uh, married and divorced within six months?  Just say you made it up.  It was on, uh, online encyclopedia.  Wikipedia.  Wikipedia.  Yeah.  She's laughing at you.  Do you know anyone can sign on there and just put whatever they want in there? 
[02:43:00]  She's just laughing at you.  Wikipedia.  It was a rumor.  And it was a rumor?  It was a rumor.  It was under the rumor section.  Holy Jesus.  Jesus.  You are the worst.  No one checked it.  Look.  Wait, let me make sure now.  Were you in Roswell and Beastmaster before I make a bigger ass out of myself?  True.  Are you on Lost?  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  Now, Roswell, though, you came on, what, you came to, uh, become an actress, and then you 
[02:43:30]  landed that gig pretty quickly?  Yeah, I actually moved out because of Roswell.  I came out for an audition for that, and then pilot season in general.  That was the one that worked out.  So, to, like, to, were you doing anything in acting before that?  Yeah.  For a year, I did a show called Beastmaster, which was my first job at home in Queensland.  And, uh, from that, then I got a call to just audition for Roswell.  I think they thought I lived in L.A. or something.  Oh. 
[02:44:00]  So, I thought, oh, yeah, I'll come out for pilot season, and that was the one that worked  out.  Yeah.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty sweet.  We got to get into a movie, uh, but first, we got Jay Moore on the, uh, on the line.  Uh, can you put the headphones close to your ear so you can hear him?  Uh, Jay Moore, everyone.  What's up, Jay?  Uh, I have a question for Emily.  Okay.  Emily, are there something with a dress?  You had a dress?  You, uh, you had a, uh, you had a, uh, you had a dress, uh, you had a dress, uh, you had  a dress, something with a dress?  What?  Say what?  You had a mall.  I said there's some crazy story that somebody told me from WFAM that you were in a dress. 
[02:44:30]  I, I have been known to wear dresses, yes.  No, it's like you went to a mall and it was, like, crazy.  It was just crazy in a dress.  Um, Jay, we have to say, okay.  I'm kind of confused.  Thank you, Jay Moore.  I'll explain that.  That's Jay Moore, our friend, and he's making fun of me.  You know what?  Fine actor, Jay Moore.  Yep.  Jay just, Jay starred a new bit, though.  I think every, every celebrity that comes in, we got to do that exact rant.  And they're like, what?  I'm going to tell the truth, though.  You, you, you have some crazy story.  Uh, Eddie Trump told me it's a mini-w that you were in a dress. 
[02:45:00]  Eddie Trump.  Yes.  I can confirm that that story is true.  I knew it.  Tell me!  All right.  Jay Moore.  Jay's making fun of me because I interviewed a guitarist named Zach Wilde once and, uh,  just, I repeated the word dress many times.  It was probably amongst one of the worst interviews ever because he wouldn't shut up about this  dress question.  I was very nervous talking to this guy and it was just really, you know.  And it was him talking really fast going, was it a story about a dress, you in a dress  in the mall with a dress and a dress.  And I, I guess that's what Jay was parodying.  Yeah.  That makes so much more sense now. 
[02:45:30]  Now it makes more sense than just somebody blurting out the word dress to you.  I know.  Um, Emily's, uh, film, uh, Ball Don't Lie premiered Saturday, this past Saturday at  Tribeca.  What, what's the movie about?  It's, it's a very gritty story of, um, this boy Sticky and his growing up.  He's a basketball player.  He's amazing.  And it's, you know, it's everything from his growing up through foster homes to his present  day life and, you know, struggles and love life and all that kind of stuff. 
[02:46:00]  He's got an OCD too, I noticed.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  What kind of OCD does he have in the movie?  You know, just repeatedly doing things.  Washing hands and all that, right?  Yeah, that kind of stuff.  And then it goes away when he's on the court.  And what is your, uh, what is your character?  My character, uh, plays his mother, uh, back when he was a child.  Oh, okay.  We're looking at you like, what?  Like, what, are you playing mothers already?  How the hell is that happening?  Well, actually you are playing a mother.  I have kids or I'm pregnant or something.  It's really strange. 
[02:46:30]  But no, she's, her character's baby and she's a, she's a, she's got a lot going on.  She's a prostitute.  She's got bipolar disorder.  Just trying to kind of, you know, give her boy a good life and not bring him into her  crap too much.  But that kind of happens anyway.  You play a prostitute with bipolar?  I do.  Fantastic.  Jimmy's in love.  Wonderful.  Both qualities I look for when I meet someone.  Oh, dear.  As an actor, like, I guess you want to do something totally different than what you play on. 
[02:47:00]  I mean, everyone knows you're from Lost and it's Claire.  So you probably want to just do totally different projects, right?  Yeah.  Whenever.  Yeah.  It's, that's what I strive for is just to challenge myself to as much as I can with different  characters.  Is there any nudity in this?  No.  That's good.  I prefer it.  Sorry.  I prefer that.  Thank God.  You think prostitute may be a little nudity, right?  You never know.  You never know.  How'd you get around that?  It just, it just wasn't, you know, my stuff's with the kids.  So that would be a little weird.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Is it an R or a PG?  True.  Good point.  Do you curse in it?  Do I?  No.  I don't think I do, actually.  Because she plays such a nice person.  I love, you want to see sometimes people that you see on TV just being very pleasant,  just cursing a little bit in a movie.  The hell's have eyes?  You're a little, you know, bitchy.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Fun to watch.  Let's say hi to Josh in Dallas.  Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Emily, I have a question.  In the hills have eyes, there's a really intense scene where it looks like you're being raped 
[02:48:00]  by one of those mutant guys, and me and my friend have this ongoing debate on whether  or not you were actually raped.  What is your feelings on that?  Whether I was actually what?  Your word dropped out.  Oh, sorry.  The rape.  Yes.  Was I actually raped?  In the one scene in the hills have eyes, there's a, the mutant is attacking you.  Yeah, he rapes you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's brutal.  And you guys got a bet?  Wait, are you asking her if in real life she was naked? 
[02:48:30]  What do you say?  Your word dropped out.  No, I'm sorry.  No, there's this scene where it looks like he's raping her, but then they keep cutting  to him and cutting to her, and you can't really see if there's a...  Dude, it's obvious.  Jesus.  Well, I haven't ever been raped, Anthony.  I don't know.  You don't have, you don't have to be raped to know what it looks like.  This big, dumb-looking thing is on top of her, of course.  I've never seen the movie.  It's obvious that she's being raped? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  So what, you don't think it's obvious because how they filmed the scene, Josh?  I like penetration.  It's not porno.  It's a horror movie, you dummy.  Oh, enough for you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  God.  Josh has apologized for our stupid listeners sometimes.  Jeez, are they dummies?  I think she's kind of enjoying it.  I hope so.  It's amazing.  It is amusing.  It's funny.  It's not the same old interview, right?  No, not at all.  You're probably going to do a lot of these today.  Yeah, quite a few. 
[02:49:30]  You'll remember this one.  I'll tell you right now.  Oh, I will.  It's already there.  Yeah, it's rained.  How was CW11?  They're our friends.  How was that?  It was good.  It was fun.  Did they ask you really good questions?  Or was it just kind of like...  No, it was good.  It was very good.  They asked you about your marriage that failed miserably after six months?  No.  No, but they knew that I was happily married.  Of course.  Of course they did.  So you were on a show that lasted one season, lost.  Right.  We're morons.  All right.  So the movie's Ball Don't Lie.  Is it going to be in movie theaters? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know how these Tribeca films work.  Yeah, I guess you sort of wait and see.  You know, there's a lot of bios at the festival, so...  Yeah.  How can people see it, though?  Can they see it now or no?  No, not yet.  I mean, at Tribeca they can.  I think it's got maybe another screening left.  So there's really no reason for you to be here.  Oh, lost.  That's very true.  Okay, guys.  See you later.  No, lost.  She said the film.  If you're in New York, go see it and try it.  No, I know.  These movies...  It's weird, though, because...  Is this movie getting a nice buzz? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, it's been getting...  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's strange, though, because you never know if...  Some of these movies never get picked up even though they have a nice buzz.  No.  That's true.  Right?  Don't depress the girl.  There's so many movies out there.  Sure.  It's not enough.  Did I just make it awkward?  No, not at all, because you're already promoting Lost, which is certainly going to be on.  Well, in this movie, it sounds like something I would like to see.  That's for sure.  Are there other celebrities in it, or is it you and then just kind of like an unknown cast?  No, there's Keith Grayson, who's an amazing ball player. 
[02:51:00]  He's the guy.  And then Harold Perrineau is actually in the movie, too.  Who's that?  From Lost.  Yeah.  Who does he play?  I don't know.  He plays this fucking amazing, quirky character.  And I never got to see him on the movie, but...  Who is he on Lost?  I don't know the real names.  Michael.  Yeah, Michael.  I'm so bad, I'm like, hmm.  Oh, which one?  I don't know.  There's so many people.  Has there been somebody on Lost that you have never worked with? 
[02:51:30]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Maybe some of the others, but no, because we always have these big group scenes occasionally  where everyone's just there standing around.  And then you'll see, like, my favorite are some of the extras that have to just be there  to fill out the scene.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, what about my story?  You know, I crashed, too, and I'm here wondering what the hell's going on.  And then sometimes they do.  Sometimes it's like, oh.  They go into it a little bit.  An extra gets a part now.  Naveen Andrews, is that Saeed?  Yes.  I swear to God, until I saw this, I thought Naveen Andrews was a woman's name. 
[02:52:00]  Really?  I had no idea.  I don't know.  That's so mean.  No, I'm not even...  He's great.  No, I love Saeed, but I just...  Naveen doesn't sound like a guy's name, and they never match it up with anybody's face.  So I have no idea who...  Oh, right, because the credits just roll.  They just roll in alphabetical order.  So I had no idea who played who.  Oh, he's good.  That last episode was pretty good.  I won't tell you, Jimmy.  But, right?  Right?  What happened?  And then when Ben's walking away...  What happened?  That face he makes...  Yeah?  And then what? 
[02:52:30]  So telling.  Yeah?  That Ben, we've had him on here.  And what a despicable character he plays on that show.  Oh, it's fantastic.  He's just like...  He's so docile, but so violent and awful.  Yeah.  And then he comes on the show, and he's a nice guy.  He's got these amazing eyes that just show so much.  Yeah.  And he could put that voice on.  Like, he'll just talk, but then all of a sudden he puts that creepy voice on.  Probably one of the creepiest characters on a TV show that...  Very unassuming looking.  He doesn't look like he'd be that...  Just a normal guy. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  That creepy, but...  Oh.  And then what was...  Who was his buddy?  He was in the last episode, too.  He's dead now, but it was like a flash.  Is he dead, or did he die?  The big guy that turns out to be gay?  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Friendly.  Mr. Friendly.  Tom.  He had his little buddy in the hotel room there with him.  Yes, he did.  Give him a little kiss, and you're like, what?  Well, you said earlier that it's not my style, Kate.  Right, right.  So you kind of knew.  Yeah.  Kind of knew, but you know, you see him kissing some young man in a hotel room. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  A little much.  Emily.  That's pretty funny.  The listeners are loving that you cursed.  Yeah, she dropped an F-bomb.  You dropped the F-bomb, and they're loving it.  Oh, down under?  Please.  Oh, is that all I have to do to gain?  Yeah.  Oh, just that.  Just swear some more.  What's your favorite curse?  It's got to be the C, because that's the big one everyone loves using with that accent.  Probably fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Now they're...  Use that one all the time.  Now they're really losing it out there.  One of my personal favorites.  Yeah.  Let's say how to... 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  It's just the easiest one to remember.  Yeah.  When you're angry.  Or Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel's a bad one, too.  Nagel is what we say.  Here in the States, it means shit.  Yeah.  We just say Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Yeah.  So if you just go, ah, big hunk of Nagel.  Steaming pile of Nagel.  You never say that.  Yeah.  Are you screwing with me?  No.  No, just ask Eric Nagel in the...  Can you say, are you fucking with me?  He's over there.  And then we'll answer correctly.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Texas.  Jerry.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:54:30]  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, uh, Jimmy, have you asked her...  I know you're looking for a new lotion.  Have you asked her about, uh, about a lotion?  You know how your skin's a little bit dry?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy...  Do your arm a little bit.  Yeah, Jimmy's got...  You gotta check out Jimmy's arm.  Hi.  Why?  What's up?  They make fun of me because I have just little wispy arm hairs.  I don't have man arms.  Just show her.  That's nice.  It's embarrassing.  Look at his arms.  It's embarrassing.  So you want a cream to grow more hair?  Just touch it right there.  It's him.  Look, look, look. 
[02:55:00]  He scares people.  What just happened there?  I just giggle when people talk about it.  He tries to scare people like that.  Oh, that's a good face.  That's a good Ben face.  Wow.  Oh, did you see that scene?  No.  He looks a little worse for wear.  Maybe he shouldn't.  I'll tell you what happened.  This is what I watched up to the part.  I watched this week's episode up to the part.  Oh, wait till you find out why he's making that face.  Where they're all running.  Where Sawyer goes to get the kid and is coming back. 
[02:55:30]  And they go, he can't get back in.  Yeah.  Well, he's going to get me.  Did he go to get you?  I don't remember because I didn't see that far.  I just saw Sawyer.  He picked her up from the exploded house.  But nothing.  It was just a band-aid.  Under the clothes horse.  Yeah.  Just a band-aid.  I didn't get that far.  Let's go to Ted in Atlanta.  Ted Turner, everyone.  Yes.  I really love the way Emily says the word Charlie.  Can you say Charlie?  Charlie.  Charlie.  Charlie.  How many times was that in the script? 
[02:56:00]  Charlie.  I know, right?  Where's Charlie?  Probably at least five times an episode.  Yeah, you worked with him a lot.  I guess there's some people.  Do I see you with Locke a lot?  Yeah, quite a bit.  Yeah, okay.  Because I'm in his group now, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was also protecting you when Charlie was acting a fool with the baby.  Locke is the one that was giving him a beating.  True.  True.  A beating.  Hey, when an actor gets killed off on a show, do you guys, because you know you're not going  to see him anymore.  Is there a really weird grieving on the set, just because you know that you're not going 
[02:56:30]  to see this guy that you've worked with so much?  Yeah, it is weird.  It is weird, especially when they don't live where you work, too.  So it's not like you're going to see them at a coffee shop or something, yeah.  I hate to tell you, but I'm very lost.  I'm going to watch the show.  Hey, if you curse again, we'll promote your movie.  I'm trying to help out the listeners.  They're loving this.  One guy says, have her say, I want to get off this fucking island. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, my God.  They did it on CW11.  That would just be...  Yeah, Emily, could you say that?  I mean, you don't get an opportunity to say that on any other interview you're doing  today.  What am I supposed to say?  I want to get off this fucking...  I want to get off this fucking island.  There you go.  The movie's called Balls...  How is that?  Now you can promote the movie.  I was ready to promote your movie by saying the movie's called Balls Don't Lie.  They really don't.  That's the porn of this movie.  Yeah, the porn title.  That's going to be the X-ray version, right.  Lift the dress.  Oh, you.  And now Bill K wants you to say, where's my baby? 
[02:57:30]  What about my baby?  Oh, no.  I've said that.  That's ingrained in my mind.  Is that the one that Bob Kelly hates?  I don't know.  Bob Kelly loves his show, but he doesn't like how you say...  He's one of our guys that does the show a lot, and he doesn't like how you say baby.  Well, it was just always...  It annoys him.  He loves you, but the one thing...  It was just that she was always saying that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My baby, my baby, you know. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  Enough about the baby.  Your baby will be fine.  My baby's been taken about six times now.  Yeah, quite a few times.  I seem to get it back unharmed.  Yeah, somehow.  I also like this line, I'm coming with you.  No one can seem to stay put anywhere.  It's like, well, I'm going to head over here.  I'm coming with you.  And the other person says, no, don't come.  And they go, yes, I'm coming.  And then there's a pause.  And they go, all right.  Let's go to James and Riverhead. 
[02:58:30]  James.  James.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Emily.  Any future news on when Jack's going to find out you're his sister?  I forgot about that.  Possibly.  How about that one?  Possibly.  And I heard...  They're supposed to answer every question with possibly.  What's that?  You heard what, sir?  Charlie may be in some sort of episode this week.  Charlie is in an episode already.  Possibly.  Because Jack is going to have like a horrid fever and everything. 
[02:59:00]  Because he's going to be very sick.  And he'll probably see some things and some people and get some wisdom.  You know, it is really...  I would think.  It is weird.  The end result of Lost is going to be wizardry.  There you go.  Hey, can we show off the instant feedback?  Because now they're asking for stuff that I can't...  You can't have requests for that.  She's going to charge...  She's a charming young woman.  I can't read half this stuff.  You're lucky I can't see that far.  Yeah.  I mean... 
[02:59:30]  Why?  What are they...  Yeah.  Have her say, shut your fucking mouth and...  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's what I'm getting at.  She's a nice woman.  Are we children?  Are we?  We're children.  There's six-year-olds listening to this.  No, they're not.  No.  Maybe.  No one's listening.  No one's listening at all.  No one's listening.  You didn't see the satellite ratings?  Trust me.  All right.  Emily, it was a pleasure.  We love your laugh.  These guys loved you on Lost.  And they loved your cursing.  And they loved your cursing. 
[03:00:00]  Well, it was a pleasure to be here.  And the movie's going to be...  It's called Ball.  Ball.  Don't Lie.  Don't Lie.  And it's featured on Tribeca.  So we're just waiting to see when it's going to be released and all that.  Just make sure.  Check the Tribeca schedule here in New York.  Like she said, there might be another screening for it.  So you can go down and see it.  It's a great film festival, obviously, that De Niro runs.  And Lost, of course, Thursdays at 10 o'clock on ABC.  Yeah, they changed it to 10, huh?  What time was it on?  Are you bumming out about that?  It was on at 9, I think. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, it was on at 9.  It was on at 10.  Is that bad?  I don't know.  I mean...  Like, why would they do that?  Fans are just going to watch it.  It doesn't matter what time it's on.  No, I know.  Why would they do that?  It's just so weird to do.  There's nothing to watch.  Some other shows came back.  I think Grey's Anatomy.  Yeah, they were always moving stuff around.  Why would you move a show like Lost?  I think Grey's Anatomy.  Is it?  Yeah, it is, isn't it?  They know Lost can't be hurt, though.  It can't be hurt.  And so many people probably DVR it.  They've probably done research that shows so... 
[03:01:00]  It doesn't even matter when shows are on anymore.  Because you DVR it.  I'm watching it the next time.  I'm guilty of that.  It's a great lead in that Grey's Anatomy, but...  Ugh, enough with the sappy music.  And you're not going to hurt Lost, wherever you put it.  Oh.  I didn't watch it when it first came on.  I was so sick of hearing about it.  Everybody loved it.  And then he gave me the box set.  All right, look.  Look, she can't read porn titles.  All right, can we turn this off?  Look, she's probably got a lot of interviews to do.  We should let her go.  Before we really say something stupid.  I know, and never have another Lost person on again.  Well, if you can't figure it out, I'm just kind of baiting her. 
[03:01:30]  Would you stop it?  I just want her to go,  Oh, hell, I'll read whatever you want.  And then we'll print this stuff out.  Opie's the asshole.  I'm the nice one.  Depends.  Always remember.  Just keep that in mind.  I'm just having fun.  I know.  It's good cop, bad cop.  He knows.  Don't mind anything he says,  because it's probably him trying to get you, like, going.  What are you doing?  I'm blowing up your spot for just this once.  Why?  Any other guest, I would leave you alone and let you play. 
[03:02:00]  Why?  Are you getting uncomfortable?  Because we play good cop, bad cop, and it works very well.  Why are you getting uncomfortable?  Because I like the show a lot, and I think she's fantastic, and she's very pretty.  I've been enjoying her giggling at us the whole time.  We're morons.  She lost all respect after us.  So, you're married and divorced three times a month.  What happens?  How could she take us seriously?  Oh, I know.  And then that man-child walks in.  I got it off Wikipedia.  It's a biracial zero.  Tummy.  And he waltzes out with a stupid afro. 
[03:02:30]  You shot your husband?  Is that what happened?  It's written down.  The beauty of Sam is like, yeah, don't blame me.  I got it off Wikipedia.  She starts laughing immediately, because she's like, oh, my God, even my, like, four-year-old  niece knows that's garbage.  But that's happened before with other guests.  I've asked other questions that I thought, oh, this should be a very interesting conversation  point, and it turns out it was completely false, because, you know, people just, whatever  they read online...  They should just go with it.  Yeah, yeah, that's what happened.  Right.  She's 12.  I also have five illegitimate children.  All right. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  My babies.  Well, I'm going to update Wikipedia after this interview.  You should, yeah.  No, that wouldn't be nice.  Oh, see, that was a good scene right there.  Did you see this, Jimmy?  Which one?  Oh, yes, I did.  Oh, okay.  I did.  We take the gun.  Yes, I did see that.  That Ben's a badass.  Oh, yeah.  He is just a badass.  Wait, how did you guys get in the desert?  It's in the future.  This is him, yeah.  It's a flash forward.  They were having flashbacks, and then flash forward, someone had decided, let's have a  flash forward.  I got a lot of catching up.  Let's have a flash sideways. 
[03:03:30]  It makes it so much more confusing.  Yeah.  In a good way.  You just need it a little more confusing.  Well, it's good, because they don't do that vroom thing with a flash forward.  Do the eye.  Yeah, yeah.  The eye opens.  Yeah.  I got a question.  I've never seen Lost, so how many hours do I have to watch to catch up?  Holy jeez, you're just screwed.  I'm not even kidding.  You're screwed.  You really ... The show is so specific, and there's so much going on.  Oh, I would never just start watching.  I'd have to start from the beginning.  You'd have to start from the beginning.  How many seasons is it up to?  Fourth season right now.  If you started today ... 
[03:04:00]  Four, and there's 13 per year?  No, there were 22.  Oh, fuck.  Someone could get you by Christmas.  And now there's 16.  And they're an hour each.  They're 42 minutes each without commercials.  It's so good.  You will be so addicted.  I can't tell you how fast I got hooked on this show.  Yeah.  The first episode, it's so badly ready.  The pilot's probably one of the best pilots ever.  I like the pilot a lot.  Yeah.  It was really interesting.  You just didn't know what was going on.  I assumed, okay, this is going to be a 2000s version of Gilligan's Island. 
[03:04:30]  Great.  They're going to crash, and then how far can you go with it?  Apparently very far.  Yeah.  I cry a lot watching Lost, too.  I swear to ... I've cried during ... I'm such a Mary.  I have cried during so many Lost episodes.  We were on a train once, and my ex there was with me, and when Locke got shot in the  little ditch ...  Oh, yeah.  And it really kind of looked like he was dead.  Yeah.  I'm being killed.  She starts crying like, it's okay.  He'll be fine.  Yeah.  No one's really dead. 
[03:05:00]  It's Lost, right?  Don't worry about it.  Someone's saying it would take ...  I'm not going to kill off a character like him, although they did kill off ... what's  his name?  Echo?  Yeah.  Echo.  Echo?  I couldn't believe ... Was it a contract dispute?  The guy was on fire.  I know.  He had the whole Nigerian plane thing, and you're like, this guy is here for good.  He was a good character.  Yeah.  He's dead.  Someone said it would take 90 hours to catch up.  It's straight.  You get addicted, though.  It's a very ...  Box sets are like ... They're the downfall.  I just finished The Wire.  Just sitting here listening to people discuss your show.  She really wants to smack her face, but she's polite. 
[03:05:30]  How silly is that?  What?  She's just like, keep discussing my show.  All right.  You know when you're sitting at FH Riley's, and there's a bunch of fans sitting around  talking about this show?  Yeah.  How much you hate it?  Yeah.  That's what she's doing right now.  No.  I don't hate it.  I'm very happy that you guys like the show.  How long is it going to take for you?  Except for you, because you haven't seen it.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  How long after this interview are you going to fire your publicist for getting you on  this show?  I give it about five minutes.  Let her go.  She's got to go. 
[03:06:00]  Right?  Yeah.  Are you happy, Seth?  They're going, yes.  Yes.  Did this go okay?  Are you happy?  Did it go well?  Well, her teeth.  Oh, no.  It didn't go well at all.  We could read body language.  You know, you don't have to.  That's what's going to be the conversation in the elevator.  You don't have to curse because people tell you to.  Yeah.  That's not good for you.  Don't.  Don't do that.  Don't you know who you are?  Oh.  Well, we could do.  Yes.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  The new time is 10 o'clock on ABC.  We're very hurt now that we're people from Lost, but.  Can I get a picture with you, please?  Sure.  Why are you asking her now?  Wait till we're off the air. 
[03:06:30]  Because, no.  Because on the air, she has to say yes, so she seems mean.  She would say yes.  She doesn't seem mean.  I said yes.  You mean, so don't seem mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you don't seem mean.  No, you would seem mean if you said no.  She wouldn't say no, though.  Why would she?  Yeah.  Well, this interview went well.  It was great.  She did.  She did fun.  It went very well.  She's in a hurry.  Anthony.  Don't be too mad on yourself.  No, never you.  The publicist.  No, Anthony.  They're usually the mean ones.  What's going on is Anthony's a fanboy when it comes to law, so he's very, very nervous.  He wants these interviews to be, like, perfect.  Yeah, it's got to go well, because I want, like, the whole cast eventually. 
[03:07:00]  That's what's going on here today.  He's a huge fan.  Does Sawyer get a lot of girls?  I look at him, and it depresses me.  The guy who plays Sawyer is so, he's so handsome.  I'm like, because I'm such a psycho, like, I'll see him, and all I'll picture is my girlfriend  sleeping with him.  Oh, no.  How do you do that?  You're torturing yourself.  Because I'm like, that's the type of guy that could just take your woman, like, and she  would shamelessly leave me.  Did you see him in the crying video on Aerosmith?  I didn't know.  Pretty funny.  He's got, like, two seconds in that. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he steals a purse and runs down the sidewalk.  That's funny.  Pretty funny.  Let's save that gem until he's in.  First, we had the failed marriage, and then that one.  Oh, we got a bombshell for him if he ever comes in.  You're an ass.  All right, the movie's called Bald, Don't Lie.  Emily, it was a pleasure.  Thank you.  It was a pleasure.  Thanks for stopping by.  We appreciate it.  We're going to take a quick break and continue.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi, Leslie.  Mr. Nielsen.  Hello? 
[03:08:00]  Hi.  Hi, Leslie.  How are you, sir?  Hello?  Are you?  Well, I'm bald, yes, yes.  Yes.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  We should play drunk or stroke.  And you mean start to do comedy?  Exactly.  Okay.  Stroke?  Drunk.  Or Alzheimer's?  Drunk.  This is about the roughness connection I've been on in a long time.  It's called a synapse. 
[03:08:30]  That's the bad connection.  I'm glad to see that you're having a good time.  You should have a good time at this point in your life, too.  And I would just drive blindfolded down the Pacific Coast Highway.  They're having a great time.  Let them go, please.  That's what I'm begging God to do.  Mr. Nielsen.  Leslie.  Hello?  Oh, yeah.  Tool. 
[03:09:00]  Opie and Anthony.  On your radio dial.  Anthony blowing up my spot.  For what reason?  I don't know.  What?  Well, I...  I was, like, in that, like...  Like, that fun mode.  And you were really paranoid I was going to blow up your spot or something.  Well, I didn't want the, uh...  So you blew up my spot.  I didn't want the interview, um, to be one of those that, uh, all of a sudden  takes a turn for the worse, and we get nobody else from Lost.  Nah.  People, uh, I'm very misunderstood.  We still got to get Jack and, uh, Sawyer in here at some point. 
[03:09:30]  And then it's okay?  And then, uh, let me think.  I had no idea.  Who else?  I'm in love with Kate.  Oh, Kate.  Yeah, Kate, we got to get in here.  I want her more than anyone.  That's, like, top priority.  I had no intention of, uh, getting mean with her.  Saeed, it'd be good to get in here.  Sure, sure.  I was having fun with her, that's all.  And she was having fun with us.  She giggled a lot.  I know.  I wanted to keep it that way.  That giggle was nice.  I wanted to keep it that way.  That was a nice giggle.  When she giggled after touching Jimmy's arm, that was pretty good, man.  She had a little thing for me, I think. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah?  She hated that she was married.  You were feeling it, Jimmy?  Yeah, I got vibes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's why Jimmy asked the question, by the way.  Which one?  Yeah, oh, married, uh, marriage, uh, didn't, uh, last.  Uh, the means of you're free.  Are you free?  Do you, do you need to take someone to Hawaii with you?  You know how fast I would just, I would just be gone from the show for a few days?  Like, I wouldn't quit, but, uh...  You'd just not be here.  Yeah, and you'd say, where are you?  Hawaii.  Of course you would.  She'd probably find me first class. 
[03:10:30]  First class.  Jimmy?  You want to go to Hawaii?  Charlie.  Charlie.  She's a pretty girl, man.  I got to interrupt this very, very interesting conversation, because we got Eric Logan stepping  out of the meeting to help us out.  Elo!  Hi, guys.  Hi, everybody.  Just, uh...  What was that, your condition?  Or a greeting?  What?  Hi, guys.  I haven't talked.  We haven't talked.  Hold on.  No.  We haven't talked in a while, Eric.  This is Jim Norton. 
[03:11:00]  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Uh, very good.  Not particularly good, according to Arbitron, but...  Well, that's why we got Logan on the phone.  There's a few people thinking we're hiding behind these horrendous ratings that came out  on Friday.  Orbitcast did a whole thing on the ratings and said, coming up next week, meaning sometime  this week, they're going to explain why the Arbitron ratings are complete bullshit.  But I didn't want to wait until they finally do that article on Orbitcast, so I figured,  let's get Eric Logan on the phone and see what the fuck's going on. 
[03:11:30]  Because according to the latest Arbitron ratings, our show gets only 171,000 listeners on XM.  Is that anywhere near true?  No.  I mean, the first thing is, is that...  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Who's calling me?  Who's this?  Awful ringtones.  Look, you're on an awful ringtone.  That's an awful ringtone.  No.  It was George Strait.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Have you sucked his dick yet? 
[03:12:00]  God damn.  Enough about George Strait and his dumb channel.  Hey.  What's wrong with the channel?  There's nothing wrong with it.  We all know about it by now.  It's a great channel.  George Strait is...  Got more listeners than Howard Stern.  What do you care?  The George Strait channel does?  I have no idea.  Oh.  I don't say that.  Oh, all right.  So walk us through.  First of all, according to in-house research at XM, how many listeners do we have?  Hold on.  I didn't know I was doing...  I thought I was talking POTUS.  Your lovely producing staff goes, oh, no, they want to talk about POTUS. 
[03:12:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  I didn't know we were doing a ratings review.  POTUS sucks.  POTUS.  So bad.  POTUS is god-awful.  I know there's a lot of people that work really hard on it.  900,000 is your answer of QM, by the way.  For our channel, according to in-house research?  In-house research, yes.  And how does that rate with all the other channels on XM?  Let's see here.  QM.  First of all, in terms of share, by the way, in terms of share, it's the number one channel  on the network. 
[03:13:00]  So when you look at it, because you know you guys have, like, these massive Time Smith  listings, by the way, you'll love this answer.  Wait, according to the share, we're the number one channel on all of XM?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Have been for the last two, I think three surveys.  Two surveys, for sure.  And are numbers staying flat, going up, going down?  Actually, they've gone up.  Gone up.  Oh, well, a lot of message boards are saying that, you know, they're canceling subscriptions  and we're going to hell in a handbasket, so.  Really? 
[03:13:30]  Interesting.  So your numbers are going up, I think, in New York.  Who do I believe?  A message boarder or ELO?  What's ELO?  What's that?  No, I was going to say, I mean, your ratings are actually going up in New York, if I'm  not mistaken, right?  Yeah.  What?  On regular radio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Absolutely.  Going up here.  Let's see.  The number two channel on the network, which I don't want to give off all the proprietary stuff,  but I'll just say it's a music channel, in terms of share, by the way, you have three  times the time spent listening they do.  Ooh. 
[03:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  Now, the Arbitron ratings, now, were they given to the in-house research, is you guys  are just foolishly talking to people who have XM, so you're going directly to people.  This is the funny part.  I mean, we're doing something really crazy, like talking to people who are actual subscribers.  How did Arbitron come to their shitty figures?  And why is it getting a lot of attention, more importantly?  Well, first of all, the reason why it gets attention is because, well, let's back up  for a second.  Remember when we did this call it four months ago, we talked about this, what Arbitron is  doing is they are calling somebody who's listening to AM and FM radio. 
[03:14:30]  Right.  And if they just so happen to have satellite radio or hear satellite radio, they write  it down.  Right.  That's all it is.  So we don't even know if they're talking to subscribers, because they are not recruiting  subscribers.  Right.  That's the first thing.  And the second thing is, is that, you know, the, the, why is it getting all the press right  now?  The reason why it's getting all the press right now is because what Arbitron is doing  is releasing these ratings to try to make a point about how satellite radio is not an 
[03:15:00]  impact whatsoever to local radio.  Well, local radio pays whose bills?  Breitbart.  Breitbart is right.  Or the Politico.  Either one.  People are saying, POTUS, I'm thinking.  I'm reading this.  People are saying that the original figure is now correct.  The Arbitron figure since you've been talking.  Yeah, but this will get picked up because it's, it's such bullshit.  And, you know, it's on Orbitcast. 
[03:15:30]  It's, it's all over the place.  Now, here's the question I got for you.  So by the way, I'm just looking at, I'm like, cause I'm actually not even, by the way,  just to be candid, when Arbitron releases this, I don't even look at it cause it's such  garbage.  So I'm looking at it for the first time.  It says the virus has an 18,500 AQH.  That's what this says, right?  Right.  All right.  I'm looking at this.  That's only off of a factor of 10X plus.  Hold on.  That's what Arbitron's saying? 
[03:16:00]  So if you look at, and again, I don't want to give out all of our numbers on the air here,  but I'll just give it out.  Don't worry.  No one will understand.  I don't even understand what you just said.  What's AQH?  AQH is average quarter hour.  Okay.  So average quarter hour, which is the share, which is the only thing you guys, we worry  about, like, you know, how you rank that share, right?  Is 18,500?  That's what it says right here.  Is that Arbitron?  According to Arbitron.  Okay.  All right.  I got you.  All right.  The surveys that we do, where we talk to, again, I know this probably is a little inaccurate,  but when you actually talk to the subscribers who are paying the bills for the business, 
[03:16:30]  Right.  I know it's wacky.  Work with me.  That number is off of at least a factor of 10x plus.  10 times plus?  10 times plus is what I'll tell you.  All right.  So now you're talking that it's 185,000.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just saying, at minimum, that number is so far off, it's laughable.  But it's not 1,800, is it?  No.  Yeah.  For the people who don't know what that means, it doesn't mean you subtract 10,000.  According to Elo, without giving too much away, Arbitron's saying we have 18,500 per quarter 
[03:17:00]  hour.  And according to XM Research, that number is off by 10 times that.  So 10 times plus, which means it could be closer to 200,000 or 190,000.  That's the quarter hour.  The QM is much higher.  And by the way, these numbers are just so off, it's completely laughable.  All right.  Here's the question.  This is the tough question now.  Now they compare our channel to Howard Stern's channel.  And why did he do favorably better than us in the Arbitron survey? 
[03:17:30]  Not only better than us, probably he destroyed us, according to Arbitron.  Well, I think I'm pulling up the Arbitron one here.  But I mean, again, listen, I've never denied the fact that there's a lot of people who bought  Sirius for Howard.  I know it's boring, but that's the truth.  If they're going by people who might not be subscribers, then people are saying Howard's  name because they know who he is.  You're exactly right, Jimmy. 
[03:18:00]  One person could have a serious subscriber, right?  And it could be in an office place and 15 people could be hearing it.  And that's how it's going to show up.  They're going to write Howard Stern.  And here's the other thing.  And I said this six months ago or three months ago, whenever we talked about this last  time, which is you guys are also on local radio.  Howard's not on local radio.  So if somebody in a diary writes down Howard Stern, who gets the credit?  Well, Sirius, in this world.  If somebody writes down Opie and Anthony, who gets the credit right now is actually AM and  FM radio first and satellite last. 
[03:18:30]  Arbitron really fucking bugs me.  It's like either talk to the subscribers or don't fucking pretend you're doing the right  thing.  Logan's a great spin doctor, man.  He made us feel really good today.  I think he's right, though.  They talked to the subscribers.  I don't think that's even spinning.  It's not like they went to the XM subscribers and got shitty data.  They just fucking did it the same way they do regular ratings.  And if someone happened to have XM or Sirius, they asked them.  I don't think that's a very accurate way to talk to people.  They're just shilling for terrestrial radio.  Right. 
[03:19:00]  This is all a shill for terrestrial radio.  You're right, Jimmy.  And the other thing is, by the way, is that at the end of the day, we don't care what  terrestrial radio people think.  We only care what our subscribers are paying us for.  Right.  All right.  I just wanted to get you on the phone to explain that because people were asking me.  I'm like, I don't know, man.  It doesn't seem, something seems wrong because XM's telling us one thing and Arbitron said  another.  Well, you know programmers well enough.  If there was like really concerns, we'd be having lots of meetings and I'd have you in my  office.  We'd be talking about that third stool, that leg and all that.  Remember all that? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we haven't done that in a while.  Bucket.  Oh, me?  Yeah.  Jimmy's the third stool.  Now, Elo, are you, well, no, you have an interesting story from last week, but I don't  want to like go over the line.  Are you talking about it or?  Which story is that?  With the wife.  Oh, with the kid?  Yeah.  Oh, with the car wreck?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's fine.  I'll tell you.  Well, I kind of mentioned it on the air, but I didn't mention who it happened to, but Logan  Logan, I mean, all kidding aside, Logan almost lost his wife and his kid. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Listen to this story.  You tell me how you handle this.  Was he drunk and leave them somewhere?  I was drinking and I left him on his park bench.  Elo was in LA, so he was far away from Washington when this happened.  Okay.  Yeah.  And a guy, my wife was putting my daughter in the car.  The back door was open.  She was putting my daughter in and a guy was on a cell phone, was driving up on the car  with the door open. 
[03:20:30]  My wife dives in to the back seat of the car.  The car hits the open car door, misses my wife literally by a second or two.  And he was on the cell phone the whole time, gets out of the car and basically says, oh,  sorry, I wasn't paying attention.  But he took the door off for the most part, right?  Yeah, ripped the hinge, ripped the door off the hinges backwards.  Were you on XM at the time?  And was he listening to it?  Well, he actually was a terrestrial fan listening to Howard on illegal radio when he was filling 
[03:21:00]  in a diary.  Right, exactly.  Thought perhaps he was nodding off.  Yeah, so I'm now like, listen, I know where the guy lives.  I know everything about it.  And just taking every ounce of resistance to my body and just drive up there and find out  what the hell is this guy's problem.  Well, you guys are going to get the insurance money from him, right?  Of course.  I spend all weekend getting a new car and everything.  Rumor has it you've been Google mapping him.  Yeah, that is true.  I know exactly where he lives and how long it takes to get there.  If you need any help getting a door for your vehicle, let me know. 
[03:21:30]  Liggy, liggy.  That's pretty funny.  By the way, I had to listen to regular radio in the rental car, which was awful.  I heard the Greaseman, by the way.  Oh, Waddle Doodle.  How's he doing?  It sounded just like you, believe it or not.  It sounded just like you, believe it or not.  Just like the old Greasy.  Love it.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, do they have to put a gun to your head when you had to get that POTUS station all together?  Oh, no.  It was a brilliant idea. 
[03:22:00]  POTUS.  Just rename it Nagel.  The question is going to become, what are we doing after the election?  Yeah, and then you're stuck with POTUS.  I almost get it.  It's kind of called Son of POTUS.  And what is it?  Is it just, what is it?  It's all just the presidential race coverage?  Yeah.  Yeah, we have Joe Matthau and Rebecca.  They do their thing.  I'm sure they do a good job, but.  They do a fine job.  And we carried Reverend Wright's comments this morning from the National Press Club live. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Why didn't that go on the power?  Stop it.  I love how he's got a sound machine.  Audio from the parking lot.  Oh, Jesus.  It's just, it's something funny about him pausing and hitting his own buttons in his office.  Hilarious.  Absolutely.  Timing's still off.  I've got to work on my time.  At least yours works. 
[03:23:00]  Elo, do you have a position in the new company?  You've been making me nervous.  Doggy style at the moment.  You get no.  Is that what they're telling you?  Is that what Mel's telling you?  Nobody's called me.  I have no idea.  Oh, my God.  I'm here for the long haul.  I'm committed.  Merger, I know you don't want to play your hand, but let's say, will it happen, FCC approval  within a month?  I don't know.  We've got justice approval done.  FCC is going to happen when the FCC is ready. 
[03:23:30]  Wait, but you guys did a 60-day extension, right?  Yes.  On the original deal, because the original deal ended March 1st, then you guys had to  do a 60-day extension.  That's going to end May 1st, right?  That's correct.  And then what happens?  I assume that they'll probably have to do another one.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I don't know.  But 404 days since the merger has been announced, so.  Unbelievable.  And thanks for standing by me, too, when certain jizz bags were trying to fucking throw me 
[03:24:00]  to the wolves, by the way.  I appreciate it.  Oh, you're welcome.  Listen, I love you.  You know that.  A lot of faces I'm going to spit in when this fucking whole thing is over.  Believe me.  Who was...  I can't name them at this time.  Oh.  Jimmy and I know.  Yeah, well, you guys know, too.  They know, too.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think.  Just make sure you turn the power talk cameras off.  Oh, that one, and then the other one.  Yeah.  Can you write it down, Jimmy?  Well, you already know.  You already...  Oh, over there.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, just fucking, you know, they're all gone.  No, they're not.  Some of them are still there?  No.  Yeah, yeah, there's...  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Garbage.  Wait, wait.  What is that face?  You just made a face from one of the band cartoons.  Who the fuck is that?  I'm kidding.  I have no idea.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know you could get your lips that big.  No, it's the one...  It's the trick.  What?  You just got it in your tongue.  Oh, okay. 
[03:25:00]  You went with that?  Yeah.  All right.  We got a big...  We used to do that in the house all the time and laugh at each other like we were.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Bye, Eric.  Thank you.  Eric Logan, everyone, from XM Satellite Radio.  We got a big star calling in.  One of Anthony's favorites, Shawnee Smith.  Shawnee!  Hello.  Welcome, Shawnee.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  I'm so glad I get to wish you a happy birthday.  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you, Shawnee.  Shut up.  Thank you.  Shut up.  It's not your birthday. 
[03:25:30]  It's mine.  How did you know it was our birthday?  It was my birthday.  It's Anthony's birthday.  No, we all share the same birthday.  Anthony, what did you do on your birthday?  I had a party.  I can't believe another year's gone by that we have not achieved.  We have not met our destiny.  I know.  People have been speculating on message boards because I broke up with my girlfriend, by  the way.  Did you?  I kind of want you to know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And people have been speculating that I've been seeing you.  Really?  Yeah.  Who's been speculating that? 
[03:26:00]  Message boards.  Shut up, Jimmy.  No one has thought that.  No one has.  Yes.  It hasn't even come up in casual conversation.  It has to.  When did you break up?  Have you had long enough where I wouldn't be your rebound?  Yeah, you wouldn't be a rebound.  That'd be cool.  How long has it been?  I don't know.  Maybe two months.  Oh, no.  That's not long enough.  You know what it was?  No, it's not long enough?  Is it long enough for us to be fuck buddies?  Well, I don't believe in sex before marriage.  Son of a bitch.  Damn it. 
[03:26:30]  What's wrong with sex before marriage?  It's called the old test drive.  How about...  You'll end up, like, you know, raising two kids on your own.  Oh, what about other...  Well, you know, we could...  Oh, no.  I hate using condoms.  Happy birthday to you.  No, she's just going to sing happy birthday.  It's good to know that Shawnee Smith is into the old natural.  So what did you do on your birthday?  Big party.  Saturday night.  We went to a bar. 
[03:27:00]  Went to a bar.  I believe it was called Smith.  Yeah.  Really?  What a coinkydink.  Yes.  What a coinkydink.  Yeah, we went to there and drank a lot.  You drank, Shawnee?  I am in a rock band.  It's required.  It's required occasionally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's why my voice is kind of shot, because I was singing.  Because I'm in a band, too.  Me and you have a lot in common.  You guys should do a duet.  We can tour together.  Yeah, if you want to tour together.  On the road romance.  That'd be cool.  Yeah.  That kind of sex is okay before marriage, because it goes with the rock and roll. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, just like backstage action, stuff like that.  And then we go out, and it'll end all, like, stormy and violent or something.  You'll throw something at me.  It'll be great.  Yeah.  We'll be passionate.  Backstage, I say, you know, take care of your groupies.  We'll be passionate.  Because they need to be taking care.  You've got to take care of your groupies.  Yeah.  And at the end of the night, the duties are done.  Do you point out at your roadies and go, yeah, I want him backstage and him, like the guys do? 
[03:28:00]  They point out at the girls in the audience and make the roadies drag them back there?  Well, we haven't really gotten out on the road yet, but I'll let you know.  You'll do that?  Okay.  Because I'll be in the front row somewhere.  Glenn the Tool writes, I broke up with my girlfriend about as subtle as a car taking off your car door.  Well, I wanted Shawnee to know, you know, that I had broken up, so.  You're really doing the rock and roll thing?  What is it called? 
[03:28:30]  Smith and Pyle?  Smith and Pyle, yeah.  A year ago, Missy Pyle and I started a band as a joke.  Yeah.  And now we're about to release a record that Chris Goss produced from Masters of Reality.  Sure.  And we recorded out in Joshua Tree and it turned out to be a really good record.  We were on, it's like a, we call it Desert Country Rock.  And it's just this kind of blend of, like, heart and humor and, of course, sex and country. 
[03:29:00]  And, um, we were on a Dee Snider show the other night, we were doing Fangoria and we played  a couple of songs acoustic in the record and he was, like, filled with the spirit.  He was.  I don't know, it's some kind of a...  Dee.  I'm just kind of keeping up with it, but it's been, like, nothing but fun.  You don't like Dee, right?  Well, you know...  Not like as much as me, right?  I'm holding out for you.  Thank you. 
[03:29:30]  Shawnee, this is Jim Norton.  Um, the name of the...  I just want to say if she knew me.  I know, Jimmy.  I think everyone gets that one.  You idiot.  You just...  Sorry, I was distracted.  Just desperate for attention.  She really was the worst, Jimmy.  Hey, you like...  Tricked my sex out of wedlock.  Needed my attention for a minute and I apparently missed a really good joke.  No, no, no, not at all.  I just like to see if famous people know who I am and they very rarely almost never do. 
[03:30:00]  Shawnee, I'm reading from people that you...  Do you enjoy guns?  Do I enjoy guns?  Yeah.  Well, I have shot some guns...  Yeah?  ...a few times and I've really enjoyed it.  Oh, cool.  So, in that sense...  Well...  Because I have guns, but it's strictly out of paranoia.  Well, I think it's...  These are times to be paranoid.  Oh, see, I like the way you think. 
[03:30:30]  I'd say pick your spot in the hills you're going to run to.  Yeah, see?  That's good.  And bring your guns.  And a girl, because, you know...  There's lots of girls.  Well, if you're a guy.  So, what else can you tell us about this band?  Yeah, are you guys like hard or you like...  Is it more country or is it more rock?  I have not heard any of it.  This is Jim Hort again.  You know, it's...  It's like a...  Well, do you have a... 
[03:31:00]  Somebody was going to maybe get a song over there so you could hear it.  Yeah, we got one.  Which one do they get?  Let me see.  We got a lot of...  Wow, is this the whole CD?  You guys got five songs out?  That's a preview.  We have a full record that's coming out the end of July.  You were also in The Grudge 3 you just filmed.  Is that creepy kid in it again?  Um, yeah, there was a creepy kid.  Creepy kid's like 30 now.  I didn't work with a creepy kid.  I worked with his creepy mother. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  He was a sweetheart.  Meanwhile, I didn't think I'd have to work with anything creepy.  I figured they'd put that stuff in CGI or something in the end.  And I couldn't even...  I rented one and two because I thought, well, if I'm going to do three, I should see the  first two.  Right.  And I could not bring myself to put them in the DVD player.  Why?  Um, because it's too scary.  Like, I knew there was going to be this funky, awful image of this, like, white ghost with  this weird walk and noise as I could read in the script of part three. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, I hate that movement that they do.  And I just didn't want the image in my head meanwhile.  That scared the shit out of me.  There was a CGI involved.  This actress comes out from London and they, like, paint her up all white and she chases  me through a medical building.  It was awful.  Yeah, that's creepy, the way they move.  Oh, don't worry.  It's all fake.  It's just a movie.  Let's hear a little...  Let's hear a taste of Smith and Pyle, Shoney Smith's new band.  I don't have the track listing here, so I'm sure you'll recognize the song. 
[03:32:30]  You can tell us what it is.  Okay.  Here we go.  Smith and Pyle.  Hey.  Oh, rock.  Wow, man.  I can't believe they left it on out.  This is a special...  It certainly doesn't sound a lot like Metallica.  Was Metallica an influence on you?  It sounded very close to Metallica. 
[03:33:00]  Opie.  What?  You're being mean.  I didn't start my first bounce, Robert Trujillo.  Yeah.  Oh, I love him.  Did you just wake up?  It's Metallica.  Good for her.  Did you wake up?  No, I never went to sleep.  Are you in L.A.?  Yeah.  Nice.  What'd you do all night?  Yeah, what's a Shawnee Smith night?  Yeah.  Well, here's the balance of Shawnee Smith's life.  On Friday night...  No, Saturday night, Smith and Pyle played the Fangoria for the Fangoria people. 
[03:33:30]  Um, trashed a hotel room, drank a lot of tequila.  A tequila girl.  Why'd you trash the hotel...  It's the reference of downtown Los Angeles after the rock show.  Why'd you trash the hotel room?  Because that's what you gotta do when you're in a rock...  Come on!  All right.  No, I wanted to see if that was just why you did it.  I like the fact you kind of owned up to that.  You just got to.  It's part of the rock and roll.  We're not buying it.  It is...  Now, you're in L.A. right now, and it's probably...  And then last night, I was up all night with my two-year-old son, who didn't want to sleep. 
[03:34:00]  Which is very rock and roll.  Hey, Ant.  Oh, a kid.  Yeah, Ant.  All right, anyway, the new band is Smith and Pyle.  See, you just blew it with Anthony.  Oh, I got it.  We could leave the kids with the babysitter or something.  Anthony is not a big fan of kids.  Well, I don't have it.  Well...  This could wreck your whole potential relationship.  Potential.  Anthony, look.  Yes?  You got to have the light to appreciate the dark. 
[03:34:30]  Oh!  I like it.  Wow.  As long as you don't have the dark and then not enjoy the light every time you go back  to it.  Get it?  Yes, Jimmy.  We get it.  Are you in...  So, you're in L.A. and it's very late or early and stuff.  And what...  Were you laying in bed?  No, I'm hiding from my kids out back.  Oh, you're out back.  Kids-uh.  I thought maybe you were just kind of lounging around in bed.  Oh, well...  Not wearing much.  You know, in bed wear.  Yeah.  You know, that bed wear. 
[03:35:00]  I can let you tell me what I'm doing this morning.  That's what I was trying to figure out.  But what do you wear to sleep?  Um...  What do I wear to sleep?  Because you do have kids.  They probably, what, run the room and stuff?  Well, you know, it depends if I have company or not.  If it's a rock and roll night or...  Hmm.  What do you prefer to sleep in?  Um...  You know, I just prefer to...  Dude.  To, um...  Dude.  I don't know.  You know, this conversation cannot be nearly as hot as it should be, so... 
[03:35:30]  We should just pick something else.  No, it's simple, because, like, I'm...  It's like putting together color forms.  I'm trying to...  I see your face there.  I see the bed.  But I don't know what else to picture.  What do you sleep in at night?  Uh, usually nothing.  Nothing?  Yeah.  Winnie the Pooh, Feeney, pajama bottoms.  It's just...  It's just nothing.  It's just easy that way.  Nothing better than flipping the old undies off your foot and throwing it across the floor  and getting into bed.  Sorry.  Watch them stand up by themselves.  No.  I'm very clean. 
[03:36:00]  Anthony, do you look like Burt Reynolds when he was nude?  Shut up.  When you're nude.  Nice 1975 reference, Opie.  Just hair everywhere.  Hey, Sean, you need to know that Anthony has a big one, and he's very ashamed of it,  because it's so large.  I'm not ashamed of anything.  Jimmy will tell you.  It's a too large penis.  It's not this huge, large...  Anthony gets very embarrassed by his huge penis.  When he takes it out, it actually makes the same noise as the kid in the grudge.  It croaks.  Yeah, it croaks. 
[03:36:30]  No.  See, we all go...  We take bathroom breaks together, because, you know, you only have four minutes every  hour or whatever, and Jimmy and I go right to the urinals, and Anthony hides and shame  in the stall.  No, because they're a little too...  Why are you ashamed of your large penis?  No, they're a little too peaky, looky, touchy at the urinal, and I find that a little weird,  and I'd rather just go into a stall and have a little privacy.  He's just ashamed.  I'm not ashamed of anything. 
[03:37:00]  Anthony, stand at the urinal and...  Be proud?  Be proud.  You do that Superman pose and just let it go, man.  You are an ass.  I don't know how I work with these people on a daily basis.  Likewise.  If we're going to, you know, have this relationship, I think you should see if you like the music  at least.  Well, do you guys have any upcoming gigs?  Are you playing out yet, or not yet?  Jim Norton again.  Well, we're playing, we're playing on a couple of these, like there's a, we're playing in 
[03:37:30]  Knoxville, Tennessee in a couple weeks, and maybe in, we have a few, like, sometime we're  going to be in the East Coast.  All right, cool.  Are you open for anybody?  We release the record and, and, and go from there.  Missy and I started our own record label to do the, you know, we've done it all on our  own so far. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  And we also have, like, we're working at bringing the musical variety show back.  Who's Missy?  Is she your lesbian lover?  Missy Pyle.  P-Y-L-E.  Oh, that's the...  She's like a famous actress.  I think she's a famous client.  Oh, that's the Pyle part.  All right, I gotcha.  So, you guys...  Six feet tall, blonde hair, blue eyes, gorgeous.  And the, the website is smithandpyle.com for info on the band?  Yep.  All right, why don't we, uh, why don't we thank Shoney Smith for calling for Anthony's  birthday, and why don't we play some, uh, Smith and Pyle for real here?  Thanks, you guys. 
[03:38:30]  That would be very nice.  What song would you like to hear?  We got Spankin', Sugar, I Like You Too Much, Flower in My Hair, I Wish You Were Dead.  You know, I would just, being as it's your birthday, Anthony...  Yes.  I would like to dedicate Spankin'.  If I were there, I would Spank you for every year, and you would deserve every one of them.  Oh, one of those, like...  Sure.  One, two, 44.  Yeah.  44.  Your hand's gonna be really sore by the time you finish Spankin'.  It is not.  Not that.  44 Spankin's for you. 
[03:39:00]  Jesus.  More than that.  For me.  Are you a fan of the bare-bottom Spankin'?  Absolutely.  It's the only effective kind of Spankin'.  How hot is that?  She just said that.  It's pretty good.  She meant it, too.  That is very sexy.  Yeah, you can tell.  Jim Norton thinks you're very sexy.  Jim Norton, I can't believe I got to talk with you today.  Thank you.  On the phone with you.  I appreciate it.  I waited.  Shawnee Smith, okay.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Shawnee.  Thank you, guys.  True friend of the show.  As we say thank you, we're gonna play Spankin' here from Smith & Pyle.  Happy birthday. 
[03:39:30]  Thank you, Shawnee.  Thank you, Shawnee.  Nice to meet you.  And there goes Shawnee Smith.  This is Spankin' by Smith & Pyle.  All right, she's gone.  She's gone.  All right.  What she'll ever know.  Come on.  Ah, shit.  Keeps the relationship going.  Keeps the relationship going. 
[03:40:00]  Sure.  Keeps the shit off the radio.  The second that phone is hung up.  Click.  All right.  She's gone.  I have some good news.  Jimmy?  Yes, Jimmy.  Nor Den.  Someone has just handed me something that says Deb is here with cupcakes.  Yum, yum.  Give me some.  Oh, those cupcakes.  And I would like one only for the radio.  I normally wouldn't eat like this.  So you want to eat a cupcake for the radio.  Why is she here? 
[03:40:30]  Ron and Fez are off today?  Um, she likes us.  Oh.  I hope.  Snap.  Oh, she's back in town.  Where are the cupcakes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll have a happy typing girl.  The lovely Deb.  You're spending a lot of time in Chicago.  What's that about?  Have Ron and Fez delved into that?  Why are you spending a lot of time in Chicago?  Chicago.  Chicago.  My roommate and best friend opened a cupcake place out there, and so I go to visit. 
[03:41:00]  I've never heard of a cupcake place.  Why?  I've just never heard of a cupcake place.  Magnolia is on Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side.  Usually a bakery or something.  No, there's like 10 of them.  No, cupcake places are all the rage.  All right.  What flavors you got here?  Yeah, what do you got there?  You got the Ron Bennington, which are the chocolate ones there.  They have peanut butter filling, and they have butterscotch and butter fingers on top.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Chocolate with brown butter icing over there. 
[03:41:30]  Strawberry shortcake, which Ron says are poisonous because he's afraid they're...  His are the number one right now, and he doesn't want them to beat him.  These are the chocolate-covered strawberry pumpkin spice with marscapone and red velvet.  Now, what are you doing for this cupcake shop?  Well, my roommate owns it with his brother out in Chicago, so I just go visit and eat.  But you should be getting a piece of the action.  Why?  Because you're brilliant.  I didn't do anything for them.  Yeah, but you know, you get on TV with Reverend Al and talk cupcakes on CNN. 
[03:42:00]  I don't know if Reverend Al wants cupcakes.  This is called the Bennington that I'm eating?  That's the Ron Bennington.  He actually came up with the idea for it, and it really is the number one seller.  The whole week I'm in there, everybody comes in, I want a Ron Bennington, I want a Ron Bennington, I want a Ron Bennington.  Holy shit.  Jimmy's just creaming over there.  How good is it, Jimmy?  It's fucking great.  Now, what does it taste like?  Chocolate and other peanut butter things is so fucking good.  Is there peanut butter in the middle of it or just on the top stuff? 
[03:42:30]  Oh, there's stuff in the middle.  Oh, I see stuff in the middle, Jimmy.  Thank God these aren't that fattening.  Yeah, they're not fattening, right?  Holy shit.  I'm glad you like them.  This is so fucking good.  I know you think I don't love you guys anymore, so.  You do, don't you?  Of course I do.  Are you kidding?  How's the show sounding to you?  The show?  Laughing our asses off out there.  Oh, in general, not today.  Oh, in general?  Yeah.  I love the show.  All right, name one thing we've done in the last week.  You're not going to get that.  Last week?  It's Monday.  I've been in Chicago all week. 
[03:43:00]  Next week.  I've been in Chicago all week at 5 a.m., so I missed last week.  She's just being nice.  I'm not just being nice.  When did you stop listening to us?  I did not stop listening to you guys.  This is so good.  Ant knows.  I'm on Pal Talk.  Oh, this is good.  How good is this fucking cupcake?  That's a good fucking cupcake, Jimmy.  Who else wants a cupcake?  Where's E-Rock?  Does E-Rock want a cupcake?  E-Rock, why don't you try a cupcake?  Which one do you see in there?  The Ron Bennington looks really good, but it looks like it should be called the Dave, 
[03:43:30]  the Eastside Dave.  Looks like what he leaves on the floor.  The pumpkin, the mascarpone, or the strawberry shortcake?  Molly cupcakes?  You have something with garlic buttersaw?  Eric doesn't like chocolate.  Oh, really?  Which is odd.  Not fattening enough.  Sorry, Eric.  Which one do you eat?  The strawberry shortcake one.  That's pretty good.  There's a surprise inside.  Strawberry.  This is so...  Oh, my God. 
[03:44:00]  So what do we do?  Do we, like, promote it or something?  Molly'scupcakes.com?  I really just brought them for you guys to eat.  No, I know.  But is there a website?  There's a website and a MySpace slash Molly's Cupcakes, Molly's Cupcakes.com.  And do they, like, they obviously will ship?  No, they won't ship.  That's a tough thing for our listeners here in New York and everywhere else.  We're going to figure out a way to ship them.  This is so good.  We're going to open here.  No, see here.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  Big announcement.  Yeah, well, not ready yet, but definitely in the plans.  That's all you brought for the Ryan and Face show? 
[03:44:30]  I'm sorry.  No, I got two thousand outside for them, too.  You're not a...  You're a smart...  You're very smart and very educated, but you're not a smart businesswoman.  Well, it's not my business, for example.  But you should get a piece of the action because you could bring cupcakes to the world because  of the two radio shows you're associated with.  What's this?  Which one?  You get them an online business, you take a piece of the action, and you make a little  money on the side.  To ship cupcakes, you've got to put preservatives and do all...  You've got to be like a supermarket cupcake to ship. 
[03:45:00]  It's like Debbie always says, what are we, Jews?  How about you open up the New York office?  That is absolutely in the works.  Oh, okay.  See, I'm looking out for you.  These are so heavy, Opie.  That's a heavy cupcake.  Yeah.  Pumpkin spice.  I'm only doing this for the...  Yeah.  Yes, E-Rod.  So there it is.  We will sell cupcakes in New York.  Deb will handle security.  Yeah.  That's right.  Well, it's really cute.  All your Chicago fans came in because they've got no place to get together.  They don't get to have anything come to any of the parties or events, so they come 
[03:45:30]  to my ways and have coffee.  All right.  Eat a cupcake.  Holy shit.  Is the pumpkin spice a fucking home run?  The pumpkin spice is a fucking home run.  E-Roc's in studio.  Cheese, Snoop, Proposition Joe, all get shot and killed in season five.  Just unbelievable.  The death and destruction.  Oh, Jesus.  I heard it this morning, so it's so big.  Oh, yeah.  And of course, Omar, but we all do that.  You ate that whole fucking cupcake.  Almost all of it's too rich, but it's been really good. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  What were you saying?  You were pointing at that guy.  Her friend, Mike, who you own, co-own.  Are you guys more than friends?  No.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  He wanted to say something, but he doesn't want to come on, Mike.  He's afraid.  Don't come.  Not to be shy.  Why are you afraid, Mike?  I don't like to talk.  Come sit with the big boys.  This is so good.  What do you got to say?  He doesn't talk at all.  Mike, come on over here.  I'm lucky I got him to come in.  Mike, don't be nervous.  This is your thing, right?  Be proud. 
[03:46:30]  Jimmy's loving your cupcakes.  You know how badly.  I'm going to bring one home, and I'm going to eat it a little later this afternoon.  Cool.  I think in the new shop, we're going to make Deb a partner with us.  You really should.  Yeah.  Me too.  Well, you don't live in New York.  You live in Chicago?  No, I live in New Jersey, but I've been traveling back and forth.  Wait, you're the owner, and why?  I'm so confused.  It's me and my brother.  My brother lives in Chicago.  Oh, okay.  So this was all his idea, and I just tagged along for the ride.  Very good.  By the way, I'm just letting you know, we're helping you promote Chicago and helping you 
[03:47:00]  promote maybe New York City, but I got Long Island.  You got it.  All right?  Long Island is my cupcake territory.  I wouldn't move in.  I need your sister.  My sister is big into cupcakes and cheesecakes that you can sample at FH Riley's of Huntington  Village, 400 New York Avenue.  I guess some people are getting together this Saturday night at FH Riley's.  Do you guys have any cupcake place plans for Pittsburgh this Friday?  I'm just saying, maybe you're going to bring some cupcakes to the Byham Theater this Friday. 
[03:47:30]  They are really fucking good, man.  Well, we were a little late today, because last night we took an unexpected detour to  Pittsburgh on the drive back.  Apparently, the road split.  We weren't paying attention.  Wait, you drove back from Chicago?  Yeah, you can't.  There's no other way to get these back.  Why?  It should have taken 12 hours, but it ended up 15.  What the?  Flyer.  I like to fly.  You don't like flying?  My best friend's having a baby any minute.  I wanted to be able to get in my car and go on a moment's notice. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  Not worry about canceling.  Right.  Take a fucking 12-hour trip as opposed to an hour flight.  Right.  That's the only way to do it.  You want the kid to be in college by the time you get here?  Oh, shit.  Swim walk.  Oh, yeah.  You get a phone call.  Oh, shit.  Another cupcake.  You get a phone call.  You can't walk out the door and be on a plane.  You can.  Yeah?  I can.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, absolutely.  Just say someone died.  They'll get to the plane.  You're eyeballing another cupcake.  I won't have a third.  Jim, you have to.  You are eyeballing another one.  The strawberry one has your name on it.  Oh, the brown butter icing.  I cannot have brown butter icing. 
[03:48:30]  But I will tell you, the pumpkin spice, I have to say, was a fucking winner.  Yeah.  Good one.  I might even like that better than the Bennington.  Wow.  Don't say that.  You won't like hearing that one there.  Fez.  And where's the Fez cupcake?  There is no Fez cupcake.  Oh, no Fez.  Oh, boy.  There was one, but Fez said he didn't want one after Ron yelled at him for trying to steal  his cupcake glue.  That makes perfect sense.  Of course it does. 
[03:49:00]  That's a red velvet with cream cheese icing, and it's fantastic.  If you like the cheesecake.  It looks delicious.  I bet the Fez would have to be nutty and fruity.  A little fruity.  Hey!  I heard you say cream puff this morning.  Cream puff.  Weepy icing.  Yeah.  It would have to be adorable.  All right.  How do you make an adorable cupcake?  Because Fez is adorable.  The wonderful Happy Typing Girl and some dude named Mike.  All right.  Enjoy them.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  We really appreciate it.  Those were good. 
[03:49:30]  God damn it.  Oh, Jimmy.  Now they'd be left right next to Jimmy.  I won't have any more.  Are you in high heels or something?  Yeah.  I know they're loud on this floor.  No, your ass was like, cha-chonk, cha-chonk, cha-chonk, cha-chonk, cha-chonk.  Looks good.  What?  Sorry.  That's a compliment, by the way.  Cha-chonk, cha-chonk, cha-chonk.  Cha-chonking because of her very tall shoes.  Happy Typing Girl's ass is fucking, it's like all of these cupcakes, delicious.  It looks delicious.  You like her ass like, you like those cupcakes.  It just looks fantastic in those jeans.  All right.  Listen.  As long as it's not full of peanut butter and nuts. 
[03:50:00]  What do you mean?  Even if it is, it should be full of icing.  Let me put some on there.  Yeah, it's sexual innuendo.  Ooh.  Naughty radio show.  Yes, this is naughty.  All right.  All right, listen.  This is a tease for tomorrow because we've run out of show.  I've got to wash my hands.  Oh, wait.  I can't even get this going.  I'll be right back.  Oh, it's in delay.  Oh.  All right.  We're going to play this, though.  This was some production somebody did.  Thank you for applying to the retarded fast food service industry.

All right, enough with the dad.  Hey, fuck you!  Yeah. 
[03:52:00]  There you go.  We'll get into that tomorrow.  Wow.  Some anger.  Yeah, Than and Sam had some radio gold during the Than and Sam show this past Saturday night.  Tony and Pat Duffy going at it.  Yeah, we had about three hours of it.  That was your show?  No, the radio gold.  You waited fucking three months to do a radio show and that was it?  No, you said there's radio gold in our show, and I said it lasted the whole show is what I was looking for.  Oh.  I didn't get to hear it this time.  I'm kind of bummed at that.  I guess we'll save Lampshade Dude for tomorrow.  Yes, that story needs some time.

You've got to hear this new production piece.  I want to play it again for you.  Do you have anything to do with these fucking pumpkin spice cupcakes?  I want to eat these.  I want to just sit on a toilet and eat these until I'm shitting.  I'm so depressed lately.  I just want to eat until I'm physically shitting.

Oh, it's wonderful.  The both qualities I look for when I meet someone.  That's right, motherfucking like me. 
[03:54:30]  She's so kissable.  She has a cute, kissable little mouth.  You like that?  How can you not?  She was adorable.  How did she look when she took her coat off, finally?  I didn't even notice.  Did you notice that?  She looks good.  Fucking look at The Hills Have Eyes when she's laying in that little fucking chair.  Could you get a picture of that?  Outside the motorhome.  Really fast as we do Line of the Day?  Yeah, punch that up there.  No, she was covering up everything.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, she looked pretty fucking good.  Yeah.  And then she finally took the coat off for pictures.  I'll be honest with you, you look pretty fucking good. 
[03:55:00]  Here's another runner-up Line of the Day.  I'm going to say my farewell to you by doing something I've always wanted to do.  Imitation of R. Bud Dwyer.  Very nice.  That was a goddamn good one.  Boy, R. Bud Dwyer comes up a lot on this show.  As he should.  He lives on.  I know his head is fucking on the ceiling somewhere.  And he had the dumbest look on his face.  His face looked like this when he was, after he got time.  Hrumpf.  Hrumpf. 
[03:55:30]  Hrumpf.  Dan S. from Long Island writes,  Hey, guys, can you give mention to the fact that Otto and George are doing the Saturday Night Virus this weekend?  Is that true?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, Otto called me.  He wanted to come in because he is doing a Saturday Night Virus.  So we should have Otto in to promote that.  I forgot.  How great is this?  The name of his show is called Puppies and Sunshine with Otto and George.  All right, cool.  So this Saturday night, Otto's doing a little radio.  Yeah.  With his puppet, George.  Because I call it his wooden friend. 
[03:56:00]  Roland.  His wooden friend.  Roland.  Roland.  Roland.  Roland.  Have a cupcake, Roland.  What are you doing?  What are you, a fucking communist?  Come on.  Roland, want a cupcake?  What flavor do you want?  Pumpkin spice.  Pumpkin spice.  Pumpkin spice.  Pumpkin spice.  Pumpkin spice.  That's it right there, my sweet.  Take a bite of that fucking cupcake.  Matches your head.  And tell me you don't like that.  Pumpkin.  You're supposed to take the wrapper off first.  No, he's eating the wrapper.  Look, there's whipped cream on him.  He's just a wreck. 
[03:56:30]  He can't eat his first bite and he's freaked all out.  He did take the paper.  It's on his shirt already.  One bite.  Oh, God.  And then he had to awkwardly take his lip and get rid of all the rest.  There we go.  Now we're talking.  He dragged his tooth along the paper and ate it.  Yeah.  You fucking bear?  Yeah, look at that.  We should hang these cupcakes in a tree if we don't run wrong.  Look at that, Jimmy.  Wow.  Nice, right?  Wouldn't mind smooching her when the shit comes out. 
[03:57:00]  Nice.  Give us some more.  The shit comes out.  Give it to her in the old shit cutter, right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  That's how you like it.  Who's telling the mic?  Give her a nice plug for fucking Molly's Cupcakes.  It is delish, right?  Who's delicious?  That's a thick, heavy cupcake.  It's not a flattering picture.  That's not like a fucking Duncan Hines bag of shit light his air cupcake.  That's a fucking thick, cakey piece of cupcake.  Did you see the picture of Earl naked?  Ugh, yeah.  Talk about hot. 
[03:57:30]  Hot, right?  Grr.  Yeah.  All right, here's your line of the day.  It should have been a gamble.  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I'll call your movie by saying, uh, the movie's called Balls Don't Lie.  They really don't.  That's the porn of this movie.  Yeah, the porn title.  That's going to be the X-ray version, right. 
[03:58:00]  You lift a dress.  Oh, you.  Six flags.  Oh, we didn't do six flags.  Wow.  We didn't do the funnel meter today.  That, I don't have it on here.  There you do.  It keeps getting kicked off.  It keeps getting, like, fucked up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We got to do some maintenance on that machine.  Oh, really?  Sorry.  I'll stop talking.  How many cupcakes have you had, Jimmy?  I had two, but I'm not eating another cupcake.  You got to taste another one.  No, no.  I'm done.  I'm actually moving these into this box. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah?  Why are you doing that?  I'm going to take one cupcake home, but I got to put the other ones in this box.  And are you going to have it when?  Like, in a week?  Huh?  So, you're taking one home.  Yeah.  Are you going to have it in, like, a week?  Or are you going to have it the day after tomorrow?  When are you having that cupcake?  I don't know why.  Because I know you want one right now.  I actually don't, because I ate an omelet this morning.  And I had to take the other cupcakes in this box.  And I had to move the cupcakes in this box. 
[03:59:00]  Into that box.  Yeah, I had to transfer them to that box.  Oh, yeah.  It's raining.  Oh, right.  It is raining.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no other way to get a cupcake home.  You're going to carry that huge box that only has one cupcake in it?  For one cupcake, I'm going to put it in that box, into this box.  Can I see your cupcake, please?  No.  Why?  Why?  What would happen?  It'd be a fucking pancake.  No. 
[03:59:30]  But I earned that.  But I earned that cupcake.  Help yourself.  Yes.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  What a homeless dope.  He sure was.  Fuck you.  What a shitty thing to earn.  I could have bought that with the money I made.  Remember the expiration date was like six months prior?  Of course.  Came out of the dumpster somewhere.  You know it.  Fucking asshole.  You put some footprints in it.  There you go, bum.  Here you go, bum. 
[04:00:00]  Have a fucking pro-ked cake.  This should brighten up your awful life.  Pro-ked cake.  That's right.  I have a Nike cake.  Shit.  Ah, treat yourself.  I earned it.  What?  How many fucking blowjobs did that cost you?  Would you earn a fucking seat under the awning?  Fucking earn nothing.  God loved you.  You wouldn't be out here fucking.  How can you earn something that you just take out of a garbage pail?  I don't know.  Maybe you did some work for Starbucks.  You probably pointed, probably said, look, a bum will give you some fucking used dirty old 
[04:00:30]  cake if you do a task.  Ah, that's earning it.  This is some dog shit.  Clean it up with your fucking fingers.  I was just about to ask, what could possibly be the task?  I don't know.  Hopefully sit anywhere but in front of our store.  That's how we earned it.  By being a bum elsewhere.  That goddamn cupcakes are good.  Dan, are you having a cupcake?  Yeah.  Have one.  I want one.  Treat yourself.  Yeah.  You're going to have one or 40? 
[04:01:00]  Treat yourself.  How about fucking, uh, Dan, you got to have one, right?  Oh, yeah.  Don't be so shy, fuck.  Sorry.  You're fuck.  Because you didn't take a cupcake.  I know.  This is your fuck.  Hey, I'm a dickhead, aren't I?  Hey, I'm a dickhead.  I'm a cupcake right away.  He's getting fucking fresh.  Hey, he's getting fucking fresh.  Break up my party.  Fucking have a cup.  This party.  It's him and another guy.  Worst party.  I don't describe this party the best.  It's him and a guy in a hat.  What is he going to take for you guys to stop?  I don't even have the car in question anymore. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, he doesn't have it.  It's right outside.  Hello?  What do you need?  Your mother's cunt, then.  Hello?  Your mother's cunt.  Fuck you.  Hello?  Fuck your mother.  Frank.  Hello?  Living it, boy.  Frank.  That's good, Dan.  Touch every one and then pick one.  Oh, Dan.  Fucking, he touched everyone with those fucking long karate fingers.  Take the paper off now.  Let Danny come in here and pick one so they're not all gone for Danny.  Sam, you want one or you want to just go on Wikipedia? 
[04:02:00]  I'll feed one to somebody.  Where's the Bennington?  The Bennington is that one there.  It's fucking fantastic.  Oh, but you've got to have one, man.  Donaldson, Kornfeld, get a good one.  The one I love, the pumpkin spice is actually my favorite, but they're gone.  The Roland took it.  Seems to be a lot of these.  They're good, too, I'm sure.  Where's that?  Let Travis and Lisa have them.  They're fucking, just, they're really good food, man.  Can we have one before you ruin them?  He's going to ruin them. 
[04:02:30]  Deb, I love you, and I think the cupcakes are wonderful.  Aww.  We can't ruin it.  We can do it.  What do you do?  What does your wife have to pick out the one that you ate, Travis?  I am pointing out the one that she wants.  Is that what happens?  Hold on.  I'm pointing out the one she wants.  Can you please, can you please just make a decision on your own and pick out your own  cupcake?  Radio going on.  Oh, no, don't do it.  Hit Sam on the other side of the glass.  And the windup.  What, why, oh my God, that's a delicious one, too.  Why don't you just take a bite first? 
[04:03:00]  I, I, I, I will.  No, Sam, get on the other side of the glass.  The last Bennington has gone.  Lisa grabbed the last Bennington.  Good move.  Oh, no, why?  I wouldn't do that.  No.  Oh, who's going to have to clean this up?  Someone should lick it off the wall.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, jeez.  All right, who wants that cupcake?  Wow.  How do you like the Bennington, Lise?  You like it?  It's fucking amazing. 
[04:03:30]  Travis, what kind are you daintily taking out?  No.  I believe this is the strawberry cupcake.  Oh, what was that?  Are you being a, no, I'm picking my own cupcake.  That's right.  I'm putting my foot down as a man in this marriage.  Exactly.  I'll take this cakey dessert.  You guys are unfair.  Did you take that one because it looks like Dexter?  It doesn't look anything, well, the color, kind of.  Well, I was thinking the strawberry.  It would be good if it was cut in half.  It's terrible.  Hads suck.  How about, uh, she doesn't hear you. 
[04:04:00]  She's eating.  Good, right?  Yeah.  It's essentially a birthday card.  They're fucking a hand-truck.  Well, I saw, yes.  Wonderful.  Yeah, are they?  How's that?  I only had the strawberry.  Is it good?  How about getting fucking Ron the intern?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Ron.  Ron.  Can I have a piece of fucking cake?  Ruined my party.  Yeah.  You want to have a piece of cake?  Yeah, sure.  All right, well, there's some on the mirror.  On the mirror?  Mirror? 
[04:04:30]  Whatever the fuck it is.  Have one.  Don't take a fucking cupcake, kid.  I'm kidding.  Right here.  Jesus.  Someone sent me NASA Space Hoax.  Have you seen NASA Space Hoax?  NASA or NASA?  NASA.  Space Hoax?  No, what's that?  Space Hoax.  NASA Space Hoax.  Is that about the fucking moon landing?  Yep.  And then I got a...  Can I see it?  No, you can't.  Don't be.  And I got a JFK2, The Bush Connection.  Oh, Jesus.  The Bush Connection. 
[04:05:00]  And then I got Morgan Spurlock's new season of 30 Days.  Working in a coal mine.  30 Days in a Wheelchair.  Animal Rights.  Same Sex Parenting, Gun Nation, and Life on an Indian Reservation.  Gun Nation.  What's the problem?  Problem.  And then Roland gave me a movie called Surf Wise that's supposed to be really good.  I exercised my Second Amendment rights and NRA sent me something.  It was a little petition to sign and send off to Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer.  And it implores them to listen to the gun lobby and not try to outlaw our guns. 
[04:05:30]  I don't think anybody wants to outlaw guns.  Yes, they do.  I don't want to.  Stupid.  You know what stupid Obama wants?  He wants to get rid of all semi-automatic weapons.  All semi-automatic weapons.  But he wants automatic ones to be legalized.  That's the odd part.  Okay.  That sounds like a good deal. 
[04:06:00]  That annoys me.  Annoys me.  Are we still on the radio?  I think so.  Yeah, we're having some cupcake talk.  It's been a fun show.  I enjoyed it very much.  Emily DeRaven.  Yes, she was very nice.  Shawnee Smith is a fucking trooper.  Oh, look at the picture there.  They have been a perfect hiney with the fucking...  Cupcakes.  Cupcakes.  That's a nicer picture than I got.  Fucking Eric always takes a picture.  He sucks.  There's fucking 80 people in the background of every fucking shot Eric takes.  Eric's terrible.  He's fucking terrible. 
[04:06:30]  A horrid photographer.  Hey, Eric, you want a cum cake?  Get in here.  Did you just fart?  Yes, I did.  A cum cake.  It's a funny wordplay thing I do.  Get used to it, folks.  A lot more of that cumming.  C-U-M-M-I-N-G.  Oh, my God.  In the following days.  Oh, that's not even...  D-A-Z-E.  That's not spelled properly.  That's double entendre Jimmy.  Oh, oh.  Another cupcake being taken.  Yeah, look, Travis is...  What?  You're not even halfway through the first one.  Oh, God.  You're wearing a fucking collar shirt under a sweater.  Get aged.  Dainty little girl bites. 
[04:07:00]  Look at your nibbling at it.  Would you rub it on your vagina?  Nah, penis.  Your wife just went for number two, and you're barely...  You're not even halfway through the first.  We're show prepping.  Do you mean the second one or Nagel?  Wow.  Roland wants me to remind you...  Get enough of that Nagel shit joke.  Roland wants me to remind you that we have Adam from the Beastie Boys on tomorrow.  Oh, yes, we do.  Oh, cool.  At 10 o'clock.  Do we?  Yes.  Nice.  I'd like to talk about fucking Mumia Abu-Jamal and a few other issues.  Yes.  Same key, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Same locksmith. 
[04:07:30]  All right.  We're out of here.  Let's get straight apartments.  Come on, now.  Let's just get out of here now.  All right, y'all.  Ron and Fez, Moon and Tree.  Yep.  Stay tuned.  Ah, this is terrible.  No confidence cursing.  The FCC is pounding on the back door of the radio station.  Where's Steve?  I'm smoking blow in the bathroom.  All right, this is a complete disaster. </pre>
