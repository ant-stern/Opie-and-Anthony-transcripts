FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  100,000 nerds, several dozen D-level celebrities, a couple of people who are actually famous,  Jim Norton, and because someone had to hold the camera, Sam Roberts.  The OP and Anthony Channel presents Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  So we're here, of course, with William Shatner. Thanks for giving us a few minutes.  No, it's really a pleasure. 
[00:00:30]  It's amazing how the sarcasm bleeds through in less than one sentence.  I thought I disguised it as much as well.  No, it's wonderful.  What are you promoting? We have to get that out of here.  All right, well, on July 28th, on Epyx TV, we're debuting a documentary that I made called Get a Life,  in which I asked the question, who the hell, hell, who the, we're on Sirius. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Who the hell comes to Comic-Con?  Who the heck comes to Star Trek conventions?  Why are they there, and why do they keep coming back?  And I asked that question, get a life in a sketch on SNL.  Right.  Then I wrote a book called Get a Life, in which I concluded, and I asked the same question,  in which I conclude on the book, in the book, that they're coming to see each other.  I thought they were coming to see me. 
[00:01:30]  No.  No.  They're coming to see each other, and to renew friendships and renew friends.  So you like these conventions. You have a good time when you come here.  Yeah, exactly. So they have a good time, and that's why they come. Well, that's not why they come.  And so I asked the question again, and I made the documentary, and I come to a far different, deeper, more serious conclusion.  And that's the enticement of what I want your audience to see on Epyx Television, July 28th, at 8 o'clock.  Well, I shot something for Epyx recently. They're a great network. 
[00:02:00]  They promote things properly. They really are. It's a good place to be, if you have a project that you want out there.  And Epyx is a very underrated network. A lot of people don't go there, but I think they should.  I think they should, too.  Now, you're very healthy-looking. We were talking before you came in about how great you look.  Are you kind of a Ray Kurzweil disciple? We've interviewed him. I like him a lot.  Well, you're talking about the singularity?  Yeah.  I have a metal hip. I have a hip replacement. 
[00:02:30]  I set off the detectors.  So right there is the beginning of the singularity.  Metal hip, I set off the detectors.  That's a great name for a series.  Yeah, the detectors.  Okay.  So I am already part of what Ray Kurzweil talks about.  Now, I interviewed Ray Kurzweil.  So, and here is the dilemma you face with Ray Kurzweil, okay?  Ray Kurzweil invented voice recognition so that you speak and it writes itself. 
[00:03:00]  Did you know that?  No, I knew he did something for blind people reading.  But essentially, that's it.  Okay.  He took that to voice recognition for your computer.  Wouldn't it be something to talk like this and have it being written out on the computer?  Yeah.  Well, he has it, except I went to interview him about it and he said, let me show you how  it works.  And you have to talk to the machine a while to educate the machine to your voice. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  When I had finished reading to the machine, he said, now, let's try it.  And I said, all right, here we are.  And the machine wrote, here we are, sitting at the desk, sitting at the desk with, with  Ray Kurzweil.  And the machine wrote, Ray, everybody's got to go.  So Ray Kurzweil said, say delete.  I said, delete.  And it wrote, delete.  And then Ray Kurzweil said, say delete, delete.  So I said, delete, delete. 
[00:04:00]  And it wrote, delete, delete, delete.  And the whole thing came to a shuddering thing.  And that is the singularity.  Well, do you know, because he's big on, he thinks it's going to happen in 40 or something  years, which I think is just kind of wishful thinking.  Four years?  I thought it was 50.  In 40.  In 40 years, yeah.  I think his timetable is a little off because I think he wants to be around for it.  Well, he's taking all the pills because he wants to, he wants to hang in there until  they can give him a new head or something. 
[00:04:30]  No, are those, are those pills, is there anything to that or do you think that he's just taking  too many pills?  Because I would love to do that.  Well, give him a little text and say, what are you taking?  And he takes about 250 pills a day.  It'd be great if it was all Cialis and Viagra.  So now you, are you?  You're approaching the singularity.  Maybe that's what he needs.  So you're not promoting anymore.  Whatever happened to MyOuterSpace.com? 
[00:05:00]  MyOuterSpace.com is right out there.  It is still doing it, right?  Oh, yeah.  We've got all kinds of projects going.  So you're still doing it?  Oh, yeah.  It's on the edge of, it's ready.  It's on a critical mass.  Now, do you think people who see this documentary called Get a Life, are they going to be happy  with the way they're portrayed and the way they're, are they going to like the slant  or the angle it takes, do you think?  I am thrilled by the knowledge I gained by making this documentary. 
[00:05:30]  I ask the question, who comes to the conventions?  I come, I make a conclusion as to who comes and why.  And the conclusion and why is based on sociology, it's based on culture, and it's very mysterious.  And it's something I urge you to watch to find out a really valid, positive answer as to what makes people come to conventions 
[00:06:00]  and why they are part of our society.  Well, you're an amazing guy, and this documentary, I'm sure, will be great.  Everything you do is, honestly, it's great.  And you're always working, you've always got a new project, and you're very inspirational.  So, I'm happy.  It's called Get a Life, and it is on Epyx, July 28th, at 8 p.m.  And 8 p.m.  And is it on EpyxHD.com as well?  I'm sure it is.  I'm sure it's all over Epyx.  It is?  You've done this before.  I have, yeah.  Epyx and EpyxHD.com, July the 28th.  Thank you so much. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you so much.  Love you, man.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Great.  Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  Are we good, Sam?  Yeah.  I don't really need to introduce you.  How are you, Rob?  I'm good.  You just kind of did, so you snuck that in.  I snuck in, Rob.  But, look, if I have to say zombie, then you probably shouldn't be watching or listening  to this if you don't know who this is.  How many Comic-Cons have you been to?  I've been to a lot.  I've been, I don't know, maybe five times.  What do you normally do when you're here? 
[00:07:00]  This?  Stuff like this?  Just press and just promo?  Just press and promo, then I leave.  I went to one way long time ago.  Actually, I was doing press then, too, but it was so funny.  It was hardly anyone here.  Really?  I mean, that was maybe like 15, 16 years ago or something like that.  It was a long time ago.  Are you surprised by where it's come?  Because, like, it was, again, it was this thing that was seen at one point for geeks and  nerds, but now it's not.  It's this Hollywood thing.  It's horror films.  It's really weird how it's, it really has nothing to do with comics anymore.  Right.  It was, I wonder how many people here actually read comics. 
[00:07:30]  If any.  Right.  Just watch the Big Bang Theory.  I mean, it really has become this sort of corporate co-opted sort of media event as opposed  to a fan thing.  An underground thing or kind of an underground feel.  That's what it is.  It's cool, I guess.  I mean, I used to always go to these things when I was a little kid.  I started going to, like, Star Trek conventions in the 70s.  Oh, wow.  Where it would be like nobody.  Right.  You know?  It was the 10 people who wanted to meet George Takai, you know?  Right, right, right.  Well, you're kind of like a pulp guy.  Like, you like, the record is funny.  It's called Mondo Sex Head, your new... 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  How would you describe it?  Because what you do is pretty interesting, like, remixing your old stuff.  I mean, I like doing remix records.  I did two in the past, but then after the last one, it kind of seemed like no one liked  that stuff anymore.  It seemed like it had died out, and the sort of, like, techno-y dance remix-y thing was  sort of dead.  But recently, I was noticing the amount of DJs...  You know, it's kind of...  Obviously, it's back, and it's real popular now, and I was noticing how often my songs  get mixed in.  And I was just...  I found this video of, like, Mix Master Mike using Thundercase and stuff in his show, 
[00:08:30]  and I was like, oh, I guess it's kind of cool.  So that's how it all started again.  Is Mondo a tribute at all to Mondo Topless?  No, I just...  I mean, I like that word, Mondo, because there's all those movies like Mondo Topless and Mondo  Bizarro and Mondo this, Mondo that.  You know, there's so many Mondo movies.  What does it mean?  I've heard it, but I don't even know what it means.  Is it, like, mega or major?  I guess it means, like, yeah, mega.  Mega Mondo.  So, I mean, for the Russ Meyer movie, what else would you think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is there anything better than that? 
[00:09:00]  Have you ever seen Mondo Topless?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's phenomenal.  It's pretty funny.  Amazing Bucsodics.  And you know what?  Even though it's 50 or 40 years old, it's like, those girls were sexy, man.  Like, there was really fucking juicy, sexy women in those movies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It holds up.  No, I agree, I agree.  I mean, it's like, I guess in an age before pornography was everywhere, that...  I mean, if I'm kind of excited watching it now, in 1968 watching that, must have been  like, you know, people must have been out of their mind seeing that type of stuff.  Yeah, I wonder what people thought, because, I mean, those movies were pretty... 
[00:09:30]  Well, that one, I mean, that one's kind of a weird one, because it is just endless clips  of naked, topless girls dancing.  But all the other Russ Meyer stuff were actually pretty cool movies.  I don't know if I've seen anything else he's done.  Oh, the other ones are actually really good, entertaining, funny movies.  They're not just, like, cheesy, titty movies.  Right.  You're a great director, man.  Oh, thanks.  I really, I like your stuff a lot.  You have a certain, you just capture a certain vibe.  Like, we wanted you to direct my stand-up special, but you're very busy, and it was just kind  of hard.  Yeah, it was just kind of hard to nail down. 
[00:10:00]  It's amazing now, stand-up special.  It is, right?  I just did, I mean, I did the Tom's.  You did Tom's, and have you done the other ones, or no?  No, I was just actually joking when I said that, but I do like doing them.  It was fun, though.  I mean, I don't know if you did yours the same way, but it was pretty cool, because with  Tom's, we had the truck with all the cameras, and it was like calling Monday Night Football  or something.  We were like, camera one, come to camera two, close-up, move in.  Not that close.  Yeah, well, yeah, Tom.  I never go anywhere near the truck, but the opening you did with him, which was kind of  him just walking to the stage in that weird circus thing, that was like, it had such 
[00:10:30]  a great feel to it.  Yeah, that was fun.  And Tom wanted to do something that just, you know, he, I think he feels a kinship more  with, like, old comedians, like Don Rickles type guys, suit comedians.  And he wanted to do some sort of, like, make it as if he was just one of many crappy acts  auditioning that night backstage.  Oh, okay.  So that was sort of the whole thing, like, you know, there's a clown, and then there's  the juggler, then there's the comedian, like, and he's, you know.  Yeah, kind of like in Vaudeville, to throw you all together and no more or less respect 
[00:11:00]  for anybody.  Exactly, just like the Vaudeville act.  And you're going out with Manson.  When does that tour start?  In September?  Yeah, it starts, I think it starts the last day of September, something like that.  And have you worked with him before?  Have you guys gone out?  No, we've never toured together before.  I mean, we've played together before.  We played together just recently at this big festival called Rock on the Range in Ohio.  I think it is Ohio.  I forget already.  So we've played together before.  I mean, I actually remember way back in the day when White Zombie was just starting.  They had opened for us, too.  And I didn't see them, but I just remember the name because I didn't know who they were, 
[00:11:30]  but I thought it was a cool name.  And one of my great memories of White Zombie is I met a couple when I was doing stand-up  for three.  It was like early 90s.  And they said, do you want to watch us have sex?  So I was like, yeah.  I had never done that before.  So I'm back in my room.  I'm watching this.  Wait, how did this come about?  Wait, we were just sort of rolled into that.  I used to wear a suit on Saturdays because I thought if I ever did TV, I'd have to wear  a suit.  I'm a filthy act.  So I'm in a bar, and this couple named Holly and Skip were talking, and we were just joking 
[00:12:00]  around at me watching them have sex.  So I go back to the room.  I couldn't believe it happened.  And I'm sitting in the room, and they're about to have sex.  And he goes, well, first, I've got to go out to the car.  And he wanted to go out and get his white zombie tape so they could play that while they  fucked around.  Perfect.  And I watched them attempt to have sex.  He couldn't get a rod.  I think that was their first time kind of showing them.  He was packing like fucking two and a half, and I just sat there and jacked off on my  suit.  But I have a great memory of white zombie from...  Great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now that's my memory of white zombie. 
[00:12:30]  You and your suit.  Sorry, I didn't mean to put that on you.  Do you worry when you're going out with someone like Manson, who goes on first?  Because you guys are both huge, huge stars.  Will he go up first?  He's going to play first, and we'll close every night, yeah.  Do you ever think about following people?  Is it like that for musicians as well, like it is for comedians?  I think it's always like that for everybody.  I mean, unless you don't think about that stuff, but I think about everything.  You do?  Yeah.  I mean, you always want to...  I mean, it's your job to want to steal the night.  Right.  I mean, I can't imagine anyone walks on stage going like, boy, I hope I'm second best night. 
[00:13:00]  You know, it's your job to have people walking away remembering you.  So yeah, that's what it's all about.  Have you ever had to...  Have you ever gone on after everybody?  Like, everyone has nightmare stories about when Kiss would open for them, or like, you know,  when Sabbath would open for them in the early 70s.  Have you ever had to go on after everybody, where you're like, fuck, man, I really don't  want to go up right now?  Never really had a horror story playing after anybody.  It was more playing before.  Guys had a hard time.  Yeah.  Well, when White Zombie first started, and we were touring, we were like always doing  these metal tours. 
[00:13:30]  We'd open for like Danzig, or Anthrax, or Megadeth.  But we were so weird that at that point, you know, the metal bands were all skinny black  pants, big white sneakers, black shirts.  And we'd come out, and they were just like, it was just, you guys doing that.  And then like, you know, six months later, the record hit, and it was all good.  But it was kind of a...  Every night, it was like, here, let's go on stage and have everybody hate us.  Now, I saw you guys on the last time you went around with Ozzy, and I've seen you many  times on OzFest and with him, and you're a fucking great live performer.  It's like, you engage the audience. 
[00:14:00]  It seems like a lot of guys forget that engaging the audience is important.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's the whole thing.  I mean, comedians do this every night, even more than any musicians, but you know, every  night you want, if you've got to do the same songs or the same jokes, it would get boring.  So to me, I have to make it special for me by engaging that crowd that is only there on  that night and making it sort of an interactive experience.  And if the crowd is sort of like being flat, then I feel like, then the energy goes out of 
[00:14:30]  me.  So, yeah, I got to get the crowd hyped up just so I will be hyped up.  And plus, I feel like it's important to make that crowd feel like, tonight was special.  This isn't the same thing that's going to happen tomorrow.  And it's funny, sometimes you tour with bands, and their show is identical.  Yeah.  Every night, if they say anything, they say the word for word the same thing.  Like, and they'll, you know, it could be anything.  They could be like a 300-pound naked guy, a crowd surfing, and they won't even reference  it.  They won't address it.  I mean, it's really weird, and I don't know how you can maybe be in a band and keep it 
[00:15:00]  that unspontaneous.  It's very strange.  What do you, like, for me, when I'm on stage, I hate when a crowd is talkative, or they're  not paying attention.  Like, what is it that a crowd will do, or you'll see that it just makes you fucking nuts?  The thing that I'm really sick of is people with their phones.  I mean, it was like, it used to be like a little bit of that, and now it's really, we did this  show, this big show, I don't know, recently, it was this big festival, and like, everyone  is just like this. 
[00:15:30]  So it's not like, you know, it's like 40,000 phones.  Right.  I don't care that they're filming, that's not the thing, but they're so busy trying to  film you, that they're not doing anything, except they're not even looking at you, they're  looking at the back of their phone, and I just stopped the show, and went on this 10-minute  rant that, you know, I said, everybody, put your phone, you know, if you're a dude holding  your phone, put it back in your vagina, let's fucking rock.  Right.  And after a while, everyone felt so embarrassed. 
[00:16:00]  And I mean, I've literally yelled at people, like, I'm going to come down and fucking shove  that phone up your ass, and you can see it.  Then you just drop, right?  But then they put them away, and the show goes to this whole other level, because who  cares?  It's just some crappy video that they're going to stick on YouTube that looks like shit.  And they can't, and it's right, it's like people can't move to music if they're doing  this, and they're trying not to move, because they want to keep it steady for the steady shot  that's useless anyway.  And, you know, and that's really, it's not because they're, you know, filming or, like,  no, that crap, I don't care.  It's just because the shows become a bore.  Right.  And, you know, I'm just used to, like, not to be like, oh, back in the day, but before everybody 
[00:16:30]  did that, and, like, White Zombie was touring with Pantera, and the shows would just,  it was so insane.  Yeah.  That you were always afraid the barricade was going to collapse, or the stage was going  to collapse, and now you just see a sedate bunch of people holding electronics, and what  the fuck is this?  When you hear about something like what happened with Randy from Lamb of God, or something,  like, these fan interactions can get really crazy sometimes.  Does that change the way you think about live performing at all?  Well, you've got to be careful.  I mean, it's really, I mean, I've seen a lot of people get really hurt in a second. 
[00:17:00]  And, like, I hate when people get on stage.  Yeah.  I mean, we don't let anyone on stage, but when people do, because they don't know what's  going on, so they run on stage, there's just fire shooting on them.  Right.  And then they try to make that jump, and I've seen so many people not quite make it.  And, you know, it's not funny to watch someone's face smash against a metal bear.  Right.  And then they're unconscious, gushing blood.  And it's just stupid, and I've seen so many people get so hurt doing that.  And, you know, I don't, you know, that thing with Randy is, I don't know the whole story, 
[00:17:30]  but it's insane.  And, you know, he doesn't know, you just see a kid's running out of the dark behind you.  Yeah.  And he doesn't know what to do.  He's just trying to protect himself.  I mean, sometimes you get hit with something.  I mean, I've gotten hit with things that are less than this, and, like, the whole side of  your face will swell up.  Right.  Because it's coming out of the dark and just hitting you full force in the face, and you don't  know what the hell's going on, you know?  So that stuff is a little weird.  Yeah, you kind of feel more, and everybody, I think, was super paranoid for a long time  after, you know, the dime bag.  The dime bag, sure.  How can you not think that? 
[00:18:00]  Well, you think the stage, and they're telling us we have to wrap up, you think the stage  is this sacred place, but when people break that barrier, I mean, it's like, how do you  not react by throwing somebody off when they break a barrier that feels like it just should  not be broken by a fan?  Well, yeah, and I mean, everybody, the worst thing is that everyone's adrenaline is so high,  yours and the fans, that people, it's so easy to do something so out of character that  and you're not thinking, like, oh, tackle that guy or tackle this guy or knock that guy  off the stage, and that's the biggest thing.  I don't always be afraid of way back in the day when kids just rush on stage, and that's  the thing you want to do is get knocked from behind off a 12-foot stage. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  Concrete or something.  So, yeah, I mean, I don't know.  It's always in the back of your mind, sort of, but you can't let it be there too much  because...  They'd have fucked up the show.  Right.  Well, you're touring with Manson in September, and the new CD is called Mondo Sex Headed  out August 7th, right?  August 7th, yes.  All right, well, it's good talking to you, man, and you're phenomenal, so I look forward  to seeing you live.  Right on.  Thanks, buddy.  Thanks.  Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012. 
[00:19:00]  We're Chippa TV on the YouTubes.  What's your name?  Judy.  Hi, Judy.  And why are you all purple?  Why are you all gray?  Oh, I forgot to pack my trunk.  Oh, fucking home run, Chipperson.  I didn't get it.  Oh, because I got an elephant trunk.  Oh, I get it.  My mother would tug it and go, Chippa, that's like your Peter.  Be careful.  Where are you from?  I live in France.  Oh, what brings you here from France?  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy's bulge. 
[00:19:30]  That's the biggest pecker I've ever seen.  Uh-oh.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  Well, no, I'm just saying, if it'd be very nice, if you're going to talk to women,  would you talk to them respectfully?  I normally would, but I couldn't believe the size of that thing.  There you go.  I couldn't believe it was so big.  I know, but he shouldn't walk out like that.  You shouldn't even have one.  I do. 
[00:20:00]  My mother said it's bigger than average.  Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  Hi, David.  Oh, yeah.  You're one of the few celebrities that doesn't seem to shy away from stuff that you did in  the past.  Why would I shy away from this?  The car keeps following me around.  Wherever I go, I can't get away from it.  It's like Howard Stern.  I can't get away from him.  He's following me.  He's taking parts from me.  Did you ever try to get away from it?  You just can't?  No, as a matter of fact, they're actually building one for my birthday present. 
[00:20:30]  I'm going to be of a certain age until on Tuesday, and I got a gull wing coming out,  and a real kind of a special one that still has the original nose and dash that I kept  from the original one, so it's cool.  Now, are you surprised that Knight Rider, this obsession with people, has lasted for all  those years?  Yes.  I had no idea that it would go 30 years from now that we're actually going to Comic-Cons  from around the world, and people are still showing up.  It's in development for a film with the Weinstein Company.  How?  It is, there are conventions. 
[00:21:00]  I have a hit song called Jump in My Car, which is about Knight Rider, that we did as  a gag, and it became like millions of views.  But I'm not surprised, because I got a letter yesterday from a sergeant in the Army, and he  was in Afghanistan, and he said, we're all watching it.  Right.  And 30 years later, it still holds up, and it's about heroes, and it's about, Kip was  programmed to save a life, not to take a life, you know?  And it was, it's a show that's kind of anti-reality. 
[00:21:30]  The whole world's gone into reality.  Kip was the first one that was like fun, and the first perfect parent.  It was fantasy and something like that.  Yeah, it was fantasy, it was like, I treated Kip like they did when, you know, when it  was, when we had the old westerns, you know?  Right.  And the guy, and the Lone Ranger had his horse, you know?  Yeah.  And it was silver or trigger, you know?  It was for good, not evil and stuff.  Exactly.  Now, what do you do when you're at Comical Cons?  What do you do?  Do you go out? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, well, what I do is after, after meeting and greeting all the people, what I'll do is  I'll go back to the booth, and I'll probably get a bunch of Knight Rider cars that I'll take  back from my family, and then, then what I'll do is I'll go back to the hotel, and then  I'll go out in a little incognito, and I'll change, put a little hat on, you kind of can  put my little hair out, look a little nerdy, you know?  So they'll say, that can't be David Hasseloff.  That's like a guy looking like David Hasseloff.  You want to look like a guy trying to look like you.  Yes.  And so I will probably wear a David Hasseloff mask, and people would say, I have him, and 
[00:22:30]  they will say to me, no, that can't be Hasseloff, because he wouldn't wear his own mask.  No ass would wear his own mask.  No ass, yes.  And so I'm going to wear a David Hasseloff mask, and I'm going to go out as David Hasseloff,  and no one will recognize me.  Now, what exactly is it you're promoting, just to get the plug out there so people know?  Right now, I'm actually promoting 15minutesnow.com.  15minutesnow.com.  15minutesnow.com.  And what that is, is a Hoffnose talent. 
[00:23:00]  If you go to 15minutesnow.com, instead of going America's Got Talent, Britain's Got Talent,  anybody can compete, and it's all online.  And it's just started last week, and we're going to do 40 weeks.  Oh, wow.  And you can do, sing in the shower, you can play rock and roll, you can have a dancing  dog.  Do jokes or something, right, too?  Anything.  And I'm also down here promoting Knight Rider from Hot Wheels.  Right.  They have a Hot Wheels edition.  And 20 years ago, I did a, like 30 years ago, I did a commercial in German for them. 
[00:23:30]  Ich habe euch den Mägen von Aktion Mittebrach.  Hot Wheels von Mattel.  I can't believe I still remember it.  Yeah, it sounds harsh.  Yes, it was harsh.  We sold no Hot Wheels, but we had fun.  Yeah, it's always the best pornography.  But 15minutes.com is really cool.  It's like, really tell your listeners to go.  If you have any crazy song, any act you want to do, it's like anything goes.  And anything goes, and you submit it, and then people vote for it, so your family can 
[00:24:00]  vote for it, and at the end, we come back one year later to the Comic-Con convention.  Oh, cool.  And then we do a huge promotion and a video, and whatever that act is gets signed to a  record label or wherever.  Oh, that's great.  Yes, cool.  Well, thanks for talking to us, man.  All right, man, God bless you.  Good luck.  Take care.  Thank you.  Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  What the fuck is this lady's Darth Vader hat?  Let's go talk to her.  Holy shit. 
[00:24:30]  Hi, can we talk to you for YouTube?  That's a cool outfit.  Thank you.  Hi.  A cool Darth Vader hat.  Is that heavy or something?  It's an R2-D2 Hello Kitty hat, and no, it's pretty light.  It's made out of papier-mâché.  Paper-mâché?  Paper-mâché.  Looks like a giant toilet or something.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, you could use it in a zombie apocalypse kind of situation.  Yeah, if you had to drop a deuce or something.  Yeah, you know, it'd be great for it.  It's kind of sturdy, light, you know, carrying around.  You could just poop it and throw it on people. 
[00:25:00]  It'd be great.  So, what's your character's name?  I'm R2 Kitty 2.  R2 Kitty 2?  Yeah.  That's like R2-D2, but a cat or something?  Yeah.  Exactly that.  Can I touch your hat?  Yes.  That's kind of cool.  Did you make that yourself, or did you buy that?  No, I made it myself.  Those are really cool gloves.  It's like when you go to the doctor and they put that on, you know you're in trouble.  Get up there, you know.  Uh-huh.  And sometimes you pretend it hurts more than it does, just to get him.  It doesn't really, you know.  Yeah.  I like you.  Where's your boyfriend? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, he's walking around here somewhere.  Shit.  I gotta go before he gets mad.  I thought I was gonna get that, too.  God damn it.  I can't get no puss here.  Jim and Sam's Carly Karate Dead Shirt 2012.  We guilted our pal CM Punk into talking to us.  He just wants to go and relax, and here he is. 
[00:26:00]  Thanks, man.  No problem.  How are you?  Good.  Are you promoting the same thing these guys are?  Like, do you have an action figure out?  I don't know if I have one out.  I just know that Mattel puts out WWE action figures.  So I'm here.  I did a signing.  I did a panel.  And I don't know.  So there's a billion action figures in me out already.  I asked Seamus this question.  Now, do you ever see one that you didn't like the way it looked?  Well, they all look kind of weird to me, you know.  The tattoos is what bothers me.  Like, sometimes Mattel's really good at getting the detail and the accuracy. 
[00:26:30]  There's been some other toys I've seen of mine that the tattoos are...  I don't know what they are.  They'll just be like a red splotch or like a blue triangle, you know.  I mean, it's probably hard to do, so I shouldn't complain about it.  No, but they should get it right.  I was just watching you eat, too.  I'm, like, amazed at what a big breakfast you just had.  What did you just have?  It wasn't that big.  It was just a bunch of eggs.  It was three eggs sunny side up.  It was three eggs sunny side up and probably a three-egg omelet with vegetables.  So you just ate six eggs?  I just ate six eggs.  Is that like a normal for a guy who works out a lot? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, that's a snack.  Now, what will you do?  You go to the gym today?  Will you take a day off?  I had a day off yesterday, and I ate like a filthy pig.  I ate like you, I'd imagine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So there was a tranny involved.  That's every day.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to make it to the gym today.  I'm going to try to walk the floor here at the Comic-Con, and that's probably a workout  in itself.  Well, the way you dress, like, you dress in, like, a baggy hoodie, and you just seem like  a regular dude, and it's like, I forget that, like, oh, yeah, you're the WWE champion. 
[00:27:30]  Like, you're a...  Yeah, but it's harder and harder every day for me to dress incognito.  Like, I mean, this is me, like, every day.  You know, I don't, you know, you'll see guys like Sheamus wearing a suit, and some guys wear  designer jeans, and I wear a pair of camo shorts and, you know, a hoodie, and no underwear.  Oh, perfect.  That was my next question.  I don't know where to go from here.  So what are you going to do now?  Do you just kind of walk around and just look at chicks and just walk around and watch all the  costumes, or...?  Absolutely.  That was me trying to just be a guy, though, by the way. 
[00:28:00]  I said, look at chicks.  My favorite moment from last year's Comic-Con, which I'm hoping to top this year, I saw a  guy dressed as...  I saw Fat Flash on a Segway.  How great is that?  So there's a lot wrong with that.  Number one, Flash is not fat.  Right.  But I can forgive that.  Why was he on a Segway?  It's just somebody, you know, palling around.  He's having a good time.  But yeah, Flash was on a Segway.  Was it one of those obesity Segways, or was it just to get around faster?  He was just lazy.  Oh, really?  One of those guys?  Yeah, just pure, just lazy, fat.  Lazy, fat Flash on a Segway.  Now, how much time do you have before you have to fight again? 
[00:28:30]  What day is today?  Today is Friday.  Is it?  Is today Friday?  Thursday?  It's Thursday, isn't it?  Is today Thursday?  I don't know.  Is today Thursday?  No.  Clearly.  Today's Thursday.  It is Thursday.  Wow.  Jesus.  Neither one of us know that.  It's Thursday.  I got tomorrow off, and then I'll be in Tucson Saturday.  And then Sunday is Phoenix.  Monday is Las Vegas.  Now, do you get to fly in the jet with Vince, or how do they have you travel? 
[00:29:00]  We talk to Jericho a lot about traveling arrangements.  I have a bus.  Okay.  I'm like one of those fancy guys now that has a bus, because I traveled for 15 years in  rental cars and planes and everything like that, and I was at my wit's end, and it hurts.  It's not so much getting a crap beat out of you on a nightly basis that kills you.  It's getting a crap beat out of you, and then sitting in a plane or a car for five hours.  That'll mess you up.  I've been on the jet plenty of times with Vince, though.  That's always a fun ride.  So now buses.  Sam was telling me about some of you guys have buses, and was that a new thing that they're 
[00:29:30]  doing?  It's nothing to do with them.  It's not like a company thing.  It's the individual.  Oh, you guys are just doing it.  Yeah.  It's not cheap, but it's worth it, because your cost of ... I mean, the quality of life  is the word I'm looking for.  Your quality of life goes up.  I got a bus driver.  I lease a bus, and it beats driving yourself and trying to find hotels and stuff like that.  So you guys get treated like comics in a weird way.  It's almost like they pay you whatever they pay you, and then they give you a travel buyout, 
[00:30:00]  and then it's like, fuck you.  We'll see that.  Yeah, absolutely.  And we don't care.  Don't let the door hit you on the way out.  Just show up at this time and perform, and then ...  But they don't reimburse you for that.  I mean, it's a write-off.  Yeah, it is a write-off, but you figure that some of the bigger guys, they should ...  They should take care of some of the bigger guys.  Oh, we get perks, you know.  Can't talk about them here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it involves trannies.  Oh, of course.  That's a good perk for anybody.  So what do you do, sleep on the bus?  I sleep on the bus, yeah.  And so what do you do in your downtime? 
[00:30:30]  Like, we were talking before about fighting and how day of fight, you're fairly unapproachable  because you're ready to just get this over with, in a way.  Yeah.  Just have this match.  So what do I do in my downtime?  Yeah, like day of the fight, what do you do when you ...  I'm always amazed by fighters, what do you guys do?  What do you do when you wake up that day?  The day of a ... I'll say the day of like a big match.  I mean, I try to keep it as normal as possible, but I stretch a lot, and if there's time, I'll  go to a gym.  Oh, you will work out on it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  But more often than not, there's no time for that.  So it's just ... It's a lot of stretching.  But I'm a runner, too.  Like, I like to run long distances, so a lot of times it's pretty easy to throw a pair  of shorts on and shoes and like headphones and just go run.  I have a pretty big problem with my sciatic, I think.  I had a massage therapist recently digging a knuckle into my right ass cheek, and it  helped a lot.  No, no, no, no.  They missed it.  They missed it.  They hit right in the middle, actually.  No, this was in the right cheek, and I'm trying to get my ... My leg is numb all the time.  I don't know what that means.  Really?  Well, that's not good. 
[00:31:30]  That's not good, right?  I don't know what it means either, because I'm not a doctor, but I think you should  maybe ... Maybe massage isn't the answer.  Is that a sign of desperation that I'm just asking athletes now, like, what's wrong with  me medically?  No, because you never know.  We're half-assed doctors.  We're half-assed chiropractors.  We're half-assed masseuses, half-assed magicians.  We're the jack of all trades, master of none.  So now, do you know in advance ... Do you know how much longer your run is going to be,  or you have no idea how much longer it's going to be?  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  We talk about stuff, but nothing's ever concrete.  Do you ever not agree with where they want to go, storyline-wise?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  All the time.  I think that's another thing that separates top guys like me and Sina from some other guys.  We won't ... I mean, Sina never says no to anything.  I never say no to anything, but we have input.  We can have a conversation about where the direction is going, instead of just being like,  okay, this is what I'm doing.  Yes.  Or most guys are told.  Yeah, and if they agree or disagree, whatever, they just, okay, that's what I'm doing. 
[00:32:30]  But it's not ... I don't want anybody to get it twisted.  It's not arguing.  It's just a conversation.  It's like, okay, that's a good idea.  What if we did it this way?  Has Vince ever yelled at you?  Yelled at me?  He's a pretty scary dude.  He's very parental sometimes.  Okay.  He likes to try to develop like almost a father-son relationship with certain guys.  And it's interesting sometimes, yeah.  Because to work with ... to do what he does or what Dana White does in the UFC, which is 
[00:33:00]  basically, you're the boss of a room full of alpha males.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys are all fucking alpha males.  And you have to respect him to a certain degree to listen to him.  So I'm like, how does he handle that?  Does he yell and scream?  Or like you said, is he parental?  What is his attitude with most guys?  No, he doesn't yell and scream.  He's only yelled and screamed at me one time, but it was in jest.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It wasn't like I did anything bad.  There's been plenty of times where I've done stuff where I'm like, oh, man.  I'm shocked he hasn't flipped out and yelled and screamed at me. 
[00:33:30]  You know, he's an alpha male himself.  So there's always just a mutual level of respect.  So, you know, he's ... I mean, he's something else.  Just like Dana White is.  Right.  Like you said.  I mean, I wouldn't want their job.  No.  And he will scream at guys.  And it's amazing to me.  I guess there is the barrier there of employee and employer.  But still, you're always afraid a guy's not going to see that barrier.  Like it happened to Vince that one time when the guy fucking popped him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it could happen at any time.  And I'm surprised Dana hasn't been punched in the face yet.  I'm sure it's coming.  But it probably won't be from a high-level fighter. 
[00:34:00]  It'll just be from some fucking, you know, some nobody that he boots, some middleweight.  We were talking about Twitter before.  And do you think about your tweets before you send them?  Because I follow you on Twitter.  And do you ever think like, all right, this might get me in trouble?  Or do you not worry and just kind of let it happen?  Let the chips, what's that, fall when they may?  I think it's pretty evident that I don't think.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think it out.  But yeah, there's been a few instances where I get into trouble and the office calls me  and they maybe tell me.  I don't know if you noticed this either.  On the show, like live on Raw or anything like that, when anybody else comes out, 
[00:34:30]  they'll put their Twitter handle like under their name.  They never put mine.  They do not.  That's funny.  They don't put mine on there.  They almost want to discourage people from finding out that I have a Twitter, you know,  because they can't shut me up.  It's nice though, isn't it?  I mean, it's a really, I think our generation or these people now are getting used to immediate  interaction with fans that everybody can see.  It's so fascinating to me.  Yeah.  I mean, it's out there and once it's out there, it's out there permanently.  It's out there forever.  I had a recently, like the lovely wrestling dirt sheet websites reported that like I tweeted 
[00:35:00]  something negative about the company and then I took it down right away.  And I, you know, and there's always somebody saying that they were hacked, like some drunk,  you know, somebody gets drunk and tweets something like, oh, I was hacked.  And it's always a bunch of BS.  But I, there's apparently a website where you can generate phony tweets.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, so somebody tweeted something like that and the news dirt sheets, like picked it up 
[00:35:30]  like it was actually a news story.  And yeah, I, I almost got in trouble for that, which is awesome.  So how did they find out that you didn't do it?  Because they can trace it back to your phone or do IP checks.  Right, yeah.  They just realized it didn't come from, uh, from my phone.  It wasn't like on anybody's timeline that actually followed me.  And, uh, there's no, there's no like blue, what is it?  The check?  Like the Twitter?  Oh yeah, verified, right.  Yeah, the verified thing.  That's what I was, yeah.  I actually had to take a picture of myself with my face over my toilet, holding a verified  sign to guilt them into verifying me.  Dane Cook actually got me verified. 
[00:36:00]  They wouldn't do it.  That's amazing.  Yeah, it's humiliating on some level too that I had to go.  Yeah, it sounds like something that you'd be into.  The toilet?  A toilet, a camera.  Big time.  No offense.  Now, uh, so you're very careful.  It's really hard to not just respond angrily at people.  Yes, yes, because there's nobody on Twitter that's just like, hey, just wanted to say  I appreciate you.  It's, uh, you're fat.  Uh, you know, I saw, you know, I mean, it's just, it's just brutal.  Look at you, you know what I get a lot?  Look at your, your crow's feet.  You, you, you old, ugly bastard, you know? 
[00:36:30]  And I'm just like, ah, geez.  And it's amazing how, like, uh, we talked before about Stoudemire and how even in a  private message to somebody, that guy makes it public or blogs about it, and then all  of a sudden people come after the athlete.  It's like he's saying something privately to somebody and you can't even do that anymore.  Well, and, and that's the other thing.  You ruin it for everybody else because there's fans out there that just kind of want to converse  with you, and, but then there's the, the other fans that beg for RTs and, and just  to be noticed and, uh, you know, I don't, truthfully, I don't really care if it's your  birthday, you know?  Like, but, and I don't know why, I don't know why just because I'm in the public eye 
[00:37:00]  I'm supposed to, you know?  Like, I barely care when it's my sister's birthday.  Much less the stranger, you know what I mean?  Yeah, so it's just, you know, I, I live by the sword and I die by the sword.  I don't expect anybody to give a damn about my birthday.  It's, it's, it's a two-way street.  Well, I love you, man.  I think you're great and, uh, I'm happy to see you and, uh, we didn't think we were  going to get to talk to you, so thanks for talking to us.  I'm thrilled, I'm thrilled I ran into you, man.  Oh.  No, thank you.  Oh, look at this guy.  He's so cute.  He's so cute, and if anybody says anything negative about him, I'm going to punch you 
[00:37:30]  in the face.  Thank you.  That's right.  You know how upset that just made, Sam?  You didn't like that we just hugged, did you?  No, I like it when people like you.  Thanks.  That was nice.  Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  Excuse me, Mr. Bumblebee?  We're talking to people for Chippit TV on the YouTubes.  Would you talk to us?  We're interviewing people in costumes.  I'm not Mr. Bumblebee.  Oh, I'm sorry, what's your name?  Come here close, you're going to knock everybody over, they're going to get paralyzed.  Stupid.  What's your name?  I'm Henchman21 from the Venture Brothers. 
[00:38:00]  What's Henchman21?  I'm the Monarch's Henchman.  What does that do?  I don't know anything about that.  Oh, you know what henchmen are, right?  I don't know what henchmen are.  Well, Minions, that the Monarch, he's like our big boss leader.  Millions are what?  What?  Millions, you said?  I'm sorry.  They're Minions.  Oh.  Minions.  Do you sting people?  Yes.  And yes.  What's your superpowers?  Um, nothing.  I just have a high tolerance for pain, so I get beat up a lot and people get... 
[00:38:30]  I did tell her when I was a kid, my mother's friends would always hit me.  She'd say, Chipper, stop talking in there.  Me too.  Are you a good guy or a bad guy?  Bad guy.  Bad guy?  Yeah.  What do you do at Comical Cons?  What?  What do you do when you're here?  I cosplay, I go to panels, I watch movies.  I'm just relaxing.  Me too.  Are you supposed to wear your mask?  Yeah, but I can't see, though. 
[00:39:00]  How come they don't put eye holes in it?  That don't make no sense.  I can do this.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  I'd be fucking stinging people all day if I had that outfit.  Well, I've been, like, checking people with my wings left and right the whole day.  Fuck yeah, knock them over.  I've seen this guy in a fucking wheelchair before I want to tip him over.  Oh, that's, really?  Fuck him.  Well, someone probably does. 
[00:39:30]  Alright, let's say talking to you.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you very much.  Kim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012.  Oh, we're on.  Okay.  Hi, Anthony Bourdain.  What is your name, sir?  Joel Rose.  Hi, Joel.  What do you do?  I'm a writer.  Oh, you did this graphic novel.  Okay, cool.  They didn't tell me who else I was talking to.  Thank you guys for talking to me today.  We're talking about MMA.  I didn't know that your wife trains.  Yeah, my wife trains.  I mean, you know, seriously, psycho, UFC fan, Muay Thai practitioner for about five years, 
[00:40:00]  and MMA, but seriously gotten into Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  She trains at Henzo Gracie Academy every day, six days a week, for about three hours a day.  Do you take it?  Do I?  Take jiu-jitsu at all?  No, hell no.  And she's not practicing on me either.  I get these licks from her, like, whenever she gives me these sort of adoring looks,  like, let me give you a hug.  I'm thinking, you're naked, choking a triangle.  You know, we have a grappling dummy for that. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, you have one in the house?  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Six-foot heavy bag, grappling dummy.  You know, this probably tells you more about my life than I should be.  Well, no, it's not surprising to me, though, because we had you on O&A, and it's pronounced  gyro, right?  Get gyro or is it gyro?  Gyro.  And it's a tremendously different graphic novel, which, by the way, congratulations on hitting  number one.  Thank you.  That's unbelievable.  You're a number one New York Times bestseller.  Unbelievable.  How do you feel?  We couldn't believe it.  We just heard it last night. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It just blew us away.  Is there going to be a follow-up to this?  Like, you know, books have a softcover edition coming out.  Is that what happens with graphic novels?  Yeah.  There'll definitely be a paperback, too.  Which is, like, a little bit extra material or something?  I don't think there's going to be extra material.  It'll be just what it is, but just in a paperback format, I think.  But we've just been talking about doing either something again.  So you'll have, but you'll also be able to put New York Times, the number one bestseller  on it.  Hell yeah.  I'm having that tattooed on my forehead. 
[00:41:30]  Just talking about getting t-shirts.  You should, man.  That's phenomenal.  It really is.  I mean, number one on the Times bestseller list.  And somebody outside pointed out that there was no, this is not like a comic book thing.  I mean, there's no reason that Anthony Bourdain should have a number one graphic.  It really is fantastic.  I can't be happier because for me, you know, people, you know, it's a labor of love.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  This was a labor of love.  As a long time, you know, I grew up as a comics nerd, a super fan, then a collector, 
[00:42:00]  and then a wannabe comic artist.  You know, my dream is, you know, coming true late in life, but true just the same.  I mean, I'm just so happy about it.  And the artwork in this book is so awesome.  Yeah, it's great.  But I'm just bursting with pride at how good this book looks.  So you did a bunch of signings?  Did you show up and everybody had your book online?  Not yet.  Oh, you haven't yet?  We have to do this evening and tomorrow.  We're doing some signings.  So you hit number one without doing signings? 
[00:42:30]  It just came out.  It just came out last week.  But you know how fucking hard that is to do no signing?  Because signings are supposed to promote the book, and then you have a certain amount  of independent bookstores involved.  That's amazing to hit that without signing.  You can't get this book anywhere.  The bookstores are sold out, all the independents.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you're going to do signings tonight at Comic-Con?  Yes.  We don't know what we're signing, though.  What's that?  We don't know what we're signing.  Will they have books to bring or no?  Body parts and tickets, you know, whatever. 
[00:43:00]  Well, it won't be the first time.  Yeah, you've signed tits before, right?  Yeah, but let me remind you what my wife does six hours a day.  So really, no more tits.  Yeah, back in the old days, you signed tits.  You know, lower arm, upper arm, I'm already in the danger zone.  Yeah, I'll sign your wrist and then no higher.  Now, did you enjoy the fight?  Because I saw your Twitter.  I didn't realize that you were even at the fight.  Yeah, I was right there.  We're ringside.  I mean, like I said, my wife's a super fan. 
[00:43:30]  Let there be no controversy over the Sonnen.  Did they stop the fight too soon?  He was donezo.  And, you know, he's got a big mouth, this guy.  There was no shaking of the head.  What the hell happened there?  Wait a minute.  Unfair.  No, he was done.  In my mind, he was done before he got hit hard.  I was really worried first round.  Yeah.  Silva fan.  Okay, he wasn't getting hurt on the ground, but it was not a promising beginning. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  I figure if a few more rounds like this, those elbows are going to start landing.  But he was just completely dismantled in seconds in the second round.  And I think the ref, as one should in UFC, I think the reffing was aggressive and correct.  Well, I think because of their animosity, too.  And Chael, if you saw the press conference, he didn't cry about it.  He didn't cry about the knee.  People were like, well, was the knee legal?  He's like, ah, you know, I don't believe in that.  If you watch it in slow motion, it was chest.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  You know, we got a little thigh, maybe, but no, there was no wailing and griping afterwards.  No.  It was a fair fight.  It was a shocking and fast victory.  I sat behind Chael's mother.  We were sitting right behind his mother and a girl.  I don't know if it was a relative of his.  She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life.  And she was not happy with the results.  She was very sad.  So I'm assuming it might have been a chick that he dated.  I don't know.  I didn't want to ask her because I think his brother was there.  Look, it's not like this guy's got to worry about his career. 
[00:45:00]  He's a great, he's clearly a great fighter.  Yeah.  So it's not like this is his last crack at the crown.  You'll never see Sonnen Silva 3, though.  I think Anderson Silva wants no part of him.  It's like, for some reason, he got him in the second round.  But for the first five rounds they fought, Chael dominated, even in that last one.  I can't imagine anyone waking up in the morning and saying,  I really like to get in a ring with Chael Sonnen for five rounds,  especially after the first fight where he really was beaten like a rented mule.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  It was fun to watch, right?  I mean, I like Anderson Silva, but it was fun to see a guy cause such damage to such a great fighter  and then lose.  Even though I like Chael, I kind of, to watch Silva beat him was just awesome in that first fight.  It was a nice triangle.  He dominated so, for five, four rounds, he just completely dominated.  And he was on top of him in the last one.  Instead of staying away like I would have, I would have just tap danced away and then  just taken the crown.  He fucking jumped on him again.  That's why UFC's awesome.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, one minute you're master of the universe and the next you're, you know, 
[00:46:00]  you're choked out.  What'd you think about the Forrest Griffin Tito fight when Forrest ran out of the ring?  I was right there.  So I saw Griffin, he ran right by me.  I think he thought he lost the fight.  Right.  I think he was disgusted with himself.  Everybody near me were all saying, dude, you won that fight.  You squeaked that fight on points.  But Tito hurt him bad, hit him hard, the most dramatic moments of the fight.  I was just, listen, I was rooting for Griffin, but I was just really, really happy that Tito  at this point in his career wasn't humiliated, that he fought a great fight, that he went 
[00:46:30]  out on a, if indeed he's going out.  I mean, he looked really good in that fight.  It was a really heroic and dramatic and exciting, pleasing fight.  You know, I'm just, I'm really happy for Tito.  If you're going to lose, that's the way to do it.  Right, right, right.  Go out on your feet, like, you know, with a decision.  And it was a tough fight.  And I was, I'm a UFC fanatic.  I fucking love it.  And we were just hanging out in the back interviewing fighters and I'm just getting gloves signed.  I'm like an eight-year-old at UFC. 
[00:47:00]  It's like, it's like being a kid.  I don't know.  I'm just really fascinated with these guys and they're all nice guys.  Every one of them is a nice dude.  But none of them are dickheads.  Is that the only sport you like or do you go to other sporting events?  I'm a bad baseball fan because I travel so much.  So I can't, you know, keep up with the Yankees.  Yeah, not really much else.  Just UFC, right?  Yeah, that's just about it for me.  You've just endured Jim and Sam's Comic-Con Adventure 2012. 
[00:47:30]  Tune in again next year when we do it all over again.  Or no.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Yeah, not really.
