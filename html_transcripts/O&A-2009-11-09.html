<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed description of a massive hornet's nest, the size of a basketball or watermelon, discovered in the attic of one of the hosts' brother's house.  Audio from a video showing the brother cautiously approaching and even patting the nest, eliciting furious buzzing, was played.  The hosts and callers offered various ludicrous solutions for nest removal, ranging from vacuum cleaners to flamethrowers and gunfire. Personal anecdotes about stinging insect encounters, including one host being stung in the neck while using a porta-potty, were shared.  The discussion expanded to include the life cycle of wasps and hornets and a failed attempt to book a prostitute or porn star to discuss STDs.  The hosts also promoted the hornet's nest video on their YouTube channel and briefly touched upon other news items, including a birthday message for Uncle Paul (Paul Hargis) on a local news channel, featuring a poorly photoshopped picture and inaccurate age, and the Fort Hood shooting. Greg Colby was in the studio with Anthony and Jimmy.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about a listener's brother's hornet's nest, this time described as half the size of a medicine ball. The hosts observed the excitement of sportscasters in the building after the previous day's games before returning to the humorous segment on "Uncle Paul's" birthday announcement and Ted Sheckler's on the local news.  A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a scathing review of "A Righteous Kill," criticizing its poor quality and the actors' perceived lack of effort.  The hosts debated the last good movies of De Niro and Pacino and moved on to a similarly negative review of the "Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" remake, criticizing John Travolta's performance and the overall filmmaking.  This transitioned into a broader critique of modern Hollywood's perceived political correctness and self-censorship, particularly regarding race and ethnicity, using numerous racial slurs and stereotypes in the process. Listeners called in to share their opinions.

The show continued with more discussion on race and its portrayal in movies and media, along with censorship. The hosts criticized a film (unspecified) for being insufficiently racist, and debated the representation of racial issues and the potential for fostering understanding or misunderstanding. This led to a discussion of Sammy Sosa's lighter skin tone, compared to Michael Jackson's, and the pressures on racial identity. A caller discussed racial preferences on Craigslist dating profiles, prompting further conversations about context and implications.  Specific films like *A Time to Kill* and *American History X* were discussed, with a detailed analysis of a scene from *American History X*, dissecting Edward Norton's performance and the use of racial slurs.  A similar analysis of a scene from *Pulp Fiction* involving the n-word followed.  The show also examined SiriusXM's edited version of Everlast's "What It's Like," and one host recounted using a racial slur ("sambo") while ordering a sandwich.  The segment ended with a brief mention of Michael Jackson's *This Is It*.

The next segment focused on a review of Michael Jackson's *This Is It*, along with reviews of *The Fourth Kind* and *Men Who Stare at Goats*.  A lengthy discussion on Fedor Emelianenko’s MMA fight and Sharon Osbourne’s controversial comments about Susan Boyle's appearance followed.  The hosts played clips from various news programs covering the story,  a listener expressed intense dislike for Lionsgate films, and the hosts speculated on the meaning of "diamonds and rust". A viral video of a woman falling off a table was described enthusiastically, and a clip from a children's beauty pageant, referred to as "little whores," was played and discussed. A listener claimed unpixelated nudity was on *Girls Next Door* DVDs, and a call from "Charlie Jingles" recounted a past studio visit.

Finally, the show returned to a discussion of Sharon Osbourne's comments on Susan Boyle, playing a clip from Access Hollywood featuring Billy Bush and Nancy O’Dell. The conversation expanded to a critique of entertainment news shows' focus on celebrities' appearances, using Kirstie Alley as an example. Callers offered varying opinions on Osbourne’s comments.  Upcoming guests Mary Weiland, Rob Halford, and Belladonna were mentioned, with speculation about Belladonna's past.  A rumor about Penny Marshall having a brain tumor was also discussed, later stated as being denied.  The segment, like much of the show, was irreverent and laced with profanity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be in Anthony, are no strangers to scandal.  We'll be in Anthony on satellite radio.  Host Anthony and Camilla and Greg Colby here.  Controversial team.  Good comments.  Affinity list.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony apologizing for yet another raunchy gag.  We'll be in Anthony's show.  We'll be in Anthony.  Who is this the last straw for the raunchy radio duo?  The raunchy radio duo?  Disturbed and deviant.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  It's a history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  That's not shocking.  I love it.  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  The best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  The best of our abilities or a good show?  This is what the show is.  Silly, stupid, whatever you want to call it.  Listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  He was getting something out of the attic. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's a hell of a way to start, huh?  I was showing Anthony and Jimmy the Hornet's Nest video on my YouTube channel, O.P. Radio.  I was at my brother's house yesterday and he goes, I guess we'll start here.  What the fuck? 
[00:02:00]  We have so much to talk about.  But, yeah, rewind it because maybe we'll play the audio of the video on the show today.  I'm at my brother's house.  I went to his son's playoff football game yesterday all the way out there in South Hole.  And I'm hanging out with my brother's guy and his family.  He goes, dude, I found a hornet's nest in the crawl space in my attic.  I'm like, what?  Because, yeah, we were trying to get a mattress out of there.  I lift the mattress up and I see this massive hornet's nest.  Now, you saw the hornet's nest.  How big is it?  It's easily two human heads. 
[00:02:30]  No, it's bigger than a basketball.  It's way bigger than that.  It's bigger than a basketball.  That's a huge nest.  It's the thing, it looks to be like...  I'm trying to explain it.  Yeah.  It's way bigger than a watermelon.  Yeah, a watermelon's a good size.  But it's way bigger than that.  But it's bigger.  It's, uh...  I'm trying to think of an object.  It's something...  There's nothing that size.  Yeah.  There's nothing that's that size.  There should be a smaller nest orbiting it.  Exactly.  It's almost like a...  You know those workout balls at the gym where you do crunches on? 
[00:03:00]  It's almost bigger.  Yeah.  It is.  All right, wait, wait.  Go back.  I'll see where his hand is so I can see it.  I can tell you how big it is.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because then my dumb brother decides...  I jokingly said, why don't you kick it, Scott?  My whole family's crazy.  I think you know that by now.  So he pats it.  He pats it a couple times.  There's him patting the hornet's nest.  Wait, it's not just a perfect circle either, by the way.  Go back a little bit.  It's a fucking...  It's like what you're seeing in the attic.  Like, you're seeing the top half of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you're not seeing the bottom half where all the bees come out. 
[00:03:30]  You're seeing, like, the top half of it.  Oh, yeah.  That's fucking massive.  Oh, yeah.  This goes all the way back to the wall.  And they decided to build the nest incorporating that huge, like, plastic bag.  Like, one of those really heavy plastic bags that might have been around a piece of furniture or something.  They're pretty much incorporating the bag into their nest.  That is fucking...  Dude, that's probably been a couple years.  That's giant.  Oh, easily.  Here, go back.  Let's play the audio.  See if it means anything to anybody.  What do we got today? 
[00:04:00]  We're about to show you the world's largest hornet's nest.  For real?  For real.  All right.  This is your kid's room.  So, it leads to the attic?  Yeah, we're in...  The crawl space right up here?  The crawl space.  Right from his son's room.  Spooky enough, right?  Yeah.  Why would you go near that?  Right.  Call people.  Now, we're moving some boxes, obviously.  Now, we're getting on our hands and knees because it's kind of in the corner here.  Yeah, it's part of the roof where you've got to kind of crawl.  Oh, crap.  It's very warm.  It's nasty.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, God.  I'll give you $100 to kick it.  I'm in.  For real?  He's got four kids, by the way, this idiot.  There's a flashlight on it now.  It's fucking mad.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  What is he doing now?  Are you buzzing?  They're buzzing.  Out.  Out.  Out.  And now they run out of the fucking area.  Carson, you're on.  Come on, come on.  Out.  Are you kidding? 
[00:05:00]  No.  Wow.  Dude, that looked like something from Alien.  That looked like something from Alien.  That was a giant...  You know what?  Because if you go on YouTube, you see Big Hornet's Nest.  I've seen some giant ones.  That's probably the biggest one I've seen.  I'm promoting this as the world's largest hornet's nest, so if you want to help me out, I'll take it.  Here's what it looks like.  It looks like an apocalypto.  You guys see apocalypto?  Yeah.  Ah.  When he's walking with that hornet's nest in a leaf.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If anyone has seen that scene, that's what it looks like.  That's the size of that hornet's nest. 
[00:05:30]  It's brutal with that thing.  That's a giant fucking hornet's nest.  Where did they come out?  Where was their entrance?  Where's that?  Well, right on the other side of that is the roof.  Yeah.  And it's not insulated, so they're coming up under the eave of the roof, thank you, and coming in that way.  I go, stupid me.  My brother knows a little bit about everything.  He really does.  He would probably give Anthony a run for his money with stuff like that.  And I go, why don't we just plug up the main hole and let's get this fucking thing out of here.  He goes, dude, they got escape routes everywhere.  And as soon as they know their main hole is plugged up, oh, boy, do they get fucking pissed. 
[00:06:00]  They'll be in trouble.  And what they do is they leave the nest any other way they can and go right to the front to go, who the fuck just plugged up our front?  And then they just go nuts.  So it'll be all over the fucking house.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know how many would come out of there?  Now, what do you do with that?  Well, before I say that, when he was patting it, the camera doesn't pick it up.  When he goes, do you hear that?  You hear this massive buzzing coming from inside the fucking thing.  And that's when he said, get the fuck out, get the fuck out. 
[00:06:30]  Because even he realized, oh, my God, maybe I shouldn't have done that.  He shouldn't have patted it.  So my brother doesn't make a lot of money.  I go, well, let's call an exterminator right now.  He goes, I'm going to do it myself.  I can't afford to.  No, no, you die.  He can't afford to.  Certain things you don't fucking do on a budget.  Removing 40,000 bees from your house is one of them.  He goes, I can't afford to.  So I'm like, no, I mean, Anne understands this world.  I'm like, all right, I guess I got to pay for an exterminator now. 
[00:07:00]  But now I'm thinking that we should be making a follow-up video.  Hell yes.  Please.  You have to tape this.  This is fucking massive.  I want to know how they go about getting this out of there.  The problem is, if it's outside, you can fuck with it.  What are you going to do?  You get in your bee suit and you hit it with a fucking broom and you set it on fire or something.  This is in the house.  How do you get it out of the house?  Yeah, when you see the video, it's tucked deep into a corner with an angled roof. 
[00:07:30]  So it's not as easy as hoping to scoop it up real fast.  No way.  I'm sure it's attached to the floor pretty good, too.  That thing is anchored down.  Because they use their, what, saliva and spit and shit to make it pretty much into a cement.  Dude, that's how it got so big because it's protected by his house.  Yeah.  So these fucking things all year, like in the winter, they do whatever they do.  They sleep, but the mess is not being destroyed.  What a wonderful fucking place they have.  It's heated.  They're squatters.  They're like, oh, this is great.  Your brother has fucking tenants in the house.  My brother explained another hornet's nest that he had on his property. 
[00:08:00]  He lives way out east, so he's got a little land and stuff.  He's like adjacent to his farmland and whatnot.  So he explained one that was hanging from a tree.  And then listen to what this motherfucker did.  He can't get to the, oh, Jesus.  He can't get to the hornet's nest, so he's chopping branches to kind of get at it.  Yeah.  So he would chop a few and then run away.  Go, okay.  You can't do that.  He's like, okay, they're not moving.  Then clipping a few more branches. 
[00:08:30]  Okay, then I'll move until he can totally get at the hornet's nest.  And then this sick fuck.  He is pretty, he's sick.  He gets a garbage pail, puts it under the hornet's nest like a cartoon, I swear to God.  And then goes, takes a deep breath, runs, clips.  The thing goes and falls perfectly into the garbage pail.  Then he, boom, puts the lid on it.  Get out of here.  That shouldn't work.  That should have ended in disaster.  That should end with them going, where is he?  And an hour later, he's found with hedge clippers tripping over the ladder and bees on him. 
[00:09:00]  Just a giant welt.  God bless him for, you know, figuring it out, though.  That's good.  Dude, that's one, you can't, Perlberg, uh, solution.  I filmed some more stuff, but I'm going back over there when we figure out how to get it out of there.  Even if it's with exterminators, I'll film the whole fucking process.  I want to know how an exterminator even does it, like a professional, because he's in the fucking house.  What you've got to do is he'll have to cover it with plastic or something from the inside.  He'll completely encase the area inside the house so that covers the escape route. 
[00:09:30]  And then smoke it.  He'll fucking smoke it from the outside and maybe even smoke it from this direction.  Put them to sleep and then probably shoot poison into the nest.  Oh, fucking no.  Who does that for a living?  Ted's Bee Removal Emporium, I'm sure.  Oh, no, I would actually just take my foot and put it right through and stomp them out individually.  That's dangerous.  Yeah, I have metal shoes.  Well, Ted, I mean, the comments on the YouTube video are just that. 
[00:10:00]  People doing their kinkus.  So, I don't know.  I mean, that's where we're at with this fucking hornet's nest.  We've got to figure out how to get it out of there.  Definitely got to tape it, though.  Oh, yeah, I will.  So we can see.  God damn, man.  That's fucking...  When he tapped...  Biggest one I've ever seen.  When he tapped at it and you heard...  And I'm so bummed that the HD flip didn't pick it up.  You hear this fucking noise from inside.  Just...  And they're just rocking.  Because they're, you know...  No one's ever done that!  Yeah, right.  They're like, what is that noise?  What the fuck is that?  No one's tapped them? 
[00:10:30]  No.  A couple more...  A couple more pats and I think we could have had a major freaking problem.  Dude, I guarantee your son came out after that.  Oh, I'm sure.  Investigating.  That's why my brother goes out, out, everyone out.  How did he know it wasn't going to crack open a little bit when he tapped it?  Like, because he patted it pretty hard.  Even though my brother has four kids, he's just like me.  We're just idiots.  You've got to poke him.  Is he the one that works with animals?  Yeah, he's the marine biologist, by the way.  Oh, well.  Yeah, so...  I mean, these are airborne, though.  They're not...  Yeah, if that was a fucking porpoise, he'd be fine. 
[00:11:00]  He'd know exactly what to do.  Right.  A fucking whale was in his attic.  But before he walks in there with a fucking fishing rod and he's so out of touch with things  not in the ocean, he's trying to work at you.  There's some guy in a beekeeper costume on a boat somewhere.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know how we're going to do this, but...  And then his son...  God, it's huge.  I go, I ask his son, because, I mean, this is right on the other side of the wall where  my nephew sleeps.  And he admits, he goes, yeah, every once in a while, there's a hornet in my room. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Not a lot, but, you know, one or two also.  Yeah, a stray.  One or two?  Yeah.  I'd see that once.  And then we'd get rid of it or I'd move.  Move.  And who's an expert on bees?  I am.  It's called...  It's called a white...  How do they do it?  White something hornet.  White...  Supremacist?  White something hornet.  Wow, I don't know.  I don't know how evil those are, but...  Can you look it up?  Just a white hornet?  Oh, my God.  Bald-faced...  What?  A white-faced... 
[00:12:00]  I think they call it a white-faced, right?  A white-faced hornet.  Oh, it's a bald-faced or a white-faced hornet.  Same thing.  Right.  Let's go to Wikipedia, Sam.  Let's take a look and see what they have.  It's frightening looking.  It really is.  Because that isn't a regular bee.  That's...  Oh, my God.  That's a machine.  That's a machine.  That's a...  That's a chomping machine.  Look at it.  It's actually a yellow jacket.  And they say it's more...  They say...  If it's a white-faced hornet or a bald-faced hornet, it's not a true hornet.  It belongs in the genre of...  This makes it no better, by the way. 
[00:12:30]  A wasp's called yellow jacket.  It's more of a yellow jacket.  Right.  Yes.  Oh, Jimmy, by the way, I did...  You know, I got stung.  Yeah, see?  Do you get stung?  Yeah, I got stung yesterday.  Jesus Christ.  I was just messing with bees and yellow jackets all day yesterday.  You know...  My neck is killing me, and it's really swollen.  Did you really get stung?  Yeah, I swear to God.  Doing what?  Huh?  Doing what?  Well, it's actually not...  It's a separate story from that at the football game.  At my brother's son's football game, I'm waiting to get into the port-a-potty, and there's 
[00:13:00]  a father and son in front of me.  Then they go, hey, this port-a-potty over to the right is open, but the kids won't go  in there because there's a bee in there.  I'm like, really?  All right.  I go, I'll check it out.  So I open the door, and I see a ladybug.  So I look back to everyone.  I'm like, it's a stupid ladybug, and they start laughing, and then someone goes, oh,  I figure kids would think that's a bee.  I'm like, yeah.  And I close the door.  I see the bee up above my head in the port-a-potty, and like my brother said later, now you understand 
[00:13:30]  what a bee line is.  This thing saw me.  It felt threatened, and it went right at me, straight line, and fucking nailed me in the  neck.  And I jump out like a little sissy, like screaming.  And the father goes, holy shit, I just saw that.  He saw the whole thing just come right at me and sting me in the neck.  And then we go back to my brother's house, and he goes, hey, speaking of bees, you want  to see your horn's nest?  No.  I haven't gotten stung in maybe 30, 34 years, 35 years.  That's what I was saying yesterday.  I don't know the last time I was stung, and guess what?  I don't want to be stung any time soon, because it fucking sucks. 
[00:14:00]  What, do you want to myself?  Don't jinx yourself.  Oh, I think you should jinx yourself.  Oh, no, no.  We should bring some bees in here, and we'll all get stung.  Oh, you remember when we had the bees in here for that, for the wasp stinging the guy's  nuts contest?  Greatest bit ever.  I dressed in a beekeeper's outfit and just would not fucking take it off.  I'm petrified.  Tracy Morgan has not been back since.  No.  That was the show that he said, fuck you guys.  We scared him away with bees.  And I'm a very allergic boy, so as soon as I got stung, I'm like, here we go.  And my whole neck swelled up, but I'm fine, obviously. 
[00:14:30]  I'm very surprised, because you do have a lot of allergies.  That should be like a grapefruit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Back in your neck.  Now everyone's, do you want to go and talk about horns for a little while?  Fuck, dude, people could talk about bees all day.  All right, let's go to Jake.  Everyone likes talking about bees.  Now everyone's going to tell me how to get rid of this fucking thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  White-faced hornets.  Kevin from Connecticut goes, white-faced hornets are faggots.  So now that I know that, me and my brother will just go back there and scoop up the hornet's  desk.  Pick it up and try to run out of the house with it. 
[00:15:00]  You know.  Like a football.  You know how I think, and my brother doesn't think too far behind me.  You know we got to do something crazy to get the hornet's desk out of there.  I'm just trying to figure out how and how to keep it safe.  Like, my sister-in-law already said, you fucking, you guys are sick.  I'm taking all the kids and I'm leaving when you guys decided to get this out.  Dude, they're already fucking in the kids' room.  They probably just explore once in a while.  They're crawling to the door.  If you upset the nest, they're going to fucking come back.  They're going to blame him.  Do you know how hard it would be to get rid of them if they just dispersed entirely around 
[00:15:30]  that house?  Oh, I know.  Dude, you'd have to burn the house down.  I know.  What I'm thinking is a nice snow shovel and a garbage pail.  Let's hope for the best.  What you're going to do if you scoop it is just cut it in half.  Oh, God.  And they'd all just...  You're just going to slice right through it and come pouring out.  Oh, they would fucking be hot under the collar.  Angry.  Oh, they'd not be happy.  Imagine we think it's that easy and, yeah, we're trying to scoop it and we realize it's  just stuck to the floor and now it's just too late. 
[00:16:00]  That was too late.  Yeah, it was too late.  You pull the shovel out and they all come flying out at you.  And then we go, oh, it's not too bad.  I've seen four or five and then they just keep coming and coming and coming.  Jake, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  A few years ago, I was up...  I lived up in Massachusetts and down in my basement for a couple of years, I had been  hearing the scratching sound and the dropped ceiling.  I never thought anything of it, you know, house settling or whatever.  So finally, I'm like, what the hell is that?  So I grab a flashlight, the chair, and I stick my head up there and it's exactly the scene 
[00:16:30]  from Aliens.  There's a six foot long nest by two feet high and it's throbbing.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  I end up having to call three exterminators before I find somebody that's willing to come  out and take care of this.  So he shows up and he's got like this can.  It looks like a can of WD-40 with a little straw sticking out of it.  Yeah.  I'm like, yeah, this ain't going to work. 
[00:17:00]  He goes, no, no, no.  There's two guards that fly back and forth.  Everybody else is oblivious.  As long as I get past them, I can spray the inside and kill them from the inside out.  Wait a minute.  He said a nest has a couple of guards out front that he has to get rid of?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  He just has to slowly make his way by there.  And if he doesn't get stung, they send off a signal.  He's a big bee costume.  That'll work to all the others.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How do you get past, what is he, drive them?  Here's some honey. 
[00:17:30]  You didn't see me.  That's like a lady, baby.  Oh, dude.  Someone's suggesting we get one of your guns.  Oh, yeah.  A few pot shots.  Why not?  That'll at least, you know, get them all disoriented.  Oh, yeah.  And then we could just kill five or six of them.  And then we could just get a net and try to get them all as they come out.  Yeah, as they come out of the hole.  So what happened, dude?  What happened with this fucking bee, this nest?  Well, as soon as he stuck his hand up in the ceiling, I hear, ah!  It stung him immediately.  The guard got him. 
[00:18:00]  But wait a minute.  His hand went up in the ceiling.  How did your head go up there without getting stung?  No, that didn't happen.  Yeah, he got whacked a bunch of times.  But he sticks his hand up there and immediately gets stung.  He moves down a couple of feet, because like I said, this thing is huge.  Tries again, immediately gets stung again.  Holy shit.  So he goes, yeah.  So he's like, all right, it's time for plan B.  He goes out.  He comes back in.  He's got the full beekeeper suit and like this fogger machine. 
[00:18:30]  And he goes, all right, go stay upstairs.  I'll let you know when I'm all set.  Well, hold on.  But when you first saw the nest, you put your head through the drop ceiling, but farther down the line, right?  Yeah, I was about 10 feet away.  I didn't know where I was.  All I heard was the scratching sound.  Oh, wow.  So you could have popped up under the fucking nest by accident and banged your head into it?  Yeah, that would have ended badly.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Surprise.  No kidding.  Some are saying I'm going to end up like Macaulay Culkin and my girl. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, the little lad died.  Poor Macaulay Culkin with his little glasses.  Yeah.  I saw that dumb movie recently.  Did you?  Ugh, depressing.  Why would you watch that?  Why would you watch that?  I know.  Uh, thank you, Jake.  Wait, wait, what happened?  Well, he ends up getting the fogger and all that stuff.  So I'm upstairs and he's down there like an hour fighting with this thing.  And just randomly I'd hear,  They were getting in his suit and stinging him like all over the place. 
[00:19:30]  Who was this idiot you hired?  He didn't tape off or nothing.  So they got in his sleeves and up his car legs and all that stuff.  You know what?  Like any profession, I'm sure these exterminators, there's bad ones too.  Like there's really bad radio guys.  There's bad, I don't know, fucking car salesmen, right?  So you got to think that these guys, there's bad exterminators out there  that just get stung all the time as they're trying to figure out their craft.  So how did he finally get rid of this thing?  Well, eventually he fogged them all out. 
[00:20:00]  And he comes upstairs and he's starting to look a little swollen and lumpy.  And he says, yeah, I need some trash bags.  So I just hand him a whole bag of the big green hefties.  Six full trash bags of nests and bodies to clear that shit out.  So wait, when he smoked them, when you smoke a bunch,  I know it makes them very sleepy and disoriented.  Did he fucking spray poison and kill them then or were they alive?  Yeah, no, he didn't spray smoke.  The smoke works mostly for honeybees.  The bees were mud wasps. 
[00:20:30]  So he just, he sprayed poison.  Like he had a respirator on him.  And like this chemical dust.  So it's not like it only goes out and then hits the ground.  It only stays in the air a few minutes.  He said I could go back into the basement in a couple of hours.  I don't like them at all.  A fucking nest of mud wasps.  Oh my God.  That's why, you know what, that makes sense?  Because he said they fucking stung him immediately.  Honeybees wouldn't sting you immediately.  Oh my, that thing is meant to just sting everything in its path.  That's a child's toy. 
[00:21:00]  Look at that.  That's a fucking horrible monster.  That is a monster.  That would be the hottest fucking Christmas toy.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a transformer.  Huh?  I got one more thing, guys, then I'll go.  I told you I heard a scratching sound.  Yeah.  They make their nests out of mud and what they can find.  They were eating their way through the ceiling tiles to make their nests over the course of about two to three years, the guy said.  Wait, he was trying to get in the house? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, like very sneaky burglars.  Yeah.  Wow.  They figure out where they want this nest and nothing's going to stop them.  Yep.  All right, guys, have a good night.  What a conflict of interest that would have been.  Let me go to CJ in Georgia.  That's so weird looking.  CJ, that's a great design, man.  I think our military should have designed some shit after that.  There's the thorax and then the abdomen are separated by this fucking...  Tail, almost.  ...like a stick.  Yeah.  Like his stinger part, the abdomen is on a stick. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  That comes out of the back of his thorax.  That's amazing.  Do you understand?  We don't know if that's a female or a male.  If that's a female, there's a male that has to fuck that.  What would you do?  How would you...  I've always wondered, how do bees keep their dick hard?  How do you keep an erection to fuck that monster?  And then you slip with some dirty talk.  Next thing you know, you're being stalled by your mate.  It's probably hot to a pig.  It's hot.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at you. 
[00:22:30]  Look at that thorax.  And the collar is like the fucking cool black and yellow.  Dude, I'm telling you, it looks like a sports car.  Or make that into some kind of military fucking aircraft and, you know, with the colors and  everything.  Let's say how does...  Fight in Al-Qaeda with the big bees.  CJ, what do you got, buddy?  Good evening, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  My cousin lives on a dairy farm and he was recently cutting the grass.  Sometimes hornets will build their nests under the ground and he ran over one.  And it was really bad.  You don't have to be allergic to those things. 
[00:23:00]  They stung him so much that if we hadn't have given him Benadryl on the way to the emergency  room, his trachea would have swelled shut and he wouldn't have been able to breathe.  Wow.  How many times...  I got...  How many times did they say he got stung?  I think it was at least 13 or 14 times.  Wow.  But it was all in the upper body around his shoulders and neck.  And Benadryl will actually help you breathe?  Oh, yeah.  On my ace, Nick.  It reduces swelling.  Yeah.  You got to get that shit in there immediately, though.  So, um... 
[00:23:30]  Okay.  Yeah, guys.  Sorry, CJ.  I was just going to say, if you think white-faced hornets are bad, just...  The black-faced ones are punching the face, rape your wife, and steal all your stuff.  So, they're really bad.  Oh, great.  Oh, sir.  Is that true?  Oh, I didn't have to.  I didn't have to.  We kind of go there.  He said, I have one more thing.  He goes, I have one more thing.  Of course.  Thank you, CJ.  Let's go to Mike in Buffalo.  Mike?  Mike?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, buddy.  I'm pretty good, Mike.  I think it would be possible to use a vacuum.  Me and my brother in a vacuum.  Interesting.  As shop vac, right? 
[00:24:00]  And then you just get it in there, and...  Hmm.  No, because here's what will happen.  These two will know what they're doing, and they'll start at one of the exits, and they'll  start...  And a couple bees will go in, and then they'll go...  And they'll pull like a fucking hunk, like the eye out of a pumpkin, and all of a sudden  the nest will be exposed and open.  And the vacuum will be clogged with a big chunk.  Yeah.  And they'll all come flying out at you.  Yeah, and then you'll have to pick the nest out with your finger...  Because you're now shaking the vacuum, trying to get the piece of nest off, and just flinging 
[00:24:30]  bees everywhere.  And then the other end comes off, so the ones you caught come out.  What a disaster.  Yeah.  And the whole bucket full just goes flying out at you.  I might attach like a chain to it, and then just try to...  Or pull it out with a truck?  Yeah, pull it out with a truck, down the stairs of their house.  Boom, hitting every step on the way out.  Do you understand how I would literally...  I would have such a terror of that.  You want to go take a ride?  Absolutely not.  I can't do that.  You can't pat it.  When I was a kid, we used to hunt...  I forgot about this.  We used to...  I was the kid in the neighborhood that would disrupt bees' nests. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And we would always...  We would go after yellow jacket nests and wasp nests, and we would catch them.  And I stopped doing it when I saw my friend Denny running.  There was a yellow jacket...  I mean a massive nest.  And he was running, and he was going...  And he had three yellow jackets.  I'll never forget.  Three.  And this idiot didn't swipe them off.  He was running and crying with three yellow jackets on his forearm.  That voice is hilarious.  It's utter panic.  Dude, there's no... 
[00:25:30]  Well, because as kids, you're like, come on.  Can they...  They're not going to organize.  You always see the yellow jacket nests and stuff, and you have to take...  It looks like pandemonium.  You have to take rocks.  Yeah, they don't look like they can organize shit.  No.  But man, as soon as you hit that nest with a fucking rock, you find out quick, they know  how to organize.  They take them fucking beady eyes and look at you, and that's it.  Meanwhile, you forget they got together and built this house.  Exactly.  That's right.  Yeah, they figured it all out by themselves.  And they built a home.  All the Hornets pictures that Sam is popping up on the internet, because Danny's out today, 
[00:26:00]  come on.  The one we found yesterday is bigger.  Bigger.  I got the world's largest one, I think.  Dude, you should go to YouTube and look at some of them.  Some of the way these...  Are those bees on it?  Yes.  I am heebie-jee-ing out over here.  All right.  This guy...  Is that a honeybee nest?  Let's go to Art in Ohio.  Art?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Art.  Kicker is never mess with any of those bees during the day.  Right.  Because I did it.  I came home from work, and it was about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and I saw bees 
[00:26:30]  going into the corner of my house, and I got some spray and sprayed it.  So a couple hours later, my wife comes home, and she says, what's that noise?  And it sounded like an ultralight.  And we looked up, and there was millions of bees just swarming above the house.  An ultralight.  So I grabbed the kids and took them in the house, and I called the exterminator, and  they said, this was on Friday.  They come out Monday.  And I said, no, we're held captive.  We can't get out of our house.  So they sent a guy out, and I went outside, and I couldn't hear anything.  And there was like a million of them had just clung to the side of the house, and one... 
[00:27:00]  It was just like a big mural, and it was moving.  Wait, dude, how big was the nest?  Well, it was inside the house, up between two floors, so I didn't know.  There was a little hole, see, where they went into the house, but I made the mistake of  spraying the ding-dang thing during the daylight, so they didn't have any place to go.  At night, they're all in there.  So they're on the side of the house, and like I said, there's a brick house, and it's just  like a mural.  It's just like moving like velvet.  It was pulsing.  And the guy comes out in his truck, and he gets a big hose, and he doesn't even have a 
[00:27:30]  bee suit on.  I said, what are you going to do?  He said, I'm going to spray them.  I said, you're going to spray them?  They're going to fly away.  He said, they won't fly away.  He says, they'll stay right here.  And he took this hose, and he was back 20 feet, and sprayed, and I had to go out the  next day, and then I had a whole wheelbarrow full.  I shoveled those things.  Boy, let me ask you a question.  His brother said there's escape routes, so what happens on the ones, if you spray the  outside, didn't they escape into the house?  Well, no.  Why would you own a house?  Get a fucking apartment. 
[00:28:00]  Why are you kidding me?  I don't want to be a homeowner for that reason.  Fucking bees will ruin it.  I just know that will happen to me.  My dream mansion will be, I'll come home, my fucking wife will have bees in her vagina.  It'll wreck everything.  It's better than another letter.  That's true.  They would wreck it worse.  All right.  I'm out.  Hey, good story, brother.  Thank you.  I don't know.  There's way too many calls coming in.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  What am I doing? 
[00:28:30]  Your bee's nest is in my fucking house.  Linger longer.  Dude, turn on.  Sam's got audio called Swarming Hornets Nest.  It's between two windows in a house.  Some jackass starts tapping the window.  Whoa, look at those things.  You hear them?  There is literally probably a hundred of them.  Insane.  That is so cool.  I'm fucking.  Yeah, they're not happy.  I'm really getting the heebie-jeebies. 
[00:29:00]  And they crawl outside the nest.  They patrol the outside of the nest.  Yeah, look at them.  Look at all those bees.  We've got to kill that nest soon.  Oh, that's fucking horrible.  That's saddest.  It's a nest in between two fucking windows.  I thought it was static.  Cell phone static.  But that's an easy one because you see where the nest is.  So you wait until the night and then you just fucking smoke it.  I can hear the buzzing.  Can you?  Relax.  Relax.  It's really not that many bees. 
[00:29:30]  It's a cool video.  It's a small nest.  It's not the shit.  Yeah, the size of a baseball, maybe.  Oh, no, not the bees!  Not the bees!  Ah!  I'm out of my eyes!  My eyes!  Ah!  Ah!  Good old Nick Cage.  Oh, no.  Fucking Nick Cage.  Let's go to Matt in Middletown.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Matt.  Hey.  I was wondering if Ted Sheckler had any experience on these.  Ted already spoke about them. 
[00:30:00]  You might have missed a start.  Ted was talking a little bit about the bee removal thing.  Yes.  Apparently, Ted uses his steel shoes.  Actually, what happens is I have a sword, and I stand under, and I smite them one by one.  You chop their little heads off.  I certainly do.  I slice right through the neck with a sword, and I challenge them.  One F for another, bee head coming off.  How does that work?  Not too well sometimes.  Crazy 88 style, right?  They one F to the other just coming at you?  Yes.  A lot of times, some get through. 
[00:30:30]  What's the name of your bee removal company, Ted?  It's called Ted's Bee Removal Emporium.  I did this one already.  I was hoping that you might have expanded on the name, Ted.  No, I got so much business.  Okay.  Oh, is that?  Oh, it's disgusting.  Bees are fucked, man.  I don't like looking at this.  We're looking at these videos of the bee building a nest.  Wow.  They actually have a cross-section against a window, I guess.  They built the nest against a window, so you could see the inner workings of the nest.  This has to be a science experiment where they fucking, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  They get bees.  And they're like, they're doing their fucking spit thing where they make the little chambers  for their babies.  Let's go to Danny in Ohio.  Danny?  Hey.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  I had a hornet's nest or yellowjacket's nest inside my house.  You could like hear some buzzing and stuff, and you could put your hand on the wall and  feel the heat from the crawly little bathroom.  Holy shit.  Really?  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's so scary, dude.  I was like, oh, I'm like, I'm an idiot, so I was like, fuck this. 
[00:31:30]  I'm doing it myself.  Oh, of course I could afford to pay some hundred bucks to do it professionally, but I just throw  a little hole from inside.  I'd start spraying like every different kind of bug that I forgot.  Some days they would like really be noisy in there.  Other days they'd be calm.  And then one day, it's like fucking, it's quiet and it stinks, dude.  I killed them all and they're like rotting inside my wall of my house.  It smelled like a fucking dead animal.  Jeez.  Sorry, dude, we're distracted.  This is a great video called Three Dumb Asses in a Hornet's Nest.  You know what you're going to get with that video? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, it's not.  Where's the hornet's nest?  Dude, show them the beginning of the video.  It's in the door jam of the car.  This car must have been sitting there for a while.  Look at the bottom of the door.  They opened the door.  Okay, I didn't see this part.  And there's a nest at the bottom of the door jam in the car.  And they think it's a good idea now that they're going to take a swipe at it with a stick.  These three jock-looking guys.  Is there audio on this?  Yeah.  Door hell slow.  And they fucking open it and they swat it with a stick.  Oh, he's got bee spray.  Are you going to hit him? 
[00:32:30]  What fucking...  You guys are back, you asshole.  They're getting ready to poke it down.  And then they run away and they close the door.  So now the fucking bees are in the car.  They are using Ted's method.  Yes.  It's stupid.  Poke it with a stick and run.  Do that 340 times.  Especially if bored and leave.  He is actually trying to use it like a sword. 
[00:33:00]  These guys are just smacking them.  They are incredibly stupid.  Damn.  Unbelievable.  I hope there's a real stingy...  No, they're just dumb.  Like most YouTube videos, there's no...  Don't pay off.  Don't pay off.  Fuck.  What the fuck is that?  These are bees all over the front of another car.  Yeah, you're going to have fun watching bee videos, obviously, on YouTube. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't know that.  Apparently a Swanson just landed on some guy's car in a parking lot.  Yeah, a brand new car.  Those are probably honeybees, though.  That makes it better.  No, honeybees are not...  They'll sting you, though.  If they're threatened, but literally if you just stand there and watch them...  If he was that close to swarming hornets...  Oh, he'd be dead.  Let's go to Stryker.  Stryker!  Hey, morning, boy.  Morning, Stryker.  Actually, with...  My father's an exterminator.  He's been doing it for like 30 years. 
[00:34:00]  With, like, wasps and hornets, you can't really smoke them.  I mean, you can do it to put them to sleep, but you end up poisoning them.  Bees, you can...  Oftentimes, we'll call a beekeeper.  He'll come out, smoke them, put them to sleep, and then take them away.  But we did one of these white-faced hornet jobs.  Occasionally, I'll go and help him.  And we did one this past summer.  I was in the full bee suit.  He was in the full bee suit.  I fell off a six-foot ladder because the fucker got underneath the bee suit. 
[00:34:30]  And when you put it on, you have to wrap it around your legs and duct tape it in place.  And they'll still find any way they can.  And in this case, there was one little spot on the back of the net that goes over my...  The hat in the net goes over my head.  There was one little spot that apparently we missed when we were...  You know, when he was tying it down.  And the whole fucker got up underneath there.  And I got stung like six times.  That fucker was mad at you.  Oh, my dad carries a box of Benadryl and three epinephrine pens in his truck with him 
[00:35:00]  in case he gets stung.  And the first thing he did was I started screaming.  I got stung.  And I jumped off a six-foot ladder to get away from him.  And I'm up there with the little spray can stuff.  Good luck.  You know, initially spraying him.  And the first thing he did was, you know, went out to his truck and got the Benadryl for me.  And he's like, here, just, you know, take this now.  It took five trips over the course of two months to get all these fuckers out of this woman's wall. 
[00:35:30]  And her husband had tried doing it himself and ended up in the hospital because they nailed him so many times.  Well, my brother's, did you see the video of my brother's house?  Not yet.  I haven't.  Because I don't know how the fuck he's going to get it out of there.  It's in a weird place.  I'll tell you, this time of year when it gets cool and if it gets colder, this is when you have to get rid of them. 
[00:36:00]  Yep.  Because they go to sleep.  You know, they're inactive.  And a lot of times it'll kill them off.  But trust me on this.  You know, if you're going to quit the bill or whatever to help your brother, hire a professional to do it.  Because there is a chance them fuckers could wake up while you're messing with them.  Because even though, you know, you heard it yesterday when he was patting them, they started buzzing.  You know, you go messing with that and they're still alive in there.  And you just by chance break that open. 
[00:36:30]  And, well, this could be the Anthony and Jimmy show.  Yeah, it is fucking right.  It is winter.  I didn't even think of that.  It's actually getting to be colder and colder.  It's like 70 yesterday.  They were very active yesterday.  And I need an expert out there to tell me how many hornets they think are in that nest in my video.  I would estimate 30 to 40, Gregory.  But I've been known to be wrong before.  I tend to lowball.  I mean, it's safe to say a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could have a couple hundred thousand in there real easily. 
[00:37:00]  For real?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's a show that was on TLC.  I felt like something was calling me.  What's that?  There was a show called Verminator that was on.  I think it was Discovery or TLC.  And they were showing this one house that they did where they just had to cut, basically,  the whole side wall off of a house to get the damn thing out.  How many bees were in it?  None.  It was one possum. 
[00:37:30]  It was a moth.  Steve from Bayshore says,  Opie's video doesn't show the end where he invites the entire nest to an Islanders game.  Now, the other thing is, you could always invite Steve over there, Steve and some honey over there.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yes, hello.  Well, what do bees do in the winter, man?  Like, it's obvious they're being, the side that's in his brother's house is being kept warm,  so they're not freezing to death.  So what do they do?  Do they all hibernate bees? 
[00:38:00]  No, actually, most of them, well, bees, I think, will hibernate.  If you talk to, like, a regular beekeeper, a lot of times they transport bees to the south to warmer states in the summer,  in the wintertime, and then bring them back, like, to the northern states in the, you know, the northern summer.  But, like, wasps and hornets, most of them die off.  The workers will die off over the winter, and you'll just end up with one or two queens that'll stay alive.  But in this case, where they're in the attic, where they're able to stay warm, 
[00:38:30]  you've got a nice warm wall, probably, they're more likely to, you know,  probably more of them are staying alive inside there.  Do they just stay alive and eat what they have and store it up for the winter and kind of, like, you know,  kind of like, you know, I don't know why I ran out of skin there.  Yes, you know what, I mean, now you're kind of getting away from what I know about them,  but I know, you know, from helping my dad with a lot of these,  and this is the time of year when he goes after some of these that, you know, he'll tell customers, 
[00:39:00]  look, for the most part, they're dead inside there.  You know, you've just got a few that'll stay alive.  It's mostly just the new queen for the next year is what's alive.  But if they have the ability to stay alive during the winter, then, you know,  because they're in a warm environment, then, yeah, they're going to stay alive in there.  I think it's a pretty warm spot.  I'll heat down.  Dude, the fucking heat in the attic, he rises down here.  They're fine.  This is giving me such fucking, I'm having, like, phantom twinges. 
[00:39:30]  My brother was patting the nest yesterday when we were all thinking it was hilarious,  and now I'm like, what the fuck?  I swear, like, I felt something crawling on my back.  I'm getting, like, heebie-jeebie'd out, and I thought I saw something flying around you.  I swear I'm hallucinating.  You know what?  Probably in my fucking jacket.  It's very scary.  I probably brought a few to the studio.  If we get this hornet's nest in one piece, I'm bringing that fucking thing in the studio, though.  I'll tell you that much, and we're going to display it somewhere.  Better be, uh, we'll display it in a corner.  It'll be vacant.  Dude, you're going to have to, you understand that the breakdown of this nest is going to 
[00:40:00]  have to occur in the fucking house.  Yeah.  It's not like it's, uh, equally sticking out the fucking outside, where if you get it,  the whole thing will fall through.  He might have to break open his roof.  Oh, yeah.  Seriously.  In the winter.  I don't know how the fuck he's going to get to that thing.  Dude, the inside of that fucking nest is all in the house, so you can't, you have,  you're going to have to break that open in your house.  And if you're just tuning in, the video's on my YouTube channel, Opio Radio, we're  looking at a pretty fucking big hornet's nest.  Massive hornet's nest.  We still don't know how to describe how big it is. 
[00:40:30]  It looks like you...  Way bigger than a really huge watermelon.  Looks like you shave the top off a head and you're looking at a brain, like that's the  view you have.  Alien egg.  It's really creepy.  Egg from alien.  All right.  That's it.  You want any more of these calls?  Attacked bees while I was in a frat.  Sucked them all out with a shop vac.  Worked on a golf course.  We had to remove hornet's nest.  Do not mess with these bees.  Have been around my house for two years because my kids disturbed the nest.  Bees went nuts when I shot their nest with foam.  Anthony was bleeped on Access Hollywood.  We'll get to that a little later. 
[00:41:00]  Roofer.  Used to burn bees with a propane torch.  Oh, great.  Hit my head on a hornet's nest and I didn't notice until they stung me.  Used to wrap bees' nest in a bag.  Toss it in someone's car and punch bag and run.  And I see truckloads of bees being transported.  That I never understood.  When you see those trucks, you always see bees outside the truck.  Yeah, they just fly around outside the truck.  How is that safe?  What the fuck?  They're fucking honeybees, man.  They don't bother you.  I'm telling you, they said that most bees won't sting far enough away from the nest. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, they won't attack you unless they feel threatened for the most part.  You want any of those phone calls?  I don't know what to do.  I would love an expert to call up.  Well, somebody just said something.  I wanted an expert to call up.  How do you get rid of them in the winter?  I want to know how many bees are in there and how the fuck we're going to get rid of that.  Yeah, we should ask Dr. Steve.  You don't understand.  He knows.  I know he knows.  For the people that won't check out the video, that's fine, whatever. 
[00:42:00]  My nephew's bedroom has a door.  You open the door and it's literally right there in the corner.  Yeah, it's one of those little attic doors in the bedroom.  It's not even in the attic out of the way where you can almost go, you know what, fuck the bees.  Let them fucking live there.  You know, what are we going to do?  This has to be removed.  They could be gnawing right through the bottom of the sheetrock, you know, eating that shit up and then get into the house at some point.  Jesus.  All right.  Want to take a break?  Yeah, I got to make sure I don't have bees on me. 
[00:42:30]  I swear I got the heebie-jeebies.  I'd hate to have bees on me.  Oh, I would hate that.  Awful.  No.  Blue Heeler taking a cheap shot today.  I kind of like it, though.  Just play the Howard Stern Show audio under the nest.  They'll all commit suicide.  Jesus.  That's kind of a cheap shot.  That is really.  But someone else said, you know, why don't you bore him to death?  Play a Rich Voss comedy CD.  All right, we'll take a quick break. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, Ant's got some stories.  Yeah, just a few observations on movies.  Movies.  You saw three movies.  I saw three movies.  It was kind of movie weekend.  Yeah, of interest.  Okay.  Just horrible.  And do you know that Uncle Paul was wished a very happy birthday on TV, Jimmy?  Dude, I heard about that.  I have not fucking saw that.  I have not seen it.  I was laughing my ass off. 
[00:43:30]  They nailed the fucking thing.  It was perfect.  They had a Photoshop picture.  Oh, I got to hear that.  I got to see it.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, let's see it.  It'll be after the break, for sure.  It's so fucking funny.  Give the people something for after the break.  But first, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, how are you?  I'm doing great, guys.  How are you?  I heard they just woke you up.  Well, it's time to get up anyway.  The best part is this isn't even a doctor.  This isn't a question for Dr. Steve.  For the newbies.  We always wake up Dr. Steve when we're talking medical shit. 
[00:44:00]  Like, wow, fuck, we need an expert.  And then Dr. Steve wakes up.  He doesn't know what he's saying because he's still asleep.  And it makes for good radio.  We just assume if you went to medical school, like, you had to learn a bunch of stuff anyway.  So you might know something about.  Do you know anything about hornet's nest?  Watch Dr. Steve be a total idiot about bees.  Like, he knows everything else.  But we're like, what about bees?  He goes, well, what I would do is just, I would get under the nest and jump up and down and break it open with my hand.  That's what I would recommend.  What do you got on hornet's nest? 
[00:44:30]  Hornet's nest?  Yeah.  We woke you up for this, by the way.  What do you got on hornet's nest?  So he didn't see the video?  No.  I just posted this literally, I don't know, before I went to bed.  Oh.  Dr. Steve, why are we?  I don't even know what to do with this.  I was just joking when I said Dr. Steve.  I'm sorry I missed you.  Did you get to go to the Comedy Cellar?  Yes, absolutely.  It was great.  All right, because you sent me a text, and I texted you back, but I didn't hear from you, so I was assuming that you were all right.  And Weird Medicine, I was listening on the way home from the Islander game, man. 
[00:45:00]  Fucking A, dude, you know how to do radio.  I told you that personally, but I want to say it on our show, too.  This guy really knows how to do a radio show, and we've got to figure out how to make this Weird Medicine show work for the guy.  Steve, did you get your guest?  Did you talk to Steve?  No, but we turned it into a, well, basically what I said was we wanted to have a prostitute in the studio so that we could have her explain how it is that you can avoid getting STDs, 
[00:45:30]  because certainly if a prostitute could do it, the rest of us could do it.  And what was great was that we couldn't get any prostitute to come up there because they wanted to be paid,  and then I just turned it into a joke that every whore in New York City was smarter than we were because we were doing what we were doing for free.  So actually you tried to get them, and they just wouldn't.  How about a porn girl?  Didn't Steve have any porn?  Because he asked me if I know anybody in porn, but everybody I know in porn is in L.A. 
[00:46:00]  I'm like, maybe you can get them on the phone, but he wanted them in studio.  So I'm like, Steve has got to know something.  It's Foundry Steve.  Yeah, it didn't work out, but it was okay.  Did you hear me hang up on Voss?  No, I didn't hear the show at all.  Yeah, I missed that part.  I heard it was really good because Voss called in late, so Dr. Steve did a little opie.  He said, fuck you, you're late.  Goddamn Steve from Bayshore.  Ask Dr. Steve for a couple of bottles of his grape swill so you can spray it on the nest and kill everything. 
[00:46:30]  Grape swill.  By the way, am I the only one really depressed that Roland Campos shot a bunch of soldiers in Fort Hood?  Holy shit.  He does look like Roland.  I was thinking what that guy looked like.  Yeah, it's fucking Roland.  That's all I've been thinking of.  Yes.  I didn't talk about it on Friday because I didn't have you guys.  You know, that's...  Roland.  What am I going to do with that story?  We'll talk about it a little bit today.  Dr. Steve, you have nothing on Hornets, huh?  I got nothing.  I mean...  Fucking Michiukaku would have fucking had a lot on the Hornets. 
[00:47:00]  You know that, right?  The Hornet is like a soap bubble.  Yeah.  They're like little planets flying around the universe.  Except they sting you.  Stinging the shit out of you.  Fuck him.  I got nothing.  I love that we're now waking up Dr. Steve for everything.  Poor Dr. Steve.  Let him go back to sleep.  All right, Steve.  Bye, Doc.  Bye, Doc.  Someone said they just saw the video and they said, my brother doesn't have a nest.  He's officially farming Hornets.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Your brother is a farmer.  Fucking...  Eh, grape swill.  I can see.  It's gone.  Dude, that nest is fucking creepy because it's inside.  So you know it's like it's attached at all places.  Yeah.  I couldn't...  I wouldn't be able to function.  Half a medicine ball, I think, is the size of it.  If you cut a medicine ball in half, that's what it looks like.  Well, when my brother was patting it, the thing barely...  You heard it shake a little bit, but that thing is a solid fucking nest.  It's solid, though. 
[00:48:00]  It's hard.  And then to hear the buzzing inside, when my brother goes, you hear that.  I was like...  I was trying to figure out what that noise was.  I'm like, get the hell out of there.  I swear I'm feeling things on me.  Just doing the heebie-jeebie.  All right, quick break.  We'll get into some other things, including the birthday wish for Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I heard about it.  Did not hear it.  Hysterical.  Dude, it's amazing.  The video's going to do very well for whoever posted that one, man.  All right, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Quick observation. 
[00:48:30]  I'm walking down the hall with Kenny.  And Kenny saw the sports guys from one of the sports stations here.  And you had a little observation there, Kenny?  A lot of buzz in the hallways.  Those sports guys are in their glory this morning.  Well, Monday's a big day for sports, right?  Yeah, they're all second-guessing.  Why would he try to kick a field goal with no timeouts?  He should have punted.  They're all discussing the big controversy, all the games.  So tune into the sports channels if you want to hear that. 
[00:49:00]  Notish Kite.  Monday morning quarterbacking.  Not a fan of that.  You're not a fan of the second-guessing.  I just don't have time for sports.  I guess I'm not macho enough.  I don't know.  Is it time?  You're so busy?  Yeah, I slept all day yesterday.  Oh, okay.  They're skipping around the halls.  They're just excited, looking up stats.  Yeah, they're in their glories.  Numbers.  Yeah, doing the numbers for the games.  Yeah, yeah.  All right. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you for letting me contribute that.  It was good.  It was nice.  Thanks.  All right.  There he goes.  We got to hear the Uncle Paul.  Did you guys watch it?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, yeah, put it up so we can...  I walked out.  I went to the bathroom.  I didn't watch it.  We can watch, and I'll tweet this video.  Channel 7 here.  For the people out there.  Basically, we should explain, though.  It's kind of taking on a life of its own.  I mean, we got the Uncle Ted birthday wish behind you.  No, not Uncle Ted.  That's fucking Uncle Ted Sheckler.  Ted Sheckler.  I'm tired today.  Motherfucker.  Yeah, Ted Sheckler. 
[00:50:00]  You got a son.  I'll be a little tiny, Uncle Ted.  That's different.  I don't know why I said Uncle Ted.  Oh, because Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul and Ted Sheckler put them together.  So, it's becoming a thing to get some birthday announcements on the local news for Ted Sheckler and now Paul Hargis, who's also known as Uncle Paul, of course.  Yeah.  Here, just play it off there.  It'll be easier.  Now, for birthdays on the 7.  Turning 7 years young, Nevaeh, I'm hoping that's right, Stern, she is a little piece of heaven, likes Hannah Montana and likes to help others. 
[00:50:30]  Nevaeh, happy birthday to you.  And turning 77 years young, Paul Hargis enjoys playing patty cake with all of his grandchildren.  And, hey, this is the best part.  He enjoys watching First News every day.  Thank you, Paul, and a very happy birthday to you.  It is 6 to 12.  And they found a picture that couldn't be you in about 30 years.  And, hey, this is the best part.  He enjoys watching.  God damn it, I'm not happy.  Why aren't you happy, Paul?  I'm 57 years young.  They did get Paul Hargis' age wrong. 
[00:51:00]  And they spelled my name wrong.  Oh, they did.  Yeah.  How do you spell Hargis?  H-A-H-R-R-G-I-S.  Hargis.  Now, is that a Photoshop picture of James?  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah, yeah, they put...  Oh, fuck, you know what?  I'm a dummy.  And they gave me hair where I look like the fucking...  I look like I should be trying to fucking suck Kevin Spacey's dick.  And then fucking in American Beauty, that fucking horse shit movie. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, they gave you some gray hair and aged you and...  You know what, though?  We got another one.  That is so funny.  He likes to play patty cake with his grandchildren.  Yeah, can I hear that part again?  Oh, what a creep.  Paul Hargis.  And the fact that they put that little girl on at first saying she's a little slice of  heaven.  She sure is.  She is.  Learning 77 years young, Paul Hargis enjoys playing patty cake with all of his grandchildren. 
[00:52:00]  And hey, this is the best part.  He enjoys watching first news every day.  And hey, here's the best part.  Happy birthday to you.  Is that the best part, really?  Paul Hargis.  Paul Hargis makes the news.  Patty cakes.  These fucking birthday announcements are great fucking fodder.  We got to get a picture, because that's good.  We got to get a picture.  I'll send a picture that I have of Paul Hargis.  Paul Hargis, yeah.  I photographed him one time, where it was my, I had the shoe, remember when I got my  head shaved, he had the shoe horn? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, shit, yeah.  Oh, yes.  That was it.  And I actually woke my girlfriend up at the time, and when she saw me, she screamed, because  she didn't, she was half asleep, and she just saw the hair, and I went, get up.  And she went, ah!  And then she realized it was me.  It was like the reverse shoe horn.  Yeah, it was so bad, dude.  It was a great haircut.  It was one of the best of all time.  Wow, fucking, you know something, that is just, that is a great bit for people to do,  just try to get on these goddamn shows like that. 
[00:53:00]  Well, we got two so far.  Yeah.  We look forward to the next one, whoever can get that done.  And so, you watched a bunch of movies this weekend, we had a nice little discussion about  it before the show.  Maybe we should share it with the rest of the audience.  Yeah, I know.  There were a lot of laughs and observations in there.  Some laughs.  These are not movies that are in the theaters, mind you.  These are movies that have pretty much just popped on demand, things like that, because  of course, I don't go to the movies.  So, the movies that have been out for a while, but I don't think a lot of people saw it in  the theater, and they might see it at home. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  So, why not fucking talk about it?  The first one was one that James saw, A Righteous Kill.  You finally saw it, huh?  I finally saw that hunk of shit.  Wait, you hadn't seen it?  No.  I thought all this time you saw it.  No.  Your impression of it had me laughing my balls off for months now, and then seeing it, you  couldn't even convey to me how bad it was.  Oh, good.  So, I didn't over-exaggerate. 
[00:54:00]  It is embarrassing to Pacino and De Niro and their legacy.  Yeah.  It is embarrassing.  The Turk and Rooster thing, they're just calling each other Turk and Rooster too many  goddamn times.  Hey, Turk.  Rooster.  Rooster.  Hey, Turk.  Shut up.  They say their names a lot.  Oh.  Too much.  Do we have any scenes?  There's got to be a scene on you two we can grab.  And just the fact, you know what it is, they're too old for a buddy cop movie thing. 
[00:54:30]  Turk and Rooster.  Yeah, and throw around names like Turk and Rooster.  They're not, it is so unbelievable.  And there's one horrid scene where De Niro is playing baseball, I guess he's on a baseball  team or something, and he's on third, and I guess somebody gets a hit and he's got to  run for home.  They show him running for home, and you just realize how old De Niro is, and how he shouldn't 
[00:55:00]  be playing baseball, and how they shouldn't have filmed him running.  Wow.  He ran like an old man running.  Well, that's one of those things that they do to give character to a character, and to  give depth to a character.  It has nothing to do with the film, and it's awful.  What happened to him, you think?  Why wouldn't they look at the script and see how bad that is?  You know, and we play this game with other actors.  What was the last good movie that De Niro did?  Oh, fuck.  What would you say?  I guess we've got to go to IMDb, but it's getting to a point where you're like, what's 
[00:55:30]  De Niro up to?  He hasn't done a good movie in a long time.  This proves how dumb these guys are.  See, you can't even come up with it.  We're all De Niro fans.  No.  Last good De Niro film.  What could you...  I didn't think Heat was that good.  I mean, it didn't stink like this, but I thought Heat was kind of fucking shitty.  People disagree with me on that.  A bunch of people liked the Heat.  I didn't...  I thought it was awful.  Yeah.  Enough about the Fockers.  I thought...  You know what?  I thought the first one, Meet the Parents, was funny.  I loved Meet the Parents.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's good.  Yeah.  The little Fockers.  All right.  It's Fockers. 
[00:56:00]  We get it.  We get it.  They're making a third, right?  It's called Little Fockers.  What's another Heat?  What's this Heat again?  Huh?  Heat?  Wait.  2009?  Is it just like...  Heat 2009.  Video game.  Oh, it's a video...  Oh, okay.  Where's this IMDb?  I really want to know...  We're looking at it right now.  The last good De Niro movie.  Righteous Kill.  What Just Happened.  Wait.  Where are you at?  Stardust.  Top.  Going down.  The Good Shepherd.  Okay.  Would you say Good Shepherd?  No? 
[00:56:30]  It was all right.  A couple movies I never heard of.  Arthur Eleminimos.  Oh, it's probably some cartoon.  Hide and Seek.  He played David Calloway in Hide and Seek.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Now we're...  That's what good roles are doing to him.  We're in 2005.  We're already in 2005.  So we're on to something here.  And we haven't really come up with something.  Bridge of Sin.  We Ray.  Meet the Fockers.  I can't say that was a good movie.  That was good.  The Shark Tale, you can't say. 
[00:57:00]  Godsend.  You know, who is that?  But I'll tell you one thing.  Analyze That sucked.  The first one wasn't that bad.  Let me tell you something.  Billy Crystal is so funny in those movies.  You don't like him in those?  You got scared for a second.  Let me.  I'm going to play a sock hard.  Shut up.  All nervous because he might get fucking whacked.  Shut up.  Right.  We get it.  The score.  The score.  The score was very good with him and Brando and Edward Norton. 
[00:57:30]  Edward Norton.  All right.  Guess what?  Edward Norton.  Full retard.  And he pulled it off.  Holy shit.  The score was a good movie.  I remember that movie.  And he went full retard.  Yeah.  I think of full retard.  So that's eight years ago.  So there's your answer.  Eight years ago.  The movie that we sort of all agree on is eight years ago for De Niro.  And I think that Brando was who was such a cunt.  I heard that he would not allow Frank Oz directed that movie and he would not allow Frank to direct  his scenes because he goes, I'm not going to Miss Piggy. 
[00:58:00]  He would always call him Miss Piggy.  Muppet director.  De Niro had to direct him.  He wouldn't take direction from Frank Oz.  Miss Piggy.  Is he a good director, Frank Oz?  I don't know if he, I don't know.  He might be.  I was surprised to see that he directed that.  But Brando was just, and there was one movie he did.  I want to say it was, what was it?  He loved Johnny Depp.  Dawan DeMarco, which I actually liked.  And somebody, I might know if this is not true, but I heard that he would only be shot,  he wouldn't wear pants during the scenes.  Or this might have been the score.  Oh, okay, right.  Because he was so fat, he didn't want to be shot, so he refused to wear pants. 
[00:58:30]  So they couldn't shoot him that way.  That's brilliant.  Ah, yeah, you know.  Who, only fucking Brando, would walk on in a suit and underwear and do a scene well.  I'm not going to put my pants on.  I'm not going to be without pants.  But somebody had to make the call to the director, Marlon's not going to wear trousers.  A couple people saying Showtime was a really good movie.  Was that with Eddie Murphy?  I didn't see that one. 
[00:59:00]  Okay, maybe it was.  Did you see Showtime?  No.  I don't remember the movie.  I didn't see Boldfinger.  What about, let's look at Pacino's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Continued success.  We made our point, though.  It's been a while for a really good De Niro movie.  Now we go to Pacino.  The last good movie Pacino made.  My wig.  He's doing King here now.  We start with Righteous Kill, I guess, right?  He's playing Jack Kevorkian.  That's right.  That's coming out soon.  Oh, wow.  Is he?  Yeah, lie down. 
[00:59:30]  Ocean's 13, but I don't think he had a big role in that.  I don't know, though, because I didn't see.  Okay.  I suffocate people with my wig.  That's how I kill him.  I put the needle in the arm, but I can't reach.  I need my lift.  Yeah.  I got to stand up and just kind of reach over my head and jab.  Hit you in the arm.  Pacino fans are not going to be happy.  I don't see one on the whole first page.  Ocean's 13.  88 Minutes was another horrendous movie.  Two for the Money. 
[01:00:00]  The Merchant of Venice.  Angels in America.  I didn't see the Merchant.  Angels in America might have been it.  I've heard that was really good about AIDS.  It was supposed to be some really touching six-part miniseries.  I heard that was very good.  So that wasn't even a movie?  That was on Showtime or something?  HBO.  You would count that as a role, though.  I mean, that's fucking six years.  No, but we're talking a movie.  You go and see.  What about Simone?  Ugh.  Holy shit.  You know what, though?  He hasn't fucking done a good movie in a while.  I'll say this.  Insomnia I liked.  Insomnia?  I liked Insomnia.  Yeah, me too. 
[01:00:30]  That could be it.  He was great in that.  Robin Williams was really creepy.  Do you remember his nails in that?  No.  Oh, yeah.  He had his crusty nail fungus phase.  Oh.  For some reason.  Pacino had horrible.  I remember he had horrendous nails in Insomnia.  He had like a nail fungus thing going on.  I don't give a shit about nails on anyone.  They should have a fucking...  They should have a handstand in.  Right.  They were dark or something, right?  They were rotting.  It looked like his fingernails were rotting.  What if that's from smoking?  Yeah.  In Insomnia it was a good fucking movie.  I liked it, too.  I might have to go re-watch that.  And he also did a couple years before. 
[01:01:00]  The Insider in 1999.  Devil's Advocate I loved.  It was wig glue.  I loved it.  On my fingernail.  Little wig glue.  I had an allergic reaction.  Yeah, sometimes when I'm fixing my lips, I get dirt from the street on my fingers.  Shoe polish gets on there, trying to squeak them on my little feet.  Sometimes I mix up my wig polish and shoe polish.  Same color.  Wig polish?  Yeah.  I wear wig polish.  Jesus.  Because it looks like I got gray sideburns and Emilio Estevez light brows. 
[01:01:30]  A wig.  Yeah.  Sometimes I sneeze and my wig comes forward.  Gets in my eyes like speed racing.  So both these guys, they haven't really done a big movie in almost a decade.  It's been a while, man.  Right?  It's been a while.  Devil's Advocate was amazing.  I loved it.  That movie is really fucking good.  Look.  Don't touch.  Touch.  Don't touch.  So you hated Righteous Kill.  Yeah, you were supposed to, though.  It was so hokey.  It's one of those, like... 
[01:02:00]  Oh, 50 Cent was in that, too.  Oh, yes, he was.  You couldn't understand a word Fiddy was saying, also.  Why didn't Mr. Fiddy stop by?  He was in New York last week.  Was he?  We had a great time with him.  We did, yo.  Some line he was launching.  I don't know, but I thought we hit it off with the guy where he would come back.  We had a really good time with him.  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, Fiddy was in that, yo.  Fiddy.  All right.  So what were the other two movies you saw over the weekend?  Yeah, that was a horrible one.  And then...  Oh, my God.  The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3. 
[01:02:30]  Now, the original.  The remake.  Oh, you didn't see...  I've seen the original.  It's great.  Did you see...  It's a good old movie.  Gritty New York kind of old school.  You should have did a double feature.  Did the original and then the new one.  I'd seen the original very recently.  Pretty recently.  Within the past couple of weeks.  Okay.  So you got a good reference point.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let me interrupt you because I didn't see it yet.  There's a great...  I forgot Walter Matthau's in the original.  Yeah, yeah.  Walter Matthau's the lead.  And there's a great moment where Walter Matthau has been...  These Japanese fucking guys are following him the whole time.  These fucking guys.  And they're all Japanese. 
[01:03:00]  And they're all Japanese and he keeps saying racist shit about them.  Yeah.  And he's so annoyed with them.  And then finally one of them just addresses him in English and he realizes the whole time  they understood everything he was saying.  And it's fucking great.  I imagine they had that in this one.  No.  Of course not.  No.  Why would they?  No.  Why would they?  How do they ruin a great movie?  By putting John Travolta in it.  John Travolta, worst actor ever.  He stinks.  I am voting him in my worst actor ever. 
[01:03:30]  Pulp Fiction, a fluke.  Don't know what happened.  Quentin Tarantino said, play a heroin addict guy.  And he was able to pull it off by just kind of, you know, I want to stab it three times.  He knows that.  He was able to just do that.  Right.  But anything before and after that is over the top horse shit.  And now he's so over the top guy, you can't even watch him and seriously take him seriously. 
[01:04:00]  You know how you knew it was going to be bad when Denzel was on Letterman promoting it?  And they showed a clip of him and Travolta talking, like, on the phone?  And they showed Travolta's rant.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was terrible.  And I'm like, if that's what they're showing, it's going to be a bad fucking movie.  It's bad in every fucking respect.  He's horrible in it.  The camera work is annoying.  It's trying to be this action movie, this whipping around the characters like John Woo does. 
[01:04:30]  And shit like that.  Like, you might see something like that in Bad Boys, you know, where the camera swings around people.  Sure, yeah.  Every fucking shot.  Well, they were doing dialogue between Travolta and Denzel Washington.  Denzel is in the command center.  And John Travolta is on the subway train.  So, John Travolta's talking, and the camera's going around, clockwise, around Travolta.  And then Denzel, it's counterclockwise around Denzel. 
[01:05:00]  Clockwise around Travolta.  Counterclockwise.  Back and forth like this, you get fucking dizzy.  And you know, the biggest problem with the movie that I read, they weren't even on the set together.  They fucking filmed their parts separately.  Well, he was in the command center for most of the time.  So, they figured, well, we could do this, because you're not even supposed to be in the same room.  I believe there are a couple of scenes where they are together.  Right.  But it's minimal.  Most of it was separate.  Denzel said that, actually.  Yeah, they said most of the movie, they were filmed separately.  Minimal. 
[01:05:30]  That can't be good.  It was so hokey and hack.  There's a car chase in it that absolutely was thrown in, because they had to have said,  we need more action in here, let's just put in a ridiculous, unnecessary, like, car pursuit thing.  Right.  With crashes and fucking flipping cars and explosions.  That does not fit in this movie.  Are you done with the car chase at this point?  You really need a good reason for it. 
[01:06:00]  Are you done?  Yeah.  I'm done with the car coming off the ground and people going,  holy shit!  All right.  All right.  And Travolta, I cannot reiterate how bad he is in this movie.  I don't understand.  This is what I don't get.  Like, when I've read scripts and I've looked at scripts, I can look at things and go,  like, ugh, God, that line stinks.  And sometimes I have the ability to change it, other times I don't.  But when you're on that level, when you're Travolta or you're Denzel, you have,  unless you're a fucking dealer of Scorsese or somebody, and even with them you can talk 
[01:06:30]  to them, you fucking probably have final cut as far as what you say.  Like, you can say, I don't want to say that.  But you've got to think they just don't care.  Dude, how could they not?  They just don't care.  How could they not go, you know what, man?  This is really corny.  Let me just, uh...  They've been doing it a long time.  They don't care.  With gusto, he was pumping out this drivel.  With gusto.  Are they that dumb that they don't see it?  He loved it.  He loved it.  You think he thought that he was being really intense?  No, they just don't care.  I think he thought, no, seriously, I think he thought he was being intense. 
[01:07:00]  Travolta, right?  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  Like, he's just extreme and action-packed.  Yeah, did that get you?  Yeah, shaking things up.  Can we see, can we see a little Travolta in this?  He's so fucking bad.  Can we see her?  Travolta filmed this in three days.  John G is telling us.  He has so much of this camera work, too.  Slow-mo, blurry background.  Slow to fast, Mo. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, slow to fast.  Back to slow-mo.  Push-ins, pull-outs.  Unlock the door.  Do it now, or I'll kill you.  Already he stinks.  Yeah.  This side's facing the window.  Patrol center, call him Pelham, one, two, three.  Oh, why'd you stop, one, two, three?  You're all going ahead.  Rail control center, do you read me?  Who is this?  This is a man who's going to give the city a run for money.  Now, what is...  Oh, he fucked up that line.  He's...  It's in the trailer. 
[01:08:00]  They couldn't redo the line?  He's so bad.  He's fucking terrible.  He is a horrible actor.  He is awful.  Robert Shaw was fucking chilling in that.  Robert Shaw is a great actor.  And he didn't overdo it.  No.  He was just a guy who would fucking shoot a passenger in the head, and he meant it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  This, he's so over the top.  It doesn't come off as chilling, or...  It comes off like, oh, here's John Travolta being so unbelievable in his role that I'm completely 
[01:08:30]  removed from this motion picture.  You're still a little more Travolta, because this is Travolta talking into the, uh...  What the fuck is he holding?  Oh, my God.  He's got his little, uh, yeah.  The price for New York City hostages this morning.  What do you think, a million a...  Now, what is the price for New York City hostages this morning?  What do you think, a million a piece is too high?  Oh, I'm not a hostage negotiator.  I'm a civil service employee.  Oh, I think you'll do just fine.  Now, what time do you got on your watch?  2.13. 
[01:09:00]  59 minutes, I'm gonna start killing passengers.  You don't want innocent people dying, do you?  Oh, you tell me.  Life is simple now.  You just have to do what I say.  Call the mayor now.  Somebody just hijacked Pelham 1, 2, 3.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Is that Gandolfini's the mayor as the mayor is horrendous?  Of course he is!  It's so bad.  But we all love Gandolfini.  How can you say that?  Yeah, yeah, Tony Soprano is the fucking mayor.  He's also a big fucking mascot in that other movie that's out now. 
[01:09:30]  Let me tell you.  Wild things, whatever.  The characters are so shallow and fake and typical.  Like, they try to make...  There's like a scene where the New York subway guy is going,  Well, we're gonna have to cut the friggin' power.  I gotta call the supervise.  Like the typical New York con-ed guy.  And then the mayor is the mayor guy.  And just like so shallow and horrid. 
[01:10:00]  How many guys took this over with Travolta?  You know something?  I can't even be sure.  He wasn't alone, was he?  No, but there was no character development with his cronies.  They were just cronies.  Do you have any of Robert Shaw from the original?  Like, just to compare...  I want to go through the rest of the show.  Oh, yeah, I do too.  Hold on a minute.  Jeff in Texas.  Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  Come on, Jeff.  Let's go.  Jeff.  Johnny.  Hey.  Whatever. 
[01:10:30]  Go ahead.  Hey, there is a line in there where Don Travolta gets all flustered and upset and screams,  kiss my bunghole.  And nobody ever screams that.  No, he doesn't.  I don't believe you.  That couldn't have happened.  I said last night, dude.  Kiss my bunghole.  And I just looked at my wife like, we're going to bed.  And it was like 7.30.  I was like, not so hard.  You're saying that just to make me physically ill.  I don't believe it's that bad.  Wow.  He couldn't have yelled that.  He probably was actually yelling that as a complimentary positive thing to another gentleman. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, the Italian thing, too, you want to talk about.  Yeah, yeah.  In the original, there was a lot of black...  Well, there's one scene toward the beginning of the original movie where one of the train hijackers  turns around and there's a black guy sitting in the seat and he's talking or saying something.  And the guy hits him in the mouth with the rifle and says, shut up, nigga. 
[01:11:30]  And the black guy shuts up.  In this one, there is not a hint of black, white, black racism, kind of that type of thing.  But John Travolta goes off on this anti-Italian diatribe that is over the top, ridiculous, unnecessary, uncalled for, and no outrage at all.  Why is that okay?  I don't know.  Why is that okay if they're basically saying racism isn't okay with the whole black, white thing, but they do the Italian thing? 
[01:12:00]  Which Totoro is in that, fucking...  Probably Nick?  Or is it John?  John Totoro?  I don't know.  The skinny Totoro.  The fucking one that's in all the movies.  Not the chubby one.  That's John, then.  I'll tell you why.  People that do these films don't feel intellectually superior to Italians.  So they feel like Italians are a safe target.  They feel like they're dealing with other adults who can handle it.  But when they're dealing with blacks, again, they're paternalistic.  It's sickening the view they have of black people. 
[01:12:30]  His name is Caminetti.  And, of course, he's this Italian guy.  And he gets on the intercom to talk to John Travolta.  And John Travolta won't have it.  He wants Denzel back.  But this guy is a hostage negotiator.  So he figures Denzel can get up and leave.  He's going to sit down and be the hostage negotiator.  And John Travolta just turns around and says,  You know, where's the greaseball hijacker, negotiator?  Where, what's he out getting a pizza?  Listen, you greaseball, you guinea.  Like, he's able to do that. 
[01:13:00]  He poured the anti-Italian sentiment on.  But when he finally meets Denzel for the first time at the subway,  he doesn't say anything about his race.  He doesn't say, you know,  Oh, I didn't know you were a fucking, you know.  Why wouldn't he?  He's a brutal guy.  Why wouldn't he say something horrid?  But, and obviously he's got some racial problems  because he just wouldn't leave John Turturro's character alone.  He's a white guy with a tattoo on his neck.  Of course he has racial problems.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  But again, people are just petrified these days  of doing anything in the movie  that portrays black people as being bad guys.  They're always good people in every movie now.  So, regardless, like, why can't,  and it's not a stereotype thing  or something that should be,  oh, that's offensive.  What if a criminal happens to be a black guy  in a movie or commercial these days  for an alarm company or something?  It just doesn't happen anymore.  There would be outrage.  There'd be outrage.  Well, I was watching that movie going,  how come fucking Italians can just be shit on? 
[01:14:00]  You know why?  Because you wops can take it.  We don't give a shit.  You wops can take it.  I'm watching.  It didn't piss me off that he was doing that.  You wops can take it.  And saying, yeah.  It didn't piss me off  that he was saying bad things about Italians  because I could give a shit.  Not offensive.  But what was offensive to me  was the fact that he wouldn't do it  to blacks or Muslims  or anything like that  because there'd be outrage.  What's enraging is the phony rebellion,  these phony fucking rebels in Hollywood, 
[01:14:30]  these fucking cornball writers  and these fucking cornball actors.  How the fuck did it get to this point, Jimmy?  Because they got Denzel and Travolta  to sign off on it.  No, no, no, no.  In general in Hollywood.  In general.  This isn't just an isolated case.  It's happening in all our movies now,  in all our comedies,  all our fucking thrillers.  Because they're playing it safe.  There was a time when we were growing up,  the movies were pretty fucking edgy.  You watched.  With the material and the stereotyping  and the humor.  You know, they weren't scared.  You watched movies. 
[01:15:00]  They just made a funny movie.  Yeah.  You watched movies from, you know,  the 70s, shit like that.  The 80s,  even into the 90s.  And yeah,  you'll hear fucking words.  You'll hear,  you'll see everyone getting shit on.  Now there's only certain groups  that are able to get shit on.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  Back to the Future,  a comedy,  you know,  a light movie  has, you know,  beat its spook  to a bunch of black guys.  Right.  And that was, you know,  that was accepted as just that.  You wouldn't see that 
[01:15:30]  in a comedy now.  It's a bunch of young,  predominantly white writers  who have never fucking had  fun interactions  like where they're teasing  black people racially  or black people teasing them.  Right.  Like, they just never had  those interactions.  They're a bunch of little  sheltered cunts.  And so they don't know how.  The bottom line is,  a guy like that  who's got a tattoo on his neck  and is hot.  One of the problems  he'd probably have,  one of the outrages  he'd probably have  is fucking,  he'd be angry at blacks.  That's one of the guys,  if he hates Italians,  he hates blacks.  He was in prison,  apparently.  You know, 
[01:16:00]  maybe he's got a problem.  Yeah.  And if I see one more  fucking fat black judge  in a movie,  does every judge  in every movie  have to be a fat black woman  that comes in  and takes control  of that courtroom?  We were talking about  the stereotypes in movies  and that's another one  we've got to add to the list.  That's become like,  it's become a stereotype.  The other one we mentioned  before the show,  we had a terrific break on this.  It was amazing.  I think as soon as we say  hi in the morning,  we should just start rolling  because we use up  all our good material 
[01:16:30]  before the show even starts.  We should roll tape  and then just leave early.  That's a good point.  The stereotype  of the New York City cab driver,  it's always a white guy  with a cigar  and one of those  fucking cabbie hats.  Yeah.  Where to?  Where to?  Where to?  Where can I take you?  Like it's 19 fucking 35  and you're going to the Copa.  And I wonder if the rest  of the country  really understands  that there's barely  any of those guys  in cabs in New York City.  No.  But every movie  will portray the cabbie  as that.  White cab driver 
[01:17:00]  equals insane man.  Right.  That's what I was saying.  The only white cabbies  you see in New York now,  white male cabbies,  are insane.  Honestly,  when I get in a cab  and it's a white guy,  I'm like,  oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I really want  the fucking, you know.  Fucking Sikh  or fucking  all those guys.  Arab, Arab,  whatever.  I want the most foreign  of foreign guys  driving me around  New York City now  because when you do  get a white guy,  he's got fucking problems  and he wants to tell you  all his problems 
[01:17:30]  within two minutes.  He'll let you fucking know.  He turns around  and goes,  where are you heading to?  And he's got that stare  that goes right through you.  I'm like,  oh, this is going to be fun.  Fucking Charles Manson  looking guys.  They can't,  they just can't portray  things accurately.  It drives me fucking nuts.  And the black judge  is good too, yeah.  The black woman judge  all the time.  The black guy  that's got to be  the hero to the white person  and that's what happened,  you know,  in this movie also.  The black guy  that stands up  and takes the bullet 
[01:18:00]  for the white woman.  Like, it's just,  it's just all this  It's out of balance.  Yeah.  It's gone to a point  where for many years  it was out of balance  the other way  where blacks were cartoon  and they were treated  like shit in films  and they were fucking  shucking and jiving  and look,  black plantation.  Look at fucking,  give me,  Sidney Poitier.  Right.  Motherfucking Sidney Poitier  did fucking fine movies.  He was portrayed  as a strong man.  Sure.  It wasn't even like,  yeah, you know,  they call me Mr. Tibbs. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  Yeah, that was some good shit.  And he slapped fucking,  he slapped that old  white man in the face.  Yeah.  It was a very big scene.  It was,  that was some good shit.  Now, how old is that  fucking movie?  So we're talking,  there's been a lot of years  that have gone by  where it's been kind of in,  you know,  or getting in balance.  Now we're so fucking  out of whack  that they can't even show  a goddamn  one single burglar  alarm commercial  where the perpetrator  is a black guy.  They're all white guys  breaking into this  poor dumb broad house. 
[01:19:00]  And if Hollywood  is filled with  all these pussies,  then they shouldn't be  remaking these  really cool gritty movies  from the 70s.  Just leave them alone.  Yeah, if you're gonna remake them.  Make your fucking pussy movies  and leave the great movies alone.  Go the distance at least.  Either go the distance  or don't fucking make the film.  That's your choice.  They don't know their pussies.  They don't know  that they're ruining this stuff.  And again,  I apologize to the listeners.  I know sometimes  they kill me on WackBad  for redundancy  and sometimes you're right.  But I don't know  how else to explain it  other than white paternalism. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, it is.  It's disingenuous, man.  It's a fucking,  I don't understand  how black people  are not just disgusted by it.  It's not real.  It's a bunch of white people  that would never truly  feel comfortable around you  trying to show you  how comfortable  they feel around you.  Yeah.  You ever see a gang  in a TV show  or movie these days?  A gang?  It's a Benetton ad.  It's a fucking black guy,  a white guy,  an Asian guy.  They're all getting together  in crime.  They're all having fun  getting together in crime. 
[01:20:00]  It's never just a black gang,  just an Asian gang,  a white fucking skinheads  or something.  They're all getting along  mugging somebody  or fucking robbing a place.  Basically,  they couldn't remake  the Warriors.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Because they would have to...  Riffs!  The Riffs got like  Asian guys in it.  Yeah, of course.  Right, right.  A gay Jewish friend.  And that's another thing.  Representing everybody  and every gang.  Of course.  Dude,  there's an Olive Garden commercial  where the girl  is coming home  from college 
[01:20:30]  and the parents  are going to take her  and her roommates  out to the Olive Garden.  And what is the  fucking roommate?  There's a white girl  and then the black girl  and the Asian guy.  They've got to add  everyone in.  Sometimes,  you know something,  it just isn't like that.  You see a get-together  at a house  and every race  is represented  at a party  at a house  or something.  Including the Muslim now.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to do that.  Unless it's unpleasant.  Hey, let's say hi to Kevin.  I don't want to lose 
[01:21:00]  this phone call  because it's a great observation.  Oh, sorry.  Kevin in Jersey,  go ahead.  Hey, these guys in Hollywood  are so disconnected  that they think  the guy from  the Backstreet Boys  is dangerous.  That's what  the Travolta character  looks like.  He looks like  an old Backstreet Boy.  He's such a  ruthless criminal  but he had time  to make sure  his fucking beard  was trimmed down  like the Backstreet Boys.  Yeah, like...  Oh, God.  He's the worst.  Travolta's horrible.  Pat from Menachie, 
[01:21:30]  by the way,  this is something  I want to say  another hundred times  on our show  and I agree with him.  Bad News Bears  should have never  been remade.  Agreed.  What they did  to that fucking comedy,  that Walter Matthau comedy  is a sin.  Hollywood should just  leave those movies alone.  Leave them alone.  Tanner fucking  had a thing  on all the races  where he talked about  like all the fucking kids  and he's dropping  and the N-Bomb and...  If you could find  that original clip  on YouTube,  that'd be great.  Tanner Boyle.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tanner Boyle.  And the kids  are drinking beer  and Walter Matthau 
[01:22:00]  is drinking beer  with kids in the car  and no one has seatbelts  and he's driving  and drinking  and then in the remake,  what's his name there?  Fucking Billy Bob.  They're drinking soda, right?  They were drinking  fucking soda.  Part of it is  because again,  special interest groups  have gotten so powerful.  There's so much money  involved with these things  that people are so afraid  of doing something  and look,  it's easy for me to say  maybe if I had  30 or 40 or 50 million dollars  like a studio invested,  I would say,  look, don't say nigger. 
[01:22:30]  Black groups are going  to protest this  and blacks are a big part  of our audience  and we're going to lose  20 million dollars.  You know what?  It's easy to say  in our position  maybe I'd be the same way  but just don't remake  the movies.  You know what though?  They come up with  original fucking ideas.  Or don't target  other people  when they say fucked up.  Right, right.  That's what drives me nuts.  If they didn't do  anything racial  because their pussy's fine  but they want to do  racial stuff  but they just won't  be edgy with it.  Yeah, it's not realistic.  They're not realistic depictions 
[01:23:00]  and they've gotten me  affected to the point now  where when I do see something  or somebody say something  that would be considered  politically incorrect  or you see somebody  on the news  one of these off comments  I'll sit there  and go like  oh shit  like ooh  like I  I know there's trouble  brewing  you know?  It's too bad.  Yeah.  It's just making it worse  to be honest with you.  You just gotta fucking  keep spitting at it  and keep screaming about it  and fucking just  don't give in to it.  Thank God we have a voice  and we could yell  and scream back. 
[01:23:30]  You are no Danny Ross.  Not at all.  Let me fucking explain.  It's weird to see somebody  sitting still straight up  this long to the show.  Then why the fuck  did we fire Danny?  You are, I don't know.  If he's no Danny Ross  then why the fuck  did we fire Danny?  Because it's stupid.  Everybody knows  why we fired Danny.  What's up Sam?  There's no Tanner Boyle rant  on YouTube.  You should put  Tanner Boyle  rant.  Racist rant.  Racist motherfucker rant.  You don't know how to search  like the great Danny Ross.  Absolutely.  Because you actually  have a girlfriend 
[01:24:00]  and things that you do  you don't just spend  all day on the computer.  Am I smashing Danny?  Maybe there's a part  of the body  concealed underneath  a liver  that gives you  the potential  of doing that  and when the liver  rots away  that part comes forward.  Let's see how  did Derek go ahead.  Alright, that was a long trip.  It was well worth it  to spend alcoholism.  Derek, what's up?  Hey man, they're going  to remake Blazing Saddles  with that uppity white guy  wouldn't hit me  on the head with a show.  Yeah, no shit, right? 
[01:24:30]  Are they remaking  Blazing Saddles?  No, no fucking way.  I mean, I like your line, Derek  but there's no way  they would attempt  to fucking...  Sure they would.  Oh, Christ.  I'm not saying they're doing it  but dude, they're terrible.  They're fucking terrible.  Well, if they do remake  Blazing Saddles  maybe they could come up  with an ending  for that movie  that makes sense.  Yeah, right.  Fuckers.  They fucking gave up  on that movie.  That's another topic  we should do.  Movies that were  great and then  all of a sudden  they just said  ah, you know  we did enough here  let's just go home  and they never come up  with a good  nice ending for it.  At least with that  you know that they  were just trying 
[01:25:00]  something different.  Like that was Mel Brooks  actually just trying  something weird  that probably just  we looked at and go  eh.  Yeah, it didn't quite work.  They just didn't know  how to end comedies  in the 70s  and early 80s.  Caddyshack,  a movie we all love  if you really think about  that ending  was just completely  ridiculous.  That whole fucking  creature  something  completely ridiculous.  Blowing up  the golf course.  Right.  Yeah.  The golf course.  So anything else  on taking a pill  in one, two, three?  Well I got to that.  Oh, I was calling  the shots  like knowing  everything that was  going to happen. 
[01:25:30]  Okay, got it.  I'm sorry.  Because it was so  like obvious  and then  at the end  I won't  if someone wants  to watch it  and not have it ruined  I won't ruin the end  for you  but I just knew  I said  watch  guaranteed  there's going to be  a cornball  last line  to this fucking movie  like a cornball  awful  just  hack  need to get  that last  fucking line  that they think  is so great  and memorable  in a movie  in there.  Do they at least  kill Travolta 
[01:26:00]  or do they arrest him?  I don't want to ruin  the movie  for everybody.  I don't want to ruin  the movie.  Is there any Robert  for real?  Well we'll give him  a chance to leave.  That's funny  did Travolta  step on the third  rail at the end?  That would have been  a good fucking ending.  Listen  I need the answer  to this question  so if you don't  want to hear the ending  we're being cooler  about spoilers  these days  give us 30 seconds  so just go somewhere else.  You don't want to know  either Jimmy?  No of course  I'm going to see it.  I think I know  but I don't want to see it.  Alright forget it then.  No I would just 
[01:26:30]  cover my ears  because I know  what happened  and I haven't seen  the movie  they probably arrested him.  Watch the movie  yeah just see it.  I won't give away.  Okay alright  I'll tell you what  here's what the problem is  do you have the  hacky line  that ended the movie?  Travolta's last line  it doesn't make sense  out of context  you got to see it  and then go like  yeah I know  it really is kind of  should we give everyone  a chance to see the movie  and then we'll fucking  do the remainder  of this bit?  Here's the problem  they're obsessed with  and Eric Idle  said this about comedy 
[01:27:00]  they're obsessed  with likability  in Hollywood  and they think  if you say nigger  in any context  even as a bad guy  you're not likable  and that's the problem  the only time  they'll allow that word  is in a period piece  where it absolutely  like in Amistad  or a movie  where you can't  not have it  it's used  in a way too  that is  kind of necessary  to show the evilness  of the  the person using it 
[01:27:30]  against the black guy  obviously  but it's never  you can't use it  casually  like black people  use it  you know  it's just being  taken out of  and that's not realistic  let me go to Stryker  because oh my god  we're going to go  a little off-roading  a little  but it's still  in the same  same topic  we're kind of doing here  Stryker  what do you got buddy?  Have you guys noticed  they're starting to cut  drug scenes  out of movies  when they move a movie  to broadcast TV  Gone in 60 Seconds 
[01:28:00]  was on yesterday  on just regular  broadcast TV  and the entire  like middle sequence  where they're in the  when the cops  confront them  in Otto's garage  in a car full of heroin  they chop it up  completely  I mean it's like  a fairly pivotal  pivotal  like six minute scene  and they reduce it  down to one minute  and it goes from  the cop knocking  on the door  to the cop  getting him back  into his BMW  undercover car  saying 
[01:28:30]  it's happening tonight  and they don't explain  how he knows  that it's happening tonight  they don't explain  that you know  what all went on  that led up to him  realizing that it was  happening that night  and it's all about  the drugs right there  and they just  completely cut it out  they've been doing  that  I think they did  that to Pulp Fiction  also  I think they cut out  a drug scene  yeah there have been  a few that they're  cutting like the drug  scenes out of movies  broadcast TV though  you can't even  complain  that's just such  garbage at this point  why would you watch 
[01:29:00]  a movie  why would you even  bother  I mean it was  just something  that was on to watch  but I noticed  Godfather  was on AMC  all weekend  and they've changed  the language in it too  no they didn't  did that  AMC  oh yes  AMC was all about  trying to keep  the movies fucking pure  they were one of the  channels that did  keep the movies pure  that's not Ted Turner  is it  I think it is  AMC  American Movie Classic  so they run these movies  as they were  in theaters  did they change  the part about  the dog called 
[01:29:30]  the college  I don't remember  I don't remember  the specific wording  but there was like  four or five scenes  in there where  the last time I saw it  there was a totally  different language  and you could hear  you could just see  in fact the one part  there in the hotel room  where they meet  Mo Green  yeah  there was something  that he said  originally  and yesterday  you could tell  it was done  I got goddamn  guineas  these goddamn guineas  really make me laugh  I bet they took  anything racial out of it  and in fact 
[01:30:00]  the part where  they meet  where Tom meets  the producer  the film guy  there was even  a change in that  AMC is garbage  if they did that  it's garbage  yeah but they were  one of the last  fucking cable outlets  my crop McFriend  I'm sure they took that out  unless what he's talking  about is profanity  like unless they just  take all cursing out  and instead of guineas  they took out goddamn  no I bet  they took out  no I bet they took out  you know what really  scares me  as we obviously  all see the blockbusters  disappear 
[01:30:30]  and all the movies  are moving to what  your fucking Xbox  your PS3  your cable network  what if they start now  fixing the movies  for that  what fixing  oh you mean like  at least with blockbuster  you go fuck  I want the godfather  how it's fucking filmed  oh I got you  I got it  I got my copy  but we're all going  into this digital world  where we're  I mean it's gonna take a while  but you're gonna start  throwing your DVDs away  trust me  to make room in your  fucking houses  so now all the movies  are gonna be on  your Playstation 3 
[01:31:00]  your Xbox  your cable network  and what if all of a sudden  they're like  you know what  we gotta fix this  godfather movie  we can't have this out there  that's offensive  you think there's a possibility  that would happen  you never know  yeah  what do you think  because blockbuster  was sort of  you know  editing movies here and there  and you didn't know  yeah  unless you look closely  at the box and stuff  they denied it  but it was happening  yeah yeah  we all know it was happening  yeah well you know  what if they start doing that  and now you don't even have  the opportunity  to get the original movie  anymore 
[01:31:30]  oh god  if it goes that far  we're just doomed  we're doomed anyway  we're doomed  it would get to the point  it's gone to today  correctness  also there's a movie out  or coming out  that 2012  is coming out  and this is  an end of the world movie  of course  everything  you see all kinds of  icons  and monuments  and buildings  being destroyed  in this  sacred  objects  churches  things like that  what you will not see 
[01:32:00]  destroyed  is a  very holy  Muslim  a mosque  yes  some type of  holy  fucking  Muslim thing  okay  in the movie  yeah  the  kabah  the kabah  is that it  what's the kabah  someone help me  I don't know  but you won't see that  being destroyed  because  the  the guy was afraid  that there'd be a fatwa  against him 
[01:32:30]  it's  it's political correctness  it's fear  fear mongering  and it's  people  pussying out  but they won't  acknowledge  usually  like this is what  drives  okay  would I want a fatwa  on me  no  but then don't  fucking  then don't target  like you know  Bill Donahue  as much as he can be  an ass  he does point that out  which is the one thing  I like about him  is the fucking  phoniness  like curb your enthusiasm  that's hilarious  that he got a drop of piss  on the Christ painting  and they thought it was a tear  that's very funny  but they would never 
[01:33:00]  fucking  do that  with a picture of Muhammad  they just wouldn't do it  oh my god no  I was proud of how we handled  Bill Donahue  I didn't hear the interview  it was good man  Patrice was strong  in that one  Patrice was good  and we beat up Bill  a little bit  and then Bill was  beating up Patrice  it was a really good  I'm only saying that  one aspect of his  arguments I totally  agree with  getting back to the  fatwa  what is it  fatwa  there's a W  in there  F-A-T-W-A-H  or W-A  I got a question for Jimmy  would you rather have  a fatwa 
[01:33:30]  or my brother's  hornet's nest  slam dunked on your head  it's the same thing  I mean  exactly  and you're dealing  with the same mentality  of the fucking  angry bunch of  dumb buzzing bees  same fucking  irrational horse shit  it's an easier time  rationing  being rational  with a hornet  less of a fucking  knee jerk reaction  from a hornet  how much would that  suck though  that's your choice  a lot  that would be like  what  apparently that's a  giant  some kind of giant 
[01:34:00]  cube  in  Saudi Arabia  or something  that monument  and I guess  they show it  but they don't  show it  destroyed  because the guy  he said  he didn't want  to get fucked  he didn't want  to get in trouble  but they don't  actually just come out  and go look  the bottom line  is this  we have found  that Islam  and extremist  Muslims  handle things  very very violently  so we're afraid  they're going to  kill us  for parodying them  they will never  say that  but that's what  they're saying  amazing 
[01:34:30]  original first  Bueller's Day Off  had a bare breast  scene that was  never released  for DVD  is that true  I'm telling you  dude  that's happening  and now  with all that  stuff moving  to our TVs  I'm scared  what they're  going to do  to these  classic movies  let's go to  Graham  who's a  mulatto  he says it  for the  it's a  mulatto  it's a  mongrel  classic caller  it's important  to the discussion  what's up  Graham  morning gentlemen  hey  hey I was  just calling  to say  Jimmy 
[01:35:00]  you hit the  nail on the  head  like as far  as the white  media goes  and just  for me  white people  in general  I grew up  in a white  household  but when I  deal with  white people  just  you know  during my  day  it feels  like they  talk to me  like a  like a kid  that's  throwing a fit  in the supermarket  and the parents  are trying to  speak to them  without like  antagonizing  don't antagonize 
[01:35:30]  the black  man  and really  honestly  I'd rather  deal with  like real  disrespect  than fake  respect  it's frustrating  you're right  dude that's  exactly it  I'd rather  deal with  real disrespect  than fake  it's like  but there's  a way to  have real  respect  and just  be honest  like  just treat  and I'm not  saying treat  everybody the  way you want  to be treated  but just be  fucking honest  and give  everybody the  same amount  of bullshit  I mean that's  not a smart  way to say it  but if you're  going to make  Italian jokes  or you're  going to target  a guinea  then fucking  attack blacks 
[01:36:00]  too and attack  Jews  don't be so  fucking scared  of it  because that's  what a real  racist does  like Clint Eastwood  you want to  portray a racist  look if the guy  is going to say  slope and think  that's the guy  that would say  nigger and kike  it's the reality  of what a racist  is  and that was  the problem  you had with  that movie  exactly  I didn't think  it was that  great anyway  I didn't give  a fuck about it  I just didn't  care about it  I wish he pumped  up the racism  a little bit  I think if people  don't put this  stuff out in the  open then we  won't be able to  address our issues  and gain any  kind of understanding  of each other  you know what's  happening  people are 
[01:36:30]  misunderstanding  they're making  a mistake  between the  distinction of  blacks being  given equality  and rights  over the past  you know  50 years or so  and them  being coddled  being coddled  because they  are looked at  as yeah  irresponsible  children that  need the white  man to coddle  them and make  sure they aren't  offended or  agitated or  anything like that  and it's coming  off like I 
[01:37:00]  think the black  leadership in this  country should be  outraged at that  outraged at the  fucking you know  the the the  the gall that  white people  think that you  gotta just give  and give and  and you know  you're not able  to do for  yourself and  that's being  mistaken for  equality and  equal rights and  shit like that  or don't even  give just act  like you're  giving and  pretend you're  giving and  pretend it 
[01:37:30]  really is like  dating somebody  and fucking  somebody behind  their back and  then smiling at  your girlfriend  when she walks  in I mean it's  the same fucking  dishonesty yeah  it's because it's  like by swinging  the pendulum so  far the other  way you're  showing you're  showing that  paternalism I  mean do you  look black or  do you look  white or is it  obvious that you're  mixed Jimmy  well I look I  guess probably more  Puerto Rican than  anything people  think I'm Middle  Eastern sometimes  but I got brown 
[01:38:00]  skin so people  just treat me  different I'm  saying do you  hear like there  are really light  skinned black  guys and I'm  sorry I interrupted  you I didn't mean  it I'm kidding  but there are  light skinned  black guys that  will talk about  or they're black  and they're white  that will talk  about how white  people say things  around them  because they don't  know that they're  part black  and speaking of  light skinned  blacks do yourself  a favor today  yes and find the  pictures of Sammy  Sosa and what he  looks like now  what did he do to 
[01:38:30]  himself I don't  know what they're  saying Travis what  are they saying  I know Travis is  on this one  gentlemen I gotta  get out I gotta  get back to work  but I just wanted  to say as much  as you all goof  on stuff I  appreciate that  y'all can like  address it on a  serious note too  and that's cool  thanks man  great word  antagonizing too  Travis is dropping  a log right now  so we can't go to  Travis  do you mean that  like kind of  theoretically in what  he's doing at work  dropping a dude  basically what Travis  does every day on the  job  we're looking at  pictures of Sammy 
[01:39:00]  Sosa where he's  now a white guy  and his hair is  fucking Nat King  Colish  yeah it's very  strange  maybe I have a  story in front of  me I don't know  or if someone has  it they can call  the show real fast  but oh here we  go Sammy Sosa  turning white  question mark  the pictures are  everywhere you'll  see him today  maybe he's just  older  what's going on  with Sammy  Sosa's face  yeah Reggie  Jackson  the former  Cub Sluggers  skin looks  startingly lighter  in photographs that  have been splashed  around the internet  since Friday  but Sosa's people  are claiming the  dramatic change is 
[01:39:30]  the result of a  skin rejuvenation  treatment  rejuvenation  now we know  what Michael  Jackson did  what does that  mean  does it affect  melanin  I mean  what the fuck  is skin  rejuvenation  let me see  he's not trying  to be Michael  Jackson  okay former  Cubs employee  blah blah blah  not touching  children  he's going  he's going through  a rejuvenation  process for  his skin  women have it  all of the time  he was surprised  he came out  looking so white  I thought it was  a body double  he was surprised  part of the photo  appearance is just  the lighting  no no no  no no  that doesn't  explain the 
[01:40:00]  fucking hairdo  that's a fucking  that's a whiter  guy's hairdo  yeah yeah  it's creepy  yeah he  color contacts  too  really  look at the eyes  so his eyes  aren't that dark  brown anymore  look I  wow  that's a guy  that's a weird  look as far as  I'm concerned  guys that do  that shit to  themselves  unless they got  like vitiligo  that's like a  weird self-hatred  yeah  that's a weird  and that's like  with the other  side  like that's  what all the  fucking horrible  treatment and  stuff  it made  it kind of  fucked like  black people up  where it's like  all of a sudden 
[01:40:30]  black is  should be changed  and yeah  it really  it gets it  did fuck people  up  right on  maybe  that's what  happens when  you stop  taking steroids  and everything  leaves  his cock  shrunk  he's a complete  white guy  he fucking  looked down  his dick  was awful  he was always  white  there's the steroids  that made him  black  cigars  what's up  buddy  hey good  morning opie  hey  hey jim  hey buddy  go back to the  sanitizing of movies  yeah  the movie studios  can't even show an  actor smoking a 
[01:41:00]  cigarette without  getting a shitload  of pressure about  promoting tobacco  and everything else  and a lot of times  the character  would smoke  sure  so why can't the  character fucking  smoke  that shouldn't have  anything to do  with fucking  hollywood  it'll influence  the children  it'll make them  want to smoke  why  stop britney spears  she's doing some  damage out there  can we just take  entertainment  to the culture  for what it is  yeah  entertainment  yeah  it doesn't  everything doesn't  have to have a  message or affect  children or we  don't have to run  it through a  fucking strainer  so the children 
[01:41:30]  won't get  subjected to  violence or  sex or  what are we  supposed to do  for just  entertainment  I want it like  it was where  you know  language was  realistic and  raw  sexual content  is realistic  and just  fucking people  reacting with  people is  realistic  and with you  saying that  I'm going to  end this break  with something  that's going to  drive you  fucking nuts  that I heard  on Sirius XM  now we've been  petting the dog  a lot lately  I want to  acknowledge that  but roll up 
[01:42:00]  that fucking  newspaper  because we  got to hit  this company  on the nose  hard in a  little bit  a little bit  a little song  I heard  that I loved  about 10 years  ago  wow I didn't  even recognize  the song  no way  yeah I'll get  to it in a  second but we  got Josh in  D.C.  Josh  he's Josh  what's up  what's up  Josh  good evening  good evening  Jimmy you might  appreciate this  on Craigslist  if you ever  look at the  personals which  I'm not sure  if you do or  not  of course I  do  the women  seeking men 
[01:42:30]  they will  actually put  at the end  of their long  ad that says  something like  you know my  preference is  white guys  sorry not  being racist  and I didn't  know you had  to apologize  if you liked  a certain race  you know you  want to bang  a white chick  you want to  bang a black  chick  what difference  is why  they're racist  it's probably  I'll be honest  with you it's  probably because  that's not a  Craigslist mandate  it's simply  because they  probably don't  want hate mail  or what happens  on Craigslist  and it's kind  of a flaw  in the system  is you can 
[01:43:00]  flag posts  and I think  that it's such  a knee jerk  thing where  if you flag  a post  it comes  off  so they  probably  just don't  want to get  flagged  by black  guys  or Spanish  guys  and they  probably  just don't  want the  hassle of  reposting  white guys  only or black  guys only  you might get  flagged by people  who are annoyed  by that  so that's probably  just to  I'm guessing  but in normal  conversation  you have  with somebody  if I said  I only like  white chicks  or I only like  Puerto Rican chicks  you can get your  ass beat for that  you won't get  beat up for it  but it's okay 
[01:43:30]  the only time  people say that  is they're talking  about I only like  and they'll mention  another race  like if you talk  to some girls  like look I only  like black guys  or not dude  I only like  Spanish chicks  but people feel  guilty  let me correct  myself  white people feel  guilty saying  they only like  white girls  I only like  white girls  I only date  white girls  I only date  white girls  but I like  Spanish girls  too and black  girls I'm  attracted to  not as much  as white girls  I'm not attracted  I need like  pale girls  no man  I want to go  black so bad 
[01:44:00]  you're crazy  I want to go  black so bad  I fail miserably  that would look  really funny  in my attempt  I tried though  I went into  the black guy  I've told the story  a million times  this is how you know  Sam's not a piece of shit  this is how you know  Sam's not a real pig  I'm teaching him  how to fucking  google inside  of fucking  Craig's  because he didn't  think to do that  oh he didn't know  how to  aww Sam  he's so innocent  Danny would have  been fucking  balls deep in it  already  he'd have known  exactly  there would have  been some big 
[01:44:30]  cock and some  girl's fucking  shitter  within seconds  exactly  hey  alright  yeah  let's  oh my god  you guys are  killing me today  there's too many  good phone calls  let's try  Kevin in Poughkeepsie  Kevin  hey  how are we doing  pretty good  Kevin  hey  you guys are  talking about  scripts without  any balls  these days  how about that  movie A Time  to Kill  yeah  there's a scene  there's a scene  where the black  sheriff goes into  that redneck  bar  and obviously 
[01:45:00]  there's two guys  that just hurt  that little girl  and the sheriff  walks up  and the redneck  turns and calls  him hey  blue gums  get your monkey  ass out of this  bar  I mean could you  imagine if they  put A Time to Kill  on regular television  well that line  wouldn't be in  yeah  what the script  would look like  there'd be like  three pages  left of the script  well they always  fucked with movies  when it went to  regular TV  so I'm not really  bothered too much  by that  because they have  to worry about  the advertisers  on TV  but I am bothered  with like 
[01:45:30]  American Movie  Classic  because they  never did that  we heard the  stories of  Blockbuster  starting to edit  their fucking  tapes here and  there  for racial content  though they've  always edited  like SC-17 shit  yeah  there was some  there was some  there was some  fucking voodoo  going on  did you almost  say mumbo jumbo  yeah  mumbo jumbo  I'm fucking tired  from fucking  figuring out that  hornet's nest  yesterday  hey  do you guys  do you guys feel  though honestly  when you look at  movies that  depict southern life  they're really 
[01:46:00]  strong in content  using the word  nigger and blue gums  and this and that  but you got  Pelham 123  it's in New York  and there seems to be  a different audience  the way we handle  you know blacks  and sensitivity  when it comes to  New York  as compared to  the South  you know what  that's a fucking  good point  it's like  they're comfortable  making a southern  guy say it  right  but even a guy  who's taking  hostages in New York  maybe Travolta  refused to say  I imagine  he seems like  the type of 
[01:46:30]  fucking guy  that would do  that  but yeah  it's a great  point man  they are comfortable  making southern  people  fucking sound  like a bunch  of fucking  you know  but god forbid  it's a fucking  New York criminal  you're right  yeah  absolutely  Keeper Sutherland  destroys the black  race in that movie  I mean absolutely  destroys it  oh my god  yeah yeah  that was really  terrible  he's a totally  different person  yeah that was  oof  but you know what  that was the  character  that made  like when someone  says something so  offensive like that 
[01:47:00]  in a movie  it's supposed to be  you're supposed to  get that reaction  from the audience  like holy shit  that person is  fucked up  you know  and the only way  to convey it  is through the  dialogue  which has to  be fucked up  to show that  this person  is indeed  fucked up  Patrice has a  great point  I love when he  says about race  he goes  I've never met  a racist  meaning like  nobody has  ever  they exist  but yet nobody  comes out and  goes yeah  I'm right  like nobody  people are so 
[01:47:30]  fucking covert  people get tired  of Patrice  talking about race  sometimes on the  message  but I love what he  talks about  I know  it's a great  insight  he's completely  right  thank you Kevin  let's go to  Tony in Jersey  Tony let's do a  speed round here  because there's too  many calls coming  in  go ahead  don't whiz  just from a  different angle  thanks for calling  Tone  this doesn't make  it a speed round  go ahead buddy  that was the end  I skipped through  go ahead Tony  I'm sorry  what's up  good point  next caller  go go go 
[01:48:00]  go go  go go  no no  I'm not falling  for that again  that guy  Tony  he does  anything  no Tony  for real  we actually  want to hear  what you say  he doesn't  believe us  and he's  I was actually  going to listen  to him  you're the  little boy  that cried  wolf  I know  with fire  he says  that a lot  of actors  don't want  to be racist  in movies  because then  in real life  they'll be  portrayed as  racist people  I don't know  about that  it's funny  nobody ever  accused him  of murder 
[01:48:30]  in real life  it's funny  it's probably  true  half of these  fucking  sissy actors  I fucking  hate most  actors  most of them  have nothing  to say  we just  gotta push  back  as a  culture  we push  back  maybe in  your life  you can push  back a little  bit here and  there without  fucking up your  job or  or your life  in general  but when you  see an opportunity  to push back  you gotta just  push back a little  bit  same way  they don't get  fucking  the same way  comedians get  targeted  for saying what  we want  fucking actors  don't  like I'd love to  know the  Italian American  groups were  annoying too  because they 
[01:49:00]  targeted the  commercials  why aren't  they targeting  this fucking  sissy Travolta  movie  yeah exactly  where's the  Italian American  groups  outraged  that he  attacked  fucking  dagos  in the  radio world  not to  sound like  a broken  record again  but fuck  the stuff  we do  they're doing  in movies  but radio  guys aren't  allowed to do  it  and if I  have to hear  one more  person  when I ask  that question  say why  would they  attack  not actors  but us  radio guys  are comedians  well cause  you guys  are saying  what you  really  fuck you  so what  if you  write a  fucking  biography  film  how do  they  know  that's  not  your  real  thoughts  coming  through 
[01:49:30]  fuck  out of  here  with that  stupid  argument  radio guys  getting fired  for doing  Asian accents  I'll never  ever get over  that one  never  and then you  go and watch  a movie  in comedies  and they're  doing the  Asian accent  getting huge  laughs  what is the  fucking  difference  someone's  bringing up  no one thinks  that Norton  is a racist  because of  American History X  but he was  redeemed in the  end and it  showed with  the bad thing  he did with  his brother  and the  other young  black boys 
[01:50:00]  the redeeming  that movie  kind of worked  out too  you're like  oh my god  you know what  though  I watched  that movie  and you  stop it  at half hour  before the end  I turn it off  and I think  it's a fantastic  movie  his speech  to Elliot Gould  at that  fucking dinner  table  is fantastic  it's fan  fucking  fantastic  oh you found  something  it's five minutes  long though  that's gonna  kill us today  I didn't make  the clip  and people  would be 
[01:50:30]  offended by  this  but it's  the character  and the look  he's given  fucking gold  man  this is one  of his best  movies  he was so  fucking  believable  in this movie  bullshit  it's exactly  what happened  in this trial  too  because the  media twisted  things around  so people  got all  focused on  these cops  and whether  or not  they were  going to  get convicted  Rodney King  Rodney King's  civil rights  had been  violated  everybody  lost sight  of Rodney King  himself  the guy's  a multiple  felon  by his own  admission  he's high  as a god damn  kite  driving 120 miles 
[01:51:00]  an hour  down the highway  he gets pulled  over by a bunch  of cops  and he attacks  them  he attacked  police officers  that's the  bottom line  and he walked  yeah  there's some  yahoo  there  with a  video  camera  who  turned it  on  halfway  through  so that  all we  see  is them  hitting  him  that's  some horrible  acting right there  who was a ball  and we're saying  he was kicking  him in the back  of the skull  so it looks  severe  you know  and people  are going  oh  this poor  guy  this poor  guy  who attacked  four cops  and those  cops end up  on the stand  defending themselves  for using  absolutely  standard 
[01:51:30]  textbook  self-defense  procedures  I don't think  that the tape  showed that  at all  you didn't think  so huh  and what  you're an  authority  ma  murray  what do you  think  murray  murray  is shocked  at this point  murray's like  what did I  get myself  into  elliot gould  obviously  jewish  is sitting  at this  table  murray  just in case  it wasn't  obvious  they gave  him the  name  murray  I'm surprised  jeewy  what do you 
[01:52:00]  think  murray  we got it  he's jewish  jesus christ  the murray  moneylender  what do you  think  and at this  point he's  like I know  the pussy's  good but I  have to deal  with this  shit  fuck that  edward  norton  in that scene  dude how  good is  fucking  norton  in that scene  everything  the way  he delivers  the lines  and the  look he  gives  murray  is fantastic  and he's  being rational  yeah yeah  oh yeah  he's a smart  dude he's not  a fucking idiot  exactly  why is the  mom from  christmas  vacation in  this movie  what the fuck  i'm waiting  for chevy chase 
[01:52:30]  to pop out  what a set  of tits on  her  beverly d'angelo  had some  nice melons  in her  pacino's lady  they were  right  yeah  used to be  oh she used  to be okay  they had some  fucking problems  we gotta hear  elliott gold's  response  the jewish  fellow  murray  murray  good old  murray  murray's shocked  look and then  he starts talking  hold on shame  by the way  i did think  that the police  used their clubs  rather excessively  who are you to  say what's excessive  i think it was  totally appropriate  i think they're  in a better position 
[01:53:00]  to make that  judgment call  than you are  in fact we  as society grant  cops a certain  amount of  authority to make  those calls  because we  acknowledge that  their job is  difficult and  dangerous  you know  unfortunately very  few people like  respect that  respect that  authority  look who's  talking about  respect here  mr jr kkk  what  what you want to go  to college  you should learn  to listen  you should learn  i acknowledge  the cops  authority  i don't respect  any laws that  let monkeys  like rodney  came back  on the street  second of all  i am not 
[01:53:30]  as you well  know  a member  of a low  rent  disorganized  bunch of  rednecks  like the  fucking  kkk  please  so take  your head  out of  your ass  i mean  you've gotten  off the point  i had a point  and that wasn't  even the point  do you have one  what is your  point derek  all right  think about  this  think about  this  if danny had  been walking  across the street  that night  and rodney  king had  plowed into  can we just  drop this  rodney king  thing  there's so much  tension at this  table  god is he good 
[01:54:00]  though  i don't think  they're having  dessert  who would like  some dessert  yeah stop it  there that's a good  that's a good point  that just keeps  going  god damn it  no he laces  into him  when he laces  into elliacool  get to the part  where he laces  into murray  he just fucking  has had it  with murray  fucking his  mother  let me tell you  something  he is not  at all happy  that murray  is joining  them for dinner  no  kill anybody  thank god  lie down  okay  ali's  sleeping  so sad though 
[01:54:30]  i mean come on  think about it  monkey  run some  kid over  everybody would  have a very  different opinion  of this whole  matter  you know  they'd be  focused on  murray  not on  these officers  but instead  he just  attacked a few  cops  and so all  of a sudden  it's hands  across america  for this  fucking total  son of a  bitch  it blows my  mind  we're so hung  up on this  notion that we  have some  obligation to  help the  struggling  black man  you know  cut him some  slack until he  can overcome  these historical  injustices  it's crap  this stuff you  guys are saying 
[01:55:00]  just perpetuates  it all this  liberal nonsense  you know  everyone's  turning and  looking the  other way  while our  country rots  from the  inside out  christ lincoln  freed the  slaves what  like 130  years ago  how long does  it take to  get your act  together  jews have been  persecuted for  over 5,000 years  are you saying  that it's wrong  to feel sensitive  about anti-semitism  and then the  look Edward  Norton gives  old Murray  right after  that line  he's looking  and I'm like  well you said  it motherfucker 
[01:55:30]  you said it  we just gotta  find that  fucking piece  where he lays  into them  that's a great  fucking Edward  Norton in that  it's delivered  so rationally  and without rage  that's so fucking  good man  here's him  losing it on  Murray  takes his  fucking shirt  off  now he shows  his swastika  tat  this is your  family  right my  family  my family  so you know  what I don't  give two shits 
[01:56:00]  about you  or anybody  else or what  you think  you're not a  part of it  and you never  will be  that has  nothing to  do with it  oh it  doesn't  you don't  think I see  what you're  trying to do  here you think  I'm gonna  sit here and  smile while  some fucking  kite tried  to fuck  my mother  never gonna  happen  Murray  fucking  forget it  not on my  watch  not while I'm  in this  family  I will  fucking  cut your  shylock  nose off  and stick  it up  your ass  before I  let that  happen  coming in  here  and poisoning  my family's  dinner with  your Jewish  nigger loving  hippie bullshit  oh this isn't 
[01:56:30]  a clip  this was my  house last  night  fuck you  yeah walk  out  asshole  fucking  kibala  motherfucker  get the  fuck out  of my  house  there goes  murray  murray  he's not  welcome  he's not  he's not  welcome  murray's gotta  go  thank you for  dinner  goodbye murray  can i call  you  that's a  tough one  holy shit 
[01:57:00]  that's a great  scene though  fucking  i forgot how  unbelievable  edward norton is  in this movie  man  he's a good  actor that  motherfucker  god damn it  is he fucking  good  yeah let's go  to dave in  jersey  dave  yeah hi  how you  doing  hey man  i just  wanted to  make the  point that  when quentin  tarantino made  pulp fiction  20 years ago  spike lee and  everybody got all  over him that  he didn't have  the right  to use the  n word  he was a  white  director 
[01:57:30]  hold on  can i jump  in just  not that you're  wrong  spike did  give him  shit  but quentin  tarantino to  me goes the  other way  i love  tarantino  but he uses  nigger like  i'm gonna be  the hip white  guy that  can get away  with it  it's almost  it doesn't  make sense  some of the  places he  uses it  like hey  did that say  nigger drop  but it's  almost like  that that  part was a  little stupid  it didn't ring  true to me  but but uh  the you're  talking to two  murderers that  didn't ring  true it was 
[01:58:00]  just him  wanting to be  the hip white  guy that can  that can say  what he wants  like i almost  i don't agree  with spike  telling him  he shouldn't  say it  but i almost  understood the  sentiment behind  it he was  tarantino was  just awful in  that anyway  because because  it was too  sensitive to  hear from a  white guy just  saying nigger  arbitrarily  arbitrarily meaning  it was just  pointless and it  was so obvious  and i think he  said in every  one of his  appearances  tarantino says  nigger which 
[01:58:30]  again he has the  right to in his  movies but i just  feel like it  didn't help  the cat it  wasn't like  there was a  moment where  you would yell  that you  wouldn't if  two guys bring  over fucking  bodies say  hey right  because to me  the reveal that  his wife was  black almost  was such a  shallow reveal  but it was  obvious as to  why he did  it was to be  gratuitous  exactly  but if it  yeah his wife  was black so  i guess that  was some  justification  but if he  was a black  director and  arbitrarily said  the word nigger 
[01:59:00]  it you know just  as a stutter  maybe but also  again part of  it is realism  two guys  standing there  in blood who  just shot  somebody you  might say one  time you  brought that  nigger to my  house but you  wouldn't did  this he said  so casually it  was just didn't  ring true and  to me the  fucking part that  made it really  gratuitous was the  reveal that  bonnie was black  right that made  it phony it's  like okay see  he's not racist  because he's  married to a 
[01:59:30]  black girl so  he can use that  word over and  over and over  again i see  jimmy's point  dennis hopper  using it in  i'm sorry in  true romance  which i think  tarantino wrote  the screenplay  for that was  not gratuitous  it was a guy  basically committing  suicide yes  uh suicide by  word and i don't  think you heard a  lot of shit about  that suicide by  prostate cancer  that was fucking  uh oh jeez  do you know what  i'm saying though  dude too soon  dude do you  understand what i  mean like i i  think that in  hopper's role i  know i know i  just wanted to make 
[02:00:00]  another point like  with remaking  these movies from  1970 or 1960  uh new york city  like if they  remade serpico  with those like  um cop cars  what were they  like um  chevy impalas  yeah the old  the old ones with  the siren out the  single siren on the  top yeah i mean  you know how can  they remake those  movies there are  certain movies  there are certain  movies that can't 
[02:00:30]  be remade just  because the time  is different and  it's almost like it  was a period piece  if you look at  taking a pill in  one two three  there was that  gritty fucking  old new york that  you remember and  it's just like isn't  around it's not like  that anymore and  that that it's not  like that unless you  want to replicate you  know the actual  historic scenery then  you're talking about  doing a period piece  pretty much instead of  a remake and updating  it to to now you're  talking about bringing  in old cop cars and  and and old uniforms 
[02:01:00]  and and doing it  remaking it that way  um yeah and you  know why they made  pelham one two three  don't you because of  the whole terrorist  the idea of they're  going to attack the  transit system next  oh the guy's white  he does he right so  it's kind of loosely  based on that fear  that we all have right  now but of course  they wouldn't make  it with like some  kind of extremist  you know they make  it with travolta who's  italian so then hence  he could do the italian  fucking rant there  or germans and  russians are always  safe bad guys too  oh yeah the russian 
[02:01:30]  bad guy  but in the original  there wasn't any  ranting there was  just uh that new  york walter matthow  uh excellent performance  yeah uh you know  disinterested cops  solving this crime  and um i don't know  how they made the  remake i didn't  they tried to make a  real thrill it like  a real action movie  out of it instead  of a thriller that  was originally a  fucking thriller god  damn it you were 
[02:02:00]  and that is a  difference yeah where  you were like oh  man this is a cool  fucking movie i'm at  the edge of my seat  because of the the  dialogue and and and  what with the  situation that's going  on not because you  know cops are racing  down the fucking road  trying to get to uh  the south side of  manhattan a lot of  thrillers didn't have a  lot of action yeah yeah  it was all they had  just enough it was  psychological right it  was more psychological  you're so right the  dialogue got into your  psyche yeah huh yeah  walter matthow like had  the same uh attitude you 
[02:02:30]  didn't know that he was  solving the crime but the  thriller was in in his  acting performance yep and  and and and the and the  reveal at the end that he  put it all together you  know they knock on that  guy's apartment door yeah  yeah yeah can i wait  hold on can we see  because he has dead  nigger storage that's  seen from uh pulp with  from from pulp fiction  hey hey guys i just  gotta say i love your  show and i love it you  guys really uh make my  day you make my afternoon 
[02:03:00]  you make my evening you  make my weekend thank you  sir very much i play it  on repeat uh it's really  it's great you guys are  great wow right then don't  go to a fan site because  you'll get very confused  thanks buddy you'll actually  get very confused and go  wow is that the same  fucking radio show i  listen to because i'm  confused but i do want to  say that uh uh jimmy  sounded a little bit uh  like he wanted to suck  ed norton stick on what  a great actor he was in  uh he really is fucking  great but i did i actually 
[02:03:30]  i've always liked edward  norton but i never really  raved and went ballistic  about norton i just forgot  at that moment like god  like the way he does that  it's so easy to have  started that scene he ends  it very angry yeah yeah but  to start that scene the  temptation with that  dialogue and believe me i've  read scripts is i'm so  awful i would start that  off going that fucking  rodney king but he's like  he's logical yeah he's  talking it out what the  fuck i mean the guy did  this he ran and you're  listening to him going he's  a smart dude and he really  believes what he's saying  that's a tough dude to 
[02:04:00]  argue with yeah that's a  tough guy to argue why  don't you play why don't  you play are you some  excellent clips of edward  norton in the uh remake of  the hulk i didn't see that  all right are we at  dead nigger soldier they're not  old thanks dave with that  all right we'll see you  next time dave thank you  oh my god endless with  this fucking guy goodbye  thank you thanks dave  good phone call we'll get  you next time fuck it's  fucking endless let's hear  this  let's knock it off julie  what i don't need you to  tell me how fucking good my  coffee is okay i don't 
[02:04:30]  know who buys it i know  how good it is  bonnie goes shopping she  buys shit i buy the  gourmet expensive stuff  because when i drink it i  want to taste it but you  know what's on my mind  right now it ain't the  coffee in my kitchen what  is it it's the dead nigger in  my garage oh jimmy don't even  worry about anything i want to  ask you a question when you  came pulling in here did you  notice a sign up in front of my  house that said dead nigger  storage jimmy you know i see no  shit did you notice a sign in the  front of my house that said dead  nigger storage  no i didn't you know why you 
[02:05:00]  didn't see that sign  why because it ain't there because  storing dead niggers ain't my  fucking business that's why  jewels let's break this down how do  you do that i mean you think  easily but samuel samuel jackson  sitting there going i want to  fucking knock this guy out you  don't care you don't care you  think he did snakes on a plane  please samuel jackson was made  from this movie he probably  samuel probably said you should  say that one more time  yeah that was an overuse of the  word absolutely and it was  obvious but the first time he 
[02:05:30]  said it like uh this is the  nigger mike that are you  reacting it's you say something  crazy but i like the thing about  the coffee better it was fucking  coffee is by the way a hysterical  scene in that fire damn and  then and then when the wolf comes  over and takes a sip and has to  look over and tip his head and  acknowledge that it's good coffee  and he wasn't even in on the  conversation that's so great and  the fact that he says well bonnie  buy shit like he gets annoyed at  his wife for buying bad coffee but  that was an overuse it what did he  do in uh did he do it in in  reservoir dogs um the only one i 
[02:06:00]  think was no that was uh steve  bushemi uh when they're fighting  oh yeah that was come on we're  professionals here you're acting  like a bunch of niggas yeah he  said that but uh i don't think it  was overused at all no that was  you're right i never even thought  of that but that is kind of an  overuse of that in front of my  house that said dead african  american storage did you notice a  sign in the front of my house that  said dead african american storage  no you know why you didn't see that  sign because storing dead african  americans ain't my fruity to  tootin business 
[02:06:30]  tv edit uh we love the tv  tootu that's funny  well we should take a break yeah i  gotta wish desperately my  observation isn't as great now but  which observation well it was a  song i'll tell you the song ever  last what it's like yeah remember  that song was pretty fucking cool  man had a nice little groove to it  and there's a lot of drug  references and yeah yeah yeah and  i'm listening to sirius xm on the  way home a couple days ago from 
[02:07:00]  long island and that song's on i'm  like fuck i like this song i turn it  up i was i was enraged by the end  of it because i'm like this is  satellite radio is this the version  they play travis from the master  computer yeah this is the one from  the 90s channel oh yeah 90s on 9 is  not an exile channel so they is it  profoundly they're taking out  pause this pause this it's the same  as it's the same they program the  same as terrestrial radio i have to  talk to they take out drug  references but this song was on the  radio for years as is why the who 
[02:07:30]  decided then drug references have to  be knocked out of these songs they  take all that's different than an  xl fucking channel drugs gang  culture guns who decided this shit  are all taken out why do they have  commercials on there no dude what the  fuck's the use then let regular radio  destroy themselves don't do it to  satellite radio we don't have to do  this as a company and we've been  petting the dog a lot lately don't do  this to yourselves unless it's 
[02:08:00]  profanity where you wouldn't be able  to play it in a store i know now it's  worth it listen to this song listen to  this i don't know the original oh yeah  count how many times they beat this thing  so the curse word goes now  they know satellite radio the one so far 
[02:08:30]  and then you really might know what it's  take this is where it gets crazy  take this is where it gets crazy 
[02:09:00]  like who's complaining that they can't play the original song anymore  that's a ball  I don't even know what that 
[02:09:30]  I can't say whore anymore  They beat that whore?  Yeah, yeah  Keep listening  This drove me nuts  It's okay she got pregnant out of wedlock 
[02:10:00]  But you can't call her whore  Yeah  I don't even know what it's like  Then you really might know what it's like  Then you really might know what it's like  I've seen a rich man beg  I've seen a good man sin  I've seen a tough man cry  I've seen a loser win  And a sad man grin 
[02:10:30]  I heard an honest man lie  I've seen a good side or bad  It's a downside and up  And everything in between  I lit a silver spoon  Drank from the golden cup  And smoked the finest green  Green  Green  They cut out smoking green?  Finest green  No drug reference  You know where it is  So usually it depends on where you start  What the fuck are you guys doing? 
[02:11:00]  Don't make the same mistakes as regular radio  You dummies  Drugs  Drugs  I don't even know what that word was  It's supposed to be  Shit based  Talk shit  Now his wife and his kids are taught 
[02:11:30]  In the midst of all of his pain  You know it comes that way  At least that's what they say  When you play the game  If you ever had to wake up  To hear the news  Then you really might know  What it's like  To have to do  Then you really might know  What it's like  Then you really might know 
[02:12:00]  What it's like  Then you really might know  What it's like  When it's not  To have to do  I get the point  It's  I don't know  That is revolting  It really is, right?  Can I say this?  I don't mind  If they take out profanity  Because most  Like FCC shit  Because this kind of  Cuts off  An angle  The fucking  They can come after  Satellite with  And also you couldn't  Play it in stores 
[02:12:30]  I understand that  And they have a channel  I guess where you could  Hear that unedited  You know  I think it plays  Unedited on lithium  Yeah, so the 90s channel  Is kind of one of those channels  That they do probably want on  In stores and things  Fine  But the drug references  To take out the socially  Inappropriate references  Whoever's fucking making  That programming decision  You've got to be ashamed  Of yourself  The cursing I get  But if it's not  An FCC violation  You should absolutely  Not be taking it out  Exactly  And someone wrote  That's the only version  They've ever heard 
[02:13:00]  That's embarrassing  And I believe the guy  Because I'm sure  They've been  You know  Playing the clean version  Of that song  For a long time now  But when we've  Originally played that  Either at AAF  Or maybe NAW  It was around that time  I think  I think that song  Is about 97  98 I think  No man  They just bleeped  A couple curses out  And that was it  What's the name of that song  What it's like  By Everlast  I know it's Steve Blatt  But I don't think  Steve just took over  The VP of music  I don't think  He's making those decisions  I was actually  Going to call him  And ask him  Because he's pretty rational  He'd have a reason 
[02:13:30]  At least  It's just stupid  That's the mistakes  That fucking  Satellite radio  That regular radio makes  We were in radio there  When they actually played  Who the fuck are you  And actually let it play  Right  In that who song  Right  Like who the fuck are you  Who  It's very obvious  It's not hidden  It's very loud  That used to be  On regular radio  Yeah  And they put it  On regular radio  Because fuck it  It's in a song  Who cares  Yeah I guess  I can't argue  The curse part  Of that argument  But certainly 
[02:14:00]  Yeah the drug stuff  You should be able  To say whore  You should be able  To have the drug references  The songs about that stuff  That's mind boggling  At that point  I guess you don't even  Play the song  On the 90's channel  Yeah  I'm pissed that they  Don't even try to play  The house next door to me  Which you know  You never get through  Well I got it on my iPods  I don't know why  They would just make  The same mistakes  That is killing  Regular radio  I don't know why  They would go down that road  That's just dumb  Silly  That's just fucking dumb 
[02:14:30]  Curses is one thing  But you know  Talking about drugs  And someone is a whore  Cause that's social stuff  That the FCC  Can't come at  That's where  They're fucking up  That's where  They've gotten so soft  And they just refuse  To  And this is television too  They just refuse  To say  No no  It's appropriate  It's what the artist said  That's why it's so easy  To leave right after our show  I can't  I can't  I can't  I can't do it to myself  I know  It's infuriating  I can't have them  Pull me in  I can't have them 
[02:15:00]  Pull the show  Into that crap  That'll never happen  Never  Really  No  The changes  With our show  That's true  With all the stuff  We used to be able to do  It's happening to us  There's a difference  We're holding on  As best we can  Trust me  We can  But I'm saying  As far as lawyers  Stepping in  And stopping things  That's what lawyers do  They're shit  But I mean  As far as what we're saying  The break we just did  On fucking  On that  They'll never be able  To stop that  That was nice  Yeah  That's just what it is  Yeah well we had to  Change as a show 
[02:15:30]  You know what I mean  Because they took  All our bits away  That's the point I'm making  They did take all that stuff  Away from us  But the day you can't  Discuss socially relevant things  In you know  A language that everybody  Understands  With the use of  Any words that are  Available to you  In context  Then there's trouble  Like you know  Talking about racial issues  And things like that  Without inciting  Then there'll be problems  I'm walking out  Don't make peepees  I'm gonna eat  Alright we're all gonna  Make peepees and shit 
[02:16:00]  N word gotta eat  Literally shit  That's what I say  You're gonna make peepees  And shit  Alright  Now the phone's lit on this  We might have to continue  With this after the break  Stay there  Opie and Anthony  I want to  Like an animal  I have horrendous timing  During the break  I went to the bathroom  Yeah  And there was a  Surprise visitor in there  Anthony Cumia  Who rarely takes  Bathroom breaks  I had to make

[02:22:30]  I wish I got their reaction  Spin the camera around  But in general  I was surprised  They kind of went with it  My favorite part  Of that story  Is my wife came back  With cocos  For everyone  You don't think  I said it in that way  To get thrown  Under the bus  For a second or two  Aw sweetie  Wanted a cocoa  Sweetie wanted a cocoa  It was chili  By the ice  Holy shit  I didn't even realize that  Alright let's get  Into some other things  20 years today  What happened  Ant  Let's do a little trivia  20 years ago today 
[02:23:00]  Yes  Would have been  Nineteen hundred  And eighty  Nine  What happened to the  Aught part  There's no aught  Because why  Nineteen  Eight  Let's see because  It's just an eighty nine  How did you do the aught  If it was nineteen ninety  I would have said  Nineteen hundred and nine aught  Oh I got it  I don't know  Or nineteen aught six  Oh it's zero aught  Yeah aught  Twenty years ago today 
[02:23:30]  What is it  Twenty years ago  We're talking  Nineteen eighty nine  Let me think  The  Um  The  Uh  Berlin Wall  Came down  Give yourself  Wow good call  Is it really  Yeah  Smart guy  Jesus  And  And you can count on radio  To take  An amazing event  Like the uh  Coming down to the Berlin Wall  And make it into a promotion 
[02:24:00]  Um  I was doing radio in Buffalo  And the big thing was  Oh no  Radio companies got a lot of pieces of the wall  And then broke it up  And then gave it to their listeners  Giveaways  If they were the tenth caller  I actually found my piece of the Berlin Wall recently  And they even  They even slapped  Slapped a logo on the fucking thing  They were  This is like  This was a pretty serious thing  One of the biggest  Uh  Moments  In  History  Right  Uh  And they 
[02:24:30]  They  Bastardized it  Into a  Fucking radio promotion  I'll bring my piece in  It has the little logo  It was uh  Side piece  Or you got a  What piece was it from the wall  This will be the  Was it from the front  The top  The back  The side piece  Yeah  No I'm talking about the wall  Oh okay  The Berlin Wall  They slapped the Fox logo  I was working for a Fox station at the time  Oh  A little Fox logo on it  You know  That's fantastic  So that happened 20 years ago  That's great  The last one we'll say last  Because I know that'll get a discussion going 
[02:25:00]  Which is fine  Oh my god  Do you have any uh  Omaha Beach uh  Shell casing  Fucking key fobs  With from the station  With the radio station logo  Any of those  Fuck  Do they pick up some of those maybe  Leave it to radio  To bastardize something  That was really important  Horrid asses  Uh  Joe Perry says he thinks  Steven Tyler quit Aerosmith  But he's not sure  That came out today  He thinks  But  Something's going on with Steven Tyler  Is he back on the dope  Real  No way  I'm asking  I don't know for sure  But something 
[02:25:30]  I would  I would think  No way  He's been off so long  Yeah  Something's going on with uh  Steve Perry  Maybe he's sick  Didn't he have a fucking uh  Steve Perry  Hip uh  Joe Perry  Joe Perry  And Steven Tyler  Huh  Didn't he have like hip replacement  Or some shit  Which one  Um  Steven Tyler  I don't know  We just  You know we just go off on speculation here  Well  Then we'll call it  I'm going to say yes  Yes  Wasn't he arrested for raping children  Bob  Just going to say  And no one's paying attention  So we'll go yeah  I heard that  Meaning we have no idea what you're talking about  You're fucking idiots 
[02:26:00]  Uh  A Christmas Carol  Number one at the box office  Who's in that  Jim Carrey  Yeah  That looks horrible  I saw the preview  Well I saw the preview of it  Yeah it's like a 3D animation  Jim Carrey does multiple voices I think  Oh wow  The preview looks hard  Jim Carrey  And Jim Carrey  And Jim Carrey  Okay  Sam you see This Is It  Yeah I saw This Is It  I saw it  Michael Jackson  Fucking  Did we talk about this  No  Why would you see that  First of all  Why  It was a good movie  Shut up it wasn't 
[02:26:30]  Why would you see it  Well because I would see a concert movie  Of any artist that I  You know was a fan of  And this is the concert movie  And let me tell you something  Michael Jackson's This Is It  Would have maybe been  The greatest concert of all time  If he could have pulled it off  Like the rehearsal  I think he's still going to  I don't think he's done  You don't think so  Nope  He brought out Jackson 5 songs  He did every hit he's ever done  It was incredible  Did he  Yeah  80% on Rotten Tomatoes huh  It was a great movie  And you got to see him like  How did they make it into a great movie  They just had some fucking  They pumped this out so fast 
[02:27:00]  They had practice footage  Yeah  How did they make it into a great movie  Well first of all  There was no body doubles  Like one Joseph Jackson said  But they  Oh excuse me  We'll take your word over  Michael's father  Michael's father  Who wants an allowance  From the fucking  From his son's fucking estate  He wants what  150,000 a month  He wants some money  Because the kids get money  The sister gets money  For taking care of the kids  Like it's all  Worked out from Michael's will  And Joe apparently  Was not in Michael's will  So now Joe is 
[02:27:30]  Saying he deserves an allowance  Like he didn't  Earn enough money  Fucking that kid up  Through his childhood  To maybe leave the corpse alone  He's rifling through the pockets  In the coffin  That's a great way to put it  Scumbag  But no  This is it  It was a great movie  You got to see him do like  Dress rehearsal  Stuff  Of pretty much every performance  Most of the performances  You got to see him do  And they said he was too drugged out 
[02:28:00]  To even practice  Hell no  Hell no  Hell no  Hell no  He was in control  Of the rehearsals too  You got to see him  Working with the dancers  Telling them exactly  What he wanted  Do this here  Do that there  No the cue is this  The cue is that  He was not  He was with it  It really is good  He was great  He was on  The motherfucker  Yeah  What are you writing Jimmy  Just a thought for a joke  Oh  I thought you were writing down  Like reminder  Go see this is it  I actually should  Write it down  Everybody  I will see it  I want to see it  Because I'm talking about it on stage  You got to see it for the radio show 
[02:28:30]  See it because you want to see it  I'm starting to like do stuff  That maybe I can bring to the radio show  I thought after all these years  It might be smart  To see some of these hit movies  And maybe talk about it on our radio show  It might be brought up tonight on Red Eye  Which I'm doing  I'm not sure  That's it  You're definitely doing Red Eye  You're just not sure you're going to bring this up  Yeah I am  Okay I don't want people to be confused  Pat from Menaki is right  It's not called A Christmas Carol  This Jim Carrey movie  It's called The Past, The Present, and Irene  Oh that's true 
[02:29:00]  There were a lot of tears in the theater  For This Is It  Of course  A lot of tears  People are going to go into this movie  I would see it though  Because I'm saying it's probably going to stink  But maybe it's interesting  I don't know  No it's great  I'd have no interest in seeing  That Michael Jackson  This Is It  No interest  But it's not like  He sings  Some of the songs you can tell  He's lip syncing  Because obviously he's not going to sing  Full force or rehearsal  And the other songs  You can see he's half singing them  And they don't hide the fact  That he's half singing 
[02:29:30]  Yeah  It's more to get the rhythm  Of the dancing down right  Yeah and you can tell  That he could  But you can tell he could still sing  He could still sing  He could still completely dance  Now?  Yeah  No not now  Oh okay  I was confused  I thought you meant now  In his coffin  No like before he died  Okay  Do they do any dead stuff?  No  What do you mean dead stuff?  You know he died  Do they throw that in the movies  In some way or another?  No no no  They just say  Showing the ambulance  With the fucking lights going  And the movie is a credits roll  A celebration of his life 
[02:30:00]  It's just a documentary  Of the making of the tour  It's not a documentary  And did you hear  Oh Jesus  Wait  Oh my god  We are looking at something horrific  Wait  Before you move on  Because it just made me laugh openly  Eric from Virginia Tech  Wants to know  If it's a Lionsgate movie  Oh that's true  Z-Boy will not be seeing it  If it's Lionsgate  Is it Lionsgate?  I do not think that it's Lionsgate  Thank god  That was fucking so psychotic  He is  Of course  That break with Derek  Was so psychotic 
[02:30:30]  He refuses to see Lionsgate movies  Lionsgate movies  He just doesn't like them at all  Alright so maybe we see  This is it  I don't know  I'll go back and see it with you guys  If you want  I would not see it  I'll see it again  I want to  Larry King loved  The fourth kind  Oh yeah that looks good  The fourth kind  Was that good?  I haven't seen it  But it looks good  I'll see it this weekend  That apparently is a  Think about alien abduction  It's only got 16%  Any anal probing?  Is there that hack  Anal probing  Going to be going on?  Or the big needle 
[02:31:00]  They put through the belly button?  Mila Jovovich  Betty and Barney Hill  That mixed race couple  That was taken by aliens  Fucking yes  Hey why didn't Jovovich  Come by to promote  This horse shit?  She wasn't  Jesus  Maybe that's why  She wasn't in the building  No?  Yeah  Well I don't think  She did a lot of promotion  For this movie  It's only getting 16%  Positive reviews  Now I only thought  There were three kinds  No no no no no  First is  Citing  Yes  Second  Is  Evidence 
[02:31:30]  Yes  Third  Of course we remember  From the old movie  Is  Contact  Fourth  Abduction  Is abduction  Now when did they  Fucking come up with that?  They did before  But they just didn't mention it  No no  They didn't mention it in close account  It was a third kind  They just said third kind  Right because that was  They didn't want to distract  But then it was fourth kind  Because they were abducted  That was what the whole  Fucking movie was about  Not really  You can't just say not really  You gotta back it up  With something  The fucking navy flyers  That disappeared  In the train of planes 
[02:32:00]  And then the ships  All the people on the ships  And then little  Little fucking  The little boy  It's about the song at the end  The song that they play  And that's  Yeah  That's contact  Fourth kind  Is anal probing  Yeah  Definitely gotta be anal probing  If there is an anal probing  In fourth kind  If Mila Jovovich  Does not get anally probed  Let me check  I will never watch that movie  And Stephen S. says  That the fifth kind  Is interracial marriage  So  Okay  What? 
[02:32:30]  Too much?  Too soon?  What?  Yeah I don't see anything  About anal probing  All right  Pat from Motaki  Says  Close encounters  Of the Ron kind  Very good one  Pat you fuck  Pat was in here on Friday  He was doing a pretty good job  Linger a bit longer  Hey  And the men who stare at goats  Who the fuck has seen this horse  You know  It's really good  Something  Something compelling  Something about it you like  Something I like about it  Yes  Men and goats  I've seen the preview 
[02:33:00]  Four or five times  I don't understand the movie  I think it's some type  Of secret  Government project  Where people use their minds  How about they let us in  On the secret a little bit  Well I kind of like  That the trailer  Left me thinking like  I don't know what this is about  But I'm kind of  Compelled  I want to see it  I actually know  Oh Travis wants to talk  What Travis?  No I was going to whisper  In Sam's ear  That Steve saw it  If you guys want to review  Oh I saw it  Yeah oh no shit  He saw the men  Who stare at goats  He thought it was goatees  What a freak 
[02:33:30]  Yes hello  You're staring at me  Yes  No I  This is actually a good movie  Because like  What happens is  Every time they ask this guy  A question  He goes  Oh my god  Guys here comes  Fat John Travolta  From Pelham 123 now  Jesus  It's Pelham 625  There you go 
[02:34:00]  It's Pelham  789  Look at how fat he is  Oh shit Sam  Just joining in  I just joined in  Alex Borson  Steve on the radio  How bad is this movie  The men who stare at goats  Good  It's alright  I mean all the funny parts  I will tell you  Are in the trailer  Is it a comedy?  It's one of those quirky movies  Because he said the same thing  About the woodsman  That's a good movie 
[02:34:30]  All the sexy parts  Are in the trailer  You and Travolta  Look the same  I was doing this first  You know what they say  About Travolta  He took my look  He's a terrible producer  Oh shit  Oh my god  Holy fuck  Yes  Oh my god  What's the minister at goats about?  It is  The army apparently developed  A secret branch of soldiers  That were supposed to be  Jedi warriors  That developed psychic powers 
[02:35:00]  And one of them  One of them  George Clooney  Was so skilled at it  He could stare at a goat  For hours on end  To make its heart stop  Yes  And that was one of his  One of his powers  And they were all led  By Jeff Bridges  Who was the  Funny  Parts  Sounds terrible for comedy  Parts  It's a long  What was the movie  That he did with  It's almost like  A Coen Brothers movie  Right right  Burn after reading  It's very much like  Burn after reading  That movie rolled  It was okay  It was okay  But you have to go through 
[02:35:30]  Periods of quirky  Followed by very funny  Like Jeff Bridges  Jumping off a roof  And missing a pile  Of mattresses  And whining the whole time  And in between that  There's just quirky  Monologues  By him  And  You have to  Wait through all the  Annoying talking  To hear the funny man  Fall down  Yes  Yeah  It's a long wait  But the banana peel scene  Is worth it  It's a long wait  In between funny  Just stay for the 
[02:36:00]  Pie fight at the end  Yes  He has a pie  And he goes  Give it to me  Give it to me  How many lumps  Do you take  With your coffee  Was hysterical  The little hammer  All right  I'm not seeing  This fucking movie  I don't know  Sam's gonna sum it up  There  Homeboy fell down 
[02:36:30]  On his ass  On the stairs  Did you see  Dude  Find the fucking one  There's a YouTube video  Of a fat lady  Stepping up on a table  To dance  Oh yeah  We've all seen that  Oh it's fantastic  The greatest thing  I've ever seen  She falls down  And just starts  Moaning in pain  This is the greatest  Video ever  Wow  Great lady  Is still up there  She's a big fat lady  Up on a table  Doing her thing  Wow 
[02:37:00]  She cracks her head  In her ass  It's almost  Three million views  You couldn't fall better  Dude she hits you  Had to answer  On the fucking heart  Directing it 
[02:37:30]  That's the greatest thing  I've ever seen  That clip was put together  It was great  Dude this is three million  How many do the other ones have  Because there's like  Ten versions of it  Holy shit  That is so funny  They repeated  30,000  Oh my god  Oh did she  Watch that one more time  Her sing  It's the best  Oh did she fucking go down  God is that great  That's a ton of shit  Falling down  How many step forward  And they show her 
[02:38:00]  Rolling and holding her  Fat thigh  Her legs go straight  Over the air  She lands right  On the back  Of her fucking  Fat thigh  And the  And in the original part  Like she rolls off  And she's just  Holding the back  Of her fucking  Fat leg 
[02:38:30]  Holy shit  My stomach hurts  What a buffalo  I've seen that  So many times  I don't know  Why it will happen  To her now  Who couldn't  I would love to know  Who could watch that  And not laugh  She's such a  She looks like  Bookman  From the fucking  Good times  Oh buffalo butt  Oh that was so great  Bravo  Yeah that is good  Alright well Steve  Thank you  I think most of those  Years are from me actually  God damn 
[02:39:00]  Football I didn't pay attention  Cause the Jets had a bye week  So I figured out  Fuck I'll take a break  From football  The whole team  Giants lost the heartbreaker  Huh  Giants lost the heartbreaker  Did they  Yeah  That's what they call it  Right  21-12  20 seconds left  Giants have now  Lost four in a row  Yeah  I'm a bad Dallas fan  And your dirty cowboys  Beat the Eagles  I watched some of it  And then I  For a minute  And I was  I just went home  And I was  I forgot I was so tired  From flying last night  And I was listening  To my new favorite song  I just fucking  What song 
[02:39:30]  I don't want to talk about it  But I get into like  Sometimes you find a song  That  Sometimes you find a song  That came out a long time ago  And you realize  I fucking love this  I love Jimmy's picks  And what is it?  Diamonds and rust  Diamonds and rust  You looked at me  And I don't know  Let us  You had to have heard it  Let us hear a little  Who does it?  You have to hear the original  Not the Judas Priest cover  No wait wait  You're listening to the original  You're talking  Of course  From 75  You're talking Miss  Joan Baez  Yeah  You heard this? 
[02:40:00]  I hate Joan Baez  I like her man  Never liked her  Filthy hippie  You like this?  I fucking love it  I've never heard this before  I've never heard this song  To be honest Jimmy  This was like a big hit for her  Coming in  Jimmy is such a homo  Fair enough  From Jimmy's subconscious  Don't buy a sucks  Well I'll be damned  Here comes your ghost again 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  But unusual  Seems into a fan  It's about an ex-boyfriend calling her  Oh yeah?  And I figured out who the ex-boyfriend was  I was very proud of myself  Oh you did?  I certainly did  Who is it?  I'm not telling you  Hearing a voice I'd known  A couple of light years ago  Heading straight for a fall  As I remember your eyes 
[02:41:00]  Were bluer than Robin's eggs  My poetry was lousy  You said  Was  Where were you calling from?  A booth in the midway  All I was thinking about while enjoying this song  Was Anthony ridiculing me  I'm trying to figure out who the boyfriend is or was 
[02:41:30]  You brought me something  We both know what memories can bring  They bring diamonds and rust  Diamonds and rust  What's it?  David Berkowitz?  Why aren't you doing my favorite bit?  This is perfect  Oh fuck  Because he wants to figure out who the boyfriend was  I don't know the song very well though  I'll just try  I'll just try  I'll just try 
[02:42:00]  You burst on the scene  Already a legend  The unwashed phenomenon  The original vagabond  You're going to hurt your Adam's apple 
[02:42:30]  Ow  I'm going to go with Bob Dylan  Give yourself a bell  Fuck  The line that  Because of the original vagabond  That's exactly it  I love that  That's a great line too  It's got to be Bob Dylan  The unwashed phenomenon  Yeah  The original vagabond  I didn't know until that line  Why diamonds and rust?  She said memories bring diamonds and rust 
[02:43:00]  I'm guessing  That when you start  When you go over memories  There's beautiful ones  And just horrible painful ones  She banged Bob Dylan?  She was dating him in 65 I think  Yes  That must have been a disgusting fucking looking  That's what that bed smelled like  Just a hairy fucking  That bed must have looked like  A fucking doggy sleep bed  But I'm guessing that's what diamonds and rust means  Oh  Very good  The rust part is probably from what the sheets looked like  When he fucked on a rag  Oh no 
[02:43:30]  When does this song end?  It's a long one  I like Joan Baez  Her voice  She did a fucking version of  Which of course I downloaded  Amazing Grace  Where she gets the audience to sing with her  And she sings the verse before they sing it  Like  It's almost like  So they know what to sing  She's fucking badass  I don't mind this song  Now that I'm hearing it  I just never really got into Joan Baez  Karen Carpenter is just ghoulish when she sang 
[02:44:00]  I don't know why people liked her music  All her shit was so overly sad  I like fucking folk story songs  I really love them  I like a long  I love the Edmund Fitzgerald  Even though we bag it  I fucking  I like a song to tell  Yeah I love the folk stuff man  You must love songs of similar length  I do  I love long songs  That are fucking  Like when you listen to it  You're like  Oh wow  I forgot that  I like a song  I'll get you ghoumi 
[02:44:30]  Her fucking amazing  She's good man  I don't love all of her shit  But I downloaded a couple of tunes  Do you know that  You know that the  I downloaded her greatest hits  All 20  I'm a fucking plane  I'm such a faggot  I'm hoping that they don't tell me  To turn my phone off  Before Joan Baez's greatest hits  Is downloaded  The fucking  The flight attendant  Should have come over  And fucked my face  While I waited  Fucking mo  I really am a fucking  What a liberal mo  I'm turning into  You really are  Joan Baez  Yeah that's a rough one  Fucking commie 
[02:45:00]  But good for you  Hey uh  Fedor  What are we doing  With this Fedor fight  I didn't watch  Did anyone see Fedor  And what  They split his fucking nose open  That fucking  Uh  Brett Rogers  I think his name is  That guy fucking  I was on CBS for free  Which is a smart move  To get Fedor recognition  And um  This guy Rogers  Fedor looks like he put  A few pounds on  Not much  Maybe an extra 10 pounds  Or 5 pounds  Which could just be  The way a Russian  Keeps like  To absorb blows  Sometimes these guys  Keep a little extra weight  Yes  But uh 
[02:45:30]  The guy was very strong  The guy hit really  Fucking hard  And I don't know if  Fedor has a lot of  Experience in a cage before  Uh  But the guy was  You can see Fedor  Was trying to tap him  And then in the second round  Do you want to play it  Fedor looked good  Not  Fedor's last couple of fights  The last guy he tapped  I think was  Fucking Tim Sylvia  He knocked out  Orlofsky  He knocked this guy out  Uh  He just  He had the one punch  Fight clean  Fight hard  Fight pure  If you want  Asian tires  How long was the fight?  In that minute or something 
[02:46:00]  In the second round  So you should fast forward  To the second round  Faito was bleeding  Like a pig though  Yeah?  Yeah  This guy split  Fedor's nose  This Rick Rogers  Is a big black dude  From Cabrini Greens  In Chicago  They were cheering  For the Russian  Louder than the Americans  Came in with  And went right to the hips  For the chair down  Rogers is so strong  He's broken right off  In between 
[02:46:30]  Dr. Bruce Hurts  Just the way  Fedor gets out  Of everything  Damn  That was crazy  How he got out of that  Rogers  Faito's a tough guy  To fucking beat man  Now they're up against  The cage  And the guy will hold  The cage  When he has you  Pinned against him  How the fuck  Isn't he in the UFC?  I know  He's bleeding badly  But he's so strong  Yeah? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah  Fedor's so strong  This is a big young guy  Man  Oh  He's mean  Faito on the stomach  In the stomach  That's just gonna make him angry  You'll make me angry  I must crush you  For this 28 year old  Former project  Oh  He lays  Yeah  He laid him out  With one punch  Oh  That was a hell of a punch  I think they 
[02:47:30]  That was a hell of a right  Jimmy  Faito didn't even pull  All the way back  He had his arm  Kind of cocked  But it wasn't all the way back  If they show it  And he drills  A right  Yeah he's not moving  He knocked this fucking guy  Hard  And then jumped on him  And got a couple shots  And they stopped it  And I thought they stopped it too soon  Until I saw the guy  Still laying on the ground  After a millionaire  Go see  Let it play  See if they show it in slow motion  Oh no  It's pretty obvious  That guy was out  He fucking  Really hit him hard  But then the guy  Hit him too 
[02:48:00]  Man  Rogers  And the guy after Rogers  Seems like a bit of a prick  But he was angry  That he lost  They both want a rematch  Badly  There will be a rematch  But I think part of it  Is they need an interesting  Who's in this league  That Fedor's fighting in?  There's another guy  Akeem something  That Joe Rogan thinks  Will give Fedor a tough time too  Rogan  An animal  Yeah  Yeah that's a big dude man  Mr. T's mad  It looks like  Mr. T and Tyson  Wondering  What happened  Fedor's fucking 
[02:48:30]  Still trying to figure out  What happened  Did you show the punch again  Just for us  He fucking  He fucking  Clocked him  He sure did  I wish he was in the UFC too  Though man  It does  It's frustrating  He'd love to see  Fedor fight some of the guys  In the UFC  He walks up to him  And belts him right in the face  He's wide open  Former quadruple  With the green  See that  People were saying  That Brock Lesnar  They think would beat Fedor  Up against the cage  But Fedor is so  Fucking good  At getting out 
[02:49:00]  Like every time  It looks like  He's about to be tapped  He just gets up  Or he slips out of it  He's very very quick  And he can  There's nobody on the planet  He can't knock out  With one shot  If he hits you  Very wiry  Yeah  Like I think  He could knock Lesnar out  James was at the fight  Not the one  Sitting across from me  But James in Chicago  James  Good morning boys  Hey buddy  Oh what a fucking fight  The crowd  Was cheering Fedor  The whole time  Until  He got that fucking 
[02:49:30]  Cut on his nose  And then  During the second round  All of a sudden  You start hearing  USA  USA  And I thought  At least from where I was sitting  That when the guy  Got on Fedor  I thought that it was  Going to be over  Yeah  But then when Fedor  Turned around  Got up  And just  Like did that clock  And went out  Oh my god  It was just unbelievable  And when the guy  Stood up  He was sitting there  Pissed off  He was like  Trying to yell  They didn't show on TV  But he was yelling  At everybody  Why did he stop  The fucking fight  You know  Yeah he had to  That guy was laying there 
[02:50:00]  The bottom line is  Fedor hit him really hard  And then jumped on him  And the guy was trying  To put his arm up  But the way Fedor had him  He was laying on his side  Yeah  There was no way  That guy was going to  Fucking not get beaten  Badly right there  The guy stopped it  I think it was right  He was still laying  On the floor  Yeah that guy was fucked  It almost  It almost seemed  Too quick  But then like  Once you saw  Like when the guy  Was sitting up  And you could tell  He was you know  You know  Just loopy  For a couple seconds there  You're like 
[02:50:30]  Yeah I'm glad he stopped it  But at the same time  It was like  Oh you almost wanted  To keep going  Because these two  Were really going at it  Like a couple animals  For a while there  They said that  Britt Rogers  Obviously was undefeated  And he'd never even  Been knocked down before  And I also think  Because it was CBS  I think because it was  On regular television  They weren't going  To have a blood  Like they were probably  Afraid of it  Of something really  Really bad  How they stopped the fight  When they were supposed to  Yeah  That guy was barely  Moving on the ground  Stop the fight  They stopped it  And a quick  Quick note  My brother actually  Knows Brett Rogers 
[02:51:00]  Because my brother  Works for Sam's Club  That guy used to be  A tire changer  For Sam's Club  And my brother  Would travel  And help  Set stores up  And my brother  Like ran into him  A couple times  And my brother  Was like  Yeah that was  One duty  That they did not  Just want to  Mess with  Because mostly  The people  You know  Work at Sam's Club  My brother says  Are kind of  Stupid  My brother's like  Once he saw this guy  He's like  Okay I know  Not to call him  Stupid  I know not to  Call this guy  Stupid  Yeah that's right  I like this guy  He's from Chicago 
[02:51:30]  Yeah it was  Yeah it was a mess  But  Punch it up  There's a couple  Of moments  Where Fedor's  On the ground  Right  And it looks  Like the guy  Is fucking  Got him up  Against the cage  On the ground  And like  He's about to  Get hurt  And then you see  Because Fedor's  So good at  Kind of like  Bringing his legs  Up and grab  And like  Just like  Arm barring  And like  Watching him  Do this  It's like  Oh yeah  He's actually  Really dangerous  When he's on his back  Yeah  Which is where  I think  Lesnar might run  Into trouble  If he fought  As big as  Brock is  I think Fedor  Would find a way  To fucking  Bend his arm back  Or his leg 
[02:52:00]  And tap him  I know I'm not  Talking like  A UFC expert  Sean in Georgia  Fuck  Sean  Jimmy  Yes sir  What you're  Forgetting about  Rodgers is  Rodgers has  No wrestling  And he has  Very very little  Ground experience  Someone as big  And strong as  Lesnar  With the skills  That he has  I think  You forget  Frank Mir  Is a black belt  In jiu jitsu  And a  World champion  In jiu jitsu  He has a  Very good guard  And Lesnar  Kept him  In a situation  That a lot of  Black belts  Shouldn't be able  To get out of  But was so strong  He couldn't move 
[02:52:30]  That's true  And I wouldn't  Bet my house  Against Lesnar  I'm not saying  It's a guarantee  I just think  That a guy  Like  You're right  Rodgers is a  Big strong  Fucking  But non wrestling  Guy  And Lesnar is  Probably a much  Better  Ground guy  I just think  That Fedor  Fedor also beat  Nogueira  I think  When he was  One of the best  In the world  I really think  That he would  Find a way  To tap him  But again  I could be  Right  He could get  Knocked out  Or he could  Also get tapped  Right on  Alright man  But you're right  I mean  This guy  Lesnar is a  Much better  Fucking  Ground guy  Than Brett  Rodgers 
[02:53:00]  And they're  Saying that  Fedor broke  His nose  The first jab  Of the fight  I'm sure he did  It looked like  It had to be  Broken  You think  It bothered him  Yeah  Because they say  He was breathing  Through his mouth  When he's up  Against the  Fucking cage  You see him  Breathing  Through his mouth  Because his nose  Is probably  Worthless to breathe  Through  Jesus  Alright  I think we did  It  Very good  I'm going to  Go pee again  I pet the pee  So bad  Yeah we can take  Another break  Timons and Ross  My Sambo arrived  So I want to eat that  Oh easy  Easy  Look  Look right here 
[02:53:30]  It's a piece of fruit  Taylor Swift finally  Talking about Kanye West  On SNL  What joking about it  Joking about it  Joking about it  Well because she was on SNL  You got to make jokes now  Did Kanye turn up  No  Of course not  That would have been cool right  Gandolfini versus a  Paparazzo  You don't like the  Paparazzo  And I love him for that  Yeah  Our Sharon Osbourne 
[02:54:00]  Clip was played  Everywhere  But the one thing  That's worth mentioning  On Access Hollywood  They left Anthony's  Holy shit in  Are you kidding  Nope  I'll probably be  Fine for that  Yeah  Probably figure out  Some way that  I would so  Be behind them  For finding you  How do they do that  Well we'll show you  After the break  Diane Sawyer interviews  Rihanna  That's pretty good shit  And we got some  Magazine clips  About him smoking  The crystal meth  Smoking the meth  And wearing his wig  A lot of stuff  Still to do  For this fine Monday 
[02:54:30]  Stay there  Anyone watching  Girls Next Door  By the way  It was on last night  Nah  That's the  Hugh Hefner thing  Oh my god  I saw a little bit of it  He's now 83 years old  And you know  People like to look at Anthony  Because he likes to date  Younger girls  Well  This fucking Hugh Hefner  Puts it in a whole  Whole nother ballpark  Does he  He's now 83  He's got three new broads  That  That quote  Are his girlfriends 
[02:55:00]  Yeah sure  Because they look like  They're creeped out  By the whole thing  And he's open mouth  Kissing them  On this girl's next door  It could be the  Fucking sickest thing  You'll see on regular TV  If you can find a clip  It is  It is downright disturbing  I just had to turn down  A gig at the Playboy Mansion  Why  Last Thursday  Because I was in Houston  I was supposed to be doing Leno  And they wanted me to do it after  It was a charity event  Oh my god  Have you ever done anything  At the Playboy Mansion  Never 
[02:55:30]  I don't even care about it though  It's like  You know  All it's going to do  Is get me fucking frustrated  I'm probably going to bomb  Then I'm going to like my fucking  Aw  Jimmy  We were invited to the Playboy Mansion once  I would go  But we couldn't do it  For some reason  I don't know what it was  Yeah  What does he do with these girls  Maybe our girls at the time  Were jealous  And said  Don't you  I don't know  Who the fuck knows  Huh  So he's got three new girls  There's two twins  And another  Blonde bimbo  And he  Open mouth  You think Hef has a type  Jesus 
[02:56:00]  Yeah  The show is horrendous  I was watching last night  I couldn't believe  I was watching this shit  What the hell is that  I don't know  They're like Tupac and Snoop  They're like wax people  Oh wax  Whatever  If you find the open mouth kiss  I think the boys will enjoy that  It's so disturbing  Alright so Taylor Swift  Let's  I just got a comment  Does Karatop have to incorporate himself into everything now?  Karatop is in everything  He just turns up in like commercials and fucking reality shows  They think he's a crazy guy to have in because everybody knows him 
[02:56:30]  Yeah  He's just so stupid  Yeah  We wanted to hate him too  I like him  He's great  That's what I was going to say  He came in and we were prepared to just kill him  And he was so fucking cool  As a guy he's cool  He fucking makes fun of himself  Yeah yeah exactly  He was very open  The stuff he was talking about  And we like him  He's huge  We consider him a friend  Yeah and also it doesn't hurt that  Looks like he's on the roids  He's such a non-dick comedian  Like he's just  He's nice to other comics  He's not a fucking ass  Somebody  You know  Some guy that 
[02:57:00]  Like his whole career  Just has been  Oh  Beat to shit  Over his act man  By everybody  I know the Girls Next Door show isn't our audience  Believe it or not  Know who's watching this show?  Oh  Broads  And a lot of them  Of course  Why would you say of course?  Because it's about girls  Like is it about girls?  Like I would say definitely  Yeah  But you think guys would watch  Because it's Playboy fucking you know Playmates  And they do show a lot of pixelated nudity  Which is pretty amazing that they're getting away with that 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  But no it is  Broads love this show  And then they get on their Blackberries and their iPhones  And they're back and forth about the show  Sensing back and forth  Footer what's up?  Oh it's rape  Hey guys  I got to  Just want to acknowledge  Hey this  I remember on the old ones  I didn't realize the girls  Like spoke to them  Like as an old man  On this one  They legitimately  Like  They'll yell  Like raise their voice  They'll speak  Like we can kind of read their lips 
[02:58:00]  It's kind of  It's really kind of fucking embarrassing perhaps  Thank you for mentioning that  Because  He sort of pulled it off  With the last three  A couple years have gone by  Or maybe a year  Since they filmed any new episodes  They are now yelling at Hef  I forgot to tell you that  Because he can't hear  Oh really?  So now they're like  Hef do you like camping?  Oh no  What?  What?  And he has a creepy laugh  Hef couldn't hear before though  I remember when  Now they're really just yelling right at him  When Big A interviewed him  He got annoyed and left 
[02:58:30]  Because Big A was just stuttering and spitting  He interviewed Hefner?  Yeah  It's a great interview  Do we have that?  Where?  We should  When we went to the Playboy Mansion for CBS  I took Big A to the Playboy Mansion  You were at the Playboy Mansion?  Yeah  How do I not remember that?  Maybe I was away  He was hitting on all the American Gladiators  All the girls from American Gladiators  Did he smell?  Big A?  Yeah  He put his bad cologne on too heavy  Oh no  He drank a lot  What was his cologne?  Oh yeah  What was his cologne?  He drank a lot  I don't know 
[02:59:00]  It's the same scent that he always has  It's just  Same scent  Cadaver  Yeah  Wait you flew with him?  No I wasn't on the plane with him  Why not?  We had different flights  Why'd you have different flights?  I guess it just worked out that way  We also had  You didn't sit next to Big A?  What's wrong with you?  We just  Our flights were different for some reason  And we were on  Big A  If you're listening  I would be insulted that Sam didn't fly with you  I want to fly Big A first class somewhere  And then not sit with him  Like watch  Do it to one of your gigs  No  Footer  Anything else on the show? 
[02:59:30]  I know it's more of a girl's show  But I took a peak last night  I was like  This show is fucking disturbing  No  It was just  It was just the fact that I can clearly see the difference  Between like last season  And then this season  Where they're just  Totally embarrassing  It happened  Like exactly like how you do it  With your grandpa  Where you gotta kind of lean in  And like say the words  We can read the lips a little better  It's just so clear  But alright  I'll punch it out  All in a party rape  Alright  Jesus  It's a two part worst of  Yeah Travis said  Have we played it in a while? 
[03:00:00]  No  It's been a while  I don't think so  Alright let's get it on before 11  That's the bit we'll play before Rana Fest today  If we could squeeze it in  You know  Yeah yeah yeah  You know what disturbing show is on  Speaking about reality shows and shit  Is this  You ever see Little Miss Perfect?

[03:09:30]  I just figured  Ant watching an episode  A little Miss Perfect  Would be like the rest of us  Watching an episode  Of the Golden Girls  Yeah it's terrible  I said it's very creepy  It's just awful  And the moms are all  Terrible  Big fat women  They whore their  Daughters out  They're little whores  They dress them like whores  Keith  Spelled  K-I-E-T-H  On the phone  That's Keith  Yeah it could be that way 
[03:10:00]  Hello dear friend  Hey Ant  Yeah  Hey Ant  Yeah  You said she's out of pediatrics now  Yeah  Does that mean she turned 16  While she was in there  No  It's not  No  That doesn't work like that  Oh  Oh  I'm sorry  I don't  I don't  See underage girls  Yeah  Okay  Okay punch it out  And you know  As per New York State laws  Of course  I just got  I was reading an ad tweet 
[03:10:30]  When you want to read  What people say about you  And this guy Miller  Went you sumbitches  I am now sitting at my desk  And I have diamonds and rust  Running through my head  Good  Good for you  Let it mingle with a bullet  If you can  Exactly  Mingle  Mingle  You want to hear what Taylor Swift  Had to say about  Yes  Kanye  On SNL  You might be expecting me to say  Something bad about Kanye  And how he ran up on the stage  And ruined my VMA monologue 
[03:11:00]  But there's nothing more to say  Cause everything's okay  I've got security lining the stage  It's my SNL monologue  La la  La la la la la la  This is my SNL monologue 
[03:11:30]  La la  La la la la la la  That was my SNL monologue  We have a great show  Kanye West to come here  So stick around  To be right back  No more Michaels  I bet you he was trying to get that done  Right  He probably tried to  To have Kanye West on that stage with her  You know what  Is she finally admitting that  That was the best thing that ever happened to her  As far as her career goes  I bet  I mean she was doing very well on her own  But this put her up  Into another level 
[03:12:00]  This Kanye West thing  She wouldn't be hosting SNL  If Kanye West never went on that stage  But you're right  Simple as that  I wonder who said no to that  She should be thanking Kanye at this point  Did her people say no  Or did he not want to  Because I would say  If in the middle of her monologue  If she wasn't addressing it  If all of a sudden  Kanye West just ran on stage  Said something about how someone had done  The best monologue he ever saw  Right  And then gave her the microphone back  And then she just looked  And continued her dumb song  Without acknowledging it  That would have been fucking great  Who's the token black guy in SNL 
[03:12:30]  These days  I don't know  I know Fred does a lot of the black  Voices  The token black guy from SNL  The fat guy from  God  Yeah I think Keenan and Kel  Keenan Thompson  So why wouldn't they have him  Dress up as Kanye  And interrupt her monologue  Maybe he looks  They should have got someone  Who looked like Kanye  I bet she wouldn't agree to that  Did that ever stop SNL  People not looking anything like people  Yeah really  Why didn't they do that  That means she would have a problem with that 
[03:13:00]  Fred Armisen should have dressed  Stuff like fucking  Because he does a funny Patterson  Just wandering around  That would have been funny  If during her monologue  Fucking Patterson  Just wandered out blindly  Patterson  Fucking idiot  He does a great  Take on that whole thing  That's so funny  Let's see how to Rick in Indiana  Rick  Rick  Anthony you keep on harping on these fat moms  You know  Yeah  It's kind of like the hot chick fat friend at the bar  Kind of cock blocking you there 
[03:13:30]  Anthony  No it's not a cock blocking thing  They're all from the same mold  I don't know what it is  They're just  They're all fat  They're all  Severe white trash  Mikey  Hey Opie  You're a little out of touch there  I mean  Didn't she win like the head  The head cunt award  Or whatever it is  The number one award  It's not an award sir  Mikey  It's not an award  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring  Banana rape  But Mike  No I mean  I made the point  She has a very good career  I wouldn't deny that  She won the award 
[03:14:00]  And all that  But there's  There's different levels of fame  And the Kanye West moment  Put her on a much higher level  I didn't know who fucking Taylor Swift was  Until that happened  True  True that  So many more people know who she is  Outside that genre of music now  To the point she's now hosting SNL  They would have never asked her to host SNL  Yeah I have no clue who the fuck she was  To tell you the truth  And someone else is saying I'm a dummy  Because that was the second time she was on SNL  But she was probably  Was she hosting SNL?  No this is her first host 
[03:14:30]  Thank you  So go fuck yourself  This is the first time there  You cock sucker  Shut up  She was the musical guest and the host  Yeah she  Well going from musical guest to a hosting job  Is a big fucking step up  But I'm saying this  She was musical guest and host  Right  This weekend  Yes  She did both gigs  Yes  Right  But the first time she was on  She just sang a quick song  Exactly  And that was it right  Yes  There you go  Yeah I'm looking at Taylor Swift pictures right now  So  Pretty great  I hope Sharon doesn't get in trouble  For that whole Susan Boyle thing 
[03:15:00]  She wouldn't have said it on the radio  If she was going to get in trouble  That's true  And she would just say  Shut up  She knows what she's doing  Go fuck yourself  It wasn't like  It was an old private conversation  It was actually a radio thing  That you film and put on your YouTube channel  And what would Tyler Durden do  Grab that  I mean  No no  She said it on the radio  She didn't expect that to be a secret  She'll be alright right  She doesn't give a fuck  She's Sharon Osborne  It's like what are they going to do  Fire her  She would just bash them  She attacked Cosby for attacking the show  I love her  It was very refreshing to hear a celebrity  Not worried about the consequences  And just speaking her mind 
[03:15:30]  Because she doesn't care  I love it  I love it  But the video went everywhere  Yeah  And they left Anthony's holy shit in there on Access Hollywood  Like that  You want to hear how some of these dummies handled this thing though?  Yes  Do you?  No  Alright  We'll try it  We'll end with the Access Hollywood with the holy shit  Access Hollywood  Showbiz Tonight  A little show of what?  CNN headline news?  CNN headline  Picked it up  But first  Ouch  Sharon Susan's smackdown caught on tape 
[03:16:00]  Sharon Osborne's vicious attack on Susan Boyle  Osborne who is a judge on America's Got Talent  Is slamming Boyle for the way she looks  On the Opie and Anthony morning show on Sirius XM radio that surfaced today  Sharon says some unbelievable things about Boyle  Wait till you see this  Join me tonight in Hollywood  Leslie Marshall  Host of the Leslie Marshall show  Also in Hollywood  Mark Malkin  Who's an online columnist for a Leslie Mark look 
[03:16:30]  From the moment Susan Boyle appeared on Britain's Got Talent  Nobody ever said that she was a beauty queen  But Sharon Osborne took it to a whole new level  Watch this  This great picture of Susan Boyle  Smiling  Looking like a slapped ass  Right?  It's great  Yeah  And going back to the Taylor Swift Kanye West thing  I mean Susan Boyle is as big as she is  Because she's ugly with a good voice  Exactly  I mean and no one wants to acknowledge that 
[03:17:00]  She wouldn't have got that much attention  If she wasn't a fucking mess  She stood up there  Everyone was laughing at her  And looking like  Oh my god  There's a monster on the stage  And then she has this great voice come out of that fucking disgusting maw of hers  That mule asshole she calls her face  It's so good to be a comic  No one cares if you're back  No one cares  Face like a mule asshole  And who yesterday  Comedian Jim Norton said  Right  Who cares 
[03:17:30]  But why can't we acknowledge that as a society  We've got to make believe it was all about her voice  Yeah  It was the whole package  Of course it was  Please  That ugly mess that  Speaking of which  She sings like a bird  Our favorite person is walking down the hall  With his fucking angry looks and his leers  Anyway let's continue  We don't want him going to human resources  I'm grumpy  Look at me  We hate that fucking guy  I just  No respect  At all 
[03:18:00]  Hey  Hey you're okay  Yeah you know  She goes like a fairy  Leslie talk about vicious  What's wrong with Sharon  Sharon just put the cat back in cat fight  Didn't she Brooke  Wait who took that out  No one  No one took the cat out of cat fight  That's just a fight  That's like saying the woman who just said that  Put the C in cunt  It wasn't unt before stupid 
[03:18:30]  The cat back in cat fight  Didn't she Brooke  I mean  Yeah  This is beyond meow  I mean  First of all  Not everybody can be  Or is a beauty queen  And I'm sure  All of us won't look as hot  When we're 90  100 years from now  But  You know  This woman has  Immense  Talent  Immense talent  Shut the fuck up  And I know there are people out there  That would say  I'd rather be  Brilliantly talented  Than beautiful 
[03:19:00]  Because that voice  Can just bring so much more  Than just a pretty face can  And I'm just really surprised  As a woman  That she would go there  Me too  I'm shocked  It was a low blow  It was completely cruel  And unnecessary  And Sharon  Did not  Make the cut  Of our nominees  For showbiz tonight's  Most provocative celebrity  Of the week  But some of our nominees  Fuck you  Fuck you  How about  Why didn't either one of them say  Sharon  Was trying to be funny 
[03:19:30]  Yeah  And was bagging on her  And she would  Everyone was laughing  While she said it  Yeah  No of course not  There's no context break  There's no break  With what the intent was  Fucking catty cunts  Shut up  Yeah it's like Sharon  Held a press conference  To fucking say  In front of a podium  With news microphones  To say  Fucking Susan Boyle  Is a pig  She said out of press release  I have something to say  Could everyone gather  Can you imagine  It's not a comedy show  It might as well have been  That would be shocking  I think I would even be shocked  That's a bit more shocking 
[03:20:00]  Than being on a fucking  Doping comedy  Trying to get a few laughs out  And Sharon also said  You know  That she's very talented  She was being funny  She was being hysterical  And these two fucking  These two phony  Fucking bitches  Didn't acknowledge  That the one reason  Susan Boyle is famous  Is because she is  Such an ugly  Lumpy thing  Exactly  That our prejudice  Of ugly people  Caused us to have  No expectations of  Because she was  A very hot woman  She's a talented person  But she's not nearly  As talented  As she is ugly 
[03:20:30]  As she is famous  She's ugly  You know what I mean  She seems good  Because she's so homely  Right  And can sing well  You don't expect  A voice like that  To come out of that  Alright we continue  Then E ran with the story  Let's see how they handled it  Sharon Osbourne  Has never been afraid  Of speaking her mind  But the America's Got Talent  Judge made an unfiltered  Attack on Susan Boyle's  Looks that would make  Even Simon blush  Witness how Mrs. Osbourne  Can go off the rails  Like a crazy train  I like everybody 
[03:21:00]  To do well  And even someone  That looks like  A slap down  God doesn't give everyone  Everything  Absolutely  Yeah  But he gave her  The challenge  Yes  Really shortchanged  Around the rest of it  Well she did call her  A lovely lady  So it's all good  Right  Okay just for the record  Looky here  Here is Sharon  In 87  Before she had a few 
[03:21:30]  Admitted niffs and tucks  Pot  Heath kettle  Taking the high road  Subo has not commented  Yeah I noticed  Because of the comments  On the video  She's called Subo  Yeah  Subo  Subo  Subo  Subo  Sumoo  Subo  Subo  Yeah  It sounds like a fat pig thing  Yeah  It's not quite J-Lo  What happened to your leg  A Subo bit me  I was bitten by a Subo  I fell asleep in a field 
[03:22:00]  And a Subo was shitting  And bit me  The Subo ate your baby  Did Sharon reach out to you  No she's not  Well I know you guys talk now  Yeah but I'm saying  She wouldn't  Like I'm sure she wasn't  Mad about it  Because she's a smart person  She said it on the air  To be  She knows what's a radio show  The timing's weird  Because now they're saying  That Subo  Subo  Is performing on  Dancing with the Stars  Tomorrow night  As what  And Kelly Osbourne  Is still in the competition  And Sharon Osbourne 
[03:22:30]  Usually is in the front row  So this whole thing  Oh shit  The timing of this whole thing  Is a little weird  What's she gonna do on that show  She's gonna sing  One of her songs I guess  Wild Horses is the one  They're pushing  She should be forced  To swim in a fucking  A tank like a whale  When you go to Sea World  While everybody's dancing  She should be forced  To fucking  Do tricks for fish  And throw a fucking  Throw a salmon  To that fat porpoise  Imagine they don't even tell her  They just break in a huge tank  And put it center stage  Or as she's singing  They kick her in there  And they reveal  That she fell into  A big thing of water 
[03:23:00]  And everybody points  Like Carrie  Isn't that ironic  That that's like  Her hit song now  And truly  Wild Horses  Couldn't drag her away  She should be pulling  A bug truck  Fucking through the snow  I'm still laughing  At Anthony's  Like it's not like  She called a press conference  The visual of that  Is just classic  I'd like to say  She looks like a smacked ass  She's there at a fucking podium  News 1010 wins 
[03:23:30]  Fucking mic flags  In front of her  Let's see how  Inside Edition handled this  And then we finally get to the clip  Where they left in  Holy shit  Nice  Sharon Osbourne  Has always been one  To speak her mind  But what she's saying right now  About singing sensation  Susan Boyle  Has plenty of people shocked  You just want to say  Go bless  And here's a Gillette razor  It's a shocking radio interview  Sharon Osbourne  Trashing Susan Boyle  On the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:24:00]  On Sirius XM radio  I'd like everybody to do well  Even someone that looks like  A slap  Just two months ago  Osbourne blew kisses  At Susan Boyle  During the season finale  Of America's Got Talent  Osbourne is a judge on the show  And gave Boyle  A standing ovation  God doesn't give everyone  Everything  Absolutely  Yeah  He gave her the talent  Yes  Yes  Really shortchanged  On the rest of it  Inside edition 
[03:24:30]  From Fort Hood  Military Base in Texas  We'll continue after this  Jesus  The timing on that line  Is terrific  And we're all laughing  It's like  Not one person  Not one of these  Dog shit  Entertainment reporters  And that's all of them  Said  Sharon Osbourne  Was joking  On the Opie and Anthony show  Yes  You could follow  By the fucking  Raucous laughter  It's like  That's what's lost  This is what an unfunny  Fucking asshole society 
[03:25:00]  We live in  She is obviously  Being funny  Yes  And she's joking  Oh there's truth and humor  Big fucking deal  Susan Boyle is an ugly monster  Sorry folks  What's the matter  Sharon's just honest enough  To say it  I fucking hate this country  I fucking hate  The mentality of our society  A bunch of fucking  Teenage whining girls  That's what we've  Brought ourselves to  God fuck everybody  That's the point we're at  She was being funny  Joking around 
[03:25:30]  And I can see if they said  Hey that was inappropriate  Or they didn't  But no one even acknowledges  That she's trying to be funny  Yeah  No one acknowledges  That hey  It's just fucking harsh humor  And she is voicing  What every single person thought  Everybody  And what part of the appeal  Of Susan Boyle is  That was  All of the appeal  Was the fact that  She was fucking discussing  And had a great voice  And Sharon Osborne  Would trash herself  Because we were talking  We were backstage that time  A woman walked up to Sharon 
[03:26:00]  And there's a bunch of people around  And the woman's like  Were you  Did you know  Randy Rose  Were you around  When Randy died  She was very drunk  And groupie  And me and Sharon  Looked at each other  Because anyone that knows  Anything about Sharon  Knows that Sharon  One of her close friends  Was on the plane with Randy  When he died  Rachel Youngblood  So the woman was babbling about it  And said something about it  And Sharon's like  Well back then  And Sharon's like  I was with Ozzy back then  And I think the girl's like  Oh I didn't recognize you  And she goes  Oh well I was a frumpy Jew  I fucking howled 
[03:26:30]  When she said that  But Sharon will fucking  Shit on herself  Yeah  Very quickly  She's not stupid  Or out of touch  Here's the Access Hollywood clip  I think it's Billy Bush  Over there  And Nancy O'Dell  I think Billy Bush  Took a few shots at us  I think  I am  I think this might be  Who's Billy Bush  He runs the Access Hollywood thing  He's got a whole bunch  Of radio shows too  He's trying to be like  A Seacrest  Yeah I know  He's doing  Good luck with that  And then at the end  Of the clip  You hear Anthony's  Holy shit  So maybe we should  Call the FCC 
[03:27:00]  I think we should  On Access Hollywood  You look in yourself  Thank you  Kudos  We can call Sharon Osbourne  Because she likes to give opinions  About how people look  She didn't hold back  Her opinions on SiriusXM's  The Opie and Anthony show  Do you love Susan Boyle  I mean do you know  She helped the show or not  Or do you not love her  Do you happy that she's succeeding  Oh I'm happy that she  I like everybody to do well  Yeah  Even someone that looks like  A slap down  It's like  God bless her  She's so good  She's a very awesome  Alright I just have to point out here 
[03:27:30]  That Sharon has not always  Looked the way she does today  Take a look at this photo  Of Sharon pre-makeover  Those who live in glass houses  My dear  She didn't throw stones  Is that what you're trying to say  Well she had a few more stones  God doesn't give everyone  Everything  Absolutely  Yeah  He gave her the talent  Yes  Yes  Yes  Really short  She's on the rest of it  I'm just so surprised about this  Sharon Osbourne is one of the  Sweetest ladies you can meet  I'm just surprised 
[03:28:00]  That she would comment  Like that  You know it just hurts people  It goes to everybody  It goes back to 7th grade  You know  Who picks on the unpopular kid  Everybody's been in that situation  And nobody's got the stomach for it  Especially  We've seen Susan Boyle  She's emotionally unstable  And she's  Comes from a small place  And she's not ready  I think there's something else  Going on there  Maybe Sharon knows  The behind the scenes shenanigans  She just got caught up  In a locker room  And her man came out  Where's the holy shit  It was there  Oh it was there  Where are you  You gotta keep them ears open  Holy shit  And then he came right in 
[03:28:30]  Oh okay  What a fucking pussy guy that is  I don't even know who he is  What a fucking pussy guy he is  What a fucking pussy  That was mean  Shut the fuck up  Well I think Fish Cunt  Will say it perfectly here  Spelled PH  On instant feedback  For real  For Mississippi  These are all the same shows  That can't wait to show you  Which celebrities are getting fat  Or have a cunt tumor  What a bunch of dishonest shit 
[03:29:00]  Dude you're absolutely right  Yes  All they do is show that  Fucking fat Kirstie Alley  Fucking  Yes  Waddling around  And you know  Yeah  They always show  Celebrities at their worst  But then they try to make it sound  Like it's a news thing  Or there's nothing newsy about it  And by the way  I want to show you  Kirstie Alley getting fat again  The fact that  They themselves  Probably take hours  In makeup  Before they go out on stage  So they could fucking look  You know  Their best  Just go out there  Without makeup then  And why isn't a fat fuck 
[03:29:30]  Like Susan Boyle  Hosting one of these shows  Yeah  Why is it always  Good looking people  Why are all these  Fucking chisel jaw  Attractive  Fake tit broads  Put a fucking bitch  Like Susan Boyle  Let her host it  Yeah  Oh you wouldn't do that  Because it doesn't look good  For the network  Susan Boyle looks a good singer  Everybody knows she's a good singer  Part of the appeal  Is we never expect  Talent  Out of truly ugly people  Like that  We have such a bigotry  Towards fat ugly people  Like that  That we were shocked  That she was entertaining 
[03:30:00]  Part of the appeal  Is that Captain Hook uniform  I just  I don't know why  When you said  Part of that appeal  I just thought of that prick  It just drives me nuts  That everyone is  Fucking bagging on Sharon  And not one person  Has said that was funny  She does look like  A slapped ass  Yes  Phones  Let's go to John in Jersey  John  Hey John  Hey what's up guys  I was just listening  To Philly  Fucking Bush  And like  It's ridiculous  I was trying to be  Trying to be all self-righteous  And stuff  When the show  Acts of Hollywood  And all that other shit  It's just based on 
[03:30:30]  Like spreading rumors  And making fun of celebrities  And shit  I mean that's the whole point  Of this show  Is so and so  Getting divorced  Oh they do a  Lindsay Lohan story  Pretty much every night  Yeah  And she's a complete  Fucking mess  Fuck Access Hollywood  And fuck all those  Corny entertainment shows  That's the beauty  Of being a comic  Who's never really  Going to make it  You can say  Whatever you want  Doesn't matter  Yeah fuck all of them  Hey we should do  A Jocktober bit  With the entertainment shows  I'm thinking  Yeah  Not a bad idea  Because  Every night  They're just 
[03:31:00]  Completely ridiculous  With the stuff  They're doing on their shows  Crap  Let me go to  Aaron in Oregon  Aaron  Yeah I just wanted to say  Answer that  Dumb twits question  What's wrong with  Sharon Osbourne  She's got  Her own  Fucking sense of humor  As an intelligent  Human being  As opposed to this  Fucking  Retards  That run these  Entertainment  Channels  They're just readers too  They go on there  And read  Yeah they don't write  This copy  No they get all 
[03:31:30]  Like it's fake  Outrage  I think they're outraged  You know  The second that  Fucking camera shuts off  The two of them  Look at each other  And goes  Holy shit  She does look like  A slapped ass  What a pig  Whatever  They're just hypocrites  They're phonies  When the video  Appeared  They were excited  They couldn't wait  To get it on their show  Because they know  It was good for their show  Yes  I didn't see  Any of these  By the way  Did they show  The video clip  And more importantly  Was I seen  In any of it  No you weren't  I might have been  No  No 
[03:32:00]  Jimmy was  Because he was  Right next to Sharon  Ah shit  And I'm the one  Look not to take  Full credit  By the way  For a company  Who's completely  Disregarding me  But for getting  A lot of plugs  By bringing up  A subject  That sparked  A conversation  But uh  The you know  That whole thing  Was based on  The picture  I sent them  Exactly  You know what  You better give  Give yourself a bell  For that  For real  No let Jimmy  Hit the bell  Alright  Give yourself  A bell  For real  Jimmy  There you go  Four  Uh  Kevin in New Mexico  Newsreg November 
[03:32:30]  Eddie M wants to call it  Oh  Yes  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you  Uh oh  Uh y'all missed something  In that first clip  I believe  That chick said  That uh  A hundred years from now  When we're 90  How old is she  Minus 10  Well that's  It was just  An awful joke  That wasn't worth  Acknowledging  It was like  Trying to be cute  It's like  Just shut up  Bitch and read  Uh Frank  In Jersey  Frank  Frank  Frank was better  Get it  Go ahead Frank  Right uh 
[03:33:00]  Jimmy how is she  Not a phony  For talking shit  About Susan  Like that  How is that not  Just being phony  And just attacking  Someone for no reason  Well she's being  Honestly dude  I'll tell you  I'll tell you how  Cause like Anthony  Said it was done  She didn't call  A press cop  Sharon is pretty  Outspoken  And she's pretty  She speaks her mind  She was being funny  She was just joking  Around making fun  Of somebody  And to me  It's acceptable  Because this is  Coming from a woman  That when her  And her husband  Opened up their life 
[03:33:30]  Pretty much  On the Osbournes  And they said  The only thing  That they would have  Had any editing  Capability over  Was anything  That embarrassed  The children  Like that was  Something that they  Agreed to  When they signed  On with MTV  But you understand  What I mean  So that's to me  Why she's not  Being phony  Not exactly  Because you can  Listen to interviews  Where Sharon  Just says nothing  But nice things  About Susan Boyle  And you turn around  And just talk  Garbage about her  On a radio show  Well pick an emotion  Either you like her  And you're going  To talk nice  Or you think  She's disgusting  Look we all  We all thought  She looked ugly  But I'm not going 
[03:34:00]  To sit anywhere  And just start  Slamming someone  For no reason  What did Susan  Ever say  I know it's kind  Of like a  Childless thing  Whatever she  Ever say about her  But honestly  Did Susan Boyle  Ever sit there  And try to  Trash anyone else  No but Susan  Boyle also  Hold on  Susan Boyle also  Turned out to be  An unstable loon  Who was fucking  Bitching  Because she lost  And again  I know she was a  Nobody who just  Got thrown  All of a sudden  She's one of the  Most famous people  In the world  But it's also  The context of  The interview  We were joking  Around Sharon  Was being funny  You're freer  To be funny here 
[03:34:30]  That's like saying  In any interview  I do about something  Or anybody does  Why do you mention  It nicely one time  And then bag on  It another time  It doesn't mean  You're being  If she had said  Susan was beautiful  In an interview  And her looks mean  Nothing and I didn't  Even notice  That's one thing  But I don't think  She did  She made reference  To the fact that  She was a woman  Who was prejudged  Based on her looks  Oh then she  So she referenced it  Yeah  Why would she then  Just sit there  And just destroy this  She didn't destroy her  She just made fun of her 
[03:35:00]  Oh come on  You were there  Yes I was  Even I heard that  Like wow  I can't believe  She's actually saying  Anything she's saying  You can't believe  The honesty  That's what made it funny  It was that she  Because no one  Really got anywhere  And said this  No one actually said  Holy shit  That woman is ugly  And she's got a great voice  Why would you  Yeah  Why even reference  The fact that she's ugly  Because we're  Because we're  Fucking human beings  And we notice  Things like that  And when you spit it out  And just say it  For some reason  That's wrong 
[03:35:30]  Especially in the comedy context  Why  What's wrong with her saying it  Instead of us  You asking us  What's the fucking problem  Why is she doing it  You tell me  What's wrong  What's so wrong  On a comedy show  Of her doing that  When a lot of comedy  Is based on  Making fun of people  Yes  Yeah well  There's one thing  Where you can make fun  Of people  Or their quirks  Or whatever  But to just sit there  And say she's  Just for lack  Of a better term  Disgusting  For what  Is that really even funny  Let me answer your question  It was hilarious  And you know it was  Let me answer your question 
[03:36:00]  You said well how come  Why does it matter  That she's ugly  You're taking that  Entertainment Tonight angle  When the reality is this  When she walked out  Onto that stage  How come nobody says  Why did everybody laugh at her  Until they heard her sing  Thank you  Every fucking person  In that audience  And they showed the laughter  Because they wanted you  To be amazed  That this ugly pig  Could sing  That was from the beginning  The set up  That was from  So don't come 
[03:36:30]  And because Sharon  Made fun of her  Or people made fun of her looks  All of a sudden go  Why does it matter  When it mattered  From the very beginning  And you know what  It's an insight  Into all of our ugliness  When it comes to  Our perception  Of unattractive people  Let's be fucking honest  None of us expected  Any type of a talented voice  Out of an ugly woman  Like that  Which is stupid  She got that ovation  When she started singing  Because everybody was laughing  Looking at her  And making fun of her  Yeah  Frank  Hold on  I'm putting you  On the phone  With Jay from Denver 
[03:37:00]  Who looks at it differently  So you can hear each other  Go ahead Jay  You got Frank  On the line as well  Go ahead Jay  What do you got  This guy's got a vagina  Between his legs man  In comedy  There's no limits man  You make fun of everybody  Because it's funny  Just take a laugh  For a laugh  You puss  What the hell man  Alright Jay  So just so I'm clear  Then you can just  Basically say  Whatever you want  About anyone  Regardless of the circumstance  And it's funny  Just because  That's just the way it is  Right  Absolutely right  So you know  Me not  The way it makes people laugh  Then it's entertainment 
[03:37:30]  Entertainment is what it is  It's entertaining  If it makes you laugh  It makes you cry  It makes you angry  It's entertaining  That's what the whole thing's about  Entertainment is subjective Jay  It's not across the board  You get that right  Entertainment isn't  Across the board  So it's subjective  To your audience  You yourself are an ugly pig  You yourself said  You're an ugly pig  You're no better  Than anybody else  Dude  Frank can I ask you a question  Though just to address  The answer I gave you  About our prejudicial way  Of looking 
[03:38:00]  It's this phony niceness  We have  Everyone thought the same thing  When they saw that woman  Correct  So it's like  What Sharon did  Oh yeah  It was a little tasteless  But it really was  To be funny  And she really did  Point out what everybody thinks  It wasn't like  Absolutely  So why are people  Harping on Sharon  Instead of saying  You know  Beyond Sharon  Why do we  As a group  Expect no talent  Out of a woman  Who looks like this  Why are we as a group  Shocked  That a woman  Who looks like that  Can sing well 
[03:38:30]  I agree with you  On that respect  And the fact that  Yes we all think  That as human beings  We see someone like that  We don't expect  Most of them  Why don't we though  But why  Let's  Don't just  I'm not a psychiatrist  I don't know  Why don't you  I'm asking about you  Why don't you expect  Anything out of her  I didn't say that  I didn't  Or I didn't say that  I did  I didn't watch that show  And go  I think she's going to be terrible  I watched it and listened  And believe me Jim  I know what the set up was  Right  You put this woman on there  And you show it to the audience  I get it  She's unattracted to most 
[03:39:00]  And we're all laughing at her  I get that set up  I know what they were trying to do  My point is  You don't have to be so overt about it  And go on this talk show  That's heard by millions  And just destroy her verbally  For what  Like in my opinion  Sharon is just trying to get up in the mix  With the boys  And try to be outlandish  And say garbage  That made everybody laugh  Here's why I don't agree with you  And I'll tell you why  Let's be honest  I mean she has a history  Of doing shock jock radio  I mean if you want to use it  She's not  This is not her first time  On a male oriented show 
[03:39:30]  She did Stern for years  She fucking lives with Ozzy  She's been around rock singers  It's almost like  This is not a woman  Who you just threw around the boys  And she became intimidated  And tried to be  That's who she is  She talks shit  She's fucking extremely out there  That's how she's fucking  Dealt with the people  She's dealt with  And look  Maybe what she said  Was tasteless  But it was funny  And she was just being funny  You know what I mean  It's like  You're reading into it  Like she's this two faced monster  When fucking  That's who Sharon is  She's just a fucking person  Who talks shit  And she's funny 
[03:40:00]  She really is a person  That talks shit  We've all heard the stories  Over the years  She kind of has  That Bob Saget thing  Where Bob Saget  Was doing this  Family friendly TV  But the reality was  He was a potty mouth  And Sharon Osbourne  And has always been  A potty mouth  Absolutely  I think the thing  That was the most annoying  Is she picked a target  That  Susan Boyle's not  Going on some  Talk show  And talking shit about  Sharon Osbourne  Human beings love  Easy targets  But dude  This is what you're saying 
[03:40:30]  That makes me  Think you're not a funny guy  You're not thinking  Like a funny guy  Because you said she  I'm not a comedian  I'm not saying  Neither is Sharon  You don't have to be a comedian  You don't have to be a comedian  Dude let me finish  I don't know  She's pretty funny  On the show  Dude let me finish  This is what I'm saying  I'm not attacking you  I'm saying to me  You're not  Like the way a funny guy  A funny guy  Would never question  Why she did that  Because the way  That conversation happened  Susan Boyle came up  And Sharon just went  With the mood  And was funny about it  It wasn't like  She came in here 
[03:41:00]  With an agenda  Exactly  I understand that  You wouldn't have said that  If you understood that  No I understand  There was no agenda  Why did she pick a target  She went with a conversation  And just was funny  With it off the cuff  That was called  Being off the cuff  And just being funny  And improvving  That's what that was  It wasn't picking a target  Did you hear the lead in question though  I don't remember who asked it  It said  What do you think of Susan Boyle  Do you love her  Just a simple like  What do you think of Susan Boyle  And she went with a funny answer 
[03:41:30]  She went with a funny answer  She acknowledged her talent  I mean it's funny  I don't think I'm going to get to them  Dr. X  He goes  It was kind of a roast mentality  You can like people  Yes  And trash them at the same time  I kind of like that phone call  From Dr. X  And that's sort of what happened  With Sharon  She acknowledged the talent  The woman has  And then stated the obvious  That we all were thinking  Since the first time we saw her  And she also made fun of Jeff Beck  And she said  Ozzy called up  She killed Jeff Beck  And she's like  Ozzy called up  And goes  Where's the fucking hook  Right  Like  Yeah but that's not TV worthy 
[03:42:00]  The Jeff Beck material  Unfortunately  Absolutely  And she fucking  That stuff was funny too  By the way  And then fucking  Brett Michaels  Is sitting right next to her  And she went  And you said  I know it is  I said  You can get  She said you can get a dose  To Brett Michaels  Yeah yeah  Hey Frank  Are you a Subo fan?  I don't even know  What a Subo fan is  Are you the guy that  They call her Subo now  Susan Boyle  Are you a fan of Susan Boyle?  No I don't  I don't care  Okay I just wonder  So are you the guy  That called up about Ozzy 
[03:42:30]  Being a sellout?  Maybe Jim  Alright so maybe  You just have a thing  With  No it's not a thing  Against the Osbournes  I like an intro with you  Because I don't always agree  With what you have to say  And I like calling you  And giving you business  You give your side  I give my side  Sometimes I see it  Sometimes I don't  In this instance  With the roast mentality  Thing you just said Opie  It kind of makes  A little more sense  But how can you not  See this thing about  The way of funny  I made sense  Yes you did  The thing you said  What Dr. X said  Yes the thing you relayed  Relayed is the best word 
[03:43:00]  But I  Thank you sir  It's uh  It wasn't my point  Someone else  Are you the  Come on  Is this really  Are you the same guy  That used to work in radio  And that you call in all the time  And complain about the show  Oh shit  No dude  No  It's not  Okay  But I am the same guy  Who called you last week  About the stupid WWE  And Ozzy Osbourne thing  Yeah the same  But then you call up  So it's like  I mean I know you like  Getting into it with me  Maybe you like me  Maybe you don't  I do actually  Kind of like it  Yeah  But it's to think that  Like if you're a funny guy  You would never have said 
[03:43:30]  Well she pitched a target  Unless you're just calling up  To be argumentative  And to be that guy  No I'm not  But do I consider myself  A funny guy  Like you know  I guess  But I don't attack  People  So I guess  That's not your humor  So that's  Yeah that's your thing  I just completely  Don't see it your way  Frank  I think it would have been  Mean spirit  Going back to Anthony's thing  Because it's going to make me  Laugh all day  If Sharon Osbourne  Called that press conference  Because she had to tell the world  That Susan Boyle  Was ugly 
[03:44:00]  And whatever  Got hit with the ugly  The ugly stick  Then you know  Had to tell the world  It would be a little different  And wait a minute  By the way  You're not the guy  That you don't  You just don't attack people  But you called up here  On Provoked  Just to talk shit about Ozzy  So you do attack people  I didn't talk shit about him  I said that it was silly  For him to do it  I didn't say he was a jerk  You said he was a sellout  You were saying he was a sellout  Okay  If you think that's akin to  What Sharon said about  Susan Boyle  What I'm saying is  You just said 
[03:44:30]  I don't  Talk shit about people  Meaning  Like her humor was wrong  She was at least  Trying to be funny  And I'm saying  Well you did call the other day  And talk shit about somebody  I'm not saying you're right or wrong  But just don't  Don't fucking sit here  And say you don't do that  Because you do  Those two things are miles apart dude  Really  Yes  One happened naturally  And was to be funny  In a conversation  And one  You actually waited on hold to do  Yeah I did  So just don't say that  Just don't be dishonest  Frank we're going to have to do  That old agree to disagree thing 
[03:45:00]  I think  I like the line though  That you said once Jimmy  My only consistencies  Are my inconsistencies  We all have them  I'm not saying  I don't believe  I got them too  I know bro  I'm just like you  Yeah  Alright Frank  Thank you sir  Shut up  I like Frank  I like Frank  Shut up  He gets the phones ringing  I didn't get to talk to him  So I just figured I'd throw that out  Alright Frank  Yeah and you know  Sharon was going for humor  That's what  And the funny thing is  With all these entertainment shows  They go for exploiting celebrities 
[03:45:30]  No matter how  Of course  How you look at it  You know  But they won't acknowledge that  They're exploiting celebrities  Every night on those damn  Entertainment shows  But none of them said  None of them said  To be funny  That's what makes me  Right  When did humor  All of a sudden  That's what I'm saying  They should have kind of said  Well it was in the context  Of a comedy show  The guys try to be funny every day  It's a humorous show  And they wouldn't say that  Of course not  And they'll  I'm sorry  And then they'll say  And they'll say  Well the audio proved that  Because people were laughing  So we didn't need to say it 
[03:46:00]  But then again  You did need to editorialize  About it being inappropriate  Or mean  When the audio also showed that  So don't act like  You didn't need to say that  Because you didn't just say  Listen to Sharon  And then let it speak for itself  You did editorialize  And what was the next story  About it  You know  The fact that Penny Marshall  Has a brain tumor or something  Why is that newsworthy  Oh yeah  She's not  Penny Marshall has a brain tumor  Oh boy does she  Oh fuck man  Gonna be losing Penny Marshall soon  Oh wow man  That stinks  She's a big smoker I believe too  Yeah  Or am I wrong 
[03:46:30]  Does she not smoke at all  I think she used to smoke  I don't know  Can we hear the audio for that  I didn't  Puttinhead and Shirley  Here it comes folks  Another year of  Puttin jokes  All the sweaters have to have  The L taken off  And a big C on them  Jesus  Watch out  Access Hollywood  Might be listening  Big ragu head  Cigars and scotch  That was terrible  Hey you know what  I didn't know this  Brad's got a little info  On Subo  Yes Brad  What do you know  On Subo  Yeah 
[03:47:00]  I don't know  If anyone's brought up  That she  Was actually an actress  In Home Alone 2  Lost in New York  She played the homeless  Pigeon lady  That's funny  Good observation  Oh my goodness  This just in  An agent says  Penny Marshall fine  Not battling brain tumor  An agent for director  Penny Marshall  Has denied a tabloid report  That the star is sick  With a brain tumor  They're saying her last  Few movies may imply that  That's good 
[03:47:30]  Penny Marshall is fine  Jesus Christ  She looks like a guy  In the witness protection program  Sorry I didn't mean to say  Anything mean  Frank I apologize  Come on  I'd like to know  What Frank likes about the show  Next time he plays  I don't care  Here's the thing with Frank  Frank wants to be a part  Of the show somehow  And he wants to somehow be  It's like  I wouldn't mind it as much  If he just admitted that  Yeah  All right  Agent said that he called  Penny Marshall yesterday 
[03:48:00]  But didn't talk to her  Because she kept answering  Her shoe  She's fine  That's funny  Hello  Hello  She has to wear two hats now  She has to cut a hole in her hat  So the thing grows through  And put a hat on top of that  With a wig  So it looks like  Two hat bitch  That's what black guys call  Yo who that two hat bitch  Yo lumpy headed two hat bitch 
[03:48:30]  You know I was going to do  One more thing  But fuck  Let's get out of here  Let's go  Yeah man  I want to go  I'm fucking sleepy  That's why I said  Let's get out of here  When do we have  Mary Weiland in  Sometime this week  Scott Weiland's ex-wife  Is coming in this week  Should be a really good interview  Yeah we have a good week  Of guests this week  Yeah  Yes  Who else we got  Rob Halford's coming in  Halford  Pendulet  Pendulet is always good radio  Always good  And I know his boys  Listen to the show  Big ups to those guys  Did you guys have a disagreement 
[03:49:00]  Last time he was on  No first time he was on  We did  First time  And then afterwards  On what  I actually forget  Build on you  And then afterwards  We talked a little bit  During the break that time  And we just didn't agree  On something  And then when he came back in  He's like  I saw your HBO special  It was really good  And we just  Oh okay  He kissed your ass  And everything's fine  Alright just checking  No he doesn't seem  Like the type that would  I don't think he's  You can't really classify  Penn as an ass kisser  Yeah  He's a pretty fucking  Opinionated dude  But no it was cool  I fucking love Pendulet  Yeah I like him too  He does great radio  Let's plug our fucking
