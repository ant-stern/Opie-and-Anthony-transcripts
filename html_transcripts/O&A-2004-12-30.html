<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the negative aspects of divorce, particularly the financial burdens on men. Opie and Anthony shared personal anecdotes about their own divorces, using crude and offensive language, focusing on alimony payments and the perceived injustices of the legal system. Anthony recounted his disastrous engagement and marriage in great detail, including a humorous story about a cheap engagement ring bought in Penn Station, a poorly executed proposal, and an underwhelming wedding.  He also made disparaging remarks about women and their physical changes after marriage.  The conversation touched upon the general dislike of weddings and then transitioned to a comparison of the annoyances of being in a relationship versus being single.  The segment concluded with a brief mention of Anthony's past experiences with firearms.

The show then shifted to Anthony's childhood in the Mojave Desert. He recounted a wild upbringing involving firearms, dune buggies, and tequila, with minimal parental supervision. A graphic description of an accidental shooting involving his father and an antique revolver, resulting in a gunshot wound to young Anthony, was recounted.  His brother, Joe, joined the conversation, sharing explicit details of their early sexual experiences, including a story about Anthony's encounter with a 19-year-old woman at age 13, facilitated by his father, and a separate story of them having simultaneous sexual encounters with different women in the same house. Joe also described a two-week bus trip from California to New York with unsavory companions and their subsequent arrest. The segment included tangents about bathroom habits at the radio station and listener calls recounting their own embarrassing sexual experiences. Profanity and vulgar language were prevalent throughout.

The next segment focused on graphic and humorous discussions of bowel movements and bathroom experiences at the radio station.  Opie and Anthony shared anecdotes about their workplace bathroom, including a janitor (referred to as "Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS") who assisted with difficult defecations, and detailed their own bathroom habits and mishaps. They also discussed sexual encounters in the workplace and graphically described the illness of a co-worker, Ben, who was suffering from severe diarrhea and vomiting. The segment concluded with a discussion about the difficulties of booking A-list celebrities for the show, mentioning attempts to contact George Clooney, Johnny Depp, and Brad Pitt.  Several callers participated in this segment.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about a missed opportunity to take a photo with Bono at an *Saturday Night Live* after-party and then shifted to a detailed, often vulgar, discussion of fraternity hazing, fueled by caller accounts.  Callers described humiliating and potentially dangerous hazing rituals, including paddlings, forced water consumption, blindfolded obstacle courses involving feces (later revealed to be bananas or marshmallows), and a description of a gang-rape. A running gag about using marshmallows inappropriately in hazing was prominent.  The segment ended with a discussion of a failed publicity stunt outside the *Today Show* studios.

Finally, the show covered the performance of a promotional employee, Eric, and then transitioned to Jim Norton recounting two stories about Mike Tyson: one involving Tyson kissing a transsexual porn star named Vanity at a porn awards expo, and another about Tyson's appearance at a Christian Dior party at the Guggenheim Museum. The segment included numerous offensive calls from listeners targeting Norton's sexuality and making crude jokes about transsexual individuals. The hosts played a game identifying transsexual people in photographs online, using offensive language, and discussing transsexual surgeries in graphic detail.  A comedian made a brief appearance to share an anecdote.

[00:07:00]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen.  Some people are really fucking stupid.  Hit me!  It's the worst of the O.E. and Anthony show.  Damn!  Dude, how long ago did I get divorced?  I think it was 1999.  Five years ago?  Five years ago, things started.  And I'm still dealing with it. 
[00:07:30]  Like, I have to carry insurance.  Now, let me ask.  I have to get my ex-wife insurance.  So if I drop dead, she gets paid.  Can you believe that?  And I got there I was yesterday, writing another check.  It's painful.  It's amazing.  Guys get fucked.  Screwed.  Is there a certain amount of time you have to write checks for in a divorce?  Or is it like forever?  It's all negotiable.  Ready for this?  Anthony, can I say this?  You were married 10 years? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And you will be paying for more than 10 years, technically, when it's all said and done.  Yeah, it seems like I've got enough seven years to go or something.  How is that possible?  Seven years?  Like, oh, just writing the checks.  Hello.  Hello.  I sign her name and it's still my last name on there.  It's so annoying.  Can't you change that back?  Why do ex-wives feel compelled to keep the name?  Some of them.  Some of them don't.  Because they can't do anything on their own. 
[00:08:30]  Yep.  Simple as that.  Wants to make it easier.  Like, keep the name.  Can't do anything on their own and don't want to do anything on their own.  I guess.  I know a little bit of something about your ex and she doesn't do anything.  Except spend your money.  That's all she does.  That's it.  She hasn't done anything to better herself.  Because she's living off your dollar.  Well, what are you going to do?  Well, all women.  Like hitting the lottery.  Wouldn't all women be ashamed to just take a check for doing nothing?  I mean, any woman.  Who knew marrying me was hitting the lottery? 
[00:09:00]  Who saw that one coming?  Who saw it?  I did.  I did.  You saw that one coming?  Man, when I was knocking tin up in an attic.  Can you imagine?  Who knew the investment in time would really pay off?  You know?  Yeah, that's pretty wild.  There I was making my $27,500 a year in attics.  And now she gets paid for a decade because she was married to you.  I thought I won the lotto because she was a bartender. 
[00:09:30]  I got free drinks.  To me, that was winning the lotto.  Wrong.  I'd get done with work, hop down to the bar in Greenlawn, and just start chugging beers and shots.  That was lotto to me.  You mean I don't have to pay for booze ever again?  This is fantastic.  Oh, you're going to be paying for that booze, my friend.  Oh, are you going to pay?  Those free shots were about $1,000 a piece.  Yeah, why don't you do the new math now and figure out how much those shots actually cost you. 
[00:10:00]  I'm going to do the new math.  I bet you if someone out there was handy with a calculator and a pen and we gave them a few figures, I think those same shots you did for free way back in the day would cost you about $1,000 per shot now.  I don't even need a calculator.  I can round it off and pretty much figure it comes out to a lot.  A lot.  It comes out to a lot of cash.  Guys just get reamed, man.  And you know something?  I'm just thankful I do have something.  You know, because if I was just some guy that's working for a living and you're still paying through the nose, that's got to hurt. 
[00:10:30]  Well, you know, at this point, I don't...  I've still got the roof over my head and, you know, food.  At this point, I don't even understand why people get married.  I don't.  I could never do it again.  I don't think I'll ever get married at this point.  I don't know why I did it the first time.  I had a shot at it and it failed miserably, obviously.  Aww.  Aww.  But I don't think...  It's just not worth it.  It isn't.  Because you're putting too much trust in the whole damn process. 
[00:11:00]  You could be in, you know, complete love with somebody and the worst thing you can do is get married.  Why have the paperwork?  Why have the legal binding contract that all it can do, all it can ever do is bite you in the ass?  Right.  That's all it is.  It's all it can do.  If you're in love with each other and you're living together or, you know, sharing your life together, that's fine. 
[00:11:30]  All good could come from that.  What's the paperwork for?  Why do you need this friggin' document that will turn around and cost you money and pain down the road?  And no reason for it.  And in most cases, the guy gets screwed, obviously.  I mean, when we talk about divorce, you'll get a few guys call and say, no, I actually made out in my divorce.  Oh, you get ladies that call up and say, it was horrible.  I got screwed.  I was the one that bought the house.  Right.  Exception to the rule, ladies. 
[00:12:00]  But in general, let's be honest, the guys get screwed.  So you're getting married just to throw this contract in a drawer somewhere where someday it's going to haunt you.  And a lot of guys end up staying in a marriage because they know they're going to get screwed if they try to get out of it.  So then they have to, you know, live and be miserable.  Yep.  Knowing that they really want to get out of the marriage, but they just can't afford to do it.  Ben's smiling.  We had a guy.  He was just telling me the other day about some of his friends that are just getting screwed.  His friends got married and just, it's the typical story. 
[00:12:30]  You just change the names.  It's awful.  We had a guy, a sales guy at WNEW who was making a really good living, really good living.  But he got divorced and his wife got everything, like a really nice house in Westchester.  Oh, you get out of the house.  And, you know, he had to take care of the children as well, which he had no problem with.  When it was all said and done, he was living in a little box here in Manhattan.  Yep.  Still making a ton of money for WNEW, but it was all going to his apps.  The only thing he could afford was, like, a tiny one-bedroom apartment. 
[00:13:00]  It's got to be great for a man to get married, work his ass off, buy that dream house for him and his bride.  And for whatever reasons, guys or girls, could be their fault, either one, whatever, I'm not even getting into that.  But whatever the reason is, there he has to move out, get some shithole apartment somewhere.  As his ex now lives in the house that his sweat and blood bought, as she's, you know, maybe now banging some guy in his bedroom that he bought and paid for. 
[00:13:30]  It's just, there's no reason.  Yeah, so why would you do that?  Why would you do that to yourself?  Well, I just, it doesn't make sense anymore.  There probably was a time it really made a lot of sense until the lawyers got their, you know, their greasy hands involved in this whole process, you know?  There should be no reason.  Now you're just taking way too much for granted.  You're just assuming that you're going to be in a really happy, loving relationship for the rest of your life. 
[00:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  And in most cases, that's not going to be the case.  So you're signing away, you're signing away your life as you know it.  This was from the older days when women were incapable of taking care of themselves in the world.  What they did was they hooked up with a strong man who worked and she raised the family.  And if something happened to the guy and he wasn't insured or they got a divorce, the woman was pretty much left out in the cold. 
[00:14:30]  So all kinds of laws were made and divorce law was made and now the women have to be supported by the guy.  But it's 2004 now, people, and we're still living with this system that, you know, the guy, the woman can go out and support herself as a human being.  You know, you don't need the guy paying for you to live now, but it still happens.  What about the guy? 
[00:15:00]  He's got to work and support himself.  Well, that's not easy.  99% of the people out there aren't, you know, earning enough that they could pay for two people separately.  And there he is, buying a little or renting a little shithole as the woman gets the house, the cars.  You know, you've got to sell everything.  Anything fun you might have had in your life, that boat that you had, the motorcycle, that all has to get sold.  It's a disgrace.  It's awful.  Why would you do it? 
[00:15:30]  Why?  If you're getting married, there are some guys right now listening going, oh my God, they'll have a wedding right around the corner.  Right around the corner.  And right now, cancel your wedding.  Cancel it.  Cancel it.  I mean, in the end, you're going to lose.  Simple as that.  If you're truly in love, you'll get over it.  And trust me, God will understand.  Yeah.  If you're getting married because of the whole, you know, you have to be married in God's eyes or whatever, he'll understand in the end.  I'll tell you why people get married, especially guys.  It's because of their families.  They're getting married for their families. 
[00:16:00]  That's one reason.  For the girl.  That's another reason.  It's her day.  A lot of guys don't want to get married.  They get pushed into it.  Guys would rather live with a girl, and that's it.  Send it right there.  Girls want to get married.  And the families want their children to be married.  And that's why people do it.  When you're walking down that aisle, when you're ready to give those vows, you're not thinking this is great.  You're thinking, holy shit, what the hell is going on?  I'm signing a legal binding document that can only hurt me. 
[00:16:30]  In the end.  And most weddings just stink, let's be honest.  They stink.  That whole tradition.  You know, you pick out a reading.  You don't even know what it is.  You just know it sounds good, and you'll...  Oh, that stupid letter to the Corinthians thing.  Some sap gets up and starts reading it.  Half those readings, what?  You don't mean this.  You just picked it from a book.  Just so your aunt could start crying in the front row.  And I love that will last forever, and... 
[00:17:00]  Shut up.  She's up at the podium shaking, shaking, nervous, reading hands.  Oh, and you're sitting there looking at your watch.  You shouldn't look at your watch if this is an event people, you know, put on, taking years to plan.  But everyone's looking at their watch because it's just boring as hell.  It's the same crap you've been through a thousand times.  Oh, here they come.  They're lighting the candles together.  Oh, look at them light the candles.  Take some pictures of that.  Right. 
[00:17:30]  So we can tear them in half when they get the divorce.  Here's something for the people getting married out there.  Most people don't want to go to your wedding.  Right.  They have no fucking desire to go to your wedding.  You've been friends with them forever.  Yes, I understand that.  They don't want to be there.  They bitch the whole time to other people going,  Oh, man, Saturday, it's a long weekend, and I have to go to Blah Blah's wedding.  I know I've been friends with him since childhood, but I don't want to freaking go.  I'd rather play golf.  I'd rather do this.  I'd rather do anything.  But how many times do you say that? 
[00:18:00]  I've got another wedding to go to.  Another wedding.  And then you go.  I'm at the point now in my life, I get invited to a wedding.  It's got to be somebody really close to me.  And I don't go to the church.  I refuse.  I show up at the reception.  Give me a couple of drinks.  I'll come, a couple of drinks, hang out, I'll goof on the people, and then I'm out.  Will you ever see me on the conga line that goes through the kitchen of the reception hall?  Look at them.  They're doing the conga.  There they go. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, look.  Grandma's at the end.  Oh, what a mess.  It's nothing spontaneous.  It's the same wedding.  It's this cookie-cutter, stamped-out thing with just new victims.  New future courtroom victims sitting up.  Cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling.  Oh, look.  They're kissing.  Same music played.  The same dopey DJs playing.  Daddy's little girl. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  We get it.  Daddy's little girl.  Oh, everyone's crying.  Now, if we could get everyone up to dance.  No.  I will not entertain you.  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, let's hear it for Mr. and Mrs. Blech.  Oh, look.  The bridal party's holding their arms up to make a little tunnel.  Here they come, running through.  Get the picture.  The photographer is taking all the pictures.  We want to get the bridal party outside on the grass.  It's a beautiful day.  Now, guys, could you roll your pant leg up and kick? 
[00:19:30]  What the fuck is that?  What is that shot?  And here's something else.  Don't waste your time on getting the pictures done because you'll never look at them.  You'll never look at them.  You'll look at them, you know, once and then you'll throw them in a drawer somewhere.  Oh, no one wants to see them.  No one wants to see them.  And you see the happy couple that just got married.  Give them maybe a year, and then they're going to be just as miserable as all the other couples, you know, looking on at the wedding. 
[00:20:00]  Because they're together?  No.  Because they're married.  Because they're married.  I think as soon as you get married, I don't know because I haven't done it.  I'll give you any info you want on it.  And at this point, I just don't see the point at all.  There's no upside.  I think that if you're not married, you keep the excitement going.  You do?  No, I think so.  You absolutely do.  Because I think there's always that thing like you're not really, you know, the person can leave the relationship at any given time. 
[00:20:30]  So it makes you work a little harder.  Danger factor?  It makes you work a little harder.  Maybe you won't cut your hair and start looking like your buddy Phil all of a sudden.  Maybe you won't gain those 15 pounds just because, ha, we're married now.  It don't matter anymore.  Do you think?  Maybe, you know, maybe you'll close the door instead of taking a shit in front of your husband.  It's just over at that point.  But if you're still living with someone, I think the excitement's still there and you got that in the back of your head.  Yeah, they can leave at any time. 
[00:21:00]  Do you think that bull dyke haircut is attractive?  And, hey, ladies, of course, of course, there are millions of instances that girls could give of their guys getting out of shape and ridiculous.  Oh, and you know what?  It's fair to say it works both ways is what I'm saying.  Right.  You know?  You live with a girl or something, you know, I think the guys are working a little harder, too.  Like, well, you know, hey, she could be leaving for, you know, someone tomorrow.  Right.  You know, there's something about it, I think, that just makes you try a little harder. 
[00:21:30]  Try a little harder.  Keep yourself in shape, you know, try to be a little more romantic.  That frigging mom haircut.  Don't leave your, you know, your streak-stained underwear just laying around.  There you go.  You clean up a little bit better.  Right.  And when the moms cut that hair, when these wives, they reach a point and give that haircut where they look like their husband's friends that he plays cards with.  You think that's good? 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  They put on those clothes that try to cover up the world of hurt.  What's going on?  For all the young guys out there thinking they want to get married, here's something.  Take the Long Island Railroad from Huntington to Penn Station on Matinee Day.  What is Matinee Day?  I think it's Wednesday, right?  Wednesday.  All these older ladies getting together to go to a Broadway show. 
[00:22:30]  They're all going to a Broadway show.  We're going to the show.  And a lot of these women, a lot of these women aren't even that old yet.  No.  No, they're not.  And I said to my husband, I'm going to Matinee.  And when I come home, this lawn had better be cut.  Dude, there are these women that you see on the Long Island Railroad go on the matinees, they're more manly than a lot of men I've seen. 
[00:23:00]  I don't know what happened.  There's like some kind of hormone thing.  Hormones.  Has happened already.  There's something going on where they are getting these huge doses of male hormones because, yeah, their bodies take on a masculine shape.  They're very wide at the shoulders, narrower at the hips, and they cover it up with those sweatshirt things.  And then their hair, they cut it. 
[00:23:30]  They get the fill hairdo.  Fill hair.  Fill.  Fill.  The fill haircut.  And their, I don't know, their faces and skin have this more manly look to it.  They've just given up.  Could be all the smoking they're doing.  The smoking.  Just drying out their faces.  They just give up.  I used to take that train because when we were doing afternoon driving, I'm like, I was horrified.  Like, this is.  Is this the future?  This is.  Is this the train to the future? 
[00:24:00]  This is what's going to happen.  But, if you're not married, and there's that out, like Opie said, both sides work a little harder.  I think so.  Both sides work a little harder to keep things going.  They're not bound in a legal, binding, corporate relationship.  My dream was always to kind of have a rock star-like relationship.  What is that?  Completely settled.  Rod Stewart drinking out of Jagger's mule until he's got to get his stomach pumped. 
[00:24:30]  Settle with someone.  Know within both parties' hearts that you're not going anywhere, but you don't have to make it official.  Right.  I think that's a hell of a lot more exciting than doing the cookie-cutter wedding in front of your stupid family and friends.  I got married at a bar.  I didn't even do the whole wedding thing.  I got married at the bar that my mother worked at.  That was pretty much it.  No one was affording anything. 
[00:25:00]  And you know what it is now?  It's a strip club.  Is it really?  The place I got married is now a strip club in Comac, on Comac, New York, out on Long Island.  That's it.  It speaks volumes.  And I actually went to Bill Brady, Habille, Cowbell Bill.  Went to his bachelor party at that very strip club.  Really?  The place you got married at?  My wedding place, Opie.  I was shoving dollar bills down Russian chicks' G-strings.  That's so cool.  You had a horrific wedding, I believe. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, the wedding, the marriage, everything.  It was just a nightmare.  I didn't know what I was doing.  The engagement ring.  The engagement ring.  One of my favorite stories ever.  I should have known then.  I mean, it all adds up now.  In hindsight, it all adds up.  I, for some reason, decided it was time for me to get married.  I think because my life was kind of not going anywhere, I thought that might have been a direction to go to kind of hook things up. 
[00:26:00]  Would have started the ball rolling.  Yeah, why would you get married?  I had a shit job, right?  I lived in a, I lived in a hovel.  I lived in a hovel.  I gave you my best to Jerry.  My spot.  My spot online.  Yeah, you know, why don't you give me that DVD back, all right?  You're not getting your King of Comedy DVD back.  I'm sorry.  All right, go ahead.  So I thought, I guess, I'm not even sure, it's psychobabble to me, but I guess I thought if I had gotten married, that it would push me in a direction I had to be, which was a little more responsible. 
[00:26:30]  Maybe I'd get a better job because of it, maybe a little more respect.  I don't know.  I just, I thought, I thought it was what I should do.  Apparently I was wrong.  I thought it was what I should do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I decide, I'm going to get married. 
[00:27:00]  So I, what do you do when you get married?  You get a ring.  Were you into it ever?  Let me seriously assess this.  No.  I really wasn't into it.  I really wasn't into it.  Did you like do it because you felt like, I don't know, everyone else was getting married?  No one else was really getting married.  So why did you get married if you really weren't into it?  Like I said, I thought it was one of those things I should do.  I had reached a point in my life where it was like, oh my God, I'm just, I'm acting like this irresponsible kid for my whole life. 
[00:27:30]  And boy, that didn't stop, did it?  No.  Thank God.  Never stopped.  And I thought if I got married, it would be a way that I would go to the next level where I would get, you get married, and then I would get the good paying job, and then I would get the house.  It was like a piece of a puzzle that had to be there for the other pieces.  You know?  It was a rung on a ladder, Opie. 
[00:28:00]  It was time for me to do that.  Stupid move.  But what did I know?  So you're ready to get married, you've got to get the ring.  That's the first step, right?  I put this off, and it shows what was going through my head.  I put things off.  I put it off.  I put it off.  I didn't put money away for a ring.  I had no money.  No offense to this day.  You still do exactly that.  Oh, I do.  I do.  I put things off.  But the good thing is now, Infinity Broadcasting has afforded me the opportunity, by paying us for sitting and doing nothing, where I can put things off, and then just, like they say, you just throw money at a problem. 
[00:28:30]  It tends to go away.  That's kind of what it is.  I could pay for things, which is good, and that helps when you're irresponsible.  At the time, I didn't have the proverbial pot to piss in or window to throw it out of, and I had to get a ring.  I had to get a ring.  So where do you go? 
[00:29:00]  Where do people go to buy wedding rings?  Tiffany's.  Tiffany's.  People go there.  What was that place in Huntington?  Bailey Banks and Biddle.  Wow.  They go there.  That's where Trump's son went.  The place near the mall on Jericho Turnpike.  Oh, the Diamond Exchange?  No.  Carrot Shop or something like that?  Something like that?  Whatever.  Even if you wanted to get a maybe lower-end diamond, you would go to one of the lower-end jewelry stores, but you go to a jewelry store.  I was getting on a train to go up to Massachusetts to propose on Christmas Day. 
[00:29:30]  That sounds like a very romantic thing.  In front of her entire family for the first time me meeting them.  Now, I have never met the family.  I am ready to meet the family for the first time.  I'm driving up to Massachusetts in my Volkswagen Beetle.  Nice.  It was a Baja Bug, which had been to take the fenders off with a fiberglass Baja kit on for off-roading because I was such a responsible adult. 
[00:30:00]  I had a dune buggy as my mode of transportation.  My mode of transportation, dune buggy, which I'm driving up.  Now, if you've ever been to Massachusetts in December, it's cold.  It's cold now in Massachusetts.  December, I had no heat in this dune buggy, and the cold air just blew in.  I had to cover myself and drive in blankets. 
[00:30:30]  Here's the prize that's coming up to the other prize that is going to, you know, hook up.  Here's the guy coming up saying, I'm going to take your little girl.  Right.  Wow.  Were you excited?  I had a link from the Mod Squad afro at the time, too.  I mean, my hair was just...  When I first met you, you still had crazy hair.  I looked like a walking mushroom.  Yeah.  Looked like you should be playing for the band Boston.  Right, right.  I looked like Sib the drummer. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, big time.  Big time.  If you've got that old album laying around, that's Anthony's hairdo.  Right up until I met him, matter of fact.  So I drive, that was when I went to propose, but I had to go to the, when I drove up afterwards.  But to propose, I took the train to go to Penn Station.  Ready to get my ring.  I don't have it yet.  I don't have a ring, Opie.  So what do I do?  There's a jewelry store in Penn Station. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  There's a jewelry store in Penn Station.  Yeah.  And I walked in, and I found something that resembled my impression of an engagement ring.  It was, I don't even know what it was made out of.  It could have been silver.  I don't even know.  It's supposed to be gold.  And had this little alleged diamond. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, shit.  This piece of glass was in it.  What are you supposed to pay for a diamond?  It's supposed to be three months' salary.  Three months' salary.  Yeah, well, a wedding ring or engagement?  For an engagement ring.  Well, they put that in the girls' heads.  Right.  Three months' salary.  The diamond world has, yeah.  They all got together and said, look, if this lady's worth it, you need to, yeah.  I'm making 27.  Put three months of your salary into a ring. 
[00:32:30]  27,500 a year.  What's three months' salary?  Let's say 30 grand.  Well, then, yeah, that would be about 6,000.  Be about $6,000?  Yeah.  Wait, 6, 12.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  3, 6, 9, no.  Wait, we're going on three months.  Third of your salary.  Oh, third of your salary, 10,000.  10,000.  So it would be a little under 10,000.  27,000.  Oh, so, all right.  6,800.  9,000.  Yeah.  $9,000 on 27,000.  6,800. 
[00:33:00]  We stink.  No, it's a third, right?  Yeah.  27,000 you were making?  Yeah.  A third of that is 9,000.  Okay.  9,000, Jim.  That's easy.  That's easy math.  Wait, 27,500 divided by 12.  No, that's one month.  Huh?  Jim, divided by 12 is just one month.  You just keep being quiet over there.  We're doing fine right now.  Now times it by three.  Put your calculator away.  It's not working.  Aw.  Aw, Jimmy.  Looks so dejected.  He's trying to do some math. 
[00:33:30]  Look, he brought in rent boys.  Great.  Yeah.  Nine grand, we decided?  Nine grand is a third of your salary.  So me making 27,500, I should have put so much thought into this and thought about it  so much sooner and planned for this.  You know what kind of jesking you could have got for $9,000 back then?  I know what kind of, because I did.  All right.  So go ahead.  Nine grand it should have been.  All right.  What did my engagement ring cost? 
[00:34:00]  Opie, I spent $800.  $800 on an engagement ring.  And that was overpriced.  Believe me.  If I would have went out to Long Island or something and thought about it before I was  leaving.  That same ring probably would have been $500.  About $500.  Maybe even $300.  Because I think they jacked.  Oh, in Penn Station?  They jacked prices up at Penn Station.  Of course.  Of course they do.  But I picked it up and here I was, ready to make my trek up to propose. 
[00:34:30]  In the Baja.  In the Baja bug.  In the middle of winter.  In the middle of winter.  Or the start of winter is December.  So, yeah.  I go back to my house, pick up the bug, and took my trip up there.  And the family, her family was, it was Christmas Day.  So, there had been a, let's just say, plenty of Christmas cheer, plenty of Christmas cheer  was in the air at the house. 
[00:35:00]  The whole family was over.  And there was Scotch and Captain Morgan and boxes of wine more than you could ever imagine  all over the house.  And all the family was there.  And the first thing I did was downed two giant water glasses.  They were, they were like what you would give this huge water glasses. 
[00:35:30]  Wait, so you drove up in the Baja.  Yeah.  The 200 plus miles.  Yep.  Freezing your ass off.  You get to the door, and then what?  I think you skipped ahead here a little bit.  Well, yeah.  Did they greet you with open arms, the family?  Were they drunk?  Yeah, it was a couple of cousins.  A couple of cousins just hammered.  Hammered, hammered, all red-faced, going, hey, glad to meet you, Lance, you come to  fuck in and have a goddamn drink.  And I did.  And who knew you were proposing? 
[00:36:00]  Just you?  Just me and her.  Run!  Run!  I know.  I could have bolted right then and there.  Run!  I could have bolted.  But any reservations or anything went out the window after I downed two huge water glasses  full of Captain Morgan.  Captain Morgan.  Arr, matey!  Don't matter.  You can get married.  Arr!  The captain says it's okay.  Quite the crappy little bounty you got there in that ring box. 
[00:36:30]  I wouldn't bury that treasure in a cat box.  Arr, matey.  But you're here.  You're here anyway.  You weathered the storm to come up.  You might as well take the plunge.  Arr!  I was hoping a rapier would go through my chest at that moment, but the captain said, go ahead.  The captain said it was okay.  He had his leg up on the little box and he was going, Arr, matey! 
[00:37:00]  Have a nither!  And, uh...  So you got the $800 ring in your pocket.  Yep.  You're hammered now.  I had quite the little buzz on.  The family's there.  The family's there.  The lovely lady is there.  Yeah.  With hope in her eyes.  Wanting in her eyes.  Oh, yes.  And I was, uh...  I gave her her Christmas present.  I did what a lot of guys do.  They could save money by, you know, doing the engagement ring and the Christmas present. 
[00:37:30]  It's all in one.  It's an all-in-one!  Did you, uh...  Place it in a really big box and then a smaller box and then a smaller box and then a smaller box?  I had this original idea!  This funny...  Look, she's unwrapping it.  Ugh.  So what, everyone was opening up presents?  Everyone was opening up presents.  And all of a sudden, you just casually...  Did you make everyone stop?  No.  No.  Which is red flag number two.  If I really wanted to do this, I would have wanted everyone around. 
[00:38:00]  If I was proud of my ring, I would have wanted everyone around.  Believe me, I wanted to do this down at a drugstore down on the corner.  You want to step out a minute here?  You want to come down to the garage?  Yeah, it was time.  And, um...  I don't even remember exactly what I said.  Oh, I know.  Could I have another drink?  That's what I said first.  Keep them coming, matey-ar!  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  I think I just did the standard, you know, will you marry me?  Was there tears?  Will you marry me?  There were tears in your eyes.  I remember her mother, like, gasped.  You know that ring has now cost you a good bill?  Probably.  Oh, dude.  That ring's very expensive.  That's very expensive.  That's the point we're trying to make to the guys out there.  See, you'd think it'd make sense at the time, but you're still paying for that ring. 
[00:39:00]  That ring's very expensive.  Don't you wish the Baja crashed on the way to Massachusetts?  You know, it might have been easier to deal with had it just spun out on the mass pike,  rammed into an abutment, burst into flames, would have been warm.  So then did she run around the room showing everybody the ring?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and everyone was like, well, congratulations! 
[00:39:30]  Anyone give you the look like you cheap bastard?  I never saw that look.  Maybe I just didn't want to see it, but that was probably the most pathetic engagement ring I've ever seen in my life.  And then you get friends, you know, that go, oh, look, and they show up their engagement rings, and they're just these huge rocks.  You can't even understand how anyone could afford it.  And there was that little, what size was it?  I'm trying to think of something that's that size, but I really can't. 
[00:40:00]  It was so small, a little grain of sand, like a little pebble.  Wow.  It was nothing.  Oh, let me see, is that, yeah.  See, there's the Boston picture.  We ought to put that up on the website.  Yeah, that's how Anthony's hair looked.  Yeah.  The first Boston album.  Sib from Boston, the drummer.  And that was, you know, that was the beginning.  I had a little, for the wedding, had a little party at the house that I was living at, where everyone came over. 
[00:40:30]  Had it in the backyard.  Talk about just white trash.  One guy's screaming on the phone, it's a quarter of your salary, it's a fourth of your salary, not a third, you tool.  Hey, ass cock!  I saw the commercial 8,000 times.  It said three months' salary, you jerk-off.  Three, six, nine, twelve.  That is a quarter.  Okay.  It's a fraction, idiot! 
[00:41:00]  It's a quarter.  Three, six, nine, twelve.  Well, Anthony, you didn't come close to a tenth, all right?  No, I didn't come close to a tenth.  That's the point of this story.  That's the point, John.  Don't worry about fractions.  We don't.  Yes, it is a quarter.  All right.  So what was a quarter?  You'll listen to us, because we're math majors.  Jim probably right now.  Let's relax, everybody.  Jimmy was right.  Yeah, Jimmy knew he was right, too.  Wait, you were right the whole time?  Yeah, he knew.  And I told you to shut up, and that's why you gave me that look, like you wanted to kill  me?  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I'm not reading out of your book, though.  Oh!  For your lack of math skills, he took my cock. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, everyone's writing.  It's 6,875.  Isn't that what you said?  Jesus.  Yeah, exactly what Jimmy said.  And I'm berating you, like, you ass shut up.  You idiot.  Put your calculator away, Mr. Calculator.  And I'm all confident.  I'm like, I know, man.  It's coming through like a million times.  Oh, people are just angry.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  Will you accept my apology?  Math wasn't the point of the story, people. 
[00:42:00]  You don't listen to the show, because we're math majors.  We stink at math.  And many other things.  But go ahead.  Yeah, it was, you know, we had a little party, had the wedding at my mother's bar.  And then it was, you know, we did the whole actual ceremony thing in front of a Justice  of the Peace down there in Northport.  Had to drive into Northport and go to the Justice of the Peace.  And then it was it.  Then it's like, holy shit, I'm married.  And when did you realize you, I already know the answer to this. 
[00:42:30]  You made a mistake?  Yeah.  The night.  The night of the wedding.  See, the story never changes.  I'm always testing you.  Oh, the night of the wedding.  The night of the wedding, you knew you made a mistake.  And then ten years later, you finally got out.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ten years.  I hung in there for ten years.  Nine and change.  I don't know why.  Why would I do that?  Why would I torture myself?  But I did.  I hung in there thinking, ah, maybe the better job's around the corner. 
[00:43:00]  And you know something?  It was.  The better job was around the corner.  Maybe my plan was working.  I had gotten married.  And then, I guess, five years, four and a half, five years later, I got the better job.  I was going off back to up to Massachusetts to do radio.  What a coincidence and what a convenience, Opie.  Thank you so much that our first gig was a mile away from my mother-in-law's house. 
[00:43:30]  Could have been anywhere in the United States.  Is it safe to assume that the Opie and Anthony show, in its birth, in its birth, would have gone anywhere in the country had we gotten a good offer?  Yeah, if you remember.  From New York to L.A., from Montana to Texas, we would have gone anywhere to start the show.  If you remember, I don't think we've ever talked about this on the air, but when we were working at BAB and I started sending out tapes, when you and I started working together, we were getting hit. 
[00:44:00]  People were interested all over the country right away, which is crazy.  I'm going to bring in our first show someday.  And that was after only working together for like three months.  And Dallas wanted us really bad, if you remember.  Could have been Dallas.  It was between Dallas and the end.  It was between Dallas and Worcester.  Could have been.  Worcester slash Boston.  Let's say anywhere from Spokane, Washington to Miami.  Yeah.  Bangor, Maine to San Diego. 
[00:44:30]  Anywhere in between, we could have ended up, right?  Mm-hmm.  I'm a mile away from my mother-in-law.  Yeah, the radio station was a mile away.  A mile away.  Mm-hmm.  How did that happen?  It was the better offer.  And there I found myself in my Dodge Ares K car.  Oh, yeah, I was stepping up.  I'd gotten rid of the bug.  I got a Dodge Ares K car driving back up.  That was on blocks when I first came to your crib.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Your awful crib.  Yeah.  I remember turning on the air conditioner once and white smoke came out.  I thought it was in a James Bond movie.  So you realized that you made a mistake the night of the wedding.  Yeah, yeah.  There you are on your wedding night, which is supposed to be a night full of romance, right?  Well, hardcore sex.  Night full of romance.  Hardcore sex.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Those cute little panties that the women get at their bachelorette party and all that.  Yeah, those are just torn off. 
[00:45:30]  And then you get down to just bumping uglies.  Well, Opie, sometimes it doesn't work out that way.  Sometimes it works out where maybe there was a little too much partaking in some alcoholic beverages.  And maybe somebody's not in any condition to get a little romantic.  And maybe the other person's laying back, staring at the ceiling, thinking, oh, my God, what have I done?  Oh, my God, what have I done? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  So why didn't you get out at that point?  Because it wasn't like you were going to lose a lot of money.  I don't know.  That was not part of the plan.  And you told me once, like, you were staring at the ceiling, and dare I say, there was a little tear in your eye, Anthony.  A little tear in your eye.  Rolling down, going, oh, my God, what have I done?  Yeah, yeah.  That is just tragic.  It was not a good day.  But I hung in there for another nine years.  I hung in there.  So you didn't have sex.  Because it was not part of the plan. 
[00:46:30]  You didn't have sex on your wedding night.  I have no recollection of that, sir.  I have no recollection of that, sir.  I'm not going to cross certain boundaries in this conversation.  Oh, okay.  That might get me into problems.  All right.  More trouble?  Yeah.  You can't get in more trouble, can you?  Hey, hey, hey, who knows, huh?  All I'm saying is certain parties were, you know, partook a little too much, and other parties were regretful.  Wow.  Wasn't there fights, too? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, there were plenty of fights.  No, I know that.  I know that personally.  I used to get, whatever.  I used to get so freaking pissed off.  But anyway, no, I'm talking about it during the wedding.  Yeah, yeah.  Or the reception.  There was a, yeah, there was something going on.  My brother was trying to pick up on my brand new wife's cousin or something, or just even talking to her.  I don't even know what the story was.  And, well, your brother's here.  She took offense to it.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  My brand new bride took offense to it and started yelling at my mother, calling my brother an asshole.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  This is, oh, my goodness.  This is just not good.  This is just not good.  And she's calling your brother an asshole to your mom on your wedding night or the reception or whatever.  Yeah, my mother's just kind of staring back like, oh, this is good.  This is great.  Picked a good one there.  That's a good one.  So, yeah, yeah, nine years I hung in there, nine more years. 
[00:48:00]  No, you've hung in there longer because you've been paying for an extra five hours.  Well, no, I hung in there for nine years, though.  I hung in there for nine years.  So, this nightmare has been going on 14 years.  So, for all the people out there thinking of getting married, take that with you today.  Yeah.  14 years later, you're still dealing with that.  I got the good job, though.  Yes, you did.  So, the plan kind of worked.  So, she was responsible for your career.  Could you go down to Sears, could you go down to Sears and get a garage door opener and put it in my garage? 
[00:48:30]  Sounds like a very easy thing to do.  Okay.  It's my Christmas vacation.  This one, before I was in radio, I'd knocked in and then I would have to go up every Christmas.  We'd have to visit every Christmas.  And there was a new thing for me to do.  I need some, we don't get any heat at all down in the basement.  Really?  Not, uh, no hot air and it's freezing down there. 
[00:49:00]  Really?  Would you be able to run some ductwork from the furnace into the TV room in the basement?  Okay.  There I am.  Mr. Okay.  Mr. Okie-dokie.  And during my Christmas vacation from Knocking Tin, I was knocking tin and hanging garage door openers.  I'm so happy now.  I'm in such a happy place now. 
[00:49:30]  I don't have to do anything anymore.  It's very peaceful.  No fighting.  I don't.  I bet you don't vacuum anymore.  I don't remember the last time I pulled out a vacuum.  And you know when it was?  I don't remember when it was, but I know the situation.  When I wanted to.  I looked around and said, I think I'm going to push a goddamn vacuum around the house.  Boo!  There you go.  Back in the closet with you.  See you whenever.  Yeah.  That's what I do. 
[00:50:00]  That's what I do now.  I don't have to do anything.  Anything I don't want to do anymore.  But during that time, I had to do it all.  I was taking the garbage out all the time.  A lot of guys take the garbage out.  But it was just that yelling thing about it.  That, you know, point made that it's my job.  There was a lot of yelling.  Oh, there was a lot of yelling.  There was a time Anthony and I hung out a lot.  A real lot.  And I can't remember one time that didn't have yelling. 
[00:50:30]  Not you and I.  There was always yelling.  There's no more yelling now.  And I hate yelling because I was brought up with yelling.  There's no more yelling now.  You yell at me.  I don't even listen to you anymore.  I don't even listen.  I don't yell.  My brain goes blank.  I don't yell.  No, you don't yell at all.  I don't yell anymore.  It had nothing to do with you.  No.  You would get yelled at over the stupidest things.  You know what it's like to get yelled at as a grown man?  Do you know understand what that is, ladies?  You don't yell at your husband. 
[00:51:00]  Yelling.  And you were a good guy.  And this is what used to piss me off.  She spilled my coffee.  This is what used to piss me off.  You were a good guy.  A really good guy.  What a great guy I am.  No, I'm talking about even back in those days.  I'm very passive.  I really put up with a lot of shit.  You were a really good guy.  It wasn't like you were banging broads or doing...  You were like a normal, nice guy doing... 
[00:51:30]  That is how it ended.  Doing what you thought was right.  Maybe I should have sooner.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  But it was about time.  It certainly was.  And then you're doing the right thing, and you're still just getting yelled at over the  stupidest things.  You just said, though, Ant, that you don't do...  Brother Joe.  Hey, brother Joe.  Hey, kids.  We told you to keep the microwave, brother Joe.  Good job, Ben.  You said...  I know.  You should have blocked me.  Mike blocked me.  You said that you can do anything you want, though.  Now you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do. 
[00:52:00]  Pretty much.  And I just can't believe that.  That is the reason...  That's the reason I live alone.  Oh, right.  I live with nobody.  I can truly do whatever I want or not do whatever I want whenever I want.  Just thought I'd bring out that point.  I can, too.  I got to tell you.  I am in an amazing relationship.  I love it.  I've been with the same girl five years, and I can do whatever I want. 
[00:52:30]  It's amazing.  Whatever I want to do.  I really do.  It's not like marriage.  I'm not being yelled at ever.  So then you wanted to go see that No Doubt concert.  Actually, I did.  I did.  Now it's cool to say...  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I don't know.  I felt like coming in and busting your chops.  Jesus Christ.  Busting your chops.  All right.  You want to start, asshole?  Let's go.  How about your fucking girlfriend?  Every two seconds, I got to hear, fucking bitch. 
[00:53:00]  Fuck this.  Fuck that fuck.  You get more aggravation not living with someone than I've ever seen with anyone that does  fucking live with someone.  I don't bitch.  When do I bitch?  When do I ever bitch about my girlfriend?  You're constantly bitching about your girlfriend.  Never.  Constantly.  Never.  Dude.  Always.  When?  I don't have to bitch about her.  And I told her...  She's not there.  She's not there often enough.  You kick her out of the fucking house sometimes.  Damn straight.  I've heard that.  Damn straight.  I've heard more shit from you about a girlfriend you don't live with.  Have you ever had the feeling that you wanted to, but you couldn't? 
[00:53:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  I'm in a great place.  I'm content.  I sit.  I don't have to yell.  I don't have to be yelled at.  That's my fucking life.  Then you're in a happy place.  And I love it.  I'm just saying, I can't live like that anymore.  Divorce has completely ruined me for women.  Well, that's true.  Completely, completely ruined me.  He had an even worse nightmare than I did.  Oh, yeah.  Even worse than I did.  It sucked.  Chick's smacking her face with a frying pan as she's looking at him in the face and then 
[00:54:00]  calls the cops.  And then call the cops.  Had me arrested.  Imagine a girl smiling.  Picture your wife smiling at you and then bashing herself in the face with a frying pan as  she's looking at you and then going, 9-1-1.  Oh, yeah.  Hello.  My husband just punched me in the face.  By direction of the same lawyer that was involved with...  Yeah.  Fun, fun, fun.  And then Joe had to leave the house.  Allegedly.  Joe had to leave the house.  Oh, yeah.  That he had bought. 
[00:54:30]  Wasn't allowed back in.  Nightmare.  Nightmare.  Anyone get married out there?  Like 9-11.  Anyone get married out there?  Never forget.  We will never forget.  Anyone get married out there?  And I know both these guys really well.  Trust me.  She hit herself in the face with a frying pan.  Joe's like me.  It wouldn't...  You know, there's no way by any stretch of the imagination...  Gee, we were raised by our mom.  You lay a hand on a woman.  We were raised to ever, ever lay a hand on a woman.  Ever.  Not even shake their shit out of it.  Nothing.  All right.  Although you do get some kind of satisfaction out of watching those Canadian PSAs, don't 
[00:55:00]  you?  Oh, she spilled my coffee.  How about a little variety?  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia have announced...  We hate women and we butt-sex each other.  No, we shouldn't be doing that.  The Anthony Show.  One of you guys could eat my ass right now.  It's fantastic.  It's not just for you.  Add up to four additional XM radios for only $6.99 a month per radio with XM Family Plan.

The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:30]  I was so into guns. I still am. I love guns. I love shooting guns, but at targets and stuff.  I'm not the hunter guy.  You know, I know what you mean.  I always feel...  I like, you know, making big bombs, dressing in trench coats, going to school.  You know, I just like guns.  Lay in the back of your car with a little hole cut in the trunk.  Yeah, that too. Sure, sure.  Driving around Washington.  Sitting and just waiting.  Hi, boo-boo!  Just take a few pot shots. 
[01:00:00]  We were, uh...  We used to...  When I lived in California...  All of my wacky stories, by the way, come in California.  Come from California.  Uh, we were out in the Mojave Desert.  We used to go out in the desert and just camp.  Me, my father, brother, these, uh...  Other families that we used to hang out with.  All Mexicans.  The Reyes family.  How old were you when you got your first gun?  Oh, uh...  It was my 12th birthday.  Yeah, 12th birthday.  I got a, uh... 
[01:00:30]  What the hell did I get?  Nice little Ruger.  Six-shooter.  Western-style.  Wore it on the hip.  Nice.  Low-slung holster.  You walked around with a loaded gun at 12?  Uh, 12, 13.  Around there.  It was...  It was...  Because we used to ride...  Ride fence, they called it.  Ride fence.  We had about 3,500 acres...  Or 35,000 acres.  Uh, that had cattle on it.  And I used to have to ride the, the, uh, barbed wire fence and then patch it up. 
[01:01:00]  Because the motorcycle guys used to come through and cut the fence.  And, uh, when you're up there in that, I was fully armed.  Had a, uh, a Winchester 30-30 on, in the scabbard.  And had my little, my little six-shooter on my hip.  A little skinny Anthony on a horse with a, with a little gun.  The motorcycle guys never screwed with me.  Why would they cut the fence?  Uh, to get their motorcycles through.  They would cut the fence and then, rah, continue on the way.  Because it was like great motocross up there.  But, you know, then all of a sudden your, your cattle gets out. 
[01:01:30]  So I was armed to the teeth.  And, uh, it was fun, you know, shooting cactus and rattlesnakes and stuff like that.  We went out into Mojave Desert where we also had dune buggies, guns, and tequila.  And, uh, we were a bunch of kids just drinking and shooting.  It was really, eh, eh.  But thank God everyone was safe.  Oh, wait.  No, everyone wasn't safe.  I'm so bummed I never got to meet your father, man.  Oh, he was insane.  He sounded like an unbelievable guy.  He was a madman.  It was, it was, uh, it was, uh.  No parenting whatsoever. 
[01:02:00]  No, gotta love it.  It was a carnival.  I'll tell you, though, as a guy between, like, 13 and 17 years old, it was the place to be.  I was gonna say, perfect, right?  No responsibility and just all excitement, adventure, and fun.  Whatever you wanted to do.  One day he just, uh, went out and bought a dune buggy.  You know, some days there wasn't food to eat.  But he had a goddamn dune buggy.  And it was a pisser, you know?  You're driving that thing around.  You're 14 years old, uh, wheeling around a dune buggy. 
[01:02:30]  Went out into the desert.  Uh, guns everywhere.  We're all wearing guns.  And, uh, this one kid.  Why would you go out to the desert just to party and, uh, ride the dune buggies?  Yeah, just to spend about a week, 10 days out.  Shoot a target, maybe?  This guy, Juan Reyes, had a silver mine out there.  It was, uh, an old, like, from the 40s, a silver mine.  But it had a little mining shack.  And we used to just camp out there and shoot and drink and, you know, hang out and drive the dune buggies around.  And, uh, this guy, Juan Reyes, had this old six-shooter. 
[01:03:00]  And it was the type that had no real safety on it.  The firing pin was directly on the hammer that you cocked back.  And the new ones don't have that.  The trigger has to be pulled and the hammer has to fall.  The old ones, if the hammer fell and the trigger wasn't pulled, it still went off.  And worse yet, you had a quarter cock it, which is kind of pull the hammer back, to load it.  Because you had to spin the cylinder around.  So he's putting the bullets in.  The thing's quarter cocked.  You ever hear it go off half-cocked?  That's kind of what it means.  Don't go off half-cocked.  He's loading it up. 
[01:03:30]  He raises this thing.  The hammer falls.  It's pointing right at his eight-year-old son.  Boom!  Bullet goes right in his left shoulder, above his heart, and right out the back.  I'm standing right there.  I'm looking right at the kid when it hits him.  How close were you to the kid?  I was about as close as I am to you right now.  About four feet away.  Wow.  So I'm looking, and I happen to be looking at him when this happened. 
[01:04:00]  Hits him right there.  He turns immediately white.  This tube, it looked like a plastic tube of blood, came out.  It was shaped perfectly round, like a water fountain.  Came shooting out of his, what I thought, chest.  I didn't even know it was his shoulder, because it was close to his heart.  Comes shooting out.  He goes, like, uttered something and fell right down to his knees.  I'm like, holy shit, I just saw his father kill his son right there.  And the father just lost his mind. 
[01:04:30]  Meanwhile.  Didn't you say the blood just kind of, like, started?  It did, like a tube.  Yeah, yeah.  It came pumping out.  I'm sorry, I was thinking of something.  It just went, like, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  So the father's like, oh, my God.  Like, everyone just freaked out.  It was a hell of a scene to be part of.  Is this in the woods now?  Oh, let me tell you where we were.  Grab a little map, people.  Well, this was between Barstow, California, and Needles, Arizona.  There's a little old highway that runs between it, and we were 50 miles in on dirt roads off 
[01:05:00]  the highway.  50 miles in.  Before you get to the highway that takes you another whatever it is to Barstow or Needles,  they decided to go to Needles, Arizona, to go to the hospital there, but they just loaded  them up in the pickup truck, packed ice on them, wrapped it up, and took off.  And hours later, I mean 10, 12 hours later, the cops came back to do a little investigation  because it was a shooting.  They came back with guys that were just armed like crazy because they had no idea what was 
[01:05:30]  happening out here.  Group of guys in the Mojave Desert, there's a shooting.  They're thinking cult or something.  Yeah, they came out of those, they had big Suburbans, and they just came out of there  like, you know, everybody come out of the mining shack.  Everyone, please come out of the mining shack.  We want to see everybody's hands.  Did a little investigation.  Little Charlie Reyes lived.  It was in his shoulder, and that was that.  But it was the first and only time I ever saw someone get shot. 
[01:06:00]  Thought he was dead, too.  That looked like just a heart shot.  What did you do after that?  His whole shirt turned.  Did you just run away and hide, cry?  I mean, what did you do?  It was like we were all shaken, like freaked out.  So we went in and just did massive shots of tequila.  You're 12.  Yeah.  No, I think I was 13 or 14 or something.  All right.  But yeah, that makes it better.  When did you lose touch with Charlie Reyes?  When I came back to New York, probably about 17 years old.  And you never saw him again?  No, I saw him not since then, no. 
[01:06:30]  But he was fine.  You know, he had a little brace on him, and it went in and right out.  It was a 22, so it wasn't like a 38, take his little 8-year-old arm off.  But to see a little 8-year-old kid just, like, hit his knees and go,  I'm dead.  Like, he said something like, I'm dead.  I'm dead.  Holy shit.  That kid just got shot.  If you slow it down, it was probably, hey, I'm shot, you dumb wetback.  Holy shit.  You ever see a fucking head come apart like that?  Yeah, we worked him over with the butt of a shotgun. 
[01:07:00]  Made him hop around on one foot.  That's how the gook laughs.  Hey, go get that big, hairy, creepy crawler from the ammo dump  and put it on his gunshot wound.  The cops came through, went through some paperwork, said,  no, this is important.  This is important.  And then it blew up.  Y'all love little Charlie Reyes.  Charlie Reyes was a water walker. 
[01:07:30]  She's probably the one that did fucking Charlie Reyes.  Threw the whole mining camp for Charlie.  And Sal.  Evil.  And loving it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  See how they roll in like a motherfucker's cellular phone. 
[01:08:00]  That's how you know a motherfucker front.  Let me see your phone, motherfucker.  He roll in with a cellular.  The motherfucker ain't even on.  That's how you know he front.  Don't you hate when a motherfucker's front with shit?  At least have it on.  Then you can say, damn, motherfucker might have just made a phone call.  But brothers killed me front like a motherfucker walking in the club.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, then?  What?  Oh, y'all was there, eh?  Hold on.  Yeah, the little girl just coming by.  How you doing, this lady? 
[01:08:30]  No one that can't even pay the motherfucking bill.  Cellulars are good, though, because you can do some smooth shit.  Motherfuckers don't sit still when you got cellulars.  Do that.  Don't, because you feel the need to walk.  Because it's cordless.  That means there ain't nothing to hold in your ass there.  But you see motherfuckers rolling all in.  Yeah.  What up, man?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm just being here, right?  Living like a motherfucker on the cordless.  Yeah.  What?  Who was being here? 
[01:09:00]  They said that yesterday.  What?  Ain't nothing just walking through my house, you shit, you know?  Yeah, talking on the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Ah, yeah.  Okay.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, I'm back, man.  Yeah, nigga just had to go get some water and shit.  Man, I done wet your phone up.  But, uh... 
[01:09:30]  You sound like that shit just went in your mouth.  I wet the man's phone up, the sweat comes off.  Sister said, ugh.  This is a joke the airlines go through.  You know, every time you get on a plane, they'll tell you about the flotation seat, 
[01:10:00]  where it's located, how to use it, then tell you that's in case we go down in the ocean.  2% of all flights go over the ocean.  98% stay right here.  If you get on a plane in Tennessee, you come into Atlanta, they'll tell you about a seat  that's going to float.  I've got to be thinking, this must not be a direct flight.  If you want to make me happy, show me a seat that's going to bounce out of a cornfield.  And get this, there's a sign over the airplane door. 
[01:10:30]  Do not open during flight.  You know what that means?  Sometime in the past.  Some net.  As said to his wife, honey, I'll be back in a minute.  It's everything 24-7. 
[01:11:00]  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  Use Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:11:30]  Good morning to you.  We've got to go right to the phones.  Talking about the first time you jacked it, I guess.  Yeah, we were kind of talking about that, weren't we?  I don't know how we got, oh, we got on that subject because of the guy listening to the  Sacramento couple yesterday.  Right, right.  Okay, gotcha.  Let's say hi to Fred.  Hey, Fred, where are you calling from, man?  I'm calling from Augusta, Georgia right now.  Okay, you got a story for us?  Yes, sir.  I remember, I'm 50 years old, so give me that to a bit. 
[01:12:00]  I remember the days when we were with my mom, we had our Simpson-series catalog, and  that's where you're jerking off to.  So I remember the first time I met.  All right, slow down, slow down, slow down.  What?  Oh, what catalog?  A Simpson-series catalog.  I'm from Canada, so that's a Sears catalog, right?  A Sears catalog that you would jack it to.  Yeah, I used to jack it to the pictures of the girls in bras.  In the bras?  Yeah, that was porno back then when you were like, I don't know, 10.  It kind of was.  You'd have to look through the circulars and find...  Oh, yeah, you'd get that, or the before and after.  Bikini ads.  The before and after pictures in the back of some of those teen magazines... 
[01:12:30]  Really?  ...that my older sister had, where you put this cream on your...  Did you jack it to the fat chicks on the before?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's even better, actually.  I mean, that would be a funny story, too, but they used to have in the back of these magazines  a breast cream.  Oh, right.  Remember the breast cream?  Yes.  Where supposedly the teenage girls were supposed to put this cream on their boobs...  And their boobs would get bigger.  ...and they'd show the before and after picture, and then you would buy this product as a teenage 
[01:13:00]  girl, not knowing that it's actually puberty that's making them bigger, and not this stupid  cream.  All right, so the Sears catalog, you used to jack it to that?  Yeah.  But it gives you that type of idea.  I remember when I was 12 years old, I was in grade 8, and I wanted to get laid so bad  because I was jerking off, and I didn't want to know how I felt like.  So I finally found this girl in grade 8 who wanted to do it with me.  So she was like a wooden floor.  So that was great.  Of course she had a wooden floor. 
[01:13:30]  Nothing was happening down there yet.  That's right.  So I thought all I had to do was stick it between her legs, and I'd be having sex with her.  So we got on the floor in her bedroom, and then I stuck it between her legs.  I remember it was too dry.  And all I thought, well, I just had to stick it between her legs.  I told her to stick it between her legs tighter so I could get it in there.  And it wouldn't go in, so I had to go down and spit in it, right?  Oh, my God.  Only in Georgia.  Jesus.  No surprise here. 
[01:14:00]  Wait, were you having sex with her, or were you having sex with her legs?  No, I was having sex with her.  Oh, okay.  But the point was, I didn't know what I was doing.  I thought I just had to stick it between her legs, but not in her hole.  You see?  Yeah.  So all I did was I spit in the hole, and then it got nice and greasy then.  Then I got in there, and I fucked her.  All right, Jesus.  Then our parents came home.  And then I found out years later that it wasn't sex at all.  I had to scream it between her legs.  I didn't put it in the hole at all. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  You scare me.  That is frightening.  All right, there goes Fred.  You are frightening.  We could salvage that call, though.  There are things when you're a kid that you think is sex.  Misconceptions about sex that you do have.  That guy, I think he wasn't sure you were supposed to, as he said, put it in the...  You know, I'm not even going to say it.  I mean, come on.  Let's keep it a little clean on this show.  It sounded so nice and innocent the way he told the story, didn't it?  But I... 
[01:15:00]  Ah, fuck!  I think what he was trying to say back then, he thought having sex was just when you...  Oh, no.  He didn't know, but he ended up having sex with her legs.  Opie, I have no idea what that guy was talking about.  I'm really trying to save that phone call.  Somehow he had sex with the girl's legs and didn't actually do it.  But he thought he was doing it.  But I don't know if he knew what actually doing it was.  He wasn't very clear.  He was laughing too hard at his memories.  Right.  Well, I talked about this in the past.  I thought...  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  I thought you had to do it in the back door and that the other one...  The front one was just used for what...  You know.  And when did you figure it out the real way?  Last week?  Pretty much, yeah.  All the girlfriends were like, ow!  No, it was after the film, obviously.  Like, oh!  Oh, that's used for two things.  Well, you're not too clear on the female parts because you don't have them.  Right.  So you're not sure.  Right. 
[01:16:00]  You have the back, so you kind of know what that's about.  So you assume...  You know what?  I think we're going to just do a sex show today, I decided.  Is it completely a sex show?  Because you guys try to tell us what you want to hear on this program.  Now we're going to just do sex all day long.  Sexual discussion, and then we have sex on the couch.  Didn't you have something similar?  What you thought was sex when you were a lot younger?  Yeah.  I thought it was backdoor when I was a kid.  I guess I was about maybe seven, and I thought it was backdoor. 
[01:16:30]  And then when I learned that it was frontdoor...  All right.  So you thought it was backdoor as well?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'm not alone.  You're not sure of the anatomy.  So you don't even know that there's anything different up there in a girl.  Well, when you're really young, and you see the front one, it's intimidating and quite  scary.  Very intimidating indeed.  And when you and I were growing up, women weren't really taking care of that area.  No, no.  It was a big, jungly mess.  So you couldn't even imagine that was the way to go. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  You know?  You just couldn't imagine.  Oh, no.  It was very frightening.  It was very frightening.  Frightening.  I was brought into it.  Mom, turn the radio off, okay?  Don't listen.  Because it's embarrassing.  Yeah, because we need Anthony to not have to worry about his mom listening.  It's embarrassing talking about, you know, stories.  My mom, it's hilarious.  I was listening today.  I had to turn you guys off.  I'm like, do it.  Oh, that's what mine says, too.  That's fine.  She called last night.  She's like, yeah, I listen, you know, but there are times I just have to turn it off. 
[01:17:30]  It's like, oh, boy.  You know, whatever.  A 65-year-old woman is really the demo we're looking for.  So, no, turn it off.  That's what, you know, of course you're not going to like some of the stuff we're doing.  Especially when you consider it's me telling the stories.  What didn't she like yesterday?  The poker chips?  No, she actually didn't listen yesterday.  But there have been things that whenever we talk about things like this, she doesn't like to listen, which is good.  Don't listen.  But when I was a kid and I kind of got hooked up through my father in California, my father kind of hooked me up with this girl. 
[01:18:00]  He hooked you up with a lot of girls.  On my, I guess it was my 13th birthday or something like that.  Yeah.  Is this the Buzz story?  Yeah, Buzz.  Old Buzz.  She was a friend of the family.  She was 19 years old.  I guess she had banged everybody that we even knew.  Everybody in the town?  Yeah.  She was like the town whore.  Was she really?  The town whore.  You've never said that before. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, she banged everybody.  Was she just a local chick in the bar?  She was banging all my father's horse friends, you know, that would go riding with him and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, your dad was a cowboy after he left Long Island.  He was a cowboy.  He moved out to Southern California.  I'm going to California and I'm going to be a cowboy, baby.  Bought a bunch of horses.  I went out there, lived out there with him.  Bought me a horse.  I had the horse.  The whole deal, Opie.  I was a Western guy.  I wore cowboy boots and the cowboy hat.  I was a cowboy. 
[01:19:00]  It was pretty funny.  Had a six gun.  Sure.  A real one?  A real one.  Bought it for me for, also, I guess, my 12th birthday.  Got me that.  Got me a rifle.  How long did you live out there?  I thought you were just visiting.  I was 13, 14, 15, maybe three or four years.  Oh, you did three or four years out there.  Yeah, three or four years.  I thought you just used to visit.  My formative years.  Because I know your mom threw you and your brother on the bus one day.  No, that was actually coming home.  I moved out there because I wanted to move out there. 
[01:19:30]  I wanted to hang out with my father and ride horses.  It's a kid's dream to be a cowboy.  Boy, my brother got thrown out there by my mother because she didn't want to deal with  his pot smoking.  My brother's pot smoking, stealing and lying.  Stealing my mommy's quarters out of the quarter jar to buy joints and lying about it.  So, mommy threw him out.  So, he went first?  No, I went first.  Oh, okay.  And then he joined you?  And then he joined me out there.  Gotcha.  And he wasn't really into the whole cowboy thing.  So, he just smoked pot out there. 
[01:20:00]  I was pretty much doing the same thing, only out there.  But you got into the cowboy lifestyle.  Oh, I was totally into it.  I used to listen to the, like, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,  like stuff you'd hear on Hank's Place.  I love Hank's Place.  I would listen to that.  That was my music.  If you guys haven't checked out Hank's Place yet on XF Sile Radio, I forgot what channel  it is, but it's definitely worth checking out.  It's like either 10, 11, 12, or 13.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's way up there, but Hank's Place rocks.  It's scary that people think like this in the country.  Oh, it's amazing. 
[01:20:30]  It's Red State Station.  Anyway, go ahead.  I was one of them.  I love that music.  So, yeah, I was a cowboy.  And she was like the town whore, Buzz.  And one night, my father and his girlfriend at the time were going out and just kind of  left Buzz there and kind of were smiling, like winking or something when they left.  I didn't know what was happening.  And you were 13, 12?  Yeah, I guess I was 13.  Yeah.  Was this for your birthday? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  It was my birthday present.  And then Buzz goes, why don't you go upstairs and take a shower?  I'm like, oh, okay.  Not thinking anything about it.  Well, I was riding my horse today.  I'm a little sweaty.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  Okay.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  So I did, and I get out of the shower, and I'm ready to walk back downstairs and watch  TV with Buzz, and I hear from the bedroom, aren't you coming in?  And no, it didn't even hit me at that point. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I'm just thinking, hmm, now what's the voice coming from in the bedroom?  She was downstairs.  Now why would she be, oh, it finally hit you?  Oh, oh.  You're like, this is it.  Oh.  This is it.  Here it comes.  I'm going to put all that jack into good use.  Yeah.  So I heard, did you get an immediate boner?  Oh, yeah.  What are you kidding?  You get that whoosh feeling all over?  Well, that's the blood just rushing. 
[01:22:00]  Here it comes.  Here comes that sex stuff.  and then I kind of peer around the corner  and I look in the bed  and this vision is just etched in my head.  It's Buzz.  Is it still a really hot vision for you?  It's one of those nice little memories you have as a kid.  I remember seeing Buzz sitting in my bed  but she's sitting up with her head and torso  against the headboard. 
[01:22:30]  Was she hot? Be honest.  I've heard this story a couple times.  You know what it was?  She wasn't fat at all  but she was a big girl.  Like tall and not skinny  but not fat.  And she had huge cans.  How much bigger was she than you?  It must have looked ridiculous.  Oh, okay.  I've never heard this part of the story  because you're 12, 13.  I was 13.  13.  You couldn't have weighed more than what?  110? 120 pounds? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  I was a little more than that  but, you know,  it just must have looked ridiculous.  All right.  And she was sitting up in the bed  with the blanket like in her lap.  It just came up to her lap  so her huge cans were sitting there  all milky white.  They were huge?  Oh, they were huge.  They were huge.  With nice blue veins.  No.  They were just huge.  You see the blood just pumping.  Boom, boom, translucent.  Pumping to the nipple. 
[01:23:30]  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  She was sitting there.  Milky white.  And I looked in  and it was pretty much the first time  I ever saw them real live.  You know, I've seen a lot of porno.  Yeah.  I had seen a lot of porno at that point.  And they sat up nice?  Yeah, because she was 19, you know?  Oh, okay, okay.  She was 19.  She was the older woman to me.  I know.  When you tell the story,  I keep thinking like she was a 30-year-old woman.  No, no, no.  She was 19 and you were 13.  19.  All right, yeah.  And yeah, she goes,  well, why don't you come in?  I'm like, all right.  You know, I went in 
[01:24:00]  and the rest is my history.  You know, it just, it happened.  Oh, you want to stop the story right there?  Well, I knew what to do,  so there's no real details.  How long did you last?  It wasn't that long.  How long?  Be honest.  I don't know.  A couple pumps?  Honestly, I would tell you,  I really don't remember,  but I remember kind of getting into it.  The first time you do it,  it's, come on.  You know what, though?  You were drunk?  I had jacked it in the shower  that I had just taken.  I had. 
[01:24:30]  I had jacked it in the shower.  You were a jacking machine, man.  A monkey.  I was like a monkey.  I swear to you, a monkey.  So did you just do regular sex?  Yeah, but the point is  and how this got brought up  with the intimidation factor of the vag  when you first see it.  It's quite scary.  It's quite scary.  Before you see it.  And dude, this was...  And there's a lot of parts down there  and you're like,  wow, what does all that do?  Oh my God, I'm going to need a chart.  Give me a map.  You know, we had continued to have sex 
[01:25:00]  for months afterwards.  You know?  Like I was going to...  She would show up at the house  after my father and his girlfriend  would leave in the mornings  before school.  So I'm getting ready to go to school  and she would pop into my bed  and we'd have sex  and off I'd go to school.  Now what's messed up  if it was a 19-year-old guy  and a 13-year-old girl?  Yeah, I did get in trouble for that.  What?  Kidding.  Oh, okay.  You know, people wouldn't think  if that's cool.  Like a guy hearing that, 
[01:25:30]  you know, hearing you tell the story  that you're 13 banging a 19-year-old,  that is a really cool story.  Uh-huh.  Every guy dreamt that that could happen  to them when they were growing up.  I told people at school  and they didn't believe me.  They thought I was just another,  one of their friends lying to them.  Like, get out of here.  I'm like, no, really?  I just had sex.  Were you the first one to have sex?  You just want to have sex?  Yeah, yeah.  And you're a group of friends?  Oh, yeah.  Must have.  That's, like, really young.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  But the, now, one of these sexual encounters  before school, you know, 
[01:26:00]  she goes down on me.  And it was just, you know,  wee-hoo, boy.  This is goody-goody.  More fun than toys.  And then she goes,  would you like to do this to me?  Oh, no.  And, dude, I am talking.  She wasn't that old.  Crank this up, baby.  Oh, she wasn't that old.  19.  Still had teen in the name. 
[01:26:30]  Still a teen.  Not a nasty Mrs. Robinson.  Plastics.  I'm banging Dean Warmer's wife.  Those pointy tits in her bra.  This music's playing in your head.  Oh, no.  As he pulls down her huge panties.  Yeah, he pulled down her huge,  she did have big 70s panties.  Like, you know the ones that just are not cut at all  of the legs? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Just big bloomers?  Those were the ones.  Let me step out of my bloomers.  Yeah.  And it had to be a mess,  because this was, like, the 70s, right?  Kick the, uh, yeah.  Late 70s, maybe?  Kicks the bloomers over the lamp,  and the whole room goes dark.  Her big bloomers.  So she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Would you like to do this to me?  And the only vision I had  was the vision I saw of it  before I, you know, put it in.  So, uh, I remembered what it looked like very vividly. 
[01:27:30]  What it looked like?  Come on.  Dude, it was, it was as if you had punched Fidel Castro in the mouth,  and his lips swelled up.  And knocked out all his teeth.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  It looked like Albert Einstein with a head wound.  And it was awful.  Big.  And there was a couple shots of Novocaine in the lips.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he was going for dentistry.  That's right.  And, and the hair was spread out so far, 
[01:28:00]  like past the area.  She had like leg hair on that.  It was giant.  Thank God you just don't see that these days.  You just don't.  You know?  You don't.  Thank God.  Because it used to grow, I don't know, man.  Maybe we were brought up as cavemen in the, in some other era,  because it used to grow like halfway down the thigh.  Down the thigh?  Man.  Does it even grow like that anymore?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Girls are less hairy, more gooder now.  But know what the problem is?  All these styles come back.  That style will come back.  You think?  Before our time is done on this earth. 
[01:28:30]  I don't think so.  We are going to have to deal with that again.  I'm telling you.  I don't think so.  I'm telling you.  That's like the Hitler mustache.  Not down there, but the Hitler mustache on your face.  I never see that coming back again.  I'm telling you, man.  It's going to come back.  All right, so.  She sat on the edge of the bed one time, naked.  And when she was sitting and her lap, you know, her leg,  she was bent at the waist because she's sitting.  It looked like she was wearing black furry panties.  Her pubes were just so stretched out. 
[01:29:00]  I can't imagine girls were getting a lot of oral back then.  Yeah, I know.  I can't imagine because now today, you know,  most of the girls are completely shaved.  Well, just think of the hairy mess when they did.  Big Burt Reynolds mustache and pork chop sideburns going down on a chick  with a rug in her lap.  Just a big hairy mess all around.  Oh, cavemen.  Yeah, that went on for years.  So did you do it?  Until I left back to.  No.  I went.  How did you get out of it?  She goes, would you mind doing this to me? 
[01:29:30]  And I just went, I don't think so.  I did.  I said, I don't think so.  She knew I was a rookie.  So then what happened?  I'm not ready to go for the big league.  So what happened then?  You just continued having regular sex.  Yeah.  You know, she didn't cut me off from it.  That's great, man.  I guess she understood.  You're going to eighth grade getting banged every morning.  That's amazing.  You know, it was pretty odd.  It's amazing, man. 
[01:30:00]  And then girls my own age, I was like, you know, geez, this chick don't know shit.  She doesn't even have.  Can you help a brother out?  She doesn't even have boobs yet.  I'm like, hey, would you mind doing this to me?  And they go, I don't think so.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Wow, that's funny, man.  Yeah.  Oh, Hank's Place is Channel 13.  Good.  Channel 13.  Let me see if Ozzy could, that's a great story, by the way, Anthony.  More details.  It was greater to live, Opie. 
[01:30:30]  More details.  And then the next day, I got in the truck with my dad.  He was driving me to school.  And he kind of just looks over and goes, so, how was last night?  That's a cool dad, man.  For my 13th birthday, I got a 10-speed bike.  Wouldn't it be fun to know what you know now?  You got a hooker.  You basically got a hooker.  Well, it wasn't a money thing.  Did your dad bang her, too?  Probably.  Who knows?  Probably compare notes.  Yeah, dad.  Nice snatch.  It was, yeah, now it kind of threw me. 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  How was last night?  Oh, if you knew what you know now, like what I could have come back with, it's like, so,  how was last night?  And go, oh, dad, I don't like girls, you know.  You know, thanks for the effort and stuff, but I really don't like girls.  Yeah.  Man, that's...  Freak them out.  Yeah, that's unbelievable.  Yeah, I was like, wow, no, it was, you know, it was cool.  It was good.  You had the coolest dad in school.  Right.  Let me see if Ozzy could hold on through the break. 
[01:31:30]  Ozzy.  Hi, guys.  How are you guys?  Very good, Ozzy.  How are you doing?  We have a bunch of listeners very concerned about you and your relationship with your  wife.  Can you hold on for a few minutes?  Sure, man.  We'll go right to you, I promise, in like three or four minutes.  That's fine, you know.  All right.  I'm sorry we woke you up this morning.  I have nothing to do, man.  You know that.  Well, it's 4 a.m. in California.  It sounds a little groggy.  Hold on, Ozzy.  Oh, that's just the way it sounds.  Yeah, we got a very tired Ozzy on the phone.  Your brother wants in on the conversation about you and Buzz when you were a kid, Anthony. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, let's see.  Out there in California.  Let's see what Joe's going to add.  Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, of course.  Joey!  Joe!  No.  Hey, what's up, man?  You're on the air.  Yeah.  What the hell happened?  What's up?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Nothing, man.  I was just getting gas.  I'm on my way back from Atlantic City.  Oh, you're getting gas?  Okay. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, I'm coming back from Atlantic City.  I just saw Tom Jones.  Oh, how was that?  It was cool, man.  Did he do dry vagina?  A bunch of goddamn old...  No, a bunch of old ladies, though.  It was hysterical, man.  They're like throwing these big old bloomers up at us.  Do they still throw their underwear at that guy?  No, it's hysterical, man.  Oh, I love...  Joe, you have a great life now, man.  You don't have to get up early to do that.  Oh, Joe just cruises around the world.  He's just doing his band thing and going to see Tom Jones concerts. 
[01:33:00]  Going to see Tom Jones because he can now.  How does Tom Jones sound, Joe?  Things are good.  You guys have made it that way for me.  Thank you very much.  What's Tom Jones sound like?  Any good?  Dry dry...  Was that a Tom Jones song originally?  Yeah.  The guy sounded incredible.  Yeah, he was really good, man.  Still has his pipes.  Great show.  He hasn't lost a thing.  Wow, very cool.  He hasn't lost a thing.  I gotta go check him out.  It's pretty fun.  Well, anyway, I'm calling to talk about bars for a second.  Anthony tends to whitewash things just a little bit.  What did I whitewash? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, my God.  She didn't sound like a beauty.  Nothing about...  No, no, no.  Everything is good as far as your detail goes, except for one thing.  Does look like a Cro-Magnon.  She had...  All right.  She had the distended brow.  She had the unibrow.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's a detail that you forgot to tell us, Anthony.  I wasn't looking at her face.  I was horrified at the vag.  What was hairier?  Her vag or her head?  It looked the same.  Her face was the same.  She had a univag and a unibrow.  Wow.  You were talking about the hair thing. 
[01:34:00]  I mean, that was directly due to the fact that she was like a Neanderthal.  Hey, at least I wasn't 15 banging that 30-year-old mother with a friggin' axe crotch.  Wait a second, dude.  She was 32.  Wait.  Are we going to get a new story today?  Oh, there was one time I was with Buzz in one of these bedrooms in this house.  Joe's the older brother.  Go ahead.  And Joe was slamming this 32-year-old mom.  While you were banging Buzz?  Yeah, in the same room.  And Joe goes, hey, at midnight, let's switch. 
[01:34:30]  And I said, I go, there is no way I'm banging that old broad.  All right.  Hold on.  She walked like she'd been riding a horse for about 18 years.  That girl, what was her name?  Do you remember?  Sue.  Sue.  Sue.  Sue.  This girl, Sue, woman, Sue, her legs were so spread apart and she had the gap, like where  her vag was supposed to be, was a gap like a hatchet wound.  Was that from riding horses?  I don't know what it was from. 
[01:35:00]  Or doing horses.  Maybe getting slammed by everything that walked.  But, dude, she had to accommodate me, so it worked out.  Wait a minute.  Oh, sure.  Hold on.  Let's slow down, guys.  Slow down.  So, I got to get the visual here.  Yeah.  You're 13, Anthony.  You're banging Buzz.  Yeah.  While Dad's out doing his thing.  Uh-huh.  And Joe's in the bed.  I think I was probably 14 at this time.  All right.  And Joe's in the bed next to you, banging a 32-year-old?  No, a different room.  Oh, no, no.  He was in a different room.  It was a...  Oh, all right.  It was a hallway and then two rooms at the end of each hallway.  Did you hear each other going at it? 
[01:35:30]  I don't think so.  There was Peter Frampton was playing.  They always used to put the Frampton Comes Alive album on.  Come on.  I swear.  Sue would always put the Frampton Comes Alive album on Blasting.  And all we heard was, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Don't you feel like we do?  That wasn't Frampton.  That was actually you going down on Buzz.  You know what?  The old man hooked me up with her as well.  I mean, the old man did a lot of brush that way.  Oh, there it is.  There's some Frampton. 
[01:36:00]  Is this bringing back memories, boys?  We're bringing back such memories.  Jesus.  Yeah, I think the old man was banging Sue also.  Probably.  Yeah.  So, Joe was a little older.  So, you were only 15 or 16 banging the 32-year-old?  Yeah, I was about 16, I guess.  Yeah, and he was banging the 32-year-old and wanted to switch at midnight.  What, you guys had a little conference in the hallway?  Yeah, yeah.  In between bangings?  We saw Sue breaking out the Frampton album.  We knew we were getting laid.  Real tag team. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, so Joe wanted to do the switch, and man, I had, believe it or not, Buzz with the  unibrow, the big 70s Earth Mama Muff, the big Amazon woman was bad enough.  But this is telling how bad Sue was.  I wanted no part of her.  There was nothing about Sue that was turning me on.  She was much too old.  She was thin, though.  She was thin.  She was small.  She was emaciated.  She had flapjack tits.  She had two kids who were in the other room. 
[01:37:00]  She had two kids in the other room.  Wait, wait, wait.  In the other room?  Yeah, there was another room that the kids were in.  This was a flop house.  I swear to God, man, I would have gone through five Sue's before I would have taken one Buzz.  You wanted Buzz.  You were the one that recommended the switch, that suggested the switch at midnight.  That was because I was 15, and I figured, what the fuck?  We were just throwing around.  It would be fun, something to do.  Switch it up a little bit.  Horrifying.  What were the kids doing while you were banging their mother? 
[01:37:30]  They were probably playing with Legos.  Who the hell knows?  Who the hell knows?  Did they call you Daddy, Joe?  I remember the girl walking in one time on me.  Oh, great.  The little girl walking in on us one time.  She was like seven.  I know, and she was only about maybe six years younger than me, right?  Did we find any of these people?  Who knows?  I don't know what the hell is going on in California.  Sue's probably got the eights.  Which hippie colony should we check?  You guys were a bunch of hippies out there.  Yeah, hippies. 
[01:38:00]  She was growing bras with Tom Jones last night.  Who knows?  Probably.  She's old.  Old broad.  Joe, you had a great father, man.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  He liked to party, that's for sure.  He gave you guys poo-ha, man.  I remember, yeah.  Guns, alcohol, and the bitches.  He hooked us up.  No, my dad gave me a good jump shot.  There you go.  That's what I got from my dad, a good jump shot.  I used to come, and really good ball handling skills, and you guys are getting poo-ha, man. 
[01:38:30]  I used to come home from school.  I went to Marco Forster Junior High School, and it was right by the stable where we kept the horses.  So I would get done with school about three o'clock, walk back to the stable, and every day,  my father, who for some reason couldn't hold a job, was sitting in a chair with Chato,  the Mexican guy that had a horse at the same ranch, and they would just sit there drinking  what they called Yombos.  They were the big 40-ounce beers.  Why don't we get another Yombo, Yoey? 
[01:39:00]  And then they'd sit there just drinking beer.  And when their wives or girlfriends would bitch at them, they would look at each other  and go, eh, I'm going to get me another one.  And this was their life, riding horses, drinking, and screwing girls like Buzz and Sue.  Yeah.  So he was getting us right in line to do that, drinking beer, riding horses, and screwing  women.  Making homebrew.  And making the homebrew.  They used to get these casks from these whiskey factories, big wooden barrels, and they would 
[01:39:30]  take them back to the ranch, fill them up with, like, five gallons of water, and then  roll it.  Every couple of days, you'd roll it, like a quarter roll.  And then after a month, you'd drain it out, and you'd get one gallon of liquid that would  come out.  But it was like pure alcohol that would leach out of the wood from the casks.  And we're kids, and they're giving us shots of this stuff.  We were fucked up.  I mean, completely hammered.  What a great way to be raised. 
[01:40:00]  Dude, you drank a glass.  You had it on the rocks.  Yep.  And stood up from around.  That's how I drank at 13.  On the rocks.  On the rocks.  Go ahead, Joe.  Joey.  Yo.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, and then you proceeded to go straight down to your knees.  Oh, yeah.  Took a big shot and just went thud.  Passed out.  It was great.  Why straight down to your knees?  Buzz was standing in front of Anthony there?  No, I wouldn't have gotten on my knees for Buzz, that's for sure.  Looked like tumbleweed rolled in our lap. 
[01:40:30]  All right, you know what?  To wrap this up, you guys got to tell the story of Mom finally calling out to California  and going, boys, it's time to come home.  I think she was a little concerned for your safety.  Oh, that was when we had decided it was time to come back east and maybe get civilized for a little while.  I was just coming back to visit.  Joe, of course, was coming back to live there.  But after I visited with my family here in New York for a while, I realized I was kind of programmed in California.  And they kind of deprogrammed me here in New York, and I decided I better stay because I really was heading on the road to ruin out there. 
[01:41:00]  But it's funny how you guys got back home.  You had to take the bus trip, right?  Well, my mother had sent out two airline tickets for me and my brother to fly us from California to New York.  So my father got the tickets, went to the airline, sold the tickets, took the money, and bought us two Greyhound bus tickets and put us on the bus.  And there we were on this two-week-long excursion. 
[01:41:30]  But he can't be pissed at him because he gave you puha, man.  I know, with hookers and pimps.  Yeah, so we were taking a bus all the way from California, L.A., to New York City.  And it stopped at every city.  You know, we stopped everywhere.  And the collection of dregs of society, male hookers, hustlers, girl hookers, pimps.  And I'm talking like huggy bear pimps.  These guys with the fur hats and everything. 
[01:42:00]  It was just a collection.  An ouzo bum who had a bottle of ouzo with him the whole trip that everybody, when he passed out, would take and pass around the bottle.  And we were drinking this bum's ouzo.  This hot chick we met that was getting off in Cheyenne but decided to hang out with us all the way into New York.  Who knows what happened to her?  Probably murdered or ended up a hooker.  And then we finally get to New York after two weeks on the road.  And right when we step off the bus, we get arrested by NYPD.  This detective comes over. 
[01:42:30]  He came up to me and grabbed me by the shoulder and said,  Excuse me, boys.  You have to come with me.  Right?  And now you left out the fact that I was smuggling in tie sticks.  Right.  Now the cop goes, Come with me.  Get your bags.  And we're like, Oh, my God.  Joe's got like pounds of tie sticks.  How old were you, Joe?  Oh, God.  Probably 17 now.  I think you were 17.  I think you were 17.  16, 17.  And he's just like a load of tie stick in his bag. 
[01:43:00]  And the guy goes, We're going to get your bags.  And we're going to check you out.  You know, because they thought we were runaways.  They thought we were runaways coming into New York to, you know, hustle or something.  So thank God that girl did follow us from Cheyenne and just hang out with us on the bus.  We told her, Could you get this one bag and get it immediately before we get there?  And she ran and got the bag and actually didn't steal it and took it.  And then the cop goes to call my mom up.  And I'm like, Could you just identify yourself and first say, Your kids are fine. 
[01:43:30]  And I'm NYPD.  And I've just took them.  And I want to verify that they're not runaways.  He gets on the phone.  Hello, Rosemary.  Yes.  Do you have two sons, Joseph and Anthony?  Yeah.  And you just, my mother's horrified.  This guy just strung it along without, like, telling her we were okay.  Guy was a real prick.  But I got off the hook.  Remember the knives that the old man gave us?  Yeah.  He, like, confiscated our knives.  By his side. 
[01:44:00]  And the cop was patting me down.  You know, he goes, Oh, what's this?  What's this?  Put his hand over by his gun, takes the knife away from me.  Yeah, what a collar.  Yeah.  What a collar.  Getting the Kumia boys.  Goddamn hysterical.  Well, thank you for the memories, Joe.  I forgot about Sue.  All right.  More stories than that, though.  For another day, all that Mojave Desert.  Oh, I know.  Shootings and everything.  Yeah, we'll talk about the shooting next time you call in, right?  I saw more shootings than Puffy.  Yeah.  On an entire show, too.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great story. 
[01:44:30]  But you're going to have to tell it live in the studio, though.  But, Joe, bashing Buzz when you're banging a Sue is a little much.  Come on.  She was this mousy woman with these big glasses.  Remember Sue's big dopey.  She looked like Tweety Bird.  You know, these big glasses.  Hi, Joe.  I got my glasses, and I'm going to bang you to Peter Frampton.  Ow, my ass hurts from last night.  Oh, that's funny.  Don't bang my Cro-Magnon, woman. 
[01:45:00]  I don't know, man.  Who'd you rather fuck, Tweety Bird or Mike Tyson?  I was screwing Sasquatch.  No shit.  That's great.  All right, Brother Joe.  Chubby gals need love, too.  That's quite possibly the filthiest vagina I have ever seen.  The only in the studio.  We know you've been talking about getting another XM radio.  Why not try out the XM Delphi Roadie 2?

What's the biggest difference sexually?  It's the energy levels right after sex.  Girls get all energetic.  My girlfriend wants to cook stuff.  She's got a cake in the oven.  She's roasting a pig on a spit that she killed with her own bare hands. 
[01:46:00]  You know, she's painting the house, raking leaves.  Meanwhile, I'm at the hospital.  My blood pressure is three over one.  I'm on life support systems.  The doctor's like, he came three times?  That means irreversible brain damage.  Guys have no energy after sex, do they?  I'm surprised rapists don't get caught every time.  So, officer, how'd you apprehend the suspect? 
[01:46:30]  Well, he chased him 50 feet and he passed out.  Where's the woman?  She's in the woods doing jumping jacks.  After I have sex, my legs are like a newborn calf.  You know, I'm in the kitchen in my underwear trying to make a sandwich.  Look out the window.  She's putting in a built-in pool.  Yeah, it's 80 feet deep enough, honey.  What did I shoot into you?  Cracks?  Sit down for crying out.  We'll have sex tomorrow night and clean the garage. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, after a good blowjob, I need a walker.  Only one thing got me out of college.  High school.  And high school was tough.  And grammar school, I couldn't spell at all.  I used to miss words like posse.  And the talent. 
[01:47:30]  I always left the U out.  I think you gave me a hundred dollars.  It could have been worse.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.

[01:48:00]  The holiday skiing is probably at its best point right now,  with some comfortable temperatures on the eastern mountains,  like at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire,  ready with over three dozen runs and some tubing terrain as well.  At Killington-Pico, they combine for over 50 miles,  including the Bear Mountain Open at Killington.  Okemo Mountain on five mountains and over 80 runs.  Seven Springs into Pennsylvania with over 30 trails open.  They stay at full operation.  Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia, continues down 56 runs.  The half pipe opens up on Saturday at Snowshoe.  Out west, where Breckenridge continues down 120 runs. 
[01:48:30]  Jackson Hole has some fresh snow for 65 trails.  Park City with over a half a foot with over 90 runs.  Deer Valley, Utah, heads down the fresh snow for 80-plus trails.  Mount Hood Meadows with some fresh snow as well.  Over half of their runs now open.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.

Damn good smoothie. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, fantastic.  Damn good smoothie.  Banana orange.  What did you get, Opie?  What?  Did you get a smoothie?  Just a banana.  When I send them back for another one, I'll be glad to treat you to a smoothie. 
[01:50:00]  They're really good.  All right.  The O-A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Can I ask a question?  Yes.  This has been bugging me for two weeks.  Every time I go into the bathroom, the goddamn window is open.  Who is opening the window?  Is it New York?  You know, it is freezing.  It's 35 degrees out.  How bad are some of these log fumes?  Leave the fucking window closed.  You know, you're right.  That bathroom is freezing cold because the window's open.  Some germaphobe is like, oh, I've got to open the window to get the dirty germs out. 
[01:50:30]  Why?  You want a bathroom all hot.  Yeah, and steamy.  You know, you want to smell it, the fella next to your head for lunch.  Nothing better than leaning your head under the floor going, hey, pastrami?  And he laughs and he gives you the old knuckle to the chin.  But I went in there and I closed it earlier this morning.  So somebody went in and opened it.  I would like somebody to fess up.  Reopened it.  Ben?  No?  He doesn't know?  I thought he was coming in with an answer.  Nice.  You know, who is opening that bathroom window?  It might be Ben because that gust of wind maybe hits him when he opens the window. 
[01:51:00]  No, he actually opened it because it smells like shit in there.  No, it doesn't.  You're the one that opens it every morning?  I'm not the only one that does it.  Oh, so Ben is...  Exactly.  Who else does it?  It's 30 degrees out.  I'm trying to shit.  It's not 30 degrees out.  My bag is gripping me like a little hornet's nest.  Good.  First of all, you destroy that place.  Somebody go in there.  You really teach that bathroom a lesson.  Well, you're not supposed to go in there and eat egg salad.  You walk in, you take your dump of your leg, and you leave. 
[01:51:30]  It's not supposed to smell good in there.  It's a men's room.  I miss Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS.  Yeah, we do miss him.  That guy that used to clean the bathroom in any W.  That guy would put a...  He would have welded that window shut so no one could open it.  You know what used to suck about that guy?  He would always be there when you had to take the dump.  We used to get these limited times where we could actually squeeze out a dump.  Limited times?  We were playing 18 minutes of commercials an hour.  Yeah, but there was always something going on where it was hard to run all the way down 
[01:52:00]  the hall to get to that bathroom and take the dump.  And you didn't know if Norton was banging some chick over the toilet, which he'd been known  to do exactly.  How many times did you bang chicks in that bathroom?  Not many.  One or twice.  The answer should be, like, never, because it's a work environment, but Norton's answer  is not many.  Now, one time I whacked my bag with some chick in the stinky stairwell.  A couple times I hooked up in there.  I got blown in there once.  That was a great, great...  M.E.W.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  Lots of nooks and crannies.  Oh, places to leave loads all over.  Now, the thing is... 
[01:52:30]  There's nowhere.  It's all well lit.  The bathroom there that we used to use for dumps wasn't just an N.E.W. bathroom.  It was for that floor.  So other people from other offices would go into that bathroom.  We kind of had, like, a private bathroom, hoo, hoo, hoo, outside the studio, but we made  it the...  We made it no crunch zone.  The crunch-free zone.  Because it stunk the entire green room up.  Green room up.  Right.  You could take a dump in there, and then the door would open up, and it would stink the entire  floor up.  So we said no crunching for urination only. 
[01:53:00]  And then the other bathroom, you'd run down there, and there was Richard Dreyfuss with  AIDS cleaning up with his big yellow gloves on.  The door propped open with his cart, and you're like, it just wrecked.  I can't now take a dump.  I'd be making some noise.  Oh, man.  And when one of those logs got stuck, he would just put that yellow glove on and go to town  and make sure it went down that bowl.  He'd choke it.  He would choke it and break it apart so it went down with his bare hand.  If you had trouble taking a dump, he'd actually pick you up and bear hug you from the front  and help squeeze it out like your toothpaste, that faggot. 
[01:53:30]  I remember one time I was on a bowl, and I'm dropping what was awful, some type of miscarriage  in the toilet.  And I see his foot come under my stall and pull a piece of paper out that was thinking  half-up.  That guy has the worst job, and he loved his job.  He really did.  He took his job very seriously.  I don't know what his name was, but I hope he died in the two years that we were off.  Tragically.  We kind of liked that guy.  I hope he was at his kid's wedding and he had a stroke while cleaning a bathroom.  We liked that guy.  We didn't like him. 
[01:54:00]  I didn't like him.  He didn't do anything to you.  I didn't like him.  He ruined about 40 dumps.  He should die in a tuxedo, scooping a toilet out.  Dude, the guy was making $15,000 a year to squish logs so they could go down a bowl.  I bet you he wasn't making anything.  He probably showed up voluntarily to do it.  And you wished death on the guy?  Yeah.  He did ruin a lot of dumps.  All I ask is when I'm alone in the bathroom.  Do you know when you're walking...  No, you don't ask for being alone in the bathroom.  As soon as one of us wants to go to the bathroom, you follow right behind us.  To take a whiz is fine, but I got to take a dump.  Right.  I want nothing.  There were times where I'd be walking down the hallway with the... 
[01:54:30]  When you got the pain where the back of your thighs hurt, like, and there's only one thing  going to fix it.  You know?  Getting in there and releasing.  Yep.  And your body knows that you're approaching the bathroom and starts winding up.  And you're around that corner, and there's Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS, with his cart.  And there's gloves.  And you're just...  God, I'm already in the mode.  I've started the...  The wheels are in motion. 
[01:55:00]  That gas pain where you're unbuttoning your belt, undoing your belt, and you're afraid  that if you sit, you're going to shit on the way down.  You ever have to...  I've actually had to stand over the toilet, like, and not bend until that one gas pain.  Right.  Because if I try to bend, I'm going to shit down the back of my leg.  It's all over.  Those are the best.  And you hold it until you get the chapter you want, and then you just start reading  release.  Why is it you have to get to a page and start reading?  I don't know.  I'm thumbing right through this particular chess problem.  God damn ads.  I like to read chess books on the toilet. 
[01:55:30]  I'll actually hold it until I get to the right Kasparov game.  I'm a weirdo.  Yeah.  I have a pile of popular mechanics.  I read popular mechanics.  Hey, what's new?  I'm not in...  Let's see what's coming out.  Hey, look at what was out a hundred years ago today.  I'm not in long enough to read anything.  I'm not in there long enough to read anything.  You're not.  I'm trying to figure out a way to get a magnetic chess board so I can bring it in the bathroom  so I can work out chess moves on the toilet.  Chess moves.  I swear to God, that's all I want to do.  Play chess on the toilet. 
[01:56:00]  How are you not in there long enough to read?  Yeah, what are you?  Just poop and leave?  Yeah, just real quick.  I don't know.  There are times that you'll just be relaxing.  You're done with your business, but I'm not done reading.  No.  And then you get the big butthickey ring, and you wind up walking out.  You look like a newborn fawn.  No, I'm going out on your asleep legs.  I'm back to being regular.  Yeah, but you could be regular and still hang out for a quick read.  Get up in four, three quick dumps within 15 minutes, done for the day.  Do you really?  Yep, done for the day. 
[01:56:30]  Jesus, back to normal.  Cancer patient bowels, three dumps as soon as you get up?  Three dumps.  One after another.  Get out of that head!  It's the weirdest thing.  I want that head so clean that Opie himself will be proud to dig a dump in it.  Three times before he goes to work.  I once had one stuck.  So you know all this oatmeal and crap?  Right.  I was on the train, and I was in there for a long time, and it was still attached.  And you know the bowls and the trains and stuff?  There's a lot of room before it hits water. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  So it's just kind of hanging there.  Oh, God.  A bungee log.  But the best part, I knew there was a lot more in me attached to this particular log.  And I'm sitting there, and I'm waiting, and I'm waiting.  I'm like, what the F I'm going to do?  So I start doing the dump exercises, like I stand up, and I start, like, jumping, just  trying to release the thing from my body.  I swear to God, I really thought I would have to go in there with whatever, it probably would  have had to be my fingers or something.  I don't know.  It turns sideways halfway out sometimes, and it just jams, and it's awful. 
[01:57:30]  It turns sideways.  When you go to wipe it, if you have to, like, finish it, it's like, this is not going to  happen.  You go through 50 pieces of paper, and it's still a problem.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I have to stay in there until it's all out.  Do you?  Yeah.  That's why you got to hang out for a while.  But I was, like, pushing my stomach.  I was jumping up and down a little bit, and this damn thing was still attached.  I can't stand how gross these conversations get, but I guess everyone goes through it.  Now, when you're not done, and you know, like, the final chapter hasn't happened, the final 
[01:58:00]  drop hasn't been done.  It's hanging, and I know I got at least another four to five inches.  What about the surprise, though?  You think it came off.  You're sitting there reading, and after a while, it's like, well, you feel that, and  then, whoop, I didn't even know that was there.  Or you stand up, and it's gotten a little cooler because your body temperature isn't with  it, and you feel it brushing into the back of your cheek, and you're like, ah!  Come on!  You know what I'm talking about?  There's that little piece that's still stuck.  Do you wipe?  No, no.  When you stand up, I stand up to wipe. 
[01:58:30]  I don't sit and wipe.  I'm not a girl.  I stand up.  I put one foot on the bowl, and one foot...  Wait.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Always.  I never sit.  Don't look at me like I'm weird when everyone's laughing at you for your wiping habit.  Dude, I stand up when I wipe.  Why do we have to have the demonstration?  I just see the way I'm talking.  That's really how you wipe?  You stand up.  I put one foot on the bowl seat, and the other foot's on the floor, and I actually  lean forward and arch my ass out.  It is very bizarre, and I wipe this way I can get in there. 
[01:59:00]  I want it clean.  Oh, man!  You guys sit on a toilet and wipe?  Oh, my God.  You don't sit.  It's a bend-over thing, so you're almost...  Your head is, like, between your knees, but you're still sitting.  Never!  And then you reach back, and you take care of business.  No.  There's no standing.  Dude, it was embarrassing.  That defeats the purpose.  You're messing stuff up by standing up.  When I was in Iraq, one of the problems we had, we had to use these bathrooms the soldiers  used, and they're, like, these little portable tents that have these, like, you know, tent 
[01:59:30]  stalls next to each other.  Yeah.  And when you sit, your feet go straight out, and there's a leather curtain.  So I would...  I think they just don't want you on the toilet all day, so they make it slightly uncomfortable.  So I would do that to wipe my ass, but my head would poke out of the curtain, so people  walking into the bathroom would just see me half-leaning out of the curtain.  It was the only way I could wipe my crack.  Oh, these are so sick.  Yes, Ben?  I got a rainbow.  My old apartment, when I first moved to New York, I had this little apartment.  I was dating this girl, and I'd come home, and I'd taken a dump, and it didn't... 
[02:00:00]  It got all clogged up, and I didn't have a plunger.  So imagine what it was like.  I had to go down to the doorman downstairs and come back up.  That was one of the...  That was a pretty bad one.  That's brutal.  Nothing worse than the overflowing toilet at someone else's house.  You ever have a log overflow over the top of the pole?  I learned this at a very young age.  When I see the water coming up in the toilet, you get that panic.  You panic. 
[02:00:30]  But right away, I lunge under the toilet, and it's a race against time.  Will the water reach the top and overflow, or will I shut that valve off quick enough?  Where under the toilet is that?  Under every toilet, on the side or under the toilet, is the little tin valve that you must  turn quickly.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And it shuts off, and right when the water reaches the top, oh, but then you've got to  get rid of it.  Plunger.  What if there's no plunger?  Fishnet.  I have learned to use anything.  A little guppy fishnet.  Anything in the garbage pail. 
[02:01:00]  Sometimes, I've used shampoo bottles at people's houses, where if the water goes down low enough,  you wait long enough, it'll slowly go down, but it won't be unplugged.  You take a shampoo bottle, shove it in there, and then pull it out real quick.  It'll do it.  Rolled-up newspaper.  If people read a lot, or a magazine, you'll roll it up, roll it up, shove it down the  hole, and then give it a few pumps.  And then you'll hear that, ah, the crap's down. 
[02:01:30]  I'm off the hook.  Because you don't want to, you know.  Oh, you don't want logs in your little bath mat, little pieces of fetid dump.  You'll never get that stuff out.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, you know, Bill brings up a good point here.  Bill from Colorado.  Go ahead.  Hey, man.  I was listening to Jimmy talk about the position he's in when your wife's his ass.  When I was a kid once, I think I walked in on my sister.  I think that's the same position girls get in when they put a tampon in, isn't it?  You know, that's what's on the box.  You're probably right. 
[02:02:00]  That's the instruction on the box.  It shows a girl how to stand, that it's one foot on the toilet, one foot on the floor,  and then the insertion.  For me, it's just to get my crack nice and clean.  That's why I do it.  I don't have a very hairy crack, but I like it clean.  I'm a weirdo, but I like hygiene.  Oh, you could like it clean, but you don't have to use that position.  Dude, I dig my finger away in.  I look at every piece of paper.  I do.  It's not gross.  I'm clean.  Rick, what's going on?  I think you guys could eat my ass right now.  It's fantastic.  You actually penetrate.  Oh, yeah, always.  Do you use the little wipes that they have out now?  I actually bought them recently, and what I'll do... 
[02:02:30]  Aren't they a treat?  Not every time, but I usually shower after.  If I'm going out, I'll shower.  But I'll take a toilet paper, I'll wipe it, I'll use the wipes and get it, like put the  finger, wrap the finger in the wipe and then push it up, pull it out.  I want the whole channel clean, dude.  I don't just want the outside.  You guys want the outside.  That's why you get skid marks.  I never get skid marks, ever.  I don't get skid marks.  You guys have told some...  Years ago, that's because I had the flu.  Years ago, it looked like a used shoeshine rag because I had the flu.  I have the flu sometimes.  As long as you have a nice, airtight seal, there's no need to clear beyond the doorway. 
[02:03:00]  No.  To clean it up, you know?  Sorry, guys.  You don't have to penetrate the seal.  Always.  If a chick's giving you a Hummer and she licks your bag, it's going to reek.  You ever go down on a girl and smell that?  I've had that happen where you're going down on her and she parts her legs and let that  smell of old capicol comes up and you're like...  Let's go to Kurt in Jersey.  What's up, Kurt?  Okay, okay.  I give up.  Go back to gay. 
[02:03:30]  We're doing pretty well getting the gay out so far.  That's funny.  We had that hot chick from Oregon this morning.  She was all right.  Actually, Rick is calling from Oregon as well.  Rick, what's up?  All right, enough of this stuff.  It's like I'm driving a big truck down the road.  There's nowhere to pull off the road and now I've got to take a dump.  Now you've got to go.  All right.  That little gurgling.  Is there anything worse than that gurgling when you can't do anything about it?  Perculating.  You're percolating. 
[02:04:00]  You're percolating.  I had one before I got on a flight to Atlanta a few months ago.  I don't know what was wrong.  I wasn't sick, but I must have taken eight shits in the airport.  That's the worst place to take a dump.  Everybody's having laptops.  Hold on.  We've got to go to the phones real fast before we lose John.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, you're going to bring up something that we talk about all the time on the show, but  go ahead.  Well, the way Jimmy wipes.  He likes to keep himself nice and clean by wiping that way? 
[02:04:30]  Yes.  Well, the next guy who uses a toilet has to sit down where he just put his foot.  The foot that walked across the bathroom floor through all the pee drip and all the pee  tears and grit.  Yeah, you raise a good point, but most of my dumps, 80% of them are done at home or in  hotels.  But even so, I'm Willie Wipe when it comes to the seat, so you've got to wipe the seat  off.  That's the next guy's responsibility.  Yeah, okay.  I thought he was going to talk about something else.  Everybody will think about that the next time they go. 
[02:05:00]  You keep yourself perfectly clean, but then you have no problem diving into some whore's  ass.  I didn't say there are no inconsistencies.  Yes, there are inconsistencies.  Whenever I wipe my chest, I put my foot up.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Al the Cop from East Northwood has a little story.  At some chick's party back in high school, my bud had a crap that wouldn't fit down the  bowl because of its length.  So, we took a comb out of the comb and brush holder on the girl's sink, sawed the log in  half, rinsed the comb and put it back. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, that's great.  Nice.  Despicable.  Someone's wondering why they have a peanut in their hair.  That's good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.

[02:08:00]  You hear that sound?  He shoots.  This is the hook.  It's time to take off the warm-ups.  College basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  We have ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-10.  Round ball, baby.  It'll be a full slate on channels 180 through 188.  Huge rivalries.  ACC, North Carolina, and Duke.  Yeah, hills.  Yeah, hills.  Blue doubles.  Blue doubles.  Arizona, UCLA.  Go Cats.  Go Cats.  Yeah, Bruins.  Yeah, Bruins.  Indiana and Purdue.  Hoosiers. 
[02:08:30]  Hoosiers.  Boilermakers.  Boilermakers.  Boilermakers.  Oh, yeah.  And we have much more.  All season long, we're taking it hard to the hoop.  The defensive pressure continues.  That was a...  With college basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the ACC, Big Ten, and the Pac-10.  College basketball on channels 180 through 188 on XM Satellite Radio.  No one will outscore us.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  202.  XM News, talk, sports, and information. 
[02:09:00]  It's everything.  All the time.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, Jim.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  You didn't wake up like Ben today.  Ben isn't in today.  Why isn't Ben in?  He called me.  I got up at like...  I was up at like 3.30 this morning, and the phone's ringing.  It's Ben saying that he's just shitting like he's never shit before.  And he says, I would rather deal with this at home than at work.  I'm like, yeah, whatever, dude, because we don't want to deal with it. 
[02:09:30]  Is he flinging his windows open in his bathroom with that frigid cold in there?  He's sweating more than usual.  His head's sweating.  He's on the toilet.  His legs are shaking.  Stupid glasses are askew.  Poor Ben.  Awful Boston dumps.  His big hog is resting in the toilet water.  Lazily hanging in there.  He takes a nice chowder shit.  The bottom of his balls are just brushing up against the water.  I don't know why, and I'll admit it, but Jim and I are obsessed with Ben's hog. 
[02:10:00]  We're trying to figure out what the hell's going on in the front of his pants.  We've said this many times, but for the new listeners, we don't know if he has just really  big balls or he's got just an enormous hog.  It really is.  You can't not look at it when he bobbles in the studio with his messy hair.  He's a very hairy guy, perhaps.  It's just a lot of hair.  In a disarray, like on his head. 
[02:10:30]  Ben's a mess.  Now he's crapping.  What's the update with Ben?  He still won't come on the phone?  God, he's going to be in bad shape today.  Anyway, he won't come to the phone?  He'll talk to Steve, but he won't come on the air.  Ben is very, very sick.  I just got done talking to him.  I explained to him that you'd like to get him on the air, but he said, I can't.  I can't even get out of bed.  He said, it's bad sushi, he thinks.  Oh, really?  Never good.  Yeah, he had some sushi last night.  He can't move.  Bad sushi?  Yeah, he's running to the bathroom every 10 minutes. 
[02:11:00]  And Ben never gets sick, to be honest with you.  Ben never gets sick.  So if he's out, it's bad.  Is he puking or dumping?  I think it's both.  Ugh.  All right.  That's why I'm always paranoid about sushi, but everybody thinks I'm nuts.  Yeah, same.  I know everybody, everyone I know has had bad sushi at one time or another.  I eat sushi all the time.  I got sick once, and it was because I went to one of these stupid lunch places that advertise  half-priced sushi.  Oh, dude.  It was years ago. 
[02:11:30]  I learned my lesson.  Yeah.  And I brought the sushi home, and it tasted bad right away, so I stopped eating it.  So I didn't get that sick.  Yeah.  Not like a Ben.  And then I decided to try to feed it to my cats at the time, and the cats wouldn't eat  it.  I'm like-  If the cats won't eat sushi-  I'm like, bad sign.  I'm in deep ass.  Oh.  Deep ass.  And were you?  Oh, yeah.  And that was just from my thing.  I think I ate one piece.  It's better if I shoveled it in, laughing and giggling, not thinking.  Oh.  Dude, I'm fucking gossiping and having a great time. 
[02:12:00]  I was with Bono, hanging out with Bono, and shoving it down his gullet.  My worst experience, I was going to the beach, Robert Moses or something, out there on Long  Island, and went to one of the delis, got myself a nice ham and Swiss on a roll with  mustard.  Nice, right?  Ah, yeah.  And then a side order of potato salad.  Mmm, potato salad.  Nice little whatever, you know, quarter ounce or half ounce, whatever.  First of all, let me chastise you for potato salad on the beach. 
[02:12:30]  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  You don't take it to the beach.  Took it to the beach.  I remember it was about 100 degrees.  Yeah, nice baking in the sun, mayonnaise, egg.  Maybe an hour or two later, I finally decide to get to my potato salad.  Good choice.  That was very, very mayonnaise-y.  Mm-hmm.  And I ate the thing.  And then I had to go out east to have dinner with my brother.  And to make a long story short, it got so bad, the diarrhea, that I was dry heaving from  my butt.  Nothing else would come out, but I was still contracting. 
[02:13:00]  Like it was just opening up and puckering?  Yeah.  It was like...  Looked like a horse after they're done.  When a horse is finished, but it's still like the muscles are still going.  It must have been so bad that my body was saying, look, we don't know what's still left  in here, but we're going to still try to get it out.  You don't think Ben has the flu, do you?  I don't think so.  He probably just ate bad surgery.  Oh, there you go.  Something to be paranoid about.  Great.  Just making sure.  Looks like grandma's lips.  Come kiss grandma. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Yee.  All right.  Poor Ben.  I feel bad for the little messy-haired little guy.  The little awful body.  Little fella.  Well, let's get into some show stuff.  Glasses all askew, fogging up from the heat coming off of his body.  He's got a bucket in his lap, puking and shitting at the same time.  That's a tough thing to do.  Yeah.  You don't know where to go.  You flip around.  Do you get the garbage bucket and sit there, or do you... 
[02:14:00]  Do you ever puke and shit at the same time?  No.  Can't say I have.  Well, same thing happened with the potato salad.  I know some people that have.  Toilet, thank God, right next to the sink, because how else do you figure that one out?  I've heard stories of people that go to woof, they go into the toilet, and it shoots out  on the wall behind them.  It's an hysterical image, but I wouldn't want to be there.  You just brought back a memory, man.  Jeez, really?  I'm sorry to hear that.  From the frat house, we had this disgusting pig of a guy. 
[02:14:30]  He was a fat guy.  I don't want to say his name.  The guy would get so hammered, and then he would have explosive diarrhea, and for some  reason, he needed to sleep naked in the TV room with a blanket.  Jesus.  And I guess...  Why didn't you tell the guy?  Knock it off.  Whatever.  You're in your room.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I mean, these guys would come home at four or five in the morning, whatever they want  to do.  And I guess he would be so drunk, he would just take his clothes off.  He had no idea what was going on. 
[02:15:00]  He's one of these guys.  Yeah.  And we actually found crap on the walls, all over the couch.  His ass exploded all over the TV room.  And instead of the rest of us getting pissed off, we were just amazed.  Like, how the F...  Just crapped all over the walls.  What position do you have to be in to get crap, like, I don't know, five feet up on a  wall?  And then the guy's apologizing, because he doesn't remember anything.  Of course not. 
[02:15:30]  How you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny.  And you're listening to the worst of Ophie and Anthony, which ain't that bad.  Do we have an update on poor Ben?  Ben's very sick.  Both phones are off and dumping both into voicemail.  Is he sleeping, you think?  Oh, wow.  I think so.  I think he's in a lot of pain.  I wish he was in here.  We should have spun him in a circle.  Oh.  He's puking and crapping his brains out, because he ate bad sushi.  That's what we're hearing.  Yeah.  The reports are in.  Hopefully, we'll get an update tomorrow.  Usually, that's a 24-hour thing, right?  If you get the bad sushi. 
[02:16:00]  Dude, I was fucking...  How much he can't even be herky-jerky today?  He's probably like...  Oh, the second he herks or jerks, he craps himself.  He's only herky-ing.  Like a doll that's running out of batteries.  He's just...  His messy hair is all matted down with sweat over his eyes.  Tippy Tom underwear.  The poor guy.  Oh, he's a mess.  He's more of a mess than usual.  Oh, poor little Ben.  Poor Ben.  His little hedgehog body all curled up in a ball as he shivers. 
[02:16:30]  He can't get the sheet to cover his big cock.  Keeps flopping over the side of the bed.  Hits the floor.  Yeah.  All that body hair shedding on his bed sheets.  As he shivers.  Making a little hole in his mat.  Just like a den.  For him to just lay in.  Sweating in it.  Leaning over the bed, just vomiting into his bucket.  Every time he sneezes, he has to change the sheets.  Because he's shitting onto his nice bed. 
[02:17:00]  I bet you when he's in the bathroom, he looks like toothpaste being squeezed from the middle.  Just both ends shooting some type of vile, smelly liquid.  We now go inside Ben's bathroom.  God bless me, dude. 
[02:17:30]  That's insane.  That's nuts.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Call back to yesterday.  That's crazy.  That's nuts.  That's insane, dude.  Dude, my friend in Boston.  As he's clapping.  He's clapping and herkies.  He's puking and shitting.  Go Sox. 
[02:18:00]  Bad sushi.  The toilet bowl's glowing.  Poor Ben.  That big head, it's hard to get it completely over the toilet.  Because when he bends over, his skull hits the lid.  So he pukes half on the front of the seat and half in the bowl.  He has to go sideways so that big head doesn't hit the fucking, the upturned lid.  He's clanking the septic tank. 
[02:18:30]  You hate when you're sitting there like, nothing came out.  I go, you prepare for your abs to hurt.  Oh, and it just is aching.  Poor Ben.  He's been wiping his ass since 4 o'clock in the morning.  It probably feels like a nice raw, like he rubbed a piece of a potato chip in between, 
[02:19:00]  like a sour cream and onion potato chip in between his tender ass cheeks.  It's all red and sore.  First time his abs have felt any kind of workout.  Yeah.  He's going to come in with a six-pack of abs.  All buff.  Little short arms.  Ben's a disaster.  That's why he can't comb his hair.  His arms are too short.  Poor guy's at home suffering.  Yeah, poor little T-Rex body.  Can't even.  Tries to comb it, but he's herking and jerking, so his hair goes all over the place. 
[02:19:30]  He probably wipes his ass by rubbing it on the rug like a dog does.  It's called scooting.  He's scoot on the rug.  Oh, dude.  Oh, poor guy.  Liquidy, awful dump.  Oh, you know it's just a bad day for him at home.  I'd like to see that guy from Pennsylvania giving it to Ben in his dumper while he's puking.  He can't even shit.  He's so filled to the rim with shame.  He's being brutally raped on the radio.  Wow. 
[02:20:00]  And Ben hates when we talk about his personal stuff or his cock.  Oh, I know.  I can't stop talking about it.  I wish he was here.  He hates it.  Yeah.  Oh, that bathroom.  Who's going to clean?  Does he have a maid or something?  I hope so.  A street team of some sort.  A street team.  Looks like he threw a Yoo-Hoo into the ceiling fan.  Someone's got to clean that up.  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  My second chocolate beverage joke of the day. 
[02:20:30]  And they're both gems.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, that's funny.  It's dripping onto his rug.  Oh, I hope his whole apartment is ruined with his shit and vomit.  I hope he puked into every electronic component he has.  Dude, I got shit in my cell phone.  I don't know.  Poor guy.  The only thing that would make me happier is if I could lift up his sheet and cut one of 
[02:21:00]  my vile farts and then watch his sweaty forehead be too sick to get up and just vomit.  Spray Lysol.  He can't do anything.  He's going to puke like the exorcist.  Just lay there and vomit pee soup under your pillow.  Powerless.  Oh, the poor son of a bitch.  That's awful.  Steve, any...  Just talked to Ben.  He's on his way to the doctor, I believe.  Oh, is he listening?  Yeah, he's listening.  He said, is it you that keeps trying to call me?  Knock it off.  Is he feeling a little bit better?  Not really.  Gotta go to the doctor. 
[02:21:30]  He's in bed.  He can't stop sweating.  Can we call out?  So he's back to normal.  That's good.  When can he sweat?  He's one of those guys that would be the polar swimmers who would sweat when he gets out  of the little hole in the ice.  Who's that guy ice fishing naked, sweating?  Oh, he's going to the doctor.  Yeah.  So he sounds serious now.  He's fine.  He doesn't sound like he's in good shape.  Has he been taking Pepto-Bismol or something?  Yeah, yeah.  We just want to say hi to him real fast.  He sees the number on the cell phone, and he just won't pick it up. 
[02:22:00]  And then he calls my other cell, and he goes, stop it.  What does he think he is?  Earl?  Yeah.  That sound etiquette?  Oh, God.  Is that funny?  I want him to hold the phone by the bowl while he's releasing it.  That's what I want to hear.  Definitely.  Ben isn't that kind of guy, though.  Not at all.  He doesn't like it.  He's very embarrassed.  He's very private about his bodily functions.  Bodily functions.  I remember when we were doing dump stories, he was very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable.  He opens the door or the window in the bathroom here and freezes everybody out.  I'll bet you when he was a kid, he was known as Big Duties Ben. 
[02:22:30]  I'll bet you in kindergarten, he clogged a couple of toilets, or he stood up and had  the type of logs that were poking up through the seat, and the other boys and girls noticed,  hey, it's Big Duties Ben.  Stuck with him and gave him a complex.  That's why he sweats so much.  He's always nervous that they're going to stick up and give him away.  They're going to think of my little name that they gave me and taunt me with it.  Big Duties Ben.  Carlos from Long Island. 
[02:23:00]  Ben's a-hole looks like the back of the Batmobile.  Oh, that's good.  Oh.  Do you realize who you hired?  He's a disruptive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible people.  Our new bosses said you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.

[02:27:30]  The worst of Obi and Anthony. No more of that. It's bad for you. Ben's busy trying to book guests for  our show. I love that. I've read all the emails from corporate. I've seen everything. I just don't  comment. You know what I do with email? I email the staff of this program only. I don't email  corporate. And it's just like, hey, did you see this story in the news? Perhaps we should  print it out for tomorrow. I see emails that are CC'd with like 20 people. And it's all 
[02:28:00]  of us from the show. It's management. It's sub-management. It's all these corporate people.  And the last one I saw was a couple of days back and it was about guests. Right. It was  about booking guests. High-powered, Obi. High-caliber guests they want on this program.  Well, the people down there in Washington, yeah, they feel like we should have bigger guests  on this show. Bigger guests will make the show more good. They're not feeling the Rich Vosses  and the Carlos Mencia's. No, no. These guys are all really good friends of ours and do 
[02:28:30]  really good radio. That's the point. But I guess... The Pablos. We do know a collection  of S's. We certainly do. But they do good radio. But I guess it's all about having that  big guest on the show. And they'll sit there and say nothing. But you can tell everyone,  hey, we had George Clooney on the show. Now, yeah. It's not there? Okay. Ben is now trying  some of these contacts to see if we can get certain guests on the show. Because it's 
[02:29:00]  Ben's ass on the line. It's been hinted, look, if Ben doesn't get a bigger guest, he's going  to go bye-bye. But let me tell you something. It ain't Ben's fault. I understand. This program  is not inviting to people of that caliber, of that type of Hollywood guest, does not really  want to sit here and discuss punching women in the face promos to sell their god-awful  Hollywood-drivel movies. Right. But Ben is trying. Ben's trying to get Brad Pitt. Yeah. Ben's 
[02:29:30]  trying. Like, you wouldn't believe. He called me at lunch yesterday going, all right. And  he's laughing and giggling the whole time because he knows how stupid this is. Of course it is.  But he's doing what he's told from the people in Washington. So who are you trying to get  on this show, Ben? Dude, dude. I'm on the phone. I'm on the other line right now with  Johnny Depp's people. I'm going to get Johnny Depp on the show. That was the funny one.  Johnny Depp and his people don't even know what XM satellite radio is. Of course they  don't. But Ben's trying, man. He's trying. It's a fledgling industry. We know that. The 
[02:30:00]  people that are subscribed to XM, the people that work at XM, the people that are involved  in some way, shape, or form with satellite radio, they understand what it is. They see  the potential in this. It's going to be huge. It's going to take time, though. But the reality  of it is there are still a lot of people that have yet to find out what's going on with  satellite radio. They will, just like cable TV. They will. But where we are right now, 
[02:30:30]  it's very hard to call up George fucking Clooney and convince him that it's advantageous for  him to come on this program to sell his movie. It's basically asking George Clooney if he  wants to do an interview with a college radio station.  Do you want to hang out with us? That's pretty much what it is. Hi, George.  Hey, George Clooney. Hi. It's Opie, Anthony, and a few of our friends. And we'd like to  know if you want to come down and hang out with us.  Maybe have a beer or something.  You're going to have a beer.  You're not that busy, right? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, we'll be talking to a lot of people, relatively speaking. If you would hang out with my neighbor  down the street, it would be far less people you'd be talking to. But, you know, you want  to come out? XM satellite radio. What? Satellite. Yeah, it's up there in space. No, XM. Yeah,  like FM, only with an X in front and the F is gone.  No, you don't have to put a space suit on.  No. No, it's on Earth.  It's on Earth, right. 
[02:31:30]  It's on Earth.  We just want you to come down and we can talk about Ocean's 12 that's coming out and  you know, all that. What? No. No, it's not CB. It's XM satellite radio. No, you won't  have to key down the mic when you talk.  No, it's not accurate about that little bit you just did.  Why?  You would never have George Clooney on the phone.  Right. How did I get George Clooney on my fake phone?  You would have George Clooney's people's people.  I took it way out. Oh, I was talking to George. A little out of control there, you know, thinking 
[02:32:00]  you're that big that you would actually get him on the phone. I actually almost had him,  I thought. I thought he was coming in. So, Ben, who are we working to get on the show in  the near future? Who are we working? Watch Ben start giggling. Oh, we better not say it.  Someone might block us. No one's blocking us because we have four times the influence other  people do. Exactly. Who are we working on, Ben? You really want to know some of the ones  you guys absolutely want to know. These are actual phone calls that Ben has made just  to try to save his job. George Clooney. Yeah, we know. That's a possibility. 
[02:32:30]  Brad Pitt. Johnny Depp. Yeah. Easy. Yeah, those were, those, yeah. What did, uh...  Colin Farrell. What did Johnny Depp's people really say? Yeah, they just, they didn't, they  were like, whatever. Whatever. That's great. Well, we have a definite whatever of Johnny Depp's  people. I'm sure that's exactly what they say to Good Morning America, too. Ah, whatever.  Didn't you tell them about the, the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, our little  MiFi Walkman? Yeah. That's a great invention. Hey, uh, Ben. Yes. You know, we're clearing 
[02:33:00]  out the cubicles and stuff. Uh, you two can set up right in that room. Well, you know,  I was thinking that, you know. I think we should call up Bono. Yeah. And see if we can't  get him, uh, get him down here. Uh, uh, well, what the fuck is XM? Will you have some  fucking Guinness? Okay, right there. So there's some, there's actually some other ones. There's  actually some other ones I don't want to mention that look pretty good. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  secrets. We, we might have a shot at someone that actually has name recognition. No, no, 
[02:33:30]  we have, well, you know what it is? Dude, we can't even get Lewis Black anymore. Yeah,  Lewis Black is even blowing us off. Lewis Black is blowing us off. How are we going to get  anybody? If, if, if anyone holds Ben responsible for not getting guests for this show, I will personally  put them in a bucket and ship them out because it's not anyone's fault. It's just the, people  don't want to come on this show right now. Not yet. I mean, it's a slow build. It's a very  slow build. We understood what we were getting into, but we believe in this technology. We 
[02:34:00]  believe this is the future radio, but it's going to take some time. Our biggest interview  so far has been John McEnroe. That's not too bad. And it's because we were going to be on  his show that night. Oh yeah. That's not bad. We talked about Tatum O'Neill. We also had  Ozzy on. Right, right. On the phone. I'm talking about coming in.  McGraw didn't come in here. Oh, that's right. But Lewis Black will come on though. You guys,  I read the email. The biggest guest has been Pablo. In spring, in the spring, when there's  a book to promote, they said that he will be coming on. We had Kevin Smith on the phone  too. We found, we're finding out who our. Yeah, in the spring, Lewis is, you know something? 
[02:34:30]  We're finding out who our real friends are. You know, a lot of people blew us off after our  demise. I'm a little pissed off at Lewis. I never wanted to be pissed at Lewis. I like the  man. He's very funny. And, and, and now we're getting the blow off from Lewis Black.  Yeah, he said. Those daily show people are a bunch of assholes. I love the show, but  they, they have gotten so like self-important. Well, in the early days. Central, slow down. 
[02:35:00]  The early days at AEW, Jon Stewart was on the show all the time. Yeah, we had Jon Stewart  on the show. And now he, he won't come on the show. No way. And it's harder now than it  was at AEW. That's all right. All right. Well, so we're working on big guests for the,  uh, Mario Cantone lined up. The new Opie and Anthony show. Oh, now we got Brittany, Eminem  and you two. We'll have them all playing out here on top. All at the same time. It'll  be great. And then Steve could come in and punch Brittany in the vagina. Never say no, but 
[02:35:30]  there's a reality to this whole thing. Yeah. You know, famous people want nothing to do  with us. Right. Stop hiding us on the premium tier and then maybe we could get even a bigger  guest. We're not like Hollywood Howie where you can have these guests on. And to tell you  the truth, I don't necessarily want them on. Yeah. We never really wanted the high profile  guests on our show. This show isn't about getting, what are we, are you going to sit  Johnny Depp down there too cool for the room and start talking to him? I'd like to.  Just smell his finger. Get a picture. For a while, but get a picture, of course. It's about 
[02:36:00]  the funny on this show. Yeah. A lot of people feel like you're not doing a really good radio  show unless you have that A-list celebrity sitting there saying nothing. You know what  it's like? And the bigger the celebrity, you know, a little inside to this whole thing,  like we had Carmen Electra on a few times. We had a whole bitch. We had a bunch of almost  A-list celebrities we'll call them, but Carmen Electra, when she was on our show, she was  definitely happening, okay? This is what happens. They sit down and then a whole entourage of  people come in. Their publicist. The publicist, which is the scum of the earth, the publicist 
[02:36:30]  will sit there and look at you like you're a piece of shit and question everything you're  asking their client with those faces. They make the face and they'll shake their head  like, no, no. And they're constantly looking at their watch and doing the cut off sign  with their finger on the neck. They give you the wrap it up sign. They're pointing at their  watch. You want to lean over and smack them. And you ask them a question that's a little  off kilter, something that they're not asked every friggin' time they do an interview. 
[02:37:00]  And the publicist looks at you, shakes their head no and puts that scowl on their face.  No, even worse.  You want to reach over and choke the bitch.  No, even worse, they'll pull their client out of the studio or they'll cover up the  microphone or they'll say stuff like, don't answer that.  Yeah.  Crocodile Hunters, remember his publicist hung up on the call because she didn't like the  questions?  Oh, that's right. Remember that?  Yeah.  And the publicist, when you do the phone call interviews, they listen on another line.  And they got the hookup. And if they decide it's going to a place that they don't like,  yeah, they'll just hang up on the interview.  Yeah. And it's no fun to be involved with that. I don't like those guests. 
[02:37:30]  We don't really care. I mean, if it happens, it happens. But yeah, I mean, they can't be  obsessed with us talking to the really, really famous people on our show.  If people want to come in and hang out.  It's usually very boring radio.  Yeah. If they want to come in and hang out and be part of the show, that's fine. But to  sit there and try to do an interview and ask them the same questions they've been  asked a thousand times, it sucks.  Well, I think that we could ask some original questions. Like, I'd love to get Ozzy in  the studio because I want to ask him, like, what made you want to get into music? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, that's a good question. I'm sure he's never been asked before.  Yeah.  Like, what are you going to ask?  All right, well.  Enough.  We do have a few guests calling in today. Who do we have today, Ben?  Whoa.  We have some 90-limin.  Who do we got?  The L list.  I'm sure it's huge.  Here we go.  Got that call from Johnny Depp back, did you?  Here we go.  Johnny Depp's in at 9 o'clock. Britney's performing live at 8.  On that definite whatever.  Bono and the Edge are going to come by and have some Guinness with us.  Nice.  You're psyched. 
[02:38:30]  We're going to have the guest rundown every day with Ben.  All right, Ben?  Great.  Who do we have today on the show?  We have Jonathan Gold, who wants to talk about the...  He has some theories on 9-11.  Okay.  It's going to be very interesting.  Ah.  And Dom Morena.  Is that how you say his name?  Dom Morena.  We don't...  Dom Morena.  I'm sorry.  Guests so good, we don't even know their names.  What did I say?  Dom Morena.  What did I say?  Dom Morena, you said.  Dom Morena.  Who the hell is he?  I think that was the guy that Vito Corleone stabbed. 
[02:39:00]  Rich Vass.  Antonio Andolini.  Dom Morena.  Sorry.  All right, I can't wait to talk to Dom Morena.  Wasn't that a dance a few years ago?  Hey, Dom Morena.  He was the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins.  You remember him?  Yeah.  Dom Morena?  Maybe that's why he can't get guests.  He's asking for Johnny Dupe.  What?  Who?  I want Frank Clooney, and I want him now.  I can get Rich Vass.  That's as good as I can get.  Dude, I want Pete Osborne in this studio.  Well, this is going to be hell. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, I love that George Clowney.  Sure.  He's good.  I didn't know what Ben was doing yesterday.  Ben's like, look, I just want to black sky this.  Oh, this show is so stupid.  Dom Morena.  Dom Morena.  Hey, Dom Morena.  Jesus.  I'm going to call him Dom Morena now.  Dom Morena.  He's a very funny comic.  Yeah, he is.  Dom Morena.  Hi, it's Jim Norton, and this is the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:40:00]  You stink.  I don't know if there's much to the story, but I was getting text messages from Ben.  It seemed like the middle of the night.  What time was that?  Like 2 in the morning or something like that?  It was late, yeah.  Like 2, 2.30 in the morning.  Which I don't do that much anymore if it wasn't a big deal.  I know.  It wasn't a big deal.  Well, I won't do it if it's a big deal, and I texted Norton as well.  And I was awake.  I was walking home from the cellar.  For some reason, it comes up as unknown.  Whenever somebody texts me, I can't connect to who it is.  I don't know why, so I just get this thing. 
[02:40:30]  I'm standing next to Bono right now.  Yeah.  Unknown.  I figured it was Ben.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I got the actual text message.  It was at 3.42 in the morning.  It was late.  Wow.  It was late.  It was the Saturday night after party.  I know.  And it says, I'm standing next to Bono with lots of exclamation points.  And that's all he says.  You should have continued the story, man.  I had my camera, dude.  I would have got pictures.  He could have got a picture.  I mean, I didn't have a camera, but he was taking photos with everybody.  I called Jim, because I knew Jim would still be up.  So you went to the SNL after show party, whatever they call it?  How do you get into that? 
[02:41:00]  I went to it a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, it's easy.  He gets in everywhere, dude.  It's amazing.  That's why he works for the show.  The guy's a social butterfly.  Yeah, it's easy.  It's easy.  It was cool.  But so I walk in, and I see, like, holy shit, there's Bono walking through.  So I went over and talked to him.  He's a nice guy.  I've sat and actually had a conversation with him.  What did you say to Bono?  Nothing, really.  He was hammered.  I was like, what's up, Bono?  I was like, eh, and his poor wife.  Because he's so famous that he can't go more than, like, two feet.  Everybody.  It was just like, everybody's pulling on him, and he's got his purple glasses on.  He's such a little midget, too. 
[02:41:30]  He's about this tall.  He's so small.  I've heard he's really short.  He's tiny.  Like 5'4 tops.  Tiny, tiny, tiny.  I'd love to get a picture with him.  I knew you would, and you could have done it.  I could have got you in.  You would have wanted one, too.  I would have wanted that.  Of course.  I would have wanted that picture bad.  Yeah, I would have got one with Bono.  Who else goes to the Saturday Night Live after party?  The cast.  The cast?  Bunch of fuckers.  It's the same people.  You know how it all works.  No, I don't.  I absolutely don't know what it's like to go to a Saturday Night Live after party.  I'd like to on time.  We don't do that type of thing.  So would I.  Because we're not invited. 
[02:42:00]  I would like to sit in a corner and look out of place like I do at every one of these stupid parties.  Remember the magazine party we went to, like, a few weeks back?  Sink?  Yeah, Sink.  And that was like VIP.  And that was a low-key one.  But it was one of those types of parties.  Like, all the parties are like that, but it's just who, like, how much more famous the people are that are there.  That's the only difference to any of the parties.  It's loud music from a DJ.  Know what was wrong with that party?  What?  We were the most famous people there, which.  Yeah, that's a problem right there. 
[02:42:30]  No, I'm not even kidding.  Because you go to these things going, wow, I can't wait to meet people.  You know, famous people.  Famous people.  We were the star attraction.  They whisked us into the VIP.  And we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  Yeah.  They whisked us into the VIP section.  I sat down in a chair or on one of those couch things with the little one-inch-by-one-inch table in front of you.  Like, everything's too cool and completely impractical.  The little table can barely fit your drink on it, but it's a cool little table. 
[02:43:00]  The couches are, you know, groovy, but very uncomfortable.  And then they had cell phones that were wired down that you could use to call the waitresses to get you drinks.  Hello.  That's pretty cool, actually.  Yeah.  So you want to talk into somebody else's filthy mouthpiece.  But the music is just, there's like techno blasting so loud that you can't even talk to each other.  Like, Ope was right next to me, and I'm just like, hey, Ope!  See, this would have been a great opportunity to actually have some loud techno music. 
[02:43:30]  Too late.  Don't even try.  Ah, look at him in the booth.  He's all flustered.  He should be.  He missed a cue.  I know.  That was kind of like, you know.  He was bummed.  He was trying to.  Yeah, I know.  That's okay.  That kid works hard.  He's great.  He's a good kid.  He's a good boy.  Yeah, but, you know, the only reason we were there was for the free stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  But free stuff.  No, we hate those things.  Yeah, it's not like.  We were in the magazine, so, you know, we had to go.  Like, I would want to go to one with, like, a bunch of famous people.  Well, yeah.  Because then you could sit around and go, oh, look at that.  There's what's-his-name.  You could do a little stargazing. 
[02:44:00]  Bootsy Watson.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, from that show.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, I know that guy who was in that movie.  Hey, do you mind if I take a picture?  Oh, there, Jim.  Hey, can I take a picture?  Brewer tells a great story about Nicholson going to one of the SNL parties.  Jim Brewer tells.  I don't know the story, but I mean.  You don't know the story, but bring it up.  No, I just think I say that.  All right, I really stink.  I'm a turkey through the windshield of fun.  I heard Belushi used to have a lot of fun at those things. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, recovery night.  Yeah.  So, nothing else on Bono?  No, not really, you know.  I just, I thought it was funny.  I knew Jim would want to get a photo, too.  How many people did you have to text message that?  Probably 10.  Yeah.  10, at least.  I'm so mad that I didn't.  I knew you would be honest.  I had a feeling it was you, too, but you got to call me on those.  Just leave me a message.  Yeah.  Who else would text you with that at that hour?  You don't know.  It could be anybody.  Bono.  I mean, anybody I know.  So, why wouldn't you check it anyway?  You didn't check the text message? 
[02:45:00]  That's why I've seen a friend of mine.  No, no, I did.  Sweetie, I checked the message, but it comes up as unknown.  For some reason, it never registers who sent me the text message.  He didn't know who it was.  That's what he's saying.  So, you thought someone was just playing with you?  No, I think it was one of my friends.  I actually thought it might be Ben, but I didn't know.  I'm like, I don't want to call him at four in the morning and be sleeping.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I got it all figured out.  All right, I'll tell you if you're right.  You were busy doing something else.  No, you're wrong.  Totally wrong.  To get a piece of Bono, I would certainly go.  But knowing you, you would at least call Ben back going, is this for real or whatever?  Because you're still up at that time, no problem. 
[02:45:30]  I'll tell you why.  Because it was so late.  Like you said, almost four in the morning.  If it wasn't him, I didn't want to wake him.  I don't know what he's doing.  I mean, he might get laid or he could be sleeping or he could be, you know, having his hair fixed with a hammer.  That's what I'm saying.  It's Ben.  You know he's still awake.  He could be standing in front of a fan with a saw fixing his hair.  Ben, who's the big guy now?  Like, who's the big star on SNL now?  I was saying that earlier.  I don't know.  Horatians, I guess.  Because I guess the old parties used to be like there would be this hierarchy, like the guys that would get a lot of airtime would hang out and be all rowdy and stuff. 
[02:46:00]  Does that happen anymore?  Yeah, well, you know what it is, too?  There's the actual cast party and then there's the after-after party.  So it's like...  Which one did you go to?  I went to the cast party and then I tried to go to the after-after party.  I knew the doorman at the door, but the cops...  The after you were shut down?  The cops went over the fire code, so I couldn't get in.  But the invite was really cool.  It was of the U2 iPod.  It was like this little flyer.  It was pretty badass.  Did Bond all go to the after-after party? 
[02:46:30]  I don't know.  Because I couldn't...  It was just too much of a headache.  You were at the cast party and it was 3.45?  No, they don't start until like 2.  It starts late and they usually keep it going late.  And then the after-after party would have to be at what time?  4.  4.  I get home at like quarter to 5.  Was Daryl Hammond there?  He's a friend of mine.  No.  It's just...  A lot of people...  Name dropper.  Daryl?  I like Daryl.  I did drop his name.  Name dropper.  What made my famous friend?  So what?  You were busy doing something.  I'm telling you.  No, I wasn't.  There's a story there that you're not willing to tell.  I'm thinking if Jim's awake at that hour, he's doing something. 
[02:47:00]  No, it was a seller.  You're doing something and you know it was worth a call back to Ben because you know he's  still awake and you didn't make that call.  So that means you were preoccupied with something.  Because it wasn't concrete.  It was nothing I could go on there.  Oh, stop.  I'm telling you.  I did the seller.  I was done by like 2.30.  I wound up eating.  I was just walking back to my car to go home and I got the message.  You see that text message and you're not calling Ben?  I wasn't sure.  If I knew it was Ben, I would have called him in a second.  I'm not buying it, man.  Why would I lie?  I was getting a hook there.  I wouldn't tell you.  I don't know.  What could he possibly keep secret from us?  I was helping an old lady across the street. 
[02:47:30]  Because knowing you and your celebrity photos, I'm thinking no matter what.  I didn't know where it was.  It could have been somebody in L.A. I know.  Just brag.  I didn't know.  I know a lot of friends, dude.  One of them could have just been, hey, I'm standing next to Bono.  It wasn't like he said, come up to 48th Street or wherever it was.  Did Ben pop in your brain at all?  Yes.  So?  First thing.  Because I know he's a big YouTube fan.  But it wasn't a sure thing.  Yeah.  A lot of things pop into my head.  It was worth a call back.  You and I'm jacking off.  Hey, Hope, I was just thinking of you.  A lot of things pop into your head.  A penis. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Well, congratulations to Ben.  Well, because Bono's one of your heroes.  He's hung out and talked with Bono for quite a while.  Yeah.  We had a five-minute conversation.  How about next time you put, it's Ben, comma.  Just so I know it's you.  Because most people's text message, they get it.  I know.  I don't know why mine's retarded.  What's wrong with my phone?  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The OPNM Show.  No, it was the coldest winter, literally, that I can remember in my life. 
[02:48:30]  You know, it was really nice weather if you were a fucking moose.  If you had fur on your nuts, it was a festival out there.  I didn't have a thought the whole winter.  Seriously, I spent the whole winter.  The only thought I had was, fuck, it's cold.  Or it's cold as fuck.  Halfway through the winter, I decided I didn't want to be a comic anymore. 
[02:49:00]  I wanted to be a bear.  Because bears are more evolved.  It gets cold, and what does the bear do?  He goes, well, I'm going to bed.  This blows.  And then it gets warm, and he goes, well, fuck, time to wake up.  They've got to stop reporting wind chill.  That's nonsense.  It really is. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know where they came up with it, why they came up with it.  It's a lie.  If it's, they come up, well, it's 27 degrees today.  But with the wind chill, it's minus three.  Well, then it's minus three, asshole!  I don't need to know what the weather was like if conditions were perfect.  It was just, it was too goddamn cold. 
[02:50:00]  And there's no reason for that.  You shouldn't have to live under these kind of conditions during the winter.  We had a huge surplus a few years ago, and I'd like to figure out where the fuck it went.  And we even have money now that could be used for a project that I have to prevent this kind of nonsense.  You know, we just had the President and the Congress, in their infinite wisdom,  decided that what would really stimulate the economy is a $350 billion tax cut 
[02:50:30]  at a time in which every fucking state and union is broke!  We don't have any fucking money!  So what the fuck money are you cutting?  What tax money are you cutting?  What the fuck's being cut?  It's not there!  It's not fucking there!  It doesn't exist!  You're not going to stimulate anything if you have nothing to fucking...  You just made the money up, you fucking idiotic hoes! 
[02:51:00]  So as long as they think we have that money,  then we should use that money to build a giant wall up in Canada.  Because that's where the cold air comes from.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio. 
[02:51:30]  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  It's everything.  24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  We'll be in Anthony.  XM 202.  Well, Anthony, this is a twisted story.  Pledge tells a vicious beating.  Vicious beating.  Fraternity hazing.  A pledge.  Fraternity hazing.  It's been in the news off and on the past, I don't know, 10 years or so. 
[02:52:00]  What happens to you if you just want to go to college and not be in a fraternity?  Is there a downside to that?  Because I don't see an upside of being in a fraternity at all.  It depends where you go.  I went to Geneseo.  Back in the day, it was all about being in a fraternity or sorority.  Back in the stay?  I know.  You kind of felt like you didn't really belong if you weren't part of a group back then.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  You had all the fraternities walking around campus, the sororities.  But, like, would...  And then the fraternities would get...  Would it really bother anybody if they had to walk around not being part of a fraternity?  No, there was plenty of people that didn't.  Like, I don't get...  But the parties were unbelievable.  You hook up with a sorority and, you know, instant party with girls that like to drink and get laid.  If you weren't in a fraternity, you weren't allowed to go to the sorority party?  You would let outsiders in a little bit here and there.  All right.  So I still... 
[02:53:00]  I am not getting it.  But you would feel kind of out of place.  Yeah?  Yeah, definitely.  It was an instant party.  I mean, if you're in a dorm and you want to get one of these, you know, crazy parties going, you know, you've got to know a lot of people.  You have to, you know, if you're in a fraternity, there's a lot of guys you hate, even though you're in the same fraternity.  But it's instant party.  You've got a hundred guys and then you've got a sorority with a hundred girls right there.  Boom.  So it's pretty much just for the parties.  Yeah, I would say so.  If people say it's for more, I would laugh at you. 
[02:53:30]  I just don't understand the whole fraternity sorority thing.  No, I got some good friends out of the fraternity I joined, but I...  Do you have a secret handshake?  No, nothing stupid like that.  Were you in Lambda Lambda Lambda?  The black fraternity.  The tri-lams.  The tri-lams, yes.  It was all about partying.  You know, I made some good friends out of it.  I hated it.  I hated being in a fraternity.  I, you know, I try to be an individual.  I try not to follow the trends of what's going on, but I don't know. 
[02:54:00]  I thought it was a good idea at the time.  And then I tried to, like, leave halfway through pledging, and I got a little visit from some  brothers.  And basically, they said in a very nice way, just stick it out.  And I'm like, why?  What if you just said, I don't want to?  They're like, trust me, just stick it out.  It's not good if you quit in the middle.  And what happens if you just said no?  They pretty much made it clear that my life would be miserable. 
[02:54:30]  So I got through it.  And then I saw the other guys that did drop out.  And they would get the shit beat out of them, basically.  So if you drop out, you were beaten?  And guys would get, yeah, guys would transfer and stuff.  Yeah, they were scared.  I heard they would put, like, a blanket on you and beat you with their soap and then  say, remember, it's just a bad dream, fat boy.  And you'd lay there going, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Oh, the other guy would cover his ears in that chilling music playing.  Then you'd pass out because your candidate lost the election. 
[02:55:00]  While this guy, why is Private Pyle saying African-American?  We haven't even gotten into this, and the phones are just lit.  Jake from Plattsburgh, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  What's going on?  Yeah, I'm still up here in Plattsburgh right now.  I live about 10 feet from the college.  And when I used to go there, they killed my friend, one of the frats.  Well, by accident, obviously, right?  Well, yeah, yeah, you can call it an accident, but all this hazing shit is bullshit. 
[02:55:30]  They were making him do the water treatment.  They just kept having him drink gallons and gallons of water.  Oh, yeah, water poisoning.  I read that story.  Yeah, and that's what happened.  He was one of my best friends.  There was, like, six of us, and we were all going to pledge this frat.  He was pledging in the first semester, and ever since then, like, I don't go to the college anymore.  I now go to a different one.  What's the water thing?  I don't understand.  You just drink water.  You could drink.  I didn't even know this. 
[02:56:00]  I remember this story.  You could drink so much water that you could die.  You'd die.  Too much water gets in your system.  It starts leaking out of your blood vessels into your brain.  Are there any signs that it's happening?  You just keep doing it?  You have to drink a ridiculous amount of water.  Relax.  Should I finish this or not?  Yeah, of course you can.  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.  I don't even know.  Maybe a doctor could tell us or whatever, but no, it's got to be a ridiculous amount.  Over a very short period of time, also.  Yeah, you just got to keep forcing it in.  Yeah.  So.  Really nasty.  Wow.  Yeah, I remember that story. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, it was in a lot of papers.  Right.  Okay.  Fat, drunk, and killing pledges is no way to go through life.  Ah, he stepped on everything.  Damn it.  I tried to get in there.  I'm doing an animal house thing, and he's fucking talking.  Glad your friend's dead.  Holy ass.  Ruined my line.  You had enough good ones.  Very important to me.  You had enough good ones today.  The show is very important to me.  You had enough good lines today.  You could have freaking let this guy slide.  Jesus.  Jesus. 
[02:57:00]  You didn't get enough sleep last night.  Oh, my God.  Maybe the line wasn't that important.  Okay, Jake.  Who's the mean one on this show?  That's okay, guys.  I was just saying, my cars are traveling advertising for you guys.  Not anymore.  All right.  I love you guys.  All right, cool.  Thank you, Jake.  See you, guys.  And it was a good line, Anthony.  Wow.  I thought he was off the phone by that plan.  Yeah, he's still there.  PJ from the Bronx. 
[02:57:30]  How you doing, guys?  First phone out, kids.  And his friend died.  If you're going to be in a fraternity, you deserve to die.  Disgusting.  I just don't get it.  Did you have your little sweatshirt with the little Greek letters on it?  Did you?  Oh, yeah, I did.  I didn't wear mine often, though.  Often, which you wore it a few times.  Yeah.  What did it say on the back of your sweatshirt?  Halfway down the back, did it have an arrow pointed to your ass and say, enter here?  Yeah, there is some gayness going on.  Oh, my God. 
[02:58:00]  You know, I would...  And I...  Yeah, I admit that.  It was a little weird.  Oh, you do.  Would you like to admit it while reading Rent Boys?  Yes.  Oh, no, man.  I was in Genesea.  My blonde hair blowing in the wind.  Hell, no.  Not unlike Ben's when he's in an airlocked room.  I think a lot of the fraternities, you know, they had their brothers paddling pledges while  they were in their underwear, just like the scene in Animal House.  I'm like, what is this about?  I just want to drink a few beers from a keg and bang some broads. 
[02:58:30]  Why am I bending over and getting paddled by you?  This goes with what I was saying earlier.  A guy that, if you go to school and you don't want to be in a fraternity, that's fine.  It seems that the fraternities would draw in guys that want to be with other guys in  these living situations where perhaps things can happen and there's excuses for nudity  and paddling and it seems like a very...  I have to step in. 
[02:59:00]  No way.  I mean, the pledging, yes.  You're right.  The pledging was weird, man.  I mean, we were naked.  We were naked.  See?  That's all I'm saying.  Then you become a brother and then it's all about just banging chicks and getting hammered  and it's one big party.  Like, all of a sudden, all that goes away as far as the fraternity I joined.  It's always there, though.  But it was weird, man.  But it was there in the first place.  It had to come from somewhere.  That's right.  That ain't going away.  I'm glad your friend's dead.  I know.  How do we even continue this break after that? 
[02:59:30]  That's on my Animal House line.  It's one of my favorite movies, bastard.  Dude, we had to do some weird shit.  You pledged.  Now, what did you have to do?  Well, we got paddled.  Paddled.  See, right there.  A man paddling another man's ass.  Got paddled.  What is the...  Was it on your bare behinds?  Do you have your underscores?  Come on.  You remember.  Be honest.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, like it's cool because I had my underwear on? 
[03:00:00]  Let me tell you something.  Listen, there's underwear on paddling, which isn't very much cooler than underwear off,  but off is really, really bad.  Both are really bad.  I think it was just underwear on.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you sure you don't want to say something?  I'll tell you one story, you guys.  Go on.  I shouldn't say you'll laugh because then I'm expecting you to laugh.  Right, right.  But I have enough confidence in what I'm about to tell you.  All right. 
[03:00:30]  There was something during Hell Night.  Well, hmm.  Uh-oh.  It was kind of like an obstacle course around the house.  Oh, a little obstacle course.  And this is the opening act.  Don't laugh at this one unless you think it's funny.  We were blindfolded with tampons because that's the cool thing to do.  How do you blindfold with tampons?  One on each eye maybe?  I don't know.  Big freaking pads.  Oh, a pad.  A Kotex pad.  Whatever, like I know. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, the tampons are the ones that slide in with the string.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, the pads, whatever.  They catch the blood before it actually stains the clothing.  They make good blindfolds, though.  I guess.  Yeah, thick.  Sure.  And then one stop was the bathroom.  And the brothers yelling and screaming that there was a big, fat Eggo pig that took a dump in the toilet.  And everyone was outraged at this big, fat Eggo pig from the sorority.  Eggo?  Eggo, one of the sororities, took a dump in the fraternity bathroom. 
[03:01:30]  And we had to get rid of that.  We had to get rid of that shit.  As in, take your hands and get a good one.  Wait, wait, wait.  You had to pull human feces out of a toilet bowl.  Because they were pissed that the big, fat Eggo pig took a crap in our toilet.  Now, let me tell you something.  I'm thinking here.  I don't think it was one of those girls that took a dump in that toilet.  I think it was your fraternity brother's crap. 
[03:02:00]  We were told later that it was bananas.  What was the test?  The water was cold?  Look at Jim.  Wow.  Where do I join?  Oh, you were told later it was bananas?  Yeah.  Well, did your hand smell like bananas or shit?  I don't remember.  Kind of an easy, not to be Columbo.  I don't remember.  I was smelling bananas.  But my hands were covered in shit.  I don't remember.  You don't remember.  And then one of the grand finales was that we had a... 
[03:02:30]  Look at how you...  He's looking off into the distance in the air because he doesn't want to make eye contact  and chuckling, thinking back at this stuff.  Because this was pretty gay.  We had a play.  Yeah.  Was there a porch involved?  By the way, if I tell the story...  Yeah.  I get to slide from reading out of that book the first time I mess up.  Or I don't tell the story. 
[03:03:00]  I thought you were reading out of the book.  I know.  I'm making a deal right now with you.  First time you mess up?  Yeah.  Okay.  You get to slide.  Yeah, because this is brutal.  All right.  All right.  You can tell by how...  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  So we're in our underwear doing the obstacle course around the house with the grand finale  that waited for us in the basement, which was...  I can't give that away.  Right.  Because I'll get killed, so they say.  Oh, wait, wait.  Is it with a secret fraternity you're not allowed to speak at thing? 
[03:03:30]  Well, it's the grand finale, yeah.  Um, we had to play Bomb the DK House, our rival fraternity.  Bomb the DK House.  Which we hated, of course.  Rumor has it that this fine fraternity did some crazy things themselves.  Well, DK was dick kissers, so they sound like a wild bunch.  Well, one of the rumors, I don't know for sure, was that the pledgers had to put, and 
[03:04:00]  this isn't my fraternity, put wax lips on and give oral treats to the brothers.  That's the rumor that was going around when I went to college.  How do you give oral with the wax lips on?  I have no idea.  Yeah, it's got to be a rumor.  Aren't they connected?  Well, some kind of whatever.  Maybe you just rub the lips against the side of the...  Maybe you grab a hold of that thing, you just grab it like it's nobody's business,  and you rub the wax lips.  There you go.  So, bomb the DK House, I guess they had a little house set up, I don't know, because 
[03:04:30]  we were blindfolded, a doll house, and we had to pick up the bombs, not using our hands.  Oh, no.  Oh, my goodness.  What were the bombs made out of?  The bombs, I believe, were marshmallows.  With your ass cheeks?  Holy shit.  I can't even look at you.  I cannot even turn my head and look at you. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Are marshmallows allowed in the barracks?  And then we...  Now, wait.  In order to pick it up with ass cheeks, you can't have been wearing underwear.  Nope.  We, uh...  Yeah, well, they were still on our body, technically.  They were kind of...  Around your ankles as you scurried along.  Squatting, you know, sweating, nervous, trying to fit in, ass-cracked cheeks, opening up,  picking up what is normally a delicious treat. 
[03:05:30]  And then you had to waddle over to the house.  And drop the marshmallow.  Right.  As the fraternity brothers that were in charge of this whole thing went, yeah, you dropped  that marshmallow on that house.  Drop it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then was anything done with the marshmallows?  Who had to clean up the marshmallows?  Who had to pick them up?  I have no idea.  I really don't have an idea.  The pledge didn't have to clean up the marshmallows?  And then, uh, then, you know, then Hell Night was over, and then it got back to... 
[03:06:00]  That's the weird part.  Then it got back to just one big party and banging broads.  How many sorties did you fly over the target?  Dude, it was weird, man.  There was another time...  By the way, from now on, forget the Rent Boy book.  If anyone screws up, they have to read a transcript of that story.  I know.  That's the new punishment.  Open Bombay doors.  Ha ha.  Enola Gay.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, it's awful.  There was another time.  And this was when I was rushing.  Yeah.  This is a legendary story, and the girl never pressed charges, so it's okay. 
[03:06:30]  She actually partied with us the next day.  Pressed charges.  And thought it was actually very cool.  When I was rushing the fraternity, that's where you go to the fraternity houses, and they  try to convince you to pledge their fraternity.  Yeah.  And all the brothers come back from all over the country, you know?  They get away from their wives for a weekend.  Yeah, San Francisco.  No, no, no.  All the country.  Look, I can't.  Key West.  Fire Island.  I can't even fight my way out of that story, so I'll just let you guys be. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Do you ever put them in your ass cheeks and then warm them over a nice campfire, did you?  Or maybe you could squat over my cocoa?  Marshmallow in your ass.  All you need are graham crackers, and you've got s'mores.  Yeah, yeah.  Already got the delicious chocolate coating.  Dude.  I witnessed when I was...  You want to try that with hot dogs?  All right, all right, all right.  Frozen?  All right, relax, Jesus.  Watch it, I'm carrying a bunker buster here.  Look, I share with you guys, and this is what I get. 
[03:07:30]  This is what I get.  I got a banana.  You want to try to pick it up?  Yeah, it was pretty weird.  Just awful.  Yeah, that is a real bad thing.  Was it actually hard getting the marshmallow off the guy's cock head?  He'd bury it in his pubes, you have to go all the way down, grab it, and come back up.  Oh, what a man. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Very funny.  This is, uh...  Oof.  Wow.  Got to remember, though.  I tried to get out of all this, too.  Anyway, so when I was rushing, there was a girl.  They bring the sorority over, and we were having a huge party, and this girl decided that she wanted some bukkake, I guess.  Greg, where are the marshmallows, Greg? 
[03:08:30]  Cindy?  I need those marshmallows, Cindy.  Oh, no, Dad.  There's a lima bean skin on the marshmallow.  Peter?  Come down with those marshmallows, Peter.  That is just an awful thing to have to go through.  It really was. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, Alice, did you go shopping this weekend?  Hope you picked up plenty of marshmallows and got the guys coming over.  We're going to bomb the card house we just built with marshmallows.  Yes, I hope you picked up some of those little hot cocoa marshmallows for Bobby's tight little ass.  I'm going home now. 
[03:09:30]  That's great.  Yeah, I had a waddle.  Someone's asking if I had a waddle.  Cindy!  You left some marshmallow stains on the teeter-totter, teeter-totter.  On the teeter-turner, you asshole.  I knew I went one too far.  What a dick.  You were feeling good about yourself.  On the teeter-turner.  How about Greg?  That's not a marshmallow.  That's Oliver's nose.  Very good. 
[03:10:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Marshmallows.  You bomb a house.  What's the big deal?  You pick it up and then you have a waddle across the...  Hey, ask a question.  You waddle.  It looks funny.  You're walking funny.  I understand.  Do you ever get a ride watching the end of Ghostbusters?  This is coming from the Monster Rain guys. 
[03:10:30]  Who cares?  You're dropping marshmallows, dropping T-cells, whatever.  Marshmallow rain.  Well, anyway, the other story's not as good.  Well, it is good, but no one's going to remember the other story when they're thinking about  this show later.  But this girl had no problem being trained by the whole fraternity. 
[03:11:00]  Not the whole fraternity.  Trained?  Yeah.  During rushing.  The old one guy goes, the next guy goes, the next guy.  A gangbang.  But only it's all not at the same time.  It's not in a single file.  I remember, like it was yesterday, there was a keg outside the room, and the brothers  all lined up with just their underwear on and took turns.  And there was a long line all the way down the hall.  Hey, how about that?  I didn't partake, by the way. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, you didn't?  No.  Why not?  Were there any condoms being used?  Were you on your stomach with a line at your door?  No.  Shut up, you ass.  No, I mean, wow.  They pounded it so hard, it looked like it was whipped cream in your ass.  They churned that marshmallow into butter.  I'm turning your mic off.  I have that power, you know.  You're done. 
[03:12:00]  Just a slice of bread, and you got to fluff another.  You're done.  I'm turning my mic off.  I'm turning you off.  I can't take any more.  Jimmy's very entertaining today.  All right.  All right, well.  Now, there was so much splooge on her, it wasn't even funny.  I guess.  Because they weren't nice about it, either.  No.  Someone sent in, hey, who was the president of your fraternity?  Jim McGreevy? 
[03:12:30]  That was fat Phil from New Jersey.  Oh, I mean, excuse me.  Here's a...  I'm a proud marshmallow-carrying American.  Oh, I admit during my term as governor, I carried marshmallows.  Wow, well, you know something? 
[03:13:00]  Bravo, Opie, for, you know, opening up, well...  Only one drop time.  Only one over the primary target.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that is, you know, to admit that is...  But it was many years ago.  Yeah, he didn't know any better.  Of course not.  No.  Marshmallow.  Bombing run on the little house.  Yeah, you can't really defend that one.  No, I'm not.  No, it's not wrong with that. 
[03:13:30]  I figured I'd share, though.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony!  What's up, fellas?  Hey, how are you, man?  Hey, Opie.  We share a common thread.  Yeah?  We both had Coach write us papers in Geneseo.  Oh, right on, man.  Almost got me kicked out of school.  Let me ask you a question.  How did you share a thread?  Did you put Rice Krispies on your dick and meet up with Opie and make Rice Krispies treats?  All right, all right, all right.  You know what?  I was in a different fraternity.  Our fraternities hung out.  We didn't do any of that kind of stuff. 
[03:14:00]  But...  What fraternity were you in?  Sig Tau.  Sig Tau?  Yeah, those guys were...  I played...  I spent many a night at your fraternity playing whale's tales in the basement, Opie.  How cool were the parties, though?  Oh, the parties...  The parties were...  I tell you what, pledging was the worst thing I've ever done over a span of five weeks.  Goes in a marshmallow, comes out a Malamar.  Once you're done, though, it's the best thing.  Then the parties are rocking.  The parties are rocking.  It was just...  I'm not going to lie.  It was, like, really strange. 
[03:14:30]  It was bizarre that you go down that road just so you could...  The old dirt road.  Yeah, no shit.  Get on that, High Leck.  Opie's fraternity, at least when I was there a couple years after you, was certainly not a drug-free fraternity.  Oh, man, we were...  They were smoking poles.  No, no, these guys were hardcore.  Those guys had connections to South America out of there.  No, there was...  Wow.  There was major...  Drug fiends, huh?  Major cocaine going through that fraternity.  I had a friend that... 
[03:15:00]  Well, sure, they're also good at smuggling it.  You're going to attempt a kilo?  Yeah.  You squat over Columbia.  You come back up.  Pick up a plant.  You know what, Plain?  But I got a good...  Well, I got a bad story to tell you.  It's an unfunny story.  I'll try to lower the expectations.  Very good.  One thing that we had to go through was, you know, they blindfold you, throw...  We had about 18 guys we pledged with, they throw, like, three each in a car, you know, 
[03:15:30]  blindfold you.  This is about, like, midnight, and it's, you know, below zero up there, and they drop  you off, like, 30 miles away from...  Oh, wait a minute.  I got to jump in.  That was another thing we did.  They would get you really wasted, making believe, you know, you were taking a break from  pledging, and...  Oh, yeah, you're one of the guys hanging out.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's what it was.  It's all about that.  It's like, you know, they abuse you like crazy, and then also when you think there's more  abuse, then they throw you a party, and sometimes they invite the sororities, but then sometimes 
[03:16:00]  these parties were a setup, and what they do is they get you really wasted, man, and,  you know, you're smoking pot, and you're drinking.  Next thing you know, they completely attack you, tie you up, put a blindfold on you, and  throw you in cars.  Ooh.  And depending on how much they liked you or didn't like you, they would drop you off  in the middle of nowhere.  In Geneseo, man, it's all farms.  All farms.  I mean, you can't figure it out. 
[03:16:30]  And they would just drop you off in the middle of a field.  You're complete...  I'm telling you...  Were you naked, or...?  No, no, no, no.  You're completely hammered, to the point you can't really even, like, stand some of these  guys.  Mm-hmm.  And they would drop you off with another guy or maybe two other guys, and then you  had to find your way home.  Only a marshmallow to eat for the whole way back.  Right, right.  No money, nothing.  And some of these guys would be dropped off in Canada.  Really?  Yeah, because this guy's saying 30 miles.  Our fraternity...  No, there were some pledges that the brothers just hated, and they would drop them off over 
[03:17:00]  the border in Canada.  Which, do the math, I don't know, at least a couple hundred miles, right?  Oh, yeah, at least a hundred miles.  At least a hundred miles away.  Right, and then, you know, all night long, they're trying to get back to, you know, the  school.  Brother Flounder and Brother Pinto.  So, go ahead.  Long walk back.  Anthony, go ahead.  No, well, you know, and getting dropped off up there is not like getting dropped off on  Jericho Turnpike back on the island.  That's right.  That's what I said.  I mean, it's all farms, so you're waiting for that one truck, hopefully, to be, you 
[03:17:30]  know, driving down that old country road.  And they tell you, they tell you, you know, they gave us each, like, a six-pack and some  joints.  And the deal is, you know, you're supposed to bond and use each other to find your way  back.  They're like, you're not supposed to ask any for any help.  It's about two in the morning, and I say, enough is enough.  I'm going, and I'm knocking on this door.  It was a big farm, but it was a house.  So, I go and knock on the door about two in the morning.  The dogs start barking.  The lights come on.  The kids, you know, so the guy finally comes downstairs. 
[03:18:00]  I apologize for waking him up and all, but I go, I just need directions back to Geneseo.  He looks at me, and the two guys standing in the street, and he goes, well, where's  your car?  And I said, we're on foot.  He just shook his head.  He knew it was a fraternity thing and just said, boy, there's no way you're going to  make it back.  So, we made it back finally about seven in the morning.  But I would say at least three or four guys had to go to the infirmary with frostbite  and things like that.  Nice.  There you go, frostbite.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Good stuff you can laugh about now. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  Uh, Opie, the grand finale.  Yeah.  Was it the cum cookie?  Oof.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Come on.  Put it in the middle.  No, nothing like that.  The cum cookie.  The cum cookie.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jim from Long Island, what's up?  What's up?  What a doodle. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, what's up, Jim?  I went to school up in Potsdam, and I de-pledged.  It was the best thing I ever did.  Yeah.  Did you have to do any of this weird gay crap?  I started getting into it, and then that's when I left.  The semester I de-pledged.  Someone in the other school in town died.  And then later on, I went to move to the house with my friends.  We had better parties than the fraternities.  All right.  How did he die?  He had so many marshmallows in his ass, they began to leak into his brain.  You're obsessed with his marshmallows, then. 
[03:19:30]  Instead of sugar poisoning.  So anyway, this pledge tells a vicious beating, Anthony.  The victim of a twisted hazing ritual told a Queens jury yesterday,  he urinated blood and suffered seizures after three members of a St. John's frat  pummeled him on the buttocks with a two-pound paddle.  Once again, with the paddle.  Paddling an ass.  The beatings were punishment for slip-ups during hardcore drill sessions  in an off-campus park, said Brian.  We had to recite history, poems, and if we were incorrect or we messed up, we'd get paddled.  If you bobbled your words when you spoke, if you recited a poem wrong, history wrong, 
[03:20:00]  or answered a question wrong, you got hit.  Oh, my God.  You bobble your words?  Imagine if Colin's ass would look like chopped meat.  Colin Quinn?  Yeah.  The three face up to seven years in prison for the assaults, which allegedly took place in June.  This fraternity has a policy that forbids hazing, Anthony.  It's still going on, though.  They have to tell the campus that, oh, no, our fraternity doesn't do the hazing.  And, yeah, he was in the hospital for like three months with all sorts of kidney problems 
[03:20:30]  and urinating blood and all that.  Yeah, if you're not doing something that's extremely gay,  you're doing something that could probably kill somebody or send them to the hospital.  He's getting paddled.  Getting paddled is gayer than the marshmallow thing is really humiliating and silly.  Gay.  Well, you could call it silly.  That's one word.  Dude.  Gay.  I wasn't naked naked.  You picked them up with your ass cheeks.  It didn't mosey its way into your underwear.  No, I had like this and then this. 
[03:21:00]  That's awful.  And this.  Oh.  Because your mule wasn't showing.  No.  Because you had just slipped a little, the boyish stain with mule sweat.  Your yam bag was bouncing off the marshmallow as you're just kind of bunny hopping.  With your socks and sneakers.  A marshmallow.  Marshmallow hanging.  Ugh.  Did you get caught up in hair?  Something?  A little sticky?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Would you do that?  Ant?  I would so not even be within a hundred mile blast radius of whatever was going on at 
[03:21:30]  a fraternity.  This was a different.  There's no way I would do anything like that again.  It was a different time.  It was.  I don't know.  What time was it?  It was.  I don't know.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's fucking stupid.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's not just for you.

It's not funny.  Takes a long time to iron a shirt with that tiny little iron.  It's so hot.  I had that game Operation.  Remember the game Operation?  Big naked white guy. 
[03:25:00]  He had no pee-pee at all.  He had no scum-diddly-umptious.  He had no cash and prizes.  He was like that guy from the movie Silence of the Lambs.  Remember?  He tucked it in.  Put the lotion in the basket.  Put the lotion in the basket! 
[03:25:30]  You're laughing because you've done it, you freak.  You're a freak.  You're a freak.  I used to do it.  I used to come out of my girlfriend's bathroom naked.  I'd be like, look, I'm just like you.  I was always afraid, like, one time she'd be like, oh yeah?  I'm just like you!  I'm just like you!  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show,  and I hope you're enjoying it, 
[03:26:00]  and I hope you're laughing because that's our goal.  If we can just put a smile on the face of one retarded child.

[03:29:00]  perfect opportunity it was a block away we had a live film crew yeah you get the job done i was  screening calls before i heard everything go on and then when i turned around mike was already going so i  just went okay mike's going with the signs boy and he walked out i will go next time he didn't  even know that there was a live shot he didn't even know that they went live  yeah completely it was on it was it was there we're going go go go go go where he's out of 
[03:29:30]  panicking i just got nervous i think he panicked i think he panicked i think he panicked and didn't  want to be the guy some people have it some people don't i told you guys can this guy handle it i  knew that the guy couldn't handle it and i'm waiting for you guys to step up and take care  of business no you know what it is the kid's been going out for the past three days doing this stuff  so we i'm assuming that he's doing what stuff he was outside of the today show yesterday and did he  get on tv said they panned to him i don't know if they uh what i don't know no no probably no if he 
[03:30:00]  got on the today show with one of our signs i think we would have heard by now usually when  something like that happens our email explodes hundreds of emails holy shit did you see the today show  this morning guys just in case you did it jesus dude all right well we don't send him out anymore  eric you should i want his d-o-r why didn't you go eric you're the man okay i'll go next time no  there is no next time that's right hawk yeah there's gonna be a next time where uh a news crew is gonna  be a block away from where we're broadcasting from yeah there'll be a next time a block away 
[03:30:30]  someone kill a homeless person outside the studio so they'll be right in front of the the station next  time there you go we could start making news oh god that was a great opportunity missed he was  there he had the signs they went live what happened we're screaming go go go go go go and  was he on a cell phone or no he was on hold he could hear us oh brother they went live they went  live they went live for a while he missed the fact that they even went live i know i think he saw 
[03:31:00]  i just got too nervous i think he just hid shivering with his signs across the street and he goes i'm  across the street across the street you got to be right there waiting to just run into the camera  why he didn't want to jaywalk someone that works for the show has horrendous judgment  hmm who is that i don't know but it seems like it's one of these three  could it be ben could it be steve could it be eric or could it be all three yes i knew he was the 
[03:31:30]  wrong kid i don't know why you'd want to send him one block away live shot right there he was  there with the signs somehow he didn't get on he's the shyest kid in the whole building yeah  he barely talks he might be a good kid and works hard but he's really dude what happened  what what happened i was across the street i guess i didn't have the right vantage point i missed  them the right vantage point what i think i know look at him i drove past that news truck 
[03:32:00]  on my way in yeah if you were across the street wasn't the truck itself blocking the view of the  guy no you saw the guy i was across the street on still on 57th i think the guy was in front of  pick a bagel or uh one of those little bagel stands no no no no that's across the street yeah he  was like right in front of duane reed you know i was a i was on the other side but i guess he was  in my blind spot your blind spot we've speeding by him i'll stand in on the subway mirrors on your 
[03:32:30]  hat oh my god yeah because he went live for there was plenty of time to get did he hear us yelling go  go go yeah but i i didn't know what that was uh if that was to me no they told me to hold on so i was  holding i didn't know he's going you heard us saying go go go he's screaming over the song  but i didn't know that was to me who else are we yelling go yeah we're not fucking each other 
[03:33:00]  you are a pisser i love this  i'm not even mad anymore because this is so stupid  what do you what do you think i was referring to with go go go  i didn't have my mind so i couldn't hear  what i didn't have my my fi on so i didn't know what the show was doing  well the show what the show was doing was going to you live so you could be on live tv  yeah go go go if you it wasn't say you're standing in front of a news shot and you have 
[03:33:30]  signs and you're waiting for the live shot and you're on hold on the on the phone and you hear  the hosts of the program yell go go go you could probably assume we're talking to you well all right  i was standing across from the van i did not see the cameraman come out of the van and i was  watching the van completely i saw the light come on in the van that's when i called in the show 
[03:34:00]  and then i hear go go go well it wasn't me looking at anthony as he's deep throating his huge banana  go go suck it suck that banana down no i thought you were saying no no no we're slow slow  blow blow blow well there all is your crow do they do they take off yeah they started cleaning  up as soon as uh i hung up as soon as you missed the shot yes sir yeah what do you think though when 
[03:34:30]  the big light lights came on what did you think it was a night game what did you think yeah cleaning  up or something because when those lights come on that means live shot and then when we yell go  it means go i can't even go we thought you might have panicked like you might have seen  come on and gotten a little nervous did you did you think i can't do this this is my last minute  and i blew it yeah i don't think i don't think you'll be getting a second try at this no we'll 
[03:35:00]  find something else for you to do i think coffee runs pretty much yeah yeah wow but steve said is saying  that you've been out there for three days with signs yeah i went down uh to rockefeller yesterday  they didn't go to my section of the crowd though well wouldn't you like move yourself to where  they're going like one segment so oh they only went to the crowd once when i was there steve's hero  yeah steve has a lot of confidence in you though not anymore oh no i'm sorry why would you um 
[03:35:30]  did you did have confidence in him i did he seemed uh he said he was on the at the uh today show  yesterday and well what what i can't hear you wow i had hat and no headphones  oh all right so you have no confidence in the guy now uh sorry mike you're you're you're back to  getting coffee why wouldn't you guys send eric i don't get it yeah what why why not send a proven 
[03:36:00]  guy uh i want to play to it  yes steve so who made that i don't know i actually think it was drew boogie oh thanks 
[03:36:30]  drew does a great job for the radio program thanks drew another thing to be thrown at me  while i'm trying to speak great uh all right from now on uh eric will now do these things but  these opportunities don't come along i understand that well look there's going to be a bunch today  how how far away do we want to send uh young eric why would there be a bunch today something  going on uh there's giant stadium not giant there's janky stadium there's uh something there's  something going on at 27th and broadway yeah i saw that shot but they're apparently they're 
[03:37:00]  they're there for a while how far away do we want to send this guy 27th like 30 blocks how far do we  want to send them a block yeah that was a great opportunity now now now that the the block opportunity  has uh gone do we want to send them that far away i i don't even want to send them to starbucks  across the street why don't we do this is right can we afford to send two people out  with two two different locations we do have two lovely signs although you'd have to cover them  somehow you couldn't put them face to face like he had them yeah i don't know that's kind of 
[03:37:30]  depressing that we missed that one man it was right it was right there right there that was the one  you don't get the pitch like that every uh every time all right oh there he goes skulking  man you guys got to figure it out i don't know why you would send him it was when you have eric and  other people freak you know you know honestly it's what about danny it seems so painfully brain 
[03:38:00]  dead i took i took for granted the fact that the kid might get scared he might not know what was up  so all right bian anthony xm202 we're in break and and norton just casually mentions that uh him him  and mike tyson once made out with the same trainee trainee tranny no jack crawford sent a tranny to me  a tranny trainee yeah how did that happen uh at the porn award last year oh that would wear it  i was at the expo well you were you were we were talking about tyson because there's a story in the 
[03:38:30]  paper and and uh you know we asked norton if you ever got a picture with uh tyson and you said yes  i met him twice he's been very nice to me both times and then you got video of him well yeah i have  to hear from yo she's got it uh i i think yeah i may have said it to me oh yeah video of me and tyson  talking and then uh i i this transsexual named vanity who's a porn star um was gonna be my date  for the it was a goof and yeah it's a goof yeah there's a little vanity kiss me and you know  whatever it was on film it was in front of 50 people what kind of kiss like a nice friendly one 
[03:39:00]  was it an open mouth i don't think so but oh what do you mean you don't think so that means it was  no no i'll tell you the truth if i get the video i don't remember oh but then i don't think so means  i think they got on videotape so i better just uh no no okay and you knew it was a tranny no i kind  of suspected no not kind of i i didn't have confirmation you knew and it was a french kiss  no i didn't i didn't have confirmation until after um no i didn't do that no but uh tyson the next day 
[03:39:30]  was uh mugging with uh vanity as well really yeah and um it's on video so he oh you you kissed  it first he basically kissed my girl oh hey you take your goddamn hands off her  unhand that parental disappointment when you got video of uh tyson doing this yeah i think  oh she has it i'm almost positive yeah wow yeah i can remember him telling me about it and i think 
[03:40:00]  i've seen the video i'll just i'll call him today and ask him but that would be very nice for  and mike was talking to you on the video he's he's actually speaking well he he did the energy  this guy walks around with is it's a whirlwind i was in the evil angel booth with like joey silver  and all those guys and uh butt man butt man oh man wow buddy um and tyson walks in and him and 50  cent were at the expo and so there's a massive amount of people yoshi actually called my room he's  like dude mike tyson's around so i came down grabbed your camera and ran out that i did and i don't know 
[03:40:30]  how yoshi gets near these people but he did and he got mike tyson to come into the the little area  we were hanging out in so tyson comes in and we're and he's spanking chicks in front of everybody it's  on that big mitt he was and he was like just talking and yoshi somehow said this is jim norton  from comedy central he's co-hosting the award show so tyson puts his arm around me and he's like uh  yeah i'm with jim norton from comedy central and he's just talking and he keeps telling me to talk  about him at the award show i'm gonna ass rape you you little man oh i thought you guys the whole 
[03:41:00]  time i'm like how fucking great would this be on the air unfortunately we're off i'm gonna titty screw  you come here this might hurt when i flop it out on your chest because it's merely huge  it's merely gigantic you're gonna love it you're used to having logs on your chest try this one it's a  whole tree trunk wow put his arm around you was it heavy um it's just a yeah he's a fucking man's 
[03:41:30]  man yeah you just he's got an energy with him man that is just really intimidating he's a very  intimidating guy obviously what did you find him to be bright or well i didn't agree with his physics  theories we we parted uh ways on certain um right you know quasar uh light emission theories but  he was actually very nice to me uh again i guess if you hang out with him and he doesn't punch you  in the face or fuck your mouth you can put it in the plus column that don't leave many people 
[03:42:00]  let me tell you yeah the story in the paper uh this is how bright mike is he goes to a party  uh because he's you know socialite and he had no idea what was going on  he goes to a party uh the boxer told organizers that carmen electra had said to meet her at the  museum but she stood him up didn't uh didn't show up the burly boxer paid a surprise visit to the 
[03:42:30]  guggenheim while the glamorous christian dior artist's ball was in full swing imagine you having  your christian dior artist ball at the guggenheim and this animal walks through the door my god  somebody's open the gate to the zoo uh he was quoted as saying dior is that a deodorant  a clearly confused tyson asked when a reporter asked what he was wearing once the reporter explained 
[03:43:00]  it was a a uh fashion house tyson said oh i'm wearing versace when his clothes were clearly labeled  rockaware how do you spell versace all c-a-w-e-a-r versace but the elegant dior dior clad socialites  were thrilled to see tyson no matter what posing for pictures that's what happens these people like 
[03:43:30]  oh it's like when uh it's like when all the photographers came and i want to get a picture  of kong let me get up there put the girl in front of kong you know all the socialites like that kind  of thing take a picture of me with this beast and they did heather graham was there i guess  roller girl josh lucas yes christina ricci and her head her huge forehead  i'd like to punch her in the forehead it's as big as my fist so he didn't even know where he was 
[03:44:00]  christian dior let's go to the phones talk to chris in new york hey chris what's up  yo guys hey how much longer you're gonna put up with this fucking holo you're sitting next to here  every day oh no every day norton gets fucking more faggy what kind of language is that to use on the  radio show sir bro what's up man every day you're doing something more gay so that was a year ago  dude he's not gay he's not gay because it was a year ago that's right  don't suck another second grade dick norton i'm out of here wait sir ouch wait mister 
[03:44:30]  it was uncalled for that certainly was harsh talk jimmy you do have a lot of faggy stories i gotta  admit well who doesn't but you knew the guy the guy was a guy that's a chick man that's a little  odd dude you look at her she's like she's a chick no but she has a dick you know but i didn't see  that it's a chick when you use i'll show you a picture of her and you go okay you know something  there is not one tranny that i've ever looked at and not known it was a tranny um i've never seen 
[03:45:00]  one that didn't have that telltale little how you doing the voice the adam's apple or the dead  giveaway the hands i was so paranoid in brazil about that because that's where the operations are  very good oh yeah then i passed up patrice told me i was crazy he's like that's not an x guy but i  was so paranoid about it that there's a lot of hot ones actually walked away from the certain  qualities they had i'm like that's a post-op i'm not remember tula tula tula oh yeah famous sex  change operation uh turned out she was of she he it whatever was a bond girl in james bond movie one 
[03:45:30]  of the like a helicopter pilot or something and uh hot turned out used to be a guy went through the  operation did a spread in playboy and it turned out uh it looked kind of like a real uh vag down there  they did the operation and that's like the only the only one i've ever seen that used to be a guy  that kind of looked like a girl everything else you're like oh so a man hand so is it is a gay if 
[03:46:00]  it used to be a guy but it now has a vag and you have sex i think so no it's all where your heart is  i think it's it's kind of gay you don't just don't and especially it like she would have to  explain it to you before anything happened because afterwards there's a chance somebody kill her how  do you go through that like oh wow i'm really i'm really digging this chick you know have great sex 
[03:46:30]  we need need a lot of ky for some reason but you know her vag feels great it feels exactly like an  inside out penis ah i guess that's what they do right yeah they they uh they gut your schlong  and turn it inside out they don't just lop it off they they remove the testes and then they uh use  the scrote to fashion some kind of labia and then they they gut your schween reroute your urethra 
[03:47:00]  how do you know all this i read a lot and then they they pack ourselves a reader at ourselves a  reader and they pack it inside you and all of a sudden you're uh you got a vag but meanwhile if a  guy is with this person what you're really doing is just rubbing schlongs i've had a couple that were  questionable post obviously with with badges but there was something on that i don't know what it  was a weird vibe and there was no but there was no i was having sex you could actually have sex it
