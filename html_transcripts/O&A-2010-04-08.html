<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a humorous segment about a fictional superhero, "Hoagie Boy," whose priorities were heavily skewed towards hoagies rather than crime-fighting.  This segued into a discussion about a collapsed wall in the hosts' neighborhood, with Opie sharing his initial elation and subsequent disappointment regarding a photo he took of the event. A caller attributed the collapse to water damage.  The conversation then veered towards the flamboyant home run calls of Yankees announcer John Sterling, prompting numerous caller anecdotes about overly-dramatic sports announcers and the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, particularly the unusual scheduling of their season opener.  A lengthy discussion followed on long, uninterrupted camera shots in films like *The Player* and *Pulp Fiction*, with callers offering further examples and the hosts debating the technical and artistic merits of this cinematic technique.  The first half concluded with an extended and highly vulgar discussion of the Tiger Woods scandal, fueled by new reports involving a 21-year-old neighbor, including explicit details and reactions, as well as a mention of a new Nike commercial featuring his father's voice.

The show continued with an even more graphic and sexually explicit discussion of Tiger Woods' infidelity, based on details from the *National Inquirer*, including explicit text messages and the hosts' harsh opinions on the women involved, particularly one named Rachel. The conversation then shifted to the exclusivity and gender dynamics of prestigious golf courses like Augusta National and Pine Valley, with the hosts and callers making numerous sexist and racist remarks about women’s participation. A caller unexpectedly provided the etymology of "fuck," sparking a tangential discussion on word origins.  The topic then turned to diplomatic immunity, following a news story about a Qatari diplomat attempting to light his shoe on fire on a plane. Callers shared anecdotes about diplomats abusing their immunity.  This led to broader discussions about the legal system, plea bargains, and lenient treatment for criminals, using a case involving a man who repeatedly shot into crowds as an example.  The show also briefly mentioned Meat Loaf's upcoming appearance and his new album, "Hang Cool Teddy Bear," including the outlandish speculation that he may have been present during the Kennedy assassination. The segment ended with a discussion about airline fees, particularly Ryanair's proposed lavatory fees, and the state of US income tax.

The next segment opened with the hosts’ highly offensive complaints about their New York state tax burden, transitioning to a discussion about the low cost of airline tickets and subsequent safety concerns.  Listener calls detailed cost-cutting measures by budget airlines.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to graphic descriptions of the hosts' pornography consumption habits, including specific websites and preferences, followed by a discussion of a viral video featuring a man with a bad haircut singing Whitney Houston. The second half of this segment focused on the low-budget television show *PFG TV* hosted by their former colleague, Scorch.  The hosts played audio clips, mocking the show's low production values, awkward interactions, and Scorch's exaggerated claims of success, including a prank involving buttered popcorn in a basketball player's car.  The segment concluded with continued ridicule of *PFG TV*.

The following segment heavily mocked *PFG TV* and Scorch, playing clips and criticizing the poor quality and cringeworthy humor, including a "retard noise." The hosts also discussed finding and filming a toupee, described in offensive terms, and announced Meat Loaf’s impending arrival.  The conversation moved to concert stage shows and props, with the hosts and callers sharing opinions on various acts, including Pink Floyd, U2, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, ZZ Top, and Jamiroquai, offering much derisive commentary.  Meat Loaf then joined the show, discussing his new album, "Hang Cool Teddy Bear," describing it as a concept album about a soldier and detailing his creative process. He recounted his presence near the Kennedy assassination site, his interactions with Secret Service, and his feelings about the event.

The final segment featured Meat Loaf discussing the challenges of portraying emotion truthfully in acting and singing, using an anecdote about accidentally running over his cat. He compared this to the work of Marlon Brando.  He discussed his role in *Fight Club*, including a cut nine-minute scene and the weight of the prosthetic breasts he wore, and shared anecdotes about filming with Brad Pitt, including alcohol consumption and playing cards.  The conversation included a discussion about a rumor involving Phil Rizzuto misunderstanding a song's lyrics and the spread of misinformation online.  The segment concluded with the playing of Meat Loaf's new single, "Los Angeles Loser," and a humorous poem dedicated to the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, what's up? It's Sam. Hey, it's E-Rock. Hey, Hoagie Boy. That's, oh yeah, that's me.  It's the debut of Hoagie Boy. Yes. Right here on the Hoagie Boy channel.  XM Hoagie 02, Sirius 1 Hoagie 7. Let's do line of the day.  I'm seeing, I'm seeing.  Who did that? Stop it. Who did it?  What do you think?  E-Rock. Oh, E-Rock.  Was it you, E-Rock?  Here's line of the day. Oh, let me do it without the theme song. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, come on.  And then try to just clumsily fall into the theme song.  Like, maybe they won't notice that E-Rock made a mistake.  I bet he's holding a Hoagie in each hand. He's doing all the buttons with his feet.  Might be more efficient if he did.  E-Rock, comment.  Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie.  He probably wanted to be a superhero when Batman's insisted he's Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy.  He has a giant cape napkin around his back.  And he always gets fucking mayo and sauces on his little uniform. 
[00:01:00]  Batman says, Hoagie Boy, go wash your greasy hands.  While he's arresting the Riddler and the Joker, Hoagie Boy's in the restroom because his tummy doesn't feel well.  Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy.  Like, he shits pure liverwurst.  Fucking Hoagie Boy is a fucking valueless piss bag.  Hoagie Boy is such a douche.  I know.  Hoagie Boy. 
[00:01:30]  And he just walks into the room slowly with two Hoagies in his hand.  And he takes a bite out of each one while a crime's being committed.  Just watches the crooks.  He helps no one.  But if you're running away, he'll throw the Hoagie at you and trip you up and then pick it up and put it together and eat it.  As the guy gets up and runs away again.  Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy.  And some woman is being fucking, she's being raped with a cheerleading baton and he's just taking a bite out of a fucking, out of a sub sandwich.  And just looking around.  Yeah.  Can't really, he doesn't even really look at the crime. 
[00:02:00]  He hears us screaming for help.  Yeah, he has a piece of tomato hanging out of his mouth.  Pocket full of chips.  A cruncher, cruncher, cruncher, cruncher.  A cruncher, cruncher, cruncher, cruncher.  Hoagie Boy's big thing is to try to get someone to pull down his superhero pants so he can shit while eating Hoagies.  Because whenever he puts his thumbs to pull his pants down, he drops some Hoagie on the bathroom floor.  That's how you know he's been there.  And you gotta have his theme music. 
[00:02:30]  Dum, dum, dum.  He's a dum, dum.  Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.  He has like a little mask with a fucking, a hat with a little propeller.  But it's not a propeller.  It's a small Hoagie.  Spinning in circles.  Upon closer inspection, it is a small Hoagie.  Yeah, a propeller hat.  Everything's Hoagies with this kid.  His boots are painted like two Hoagies.  Two Hoagies on his feet.  His Hoagie boots.  Where's my Hoagie slippers?  He puts his feet in their actual Hoagies that he's taped up. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  He drives a Hoagiemobile.  That's right.  It's got like lettuce spilling out of the trunk.  He's not allowed into the halls of justice because a lot of times he liquid shits down his legs.  Superman slips in it.  Gets all mad.  And gets paralyzed.  He's not allowed into the halls of justice because a lot of times he liquid shits down his legs.  That's what really happened.  He slipped in Hoagie boys' liquid shit in the League of Justice.  The O.B. and Anthony Show does now. 
[00:03:30]  Previously on ONA.  If you're going to take your family to the Javits Center for the car show, that it's a gang magnet.  You might not want to bump into anyone while you're there.  No, you might not want to step on a toe or look at someone with disrespect.  Or make fun of someone's tooth.  Or the grill.  It's a gang magnet.  It's a gang magnet.  You know how many families go there?  You know how many fathers and sons go there to kind of take a look at some rides?  Go to the car show, son. 
[00:04:00]  See what kind of concept cars there are.  This is going to be fun.  I'm out of touch.  Bodacious tot.  It's not funny or sexy or accurate.  And he can't send you some, uh, gratitude, uh, posies?  Why do they have fucking broad writers in papers?  What are you doing?  They're terrible writers.  You don't like broad writers?  Yeah.  Oh, some posies.  Who the fuck laughs at that?  She wrote posies.  Fucking dumb broad. 
[00:04:30]  You too, boy, if you fuck with me.  The police are gonna have to come and get me.  Off your ass.  That's how I'm going out.  For the punk motherfuckers that are showing out.  Niggas start to rumble.  You want to mumble.  Mix a man, cook them in a pot like gumbo.  Oh, shit.  That's pointed at your ass.  Give it up smooth.  Ain't no telling when I'm down for a gap move.  Keep you dancing.  Crime record like Charles Manson.  AK-47 is the Duke. 
[00:05:00]  What's up?  What are you doing in L.A.?  It's not you.  Why is it so hot?  You're not an L.A. guy.  I'm talking about Stan.  Dude, yes, I'm...  You know what?  I am an L.A. guy kind of now.  Why?  I don't know.  What happened?  I quit smoking.  I woke up every day.  Ran up a canyon.  Ran up canyons?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  It's so weird.  It's so weird.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  Live next.

[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  This old gag.  This old gag.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Opie.  How are you?  Very well.  Good morning, little Jim's Norton's.  Hi.  Daniel.  Daniel.  How are you?  We're going to be talking to you guys. 
[00:10:30]  Daniel.  How are you?  I haven't seen Jimmy since yesterday.  Did you see the wall that collapsed in our neighborhood?  No.  It's a pretty big fucking deal.  I didn't notice that.  You know, I mean, in New York, is this happening in all the older cities where all of a sudden  just the side of a building comes falling down?  It's all the brickwork?  That does happen in New York every so often.  It seems to happen a lot, right?  Maybe not a lot, but a couple times a year.  This city is old.  Well, in our neighborhood, right across from Jubilee, you know that parking garage there? 
[00:11:00]  Did you say Jubilee?  Jubilee.  The whole wall fell down.  Oh, I know that.  It came tumbling down and shooting across the entire roadway.  Oh, I drove home last night, and the road was closed off.  That's why.  Unbelievable, though.  A lot of suggestions coming in that it was thermite paint.  It was thermite paint.  You could see the charges going off in the wall as it came down.  I did not.  Why does that happen, though? 
[00:11:30]  And I don't want it to happen.  Gravity?  I don't know.  No, really, though.  I mean, do you know anything about construction?  Does water get behind the bricks?  That's a good one, yeah.  And then it starts expanding to the point it can't really hold itself up anymore.  That could happen.  It takes out the whole front layer of the wall.  It usually happens when they're doing construction nearby, but that doesn't look like construction.  That is a brick facade that is on a cement wall, and the brick facade has come loose. 
[00:12:00]  Wait a minute.  I just got excited.  Like, they used my picture all over the internet, because I took that exact same picture, but  it, unfortunately, is somebody else.  Yeah.  Everyone that passed by took that picture.  I just got really excited.  Like, holy crap.  Credit.  One of my pictures was published.  Greg Opie was credited with the picture.  From his Twitter account?  No.  But, ah, man.  I thought I had a good idea taking a picture of the wall that came down, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, apparently, it could have just taken it from the website there. 
[00:12:30]  And I balanced it out perfectly like that, too.  Although, I didn't have the stupid telephone pole in the way.  You've got to do it more on an angle.  I think my picture is better than the one they're using all over the internet.  Other than that.  Although, the pole gives a little depth to it, Opie.  Does it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little foreground.  Fuck, does it?  Yeah, yeah.  And they have more fire guys, firemen in the picture.  I chose to go with just two guys checking it out. 
[00:13:00]  You were basically just getting the broken wall.  That's what you wanted to really focus on.  I guess this guy's picture definitely tells more of a story than mine.  Yeah, a little bit.  You've got a guy in a suit going, what the fuck is going on here?  Guy in the middle saying, what the fuck you want from me?  You've got five or six firemen to the left going, holy shit, what the hell did we do?  Then you've got the two firemen to the right.  Those guys are obviously more important because they're closer to the wall.  And they're pointing at the wall and saying, hey, that fell down.  Oh, where's your picture?  Which one is Opie's?  Well, mine's good. 
[00:13:30]  I want to see the difference.  Mine's good.  This one is good.  Mine's good.  Yours may capture something that one doesn't.  That's true.  We should compare.  Go down like three, I think, on my Twitter.  We should compare.  Opie radio.  There you go.  Here's my plug for today.  There.  Let's go.  Oh, okay.  It's almost the same picture.  You're over a little further to the left.  There's one fireman.  No, two firemen.  They're removing the crime scene tape.  Well, the crime scene tape is up in the air, though.  It's like, what?  Is mine better than that?  Here's the difference. 
[00:14:00]  He got Ruby shooting Oswald.  You got Oswald ten minutes earlier having a sip of water at the fountain.  Are you trying to say the one they're using definitely tells more of a story?  There's a little more action going on in their picture than yours is what I'm seeing there.  It's a very similar shot, though, you must admit.  Yeah, you're stepped a little off to the left, and there's a lot less going on.  Yeah, all right.  Well, but I captured the real moment because there was nothing going on. 
[00:14:30]  A wall collapsed and no one knows what to do.  Well, that's true because right after it collapsed, I don't think all those firemen were there.  Yeah.  It's just a collapsed wall.  God, what if I was out there with my HD flipped at the exact moment?  Oh, see.  You just had a wall coming down.  I would have thought it was a whole Humpty Dumpty thing.  Well, Pat from Minocchi made a few of those jokes on Twitter last night.  I had a good time.  I had a good time.  All right. 
[00:15:00]  Well, we're going to learn about this.  Ed in Philly.  Ed?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Brick acts like a sponge.  It soaks up water, and over time, it soaks it up completely, gets into the grout, and breaks apart the brick.  So with all the rain, you're saying that the integrity of the wall was compromised.  Yep.  This wall was only maybe two stories, maybe, maybe a little less than that.  It gets scary when it's like a 10-story building, and the whole side falls off. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  I would imagine when they build buildings today, that just can't happen anymore, right?  Someone has figured out that we've got to build this better so the wall doesn't peel away.  They don't use a lot of brick anymore.  It's all like glass now.  Those are glass-sided buildings and shit like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Big blocks.  That building looked old.  It's not even a building.  It was like a side of a parking garage that's built into a hill or something. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  It's all man-made.  Well, thank God no one was hurt.  Who knows?  Thank God.  Maybe somebody's under the rubble.  It's kind of a small pile of rubble to be under.  You can just kind of toss it off of you and go, wipe yourself off and pick up your briefcase,  trot off to work.  Just move on.  A wall fell on me today, guys.  Water cooler talk.  Good point.  Good point.  So, I'm not a Yankees fan, but man, it's been brought to my attention by half the staff, 
[00:16:30]  Anthony, people on Twitter, people on the phones, that we must play the John Sterling home run  call from yesterday.  Yes.  Now, Mr. Granderson.  Now, we're making this very local, but we do have a sports announcer here, a baseball  announcer that's really, he could be really good, but he's very douchey with his home run calls.  Douchey doesn't even cover it.  And I guess I'm going to.  Embarrassing.  I want to throw this out there because I want to know if there's anybody else out there doing  douchey home run calls in your city or your town. 
[00:17:00]  I don't care if it's minor league baseball.  I don't think anyone is as bad as John Sterling.  I defy you to find anybody announcing that is worse than John Sterling when somebody hits  a home run.  I mean, like Jimmy has said in the past, his calls aren't bad.  If he would just stop with the fucking trying to make it about himself when someone hits  a home run and he's got to incorporate the name into some wacky thing he's fucking toiled  over all night long.  He must love the beginning of the season when there's kind of a new roster and he's got 
[00:17:30]  to come up with clever little names for new guys on the team like Granderson, you know?  Granderson doing a little damage against the Red Sox.  It was nice to see.  Now, Granderson's obviously a home run hitter, huh?  Yeah.  He hit, what, 30 home runs with, what was he with?  Who was he with?  He was with Detroit last year.  Yeah, he was with Detroit.  Is he an older guy?  I don't know anything about Granderson.  Nah, he's young.  He'll be around for a while.  But he's always had trouble at Fenway and apparently, you know, two home runs out of 
[00:18:00]  three games.  They took the game last night, which was very nice to see.  Right.  Two out of three for the Yankees against the Sox.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But Sterling's calls, I mean, he's embarrassing.  And, well, Granderson hit one last night.  And who brought up the point?  Was it you that it's the Yankee organization?  I mean, I'm not a fan. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  But I can admit they're a classy organization.  They've been around for a long time and they seem to be a little more classier than most  of the teams out there, right?  I think they like, you know, history and everything else.  They do like publicity, though, the Yankees.  And people do talk about John Sterling, good or bad, they talk about him and how douchey  it is or whatever.  And it's the radio call.  It's not, you know, the television call you're getting on the Yes Network or something. 
[00:19:00]  And I think this is the year where everyone makes fun of John Sterling and his home run  calls.  Oh.  I mean, we've been doing it off and on for a couple of years.  But Spectro in Michigan writes, the Granderson call made Yahoo.  They were trying to figure out what he meant.  Oh, that was the first one.  Yeah, the first time.  And then they figured out it was based on a 1948 musical or something.  Yeah.  Or a Broadway show.  Something sort of Grandish.  He uses that on this one, but he elaborates a little more.  Oh, he goes a little further?  Oh, why wouldn't he? 
[00:19:30]  Let's take a listen.  There'll be an 0-1 to Granderson.  And Papelbaum deals.  Swung on.  There it goes.  Did he write?  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Oh, Curtis.  You're something sort of Grandish.  He drills a long home run to break the tie in the right field seats.  The Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  Curtis Granderson.  Homers to right.  His second is a Yank.  And gives the Yankees a 10th inning 2-1 lead. 
[00:20:00]  Now, as a fan, what does that make you do?  Want to put my fucking head around a shotgun barrel.  What is the real problem with that?  First of all, it's forced.  You can hear how forced it is.  Because he's making what should be a home run call about the team.  About his own cleverness.  And his own cuteness.  And it's not cute.  These are the fucking Yankees.  I don't even like it.  It is high. 
[00:20:30]  It is far.  It is far.  It is far.  It is far.  It is far.  He becomes quickly.  John Sterling has no ability to do anything without being an annoying parody of himself.  Yeah.  It's like, just be genuine.  If it's an exciting home run, call it an exciting home run.  But don't shoehorn your dumb fucking phrases in there.  They're terrible.  They ruin the game for me.  I cannot listen to Sterling.  And I love the way he calls the game.  I don't listen to him.  I love it.  I don't listen to him on, he's on CBS here in New York. 
[00:21:00]  AM.  I don't listen.  No.  I watch the games.  I listen to the clever banter in the booth.  I like the addition of Al Leiter.  I think he's becoming a nice addition to that.  The former Mets pitcher, Al Leiter.  What is he doing?  TV commentary?  Well, yeah.  He's been doing that a few years.  But they goof on him a lot about how rich he is. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just goof on him.  It's kind of funny.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Canada.  Jeff.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  I just wanted to let you know about the Buffalo Sabres TV announcer.  He's got some really crazy fucking calls.  Yeah.  Now, I know he's pretty bad, too.  But this is, we don't feel like doing all the work.  So this is what you guys got to do.  You know, start taping some of this shit.  Then send us some good home run calls.  Or in this case, it's a hockey announcer.  Some douchey calls by your sports announcers. 
[00:22:00]  There's a few up on YouTube.  Have we played the Sabres ones over the years?  Because I know they're really, really bad.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  They are terrible.  All right.  Maybe we'll play one today because we're talking about it again.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  If the boys down the hall can maybe find me one or two fucking Sabres calls, that would be good.  We're looking at John Sterling losing his freaking mind.  When he does the Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Where I used to think he, like, beat his chest. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  But he shakes around.  He looks like a chimpanzee.  And then he looks around for approval.  Did you see that?  Yeah, yeah.  After he's done with his wacky move, then he turns around like, was that good?  Was that good?  You like that, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did good, right?  I don't like that guy.  He's fucking awful.  I don't like him.  It's god-awful.  He's doing, like, the Jersey Shore fist pump, I think.  It's god-awful.  See, now everyone's calling with their sports announcers.  Just fucking, you gotta, give us a link to some audio. 
[00:23:00]  Make it easy for us.  We know they're out there.  I can't wait until the Yankees get a player like Larry Cuntfoot.  And he has to try to make something out of Larry Cuntfoot.  Is he even in their organization?  Yeah, but you spell it with a K.  Yeah.  He's a first baseman.  They're gonna bring him up, though.  Slow runner, for the obvious reasons.  One foot's no good.  It's a cunt.  Yeah, it's good.  His nicknames in high school were Larry Slugtoes.  They felt that was degrading. 
[00:23:30]  Stinkfoot.  Stinkfoot, of course.  Management feet.  I love how you joke, but, man, growing up caddying, I had a caddy for the cunts.  Oh, yeah, right.  They told us it was the cunts.  Cunts.  But it was spelled K-U-N-T.  And just to mix it up a little bit, Z.  You tell me that's not Mr. and Mrs. Cunts.  And was that how it was, like, dished out to you, as far as being a caddy? 
[00:24:00]  It's like, hey, you got the cunts today.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, of course.  And we all made the mistake of going, nice shot, you know, Mrs. Cunts.  I mean Mrs. Cunts.  Mrs. Cunts.  And her name, I swear to you, we probably could look this up somewhere, her first name was Anita.  Anita Cunts, yeah.  And I swear to you, her husband's name was Richard, and I remember that to this day.  Dick Cunts.  Dick Cunts and Anita Cunts.  What a clever little family.  I guess they were French or something.  Let's say hi to Lisa in the Bronx. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  Are you a big Yankees fan?  I love the Yankees, but I love you guys more.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I used to be a hostess in the old stadium, and I met Sterling a couple of times, and he's  just this douchey in person.  And he thought who he was, and he really thought he owned that team, I think.  Yeah, he makes it about himself.  You could tell he probably struts around going, yeah, I'm John Sterling, and I'm the voice 
[00:25:00]  of the Yankees.  He used to look at the girls like, hi, I'm John Sterling.  Like, you know, it was just too funny.  That was, by the way, that was the worst depiction of a guy who's not nice.  He used to look at the girls like, hi, I'm John Sterling.  That's how you should look at somebody.  Wow.  Sam, I love you.  But he had his hands on their tits as he said it.  But she's saying he would come up and introduce himself, hey, I'm John.  What a prick. 
[00:25:30]  It's insufferable.  He was just cocky.  He was, you know.  Yeah.  He's good looking.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  He's a bit full of himself.  So, whatever.  Watch it out.  Love you guys.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Let me say hi to Brendan in Quorum.  Hey, boys.  Hello.  Are you in Quorum, Long Island?  Yeah.  Isn't that a shithole?  It became one.  It used to be nice when I was growing up. 
[00:26:00]  Way downhill.  Are you one of the families that refuse to leave?  Man.  No, I'm getting the hell out.  I'm getting the hell out.  Who's that in the background?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  My babies.  All right, Brian, what do you got?  Uncle Paul.  Brendan.  Did you guys hear Sterling's call Tuesday night, sixth inning with Nick Swisher?  Now I heard, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think we're on the same page.  He fucked it up, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He just borrowed his gun and then called it right back.  He has a really hard time at Fenway.  He's making the calls.  He doesn't.  He has no clue if it's going out, if it's getting caught on the warning track, if it's bouncing  off the monster.  He just has no fucking clue.  So it is high.  It is far.  It is caught.  I can't believe we're talking about baseball already.  Jeez.  Yeah.  That is fucked up.  So the Tigers beat the Red Sox.  Only a few games in, so.  Three, one, and ten.  So what, they take two out of three up there? 
[00:27:00]  Yankees.  Yes.  Yankees took two out of three?  Took two out of three.  Very nice.  Okay.  Considering they, you know, went 0-8 last year against the Sox, it's nice to get that shit  out of the way.  Mm-hmm.  I don't understand, and Eastside Day brought this up on the Ron and Fez show.  How come the Yankees, or the world champion Yankees, had to have their home opener away?  Like their home opener.  I mean, the season opener away. 
[00:27:30]  You answered that, though.  After the show yesterday.  Yeah, you'd think it's like, I was thinking it's probably money, so they could have a  season opener featuring the Yankees, and then a home opener featuring the Yankees.  I think you're onto something.  And it's more profitable.  But you would think that the champs would get to be at home for the opener.  I think the Yankees can, they'll have them open anywhere they think will make them,  like you said, a lot of money.  Anywhere they go, it sells out.  Yeah.  Usually they would have them, I'm surprised they would have them open like in Minnesota.  Maybe for the rest of the season, they want the base. 
[00:28:00]  What am I talking about?  I don't know.  I'm sorry, I have no idea what I'm talking about.  It's all right.  Half the time, we don't know what we're talking about.  I just realized, as I'm talking, I'm thinking, shut the fuck up.  I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm having a season of twins.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right, I'll give it a try.  All right.  I'll give it a try.  You got this Yankees-Red Sox rivalry.  Yeah.  Why waste one of them to start the season?  Well, it's sort of the big opening, you know. 
[00:28:30]  But why not let the season develop just a little bit?  I mean, like maybe a month in and all of a sudden, then you get a little, you're looking  at the calendar going, okay, here we go.  The first fucking Red Sox-Yankees series of the year.  But right off the bat, boom, here it is.  Yeah.  I think you got to hold that one back a little bit.  They want the initial excitement.  But the initial excitement is that baseball.  They're going to play a few more times again, so it doesn't matter.  But I think the initial excitement is the fact that baseball is back.  So you can play anybody in the beginning of the year, and people are just going to be  excited in general because everyone has the same record, too. 
[00:29:00]  And then you get a little Red Sox-Yankees thing happening.  I think it's like the big action sequence at the beginning of a movie.  Right.  You want to hit hard.  You know, you want to hit him like that, and then you move along, and then during the movie  you get your peaks and valleys and whatnot.  I'd rather the season start out like the movie The Player did.  Just boring?  Was it called The Player?  Dull, what?  I'm going for an obscure reference.  Was it The Player or The Player's The Player, right?  I think so.  Or is it the longest opening scene ever using only one camera shot? 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  Pulp Fiction did one of those, too.  It didn't beat The Player.  They had that long shot of...  Watch the opening of The Player, and you'd realize, holy shit.  Really?  One shot?  One shot just going in windows, out windows, people walking across parking lots.  Now a car drives by, and then they go back to this guy.  And it wasn't interfered with any shenanigans?  Like, you know, it goes through something?  No, no.  You have a cut?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:30:00]  Because I remember when the movie came out, I don't even know why I know this.  They were going for some kind of, like, record.  I think Hitchcock was famous for doing that.  One shot with a lot of different action, not just the same action, where all of a sudden  you move the camera to the left, and there's a whole other thing happening over here that  segs into another thing happening over here.  So one actor fucks up, and they have to start over.  The Travolta-Samuel Jackson scene when they're getting the briefcase, the whole prelude to  walking into the apartment, is a very long one shot. 
[00:30:30]  But, and, yeah, it's just, and there's a fuckload of Tarantino dialogue in it.  All right, who knows movies?  I want to know which scene's more impressive.  Now, Pulp Fiction is a great movie.  I think a scene with more dialogue, having a long scene, maybe not as long as another  one, but a scene with a lot of dialogue.  Well, refresh my memory, how much dialogue.  It's just, holy fuck, it's them talking about the foot massage and Rocky Horror.  But it's those two going back and forth, right?  There's no other people involved?  Right.  The player has to have at least a dozen people, and at least four to five different scenes 
[00:31:00]  in the opening shot.  And there's no cuts?  Why are we talking about this?  No, none.  None.  It's just something to talk about.  I saw The Player about a month or two ago, and that movie is fucking good, man.  I'll have to check that out.  Have you seen The Player?  No.  It's a solid movie.  I've not.  It's a pretty good story, too, about Hollywood, and they literally have so many fucking cameos  in this movie. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah?  Everybody's in it.  Really?  Everybody.  Yeah.  Me?  Huh?  Me?  Yeah, you're in it.  You just don't know that.  Chris in Houston.  Chris.  You?  Hey.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Uh, Russian arc by Alexander...  Uh, this film consists of a single 90-minute Steadicam sequence shot.  All right, look, anybody can just fucking make a piece-of-shit movie with a long shot.  Exactly.  If it's good... 
[00:32:00]  The Hubble took one.  Yeah, yeah.  It's gotta actually be good, you know.  Wait a minute.  They closed the trunk, so that was an edit.  No, no, I know.  It goes...  It's not right from that.  It's not right from there.  Okay.  I think there's another cut.  Well, if there's a cut, then you lose the argument.  No, but it's right till they fucking walk up to the door and walk into the fucking...  Nah, the player's way better.  You mean this amp?  Yeah, this whole scene.  No, not when they walk in this door.  When they walk in the door to the apartment.  So it's all the dialogue about... 
[00:32:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, they talk about the pilot.  Let's just sit here and watch Pulp Fiction today.  Tony Rocky Horror getting thrown out the window.  And whether a foot massage is sexual or not.  Like, there's a fuckload of dialogue and different subjects.  See, that was a cut.  Yeah, as soon as that...  And I believe there's an elevator cut.  Well, then...  But no, this is a long-ass scene.  They haven't gotten to the one shot yet.  But as soon as they have a cut, you know they could have did lunch and then started up again. 
[00:33:00]  That's exactly it.  I'm not talking about this part.  With the player, no one had time to eat.  They just couldn't have one take on the player, though.  Yeah.  If we could...  Could you find the player real fast?  I don't know.  It's a really long scene, but...  Troy, Long Island.  Now it starts.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  In Pulp Fiction, the scene you might be thinking about is when Bruce Willis goes in to get the watch.  That's a very long scene.  And also in Goodfellas, the Copa Cabana scene is famous for being...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They have shots.  When he's walking him and his bitch fucking girlfriend wife through the Copa. 
[00:33:30]  Where he parks outside, goes through the kitchen, and walks.  And it's all the way up until...  Pretty much until...  He sits down in the front, right?  He sits down and...  Who's the stupid old comedian?  Henny Youngman.  Yeah.  And Henny Youngman starts his act.  All right.  And that is a long-ass fucking shot.  And there's a lot going on in that scene.  Oh, yeah.  Kitchen scene.  A lot of stuff moving around.  There's a slip at one point. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  What is this?  That Russian movie?  I think this is...  No, this is the opening to The Player.  Oh.  Is Malcolm McDowell in this or no?  Fuck.  Or Tim Robbins?  Tim Robbins is, absolutely.  He's pretty much the main guy.  Starts with a secretary opening a phone call.  They start panning out.  Showing a little more action.  Robert Altman.  Yeah, Robert Altman.  Some of his films are pretty cool.  Now they're kind of panning more out to show more of the scene. 
[00:34:30]  The camera's just pulling back.  Walking.  And now they're walking out of the building.  Now she's running across the sidewalk.  Now it shows the whole studio lot.  Craneshot.  Look at this.  There's a lot of shit going on.  And now it reveals a car driving up.  Oh, that's a vehicle.  And you're not going to see the camera fucking cut once, man.  I'm telling you.  This is pretty fucking impressive.  It's intricate.  There's a lot of shit going on.  Because it started inside an office.  And now it's Tim Robbins getting out of a car, walking into another building. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  Now they're walking down the sidewalk.  Guys talking to Tim Robbins.  Yeah, you can't fuck this up.  All right.  Now he's going in a building.  So you're thinking, okay, that's it.  No, now they pick up on the action of these two guys that happen to be leaving the building  as Tim goes in.  And now they're walking.  And he's talking about it.  Yeah.  And now two other guys are just talking on the lot, walking on the sidewalk.  He set up that picture with one tracking shot. 
[00:35:30]  And now they go into the window where Tim Robbins is now in his office.  And the camera hasn't cut once yet.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good.  What do you got for me?  Okay.  Here it is.  Wow.  The Graduate.  Part two.  Oh, good.  The Graduate.  The three principals are still with us.  Horrible idea.  Justin Hoffman and Ben Groft.  Catherine Ross.  25 years later.  And so are the characters.  Ben, Elaine, and Mrs. Robinson. 
[00:36:00]  Ben and Elaine are married.  Still.  They live in a big old spooky house up in Northern California.  Sounds horrible.  Mrs. Robinson lives with them.  They're just mocking Hollywood, though, man.  Yeah, yeah.  The pictures they actually get.  Mrs. Robinson has had a stroke.  Mrs. Robinson has a stroke.  Mrs. Robinson has a stroke.  So she can't talk.  Is it going to be funny?  Yeah.  It's going to be funny.  It's going to be weird and funny.  I got to see those.  It's a pretty good movie, man.  Maybe it's, I don't know what it is.  It's a malady of some sort.  One of those films they study in film class.  Really?  Yeah.  I've got a daughter who's just graduated from college. 
[00:36:30]  That's good.  Young blood.  22, 23-year-old, like a junior.  Junior Roberts.  Right.  Excuse me.  What do you want me to do with these scripts?  That goes to Bonnie Chirot.  Okay.  And find out from studio security how Adam Simon got on the line.  Okay.  Adam Simon?  So they're still doing the scene.  That's still one.  Through the window from the outside.  Yeah.  And now they start changing out.  It goes on forever, I know.  I don't know if we can do the whole thing.  The total time is eight minutes, so you've got another five minutes of this one shot.  Wow.  And now they're on to two other characters without cutting the fucking camera. 
[00:37:00]  Vincent Canopio's in that one, too?  They go to the toilet.  He's sitting out with a gun.  And now a golf cart ran over a guy.  I do remember this movie, but it's been a long, long time.  This is still the same fucking camera.  I might enjoy it more now that I've done so many Hollywood film things.  Yeah.  Focus in on some postcards and mail.  That's all over the ground. 
[00:37:30]  Trying to look for some trickery, but it ain't happening.  Now a car pulls up.  Now the camera follows the car.  Do you know how many times one person fucked this up?  That's insane.  That's why it's amazing.  You fucking asshole.  The timing on this had to be perfect.  All right.  I mean, we don't have to do that whole thing, but...  Get it.  I'd like to know how many takes it actually took.  I bet they had a looser script.  Like that dialogue that was happening in the office about The Graduate 2 there. 
[00:38:00]  I bet that was pretty loose.  Like, you don't have to say it verbatim.  And they're still running credits.  Well, I love it.  Yeah.  He's actually a good actor.  He's a very good actor.  Now they show another car pulling up out of nowhere, and now...  Ah, whatever.  It just keeps going.  Check it out.  Fucking Blair Monster.  What happened?  Hey, what's up, Dirk?  Another good, like, long extended take is the end of Boogie Nights, where William H. Macy  shoots himself. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When he goes out and gets the car, gets the gun.  Yeah, yeah.  Goes to the car, gets the gun, walks all the way back.  That's a great scene, because he locks the car door when he goes back.  I know.  What a great thing to do before you kill your wife and yourself, because the ball is dropping.  Wow.  He's fantastic.  By the way, speaking of being shot in the head, what removed all moisture from your hair?  Jesus, Dirk.  Rough morning.  Rough morning.  Rough morning.  It just started.  Wow.  Gotta love Dirk.  You're not sleeping in the...  Sorry. 
[00:39:00]  Sorry.  Are you a little hungover?  Yeah, just a little, because I started running again, and I forgot, like, I was telling Danny  that, like, how much energy you have after you start working out again, so obviously I  turned to drinking to try to, you know, get rid of some of that energy.  Quell the energy.  Very good.  Good idea.  Way to handle it.  That's good.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Last night was the first night.  I slept all the way through to the alarm, and I can't even tell you how fucking long. 
[00:39:30]  And that was directly proportional to how I was beaten up yesterday.  By the trainer?  By the trainer.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  I am achy.  Achy.  And I have rubber legs.  When I try to walk down the stairs, I go like, I...  I've been doing, like, one or two days a week.  I'm the worst.  I can't get motivated.  I'm too tired.  I'm just fucking exhausted from getting up at five.  That's what it is, you know.  I like taking a little nappy.  And then, uh... 
[00:40:00]  Then you hit the...  Then you hit the gym.  Let's say hi to John of Smithtown.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, good evening.  The longest Steadicam Untrupted Shot is from Atonement, and it's absolutely amazing.  The amount of shit that's going on is like Ben-Hur back in the day in the 50s with ghosts  and fucking extras and shit.  It's amazing.  I cannot believe how long it must have taken to do.  You guys gotta check it out.  It's at the beaches of Dunkirk in World War II.  I don't even know how we got on this topic, but all right, I gotta check that out now. 
[00:40:30]  Right on.  It's amazing.  Right on.  The movie's not so great as a whole, but that scene fucking blew me away.  I had to watch it with my wife.  I was pretty bored most of the movie, but that scene's amazing.  Wait, who was in Atonement again?  Uh, the guy from...  The guy with the Scottish accent who was hot for a while.  He was in that Angelina Jolie-Wantit movie.  Oh, Sean Connery.  William Wallace.  I don't know.  You'll know him.  You'll know him.  And Q and Knightley, I believe.  The movie we ship, but that scene's amazing.  Check it out.  Check it out.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:41:00]  Cool.  People have other examples.  Do we care?  Snake Eyes.  Carlito's Way.  When Al Patino's running through the subway.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  And his wig keeps hitting the subway ceiling.  Yeah.  And his little lifts.  My lifts got caught between the train and the platform.  He tries to kill himself like Robert Shaw at the end of taking a pal in one, two,  three, but the rubber in his lifts protects him.  I'm grounded.  Yeah.  I tried to jump in front of a train.  It rolled right over me, and I was standing.  I got styrofoam on my head. 
[00:41:30]  I know that Clark's has a few extended scenes, but I don't think it was really deliberate.  It was just that they didn't have a lot of film.  Yeah.  They kind of had to get stuff done in one take.  Or much of a budget, so I was like, all right, we got to do this once in one time only.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  Want to keep continuing here?  Might as well.  You know?  Doing a lot of stuff.  First break here.  The Tiger Woods commercial.  I'm sure everyone has seen this by now.  It hit, what, yesterday afternoon?  Oh, so now Tiger. 
[00:42:00]  I haven't seen it.  You haven't seen the Tiger Woods commercial?  I have not.  I was too busy yesterday.  It's in black and white.  Creeping a little.  It's a 30-second spot.  Tiger in black and white with this very serious, what would you call the look?  It's serious, but it's also, also, he looks reflective.  Reflective, you think?  He's reflecting and serious and just kind of looking straight-faced, closed-mouth into  the camera.  Black and white.  Jimmy, the audio is...  He is. 
[00:42:30]  Black and white.  I know it's Earl, his dad.  The audio is of his dad, which is kind of creepy.  He tried.  I didn't hear you.  No.  What happened?  Never mind.  What happened, my love?  No, nothing.  Bring us back to that moment, please.  No, no, no, no.  Was it good?  No, it was all right.  I'll just let it sit there.  Was it racist?  Um, it was Rachel.  He goes, um.  He goes, um.  Who doesn't love Anthony?  How do you not love Anthony?  He goes, um.  Well, yeah.  It's not even seven yet. 
[00:43:00]  Of course.  None of them are up.  All right, let's listen to this commercial from, uh, let's do it.  Yeah, here we go.  The Tiger Woods commercial.  Black and white.  Just looking into the camera.  Tiger?  I am more prone to being quidditching.  To promote discussion.  I want to find out what your thinking was.  I want to find out what your feelings are.  And did you learn anything? 
[00:43:30]  And then the Nike logo.  That's it.  That's just great advertising.  It's a great commercial.  Yeah, because again, it's a really tough angle right now.  What do you do with him?  Um, but you want to have him as the, I love the fact that Nike didn't go anywhere.  I love the fact that that product didn't, didn't fag it away like every other product  went right for the hills.  Fucking everybody is going to be playing this Nike commercial today.  It's a great commercial.  Can you imagine what they're going to get out of this commercial? 
[00:44:00]  They use his father's voice and it definitely ties into the situation.  Oh man.  It's like his father giving him advice on what he just went through.  Did you at least learn something?  Yeah, yeah.  What'd you learn?  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, uh, yeah, that, that makes a point and, um, yeah, people are going to be showing it  on the news and, uh, going to get great exposure.  I have to get some audio of my parents quickly because there's none.  You don't have any good audio.  It's just my mother calling to tell me I shouldn't get prostitutes because Dr. Phil said I should 
[00:44:30]  work out.  That's true.  That's all I have.  But you started listening to her.  You started working out after that.  I did.  And I, and I got prostitutes.  I didn't change my behavior.  I just added to it.  Just add something new to it.  Yeah, because I was sick of the hookers filling my doughy tits.  Uh, you think he's exploiting his dead dad though?  Nah.  Yeah, with that.  They were very close.  I mean, it was, he was, his father's the one who probably pushed him into golf.  His father probably would approve of something like that, right?  I'm sure he didn't come up with the ad, but he had to sign off on it. 
[00:45:00]  And, uh, yeah, I think, I think he probably thought it was tastefully done and not very  exploitive.  It kind of helps him out, I think.  Yeah.  Uh, we're going back to the player for a second?  Oh.  All right, so it's Robert Altman.  1992.  Wow.  Okay.  Uh, this opening and self, uh, referential shot was unscripted and, unscripted and all  the dialogue was improvised.  It took 15 takes, but Altman ended up using the third take. 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  The interior scenes of Griffin Mills, played by Tim Robbins' office, are the same used  in Barton Fink.  Okay.  Oh, how about that then?  Wait, what's the interior scenes used in Barton Fink?  What's that mean?  I don't know.  I guess the movie Barton Fink?  I didn't see Barton Fink.  I didn't either.  But in that office, I guess, when they're filming through the window.  They improvised that whole thing?  They had to have some obvious basic stuff they wanted.  I guess they had guidelines.  That's what I was saying.  I'm sure it was a very loose script.  You know, you can't, you can't hold on to a script when you're doing a fucking shot like 
[00:46:00]  that.  Yeah, probably today, this is about, you know, make up something about a bad movie pitch.  Right, right.  Yeah.  You could, I mean, the, the opening scene of the player is on YouTube, but okay, so it's  improvised.  What if someone decided, you know what, I got an extra line I want to do here, but the  car is already moving that they have to get into the shot.  Then they probably just fade off of him and go to the car and just leave their conversation  up in the air.  I'm sure they got a few of those.  Fuck, that's pretty cool.  Uh, so the Tiger thing.  And Tiger tees off today.  Holy shit.  Yes.  At one, what?  Forty five or something? 
[00:46:30]  One forty two.  Oh, one forty two.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying one forty two over and over again.  Stop.  One forty five.  The most important time of the day.  And a lot of speculation.  Will everybody be quiet?  Will he be heckled?  Nah, they're going to give him a huge ovation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's going to be a couple of dummies in there, but they're going to be drowned  out by a huge ovation.  And that's how it's going to be.  I do believe.  The same people that contributed to his misery by fucking like vultures swooping up.  Yes.  And reading and buying everything about him are the ones who are now going to clap for 
[00:47:00]  him like he is victorious after coming back from the numb.  It's the same people that shake our hands at clubs and bash the shit out of us on message  boards.  It's that same type of fucking vibe.  As they say they're fans the entire time.  Yes.  That's not just whatever.  Do what you got to do.  Yes.  Yeah.  There was something else.  Oh, another woman coming out today.  I know it's funny.  I love the people on Twitter, Facebook.  I don't care. 
[00:47:30]  The people go, I'm sick of Tiger Woods.  Enough about Tiger.  But there's new info coming out every day.  So it's not one of these stories where you have all the facts and then you run it into  the ground.  Every day there's something new.  Today it's he's playing golf for the first time.  He got the commercial with his dead dad.  And now you got a woman coming out.  She's 21 years old.  She was a neighbor of Tiger Woods and supposedly she banged Tiger right next to a crib in Tiger's  house.  Knew him since she was 14.  Yeah.  14.  How hot is that? 
[00:48:00]  And my God, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  And I'm just saying the neighbor.  Yeah, of course.  Watching her grow up.  Yeah.  You know, you're banging her.  Jesus.  Fucking great.  And yeah, he wound up banging her.  I didn't see her.  Is there a picture of her?  Yeah.  She's better looking than the Perkins waitress.  Who isn't?  Wonderful white woman.  Who isn't is right.  Tiger loves his white chicks.  Oh, boy.  If it had melanin in it, he'd put his dick nowhere near it.  Exactly.  Youth is served.  Rachel Cordray, I guess, who has known Tiger since she was 14, reportedly had a tryst with 
[00:48:30]  him on a couch right next to a crib.  Tiger Woods didn't have to roam far from home to pounce on his youngest carnal conquest yet.  Jesus.  Overdramatic.  The sex craze golf grade had a steamy one night stand with his neighbor's 21 year old  daughter, less than a mile from his Florida mansion.  Just as Woods 34 prepares it to you off the Masters today, a sordid new report says he  bedded curvy college student. 
[00:49:00]  Aren't they all curvy?  Bedded curvy college student.  Sounds like Russ Myers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Super big.  Besodic.  Why is she talking about it now?  Why is she coming out?  You fucked a guy when you were 21 who you knew was married.  Because they all want a payday and they all want a little fame.  Yeah.  That's why.  What do you got to get attention?  The National Enquirer claims Corday, Cordray, something like that, whatever, Rachel, now 
[00:49:30]  22, had an exhausting two hour sex session with Tiger last mate on a couch in his private  office.  Wow.  What was going on to make it exhausting?  I don't know.  Jimmy?  What was going on?  Ass sex.  He just couldn't come.  I'll bet you that was it.  I'll bet you that every time he would get close to coming, she would say something that  reminded him that it was the neighbor, like, oh, a guy had to put the sprinklers on his  dick would wilt.  Oh, I remember.  Maybe he just had a Cialis heart on.  Yeah, that's true.  With the crib, she'd keep looking at the crib. 
[00:50:00]  Where's the baby?  Shut up, shut up, shut up.  Shut up, shut up.  The crib probably wouldn't be a good thing.  While home from college, God damn, this is a hot story.  Gotta love that, right?  While home from college last month on spring break, Rachel, enraged by reports of Tiger's  many mistresses, angrily confronted him at the private clubhouse gym and told him, I  feel extremely violated by what you did to me.  Oh, stop it.  Exactly.  Why?  I love these women that have no problem ignoring the fact that he's a married man, but because 
[00:50:30]  he's banging other broads on the side, then they get mad.  These women are sickening.  They're sickening.  That's nuts.  Why?  So if he didn't get caught and she didn't know any better, it was just one of those  things she told her friends, guess what I did?  Yeah.  Fuck Tiger Woods.  You still know he had a wife.  Yeah.  She still had a wife.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  So you're in no position to be pissed off or enraged.  She's looking for a waddle doodle apology.  What you did to me.  Fucking starstruck. 
[00:51:00]  She fucked her because of who he was, and then she's mad because he took advantage of  who he was and fucked her.  Shut up.  Exactly.  I'm with you, Jim.  Sorry about that, responded Tiger.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  What movie?  Warriors.  That's right, right, right.  Woods had apparently lusted for the attractive brunette, whom he knew since she was 14 for  some time.  He invited her to play golf, asked her to meet him at a party thrown by a mutual friend,  and even joked about her cleaning his golf balls.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[00:51:30]  Ugh.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  She was infatuated with him.  They exchanged phone numbers.  Then he began texting her.  He began making out with Rachel and his Escalade just yards from the home he shared with his  wife.  That Escalade has seen a lot of action.  How much would you give to put a blacklight on that Escalade?  Oh, God.  Glow like a Peter Maxx painting.  Woods then took her to his office so they could have some privacy. 
[00:52:00]  The two of them had sex on a couch for hours right next to a crib for Tiger's children.  He probably just had a fucking crib.  Yeah, the crib is there.  Who cares?  No kid in it.  The crib made Rachel feel guilty.  Aw.  Did it.  As her legs are in the air, really?  Exactly.  Not too guilty.  Still took your pants off.  Still took some cock, didn't you?  I feel guilty that she was having sex with a married man with children, but she was smitten.  How come there's a butt before every one of these fucking whores? 
[00:52:30]  Butt.  Butt.  Yeah.  Butt.  There's always a butt.  Well, she, butt.  You knew he was married and you fucked him.  Shut up.  Don't want to hear it unless it's she took it in the...  Exactly.  There's two T's I want to hear it.  Wait.  Or she fed him with her.  Did Jim say butt?  Butt?  Travis, did Jim say butt?  Butt?  Butt?  Did Jim say butt?  I want to see if Travis says that.  What the fuck?  Did you say butt?  His fingers work like the chimp lady.  Nah, he didn't know I was going there. 
[00:53:00]  He'll find it, though.  Did you say butt, Jimmy?  No.  No.  Yes.  I said butt, butt.  In the butt.  I said butt, butt.  In the butt.  I said butt, butt.  In the butt.  I said butt, butt.  In the butt.  You want to do it in my butt?  In my butt.  You want to do it in my butt?  In my butt.  You want to do it in my butt?  In my butt.  Do it in my butt.  Okay.  Is this guy gay?  That's Robert Kelly.  He knew every word of that song when we brought it up the other day.  All right. 
[00:53:30]  A long way for a stupid joke, Bobby.  But she was smitten.  She reportedly told friends that Woods did not use a condom and that the sex was mechanical  and unemotional.  Mechanic.  He just like, like his swing.  Like his golf swing.  He fucks like he golfs.  He fucked so much it just became like, eh.  In, out, repeat.  Right.  Yeah, it's crazy.  She fucking just shoved this big hog in her face.  Oh, yeah.  Good for him.  Good boy.  The Inquirer also reporting that Woods texted the girl many times looking for a repeat romp, 
[00:54:00]  even asking her to fly with him to Michigan so they could have sex using ambient sleeping pills.  Jesus, this is Tiger Woods.  He rules.  I'm at the point where I just think he rules.  He fucking rules.  What about him?  Fuck all these broads.  Yeah.  Ambient sleeping pills.  Those are the same meds he reportedly took to have crazy ambient sex with another mistress,  Rachel Ucatella.  Right?  Did I say it?  Ucatella.  I didn't say it right that time either.  No, it's a hard go.  It's not.  Think ukulele or ukulele. 
[00:54:30]  Uh, when this latest Rachel reportedly refused his offer, Tiger sent one of his trademark  dirty text messages.  Ah, a trademark.  He's got trademarked dirty text messages?  I want to eat your cunt, TM.  I hope I'm not guilty of any copyright infringement.  I'm sure.  Jesus Christ.  Because I actually have said suck my big black Asian dick many times.  Oh, no.  I didn't mean to steal from Tiger.  It's copywritten. 
[00:55:00]  He gets sued by Tiger because he's using one of his text messages.  Yeah.  Uh, the text, when are you coming home again?  I want to see you.  What are you doing right now?  Are you touching yourself?  I want to fuck you, according to the report.  The source told the Inquirer Rachel felt ashamed.  She had a new boyfriend, and despite all the badgering from Woods for the next four months,  she refused to hook up with him.  After news broke, okay, this is where we find out why she did what she did.  After news broke that Tiger had affairs with a lesion of low-rent lovelies, Rachel's shame 
[00:55:30]  intensified.  Aw, poor girl.  The source continued.  Rachel told me, when all these other women came out, I felt used and violated, like I  meant nothing to him but a night of casual sex.  I just wanted to dig a big hole, crawl in, and die.  And that's what you should have done.  Instead of fucking blabbing.  Enough about talking about it.  Just do it.  The world's not going to miss you.  No.  It's obvious that one of her friends babbled to the media.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, now she has to act like she regrets it.  Yeah, please.  Let's say hi to Curtis in Illinois.  Curtis!  Morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Curtis.  Hey, I'm looking forward to the return of Tiger Woods.  Now I can hear them douchebags yell out, get in the hole on a tee shot on a par five.  Like, oh, get in the hole.  Yeah, on the hole.  Well, that's the thing to do.  That's the thing to do on a golf course.  Oh, no.  What is?  They'll chuckle.  Well, they think it's really funny.  Like, you know, they're teeing off on par five, par four.  It's impossible to get in the hole. 
[00:56:30]  You just can't hit it that far.  Yeah.  But some douche in the gallery will always yell, get in the hole!  And then everyone chuckles because they think he's a comedian.  And since Tiger put his dick in a lot of holes, they'll laugh at that even more.  Maybe somebody will yell, stay out of the hole.  Yeah, yeah.  And that will get the laugh.  Oh, get it.  Oh, this guy's a card.  Yeah.  It would be funny if anyone heckled they were shot.  I've heard it because bodyguards had orders to shoot to kill.  Did you see that little misting of the skull? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, a little pink mist.  Maybe two inside, but Augusta's highbrow as far as golf tournaments go.  So, I mean, when they played the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, it would be a whole different story.  Oh, man.  Tiger would get beat up pretty good.  Bunch of fucking Long Island trash.  Just lunatics.  Yeah, but the PGA loves Bethpage Black.  They're going back there.  What is the most prestigious golf course in the country?  Is it Augusta?  It has to be.  Bushwood. 
[00:57:30]  It's got to be Augusta.  Is that why they wouldn't let Clinton play or no?  Where wouldn't Clinton be?  There were some places that they could win because of the Secret Service.  Oh, I don't know.  That's a good question.  It might have been in Jersey.  Is there a big one in Jersey?  Um, I don't know.  Not like in Augusta, I don't think.  Augusta's in Georgia, right?  Yeah, maybe some ridiculous exclusive golf club that, you know, they're such assholes.  They just don't give a shit who you are and don't let you play, maybe.  Are there still any restricted golf courses where Jews and blacks aren't allowed? 
[00:58:00]  Well, this Augusta don't like the women still.  Well, yeah.  They don't let them join?  That's women.  They were yelling and screaming a few years back, remember?  We did the story.  Yeah.  They were outside picketing with their signs and stuff.  But then what happens is you let women join and then you have some strippers and they  fucking complain.  We don't, this is supposed to be friendly for both genders.  They just ruin it.  I know.  It's like, no one wants to hang out with you.  But I don't understand why they want to join a man's world.  Let's get into this a little bit because, I mean, as far as golf goes, women's,  women groups have to get stronger and then they start their own thing somewhere. 
[00:58:30]  Why do they have to, like, move into a man's world with their shit?  Yeah.  Because they're annoying.  To make a point.  So, I mean, if you really want to play golf and you're a powerful organization, then fucking  get a golf course together where just women play.  It goes not only with golf, but there are some of these social clubs and things where  they've been just men for a hundred years.  And then a woman decides, you know, to take them to court and she's got to get in there. 
[00:59:00]  So then they got to change everything they do.  Dude.  And, you know, make sure their speech isn't offensive.  And it just wrecks everything.  There are times women just wreck shit.  You know?  Yeah.  They just wreck shit.  I grew up around a golf course.  Not because I was rich.  But somebody had to carry the golf bags and fucking do all the bullshit.  And when the women came around, the demeanor of everybody changed.  Yeah.  You got to be careful with your language. 
[00:59:30]  You got to be careful about everything.  And now you got to be PC and let the women tee off.  And then it's a men's group behind them.  And the women just, for the most part, don't play as quickly or efficiently as men.  So now the whole golf course is backed up because they're trying to do the right thing.  Some dumb bitch can't fucking hit the ball.  Right.  They should be putting on their bikinis and just hanging out by the pool.  Exactly.  Giving the guys some eye candy after they get off the course.  Get the men some beers.  Right.  I'm all for the women being allowed to do whatever the hell they want. 
[01:00:00]  But do it in their own world.  They try to move into what's already established as a man's world.  Yeah.  Can't there be certain aspects where it's just separate?  Yeah.  Where it's just separate.  Where guys will do guy things and girls will do girl things and whatever.  And then the other stuff, yeah.  You mix them up.  But, yeah, there's always some fucking killjoy that's got to get in there.  And I think we should be allowed to. 
[01:00:30]  And then the guy's going to get blown on the course like during some bachelor party.  And they complain.  Don't complain.  Just don't complain if you don't like the dirty jokes.  That's why guys don't fucking hang out with you because you don't tell dirty jokes.  Yeah.  Stop.  Oh, I don't.  Oh, that's mean.  Oh, you used to pull into a fucking garage to get an oil change or something like that.  And the guy's toolbox was just plastered with fucking porno.  I remember as a kid, that was like fucking great. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Dad would pull the car up.  Or all of a sudden you had to go into the office at a garage just to, you know, talk about the numbers.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, holy shit.  It was just calendars with spread fucking gaping asses.  Yeah, it wasn't an FHM calendar.  This was the hardcore Swank put out a calendar every year.  They'd have their Snap-on Tools fucking box opened up and just plastered with hardcore pornography.  Remember?  They can't do that.  Remember as a kid, though?  Yeah.  Dad had to talk numbers and you sit down next to dad and across from the desk of the greasy fucking garage guy. 
[01:01:30]  Getting a fucking rod.  Trying to be cool about it because dad's being cool about it.  Oh, I fucking remember that.  Yes, E-Rock.  There's still some clubs down in Florida where they separate men and women.  And one of the clubs my dad belongs to.  There's a separate restaurant, card room, everything for men.  The women have what they call the bridge room.  And if they're lucky, they have waiting service.  A cunt room.  That big tampon dispenser on the wall. 
[01:02:00]  It's a big giant white box.  You just push it and a fucking tamp falls out.  Are we pissing off the women today?  Probably.  Why, though?  They know it's right.  I really think there's times where you want to fucking hang out with the boys and the women should hang out.  The reason they don't want to hang out with each other is because they're just a bunch of boars.  They don't want to do what you want to do.  Talking about what Susie did.  Did you hear what Susie did?  No, and I don't care. 
[01:02:30]  It's like, look, if you're a woman and you want to lay on your back while some fucking other, some stripper rubs her fucking slug lips over your fucking face and pick up a dollar, we're all for having in the club.  All right.  This guy is going to, you asked, Jimmy.  That's the only reason.  Chris in Milford.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Yeah, that course in Jersey, it's in South Jersey, the most prestigious course in the world.  It's called Pine Valley.  Right.  It's in the Pine Barrens.  Pine Valley is the most exclusive course in America? 
[01:03:00]  In the world.  In the world?  Why?  What makes it the most exclusive club?  Well, first, Anthony would love it because if you're not a rich white man, you're not getting in.  All right.  But, yeah, they don't allow tournaments.  They don't allow guests.  No guests?  Employment are allowed on the premises a couple times a week for lunch or tea or whatever they do.  I mean, they even have their own zip code.  It's probably guys just ass-fucking on the greens. 
[01:03:30]  You know what?  They're allowed to just...  You know what?  My father-in-law just backed that up.  He says Pine Valley.  Back that shit up.  Wait, they don't allow tournaments?  Or yes?  Which means father-in-law is listening right now, and he heard me say that it's the 14-year-old fucking neighbor story.  It's pretty hot.  Well, I think he figured that out.  Well, here's the price he has to pay for having his daughter live in a four-bedroom apartment in Manhattan.  She's married to garbage.  Sorry, Big Ken.  He says Pine Valley, too. 
[01:04:00]  Now, all right, but Jimmy says, like, Clinton wouldn't be able to play...  I think he wasn't allowed because of a Secret Service.  They didn't want the security.  Does anyone know that story?  Because he said he was the first black president.  They took it literally.  Staying the fuck out.  Well, yeah, if that was the case, they definitely wouldn't allow him.  Wait, dude, they don't allow guests there?  If they're not in the family, I don't believe so.  I think the only well-known person that's a member there is Chris O'Donnell, I guess Robin.  But that's it. 
[01:04:30]  I think he had some family ties from his wife there.  Who else is a member there?  Like, what, just doctors and, like, lawyers?  It's all old money.  Yeah, dude, there are people, especially in Manhattan, that don't give a shit about, you know, uber fame like a Madonna or a Paul McCartney or a Bono.  Like, a lot of these celebrities have a really hard time getting into some of these buildings because they don't give a shit.  They have old money, and they feel they're way more prestigious than these high-profile celebrities.  They allow guests, but they must be invited and accompanied by a member, and women are allowed to play on Sunday afternoons. 
[01:05:00]  Only, I guess.  Because that's what they do.  Sunday afternoons means after all the boys are in from their ranks.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's probably, like, five in the afternoon.  This jacket was given to me by the Knights of the Links of St. Andrews.  You know what takes me out of that Caddyshack movie?  The fact that they used a shitty golf course.  It bothers me every time.  Ah, it's fucking great. 
[01:05:30]  Who cares?  Just because I grew up around golf.  Golf without the L.  It's, like, the worst public course I've ever played on.  Yeah.  And they make it look like it's a prestigious country club.  Bush would.  What was the story?  Because nobody wanted to fucking lose the time and revenue?  Yeah.  By closing down their golf course for a film shoot?  And they didn't want the course fucked up?  Do you know those dummies?  For any place to say this is where Caddyshack was filmed, you know any golfers that they would have there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I know.  Probably a lot.  You take the hit and then, yeah, a lot, Jimmy. 
[01:06:00]  You take the hit and then for the rest of time there, you're the place Caddyshack was filmed on.  Come on.  Colin in Wisconsin.  Yeah, well.  You know, it's just golf.  Golf.  You want to hit a ball around?  It's fine.  It's just in Afghanistan.  What?  What?  Colin.  Hey, hey, good morning.  I just want to say, first of all, you have to absolutely roll.  I listen to the show just for you and Jimmy.  Sorry, Hope.  Wow.  No need to hurt Opie's feelings to make...  All right, you talk. 
[01:06:30]  Now, why would you do that, Colin?  Just to make me feel bad today, you fucking cocksucker?  Go fuck yourself.  Every single time.  Well, good for you.  You need to come on a red eye.  Let's see the world see your humor.  What?  Let the world see.  You need to come on a red eye.  Let the world see Opie's humor as well.  I fucking get...  I get...  Go fuck yourself.  Go ahead, Colin.  Well, I just want you to go on there, too.  We want to see you as well.  I just called to say that golf stands for gentlemen only, ladies forbid. 
[01:07:00]  No, it doesn't.  Wow, that's hilarious, Colin.  After setting up how fucking you know humor.  And then he hangs up, by the way.  That is such a fucking, like, old wives' tale.  It doesn't stand for that.  It's like, fornication under consent of the king.  That's what fuck means.  Shut up.  It doesn't.  Maybe it did, though.  Stop.  What is...  But there is an origin of fuck. 
[01:07:30]  It's probably just something somebody yelled while hammering a nail and they hit their thumb.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Isn't it a...  I thought it came from the German word, fricken, which is to strike.  Or am I just reciting what I remember from that?  It's the fuck lesson.  Look at Snopes.  We could play the fuck lesson for everybody going on a break today.  I've also heard for unlawful carnal knowledge it was a charge for prostitution or something.  Yeah, but I don't think so.  Remember when Van Halen named their album that because they thought they would be clever? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, amazing.  For unlawful carnal knowledge.  They also had OU812.  Yeah, OU812.  That's because David Lee Roth put out Eat Him and Smile.  Is that the reason?  Yeah, so they came back with OU812.  What does that mean?  To get back at him.  But how did they get back at him?  Oh, look, OU812.  Like, wow, big deal.  Eat Him and Smile.  Hey, what a cock?  What does that mean?  That they hated each other?  Well, obviously.  So why don't they just put out an album, I Hate You, David Lee Roth.  That's true. 
[01:08:30]  Fucking around with us.  Sucks.  Right.  Ate a cancer brownie.  Sorry, Eddie.  Nice tongue, dick.  See, there's the Nike commercial.  We're going to see it fucking everywhere today.  Brilliant on Nike's car.  Yeah, they're great, man.  They figured out a way to fucking make a new Tiger commercial without everyone yelling and screaming.  Amazing.  Whoa!  All right, David.  Yeah, that whole frickin' or ficken' is more or less accurate.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Is that the word, origin?  Yeah, there's a few different origins, but that one keeps popping up.  So.  All right.  You don't think fornicating under the consent of the king?  I don't look.  The acronym fucking bullshit that people come up with of why things, what the word is, is 99% of it is bullshit.  Here we go.  Stop.  Here we go.  Golf.  Danielle.  What's up, Danielle?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, what do you got?  Um, so I just want to say, Opie, I love you.  Why do you have to hurt my and Anthony feelings now? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, fuck you.  Thank you, bitch.  I love all of you.  No, I mean, here's the deal.  I'm not stupid.  Everyone has their favorites.  You know, but to point it out, I mean, what's the use unless you're trying to just be a dick?  All right.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm not complaining about you.  You like me.  Go ahead, Danielle.  So, yeah, so I was, yeah, I belong to a gym.  And, you know, you get the girls to show up and they're all, you know, with the makeup on, the nice office. 
[01:10:00]  And the guys, you know, grunting and trying to show off.  And then the last straw for me was I was on the machine where you kind of, you have to, like, open and close your legs to work your thighs.  And I had a guy purposely standing in front of me on one of the machines staring at my badge.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you opened that up.  Was that you?  Jesus.  So, yeah, that was the last straw.  And now I belong to a gym.  It's all women, only women.  It's a really nice gym. 
[01:10:30]  And you can just go there, do your thing, get your workout and go.  And that's what should be happening.  Because now what?  You're not going to hear men going, well, I need to be in the all women.  It's a gym, whatever.  So where is the Trout Fitness Center?  Oh, God.  Hilarious.  There's always bears from the parking lot.  Bears.  And fucking seagulls.  How many times did garbage trucks accidentally stop there and dump garbage and then go, oh, sorry.  We thought it was Staten Island.  We didn't realize it was your fucking rotten boxes. 
[01:11:00]  I heard the bicycle seats there have a high suicide rate.  It's great.  God damn.  Oh, that's terrific.  Thank you, Danielle.  It's different, though.  Something like that.  There is an element of sexual stuff that women have to deal with.  Like, you're not going to have women sexually making men uncomfortable in a gym.  Right.  Whereas a guy's, you know, leer at someone's pussy.  I mean, that's a little different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was, I was, it would be me, too.  Looking at her fat lips.  I like to grab a girl's pussy lips and do celebrity impressions. 
[01:11:30]  They hate that when you, when you move their lips back and forth.  They must.  Just, because I don't do good impressions, so I'll do walking.  I'll open her lips and I'll go, ah, the watch.  Ah.  I'm flapping her fucking stink gums.  How long?  How long do they let you do it before they run off screaming?  45 minutes, 50 minutes.  They realize I'm not going to stop.  I was telling, I was telling Jimmy and Kenny on the way home two days ago, I was talking  about women and their workout clothes.  And you guys weren't reacting to anything I was saying. 
[01:12:00]  And I think you thought I was completely nuts.  But I work out a lot.  And what they have done for women's workout clothes is a disservice to men.  They just make them unsetting.  I remember growing up in the, I don't know, let's get physical.  But you remember when a woman wanted to work out, they had no, they had no workout clothes.  They didn't have that, that thing that just strapped everything down, the sports bra.  And, and a woman on a treadmill or, or a bike or something was one of the hottest things  because they were just bouncing all over the, everything was bouncing. 
[01:12:30]  Their ass, their boobs.  You know, it's cool.  The little fucking, if they're wearing like tight kind of spandex workout shit and you  see that little line of pussy sweat that goes all the way around back.  I know what that means.  That's great.  She's working up a froth.  I knew it.  Like a fucking thoroughbred.  See, after the fucking Kentucky Derby, the foaming horses.  That's what I picture between the legs, just froth.  Yeah.  Fucking her pussy lips are all like mushy and fucking got white stuff in between them. 
[01:13:00]  It's like an older man who just fucking ate buttermilk.  It's awful.  You know how many rotten panties get peeled off in the woman's gym?  Just thrown in the garbage.  God damn.  That'd be so great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's nasty.  But now, man, they strap everything down.  Yeah.  It's not as.  Not as sexy.  Not as sexy, man.  I like the camel toe in the gym.  Hey, Danny, could you find old school women working out somehow on. 
[01:13:30]  Man, I know that's a bit of a challenge today, though.  What are you kidding?  Danny knows the challenge.  Huh?  What are the 80s?  Got it.  By the way, Olivia Newton-John, if you want to talk about physical, I heard they found  the guy.  Yeah.  Her fucking ex is alive and confirmed alive.  That guy.  That guy.  Oh, yeah.  He just kind of took off.  That guy said, you know, fuck this.  I'm disappearing.  In Mexico.  And faked his own death, right?  Yeah, but why would he just.  He was with her for nine years.  It had to be some kind of tax thing, I would assume. 
[01:14:00]  You think?  I think it was some kind of finances.  Has to be.  Yeah.  He was just tired of her dumb accent and her songs.  Oh, God.  What was that workout show that used to be on?  Wait, wait.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Danny.  Sorry.  Showtime used to have that workout show where the girls were on that rotating fucking platform.  And it was just, this is like fucking 1981, maybe.  And Showtime would play movies.  But in between movies, they would just play girls kind of on turntables. 
[01:14:30]  It was like they're on giant turntables.  And they would be doing these really provocative, yeah, exercises.  And they would zoom in.  20 minute workout, it was called.  And they would like zoom in on their asses and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And that was like porno back then.  Yeah.  But still the outfits, look.  Oh, yeah.  Has everything anchored down.  And they're not really doing anything.  No, they wouldn't talk.  It was just music.  They're not doing anything. 
[01:15:00]  They all got that fucking, that 80s haircut.  Oh, this is the video.  No, no.  Travis is just playing the music.  Is that what it is?  Or is this the music from the video?  Yeah.  I like it.  Wasn't she really unsexy in this video with her fucking dumb headband?  Stupid headband.  She always sucked.  I like doing grease.  Oncology.  Jesus. 
[01:15:30]  What?  It's always, why?  It's my favorite line in probably in the show's history.  It's so awful.  What?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wowee.  There you go. 
[01:16:00]  You can see everything going on there, right?  Growing up, my friend Frank had a big crush on Olivia Newton-John.  Yeah, everybody kind of did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My friend Frank used to take Polaroids of Rocky when he was on TV.  Frank.  Yeah.  Oh, Frank was better.  Frank was better.  And, uh...  You're an asshole.  Her womb is so polluted.  I love him telling the whole restaurant that he can't fuck...  He can't knock that fucking skinny coke whore up.  Have a little baby.  I like the fact that she says, you know, you're not that good as a fuck. 
[01:16:30]  And he goes, oh, Frank was better.  The husband that he murdered.  Yeah.  She's like, that's game over.  You're an asshole.  Ten minutes later, he's rooting for Pelicans.  Junkie.  Let's just in time.  Let's say hi to Tom in Philly.  Tom.  Hey, bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-buoy.  You're out, Tom.  You're out.  Yeah, maybe I can help.  Hey, uh, guy, we were at a country club back to the golf thing, and we came around the  ninth hole and had to get lunch.  Well, we were with an outside sales girl, and they stopped her at the door and turned her 
[01:17:00]  away and said, you have to wait out here.  So we went inside to get, you know, a hot dog and shit.  And there was a little drive-through window where she was standing.  And we got a hot dog for her and stuck our hand out and gave it to her, and she had to  eat out there by herself.  We closed the door and turned away.  The guy still gets a chuckle out of it.  That's hilarious.  Like a fucking, like a St. Bernard or a Malmute.  Here you go.  What a bunch of assholes, man. 
[01:17:30]  Not you, the country club.  Good girl.  You had to feed her through a fucking hole in the bottom of the door.  Did she just sit on a big rock outside while you guys were enjoying your lunch?  Exactly.  Dumb hole.  See you, boy.  All right, man.  All right.  Get a whole mousercise.  Huh?  Danny just put on some mousercise.  Yuck.  What is that woman doing?  What was the one, what was the workout show where they were on the beach?  And I think.  Saving Private Ryan. 
[01:18:00]  You lose weight when your legs get blown up.  That's a hell of a core workout they had going on.  They were trying to get up on that beach.  Work your abs with this.  I think they, they did, they were in Hawaii.  It started out as the dude, but then he brought his sister along.  And there were a couple of them.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  And the one girl had just huge, huge boobs.  Anybody?  Anybody help us out on that one?  He had some fucking foreign name, but. 
[01:18:30]  Gerard Depardieu?  Yeah, Depardieu's workout.  Spice him.  You don't like him?  How can you?  Spiced.  No.  Kiana's Body Sculpting.  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut.  This is totally different.  This was the fucking show.  I used to watch this in Boston before our afternoon drive show.  Oh, I was watching Days of Our Lives.  Fuck that.  Put in Kiana's Body Sculpting.  Yeah, she, uh.  This was the one to watch. 
[01:19:00]  They don't have any, they don't have any YouTube videos of Kiana's sculpting?  I see it right there.  No?  No?  No, that is not her.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, fuck.  I'm sorry.  That was the one, man.  Kiana's Body Sculpting.  No, no one gives a shit about her.  Is that her?  Well, that might be, uh, the, uh, that's, uh, that's probably what she looks like.  Oh, let's see that time.  Tick, tock, tick, tock.  Oh, shit.  And that proves that working out means nothing. 
[01:19:30]  Because eventually your body wins.  Yeah.  Gravity.  Yeah.  Time.  Air.  All right.  Well, I remember it being a little different than that.  It's too Asian.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Hmm.  What do we got today, man?  Meatloaf.  We got Mr. Loaf coming in today?  Yes.  945.  A loaf.  He's a character.  Yes.  Somebody reminded me, I think it might have been E-Rock, remember when he canceled on  us and we beat the living shit out of him for about an hour?  Yeah.  Yeah, our feelings were hurt. 
[01:20:00]  What happens?  And now he's coming on our show today, finally.  So we'll talk to, um...  What has he got going on?  That's, uh, he's, um...  What do you...  Is it a reality show he's promoting?  Is it a reality show?  He's got to be plugging something.  He's promoting someone who gives a shit projects.  New album.  Oh.  What?  What year is this?  Where is this?  Where's the bat coming from now?  Here comes Sam.  What year is this, a new album?  Maybe we should do this after he leaves.  We get to be able to show. 
[01:20:30]  That's true.  We are stupid.  What's up, Sam?  What is the meat promoting today?  He's got a new album out.  Hang Cool Teddy Bear.  Yes!  Hang Cool Teddy Bear?  That's correct.  Yeah?  Cool.  Did he write, uh, the whole thing?  Do we have any other?  Or it's in music?  We do have it.  Okay.  Um, I don't know.  I don't think he wrote the whole thing.  But he is not...  He did not do this with his Bat Out of Hell collaborator.  Right, right. 
[01:21:00]  Different collaborator.  Who's that, uh...  What's the name of that guy that wrote all the songs?  Uh, with what?  Meat Loaf?  Yeah.  Kim Steinman or something?  Something like that.  Oh, very good.  He, like, wrote...  Or Steiner?  Something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something like that, right?  Yeah, you're right.  Wow, very good.  Steinman.  Good pick up there.  Do you know Bat Out of Hell still sells 200,000 copies a year, and it's fucking 30 years old?  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  So they've got over 40 million albums, man.  Um...  Jesus Christ.  You want to do this after he leaves?  Yeah, he's supposed to be a good interviewer.  Yeah, we'll be good. 
[01:21:30]  Because one of the songs on Hank Cool Teddy Bear...  Yeah.  I'll just say this, and then we'll see if we do it after or before.  He does a duet with someone we love.  Are you being sarcastic?  Yes.  All right.  Male or female?  Male.  Stephen Carr?  No?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, who'd you do it with?  A little guy named Jack. 
[01:22:00]  Mehoff?  Kevorkian?  Jack, anyone?  Oh, no.  No.  Jack Black?  Oh, no.  The Jack Black's eyebrows are going all wacky when he does it.  You'd better pray she took her morning medication. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you might have to pick her up at the police station.  Because if there's trouble in this town, you know she's going to find it.  She's like the devil in a short skirt, but I don't mind it.  Everybody thinks I'm crazy, but they don't even know. 
[01:23:00]  She's like the devil.  She kind of like a rose.  She'll put you on your phone.  She'll kick you when you're low.  And fuck you when she's done.  The bitch is like a rose.  And let me tell you something.  Every time you think you've got control.  She got it.  Not bad.  He sounds good.  To be honest, it's not bad. 
[01:23:30]  Do you know he...  I mean, we forgot that Jack White knows how to sing.  Jack Black, yeah.  I mean, Jack Black, sorry, yeah.  Tenacious D and all that.  And I also want to hear him talk about the Kennedy assassination  because he was there when it happened.  No.  What was he doing there?  Well, apparently he was on the sixth floor.  No, he...  They said that...  Well, let him tell the story,  but he was there when Kennedy was assassinated.  Was he just a spectator?  Oh, he was driving the limo.  Exactly, yeah.  When he was singing on the back,  and that's what Jackie was calling to get his microphone. 
[01:24:00]  Of course he was a spectator as a kid.  He was just a kid?  He went out to...  Yeah, and I'd rather hear him tell the story,  but he was watching...  I don't know how old he is.  I was wondering maybe...  He was probably very, very young.  Maybe he had...  I don't know.  I think he's from Dallas.  And he was...  He could be more than just a spectator being in that area now.  You know who was more than a spectator?  He could have been working the hot dog car.  Jack and Lee Harvey Oswald  were the only two that were more than spectators.  And Governor Connolly.  Good point, good point.  Then he went to the hospital.  It's very interesting.  Really? 
[01:24:30]  I want to talk to Memorial.  Oh, fuck, man.  We're going to have fun with meat.  Loaf.  Yes.  O.B. and Anthony.  Does it kick in?  No.  Unfortunately, it doesn't.  I think the loop is right about there.  No.  Yeah.  There, there, there.  So what's going on with this diplomat? 
[01:25:00]  Fucking smoking on a plane, huh?  Oh, I can't stand these fucking diplomats.  Does the rest of the country deal with diplomats?  Oh, yeah.  We deal with them in America, in Manhattan.  They're everywhere.  New York City, we deal with them a lot because the UN is here, so...  You see the diplomat plates on a car?  The best thing you can do is stay as far away from them as possible because they can pretty  much run over children on the sidewalk and nothing will happen to these guys.  With impunity.  Yeah.  This guy was from Qatar. 
[01:25:30]  I've heard it called Qatar.  I've heard it called a few other places.  I call it Qatar.  Is that the Q one?  Yeah.  It's the Q place.  Q-A-T-A-R.  And he's on a plane, and they start noticing smoke coming out of the bathroom on the plane.  Well, that would be a reason to panic, right?  So there was a couple of air marshals on the plane.  Nice.  So they get up to check out the scene, and here comes this guy, this guy from Qatar, and 
[01:26:00]  they ask him, what's he doing?  And he says, oh, I was trying to light my shoe on fire.  He made a joke.  Like making a shoe bomb joke.  That's hilarious.  So they pounced on him and took him into custody.  They should have thrown him outside.  And then they had to let him go because he's got what's called diplomatic immunity.  So they sent him back home, I guess.  What does that mean, though? 
[01:26:30]  That means you can break all the rules?  Yeah, it means you can do whatever you want unless you're an American overseas, and then  when you do something there and you're a diplomat, then you get your head cut off.  They could do anything, though?  Nah.  Is there some things that we'd get arrested for?  Yeah, big crimes, murder, rape, things like that.  But there have been rapists that have gotten off the hook using diplomatic immunity and using  Really?  Yeah, they kind of shuffle them out of the country and non-extradition countries they  send them to and things like that. 
[01:27:00]  But yeah, I never understood this diplomatic immunity thing.  You must adhere to the laws of the land.  I understand the reason for it.  What is it?  Basically, because a lot of these guys have votes in the UN and things like that, and  what would happen is if you're able to be arrested for things, you could arrest people, which would  stop them from getting somewhere to vote.  You could influence a lot of things by arresting people, or you could, it's just a lot of bad  things could happen.  That doesn't sound very, you know, on the up and up. 
[01:27:30]  They take advantage of the fact that they have that on their side.  I mean, you know, like I said, you see the diplomat plates, and they're just parking in  areas you're not supposed to park, and no one's allowed to touch them, and they double  park.  They're just animals.  They go through red lights.  They don't care.  Yeah, there has to, I mean, for like, you know, for murder, I think for like certain felonies  they can be arrested, for certain things.  Like, you can't come into violent rape as a diplomat and not be arrested.  Right.  You can be arrested for that.  But it's like, there's certain ones, somebody obviously will know more than me, I'm sure. 
[01:28:00]  An NYPD guy would know.  But there are, like, they can't pull you over if you have traffic tickets or whatever  and arrest you for that.  No.  Because then you could influence too much by arresting the guys from China.  All right, here we go.  We got, yeah, we got a few calls coming in already.  We got Rick in New York City.  Rick.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, Rick.  Hey, what's going on?  Listen, here's the fucking deal.  Thank you for letting me on, by the way.  Welcome aboard, Rick.  Right.  Yes, right on.  Fucking, all right.  So I got this, my pops works down in their shell, and I guess the fucking diplomat was 
[01:28:30]  up in New Rock fucking, driving around all drunken, being an asshole.  He hits a dude on the back of a garbage truck, dragging for about a thousand feet.  The dude smashes his head on a fire hydrant, and they send this motherfucker back to his  country without doing a goddamn thing about it.  It enrages me.  It makes me want to just, ah, goddamn it.  Yeah, they just deported him.  Yeah.  What is the motive behind it, though?  I mean, was I kind of correct, or was I totally off?  I'm sorry?  What's the motive behind not arresting him? 
[01:29:00]  Diplomatic immunity.  He probably doesn't know.  We'll have to find out.  It doesn't sound like he knew.  Look at the story Danny's got up on the screen, eh?  Deputy Ambassador of the Republic of Georgia to the United States.  Gregorio?  What's his name?  That's not Gregorio.  Some fucking big, long Russian name.  He caused an accident in January 1997 that injured four people and killed a 16-year-old  girl.  He was found at a blood alcohol level of 0.15%.  Is that good? 
[01:29:30]  That's good, right?  That's over the limit.  That's nice, right?  Yeah, that's buzzing.  But was released from custody because he was a diplomat.  The U.S. government asked the Georgian government to waive his immunity, which they did, and  Makalashivasa was tried and convicted of manslaughter by the U.S. and sentenced to 7 to 21 years  in prison.  However, after serving three years of his sentence, he was returned to his home country  where he spent two more years in jail before being paroled.  So I guess they can waive that whole diplomatic immunity thing.  So I guess the 16-year-old girl only has to be dead for three years? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Well, he did five.  Three plus two.  So she's dead for five years, then she gets to come back to life too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  She's got death immunity.  Do you understand that death sentence?  That death thing?  You kill somebody and you only do a few years in jail?  I don't understand that.  No.  It seems to be cut and dry.  You take someone's life, your life should be spent in prison.  I don't get it.  Well, you know what?  Unless it's some...  When it's the obvious, holy shit, you just decided to snuff out this person's life and 
[01:30:30]  they get to walk free someday.  I don't get that.  The legal system is fucked.  There's a prime example of it.  After the wilding that went on here on Easter Sunday in Manhattan.  We've been talking about that the last few days.  A bunch of black youths ran rampant around Times Square shooting guns off and assaulting  people and whatnot.  Knocking over mailboxes.  Driving through people's backyards.  Had a girl in the car.  That's a man act. 
[01:31:00]  The guy that did some of the shooting...  Just shot into a crowd.  Yeah, shot into a crowd.  Like he just didn't care to start shooting into a crowd.  Yeah, they finally arrested him.  And it turns out that a couple of years ago, he had done the same thing.  He shot into a crowd and shot somebody in the ankle.  And they plea bargained it to attempted possession of a weapon.  Attempted possession of a weapon.  But he had the weapon. 
[01:31:30]  He had one because he shot someone with the fucking thing.  So he was sentenced to a year in, I believe, August of 2007, I think it was.  I'm not sure of the year.  By September, he was out.  Jesus.  And got himself another get.  How does that make sense?  It doesn't.  This guy shouldn't have been on the streets.  If the courts did the right thing, then guess what?  This guy isn't shooting into a crowd this past Sunday.  The police are out there doing the right thing.  They're arresting these motherfuckers. 
[01:32:00]  And they are, too.  And then the court just lets them go.  They listen to these fucking defense attorneys that plea bargain.  And they talk about, oh, well, we're so full and we got so much fucking work.  Yeah, well, work.  It's called work.  Do it.  Right.  Look through the papers.  See if these motherfuckers have so many priors that it's ridiculous.  And then put them in jail.  Fix the system. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  But no, they say, all right, we'll plea bargain it down to attempted possession of a fucking firearm.  What is attempted possession?  I don't know.  It means you tried to get one.  You tried to get a gun illegally.  But he had it in his hand.  He did.  That's called a plea bargain.  So they plea it down.  It's ridiculous.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  Okay.  We got a guy, Greg in D.C.  Oh, D.C. cop.  Right on.  What's up, Greg?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, I deal with this stuff all the time in D.C. with these diplomats. 
[01:33:00]  I bet.  It's ridiculous.  On the embassy ground, you can't even go near their embassy.  As long as we actually chased a guy, ran back to his embassy.  Yes, we caught him peeping in someone's window.  What is it, a game?  They fucking just run in and you can't touch him.  Diplomat is peeping into someone's window.  So here's Greg and his boys.  They see it.  They see this going down.  So they do the right thing.  They chase him.  And he gets back to the...  He runs to home base.  It's like fucking tag.  Home base.  It's sovereign soil of the country that they came from, an embassy. 
[01:33:30]  So you can't go there.  It's like going into their country.  Yeah.  One agency can go on there and that's Secret Service and Secret Service only.  Yeah, but unless it's some kind of Secret Service jurisdiction, it doesn't matter, right?  Yeah, that's right.  Unless he's counterfeiting money or trying to do harm to our politicians, I guess.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  That's about it, boys.  Just wanted to throw that one in there, boys. 
[01:34:00]  I'm going to punch out.  All right.  That's unbelievable.  Well, here's the story about the guy from Qatar on the plane.  A diplomat from Qatar who was apparently trying to sneak a...  This guy again.  Yeah.  ...smoke in an airplane lavatory triggered a bomb scare on board a commercial flight from Washington to Denver.  No one was hurt.  No explosives were found.  The man is now identified as Mohammed Al-Madadi.  Officials say the incident put law enforcement on high alert and fighter jets were even scrambled  to bring the United Airlines jet, carrying nearly 160 passengers, into the Denver International Airport safely. 
[01:34:30]  Two law enforcement officials say the man was asked about the smell of smoke in the bathroom  and he joked he had been trying to light his shoes, a reference to the 2001 shoe bomber Richard Reed.  Hours after the plane landed, the man was still being interviewed by investigators.  The passengers were all sequestered and interviewed as well.  The way he described it, he was kind of chuckling about it.  And he said he probably tried to... 
[01:35:00]  They thought maybe he tried to ignite something.  He says he probably was trying to smoke or something.  It's not clear yet what, if any, charges the man will face.  Sorry, we have ADD on this program.  They're doing the fat fucking montage.  Fat B-roll.  Fat B-roll on TV today.  They record fat people from the neck down so they don't have to get their permission  to use their fat, disgusting bodies when they do a fat story on the news.  It's one of my favorite things the media does.  The fat B-roll.  I don't even know what the story was, but it was a whole bunch of people that have bellies. 
[01:35:30]  Pull some fat file footage.  We need the fat fuck B-roll thing?  What was that story?  I don't know, whatever.  That was the story of the guy smoking in the lavatory.  Someone, CKE25 on Twitter, just tweeted me, and he goes, if you thought airline carry-on  fees were bad, wait till you see this.  Go to CNN.com.  Airline considering fee for?  You want to guess?  Not crashing. 
[01:36:00]  Another fee.  This is beyond the carry-on luggage.  Yeah, they're doing the carry-on fees.  Those are bad.  Airline considering fee for something else.  On a plane.  A fee.  For something else.  I don't know if anyone's going to get this.  We are already paying for pillows and blankets.  Extra leg room we're paying for.  Already paying for, yeah, seats, snacks, and beverages. 
[01:36:30]  Let's see, an extra charge for...  Considering.  Considering.  Extra charge for a window seat.  I think they sort of...  Aisle seat.  They're doing exit row.  You'll spend more on an exit row.  Yes.  So that's sort of out there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know if you're going to get this.  How about...  I think.  This is ridiculous.  Direct TV on certain flights.  They're charging six bucks for that.  They're charging...  Wi-Fi?  Getting on and off the plane first. 
[01:37:00]  Mm-mm.  Oh, I like that, yeah.  Oh, that would be a great one.  I'd pick that.  A little easy pass action on the plane.  A toll on the fucking jetway.  A toll.  Toll.  Toll.  Toll.  Toll.  Toll.  Airport fee?  Littering and.  Littering and.  I mean, you're warmer.  You fuck.  I hate saying.  Toll.  Are you done?  A tax?  No, I'm not going to talk.  I'm just yelling words.  Toll.  It's something on the plane.  No way. 
[01:37:30]  Bathroom?  Bathroom.  Are you kidding me?  Go to CNN.com.  Where's Danny?  We don't have him.  A bathroom charge?  Kenny, could you type CNN.com over there?  They're considering a fee for lavatory use.  I've got the story in here.  Oh, wait, Travis, you got this?  Yeah, it's Ryanair in Ireland and Europe.  They would charge $1.50 to use the bathroom.  It would be a coin-operated bathroom.  A coin-op bathroom.  What the fuck?  On a plane.  Really?  Yeah, for flights that are an hour or less. 
[01:38:00]  To encourage people to use the bathroom in the airport.  Guess what?  You're on a long flight.  You're going to have to use a bathroom.  What fucking pieces of shit?  Talking about short flights, but Ryanair.  Why?  What's the problem with passengers using a bathroom on a plane?  That they want to encourage you to take a leak before you get on board?  The plan is titled the Ryanair Cost-Saving Proposal.  Because most people do take a leak before they go on a plane because they don't want to deal with an airplane bathroom.  What is so cost-saving about people not, like, pissing? 
[01:38:30]  It's fine with flushing.  They would remove, apparently they have, like, three bathrooms on their flights, and they would remove two of them.  And put more seats in.  To put more seats in.  Exactly.  Oh, jeez.  I would piss on the seats that used to have a bathroom.  How about...  Where somebody's sitting and going, oh, I'm sorry.  Last time I flew, it was a bathroom here.  That's why I shit in your lap.  I would piss right in my seat.  Just start pissing yourself.  What can they do?  Fuck it.  Then change when I get to the hotel and go, well, there you go.  I couldn't hold it, and I didn't have change. 
[01:39:00]  I'm sorry.  According to the article, they're also selling diapers on the plane.  Oh, Jesus.  No, no, leave the mic there.  Don't put it down.  Are they really?  Papa, puppy!  No, I just made that up.  You.  You're a card.  You're a card.  I'd love to tell Jerry that one.  Mm-hmm.  From yesterday.  Of course.  Oh, dumb Tom Papa, by the way.  I saw him last time.  I'm like, we didn't put your thing on.  He's like, it was 11, so we didn't miss his Martha Stewart thing.  Oh, okay.  Oh, really?  He said she was flirting with him.  Really? 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  Come on.  True.  She probably likes him.  He's handsome.  He's in good shape now.  It really annoys me.  Come on.  Oh.  He's good arms.  Oh, I am.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, it has nothing to do with it.  Let's see the pressure of this thing.  Okay, let me say hi to Brian in Dallas.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  So this piece of shit CEO, Leary for Ryanair, he's been talking about this pay toilet thing  for like the last five years.  What he's really pushing for is standing room on the plane so he can squeeze more people in. 
[01:40:00]  Like a fucking subway where you got to hold on to a strap or a fucking rail or something?  That's basically what he's trying to do.  Sounds safe.  Fucking people projectiles.  The carry-on baggage fee thing?  Spirit Airlines is like the Greyhound of the skies.  They fly a bunch of Mexicans down to the Caribbean and to other places, but they've got like  20 planes and nobody will follow this carry-on baggage. 
[01:40:30]  I only fly fancy airlines.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the fancy airlines are starting to do all this horse shit, too.  Not for elite members or not.  Yeah, elite members.  I'm still getting that.  They're not fucking with platinum or gold members or...  Yeah, but the average person isn't one of those.  Well, fuck them.  The average man.  We talk for the average man.  They're getting fucked out there.  They always get fucked.  Are they?  Are they?  More and more fucked.  As I look at the front page of Drudge and see Rob Thy Neighbor, half of households pay 
[01:41:00]  no income tax.  Half of the households in the United States of America pay no federal income tax.  Half.  Why?  That's not possible.  Blow me, you motherfuckers.  Good.  Pay through the nose for your flights.  I'm going to be sitting sipping a cocktail.  That's right.  Paying more.  Watch me.  Look at me fucking as I have my bloody Mary and you go into the fucking cattle section 
[01:41:30]  of the plane.  Blow me, you not taxpaying fuck.  Do you only fly first?  Yes!  I don't care where I'm going either.  I'll fly first to Boston.  I don't give a shit.  Up, down, good.  That's like a half hour flight.  I am a fucking idiot.  Up, down, good.  And you want a lot of service in that half hour, don't you?  I certainly do.  I can down a lot of beverages.  As soon as the cabin door closes. 
[01:42:00]  I'd like a beverage!  Bloody Mary, please.  But sir, it's only a 25-minute flight.  Keep them coming!  But sir, it's only a 25-minute flight.  I know, and I'm done with this one you just brought me.  We have a lot to do.  But sir...  Napkin for my pre-com stewardess.  What a fucking asshole.  I don't care.  I'm fancy.  Up, down, good.  I just got an email from Continental.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, in last class where you gotta purchase beverages, it's going up a dollar from five 
[01:42:30]  to six.  Six bucks now for a beverage?  Yeah.  For beer.  For alcohol.  That was a few years ago.  That was strip club prices.  Jesus Christ.  Now it's like nine, ten.  I understand they're offering discounted wing seating.  Are they?  Yes, where they have little chairs on the wing.  That's gotta be...  You have to hold on.  Hold.  So you don't get blown off the wing.  Imagine that, somebody with a hat on the wing who's waving at them.  You just slick out the window.  Oh, boy, it's a cheap seat.  Saved eight bucks.  Decided to risk his life. 
[01:43:00]  Eight bucks?  It's a man on the wing.  But, well, all right, so I have to household his household's not paying taxes, Anthony.  That's gotta be very, like, lower...  No, it's not only lower class.  It's not only lower class.  You're not talking about our audience.  It's, it's, yes, yes.  You're saying half our audience isn't paying income tax?  No, no, no, no.  I'm not talking about half our audience.  I'm talking half of American households.  They're not paying income tax.  So what is that group?  It's, uh...  Is it lower, lower class?  47% pay no federal income tax at all for 2009. 
[01:43:30]  Their incomes were either too low or they qualified for enough credits, deductions, and exemptions  to eliminate their liability.  So, if, if they have kids, uh, they, um, can deduct a fuckload, uh, if they're low, and  even lower middle class, um, are not making enough money, I guess, or they've redone some  of the tax laws where you don't have to pay.  Now, to me, I don't give a shit if you fucking are low, lower class. 
[01:44:00]  You're, you're not making...  Whatever money you make should be fucking taxed.  Something should come out of that.  It's, it's 70 fucking 10% of our population is paying 75% of the taxes.  Unbelievable.  That, that is not fucking right.  Did you get your tax, uh...  Oh, I got it yesterday.  Can I tell you something?  What?  And I had the same, uh, tax guy.  Yeah.  My tax, FedEx, package arrived... 
[01:44:30]  What day is this?  So, I got it before I went to Rochester.  So, over a week ago?  Yeah.  It's just sitting there on a table.  Did you open it?  No.  I, I just...  I'm too scared to open it.  I just opened mine.  What is it?  He prepared my taxes for the year.  Like, you know, it's a nice, nice little privilege we got.  And, uh, it's just, it's been sitting on a table in my apartment for over a week.  I'm too scared to open it.  And I'm, and I'm watching the calendar and I'm like, oh boy, I gotta get this in.  I gotta open this soon and see the damage. 
[01:45:00]  I'm too scared to see the damage.  You're not gonna be that scared this year.  Really?  Only because we paid a fuckload quarterly.  Now, this is personal.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Okay.  We still paid a fuckload quarterly.  So, it's not gonna be that bad?  So, you're gonna be pleasantly surprised.  But it doesn't mean we didn't pay taxes.  It means we paid a fuckload over the course of the year already.  Well, because of our situation, we have to pay quarterly and we have to...  Every three months we pay taxes.  And we have to estimate.  We're allowed to talk about this a little bit, right? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, we have to estimate.  So, they estimate how much we owe and then, uh, you hope by the end of the year that they  overestimate it.  So, you're saying we might overestimate it for once?  Yeah, but that only goes to show that we made shit this year.  Yeah, we did.  And they were still taking out what they estimated what we used to make.  Let's talk to the audience for a second.  We really didn't make much money.  But now that we work, uh, here, um, and we make dog shit, um, the tax on dog shit is  less, but we're still putting in like we were making money like we used to. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, so it could be good.  So...  I've been scared to open this thing.  Yeah, crack it open.  Crack it open.  All right, I'll have a report tomorrow.  But that doesn't mean...  But believe me, we...  I already know what I pay.  Yeah, exactly.  But what always used to hurt was knowing all the money we paid quarterly, and now we're  going to get the...  But, and then getting another fucking, uh, bill on top of that.  Wait, though.  Which used to drive me nuts.  There's, there's, uh, there's a good side and a bad side to the taxes.  The good side is... 
[01:46:30]  I'm not opening it.  The good side is federal.  Because we, we paid through the nose already.  Right.  Federal.  State.  State went up so fucking much.  We are being raped by the state of New York.  Wait till you see what the state is.  You're going to love it.  We're paying for all kinds of shit, and they're still in debt.  Cocksuckers.  Is this true, John in Georgia?  John?  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  What's up, John?  You're yelling about Spirit Air's $45 carry-on fee?  They have what they call their Super Saver flights, like, half the month every year. 
[01:47:00]  You can fly from, like, Atlanta to Miami for $9.  You can fly from Miami to just about anywhere they fly for no more than $30.  See, that scares me, too.  You know?  Yeah.  When you can get on a plane for, like, $30, you kind of wonder about the organization.  It's kind of a catch-22, you know?  We all want to fly relatively cheap, but...  Yeah, there's a balancing act.  It's a $9 flight, man.  I don't know. 
[01:47:30]  I'm not thinking $9 that they're going to be able to pay the mechanics to turn a few  nuts and bolts that need turning.  Right.  That's scary, too.  You want somewhere in the middle, right?  Yeah.  There was a pretty good phone call.  Oh, this guy.  Is this true?  Greg in Boston.  Greg?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  So, I've flown around here a couple times, and they did a few things to save money.  One of the things they do is they remove the seat back pocket, and they pay speed, that 
[01:48:00]  little flying information car that nobody reads on the back of the seat in front of you,  and they say they did that so they don't have to pay people to clean out the pockets at  the end of the flight.  They also don't use jet waves because it takes too much time to load and load.  Right.  So, you get off on the stairs that they wheel up.  Wait, what airline is this?  This is Pan Air.  Pan Air?  But the flight's called.  This is the one that wants to charge for the bathroom.  But the flight's called.  It's nothing.  I flew two people from Dublin, Ireland, to London for, like, $30 American dollars round 
[01:48:30]  trip.  You know?  Flights are like a dollar.  They just charge you for anything that you want to do, you know, that's not just sitting  in a seat and putting a carry on.  You know what?  And we're putting up with this, so they're going to end up charging for everything.  You're going to have a menu as you walk up to get your ticket.  Yeah, it's going to be like an a la carte thing.  It's going to be an a la carte.  What do you want?  You got a bag?  Would you like this?  Do you need a beverage? 
[01:49:00]  Because there's nothing we could do.  We just got to take it.  So, it'll be an a la carte.  You want this?  You want that?  You want a seat?  That's going to cost you an extra hundred.  Can you fly?  Dude, then you're going to fucking...  You want use of a bathroom, that's going to cost you.  You want a little beverage?  You want a little blankie?  You want this?  You want some fucking headphones?  You want blah, blah, blah?  Flap your arms if you don't want to pay.  And there's nothing...  See where that gets you.  It drives me nuts.  There's nothing we could do as people in this country.  We just got to take whatever they throw at us. 
[01:49:30]  That's it.  That's the most discouraging and frustrating part of this.  And if we didn't have a radio show, I'm telling you, I think I would go insane over  all this stuff.  I would just go insane.  At least there's some kind of outlet that could yell.  Yell, scream a little bit, and get all that frustration out, right?  Get all mad at everything.  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.  I'm not going to take it anymore!  I'm not going to take it anymore!  Anymore!  Go to your windows!  Fucking loaded that...  Fuck, tax day is right around the corner.  What day? 
[01:50:00]  15th, I guess?  15th.  A week from today, I got to open up that envelope?  Damn, yeah, crack that thing open.  Fuck.  You'll be all right.  You'll be all right.  Because you already fucking got raped.  You already got raped.  Your asshole hurt.  You did the fetal position in the shower.  And now it's time to try to move on.  I pay mines.  I paid mines.  This is where Ann and I are different.  I sort of don't mind.  Sort of.  There's part of me that does.  But I don't want to be able to choose where my money goes.  It's too much, and it's too much money, and they want more, is what kills me. 
[01:50:30]  That's what kills me.  Imagine if the government said, okay, you're going to have to pay this much, but then you  get to decide where the money goes.  Like, I'd rather help out my entire family than people I don't know and raise them up  a little bit.  Yeah.  I raise them up a little bit anyway.  But if I was able to take the money that I have to be forced to give the government  every year and push it on to people I love in my life, that would be a cool thing.  Well, now Obama's trying to get the value-added tax thrown in. 
[01:51:00]  What's that?  Which is great.  It's a tax that goes along and is passed along through every step of a product's life.  So if you have a car, and the car company has to order bumpers from somewhere, another  company, the tax comes from the bumper, and then it's taxed to the...  It also gets taxed from the car company, and it gets taxed from the person that buys the 
[01:51:30]  car, and it gets taxed...  Like, they just...  They tax it through the entire step of the...  Of every step that it takes.  We probably sound like a broken record, but it's worth repeating.  You...  You have a job.  Yeah.  They take taxes out.  Yeah.  Then you take that measly little money you got left.  Little measly money.  You put it in a fucking bank, and then they tax it again.  They tax it again.  They tax it when you spend it.  And then they tax them, yeah, when you're spending.  Yeah.  Like, you already got taxes taken out of your money.  And then the biggest joke of all is when you drop fucking dead, they tax everything 
[01:52:00]  you had when you died.  Right, right.  So everything that you had that's already been taxed, and maybe you want to leave it to  your family, they tax the fuck out of that, too.  At a huge rate, by the way.  You can't even fucking get away from it when you drop dead.  That's amazing.  Cocksuckers.  And we just sit here and take it, because there's nothing we can do.  That's why.  Nothing.  Spend, spend, spend.  Good luck getting it, motherfuckers.  I want a penny. 
[01:52:30]  I want a penny to fucking flick into the hole in the ground when my coffin gets dropped  in.  Just flick my last penny on top of it.  And they could go screw.  You know, we got all these people bitching about taxes.  Why don't we keep it light today?  Light and airy.  Yeah.  Shit porn.  Like a coleslaw.  We'll try.  Shit porn.  We can talk about taxes next week when it gets a little closer.  I was terrible last night with porno, man.  Yeah?  And all I kept thinking was-  It's how easy it is to switch subjects in this room. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I know, right?  You just say shit porn and taxes are out the window.  I was really bad with porn.  Were you talking about taxes?  I forgot.  All I was thinking of is what Jimmy said, because I went to bed relatively early, and it was  about, I guess, 11 o'clock.  I went to bed.  I didn't get to sleep until 2 in the morning, because I was just sitting up in bed, looking  at pornography for three hours, going like, wow, the time is really flying, and I should 
[01:53:30]  probably go to sleep.  Were you doing a slow jerk?  You know, every so often you reach down, give a little tug, find something new to look  at, a little tug, just keep it going, keep it going, and then edging, yeah, edging, and  then you find a real good one, and then you've got to keep your hands off.  You go, oh, almost went too far.  God forbid I cum and go to sleep.  It's fucking, you know, not 2 in the morning yet.  Do you know what I do when it gets really late?  Like, if I'm going to cum, I'll actually take the paper towel and put it on my stomach 
[01:54:00]  and actually cum onto it.  A cum bib.  Your cum bib.  But it's just, it's one of those things, it's like, what am I doing?  Why don't I just go to sleep?  I know.  It's impossible.  I went to bed early, and I'm thinking to myself, I was like, oh, good, it's 11 o'clock,  I'm tired, so I'll probably just fucking crap out.  I won't be tired for the show, which I'm not.  It wasn't that bad.  I napped and everything, but I could have been, like, you know, asleep by 11.15, and 
[01:54:30]  instead, 2 o'clock in the morning, I look at the clock and go, you know something, let's  end this, Anthony.  Let's just, you know, fucking follow through.  Follow through on the stroke.  What'd you wipe up with?  What the hell did I use?  Oh, a towel.  Does it matter what you wipe up with?  Just curious.  Towel.  I use a towel.  A little towel.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I had a really good sight, though.  With a lot of really good, yeah, like, videos like that.  Like, there's just great fuck videos out there now. 
[01:55:00]  That's really good.  What is that?  That are completely free.  And...  X Hamster?  That's good.  Yeah, X Hamster is a good sight, man.  But they'll ruin it by charging you.  I don't know.  There's a lot of free fucking porno out there, man.  A lot of free, good video clips.  Are the porn girls pissed?  Completion.  They gotta be pissed off at this point, huh?  Dude, I don't know who's buying porno anymore.  Why would you buy it?  It's everywhere.  You can get...  It's free.  And why do you need a full-length porno when you get these snippets that are like a minute, 
[01:55:30]  two minutes, three minutes long?  So you pick whatever amount of time you need.  Of course, you know, I was doing three-minute clips for fucking a thousand of them.  But Pat from Munaki was doing some edging the other day, Anthony, as well.  Oh, was he?  And his lawn looks lovely, so...  Edging.  Oh, he is.  From the curb and the grass line, yeah.  That does look great.  Edging.  We should take a break as we look at this. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, my God.  Who's that guy?  Hog McGillicuddy?  Hog McGillicuddy?  Wow.  That guy just pumped a load on this chick's back.  His dick is astounding.  He has a big dick, but the head goes way down.  It's bent, yeah.  It looks like he ran fucking really quickly into a wall.  Damn old lug wrench dick.  It's bent because it's hitting the back wall too many times.  So it's like his cock head's ashamed.  He's got his head down.  His cock head's being respectful.  The anthem's playing.  This is romantic. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I got some music for the porn.  Do they have rubber on the couch?  Yeah.  Or like plastic bags?  Yeah.  Yeah, because that guy just comes like a fucking fire hose.  I'll say he does.  Jesus.  Jesus.  He's got the hands on hip stance.  Don't you hate when you're watching something like this and you're coming and all of a sudden  you start yelling, lucky girl?  Last night it wasn't so much fucking and stuff.  One night I just watched a shitload of handjob videos.  Oh, those are great.  You like handjob videos? 
[01:57:00]  I'll watch anything.  Yeah.  But it was chicks giving guys like handies and some of these, Jesus Christ, dude.  Some of these chicks would just like take their thumb and barely rub underneath the head  of the dick and the guy just explodes.  Fucking loses his mind.  Good handjob.  It's nice.  Perfect timing on that line, eh?  Well, always.  Good handjob.  And then I was watching girls, just girls, laying completely nude on a bed, masturbating. 
[01:57:30]  That would do nothing for me.  No, because if they look into the camera, it's like they're looking at you.  Well, they are looking at you.  And that's kind of cool.  I like that kind of, you know.  Fem dom ham jobs.  Uh-oh, these are not going to be nice.  Fem dom.  Yeah.  What a nice.  What a good girl.  That's good to watch a good fucking five-inch or get jerked.  You ain't fucking porn cocks.  Yeah, really?  What the fuck is that?  You need porn cocks, Jimmy.  It's nothing sexy about watching a chick who can grip the cock and then her hand just  slips off it.  What is she doing?  She's plugging up the tip. 
[01:58:00]  Don't do that.  She'll back it up.  Yeah.  You guys know who's singing this?  Yes, I do.  Is this the fucking chubby Taiwanese guy?  Taiwanese guy.  Taiwanese.  This fucking video is going viral.  It has the worst haircut ever.  Yeah.  From a show called Superstar Avenue.  Nailing Whitney Houston's song.  Whitney can't do this anymore because she's all fucked up. 
[01:58:30]  This is a dude.  I know.  What the fuck?  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  Something tells me he doesn't like girls.  No.  What a fucking retard haircut he has, too.  Oh, my God.  That is all Mo. 
[01:59:00]  Mo from The Three Stooges here.  Wow.  Great.  How old is he?  I don't know.  He's either 8 or 35.  You can't tell.  You're right.  He's every extra from M.A.S.H.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Opie and Anthony.  Meatloaf is going to be on the show in about an hour.  Are you looking for some hard, hot action?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have a big one, Heather.  Let me swallow that fucking dick down my throat. 
[01:59:30]  I'm going to put it in you.  Oh, yeah.  And just give it to you until you're dead.  Are you looking to get turned on like a light bulb?  Oh, my pussy is so wet.  It's dripping now.  I want you to be so wet that it looks like a lake down there.  The Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium will connect you one-on-one for a private  party with the man himself.  I'm going to spank you, madam.  You've been very bad.  You killed an old lady with a hammer, and I'm going to spank you. 
[02:00:00]  Spank it hard.  It's the wildest all-live action with one hot, developmentally disabled entrepreneur  with a mustache.  I'm going to lick the little man on the boat until my tongue is chapped and dry and  smells.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my quick, that was swollen.  I'm going to come see him.  That's right, madam.  I'm going to make you cum so hard that people are like, hey, there's a Niagara Falls in that  lady's underpants.  You're in for one meaty overtime.  Yeah, I'm going to cum on your face. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, squeeze my hair.  I want you to cum so hard that your cancer wing falls off.  Oh, my God.  Rub it quicker.  Rub it so fast that people think it's lazy.  Just sit back, relax, and whip it out.  Until you're cumming like nobody's business.  It's the Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium.  The O.B. Anthony Show is now back on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, you guys hear about Kenyon Martin plays for the Nuggets? 
[02:01:00]  Nuggets.  Basketball player.  I know you're not into the hoops, Ant.  Yeah, that's right.  But the boys played a little April Fool's prank on the guy, and he was none too happy.  Got a little anguish?  Was not happy.  So there's audio that's making the rounds where he's yelling at the boys in the locker room.  Oh, yeah?  You want me to give away the prank, or you want to just...  No, let's hear it.  You want to hear?  Okay.  I don't know if you can tell from the audience.  Yeah, I know.  Well, then we'll play the audio, and then we'll explain what the boys did.  And then we'll play guessing games. 
[02:01:30]  We'll guess what the prank was.  I love guessing games.  And whoever gets it right gets their cock stepped on with heels.  Ow.  Yeah, he had this to say in the locker room.  Yeah, there's one thing.  There ain't no f***ing able to lose, man.  What a s***ing soul turn around this s*** up.  I swear to God, boy, when I find out who did it, I'm going to put my more f***ing hands on one of y'all.  Oh.  I ain't got time to talk right now.  Leave me alone.  Move with me.  Leave me alone, man.  So who else got access to the m**** in the locker room to take my keys? 
[02:02:00]  Whoever got access to this locker room, get it.  We didn't know I had some m**** right now, man.  Yeah, I'm dying.  I'm touching it right now.  Because I swear to you, I'm going to put my hands on whoever did it.  You can best believe that.  This s***ing person.  You best believe this s***er.  Wow.  You best believe he's going to put his hands on whoever's the m****.  He's not happy.  The guy's pulled a nice April Fool's prank on Kenyon Martin.  Probably a few of them.  He's not happy.  Basically, they filled up his car with buttered popcorn. 
[02:02:30]  Did he say something about the salt?  Yeah, he had a white leather interior on his truck.  And it was actually, they found out later, it was an ex-ball boy for the Nuggets that had access.  And he went, I guess while they were playing, it must have been.  Did he put his hands on him?  Would they fire him for it?  I don't know.  I think he was already an ex-ball boy.  And somehow he had locker room access.  Maybe he was in good standing still.  I don't know.  Did he put his hands on him?  I do not think he put his hands on the motherfucker.  But I did best believe that he would. 
[02:03:00]  He should have put his hands on the motherfucker, definitely.  Best believe.  Yeah.  Best believe.  He wasn't even a player?  Who the fuck, an ex-ball boy would do that to one of the stars of the team?  Maybe he was a dick.  I don't know.  It sounds like it.  I mean, popcorn, fine, but salt and buttered popcorn.  Someone didn't think out their prank.  Of course the guy's going to get mad.  Caramel popcorn.  And I'm sure he's driving a nice ride with some nice rims.  Oh, hell yeah.  Got some nice rims on that hoopty.  His white leather interior is stained with butter and salt and little popcorn seeds. 
[02:03:30]  Isn't that how much of a smell?  Oh, yeah.  It probably smells like the movies.  He probably can't even.  I don't know.  But I know that if he's driving, he probably talks loud a lot because he thinks he's in a movie theater.  Well, that's just a warm-up.  So you got that happening, which is nice.  Good luck on that one, Kenyon Martin.  I got a fucking half a ride, by the way, from those pornos we were watching.  There were some nice pornos being played during the break.  Yeah, there was some good stuff.  Yes, yes.  What is that, X-Hamster?  Yeah, X-Hamster.  Better than Red Tube? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, much.  And just so I don't feel like fielding messages later, it's X-H-A-M-S-T-E-R.  Yeah, come on.  So it's X-Hamster.  Yeah, there's no P.  It's not X-Answers.  Just there it is.  X-Hamster.  Hamster.  Is the hot website that they need to go on.  By the way, it is better.  Which is a fine site.  It is better that the car smells like popcorn than it smells like ****.  Oh, Jesus.  Are you trying to say there's an improvement in the smell of the car, Anthony? 
[02:04:30]  No, no.  I'm just saying it's popcorn would be better than if it smelled like ****.  Why do you have to lip sync it?  I never understand that.  It's radio.  It's a timing issue.  Oh, just a timing.  The beep has to be the right length.  See, if I said the popcorn would be better than the smell of ****, that's too long.  Do it right?  So I have to go.  Do it right.  See, popcorn is better than the smell of ****. 
[02:05:00]  That doesn't make sense.  Nipples don't smell.  Some of them do.  The fucking lip syncing rules.  He fucking lip syncs to match up the beep for everybody's enjoyment.  You're a whack job, dude.  I'm a professional.  The popcorn prank.  What the hell?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  You got a home invasion story?  Oh, you want to go there? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, I love those.  I got Scorch TV Raider Roll.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Let's see if we can do a home invasion any day, but we got Scorch TV.  That's a home invasion, too, if you have his channel on.  You feel invaded.  We got a – what's the setup, man?  Because we do have a lot of – hopefully we have a lot of new people checking us out this week.  I guess there's some kind of free preview going on.  Yeah.  I don't know about this.  When did that start?  It started on – technically Sunday.  It lasts for this week and next week.  Yeah.  Wow, really?  And all the serious radios. 
[02:06:00]  So we should be doing, like, some special things.  Well, we got to hook these people in.  We got the weekends special.  No one listens on weekends.  I think our brilliant talent just carries our – it just carries.  But this weekend is the worst of the satellite years.  Oh, oh.  Oh, really?  Instead of the worst of the week countdown.  Uh-huh.  Great.  It's going to be good.  Anyway, Scorch is – we worked with Scorch back in the oldie days.  This girl with a suitcase is trying to get our attention.  Who is she?  She's a friend of mine.  Tamara. 
[02:06:30]  She was waving to me.  What did she do?  She's a lawyer.  She's a tall drink of water.  But what is she doing here with her luggage?  She's doing radio.  She does red eye and she does radio.  She's a lawyer in Chicago and she does a lot of radio.  Did we have her in here?  No.  But she's a friend of mine.  So she was just texting me.  She was saying goodbye.  That's fine.  I saw her waving at everybody as she came through with her luggage.  And now she's leaving with her luggage.  All right.  Yeah, Scorch, we worked with him at WAF when, you know, first hooked up in the radio biz.  And Scorch worked there also. 
[02:07:00]  Well, we went on our merry way.  And he never did.  And had a pretty prosperous, pretty nice career going for ourselves.  Knockwood continues.  And he's been stuck in neutral ever since.  Yeah, and Scorch went nowhere.  Absolutely.  Well, he went somewhere.  One shitty market to the next shitty market.  To the next.  And apparently now what he's doing is producing and starring in his own TV show.  God damn.  We don't have our own TV show.  No, we don't. 
[02:07:30]  When you think about it this way, you guys went from Boston to New York.  And you're still stuck here in New York.  Oh, excuse me.  We went from Boston to New York and then from New York to Nationwide.  Yeah.  Sam.  Well, I was going to credit Scorch for going from Boston to Syracuse to Manch-Vegas.  Manch-Vegas.  Is he still calling it Manch-Vegas?  Yeah, that's what the locals call it.  Oh, I'm sure they do.  Manch-Vegas.  What's their slogan in Manchester?  New Hampshire?  I don't remember.  It should be, we suck.  Well, they're playing off the whole of what happens in Manch-Vegas. 
[02:08:00]  Manch-Vegas stays in Manch-Vegas.  What happens in Manchester, nobody hears about.  Yeah, no one cares.  So Scorch has a...  The home of herpes sores.  Scorch has a TV show.  Yeah.  But it's...  What he does is...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He started on public access.  Yes, he started on public access.  Which is kind of important to me.  What's the name of the program?  It's called PFG TV.  What does PFG stand for?  PFG stands for?  Pretty effing good.  And the effing is a bad word. 
[02:08:30]  It's a very bad word.  You can't say it on TV.  That means pretty f*** good.  Thank God for the beep.  Yes.  And the lip sync.  Yes, yes.  But he started...  Pretty f***ing good.  See?  He started on, like, public access doing it out of, like, a bar.  Mm-hmm.  And he's moved on since we last visited him.  Wow.  He's trying to do, like, a late-night talk show.  So this is taken off, I guess.  It's taken off in a major way.  What he does now is he solicits people to be, quote-unquote, sponsors. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  And then he uses that money to buy time on the My Network in New Hampshire.  So what he's doing is an infomercial.  Yes.  The show starts with, the following program has been paid for by private sponsors.  They do not reflect the views of Scorch.  Yes.  So what it is is, like, an ad for dick cream or anything that you'd see late at night.  F for the director.  Sorry, Ryan.  Just joking. 
[02:09:30]  I think it's important to get Brian.  That's right.  That's Scorch.  We're just looking at Scorch.  Wait, you know, he's wearing a white suit.  He's dressed like Pablo Escobar before he got shot.  And he's at a podium.  What's he doing?  That's the show.  That's his desk.  Oh, so he's sitting.  I'm sorry.  It's a desk.  He's sitting at a laptop.  Now, what he does is, like, he gets sponsors, like, one sponsor was this clothing company.  And he ended the plug with, their clothes are finally going to be going on sale.  They should be this week.  Uh-huh.  So it's sponsors like that that he obviously just goes up to them and he's able to talk to them as if he's a real show. 
[02:10:00]  And they take him seriously because they're as much of a joke as he is.  And then they give him money and he puts it in his pocket.  He doesn't pay anyone.  Of course.  Why would he?  No.  Now, I see him at a desk that looks like it just is a desk from someone's garage sale or a garage.  Well, he's since moved on from the desk.  I guess he thought it did look.  And now he uses a side table.  Oh, a side table.  And then he's got a couch where his guests sit.  That has to have a lot of jizz on it. 
[02:10:30]  And Nick, his guy on the couch.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a sidekick.  Yeah.  It's set up like a talk show on real television except it looks nothing like it.  No, yeah.  It's obvious.  It's a very cheesy version.  He's got a Toshiba laptop.  And instead of doing the smart thing where he sticks the PFG TV sticker over the logo on the laptop so it's as if it's a custom laptop.  He sticks it above the logo so you see both logos. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Of course he does.  Well, I bet you he got Toshiba to give him money or something.  He probably said.  Oh, that's true.  Am I having a seizure?  No.  Are you seeing him, like, jump around the screen?  What kind of fucking editing is he doing?  Oh, it's not.  I mean.  It's not good.  I thought I was having a seizure.  All of a sudden he was, like, standing up.  And then he popped it.  And now he's sitting back down.  What the hell's happening?  Can we start the show?  We've got to hear something.  I can't not hear this.  Andy.  I know.  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  It's a scorch man.  You know, I'm calling up to Howard.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  He does the whole thing, like, the snap the lads and everything like that.  It's corny.  It sucks.  And he does this other thing, the pause for the cause.  Yeah.  He sticks himself in the cage.  I think he tries to assault him once.  Oh, we did the pause in the cause thing.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that's why.  We were trying to get one of our fans to throw mustard or something.  Well, no, it worked.  That's why he doesn't call him the show anymore because.  What?  One of our fans threw yellow paint all over him.  Oh, they did?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Was he mad?  He was very upset. 
[02:12:00]  I don't think I'm any good, though.  So, like, Sam's got better audio than that.  Yeah.  Okay.  I now have a source in Mance Vegas who is sending me his show on a weekly basis.  Mance Vegas.  Does he hate this?  Does he hate this?  He doesn't.  No.  He still has a lot of love for the Opie and Anthony show, but he probably won't come on  the air because he knows that you guys will harm him.  Holy shit.  His YouTube clip has 33 views so far.  Are you kidding me?  Well, fuck, that's good.  It's because there's so many television viewers that they're like, ah, I've seen this on TV. 
[02:12:30]  That's true.  Why look at it on YouTube?  Who's a huge fan of Scorch?  Yes, I do.  Colin.  Colin Quinton.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Scorch and his TV show.  Everything that has to do with Scorch.  He loves it.  Colin loves it.  So, all right, Sam, cut up one of the shows.  Scorch starts the show.  It's the first day of spring.  And Nick on the couch will be hitting Nick on the coach or are you meant to say couch?  Nick on the couch will be hitting the streets soon.  Ah.  It's Scorch and PFG TV. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you pause for one second?  Yeah, exactly.  This already stinks.  Yeah.  Who's applauding?  Well, he has an in-studio audience, the crowd, he calls it, of approximately 10 to 11 people.  Uh-huh.  Where is the studio, by the way?  I believe the studio looks still to be a public access studio.  Uh-huh.  And then he records it at the public access studio, says that it's live, and then gives 
[02:13:30]  it to My9 and pays for the slot.  That would be the truth.  And the audience obviously can't, because he has like a local band on.  The audience is obviously friends of the band.  Oh, I see.  With no interest in what he's doing.  In what he's doing.  Well, of course.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, before we do anything else, first of all, you can continue clapping.  I like that, you know.  Jesus Christ.  Uh, today, this show here, ladies and gentlemen, is the first day of spring of 2010. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Winter, you can kiss my ace, baby.  You know what I mean?  Uh, you all know Nick Carter.  Terrible edit.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  And then it just stops.  You don't like it, Timmy?  No.  You're getting people riled up, telling old man Winter to kiss your ass.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, uh, you all know Nick Carpinelli, right? 
[02:14:30]  Everybody say hi.  Who knows him?  I don't know Nick Carpinelli.  What's funny is Nick Carpinelli, he still, he works in New Hampshire, and apparently  he started in Boston as Scorch's intern.  So Scorch likes to make a big deal that this is one of his intern success stories because  he's doing middays in New Hampshire.  Wow.  Where Scorch is doing afternoons.  Well, that is a big person.  Yeah.  You all know Nick Carpinelli, right?  Everybody say hi, Nick. 
[02:15:00]  Hi, Nick.  What's up?  Nick is our man on the couch.  Our beloved man on the couch, and soon enough, we're going to be doing something.  We're going to be featuring man on the couch.  We're going to be doing that man on the couch segment.  Soon enough, if you're watching at home, and you would like Nick to bring the portable  couch to your town, email us, and Nick will be doing the man on the couch street thing.  There are many things we can do on the couch.  There are a lot of things you can do on the couch.  Absolutely.  I mean, and some of them we can actually show on the TV show.  Some of them we can't, but we're still up for that.  Some of them will be on YouTube or YouPorn or one of the other things, you know what I 
[02:15:30]  mean?  We'll work that out later.  These guys have no clue that they suck in dick.  That's the beauty of this show.  What rapport?  This is what makes Scorch better than any person that's ever existed.  Yes.  He has no clue.  As much as he just bullshits and lies and he thinks, like, he's the definition of delusions  of grandeur.  Yeah.  Like, he believes every bit of bullshit that he says.  Oh, yeah.  He thinks he's awesome.  He thinks this is huge. 
[02:16:00]  The audience is standing.  Do you think he would tell me in Syracuse that when he was on afternoons on K-Rock, he used  to go to the mall and he had to stop going because people from the second tier in the  mall would be leaning over the rail and yelling, Scorch, Scorch.  Were they?  Really?  I mean, he was recognized once while I was in Syracuse working with him.  And he had this line that he always gave at restaurants or any time anybody asked him.  And the girl comes up to him and goes, hey, aren't you? 
[02:16:30]  Because his voice is distinctive.  And she goes, hey, aren't you on the radio?  And he goes, no, I'm sitting right here.  That was his line.  And he did it every time.  Of course, that was followed up by the girl saying, yeah, you're on K-Rock, right?  And Scorch had to say, no, I used to be.  But now I'm on.  No, I'm on PFG.  Rock 105.  PFG TV.  You think he believes that no one is saying hi to him in public because he's so famous  they just want to leave him alone? 
[02:17:00]  He's the type like people kind of just look at him when he walks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he knows.  He knows who I am.  Look at me.  Don't go up to him.  He's eating.  Let's move on with PFG TV, our old friend Scorch.  Scorch starts his weird news segment.  Yes.  Weird news is one of his go-to bits.  Like douche-er-dressing.  Yes.  And Sam, the sarcastic son of a bitch, writes,  in which he reads news stories and gives no punchlines.  He just reads the story. 
[02:17:30]  Before we do that, though, why don't we get into our segment that we call Weird News.  Some are on a Sunday rain story that are very strange.  Weird news.  Weird news.  Vail, Colorado.  What the fuck?  Was that supposed to be like weird science?  Yes.  Was he ripping off Paul Schaefer there?  He uses all his radio drops on the show.  Like half of the drops he uses on this show, he was doing in Syracuse on the radio.  This is what's awful about this show.  Besides the fact that he has an office chair, he has a fucking desk. 
[02:18:00]  It looks like something that your grandmother has in the beginning of her apartment to put a hummel on.  Yeah, like right by the front door of her apartment.  Very good, yes.  You put this against the wall.  With a doily.  And put hummels and a doily.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  This desk is terrible.  Mark from New Hampshire.  We got all the Scorch fans checking in.  Mench Vegas checking in.  Yes, Mark.  Yes, Mark.  Boys, happy birthday.  Do you should dress it?  Hi.  This guy is such a hack.  His editing is terrible on the PFG. 
[02:18:30]  And there you go to his radio show and you get his brain cell stimulator.  Oh, yeah.  He makes it sound like he has a screener, but he doesn't have the screener.  He records it on the commercial break, introduces their name, and then half the time they pick up the call  and he's already saying hello to him like he doesn't know who it is.  Wait, what's brain cell stimulator?  He's been doing it for years.  Yeah.  It's his go-to bit.  All it is is a trivia question, and he just asks it.  He goes, you know, a study says that guys think about this 90% of the time. 
[02:19:00]  So you think it's sex, but it's actually food or something like that.  Oh, my God.  And then he plays the music or he goes to commercials, and he answers the phones himself.  Yeah.  And then he comes back, he records the calls, and he goes, all right, Sam, pick up line three.  And then he plays the recording.  So it sounds like Sam the intern is picking up line three for him.  Oh, he's picking up line three.  And then a lot of times he just blows it by –  And he won't remember where he started the recording. 
[02:19:30]  So he'll go, Sam, pick up line three.  And then the recording will say, all right, Sam.  And then the recording will say it again.  Fucking squirts rules.  Do you think he has a good show?  I love Scorch's show.  He also does the – because he doesn't have a screener, so he asks the caller what their name is,  and then he'll introduce them by name when he comes back as if there was a screener,  which, to his credit, he said that you two invented.  What was it?  Giving the name before you pick up the call, Opie and Anthony first. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, wow.  A little credit from Scorch.  Thank you, Scorch.  But you took feels for meals from him.  Please tell everyone you don't know us.  It's a give and take.  Please.  He always tells people it's a give and take.  What a terrible –  You guys take his bits and he takes –  Yeah, you hear this, Jimmy?  It's a give and take?  Sam told us that years ago.  That Scorch goes that we've been just trading bits over the years with each other.  Oh, my God.  Don't do this, Scorch.  Instead of telling people that you took doucher dressing, his bit, and goofed on it –  We did it as a goof. 
[02:20:30]  He tells people that you took the bit.  Yeah.  That you took doucher dressing.  I'm proud to say that Opie and Anthony do doucher dressing.  You know, we trade.  We trade bits.  All right, Scorch, try this bit.  When we were in Syracuse and he was moving to New Hampshire,  he told me three months before he was moving to New Hampshire that he was going there.  It was done.  He knew in three months I'm moving.  He told – I was a free intern just – and I was coming back to New York anyway.  His sidekick that was counting on him to make a living,  he told him the night before their last show – 
[02:21:00]  Oh, by the way, Friday, that's our last show.  I'm moving to New Hampshire on Monday.  Thanks.  Why did he tell them last minute?  He didn't want to take them?  Or why did he do that?  Well, he wasn't taking them.  They probably didn't have a budget to bring Scorch's guys.  I mean, they paid Scorch bare bones,  so they weren't taking his sidekick to New Hampshire and he didn't want to –  Instead – and this is – he told his sidekick while he knew that he was going to New Hampshire  that he was sending out their tapes and not to worry about anything.  I would listen to Scorch.  You think he was sending their tapes out?  Not in one person. 
[02:21:30]  I would listen to Scorch every fucking day.  Who isn't?  I know he's going to play this audio.  See?  He doesn't love me.  I've gone home and listened.  He's streaming.  Right.  So if you're bored in the afternoons, you've got to just turn them on for 15 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Catch a little Scorch.  Let's do the weird news thing without the punchlines.  Weird news.  Vail, Colorado.  Neighbors noticing an unusual amount of traffic going in and out of Charles Guadalupe's house.  Well, it was Charles specializing in.  Charles was specializing in – actually, it's funny. 
[02:22:00]  He has no love for the lies.  Welcome, Matt, on his house.  Says, don't come back without a warrant.  They came back with a warrant, and he got busted for cocaine distribution.  Stupid bastard.  A guy got busted in Colorado?  That's weird.  What the fuck is weird about that?  Being more funny.  That's not weird news.  This is going great.  It's like, you know how Leno does headlines?  Yeah.  This is like that.  But Leno pumps it up with a little punchline.  And there's a punchline, and there's something weird, ironic, quirky about the story. 
[02:22:30]  I actually think –  A double entendre or something.  Leno saw Scorch do weird news and stole it and started doing headlines.  Yeah.  Scorch and his sidekick.  This is TFT TV, the podcast.  It's like Tippy Tom.  I've never heard two people with worse chemistry.  Yeah, yeah.  There's nothing there between these two.  Terrible.  There's a track on here.  They're the coach.  Well, why don't we try this one?  Scorch tells an interesting story with a killer punchline. 
[02:23:00]  This is part of the weird news segment.  And I would assume that the punchline is not a punchline or a killer.  I mean, it's a pretty good joke.  Interesting story, and this is a true thing.  This past weekend, I hosted a ring announcer for Mixed Martial Arts MMA.  This kid the other day, 26 seconds into the fight, the ring girl stood next to me.  They were like, he's running away.  And I'm too busy looking at the ring girls.  I wasn't looking at the fight.  But 26 seconds into it, this kid ran out of the ring. 
[02:23:30]  I've never seen anything like that before in my life.  The kid ran.  And this is, on my mom's life, true story.  26 seconds in, the ref said, we're going to call it ref stoppage.  It's really called something like afraid to fight or fear of the fight.  But the referee didn't want to embarrass the kid.  And I think in this situation, MMA must have stood for, move my ass.  Because this kid was like, wahoo.  Holy shit.  I know. 
[02:24:00]  And you have to.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Holy shit.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  That.  He had to keep reiterating that it was a true story.  Well, the awkwardness of the whole thing is that, like we said, there's, like, 11, 12 people sitting in the studio audience.  Yeah.  So there's deafening silence.  He can see every face. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Just looking at him and just staring and not laughing.  And he must have seen people looking like, are you kidding?  You ran out of the ring.  So he had to go, true story.  On my mother's life.  Yeah.  Somebody was pointing at him going, no, that's got to be a lie.  That can't be true.  I was only joking.  Yeah.  Wow.  That story is not interesting on any level.  None level.  It's called Fear of Fighting.  And MMA stands for what?  Move my ass.  Move my ass.  Oh, move my ass.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Okay, terrific. 
[02:25:00]  Does he think of these things at all before he says them?  Yes.  I think so.  He writes.  Nothing.  He's a great writer, Jimmy.  He writes.  Oh, shit.  He's going to use that sound clip now, too.  He used to try outlines on me on his sidekick and then do them on the air.  Please tell me you fake laughed.  I always do it.  His sidekick would get so pissed off because he'd be like, Scorch, that's terrible.  And I would every single time go, actually, dude, that's kind of funny.  The listeners are going to like that one.  Would you think it was funny?  Oh, my.  I love it.  You thought it was terrible?  It was always awful. 
[02:25:30]  His sidekick would be looking at me like, you're fucking me here, man.  That's great.  Because Scorch would believe you?  Yeah, he would believe me and he would do it with such gusto on the air.  Would he get a laugh?  Never.  Well, we move on, Anthony, with Scorch ending weird news with some trouble from the crowd.  What?  Yeah, like.  Does he have to handle hecklers or something?  No, I think he just.  This is early in the show and he's already getting a little frustrated that the crowd's not going with him on everything. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  They're all checking their iPhones.  Waiting for the band to come on.  Texting, yeah.  Texting.  And finally, if you're going to go to a Kmart to get supplies for your meth lab, there's two things.  A, don't shoplift.  And B, leave the meth lab at home.  Uh, this guy, Justin Hill of, well, where do you bring the meth lab?  Wait, what?  You can't just move a meth lab around.  But he goes, if you're going to get supplies for your meth lab at Kmart, A, don't shoplift.  B, leave your meth lab at home. 
[02:26:30]  So where do you think this story's going?  I have no idea, but probably nowhere.  That's what I would think.  That's your guess.  Nowhere.  This guy, Justin Hill of Warsaw, Indiana, originally just charged with shoplifting, but he's not that bright.  So he says, he told the cops, okay, my ID is in my van.  Can I go get it?  No problem.  The cops went over to him, went over to the van with the dude.  Of course, his van doubles as his meth lab. 
[02:27:00]  His van doubles as his meth lab, everybody.  Well, this is like the toughest big crowd I've ever seen.  Yeah, this is the biggest crowd, yet the toughest.  Not the toughest.  Wait, where were you expecting a laugh?  Yeah, what was it?  This is, you gave away the punchline, asshole.  Scorch is reading the news stories without writing a punchline and just figured at the end of the news story is where everybody would just get.  Now, now, you go, you go.  Now, really, let me think about this.  This is infuriating.  You sit there, you're telling a story. 
[02:27:30]  You go, so the guy said, my license is in the truck.  So they went over there, and they opened up the door, and the guy had a meth lab in the back of his truck.  Period.  And now he's expecting, like, applause and, like, woo!  And when he didn't get it, he was upset.  He said meth lab home.  Yeah, and leave the meth lab at home.  So he already said what was going on.  That's a punchline.  This is what he did.  He goes, you know, there's a couple of Jews, and they're bar owners.  And they walk into a bar, and they're the owners of that establishment. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  That's a tough girl.  Tough.  The best part is he says, this is our biggest crowd.  I wouldn't brag about that, because opening the show, it sounds like 10, 11 people.  When you just hear individual claps.  Right.  You don't want to acknowledge that you have a big crowd.  You can hear the one person chuckling.  Right.  It's not a big crowd.  It's not a big crowd.  Right.  Scorch.  Proud I've ever seen.  Yeah, this is the biggest crowd, yet the toughest crowd. 
[02:28:30]  The toughest.  So he's facing 20 years for manufacturing, and another five years for just being dumb.  And that is Weird News for today.  Some are honest, some are hate, so we tell it a very soon.  Weird News.  By the way, the Weird News, Ben.  Holy shit.  I can guarantee you it came from a prep burger service.  It's not an original.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't think it's an original?  No.  It came from prep burger.  It came from a morning jock prep page.  Well, guys, we're listening to Scorch's PFG TV show, and in this next clip, Scorch brags about all his viewers. 
[02:29:00]  This is my favorite clip of the entire show.  Oh, really?  So we should have saved it for last.  No, I mean, I put them in order of the way they broadcast for integrity.  Okay.  But integrity and these clips.  Stop.  This clip, this is Scorch.  This is the true.  All right.  This is what Scorch is.  This is him.  This defines him?  Absolutely.  Welcome back to Scorch's PFG TV, everybody, live on my network television in 26 gazillion homes. 
[02:29:30]  It's not live.  And by the way, just so you know, we've reached our 90th city coast-to-coast on cable as well.  So welcome to city number 90.  You know who you are.  And welcome to the London, England folks as well.  Yeah, I mean, that's going to be kind of cool.  Well, they've been on board since, what, about six or eight months ago?  Yeah, London jumped on board a little while ago.  So the show is definitely worldwide. 
[02:30:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Whoa!  Oh, my.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You don't say you know who you are.  You mention the city.  The 90th city.  Hold on, I got it.  Why would they know?  You're a liar!  Goddamn liar!  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  It's not network TV.  No, it's paid on one station. 
[02:30:30]  See, he doesn't have 90 cities.  He has one city.  One city, and it's Manchester, New Hampshire, and it's not London, England either.  He has .09 cities.  He has actually less than one.  He has a suburb.  So we got England on board about six months ago, was it?  About six months ago?  You know why?  Because he got a call from one guy who went, I like your show.  And went, oh, it must be more over in London.  England on board.  But this is what he used to do.  When Kevin Straley was working with XM, he would tell Pauly and me, Pauly as sidekick,  that he had these long conversations with Kevin. 
[02:31:00]  They came from the same hometown.  He made up details of the conversations that he had.  And every three months, he told us that three months later, he would be broadcasting on XM.  Yeah.  Always, he would tell us that.  In August, he said it would be Christmas.  In Christmas, he said they're holding off until March.  In March, he said summer.  He comes off like a compulsive liar.  Just lies.  He really does come off like a compulsive liar.  He invents in his head what he would like to happen and where he would like to be. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  And then he pretends it's reality.  So PFG TV is on in 90 cities.  And London.  And London.  The sad part is, when we were working with Scorch at AF, they got rid of him to bring in Rocco.  Yeah.  I want to listen to Scorch over Rocco.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they wanted, what, hamburgers?  And he was pizza?  Yeah, and he was pizza.  Yeah.  That famous fucking douche line from the dumb Petey who's doing nothing.  We want ham.  People have a flavor for hamburger.  And you're garbage.  And you're a garbage plate from his Tahoes. 
[02:32:00]  What he's banking on is the fact that a national show like this one won't expose anyone to PFG TV because people listening to this all over the country.  All over.  Since nobody has seen the show, obviously he can't be in 90 cities because there would have been one out of 90 that would have known that this show was on in their city.  Right.  At least.  All right, well, that's pretty obvious.  It's amazing.  That was a bunch.  That was just a lie.  Douchey clip right there.  Wow.  I say douche. 
[02:32:30]  Douche or liar.  Douche or dressing?  Douche or liar.  I say that was a douche.  Scorch does dating site disasters, another one of his bits, where he shows pictures of people and makes observations that are obvious and not terribly funny.  I want to do this thing called dating site disasters.  These are actual pictures of people.  Yes, exactly.  These are actual pictures of people that were on dating sites.  And it's like you've got to kind of wonder.  I'm a single guy, but you've got to kind of wonder. 
[02:33:00]  Look at these people, you know.  For instance, let's go to our first picture here.  Check this guy out.  Okay.  His site, his headline said, hello, I'm a serial killer.  I mean, look at this guy.  This guy's like, yeah, call my number.  Give me a call.  I'll meet you outside.  And they'll find your body in 13 different pieces in a lake.  So, hello, I'm a serial killer.  Excellent punchline.  Wow.  That is.  You see how he repeated it a few times because he started panicking because the crowd. 
[02:33:30]  Did the crowd go to the bathroom or something?  No, they were sitting there watching him.  They didn't go to get popcorn or something.  Said, hello, I'm a serial killer.  Did the whole crowd decide to have a cigarette outside at the same time?  It's everything.  It's the voice, the delivery, the material.  It's fucking terrible.  Nothing is working here.  Why is he saying I'm a serial killer and then just listing serial killer things?  He's saying I'm a serial killer again.  You're going to find a body chapped up in 13 pieces in a lake.  I'm a serial killer. 
[02:34:00]  Is this enraging, Jimmy?  This guy's good.  Chip likes him.  Found a bunch of body parts.  So he just shows a picture and then obviously.  He's saying that this picture came from a dating site.  This man's a serial killer.  He's on a dating site.  He looks a little crazy.  It's nuts.  He was crazy looking.  I guess.  Scorch shows another picture and displays the chemistry between him and his sidekick.  Have you liked his chemistry that him and his sidekick had?  Oh, good.  It's magic.  Wait till you hear this. 
[02:34:30]  Magic happens.  Next up, it would appear that you've got to do some acid or something.  Look at this girl who's banging a, what do you call the little animal there?  A Pikachu.  Thanks.  And so she says, what a trip it is to have relations with me and a Pikachu.  Look at that.  So she looks like Kelly Osbourne too, doesn't she?  No.  You don't think she looks like Kelly Osbourne?  I don't think I've ever seen Kelly Osbourne look.  Nick, put on your dollar store glasses.  Drink some Cabin Fever.  That is Kelly Osbourne.  After Cabin Fever, that would be Kelly. 
[02:35:00]  Well, no.  It would make a better looking than Kelly Osbourne.  Kelly Brock.  Okay, there you go.  Kelly LeBrock.  Absolutely.  Kelly LeBrock?  Yeah.  Is it Kelly LeBrock?  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Yes.  What's the candy company?  Is that just Brock's?  Yeah, I don't know.  High five wall.  It's key to left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  I'm not sure he was unable to reach it.  No.  No, see.  No, he caught it.  That was a disaster.  That wasn't a home run.  That wasn't a single.  That wasn't anything.  It was an out.  How do you go from Kelly Osbourne to Kelly LeBrock?  No, Kelly Brock.  And then Brock's candy.  Right.  Brock's candy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, because he had Nick to bounce off of.  Scorch.  I heard one guy.  I heard one guy uncomfortably laughing in the audience.  Yeah, he's a competitor.  I was just laughing at him. 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  Wow, that was really bad, that one.  Listen, 90 cities, London, England, can't be wrong.  And the 90th city, you know who you are.  You know.  Because there's a big banner on the TV station that says, we are the 90th city.  Yeah.  Why would anybody know that?  And wouldn't he have had a party for the 50th city?  Or the second.  Yeah.  The second.  Why don't we, well, that might have been like a fluke or something.  Yeah.  So we got Scorch trying another line here.  This will be the last clip from PFG TV. 
[02:36:30]  For today.  For today.  That's right.  We're bringing back this segment.  Big time.  Scorch or douche?  Douche.  Both.  Every time.  Exactly.  All of the above would be the answer.  Next up, how about this one?  Let's go on.  This one just basically says, hello, I'm a loser.  I got to see, except he says it like this.  That should be the intro to his show.  Dink me.  Dink me.  Any comments? 
[02:37:00]  Anybody?  No.  That clip should be in your replay.  Any comments?  Anybody?  No.  How do you bomb on a retard noise?  Oh.  I can't.  Dude, please can we hear that last clip again?  Dude.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Anyway, that's such a sign of desperation.  Obviously, the guy didn't look too good in his picture.  He looked like a loser, so Scorch had to point out the obvious.  He was trying to do the tard voice a little too much. 
[02:37:30]  Next up, how about this one?  Let's go on.  This one just basically says, hello, I'm a loser.  I got to see, except he says it like this.  I'm a loser.  Dink me.  Dink me.  Any comments?  Anybody?  No?  No.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  I thought the ball was gone, but apparently not.  Right center field.  McClouth is back to the track.  He leaps at the wall, and it is gone. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  It just cleared.  Yep.  No.  What are they saying, too?  They're saying it's a double.  It went just under the wall.  Oh.  I love that one, because he goes, what are they saying?  What are they saying?  You're the one that said it.  You're the one that says the stuff.  Wow, that's, uh...  So at least you know your radio brethren from back in the days.  Good to know that he's alive and well.  Prospering.  Yeah.  He is prospering.  He's flourishing.  In market 282 or whatever it is.  And he spends so much time on his show trying to convince people to be his sponsors. 
[02:38:30]  Like, he sells them and says, you know, just so you know, it's not like you're just getting a commercial,  because there are no commercials, because it's paid time.  And he says, uh, you'll actually be part of the PFG family, which is worth so much more.  He's not paying his staff with the money.  He's not buying things for the set.  He's putting it in his pocket and keeping it.  We should get an advertiser boycott going. 
[02:39:00]  Boycott PFG TV.  They made fun of retards.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  We won't buy your product.  Poor Scorch.  He rules.  He's so bad.  He's the best, though.  It's just horrible.  He's been doing it for so many years.  Yeah, it's like, how could you talk so much and be so terrible at it?  Date me!  It's not funny.  There's no rapport.  There's no irony.  Anything.  And that lump on the couch with him.  But the beauty of Scorch is he doesn't know. 
[02:39:30]  He also, he thinks he's Letterman.  In his mind, he's Letterman or Leno.  Combination of the two, actually.  And he thinks he's, like, the best of both?  Yeah, I would think so.  He told me when he found out I was a wrestling fan that he got Triple H into the WWE.  Oh, yeah.  He let me know.  I did.  We heard that.  We heard that years ago.  Oh, it's fungible.  We actually asked Triple H that because we had it with that rumor, and he laughed.  He didn't know who he was.  He openly laughed.  Who?  What?  What's a Scorch?  We should take a break. 
[02:40:00]  Mr. Loaf is coming in in about a half hour at this point.  Yes.  I think it's around 9.30 or so.  I have to tinkle.  Yeah, let's do that then.  Any comments?  Anybody?  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  I'm kind of proud of a dumb little video I made after the show.  I found the world's worst toupee on the way home yesterday.  And I've challenged everybody in the Twitterverse to come up with a worse toupee than the one 
[02:40:30]  I filmed yesterday.  And I was, yes, I was three feet from the guy's faces.  I was telling him it was the worst toupee ever.  But he's also an African-American gentleman, so it's even better because the weakness looks horrible.  That's the worst toupee ever.  Come on, sir.  How are you today?  All right.  He's got like Mark Anthony hair.  That is a disaster.  Have a nice day.  Looks like he scalped Lyle Lovett and put his fucking thing on his. 
[02:41:00]  It's on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  But a lot of black Al Pacino jokes flying.  Oh, yeah.  Also, I think it's the grandfather from Christmas Vacation.  He looks like the black version of that guy, too.  It is horrendous.  I don't even know what it is.  It's not even a close.  I think it's a hair weave or something, right?  There's no match.  No, it looks like he just plunked it on his head.  It looks like a breeze blew someone else's toupee off and landed on his head, and you captured the moment. 
[02:41:30]  He has no idea.  It's like a mouse parachute.  Landed on his scalp.  What's great about it, he...  Fucking horrendous.  I think he was being attacked.  You should have helped him.  He's dressed very nicely, though.  He's got his suit on, his tie, and he's going to work.  His fur hat.  He's got his fur hat.  He was so fucking pissed when I put that camera in his face.  Can we give out the number?  Of what?  Our phone number.  We never give out the number. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, we usually don't, right?  The number's on all the pad data.  Yeah, it's on the pad.  Yeah, but some people probably don't have pad data.  I'm confused.  We have new listeners.  I'm saying we never give out the number.  Oh, it's right on the pad data.  Some people don't have pad data.  What is it, though?  Just about all of them have it.  I don't even know what the number is.  It's 866-969-1969.  I just realized we haven't given the number.  Does it say anything?  Wow, one, wow.  I love that we don't have to give out the phone number.  That was always a pain in the ass at other stations.  It's right there on the pad data. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Well, at least, you know, give it out sometime.  Yeah.  Maybe.  You like that toupee?  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just fantastically horrid.  That's a brother.  What is that?  Isn't that the guy you're talking about from Christmas Vacation?  Oh, yeah.  That's from Pritzy's Honor?  He's been at a bunch of stuff.  Yeah, he was a legend, man.  And then he ends up in Christmas Vacation.  Oh, here you go.  With a horrendous. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, there you go.  There's the fucking pad.  Oh, there's the wig.  Yeah.  God, that does look like that guy's wig.  William Hickey.  It looks like the black version of that guy.  Yeah.  He was in Tales from the Dark Side, the movie.  Was he?  With David Johansson.  Yeah.  David Johansson.  We got meatloaf coming in.  Mustard Poindexter, you mean?  That's right.  In 20 minutes, I guess.  Yeah.  He's got a new album he's promoting.  He's a character of this meatloaf.  Yes, he is.  He should be a good time.  Should he?  I think so.  I hope so.  What the fuck were we going to do here?  He was in Fight Club. 
[02:43:30]  Was he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He stole a piece of the movie.  I mean, he was way better than I think anybody had expected him to be.  What did he do in Fight Club?  I don't remember him.  He was the guy with the bitch tits.  Yeah, he was a character.  Oh, right.  Yeah, he was really good.  He was really, really good.  He was great in Fight Club.  I fucking forgot about that.  Hugging Edward Norton.  His name was Robert Paulson.  That's right.  Wow, yeah.  He's in Rocky Horror, of course.  That's right.  Oh, right.  Yes.  I didn't realize that was him.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Do you think those are his real tits? 
[02:44:00]  You want to ask him?  Of course not.  Is he nipping out, too?  Yeah, they put, like, nips on big nests.  We got to ask him about the...  Sweaty nips on there, too.  Let's ask him about the prosthetic, hoping that there was no prosthetic.  Yeah.  I said, talking about his bitch tits.  Where did you get those prosthetic tits?  Julian Lennon.  John Lennon's son, right?  That he didn't give a shit about.  Yeah.  Which made Julian really happy when he has Sean Lennon and is, like, the number one dad 
[02:44:30]  for Sean Lennon.  Make him believe he never had a son before Sean.  He's now 47.  How old was Lennon when he died?  41 or so?  40, yeah.  40, 41?  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Shit.  That's a little fucked up, right?  Yeah.  And Anthony's favorite band, one of its members, is celebrating his 63rd birthday today.  Oh, so I...  I hear sarcasm.  What?  I hear some sarcasm.  Aren't you the big Yes fan in the room?  Oh, God.  Not really. 
[02:45:00]  I didn't...  Yeah, I didn't dislike Yes, but I was like...  Are you the owner of a lonely heart, Anthony?  Owner of a lonely heart.  Much better than...  No, I wasn't, like, a big Yes fan, but, um...  Not at all?  No.  What's wrong with you?  Eh.  What about It Could Happen?  It can happen to you!  It Can Happen to me!  That fucking John Anderson knew how to get his voice up there, huh?  What's that about?  You gotta think he had one nut or something. 
[02:45:30]  Fragile.  Right on.  Yeah, now we're talking, Danny.  Now we're talking.  I like Close to the Edge.  Close to the Edge is a great song.  Fragile.  I used to like that song because I could put it on when I got on the Staten Island Ferry,  and I could listen to one song the entire ride to Manhattan.  Oh.  You were a big Yes fan?  Just that album, really.  What else was on there?  That album, it was like three songs.  It was like Siberian Kutu or something.  Ah, wasn't there a hit, though, on there?  Yeah, right.  There was a hit on there.  I flipped the track list.  Hang on.  I don't know my Yes music. 
[02:46:00]  Yes.  But I think Fragile had one hit.  I really do.  Fragile?  Hang on.  Hang on.  Oh, no, I'm talking the Fragile.  Oh, you want Fragile?  Oh, yeah, Fragile had all the hits.  Okay, Close to the Edge was on, Close to the Edge.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  It had to be Roundabout.  I think it was a monster album, Fragile.  Yeah, Fragile was like their fucking album.  That was like their greatest hits? 
[02:46:30]  That's the one that had the hits on there.  Yeah, Roundabout was on there.  What else?  That's it.  Oh, it's a long distance.  Long distance, run and run.  Dude, Danny writes down, of course, D-Boy has seen Yes Live. 
[02:47:00]  I've seen Yes Live.  I saw Yes in the Round, man.  And I think Anthony's having a nervous breakdown.  I'll just add some tootally good Yes.  It's kind of like Yes and Jethro Tullin collaborated for a second. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, my God.  D-Boy's a big Yes fan.  D-Boy!  Yeah, he can't shut up about Yes.  I'm right here.  Are you a big Yes fan, D-Boy?  I love Yes.  You love Yes?  Yes, yes.  What's your favorite Yes song?  Acceptable Conditioner.  Then he says no.  I've got to go with Heart of the Sunrise on that.  Heart of the Sunrise.  Last track from Fragile.  Yeah, but the Yes album's got some good ones.  Starship Trooper.  Ah, Starship Trooper, yeah.  Yours is no disgrace.  Yeah.  Your fucking hair should be upside down under my air conditioner outside. 
[02:48:00]  The fucking...  I think that black gentleman was wearing a version of your hair yesterday when I filmed him.  I got Derek walks up to the bike and Jimmy, he just won't even look at Derek in the face  so I can see his eyes are just focused on his hair.  On his hair.  I just can't get over that.  But he's talking about Yes.  Doesn't matter.  Very...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Looks like a Wicker fruit bowl.  Put fucking lemons.  Did you like the older Yes?  I mean, I guess it would be technically the newer Yes.  When did you give up on Yes? 
[02:48:30]  Everyone gives up on their band.  I really don't know by album names because they had the weird covers so I don't know by  the way the covers were but not the...  Well, what song though?  Like, It Could Happen?  Were you still in there?  It Could Happen to You?  I mean, I guess the first couple albums, like three or four albums.  It could happen to me.  Oh, good God.  Not like 80s Yes.  I wasn't into that.  Are you a Yes fan, Jimmy, at all?  I like John Anderson because he likes me.  Oh, yeah?  That's right.  I remember that.  That's all it takes. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  What else are we going to do with Yes?  Thank you, D-Boy.  Did you see him in the round?  I saw him...  It was supposed to be in, like, 3D sound, but it didn't really come out too well.  Is it all sound, 3D sound?  No, they actually had, like, speakers, like, behind you when you were watching the same.  Wow, man!  Man!  Right.  But, uh...  We're going to change the concert experience, man!  Did you wear your sandals there?  I was, like, 13 or 14.  His hair looks freeze-dried. 
[02:49:30]  Jimmy can't get over the hair.  All moisture has been removed to keep it fresh.  Yes!  No!  Disgrace!  Freeze-dried.  That fucking hairdo.  Oh, my God.  A shredded coconut makes me very angry.  Fucking Kennedy's hair looked better as he pulled it apart at Memorial.  No!  Ah, shit, man.  Do you like when they pump up the concert experience, Anthony? 
[02:50:00]  When they do in the round or something?  No.  Or the wall of speakers, or...  I just, like, uh, you know, get the band up on a big, giant stage.  And that's it?  Good light show, shit like that.  You don't like all that other shenanigans?  And depending on what band, some pyro is always good, you know, some explosions kind of scare you.  Feel the heat coming off the stage, man.  Do you like big props?  No, I'm not into the fucking Big Piggy from Pink Floyd and the plane that flew through the wall. 
[02:50:30]  It's like, what are you doing?  You saw Pink Floyd?  Knock it up.  Yeah, years ago.  I would have loved to have seen Pink Floyd.  On their fucking, yeah, the wall tour.  It was good?  I like Pink Floyd, though.  It was really good, but the props and stuff were like, all right, stop.  Enough already, just play the songs.  Do you like, uh, when the...  Look, man, the plane's coming, man.  It's going through the wall, it's so symbolic, man.  It's a metaphor.  Yeah, like the corporate, you know, the greed, man.  Shut up.  Play your stupid songs that make no sense. 
[02:51:00]  Do you like the Tigers, uh, When the Tigers Broke Free?  What?  That song, When the Tigers Broke Free.  Oh, from Pink Floyd?  It's about his father being killed in the war.  Really?  It's great.  Yeah.  It's fucking great, man.  What's the name of the song?  When the Tigers Broke Free.  I don't know that.  Really?  Steven S. from Bayshore, who's a big U2 fan, he goes, how about a giant lemon?  And just writes, yuck.  U2 had a big, huge lemon.  Why?  As a prop.  I don't know what it meant, man.  Man.  That life could get a little, little tart.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  I don't know what it meant.  Maybe they're symbolic of their last album.  It's not a lemon.  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve Howe's birthday today.  That's why we're doing this, to the dummy that just wrote, hey, you realize it's Steve Howe's birthday.  Why else would we be playing yesterday?  Of course.  We wouldn't just pull it out of our ass.  Stop it.  Fucking Derek and his fucking hat made of parsley.  Parsley.  Should have thrown a match into it and just watch it go up like a California hillside.  This is what it would sound like. 
[02:52:00]  Go up like one of those 1800s photographer powder things for the flash.  If you punch Derek in the head, his hair would crack and fall off.  It would be like you punched Rice Krispies.  It would sound like jumping into a pile of dead leaves.  Twig hair.  Oh, this is it, yeah.  You never heard this?  Yeah, I've heard this.  Man.  A little slower, but it's very good.  Yeah, it's kind of plodding.  What album is this off?  I don't think I've ever heard of this.  Oh, these are the big intros and the... 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  It took forever to get to the song part of the song.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Right.  They have some good ones, though.  Self-indulgent shit.  How did the Beatles turn into this?  You know what I mean?  Like, the Beatles, like, changed everything and then it just starts going off into these crazy directions.  What a great voice.  Jesus.  Morning in Black 44.  The fuck?  When the forward commander has told to sit tight. 
[02:53:00]  He's rapping.  When he asked that his men be withdrawn.  And the jungle scape flanks as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while.  The Anzio Bridgehead was held for the price of a few hundred and forty miles.  What is this?  The History Channel? 
[02:53:30]  Come on.  Oh, right.  Does it kick in at any point?  It does have to.  Or is it just...  Anthony doesn't want any involvement with his music.  No.  He just wants them to get to the fucking singing.  This is stupid.  Yeah, it's World War II in real time.  I guess we just entered into a bit and we didn't even know it.  A willful boy from Jersey writes, Rush had two giant rabbits come out of a top hat. 
[02:54:00]  And then he just writes, what fun.  What fun.  Fun for everyone.  And then you had like...  What was the worst prop you saw in a concert?  Oh, God.  I never saw him.  But Alice Cooper, like, just...  All right, enough.  We get it.  You're macabre.  You're macabre-y.  Yeah, I used to say macabre.  With the guillotine and dead babies and all that shit.  Worst prop you saw in concert there, Jimmy?  Anything come to mind?  I love when Ozzy came out on a giant hand.  I actually love that. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  That was a cool prop.  I figured you would like that.  No one had better...  When Ozzy used to...  Now he just kind of runs out and he fucking starts yelling at the audience.  But he would come out in really cool ways in the 80s.  Yeah.  Like, once was a hand.  Once was fucking...  He ran down these castle steps and would throw a big cross.  You know, it was like all that fucking 80s metal.  It was phenomenal.  You know what was kind of a unique and interesting stage show?  It was ZZ Top when they had those conveyor belts on the stage. 
[02:55:00]  And you couldn't see the conveyor belt.  So they'd be standing on opposite sides of the stage playing.  Yeah.  Just standing there sideways.  And then they'd just move and switch sides of the stage without moving their legs.  Yeah.  They would just pop on the conveyor belt.  And they'd almost moonwalk because they were walking on the conveyor belts towards each  other and stuff.  I fucking remember that.  Yeah.  That was kind of funny.  Fucking ZZ Top, man.  Yeah.  They were the shit.  They were the shit.  You know, the day.  The older stuff.  I'm talking before Sharp Dress, man.  Yeah.  Even though that stuff was really good, too. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Like, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That was, what song is that?  Jamiroquai, Virtual Insanity.  Virtual Insanity.  Yeah.  He was another one with the conveyor belt fucking video.  Dude, this fucking song.  He just reminded me of that.  This song was just fucking huge and he did nothing else in the States.  It was giant.  He became famous all over the world except for the United States.  That was an interesting video because the whole floor moved.  The couches are moving.  And the camera is fixed in the room. 
[02:56:00]  Right.  So the, the, and you see, you don't see the floor moving because it's all one color.  So the furniture is just kind of moving around the room.  Pretty unique idea.  Oh, yeah.  Wasn't there, I mean, I can't remember if he actually won the Best New Artist.  He had to have.  But I know that there's like a, you know, there is like the curse of the Best New Artist category  where everybody that wins it just ends up doing nothing.  Who is this?  This song was huge.  Yeah, it was a big.  Jamiroquai, something like that.  He kind of looks like Marky Mark a little in the, but remember this song?  He stayed famous everywhere else, but never had a follow-up hit. 
[02:56:30]  What year is this?  Very Stevie Wonder sounding.  This has to be.  It was like 94, 95, I think.  Yeah, I think Danny's about right.  Yeah, Stevie Wonder sounding and.  Is he a white guy?  I think Maroon 5 ripped him off.  He's like a, he's like a Sam.  Oh.  I'm incompetent.  96.  96?  14 years ago, though.  Jesus.  So what is the, his feet are doing weird stuff to?  He's dancing around, but yeah, the floor isn't connected to the room.  Oh, that's how they do it. 
[02:57:00]  Okay.  So they're just sliding the floor around.  It's a cool video.  Or sliding the whole room around.  I don't know what they're doing.  Not the floor.  I think the video wants some more words, too.  You're right.  The fucking thing's just not, uh.  Um.  All right.  We're talking props.  For the Foreigner fans.  Worst prop.  Giant inflatable jukebox for Foreigner 4 Tour.  That's Rudy's hero.  In Wilmington, Delaware.  Ugh.  Had a huge jukebox they had to fucking put out there on the stage. 
[02:57:30]  Ugh.  Uh, David Lee Roth rode a giant surfboard through the air and jumped into a boxing ring in the  middle of the arena.  I think he sang a few songs, too.  Ha ha ha.  Shut up.  But can't recall or care, a willful boy says.  Stupid David Lee Roth.  God, was he just the worst.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Uh.  Horrible.  Let me say hi to, uh, oh boy.  Uh, Rick in St. Louis.  Rick.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  The worst concert prop ever has to be a great white with that explosion and mass death. 
[02:58:00]  Jesus.  That's a good prop.  What are we, guys?  Let's go to Joey on Long Island.  Joey.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Joey.  That Iron Maiden.  70 foot fucking monstrosity.  Every time I see that thing, I just want to take it to legs out.  Who, Eddie?  Yeah, it's whatever the fuck his name is.  I don't mind that.  What, what, what is it?  Iron Maiden's Eddie, the fucking creature.  Oh, really?  It's the cover of every album they've done.  Oh, that thing. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, that creature's called Eddie?  Eddie, yeah.  And they have it in every concert?  They have to have that big, uh, floor?  Yeah, but that's kind of like their thing.  I don't mind it.  Let's go to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike?  Mike.  Hey.  Hey.  Hello, boys.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  All right, sir.  The first concert I went to see was David Lee Roth.  He rode around that giant, giant inflatable microphone like it was a giant hog.  It was embarrassment and a travesty of musical justice. 
[02:59:00]  I do remember that.  The big inflatable microphone that he would use like a cock and ride it like a bucking  Bronco on stage.  Woo!  Oh, yeah.  Ari and Dave, what are you doing?  You know, I ran into his manager at an Allman Brothers show last year at the Beacon Theater.  Yeah.  And he knows all the shit we sent about his client.  Yeah, whatever.  He's actually a nice guy.  He used to hang at the comedy cellar.  David's actually a really nice dude.  We should get him on the fucking show. 
[02:59:30]  Christ.  We went through hell together in different times with that company.  What about Fred Durst?  Kyle S. in Indiana writes, Fred Durst came out on a huge 20-foot toilet at an Olympus  Kid concert.  Did he really?  Wow.  That's appropriate.  His career fell into it.  Then he writes, it was very fitting for their music.  Yeah, exactly.  And what about ACDC with the cannons and the fucking...  That's kind of cool.  The big, giant fucking stacks of marshals.  That's cool. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, it was cool.  Oh, God.  What about fucking Blue Eyes to Cult with the big Godzilla?  Oh, yeah.  They did the Godzilla.  They did the giant Godzilla fucking thing that would be on stage.  And when they played My Father's Place, they weren't allowed to bring in the giant Godzilla.  No.  They wouldn't fit in the little club.  So all they did was the drummer put a Godzilla mask on and they put a strobe light on him  as he went through his 20-minute drum solo during Godzilla.  Oh, God.  Get me out of this club.  That sucked.  People are mad because in that Jamaracoy, whatever, video, it's actually the room is moving. 
[03:00:30]  The room is moving and the camera's fixed on the cameras.  Six of one, half dozen the other.  So the camera's on the wall.  The camera's on the wall.  The fourth wall there.  The room is being wheeled around and can be spun and all that.  But because the camera's fixed on the wall, it looks like everything else is moving.  Wait a minute, but how is the couch is moving?  Because the room moves, but the couch is staying in one spot the whole time. 
[03:01:00]  Yep.  But the room is moving and the camera is attached.  Put that back on.  And then one couch is against the wall, so then the other couch, you know what I mean,  is being pushed toward the other couch.  Yeah, the floor looks like it's moving because the whole room is moving.  I don't know about that.  The room is like up about a quarter inch off the floor and it's on wheels or something.  Yeah.  And then they could spin it around and move it back and forth.  Oh, boy.  That means we've got to listen to the song.  Or just watch it without the...  It is a weird little room. 
[03:01:30]  See?  And...  See?  The room is moving, but the camera's fixed on the wall, so...  Oh, I see.  Okay, so now the room is...  No, wait a minute.  Now, is that couch attached to the wall?  Because the couch isn't moving.  But now the couch is moving.  See what I'm saying?  The room's not moving.  All right, hold on, hold on.  It's the floor.  But maybe someone's holding the couch back from underneath the wall.  It could have been, right.  It could have tricked you a little bit. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, that's fucked up.  Yeah.  If the guy said he saw how the movie was...  The video was made, I've got to believe him.  Yeah, someone kept that couch from moving at first.  To really confuse you?  Yeah.  And there's a bird!  I think the whole thing is magic.  What does the black bird mean?  I think he's a magical man.  See, now the couch is back where it belongs.  Now you've got a cockroach-looking type of fucking bug.  See, he was having a tough time walking forward, though. 
[03:02:30]  So maybe now the floor is moving.  The floor is moving.  It's the floor.  It has to be the floor moving.  It's the floor.  Dude, it's not the room.  It's much easier to move the floor.  Yeah, because he's not even stepping and he went backwards.  I'm confused.  It's the floor.  That's how you pull this couch back.  Why aren't the other couches moving then again?  Maybe they're lifted off a quarter inch.  Well, how's the couch spinning then?  Because the whole room would be spinning.  Maybe the whole fucking thing is spinning.  When they want the other couches to stay still, they raise them a quarter of an inch so that 
[03:03:00]  they don't, uh...  Yeah, I've got to figure it out.  It's the fucking floor.  Whoever saw that documentary, you're a cunt and you don't know what you're talking about.  Wait, what's moving?  I don't know.  Maybe he's right.  I don't either.  I'm trying to figure out what's moving.  It could be a giant platform floor that is just being moved underneath the room, though.  Straight Dick from North Carolina writes,  Great job breaking down a 16-year-old video.  Can you guys go over the 1984 Apple commercial next? 
[03:03:30]  Can't you put in making of Jamiroquai video, Danny, and maybe they'll fucking solve that  for us?  Yeah.  There were a couple of videos that were, um...  That were like this.  Dancing on the ceiling.  All right, let's...  They didn't have that down, though, because the camera was too shaky, so when the room  would be turned on a gimbal, the fucking...  It's called a gimbal?  Yeah.  Metallica did something similar.  Yes, yes.  When they were on that platform, and it looked like the room was spinning.  Yeah, it was spinning around. 
[03:04:00]  Or it looked like they were going around on a pivot.  And they were, like, going underneath them and shit.  Danny, being a big metallurgist...  Being a big Metallica fan, did you ever see a show from the Snake Pit?  Uh...  I did.  No.  Did you?  Matt.  That was a little before me.  Where people were below the stage?  No, I think that was Black Album Tour, and that was...  That was fucking cool.  I was a little too much of a kid.  You actually watched the fucking show from the middle of the stage, underneath them.  Oh, I remember that, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I remember that tour.  You can look up and shit, yeah. 
[03:04:30]  It was really cool.  Uh...  Their stage now, Metallica's stage, revolves.  So, I guess Lars got Tybee in the back, but it works, though.  You get to watch all of them pretty close.  Yeah, I saw them actually, they did a show where there was actually two drum sets on the  stage, and Lars was just running back and forth to either one.  That was pretty cool.  Their stage show now, it's not as elaborate as it used to be, but they still have these  big, like, four giant coffins.  Yeah.  That kind of do fun stuff.  One of the best shows I ever saw was, I think it was for the Load or Reload Tour, and they 
[03:05:00]  had a guy up in the lights, and they would pretend that there was a malfunction, but it  was pretty cool, because the guy would get set on fire and fall out of the light housing.  That's cool.  It was pretty fun, man.  Yeah, it would bug people out, because they didn't know if it was part of the show or  not.  Let's say hi to Dr. X from Mexico.  Morning, boys.  You sound mysterious.  Hugh Lewis came down here to South Texas.  It was not a big venue for the fucker to do his hit from Back to the Future.  So they had people dancing in little 50s poodle skirts as these hoods chased Marty McFly all 
[03:05:30]  over the stage.  That's pretty bad.  Here it is.  Four walls move on a stationary gray floor with no detail, to give the illusion that  the floor is moving.  However, he does not state where the fourth wall is.  In several shots, chairs or couches are fixed to the walls, so they appear to be standing  still, when in fact, they are moving along with the room itself. 
[03:06:00]  In other shots, chairs remain stationary on the floor, but the illusion is such that they  appear to be moving.  The moving walls were not completely rigid and can be seen in some shots to wiggle slightly.  So it is the room itself that is moving.  Oh, and when he moved backwards, he was stationary on the floor, but the whole fucking room was  moving backwards.  So he's just standing there, he can make it look like, he can just stand in place and  look like he's walking, and the room moves, so it looks like he's walking backwards and 
[03:06:30]  shit has gone around him.  Right on.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we broke that down.  Let's watch video kill the radio star next.  Yeah, how did the buggles do it?  And by the way, they didn't kill the radio star.  No.  They don't even play videos anymore.  No, we watched 16 and Pregnant.  Oh, yeah.  Great show.  All right.  Don't whores.  We should take a break and clear the field for Mr. Loaf. 
[03:07:00]  Clear the field.  Because he's something out.  And they're going to do some drinking.  He should be in studio next, hopefully.  I don't know if he's here yet, but a good opportunity to take a break, and then we'll  talk to Meat Loaf next.  Yes.  Yes, I was.  And they go, good job.  And they pat me on the head like a nice puppy and go away.  And all of a sudden, it became, we played Central Park.  And at the time, when we played Central Park, we had the biggest crowd in the history of  Central Park. 
[03:07:30]  After that, there's been, that was 78.  You know how many people?  A lot.  Because the record was what?  A million or something?  That little woman rink only held about.  Oh, okay.  You were over there?  Yeah.  That only held like about 12, 13,000, something like that.  Wow.  Well, they asked, the police told me they estimated 60,000 around the park.  I know that area.  That's, that's, wow.  Okay.  In and around the park.  And we left, and I had all these, all these press from around the world, and I'm going, 
[03:08:00]  why are they here?  Why?  And they go, well, people wanting to know about you all around the world.  I'm going, why?  I'm like, I don't, why?  I'm just here playing a show.  And, uh, and when we left, it was, all these people jumped on the car.  They ripped the car apart. 
[03:08:30]  They took, they were ripping off the bumpers and the sides, and they broke the windows,  and they ripped off, and I'm going, these people hate me this much?  No, they're trying to get to you.  And I'm going, this is too weird.  And I went over to a hotel around the corner.  I locked myself in a hotel for three weeks, because I'm going, oh, no, dude, dude.  You got the wrong guy playing this game.  It just freaked you out like that?  Oh, yeah, the whole thing freaked me out.  And then it was like, then I was, was freaked out.  Wow.  Were you drinking and doing drugs at this time, or did it kind of kick off? 
[03:09:00]  No, it was after.  It was like once it got to be.  No, I wasn't doing it then.  After that night, give me a drink.  You don't drink.  I don't care.  You know?  I don't, give me a steak and a drink.  You're a vegetarian and you don't drink.  I don't care.  I want some meat and some whiskey.  So that really led to some drugs, huh?  Well, no, it just led me to, I needed a bottle of Jack Daniels on stage one night.  But other than that, no, I didn't.  Well, no, I never, I never really had a serious drug or alcohol problem. 
[03:09:30]  So it didn't, it didn't.  Until this morning.  How'd you make the transition from acting to, uh...  I haven't.  Oh, oh, really?  From acting to music?  I haven't.  Oh, you've done a pretty good job, though, for not making that transition.  Rob Cavallo, who produced this new record, Hank called Teddy Bear.  Rob Cavallo, after working with me, who's, Rob's a pretty good producer, Green Day, Goo Goo Dolls,  Go Chemical Romance going on, we just keep going, Paramore, Dave Matthews this year.  Um, uh, he coined the phrase that Meat Loaf is an actor who acts like he can sing. 
[03:10:00]  And I totally agree with him.  Really?  Oh, yeah, because my, my phrase is this.  When I first start a song, please remove all the razor blades from the studio,  because if not, people will kill themselves.  Uh, wow.  Because, oh, it's, it's, it's really something to behold.  It's like, you'd be going, this guy does what? 
[03:10:30]  How is that?  Because, I mean.  Because I don't pay attention to, I don't pay attention to what the melody's doing,  or what the key is, or what the meter is.  What, do you got to kind of fall into it as the song goes on?  I, I, I'm always just, and I, especially when they've got, the way this album turned out,  was I had all these songs ready to go, and then Rob threw them all out.  And I knew them all, so I knew all the lyrics, I knew where the characters were,  I knew where all this, everything sat, and now then everything got thrown out, 
[03:11:00]  and I just kept getting these new songs, because we were writing them.  And we, and I, and I don't really, I, I assist, but not write.  Um, I had Justin Hawkins, I had Rick Brantley, I had James Michael, I had all these, um,  writers in and around us for a month, working on this Hank Cool Teddy Bear,  because it's a concept album, it's a story of a soldier who is in a battlefield, 
[03:11:30]  nonspecific battlefield, and he's wounded, his best friend dies, he, he, he tries to crawl,  he can't, tries to get up, he can't, blood's pouring out of his head,  he thinks he's going to die, instead of dying, his life flashes forward, instead of backwards,  into the scenarios of what, of what could happen if he lives.  And they're weird.  And, and it's the same girl in every story, she just is a different attitude,  a different look, and a different personality. 
[03:12:00]  And it's, it, but you can pull the songs out, you don't need them plugged in,  because I didn't tell any of the writers what we were doing.  I went to a friend of mine, a screenwriter, Killian Kerwin,  I remembered he had that little storyline, just flash forward instead of backwards.  And then we kind of, he did, I, we didn't.  And I was on the phone, we threw around some stuff, and then he went off and, and wrote it.  And then we, then we got back together once we started putting songs together.  And I said, oh, that's not going to work. 
[03:12:30]  And you got to adapt to go over here.  So, so we, so you start with a screenplay type of thing first.  Yeah.  And then write an album.  Yeah.  But we didn't tell the writers what I, what we were doing.  Okay, interesting.  Oh my God.  No, because writers become really literal.  Go to a bad Broadway play.  All you had to do is go to a bad Broadway play.  Like, I won't say it. 
[03:13:00]  It's one of the biggest hits of all time.  But it's a bad, what sucks?  Oh, you got to say it now.  What sucks?  Give us a clip.  Phantom of the Opera.  Did you like when Paul Stanley did it?  Paul Stanley did it.  Shut up.  He did do it.  Paul Stanley did do it, yeah.  He did Phantom of the Opera?  Yes, he did.  In New York?  Certainly most.  I don't know if he did it in New York, but Paul, I mean, I think he did do it in New York.  You know what?  I hated Phantom of the Opera.  I did see that dumb fucking show.  People were, people, it's the emperor's new clothes.  People are sleeping in it.  Go to Phantom of the Opera and watch the audience. 
[03:13:30]  If you go to a really good musical and you look around the room, nobody's moving.  Their eyes are on the stage all night.  It's like, that's what's going to, you know, maybe when the curtain comes down and the lights  go down, they might turn to their girlfriend, boyfriend, husband.  And partner, whatever, or if they're alone, they might talk to the empty seat next to  them.  And, you know, but in Phantom of the Opera, there's things going on and people are looking  around and moving.  And I'm going, look at this.  This is the emperor's new clothes. 
[03:14:00]  Well, anyway, it's like, I don't know that this is a lyric in Phantom of the Opera, but  it very well could be that, that writers get very literal.  So I'm standing next to this tree.  It's as lovely as it could be with you and me.  And the audience is sitting there going, we know there's a tree.  You moron.  So, so, uh, yeah, I just didn't want them to get literal because the minute you tell a 
[03:14:30]  writer, okay, we're going to write us, they're all over it.  And, and you have to go, no, no, no, no, don't write that.  But what I did go was as they were getting close to finishing, uh, on the album, I know  this is far too intellectual, um, it's, it's very Arthur Miller of me, um, all the songs  after the third song start talking back to the other songs, but none of the new writers  actually knew that I was maneuvering them that way. 
[03:15:00]  I'd go, why don't we, why don't we put in a lyric about like singing or, uh, this, that  and what, somebody help me.  What's the name of the swing foot?  Swing switch back, switch back.  Is there a band called switch back?  Yeah, but were you just talking to the door?  I was talking to the door.  Yeah.  I just want to make sure I wasn't saying it.  Switch foot?  Switch foot?  Switch foot.  Switch foot?  Okay.  Listen, they don't feel bad because I had dinner with them and I couldn't get their name right. 
[03:15:30]  You guys are switch back, switch, switch foot, foot switch, club foot.  Foot switch, club foot.  So what's, so anyway, they wrote a song for the record, for the record.  Okay.  And, and the guy must have been channeling me because he actually really nailed what I  was going for referring back to the other without me telling him.  Everybody else had to flip around and tell him, but it's a real, I'm telling you right  now, Rob Cavallo is the best producer in the world because he doesn't let his ego get 
[03:16:00]  in the way and I, I know people are going to go, ah, they all say that, but this best  record I've ever made.  No.  Absolutely.  Better than Bat Out of Hell.  Well, I explained Bat Out of Hell.  I explained to you why.  Okay.  That you can't compare anything to Bat Out of Hell, but I can compare it in this way.  But when Bat Out of Hell was finished and I listened to it, and if I listen to it now, 
[03:16:30]  I hear things that I would do different.  Well, you're a perfectionist.  We started the interview by saying that.  But on this record, and I've heard this record 150 times, there's not a song I would change.  There is not a note that I, there is nothing about this record that I would change.  What would you change about Bat Out of Hell?  Well, I didn't want to take the words on.  I hated the, I still do hate the production that took the words right out of my mouth. 
[03:17:00]  That's a great song.  Paradise by the Dashboard Light almost got thrown off the record.  You put an accordion in it.  And he wants to call it three out of four ain't bad.  Well, if you can hit three out of four every time, your dollars go up in free agency, don't they?  You've had a, I have to ask you too, it's off subject.  You've had an amazing life.  I mean, even.  I'm always off subject.  It's the story that, you know, it's a known story from your autobiography. 
[03:17:30]  But you were in Dallas, and I just have to ask you about it.  Because I know that when we get into it, they're going to say, oh, he's got to go.  So, you were in Dallas when Kennedy was shot, which is, it's an amazing, we talk about the  assassination all the time.  Yeah, what brought you to Dallas, first of all?  Were you from Dallas?  Were you from Dallas?  I can't talk about what brought me to Dallas that day.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Jack Ruby dropped him off.  I know.  Didn't they tell you not to bring that up?  Hey, dude.  Like, you know.  Conspiracy. 
[03:18:00]  He's going to need security for the rest of his life.  No.  Oh, no.  We were in high school.  And because I live so far away from home, I got this specialized driver's license.  Because the school buses didn't come out where I was.  And it allowed me to have a driver's license.  But the driver's license, if I got pulled over on any street that wasn't a street directly  going to my high school, I was arrested, basically. 
[03:18:30]  I was ticketed and taken away.  So I could drive to school and I could drive back home.  That's as much as I could drive.  I was 14 years old.  And, well, that particular day, we got permission.  And we got permission that I could take my friends to Love Field to see Kennedy land.  So we did.  And when we got there, it was jammed.  I mean, the place was packed.  And my friend, Jimmy McWhorter, said, my father works here. 
[03:19:00]  I know where he's coming out.  It was a big secret.  Where's Kennedy?  What exit is Kennedy going to leave from?  Jimmy goes, I know.  I said, OK.  So we drove the car around some other side of the airport and we parked.  And when we got there, there was nobody at the gate.  There was two Dallas policemen.  And lo and behold, he came out that exit.  And my other friend, Bill Slocum, who was really outgoing and, you know, macho, most popular, best-looking, dated to cheerleader, head cheerleader, captain of the football team, scholarship, Sam Houston State, AMA, motorcycle racer, you know, macho. 
[03:19:30]  The opposite of everybody in this room.  That's right.  The opposite of everybody in this room.  Well, he goes out and the car stops and he shakes his hand.  And when he did it, McWhorter went out there and shook his hand.  And being me, the nervous little wreck that I am, I couldn't. 
[03:20:00]  I stood on the curb and waved.  Hi.  It's like meeting Elvis.  I shook my head and hoped it rattled.  Did he wave at you?  Did he at least see you and wave at you?  Who?  Yeah.  Kennedy.  Yeah, he saw me.  He went, hi.  Like, what's wrong with him?  Basically, I'm sure his mom was going, what's wrong with your friend over there?  You know, so anyway, we knew some people in Market Hall.  So what we were going to do was we were going to go down. 
[03:20:30]  Once he got into Market Hall, we were going to get into the back and hide behind the curtains like the Wizard of Oz and watch it.  Is this the trademark you're talking about where he was going to actually speak at the luncheon?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because we used to throw parties in there.  And if you had private parties, you could serve booze to 10-year-olds in Texas.  There was the thing about private parties, booze.  That's okay.  Just make sure they get home.  And I don't think you do that now.  But back when I was a kid, you know, running moonshine. 
[03:21:00]  So anyway, I'm not too crazy.  And so we stopped at a barbecue place for lunch because he didn't take them all.  And when we came out, somebody said, press has been shot.  And so my friend listened over the little AM, FM radio earpiece.  And he has.  We were running through the parking lot, and people were going, stop the kids.  That's not funny. 
[03:21:30]  No, we're being serious.  You kids are going to get in big trouble.  We're going to tell somebody you're doing this.  We can find your license plate number.  Okay, fine.  So we're driving down Stimmons Expressway using the Harry Hines or Stimmons.  And there was a guy jumping in the middle of the road.  And I moved lanes, and he moved over, and he's waving his arms at us.  And I'm going, I'm not stopping for this guy.  And he just, we were, he was jumping.  We were going to hit him. 
[03:22:00]  So I slowed down, and he slapped some badge up against the thing.  And all of us to this day still think he said Secret Service.  And he said, scoot over.  I'm confiscating.  I'm taking your car.  So we did.  We went pulled into Parkland Hospital.  He parked.  He looked at us and said, don't move.  Don't not get out of this car.  And I bet we sat in that car for an hour.  I mean, I didn't even move back over away from my friend over to where the, behind the driver. 
[03:22:30]  And so later on, probably an hour and a half later, he comes over and says, look.  And we pulled in.  There was guns everywhere.  We were there before the limousine pulled in.  We didn't, we didn't, we couldn't see him get out of the car, but we saw her get out of the car.  We saw Conley get out of the car.  John Conley was shot.  So you saw Jackie exit the car while JFK was still in the car?  Well, I don't know that he was still in the car.  She may have, they may have gotten him out of the car.  But she stood up.  We could see her.  Conley stood up. 
[03:23:00]  And we sat there.  And later on, this guy comes back over and says, look, let me give you $1,000 for this.  And we're, God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, let me give you $5.  So we took $5.  We cut it in three pieces.  And we all have a little third of the $5.  Wow.  And then he said, you can get out of the car.  And by that time, it was, everybody was gathered around out over there.  And we were standing out there when they announced he was dead.  And, and nobody believed us until that night. 
[03:23:30]  We were on the, on the air standing next to a senator from Illinois.  Wow.  And we were going to get in big trouble.  We had missed football practice and everything.  Because we couldn't leave Parkland Hospital.  Once we were there, you were stuck.  You couldn't get out.  Do you regret not shaking his hand?  No.  No, it's who I am.  It's like, oh, you should see.  It's like I sat next to John Lennon.  It was close to John Lennon and went past me to Sweet and Low.  Oh, good line, mate.  Is that true?  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  The only thing I could think of was, you passed me some Sweet and Low?  And I said, Elvis, I got to, I'm really a meeting with Elvis.  And Elvis came to our Rock Your Show in L.A.  And he, you did a good job, son.  And I just went, uh-huh.  I was like, I get around celebrities.  I'm like, you know.  I'm the same way.  I'm horrendous.  I'm a nutcase. 
[03:24:30]  I have to, like, know them sort of, you know.  It's like once, you know, because once you work with somebody like Antonio or Dennis, once you're in an environment where you're working with an actor or a director or people like that, then I know them.  Like, you know, I know people.  I mean, I wouldn't be that way around Brad or Ed because I did a film with him.  Yeah.  But at least he panics around guys like JFK and Lennon.  I've panicked around guys who had, like, one spot on Taxi in 1980.  At least you're panicking around real people who you probably should panic around. 
[03:25:00]  Well, for the fact that you actually know a guy who had one spot on Taxi says a lot for your brain power.  I wouldn't know who was on Taxi every week.  It's a good show, though.  Yeah.  Judd Hirsch.  Yes.  No, not him, though.  No.  You didn't like Judd?  Loved Judd, but I never met him.  Oh, no, but he was on Taxi.  Oh, yeah, he was the lead.  You got me really confused for saying, don't do that.  Sorry.  It's too early in the morning.  I'm liable to, you know, spring a leak.  You screamed before when he came in.  His pipes really are good.  You have really, your voice is held up nicely.  A very distinctive voice, too. 
[03:25:30]  Like, everybody knew when it was a meatloaf song, because, yeah, your voice.  What'd you play?  You played Jack Black, right?  You played me and Jack?  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  Like a rose.  You like that ballad?  Yeah, it was good.  It was all right, man.  We didn't expect to like it, because Jack went crazy about Jack.  I was like, God damn it, this is really good.  Oh, you know when Jack was in?  We don't hate him.  He was just mean to me.  He just did our show a lot on his way up and then kind of forgot about us.  We kind of hold a grudge on that.  We have low self-esteem as a show. 
[03:26:00]  Well, that's okay.  I have low self-esteem as an artist.  Do you hate listening to yourself?  No, not this one.  Normally, I don't listen to myself at all.  This one, I don't mind listening to, because it's a kid named Patrick, 24 years old, singing this.  The one that was hard to get away from, if you played Los Angeles Loser, when it says,  I just want to thank all you women out there, especially the ones who've shown a little love for someone such as myself.  You love me.  So friendly towards me. 
[03:26:30]  And if it wasn't for you, there would be no me.  And that was tough, to not do it as me.  Oh, okay.  That was real hard, because I really wanted to do it as me.  And I kept hearing it and going, no, I've got to do it as Patrick.  Yeah.  So you're pretty much a character in this?  I'm a character on every record.  Yeah.  Every record I've ever done, I'm a character.  Never been yourself, just sang.  No, but I see now.  Now, see, you're looking at me with this frowned expression. 
[03:27:00]  No.  I'm just sleepy.  I think this is much more...  Oh, you're sleeping?  Oh, I said I'm sleepy.  How many years have you been doing this this early in the morning?  I know.  You never get used to it.  You should be awake, damn it.  Wake up!  You never get used to it, Milo.  I'm just going to wake up.  I'm going to slap him a bit.  That's all.  I'm going to wake him up.  Wake up!  So anyway, no.  See, you hear all the time.  And I read, and I listen to interviews, and the guy or the girl will come on and go, 
[03:27:30]  Well, it was a sad moment.  But when I backed my 1998 Dodge pickup truck out the back, oh God, this is hard to talk, back pickup, I ran over my cat.  And this was just a song I sang to my cat.  So, okay, now he's all emotional.  He's got to say, or the guy goes, you know, Italian. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, you know, man, that guy, I was going into Indian.  Anyway, so he says he breaks up with his girlfriend, and so he went through 12 months of hell, and so he wrote 12 records about it.  Well, you know, you're going from your emotion, they're really easy to sing, they're about you, yes, it's probably truthful,  but what's harder is for Marlon Brando to find the truth in Streetcar Named Desire, which he didn't really live in, 
[03:28:30]  but boy, is he truthful, than it is for the guy that ran over his cat with his Dodge.  There's a lot, it's a lot more difficult to find the truth, and what acting, I think acting, singing, performing is about the truth.  What you do on the air is about the truth, and acting is really being a great liar, but still telling the truth. 
[03:29:00]  And these, all these performances are the truth, so yeah, they're 24-year-old Patrick's truths, and it's really not easy to,  it's like having an alien explode from your chest to get inside this.  But Rob coined it, I'm an actor who acts like he can sing.  What's a hard scene for you to do as an actor, or is there any, like, because anybody can play anger, anger's kind of an easier one, or aggression.  What's, if you're acting something, what's a harder scene for you to pull? 
[03:29:30]  Let me tell you, it's the characters that become hard, because you've seen, everybody's seen them so many times,  especially now with Law & Order and all these, where they, if you switch channels, somebody's being interrogated.  You know, it's like, or you switch channels, and everybody, and even their grandmother is a southern country, bigoted sheriff, you know?  Right.  I want you people out of town by sunup.  And so, the hard part is if somebody gives you a film like that, and I won't do a film that I read the script, and I go, 
[03:30:00]  oh, I know exactly how to play that.  I have to, a script I read, and if it makes me nervous when I finish reading it, going, how am I going to do that?  That's the ones I want.  I don't want, I don't want the ones, oh, I know how to play that.  That's, why?  How about Fight Club, which I didn't even realize that was you.  I mean, that's how good you are.  See, thank you.  That's the biggest compliment you get.  I did the House episode, because Hugh Laurie's on this record as well.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he plays piano on the Cara Diacordia. 
[03:30:30]  And on my best friend, I did the House, my best friend, it took him 15 minutes to figure out it was me on the House.  He calls me up and goes, you're on the House.  I go, yeah, I am.  There's 15 minutes I didn't know it was you.  And he hangs up on me.  That's really what he did.  That's what a good friend does.  He's an actor.  You've got a lot of Fight Club fans in this room right now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Fight Club's cool.  Yeah, that was a great movie.  You know what?  That was a very odd part.  And there was another scene. 
[03:31:00]  Fox said, we need another scene with Meat Loaf.  They wrote this amazing scene.  It was almost a nine-page scene.  It was almost nine minutes long.  And with Fincher shooting, it shouldn't have taken us more than a year to shoot that nine pages.  And Fox wanted me in this other scene.  And I was on tour.  And I kept trying to figure out how to get it in because it was with Brad and Ed and myself. 
[03:31:30]  And it was a really incredible scene.  And I might have got an award or two had we put that nine-minute scene in there.  But you know how fate is.  Fate deals the hand you're dealt.  Well, it worked out well anyway.  I mean, it did.  It was a very memorable character in the movie, that's for sure.  And not only that, but it's a pretty iconic movie.  I mean, it's huge as far as pop culture goes.  You know, it's on everybody's top.  I mean, I can't go as far as to say top ten because not everybody has the same taste. 
[03:32:00]  But I would say about top 50.  I mean, how does it feel to be part of such an iconic movie that sticks with people like that?  I think so.  And I know I'm talking to a guy who was in Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little iconic in itself.  I mean, Bat of the Hill.  Yeah, he's had a few hits.  You got Phil Rizzuto to almost talk about fucking.  I mean, how do you pull that off?  Did he not know by the way who he was doing?  Yeah, he knew what he was doing.  Oh, he did.  Of course he did.  Yeah, of course he did.  A naughty boy.  A naughty boy. 
[03:32:30]  God bless you, Phil.  But no, Phil, Art Shamsky was Phil's agent.  Do you know Art Shamsky?  Yeah.  He was an old player.  He was the right fielder in the Miracle Mets.  69.  Oh, wow.  Art Shamsky.  And Art Shamsky was Phil's agent.  And the only thing that Phil asked was, do people need to get high to listen to this record?  And Jim Steinman's linebacker was, Phil, with this record, it would probably be better if they didn't. 
[03:33:00]  But, you know, they'd have to do some doctor bills if they got too high listening in this thing.  And I tend to agree with him.  See, there's a rumor that starts it's all bullshit.  That he didn't know that he was doing a sexual thing and he was mad.  The money store people probably pressured him.  It's like everything that's written in the internet, even if it's a lie, lies become truth. 
[03:33:30]  Yes.  And that's my new...  I'm going down, there's a protest going out in front of the building.  I'm going to go out there and get my own prostat going, lies become truth.  What's the protest?  I don't know.  We were trying to figure it out.  Is it here or Fox next door?  Oh, it must be Fox next door.  Maybe we'll find out.  Probably Fox.  The man boobs in Fight Club.  Yeah, they weighed 40.  No, the whole suit weighed 40 pounds.  Yeah.  If I'm not mistaken, it's been a long time now and I'm older. 
[03:34:00]  I know I'm holding them, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They were hanging lower than that, though.  There you go.  We got a photo right there.  I think they were...  And you were nipping out a little bit.  The weight between them was 26 pounds.  I think they were 13 pounds apiece.  Wow.  Bowling balls on it.  And flax seeds.  They were all made of flax seeds.  So that was David Fincher said, because if they're made of flax seeds and you move, it moves like a real body would move. 
[03:34:30]  And I said, okay.  So they had to build me a special chair to sit down in because, oh, I'm telling you what, women with big boobs, I don't know how they keep their head on.  I mean, my neck was killing me the whole thing.  And we've got a chair where I could take it off and it would hang because it was a bitch getting into.  But we could take it off my shoulders and hang it on this little thing in front of me.  They built me all these chairs.  Because that movie went on for nine months, shooting. 
[03:35:00]  Wow.  I mean, there's days...  Three days in a row, we sat in my trailer playing cards.  Brad, Ed, everybody.  Brad can't play cards.  So if you ever get a chance to play cards with Brad Pitt, take it.  I won 700 bucks on him one afternoon.  Is it true that there was a lot of drinking going on during the filming of that movie?  Not that I...  I heard Brad and Ed, at least, they would get nice and do some of the scenes.  I heard that they were completely drunk when they were...  The scene where they're doing golf, they're driving golf balls.  Oh, that's possible.  When they were shooting together, they decided they wanted to have a... 
[03:35:30]  Of course Brad can't play cards.  Look at all the pussy he's got to bang.  What's wrong with you, meatloaf?  Everything he pulls out is an ace of spades in his cock.  Right, exactly.  He doesn't have time to play cards.  No, so Fight Club was pretty cool.  I really love David Fincher.  Yeah.  Because we do...  The average is 37 takes with him.  And...  Because I've done 51 films and now...  51 films? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Shit.  If you have TiVo, if you TiVo meatloaf, you can see all 51.  I wouldn't recommend that you see all 51.  It's not like on...  I wouldn't have a meatloaf movie marathon and go through them.  And there's like To Catch a Yeti, which you just really want to just burn.  There's some others that you just don't want to watch.  Then there's...  Do you know, I'd give you a good five, six that you'd want to watch out of 51. 
[03:36:30]  Do you still get recognized from State Fair as the boy in the stands?  Almost every day.  It says uncredited, too.  No, no, no.  I'm telling you, coming up now on the street, that group that was protesting, they all stopped protesting.  And you went, oh, boy, in State Fair!  State Fair.  How old were you?  How old were you when you did that?  God, eight, nine.  Oh, you were a real kid.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, the reason I did it is because I was going with a friend named Randy Dyer.  And Pat Boone had worked for his father on a peanut farm when Pat was in college. 
[03:37:00]  Jesus.  That's how you make network connections back then?  Are we all high right now?  Peanut farmers?  Are we high?  Are we all high right now?  Yeah.  What, are you talking about Pat Boone and peanut farms?  Very good question coming in.  Okay.  What's the thing you won't do for love?  Oh, Jesus.  But you won't do that.  What?  How many times has he heard that one?  Butt sex.  That's the first time ever.  Yeah.  What's the one thing you won't do for love?  What is it?  Yeah.  Never give that little sucker an answer. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, exactly.  We got to wrap up.  We want to play the single from the new record, Hang Cool Teddy Bear.  Okay.  Now, see, I feel guilty now.  No, it's all good.  No, it's okay.  Tell him to go read the lyrics.  Oh, really?  It's right there?  It's right in the lyrics.  No, it's fine.  I liked your answer better.  Okay.  Los Angeles Loser.  What?  Los Angeles Loser.  Yeah.  What can you tell us about this song before we play it?  Los Angeles Loser, written by James Michael.  It goes with, the guy is, and I'm not going to tell you the story. 
[03:38:00]  It's just, it plays by itself, but there's no explanation.  All right.  Absolutely none.  Okay.  It's, it is not, no explanation.  It's self-explanatory.  What does it say here?  Oh, no.  I'm just pointing at the date so I, when I can promote the date.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  I thought maybe you had some explanation for the song.  No.  Because that would have really helped at this point.  No.  I never know how factual information is, you know.  Yeah, Meat Loaf sang with Black Sabbath.  Is that true?  That would have really helped a lot if you'd have had some, you know, factual.  Oh, the song, oh, it's written here. 
[03:38:30]  The song is about, nah, it's, it's about a guy, it's about a guy that's a Los Angeles  Loser, isn't he?  All right, why don't we just play the fucking thing?  Oh, and May 11th, yeah.  May 11th, the album comes out.  Push back.  Well, Meat Loaf, thank you very much for stopping by.  Oh, no, thank you guys.  The record's called Hank Cool, Teddy Bear, and this is Los Angeles Loser.  That's it.  And I'm going to, do you hear it in here?  Yeah, we can hear it in here.  Really?  Sure.  Well, we were going to make believe we were going to play it.  Jesus, Opie.  Now we have to play it because he's sitting right there.  That's right.  You have, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, boy.  Awkward.  Awkward.  Come on, he doesn't have the self-esteem for this kind of goofing.  You have self-esteem.  I have none.  I have none.  None.  All right, we'll play it for you.  All right, put your headphones on.  There it is.  There we go.  Oh, wow, I like the beginning of it.  It's very cool.  Would you stop it?  It's not playing.  It's playing.  Oh, I was getting ready to go, oh, which beginning is he talking about?  You're being an ass.  All right, here's the latest from Meat Loaf. 
[03:39:30]  Los Angeles Loser.  What?  May 11th comes out, the album.  All right, thank you, Meat Loaf.  Yeah, baby.  Thanks, man.  Yo, baby.  I wrote you this poem.  I'd like to dedicate it to you.  Oh, I'm just a white boy.  I played a guitar.  I put my pants on.  I drive a shit car up into the valley. 
[03:40:00]  Just see my girlfriend.  She got a big couch.  She got a Mercedes-Benz.  Sing hallelujah.  My glass is head full.  She pours me champagne.  She drinks a Red Bull.  And she says,  Darling, one thing you got to understand.  As long as I am satisfied with you,  You will always be my man.  You know that I, I'll give you all the love that I have. 
[03:40:30]  I'll empty all my pockets and I'll give you what I can.  You know that I, I'll give you all the love that I have.  I'll give you all the love that I have.  Los Angeles Loser.  Los Angeles Loser.  Los Angeles Loser.  Los Angeles Loser.  I'm going to give you all the love that I have.

And I'll be to step behind.  You know that I, I'll give you all the love that I have.  I'll empty all my pockets and I'll give you what I can.  You know that I, I'll give you all the love that I have.

[03:42:00]  Now, check this out.  I say this with the deepest appreciation for all you ladies out there.  Especially the ones who have shown a little love for someone such as myself.  Who believed in me.  Who loved me.  Oh, so friendly towards me.  And if it wasn't for you, there would be no need.
