<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in highly vulgar and sexually explicit conversation, focusing on sexual acts and body parts.  This was followed by a discussion of their contract negotiations with SiriusXM, expressing frustration and hinting at legal issues with another employee.  The political landscape, specifically the upcoming Obama/Romney election, became a focal point, with the hosts expressing their dissatisfaction using highly offensive language and mocking Chris Matthews.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to troubleshooting their malfunctioning app, blaming “Quick Play” and the station's technical staff with equally offensive language.  This led to a tangent about their unfair treatment regarding vacation time, culminating in Anthony's contentious request for three days off, prompting a bet on its approval.  This segment included numerous interruptions, discussions of Beyoncé's physique, pornography,  a bizarre picture of a management team member, and a humorous exchange about an employee's search history. E-Rock, a staff member, assisted in investigating Anthony's vacation request. A call to Radio Shack for technical support added comedic relief, followed by an Asian haircut bit and the "F.U. Line" segment.

The show then shifted to a discussion about a weather reporter mistakenly using "canoodling" instead of "chatting," prompting a vulgar exploration of various sexual acts, with invented names and descriptions.  A caller, a former weatherman, shared a similar story about a news anchor misusing a phrase.  Technical difficulties synchronizing a video of a dramatic news reporter with their audio followed, leading to more comedic banter. The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of the hosts' violent and sexually explicit dreams.

The next segment started with a bizarre hypothetical about observing someone sleeping, transitioning into a critique of the Obama/Romney debate’s lack of substance.  Opie mentioned an upcoming performance at K.J. Farrell's in Belmore.  The discussion then focused on *The Odd Life of Timothy Green*, its unsettling content, and children's reactions.  A workplace dispute concerning Anthony's time off continued, involving his brother Joe and speculation about management's motives. A game to guess which coworker crashed into a glass window followed, using yes/no questions and crude language.  The segment concluded with further discussion of *The Odd Life of Timothy Green*, comparisons to *Coraline* and *Paranorman*, and personal anecdotes about childhood movies.

Another segment began with a discussion of Shawnee Smith's attractiveness, focusing on finding a flattering *American Graffiti* picture.  This led to conversations about emotional responses to movies (e.g., *Charlotte's Web*, *Timothy Green*, *Marley & Me*, *Click*, *The Lovely Bones*), personal anxieties, dreams, and fantasies, including rape and armed robbery.  Listener calls followed, featuring humorous workplace accident anecdotes. The segment ended with a discussion about a producer's crush, and the revelation that a pig costume/Egg McMuffin prank was orchestrated by Roland, not Troy.  Sam Roberts, the show's producer, was present throughout.


The final segment revisited an earlier insult involving "pig," "money," and "Egg McMuffins," with a discussion about the insult's offensiveness.  They planned for Troy to contact Roland regarding the incident, especially if substitute hosts Danny or Travis were present for the after-show.  The show concluded with goodbyes and an announcement of a break until after Labor Day.  A caller provided anecdotal information about Stacey Dash, contributing to the ongoing discussion about physical attributes.  No other guests besides Jim Norton and Sam Roberts were explicitly mentioned as being in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:03:30]  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what you're talking about.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow. Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this. 
[00:04:00]  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day.  Every day, that's what I say.  Are you guys having a good time or what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make a fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch. 
[00:05:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning.  The Anthony program.  Here it is.  Yeah, here it is.  All right.  For another day.  For now.  For now.  Can I just say, we have not signed a new contract.  Well, not yet.  Well, we'll see what happens. 
[00:05:30]  But everyone's asking for updates.  We're just looking for a very fair deal.  And so far.  I don't think we should discuss this on the air.  So far.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't think we should, though.  I'll discuss my side of it, then.  No, I don't think we should discuss it.  I'll discuss my side of it, then.  I don't think we should.  Why?  I don't give a fuck.  I know.  I don't think we should discuss it.  What are you scared of?  I'm not scared of anything.  I think legally, contractually, we're not supposed to discuss negotiations on the air.  Well, I think they need to know that we're still not signed.  Well, we could say that. 
[00:06:00]  I don't think any details are probably not a good idea.  I'm just looking for a fair deal.  We could say that.  All right.  A very fair deal.  That's good.  We could say that.  Hopefully that'll happen in 37 days.  We'll see.  I'm hoping.  I could say that.  You could say that.  I'm hoping.  You don't need to panic.  Don't panic.  It don't matter anymore.  It doesn't matter.  None of this matters.  I just don't like that contractual fucking... 
[00:06:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Fucking around contractually.  Oh, really?  They got a guy that's suing the company.  I think we'll be all right.  Well, that's a special fucking case.  He could do anything.  Yeah, he's God all right.  He could do whatever he wants.  He sucks.  He stinks.  He was a big bust for this company.  Everyone knows it.  He could do whatever he wants over there.  I'm just letting...  You know, there's a lot of people very concerned out there, so I'm just giving him an update. 
[00:07:00]  Because some think we did sign.  Some think it's just...  Yeah, business as usual.  I think we would have gotten on and said that we did.  Gee.  Jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  It don't matter.  Whatever.  Whatever happens, happens.  What?  October, huh?  October 1st, yeah.  Oh, man.  It's close.  Huh?  It is close.  Yeah.  I don't want summer ending.  I hate when summer ends. 
[00:07:30]  It's just a drag.  You're not in school anymore.  Ah, it's fucking...  It's the same, though.  I get the exact feeling I did when I had to go back to school.  Why?  Yeah, why?  I just do.  I don't know.  I have fun in the summer.  I have fun in the winter, but it's not as much fun as the summer.  Well, you've got to build a dome.  I've just got to encase my house in a dome.  Are you allowed to build a dome?  Hell no.  On your property?  Why?  It's your property.  Yeah, well, apparently...  That old gag.  That old gag of how free you are in this country. 
[00:08:00]  We're the freest nation in the world.  Fuck you.  We're not free to do shite.  I told Anthony before the show that this whole country is a fraud.  It's a fraud.  It really is.  The wool is pulled over everyone's fucking eyes.  Are you ready?  Let's just have fun today.  Let's just do this.  Let's just speak our minds.  Stop holding back.  Just a fraud.  The hypocrisy that goes on.  Well, because Chris Matthews is in front of, what, that big fucking rock? 
[00:08:30]  Rock formation out there.  In front of Mount Rushmore.  Mount Rushmore.  Which is a natural rock.  There was a natural occurrence on Mount Rushmore.  What?  It came up and just made faces of the president.  And the faces were just like that?  Amazing.  Over millions of years.  But how did they become presidents that looked like those faces?  You fucking tell me.  That's really strange.  It's natural erosion from wind and rain.  Can you play that fucking little piece to Chris Matthews?  Because I love how people love to say that the founding fathers really meant well. 
[00:09:00]  They were taking advantage of what was in front of them as well.  Right.  It just worked out better for those guys, I guess.  But they weren't goody two-shoes.  They weren't nice people.  No.  No.  They had some ideas that would really make their lives a lot better.  Just to make their lives easier.  And then if other people's lives got a lot better, then so be it.  Yeah, we don't like the way the fucking king and shit is fucking with us, so we'll come  here and make some cool rules ourselves, pronto, or we'll just be bogus, too. 
[00:09:30]  This country has never, never gave a shit about the individual.  But I love how they all make believe it's about the individual.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Spicoli really did have it.  Of course he did.  Just be bogus, too.  What is this?  Let's play the Chris Matthews thing.  Hey.  Chris Matthews.  Well, we just like...  Coming out here to Mount Rushmore, it reminds you...  We just like how he sounds like Brian Regan.  Issues of equality.  Issues of the pursuit of happiness. 
[00:10:00]  Issues of freedom.  And this country's standing for something.  These guys were all looking forward to what they wanted to build in this country.  For themselves.  And this place reminds you of that.  That it's not just about petty arguments over tax and environmental regulations.  But it's about what kind of country you want to live in.  Petty arguments over tax...  Because the petty arguments are over the other person's side.  If you ask him, he's got no problem with his position on taxes.  Right. 
[00:10:30]  Shut up.  It's all just stupid.  More hypocrisy and bullshit.  You know, I know as an individual, I should be voting for Romney, but he scares the fuck out of me.  And it's sad that as we move into an election with Obama and Romney as our choices, it just shows how pathetic this country is.  That's our choices, really?  I'll tell you one thing.  That's what this great country has to offer?  Yeah.  That's it.  That's all you get. 
[00:11:00]  Out of everyone in the United States that is eligible to run for president...  We get these two guys.  That's all you got, really.  You're Ron Paul!  Dude, why don't you talk about Ron Paul, then?  Because Ron Paul, he's the choice...  No.  He can't win.  We're down to the two people, period.  That's how it works in this country.  Look at all the dummies on the short list.  Herman Cain was on that dumb short list.  Remember that?  That other guy that we already forgot about. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, Santorum.  And the other guy.  And then you got the Sarah Palin.  Yeah, I'm throwing them all in from the last couple of elections.  Just a bunch of dummies.  And that's it.  This was the best?  That's the best we got.  Something is broke.  Something is fucked up.  We got one crazy guy that looks like he's fucking...  Looks like his head's ready to explode whenever he talks.  Who?  Romney.  Well, Romney...  He's just like, eh.  And then we got a president in here who apparently just gave up on his job halfway through to 
[00:12:00]  start pitching himself for his job again.  It's just astounding to me.  So we should be campaigning.  Yeah.  To continue here.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I can't in all conscience vote for Obama, so I gotta vote for the other guy.  That's what I gotta do.  I will not be voting.  No, huh?  Then you shouldn't have a voice in this country.  You shouldn't have a voice. 
[00:12:30]  If you don't vote, then you should shut your mouth.  You don't have the right to say anything if you don't, you vote.  A lot of people protest by not voting.  Thank you.  What that means in the end?  I don't know.  I don't either.  Because in the end, no one gives a fuck.  Yeah.  No one gives a fuck if 100 people vote for the president.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  So I guess in a weird way, it's a lame protest. 
[00:13:00]  I'll acknowledge that.  Because then they just go, well, not a big voter turnout.  Yeah, that's all they care about.  They don't say, well, not a big voter turnout.  So I guess it shows that people are really upset.  That shows that a lot of people were not happy with the choices.  Yeah.  That's what they should say.  Yeah.  But I'm not allowed to have an opinion because I don't vote.  Nah.  Oh, another guy not voting.  Nice.  Kevin from Connecticut.  And he knows shit about fucking Skid Row.  Ooh.  Yeah.  So I don't know. 
[00:13:30]  It is just a bunch of hypocrites.  I was talking before the show, that whole Egyptian thing.  There's in a lot of these countries.  I really don't know the Egyptian thing.  Well, there's, in Egypt, everybody was all psyched.  I don't understand how so many of these assholes were psyched about this Egyptian spring that happened.  Right.  Where they were all protesting for democracy.  Yeah, nice.  And everybody was like, oh, democracy, democracy.  There is no sign of democracy in Egypt. 
[00:14:00]  What do you mean?  They did the whole thing.  Well, the Muslim Brotherhood pretty much just took over.  What happened to the bread helmets?  The bread helmets.  What happened to the rocks?  Eric, they're gone.  No more bread helmets.  So what happened?  I thought they took care of everything.  Arab Spring, man.  What happened was the Muslim Brotherhood took over.  Is that good?  Some of the most oppressive motherfuckers out there.  So why would they accept that?  Why would the people of Egypt accept that?  Because they have no choice. 
[00:14:30]  There's no democracy there.  But they fought for a choice.  They got Mubarak out.  Confused.  And the vacuum was filled with another bunch of savages that fucking are living in ancient times.  Opportunists.  Of cutting people's heads off.  You know, you could protest gay rights all you want here.  And I love how the homosexual will bash the shit out of the country and people that disagree with their lifestyle. 
[00:15:00]  And here you're allowed to do that.  You could disagree with somebody's opinions and lifestyle and voice that disagreement.  And they talk like you went out and beat the shit out of him because he was gay.  No, you just mentioned I'm not fond of that lifestyle.  Meanwhile, it's easy to protest here.  Nothing happens to protesters here.  The second a cop, like, grabs someone's arm to get them back up on the sidewalk behind the lovely gates and stuff, they start screaming police brutality. 
[00:15:30]  Meanwhile, you're so brave, and I don't just mean the gays, I mean anyone that wants to protest anything in this country.  You're so brave, go to Egypt and start protesting your homosexuality or for homosexuality.  They will saw your head off.  You will die.  It is illegal to be gay.  Yet we pump fucking money into that country for some ungodly reason. 
[00:16:00]  And that's not just the only case in the world.  We're giving money.  China's another thing.  Human rights violations in China?  Just stop trying to talk about what's going on in this country and how you're offended by someone's speech and that they should be fired for this or chastised or have to apologize when you're supporting shit in other countries where people are dying because of what you're supposedly protesting here.  So what are we supposed to do?  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  That's the problem.  I don't know.  How do we make change?  How do we make real change?  You can't really make change because what I just said, the second you start voicing something that upsets somebody, you're just, you got the scarlet letter put on you.  You're a fucking fanatic.  You're an asshole.  You're this.  There's a soldier that wrote some shit on his Facebook page about the country.  Doesn't like it.  And it was some crazy shit, too.  You know, the 9-11 conspiracy shit. 
[00:17:00]  He believes it.  He thinks the government is way too entrenched in everybody's lives.  And the government is saying, well, he wasn't arrested.  We detained him and put him in a mental institution for observation because he was writing some sketchy things there.  Well, you're allowed to write sketchy things.  Well, you used to be allowed.  Yeah.  You're not allowed as much.  And by the way, this is due to a law that Obama signed last year. 
[00:17:30]  I mean, it's...  The Patriot Act?  You're allowed to...  Didn't he have the Patriot Act before Obama?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So this started a little while ago.  Oh, but he...  No, he...  But he ramped it up?  Yeah.  He ramped it up with this lovely thing.  The NDAA.  You really hate Obama, huh?  No, I don't hate Obama.  I hate a lot of the...  I hate his hypocrisy.  I just wish you would...  I hate how he's bamboozling everybody into them thinking he's this wonderful humanitarian. 
[00:18:00]  I get why you hate Obama, but I just wish you would hate them all.  I do.  I've voiced how I do.  I think more and more you're showing that.  I do hate them all.  Because I hear your disappointment with the Republican Party as well.  But I've got to have some type of position, and my position is...  But it's fun not to have a position.  I don't have a position.  I love it.  I kind of like having a...  I love it.  But it's based on my own feelings.  You're going to have to wait on line somewhere.  Nah.  I'd run right in.  I'd run right in. 
[00:18:30]  Run right out.  It's fun to not have a position.  It really is.  I kind of like a position.  I mean, I'm fucking around, obviously.  I would love to fucking have a guy.  I would love to have a guy.  Like, yeah, this guy.  I'm getting behind this guy.  But I don't have a horse in this race.  No.  Nah.  In the end, I just don't.  I kind of like the...  I kind of like the...  You just grab all the info as much as you can and kind of make your own opinion.  But, I mean, obviously, I can't get behind a guy like Obama. 
[00:19:00]  So I got to go to the next thing.  Yeah, black guy.  I can't do that.  I mean...  Can't do the black guy thing.  I mean, put it this way.  Even if Biden was running...  He's running in 2016.  Good luck.  There's rumors.  Good luck.  There's plenty of Democrats that could be running that are lily fucking white that I would not vote for.  You think if Al Franken was running for president...  Al Franken!  I would vote for him over an asshole Republican? 
[00:19:30]  No.  Because he's more of an asshole Democrat.  I just couldn't...  I think we had him on the show once, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a shithead.  But everybody, of course, just uses the race angle with me.  Oh, you just don't want to vote for Obama because he's black.  No.  If a white guy had exactly the same policies as Obama, I wouldn't like him.  Over the years.  Well, you know...  Indirectly.  What are you going to do?  You sort of made that very clear over the years.  What are you going to do?  I have...  You sort of have.  Nah.  People have been reading between the lines. 
[00:20:00]  But it's, you know...  You might have done that one to yourself, sir.  But it's this show that has me pigeonholed.  You have intelligence to you, but you might have...  Well...  You might have...  I'm called a racist.  Made that point very clear.  I'm embracing the word racist like black people have embraced nigga.  Oh, shit.  You can't say it, right?  Yeah.  And it's a derogatory term, yet they've embraced it as their own word.  Well, I'm doing that, too.  I've been called it so many times, and people are trying to get at me with it, that now I'm 
[00:20:30]  just embracing it.  Well, that's not...  Oh, I got to be racist?  You're racist.  I'm racist.  Oh, you're racist.  If you say racist, that's the bad way.  Yeah.  The R...  I want to be called the R word.  Wow.  Ron and Fez...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  What happened?  Well, our app is busted.  That's weird.  That never happens.  Uh-oh.  Fix the online feed so Ron and Fez aren't playing.  Oh, cool.  What the fuck? 
[00:21:00]  How you doing?  What the fuck?  Really?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Hey, what the fuck?  The app is broken again.  This goddamn app.  I'm sorry.  Why does that happen?  I don't even know what to tell you people.  Why does that happen?  We don't know.  We don't know why things happen.  I don't get it.  Nothing gets fixed.  Nothing.  The seven year.  The works here.  You really want to continue, huh?  Here.  In October.  What?  The same app.  Well, I enjoy doing radio.  Oh, I'll...  But, uh... 
[00:21:30]  We'll certainly be doing radio.  If the right situation presents itself.  But, you know, I'll fucking continue doing radio.  Of course.  That's how, uh...  That's how it works.  Well, you gotta...  They gotta fix the basic shit.  You're in the big city.  Well, what do you got, Sam?  Put it up to the mic.  Because people say we bullshit a lot.  Oh, it's fixed?  No.  Let's hear.  Uh, here's Chuck.  Chuck, you're on the run of Fez.  This is what they're hearing on the app right now?  How does this happen? 
[00:22:00]  The pad data says run of Fez Wednesday replay.  But how does that happen?  How is that possible?  They must be...  At least two hours behind.  So...  Wait, our delay is now two hours behind?  Two hour delay.  Cool.  Because the run of Fez Wednesday replay goes off live  at 5 a.m.  That's when the replay ends.  What the fuck, Ski?  This is...  Come on, man.  Just don't get it.  This is lying.  Come on.  Really? 
[00:22:30]  Because leave because of flowers.  Exactly.  I'm Reggie the florist.  What happens here?  I don't know what happens here.  It's always only us.  Go to any other show, any other channel,  and listen, and it's exactly what it's supposed to be on.  We have so many layers of people that work for this channel,  and the basics just can't get done.  Nothing.  Ever.  Ever.  Oh, whatever.  I don't fucking know.  We can't even get the app right.  We live in an app world. 
[00:23:00]  It's kind of important to have your app right.  Yeah.  Don't you think?  I would think.  In this day and age, it's cutting edge.  It's right there.  And look, if it was a one-time thing,  what are you going to do?  Things do happen.  Oh, yeah.  But the fact remains, this app is so shitty.  Shitey.  Shitty.  It looks good.  There's a bunch of shitheads.  It looks good.  It looks good.  That are responsible around here that have no idea what they're doing.  And I guarantee you,  the layers of people that are involved with this channel 
[00:23:30]  aren't even awake yet.  Yeah.  Because they don't give a fuck either.  So why should I?  I'll speak for myself.  Why should I?  Yeah.  6.30 in the morning.  6.30.  They got to sleep in, right?  Early.  Scotch.  Huh?  That's a line from Mr. Mom.  Oh, right.  6.30 in the morning.  Scotch.  It's a good movie.  Fucking, they've been playing it lately, right?  I've seen it.  Like, we were talking about it on the air,  and then Mr. Mom.  Movie Mr. Mom.  Did you like that movie?  It's fucking funny, man.  It's a great movie.  It's a funny fucking movie.  And it's still funny. 
[00:24:00]  No, come on.  Yeah, I swear.  What makes it funny?  Ah, fucking, it's just funny.  I find it very fucking...  Funny?  Funny.  Mr. Fucking Mom.  I guess it started out, the app.  Yeah, Michael Keaton, right?  The app started out playing the O&A show,  and then it went to Ron and Fez.  And they got tired of the show.  But how does that happen?  They got tired of the show.  Like, I want to hear Ron and Fez.  Is it in a computer?  Did someone load it wrong? 
[00:24:30]  Like, how does that happen?  Well, it's definitely not a loading issue.  Like, it's nobody here,  because from what I understand,  the streaming is outsourced.  So the actual streaming web content  comes from another location.  But why does it fuck up so much?  That's a great question.  And I've asked a question on Twitter.  We've asked on the air.  Does this happen to any other channel?  And the answer comes back, no.  So that means people should be fired. 
[00:25:00]  Fired.  Fired.  Yeah, I mean...  This is a shitty economy.  There's so many people that don't have jobs,  and these idiots still have jobs,  and they can't even do their job.  Yeah.  What does it take to get fired around here?  I know people leave on their own  because they can't wait for a better opportunity,  but...  Oh, yeah.  How do you fire someone around here?  It's astounding.  Dude, in my own family,  I got a ton of people looking for work.  They know how to program websites? 
[00:25:30]  Dude, I could pull a cousin or a brother in here  in a second,  and they would do just as good  of a job as those dopes down the hall.  What?  And that's the truth.  And you ask, like,  who's in charge of that?  And it's this vagary,  more vagary.  No one knows who to ask to fix it.  Yeah, because everyone,  they write and they go,  who can I email right now?  This second.  And I DM these people back  and I go,  I don't know. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe that's why...  That's my answer.  I don't know.  That's probably why they outsource.  And guess what?  I don't know.  And I've asked a question  around these hallways.  And they're like,  well,  the,  well,  if you,  it's all this vague.  Very vague.  This vagueness.  Yeah.  None of these guys pull out  millions of dollars  in stock options  for doing nothing.  Oh, nice.  Oh,  some of those.  That would be nice, right? 
[00:26:30]  That would happen.  Sure.  Sure would be.  Things have got to change.  I think,  I'm going to go out on a limb here,  I think the problem with the app  is that a lot of people  are using the ONA app.  And I've told these people that.  Like in droves  and it can't handle the traffic.  I think this type of show  is very popular  in the app world.  Sure.  You're not going to get an app  to listen to like,  I don't know,  the Pearl Jam channel.  And I love the Pearl Jam channel.  You've got Pearl Jam 
[00:27:00]  on your phone already.  It's on your iPod.  Right.  Whatever,  your music.  But these type of shows  were made for the app.  So if a lot of people  are trying to use the app,  I think that's when  it gets a little buggery.  Is buggery a word?  My app today.  Eddie Vedder gets all pissed off  that the app doesn't work.  Oh, he's just yelling on the phone.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Why don't you fix it?  Why don't you fix it? 
[00:27:30]  That's the wrong Pearl Jam song  is playing.  It's all Pearl Jam songs.  Like he's listening to it,  he knows like,  what he's supposed to be playing,  and it's like the wrong  fucking song.  Oh my God.  Eddie is mad  at the app today.  I'm getting worried  that Howard 100  seems to be in a replay too.  I am.  Oh, well that could be.  Oh, I see.  You got the joke there. 
[00:28:00]  He's done his four shows  for the month.  Oh.  I did get that joke.  He did his four shows  for the month.  I guess AGT was on, huh?  Was it?  But these idiots down the hall  are going to bitch and complain  because we've run out  of vacation days.  That makes sense.  Nice.  Nice.  It's going on vacation.  I can't wait to see  how that plays out.  I'm proposing  that I take off  next week,  Wednesday,  Thursday,  and Friday.  So then I have 
[00:28:30]  Saturday, Sunday,  and then Monday  because of the  Labor Day weekend.  Right.  So you squeeze  almost a week.  So I'm squeezing  almost a week  by just taking my three days.  Don't kill the messenger.  All I'm saying is  good luck.  Good fucking luck.  I heard.  Because my summer vacation,  and I'm not bitching  you fucking assholes.  I'm just telling you  what happens in my life.  I got a very good life.  I get it.  You don't have to tell me  that and remind me.  But when it comes down  to a summer vacation  and you get three days, 
[00:29:00]  it kind of pisses you off.  There's a lot of buzz  around your tweet.  Which one?  Your three-day  summer vacation tweet.  I was just a buzz about it.  There was a buzz about it.  Yeah, people are like,  stop bitching.  I'm like,  I'm not bitching.  I'm just,  it says,  Twitter is,  what are you doing?  What do you want to say?  Well, I want to say  that I had a three-day  summer vacation  and I'm bothered by that.  Yeah.  Does that mean  I have a shitty life?  Of course not.  But when you have to like,  your wife,  your two-year-old,  and your wife who's, 
[00:29:30]  what is she,  about eight months pregnant now?  Oh man, yeah.  Go away without you  because you don't have  enough vacation days.  Oh no.  And you have to join them  in mid-week.  Yeah, that's bothersome.  Oh no.  So then Ann comes in  and don't kill the messenger  because this was going to get to them  no matter what.  You know that.  Uh-oh.  They are going to have a problem  with you taking off  next Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  I certainly hope not.  It's all legit.  Do you have the days?  I think the last time  I took any time off  was when I was sick. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, that was around my birthday.  They have the days  down to the hour.  Or something, yeah.  I got two days left,  they told me.  I got two days vacation left.  Nice.  When are you going to take  your two days then?  Nice.  I might have to take it  when my wife has a baby.  Oh, come on now.  This is how pathetic it is.  You're not dedicated.  I'm saving my two fucking days.  No, because if we go back in time,  I was actually, you know,  I don't know if it officially happened,  so I got to be honest about that,  but they told me  that they were going to take pay away  because I used a couple extra days 
[00:30:30]  of vacation one year.  That they were actually  going to take my pay away.  You don't get paternity leave?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Yeah, you should get  a paternity leave.  On top of what?  Vacation days?  Yeah, fuck yeah, man.  Usually, like, a company,  like, I know you guys  are contracted,  so it's different,  but, like, if I could  take paternity leave.  You get paternity leave.  Or maternity leave.  Like, if I want to  fucking take some time off,  I'm not going to bitch up.  I'm going to knock a bitch up.  You will.  Take some paternity leave. 
[00:31:00]  I'm going to use that word,  niggle.  You can.  Who gave you the okay?  I know.  The weird thing about  when it was just XM,  we never even kept track  of our days off.  It just worked out  for everybody.  Oh, yeah.  The listeners didn't feel  like we took too many.  I personally didn't feel  like I took too many.  The company was cool with it.  And guess what?  In the end,  we did take extra days.  And they didn't give a fuck.  This fucking bald-headed  fuck down the hall,  oh, shit.  it's going to be fun today. 
[00:31:30]  Enjoy.  Oh, shit.  He fucking,  he's fucking,  he's fucking got a,  he's got charts  and everything.  Oh, you only have  five days left.  Graphs.  He comes to me,  oh, you only have  five days left  between now  and October 1st.  I go,  but I want to take a week  because my wife  is down there  with my two-year-old  and she's eight months pregnant.  I don't really want her down  and, you know,  at the shore by herself.  Yeah, but you only have  five days left.  I double-checked it.  He actually said  I double-checked it. 
[00:32:00]  And then I told Blatter  to tell him  to check again.  Check again.  Check it again.  So have fun with that,  Ant.  I'm looking, sir.  No, sir, you don't, sir.  I don't have any days  for you, sir.  And I hope you take him anyway.  I really do.  What if they tell you  you don't have the days?  Yeah, but I can't take it.  Are you serious?  I don't want to get docked.  Just take him.  One day is some righteous cash.  I bet.  Just take him.  I might.  I'll see what they say. 
[00:32:30]  I'll see what they say  and how they fucking say it.  And that's how I'll act accordingly.  Oh, man.  No, I got to tell you.  You don't like that color.  That's not bad.  You don't like that color.  That ain't a bad black chick  right there.  You don't like that.  No, I've had my eye  on her a while.  Really?  That's not bad.  That's a little tasty  brown sugar right there.  Could you please have sex  with a black girl?  Please.  For the show?  It would be a week of radio.  Just do it.  I know.  Who gives a fuck?  You've done worse?  No, but it would have to be 
[00:33:00]  like that type of...  It would have to be  that type of black girl.  Come on, man.  Just do one black girl.  She looks fucking good.  Is she coming back this way  at any time soon?  I want to see the front.  Do a black girl.  Yeah?  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the bit.  I don't know if I could do that  without it.  But she'd have to fall  into an exact criteria  of a black chick for me.  Like old school Francine.  Well...  That was good.  Now new school Francine. 
[00:33:30]  I don't want to touch  new school Francine.  I want to develop...  Like we used to have  to do this in radio.  Profile?  We have to profile  who we're talking to.  A profile?  And boy, at this point  we know who we're talking to.  Big fat fucks.  I might lose...  There's some ladies in Chicago.  No, we love the big fat fucks.  I'm sorry about that.  I might lose my cred  on a certain website  if I do that.  Come on, let's profile  your black girl.  How tall does she have to be?  They call me  what they call  an oil derrick.  You're so racist. 
[00:34:00]  No, that's what they call it.  But you know this stuff.  The other way around  it's called a coal burner.  You've called me that before.  Yes.  I did call...  I did call you  an oil derrick.  Yeah.  Holy mother of God.  All right, let's go.  Let's profile Ant's Black Chick.  You gotta do this for the show.  I want a Black Chick.  Ant's Nubian Princess.  Yes.  Okay, we're looking for...  How tall?  I don't want one of these  goddamn  marathon running 
[00:34:30]  tall ones.  Okay.  I need one that's just...  Actually...  Anywhere between  five...  Four and five...  Six.  Okay.  Wow, all right.  Five, four, five, six.  Someone that's not intimidating.  But now there's a problem.  Why?  Because you start getting  that height,  you're talking fucking  exactly the same  laying on her side.  The problem is  the ass is gonna look  out of proportion.  That's why you gotta go 
[00:35:00]  taller girl.  No.  No.  How much  do you want her to weigh?  Like 220?  220?  I'm looking for  a black girl  four...  Five, four to five, six  that weighs...  Don't forget about  that ass.  I don't...  We're gonna get to  that ass.  No, because they're...  Be quiet.  The weight.  When are you going  on vacation?  Tomorrow.  Shit.  Fucking God.  I got this.  The weight.  The ass is next, Sam.  Yeah, but the weight 
[00:35:30]  is in the ass.  I'm going 110.  That's a skinny bitch.  That's a skinny bitch.  But I don't want  crackhead 110.  But you're not gonna  get black ass with that.  If you go black,  you want a little ass.  I don't want...  No, I don't.  A little ass.  That's not how Patrice  used to talk about  the black ass,  but you want a little  fucking bump.  Because I gave it  five, four to five, six.  110 to 120.  You might get a little...  You need a little booty. 
[00:36:00]  I don't want  black, big ass.  Show him some  black booties, Sam.  No!  Not the crazy  black booties.  Show him some  fucking medium  black booties.  I don't want that.  This is like  fucking building  your Tiger Woods  character.  Tiger Woods  where you build  the...  Oh, God!  What are you doing?  You got men!  What's wrong with you, Sam?  You put medium  black ass.  How about female?  How about girl?  How about...  You are so fucking...  Ugh!  No, because I know...  I know you don't want 
[00:36:30]  it too big,  but the black girl  could get some shit  done with their booties.  I don't want that  kind of shit done!  That's what I don't  like about...  But I'm not saying  that it has to be  that big.  No, I don't like  anything like that.  Somewhere like,  yeah, just a little  fucking...  Like, where it's  just a little more  curve.  Uh-uh.  I like...  That's why I adore  a white woman.  That's a flat ass  for a black girl.  No, that doesn't  look good.  Okay, so you need  it a little bigger  than that.  But that's for anyone  that isn't a good ass.  No, I get it. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, that one right there.  Where is that?  No!  Sam!  Get that fucking  big ass out of here!  Sam has jungle fever.  All right, right there.  Don't leave me, Rock.  With the black panties  half...  Right there, yeah.  It's white.  That's white.  There's a little black  in there.  That's great.  I like that.  Wearing those fucking...  Wearing those little panties.  Those boy shorty panties.  All right, what else?  So what kind of ass  do you want on this, Brog?  I want a nice ass  for anybody.  For a white chick, 
[00:37:30]  a black chick.  So you want a white ass  on a black girl?  I want a black chick  with a white chick's body.  Oh, that's not fun.  Nah, the contrast is fun.  That's not fun.  Just color contrast.  I don't want fucking...  That's not fun.  If you're gonna go black,  you gotta have  some of the black features.  And you gotta have  some fucking calves  on her legs.  Calves?  Black chicks tend to have  just sticks for legs.  Like skinny black chicks?  I swear to God,  I've never noticed that before.  Don't look at every skinny...  And I'm talking skinny black chicks. 
[00:38:00]  But guys have calves.  They never have calves.  What kind of calves?  I don't mean big fucking  bowling pin Jimmy Norton calves.  Well, he's got terrific calves.  We all know that.  Ah.  He should be in the calves magazine.  What is it called?  Cavs Weekly?  Cavs Monthly.  Oh, Monthly?  Oops.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess it would be monthly.  Cavs Monthly.  It's very hard to come out  with a week's worth  every week  coming out with some calves.  See how much I suck?  They really have like  these skinny,  like tapered legs  that taper from the knee  to the feet  without any shape whatsoever.  Why is that, you think?  Oh, that's a pretty black girl 
[00:38:30]  right there.  That's beautiful.  She's pretty nice.  Okay, look.  I think you found her.  That's pretty nice.  Who's this chick?  I'm a fan of the black girl  that has white eyes.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, she's got like  big blue eyes.  Yeah, the eyes  are a little lighter  than usual.  Something happened,  I would say,  around 1805  that gave her  those nice blue eyes.  So are you thinking  you might have sex  with a black girl?  I would her.  What about the one  you saw in Chicago 
[00:39:00]  you were losing  your mind over?  I forgot to talk about that.  The waitress  or the hostess.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was very surprised.  You were like,  you were all about it.  She was sort of  like a model, though.  She was tall.  She was probably  5'10", I think.  Yeah, she looked pretty good.  She kind of had  some of that afro  going on.  See, look.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  I don't know.  When I'm shopping for black,  I really gotta,  I have quite,  I'm very picky.  You're being very conservative. 
[00:39:30]  Am I?  Yeah.  You gotta go a little booty.  No, I don't.  A little booty.  Just a little booty.  I wouldn't even be able  to do it.  Just a little.  I'm not saying like crazy.  No.  Just a little.  I don't like anything  where I'm looking at.  Like this.  Ready?  And then it kind of goes like,  see where I stop?  And then I come back in?  No.  No?  No.  I'm not talking like this.  Where actually,  it starts going back up.  It goes back up.  Yeah, yeah.  Before the round is.  I'm not talking that.  The shelf on the back.  The lower back shelf. 
[00:40:00]  Man, we saw a stripper in Atlanta.  I'll never forget her.  She had a,  ooh, I almost did a Jimmy the Greek.  But she,  how do I say this?  She had extra meat.  Yeah.  I almost said muscle.  I'll be honest.  I almost said muscle.  That's true.  But she had extra fucking meat  on her ass.  Yeah.  It was the most amazing thing  and it wasn't,  it wasn't big.  Very odd.  But there was something extra on her.  A little something extra.  Where if she bent over just slightly,  you could absolutely put,  put your beer bottle on, 
[00:40:30]  on her backside.  You could rest it right on that shelf.  But it wasn't big.  I don't know what that's all about.  What about the boobies?  It is some,  um,  okay.  Black broads could fucking grow some boobies.  No.  I've seen some boobies out there.  I've seen some horrid,  horrid tits on some black chicks.  Uh,  uh,  fried eggs,  droopy,  where the nipple,  let me tell you something.  For some reason,  the nipple seems to be south of the border  a lot of times.  There's a,  an equator on a,  on a boob, 
[00:41:00]  where if the nipple is,  uh,  on or above the equator,  they look very perky and nice.  The same boob with the nipple  below the equator  does not look good.  Well,  when you have a six-year-old  hanging from that day,  it's gonna,  it could be.  It's gonna cause some damage.  It could be.  But I gotta tell her.  See there,  I think if we were building  the black girl for you,  I think Sam's got it right there.  And look,  there's a little booty,  but nothing to be scared of.  I'm a little scared of the booty.  A little.  She's got full  B's to,  uh,  maybe a, 
[00:41:30]  maybe a C cup.  She needs a little lotion  on that ass and elbows,  too.  Well,  you know.  Jesus.  Problem in the community.  Oh,  okay.  Uh,  what do you think of that one?  She's got the lighter eyes.  Uh,  yeah,  you know what?  She's not all afro'd out.  She's not crazy.  Mm-hmm.  Uh,  any more of her?  Any more pics?  Mm-hmm.  Scroll down a little?  All right,  let me see,  let me see.  Oh,  yeah,  who is this?  Yeah,  you know,  who is that chick?  I don't know what her name is.  she's just described as a black model  in purple lingerie.  All right,  so,  black model in purple lingerie.  So,  can we call her and ask her 
[00:42:00]  if she's up for this?  Oh,  right there.  Let me see that picture.  That's pretty good.  Yeah,  hello?  Could we,  uh,  could we have you for an evening?  Hmm.  Yeah,  I might fucking,  I might delve into that.  I don't know.  Uh,  her tits on that side one.  Go,  go back to that right there.  Uh,  would that look okay?  Yeah.  All right,  okay.  Should we put,  uh,  let me see some tits,  let me see some black women's tits  on the,  uh,  on the Google images. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Let's see what that looks like.  What kind of,  what kind of cup are we looking at?  Double D,  a G,  what do you want?  Two girls,  one?  What do you want?  Um,  oh,  Jesus Christ.  Oh,  get those torpedoes.  No,  no,  no,  no,  go to,  oh,  that's disgusting.  Oh,  get that off.  Go with the torpedoes.  One more over.  One more over right there.  Ew.  Yeah,  pop that up.  Oh God.  No.  They're massive,  but they're,  gravity's not killing them.  Not yet. 
[00:43:00]  She's probably fucking 13.  They're pushing outwards.  Jesus.  No?  No.  The areola's a little too big.  That ain't it.  All right,  pick your red breasts.  We got a lot of them on the screen.  All right.  Let me see.  You don't want too much separation.  Scroll down.  What about that one?  Right there.  Page tooth,  the third over.  Yes.  No,  they're giant nasties.  Come on.  Make it bigger.  You can't make it bigger.  What do you think?  What do you think?  No.  Those are like,  at least double D's.  It's terrible. 
[00:43:30]  But gravity not fucking them up.  I don't like big ones.  Oh,  we have to close the curtain,  really?  No one's even here yet.  Yeah.  Close that curtain.  God forbid that someone sees a boob  as they walk by the studio.  For a laying on her side,  that ain't bad.  Which one?  Yeah,  there.  You know,  but you can't tell.  Yeah,  you could tell.  They don't look too bad.  See,  because the one that's up in the air,  that should be closer to the ground,  and it's not.  It's not.  So you might be all right there.  I think those are implants,  though.  Let's see some more.  I'll go with the green, 
[00:44:00]  yes.  I think that's it.  God damn it.  That's good.  That's fucking disgusting.  She's got a tiny,  tiny green top,  and just massive boobs  that she can't contain,  and they're spilling out the sides.  They're hanging out over,  making it look like she has four breasts.  That's terrible.  You don't like that?  No,  not at all.  Mm-hmm.  Oh,  God,  the thing,  it looks like she laid it on the landing board.  Ignore the huge black penis,  but I think we found your boobs,  okay?  No.  That's not bad. 
[00:44:30]  Look at her nips.  That was bad?  Yeah.  What's wrong with the nips?  I don't know.  They just don't look right.  Oh, man,  I thought I had it for you.  Something's amiss there.  Let's see.  I'll know them when I see them.  I'll be like,  yeah,  there it is,  you know?  The girl with the arms up in the air?  Arms up?  Nope,  that's some voodoo going on.  Yeah,  that's a little crazy.  That's,  you know,  that's scary.  Oh,  my God.  Put the arms down,  the boobs fall a little further,  right?  Those will look in two different directions over there.  How about that one,  next to the girl in the red?  No.  No?  No, 
[00:45:00]  those are implants.  Whatever.  Yeah,  but the implants,  you can't tell as much.  How about down,  all the way to the right,  down there?  What does that look like?  Let me see.  Well,  once again,  ignore the big fucking penis.  Yeah,  those are implants,  but,  yeah.  Not bad,  though.  Not bad,  not bad.  You want to go natural,  right?  Yeah,  I want to see natural ones.  Okay,  you're not a fan of the tiny,  tiny areolas,  are you?  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  I'm not chased away by them,  but,  you know,  you need a little something there. 
[00:45:30]  I'm not scared away.  Okay.  I'm not frightened,  oh man,  see,  you know who I like?  Who?  Keep going to the right,  keep going there.  That's your broad.  Exactly.  You've done that broad a hundred times.  I'm looking at some fucking,  we're trying to get a little variety in your life.  White suicide girl right there.  Oh,  with the big fucking made up eyes.  Let's see.  How'd she get in that mix?  What about the girl with the smile?  That ain't bad.  Oh,  that's not bad.  Okay,  that could work.  That could work.  That's pretty good.  Boobs are a little big.  They are a little. 
[00:46:00]  A little.  Yeah,  you could fucking have some fun with that.  All right,  we got your boobs then.  All right.  What kind of hair?  You want to go wild?  Oh,  I don't want a fucking big afro.  Do you want chopped meat hair?  You don't want chopped meat?  You don't want chopped meat hair?  Do you want to go afro?  Put black chick hair.  I'm assuming you're going to need that flat,  right?  I'm going to need...  You're going to need that hair flat?  I would say go a little wild.  Go a little wild.  Yeah.  Oh, 
[00:46:30]  God.  Go a little wild.  No,  I don't want the chopped meat.  That's not chopped meat.  That's ground round.  Look at that.  That's Chuck.  Go a little wild.  Like,  fourth girl in.  Yeah,  like that.  No,  that's Wanda Sykes.  That's not Wanda.  It's her hair.  Go down the long hair girl.  Which one?  No,  up a little.  In the middle.  Dead center.  Oh,  I see.  Dead center.  Down.  No,  down.  Right there,  yes.  So that's more like wavy.  Yeah,  that's like that curly fucking Beyonce hair.  Down to her breasts. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  What about that?  That's Beyonce hair.  How about that?  I don't want the Angela Davis afro.  Come on.  I don't want the fucking fist in the air afro shit.  Go with the O.J. Simpson afro.  The O.J. afro.  Oh,  the girl from Clueless,  Paul from Long Island.  Yeah,  he nailed it.  Yeah,  that chick is pretty good.  I mean,  she might be,  she might have all the parts we're looking at.  Oh,  and look who knows her name.  She's almost 50.  Yeah,  I don't need that.  What are you talking about?  She is old now,  but I'm talking classic.  How old is Clueless? 
[00:47:30]  Mid 90s?  94,  95?  Yeah,  wasn't she also in Lethal Weapon?  Wasn't she the daughter in Lethal Weapon?  No.  No?  Put Daughter from Lethal Weapon on there.  Let me see her.  She's not almost 50.  She is in her 40s,  absolutely.  Daughter,  Lethal Weapon.  The girl from Clueless is in her 40s?  She's in her 30s.  Almost 30 at that movie.  Yeah,  she's deep into her 40s.  Oh my God.  All right.  She wasn't too bad for a,  she doesn't look good there,  but what about the black chick from 21 Jump Street 
[00:48:00]  when it was 21 Jump Street?  Yeah,  but that's,  that's too conservative.  Well,  that's me.  You gotta,  I'm not going crazy.  What do you think?  I said slightly wild.  I fucking just start drinking  and I go right for the fucking grain alcohol?  Why not?  I gotta ease in with some fucking light beer.  No.  The girl from Clueless is 46.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Over,  Johnny.  Why are we aging?  No,  I don't want Rihanna. 
[00:48:30]  No?  Wendy Williams.  No,  I don't want Rihanna.  Why Rihanna?  That giant billboard of Rihanna up in Times Square.  She's pretty sexy,  man.  That fucking thing is so goddamn retouched.  But what's wrong with Rihanna?  I'm just not feeling it.  Why?  Look at that.  Are you kidding me?  We got a naked photo of Rihanna.  Look at that.  Look,  if that's her,  that ain't bad.  That's really nice.  Let me see another one.  I need a second opinion.  Second opinion?  She was completely nude there.  What are you looking for?  Well,  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:49:00]  Let me see.  Yeah,  okay.  She ain't bad.  What about the ass?  She's got big ass?  No,  she's got the white ass.  I want that nigga in my ass.  Is that really her ass?  Yeah.  That's a deep crack.  That crack is,  that's the abyss.  Norton loves the deep crack.  That is a dark crack too.  Like it's fucking,  there's shadows in there.  Does the darkness scare you?  Yes.  Yeah,  I'm with you.  It's scary.  I don't like,  I don't like deep cracks.  Yeah.  It's scary.  You don't know what the fuck's in there.  Oh,  what's in there?  It is.  It's frightening.  Oh man.  That's like,  that's like going noodling. 
[00:49:30]  You don't know what's going to be in there?  You stick your fingers in there and a catfish grabs it.  That's,  but that looks good.  But you see how tiny her,  her waist is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's hiding a little with that elbow.  But see,  that's what I want for you is,  yeah,  the waist has to be tiny and then the,  the ass moves out a little bit more than,  more than white girls.  I wonder about the lady that wrote,  no,  I don't want the lady that wrote me a parking ticket.  I don't want fucking Michelle Obama. 
[00:50:00]  They're now they're bringing up,  you know,  I don't like,  no,  no,  Condi Rice.  No,  Beyonce.  No,  Beyonce's got a big fat fucking ass,  big fat ass.  Sam,  you are no judge of this because you have dipped,  you have dipped,  you have dipped into the forbidden fruit.  Well,  Oh God,  look at her fucking ass.  It's terrible.  Beyonce.  Beyonce's spent.  She's overrated. 
[00:50:30]  She's got a really,  she's got a very nice face.  She looked good in that Austin Powers movie,  but she's got a very nice face,  but the rest of her is,  is,  you know,  there's problems there.  Haggard.  Why doesn't anyone say it?  There's problems.  Big fat ass.  She's out of proportion.  No,  I don't want Rosa Parks.  Alicia Keys has the weirdest fucking body I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah.  She's another one.  Very pretty face,  but I don't know what's going on there.  We have a guy that went to school with the girl from Clueless. 
[00:51:00]  I guess it was his day to call to brag about it.  It's going to fucking finally has a story.  He finally got a story.  You want to just go with it?  Why not?  Why not?  Doug,  you went to high school with the girl from Clueless.  Yeah,  and I'm not calling a brag at all.  I just want to tell you how old she was because I went to school with her.  That's the only reason I know.  But we already said how old she is.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  She's 40.  She's 46,  according to our investigating. 
[00:51:30]  She graduated Paramus High School in 1984.  It was probably when I was calling in.  You guys mentioned that.  No worries.  I'm just fine.  She was very cool,  and she was beautiful in high school.  Beautiful.  Oh,  yeah,  you dug her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact,  I was in a band in high school,  pretty well known.  Yeah.  Ah,  he's gone.  Hey,  has Gary gotten back to you about the app?  Because it's still a problem,  Sam.  What happened?  People are saying if you have an Android or an iPhone,  you're not hearing the show. 
[00:52:00]  Which would be basically all app users.  Well,  he's responsible for the channel,  so I would assume that he's on it because we have an issue today,  right?  Or is he still sleeping?  Well,  he's,  I mean,  he's been on at the weather.  I don't know.  Has anyone tried to contact him to say,  hey,  the app once again is not working?  Travis has not heard back from him.  What happened?  Did he call him?  No,  I mean,  Gary should be calling us because he should be monitoring the channel.  Should be.  What happened?  For any potential problems.  What happened?  He's been under the weather. 
[00:52:30]  Why is it that we do all the work and these guys get paid for doing nothing?  I need to see this.  We come in here and do our jobs and hopefully entertain you fuckers.  We try.  And these guys get to collect paychecks for doing nothing.  They're not here?  I don't even know when they're,  I don't know when they're sick.  I don't know when they're on vacation.  I don't know anything about these guys.  I don't either.  But I do know they get a handsome check from SiriusXM.  Are they rewarded handsomely?  They absolutely are.  Handsomely? 
[00:53:00]  Hmm.  By the way,  your sick days counted toward your vacation.  That's what they told me.  I thought we had sick days and vacation days.  Yeah, no shit.  Oh.  So that Pertussis thing might be a problem.  Oh.  Remember that Pertussis thing?  I do remember that one.  Come on.  I swear to God.  Aw, come on.  Help me out, you fuckers.  I swear to God.  Who is that?  Beyonce.  Beyonce?  Look at that ass.  Big and fat.  Yeah, that's rough, man.  Good for Jay-Z, though.  That's what he's into.  What are you going to do? 
[00:53:30]  So, no solution on the app?  Because the guy who's in charge  doesn't even have a clue  that this is going down today?  Yeah.  Rob Cross has replied with a response.  About what?  The app.  What about my days?  Oh.  That's the next question.  What's the response on the app?  Rob Cross said, yeah.  Copy-paste from a year ago.  Yeah.  Two years ago.  Yeah.  Problem is Quick Play,  the company we work with on the app. 
[00:54:00]  Again, very big.  There's no one we can talk to.  It's the company we work with.  So, why are we still working with this company  if they don't get it right?  And how come other people,  other shows,  they only fuck our show up?  Right.  Is that it?  So, wait.  What else did he say?  We interrupted.  What else?  Other channels having problems off and on.  Off and on.  How come we're off?  Yeah.  Other channels off and on.  That's what he says.  Off and on.  We're off.  They're on.  That's what he meant.  And, you know,  Rob's all right,  to be honest with you.  But you hear the vagary in that. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Blame somebody else.  Other channels off and on.  Just this gray vagueness  that is all around us.  Good news.  Yes.  He says they're working on it.  Oh, good.  That's something I've never seen before in an email.  That they're working on it.  Oh, that's right.  More corporate speech.  We're working on it.  See, you can get out of a lot of trouble.  If your boss comes to you and you say,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  What about the Johnson file?  His aunt likes to say.  Johnson file.  The Penske file.  The Penske file.  All you have to say is, 
[00:55:00]  hey, working on it.  All right.  Then you work on that.  And then the boss marches back down  to his beautiful fucking office  that is way better than anyone else's.  Yeah.  And he looks out onto the city  and has a martini or whatever the fuck.  Right, right.  What do bosses do?  I don't even know anymore.  How do you become one of those guys?  I don't know.  I want to corner office and do nothing  and then collect massive stock options.  Right.  And then keep your people down  when it's time to do the right thing. 
[00:55:30]  What?  Did I just say that?  But why?  Aunt didn't say that.  I said that.  Your vacation request days have been put in.  Say it by put in.  Old man Leland's busting my hump over these reports.  You hear the put in?  Ah, yes, yes.  Meaning?  The request for the days has been submitted.  What do you mean submitted?  Why do they have to be submitted?  What do you mean submitted?  Can I get an answer right now?  Isn't the answer in the building?  I think the answer's somewhere in the building. 
[00:56:00]  No, he can't submit it  because Anthony already submitted by saying that's what he wants.  It's submitted.  We all are in agreement that it was submitted.  Submitted for your approval.  It's officially submitted, though.  What are you talking about?  When Aunt goes on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday off,  that's submitted already.  Yeah, but then it went through the channels,  is what I'm saying.  Look, I demand an answer on Anthony's vacation days  before 9 o'clock.  No vacation days had been submitted?  Submitted? 
[00:56:30]  The request hadn't been sent?  Denied.  Yeah, is it going to be a big denied in red fucking stamp?  They just stamp it,  Denied.  I want it.  I really know this company at this point.  I will bet you.  And I haven't won a bet in a long time, sir.  True.  A lot of people have collected my money lately.  I will bet just a safe little easy $100  that this is denied.  Denied?  Well, you're not going to get all three. 
[00:57:00]  They might.  They're not going to bend at all.  They're going to go to Gary's stupid charts.  I double-checked.  You only have two days.  And I will say that there's no fucking way  they're going to fucking do it.  You think no way?  No.  I have to have three days.  Because why do the right thing?  I had this conversation with Steve two days ago.  I said, look, we've done the right thing.  We have kept this channel live the entire...  How many weeks has this channel been dark there, E-Rock? 
[00:57:30]  Not counting weekends.  It's dark every day because Anthony, I get it.  Oh, now.  I don't think any full weeks  since you guys don't take vacations together.  Right.  So we don't take vacations together.  So the channel stays live if I'm away or Ant's away.  So the only time it's not live is probably around Christmas.  And then the occasional we take a Friday off, right?  Or, you know, like a federal holiday or something.  Right.  So I told Blatt, I go, it's just not right 
[00:58:00]  that you're busting our balls as far as vacation days go.  We have done the right thing.  We've kept this channel live as much as possible throughout the year.  Open the curtains.  Yeah, we're done looking at porn.  Looking at hardcore pornography.  Wow, breasts.  Jesus, it's crazy.  Open these up.  In the year 2012, we're looking at breasts.  We have to shut down.  Yeah, shut the curtains.  Holy fuck, man.  Like we're launching a missile.  It's crazy.  We got fucking missile codes. 
[00:58:30]  It's so ridiculous.  It really is.  But I had the argument with Blatter, not in a pissy way.  I just said, look, it just doesn't seem right.  Yeah.  You know, you got other shows around here that, fuck,  they completely take advantage of this place.  And then on top of it, sue you.  And they're allowed to do whatever the fuck they want.  And then we're here doing the right thing,  trying to pump out as many shows as possible a year.  And then you got an asshole that literally is double-checking  how many days off we got.  WTF. 
[00:59:00]  And calling.  Right.  And I'm the one that got hammered.  No.  By the way, no.  Of course not.  That's the chick.  And I was the one that got hammered because I was legitimately sick.  And after two days of sickness, they're calling, you know, Bob.  Did you get up and get down with the sickness?  I did.  Nice.  I did.  Why would you do that?  Why?  I don't know.  Why are you in a panic because I'm sick for three days?  Or ant's sick.  It happens.  What about leave of absences? 
[00:59:30]  What do you mean?  Can we take one of those?  I'm assuming you're contracted to do a certain number of shows.  Contracted to do a certain number of shows?  Then we have done that.  Hey, fucking Mr. Management, all right.  I mean, that's probably how it works.  That's probably why there's no distinction between vacation and sickness.  Then why would we keep the channel live then?  Like if Ant's on vacation and I'm on vacation and vice versa.  But we realized a long time ago that maybe we could squeeze out some individual shows  and keep the fucking channel live, giving them more content. 
[01:00:00]  I got it.  It's a strong loophole.  I got it.  You got it.  When we have the channel live, like say I'm here, Opie's on vacation, they only take off  half a day for Opie.  And then the same vice versa here.  Because the show's live.  He's taken off.  But the other half of the show is here, so he only gets half a day taken away from him.  So if you want a week or two weeks off, it really only counts as one week in your time.  But if we both take off, then we both get a day taken away. 
[01:00:30]  That should count.  It should.  And you know, the other side of this too, because we brought it up today, Anthony skated  on this one.  But one day recently in the last couple weeks, we decided on a Friday we're going to get out  of here around 9.  What was the exact time?  It was probably about 9.45.  9.45, right?  You're not exaggerating?  I think it was between 9.40 and 9.45.  All right.  So call it, I'll split it.  So we want to leave 17 minutes early on a Friday. 
[01:01:00]  Anthony somehow skated.  I almost got away.  And I'm at the elevator bank.  And I was getting screamed at.  It brought me back to my mom yelling at me for dumb, stupid shit.  It looked like Pac-Man.  And I was running.  How did you get away from that one?  Because I cut one way and Blinky got you.  But he is screaming at me, going, you can't just leave the show. 
[01:01:30]  Watch me.  And then I go, what about all the days we go way past 10, make it to 11.  We do the whole hour with Sam.  Oh, Christ.  What a chore that is.  We just get a pat on the back for that.  But God forbid on a Friday we leave 17 minutes early.  I got to take a face full of shit from these guys.  We read the riot act.  I was like, you're kidding, right?  When that was happening to you, I was already on the east side.  Well, I gave it back to him.  Big fucking time. 
[01:02:00]  Big fucking time.  I said, I'm not fucking dealing with this.  Sorry.  If you don't understand why, we could go home early every once in a while.  What is he looking at?  Where did that come from?  That's hilarious.  Iraq sent it to me.  Is that a baseball card?  I don't know where it's from.  I thought I was special.  He sent it to me, too.  No, he texted and then he sent it to me, Troy and Roland, and we all asked him where it  was from and he didn't tell us in his signature vagueness. 
[01:02:30]  So now what?  I tell this guy that yelled at me and gave me a face full of shit.  Every time we go past 10, I make sure he knows.  We did an extra 10 minutes today.  Yeah.  You want to just pat me on the back for that?  Well, you should be talking to your agent and in the new contract, do the half day rule  and the overtime rule that you guys talk about.  Love half day.  Love overtime.  Well, then after I was yelling back at his face, then he tried to spin and goes, no,  I don't care you guys leave earlier once in a while.  I just need to know.  I go, why?  It's a power thing.  Why do you need to know?  We run our own ship. 
[01:03:00]  Daddy thing.  Well, my daddy's dead.  My mom's broken.  Leave me alone.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Do you need a daddy thing?  No.  We make believe we're young.  We're fucking old.  Leave us alone.  I had my daddy.  He's dead, too.  Leave us alone.  For leaving early on a Friday?  Really?  They love when we have to go to them to ask for something.  Permission.  They love it because it just gives them this powerful thing. 
[01:03:30]  It kind of gives them a purpose, a job, you know?  They have to justify their existence here.  And if we ever have to ask for something, well, what would they have done if I wasn't here?  You know?  But these guys aren't here.  No one named Anwar is going to be in my fucking panel talk room.  Goodbye, Anwar.  Oh.  Did this come out well?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Wow. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  There's a member of our management staff, and it's a big picture of him.  I don't know where it came from.  Iraq found it somewhere.  He started sending it around to everybody last night.  Did you find that, Iraq, when you were looking for nude women pictures to pop up on your computer?  On your desktop?  It's Bikini Girls.  Bikini Girls.  Iraq sent a Bikini Girls?  No.  He searches Bikini Girl pictures during the show.  It was exposed when I was trying to find out why he's not listening to the show, that 
[01:04:30]  he sits in there and downloads Bikini Girls.  Can't blame him.  And then Sal totally called him out, because he goes, no, I just did it once to get a picture  for you.  He goes, you did it like 50 of them you were downloading.  He totally nailed it.  We'll leave Iraq alone, though.  Was he in the boy band not in sync?  What are you doing inside?  Sorry.  Poor guy.  There should be another word next to that one.  Was he part of Criss Cross? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  You mean Kaiser's name?  It's from an old radio records.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It does look a little greeny.  I guess...  I guess...  They talked about where K-Rock was broadcasting during the blackout of 2003.  Oh, wow.  Exciting.  I gotta take a leak.  Yeah, we got our food here.  So what did we learn today?  Ant's gonna do a black girl, hopefully.  Well...  We're still working on maybe... 
[01:05:30]  It's a fantasy girl.  Maybe re-signing.  They don't exist.  We are, uh...  Like the Yeti.  Ant's trying to get a few days off.  Bigfoot.  And that's not happening.  The app is getting fixed.  The app's getting fixed.  No, they're working on it.  Right, they're working on it.  Which means nothing to anyone.  And Ant's days have been submitted.  Submitted, even though he submitted them.  But now they're submitted by...  Submitted to your proof.  Somebody that has to justify their job.  Pitiful portrait of...  Yeah, I know.  I want an answer, though. 
[01:06:00]  ASAP.  I said by nine is fair.  ASAP.  We'll let them sleep in like they usually do.  I want an ASAP-ier than nine.  Alright.  Then put a time on it.  I emailed.  Oh, yes.  It was less of a question than more of just Anthony's taking these days off.  Very good.  Yes, yes.  Present it that way.  Yeah.  And you're not gonna get an answer until after the show because they don't like any of this  stuff on the air.  Let's not forget that.  Come on, man.  Because God forbid we bring some of this to the air and make good radio out of it.  If you can't take those days off, I'm willing to sell you some of my days. 
[01:06:30]  How many days off do you have?  That's kind of cool.  I probably still have like way more than you.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I got another.  But we don't take days off.  I've seen you guys taking days off.  I have two days.  I have two days left.  I've probably got about five times that.  I'm taking tomorrow and then all next week off and then I'll have like ten days left.  There's no way.  There is a way.  I checked it.  Show me some of your days.  How much?  Yeah, I mean, I'll give you a hundred dollars a day.  Woo.  No, it's only a thousand dollars. 
[01:07:00]  You give me like.  Oh, really?  Six hundred dollars.  I remember the days when a thousand dollars was a lot to you.  Yeah, Sam.  Jeez.  All right.  I'll take Travis's for a hundred dollars a day.  Yeah, I would definitely sell my days.  I don't want a hundred dollars a day.  I'll take a vacation then.  I will go on vacation with my thousand dollars.  Yeah, but you have to vacation here because you've got no days.  Yeah, that's all right.  I'll go to the Bronx Zoo or something.  I'm doing six hundred dollar days.  New York City is a cool.  It's a vacation in itself.  Yeah, it is.  People come here on vacation.  We live here, so we're on vacation.  Six hundred dollar days.  Have fun with that. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  Maybe Eric will buy them.  You're not going to negotiate with me.  What's wrong with you?  Six hundred dollar days.  You're not going to negotiate with me.  Well, damn.  Well, you know, I got to frame them.  Are they going to sit around the shop for a while?  Two hundred.  Yeah.  That's retail.  That's retail.  Well, you know, I came in with some days and I'm leaving with some money, so I feel pretty  good about it.  It still came out on top.  It still came out on top.  You know, it's not as much as I wanted, but the money in my pocket is going to be more  than the days we're just sitting in the closet. 
[01:08:00]  And I guess I'm just going to be my wife.  We're going to go out to dinner here in Vegas.  Dummies.  Iraq, I need to know how many days in the past year this show wasn't live.  Uh-oh.  Of course not weekends, because that's not part of this.  And not company holidays either.  Yeah.  That shouldn't count.  That shouldn't count.  All right.  Well, put that in a subcategory.  Total, but how many were company holidays?  I would bet not since Christmas.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Except for a Friday or two.  Yeah.  And this guy bitches because I leave early on a Friday.  That'll never happen again, by the way.  I might just leave now.  What are you going to do about it?  I only know of two days off the top of my head, and those were the two days after 4th  of July.  No.  It's got to be more than that.  That's not a company holiday?  See?  Why are they busting our balls?  What is an a company holiday?  Well, were they...  Technically, we took a couple days around the 4th of July.  That wasn't a company holiday.  Well, the Sandy Kane days were not this year, were they? 
[01:09:00]  They were this contract.  Yeah, they were.  They were this year?  I don't know if they were 2012.  But we were working for the company those days.  That's true.  That shouldn't be.  No, we were in a weird way.  Yeah.  We were being sued.  And the show was live.  It was?  Well, the Grimm show was on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but that counts too.  That's new material.  I do like your idea of getting a half a day if the show is...  Half a day if the show is live.  And maybe the person here should get an extra half a day.  Right!  Oh!  I like the way this works. 
[01:09:30]  I want to figure it out so we have days, even if we're not here.  We just do a whole year of shows not being here.  Well, you should work for the other guy.  Oh, boy.  Because that's what he does.  Apparently.  He's got it like that.  Huh?  He's got it like that.  Yeah, good for him in the end.  It's pretty sad that company allowed it.  Well, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You want the Asian haircut bit?  What?  Yeah, we got the Asian haircut bit. 
[01:10:00]  Put that together.  Sal, I hope.  No, Sal did not.  Sam wrote this one.  It got a little weird.  Oh, no.  I think Sam was channeling Steve C at the end of this bit.  It got weird, but I was like...  Oh, boy.  There was no ending, because the audio was just you describing hairstyles in an Asian accent.  And I want to see bits that, in a while, we're going to need some time on this, but after  a while, I want to see the pre-married Sam bits and the post-married Sam bits and see 
[01:10:30]  if there's been any effect.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, it just got a little weird.  It got a little bizarre, is the only thing.  Yeah, right?  There's a twist.  All righty.  Well, we'll go to break with this.  We got good stuff on the way.  What?  What?  How's Z-Rock today?  Are you talking to people today, E-Rock?  I'm here.  Hold on.  I'm here, ain't I?  What's your issue today?  Any issues?  I have no issues.  E-Rock, comment?  Issue?  Comment? 
[01:11:00]  Quit stalling and play the piece.  Oh, shit.  I love this new E-Rock.  The new...  You've had it, huh, E-Rock?  Pretty much done?  Yeah, I'm almost there.  You all right?  Drinking his tea.  Yes.  Don't worry about me.  Do your show.  Oh, God.  Hey.  God forbid.  We worry about it.  We're in management.  Hey, how many days do I have, E-Rock?  You should know.  Be in management like that. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, I want to...  Actually, I got to be...  I got to have E-Rock on my side.  Oh.  My good side.  Because I want him to fucking...  To find out how many days I took off in the last year.  Oh, right.  Because I know that Gary, not even secretly at this point, hates me.  So, of course, he's going to fucking fuck my vacation days.  You didn't go out drinking with him like I did.  When did you go drinking with him?  At Cleveland.  A little Cleveland drinking action in the bar.  Plus, you said horrible things about him on the air. 
[01:12:00]  Who?  That might have hurt, too.  I did?  That might have hurt, too.  Oh, yeah.  Lots of them.  Oh.  Yeah.  That might have done it.  I told him to take care of himself the other day.  I'm going to hurt your chances.  What?  It's not a make good.  What about that?  I had a weird dream.  So, I just said, please take care of yourself.  Cool.  That was nice.  I could be taken as an insult.  No.  I was like, you know...  I told him, like...  I said...  This was an exact quote.  I said, believe it or not, I'm actually a nice guy.  Take care of yourself.  I had a weird dream. 
[01:12:30]  And then I left.  He's like, well...  So, I'm good with him now.  I hope he said some horrible things about me.  But he says he's a nice guy.  So, I guess...  I'm good with him now.  See what I did there?  I don't think he's good with you.  E-Rock, do you think I used all my vacation days?  I don't think you did.  I just don't know how many years.  Not even close, right?  Yeah.  I usually take two weeks in the summer.  I was allowed three days this summer.  Are you...  See, we're not...  We're officially not in summer anymore, Ant.  What?  Everyone else is in summer.  We're in our fall schedule.  What just happened?  But do you have vacation days per year, per contract? 
[01:13:00]  Meaning you could have taken days...  Per year.  Last year.  Per year.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  And I argued.  I said, look, I did pretty much what I usually do.  I might have been sick a few extra days this year.  E-Rock, could you do that for me?  Is it easy?  It'll take a little while, but I'll get it for you.  Nice.  E-Rock's on it.  And fudge the results a little bit.  Oh.  Just a little worse.  E-Rock's on the motherfucker.  Keep it fair, huh?  Keep it fair, Judge.  Don't tell him you're Jewish. 
[01:13:30]  Slip him a couple of bucks.  And do the same for Ant.  And if it doesn't work out in his favor, then make believe you didn't do it for Ant.  Okay?  Yeah.  Just shred the evidence if it doesn't work out in my favor.  Right.  You know what you're doing, right?  Are you right?  Yes, sir.  Only good results.  Right.  Because I want to catch this Gary in a lie after he's double-checking that I only have  two days left.  If you need percentages to bamboozle him, use those.  You know, some of your sick days may not count against you since you had a doctor's  note saying that you weren't allowed to because you were contagious.  Oh! 
[01:14:00]  Shit!  I wanted to come in.  Goddamn E-Rock for the defense.  So why do you beat him up so much?  He just helped you.  Ask yourself the same question.  Oh!  But you haven't taken care of me lately.  What?  Like, it has to be a continuing thing.  He's done so many nice things for you that have been thrown back in his face.  But not lately.  He's like Raymond Burrito.  Okay, see. 
[01:14:30]  Sorry, E-Rock.  What was the last nice thing you did for me, E-Rock?  Just so it's fair and it's on record.  What?  Iron side of beef.  Wasn't he?  No.  That was a detective.  It's still a fat joke.  Who was Raymond Burr played the lawyer?  I'm trying to go with a canon joke, but I don't have it.  Canon!  A Quinn Martin production!  Perry Mason.  That's it.  Perry Mason.  All right.  Perry Mason. 
[01:15:00]  And go.  What was the last nice thing you did?  See?  That's what I mean.  Jesus.  It's got to be continuous.  You don't have a list?  Plus, I mean, I would probably stop doing nice things for you if I were Eric.  I'm sure I gave you something that you gave away.  Perry Mayo.  That's a big company.  Perry Mayo.  It's Perry Mayo.  You and Mayo are just synonymous.  But he loves Mayo.  He loves it.  Loves it.  Until he ate so much he puked until his eyes bled.  Remember when his eyes were bleeding? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Hey, my eyes were bleeding.  Damn it.  That was a scary day.  Yeah.  How many times did we almost kill you?  Jeez.  The cinnamon thing was the most worried I ever was that we killed E-Ruck.  That got scary.  Yeah.  I was laughing pretty hard, but then it got scary.  Yeah.  That got scary.  In the video, you could see Travis jumping up and down laughing.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  Yeah.  As everybody else is going, uh-oh.  But then it got scary.  Yeah.  Turning purple's not fun.  No.  Hmm.  Uh, Fatlock. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  Oh, because he's a lawyer.  Soundboard fast.  Was he a lawyer?  Was Matlock?  Matlock.  Sure.  Yeah, he was in the courtroom, wasn't he?  You can never tell, because they're all running around with guns.  No.  Fucking getting themselves in trouble when they shouldn't.  Cannon is a goddamn insurance investigator.  He's an investigator for an insurance company.  Someone files a claim, and then Cannon has to go and see if it.  And meanwhile, every fucking show, he's running around and...  Cannon!  Listen how they yell his name. 
[01:16:30]  Cannon!  This is the theme.  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.  And here it comes.  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.  No.  Cannon.  Cannon.  Cannon.  Starring William Conrad  William Conrad  This fat fuck is running around  For some reason  Always outside in the mountains too  He's running up like a mountain  This fat fuck  Shooting a snub-nosed .38  On the run 
[01:17:00]  At people that are fucking yards away  Is that possible?  And he's hitting them  No!  Oh, it's not possible  It's impossible to hit anything  But he hits them  And the bad guys like  Miss them all the time  Great show  I love canon  I watch it every day now  On that stupid Me TV  Love Me TV  Iraq, why wasn't I invited  To the family party?  I was hurt by that  Because I thought you said  I was invited  I didn't invite you  Oh boy  But I was invited  Did you get the official invite?  I think my wife  Invited your family  And then you said 
[01:17:30]  Oh man  You would not be back in time  Oh, okay  I didn't get invited  No, you're not close enough  To Iraq like I am  You've done the worst things  I've done family things  With Iraq  I've been invited  To family things  You have not  Glutton for punishment  I get invited  To the friends parties  And the family parties  But this time  I wasn't invited  To the family party  He must really  Have a thing for you  Yeah, we get along  Outside this place  Yeah?  We're nice to each other  Right, Iraq?  Yeah, you go to concerts 
[01:18:00]  Together  Let's go with that  Imagine if we treated  Iraq like we do  On the air  Like off the air  Oh my god  Like if he's just  Hanging out with you  You're just bashing him  All the time  Iraq, you know that  Look, let's break down  A fucking wall today  You know that doesn't happen  That would be hilarious  You know that doesn't happen  Whatever helps you sleep  Oh!  Because let's keep in mind  Fuck you  Half the Iraq stories  Have been  Guess what I did to Iraq  Over the weekend  Did I say  I gave away the gift  He gave me  I left him at the concert  Did I say one word  About his 
[01:18:30]  About his housewarming party  Oh boy  No  Well, I'm sure  I could have made  Something up  No, you said nice things  Thank you  That's outside the show  That was once  So I'm good with Iraq now  Once  One time  So I'm officially  Good with Iraq  No  I mean  I didn't bash his party  It was a nice party  But you could always  Find something to goof on  Like if  And I chose not to  Goof on anything  Like if  Me and the Iraq are good  If he was getting  In the elevator with me  I wouldn't say like  Oh, what's the capacity  On this  Right  You know  But you would think it  I might think it 
[01:19:00]  But I wouldn't say it  But you would say it  If like me and Travis  Were in there with you  Oh, hell yeah  Because it's kind of  A showy thing  Yeah  You know  Back to a showy thing  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It doesn't have to be  On the air  To be a showy  Kind of thing  Right  Yeah  Iraq, do we take our shits  At the same time  In the morning?  Oh, no  What time do you shit  In the morning here?  I have  I've been doing my best  Not to do that here  Oh, because someone  That I feel like  Is you in a stall  No, no  I'm like, this is weird  Me and Iraq are shitting  At the same time 
[01:19:30]  Didn't you throw Iraq's  Chicken wings in the garbage?  Yeah  And then told him  Well  He didn't tell  Yeah, he didn't tell me that  He told me two days later  I don't know if I did  You left him at Giants Stadium  You made him find his way home  From Giants Stadium  Off the air  That was funny at the time  I'm not saying it wasn't funny  The chicken wing thing  To this day  My wife is not happy about that  It's a rude thing to do  I didn't want to make him feel bad  He got you a Giant Islanders thing  And then you gave it to your brother 
[01:20:00]  And announced that on the air  There was a Super Bowl party  And Iraq brought over  All these wings  And no one was eating them  Because we had a lot of food  I think  It wasn't like the wings were bad  What?  You had nothing  You had beer  That's not true  Then why didn't people  Eat the wings?  Yeah, plenty of food  I remember  Because you threw them out  Probably  Or because it was a goof  The whole kitchen  Was set up to kill mice  You had no food there  There was no fucking  Mouse holocaust  Going on  In Ovi's apartment  He's not lying  So people weren't eating the wings  Which would mean  They were either bad 
[01:20:30]  Or we had too much food  Or everybody was goofing on Iraq  Nobody eat the food Iraq brings  So then me and my wife  She wasn't my wife at the time  We were in the kitchen  And we're whispering  And I go  Look, why don't we just  Throw a few away  Make it look like  People ate his wings  And that was a nice thing  It wasn't a nice thing  What made it not a nice thing?  You told him on the air  That you threw him out  And humiliated him  You've never been nice to him  On or off the air  I've been nice to him  Off the air  You've been secretly mean  To him off the air  And then brought it up 
[01:21:00]  On the air  Iraq, have I been nice  To you off the air?  There have been times, yes  There have been times  Say, there have been times  You're like an abusive husband  That says, well, I don't  Hit you every day  What about when I got you  Those flowers?  What about the nice dinner  We went to?  Which one?  No, I'm saying  I've taken Iraq  To a lot of nice dinners  But then you bring him home  And beat the shit out of him  For not cleaning the kitchen  It's not a good relationship  We went to quality  Where did we go?  Quality meets recently?  Oh boy 
[01:21:30]  Did I bring that up on the air?  I'm sure I could have goofed on something  Yeah, but the last time  You did because you said  You saw  Philip Seymour Hoffman  At the bar  And we had a good time  Listen, the last time  Alright, yeah  We didn't bring up any weird shit  Or try to goof on something  No  The last time you brought  Iraq to dinner  You brought him back  To your apartment  And then you threw him  Under the bus  On the air  For putting his hand  On your sister's leg  That was the last time  You took Iraq to dinner  And you made an hour bit  Out of the fact  That he had his hand  On your sister's leg  That's correct  For 20 minutes 
[01:22:00]  There's no fucking way  That you're going to be like  Oh no, we're cool  Why are you throwing me  You're throwing me under the bus  Because you said  He should invite you  To his family functions  Instead of me  Well, I was very surprised  I wasn't invited  So was I  His family loves my kid  You can't skate  Because you have a kid  And then you can do  Shitty things  They love my kid  Everybody loves your kid  He's a two year old  Who like laughs  He's fun  Yeah, he's fun  So your Japanese bit  You alright today?

[01:33:00]  I knew of this guy  And then  Fast forward to yesterday  And I found out  He's had this long  Law enforcement career  Like fucking  You know  He's done so much shit  In law enforcement  Over the years  And I'm just like  You know  I didn't know  Wow  And occasionally over the years  I've thought of  Being um  Being at that job  And seeing him hanging out  And you know  We left our balls  That guy  That's the guy  Come on  That's the guy  Come on 
[01:33:30]  Dude  I used to work with that guy  He looks like he would  Fuck you up  I used to work with that guy  He was hilarious too  He was fucking like  He was one of the funniest  Motherfuckers  At the place  We went um  He looks like the  Stereotypical cop  You would put in a comedy  I know  Right  But he uh  He was fucking crazy  One time  We didn't want to go to work  So we just went up on the roof  And shut the air conditioning off  Right  And then the cops showed up  And we had a hide  In a fucking  Across the street  Jericho Turnpike  Wait at the Chicago Pizza Pub? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah yeah  Where the cops were walking around  And they were walking  Like right in front of us  And we heard them  Why would you hide?  I didn't want to get arrested  For what?  We were up on the roof  Oh as you're on the roof  Of Chicago Pizza Pub  Somebody called?  Yeah someone called the cops  Oh I gotcha  So we jumped down  And uh  And ran into the bushes  And uh  Wait you were trying to get off work  By turning off the AC?  Hey look  I didn't say it was a great plan  That's pretty funny  But we heard the cops saying like  I know they're probably  Fucking looking at us right now  Like oh my god 
[01:34:30]  We're right here  He's right  But he was one of the guys  That was one of the guys  Oops  Hanging out  Well he learned something that day  Yeah  He's like fuck being in the bushes  I want to be that guy  I want to be the other guy  I want to be the other guy  That's kind of cool  Yeah I was like  I know this motherfucker  He looks familiar  And there he was  We should try to find out  Check people from like  Our past lives  Yeah that was weird  Just popped up  I dropped him an email  I was just like  Hey John  How you doing?  Probably like  Leave me alone  Don't ever say that

[01:35:30]  I recently got a  An email from the girl  That her father said  Fine feathered friend  Right  That one yeah  She's like married  And living in Pennsylvania  Got grown fucking kids  Is she on Facebook?  Yeah but she doesn't have much  On Facebook  But she's on Facebook  Have you seen her picture?  No  No pictures whatsoever  On Facebook?  None  Ooh that's a bad sign  That's a bad sign  And I think after  After we went out  I saw her maybe 
[01:36:00]  Ten years later  And already there was a problem  Yeah  And she was with a guy  Who I think turned out to be  Eventually her husband  Looked exactly like her father  Oh really?  Oh yeah  Exactly like the fine feathered  Friend father  Yeah I thought that was  A little odd  I want to see her picture  You sure there's nothing  On Facebook?  Not a thing  We won't give her name out  No I've looked  I couldn't find anything  I have a picture at home  Of her  I should post it on fucking  On Twitter  What the fuck 
[01:36:30]  Of her when we were  Hanging out back in probably  1980 or something like that  Child of the 80's Sam  I told ya  When I was  There you go  Proof  When I was in my teens  Child of the 80's  He's got a picture with a girl  From the 80's  He was hanging out with somebody  In the 80's  Nope  I was a teen  In the 80's  So was I  You were a teen in the 80's  Is that what you said?  I was a teen in the 80's  For how many of them?  A few  Enough to make it official  That I'm a child of the 80's  I debate that part

[01:40:00]  It's going to be a lonely show  Alright here's the canoodling video  That a lot of people will be checking out today  Anchorman canoodling news blooper  So you got this story in Canada  What's the story about?  Some old lady's talking about how she's seen people canoodle in her neighborhood  Yeah it's just like some place where people used to hang out  What is the actual definition of canoodling?  Is that like finger popping?  It's heavy petting  No  So that's finger popping right?  Canoodling  People that are canoodling are seen in like a club 
[01:40:30]  Like a booth in a club  And they're secretly kind of nuzzling  Snuggling, kissing  Hands are groping a little bit  I'll say a sexual cuddle  No cocks out though  What about  So no digits going into dark places?  Nah  Can you be heavy petting?  Heavy petting  Heavy petting?  Heavy petting  Isn't petting and heavy petting the same thing?  I would think  There's light petting  What's light petting and what's heavy petting?  Heavy petting  What an Ann Landers thing to say 
[01:41:00]  If your children are getting involved in heavy petting at this point  You need to have a talk with them  Do you know who Ann Landers is?  I know the name  That's child of the 80's stuff  Oh Jesus  It's adult in the 80's  Because the memory is fully developed  That's child of the 80's  I think light petting is like  You know  Brushing your hand against the back  Heavy petting is  Once you get to the breasts  And vagina  Oh man  You can't heavy pet  On a vagina  Over the pants  Over the pants  Vagina is heavy petting?  I don't know about that  Is it? 
[01:41:30]  That's heavy  This is heavy  You do this move  Jesus  Scrunching it between your  Thumb and forefinger  Scrunching your scrotum  Yeah  What a great itch that is  That is terrific  Can we take time out  To itch our scrotum Sam?  Absolutely  If they're itchy  Go ahead and scratch them  It doesn't itch right now  No  Yeah but it still feels good  Not really  Unless you have it  Oh yeah it does  Oh yeah  That feels really good  Just roll it around a little  Just roll that around  In your mouth  So we got this lady 
[01:42:00]  She's talking about  Canoodling in her neighborhood  And I don't know  I guess the anchor  Didn't really understand  The actual definition  Of canoodling  No he gets a little confused  What does he think  Canoodling is?  I guess he says  He says it  Okay so we don't need  More of a set up  No we're done  Here we go  Fought  And then a lot of them  Brought their girlfriends out  To canoodle or whatever  Did people canoodle  In Union Bay?

No one has ever  Done any of those things  No  The donkey punch  The fucking  One eyed pirate  The fucking  I could see maybe  The rusty trombone  Cleveland steamer  I could see the rusty  Trombone as a goof 
[01:45:30]  Yeah  Yeah why not  Cause girls  Maybe with gay guys  Cause girls doing it  They don't have a sense  Of humor like that  They don't  No to fucking  Shove their face  In a guy's ass  And you can't do it  To a chick  Right  You could probably  Play the  Maybe the rusty  Bagpipes  With a girl  You just fucking  You're tooting her ass  And then you work  Her pussy like  Fucking  You're fingering  The bagpipes  I don't know  Wait a minute  Would that work?  Yeah  I guess you're  Up to something 
[01:46:00]  The rusty fruit  No one has done  The dirty Sanchez  Stop already  No  No  Imagine doing that  To a girl  And she's just like  Ah the dirty Sanchez  Oh my god  You roll  You wipe shit  Under my nose  Maybe cause the holes  Are so close to each other  It'd be like  The rusty harmonica  But you're not  Diddling your fingers  On a harmonica  But you're pushing them in  You could be  I don't know  Maybe a piccolo  The rusty piccolo  The rusty piccolo  Well that's too close  I don't know  But you gotta  Toot in her ass  Right  And then reach around 
[01:46:30]  And diddle a little  Like you're working  So it's gotta be  A wind instrument  But you have to  Manipulate your fingers  On the instrument  But it's gotta be small  And it can't be a slide  Like a trombone  Cause that's cock  Hmm  I don't know  I don't know  Someone will figure it out  Yeah we'll  We'll get an answer to that  Someone will figure it out  The beauty of the show  Rusty clarinets  We got an Alabama man  On the phone  Alabama man  Matt  Hey guys  What's up Matt  Hey um  I was just giggling

[01:52:30]  Tootin' it.  All right.  Hey, why don't we continue with the news thing?  We got a...  Did you hear this overly dramatic reporter yet?  This went viral like two days ago.  We didn't get to it.  I did not.  Oh, God.  Do you have this video, Sam?  Maybe we just go with the video.  It's an old guy.  He's on the street, and he's reporting, and he has to just fucking go over the top.  Does he?  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  I'm not sure of the video.  Oh, you're not sure.  Maybe Daniel said it.  I don't know.  Well, Mr. Spicoli. 
[01:53:00]  I'll know it if I see it.  Old guy.  Remember what the report was about?  Yeah.  Like an incident.  No.  There was an incident that was happening.  Some kind of incident.  Yeah, look up incident.  Incident.  An incident.  That's so vague.  Just put incident in Google.  I did it on purpose.  I know.  It's hilarious.  Okay, good.  Just put incident. 
[01:53:30]  Put in report.  There it is.  He found it by putting an incident.  No way.  That's him.  Look at this guy.  What is he?  He's got like a drudge hat on.  Where is he from?  I have no idea.  Doucheville.  All right, let's play this.  Imagine you're standing in your house.  A long...  Do we have another version of it?  Because it's in one ear.  One rear.  And that drives people nuts.  Crazy.  It's on LiveLeak.  Go to LiveLeak.  This is from LiveLeak.  Oh, it is from LiveLeak.  It's the same thing.  Port it on over. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, that's all they did.  Yeah, the audio you have might...  Oh, you want to match it up?  Let's try that, Sam.  Let's do it.  Let's rock.  Imagine.  Oh, good.  Okay, we can do this.  Imagine all the people living our world in...  Wait, I want to see if me and Sam can sync up.  All right.  You ready to do this, right?  Yep.  All right, what are we going to do?  Three, two, one?  And then are we going to do it on one or right after one?  I don't know.  Ant, how does this work?  You always go, you go, three, two, one, go.  Yeah, yeah.  You get the rhythm.  All right, so Ant does go.  And when you hear go, you hit your button. 
[01:54:30]  I'll hit my button.  We'll see if we sync up.  Great.  All right.  Three, two, one.  You didn't say go.  Sam, you fell for it.  No, because you said...  Why would you fall for that?  Because you said we were going to do it on the rhythm.  I said I'd go.  But on the rhythm is what Ant said.  All right.  So I didn't know if maybe he got confused.  Get it right.  You're right.  No.  Just follow instructions.  All right.  Everyone knew it was go.  He said the rhythm.  The rhythm.  All right.  Ready?  Three, two, go.  Imagine.  Why can't you follow instructions? 
[01:55:00]  Because I said I'm go.  Yeah, but you said after one comes go, and he didn't say one.  Come on.  This is Bush League.  Jesus Christ.  You're saying how old are we, and I'm thinking, how many more combinations can we do?  All right.  All right.  Yes.  Let's do this.  Go.  Imagine.  No.  Are we going on go, or three, two, one, go?  After three, two, one, go is when we go.  We already did that.  Fair enough.  I was still going with the go thing.  I'm up.  I'm up, by the way. 
[01:55:30]  You made two mistakes.  I made one.  It's always got to be a contest.  Okay.  Really?  Three, two, one, go.  Imagine.  You're standing in front of your house.  You're behind.  The video might be longer.  Nope.  You have to go.  Then you adjust accordingly.  I'm going to.  So what are you going to do?  Yeah.  A little forward.  Were you behind, or was a little behind?  Why don't you hit it on one?  Should I try here?  I go three, two, one, go.  That's a great idea.  That's a great idea.  You hit on one. 
[01:56:00]  You hit on go.  I go?  Yeah.  You hit on go.  He hits on one.  I bet that works.  All right.  Let's try this.  Three, two, one, go.  Imagine.  Yes.  You're standing in front of your house.  Along comes a runaway bus.  There you are.  I don't like it.  I think it's up.  You're a little.  Yeah.  You think so?  You're a little too soon.  I think we can do better.  So three, two, one.  Not on one.  You got to do what?  Like you got to wait.  I got an N maybe.  Just a second.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Split.  And I'm still on go.  And you're still on go.  I think I did go well.  You did.  All right.  Good.  Three, two, one, go.  Imagine.  You're standing in front of your house.  It doesn't work.  It does work.  I think you fucked up.  No, I'm saying that combination didn't work.  Wait, no.  He has to do.  Maybe right before one?  Just after one.  Just after?  I think so.  That was what I did that time.  He came in late.  You were the echo.  I wasn't the echo.  Your audio was the echo.  So his was coming up first.  No. 
[01:57:00]  So you got to slow down a little more.  A little bit.  All right, then.  What?  What?  Yeah, it has to start later.  If mine came first, it has to start later.  Yes, yes.  Aren't you coming in late?  Ant's saying that he's here in mine first.  Who's coming in late?  I think.  I think.  Let's try it again.  Okay.  I have no idea.  Just do it on the one again.  Okay, but you're on go.  I'm going to do it like midway through the one.  I think my go is pretty good.  I don't think I'm the issue here.  I think we have to work on when Sam pops in.  Ready?  Three, two, one, go. 
[01:57:30]  Imagine you're standing in front of your house.  He's first.  No, he's not.  He's first.  No, I'm the two channels.  His sound is coming in first.  Just for the people out there.  I'm two channels and it's one channel.  So who's first?  I think I'm first.  No, he's saying imagine first.  Sam's is imagine first.  Then you're the echo on it.  All right.  So Sam, a little later.  You got to be later.  Slightly later.  That's what I'm saying.  Just after one.  So wait after one. 
[01:58:00]  I go one and then hit it.  One.  Has to be as soon as you finish the word.  Yes.  Let's try that.  Okay.  I think I'm still good with my go.  I think you're okay with that.  Yeah.  Three, two, one, go.  Imagine you're standing in front of your house.  Why is it the exact same time?  Would you fucking go?  What are you doing, Sam?  Why?  Maybe you have to alter the pause.  Maybe you're waiting a little differently amount of time between one and go.  All right.  It's my fault, I guess.  Good managerial skills you're showing there. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  I got it now.  You're right.  You're right.  Watch this.  Am I good with go?  Yeah.  You're good with go.  And I'm right after one.  After one.  Okay.  Three, two, one, go.  Imagine you're standing in front of...  You hit it.  You hit it before I said go.  I had it timed right.  But he's coming in early.  You hit it before I said go.  Fuck.  All right.  All right.  I think I got this.  I think so, too.  Three, two, one, go. 
[01:59:00]  Imagine you're standing in front of your house.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Now you're one of the way.  What?  Now yours is...  But we're pretty good.  Yours is first there.  We're almost there.  We're almost there.  You know, if you turned the audio off the computer and just watched the video and played  the audio from the CD deck...  I know.  That's not going to waste ten minutes.  All right.  That's a good point, too.  That's a good counterpoint.  We're going to hit this perfect.  Yeah.  Let's just try one more.  Okay.  Here we go.  Okay.  And we figured out the formula. 
[01:59:30]  It's one, play, go, play, right.  But it was just slightly off, so now what?  Just slightly.  Who has to wait a little longer?  You just got to hit it when I say go.  Don't try to anticipate it.  I won't.  And I'm immediately after you say one.  You are right after one.  I'm even going to close my eyes, so I don't anticipate.  All right.  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  Three, two, one, go.  Imagine you're standing in front of your house.  Yes!  Along comes a runaway bus.  There you are, helpless, as that bus into your home. 
[02:00:00]  I said, this guy's not going to stop, so I went back to the car.  Boom!  Right in front of me.  All of a sudden, without warning, a big, out-of-control Montgomery County ride-on bus  goes barreling into the Olamide home on Avena Road with such force, well, with such force,  all that's left in the living room, a lamp and a TV.  Now, when this happened, Femi Olamide was in this Toyota car here. 
[02:00:30]  He saw the bus cut right in front of him, over the lawn, into the driveway, into his cab,  and then into his house.  He saw the whole thing.  I saw it.  Scary.  Very, very.  I'm lucky.  Everyone.  Yes, I'm very, very lucky.  Two of Mr. Olamide's sons were inside the house when it happened, uninjured, but, boy,  would they rattle.  I thought it was an earthquake at first, so when I seen the bus, I was completely, like, 
[02:01:00]  astounded.  I didn't think something like this could happen.  When you saw the bus in your house...  I just thought, how in the world could this have happened?  Why is there a bus in my living room?  This happened around 11 this morning.  Bus 5352, en route to Silver Spring.  A runaway.  Nine passengers on board.  Some treated at the scene, some taken to the hospital.  Their injuries said to be minor.  Not so minor, the damage to the Olamide home, stripped of its front, condemned by the building 
[02:01:30]  inspector, and his cab, his cab, yet another casualty of this bizarre accident.  It's beyond my imagination right now.  I'm shocked.  So what happened here?  Was it brake failure?  Was it speed?  Or something else?  The investigation, it's underway.  Anyway, in Montgomery County, Pat Collins, News 4.  Something tells me that's his bit, right?  That's his gimmick? 
[02:02:00]  I bet if you'd looked up Pat Collins' stories, there'd be a fuckload like that.  Where he's just over the top.  Over the top guy.  Oh, he loves a little trucket, because he's got the reporter hat on, and a tie that looks  like a railroad crossing.  Is this him?  Yeah, there's a lot of Pat Collins.  But people are being funny on Twitter.  I've got to go with Gumby1144, writes, imagine we actually hear this video.  Look, we had to get it right. 
[02:02:30]  I don't think there's one person alive that hasn't had a thing that they tried to get  right, perfect, and they didn't do it 800 times.  And then Echo5Bravo writes, are you aware you're on the air?  It's not practice time.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Come on.  He's got a few, right?  Yeah, he's got a bunch.  Yeah.  So that's his thing?  That's like his gimmick.  Oh, yeah.  He's a dramatic guy.  Fucking news guy.  Yeah.  Enough of him. 
[02:03:00]  Did we get any info on Anthony's days off?  Yeah.  What about my intel?  I'm still compiling.  Oh, for that.  That we haven't heard yet, but I'm still compiling what he did for the last year.  Still collating?  Remember, if it doesn't work out in our favor, you didn't do this assignment for us.  All right, good.  Come on, man.  I need an answer.  How could there not be an answer already?  How could there not be an answer five minutes after I asked? 
[02:03:30]  They certainly seem to know everything.  Let's see.  Are they down the hole?  Is there an answer?  No.  Where were we with Dan's days off?  Well, Ant wanted three days off.  And I laughed openly, because I know how this place works.  I don't know how that's going to end.  They were submitted.  There's going to be a denied and big red lettering.  Big block lettering.  Oh, God.  But right now, there is no answer.  Why is there no answer?  No answer yet.  Why?  They either know or don't know.  Answer.  Well, they say that Rob may or may not have the authority to make that decision in general. 
[02:04:00]  Wait, who said that?  May or may not.  See, more of that vagary.  Vagary.  Who said that?  What Travis is saying.  Wait, how does he not know that he has the authority or not?  No, no, no.  Travis is saying he doesn't know if Rob has that authority.  Oh.  Meaning.  That's fair enough.  We might have to wait until Gary returns from his illness.  What's his illness?  And is he getting docked days?  He was not feeling well.  If you're the guy that's in charge of docking days, guess what?  He's not going to dock his own days.  I'm docking him.  On Tuesday, he left before our meeting because he wasn't feeling well. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, shit.  And then he wasn't here yesterday.  That was the day I did tell him to take care of himself.  Mm-hmm.  Because I had a weird dream.  Well, Opie said.  And then he's out the next day?  And then he went home.  No, he left that day, that afternoon.  Damn, yo.  What is that about?  Oh, gosh.  What is that called?  Like I'm a dream catcher or something?  That's not what that's called.  Premonition.  Dream weaver?  What am I?  Dream weaver?  That's not what that's called either.  What is it?  Dream what?  Dream weaver.  You'd be a big girl on a horse.  Right.  But how is it that I, and I have a witness.  I said, Gary, you all right? 
[02:05:00]  I had a weird dream about you.  I hope you're taking care of yourself.  And now I know I'm good with Gary because I showed concern.  But then that day he went home?  Steve.  I think that that makes you a seer.  But he went home that day?  Yeah, he didn't even make it to our meeting.  He went right home.  Don't you think that's strange?  No.  No.  You don't.  Coincidence?  Yeah.  Damn it.  Fucking coincidence.  Damn it.  I thought I had a special thing.  Sorry, bro.  I've been having fucking just kind of weird dreams that I only remember pieces of. 
[02:05:30]  It's just so fucking odd and like sexual dreams.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I can't remember them very well.  Not the rapety rape rape ones.  Do you get your girls pregnant when you rape them in your dreams?  Who gives a shit?  Well, the...  They're gone after the rape.  Are they legitimate rapes?  Legitimate dreamy rapes.  Well, that's what I should say.  And in my dream, girls have something that they can't get pregnant during a legitimate  rape.  Oh.  But it's in my dream.  I don't know how it works in reality.  But in my dream, that really happens. 
[02:06:00]  I've heard they don't.  Really?  Yeah, I've heard there's a thing in their bodies.  Yeah, doctors.  What happens?  It's like fucking...  I picture it like when they close down the fucking mountain at NORAD.  Like when there's a rape going on, the big fucking door shuts.  Yeah.  All these big shutters come down.  And the eggs are just sitting there going, oh, there's like a safe room for the eggs.  I thought it was like in Desmond's Hatch, the doors just close.  The hatch just...  Damn, right.  Exactly.  Desmond's Hatch.  Wouldn't that be a panic room?  Yeah.  For the eggs?  A panic room for your fucking ovaries, for your eggs. 
[02:06:30]  You'd think the hatch would just come down over the vagina so there couldn't be any rape  at all.  No, there's got to be a rape.  There has to be one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's got to be one.  I think the fallopian tubes are like the get smart beginning, where the doors are just  closing.  They just shut and keep closing.  Keep that spermatozoa out.  I'm going to try to have sex in my dreams.  I have too much guilt.  I don't have the sex in my dreams.  I don't know why.  Sometimes it happens where you don't.  It's like real life.  Sometimes you get it. 
[02:07:00]  Sometimes you don't.  It's like a free pass.  So why wouldn't you have sex in your dreams?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Other people feel this way?  Like, I get to see some cool shit, but then when it comes down to actually having sex in  my dreams, I don't have the sex in my dreams.  What's that about?  Guilt?  I don't know if it's guilt.  It's got to be something, but I don't know if guilt's the answer.  Do you turn down sex in your dreams?  No, not really.  Girl, that's not fun.  Girl, just tell me she's not having sex in a dream.  Or what'll happen is getting raped. 
[02:07:30]  In a dream, in a dream.  In a dream.  Stop it, Sam.  Of course, people know that, right?  Foot in a dream.  Foot in a dream.  There's always a reason why it doesn't happen in my dreams.  Yeah?  Put them naked and there's some good shit going on.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's weird.  Maybe it is a guilt thing.  Hmm.  Whoa, dream raper.  I believe.  I was thinking.  Stick my dick inside.  Whether she wants it or not.  Whether she wants it or not. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Just fucking pounding.  Clothes come off immediately.  It really is amazing how easily I can tear fucking clothes off in a dream.  Especially when you know you're dreaming.  Oh, I'm dreaming.  I'm raping.  And I just tear the clothes off.  And they fly off like a lion is mauling her.  And then you rape and fly away.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to fly away now.  Then I fly away.  I'm able to fly in my dreams.  I like doing that, too.  And rape.  Yes. 
[02:08:30]  Flying and raping are my two favorite things.  And not even in that order, by the way.  Like a good rape fly.  Do you ever rape while you're in midair?  No, but...  Oh, God.  That would be perfect.  Imagine a flying rape dream.  Go take a flying rape.  That would be cool.  This is like when everybody talks about what superpower you want.  Yes.  Flying rape man.  Dreamwave.  That's horrible that you do that.  Oh, yeah.  I do. 
[02:09:00]  That's right.  I fly from rape to rape.  Why is it horrible?  It's a dream.  Because he knows he's dreaming, so he's cognizant on some level.  That part of it is twisted.  I know I'm dreaming.  Yeah.  And all I want to do is rape.  Right.  Once you get cognizant of what you're doing, it becomes disgusting.  I read somebody's tweet the other day, though, and this made a lot of sense.  It said, if you could do anything and get away with it, not be arrested, not have guilt,  not like guilt, just do anything, and with no consequence, what would you do? 
[02:09:30]  And the answer is how big a scumbag you are.  So, like, if you're a rapey guy, then the only thing stopping you from raping is the laws.  That's how I analyzed your dream.  That it means that if you were, if it were not illegal, you would rape, because it would  be consequence-free, without any sort of thought of, oh, this would destroy this girl.  All right, Mr. Purity, what's your fucking thing that you would do, then?  If there were no consequences? 
[02:10:00]  No consequences.  At all.  I would rob.  I would definitely steal.  Rob?  You'd steal?  I would steal.  You could do that without, with consequences.  What are you talking about?  We're in a lower tax bracket.  Yeah.  I mean, what are you talking, like, armed robbery, or fucking, like, super criminal safe  cracker?  If it were legal, I would arm, arm, I would, yeah, do some armed robbery.  Bank?  I would, yeah, like in a town?  Yeah, bitch.  I'd put on, like, one of those skull masks with dreadlocks and just fucking be like, 
[02:10:30]  would you beat everyone on the floor, motherfucker, kind of robber?  Oh, yeah, and I would definitely hit somebody with a gun.  Oh!  Not shoot somebody.  I wouldn't shoot anybody.  Bridge of the nose with the gun.  Yeah.  Bam.  Or just right in the jaw.  I told you to shut the fuck up down there.  Yeah, but now, now you want assault and robbery to both be illegal.  Yeah.  You only have one.  Can I assault and rob?  No, you can have both.  You can have both?  Thank you.  Yeah, that shows what a scumbag he is.  And they lump that shit together.  I'd probably rob and then just rape someone without robbing.  You just want nothing to be illegal.  Ah, nothing.  I would, go ahead.  I would, uh, I would kill everyone that did me wrong in my life. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's horrible.  That's a long fucking time.  I wouldn't kill anyone.  Oh, I would so kill people if I could get away with it.  All right, then I would bring you guys.  I would so do that.  I would bring you guys on my robbery, and then I would be stealing stuff, and then if  anybody got out of line, Opie would kill them and Ant would rape them.  Oh, right.  Wow, what a team.  Yeah, it'd be great.  Can I kill them first?  Before Ant, do you mind raping a corpse?  Makes it weird for Anthony?  No, I can't rape a corpse.  So you gotta rape them first and then I kill them?  I fucking... 
[02:11:30]  And technically, they can't say no if they're dead, so that's not rape.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what it is?  And let me tell you something else.  It's not so much rape.  I'll be honest with you.  Sure.  Because it's never a big fight.  There's never like a big...  She's not putting up a brawl.  Like, like...  But...  Like, she probably would have had sex with me if I would have just used a little...  Gave it another hour or two?  Yeah, yeah.  Sit down, have some drinks, whatever it is.  Work it a little longer.  Work it a little.  But I don't have that kind of time in a dream.  Because you don't know when the dream's gonna end. 
[02:12:00]  Right, the dream could end while I'm fucking still at dinner with her?  Fuck that!  So I'm like, right to the fucking.  So I gotta rip her clothes off and start fucking her.  Rape her.  Now...  Alright.  I'm amazed you can...  Or date rape.  I'm amazed you can control your dreams.  I'm amazed by that.  But it's limited.  I can't wake up.  I think most people are aware that the panic sets in.  And there's an awareness that you're in the middle of a really cool fucking dream.  Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up.  And then you feel the panic going, holy fuck. 
[02:12:30]  This could either...  I could either wake up, like you said.  Or next thing you know, it's like the next scene, which has nothing to do with what you were just doing.  You could have a great adventure, though.  And I felt that panic.  It's like going on a fucking recall.  But how do you not panic in that situation?  Just go, oh, alright.  Sometimes I do.  I start getting so scared that I'm gonna wake up.  Right.  And I don't want to.  It's the worst feeling.  Because you know you're in a great spot.  You gotta stay calm and get your rape in before you wake up.  But how do you stay calm?  But then if you wake up, do you try to get back into the dream? 
[02:13:00]  And you're like, alright, let's just get back to the dream.  The raping doesn't happen.  I was raping.  It doesn't happen.  Do you have nocturnal emissions when you rape in your dreams?  No.  I wish I did.  It'd be nice, right?  Yeah.  Because any emission is good.  I get to wet dreams every once in a while.  You do?  Nice.  I do, too.  Any emission.  Wet dreams are pretty fucking solid, man.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Nothing was better than that.  They should bottle that shit.  It's just such a great dream.  What is that?  What is that?  Does that mean you're rubbing your hard penis on your mattress?  I wonder if that happens.  Or you just cum.  I don't know.  How does your mind have you cum with any actual stimulation on your dick? 
[02:13:30]  It's amazing.  Maybe that's what I would do.  Instead of having the ability...  Or you're so turned on, just moving in the sheets.  That's it.  Instead of having the ability to rob people, I would like to be able to will myself to cum.  Wow.  You just want to be Bobo?  That would be great power.  Oh, yeah.  Bobo does it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  So if you could do anything, you would just be Bobo.  Here comes Dupree.  He's got a pretty easy life.  What ever happened to Bobo?  Well, you guys...  I don't know.  He just doesn't want to be on the show anymore.  Why does he want to be on the show?  I don't know.  We've been good to him over the years.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We had a conversation the other day on the air. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  About him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  He got his Twitter and stuff back.  Yeah, he got all this shit back.  What happened?  Well, somebody hacked his Twitter and was putting horrible racist stuff on there.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't these people understand what we do?  They're stupid.  Yeah.  He got it back.  It was really over the top.  Why don't they understand what we do?  Hunky dory.  They're mean people.  There's a fine line.  They are mean people.  Yeah.  All right.  That said, I would also mug people.  Because that counts as...  You like mugging?  Yeah.  Mugging is such an old school thing to do. 
[02:14:30]  You're so black.  But it wouldn't be like...  Now it's just like robbery and assault.  It wouldn't be like risky mugging.  Like the interns and stuff.  Like I would wait until they left the building and I'd pull a gun on them and say, give me  all your money.  Wow.  But you wouldn't kill them?  No, I wouldn't want to kill them.  I just want to get their money.  I wouldn't want to ruin their lives and end their lives and affect their families.  I wouldn't want to do that.  Guns, by the way, terrible in dreams.  In my dreams.  They're fucking useless.  Are they really heavy?  They're fucking heavy.  Here's what happens.  Here's what happens to every gun I have in a dream when I need one and I'm being fucking robbed 
[02:15:00]  or people are surrounding the house or whatever the fuck happens in my sick dreams.  And I go to pull the trigger and I got to pull back so hard on the trigger and it's  still just reaching the point before it'll fire.  Oh my God.  And now I can't aim because I'm straining so much just to fire it.  That's your fear.  It's terrible.  Because you've set up this whole system of you're safe in life because you have your  firearms.  And what happens?  What happens when the firearms fail?  Yep.  And then there's another one.  What trigger aren't you pulling in real life?  Oh man.  Right?  Exactly.  Dr. Travis. 
[02:15:30]  Okay.  And then the other one is I open up the gun or I have a magazine or a fucking cylinder  that I'm trying to load and the bullets not even close to being the bullets for the  gun.  They fall right through the cylinder or they're much too big to go on the gun.  Then do you go searching for the right bullets for the rest of your night?  Never find them though.  I know the right bullets are here.  Yeah.  And it's an exhausting process in your dreams.  Exhausting.  Fuck.  I hate those dreams.  Or the gun will get lost or something or just be busted or it's not the right gun or 
[02:16:00]  I'll leave the gun somewhere.  And you know where it is but I left the gun somewhere.  But then it just takes forever to find it.  Yeah.  Oh God.  And my car's always getting stolen in my dreams.  Whenever I park my car, it could be like in a supermarket parking lot or something and  I walk around, I come back and my car's always gone.  My car is always stolen in my dreams.  I don't know but it's always stolen.  That's funny.  Weird dreams.  They're so weird.  Your dreams are stupid.  No, the rape part is great.  You rape and your car is gone.  My car is stolen.  My guns don't work. 
[02:16:30]  My dreams are always, I never get my car stolen but I always lose it.  I always forget where I parked it.  Yeah.  And it's just, it's gone forever.  Like it's, I have no idea what possible block it could be on.  See?  Like it's gone.  Are you searching for it at least?  Yeah, I'm searching for it.  But I know in my heart I'm never finding the car.  That's true.  Because I don't have the faintest idea of where it could be.  There's a guy here that says my dreams are like GTA.  That's true.  Yeah, my car always gets stolen.  And not even sometimes.  And then there's a, there's certain like, I call them sets. 
[02:17:00]  They're set places that some of my recurring dreams take place in.  There's a parking garage that's very familiar to me.  Houses that I've never been in but I know like the back of my hand now.  Because some people say you're actually seeing that for the first time, but for some reason  your brain is registering it like you've been there before.  No, believe me.  These houses are wacky and crazy.  Some of them are like castles.  But how are you?  Some have big tunnels that lead to the basement.  But break it down.  How do you know that you're not seeing that for the first time in your dreams?  Oh, because I remember them from other dreams. 
[02:17:30]  Like I know them from other dreams.  I'm like, oh yeah, that house.  I've been there before.  I remember when that, in that episode, there was some chick and I raped her in the fucking  laundry room.  Right.  And then flew away.  And then I flew away.  But that means you got to list all the stuff you dream about.  And then when it happens again, then you could come in here and go, see, it was on my list.  No, I know I dreamt it.  How do you know though?  You're thinking it's a matrix shit where it's like, it's just the matrix telling me that  I had dreamt it, but it's all in one night. 
[02:18:00]  Are you sure you dreamt it?  Positive.  I've woken up.  But how do you prove it?  Because I've woken up and I've remembered my dream.  Right.  Right?  Okay.  And then I go to sleep.  I wake up the next day and I'm like, ah, that's the same place as the dream I had days  ago.  You've had conscious memories of it in your waking life.  I've had conscious memories of it in my waking life.  Oh.  You sure?  I said that.  All right.  Yes.  Don't make me rape you, Sam.  Be careful.  We can pistol whip you, right?  No, because I'll rob you both.  That's true. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, but I'm, I have no problem killing.  Yeah, that's the fucked up part.  You want to play that fucking game?  I can't rob either of you because you guys know that I'm not going to kill you.  Don't get involved in my dreams.  I'll point the gun at you and you'll be like, what the fuck are you going to do if I don't  do it?  And I'll be like, fuck.  You can't have a robbery fantasy with a gun without the chance that you might have to  use it.  Because that, that just blows the whole dream.  But that's why I have to only rob like the interns and stuff.  It has to be people who will be scared of the perceived threat.  Not people who I'm actually going to have to kill.  You're a dream faggot.  Because I'll be like, yeah, why don't you just shoot me then? 
[02:19:00]  I'll be like, ah, and run away.  You dream like you live your real life.  Yeah, come on.  I'm fucking robbing everybody.  Very boring.  Oh, you're robbing everybody.  If they put up a fight.  No, if they put up a fight, then I'm fucked.  But that won't put up a fight.  I'll rob the banks.  Iraq, what about you?  What would you do?  Oh boy.  If you could do anything, sandwiches, anything without consequence, what would it be?  You're doing it wrong.  You have to do it like Kevin Bacon in Stir of Echoes, where you're invisible. 
[02:19:30]  And you just go, you rape, you rob, and kill all at the same time.  Do you, are you invisible in your dreams?  Are you invisible, guys?  Aw.  Would you rape if you were invisible?  Oh man.  If you were invisible?  Why not?  I know.  People walking down the sidewalk going, what is this wall here?  I can't seem to get around it.  There's a force field.  Eric just said he would rape if you were invisible.  Oh, he's not fat in his dreams.  Oh.  I don't even know what I look like in my dreams. 
[02:20:00]  You don't see yourself.  You've never looked in a dream mirror?  No, of course not.  I've looked in a mirror, and it's scary as fuck, because something always appears in  it.  Do you look in a mirror like Patrick Bateman while you're raping people in a flat seat?  Yeah, flat.  But I do.  Something appears in your mirror?  Yes.  I always get the recurring dream where there'll be lightning outside, and when it flashes,  someone's looking in the window.  Ah, yes.  You get that?  That's old school.  If I look out a window, someone's always out there, and they're creeping around, and  then I get the fucking impotent gun, and then if I look in a mirror, there'll always 
[02:20:30]  be something happening in the mirror that's creepy or fucking, or like poltergeist, where  my ear will fall off or something, and I'm like, ah, my ear just fell out, and I'm trying  to put it back on.  You guys are having nightmares.  Oh, well, you know what, then?  You have way too much stress in your life.  I only have nightmares.  Yeah.  Well, this will mean something different for Anthony, but if you're looking out your window  and you just see an all-black figure in your backyard, but you can't make out the face  or any detail, it's just a black figure out there. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, God, that's scary.  Well, a black figure outside of my house scares me anyway, even in real life.  But that's your tell, isn't it?  When you see something creepy in the mirror, you're like, oh, it's a dream.  Calm down.  Let me find someone to rape.  Crazy shit.  Just fly away from this mirror.  Crazy shit in my dreams will tip me off that it's a dream, but sometimes it won't.  Sometimes it tips me off.  Sometimes it don't tip me off.  And if your fucking eyeball falls out of your head, and you're like, ah, my eye just fell 
[02:21:30]  out, sometimes it could be like, oh, it's a dream, and pop it back in, and sometimes  you're just freaking out that your eyeball just fell out.  That's why I like prison.  I'll also be in prison sometimes.  Why are you in prison?  Because I've been involved in something bad, like a murder.  But you can always get away with that shit.  No, but I'm like, oh my God, I'm in prison.  How do you get caught in your dreams?  I don't know.  I'm all of a sudden just in prison.  Because his guns don't work.  Oh, right.  Yeah, and my guns don't work.  But I'm in prison, and I'm feeling like, holy shit, I'm fucked.  You say you get away with rape in your dreams. 
[02:22:00]  Obviously, you don't.  Only if I know I'm dreaming.  Obviously, you don't if you're now in prison.  Why wouldn't you just fly away from the cops?  Because I don't know I'm dreaming.  If I knew I was dreaming in prison, I'd be the badass in prison.  Right.  I'd be fucking punching and raping people.  Why don't you be like the sisters?  Why don't you be like the sisters?  Why don't you rape the cops that are trying to arrest you for the other raping?  If I know I'm dreaming, they're fucked.  Believe you me.  So why are you in prison?  And what happens when you're in prison?  Sometimes.  More body parts fall off?  Sometimes I remember, I go, oh, fuck, wait a minute.  I was involved in a murder five years ago, and now they're coming around. 
[02:22:30]  They're poking around.  I thought I got away with it.  I totally forgot.  And then they start poking around, and they realize I was involved, and I get hauled off  to fucking prison.  Dude.  That's that anxiety.  How great is it when you wake up and go, holy fuck.  It's a new lease on life.  How great is that day?  It's the best fucking thing.  Freedom.  It's the opposite.  In your dream, you're completely fucked.  And then all of a sudden you wake up and go, and you have that realization like, oh, wait  a minute.  It's not in prison. 
[02:23:00]  It's the opposite of the, I just woke up, and it's a great day.  Oh, shit, I'm in trouble, guy.  Oh, shit, I'm real again.  It was real.  This is like, oh, it's a dream.  It is the best feeling in your life.  Oh, yeah.  But it works the other way.  When you're like, wait, all that.  Sex was real?  Yeah, the sex.  Fuck.  No.  Damn.  No.  It's, it, there, there are also like, when I said, houses, and, um,  uh, a train, there's a train that, uh, uh, has a few stops, and I'm constantly missing 
[02:23:30]  the fucking train.  I have to, and it's across a giant field and stuff, and I'm running for, and it's, oh,  it always takes off before I get there.  I have the lamest dreams.  I always dream I have girlfriends.  Like, they're girls that I have a crush on, and we start a relationship in my dreams.  But you don't have enough time to have a relationship in your dreams.  No, it does.  It starts to build.  Sam, Sam courts.  And you wake up.  Yeah, I court women in my dreams.  It's the worst.  You're actually trying to fucking get a relationship going in your dream? 
[02:24:00]  I have a crush on a girl.  You have a crush on a girl in your dreams?  Yeah, and I try to, you know, treat her well.  I would love to fucking get into that dream and just rape her in front of you.  Oh, what's she doing?  You're like, Sam, Sam, it's a dream, you dummy.  Let's go.  I was courting you.  Tag team.  Let's put her on the rotisserie.  Give me all your money.  And then Sam tries to rob me, and then I try to shoot him, but my gun doesn't hurt.  Oh, this stinks.  Let's all try to get into Sam's dreams tonight and really just fuck up his world.  And you know how lame my anxiety dream is? 
[02:24:30]  This is, like, you have the prison, and I did a murder and all this stuff.  My anxiety dream, I've had it, like, for years, and I get it at least once every two weeks,  is that I'm in college.  Oh, no.  And I've gone through an entire semester forgetting to go to a class.  Oh, forgetting.  I've had that dumb one.  But I have to pass it, and so I have a semester's worth of work that's due tomorrow, and I don't  even know what subject it's in.  Wow.  And that's the anxiety that I wake up in the morning. 
[02:25:00]  And I have to figure out whether or not I'm in college anymore.  That's fucking stressful.  It takes me about five minutes to figure out.  I've had the college dreams, too, where I am not going to graduate.  Yeah.  And then I wake up and go, well, I did graduate, and it doesn't fucking matter.  It's over.  Who cares?  It never mattered if I graduated or not.  So why am I dreaming that I'm not graduating?  See, I had stressed out because I had to graduate to get out of school to start working here.  So that was why I was stressful.  So many years went by where I had, I mean, well into my 30s, where I had high school dreams, 
[02:25:30]  where I was in high school.  We all know what that's about.  I don't have to be an expert there.  And unfortunately, no rape was going on in those dreams.  But I was like, I was going to graduate.  Like they were going to let me graduate in my dream.  And then I wake up and my no diploma ass Anthony is still fucking laying there in bed.  That's my other high school anxiety dream is that, you know, we had gym every other day.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  And so I've gone through like six months of the year not realizing that every other day  was a day two and I had gym on a day two.  What'd you do?  So I haven't gone to gym.  So I'm about to fail gym and not graduate.  Oh, no.  So what'd you do?  That's the thing.  I just stress out and then I wake up and I go, am I still in high school?  Did I forget to go to gym class?  Oh, thank God.  Crazy.  Let me go and fall back to sleep so I can start a relationship with somebody.  Yeah.  Make a relationship going.  God, you shouldn't even sleep.  I know.  It's no reason for you to sleep. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  But I like courting.  I like courtships.  Apparently you do.  It's a dream come true for you.  That's crazy.  I have those high school dreams where I really want to dedicate myself to going to class and  doing all the work and everything so I can graduate and then I just fuck up.  I find myself at home and school started and I'm not there and so I just say, ah, fuck  it.  I'll go tomorrow and then I just, I realize I've been a week without going to class. 
[02:27:00]  Because I can never get the deal done in school.  Are you young Anthony or present?  No, I'm present day Anthony, which is the weirdest thing.  With body parts falling off you?  No, not in school, thank God.  But I am a pretty cool guy in school because I'm me.  You know.  Like when, like in Full House when Uncle Jesse went back to high school.  Cooler than that.  Yeah.  And he couldn't make graduation, so they gave him a ceremony on the subway car that  he was stuck in.  But that's childhood, the 80s stuff.  I guess. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, it was.  I'd have cash.  I would be the best fuck.  I'd be giving cars to girls.  Be like, here, have a car.  Let me fuck.  You would?  Let's fuck.  Yeah, why not?  Like imagine the hottest chick in high school and you want to have sex with her and that  was impossible back in high school.  Right.  And just go, you want a car?  Have one.  Have a car.  Let's fuck.  In the car.  You want to fly to fucking the Bahamas?  Let's go.  Fuck me.  Plus, this is a dream, so we can literally fly to the Bahamas.  And let me tell you, you better say yes. 
[02:28:00]  Because you have no choice here.  You don't even know what's around the corner.  Here's a car.  The second the O from no comes out of your mouth, my dick goes in.  Here's a car.  Fuck me.  And even if you don't want it, you're getting fucked.  You're getting fucked.  Here's another thing about dreams.  Answer, charmer.  Thank you, sir.  Here's another thing about dreams.  A concept.  You think you're multi-playing where the people in your dreams are other people dreaming?  Oh, yeah.  How cool would that be?  So my girlfriends are really out there? 
[02:28:30]  Somewhere.  In their bedroom in some who knows place.  They're getting courted by charming Sam Roberts.  Big whoop of their dreams.  What a fucking shitty dream that was.  But how do you prove that doesn't happen?  I keep dreaming that I was raped.  Yeah.  And then he just flies away.  This guy.  Well, let's go with that for a second.  I am like the Freddy Krueger of rape.  How do you prove that that's not happening?  Yeah.  All the people in your dreams are people.  Other people.  Dreaming.  Dreaming.  And your dreams have just matched up for that night.  And they are in that dream.  Yeah.  Inception shit.  Right. 
[02:29:00]  How great would that be?  That would be pretty fucking good.  I keep having some dream that some idiot who looks like Corey Matthews from Boy Meets World  is trying to be my boyfriend.  You've had that dream?  No.  That's somebody's dream of, you know, sharing me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With you.  That's the girl who's in my dream.  Oh, man.  I have to apologize then to so many women out there that I have to go to fucking dreamy  rape crisis center.  Is there one of those in the dreams?  I don't know.  Does that mean that the dark figure that's stalking E-Rock in his backyard, that that 
[02:29:30]  dark figure is having that dream where he is stalking E-Rock?  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  He looks in the window and goes, why do I want to bother with this guy?  Just stay here.  Oh, well, I got to get on the gun manufacturers.  The dreamy gun manufacturers stink.  Well, he's outside E-Rock's home.  Yeah.  And he goes, damn it, he's getting another late night snack.  I want to break in.  What does this dream mean?  I keep dreaming this guy gets these snacks at night.  Just waiting in his yard for him to go to bed for real. 
[02:30:00]  Fuck.  Yeah, that's a fucked up concept.  Imagine that.  Somebody wakes up and they're just like, they were hanging out with you.  You didn't even know.  Maybe that's why your dreams end, because the other person is waking up before you.  Yeah.  Bastards.  Yeah, you fucked.  Sleep a little longer.  We're having fun.  I'm having fun in my dream.  I just want to keep going.  I want to wake up at that point.  Each other really tough.  But I think we got to remember one word.  That's respect.  You got elected. 
[02:30:30]  The other got to get elected.  Don't forget that.  You're both elected political leaders.  Respect each other and respect the people who elected you.  That's really important.  All right.  Lean forward.  Thank you, Chris Matthews.  He's basically saying both sides should talk a little more.  Lean Obama.  That's what they do.  No, lean forward.  You think he votes for Obama?  Oh, hell yeah.  That's the fucking, the rules over there, I'm sure.  You have to.  I have finally had it with the political talk.  I want these guys to fucking start debating each other. 
[02:31:00]  I know.  Where's the debate?  I've had it.  On real issues.  You go to MSNBC and it's like, okay, they have free reigns to bash this shit out of Romney,  right?  Yeah.  And then you go to Fox and they do the exact same thing to Obama.  That's all brave.  Real brave shit.  Why doesn't one of these guys on a show go and call out the other guy and go, let's  do this.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  Let's go.  We'll fucking simulcast it.  Let's do it.  We'll simulcast it on MSNBC.  Right.  And we'll put it on Fox as well and we are going to fucking debate this shit. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  I hate these one-sided debates.  Well, they're going to be debating soon, I guess.  And then they go, well, no, we do represent the other side, but they don't really represent  the other side.  They'll be debating soon.  I mean, these dopey news guys that they, that Ed Schultzes, the Ed Schultzes of the  world where they're big, fat fucking blowhards, all brave and shit.  Blowhard.  But they would never talk with each other.  Oh, yeah.  I was just looking at the commercials. 
[02:32:00]  Here's some fucking AARP commercial where it's a bunch of the old guys getting the band  back together and all I'm thinking is, oh God, that's what I'm doing.  Oh yeah.  It's a week away.  Yes, Friday.  A week from tomorrow.  Friday.  Oh, I've got to remember the name of the place.  I really should write that down.  It's in Billmore.  I remember that.  Hey, has anybody on PalTalk remembered the name of the place I'm playing at next Friday?  Oh my God.  And will you say it?  I forgot too.  We made fun of the name too.  I know.  We did.  Oh my goodness gracious.  Someone's got to know it. 
[02:32:30]  I guess not.  It's on Facebook.  No, it's not that.  No, it's not that.  No.  Oh well.  I'll have it after the break.  And you'll be tweeting it.  I've got to write it down.  Put it on our little show prep every day so I remember to plug it.  That's not a bad idea.  I finally have something to plug.  All right.  Well, when we get back, I think we've got to get into the kid thing.  Two kids historically crying after seeing The Odd Life of Timothy Green.  Oh yeah, kids got really upset.  Well, I don't blame the kids.  What's that movie about? 
[02:33:00]  Did you see the movie?  I've seen the preview.  It's fucking creepy.  Dead kid.  Oh God.  It leaves on his legs.  Oh, it's frightening.  Because he's been dead a while.  That is frightening.  Fucking creepy.  And it's a kid movie?  Yeah, it's like an animation.  You want kids to go there?  It's one of those animated flicks, but some of these animated flicks are becoming a bit on  the dark side.  Is it animated?  No, it's not animated.  Which one are we talking about then?  The one with the kid who has leaves on his ankles.  No, that's right.  That's a real kid.  Show me the trailer after the break. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  Trailer.  What am I thinking of?  I don't know, but I think the movie is more a kid grows from the ground because they can't  have kids or something like that.  And it's not animated?  It's not animated, no.  Is there one animated that's also like...  I think there's a similar one.  You're right.  Yes.  I think so too.  I think you're right.  I'm very confused.  K.J.  Farrell's in Belmore.  Thank you.  A week from Friday.  A week from tomorrow.  Here's my brother.  He's texting like, where are you going to know?  K.J.  Farrell's you tool. 
[02:34:00]  Joe.  Yes.  K.J.  Farrell's in Belport.  Is it Belport or Belmore?  Motherfucker.  I think it's Belmore.  Because if it's Belmore, you're a tool, Joe.  Then you're a fucking tool.  We've been saying Belmore.  It's Belmore.  You tool, Joe.  We've been saying Belmore.  Yeah, it's Belmore.  K.J.  Farrell's Belmore.  And that's Friday.  This.  Not this Friday.  But you're going to have to work Friday. 
[02:34:30]  The Friday of...  Oh, my God.  If I got work.  Jesus.  Do we have an answer on Ant's days off yet?  Let me give that a checkeroo.  We demanded that we get an answer by nine.  No answer yet.  It's the Friday of Labor Day weekend Friday.  Yeah.  Right.  The last Friday in August.  We're going to have to work Friday before Labor Day, are we, you think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for everything.  I really appreciate this place. 
[02:35:00]  Tremendously.  I'd better get off.  Huh?  I'd better get fucking off.  Those three days?  Yeah.  I've got to take a piss.  I'd better.  I want to know.  Time's ticking.  They got eight more minutes to fucking get the info to me.  And then what happens?  Nothing.  I know.  That's what sucks about this.  They got eight more minutes.  And then after eight minutes, then they have an hour.  Good.  And then I go home.  They will not...  Oh, Erock.  Something else that might work in your favor?  Yes.  Besides the days that you were off with the doctor's notes stating that you were contagious, you 
[02:35:30]  couldn't be at work.  Uh-huh.  You had to take another day off because the company made you get the doctor's note.  Whoa, that's a free day off.  So fucking fat lock comes through and tells me exactly what I need legally.  You get that day back.  Yeah.  I remember that day.  You were on your way in and they said you can't come in here.  Yeah.  Until we figure out what the fuck's going on.  Wow.  So you got that day back.  Yeah, I got that day back.  Which is nice.  So that might be your Friday now.  Which is nice. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  What the hell's Joe doing here?  Just keep plugging.  Friday the 31st.  You want me to feed you your jokes too?  No, Joe.  Please.  Believe me.  Yeah, Joe.  Feed me the plugs.  Feed me where the location of the bar is.  Feed me the gig location.  The gig information.  But as far as those jokes go, you best leave that to me.  Wow.  The brothers are fighting.  Nah, Joe's cool. 
[02:36:30]  He knows he's not funny.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  We might have a Van Halen situation.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Remember that?  By the way, Joe, we write about the Van Halen situation.  Remember everyone?  No, they're just canceled for a little while, guys.  Gone.  You're way off on this one.  Remember?  We didn't even talk about that one.  Yeah.  That thing is canceled.  Kaput.  Remember they said, oh, no, we just need to take a little time.  Over, Johnny.  And we said, nope, there's got to be something big going on with that band.  Over.  Yeah, Joe, don't be a queeb. 
[02:37:00]  Don't be a quay.  A quay.  You're a queerbait.  Ah, we used to say queerbait.  Queerbait.  Quay.  That's quay, which is gay and queer and gay.  Quay.  Both.  But for some reason, it was something that we called each other back in school as a rank  out.  And queeb.  You're a queeb.  You're a queerbait.  You're a quay.  Thank you.  I don't remember quay.  I remember quay.  I remember queerbait.  Queermo?  GK, you called people Queermo?  Queermo? 
[02:37:30]  Queermo.  Queermo.  That's pretty good.  Did you ever play Smear the Queer?  Oh, man.  Did you?  No.  Smear.  Isn't that kill the guy with the ball?  Well, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I never called it that.  Jesus.  We did.  Intolerant people over there at Harborfield.  But we didn't know what that really meant.  We just knew whoever had the ball was the queer and we had to fucking Smear them.  Kevin from Connecticut says they just call them Sams.  It's interesting.  Well, Kevin from Connecticut can keep his comments to himself, quite frankly. 
[02:38:00]  Well, what happened there?  You're rude.  No, no, no.  Kevin is rude.  You're extremely rude.  Hey, the listeners are the important people here.  I love the listeners.  You guys weren't creative.  Kill the man with the ball?  Kill the guy with the ball.  Oh, kill the guy with the ball?  That's it?  Kill the guy with the ball.  That's what it was called.  You could have called it anything.  The teachers weren't around.  Pretty literal.  That's brutally bad.  Kill the guy with the ball.  I wonder what else it was called.  What else was it called?  I'm sure down south they had a few variations. 
[02:38:30]  Variations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  All right.  We'll figure it all out next.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  New from Grody Publishing comes the audio book.  So erotic, it will make you question everything.  Damn!  That's a good book on tape.  The best-selling cultural phenomenon evolves just for men. 
[02:39:00]  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.  The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.  Club Soda Kenny takes you on a journey you've only been to in your deepest fantasies.  Suck me, baby.  Millions of red-blooded men have gotten rigid over the excitement of Fifty Shades of Gay. 
[02:39:30]  Bro, I've tasted my cum?  After hearing Fifty Shades of Gay, I would totally be down for tasting someone else's.  Or whatever.  I'm a quivering, moist mess, and he hasn't even touched me.  I've always been a guy that's, like, totally into chicks with tits and stuff like that.  But you know what?  This book is frickin' hot as shit.  Holy fuck.  This is wrong, but holy hell is it erotic.  For the first time, I'm sexually attracted to something that isn't available at the deli counter. 
[02:40:00]  My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid desire.  Ooh, I don't fuck guys, man.  But I'll jack off to this, man.  Damn!  The experts agree Fifty Shades of Gay is a must-listen.  Hello, I'm Dr. Gay.  This audio book is a must-listen for any man looking to further a healthy sex life.  I'm erect.  Fifty Shades of Gay.  If you're not turned on now, you will be. 
[02:40:30]  Yum.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's comin' over here.  Slowly limpin' down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  You sure you had to make a big boy love ya?  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers presidential candidate Rick Santorum.  I like Rick Santorum.  Sure. 
[02:41:00]  He looks like a lot of my friends.  Wears the sweaters.  And he's got the Anson, the Anson Williams hairdo.  I would file trade with a guy that looked like Rick Santorum.  He would always go, I don't like the gays.  I'd go, me neither.  But it don't count when they're really young and you're just trying to teach them.  We would teach them how to kiss.  You gotta sit them down, you put them on your lap.  You go, now here's what you do with the lady.  And you take the shirt off and you rub the back a little.  And then you just plant one on the neck. 
[02:41:30]  And you whisper something.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  Open them out.  If you kiss too hard, sometimes I'd get crazy.  And we would lay on the beach like I was Montgomery Cliff.  Yeah, whatever it's called.  Look, from over there to eternity or something, I'd pretend there was seaweed on us.  And I'd kiss real hard and they'd go, oh, you whiskers.  I'd go, why are you talking?  And they'd say, you're kissing my butt.  You just teach them how to kiss. 
[02:42:00]  And you gotta keep telling them, close your eyes.  You look frightened.  You gotta make them close the eyes.  People like that better in the pictures.  Paul, you gotta ask them.  They look frightened.  Damn kids messing up the pictures.  A lot of parents said, what happened to his face, Mr. Hargis?  He fell.  He skinned it on the rug.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here. 
[02:42:30]  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  Um, I hate to say this.  It pains me to say this.  It pains you.  But management did the right thing.  Yes.  But management did the right thing.  It hurts my soul.  Look, I'm always in a quandary.  I'm sure they didn't do anything, but look, see that I did have three available days. 
[02:43:30]  Guess what?  They gave me a couple extra, too.  Did they?  They're actually, it sounds strange, but they're doing the right thing.  And it pains me to say this.  I'm kind of in a quandary.  I want them to do the right thing, but I don't want to be able to say that they did the right thing.  Uh-huh.  I'm very, I'm very troubled right now.  Well, unless.  But Rob Cross said he, uh, is he taking credit? 
[02:44:00]  Um, he talked to Gary.  Let's give Rob Cross the credit on this one.  Oh, poor Gary.  Wow.  Let's give Rob Cross.  Why poor Gary?  What are you getting at?  Well, you feed him a shit sandwich every day this show.  Right.  And he finally is like, okay, I'm going to do something that the guys are going to appreciate.  And you're like, fuck that guy.  Let's give Rob Cross the credit.  I didn't see Gary when we took a break.  I saw Rob Cross.  He's not feeling well.  I'm not sure if he saw me, but I saw him.  Geez.  And then he said he laughed at one of your jokes, so you feel like you have carte blanche to make Rob Cross jokes now, because he said he laughed. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, hey.  He laughed at my, uh, not in sync.  Oh, no.  Line.  Jesus.  And, uh, I go, oh, I didn't realize you were listening.  Oh, jeez.  What are the possibilities, just devil's advocate here, that management had messed up?  Well, that's the numbers.  Thank you, Sam Roberts, for real.  Because if they're doing the right thing, that's great. 
[02:45:00]  But if they're not doing the right thing, it's just something that...  They messed up and now acting like they're doing a favor.  Hey, exactly.  Hopi, we're going to throw you a bone.  Exactly.  Give you exact...  Or not even made a mistake, they hold it back.  Right.  Until the point where you go, this fucking sucks.  And then they go, you know what, we're going to toss you a couple of days.  We've been in this business quite a while.  Sometimes they will do that.  They realize they fucked up, but now they're going to make it look like they're just good  guys.  So, Iraq, you're still on the assignment.  Yeah, I think they might have been shortchanging you the whole time. 
[02:45:30]  So now they can say, oh, no, we'll give you some extra days.  But you really had them, but they know you don't pay attention to them.  And now they're making it seem like they're the hero.  Thus then what I said before you said it.  Right.  Correct.  Were you reiterating?  You were reiterating.  Yeah, he was great.  With a reiteration.  With a reiteration.  Exactly.  Iraq, did we bond in the bathroom just now?  Ew.  You docked.  We didn't dock.  What the fuck are you guys doing in there? 
[02:46:00]  When you bond in a bathroom, it usually means docking.  Or just straight ass sex.  Did we have a...  Oh, yuck.  Canoodling.  There's a bottom.  Oh, you guys canoodled in the bathroom?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Come on.  Did we not bond in the bathroom?  Yes.  I'm sick of being the bad guy all the time.  I was telling Opie about an employee here that we saw fall into the wall.  Who fell?  Someone.  Come on.  On this one, I just want to say someone.  Why don't we all be bonding now?  What, like that wrestler that fell through the wall? 
[02:46:30]  Shockmaster?  Like Shockmaster?  Except it would have been through the window out the building.  Wow.  Who fell?  This person fell into the glass.  One hint.  Two hints.  This person didn't see some wires that were set up.  Didn't see wires a hint?  No, it wasn't wrong across.  Oh, man.  What?  Sam asked.  How dare you.  That's not what I was implying.  What's the hint then?  Out near the lobby.  You know, like when they lay wiring across a road, they put that plastic covering on it  so a car can drive over it? 
[02:47:00]  Well, one of those things is out there, and somebody came down the stairs from upstairs,  made a left, didn't see it, and then took a header into the window.  S-B.  No.  All right.  Are they on air?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Do they work for our queue?  No.  Oh.  Are we playing five questions?  Because I'm only going to give you five.  Five?  Okay.  Five starting now, though.  That's starting right now.  That's not fucking fair.  No, because we didn't know we had only five.  And I get five, too.  Okay.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:47:30]  You guys get to sign on the five questions.  You guys get to come up with a question, then look at the other guy and go, do we want  to go with this question?  Oh, okay.  Should I keep asking, like, what station?  Like, should I ask if it's shade for you?  Should I just ask what station?  What channel, maybe?  That's true.  Should I ask?  Well, you already asked out queue, so that counts as one.  And the biggest hint I will give you, it was hilarious.  I think we can only do yes or no questions.  Is it only yes or no questions?  It's up to you.  You have five questions.  Oh, well, if it's up to us, then what station is it? 
[02:48:00]  No, no, it is yes or no.  Of course.  You know the rules.  What if I should ask, because Roland thinks it might be Nicole, so should I ask if this  person has been on our show before?  Let's cut the whole fucking thing in half.  Okay.  Is it male?  Great.  Yes.  That's a guy.  Take all the bitches and throw them the fuck out of the list here.  We don't need to even think about the bitches.  Ant's way smarter at this game than you are, Sam. 
[02:48:30]  I'm just strategizing with him.  You're way smarter.  Who's smarter?  You're looking at me.  Don't trick the audience into thinking that you were looking at Anthony.  You were looking at me when you said that.  Now, the whole thing with these questions is chopping out giant chunks of people.  How many questions do we have left?  Four.  Four.  We have four questions.  Four!  You mother four!  Well, we answered one of your questions, so that's not fair.  Does it matter?  No.  Don't manage man.  That was only an exhibition question.  What about admission? 
[02:49:00]  You can't have an exhibition question that's real?  Or is it just pretty sure that they're white?  It counted, so it can't be an exhibition.  Yeah.  Well, no, it is.  Come on.  We didn't know what that was even a game at that point.  Four.  Four.  We have four.  I'm the judge.  No.  I never would have agreed to that stupid question that Sam asked.  What was the question?  I don't even remember now.  It was stupid.  It was too fucking...  Travis?  It was too narrow.  Do we allow an exhibition question that was answered?  You have to.  No.  No.  That was exhibition.  It was exhibition, so it doesn't count as one. 
[02:49:30]  You have to make believe they didn't hear the answer.  Do preseason games count?  No.  Exactly.  Yeah, but I'll pretend I didn't hear the answer.  It's out of my head.  I don't even know it.  Like when something happens and the jury is supposed to strike it from the record.  I forgot what the answer was.  I did, too.  You forgot the answer?  Yeah.  Okay, then that's fair.  Sam, did we conclude if they were on air or off air?  Yeah, they're on air.  Yeah.  Definitely on air.  Okay.  Is that one of your questions?  Oh, wait.  No, no.  I'm not...  We're fucking consulting.  That isn't a question.  Do you think...  Do you think it was somebody who's had a problem with the show? 
[02:50:00]  Who used to scowl at us?  Oh.  I hope it was.  I hope it was.  Wow.  I mean, we could do an age thing, like over under...  We could.  Exactly.  35?  Let's go over under...  35 is rough because it's so in the middle.  We should go over under 40?  Oh. 
[02:50:30]  And then you kind of know, even if you don't know an age, you know if somebody's over under  40.  Yeah, but you've got to think, how many people under 40 are on the air here?  Yeah, well...  You might want to do 50.  Oh, Jesus.  That's crazy.  That's not crazy if it's who I think it is.  I think that's crazy.  Who do you think it is?  You're trying to get...  I think it's the guy I was talking about?  Yeah.  I think it's Mr. I-have-to-shit-in-the-handicap-bathroom-when-nobody-else-is-in-any-of-the-stalls.  What's that about?  I just...  I don't know why it's a pet peeve...  I don't mind a good handicap stall because it can spread out a little bit. 
[02:51:00]  You really can.  But what if there's a handicapped guy that needs to take a shit?  Tough shit.  Where's he going?  What handicapped guy?  What else does he have to do during his day?  Who's coming in?  That's true.  That's so rude.  Ow.  Well, I mean, one other tell would be if when he exited the stairs, did he come up the hallway  past the bathrooms or did he go around the other side?  Because the other side is where the guy who shits... 
[02:51:30]  I don't know.  It goes...  It's limited, though.  We can't narrow it down to try to get one person.  We've got to chip away at the big picture here first.  So you want to get the age?  Time's up.  I need your next question.  No, okay.  The age thing?  Let's go.  Come on.  And let's go with 40.  40.  All right.  Is this person over 40?  Real age or padded age?  Everyone pads their ages around here.  I have not heard any padding of ages.  I would say real age. 
[02:52:00]  Was he over 40?  Over 40.  Yes.  Okay.  It's somebody over 40.  Most of this place is over 40.  I know.  Well, that's why I said...  Troy's what?  A year away.  And he'll be the last guy.  But it eliminates a lot of the staff.  It eliminates like, you know, Roland and a lot of people.  Plus it's on the air.  On air.  And so it kills almost all the morning mashup.  I'm not sure about Stan, but it kills the rest of them.  Stan might be older than us. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  How many questions have we got left?  I think it kills sway, too.  Yeah.  It's not sway.  Three left.  It's not sway.  That was a good question.  Come on.  I'm out.  I think it's A.B.  Really?  I think so.  A.B.  I think so.  Okay.  Let's see.  All right.  You know what?  We should go with the issue with the show.  With the show.  Okay.  Problem.  Not issue.  History.  What if you say history?  That way-  We have a history with everyone here at this point.  A negative history. 
[02:53:00]  Negative history.  Very good.  Meaning at any point, not like Opie's we're good now thing where he treats them like shit  and then-  With the fucking building bridges shit.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  Has this part-  I'm going to stop your question.  Oh, come on!  Because we have a problem with every single person here.  Well, not on air.  No.  Not that it's been presented on the air.  No.  All right.  Go with your question.  By the way, I'm not asking that question.  He just answered it.  Because it's a yes, obviously.  It's a yes. 
[02:53:30]  Okay.  Okay.  So now I didn't waste the question.  Good.  Good thinking, dude.  I answered your question.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  I never asked the question.  Fuck!  Yes!  You tricked me.  All right.  What about simply if they want to ask?  I want to ask if they have a full head of hair.  Oh, that's a good one.  Because that eliminates a lot of people.  Go ahead.  Ask your question.  Does this person have a full head of hair?  And I swear to you, I don't know.  I don't look at people. 
[02:54:00]  No, come on.  A-Rock then, does this person have-  A-Rock, does he?  I don't know.  Does he have a full head of hair?  I would say no.  Ah.  No.  All right.  I think we are honing in here.  And I would say I don't know.  And that's my real answer.  But A-Rock definitely said no.  No is the answer, right?  No.  Two questions left.  Two questions left.  Do you think we should ask if it's the person now, and then that way we have one question  in the chamber?  Oh, that is a good idea.  Just in case? 
[02:54:30]  Just in case.  Then we can just throw a wild card.  Yeah.  Can I stop you?  That's the dumbest idea.  Why?  No, it's a great idea.  Because it's a waste of a question.  No, because we'd ask that as the last question.  But we can ask two more questions and then give an answer.  So why would you waste that?  Instead of getting as much info as possible.  All right.  Kind of like when people keep guessing letters on Wheel of Fortune when you already know what  it is.  Yes.  Exactly.  How about...  I don't know why I'm helping you, but that is really the dumbest strategy in this game. 
[02:55:00]  It is a terrible strategy.  You're right.  How about based on...  Because when you assume, okay, I want to ask if it's this person.  So then you think what this person is, and then you would ask another question that keeps  other people in the ball game possibly that you weren't sure about.  But we're going to be able to...  Or knocks them out, I guess.  We're going to be able to make a guess and you'll tell us whether we're right or wrong  after the five questions?  Yes.  That's how this game works.  You always get five questions and then you have to come up with the answer.  Some people think that one of the last questions is who is this person. 
[02:55:30]  I've never played it that way.  That is silly.  Some people don't play that way.  That is silly.  I think you guys have narrowed it down so well that you could probably knock it out in this  question.  You could probably have an extra question.  Maybe.  They already have a couple of extra questions.  They're tricking me here.  Would...  Based...  How about we ask this?  Based on...  What are we doing here again, E-Rock?  We're trying to figure out who?  For what?  Because people are just turning...  Who fell into the glass window.  Who tripped and took a header into the wall of the window?  That you...  That Opie and E-Rock saw this.  Me and Sam did not. 
[02:56:00]  I did not see this.  But Opie and E-Rock laughed about it together in the bathroom.  We bonded in the bathroom.  Right, right.  Bonded in the bathroom.  With our dicks out, but we weren't looking at each other's dicks.  And you know what?  Opie said, for this one, I would choose to say it was just someone.  That is a big hint, because if you remember, somebody didn't want us bringing their name  up on the air.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  It's all coming together.  Let's see.  I want to ask this question.  I'm not asking it.  This is just me conferencing.  We got to word it like, based on a typical body style, would this person be considered 
[02:56:30]  overweight?  Yeah, I think so, for sure.  So would I.  So let's throw that question.  Yeah, and don't fuck around and say, well, I don't consider them overweight.  Exactly.  Be cool.  That's why I said, based on what medical experts deem overweight.  Yes.  So you think Eric would be like, I think he looks fine.  Yeah, exactly.  No dick.  Okay.  Based on medical criteria, would this person be considered overweight? 
[02:57:00]  I don't know.  Come on.  I don't see people.  Eric is yes.  Yes.  Eric says yes.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Significantly overweight.  Last question.  And if E-Rock's saying he's overweight, can I guess it's an elephant?  No?  Let's put an elephant fill into that.  Last question.  Last question.  He's bigger than E-Rock. 
[02:57:30]  Then he is definitely overweight.  Fair enough.  I was trying to help you out there, Eric.  That's not a compliment.  But I was trying to help you.  You saw that, right?  That's not helping.  But I'm changing my tune.  I was trying to help you out there.  No, that was very backhanded.  Overweight.  All right.  Here's what we got.  That was a setup.  We got an overweight, bald guy.  Overweight, bald guy.  On air.  Over 40.  Not on out cue.  I mean, we forgot that.  Oh, shit.  What?  You promised me you forgot the answer.  I just forgot it again.  That is the dumbest thing, but who cares? 
[02:58:00]  That's a question.  And we would have already narrowed it down to not on out cue.  I'm sorry.  You broke the rule.  You promised me you forgot the answer.  Damn it.  Now that's a question.  No.  You're done with your question.  Okay, so one more question.  No.  One more.  One more.  No, you got the five.  No, because you answered I don't know to two questions.  That's bullshit.  So one more.  But E-Rock's in on this game.  Yeah, but E-Rock can't be trusted.  One more.  Come on.  We got one more.  Nope.  One more.  We got one more.  What's going to be the last question?  Should we ask if he's been in radio for a long time? 
[02:58:30]  No, because he probably has.  Everyone here is a dinosaur in fucking radio.  Ask if he brings the entire New York Times into the bathroom.  How about has he ever gone to management to complain about this program?  That could be a bunch of people.  That's a great question.  Not really, but it really does whittle down.  Yeah, let's ask that for the last question.  Ready?  Okay. 
[02:59:00]  Has he ever gone to any form of management here?  Any form.  And that includes human resources?  Right, right, right.  To voice any type of complaint about what this show was doing in any way, shape, or form?  I don't know.  Ah, come on.  Eric Hansi?  Yes, he has.  Yes, he has.  All right.  Thank God.  Do you want to do match game answers so you don't have to run?  We know.  I think we got this.  Can we make our guess? 
[02:59:30]  Mm-hmm.  You want to say it on three?  One, two, three.  Alex Bennett!  You're simply the best!  Yes!  Woo!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, hell yeah.  Yes!  Oh, hell yeah.  Yes!  Burn!  How long did that take?  How many minutes did we knock out with that load of horse shit?  Plus, E-Rock, what happened? 
[03:00:00]  Because I didn't see it.  Yes!  We did chuckle about it in the bathroom.  By the way, I just want to point out, he takes your newspapers that you leave there.  Ew, in the bathroom?  Yeah.  He picks up the newspapers off the floor and takes them with him.  I'm going to shit on him.  That's gross.  Just sit with him?  Ugh.  He doesn't get it in the newspapers?  I don't know, but why if you can get free toilet, you know, papers?  I'm sorry, this book's been in the bathroom.  What happened?  What did you see? 
[03:00:30]  He was coming down the stairs.  They closed the bathroom down here, so you had to go upstairs.  Just the dumbest thing.  We don't have time to search out other bathrooms when you're doing a radio show.  So he's coming down the stairs, gets down to the floor, and he's not looking.  He's looking at the paper.  Turns left, and they have that plastic guard out for the wiring.  Not paying attention.  Hits that and the speaker that's set up there, and goes face first, because all the windows  are in columns.  Yeah.  So hits the edge of the column and then into the groove of the window. 
[03:01:00]  Imagine if you just would have fallen through the window and plummeted 36 floors with a  Dumb newspaper in his hand.  This newspaper smells like shit.  He hits the ground, and then like five seconds later, fluttering newspaper slams on him.  He gets up, and he's all damning, like he's going to kick the wiring.  Oh, he got mad?  Oh, he's all mad.  Did he see that you saw him?  Myself and one of the interns saw him.  We just stood there looking at him. 
[03:01:30]  Did he laugh?  Oh, yeah.  Was he mad?  He just grunted all the way down the hall.  Jesus, man.  Can I tell you why I thought it was someone from Al-Q?  Why?  Because like a couple weeks ago, one of the guys from Al-Q was walking to the bathroom,  and you know that downhill slant in the hallway right before the bathroom?  Yeah, we have a fake floor here for all the wiring.  Right.  And you know how the wall next to it has every logo of every channel framed?  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  He tripped as he was walking, and he fell face first to the floor, and he tried to brace  himself.  Like, I thought there was something wrong with him.  He tried to brace himself on the wall, and he took down 60% of the frames with him.  That's how he fell face first on the floor, and every logo of every channel fell on top  of him.  Holy shit.  Hilarious.  But maybe he was just doing the right thing for the company, going, look, get rid of all  these fucking channels, please.  Sheep who needs them.  Next time you go to the bathroom, look, you can see that half the frames are cracked, because 
[03:02:30]  he started putting them back on the wall.  All fucking busted.  He broke them.  That's fucking great.  After all that, someone goes, who the fuck is Alex Bennett?  He was the guy who didn't like that we had TVs.  Yeah.  Yeah, he tried to take one of them or something?  Yeah, I think he took one of them.  He used to be in here.  This was his studio?  He couldn't have it.  Right. 
[03:03:00]  Who cares?  They had one of our TVs over there, and we found out that one of our TVs was over there,  and we asked to have it taken back.  People do understand.  We haven't talked about it in a while.  Well, we have eight TVs in the studio, to this day.  And no one else has a TV, right?  No.  Literally yesterday, somebody mentioned to me.  Could you have one of the interns quickly do a search and see who else has TVs in their  studio?  Well, we had.  We have eight.  Only Mad Dog.  Yesterday, some guy came up to me. 
[03:03:30]  He's like, you know, I remember your guys' first day at Sirius when you were running up  and down the halls with mic wires attached to you, yelling that you guys had two offices  and 12 TVs.  Oh, my God.  Remember that?  And the rest of us had none.  We used to have 12, right?  Well, we have four in the office.  And no one else has this?  Nobody has them.  They tried to make up for what they didn't give us in televisions.  No.  No.  These are XM TVs.  Yeah, that's right.  What is it called?  They came with their grandfathered in.  They grandfathered in these TVs. 
[03:04:00]  They can't touch these.  We had a fuckload of TVs in that other place.  We had TVs that weren't even facing us.  Yeah.  They were facing the other part of the fucking studio.  It was great.  We had four, right?  Oh, that big fucking floor.  We had Razor Rollerboard Scooter in that place.  It was giant.  Remember we used to have an audience?  Live audience.  Bleachers.  I mean a live audience.  We had bleachers.  I really feel like we were broadcasting out of a basketball court after all this time here.  Yeah.  Like, I feel like that was...  Like, in my memory, that was a basketball court.  Yeah, it was awesome.  It was so fucking cool.  Oh, God.  What a great studio. 
[03:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  Anyway, the kid crying over the odd life of Timothy Green.  All right.  We got two kids.  What's the animated feature?  Someone came up with it.  It was a Paranorman?  Yeah.  That's creepy.  What's that?  Show that.  I don't know.  Some shitty...  It looks shitty.  It's getting great reviews.  Why does it look shitty?  It's by the same company that did Coraline.  Coraline was pretty shitty.  Coraline was good.  God, stop it.  You're brainwashed.  Brainwashed with what?  I don't even know what Coraline is. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Or at least brainwashed you.  I don't know what this is.  Pretty good show.  Paranorman looks shit.  Yeah, Robot of Monster.  That's a good show.  It looks awful.  My kid was scared shitless of Shrek.  Of Shrek?  Really?  But he's over it now.  You don't understand this shit.  Yeah.  To him, he's like, what the fuck?  To you, it's like, oh, that's Shrek.  But he's seen it for the first time.  And he was scared of The Incredibles.  Really?  But didn't want me to turn it off.  He would just sit close and just deal with it.  He wasn't scared of this trailer. 
[03:05:30]  I don't know, I think.  Meet Norman.  Can't you be like other kids your age?  His parents don't get him.  He's probably up there fiddling with his Ouija or his orb.  Harry.  Your sister doesn't like him.  You are such a loser.  And the kids at school.  Look, it's Ab Norman.  Always pick on him.  But he does have some frash.  Norman, wait up.  I like to be alone.  So do I.  Let's do it together.  It's just that most of them.  Good morning.  Aren't exactly alive. 
[03:06:00]  How's it hanging?  Can they do this, Morgan?  Yeah.  Do you see ghosts like all the time?  Yeah, he sees ghosts all the time.  He's a good boy.  Uh, that's not his chin.  Ah, he's kissing the dog's ass.  Oh, couldn't he use another stall?  Time is running out.  From the makers of Coral.  All right.  All right.  What are we doing?  Odd Life of Timothy Green.  It's like that movie with those people in the attic there. 
[03:06:30]  The, uh...  With Alec Baldwin.  Oh, oh.  Why can't I think of the name of that movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Beetlejuice.  Beetlejuice.  It's Beetlejuice.  Careful we don't say it three times.  Yeah.  What happens?  Beetlejuice comes out of the little, uh, model.  Comes to life.  Yeah, let's see if that happens.  No, don't do it.  What's the other one?  So what's the Timothy Green one?  Timothy Green is when, like, uh, these parents can't have kids or something.  And then when...  And then...  You like that?  Right. 
[03:07:00]  And then a kid grows...  Why do kid movies...  Why are they based around parents not having kids?  That Up movie was fucking twisted.  How sad that was.  Really sad.  But...  I unexpectedly become the mother of an extraordinary boy.  Oh, shut up.  Take a look.  Ugh.  Glad she set it up.  This preview has been rated PG.  Dun-da-dun.  We wanted to tell you our story.  There's just one thing.  You're gonna find it hard to believe. 
[03:07:30]  Because it's not true.  We have explored every medical option.  Uh-huh.  Disney loves it when people can't have kids.  They're barren.  It's twisted.  You heard what the doctor said.  It's their whole base.  Don't they want kids to go to their theme parks?  That useless dustbin of a womb.  Her womb.  Honest to a fault.  Yes.  Our kid.  We're making qualities that they would want in their kid that they can't have at all.  And they put it in a lockbox.  We're moving on. 
[03:08:00]  And they bury it.  Oh, and the kid grows.  And they're moving on.  That's good.  The second that works, the guy would be out there with a box full of things like nice tits.  Tight ass.  Right.  It's like Pet Sematary.  Does Gage come out and stab his mom in the ankle with scissors?  Hi.  You're like a seven-year-old.  I'm Timothy.  Yeah, why would we...  Why would anybody want to start with a shitty seven-year-old?  Yeah.  Timothy.  There's something you need to know about me. 
[03:08:30]  I came from the garden.  He's got a leaf.  Where did he come from?  Yeah, he's got a leaf.  I got problems.  They're not like screaming in terror that a kid just...  Yeah.  That looks like he was sleeping in a shit garden.  It would have been funnier if they went in the bathroom and it was Donnie Wahlberg from  Sixth Sense.  Right.  And why don't they just pull the leaves off his legs?  They can't.  That's got to hurt.  What do you mean they can't?  They're growing out of him.  I don't know.  For the love of God.  Yeah.  He comes from the garden.  He's a flower.  Yeah.  You can't pull the leaves off a flower.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Let's see what happens. 
[03:09:00]  Kind of miraculous.  So you all came from your mom's tummies?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  How was that?  That's not normal.  I decided our son would not be seen as different.  I haven't buried him out in a yard.  Have a great day.  That's too much pressure.  Have the day you have.  Incredible.  This isn't going to work, is it?  No.  Oh, they try cutting the leaves off.  They just grow back.  Make a wish.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  They're having a great time with the kid.  He's playing soccer. 
[03:09:30]  He's swimming.  He's swimming.  Aw.  You're not the only one with the secret.  Really?  Oh.  Oh.  She was touched?  The secret?  I don't like this.  I never thought I'd hear that laughing.  I left this house and that leaves in my underwears.  What's going on?  You know that he's different.  Yeah.  That's what I like about him.  Well, it's an amazing, he's inspiring everybody around him. 
[03:10:00]  That little miracle.  He's got leaves on his ankles.  And he's got leaves.  I'm inspired.  Wait a minute.  Does he die when, like, fall comes around?  He dies at the end.  Does he?  He has to.  Spoiler.  Spoiler.  Yeah, he's dead.  He gives a fuck at the end.  I swear I'm just guessing.  Everyone knows he dies, fall comes, his leaves fall off, and he dies.  Right.  That's why they can't get rid of the leaves.  Yeah.  He's dead.  Because the leaves will die and he, oh my God.  That's 100% right.  Is it really 100% right?  Well, I mean, I didn't see the movie, but he absolutely dies.  We have. 
[03:10:30]  Because they're setting it up.  It's too good to be true.  So obviously something dumb has to happen.  Yeah, what happens?  It ends with them all laughing and then he grows up into a fucking vine man.  Right.  No.  Vine man.  Vine man.  It's about appreciating what you have while you have it.  Yeah.  Living an entire life.  Do you know that summer's short?  Oh, shit.  It's like short as fuck.  So he's only around for a couple months?  Well, it's only one movie.  And then what happens?  I bet they do something at the end where it's like, don't worry, he'll be back when  the fucking leaves come back or some shit. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, like Frosty.  That is the story of Frosty.  Happy birthday.  I'm not sure.  I love when Frosty came back.  You always thought he wasn't going to come back with that puddle.  Nope.  He's dead.  All right.  No, he doesn't.  No, he just dies?  Dead.  Yeah.  I'm just reading a spoiler here.  Yeah.  When he loses his leaves, he's dead.  Damn.  So he's got to tell his parents, I'm going to die now.  So that's a big fuck you to the parents.  Thanks.  Thinking they had something.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, you wanted a kid, you can have one for like a couple months. 
[03:11:30]  To get real attached to.  He probably taught them a lesson.  Did he teach them something?  Yeah.  That's true.  What do they get taught by this?  Well, it's an inspiration.  It's just inspiration.  For what?  Love what you have.  Plus you get to learn the human experience on a different level.  Do they have some real grotesque scene where he crinkles up and turns brown like Levin  and he's screaming, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, oh God, it hurts.  And then the parents are like, the kids in the theater are screaming. 
[03:12:00]  All the mother wanted to do was hug the kid.  And he's crinkling.  And he crinkles to the ground.  Mommy, it hurts.  Oh, I would see that movie.  That would be hilarious.  At the end, he becomes part of a decoupage.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that sounds horrible.  Terrible movie to take your kid to.  Why would you take your kid to that movie?  Is it a kid movie?  Yeah, it's Disney.  It's a Disney kids movie.  Wow, man.  Crazy.  It's crazy shit right there. 
[03:12:30]  My dad, when he was alive, he used to say he used to hate going to the movies to be sad.  He hated that shit.  I may.  Although he did see The Passion of the Christ because he was into some, oh boy,  some of the older religions.  Yeah, but at least you know.  He studied some of the older religions.  You're not like a kid who's like, oh, I want to see the Magical Forest Boy movie.  And then it's like, yeah, well, he's dead now.  What?  So that leads to this clip of this kid?  Yeah, it was two brothers.  And they were in the backseat of the car.  Their parents took him to see Timothy Green.  They found out that Timothy Green is deceased at the end of the movie. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, man.  And they get all attached to it, kid.  Of course they do.  Like, kids will watch a movie and get really attached to one of the characters in the movie,  you know?  You mean like Buzz Lightyear and Woody?  Yeah.  You hear about that often?  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  Holy shit.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I try.  I try to move him on to something else.  Oh, I try.  You don't want to hear that shit.  You don't want that Lorax shit.  No.  Fuck the Lorax anyway. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah?  It's all about Buzz and Woody.  Stupid.  Buzz and Woody.  If I was Disney, I'd make a Buzz and Woody movie every eight months.  What are you waiting for?  It's automatic cash.  Every parent would have to buy every single fucking movie.  I don't know what they're waiting for.  I don't know why they think the franchise is so important that they wait, what, four or  five years in between movies.  You're stupid.  Your audience is growing up right in front of your eyes.  Let's fucking make these things. 
[03:14:00]  Here's the kids in the back of the car.  What was the movie about?  It was about...  It was about...  It was about to make things going back to Eddie has a...  Going with your point.  They're completely connected to this kid.  They are losing their fucking minds.  Because that's what they want you to be, so it hurts more when he fucking crinkles up  and dies.  Losing their minds.  At least the parents care and they just, you know, put it on video and throw it on the  internet.  Holy shit.  And by the way, you can hear...  I don't know if you can pick it up so much in the audio, but when you're watching the 
[03:14:30]  video, you can hear the parents chuckling.  Of course they are.  At the kids.  Oh yeah, they're laughing.  They're laughing.  Look at this little idiot cry about a dumb movie character.  You know what?  My son ran away crying the other day.  I started laughing hysterically, and my wife yelled at me, and I was like, he doesn't  know I'm laughing.  That was hilarious.  I'd be so pissed if my parents were laughing while I was crying.  I'll have it for tomorrow.  But it was something.  It was hilarious.  You ever get attached to a movie character?  Have I?  Where it...  Well, you got one?  It affected you after you left the movie. 
[03:15:00]  Not like when you're watching the movie, you're like, I have a vested interest in the  character.  I'm watching the movie.  But even after, when you get home, you're just like...  I got yours.  Who?  Rudy?  Rudy?  No.  Rudy?  For me, it was Mark Wahlberg in Rockstar.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah, I could see all that.  No, it wasn't Hitler in Downfall.  You fucking smartasses.  No, I was...  I was in love.  A movie. 
[03:15:30]  Who was he?  A little movie called...  Shut up!  I'm not a quay.  Oh.  Lassie?  No.  Was it Bambi?  It was a girl.  It was a girl.  It was a girl, and it was a movie, and I was totally...  Totally, like, taken...  Give me a hand.  To the point where, after the movie was over, I went home, and I fucking, for days, I was  just like, oh my god, I want her to be my girlfriend.  I know who it was.  I can't...  There's no way to do this.  It was so frustrating.  Kathy Bates in about Schmidt.  Look.  She had nice tits in that movie. 
[03:16:00]  Big and heavy.  No.  She had nice tits in that movie.  No, it wasn't precious.  Was that the movie where she was in the hot tub?  Oh, yeah.  Topless?  Can I see that?  Because those are terrific.  And it wasn't Phoebe Cates in Ridgemont High.  I'm not talking like fucking...  I was a kid.  How old were you?  Let me look.  Charlie Chaplin movie?  I'll look at something.  Don't peek.  Let me see what the year is.  I'm going to guess you were about 10 or 11.  You're probably close.  So that would be 1950...  Oh, wait. 
[03:16:30]  Was it a talkie?  It's a movie from 1958.  I was 12 years old.  Annie?  12, please.  I was 12 years old.  And I was pretty smitten.  Was it a character in a movie?  Oh, the girl singing?  Her?  There's got to be a morning after.  Wait, so...  Was it an action thriller?  No, it wasn't Pippi Longstocking. 
[03:17:00]  Was it an action movie?  No, you wouldn't consider it...  Was it a candy?  ...an action movie.  You could consider it a comedy in some way, shape, or form.  So not as...  People are guessing here like crazy on...  No, it wasn't Alex Bennett.  Very funny, lady balls.  I got it.  I got it.  Do you?  I'm going to put $100 on it.  You really think you got it?  I got it.  Write it down. 
[03:17:30]  Write it down.  I don't know the character.  I know the movie.  Write it down.  Let me see.  You think you know it, huh?  It wasn't Mary Poppins.  Let's see.  Let's see.  I got it.  All right.  I'm very confident.  Opie's very...  So you're very confident.  Oh, yeah.  Is that your final answer?  Oh, yeah.  Opie's very confident.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  Wasn't Sean...  Oh, shit.  I got two answers.  Oh, shit.  Fuck. 
[03:18:00]  Can I have a second answer if I fail?  Uh, no.  Fuck.  No, you can't.  Good.  See?  Payback is the bitch.  All right.  I'm going to write my second answer down just to prove that I didn't have it.  Plus it, Darf's Ratchet.  Ferris Bueller's Girlfriend.  You got to go back further, dummy.  Oh, wait.  It wasn't a...  Oh, never mind.  You said it was sort of a comedy?  Yeah.  My second answer...  Could have been considered a comedy.  I think it's more a comedy than anything else.  Okay.  My second answer, which is off the board, but I want to say it because the people are wondering.  Uh-huh.  The Exorcist.  That's off the table. 
[03:18:30]  Well, let me tell you.  It's off the table.  Well, that isn't the one.  No, I know.  But I was very taken with Linda Blair in that movie.  That's why I had a second answer.  Yes.  My answer is this.  That ain't it.  He's very good.  Oh.  Which one, though?  Very good.  We're looking at American Graffiti, everyone.  American Graffiti.  Yes.  Ron Howard had me.  I was pretty in love. 
[03:19:00]  Wasn't that Harrison Ford in that movie?  He is dreamy.  Wolfman Jack.  Wolfman Jack.  Wolfman Jack.  I've always wanted to be on the radio.  And you're going to be looking at all these...  Oh, it was Mackenzie Phillips there.  No way.  I was totally in love with Mackenzie Phillips from fucking American Graffiti when I was a  kid.  You have a type.  Don't ew me, you prick.  I'll bounce you.  You know what, though? 
[03:19:30]  You got it.  Yuck.  Yeah.  Come on.  What's wrong with you?  All right.  Look.  That's a very bad picture.  She was never hot.  I know, but it was kind of...  I'm not with you on this.  It was American Graffiti.  Don't look at anything past American Graffiti, you fucker.  She was 14 in American Graffiti.  All right.  Don't even look at that.  Who cares?  Oh, but in this case, it's okay because you were young.  Nice.  Look, I can't pour my...  Shut up.  Nice.  Nice, right?  I can't pour my feelings out.  Ooh.  Why hurt?  Hot.  Why hurt, man?  Should we book her?  I liked her little character in that. 
[03:20:00]  You know, she was a spunky, rambunctious girl.  But she looked like a boy in that movie.  Along for the ride.  No, she was fun.  Get some stills from American Graffiti.  Sam keeps pulling up pictures of her from, like, last week.  This is all I can really...  Look.  Come on.  No.  No.  That's rough.  So would it be a Shawnee Smith appearance if she came in here?  Would you be all like...  No, I wouldn't.  Hi, Mackenzie.  No, shut up.  I'm Mackenzie.  All right, look.  I don't know, Ed. 
[03:20:30]  No.  I don't know.  Find a better picture.  I don't think there's one that exists.  I never have thought she was cute, hot, adorable.  Oh, come on.  It was something a little cute and, like...  And everything in between.  Sassy.  It was like one of that whole, you know, they're having some fun.  What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  No one fucking...  I swear, we're looking for one picture where it might be all right.  No, I'm just saying...  You keep going on that fucking picture.  I'm going to smack you in the head.  That's the promotional shot. 
[03:21:00]  That's what she looked like.  No, it was...  Her teeth were too big for her head still.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, your teeth can't be the same size as your eye.  Right.  She finally grew into her teeth.  Look.  All I'm saying is...  Wow.  That's how I felt when I left that fucking movie.  Oh, fair enough.  Fair enough.  Oh, God.  Would you stop pulling...  Sam, he's going, nice.  You've pulled up these pictures of her now.  Going, nice.  Nice.  Would you?  You just can't find the fucking thing.  Would you?  What I would do... 
[03:21:30]  We can't find the one picture.  Hey, hey, shithead.  Here's what you do.  You find out what her character name was in the movie.  Then you put that in Google Images, you fuckwad.  We did that.  Don't get mad at me.  Sam, that's where they're all hiding.  No, he didn't.  Don't get mad at me.  I'm mad at you.  We did that, and pictures of turnips popped up.  I don't even know what that would be.  She's...  She's horrible looking.  Look!  At the time, she was kind of cute in the movie.  And personality goes a long way. 
[03:22:00]  Well, why don't we just watch a clip from the movie?  Look at that pig from Green Acres.  That's one motherfucking charming pig.  That wasn't it!  Well, I did what you said.  That's from One Day at a Time.  Oh.  All right, Ant.  Around the same period?  I'll give you one.  Period.  Ready for this?  Wow.  Perfect.  And I wanted her to be my girlfriend.  Oh, okay.  For real.  Knowing you, it's probably fucking Betty White.  We gotta go.  Oh, God.  Olympics.  Nadia.  Yep.  I want her to be my girlfriend. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, punch us some recent Nadia Comaneach pictures.  And I look at her, even when she was in the Olympics, and I don't know what the fuck I ever  was thinking.  Dr. Steve.  I gotta tell you.  Better than Mackenzie.  Yeah, you kind of got a point there.  But go back to when she was in the Olympics.  Look, she was never good looking.  No, she was a little Romanian.  But just like Anne's saying, it brought back a memory.  I wanted her to be my girlfriend.  Everyone kind of did. 
[03:23:00]  I hear you.  Look, she's horrible looking.  Dr. Steve says, you liked her because she thought Wolfman Jack, and then he puts it  in quotes, was a Negro.  Oh, that's right.  Let's get back to the Timothy Green.  So, the point being, as we get back on track.  Oh, by the way, I'm doing a nut itch right now, legitimately, because it was itching.  And I'm doing the wrong.  Three finger?  It's fucking great.  The thumb of the two fingers?  It's a recall.  Perfect form.  Yeah, yeah.  From earlier in the show.  That's how you do that.  You roll that skin.  You roll that shit.  I'm never going to live that one down, I guess. 
[03:23:30]  What the hell happened?  That's a rough one.  It really is.  Come on.  Worse than Nadia Comaneci.  So, what you're saying is you fall for characters, and you bring them home with you.  And that's why this Timothy Green thing is a little rough.  Oh, really quick also.  My sister fucking lost her mind at Charlotte's Web.  For days, days on end, hysterical crying, like she saw her family wiped out in a car wreck 
[03:24:00]  or a fucking, a train explosion.  She fucking was hysterical crying for days and days about Charlotte.  Is this the one that came out a couple years ago?  No.  No, the animated one from many years ago when Charlotte just kind of lays her head down  on her spidery legs and dies.  It's fucked up when that happens.  She lost her fucking mind.  I remember them coming home from the movies, and my mom was kind of chuckling, but she  was being supportive.  Had her arm around my sister.  Had to walk her into the house because she was collapsing like a fucking black mom at 
[03:24:30]  a funeral.  Hollywood's twisted.  Oh, she lost her fucking mind.  So, this has always been happening, is your point?  I guess so.  Kids can't handle loss.  No.  Everything's been new and exciting.  What do you mean death?  It's all life.  Yeah, Disney's twisted for putting these movies out.  Definitely.  That Up movie where that whole montage of them not having a baby and then getting old is  the worst four minutes of fucking film ever.  Yep.  And it's an animation.  And that's the first scene. 
[03:25:00]  That's the first scene.  People are pissed at the Charlotte's Web spoiler that I threw out there.  Sorry.  Sorry about that, people.  Sorry.  Here we go.  So, let's start over.  The kids reacting to the odd life of Timothy Green.  What was the movie about?  It was about...  It was about...  It was about...  It was about...  It was about Timmy Green going back and he had to die.  And then he had to die.  I didn't want to die.  I remember that. 
[03:25:30]  This is hilarious.  I remember that feeling.  He had to die.  I didn't want to die.  I remember that overwhelming feeling when it hits you for the first time.  Holy fuck.  Everything dies.  What?  This is hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I remember when I had to die.  It is the worst feeling ever.  Well, let me say...  Jesus Christ.  Getting all pissy-eyed in the back seat. 
[03:26:00]  I remember my parents drove away to go to dinner or a movie or something.  I remember it was a rainy day.  I remember the sun was going down.  Man.  And at that moment, I realized, holy shit, I'm going to die.  Oh, no.  And everything I care about will die.  Wow.  And I remember it was the longest three or four hours of my life waiting for them to come back in the house to somehow comfort me.  To unload?  Did you ever read the book Superfudge? 
[03:26:30]  No.  Did you, Travis?  Superfudge.  What's Superfudge?  It's like this kid's book.  You quay bait.  Well, everybody who, I guess, is of a certain generation reads it.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Superfudge.  Sorry.  We had, you know, we had fucking real books.  If I could remember the title of one.  Yeah, but in, like, second grade, I read...  Catcher in the Rye.  We read...  We read Catcher in the Rye.  I read that, too.  Okay.  We read...  I read...  I mentioned Catcher in the Rye.  Superfudge in second grade.  Yeah.  And, like, Fudge is this kid's brother who's very rambunctious. 
[03:27:00]  And that's what the book's about.  But the kid gets a pet turtle.  And the book's about him having this turtle.  Oh, boy.  And in the end of the book, Superfudge eats the turtle.  The fuck is this about?  And they...  It's like a kind of...  It's supposed to be like a goofy thing, I guess.  And they bring Superfudge to the hospital.  And that's when you find out how much the brother cares about Superfudge.  Because he's okay.  Uh-huh.  But I went downstairs into the living room, and I started hysterically crying on my mom's shoulder. 
[03:27:30]  Because the turtle was dead.  Because Superfudge had killed the turtle.  Wow.  And I just...  I was just like these kids.  I was inconsolably hysterically crying.  Oh, Bobby must have loved that.  There's so many ideas for movies.  Why do they have to fucking use that theme?  Gotta knock off things in the fucking...  In the movie.  Marley and Me.  Alan in Alabama.  Oh, I would never watch Marley and Me.  I never saw Marley and Me.  The second I found out the ending of that movie, that's a movie I'll never watch. 
[03:28:00]  Alan?  Way.  Never.  Alan?  Yeah.  I'm here.  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  That movie comes out in the holidays.  So I take my kids and niece and nephews.  We all go.  Because it was just promoted as a cute little dog movie.  Yeah.  I'm going to stop you there.  Thank you, and I want to reiterate that point.  Fucking Hollywood made sure that no one really knew, even though it's tough these days, that  the dog died.  It's like, no, it's just a fun family comedy.  Gotta go to a movie about a goddamn dog dying. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  I'm Casey Case.  So a lot of people were surprised by what the fuck this movie was about.  Oh, kids were being dragged, taken out, just hysterical.  You know?  It was just god-awful.  You know what Jess does?  Come on now, guys.  Yeah.  Poop on the elliptical.  Have you seen dog shaming?  Hilarious.  It's the new thing on the internet.  They put signs near the dogs or around their neck about what they did.  It's like, I pooped next to the fucking elliptical. 
[03:29:00]  And the dogs all look sad.  They got these signs around their neck.  Oh, it's great.  Terrible.  It's hilarious.  On the crying movies thing?  Yeah.  Jess thinks that she likes the movie Click.  You know, the Adam Sandler movie that you've talked about before?  I fucking hate them.  That was a great concept.  And then they had to go all deep and shit.  Well, Jess, every six months, she watches the movie.  She likes it.  Because she thinks she likes the movie.  And I catch her every single time.  I go, oh, okay, put it on.  She bought the DVD. 
[03:29:30]  She has it.  And every time she puts it on, every time she gets halfway through the movie, every time  she starts crying and saying, I forgot this was a sad movie.  Every time.  She thinks it's always just like a fun comedy.  And she forgets every time that there's a horribly sad part.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  I think my dad was right.  Going to movies to be overly sad is just dumb.  What was that horrible movie?  Fucking Lovely Bones?  Was that the one?  Oh, I read the book.  Oh, my God.  I actually read that book, and I remember thinking to myself, why am I reading this? 
[03:30:00]  This is horrific.  It's in the fucking safe.  In a ditch, and they never fucking get her.  No.  She dies.  She's dead, but I mean, they never even find her body.  In the worst way.  Terrible.  In the worst parent's nightmare way.  Fucking terrible.  I remember reading that thing going, what the fuck?  What the?  Horrible.  You're done with the movie.  And I remember I finished watching the movie, and I'm not going to sit there.  I never saw the movie.  I wasn't crying or anything.  But I got up, and I was like, I had to shake it off. 
[03:30:30]  I was like, God, fuck that.  But what?  The horrible feeling.  I had to put on South Park.  I know in the book, they kind of try to twist it and turn it a little bit by, like, she's  dead, but she helps find the killer.  That's what it is in the movie.  It's the same thing as the book, but it's like, the worst part is you don't even fucking...  I read that book, and I didn't know what it was about when I started reading the book,  and then I had this thing about books, I got to finish them.  So then I'm stuck reading this horrific book that I don't want to read. 
[03:31:00]  Wondering why it would even exist as a book to start with.  Yeah.  Because there's so many things you could write about.  Yeah.  And it was a bestseller.  I know there's morbid shit out there, but this was like on the New York Times bestseller list.  Oh, the father's seeing a reflection and fucking see a piece of it.  Oh, horrendous.  Oh, my God.  Terrible.  The champ with Ricky Schroeder.  That was, you know...  The chump.  Wake up, champ.  Oh, no.  Wake up.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's dead.  He's dead.  Anyway, the kid's losing their minds. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  I know, but it's a circle of life.  But it was so sad.  But it was so sad.  It was so sad.  It was so sad.  What about Timothy Green?  All those leaves came off, so he had to go. 
[03:32:00]  I didn't want to go.  Just what?  You wanted him to live forever?  Yeah.  But he had to go.  He had to go.  What's the matter there, Fezzy?  What's up, buddy?  You okay, pal?  You locking up?  What's the matter?  Oh, boy. 
[03:32:30]  Very good, man.  There's a little more to this.  Wow.  I wanted to be on the side of the kids, but this is way too fucking funny.  Were these kids...  Where were they born?  Did they have a dream?  Somewhere?  Baseball.  What?  What do you mean?  I'm 18 years old.  I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Okay. 
[03:33:00]  I thank God the dream came true.  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  Well, back to the kids.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I am lying to go.  I am lying to go.  I love you guys so much.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, so video them.  Yeah, really. 
[03:33:30]  And fucking put them on the internet crying.  Yeah.  I love you guys so much.  All those videos do very well.  You know what they should have done?  The crying kid videos do well.  You know what they should have done right at that point?  Let me tell you a little something about mommy and daddy.  Let me tell you a little something about what's going to happen to mommy and daddy someday.  Oh, shit.  Jeez.  You want to have them go bullshit?  My daddy's gone.  Aw.  Yeah, mine is too.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Son of a bitch.  Mm.  Yeah.  Eight years already.  Jeez.  Time flies.  That was eight years.  That's right.  You missed.  Mm-hmm.  It's been a great eight years, though.  Another 20.  No one will even know.  You know what's good?  You know what's good?  He saw the upswing.  He didn't have to see the old slide back down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[03:34:30]  Well, I want Steve Blatter to know we did two extra minutes of radio.  I hope you appreciate it.  Put it in the bank.  Put it in the bank.  Bank that shit.  So next time you feel like you have to run and get in my face about leaving early, you  understand that we do go past 10 as well.  Hold on.  What did we learn here today?  Anything?  Sam's bit.  Yeah, that's still my bit.  It's our bit.  That's my bit.  You made it your bit?  It's the after show bit.  So what? 
[03:35:00]  Should they call in with that?  Yeah.  Mwah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  I think we did it all.  Above and beyond, motherfuckers.  Now we've been on the air three extra minutes.  Bank it.  Bank it.  Yeah, we're going to start banking time, motherfuckers.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  I think.  What's on the show tomorrow? 
[03:35:30]  Any guests?  Maybe.  Yeah, I know.  Maybe, maybe not.  Oh, I saw a fucking thing on that.  Oh, what the fuck was it?  Oh, the time machine, video time machine app that I got?  Right.  It's really good.  So you get like fucking commercials and TV shows and whatnot from years gone by.  There's a public service announcement against crack by Pee Wee Herman.  Wow.  Crack is bad.  It just sounds so not what Pee Wee should be talking about. 
[03:36:00]  Can we find that for tomorrow?  And you know, it could kill you even the first time you use it.  He's got to use this voice where he talks real low and says, don't do crack, kids.  He can't be like, don't do crack.  Ah, crack.  Ah, crack.  Yeah.  Is this it?  Yeah, there it is.  Hey.  Very traumatic.  This is crack. 
[03:36:30]  Rock cocaine.  It isn't glamorous or cool or kid stuff.  Like jerk it off in the movies.  It's a most addictive kind of cocaine and it can kill you.  What's really bad is nobody knows how much it takes.  So every time you use it, you risk dying.  Conky, how much can I take?  Look, not much Pee Wee. 
[03:37:00]  But doing it with crack isn't just wrong.  You could be dead wrong.  Man.  Wow.  Damn it.  He means business.  Crack.  Four minutes of extra radio today.  Bank it.  Bank it.  Bank it.  You rock.  Start banking our time.  Yeah.  Does this count, though?  Yeah, yeah.  If we're in the air.  As long as the on-air light's on, it counts. 
[03:37:30]  No matter what we're.  Yeah, can you keep the on-air light on until we hit the sidewalk?  Yeah, technically.  All the way until you hit the sidewalk?  Yeah, please.  Union rules.  That's union rules.  So we could bank a few extra minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  We'll do this again tomorrow.  Later.  And then the next day.  And then the next day.  Next day, Saturday.  And the next day.  And the next day.  Five minutes, though.  Hey, this is Pee-wee Herman.  And you are listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XR. 
[03:38:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live with the prime, prime kid himself, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, dig it.  Yeah, dig it.  Wow.  How'd you get Macho Man to do that?  Unbelievable.  We had it for years.  I just forgot it.  Well, I didn't even know.  What did he do?  I thought he was dead before the show even started. 
[03:38:30]  Was he?  Incredible.  I don't know for sure.  That's a hell of a drop.  Can I hear it again?  Sure.  Hang on one second.  That's exciting.  Yeah, you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live with the prime, prime kid himself, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, dig it.  It's the Macho Man.  I mean, who else could it be?  How great is his impression?  Fucking great.  That's awesome.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  People are already calling up.  I guess people learned a lot today.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number. 
[03:39:00]  Nicole, you learned anything today, Sal?  I learned what canoodling was.  You didn't know?  No.  How did you not know what canoodling was?  I just thought it was like a generic term.  For anything?  For just like, you know, cuddling and shit.  For just whatever.  Yeah.  What's this?  Anthony in New Orleans.  Anthony, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Morning, Sam.  Today I learned on the show that the SiriusXM app sucked because I missed the entire first  hour of the show.  Oh, you missed the first hour? 
[03:39:30]  The whole thing.  That was the best hour.  We were talking about how the app didn't work.  Yeah, well, I hope the replay works.  I'm sure it'll work.  We also, thanks Anthony, in that first hour we're talking about Anthony Cumia's ideal black  woman, which basically just sounded like a white woman in blackface.  I mean, he basically just described a stereotypical white woman's body and said if a black woman  had this, then I would probably sleep with a black woman.  He doesn't like, you know, he doesn't like differing from the norm. 
[03:40:00]  He doesn't like going out of his comfort zone, as it were.  I like the conversation about all the crying.  Did you?  I know I'm not.  I just saw a bunch of tweets from other people who read Superfudge.  I didn't realize, though, nobody else shared my affection for the book to the extent that  they cried when they found out the turtle was dead.  What are you doing in there, Iraq? 
[03:40:30]  Fez was in here saying how much he loved the story about that employee that fell into  the window.  Oh, it was so funny.  I don't know if people even, and maybe it was a little long-winded, us trying to figure  out who it was, but you know what?  It was a lot of fun to do that.  You liked it.  You had a good time, Eric.  It's good when we do game shows.  Yeah, it's fun.  It brings the listeners in.  Just for some reason, people falling down is always so fucking funny, especially when  they're your co-workers and adults.  Adults falling down.  Because it doesn't happen.  I don't know his exact age.  I think he qualifies. 
[03:41:00]  Adults falling down is so much funnier than kids falling down, because it's more seldom.  You expect a kid to fall down.  Yeah, kids fall down all the time, and it's funny, but it's not that funny, because you're  like, oh yeah, I've seen it before.  Find something new, or fall off a high place, or something like that.  Like with an adult, when they fall down, even if it's just a stumble, that's hilarious.  I know you don't like cruises and stuff, right?  I mean, I don't know.  I've never been on a real cruise.  I've never been on one.  All right.  But you'll constantly see adults and older adults falling down the stairs when you're 
[03:41:30]  on a cruise.  Because if they were drinking, or if the seas are a little choppy, they just don't know  how to handle themselves, and they'll go tumbling down the stairs.  And the boat's been rocking.  They've been drinking.  Let's see.  Tom, in Illinois, what did you learn?  Almighty primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes.  I learned that Rob Cross is not a total dick after all.  Not yet.  He came through today.  He gave Opie and Anthony both.  He said it.  He made it seem like extra vacation days. 
[03:42:00]  But definitely, I mean, E-Rock's got a big responsibility.  Now he has to go back and find out exactly how many shows both Opie and Anthony took off  this year.  But I have to believe that they just re-read whatever contract or re-went over the days  and just realized that there were more days.  And so they decided to move forward and say, yeah, we're doing you a favor.  You think that's the case at E-Rock?  Uh, I don't know. 
[03:42:30]  You're doing the research?  Yeah.  It seems like they're taking a lot of days?  Not really, no.  Okay, then.  That goes to my theory.  But I think management might be stockpiling their days.  Oh, you mean...  Because O&A don't pay attention?  They might be specifically, knowingly holding...  Like, it may not be a mistake.  They may be knowingly holding the days back.  And then going, here you go.  Extra days.  Look what we did.  And really, they had it.  Very interesting.  And you know what?  In honor of Rob Cross being so cool, I'm going to tweet a photo I found of our friend Rob. 
[03:43:00]  And, okay, Eric's tweeting that out now at E-Rock Radio.  Where did you find this picture?  It was an old issue of Radio and Records, which is a trade magazine.  What were you doing looking at old Radio and Records?  I was looking through some old stuff from the firing of O&A.  I have a bunch of those periodicals and whatnot.  Those periodicals.  Periodicals.  And I was skimming through, and just by chance, one page opened, and I see this picture, and I'm like, oh my god, it's him. 
[03:43:30]  And it was Rob Cross.  So he just happened to be in one of the periodicals that referenced Opie and Anthony being fired?  No, it was something different.  It was about a blackout that happened in New York.  And they were asking him, what did K-Rock do during the blackout?  My vision of you sometimes at home is just going through your piles and piles of radio magazines and just reading about old radio stuff.  I have microfiche machines.  What's microfiche machines?  Okay, this is going to be a generation gap. 
[03:44:00]  Those little, they're like negatives that you would use at the library.  I know micro-machines.  No, those are little cars.  Right.  The guy talks really fast on those commercials.  Yes.  But it would be, it looks almost like an x-ray, and you would put it into the machine, and it would magnify it for you so you could see old newspaper clippings and what have you.  I see it on TV.  And that's how you print them out.  In that movie, Now and Then.  Saw it.  Saw it.  Know what you're talking about.  Sorry, child of the 80s here. 
[03:44:30]  Mark.  A legitimate one?  Yes.  Mark in PA.  Yeah, Sam, what I learned in the first hour, that you could get a black man to sponsor you, and you're able to say the N-word?  No, well, what happens is that, you know, the N-word with the A, not the E-R, the one that's okay, it's okay for black people to use it, and you could get a pass from, like, Who Kid can give Anthony a pass to use the word, sure.  But does that count only if Who Kid is here? 
[03:45:00]  No, he'd given him the pass.  I wish there was a physical card or something that Anthony could show, and that way he could say, no, don't worry, I got a pass.  It has, like, sections you could punch out, like, with a little hole puncher or something.  Yeah, like, maybe if you hang out with Who Kid ten times, you have free range to say the N-word as much as you want.  Yeah, something like that.  Jack in Vermont, what did you learn?  Oh, hey boys, hey, I learned that Opie doesn't see people, but I'm calling bullshit, he's, like, the most superficial mean girl on the show, that's all he's talking about.  He knows what Alex fucking Bennett looks like, you're a bullshit liar, Opie. 
[03:45:30]  How did Opie not know that Alex Bennett was bald and fat?  How did he not know that?  I don't think you can't not notice that.  Exactly, that's his thing.  Oh, who's the bald, fat guy?  Oh, that's Alex Bennett, he does his show.  Oh, cool, you know what I mean?  Like, it's not even if you're, like, that's how he's known.  Whose grandpa's wandering the hall?  Yeah, he's lost and he keeps tripping over things.  Keeps stealing stuff from the bathroom. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  And where's my newspaper?  PV in Maine.  Hey, I learned that Ant might one day take a stab at a black chick.  That's right, as long as she looks like a white chick, he will sleep with a black chick.  James in Kansas.  Hello, Sam.  Hello, James.  I learned today that you want to rob people.  No, yeah, I mean.  Like a black man dying to me.  Hold on, hold on, I'm not done.  For sure.  I would never want to interrupt you.  He wants to rape women, and good old Opie there wants to kill people, which I've seen 
[03:46:30]  that in Opie.  I think he's kind of got it in him.  Yeah, you're not surprised by that.  Oh, fuck no.  All right, thanks, James.  Yeah, I mean, that was an interesting conversation of us.  If we could have one sort of thing that we were allowed to do, what would it be?  And, like, the reason I got on Anthony's case, because he's brought it up before, when  he talks about how, when he's in a dream, he likes to rape people. 
[03:47:00]  And he said, but he's in a dream, so nobody gets hurt and it's okay.  To me, that means that if there were no punishments for it, if it were legally okay, if you could  get away with it, if it was all good, Ant would rape.  Which, I don't think that I would rape people if I could get away with it, because you'd still  have a rape victim, and that would make me feel guilty.  If there was a rape victim who was that because of me, I'd be like, ah, that kind of makes  me feel shitty. 
[03:47:30]  Anthony, though, he's like, yeah, but I gotta get off, so, you know, which is gonna make  me feel more shitty?  Nuts full of cum?  Or, having a couple rape victims under my belt?  I don't know.  For us, for me, it's different than for Ant.  E-Rock, you said, I believe you referenced the wrong...  It was the wrong...  It's not Stir of Echoes, I meant Hollow Man.  Hollow Man, right?  Yeah, I didn't remember what his Invisible Man movie was called, but you want to be  like Kevin Bacon, and you want to become invisible and kill, rape, and rob people?  Hey, if you can do anything in your dream, why not? 
[03:48:00]  Because then you'd have to deal with the fact that you're a murderer and a rapist.  Like, that wouldn't weigh on you?  Well, is one better than the other?  I would...  No, but you don't have to do either.  Well, you might as well double down.  So you're saying, well, if I have to, you know, adjust my morals to make raping okay,  I might as well kill people too.  You know, look through their stuff, see if there's anything I want.  But you wouldn't...  Like, I said I would rob people.  Strong...  Not strong arm, you know, with...  Armed robbery is what I said I would do. 
[03:48:30]  I would get some firearms, and I would rob people.  Like Point Break?  Yeah.  Or, like, just mugging people.  Like, I would...  But I would rob...  Like, I would rob Sal.  Because I would see Sal on the street, and I go, that is a guy that if you stick a gun  in his face and say, give me your money, he's giving you his money.  Right, Sal?  Sal looks like an easy mark, is what you're saying?  Sal looks like.  It doesn't even have to be an easy mark.  But if I came up to you, and I had a shotgun in your face...  Oh, fuck yeah.  And I said, give me all your money.  Yep.  You'd be like, here's all my money.  Here's my watch, whatever else you want.  You have the keys to the car. 
[03:49:00]  If you remember intern Rob, who I want to talk to in a minute, because I found some  interesting stuff about yesterday's events.  But intern Rob said that he got held up once, and somebody said, give me your money, and  he decided to give them his money, his wallet, and his cell phone.  Yeah.  That's what you would do.  Yeah, oh, fuck yeah.  With a shotgun in your face.  Absolutely.  That's the kind of victims I need.  What would you do if you could...  Do anything?  Yeah.  I think it would probably be...  But one thing.  The armed robbery thing.  That thrill of being able to be like, I'll fucking put you down right now. 
[03:49:30]  I might also assault someone.  Like, I would beat someone up bad.  Like, go to the projects.  Use a weapon on them.  Like, I would assault people, but I wouldn't kill.  I don't think I have it in me.  I don't think it's the right thing.  Pirate Trucker in Wisconsin, what did you learn?  Today I learned that you and I have the same anxieties and dreams, only mine always involved  me being drunk and parking my car and can't find it, or being drunk and missing a first 
[03:50:00]  class of every day and realizing it like three months later.  It's weird that in...  Just something in the human brain has everybody having these reoccurring anxiety dreams.  Whatever the thing that gives you anxiety is.  And I sexually...  I went on this whole rant on my Sunday show about how terrible tests were and about how  being a kid in school is the most stressful point of your life.  I guess that's why still now my anxiety dreams go back to being in school.  I'll still have those too.  You do?  That I'll be thinking, oh my god, I have a paper due.  Yeah. 
[03:50:30]  And then I'm like, oh, I gotta run and get it into class on time.  Or sometimes that, oh my god, did I forget I was still in college?  Like, there was a class I was supposed to be going to and I never went to.  Right.  Yeah, I'm the same way.  I know the dream very well.  Tim on Long Island.  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  I didn't learn anything on ONA today because I tuned in at 10 o'clock for the after show.  That's what I'm talking about, Tim.  That's what I'm talking about.  Not that there's anything wrong with ONA, but that's what I'm talking about. 
[03:51:00]  Now, to get to E-Rock's point, I can settle some of your issues here.  If you become a hollow man and you rob a bunch of people, morally wrong, yes, but you're not  going to leave a lifelong impression on them.  You're going to have so much money that you're not going to need to rape bitches because  they're going to come running after you.  Yeah, but E-Rock's already got tons and tons of money.  Yeah, but you don't.  That's true.  That's why I wouldn't mind robbing people.  I would have no moral qualms about...  I wouldn't Bernie Madoff people and take all their savings, but I would rob a bank or 
[03:51:30]  I would rob a person for whatever cash they had in their pocket because they'll be all  right.  You know?  A carjacking maybe, too.  That would be kind of fun.  You don't need to.  You don't need to, though.  If you're a hollow man, you can take money whenever you need it.  You don't need to just go clean somebody out.  You take it when you need it.  Yeah, but I don't know if I'd be able to be invisible.  I didn't realize we were doing superpowers.  But I think E-Rock's saying that he would be an invisible guy that rapes and kills the  way Ant would be a flying guy who rapes.  Sometimes it's not about the money. 
[03:52:00]  It's the thrill of the hunt.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  So weird.  Kevin in South Carolina.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, buddy?  Today I learned that Anthony has a homely girl fetish.  What's that based on?  American Graffiti.  I was thinking he was like all hot for Suzanne Somers and he comes out with Mackenzie Phillips.  Yeah, I really thought it was anybody but Mackenzie Phillips in that movie.  That was a big curveball there.  I was surprised.  Have a good one.  See ya.  Mackenzie Phillips in that movie has similar features to the gymnast that Ant likes. 
[03:52:30]  Maybe.  Okay.  Interesting theory.  So you're saying Ant, like, he developed his type when he was about 12 years old and hasn't  moved on in age or physical appearance.  Don in Virginia?  Yeah.  My thing would be if, you know, people walk in front of you, you know, and when you're  driving and they just look at you and they shake, they do their head bop and they say, 
[03:53:00]  I'm not going to walk any faster.  You know, you're going to have to wait.  I just want to be able to run them down.  You would like hit and run to be your thing?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  The ones that are walking in front of you, they look at you and then they like snap their  head back and forth and I'm not going to walk no faster.  And then you just run them over?  Oh, yeah, you just nail them.  Good.  That's not a bad one, Don.  That's actually a pretty good one.  My favorite scenario would be, since everybody's got an individual one, is the cops coming to 
[03:53:30]  arrest you and you being like, no, no, hit and runs are my thing.  Or I'd be like, don't worry, don't worry, cops.  I'm allowed to rob this bank.  Robbing is my thing.  Like, that's what I picked.  If everybody got to pick one, we wouldn't change the laws.  It's just everybody has a thing that they get to do.  It might be fun.  Let's see.  Tom in Boston.  Hey, I was interested to know what Troy Kwan's thoughts are, but at the end of the  Ron and Fez show yesterday when it was discussed that Troy Kwan is Fez's new love interest on 
[03:54:00]  the show.  What?  I didn't hear this.  Eric, did you hear about this?  No.  I'm looking.  I'm going to go look for it.  Okay, see if you can find it.  What did he say, Tom?  I was talking about, he didn't mention Troy by name at first, but then he was talking  about, um, he likes a certain someone on the staff that just recently changed his hairstyle.  Oh no, are you fucking around or are you serious?  I fucking swear to God, dude.  Oh my God, Tom.  Thank you.  And Troy decided today is the day he's going to wear his pink and purple shirt, by the 
[03:54:30]  way.  Um, did you hear Tom's call just now?  A little bit of it.  Yeah.  Did you hear about this?  No, people were tweeting me yesterday, but they did this before, too.  Fez has a thing for you?  I didn't know that.  Well, what did they do before?  I didn't think he ever said who it was.  Well, you said it's somebody on the ONA staff who's changed his look.  Oh.  I don't know.  I mean, who else is it?  I don't know.  Sal's still wearing V-necks.  I still got my hair tied back in a puff.  I don't know who else it is. 
[03:55:00]  Iraq's still...  Yeah, he never said me, so I don't know.  What if it is you?  I don't know.  Are you flattered?  Does it make things a little awkward?  A little bit.  It does.  It makes things a little weird?  Yeah, but there's...  It's happened before.  Gay guys coming on to you?  Yeah.  You like that, though?  Yeah.  You enjoy it?  No, no.  I mean, it's flattering.  Sure.  But never in the workplace.  No, they have in the workplace.  Like who?  I'm not going to say.  In this workplace?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  When?  Before. 
[03:55:30]  Like, how long before?  How long ago?  When was the last one?  How long ago?  Uh, maybe like...  Well, there was an intern here who...  Somebody had said something about me before.  How long ago was it?  Uh, like...  Like a year and a half ago.  Why wouldn't you share this information with us?  I knew you a year and a half ago.  Because it's just one of those things you just kind of like...  No, I want to know.  No.  I'm very...  What are you going to do with that information?  I want to know it.  Like, I want to hold it.  I love information.  You know that.  I love information.  Yeah, but it's...  I don't want that on the air.  I don't want to call that person on the air. 
[03:56:00]  But there's lots of stuff I know about you that's not on the air.  I just want the info.  Oh, okay.  You know...  I mean, I didn't really think it was that big of a deal.  It is.  No.  Can you hook me up with that next time?  What, the info?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, bro.  I appreciate that.  I'll tell you off the air.  I just don't want it on the air.  I don't think it's appropriate on the air.  No, no, no.  I get that because it's an intern and blah, blah, blah.  The Fez thing is different, though.  Yeah, but that's not even...  It's not even saying it's me, so...  I mean, if this...  If Tom in Boston and E-Rock is looking through this stuff right now, I would like to find out.  Give me one second.  I think I found it.  Okay, great.  In the meantime, I'll tell you about Steven Singer.  By the way, Steven Singer supports same-sex unions, so that could be good for you and Fez, Troy. 
[03:56:30]  I don't know for sure.  I'm not saying it will be, but I am also saying that we don't know the future, do we?  I guess not.  No.  Nobody knows the future.  Let me tell you about Steven Singer and Steven Singer Jewelers.  Is there anyone better out there for diamonds than Steven Singer Jewelers?  I think I can answer that question.  No.  Nobody's even close.  In fact, Steven is the best place to buy your diamond in America.  It's absolutely the only place to go for your engagement ring.

How you doing?  Um, you were talking earlier about, like, why you wouldn't rape somebody or physically strong-arm somebody. 
[03:58:00]  Let's be honest, Sam.  Yeah.  I got a sister.  You tried to rape her.  She kicked to your ass.  Yeah, I'm probably not...  You're not a very physically intimidating person, Sam.  You're probably right about that, Snowy.  I don't know if I'm physically capable.  I think there are more women who are physically capable of raping me than I am physically capable of raping them.  Now, if you had a gun or a knife or something like that, you know, maybe, you know, obviously you could do something then.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't get me wrong.  No, I get it.  It's a physical thing.  It's just, I mean, it's a God-given physicality that I simply was not blessed with. 
[03:58:30]  And that's actually good, not to actually have dreams of raping people.  I mean, that's a little disturbing.  I mean, I like the end.  I don't agree with him as politics.  He's a great guy.  I mean, that's a good part of flying and raping people?  Jesus.  All right, thanks, Snowy.  Have a good one, guys.  Oh, Snowy's always good for one.  Somebody else, I wanted to pick him up, was calling up and saying I should do the What Did You Learns at the end of After ONA Live.  But there's two reasons.  Let me break this down for you because we'd go inside with After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:59:00]  That's the purpose of the show.  Number one, you got to do What Did You Learn while the Opie and Anthony show is still fresh in everybody's brain.  If I wait until 10.45 to do it, everybody's forgotten about ONA and they're sitting here calling and telling me what I did 20 minutes ago.  Number two, let's be honest.  The after show doesn't pick up until 20 minutes into it.  It's the last half of the after show that's the must-listen-to shit, usually.  So, What Did You Learn is just kind of like a little appetizer.  It gets us in.  It's a transitioning. 
[03:59:30]  Right.  It gets the motor rolling.  It's transitioning from ONA to after ONA.  It's what it is.  Eric, did you find that clip?  I found a clip towards the end of the show.  Is it what Tom or whatever his name was from Boston was talking about?  They're talking about a producer.  It seems like it's Troy.  They don't mention him by name.  Look, I'm going to tell you something.  If a gay man has a crush on any producer on the Opie and Anthony show, I'm sorry, Sal.  It's Troy.  You know?  I don't think there's any sort of way.  Do you think a gay guy is ever going to be like, oh, Sam and E-Rock are very handsome 
[04:00:00]  guys.  I think E-Rock and me and Travis and Danny, we're not...  Yeah, but why not?  We're not...  For the same reason girls don't say, oh, we'd really like to fuck those guys.  Yeah, but everybody you just mentioned has a personality, a funny personality.  So, a lot of times, that's attractive to people.  It doesn't necessarily...  But you know what?  A lot of times, a certain percentage of times, that's attractive to people.  You know what's attractive to people 100% of the times? 
[04:00:30]  Good looks.  Yeah, but you've never seen a girl that was like, eh, whatever, and then she's funny and  she's cool and you can just hang her like, oh, you start looking at her differently?  That's never happened to you?  Listen.  Most people are deep.  Let's go around the room and see who we're dating.  How many people around here are dating people that are uglier than they are?  How many people are dating uglier people than...  The girls that they're with.  How many of us are dating hotter girls than us?  All of us, I would say.  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Alright, so.  Just because we tricked some girls into dating us doesn't mean we would do the same thing  back. 
[04:01:00]  Let me hear this clip.  Alright, it's about a minute.  Okay.  But I always like it, like, if there's a guy that I'm interested in or that I find attractive  and, like, all of a sudden, he'll change up his hair because it's such a rare thing  for a guy and, like, maybe instead of, like, you know, he'll change the part in it or something  like that.  I'm sorry.  I was so fucking bored.  I thought there was going to be a gay thing.  Give us an example when that happened. 
[04:01:30]  Did that ONA producer ever fucking change his part?  Oh, God.  Or is that still...  We never let on to that.  We never let on to that, but yeah, that is an example of that.  He changed his hair?  Yeah.  It was long for a while and then went short and I thought it was so hot afterwards.  Oh, my God.  Disgusting.  I'm not even talking about cock and balls.  About somebody's hair.  I'm talking about a haircut. 
[04:02:00]  Dude, it's totally you.  100%.  That didn't describe anything.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Hey, Ron and Fez intern, come here for a second.  We just listened to a clip from Ron and Fez yesterday.  Were you here yesterday?  Yeah, I was here yesterday.  You were listening to Fez talk about the ONA producer he likes?  It's totally Troy, right?  Yeah.  It's definitely Troy, isn't it?  Based on what Fez said on the air.  I'm not asking you for the inside.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, my God.  The one who recently parted his hair in a different way. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Troy.  Congratulations, Troy.  For being the hottest guy on the ONA staff.  Hey, man.  That's not it.  You don't know.  We don't know.  And you know what?  Fez is awesome, by the way.  He is.  I talk to him all the time.  We talk about wrestling.  We talk about whatever.  And maybe this is like, you know, you think about dating inside the virus family for a  change.  Why not?  I'm not attracted to men.  You aren't.  No.  I've always thought that you were someone, but just not 100%. 
[04:03:00]  I've never been attracted to, sexually attracted to a man.  Not one.  There's never been one man you're like, actually, he's kind of hot.  I've never looked at a man and thought to myself, I need to enter them.  What about have them enter you?  No.  Never?  Nope.  Okay.  I don't mind a bitch putting a going first knuckle.  A man?  Bitch.  Girl.  Female.  Oh, I thought you meant like a feminine guy.  Nope.  There's just nothing, nothing is attractive to a man, physically, to me.  There's nothing about a hairy ass.  Would you let a guy blow you? 
[04:03:30]  No.  Why have you shut your eyes?  No.  What if he had a big fez beard?  No.  No.  I had a friend do that for crack once.  Let a guy blow him?  Yeah.  And he was a straight guy.  But he needed a crack.  And he was the one who was getting blown anyway.  And he said that if you just close your eyes, it just feels the same.  Does it?  I don't know.  I've never done it.  That was a test.  You passed.  Great job, buddy.  Great job.  Real quick.  With this guy who was just on the phone.  What's up, Jack?  Hey, first of all, Sam, you misunderstood me.  Number one, I don't know how to make your show any better, but I believe if you allocate 
[04:04:00]  the last five or ten minutes of your show to what did we learn on the Sam Roberts show,  you're going to throw everything into a smaller microcosm.  And number two, with all that love of cum that Troy used to talk about, no wonder Ferris  feels the way he does.  You did say how much you like to eat cum.  No.  No.  I thought so.  Maybe the facts are...  No, I didn't like to eat cum.  I was with a girl who wanted to snowball, and I said, fine, I'll give it a shot.  And she was hot enough, and you agreed that she was...  She was hot, definitely hot enough.  Oh, I'm just getting instant feedback from Dave in Chattanooga, who says Alex Bennett's 
[04:04:30]  Wikipedia has been updated with the incident.  All kinds of you, Iraq.  That was not us.  We did not do that.  I want to talk to you, Iraq.  How much...  What does it say, Sal?  On August 23, 2012, it was revealed that Alex accidentally tripped over wiring on the  floor at SiriusXM and fell into a window face first.  Hilarity ensued.  Can I tell you how powerful this show is?  You know, Carly Rae Jepsen's Wikipedia still says that that song was made famous on After 
[04:05:00]  Opin' Anthony Live?  Really?  100%.  I didn't even know that happened.  To the point where somebody, one of my friends from high school, who doesn't listen to the  show, messaged me on Facebook saying, I figured you must have had something to do with this.  That's great.  Yeah.  Is Roland around?  I haven't seen him.  Of course you haven't seen him.  He's hiding.  Get Robin here real quick.  It's his last day.  Well, I'm not going to be here tomorrow, so it's my last day with him.  I don't know if you know this, Troy.  I'm not going to be here tomorrow or all of next week.  I know.  It's a bummer.  Because I'm going on my honeymoon. 
[04:05:30]  Well, that's nice for you.  Yeah, I know.  But I get super anxiety.  I hate missing shows.  Yeah?  Honestly.  You should do it on Skype.  You think so?  Yeah.  It would work?  I'm sure your fiancé, your wife now would love that.  Yeah.  Apparently with Jess, it's all like, oh, you put your work before the relationship.  What do you mean you don't want to go on a honeymoon?  I don't know what that's all about.  Wouldn't that be great to do it on the beach, though?  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  I'm at the beach.  I don't even know what ONA talked about today.  Rob.  Yes.  Yesterday, you saved your internship by dressing up in a pig suit, throwing Monopoly money in 
[04:06:00]  the air, handing out Egg McMuffins and saying, I'm nagling it in this bitch, correct?  Yes, that is correct.  You told me that was your idea.  Yeah.  That was a lie.  Well, yeah.  You lied to me when you said that was your idea.  It wasn't because...  Troy, I found out whose idea it was.  It was not yours, by the way, Troy.  No, and I'm getting blamed for this, too.  No.  It's because somebody whose idea it was likes to blame other people when he gets caught.  It wasn't Troy.  Wait, Rob lied?  Rob lied again.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  It wasn't Troy.  Rob, who gave...  And, Eric, this is going to hurt you.  Who gave you the idea to dress up like that pig? 
[04:06:30]  I know who it was, so you might as well...  Roland.  Aww.  Is that true?  It is.  Eric, did you know this?  I alluded to it yesterday before I left.  Did you realize...  I found out late in the day.  How does that make you feel?  Are you more upset about it, or you don't care?  No, it's...  It's not even disappointing.  It's...  It's...  I don't even know.  It's...  Ugh.  It was very aggravating. 
[04:07:00]  You're pissed at Roland?  Um, I was very upset about it, yeah.  Are you okay now?  Um, him and I talked.  But why would you even be surprised?  Like, Roland puts ketchup on your computer.  That's true.  He has put ketchup on your computer.  Wait, so have you.  Me?  I haven't.  I've never done that.  No, not you, Sam.  No, I haven't put ketchup on your computer.  French fries, chicken nuggets, salt packets.  Eric, I've eaten at your desk, and maybe there's been some crumbs. 
[04:07:30]  But beyond that, I don't know.  But, I couldn't believe...  I looked at him when he told me that, because he's the one who told me.  And I was like, you went on the after show yesterday,  and you started giving E-Rock shit, because you were in a bad mood,  and you acted like you didn't know anything about the pig outfit,  and it was your idea.  I didn't want to throw him under the bus.  Yeah.  And you knew it was Roland's idea, Troy,  because you were in the room, correct, when Roland had this idea?  No, I was not.  Oh, that's not the picture Roland paints.  No, I was not.  No, Rob had come in, and I had said...  And what I told him off the air was actually said on the after show. 
[04:08:00]  I said, why don't you bring the guys breakfast,  or find a girl to come in and get naked for them?  That's what I said on the air.  And then I told him that same thing off the air,  and then the discussion that they had was down in Roland's office.  Wow.  He's not picking up.  So you're saying it was 100% Roland?  I'm not going 100%.  Aside from you?  Yeah.  Like, it was between Troy and Roland.  How much percent of the blame does Troy get, we'll say?  None. 
[04:08:30]  Zero percent.  Yeah.  How much percent of the blame do you get?  Some.  For coming up with the idea?  We were like...  What percent?  Because the way I heard it,  you only came up with the Egg McMuffin part.  Yeah.  So a small percent.  Yeah.  Roland came up with the pig part,  and with the money part.  Yes.  That was the insult.  Eric, you'll agree with me.  That was the insulting part.  Very much so.  The pig part and the money part. 
[04:09:00]  Like, the Egg McMuffin part, I'm assuming,  didn't really bother you as much.  No, all of it was just...  It was all shitty.  But if Rob had just come in and handed out Egg McMuffins,  you probably wouldn't have taken it personally.  No, it would have been like,  that is a really stupid thing.  Yeah.  Rob did say he was going to frost his tips like Eric had.  Whose idea was that?  That was mine.  Well, everybody's got ideas.  Because, unfortunately, we've got to go.  Troy, I need to put you on call for something.  Okay.  I need you to make sure that Roland is called on this. 
[04:09:30]  Because this is the last time I'm here until next...  Until after Labor Day.  Well, the guys may not bring it up tomorrow, though.  Well, if there's...  Whoever...  If they make...  If they have Danny or Travis hosting the after show,  you better be in here and being like,  yo, guys, you've got to talk about this.  Right.  Because, you know what I mean?  But they're not going to call him out like you would call Roland out.  All right.  Listen.  You call him out, then.  Because you'll do it, too.  We've got to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Be listening, Troy.  And we'll be back...  Well, I don't know what's going to happen, 
[04:10:00]  but I'll be back after Labor Day.  Thank you all for your continued support.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
