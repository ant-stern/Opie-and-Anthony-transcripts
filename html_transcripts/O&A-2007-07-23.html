<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-deprecating montage highlighting their infamous reputation, followed by a recounting of their six-hour traffic nightmare returning to New York from a comedy tour in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  They detailed the frustrating hotel checkout process and briefly mentioned Imus's birthday.  Anthony then dominated the conversation with tales of his wild night at Mohegan Sun casino, where he won $100,000 playing blackjack. He described his opulent treatment by the casino, including an offer of a private jet, and recounted humorous and uncomfortable moments stemming from a severe hangover, including repeated vomiting. Opie expressed concern over Anthony's excessive gambling and drinking.  Listener calls followed, offering congratulations on the Mansfield show; one caller won a "100 grand" candy bar. The hosts discussed audience reactions to videos played during the show (including Pat Duffy and Baby Bird videos), dealing with enthusiastic (and unruly) fans, and upcoming shows in Detroit (near casinos).  They also touched upon recurring show characters and comedians who performed with them. The show concluded this segment by discussing and adjusting their weekly show themes.

The next segment addressed the recent death of Tammy Faye Bakker, the hosts' Friday segment mocking her Larry King appearance, and the resulting listener backlash.  They discussed Barry Bonds' home run record, expressing apathy towards his steroid use.  A significant portion mocked CW11 news coverage, focusing on bizarre video selections (bikini-clad lawnmowers, a Scotty museum). The box office success of "Chuck and Larry" despite poor reviews was attributed to effective marketing and audience disregard for critics.  The hosts critiqued the perceived over-sensitivity of American media compared to shows like The Simpsons, and discussed the influence of special interest groups on Hollywood. A listener detailed his experience at the Bunny Ranch (previously gifted as a Father's Day prize), describing interactions with women in the limousine and at the ranch.  Clips of their Tammy Faye Bakker bit were played.  There were brief mentions of a fan being removed from a show and a listener requesting financial aid.

A caller named "Bear" then recounted his Bunny Ranch experience in graphic detail, describing the amenities, interactions with the women, and multiple sexual encounters. He mentioned his estranged wife and how the trip contrasted with his current relationship.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit humor throughout.  The conversation shifted to Jim Norton's successful book and its sales compared to the new Harry Potter book.  The hosts engaged in crude and offensive jokes about Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling, and the series. Anthony's casino winnings were initially presented as real before being revealed as a bit.  The show promoted a "What the Hell is That?" segment and further vulgar discussion of Harry Potter ensued, with Jim Norton's active participation.

This Harry Potter discussion continued with a caller correcting the hosts' inaccurate knowledge, leading to a comedic, vulgar exchange inventing obscene character names.  The Quidditch sport served as a springboard for further inappropriate jokes.  The show then discussed a Washington D.C. compliment box, criticizing its inanity, and brainstorming their own offensive version.  Listener calls followed, with one caller sharing his father-in-law's religious objection to Harry Potter and another providing vulgar wizard names for the show's staff.  A news story about a model falling on a runway was played repeatedly, followed by discussion of a man accused of pimping disabled women, all laced with vulgar commentary.  The segment ended with discussion of ringtones and a plan to leave early disguised as a pre-recorded bit, along with mention of a "Big A Appreciation Day" and speculation about his future with the show.

The final segment heavily featured the creation and distribution of offensive ringtones, with the hosts brainstorming numerous vulgar suggestions. They encouraged listeners to download and secretly place them on their wives'/girlfriends' phones.  A significant portion focused on a phone conversation with Big A (from the Ron and Fez show), who was in studio recovering from surgery. The conversation revolved around Big A potentially joining the Opie and Anthony show, including discussions of his potential role and comparisons to their dynamic.  The hosts expressed frustration with audio clips provided by Pitsy (from Ron and Fez), insulting him repeatedly and giving him the nicknames "Shitsy" and "Klitsy." Big A performed sound effects and impressions.  More ringtone suggestions were offered, along with discussion of upcoming events (a book signing) and the show schedule.  A caller, Flea Man, provided more offensive ringtone ideas, leading to further insults. The segment ended with a final insult toward Ron and Fez.

[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Any other medium have to be nice.  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot, shot, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Shot, shot.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot, shot, Opie and Anthony.  Shot, shot.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  It's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell.  Smell.  Oh, oh!  Yeah!  This is where entertainment is going.  So you've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot.  Twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  Opie and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off of your skin.  Of the icing off, so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[00:01:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Get the show off the road.  Back in the studio.  Oh, my God.  Wow, that was a long weekend.  Was it a weekend?  I don't know what that was. 
[00:01:30]  I don't know what that was.  It was a lot of fun.  I'll tell you that.  I guess we had yesterday off.  No.  But that was a travel day to get back to New York so we could do the radio show today.  To me, six hours in traffic isn't an off day.  You had six hours in traffic?  Oh, it was ridiculous.  Well, Keith drove.  I just kind of tried to sleep in the back.  And then I popped in some movies.  And we were like, it had to be 50 miles outside of New York. 
[00:02:00]  And I'm like, you know something?  I'm going to pop in X-Men.  By the time it's over, I'll be home.  Watch the entire movie.  Not home yet.  Not even close, right?  No, no.  Still like going through parts of New York.  Just amazing the traffic you get on a Sunday like that.  I got my crew up early.  I'm like, no way are we dealing with this I-95 traffic crap on a Sunday.  But it is.  So I was like, we didn't sleep in and we got out of there. 
[00:02:30]  And it still took four hours for us.  I had to sleep in.  That was actually, I didn't even check out.  Didn't even like slink out of the hotel until 2.30 in the afternoon.  Oh, my God.  Got out just as the get the F out of there guy was knocking on all the doors.  Right, right.  And we kind of just slipped out.  It's funny.  They had patience for a while.  And then eventually it's like, yeah, get the F out.  When the phone rings, you don't answer.  You're just throwing crap in your bag trying to pack and get out of there. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no.  They're on time.  That was pretty much it.  Get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Oh, before we go any further.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, Mr. Imus.  Really?  Happy birthday to you.  The I-Man is being reported on the news.  67 years old.  Yikes.  You think they're lying about his age?  Nah, that's about right.  67?  That's about right. 
[00:03:30]  You're getting off a zero.  Yeah.  Well, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Of course, we're talking about our trip back from Mansfield, Massachusetts.  Yep.  Nowhere's near Boston, Massachusetts.  Southwest of Boston.  Yeah.  Because the mayor's still holding a grudge up there for some reason 10 years later.  Won't let us have a show in Boston proper.  He's had some issues in the last 10 years.  As far as he has.  And people had to kind of like look the other way and go, okay, you're still our mayor. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  We forgive you, but for some reason he doesn't want to ever forgive us.  Yeah.  Don't let Opie and Anthony back in, but you know, so big metal plates fall on cars and  kill people.  We forgive you.  With their big dig.  You could still be the mayor.  Yeah.  All kinds of corruption and money going places for this big dig, way over budget, things  like that, but eh, you're all right.  Just make sure O&A don't come back for a road show.  I like that Mansfield though. 
[00:04:30]  I don't like Mansfield itself.  I like the Twitter center in Mansfield.  That's a great place to do a show.  And the comedy show was amazing on Saturday night.  Mansfield could be the worst town in the country.  There's nowhere to go.  I got up early yesterday.  I'm like, I just want to get some, something to eat, some papers.  I'm just traveling down.  There's nothing there.  I went left.  I went right.  I went, I went everywhere.  Here's how stupid I am.  I'm going, wow.  The Twitter center.  I go, this place looks just like great woods.  It used to be. 
[00:05:00]  I had, dude, I had no idea.  I'm just doing that for the radio audience.  I know.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  We did a million shows.  A million shows we were there for.  We did rage against the machine.  I mean, I had no clue.  We could name a million shows.  The river raves over the years.  I'm walking around going, yeah, boy, there was a place like this.  I think it was called great woods.  It looks very similar.  What a tool.  They're changing the names of everything.  Did you see on the way home through Providence that one of the arenas there is called the Dunkin' 
[00:05:30]  Donuts Center and they're using the awful Dunkin' Donuts like colors.  Ew.  Hey, they might be a great company, but those colors are just awful.  Yeah.  All over the arena.  They're just meant for donuts.  Yeah, it just doesn't look right.  An arena.  We stopped in Rhode Island there and stopped at a Denny's to get something really quick  and get out of there.  And just, well, there's a big lesbian population.  Oh, Rhode Island's very gay.  You didn't know?  Oh, no, I knew that.  Rhode Island?  But it was, yeah.  Huh. 
[00:06:00]  Wow.  Because it was just.  Maybe the WNBA was in town or something.  Maybe.  Maybe that's what was going on.  It was just big, I mean, big burly lesbians.  Not lipstick lesbians.  Big burly lesbians coming in and ordering their, you know, Grand Slam.  Give me a Grand Slam.  With extra tacos.  Yeah.  That's great.  So, the show was just a massive success.  Everyone had a great time.  Oh, man.  The feedback I got, the emails, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:06:30]  Unbelievable.  The Village was really cool.  Yeah, the Village was really good this time around, the ONA Village.  A lot of stuff.  We're starting to get that in shape, which is nice, considering the tour's half over  for this summer.  We got four more to go.  Yeah.  Wow, the masked people, though.  People from Massachusetts.  Hardcore.  People that came from Boston.  Hardcore fans.  So good to get up there and actually see it.  You know, we hear it on the phones and see it in the emails and stuff like that.  But to get up there and actually see how cool these people are with the show, it's amazing. 
[00:07:00]  Just amazing.  You know, it's weird, too, because Boston, for the most part, doesn't like New Yorkers.  Uh-huh.  And we're going around the parking lot, and it's just, I got, I was intimidated.  Nothing but Patriots and Red Sox.  Oh, Red Sox gear, yeah.  You know, hats and jerseys and shirts.  Yep.  And just loving the show.  And I'm like, man, something here doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  But really, really cool.  Really cool.  Yeah.  We and Kenny left with Vos, like, we left on the Saturday night after, because I just,  I'm like, I can't wake up and have to drive in traffic. 
[00:07:30]  I think under three and a half hours.  Oh, you did.  Oh, we zipped home.  But we kept worrying about Kenny falling asleep.  Yeah, that was like the big issue when we were driving back to the hotel was like, Kenny's  really tired.  Now, he could just nod off.  And Opes had experience.  He goes, just watch out, because he'll tell you he's okay, but then you'll look, and it's  got, you know, that look we always talk about on the airplane?  Yeah.  Where his mouth opens up and his eyes shut.  Yeah.  That's what he does.  His eyelids get really heavy.  And Kenny doesn't want to ever show any weakness.  No.  So he'll drive into a pole before he admits he's tired. 
[00:08:00]  I'm fine.  And I remember coming home, I think it was from Boston, and we're on, where were we?  The Hutch or whatever, like it matters to the rest of America.  And all of a sudden, I look over, and his eyelids are getting really heavy.  And he's like, no, I'm okay.  And he's trying to keep his eyes open, like he's opening them real wide and stuff.  And finally, he had to admit weakness to me.  He finally had to admit it.  I'm like, okay, if you don't mind, maybe you could drive for 45 minutes.  He admitted weakness.  Wow.  He never admits a weakness.  Rather throw himself on a sword.  Oh, yeah.  He's like a cyborg. 
[00:08:30]  Well, he actually, he did the same thing with us, too.  We were driving, and I kept trying to talk to him about anything.  I didn't want to keep saying, you okay?  You okay?  So I'm like, you all right?  And he's like, yeah, I'm fine.  And he was okay.  So then I kept having conversations with him, and he seemed to be getting sluggish.  And Voss was actually wide awake.  So Kenny pulled into a rest area and admitted he was gay.  Wow.  Who saw that coming?  We were shocked.  And then he drove on.  Yeah.  And then stupid Voss drove. 
[00:09:00]  Speaking of okay, I can't even tell you how many people.  Is he okay?  So you got to, like, tell everyone what the hell happened.  Oh, my God.  I'm fine.  I was severely hungover.  You probably should call Bob Saget.  Yeah.  He's like, wow, that's not right.  That's not right.  That's not right.  Is he all right?  Is he all right?  He only saw me laying down on the couch in the dressing room.  For the most part, that was it.  He was more concerned, but so many people, is he all right?  Is he all right?  So you should just get it out of the way. 
[00:09:30]  I had probably one of my top ten hangovers of all time.  It was so utterly bad that when we were driving through the parking lot, it was like, okay,  first thing, I just go, get me to the dressing room immediately.  And I'm just drinking water.  I'm trying to drink water and lay down.  And the great part was we had to walk through the catering section to get into the dressing room.  So all I'm smelling is thick, heavy food. 
[00:10:00]  And it just, it made me so, so queasy again.  So I just wanted to lay down.  So I lay down.  And then, uh, but you're, you're like blown off like chunks of the story.  You got to explain what happened on Friday.  Well, I'll get to that.  I just want to explain why I was, you know, such a wreck at the show.  So, uh, I lay down and I hear five minutes.  We're going out into the parking lot in the golf carts to, uh, you know, cruise the, uh,  the tailgating.  And I'm like, oh my God, I can't do this. 
[00:10:30]  I can't, but I have to, you know, I'm a trooper for our fans.  So I get in the golf cart.  I got my little water and I put my game face on.  I'm like, Hey, and I'm, I'm, I'm slapping hands.  Everything's cool.  I'm taking pictures.  And then we stop at that one big truck, the big display that was out there.  The score from Providence.  The score.  And I get out and now I'm taking pictures with people.  And you know, when you take a lot of pictures, you're moving your head around a lot and your  eyes to make contact with the lens that is taking the shot. 
[00:11:00]  And I was so hung over that your eyes, like your brain didn't follow your eyes.  Brain didn't follow my eyes.  It was like flares.  Things were blurry.  My eye hurt.  Half of the pictures people have is me with one eye shut.  I just had to shut one eye.  Like, you know what?  Like the sun is in your eye, but it was like, it was because I had this, this stabbing pain  in the side of my head.  And I, I, Keith, the cop was there.  So I go, I go, Keith, I got a boof, man.  I really do.  So we look and there's Port-A-Johns sitting on the side and they hadn't been used yet. 
[00:11:30]  Thank God.  At least the one I went into.  So I do this slow, casual walk because I don't want people wondering why is Anthony sprinting  for a Port-A-John.  So I do the casual walk and in my head, I'm going, am I going to make it or am I going  to puke right here?  And there's going to be a great picture of me just open mouth puking in the parking lot.  But I made it right when I made it in, whap, just like gallons of water were coming out.  Gallons of water.  And then, you know, I clean up and then came back out and hey, more pictures. 
[00:12:00]  So people have the pre and post puke pictures of me by the score truck.  You should have just done it right there in the lot, man.  Dude, that would have been the best shot ever that people would, dude, here it is, Anthony  puking.  You just ralphed right there in front of everybody.  That was my third puking since like eight, about nine o'clock that morning.  And then driving to the hotel, I had a woof from Mohegan Sun because that's what the story 
[00:12:30]  goes from.  I stopped at Mohegan Sun.  And I go, I go, Keith, pull over.  Pull over right now.  So he just pulls off the road.  I get out behind my truck and start woofing.  And I'm just looking for the smart ass to put it in reverse because now I got a camera  in the back of my truck just in case, you know, you're backing up and you don't want  to back anything over anything.  And I'm just waiting.  And he said, I was going to do it, but I knew you'd see the backup lights.  I go, if you did that, I would have puked right on the camera just as a gag. 
[00:13:00]  Could you see you watching me vomit?  And then just a big projectile vomit goes on the screen.  So I was in really bad shape.  People have pictures of me going, what was wrong with Anthony?  He didn't even get out of the golf cart.  I got out a couple of times, but I was in such bad shape.  Went back to the dressing room, crapped out.  But that was all because of Friday.  Friday, left the show, decided, hey, we don't have to be there till Saturday.  Mohegan Sun's on the way. 
[00:13:30]  I'm going to stop at Mohegan, do a little of that gambling.  And they take care of me up there, Mohegan.  And if you forgot, the last time he was at Mohegan Sun for our virus tour, he won 50,000 playing blackjack.  50 G's.  Can I mention to the audience, what you're seeing here, ladies and gentlemen, is the unraveling of this human being.  Oh, no kidding.  I've been unraveling for years.  You're watching my friend unraveling.  No kidding.  I've been unraveling for years.  Gambling lessons, drinking lessons, drug lessons.  Yeah, we'll just enjoy the ride.  What the hell?  I can't gamble. 
[00:14:00]  Enjoy yourself.  Without drinking.  This should be called the Aussie in 1978 and an opie show.  I screwed up.  Damn it.  This is the type of thing you do when you're in your 20s.  Yeah.  But I can't gamble without drinking.  It's just something I can't do.  Did it ever occur to you that we did have a comedy show on Saturday?  That's all I want to know.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I killed.  I was great.  I put my game face on when we hit the stage.  That's what I do.  Believe me, I come to the table even hungover. 
[00:14:30]  So Friday, you're at Mohegan Sun.  Yeah.  Doing a little of that gambling.  Doing a little gambling.  And you know what they like to do at the casinos?  They feed you those drinks because they want to trip you up.  So they keep coming back.  You mean they don't come over with soda and crackers and go, you've had enough, sir?  Never.  They kept coming over with the screwdrivers.  And where they have two really big burly men that hold you down and pour it down your throat.  And pour it down my throat.  Oh, they did.  Of course.  That's what they do.  That's how they roll in Mohegan. 
[00:15:00]  Let me tell you about it.  After the first couple, you assume that how good you're feeling is going to be the same  no matter how many you drink.  Right.  That's just the assumption that people make when they drink.  It's the wrong assumption.  You're going to reach a level and then the next day you're going to feel really crappy.  Well, you won 50 G's and you go back.  As far as I'm concerned, you're just pressing your luck.  Take your 50 G's and just quit.  Well, that isn't what I did.  I took some money with me.  I left a lot of it. 
[00:15:30]  I didn't take a lot of it with me, but I took a chunk with me and went there and sat down.  And this time, completely hooked up.  They took care of me.  Of course.  They want their money back.  Compt suite, which was beautiful.  A host.  You realize you're a whale now, right?  I think so.  You're a whale.  A host.  Mohegan's son is well aware of Anthony Cumia.  Of course they hooked you up.  And then they go, we have a table for you. 
[00:16:00]  They also attempted to get the cards that were set up nice for you.  They said, we have a table for you in the high roller section.  We say.  They will wait there for you the entire time.  And he showed me the table.  There's a dealer just sitting there with a reserved son on the table.  And her job is to stand there until I decide I want to go to that table.  Which was hours later.  Her job is to give you bed hands until they got their 50G back.  Exactly.  Please tell me you went to another table.  Because Kenny warned you about that.  Well, Kenny warned me.  Kenny back in the day has done some, well, he's watched some serious gambling go on. 
[00:16:30]  He knows all the tricks.  Let me tell you what the biggest trick is.  Keeping Kenny away from your table.  Thank God he wasn't there.  Kenny is one of the biggest mushers there is.  What's a mush?  A mush is someone that stands there and just brings you bad luck.  Like, you can't win.  Dice, I heard, used to throw him out.  And go, just get out of here.  It's called the cooler.  Yeah, he's a cooler is what it is.  But mush is better.  But he doesn't want to say that.  So he comes up with all kinds of other ideas as to why you're losing.  And one of it is when you get in with a casino and you've won a lot of money and they hook you up with a table, it's rigged. 
[00:17:00]  And they want their money back, so they rig it so you lose.  So I had a reserve table set up.  I didn't go there immediately.  Well, if it's one-on-one, man, that would be very suspicious to me.  But I went to the three card first.  A little luck up and down.  Nothing big.  So we finally decide to eat and then we go to the high roller section.  And it's a $6,000 maximum table that you're on.  And I sit down.  But I didn't sit at the reserve table right away. 
[00:17:30]  Went to another table next to it because there were a few people there.  I like playing with a few people at first.  And did okay up, down again.  Then I went to the reserve table.  And some other guy came and sat down, which was cool.  I didn't care.  Well, that's some guy.  It was somebody from the casino probably.  I don't know.  I've read too many gambling books.  Ted the host.  I don't know who he was.  But I started playing now seriously from about 10 o'clock p.m.  until 8.30 in the morning.  It was that long of just playing and drinking. 
[00:18:00]  And I keep the cop right there behind me the whole time.  Making sure everything is hunky-dory.  And just destroyed.  Destroyed the place.  Walked away.  This time with the big six figures, my friend.  $100,000.  Walked away with.  But you left part of your liver.  Yeah, yeah.  Part of the old liver.  It's worth it for $100.  He was left behind. 
[00:18:30]  $100,000.  Walked away.  Walked away.  So now the host.  He's grabbing onto your ankles.  Please don't come back.  But it reminded me of Casino.  Because he then gave us the information for when I come up next time.  Because he heard that we had sat in six hours of traffic.  Now, can I slow you down a little bit?  I mean, the progression here is getting downright scary.  It is getting ridiculous.  Because like we told you, now he's up to a private room.  Now, look what the casino's giving Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  So now, instead of sitting.  They're sending you a limo, right?  In traffic.  No.  They still have to sit in traffic.  I drive to Republic Airport.  And take the private Mohegan Sun jet.  That they have given me access to.  Comped.  And fly me there to the casino.  And what they do on that jet.  Right.  We hear about that.  As they say to you, hand us $150,000 or we can throw you out.  Yeah.  It's the new back room.  That's it. 
[00:19:30]  They do it in the air now.  If you notice, we're all wearing parachutes.  Right.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Oh, they had enough of you.  Oh, they want their money back.  Please do this.  Please go look.  I feel like I can't gamble anymore.  And all that would help me is if my friend Jim Norton had a suite and some hookers provided  for him.  There you go.  Help your friends.  Hook him.  Comp him.  Some trannies.  You're officially a whale to Mohegan Sun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Officially.  Oh, they took care of me.  It was wonderful.  When are you going to admit to them that you're card counting? 
[00:20:00]  I don't card count.  It's impossible.  First of all, it's a constantly shuffling shoe.  It's wonderful.  Oh, they've squashed the card counters.  I'm too stupid.  My math skills aren't good enough.  You know what it was?  It was drunken gambling.  Now, how did you get the 100 G's out of the joint?  Well...  Up to your room and then...  I'm...  And where the hell was the 100 G's while we were doing a comedy show?  Exactly. 
[00:20:30]  I'm kind of a...  I like it in greenbacks kind of guy.  You know?  So it was kind of funny that Keith the Cop, we collected.  It's just like big stack.  I just lifted up my shirt and they dumped big piles in my shirt and I walked to the elevator  that way.  I like it in greenbacks, by the way.  The other word for that is kidnap me.  What's the matter with you?  I've taken care of it.  All right.  Put it in the bank.  Exactly.  Okay.  Don't worry.  I know exactly where it is now.  It's called Safety Deposit Box. 
[00:21:00]  That's where you put it.  Because then you could gamble with it some more.  That's my...  That is now my bankroll.  That's my money for a year and a half.  What I call my bankroll.  I may be entering some poker tournaments with that.  Give it a try, right?  What the hell?  We'll enjoy the ride.  I'm going to miss you.  Yeah.  It's fun.  Jimmy and I will enjoy the ride.  It'll be fun.  Fast cars, gambling, booze. 
[00:21:30]  That's it.  It's out of your mind.  What are you doing?  You are.  You're doing 100 miles an hour in a Shelby.  He's drinking like William Holden right before the coffee table smashed his head.  He's like gambling like a lunatic and it's frightening.  It's fun.  Puking all over the place.  It was great.  It's frightening.  It's wonderful.  I had a great weekend.  I was pretty shot though this Saturday morning until the afternoon.  Right until showtime. 
[00:22:00]  Well, you didn't really sleep.  No, no.  Didn't get much sleep.  A couple hours.  Well, you were sleeping in the dressing room and that's when everyone was coming in.  Is he all right?  Is he all right?  I wasn't even sleeping.  I was watching the strippers up on the camera.  Yeah, the girls were pretty nice this time.  Yeah, all three of them that they sent.  Yeah, three girls.  Yeah, but the three were really, really hot.  You know something?  I'd rather have three hot girls than six slobs marching through the hallways back there.  Those three girls were probably hotter than the other strippers we've had so far on this tour.  So I was watching them and then joined by the crew. 
[00:22:30]  We watched the show.  Yeah.  From backstage.  Had a great time.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  Tons of YouTube videos.  Just quick clips.  Of our comedy tour in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  If you want to see what was going on.  And go to Virus Tour.  One word on MySpace.  Next stop.  Detroit.  Yep.  In two weeks.  I hear there's a casino.  Oh, boy.  Near Detroit.  Is what I'm hearing.  Oh, boy.  If anybody from the Detroit area knows of this, please let me know. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, boy.  Got some gambling to do.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it, by the way.  The casino in Detroit, as you walk through one of the neighborhoods, and if you make it  through a lie, if somebody hands you $50,000.  There have been no winners.  No.  Let's make it interesting.  You got to wear a sign.  He has one.  It's called lack of melanin.  All right.  We're just getting started.  It's Monday morning, everybody.  Yes.  What's today, by the way?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  It's Feel Good Story Monday. 
[00:23:30]  It's We Built This City Monday.  It's Marble Madness Monday.  Some of these have got to go.  And, of course, Pot Talk Monday.  Yes.  All on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio Shock Jock.  Opie and Anthony.  Actually, you're listening to the Opie and the Whale Show.  Ooh.  With little Jimmy Norton.  Good morning.  It's a Monday.  Instant feedback.  We got Chris from Boston writing.  He says, hey, Opie, thanks again for a fantastic show.  This one blew away last year's Worcester Show.  Yeah.  Of course, talking about the comedy show up there in Mansfield.  Well, the Worcester Show was the first one. 
[00:24:00]  We've done about, I don't know, eight or nine at this point.  Kind of getting proficient.  I have to do the math real fast for us.  I guess we've done seven or eight, actually.  This one blew away last year's Worcester Show.  Jimmy never disappoints.  And it was the first time I saw Otto and George and Louis C.K.  who both killed.  And then he writes, the Pat Duffy video is 100 times worse on a 20-foot screen.  Yeah, the Pat Duffy video was a huge hit.  Huge.  I love Pat Duffy videos.  Yeah, yeah.  Pat Duffy is featured in both. 
[00:24:30]  That, I will never get tired of the crowd reaction to the Baby Bird video.  Well, the Baby Bird video has been seen by just about almost everybody in our audience.  But there's something about seeing it in front of 7,000 people like we did in Mansfield on Saturday night.  It's a reaction of 7,000 people at once is such a great, great feeling.  Because it's all the same reaction.  So you just get that, oh!  Yeah, it's our stairway to heaven.  Yep.  Absolutely. 
[00:25:00]  Our stairway.  Because when I saw Ed Saturday, I'm like, wow, he's going to not be a lot of fun today.  But I know what we got waiting in the wings.  It's a guaranteed reaction we got when we go up on that stage.  We had, it was really cool to see a lot of guys like Pat Fominaki went on stage and Andrew Big A.  Yep.  And Patty.  This is talking about Patty.  I didn't see you guys up there because I was trying to get ready to go on.  But I heard the reaction and stuff.  Well, Big A, we had him, you know, try to intro a Jim Norton video.  And, of course, Dan and Travis, right, put together a nice little thing, a little intro for Jimmy's video. 
[00:25:30]  And, of course, it had a bunch of ST words, which just shuts Big A down big time.  He can't say them.  And, man, it makes me laugh so hard to see him doing that because I know we love them and we take care of them and this and that.  The reaction we got from the crowd, they were horrified for the most part.  I mean, you had a bunch of people laughing because they get the whole thing.  And then other people just had their mouths agape, like, I can't believe these guys are making this poor guy do this. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  But then I heard backstage, it got a huge reaction.  All the comedians and all the help and all the people backstage were just dying laughing their asses off.  He was sweating.  He couldn't get the words out.  And his brow was just all furrowed.  Is there a video of that, hopefully?  Because he shut down trying to do it.  And had to start over.  Right from the start, too.  The first word was an ST word right from the beginning.  And it took him a good minute to spit that one out.  Yeah, yeah.  Start clapping, I think it started with. 
[00:26:30]  And it took him about 30 seconds just to say start.  I've never seen him.  It was like the spittle is bubbling out the sides.  He had thousands of people just staring at him.  And sweat pouring off his forehead.  Yeah, if that video is up on YouTube, could you get the audio?  I want to play that for everybody today.  This is painful to watch.  Let's say hi to Brian in Detroit.  That's the next stop for the virus tour.  What's up, Brian?  Not much.  How's it going, guys?  Pretty good, man.  Oh, yeah.  I just called to tell Anthony.  We have three casinos here.  And we have Warren, if he can leave the country, over in Windsor. 
[00:27:00]  Uh-huh.  How far is Canada from Detroit?  How far is what?  It's pretty close, Jimmy.  Canada to Detroit.  Windsor to Detroit.  Well, Canada.  How far is Canada from Detroit?  Oh, about 35 miles.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Ain't bad.  All right, there you go.  You got the MGM Grand in Detroit, Anthony.  And then Chris in Detroit.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up? 
[00:27:30]  Hey, the Motor City Casino is the one everybody hits, usually.  Oh, yeah?  The biggest one.  Motor City Casino?  They have, like, a radio bar there.  I'm surprised you guys aren't, like, broadcasting from there, which would probably be a death blow  over Anthony, but...  Well, we might broadcast from Detroit the day before the show.  We're trying to figure out all those details.  Watch once the word gets out that Borgata in Atlantic City is going to build a little  radio station.  All these places are going to want to suck a gun in New York, New York and Vegas.  Well, Anthony's officially a whale. 
[00:28:00]  He's a whale.  What's that mean?  A whale is like...  It's one of the big fish.  Yeah, big fish.  A guy that gambles a lot.  That the casinos want to have in there because...  They want the whales.  On average, they take money from them.  Because eventually the whales will lose a lot of money.  So...  Yeah.  And in a mere two weeks' time, you went from Joe Gambler to now they're offering you private  jets from Long Island to Mohegan Sun so you can gamble some more.  Well, see, here's the thing.  Because Kenny warned me. 
[00:28:30]  He goes, you're right there on the precipice.  You're right there.  Kenny's kind of seen this.  Kenny's told me some many, many gambling stories over the last couple of years.  But, see, the thing is, I got lucky.  I understand luck.  I don't go with that much to gamble.  I've lost gambling and I've been completely fine with what I've lost because I don't start  out with that much.  But I've, the past couple of times out, have just been really lucky and I've been able 
[00:29:00]  to turn a relatively small amount of money into a lot of money.  This is, by the way, a monologue Anthony's had.  I'm reciting that.  I'm trying to rationalize.  Anthony's had this by himself alone.  And Anthony's walked through his...  Look, what I've done...  What I've done, look, I'm perfectly okay with walking away, he has said.  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of chairs and a table and maybe a roll that's on that table.  I could walk away.  You know Mohegan Sun right now is listening.  Like, we got him right where we want him.  They're like...  Let them get me right where they want me.  This morning.  Is he doing the monologues?  Yes, he's doing them. 
[00:29:30]  He's doing the monologues.  He's doing everything.  He's running through all the motions that everyone runs through.  But you're going to be the guy.  I can't be the guy.  Hey, Jimmy, no, I mean, you'll be the guy that knows how to control it.  Oh, that's it.  That's me.  Jimmy and I are going to enjoy the ride, man.  No.  Have fun, well.  I'm happy with bringing a certain amount and that's what I gamble.  Yeah, right.  And win or lose, that's it.  But like I said, lately, I've been winning.  And when you win big, then you do bet more. 
[00:30:00]  Then you win bigger.  Well, the last two times out gambling, you've won a total of $150,000.  Yes.  It's been very, very, very lucky.  I understand the luck factor.  Hence the private jet to the Mohegan Sun.  When are you going to take him up on that?  Because now you know you've got to take him up on it.  Because, you know, that's like something you've got to do now.  I don't know.  Whenever we get a weekend free, maybe I'll do that for the weekend.  Free this weekend.  Yeah, maybe I'll take the jet up.  We've got a rare free weekend.  Please take the jet and play penny slots or nickel slots. 
[00:30:30]  That's the answer.  Please do that.  We were joking about that.  All comp, nice everything.  And then I just go, where are the penny slots?  Right, right.  I need a lot of pennies.  Drink seltzer.  Oh, I'm down a buck 80.  How great would that be?  Win $7 and demand a security walk up.  Just be the biggest ass.  How infuriating.  Great.  Oh, would they be angry?  See your host's shoes above you as he hangs himself in. 
[00:31:00]  This is going to be interesting.  You're treating me very well.  Yeah.  I had a good time.  And then Tom Chiosano, he walks in during the commercial break.  He goes, $100,000.  He's just amazed and happy for Anthony.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then he casually mentions that he had a hole-in-one over the weekend.  A hole-in-one.  His second hole-in-one, 215-yard par three.  Wow.  In the cup.  In the cup.  Had three of those.  Is that common?  Two.  Two.  No, I've had three.  You've had three. 
[00:31:30]  At the mini golf.  That's pretty rare, right?  A hole-in-one.  Oh.  Yeah, especially for the, you know, amateur.  I've played off and on my whole life.  I've, you know, I've come close.  Yeah, it's rare, Jimmy.  Well, Tom kicked it, though.  He didn't say that in here, but I heard him talking.  He said, yeah, it was close.  So I just nudged it.  I mean, that's.  He knocked it in.  I still consider it a hole-in-one.  He nudged it, but it's a show.  It hit the club head once.  Yeah.  That's all.  Sonny Farrelly, he's always good for one for Boston, of course.  Holy yes.  During the playing of the Pat Duffy video up there in Mansfield, the looks on the old 
[00:32:00]  lady usher's faces were priceless.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the beauty of some of these shows.  Like, you get people that are hardcore fans of the show, and then you got people going,  oh, nice comedy show.  Yeah, I'll check this out.  And then they're kind of horrified by some of the things that are happening on that stage.  And then No Field to Paul grabbed me after the show, or the next day while he's eating  breakfast.  He's all pissed.  He's like, why don't you show my diaper video up there?  And now I'm thinking we might have to.  Yeah.  That one is pretty bad. 
[00:32:30]  This could be the summer of just gross videos in between comics.  He'd bring the guys out, and most of these people we take for granted, because we see  these awful human beings, Paul and his little head, but the listeners don't get to see them,  and they hear about them.  They clap for them, or they boo them, whatever they want to do.  We should bring these guys out.  Yeah.  People do want to see them for some reason.  At the hotel yesterday morning, I got a New York paper, and I'm sitting in the lobby just  kind of hanging out, drinking coffee, and Stalker Patty walks by, and she's like,  a New York paper. 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, yeah.  Wow, where'd you get that?  Exactly.  So then I'm trying to shoo her away, so I'm like, look, when I'm done, I'll give it to  you.  No problem, because I guess she walked like a mile to try to find a paper or something,  I was told, by I think a big A was telling me.  And I'm like, I'll give it to you when I'm done.  And she proceeds to stand there and wait for me to finish reading the paper.  Doesn't mean wait for me.  I'm like, I will find you.  Just go about your morning.  Do you see her reading over your shoulder? 
[00:33:30]  Right.  You're just wheezing in your ear as she's reading?  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Hey, in honor of Anthony, we're getting a few requests.  Oh.  For our old school 100 grand bid.  Ah.  Anthony.  I was thinking about this when...  Were you really?  Yeah, when I was playing.  Anthony, if you're just tuning in, won $100,000 before the virus show on Saturday when he went  to Mohegan Sun on Friday.  Good old blackjack.  Friday night.  Good old blackjack.  Kind of love it.  Here's 100 grand. 
[00:34:00]  100 grand.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  107th caller.  Oh, no way!  I won!  I won!  I don't know what you're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man.  The first thing.  I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jesus. 
[00:34:30]  I've got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this...  Oh, man.  I got this...  For a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that...  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you been saying? 
[00:35:00]  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of toasts!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  Ray!  He's pissed.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring.  Yes.  There you go.  Gonna give that money back.  Chocolate ring.  Again.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring. 
[00:35:30]  Don't get on that plane, you idiot.  Chocolate ring.  His Mohegan son will send an aeroplane.  Chocolate ring.  They'll put that money in their vault again.  Chocolate ring.  They'd rather fly you the way Mr. Sosa flew Omar.  Chocolate ring.  After the next time, your pants will have a big stain.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring.  Gambling in his veins. 
[00:36:00]  Flying there, but going home, you'll take a train.  Chocolate ring.  I bet you lose and they just go, uh, the plane?  Yeah.  Yeah, so long.  Uh, it's out.  Yeah, so long, buddy.  We're sorry.  We got our money back.  I hear there's a jitney.  There's a bus you could take.  There's a bus leaving at noon.  You're just sitting there.  But I had a strategy.  But I had a strategy.  But I won.  But I said I would only gamble $5,000. 
[00:36:30]  Stuck in traffic on a bus with a bunch of people that were playing the slot machines.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  We're going to enjoy the ride, man.  You gave us a great story on this radio show.  We'll see.  We'll see how it goes.  He's up $150,000.  We'll keep track.  See if I can ride it out.  Oh, and you asked me what I did with it?  Yeah.  Oh, it was very...  That was the most harrowing of situations because the hotel we stayed at, it's the first 
[00:37:00]  hotel we have stayed at that didn't have a goddamn safe.  There's no safe.  And flimsy doors.  Nice hotel.  I'm not going to trash the place.  It was nice.  No, no.  It was nice.  It was close to the venue.  It was a nice joint, but not the most secure joint.  No.  By any means.  So I had to put it just like in a bag and I stashed it, like kind of hit it as best  I could in the room.  I won't say anything more than that, but the most stressful part of the evening was when 
[00:37:30]  I put that key card in the slot and opened the door and was like, please be there.  Oh, my God.  And then I looked and then I battened myself in there like a safe room.  Where do you hide $100,000 in a room in a courtyard barriott?  It's very hard to.  Well, you can tell us because it's not going to, it's like we can't.  What if I win again and I have to hide my money?  Then people will just go to your room and turn it upside down knowing it's in there.  Wait, they're not going to look under the mattress?  Right.  All right, well, I guess he hid it here, but we can't find it. 
[00:38:00]  That's true.  I'm not going to look behind that picture on the wall.  I did put it kind of like under the bed in the back by the dresser drawer area.  Yeah, they wouldn't flip the mattress or anything.  I know.  I would leave it in piles on the bed and then ask them to turn the mattress down just to  watch their dumb faces when they saw that money.  They wouldn't, I guarantee you, if there was $100,000 piled up, they wouldn't touch it.  They'd think, this is a sting.  There's got to be some kind of setup. 
[00:38:30]  This could not be real.  Yeah, you should have made some videos.  No, what you do is this.  Yeah.  You put paper with arrows pointing to the money going, money!  With an exclamation point.  Money!  And nobody would touch that.  And then, you know, because Keith had the adjoining room and like he thought he'd be able  to come in and then just go through the adjoining doors because they're usually opened.  He's like, oh, I noticed you just locked everything up.  I'm like, yes, I did.  Because the key cards wouldn't work.  I turned all those for safety. 
[00:39:00]  I put the little metal things on like I was.  And then I'm sitting there just staring at the television, waiting for some listener or  something to bash my door in.  You did the metal thing from the inside?  Yeah, yeah.  Those don't work.  Well, you know, maybe it could be next to a second.  Kenny told me a Mohegan son he had to do an old trick to get into his room because that  was on.  Oh, yeah?  Well, you put your dinosaur head in and you can get through those.  Dinosaur head.  How did he get through that?  Maybe he could explain it.  But those little bars that you... 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  It's like solid brass bar.  It's in the place of the chain, the old-fashioned chain that you put on the door.  Is it the swing thing?  Yeah.  The swing's over.  He says those are easy to break into.  Really?  Yeah.  There's an old trick.  People that are on the road a lot have figured out a long time ago.  An old trick.  I also want to make it clear that Dice never chased Kenny away from a gambling table.  He did chase me away.  He did.  You talked to Kenny on the break and he said that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was mostly them intimidating the dealers. 
[00:40:00]  So Dice would like having them around.  Well, apparently.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey.  I give it about six months.  We're going to have Anthony doing PSAs for gambling after he loses it all.  That's right.  Hi.  I'm Anthony Cumia.  No, he's going to be the one, though.  I thought gambling was great.  I was winning.  I was on a streak.  And then it all came tumbling down.  And they'll show a photo of where he lives and he'll go, and this was my home.  I lost it all.  If you have a gambling problem... 
[00:40:30]  I was so mad when Dice made me leave because he was probably down a couple hundred grand  at the Venetians.  Before we actually started doing the Venetian, he was going in there from Ballets.  And he was down a big bunch.  And I didn't know anything about it.  I was just like, ugh, this is boring.  I'm watching thousands and thousands of dollars.  It was depressing, too.  And then Kenny walked over and goes, could you take a walk?  Andrew thinks you're bringing a bad look.  I was so hurt.  Oh, my God.  And all you want to do is watch.  He's going to be one of the guys.  What was the biggest hand you lost over the weekend there, Anthony? 
[00:41:00]  Probably, um...  I heard rumors of 16G.  Well, two hands, 6,000 max.  So that's 12.  And then I had to split on one.  Yeah.  18.  You lost 18?  18 in one hand.  In one hand.  But another hand, I had six on each.  And I had to split on both hands and then double.  So it was like a $24,000 hand.  How'd you do?  I won that one.  Obviously.  That was a big... 
[00:41:30]  Were you up even more than $100,000?  No, that's another thing.  I wasn't up much more.  Maybe by a couple thousand.  But I wasn't up or down much more than that.  So it wasn't like, oh, I could have walked away with this or anything.  And then finally, Keith is the one that's always trying to get me to leave.  He's like, dude, I'm looking.  You got like $80,000 there.  And I'm like, nope.  We forged ahead.  Anna is taking care of us tonight.  Who's Anna?  She was the dealer.  Like, come on, Anna.  Come on.  Bust it up. 
[00:42:00]  You must have gave her a great tip.  $10 chip or something like that?  Perhaps more than that.  When I am winning, I will tip like a maniac.  Really?  So they made a lot of money, the dealers, off of me at night.  Let's say hi to John.  Don't worry about it.  For what?  They don't give you anything when you lose.  That's true.  I'd give them nothing.  But I like when they make me win a lot.  He's a buck.  Beat it.  John, what's up?  Shill.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Shill of the casino.  Shill. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, what?  Dude, if you start losing, they're going to treat you even better if you start giving  that money.  Ah, so that's what I should do.  Yeah.  Because it's not their goal just to...  Hold on, John.  It's not just their goal to get their $150,000 back.  They want that and then some.  See, he's going to put that Mustang on the table.  Because they're like, if a guy won $150,000 from us, he could easily lose $100,000 with  us.  Believe me, they Googled you and saw contract numbers and said, send the plane.  Send the plane immediately. 
[00:43:00]  They flipped formats.  They're the only show that's...  Send the plane.  What can Anthony look forward to?  That's what we need to hear from today.  The people that have had a little of this experience in their lives.  What can Anthony look forward to, John?  Well, I'm not one of those people, but I'm sure they'll send limos and helicopters, anything  you want.  You're already behind on the transportation.  They skip limos.  It's already the new private jet, by the way.  Yeah, you must be just tuning in.  They already offered him a private jet for the next time he wants to come to their car. 
[00:43:30]  I heard that.  How about...  The funny thing is, the Mohegan Sun has no idea who I am.  They're miles from my house.  It's a 40-minute flight.  Oh, you've already looked it up?  No, they give you...  I got all the info.  They gave me all the info.  They tell me when it leaves the airport, it's like right by my house.  It's great.  Oh, they're...  It's wonderful.  They'll probably send a helicopter to my house to get me to the airport.  Stony Beach One is suggesting Anna, the dealer, her body is in a dumpster at Mohegan. 
[00:44:00]  Let's say hi to Josh in Boston.  Probably not treating her very well.  Josh, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I really appreciate the show you put on for us.  We all just absolutely loved it.  Jimmy, you killed.  Thank you.  Yeah, Jimmy's great.  Thanks.  Hey, there.  My camera absolutely wasn't working.  We were over by the RV of a place I can't say.  But, you know, I appreciated your patience.  You were very nice.  Jimmy, you killed.  Okay.  Thank you, buddy. 
[00:44:30]  It was another great show.  You know, one review came out so far, and it gave the show rave reviews.  Next stop, Detroit.  Virus tour.  One word on MySpace for all the info.  I was impressed with the village.  It was just fun to see.  Thank you, Josh.  There's some hot chicks.  There's a lot of hot chicks in Boston.  There always are.  There's always hot girls up there.  I'm noticing more and more girls coming to our events, which is a really, really good thing to see.  Yeah.  Very good thing.  Nothing against the guys, but after a while, you know.  Oh, please, they understand.  You know.  They're not a bunch of queers.  They get it.  It's nice to smell a nice-smelling girl. 
[00:45:00]  Girls.  I've never felt sweatier hands.  I did a book signing up there.  So you shake hands as you sign.  I've never felt every single person there.  I think Big A was laying on a table next to my stupid book, and people were swiping his forehead and then shaking my hand.  I know.  I've never felt wetter hands.  A lot of slimy hands.  What do you people do?  What do you just dip them in a lake and then come and say hello to people?  Wash them or dry them.  Why do this on your pants?  Here, here, listen. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  That's the sound of a man's hand going, listen, she, hey, how you doing?  And then you shake.  Then shake with a dry hand.  I like the whole Purell thing after the end of the signing, man.  You know what?  The last person isn't even a foot away from us, and we're just dousing our hands in Purell like, get away from me, you infected scum.  It's a new ritual.  It's great.  Well, do you know what the president does now?  And a lot of politicians, probably to avoid getting sick, they make people Purell before they shake with them.  Ah.  Because if you Purell too much, it's no good for you. 
[00:46:00]  Why am I screaming?  It's no good for you.  So they make all the people shaking hands in the line Purell first.  So could you, maybe, Club Soda Kenny can now Purell the people before they get to us?  No, he'd use too much, and then you'd get sick anyway, because you'd wind up overusing it, you know?  Yeah.  Give me your hands, stupid.  You know how he's just so mean to the listeners.  Put your hand out.  Fifty words or less.  Yeah.  Move it along, people.  He almost messed up Patrice's set by throwing that guy off stage.  We'll talk about that next. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, that was a moment.  That was one of the moments that stand out from Saturday night.  Brought to you by Bud Light, Always Worth It, of course, the comedy tour.  Yes.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm looking at the Monday themes.  Yes.  Hot Talk Monday.  I like that still.  Yeah.  Feel Good Story Monday.  I like that still.  Sure.  We Built This City Monday. 
[00:47:00]  Ah, it didn't quite take off.  And Marble Madness Monday.  I don't even know what that was.  Preston and Steve.  Oh, see.  Remember when they did their dud?  Oh.  All right, we're going to cross off Marble Madness.  I have to do this because people are keeping score at home.  Yeah, they keep track.  Like those dorks that go to the baseball games and they have to get every play down.  All the stats.  All the stats.  We got those type of listeners, so they're keeping track.  Well, they better.  Those guys are the worst.  You know, typically in a situation like this, Murphy will strike out. 
[00:47:30]  Shut up.  Shut your face.  You know, four out of five times in this run around second, Murphy will line one off the  inside corner.  He's got your mouth.  He takes his little pencil.  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  You've never been to a baseball game where they tap you on the shoulder and ask what happened  because they were distracted for a second?  And you're like, oh.  Give him the wrong information.  Yeah, he grounded out to third.  Oh, thank you.  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  What do you do with these scorecards? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, we've got them all libraryed at home.  They're all put in chronological order.  And also the guys that have to read the Sunday paper while they're watching a baseball game.  That guy has got season tickets or something.  And so he's just lounging at the park, just reading and watching and just enjoying themselves.  So we're getting rid of We Built This City Monday, and we're getting rid of Marble Madness  Monday.  So now we're light for Monday.  So we might have to add a theme or two. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Hey, we got this feedback coming in from Westbury.  What's up, Long Island?  It's Tom.  He writes, so Anthony tears apart a terminally ill cancer patient on a Friday and wins 100  grand on Saturday.  There is no God.  Just trying to make people laugh.  There is no God.  I see it as I brought joy and laughter to many.  You know what amazes me about what happened on Friday?  We go after Tammy Faye.  And the reason being that Larry King has the last interview with Tammy Faye Baker. 
[00:49:00]  She died, by the way, just before Jimmy hit the stage, or that's when we found out in  Mansfield.  Yeah.  And I almost slipped.  And I learned from my mistakes, because if you remember, just before Bill Burr at the  Twitter Center in Camden last summer, and I, or I decided, and it was just a dumb, dumb  move, we decided to intro Bill Burr and then walk out into the middle of the crowd, completely  distracting Bill Burr's set.  That's how Bill Burr's set started. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, that was a bad move.  And we realized, well, maybe that's not the smartest thing to do, is start walking through  the freaking, you know, crowd right after you intro one of the comedians.  Not smart.  Not smart.  That's trying to do his act.  And I was this close to telling the whole audience in Mansfield that Tammy Faye Baker died,  and the reason being because we went after her being on Larry King on Friday's show.  Yep.  And I stopped myself last second.  I'm so glad I did that, because I think it would have brought kind of...  I wouldn't have minded. 
[00:50:00]  I would have trashed her.  Really?  Yeah, who cares?  Maybe what I should have done was tell you just before you hit the stage, maybe you could  have done something with it.  Look, here's the bottom line.  But I just felt like it would take the energy out of the room.  Weren't her and her husband televangelists?  Yes.  Didn't they bilk people who want God to love them out of a lot of money?  Aren't they the same vultures that stand on television saying, we need you to send money?  So, I mean, maybe it sounds heartless.  I don't know if she turned her life around. 
[00:50:30]  But from what my knowledge of her is, even being married to that guy and living that kind  of life, that blood money, I have no mercy.  Yeah.  No mercy at all.  You got what you did.  Yeah.  I lived on blood money.  And what I was going to say is, it's just amazing the anger that comes toward me, because  on Friday, did I write a line or two for Anthony?  Sure.  But in general, Anthony, that was Anthony's bit.  I might have had the setup a little bit, but I was like kind of a, I was barely participating  in that bit.  And everyone, the email I was reading, I'm like, dude, chill out. 
[00:51:00]  It was mostly Anthony, man.  Why are you getting mad at me?  Not one instant feedback that they're mad at you for doing it.  Because I'm likable.  Yeah.  No, I understand you're likable, but it's like, all right, look, you know, I give you  many reasons to hate.  And it was all Larry.  It wasn't Anthony, it was Larry.  But, and Larry King, I don't know if he listens to the show, but I had this weird feeling  because they replayed his last interview with Tammy Faye Baker.  Of course they did.  And he had to kind of defend himself before they rebroadcast the last interview, like,  look, this wasn't our idea. 
[00:51:30]  Tammy Faye came to us and wanted us to interview her because she knew she only had a few days  to live.  Like this whole thing he said just before he replayed the interview, like he was starting  to feel the guilt.  And that was the reason we went after, after the whole situation on Friday.  Not that we need to explain ourselves, but if you're going to show Tammy Faye Baker on  CNN at 65 pounds and what, showing the world what cancer could do to you, sorry, we're going  to make fun of it.  Yep.  Because the CNN wasn't doing it for, the only reason they were doing it was to get ratings. 
[00:52:00]  He was a shock jock.  He was a shock jock.  He was trying to shock.  On that interview.  Absolutely.  So she died over the weekend or on Saturday sometime.  She died Friday morning.  She died Friday morning.  Yeah.  So as we were doing the bit, she was dropping dead.  Oh my.  How about that?  Why did it take so long for the news to hit that?  Eh, they usually do that and then they kind of, you know, want to make up a press release  or something.  Well, the Google Alert.  So they just let her lay there for a while.  The Google Alert hit on Saturday, so. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  Actually, it took them a while to figure out if she was dead or not.  Yeah, they kept talking and they didn't know, well, she hasn't been making much noise.  She kind of looks like that.  She looks better than she has in days.  Yeah.  In other news today, we're waking up to the fact that, you know, good old Barry Bonds  there is going to set the record sometime this week, it looks like.  How many is he away from?  I think.  He's got two.  Two to go to tie.  And they sat him yesterday in Milwaukee, I think, because they got, you know, now the 
[00:53:00]  team's coming home to San Francisco.  Oh, they want him to do it at home.  You want your guy to set the record at home, obviously.  I hope he doesn't.  So, he's got two to go.  I think this is the week we see that record go by the wayside.  I just hope he doesn't.  Huh?  I hope he doesn't do it at home.  He's going to do it at home.  Oops, I dropped my iPhone.  I want to see him do it just because stupid Florentine's a big Giants fan.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Aside from that, I have no love for Barry Bonds.  Well, then, the good news, the record will be beat, you know, sooner than later. 
[00:53:30]  However, I don't care if he took...  I mean, what I meant by that was he's going to set the record, and then A-Rod or somebody  is going to just, like, surpass that in the next, you know, ten years or seven years,  five years, whatever.  I don't care that he took steroids.  I could...  Good.  You should take them.  They're there.  Hit another home run, stupid.  And then sneeze when you're 60, and the inside of your head goes...  Because your brains are mush.  I don't care if they take steroids.  I've had enough of people...  They took steroids.  That's performance enhancing, you know, Bob. 
[00:54:00]  It makes the game better.  Of course it does.  More fun to watch.  Can't straight yourselves.  Hit more home runs.  What do I care?  What kind of homestand do the Giants have this week?  He's going to set the record this week at home, it looks like.  Yeah.  Unless they're just doing one quick series and then hitting the road again.  I don't know their schedule.  They're actually playing one home game for the next three weeks.  Shut up, Jimmy.  You can't even hold it together.  Can I just add how bad...  Now, we love Jill Nicolini.  She was on our show.  Jill TV.  Jill TV.  She hasn't been on today. 
[00:54:30]  No.  I think she's off.  Might have a heavy weekend.  Well, it was really nice weather in New York.  You know, Hampton's Beach Bars.  She was out probably on a little bender.  Whatever.  But she wasn't in today.  And I got to explain.  This CW11 news here in New York, we love the people that work there.  They're very nice people.  We got all kinds of compliments on the websites and everything about Jill's appearance here.  But they are just a horrible news show to get the news. 
[00:55:00]  I'm just watching Fox News over here on the other TV, next to Jill TV.  There's a story today that there's, you know, it's one of these funny kind of human interest stories that if you want, you could hire bikini-clad women to mow your lawn.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  And they come to your house, hot girls, in bikinis, and mow your lawn.  Why did it take to the year 2007 to get that business up and running?  I have no idea.  That should have been years ago.  As soon as I saw the story this morning, I'm like, they should have done this 30 years ago. 
[00:55:30]  But would you want to see, like, those old-time bikinis?  And just, like, have this big granny panties bikinis?  Yeah.  Nah, the bikinis now are hot.  So they just showed it.  And what I saw on the Fox broadcast was bikini women pushing a lawnmower.  Now, the 11 News, the Jill TV News, had the story, they talked about it,  but their footage was of a Mexican landscaper pushing a lawnmower, 
[00:56:00]  a sprinkler head, and I forgot the third one, the third clip,  but it had not one bikini-clad woman at all.  And I'm sitting there, I go to Thad, I go,  isn't the story about bikini women mowing your lawn not one bikini woman?  You finally have an excuse to show just nothing but bikinis for like two minutes,  and you don't do it.  And they don't do it because they don't have that footage.  And then, all right, I give them a pass on that.  All right, maybe, you know, the story came in late, I don't know. 
[00:56:30]  But then they go to a story about how Scotty from Star Trek, Montgomery Scott,  his character was written to have been born in a certain place in the country.  And they were commemorating Scotty, not the guy that played Scotty,  Scotty, the character, with a Scotty museum in this town,  to which they played Star Trek clips where they showed Captain Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and Sulu. 
[00:57:00]  Wait.  Twice in the same loop.  Not one image, even in the background of Scotty.  Whoever's gathering the video over there at CW11 is a nudnik.  I think he's a fan of our show.  You're a fan.  Stop listening and get the right clips because we're noticing.  While you're talking about Channel 11 here in New York,  it's going to be a very rainy day in New York City.  So just before their rain report, they had to play the Eurythmics. 
[00:57:30]  Here comes the...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I forgot the hook now.  Oh, damn it.  Here comes the rain again.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm a short-haired man.  You know the stupid song.  They played the hook to that song just before the rain report.  They love their theme song, depending on what's going on for the day.  Because you mentioned it, here's the bikini lawn mowing.  Ow.  Talk about giving business a boost.  Yeah, Memphis Lawn Care Company has taken that phrase to a whole new level. 
[00:58:00]  Tiger Time Lawn Care is now offering a new service to its customers,  a bikini-clad woman.  You heard it right.  Customers now have the option of having a woman in her bikini mow their lawns.  The owner says that yards definitely get more attention when there's a bikini on the lawn.  Where's the bikini?  I'm looking at the video.  I'm not seeing any bikini.  What's up with that?  All guys disappointed everywhere.  Listen, I mowed a lot of lawns.  And you know that thing, the weed whacker, that trimmer thing, that thing?  Uh-huh.  That thing kicks up rocks.  If you were in a bikini, you'd be bruised and battered and cut.  Yeah, I don't.  These are some brave women. 
[00:58:30]  Brave women.  They had nothing.  I love that.  And the guy was even like, you know, where are the bikinis?  They showed a sprinkler head.  Right.  Come on.  Maybe that's the reaction the bikinis get from people who hire them.  Maybe it wasn't a sprinkler head.  You're right.  I love when they go off the word machine.  Oh, boy.  Stay to the word machine.  The word machine ends.  There's no more words.  And you've got to make it up.  And they just fall apart every time.  The word machine has stopped.  Right.  I have none of my own words. 
[00:59:00]  What do I say?  Unbelievable.  Please bring back the word machine.  Now, because we brought it to everyone's attention, here's the hook I was trying to remember.  Thank you, E.  Here comes the rain again.  Yeah.  Here comes the rain.  Going to be a rainy one here in New York City.  We'll tell you about it.  After these messages.  Chocolate rain.  Yeah, got to be some chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  See, now if they played this.  Oh, my God.  That would be just a tribute to this program and our relationship. 
[00:59:30]  It sure would.  With what we like to call our retarded little sister, CW11.  Here's the crowd reacting to Pat Duffy's video up there in Mansfield.  It's not the greatest copy.  It's off YouTube, I believe.  But this is how it went down on Saturday night as part of the comedy tour.  Yes. 
[01:00:00]  You know what the greatest part of that is, whoever was filming that?  Illegally, by the way.  They're cursing because they can't believe what they're saying.  Yeah, they can't even deal with what they're saying.  How great is that?  Whatever.  It's a quickie.  I know it's not the greatest copy. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Of course, we'll talk about Chuck and Larry next.  And also, we got to get to this.  The ref?  This referee, man.  He's so dead.  Let's hope so.  Yeah, I think he's dead.  What'd you get?  He's not dead yet, but he's.  Wow.  He's messing with.  They're the bikini lawnmower girls.  Look.  Yeah, and Fox are showing the chicks in the bikini.  Yeah, Fox.  They keep showing it over and over again.  They know.  What's wrong with the WB-11 here in New York?  Why don't they have that video?  They can't get the footage.  They have nothing but girls in bikinis mowing lawns. 
[01:01:00]  They're too busy, like everybody's making calls to try to find Jill Nicolini.  Right.  Like she was supposed to be in, and they're calling.  Do you have a number?  Dude, try to give it.  I'm just getting voicemail, man.  I'm a little worried.  She's probably in a bikini mowing lawns on Long Island.  Mowing lawns somewhere.  Side gig.  She's lost her mind.  All right.  More to come.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous CJ.  Opie and Anthony.  Rock!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:01:30]  A big good morning to everyone listening on WBCN in Boston.  It was great seeing a lot of you guys over the weekend.  It's been a while.  Been a while.  Hey, Sam in Kentucky writes,  I have a tumor under my left eye.  I've had surgery once.  Need more but can't afford it.  I'm dead serious.  Email me for contact info so I can prove it.  Would it be possible for you to donate a couple grand from your winning  so I could have the next surgery? 
[01:02:00]  Here come the freeloaders.  See, you made the mistake, I think it was last week or two weeks ago,  you admit that you gotta, you gotta like a, like a, like a soft spot in your heart for people like this.  Not when they ask.  Look, I find them randomly in the paper.  I find a touching story and I go, you know, that person is deserving of my, uh, compassion.  This guy's just asking, I don't know, I don't know what his real story is. 
[01:02:30]  They're gonna be marching past your house at all hours of the night now, you know that.  So send your contributions.  I still have to give a wedding gift to my good friend Travis here.  I haven't given him his wedding gift.  Thanks, now we all have to.  Oh, sorry about that.  Nah, we all didn't win like I did.  I may throw him 20 bucks.  Nice.  How about you sign it from Ant, Hope, and Jim?  Yeah.  All three of us.  Yes, please.  Hey, and by the way, for the guy with that little tumor under your eye,  we looked to donate club star to Kenny's left knuckle. 
[01:03:00]  The middle knuckle of his left hand.  I'm sure he'll be happy to remove it for you.  That'll remove it.  When I saw him speedwalking a gentleman off the, uh, premises at the show on Saturday night.  Wow.  What was that about?  Well, here's what happened.  Uh, Patrice had just taken the stage.  Uh, an overzealous fan.  Decided he wanted to come up and meet Patrice.  Oh, wow.  On the stage.  Now, Patrice sort of had this, like, it's a double-edged sword with him.  You don't want, and he was telling me this backstage. 
[01:03:30]  He goes, you don't want MFers coming up on you.  He goes, you don't want them coming up on you.  You don't know what they're there to do.  Or, or, you know, you're on stage.  You got a microphone.  You don't know what their intentions are.  So you want the problem remedied right away.  But then you don't want the crowd to start booing you for having someone, some idiot thrown out.  So he goes, you know, he kind of leaves like, you know, so I kind of pinned it on Club Soda Kenny, which Kenny understands.  That's part of the job. 
[01:04:00]  You know, the comic doesn't want to come off as being the, uh, the, uh, what they call a scum.  Uh, so he kind of, you know, oh, Kenny, he didn't have to do that.  But meanwhile, Kenny did have to do that.  And Kenny did it well.  All I know is we came off stage after introducing Patrice.  We're standing backstage a little.  And I just see Kenny with his arm wrapped around this guy in some kind of a half Nelson thing.  And he's just walking him very quickly toward the closest exit.  I'm watching the video.  It's actually up on YouTube. 
[01:04:30]  This is about scary, man.  We did all this Saturday, and now a lot of these videos are up on YouTube.  We're in the age of, uh, what they call the information superhighway, Opie.  I think they're calling it the, uh, internets.  And, and for the people that are illegally taping all this stuff, you know, we don't mind as long as you're not, like, you know, freaking taping full sets and throwing them up there.  Then those are the ones we'll have to have removed for the comedian's sake.  Don't put the comic sets up there.  That's the only thing we ask.  I like the tidbits.  And the only reason is it has nothing to do with, like, uh, rights or, or, or lawyers or anything like that.  The comic sets are, like, what they do. 
[01:05:00]  So, if it's up on YouTube and then people watch it, they go to the clubs and go, oh, I saw this.  It's like, well, you saw it on YouTube because some guy was taping it.  It's definitely fun to see a quick video.  Yeah.  Like, a minute video from.  We don't mind that at all.  From, uh, the action this past Saturday.  That guy had to be removed.  Yeah.  Can't do the right thing because that guy, it's like, you dummy.  You don't walk on while a performer is walking on stage and go to shake his hand.  I mean, I, I understand you.  You, you don't do it.  He's, he's a big fan of Patrice, though.  You can tell by the video.  That guy was probably sauced.  He's non-threatening, but, but you still can't do that. 
[01:05:30]  You don't know.  And Patrice turned around.  You can throw the guy's, uh, concentration off.  He didn't know what the guy's intentions were.  So, Patrice just turns around.  He's like, oh, my God.  And in all fairness, it worked out okay for everybody because we got the guy back on the  stage.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  He, we got him back, I think, right after Patrice.  We, uh, put him back on the stage.  Oh, okay.  And he was completely cool.  And he realized, oh, man.  Was he able to see through two black eyes?  That was kind of dumb to do.  That's good.  So, me and Louie could deal with him.  That's nice.  That's great.  He's already proven he's not, he's not able to handle it.  So, he's thrown back.  Let's clear him for Patrice and put him on for the Mexican and Norton. 
[01:06:00]  He was just excited.  Yeah.  Uh, Booby Man from Brooklyn writes, I'm sorry, but Channel 5, again.  Dude, they are now playing the, uh, bikini-clad lawnmower girls again.  They cannot play this clip enough.  They're not this miracle.  They know what sells.  They know.  Oh, boy, we're not, uh, we're not paying attention to Jill TV today because they don't  have the bikini.  Come on, guys.  Put the bikini babes. 
[01:06:30]  The lawn mowing.  Doing the lawn.  What are you, crazy?  Yeah, we're big fans of Channel 11, but you're blowing it this morning.  What do you want Chris Knowles up there talking about something?  Look at this chick in her black bikini.  She's got her shades on and she's mowing the lawn.  Wow, look at that.  I just want to see a mishap.  I want to see her foot dangling by a bone.  Or her run over a beehive.  I have to get stung in that stupid bikini.  Hey, just keep stinging her.  Or hope she falls into a cesspool and that one guy.  Can't be the greatest business, though, because I'm thinking a lot of wives would not. 
[01:07:00]  Wouldn't want that kind of service.  They would put their foot down.  That's true.  So then what?  You're going after the guys that are just single, that have nice houses?  Single guys, maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Boobie Man from Brooklyn writes, never mind that crap.  Chuck and Larry made $34.1 million at the box office, number one.  You know.  And he writes, what the F?  I knew it.  At this point, we're just a bunch of lemmings.  I mean, we're talking to a ton of people that went and saw the movie.  Yeah.  And the reviews were just awful on this flick. 
[01:07:30]  Horrid.  Do you know also that they...  The preview looked awful.  The commercial looked awful.  And we still will just march to the movie theater to go see it like zombies.  Must see, I pronounce you Chuck and Larry.  And if you think this was going to be like an edgy kind of thing, a real parody and take  off on gays and gay marriage and stuff like that, they actually worked in conjunction with  gay groups to make sure that nothing in there was offensive to the gays. 
[01:08:00]  They worked with the groups.  Because they didn't want to offend anybody.  Weird.  And what they wound up doing was making a movie that was perceived as this very family-friendly  version of a gay-themed movie.  So that's why it made so much money.  You know, that's not the first movie to do that, by the way.  What?  Johnny Knoxville had a movie out that on paper looked like it could have been hilarious.  Oh, where he went to the Special Olympics?  Yeah.  He made believe he was slow or whatever so he could go to the Special Olympics. 
[01:08:30]  Because I guess, I don't know, there was money at stake.  Yeah.  Whatever.  And he was down on his luck, needed money, so comes up with this great idea that he's  going to make believe he's, you know, he's a little slow so he could join the Special  Olympics.  The Ringer.  Thank you, E-Roy.  Mm-hmm.  And the same thing.  Because I saw the movie, I'm like, this looks like it could be really, really funny.  And I saw it, and I'm like, there was a couple funny moments, but in general, it was just  crap.  Yeah.  And then I read an article, same thing, the Special Olympics made the movie alongside 
[01:09:00]  Johnny Knoxville to make sure the jokes were okay.  Wouldn't offend.  You got to watch the South Park version, where Cartman joins the Special Olympics.  Really?  For that one, they really didn't care.  Well, you know what?  And we bring this up all the time, if you're a cartoon, you get away with murder.  Yeah, cartoons.  But that's going to end eventually, too.  They're going to go after cartoons eventually.  You watch.  But we're cartoons.  Americans are pussies.  Really.  Americans, we claim to be this great free speech society, but we're just a bunch of  little, whingy, whiny pussies. 
[01:09:30]  Having to go to the groups now and say, is this joke okay, if we put this in the movie?  Or is there a way we can make it so it wouldn't offend you?  Is this okay?  Because we're going to call him like a bitch.  Will that be okay?  It's okay.  Comedy is supposed to, on some level, offend somebody at some point.  Yeah.  What is it, then, if it's not going to offend somebody for some reason?  It doesn't have to be dirty.  You know what was refreshing, watching when we had the guys from The Simpsons in here, 
[01:10:00]  and they are throwing, like, anti-Semitic jokes at each other and stuff, and just, you  know, they don't care about this offensive and pleasing people and making sure feelings  aren't hurt.  It's good old-time, old-school, just fun and entertainment without this thing that people  feel they have to now make people feel good.  You know, the boys upstairs, they caved to the special interest groups, and now we're  all, like, you know, uber-sensitive when we do a radio show, but, you know, The Simpsons 
[01:10:30]  are still getting away with murder, and deservedly so.  Well, The Simpsons...  Getting big laughs for their TV show.  And the reason they have such a hit is because you looked at James Brooks and the other guys  that were here, and Al Jean, those, all four of them were funny guys.  Yeah.  And when you have funny guys in charge of what's funny, like, they know what to do.  Right.  And sometimes it's vicious, and sometimes it's not.  But the people that you deal with on the corporate side, like lawyers, they're just  crushing boards.  Yeah, they don't know.  And you know what was so refreshing on Friday during that interview, and it's something 
[01:11:00]  when we bring up, the lawyers kind of get mad, and I think maybe Tom on some level, there  was a pamphlet that was handed out to all of us called Words Hurt.  Words Hurt.  And we read this thing, and we really thought that the corporate lawyers went into comedy  writing.  We're like, there's no way they would actually print this out and hand it out to all their  jocks that work for the company.  It's one of the funniest things.  And want their jocks to take it seriously.  We're like, they're kidding, right?  I've ever seen written for a lawyer.  They decided that their radio shows suck, and they've decided to write material for the jocks,  right?  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  I couldn't comprehend that they wanted us to actually take this seriously.  So we goofed on the whole thing.  We read every single word in the thing.  We did an hour, hour and a half on it, and we got just a huge reaction.  People loved it.  And then Nick DePaul did the same thing when he was still working here in New York.  He's a great radio guy, by the way.  Very funny.  He's new to the radio thing, but he's really good, and I hope he gets another shot.  I'll say that over and over again.  But he got in trouble for doing the Words Hurt bit.  Yep.  And we brought it up with The Simpsons, and we got the reaction. 
[01:12:00]  Of course we should get.  We told them about this whole thing, and the laugh we got, like, they couldn't believe  it either.  Like, they were laughing their asses off.  They're used to having to deal with things like that, too, you know?  Yeah.  It's just the worst.  Just little corporate pussies.  So now this movie.  Oh, I pronounce you Chuck and Larry.  I pronounce you Chuck and Larry.  Chuck and Larry ends up number one at the box office.  And a great website.  A lot of the listeners are into it.  It's called RottenTomatoes.com.  They take all the reviews from all over the country, from all the major newspapers.  Because, you know, I mean, you read your local paper in a movie that has just got awful 
[01:12:30]  because your reviewer is different.  It might give it, like, four stars.  So the beauty of Rotten Tomatoes, they take all the big reviews from all over the country,  and then you really can understand if a movie's good or not.  14% good reviews on RottenTomatoes.com, and it's still the number one movie at the  box office.  Why?  I guess marketing works that well.  You could shove crap down, like, Americans' faces and say, look, go see this movie, go  see this movie, go see this movie.  And then we go see it.  I don't get that.  But how could marketing work that well when I'm looking at a poster for this movie and 
[01:13:00]  I can't even look at it?  It makes me cringe so much.  And this is what I wanted to say.  Because of the type of radio show we do, I feel like I should go see that movie so we're  well informed.  Guess what?  I didn't see the movie.  I don't want to see the movie.  Not even for the radio show, but it was still the number one movie at the box office.  Well, a part of it is, a part of me likes it, the fact that people are not listening  to critics.  Like, it's almost like they're so irrelevant and they're such snarky little douches. 
[01:13:30]  In a way, it's refreshing that people are just going, you know what?  That looks funny to me and I'm not listening to them.  The critics are not dictating what makes money.  But Jimmy, I don't even think they're saying that looks funny to me.  I think it goes a lot deeper than that.  It's just a marketing thing where you're not even making your own decision anymore.  You know, the TV tells you, the TV tells you, go see this movie.  And Adam Sandler, it's like, oh, it's got Adam Sandler in it and stuff.  And it's, oh, and I hear, it's about gay things, so it's going to be racy. 
[01:14:00]  I can't imagine that.  No, it's not.  I can't imagine the majority of people saw the commercial or the preview for this movie  and said, wow, that looks funny and went and saw it.  I think it's a lot deeper than that.  You ever watch what they laugh at in comedy clubs?  Believe me, they thought it was a hoot.  You really thought they saw the preview of the commercial and said, I have to see this  movie.  It looks funny.  They elbowed each other.  That looks pretty good, don't it?  It's the majority of people look at that and just go, oh, my God, does that look so funny?  Oh, I bet it's going to be so funny and racy.  Oh, wow.  All right.  I really do believe that because I watch what they laugh at in the clubs, you know, and I 
[01:14:30]  watch what they groan at.  And just the more the more just nonsensical it is, they think it's just wonderful.  And, you know, meanwhile, you say something vicious on stage, like, oh, hey, bub.  You know, I would love to make a movie like that because it would be hysterically funny  and no one would want to see it because it would just be like the most heinous versions  of sex between men. 
[01:15:00]  Gus and Elmer type sex.  That's what it would be.  Let's get back to Gus and Elmer.  Like, do it that way, that they have to prove that they're gay so much that they actually  have to have gay sex and they're not gay.  Of course.  So now they're like, oh, God.  Of course.  Like, could someone explain to me that saw the movie how far they went with the whole  angle?  Did they, like, tongue kiss?  Very good.  How far did they go?  Did they hold hands?  I bet you they didn't even hold hands.  How far did they go in this movie to show people that they're gay? 
[01:15:30]  Right.  I bet you there was a cheek kiss.  Probably a kiss of some sort at most.  It was just a lot of eyebrows being raised because they were living together, right?  That's about it?  There would be, like, there would be people, Adam Sandler would have to be on his knees  going, just like, and then going, just horrid.  Me and Florentina, this is how powerful gay groups are. 
[01:16:00]  We were doing something for VH1 years ago and we were shooting a pilot.  And we had, me and Jim were roommates and there was a gay couple that was a roommate  and there was another couple that was a roommate.  So me and Jim were writing lines for a lot of it.  And the gay storyline is supposed to open up where the two gay guys are walking around  and they're looking for their gerbil.  And the one guy's like, where is it?  And he's like, I don't know.  And it was like, and then you pan away.  And when you come back, it turns out that the gerbil would just run around, you know, 
[01:16:30]  and they got him.  But it was amazing that even the implication of that, well, of course, VH1 was like, oh,  no, we can't, you know.  And then they made it with the way they wanted to.  And it was, they wouldn't let me say retard.  They wanted me to say moron, which I refused to say.  I almost left the pilot.  I'm like, I'm not saying that.  It's not funny.  Retard.  And I won't say it.  When is it going to change?  They wonder why.  When are we going to push back?  I'm so happy.  When are creative people going to push back?  Never.  Creative people do.  It's the networks that don't.  It's like the people that they work for that don't.  Right. 
[01:17:00]  It's the creative people who want to push back.  But it's the people that are not creative that were forced to kind of be a part of show  business on the other side of it because they weren't good enough to make it.  They're not smart enough or funny enough or talented enough.  They can't write.  So what their jobs are, are to sit there and wreck it for everybody so they side with the  advertisers.  Right.  Because those are the people they relate to.  Boring.  Let's go to Dave in East Meadow.  Dave?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Dave.  I actually saw Chuck and Larry.  I'm going to say I did enjoy it.  But the furthest they went with the gay references was to say they love gay rough sex. 
[01:17:30]  They didn't even kiss at all.  Oh, of course.  So they didn't even kiss throughout the whole movie.  And they just said they love rough gay sex?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  And why did you enjoy the movie there, Dave?  It had some funny points to it.  I'm sure it did do a good job, but.  Like, like, but the funny parts.  And I was reading a synopsis of the funny parts and lines.  And they seemed very, like, hacky, kind of, all right, we get it, kind of gay jokes. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, it was funny.  It was funny to start with.  But mid-movie, they had to get to that message, oh, saying the word faggot is wrong.  That's what the message was?  I thought the message was looking at Jessica Biel's ass as she opened up that closet in  her underwear.  Yeah, a lot of people had to go, obviously.  They were on hold.  They said the reason they went to the movie was because Jessica Biel's in her underwear.  And I would say, well, don't you have the internet?  Exactly.  You could see some great Jessica Biel shots.  It's been people's sig pics for a while now. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's wonderful.  Let's say hi to Andy on Long Island.  Andy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  So you saw how to pronounce you Chuck and Larry?  Yeah, I saw the movie over the weekend.  I have a friend that was in it.  And it was probably, like, the worst written movie I've ever seen in my life.  But the jokes are hysterical in it.  But the jokes are hysterical.  Do you have an example of one, maybe?  I couldn't even tell you because everything was just talking about gay this, gay that,  gay this.  They had a couple of characters that were, like, pretty just good, like some really flamboyant 
[01:19:00]  guys.  You just wanted to laugh at them.  That's hilarious.  Do they do the thing where the guy puts his wrist and makes it limps and goes, hi, boys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, here's what, you can't find one funny scene.  If someone says to me, name a funny scene in the movie, Q&A with Nick Nolte.  Here's a funny scene.  Hold on, sir.  There you go.  Here's a funny scene.  Nick Nolte.  Nick, he's like a closet homosexual.  Deep down, he plays like a really angry cop.  Right, right.  Did you see Q&A? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  There's a scene where he rounds up these tranny hookers and he's going, we're so-and-so.  And he goes, and how about you, Sylvester?  And he squeezes the tranny's face.  And the tranny goes, I'm Sophia.  And Nick Nolte reaches his hand into the tranny's panties and he squeezes.  He goes, well, what's this?  And he squeezes.  And he goes, and then the tranny goes, oh.  And he goes, what's your name?  And the tranny goes, Sophia.  And he squeezes.  And she goes, stop it, Lieutenant. 
[01:20:00]  You're hurting me.  And he goes, not as bad as I'm going to.  What's your name, you see?  Blanker.  And he goes, Sylvester.  Now, to me, that was a funny scene.  There's a funny scene.  Hey, off the end, some feedback.  Johnny from Vegas, he writes, I find it funny that the biggest problem you guys have with  the movie is the lack of man-on-man action.  Well, we want a little realism.  I mean.  Look at that.  Yeah, that's definitely the reason to see the movie, right? 
[01:20:30]  Jessica Biel.  But who cares?  And those awful striped panties?  All right, we'll take one more.  We got Molly.  She really does look great.  Brain tree.  Molly, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I saw the movie this weekend, and it was actually pretty funny.  But that's the stupid kind of humor I'm into.  But I was calling because I wanted to tell you that there's really no contact other than  holding hands.  And as soon as they go to kiss to prove that they are gay in the trial, Dan Aykroyd interrupts  them.  And so it's a hint that they're going to, and then they get stopped every time they're 
[01:21:00]  going to.  Oh, look at that.  It was all right, though.  Yeah.  I don't like Adam Sandler, but I like Kevin James.  They're showing pictures of Tammy Faye.  It looks like one is okay, and one's got some water spilled on it.  She's melting.  Yeah, it looks like a melting candle.  Like a skeleton.  Why would you have to do that?  They show a healthy Tammy Faye on the left.  Yeah, we understand.  She gets ravaged by a disease.  On the right is what we all saw last week. 
[01:21:30]  Her and Larry King, 65 pounds and melting.  She looks like a bird.  Like every time Larry asked her a question, her mouth should just open and she should have  went...  Larry, I could vomit some garlic into you as nourishment like a mommy bird.  Yeah, then pulled a couple, just because, you know, she has now passed.  A couple clips from the Tammy Faye bit from Friday.  Nicer ones, I hope.  Yeah, just some of the nice ones.  How many we got?  Four.  Four?  Are they short?  Two of them are a minute 20. 
[01:22:00]  Well, why don't we play one here then?  By the way, at 8 o'clock or somewhere around there, we will have a Bunny Ranch winner update.  That's what I want to hear.  For Father's Day, we sent two married guys, fathers obviously, out to the Bunny Ranch to  have fun because, remember Bear?  He hasn't had sex in, what was it, 17, 18, 19 years?  Was it that long?  It was that...  What?  12 years.  It was since his daughter was born.  His twins or something.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to get the update. 
[01:22:30]  We sent Bear out there to take care of business.  Yeah.  And his wife, who he's still married to and lives with and all that.  Fine with it.  She's like, fine.  Go ahead.  I don't want to do it.  Well, today we get the update from Bear.  He went out to the Bunny Ranch.  We'll see how it was, okay?  Gotta hear that.  Yep.  Let's hear this.  This is from Friday.  The Larry King slash Tammy Faye bit.  This is our Larry King, Tammy Faye interview.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's always wonderful to welcome her back.  A former guest of the show, always a pleasure, Tammy Faye Baker. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, you might have seen her lately as a zombie in Grime House.  Holy s***.  What, did you drink from the wrong grail?  It's just not right, man.  It's just wrong.  Why don't we play another one?  Here's...  Oh, jeez.  What happened?  What happened, E? 
[01:23:30]  No, go.  Here's Tammy Faye on Larry King Live.  It may be hard to watch what inoperable cancer has done to her.  It's tough for us to see Tammy Faye looking so weak.  Great.  But as you're about to see...  A motley ghoul!  Let's see if she's 65 pounds, it's all hard.  How you doing, dear?  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God!  They're all over there.  I feel like my run around the area.  And, uh, I felt...  Oh, my God.  They're en route.  Don't worry. 
[01:24:30]  Holy...  Holy...  They could strip search you with tweezers.  Wow.  Well, Tammy Faye's got to go.  Let me like this.  There she goes.  Oh, my God.  That's not right, man.  Oh, damn.  Want to hear another one?  You bet I do.  Sure.  Great.  Here's another one. 
[01:25:00]  How you doing, dear?  How you doing?  Thank you.  I'm hearing the circumstances of marriage.  You are in Kansas City, Missouri.  That's...  What are you doing there?  What do you want to do?  We just knew.  Oh, no.  My husband's...  Oh, no.  Oh, my husband's...  My husband's...  A hundred miles out of the area.  Oh, no.  I felt...  Beak that one. 
[01:25:30]  I thought Tammy Faye was supposed to be here.  Who put this axle in the seat?  Is it true they're going to dig your grave with a garden spade?  Is it true, Tammy Faye?  You're going to be buried in a flute case.  Holy...  Holy...  Ladies and gentlemen...  Yeah.  Ah!  I'd offer you a jawbreaker, but... 
[01:26:00]  Tammy Faye, I see you're wearing a snakeskin outfit in its original form.  Tammy Faye, I see you've walked all the way here in the rain and haven't even gotten wet.  Tammy Faye, I loved you in Close Encounters when you walked out of that ship.  Oh, man.  People are getting mad that we're not playing the best parts from this bit from Friday. 
[01:26:30]  Alex from Miami, you missed the best part when Ant mentions that she makes Nancy Reagan look like Queen Latifah.  Oh, my God.  One more before we go to break?  You bet.  As many as you can get on this side of the show.  All right, one more.  Tammy Faye, the camera puts on an extra 10 pounds.  Can we get 50 cameras in here?  You look like you should be bleaching next to a watering hole in Africa.  You know what?  Ryan the Trucker.  Ryan, go ahead. 
[01:27:00]  We're back from commercial, but Tammy isn't.  Oh, God.  What?  Do you feel you're going to go to a better place when you die?  Like a Wendy's?  Well, Tammy, the doctors haven't told you how much time you have left, but they told me so.  We'll wait.  That's it, folks.  Wow. 
[01:27:30]  Wow, yeah.  She could have been dying as that was being said.  As that actually could have been.  Be fine if they show footage of her house and they're taking her out and you see like a little XM radio next to her bed.  Oh, God.  Like she enjoyed listening to some of the oldies and then she flipped on the wrong station and heard that.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Still lots to go this morning.  Horrible.  Hey, we got to start pumping up What the Hell is That?  We'll do that after the break.  We're also going to get your Bunny Ranch winner follow-up phoner.  Okay.  That's what I want to hear.  What kind of X went on? 
[01:28:00]  Hopefully we'll talk to Bear next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  Brainy day in New York City.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Retreat.  Retreat.  What happened, Jimmy, during the break?  There was a little...  I don't know.  There was a little tension.  Travis, come in here.  There was a little tension between Steve and Travis. 
[01:28:30]  I'd say almost an argument.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, as Travis walks into the studio, don't we have a new phone number to give everybody?  I thought you guys told me a new phone number would be...  It's supposed to be.  Is it working today?  I think so.  It's 8...  Oh, boy.  Before I say it, let me go to my notebook.  Why isn't this updated if we have a new number?  Travis, call him a dummy.  Why is it on a prep sheet?  No, I'm not.  Nice.  Oh, forget it.  Everyone's pointing, but...  We'll deal with it later.  ...pointing. 
[01:29:00]  Is this number working?  877.  I'll tell you right now.  Here it is.  Give it a try.  Wait.  2-1-2-0-1-8.  He's trying.  Jimmy's pounding it out now.  Yeah, if I can find the letters.  I hate letters.  Don't you hate letters?  But people do remember them.  Yeah.  Here it goes.  See if we get a call from little Jimmy Norton.  Oh, it's ringing.  And I see a line.  See if this is you. 
[01:29:30]  Hi, who's this?  No.  Oh, I call it.  Oh, it's Than.  Hi, Than.  You got something for the show?  Never.  Never.  Can you pick up my call?  Oh, which one's yours, Jimmy?  Maybe he's two.  Jimmy?  Meow.  Jimmy?  Meow.  Hello?  Someone else in the room.  Jimmy?  Meow.  I don't know.  I thought he was line two.  Well, that worked well.  Thanks.  The phone number is 877-212-O-N-A. 
[01:30:00]  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  A-N-D-A.  A-N-D-A.  Oh, I like that.  O-N-D-A.  877-212-O-N-A.  Oh.  Oh.  And A.  And A.  And A.  That's it.  O-N-D-A.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring.  877-212-O-N-A.  Chocolate ring.  By the way, I'm just effing with the instant feedback today. 
[01:30:30]  For every person that says, thanks a lot, you mother effer, that song stuck in my head.  Oh.  Every time I read one of those.  Chocolate ring.  I just throw it out there.  Chocolate.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring.  So, Jimmy, what happened during the break there?  I don't know.  I saw Steven Travis discussing some phone number, and Travis was legitimately disgusted.  Legitimately disgusted.  He wasn't faking it.  I saw him say he was legitimately.  What happened, Travis?  I wasn't disgusted.  I was just.  You were thoroughly annoyed. 
[01:31:00]  You're instigating, Jimmy.  No, I'm not.  What's the truth?  What happened, Travis?  What happened?  Nothing.  Steve has asked me multiple times this morning if I have certain phone numbers, which every  time he asks me, the answer doesn't change.  I always do.  And then he proceeds to go and call the phone numbers that he's been asking me about all  morning.  And I'm trying to get in touch with Bear, and he gives me a phone number that Bear's  not at.  And then that just makes me look stupid, because I come in here, and I say Bear's not available.  And then Steve comes in and says, I just talked to Bear.  Yeah, we promoted that we were going to talk to Bear after the break. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  And Travis comes in during the commercials, and I can't get a hold of him.  I called the number I have for Bear, and he's not there.  His wife has no updates.  I'm like, oh, great.  So now we're going to have to make up some radio.  And then Steve walks in, unbeknownst, and just casually goes, I called Bear.  He's ready to go after the break.  So Steve, what happened?  What was the problem?  What the hell was going on, man?  Last week, Bear must have called me three times, giving me the cell phone number he was  going to have with him in Nevada. 
[01:32:00]  Apparently, he didn't bring the cell phone with him, and that was the number I gave  Travis to call Bear up.  And really, what I was doing was calling the Bunny Ranch to make sure that these gentlemen  were up so we could talk to them.  And that's all I was doing.  I wasn't trying to make Travis look silly.  Well, Travis was thoroughly irritated with him.  That's okay.  Travis is allowed to be thoroughly irritated, and I'm sure it'll happen again.  You were annoyed with him.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was annoyed at the situation.  So they were in a corner bickering, just bickering.  Travis had that look.  He was just looking.  He wouldn't make eye contact with Steve.  He was looking down, thoroughly disgusted. 
[01:32:30]  By the way, very good news.  The phone's ringing off the hook, because now we have a phone number people could remember.  See?  877-212-O-S.  And A.  Or the option is 2-1-2-877-FLARQ.  It's an F and L and a Z and two Ks.  Let's talk to Bear.  If you're kind of a newbie to the show, right around Father's Day, we had a little promotion  where we were going to send a couple fathers out to the Bunny Ranch to, you know, to have 
[01:33:00]  a few dates.  To get a real Father's Day gift.  Not a tie.  Not a stupid tie.  Or some callogun.  Callogun.  What's the G doing in that word?  Callogun.  And I gotta say, as far as radio goes, we met Bear, like, I think he was the first phone  call.  Yeah.  And then he kind of wrecked a bit.  Because it was obvious no one was going to beat Bear.  No one was going to beat him.  He was just miserable in his marriage.  His sex life was down the crapper.  It just was an awful example of a life that of a guy that used to be a man. 
[01:33:30]  And then he's saddled with this hideous wife and time consuming children and a wife that  doesn't want to do her wifely duties.  Hasn't had sex with his wife in 12 years since the twins were born.  Something like that.  Still live together.  She is too busy, like, taking care of the house, taking care of 17 cats or something  like that.  Always busy with the cats, the house and the kids.  And a job.  And the job and the thought of sex to her means nothing.  Like, she doesn't care about it.  She doesn't want it from him at all. 
[01:34:00]  And he's still a guy.  He wants to, you know, have some female companionship in some way, shape, or form.  So we decided to give him some female companionship.  Yeah.  By sending him out to the Bunny Ranch.  And the wife didn't care because we got her on the phone and she's like, yeah, go ahead, Bear.  Whatever.  Go do what you have to do.  Well, I hope he comes back and after experiencing what he experiences, just tells her to  go screw.  I say this ends badly eventually because he's still out there in Vegas at the Bunny Ranch.  So let's say hi to Bear.  Hey, Bear, what's up? 
[01:34:30]  This isn't a bear.  This is Joe.  Wrong guy.  No, go get Bear, Joe.  We don't really remember you.  Bear's story was much better.  This is George Kennedy.  Yeah, I know.  George Kennedy.  Yeah, you don't remember?  No, I remember you, Joe.  Yeah.  We were just kind of making a joke because, see, we just set up the whole bear thing for  20 minutes.  It's for a bear.  So as far as a radio show goes, it would be much better to have Bear on right now.  I can explain Joe.  I just want the Joe experience, I mean the bear experience over there at his house to  end like the Benoit household.  Oh, my God.  Bear.  If he sees what's out there. 
[01:35:00]  What's going on?  Hey, Bear.  I got one thing to say.  Yeah.  To my buddy, Joe, you're done, John.  Bob, bing, forget about it.  Awesome, man.  All of a sudden, he turned into a cast member of The Sopranos.  Yeah, what happened?  What the hell happened?  Well, I'm all hungover.  Great time.  Beautiful girls.  All right, when did you...  Girls, Kit Kat Club.  Yeah.  When did you...  When did you guys fly in?  Oh, Saturday morning.  Saturday morning.  Saturday morning. 
[01:35:30]  So it's pretty early there, too, right now.  It's like what?  Right now, it's like 5, 5, 10, something like that.  Yeah, about 5, 5, 15 or something.  I hear girls.  I hear girls.  So you went Saturday morning, and what did you do when you got to the ranch?  I got to the ranch.  We met a lot of the girls.  We met Dennis.  Why is he on a speakerphone?  Yeah, he's up there.  He's on a speakerphone.  Yeah, you're not Gordon Gekko.  Yeah.  Let's get your back on the phone.  I know you're hungover, but...  Okay.  You'll have to share the stories with everybody.  Yeah.  You can tell them how it went. 
[01:36:00]  Obviously, speakerphone so other people in the room can hear, but it's not going to help us.  So you're drunk and hungover right now.  I hungover, yeah.  Yeah, I still hear it in your voice.  You're a little drunky.  Yeah, I got drunk last night.  We got some good pictures of you, me jumping on a trampoline outside.  So, you know...  Hold on, Ben.  You get to the ranch.  What time's Saturday?  Yeah, we want to walk you through this.  About 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  What happens at the airport?  Does a limo pick you up?  It was a...  Yeah, it was a navigator.  Nice black navigator. 
[01:36:30]  Clyde was our driver.  Great guy.  Yeah, good about Clyde.  Were there girls in it?  Yeah, they had two girls in it first.  Two girls in the navigator with you, driving from the airport to the bunny ranch.  Yeah.  And how are these girls?  Just hot, right?  Ah, forget about it.  Ah, and what were they dressed in?  Uh, little short shorts.  Yeah.  High heels.  And were you sitting, uh, were you guys sitting in the middle?  Yeah, pretty much.  Girl on each side?  Well, my girl, Felicia, was sitting on my lap. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, right on the lap.  Nice.  So what, you had your hands on her legs and on her stomach and stuff?  Yeah.  Those are some parts, yeah.  Some parts, all right.  And was she very aggressive in where her hands were landing?  Oh, yeah.  She was very, uh, she responded very well.  Ah, wonderful.  Look at this.  So that's just the drive there.  Wait, he got some on the way?  A little bit, huh? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So, do they, um, on the way, are you, are you getting, like, some action that you would  think would be something, uh, that could be considered, um, uh, like, sexual?  Yeah.  Uh, definitely.  Uh, yeah.  It was definitely adult.  Look at there.  Damn, that's something.  And this is the first time you've been with a woman in, what, 12 years? 
[01:38:00]  Something, yeah, about that.  And, uh, and it's all happening before you even get to the bunny ranch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  How, they were probably, they were probably, they were probably like, look, we gotta have  sex with this guy.  Let's, let's just try to finish up at the car and then we can relax with the rest of the  week.  Yeah, right.  They figured he's so horned up.  No, no, no offense, but I mean, they probably want to take the day off like any other employee.  Uh, so what happens?  You're fooling around in the car, you get to the ranch, what do you do?  Uh, we met Dennis and we met a bunch of the girls and, uh, the show, they gave us  a tour.  Did they have to get, call up the wolf to clean out the car after you guys were done? 
[01:38:30]  Yes.  Well, the driver, Clay, he did carry, he had, you know, a bottle of Windex with him and  he had some, uh, something else.  Oh, hell, I shot Clay in the face.  I don't even want to know what the Windex is for.  So, you meet Dennis, you take the tour of the ranch, which is great.  What, what do you like about the ranch?  What comes to mind as you're taking the tour?  Which girls I'm going to be seeing later on.  Right. 
[01:39:00]  So they got a little bar area there too, right?  Yeah, I spent a lot of time there.  So you sit down, you're having a drink, and the girls are just walking around?  Yeah.  All hot and in little shorts and bikinis and lingerie and stuff?  Exactly.  Little teddy bear things and high heels, eight-inch heels and six-inch heels.  And are they interacting with you?  Are they saying hi?  Are you talking to them?  Definitely.  Coming up, putting their arms around you, giving you little kisses here and there.  Wow.  I would imagine that Bear, you're a star at this point at the Bunny Ranch, right? 
[01:39:30]  They all knew who you were?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Let my girlfriend say one inappropriate thing.  I am so dying to go there because they're all in a good mood with those little skirts.  I am so dying.  Everyone's all like, yeah, when I watch this show, they're all smiling and laughing.  And that whole thing with that little bar area just seems like that's where it all begins.  Like you're drinking a little and the chicks are coming over and you're sparking up little conversations. 
[01:40:00]  And then you just go, hey, let's go over here.  And you're in a room.  Bear, when did you realize you want a divorce?  Was it in the limo?  Yeah.  Somebody picked you up?  When I wanted more?  No, a divorce.  A divorce.  On the plane?  When did you realize, wow, I'm going home and I'm getting a divorce?  Actually, that was about eight years ago, but.  Well, put it this way.  I was talking to Dennis.  He was looking for a new driver up here and I applied for the job.  Hey, there you go. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, sure.  I told him.  I said, the only thing is I don't know my way around.  He says, don't worry.  We have a GPS system.  So you don't even need to know your way around.  Look at that.  You dumped that naggy wife of yours.  Wow.  GPS.  Oh, what you could do with that.  Oh.  Yeah.  Get pussy soon.  They put us in this house.  Hold on, Bear.  Yes, that's GPS, all right.  Yeah, back to you, Bear.  No, they have a beautiful house here.  They put, you know, it was me, Joey, and another guy from Baltimore. 
[01:41:00]  60-inch plasma TV.  Gorgeous.  Gorgeous.  Yeah.  Fully stocked kitchen.  Oh, nice.  Now, so did you get, at one point, you pick a girl.  Yeah, she's sitting here with me right now.  Oh, okay.  And you go into one of these rooms.  Like, I'm talking about how I see it on the TV show.  Right.  And you go into a room, and she's there to do whatever you want.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So now, what was it like to have the company of a woman like that, after being with your 
[01:41:30]  wife, who just neglects you in that way for so long?  How, what was that like?  What were you feeling?  Very nervous at first, but let me tell you.  Not too nervous, my friend, I hope.  Yeah.  How nervous, Bear?  How nervous?  Nervous enough where you're ready to shoot yourself nervous?  Yeah, this girl, Felicia, she's the best, let me tell you.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, she is awesome.  Beautiful. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, drop-dead gorgeous.  Did you feel any, like, emotions for her?  No, no.  Just sex.  Yeah.  Just hoping you'd fall in love.  Me too.  Big catastrophe.  Yeah, just ruin them.  Cry all the way home.  Oh, Felicia.  I'm falling in a word, an illusion.  So you took care of business with her, had some fun, right?  Yes.  And now, how long did that last?  We were together two hours.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:42:30]  How long did that last?  Oh, the first one?  Well, yeah, you know what I mean.  I would say 90 seconds.  All right, look.  We got to do the math.  Oh, that's great.  I say it was less than a minute if he's admitting to 90.  I was like, I was telling her, you better stop, better stop, so don't worry.  I'm going to be here for another two hours.  I said, okay, great.  You better stop.  Oh, did the thought of that raggy, nagging wife ever enter your head?  Nope.  Not all weekend. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, what a brilliant, what a great Father's Day gift.  You guys had sex, you had a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  How many funs have you had?  Yeah.  Five.  Like, you've had fun about five times.  Since Saturday.  I know, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Were you only with the one girl?  No, I had three.  Oh, you selfish pig.  Oink, oink. 
[01:43:30]  I love this guy.  You're probably C-blocking everybody, just taking their chicks.  Get out of my way.  I haven't had it in 12 years.  Bear, have you called home?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  And how did that go?  To rub it in, I hope.  Yeah, how did that go?  So, like I said, five times.  You should have just left the phone off the hook and say, listen, honey.  He was calling home.  He was probably hoping that the police would answer and say, sorry, she slipped and she's  dead.  I have horrible news for you. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, man.  We're like drug dealers.  You know Bear's life's going to be a lot different when he gets home.  Oh, really?  Especially out there because you're not behind a warehouse.  It's legal at the Bunny Ranch and it's like the chicks are hot and they're not jaded and  miserable.  I've met enough of them at the comedy show when Dennis comes in.  They're all nice.  Yeah.  None of them hate what they're doing.  They're all making a lot of money, so they're great.  Now, Bear, what do you think, what do you foresee happening?  This is over.  You go home and now your wife is there and you're back to not having that type of companionship. 
[01:44:30]  Well, I guess it's down to, you know, you get back to reality, you know?  Yeah, but that reality, wow, that's not, that's something a guy can really deal with  after.  You know, definitely there's going to be some thought to certain things, I guess.  You went to the Disney of these places and now you're going to, you go home and, ugh.  Hey, it's coming in a lot.  I don't know how we say this. 
[01:45:00]  How far did you go?  Like, did you, uh.  What base?  Um, no, no, we know what base, but now we're talking about how dirty the bases are.  How dirty.  Yeah.  How dirty did you get?  Yeah.  Um, let's see.  Was, was, was any of this action that took place, did it involve, uh, not.  No barnyard animals.  No, no.  Did it involve not seeing the girl's face at the time?  Numerous. 
[01:45:30]  And, did it involve, uh, because I, I don't want that to be confused with the normal not  seeing her face.  I'm talking not seeing her face and it's very dirty.  Did he go taboo?  Taboo times three, I would say.  Wow.  Did you need a warm washcloth when you were finished that you had to throw out when you  were done?  No, I needed a warm, wet comforter. 
[01:46:00]  Good boy.  Oh, Jason from Rye.  Do you guys realize that Bear's gonna blow his kid's college money just trying to get  back to that first guy?  Oh, yeah.  The bunny ranch.  I'm already booked for next weekend.  Oh, they offered him the jet.  Hey, is, uh, did, did the other guy you with stay on the phone with us, but did Joe at  least have a good time, too?  Oh, he had a blast.  Well, we had a blast.  Good.  Yeah, Dennis gave away two trips, which is very cool.  Yeah.  Amazing.  What do you mean you're booked for next weekend?  Is that a joke?  No, I'm just kidding.  Well, you never know.  I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Like, how many times, uh, now, so far you've had five.  How many are you going for there, Bear?  I think, that's, uh, I don't know.  Maybe one more this morning before I get on the plane, because we gotta, we gotta leave at  nine o'clock, catch the plane back.  What time's your flight?  Flight, mine's at, uh, 1255.  So why are you leaving at nine?  Oh, 1255.  So why don't you try to get a couple more in, man?  I'm gonna.  That's four hours, nine o'clock.  How far are you from the airport?  Yeah, well, I'm quite awake now, so.  You're ready to go again. 
[01:47:00]  And were you on a trampoline last night?  You were with a girl?  Yeah, yeah.  Jumping around?  No, actually, I was, uh, by myself at first.  And then, uh, a couple of the girls came out to watch and cheering me on.  Oh, man.  Got some good pictures of that, too.  Yeah, you're gonna have to bring the pictures in.  Well, yeah, I can email them to you.  You know, the phone call to have is later on this week with Bear, after he's been home  for a few days. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's if I'm alive.  Please just make her smell it.  When do you get home?  Please.  Are you just rushing under her nose and make her smell it?  I haven't washed my right hand since I'm here, so.  Yeah, I wouldn't wash that, uh, any body parts for at least a month.  Hey, um, uh, any souvenirs, uh, you're bringing back to the kids and the wife?  No.  No.  Yeah, he, uh, he, he, he just had, he's bringing home his memories and his hatred for 
[01:48:00]  his wife.  Yeah, Steven S. from Bayshore, he writes, uh, Bear goes to the Bunny Ranch for two days  and all of a sudden he sounds like Frank Vincent.  Got a little Frank Vincent to you all of a sudden.  He does.  Oh, man.  You feel, you, you, you're talking like, uh, like a guy now.  Every man's fantasy.  You, you are a man like a man is supposed to be.  Yes, that's all thanks to you guys.  Well.  And Mr. Hoff.  All right, listen. 
[01:48:30]  It's a beautiful Felicia that's sitting here with me right now.  So you highly recommend the Bunny Ranch, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, listen, uh, we can talk to you for another 20 minutes, but, uh, time's a  wasting.  It's a wasting.  Time's a wasting.  You go, guy, go have another one, man.  I'm gonna.  Like right now?  Yeah, a few minutes.  After your morning coffee?  No, a couple minutes.  That's great. 
[01:49:00]  No, something a lot better than caffeine.  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying you should just miss your plane.  What are they going to do?  They're going to have to put you up for another night.  Yeah.  That's what I would do.  What a shame.  They're not going to throw you in a hotel or anything.  That's what I would do.  Well, they'll probably cut them off and say, now you got to pay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Got to pay to stay here.  Wink, wink.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you.  Why are you leaving so early for the plane?  If it's a one o'clock flight.  Well, Joey's flight's like an hour earlier.  Oh, Joey.  Bye, Joe.  So long to Joe.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Bye, Joey. 
[01:49:30]  I'll tell you how the last one was.  That's right.  Yeah.  Well, save the driver going back and forth to the airport, you know?  All right.  All right.  You know how dumb I am?  I almost asked him what airline he's flying, and then I'm like, he's having sex with hookers.  Why would I care?  Yeah, who cares?  Please.  Well, sir, I'm really glad you had a good time.  I don't know what you're going to do when you go home.  We're going to have to get an update from you.  Maybe after the first week he's home and it's really sunk in.  No, no.  By Thursday.  You think by Thursday?  Yeah, you call us back by Thursday, Bear. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  And maybe, Anthony, can you give me a number of a good divorce lawyer?  Yeah.  Yeah, hers.  Exactly.  No.  It was a great time.  I want to thank you guys again.  Oh, you're very welcome.  I'm not the last out of here, man.  I'm glad you enjoyed your Father's Day gift from the O.P. and Anthony Show and Dennis  Hoff from the Bunny Ranch.  It was beautiful, really.  Good, man.  You deserved it.  All right, Bear.  Hey, did you have to use any stimulants? 
[01:50:30]  No, no.  All natural, huh?  Yeah, this guy's been in that position where it's just, you know, he's been with some raggy  wife and no sex or companionship in any way like that that he wants, you know, he needed.  Were you impressed by your abilities?  Actually, I was.  Yeah.  Your prowess.  Actually, I was going to say, I was like, damn.  You go, kid.  You go.  You're having an outer body experience.  You're watching yourself having fun. 
[01:51:00]  I was like, good boy.  Good boy.  Look at you go.  All right, Bear.  Bear, we'll keep in touch, all right?  You got it.  All right, there he goes.  Bear, live from the Bunny Ranch.  I'm here a couple hours before he flies.  He sounds like he definitely had the time he was supposed to have and better.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Barely there two days, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  That must go really fast.  All day Saturday, Saturday night, all day Sunday, Sunday night.  A little Monday morning.  That's a lot of the sex.  That must go real fast, though. 
[01:51:30]  That must just be like, well, you don't want to sleep.  You don't want to sleep when you're there.  He's talking three, four.  How sad is he going to be when he walks into that house later?  Oh, miserable.  That's what sucks about this whole thing.  We'll find out.  All right, we got to take a break.  We'll continue.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we talk about what the hell is that next?  Yeah.  We really need to start pumping up this contest.  It's a great one.  We'll explain next.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, good morning to you.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  And Jim Norton.  It's funny.  Opie and I were just talking during the break.  And so it goes to me, Jim.  Huh?  What?  Why the hell haven't you done a book signing on Long Island?  I said, I don't know.  Well, if I don't want to talk about it.  And he said, God damn it, do one.  I said, all right.  So this Thursday, I will be signing Barnes and Noble.  That was believable.  On 90.  That was a very good acting.  Yeah.  Can I play your part, too?  I was like, Jim.  Jim, why?  Hi. 
[01:52:30]  Barnes and Noble on Old Country Road.  Carl Place.  Carl Place.  Yeah, you know where that is?  I know where that is.  It's actually close enough where I might drop in and say hi and visit my friend Jimmy.  Is it really near you?  Yeah, it is.  Oh, good.  I can stop by your place.  All right.  That wasn't very impatient.  Of course.  I would love for you to.  But it's 7 o'clock at the Barnes and Noble.  I didn't know that was by you, actually.  It's all right.  Cool.  Speaking of books, Jimmy's is doing very well.  Yeah.  And I read all the Sunday papers and you made all the lists. 
[01:53:00]  Did I really?  Oh, yeah.  I saw one list.  You were number four.  Really?  Yeah.  The Daily News or The Post here in New York.  They do the top books of the week and stuff.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And yours was number four.  The Times list comes out next week.  Okay.  I don't know what it was based on, but you made number four on this one list.  That Harry Potter book, though.  Oh, my God.  Dude, 8.3 million.  8.3 million in one day or something like that?  The first day.  The first 24 hours.  It's like twice as many as you sold.  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  Just for a second, I allowed myself to hear that. 
[01:53:30]  I imagine that.  Yeah.  Yes.  I actually outsold my book by 8.3 million.  No.  Jimmy's doing very well.  I hate that shirtless sissy.  We get it.  You're a wizard.  We get it.  Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.  Everyone does zap.  Zap, zap, zap, zap.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  How do we like that crap?  I am a shirtless boy with glasses.  Why can't you zap your corneas and fix them?  Stupid.  Why don't you give yourself some LASIK?  That's true. 
[01:54:00]  You're the wizard.  Don't be a wizard nerd.  That would be the first thing you would do with your powers, right?  One of those stupid glasses.  Iraq, if you don't take that goddamn naked picture of him down, I'm bouncing you from  the Paltalker.  Every time they talk about, anytime they, it's us.  It's our show.  What am I talking about?  Talk about Harry Potter.  He throws up the naked picture from Equus when he did the show over there in England,  and he's naked.  He has it.  Like, at the drop of a hat, Iraq can pull that picture up.  Of course he does.  It's Iraq.com.  That's what there is.  Hold on. 
[01:54:30]  For Fess Freddy.  Oh, that's not it.  Oh, that's not it.  Oh, boy.  That's not it, though.  For Fess Freddy.  Chocolate ring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oof.  Hey, uh, that shirtless boy is on top of the book world again.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring.  Chocolate ring.  J.K.  Rowling, I'd like to push her face into a toilet.  Chocolate ring.  I know that didn't rhyme, but I don't care.  Chocolate ring.  I'd love to do a book signing the same time as they're doing a Harry Potter event. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, would that be great.  Just to have 200 mutant fans and 10,000 just giggling children in their dumb costumes.  Hand them my book instead.  We're out of Harry Potters.  Read this, you little sh...  You little you-know-what-you-are.  You begin with an SH, and it's not good.  They just look at the back cover and start crying.  Mama Harry got fat.  Quiet, kid.  Chocolate ring.  Quiet, kid.  Mama Harry got ugly, and he lost all his charisma. 
[01:55:30]  Chocolate ring.  Mama Harry is zapping hookers with a different type of wand.  Chocolate ring.  Stupid Harry Potter.  What's it called in the what?  Harry Potter.  Shallow Howls or something?  He zaps a fat chick, and she drops 50.  Harry Potter and the Shallow Howls.  It looks like this.  Harry Potter's been under your skin all weekend.  A little bit.  I'm telling you, when I was creeping up on Amazon, I knew it wouldn't last, because again, 
[01:56:00]  you're competing with The Secret and all these other dumb books.  But I thought Harry Potter was unmovable.  And you knew it was.  And I just hate it.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's just that huge.  Yeah.  Whose decision was it to have the book come out the same time a Harry Potter book comes out?  It actually didn't matter, because you're not competing with him, technically.  I mean, it was fine.  I mean, I'd rather compete against that than like another, you know, whatever.  Well, Than had a little bit of news about the rankings in the books in the Harry Potter 
[01:56:30]  book.  Oh, Deathly Hallows.  The Deathly Hallows.  Yeah.  Okay.  The Deathly Hallows.  What are Hallows?  I don't know.  Hallows.  What are they?  What's up, Than?  Yeah.  They actually, they count Harry Potter as a children's book, so it doesn't make the New  York Times a bestseller.  Can you believe that?  You sell that many books, and you don't get it because you're a children's book.  It's funny.  I'm sure she's crying in her castle that's bigger than the Queen's.  Yep.  She's a billion.  Well, they're bigger than the Times list.  The bottom line is 8.3 million copies. 
[01:57:00]  It outsold the Times.  I mean, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't.  No one cares.  What are Deathly Hallows?  Oh, I don't know, but don't go near them unless you're a wizard.  I know, it's glasses.  Talk, let me, bring, bring.  Take off my glasses, and I'm not a good wizard because I zap the wrong things.  You don't get a chocolate ring?  I certainly do.  That was too wordy.  Please?  Nope.  All right.  Chocolate ring.  Harry Potter is a little douche.  Chocolate ring.  I'd like to give Hermione that first kind of pain. 
[01:57:30]  Chocolate ring.  Oh, no.  I don't know what Dumbledore is, but I hate it.  Chocolate ring.  What was the last one he did?  Because Harry Potter, the guy who played him, is 41 now.  That's funny.  Harry Potter and the DMV line.  Well, I'd like to wish him a very happy birthday today.  He's 18 years old today on Don Imus' birthday. 
[01:58:00]  Really?  Happy birthday to Don Imus.  Who is 67.  Look at me.  I'm like the birthday guy.  Yeah, it's birthday Monday.  You know why?  Birthday Monday.  Birthday Monday.  Because when I drive in, 10-10 wins at the local news station.  Yeah.  The local news station says, and birthday's today, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I pick up a couple of tidbits, like Don Imus.  What's your homepage?  Google Fruit?  Harry Potter.  Hey, we got DN checking in on instant feedback.  We used to be able to say his name on the radio, but now we can't.  Oh, no way.  Blank nozzle.  The nozzle?  Yeah, the nozzle.  Oh, my God. 
[01:58:30]  Why?  Wait a minute.  Oh, Hermione.  Why can't you say rock?  Or can you?  I don't know.  You absolutely can.  Douche nozzle?  You certainly can say that a nozzle is a piece of equipment.  Of course you can.  All right.  Douche nozzle.  He writes, Sir Anthony, will any of your casino winnings be handed over to that C, formerly  known as your ex-wife?  If you're just tuning in, Anthony is still on a winning streak with the casinos.  He went back to Mohegan Sun.  The last time he was at Mohegan Sun, he won $50,000 playing blackjack.  Most of you know that.  Well, if you're just tuning in this morning, he took Mohegan Sun for another $100,000. 
[01:59:00]  He's up $150,000.  He's officially a whale, and Mohegan Sun now wants to fly him on a private jet the next  time he wants to come to Mohegan Sun.  That's where we're up to.  As far as that situation goes, I just want to make sure everyone does know that we do  radio bits here from time to time, and the whole casino thing was just a bit.  What do you think?  I'm winning that much money at a casino for real?  Of course it's a bit. 
[01:59:30]  She is entitled to have that money.  How about when I lose?  Nice.  Oh, boy.  She is entitled.  She has earned a place.  So, where have you?  So, are you saying you were just joking about this?  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking. 
[02:00:00]  I was only joking.  I was joking.  I was joking.  I was joking.  I was joking.  I was joking.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Come on, everybody.  No.  No, I don't believe.  Oh, you know.  I'll have to check.  Oh, you know she's going to try.  Yeah.  You just know she's going to try.  Well, I don't remember.  We have more Larry King.  I was betting money, and I don't remember.  Oh, by the way, not to 18 years old.  The new one is Harry Potter and that dangerous driving test.  Oh, Harry Potter and the snooty voting booth. 
[02:00:30]  Harry Potter and the drafted and killed in action.  How great would that be?  But still can't drink.  He still can't drink.  But he could die for, well, America anyway.  I don't know what that would be.  He's killed by a falling, awful book.  Wave his wand as a roadside bomb explodes.  All right, listen.  What the Hell is That?  Coming back to the O.P. and Anthony show.  What the Hell is That?  Part 2 or the sequel, whatever.  What the hell is that?  This is an amazing, amazing show if we can get it together. 
[02:01:00]  What are we trying for?  A week from Thursday?  Yes.  I think a week from Thursday we're going to do What the Hell is That 2.  If there's something on your body and you're pretty sure it's not supposed to be there,  we want to see it.  Whatever it is.  Whatever kind of anomaly you have on you.  Look, we all walk around and all of a sudden something's going on,  and then you're like, what the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  A lot of us, we don't even want to go to a doctor,  so we just kind of hope it just goes away on its own.  Just leave it there.  We'll give you the opportunity to come in here with your What the Hell is That? 
[02:01:30]  We have doctors here, and they kind of look at you and tell you what you got.  They'll give you a basic opinion of a diagnosis that you can then follow up with a real doctor.  They basically tell you, go see your real doctor.  Yeah, yeah.  If you have something that's, you know, sometimes they can just look and go, that's nothing,  idiot.  Yeah.  How long?  You know, some guys, too, have had these things on them for years.  Yeah.  So you know it's not terminal or anything like that, but you're wondering, what the hell  is it?  What the hell is that?  The last time we did this, it was one of the best shows we've ever done. 
[02:02:00]  And speaking of which, because of that show, Jimmy quit smoking.  I certainly did.  He was so freaked out by some of the people coming in with their oddities that Jimmy had  his last cigarette that day, half a cigarette, because Anthony finally said, oh, just put  it out and start.  I was going to finish the pack, and Anthony gave me such a scolding.  He's like, why don't you just throw him out?  It's like, you throw him out.  If you are quitting and you're dedicating yourself to quit, don't say after this pack.  I had one more cigarette.  I went into the hallway and in NEW had my last parliament and then Esty from the Cellar. 
[02:02:30]  He immediately took me and got me the patch, and I have not smoked since.  That's right.  You used to smoke parliament.  And I think that's five years ago.  I think I was looking at old pictures.  I think it was 2002, right?  December of 2001.  One.  I believe it, because we were far off the air.  More than five years ago.  I was away from cigarettes.  Obviously, yeah.  Nice, clean lungs.  Yeah.  I had a doctor on my lungs.  It was fine.  That's awesome.  So, grand prize.  We got an Apple iPhone.  Oh, nice.  Well, there you go.  Second prize just for coming in, and you're also a radio star.  $250.  A little cash in your pocket. 
[02:03:00]  That's nice, too.  I'm going to throw some money in and make that $262.  Wow.  You know, if we see some real good stuff, we'll throw some of our own money in there.  Hey, you know how I get.  That's what we've been doing lately.  And third prize is $100.  So, maybe we'll up the prize a little bit on our own.  Or maybe the company will try to beef these prizes up for us.  But it's What the Hell is That?  We're doing it a week from Thursday, looking for some weird crap you got going on.  And you come in here, and we get the doctors to diagnose you.  We all laugh and have fun.  What is this? 
[02:03:30]  I got this in my ear.  Or they have this in my nose or my mouth.  Let me show you what's going on with my knee.  Yeah.  And then you go, what the hell is that?  What's going on there?  Yeah.  And then they say, whoa, that's a calcium deposit or something.  Maybe go see a doctor.  My favorite from the last time we did this was the guy that sweat.  Half and half.  Would only sweat on half his body.  Maybe hot wings.  After he eats hot foods.  That was bizarre.  Yeah.  I forgot what it was, but the doctors were able to tell the guy.  And it turned out that he was okay. 
[02:04:00]  It wasn't something that was going to really cause any major problems in his life.  So, if you want in on this, what the hell is that?  You can email Travis.  Travis at FoundryMusic.com.  We're still trying to figure that out, too.  What the hell is that, guy or girl?  Travis at FoundryMusic.com.  Or you can give him a call right now.  877-212-O-N-A is our new phone number.  Hey, can somebody tell me, by the way, what happens at the end of the Harry Potter?  Does he do?  I'm sure he lives, right?  Oh, boy. 
[02:04:30]  The last book that's out.  See, because they always do this.  Definitely Hallows.  The book comes out when the movie comes out kind of a thing.  So, the last movie came out.  Now, the book is out.  And, yeah.  How do you know this?  I'll be able to tell you tomorrow.  Dan loves the books.  I read the first one.  You know, it's easy to make fun of it.  It's a good read.  And the movies are really good, and they're getting darker.  The last Harry Potter movie was actually a good movie to check out.  Oof.  Yeah.  How many books are there? 
[02:05:00]  Try it, man.  How many books?  Six.  Seven.  This is the seven.  Seven.  I thought there were movies.  I'm sorry.  You like it?  Six.  I'm enjoying it thoroughly.  No, we're not up to six movies, are we?  I think there's six movies.  No, we're only up to four, I think.  What?  Oh, five movies?  Tell me a couple of the other character names.  Seven books, five movies.  What happened?  Well, then the...  They didn't make a movie out of every book?  Yeah, they're behind, though.  How are they that far behind?  They just are.  They have to find a Harry Potter that doesn't have a beard.  The guy's going to be freaking...  Exactly.  He's Harry Potter.  Well, if he dies, then...  They might have to switch out Harry soon. 
[02:05:30]  I hope so.  Yeah, because they've got a couple more movies to make.  You just keep rolling with that Hermione.  Yeah.  Wait, well, excuse me.  Than read 500 pages yesterday?  Sure did.  How long is that stupid book?  It's like...  700 some.  Oh, my God.  Pages.  What a queer.  I'd like to smash your face with your little teeny...  You'd probably beat me up.  But you have your little teeny nudge reading glasses.  He says, oh, peruse, peruse.  Look, Harry and Dumbledore have even fixed you. 
[02:06:00]  He probably has wizard glasses.  Of course he does.  And a hat.  Yeah, look.  Puts on his outfit.  He puts on wizard glasses.  Just to get into it a little bit.  How else you're supposed to read?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Ooh.  And his girlfriend walks in.  Oh, honey, don't make any noise.  This is a scary part of the book.  I thought you were one of the wizard fighters.  By the way, Dumbledore is dead.  He died in the sixth book.  Good.  I hope it was cancer that got him.  Him and Tammy Faye went ten minutes apart. 
[02:06:30]  Dumbledore, you look awful.  What happened?  Dumbledouche.  We got two Larry King clips to get to before we leave this side of the show.  Tell me the name of another character before I belt you.  Ron.  That's not a character.  Yeah, it is.  Ron, that's what they do when they're scared.  They Ron.  Tell me another character name.  You want like a very wizard-y sounding name?  Yes.  Sirius Black.  Yeah.  I'm just...  I didn't write it.  I just contributed thoroughly.  Dude, I'm telling you guys.  We're at the last couple of movies especially.  They're good movies.  The first one was kind of like geared more toward kids. 
[02:07:00]  Then they start getting darker to bring more people in.  The first one I saw...  I don't remember the first one anymore.  I don't even think it was the first one.  The first one I saw, they're riding on their little brooms.  They're riding on their little broom races.  They fly brooms?  And I was like, I'm done.  I'm done with this.  Of course you should be.  What kind of queer wizard rides a broom?  I wasn't into the broom race.  Do yourself a favor.  How about this?  Just rent the last movie because you don't really need to see the movies prior.  And then come in here and give you a review. 
[02:07:30]  I want to see where he stores the broom when he's not riding it.  You notice he's just walking around with his legs bent, sweeping up.  Stupid Harry.  Hey, we're not going to be able to play our Larry King clip before we get off the air.  Come on.  Tammy Faye.  Get back to Larry.  I mean, I've got lots to add, though, about Harry Potter.  We'll do it after the break, trust me, because we're going to enjoy beating you up for the next half hour.  It's very rare we get a chance to go after fans.  Right.  So we've got what?  Larry King, last interview with Tammy Faye. 
[02:08:00]  Of course, she died over the weekend.  She was 65 pounds on Larry King.  Everybody was horrified by the video.  CNN knew you'd be horrified by the video.  That's why they had the video to get the ratings up.  That was the only reason they interviewed Tammy Faye on TV the other day.  And we acknowledged that, and we decided to have a little fun with it.  Yes.  Here's our version of Larry King interviewing Tammy Faye.  What have the doctors said to you about how much time you may have left?  Now go home and get your f***ing shine box. 
[02:08:30]  What have the doctors said to you about how much time you may have left?  What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?  And you know that cool bastard Larry King made her sit through a commercial.  We got a short commercial break as your life ticks away.  Right.  To most people, it's just a break.  To you, it's a large percentage of your life.  What have the doctors said to you about how much time you may have left?  Pay off.  Could you pay up front?  All right, listen. 
[02:09:00]  The next clip is what?  It's too long to play here.  We got to get off the air.  Damn it.  Hey, I want to acknowledge 92.3 KROQ here in New York City.  They got Metallica today doing afternoon drives.  Oh, yeah.  The hostile takeover here in New York City will be with Metallica.  Yeah.  From 3 to 7.  And, you know, you're listening from somewhere else in the country.  I understand that.  Another reason I want to mention 92.3 KROQ today, they do something that's really cool  that I'm really into.  On their website, they have the O&A page. 
[02:09:30]  And they do a show rundown that is really, really good.  Al, who runs the dump button for us, he writes up the rundown of the show.  And he includes links of all the stuff we talk about.  So I'm sure today, you know, because we talked about the bikini girls like mowing your lawn,  he'll actually have that video you can click right on and check out for yourself.  So it's 92.3 KROQ.com.  Look for the O&A page and check out the rundown if you haven't yet.  He's doing a really good job.  He's a pretty good writer. 
[02:10:00]  So I just want to acknowledge that today, okay?  Right.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have yourself a great day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ah, welcome to the second half of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Yes.  Live.  On Sunset.  I think we're still being heard on XM. 
[02:10:30]  I don't know.  We don't have much contact with anybody at XM these days.  Yep.  Man, the contact drastically dropped off after our suspension.  Yeah.  They're down there in Washington.  Yeah.  Something.  We don't know what it is.  They don't know what the hell's going on.  That's just the way it works.  They get questions all the time.  Like, ah, yeah.  I don't know.  So is, I don't know.  So when do you think, ah, is there going to be a, ah, that's if we get a voice on the  phone.  Yeah.  Usually nothing.  The emails have dropped off. 
[02:11:00]  The phone calls have dropped off drastically.  Ah, the merger seems like a really good idea for everybody.  Let business just completely come to a halt for about a year.  And then, and then, and then maybe it goes through.  Maybe it doesn't.  Yeah.  But, you know, I, I imagine it's tough to like, ah, ah, run the business on a day-to-day  basis.  Must be.  Not knowing.  When a lot of those guys don't even know if they're going to have jobs down there.  Very.  They don't even know if they're going to have jobs in the new company.  We don't know if we're going to have new, ah, if we're going to have jobs in the new  company.  That's how it works.  Mergers are weird. 
[02:11:30]  Because everyone, there's things they want to do, but they kind of can't do until they  know if the merger goes through or not.  If the merger's going through, they know if it does go through, some people get the  boot.  Right.  That's just how it works.  But hey, Cardinal Egan has expressed his, um, uh, backing.  Yeah.  Of the merger.  Great.  Says it'll be a good thing.  So apparently, uh, the company's offered them a show or something.  Yeah, obviously.  I don't know what that means, but they're in cahoots together, obviously.  Something's going on there. 
[02:12:00]  Some weird background.  Cardinal Egan show.  The hell's going on in the back room?  Shock jock.  Anyway, um, and I did get an email from, uh, Don, Don Wicklin, and he said that, uh,  the permits were signed and it's, uh, full speed ahead on our brand new studio over at  the other joint.  Does he have, uh, did they give him the pointy stick in the garbage pail to go out in the  yard and clean up the garbage?  Isn't that his job?  I don't know what he does.  I don't know what he does there anymore.  I think he picks up the garbage out in the yard in Washington.  He just has a big stick with a point on it. 
[02:12:30]  Who?  Uh, Wicklin.  That's what he does.  I don't hear from anybody.  No one talks to me.  So I assume that's, uh, what he does.  Well, we do have a new picture because, uh, E-Rock goes over to the old joint every day  and takes pictures of our old studio and, and the progress.  And, uh, the last time we checked, uh, on, uh, the studio, there was two ladders, you  might remember.  And then there was one ladder and then there was two again.  So that was, uh, quite the progress.  Here's what I don't get.  What?  I've been on a lot of job sites in my day when I used to work for a living. 
[02:13:00]  Four or five?  Worked for a living.  Uh, yeah.  Four or five.  Could perhaps more than that, Jim.  Uh, there's nothing worse than a chair in a job site because it means someone is sitting  the fuck down.  And, uh, uh, my bosses, I know, and a lot of the supervisors on job sites will not even  allow a chair to be on a job site like that.  You'd be, uh, in the, in the area where you eat lunch or something, maybe, but usually you're  sitting on a crate. 
[02:13:30]  There's no chairs.  Why is there a chair in that workspace?  There's work to be done, not sitting.  I want that chair gone in the next picture.  Gone, I tell you.  But I do see boxes.  What's in the boxes?  Do we know?  The boxes.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight boxes are now in the old studio, and  I noticed that they're, uh, removing the mirrors.  Oh, zoom in.  Zoom in.  Zoom in on the boxes.  Let's see what the boxes are.  I want a different name.  Enhance.  Enhance.  They just look like file boxes. 
[02:14:00]  It says banker's box.  Oh, shit.  Here's what they're doing, dude.  What?  They've taken out everything, and now they're storing crap in the space they're supposed to  be working on, which means, you know, it happens to that room in your new house.  Yeah.  When you go, I'm going to turn this into like a den or an office.  I'm going to turn this into a media room.  Or something.  Media room.  Yeah.  And then you go, well, let me just throw some stuff in here for a little while, and you  know when you take it out?  The next time you move.  Wait.  No, no, no.  Here's why I think you're wrong.  Because they're expanding the studio so much that the area that these files used to be in 
[02:14:30]  is being worked on as part of our new studio, so they had to move them out of the way.  Oh, Iraq, is this true?  Is that, did that come from the area that's being worked on and is really at a very rapid  pace being turned into a studio?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Not at all.  Of course not.  What does the other side of the studio look like?  The other side of the office?  Yeah, we have pictures of the other side.  This angle stinks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Start getting like, you know.  Do a panorama.  There you go.  And I see they're taking the mirrors off the ceiling, which is good news. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, we didn't like those.  So they're...  That whole grid's got to go, right?  Yeah, that grid's got to go.  They're taking that whole ceiling grid, so the ceiling's going to be raised up a little  higher, and it's just going to be bare like the pipes and stuff.  It's going to look very industrial.  Yeah.  And they're going to put some cool metal stuff in there.  Another one, a little sectioned off area in the corner with like a yellow half circle  around it, where I can just stand in there and tap dance and sing la, la, la, la, la, la.  All right.  You want a la, la, la, la, la, la space.  In my own area.  Yeah, that'll be getting done.  Oh, here's the other side.  Is that the other side?  Oh, wow.  They got it.  Wow.  I see a bat of insulation on the floor. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I see more places for people to sit.  That's healthy.  It's exactly the fucking same it looks.  It looks the same.  And there is Ron and Fez's little closet studio.  Oh, my God.  I don't even recognize that anymore.  Yeah.  I don't even recognize the joint.  That's where they're broadcasting from.  Well, this was supposed to be done already.  Oh, please.  We want out of here.  We want to go back to doing the walk.  Yeah.  We enjoyed the walk.  It helps the whole rhythm of this weird thing we do every day.  Well, just in time for the walk over when it's zero degrees out again. 
[02:16:00]  Perhaps.  Well, but they said full speed ahead.  So today your update is there's eight boxes in the old studio.  Eight boxes that look like they have nothing to do with construction.  They look like file boxes.  And an office chair in there.  I think somebody is working in our space but not constructing.  They're doing like clerical work.  All right.  It's my new office, gentlemen.  Hey, Stoner Matt from Bayonne.  Ah, Bayonne.  As we move on here.  Does Opie recommend renting the bridge of Madison County as well? 
[02:16:30]  Bag.  I guess they didn't like the fact that you like the Harry Potter movies.  Now, one person is going to step up and say that the movie isn't that bad.  I'm sure here comes one person to step up right now.  I can't stand.  But have you seen it?  I just saw the one with the broom races.  That's like the early Harry Potter.  It was like baby shit.  It was like nothing.  Did they or did they not get darker then?  Well, I got into it because I actually, this sounds like I'm making excuses.  I had to watch the third one.  I don't need to really make excuses because I've read all the books since. 
[02:17:00]  But for Steve, I wanted to see if there's any drops we could use for the show.  Is there any young boys talking?  Yes.  And, yeah.  Sorry.  And so I watched it and I enjoyed it.  So I got all the books and it turns out they're good.  And they are very kind of, they get more mature and interesting as they progress.  Do they?  They make a good movie.  Yeah.  What was interesting about the one, the movie you're talking about?  Tell me something that was interesting about it.  That was, that I would like.  Well, they have, Gary Oldman. 
[02:17:30]  Why?  Plays a very.  Why are you falling for this?  Well, no.  Look, he might be able to.  I like Gary Oldman.  Gary Oldman is very good.  Yeah.  I would have said, no, why don't you watch the fucking movie yourself?  No, that's a very valid question.  He is setting you up, young fan.  No, I'm not.  All right.  He plays this, well, I don't want to give away, but there was a very cool plot twist.  I don't care.  Give it away.  It's all right.  Well, he started as a bad guy and he turns into a good guy.  Does he?  Yes.  But that's not selling me on the movie.  Gary Oldman was bad, but now he's good. 
[02:18:00]  I like him better when he's bad.  I like him when he's bad.  Is he like the cop in The Professional with a suit screaming and fucking doing pills?  That's how I want to see Gary Oldman.  That is going to be murdering people.  He turns his head and just kills children.  Yeah.  So what's cool about the third movie that I would like?  It was a good story with a good plot twist and I was interested in what happened to  the people.  You need something specific?  Like when I told you about Q&A before.  Like a scene like that?  When he was squeezing.  I didn't say this on Q&A.  Nick Nolte reaches into the tranny's panties and he goes, Sophia, huh?  Well, this must be a little Kotex and cotton balls. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, Lieutenant, you're hurting me.  And he goes, don't you come in my hand, you cocksucker.  I'll rip it off.  That's the fucking best dialogue in history is in Q&A.  Well, they don't have sound bites of that caliber.  Yeah.  When you said to me.  Jimmy enjoys dialogue.  Who wears my wand?  If someone said to me.  That's what you'd get.  Or any scene.  Hey, what was a great scene in Clockwork Orange?  When they fucking ding, ding, ding, dong.  When they walk into that, the guy goes, ah, I suppose you better let him in. 
[02:19:00]  And they rape the woman and they paralyze the man by beating him.  Good scene.  To I'm singing in the rain when he's slapping the guy in the face.  Very memorable.  Or the girl.  He puts a ball in her mouth and he's, I could tell you a scene I like.  Yeah.  What's a scene you like from Harry Potter?  When they travel back in time a couple hours and sort of interweave the two plots of the  two events running simultaneously.  Yeah, I like that.  All right.  That sounds interesting.  I like that time travel shit.  It doesn't do a little time travel.  Hey, ah.  He doesn't want to ruin it. 
[02:19:30]  Hold on.  Ruin it.  This could be a little dangerous for me, but I'm going to, I'm praying that I hear some  manly voices here.  Brian from Brooklyn, I like Harry Potter movies.  Let's go to Brian in Brooklyn.  Brian?  What's up, Hope?  Hey, Brian.  Totally agree with you.  Much darker.  I've actually seen some young kids having to leave the movie together because they were  crying because it was too scary for them.  Just from the opening scene.  That was a hole in the bottom of the popcorn box.  It's a wand, just like Harry has. 
[02:20:00]  Tug on it.  I actually was very surprised that they made a darker movie that was a little more mature,  knowing that their real audience is kids.  Well, the audience is probably getting older, too.  Yeah.  You think that's where Harry's 18 fucking years old?  Exactly.  Harry's naked next to a horse.  Let's go to Turtle from White Bag.  What's up, Turtle?  Hey, Opie.  I agree with you.  I had to take my kids to see that movie, and it wasn't that bad.  The final fight scene was actually pretty visually spectacular.  It was really pretty cool.  See?  No one's giving me anything.  I just saw that broom race one. 
[02:20:30]  No, the first two stink awfully.  Well, that was what?  Christopher Columbus?  Christopher Columbus.  Christopher Columbus.  What's his name?  Chris Columbus?  Yeah.  They just tried to cram as much stuff from the books without necessarily making a good movie.  And then he gave up, and then they gave it to the other director, and a lot of people  were thinking, oh boy, now we got problems, but it turned out now it's-  That it was good?  He's making movies that are darker, that are a little more interesting.  Well, is there a Dark Scene fan with Dudley Dursley? 
[02:21:00]  What's wrong with Dudley Dursley?  Dudley Dursley's a cunt.  Or how about this?  Cedric Diggory's on the scene.  No.  Is he?  I have one that will definitely-  It beats them all.  I'd like the shit in Cedric Diggory's mouth.  What do you think of them apples?  Which one beats them all?  How about a young lady named Bellatrix Lestrange?  Yeah.  Mmm.  I hope her big tricks is that she ties her pussy lips like a knot, because they're long.  Bellatrix has long labia. 
[02:21:30]  That's her fucking trick.  And Harry slaps him with the wand, and they laugh.  Even my wizardry cannot make these meat curtains normal.  My wizard.  Get back to those names.  Oh, Neville Longbottom.  Has he been molested?  He's right under Uncle Longcock.  And Neville Longbottom.  Neville Powerbottom.  That's right.  And then it's Neville Repressed Memories.  And Harry uses his wizardry to make Neville remember. 
[02:22:00]  He was not eating cotton candy.  He was, in fact, being raped.  Neville Longbottom.  Thanks.  Hey, let's say hi to Ryan in Georgia.  Ryan.  Hey, OB.  What's up, buddy?  I want to call and agree with you.  I think Harry Potter was a great movie.  And I'm in Georgia, so I have to be a closet fan kind of.  Ramon!  Harry Potter is a faggot!  Harry Potter has eggs!  Breakfast!  Yes!  Wow.  Thank you.  That was Lucius Malfoy. 
[02:22:30]  Was it?  No.  Tell me something about Lucius Malfoy, then.  I'd like to know about Lucius Malfoy.  Well, Jim, he's Harry Potter's nemesis at the school.  Ooh.  But don't forget the name of the school.  Hogwarts, Jim.  Yeah, Hogwarts.  I thought that was a guy.  No, that's the school.  Hogwarts?  Yeah.  What's wrong with Hogwarts?  I don't know.  That's what you get when you fuck carelessly.  After that observation's been made. 
[02:23:00]  Still funny, Jim.  He's still funny.  What do you keep going to this thing for?  Now I know how silly I look when I try to defend EverQuest.  Why?  Oh, really?  Yes.  Well, what about...  Oh, you said Ron was the guy's name.  Give me your name, Ron.  You didn't say his name was Ron Weasley.  Oh, I must have forgotten.  Weasley.  I like Hermione.  Because it sounds like Heine.  It sounds like Heine, and she's got a cute Heine.  Wait, what's that last name, Ben? 
[02:23:30]  I can't...  Phileas Flitwick?  Phileas Flitwick.  Fitwick.  Fitwick.  Phileas Fitwick.  Tell me something about Phileas.  Oh, he's one of the professors at the Hogwarts school.  Oh, I bet he's a real stogie curmudgeon, huh?  Is it Flitwick or Fitwick, actually?  It is Flitwick.  What does he teach?  All right.  Charms.  Look how he says it.  He looks at it and he goes, it's charms.  Oh, he does he teach spells and things of magical ilk? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, because they're at a wizarding school.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  What other classes are there in wizard school?  There's charms.  Potions.  Potions.  Potions is a good one.  Herbology.  Herbology.  Yep.  To the potions, are all of them delivered out of a long skin thing with a helmet on the  end?  And they say, if you enjoy this movie, here's a potion for you.  Boop.  Fucking Hogwarts.  Defense Against the Dark Arts.  Ah.  Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  But where do they learn the dark arts?  From bad people.  So somebody could graduate there from Hogwarts and turn bad?  Oh, yeah.  I don't like that.  How come there's no fucking wizard's name Ted Burns?  I am Ted Burns, the wizard.  Why do they all have shitty names?  Like, how about, just how about Professor Frank Lark?  Why does it have to be fucking, why does it have to be like Dolores Umbridge or Albus 
[02:25:00]  Dumbledore?  Hey, would you take a trucker's opinion on this whole thing?  Uh, yeah.  All right, Talon, Talon the trucker, he's a faithful listener.  What's up, Talon?  Well, it was a good movie.  It was better than the last one, but my wife, who's read all the books, pointed something  out to me that when it all comes down to it, and it's all about the wands.  In the first book, they made such a big effort in the book about when he got his wand, and  then in the fourth book, they had this whole thing, a chapter there for weighing in the 
[02:25:30]  wands, if Travis has the last book there, go to the last page of the last chapter.  Why don't you die?  And read it there, and it all comes down to the freaking wands again.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  How come, like, all right, who's Kingsley Shacklebolt?  Shacklebolt.  He's a large black gentleman.  Is he really?  Oh, yeah.  What's he do?  Shacklebolt.  Shacklebolt.  How sensitive?  Oh, Jesus.  He tries to apprehend dark wizards.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You mean, like, bad ones? 
[02:26:00]  Bad ones?  Yes.  Okay.  I was wondering.  I'd never seen the movie.  I thought maybe they could have had that.  How about this?  How about a wizard named Pete Hanks?  Why not?  Why not?  Hey, Jimmy.  Dr. Steve likes the movies.  Does he?  And you're a fan of Dr. Steve.  Yeah, again, that goes back to Hogwarts, because he's made his living.  Curing Hogwarts.  Curing Hogwarts.  He didn't know what it was about.  And Chuck in New York City likes it as well.  I love the Harry Potter movie.  Yeah.  And so did my boyfriend, Larry. 
[02:26:30]  How come no affiliates or services are calling in?  What about Nymphadora Talks?  Petunia?  Is there a Petunia?  How about this?  How about a Nate Stevens?  There you go.  Huh?  That doesn't sound magical.  How about this?  Oh, no.  It's that wizard, Charlie Burns.  Charlie Burns?  It doesn't sound wizard-y.  Oh, no.  It's Professor Ted Frump.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in D.C.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted an opportunity to make a small correction. 
[02:27:00]  Jimmy was asking who Lucius Malfoy was, and Dan's answer was that he was Harry's nemesis  in school.  Well, Lucius is actually the father of Draco Malfoy, who is Harry's nemesis in school,  and now Lucius is the next one.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So basically, that is stupid.  What's happening?  Oh, fan.  You didn't even get it right.  I know.  Who do you think you are, anyway?  Teddy Lupin?  I need my Harry Potter facts.  What's wrong with Teddy Lupin?  I just have you.  Everything.  I was right. 
[02:27:30]  I don't know what that guy said.  Ah, fuck him, then.  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah, who does he think he is?  Jimmy Peaks?  Hey, it took talking about Harry Potter to get these phones ringing.  That's all I care about.  Sonny Farrelly from Boston.  What has he got about Harry Potter?  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Yeah, my father-in-law, right?  He'll sit down and watch, like, Goodfellas with me, but as soon as, like, Harry Potter goes  on, he'll leave the room, because he's a very devout Christian man, and he feels as if  it's all, like, pagan religion shit, you know?  He'll go around the house with bosses, and, like, yeah, the kids, this is just the way 
[02:28:00]  to get the kids into Satanism.  Wait, you know what?  In Canada, when I was in Canada, which one is called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's  Stone?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, there's another name for that in Canada.  Why?  Not Sorcerer's Stone.  It's Philosophers.  Philosopher's Stone.  Oh.  Ooh.  I don't know that.  It's probably because...  I mean, they're sitting in church.  They don't like the whole...  Yeah, I'm just talking right over this guy, because I don't give a flying fuck what he's 
[02:28:30]  talking about at this point.  This guy is Sonny Ferelli.  He's a faithful listener.  I know, Sonny.  He's a faithful listener.  I play poker with Sonny.  All right.  Occasionally.  All right, Sonny, thanks.  All right, you're welcome.  Let's say hi to Chris in Bayside.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, hey, uh...  Horace Slughorn, you're on the phone.  Horace Slughorn.  Go ahead, Yaxley.  I'm sorry.  Dick Burns?  Chris, no one heard you.  Go ahead, say it again.  Yeah, don't they teach the dark arts in Harlem? 
[02:29:00]  What was the professor?  All right.  Why didn't he say it twice?  I don't know where he went.  All right, Narcissa Malfoy, you're on line four.  Why are you getting angry?  Because Harry Potter is the only normal name in the whole fucking series.  Harry Potter, his fucking...  His grandfather was a fucking colonel in Mesh.  The old red...  Oh, horse hockey.  My grandson's a wizard and I molest him. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, horse...  Shut up.  They're just keeping it fun for the readers with different names.  Well, then why not fucking call it...  Fantasy names.  Like, it's mystical.  How about this?  Mystical.  How about this fucking Negro cunt sniffer?  That'd be a fucking great one.  How about impossible to remember the fucking names when you're reading the book?  Oh, no.  Jizz Bucket Turd Burglar.  Oh, no.  He's here to steal my soul with his wizardry.  His wizardry is wizardry.  Oh, no.  Ugh.  Oh, no. 
[02:30:00]  Fuckstick Snot Noggin is here.  Fuckstick Snot Noggin.  What do you want?  I'm here to steal your grandmother's clit and I'm going to eat it and make a magical potion.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Oh, yes.  I'll defeat you with my wizardry.  Because I'm the normal named boy Harry Potter.  Little Harry Potter. 
[02:30:30]  That's right.  Do you got any other names there?  I'm sure some will come.  Any other classmates that might be of Harry Potter?  Yes.  It's Colostomy Steven Cunt.  Oh, no.  It's Colostomy Steven Cunt.  What does he want?  He squeezes bags of shit on everybody and they run away.  I'll defeat him with some wizardry.  Be gone, Colostomy.  Shut up, faggot.  Have a bag of shit on you. 
[02:31:00]  Because it's part of his wizardry.  That's right.  Your wizardry is no good against my firing shitbags.  I have the sorcerer's stone.  Yeah?  Well, I have a Colostomy bag full of shit.  It's part of my...  There you go.  Wipe your glasses off now, wizard boy.  I'm a wizard.  No, you're not.  You're a faggot with a wand. 
[02:31:30]  I'm Colostomy Steven Cunt.  Spelled S-T-E-P-H-E-N.  Like king.  With no hyphen.  I didn't know there were so many new characters.  Oh, it's amazing.  It's amazing.  E-Rock's bringing up a good point.  The sport where you fly around on your broom.  Yeah.  The Ant was a big fan of his called Quidditch.  Yeah, that was a Quidditch.  Quidditch. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that's what I saw.  And it was like, stop it.  It's like the fucking race in Star Wars.  Bunch of kiddy shit.  How to throw or catch the flying golden ball and throw it through the hoops and stuff, right?  And it didn't even make sense, the stupid game.  I couldn't keep track of it.  I was trying to bet on it.  Yeah.  Would you care to have a Quidditch race?  I can't.  My friend was Quidditching and he was killed by a drunk driver.  He can't be killed by a drunk driver Quidditching.  Yes, he was.  He was.  His little wizard boy legs were run over by a drunk driver Quidditching. 
[02:32:30]  You could be killed during Quidditch.  Not by a drunk driver, though.  Well.  Yes, he can.  He could be killed.  He flew into the asshole of a monster.  Mr. Longbottom.  Mr. Longbottom's asshole.  I'll stop you, Mr. Longbottom.  Let me use my wizard.  This is, yeah, this is the, uh, this is what you hear when they're playing the...  Is this Quidditch music?  Quidditch. 
[02:33:00]  Why don't you just Quidditch?  That's also a product that you put on your pubes when you have crabs.  Quidditch.  Do you have any Quidditch?  My balls are on fire.  And all the wizardry in the world won't make these little fuckers stop tickling my ball sack.  Quidditch will do it.  You smooth that into your pubes and dump it.  Dump it.  Why does this sound like Frank the Frowner?  I don't know.  I'm just reinventing it.  I'm Frank the Wizard.  You gotta need some Quidditch. 
[02:33:30]  Quidditch.  Oh, look.  I can almost see them Quidditching now.  Look.  That really sucked.  Not a big fan of that.  As far as Harry Potter.  Good little kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Stupid little kids.  Yes, Dan.  I just saw another name Jim might enjoy.  What?  An actual one.  Xenophilius Lovegood.  Xenophilius Lovegood.  Where's the nymph one?  Oh, look.  It's Andromedatunks at AOL.com. 
[02:34:00]  Pretending he's 13 in a little chat room again.  Andromedatunks was arrested when he sat there and ate cookies with Chris Hansen.  Because he brought vodka and condoms for a youngster.  For a young wizard.  Yeah, a young wizard boy.  Who does whirl.  Who does wizardry?  He says if you tug this wand, magical juice will shoot all over your face and blinds your enemies. 
[02:34:30]  Harry Potter's a shitbag.  Fucking hate him.  Such hatred.  How could you not?  It's fun.  Why couldn't happy endings take the world by storm?  Right.  There were children and men and women lined up to get this book about a boy being jerked  off by prostitutes.  And that's names like Jimmy Norton.  It's an easy name.  Exactly.  And Fat Girl No. 1. 
[02:35:00]  And Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  He's a wizard.  All things he touches become stupid.  He has a little...  He's half man, half turtle.  And the fucking turtle part he got were the feet for his hands and the brain.  Someone cast a spell on him.  They did the cloak of idiocy he wears.  You don't understand.  Yes, we do.  Child mentality. 
[02:35:30]  We got some more music for you there, Jimmy.  Oh.  Just trying to educate Jimmy on Harry Potter.  Oh.  Oh, no.  He's going to race around.  It's called Quidditch.  Quidditch.  The Ministry of Magic.  Music.  What's this?  Well, the Ministry of Magic is the governing body of wizards.  Oh, is this when you're walking around, uh, when you're walking around Hogwarts and there's  two disgruntled students, one each wearing a glove, shooting classmates? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, no.  That's not a Quidditch room.  That's a machine gun.  This is...  It's kind of faggy.  Of course it's faggy.  It's by the great John Williams, but, you know.  Who the fuck is that?  Oh.  Who the fuck is that?  Exactly.  Who the fuck is John Williams?  That was Tweety, you assholes.  That was Tweety.  Uh, John Williams did the music for this?  Uh, for the first couple, definitely, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I bet he didn't write that.  It doesn't sound very John Williams.  We're getting a smiley face from Dr. Steve, because we're trying to educate Jimmy. 
[02:36:30]  Harry has a normal name because he's a muggle, Jim.  Oh.  Signed, Dr. Steve.  What?  With a smiley face.  What's a muggle?  A muggle?  It's like, uh, yeah, he's like, uh, like, uh, like, uh, regular person.  That's one letter away from being a black character.  What?  Yeah, somebody who can't use, sorry.  Get it?  Somebody who can't what?  Somebody who can't use magic is a muggle.  There's wizards.  Well, what the fuck good is he?  Wait, he's running around here.  I thought Harry was a, no, but like you or me, if we were in this world and we didn't 
[02:37:00]  know about wizards, we'd be considered muggles because we can't use magic.  Yeah.  But Harry can?  Yeah.  Then he's not a muggle.  No.  Then why did Steve say he's a muggle?  He's a muggle.  He comes from, what, a muggle family type of situation?  Dr. Steve.  He was raised by muggles.  Oh, Harry's white trash?  Yes.  Yeah.  He's a mulatto.  In England.  Yeah, yeah.  Non-magical people are called muggles.  Yeah, just in case I was gonna, um, have any sort of pride when I picked up this book  that was delivered to me, of course. 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  Uh, it, it says in big red, uh, letters on the box, muggles, make sure not to open this  before, you know, X amount of date.  You're a muggle.  I guess I'm a little muggle.  Oh, because you can't use wizardry.  No.  I wish muggle meant people with AIDS.  Yes.  We're alcoholics.  We have quite a few muggles in this fucking organization.  What's a mudblood?  A mudblood?  Mm-hmm.  It's a half muggle, half gang member.  It's, uh, when, when two muggles mate and make a, a wizard. 
[02:38:00]  Is that what happened to Harry?  Yes.  No, no, no.  His, his, his parents are, uh, wizards.  His parents are wizards, too.  They're dead.  Well, wait, why is he a muggle?  He's not.  Oh.  So Dr. Steve was talking out his ass.  Well, Jim, this is what happens.  A muggle family.  Yeah, he was, he, his parents were wizards.  They were killed by Lord Voldemort.  Yep.  And, uh.  How did Lord Voldemort kill them?  With the, the killing curse.  No.  What is that?  Cunt?  Cunt. 
[02:38:30]  Cunt.  And I just die.  How great would that be?  He raises his hands up, and, and like, like the lightning comes off his fingers, and he  goes, cunt.  He used the killing word.  They all fall down.  And so then he was raised by his, uh, his aunt and uncle who are not magical people.  Oh.  And then he grabbed the lamb, and he tried to run, but he only got a little while, because  it was so heavy.  It was so heavy.  I don't, is Hermione a muggle?  No, but she is a mudblood, so she's half. 
[02:39:00]  That means she likes to eat pussy when it's on its period.  Mudblood.  She likes eating dirty asshole and period pussy.  That's a mudblood.  That's all I'd like to see on her, on her fucking panties, is mudblood after it's done.  Hermione, her fucking panties looks like the thing a soldier wore on his head in 1776 while  playing with the drums.  Mudblood.  All right, are we done with the Harry Potter?  No.  I don't know.  No.  I hope not.  Well, all right, we can come up.  If you want more information, I can talk to you guys. 
[02:39:30]  We'd like more information.  I think the more Harry Potter, the better.  The better.  You see, what you don't understand, Gregory, is because you're not involved in wizardry.  Wizardry.  No, that's not the word.  The word is wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  I almost got it.  Wizardry.  All right, we'll take a break.  Maybe we'll do some more Harry Potter carriages for a little Jimmy Norton.  All right?  All right.  All right?  Mudblood. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  Mudblood.  There's some other things we want to do today.  What's there?  Top commercials of all time.  Pretty interesting list.  Oh.  We got some big A audio from Ron Efez.  Oh, yeah.  I hear he was doing, like, impressions.  Save this for this side of the show.  A compliment box in Washington, D.C.  Gives you compliments as you walk by.  I thought you complimented boxes as they walked by.  Nice snatch.  Looks fat. 
[02:40:30]  Too meaty.  Do they have it at XM?  He walked by.  He goes, you're not getting fired.  We should do a bit.  Compliment box?  Oh, yeah.  We should do our own compliment boxes.  Absolutely.  People walking by.  You look wonderful.  Oh, why aren't we in the other place?  Because they don't build things fast.  We could have a whole thing.  The boxes sit outside the studio, and then people walk by, and we give them our own version  of compliments.  Yeah, what we consider compliments.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, they got to rebuild our studio immediately so we can get back over to that joint. 
[02:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  Tell them a little break.  Yeah.  I want to be.  That.  Oxygen?  Lethal?  Find out how.  Coming up on the Opie and Anthony show.  That piece of crap show.  It amazes me every day we pull this off.  It's a madhouse!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:41:30]  Talking about Harry Potter, some other things here.  You want to move on to the compliment box, and then we'll get back to Harry Potter in  a minute or two?  Compliment box.  This is so stupid.  Stupid!  No.  Down there in Washington, D.C., you're walking along?  I've liked the Harry Potter names.  Oh, we're going back to that. 
[02:42:00]  Well, I hope we do.  There's some writing going on as we speak.  Yeah, you could be walking down the sidewalk, I guess, in Washington, D.C., and all of a sudden  a voice comes out of nowhere, and it compliments you.  Usually a voice comes out of nowhere and conks you over the head.  There you go.  So where's your money?  Here's the story.  Wonderful city.  Yeah.  You stand out in a crowd.  Walking this street in downtown Washington, D.C. is leaving some local residents blushing.  It said people are drawn to your personality. 
[02:42:30]  Walk by again, and some say this box may even inspire a little pep in your step.  That box should be everywhere.  It should be downtown.  Most people agree with you.  See that?  See?  Most people agree with you.  It's been coined the compliment machine, randomly doling out kind words to anyone willing  to lend an ear.  I've had my moments, and I'm like, just turn it off.  But overall, no, I enjoy it.  One of my customers came in and said, it told me I smell good.  I know I don't.  I just finished jogging.  He was streaming sweat. 
[02:43:00]  So, yeah, people are having fun with it.  Are they having fun with this?  You're white.  What are you doing in this neighborhood?  I would leave if I was you.  Goddamn rich cunt.  I set all that up for the other side, see?  I was going to peep it.  Then I realized where I was. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  The machine is part of a larger, temporary art exhibit called Sites Project DC.  The technology is simple.  Inside is an MP3 player with more than 100 pre-recorded compliments playing every few minutes.  You inspire others.  It's really just to explore, I guess, the idea of compliments, how people give them, how people receive them.  Kind of like a fortune cookie kind of idea.  Oh, my.  You get it, and you're like, oh, yeah, okay, I am generous. 
[02:44:00]  While the machine is about as accurate as a fortune cookie, Greaves hopes its kind words will make anyone feel special.  Maybe the city likes the idea, and they make these compliment boxes, and they put them all around the city.  And then other cities might do it, or, you know, around the region.  Just kind of as like a public service.  Might do it?  No, I don't think I'm going to believe the box on the street.  You really know how to take a compliment?  Might do it?  No, we will do it.  We'll do our own version of this. 
[02:44:30]  He said, I can smell your cunt.  They should ask people, after they walk by the compliment box, do this actually make you feel better?  Anyone who says yes should just be put against the wall and shot.  Should be zapped.  This is a giant cock.  That was great.  Someone is suggesting that they should have Steve voice these compliment boxes. 
[02:45:00]  You're a woman.  You stink.  You have something called a vagina that I have no interest in.  Yeah.  Steve doing him.  Cockmeat.  Nothing but cockmeat.  And it just has to get racist.  It's amazing.  You should see the ones coming in.  Your pussy doesn't quite smell like fish.  Thank you? 
[02:45:30]  This is the dumbest idea.  It's like this phony, feel-good waste of time and money and effort.  What the hell is that going to do for anybody?  You can't say you believe it because it's all random.  It could be the worst despicable guy that just raped somebody walking past this thing. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  You're a wonderful person.  I know, motherfucker.  That's right.  Jesus.  Some just pedophile walking.  Yeah.  Some creep.  Still has blood on his hands.  You're a great person.  You work well with others.  Yeah, I do.  Maybe I should tell him where the body's hidden.  That'll get me inspired. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, boy.  You know, Les makes a good observation here on the phones.  Les, the trucker.  Les, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, ONA and Jimmy.  They took Jimmy's tender sentiment idea and made that comment box.  You know that, right?  Tender sentiments.  That's right.  This is the tender sentiment thing when you're feeling down on yourself.  I like a compliment box.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Thank you, Les.  Are you about a size 14? 
[02:47:00]  Would you?  All right.  What?  All right.  I want the boys in the ONA lab to make our version of the compliment box.  How are we going to do it?  Are we going to use an MP3 player that randomly does?  No, we have to do it live.  I would jerk off to you.  Oh.  Why, thank you.  Oh, God.  Can you imagine if we could reprogram that MP3?  Oh.  In that box?  Oh.  Why are we at the other side?  We could be doing this bit today.  You have cranky ass. 
[02:47:30]  They weren't all winners, kids.  Okay.  All right.  High fly ball.  It's key to left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I thought, sure, he was unable to reach it.  Yeah, I thought for sure.  All right.  Well, it's a dumb idea. 
[02:48:00]  Hmm?  It's a dumb idea.  What?  I dub it a dumb idea.  Why would you do that?  It's phony.  Yeah.  It's more of that phony, feel-good, fake shit.  All right.  Stop it.  We have a quickie from D.C. as well.  Ooh.  Got a fine anchor team from NBC4 in D.C., and they can't stop laughing at a video of a model  falling down.  Oh, I saw this.  This is hilarious.  I saw this on YouTube.  Yeah, the video's really funny, but the audio's just as good.  So they're showing a video clip of a model falling down, and the anchors just can't get 
[02:48:30]  enough.  She falls twice.  Yeah.  And the second time she falls, the reason they're laughing so hard, and I started cracking  up, her legs are wobbling like a newborn foal, and she's trying to keep herself up, and then  she just loses it and falls on the floor again.  So they just keep playing it over and over again and just laughing their asses off.  This is fashion week over in Paris.  The latest fashions are on the runway for next spring.  But there was a problem out there today. 
[02:49:00]  One of the British designer's shows had the difficulty.  A model fell down twice.  That's her going down once.  The young woman wearing that pink skirt and the orange platform shoes, never quite recovered  after that.  There she goes.  That had to hurt.  That was uncool.  That's embarrassing.  This is at least the second time. 
[02:49:30]  Well, you all are just feeling tickled by that, aren't you?  You try walking in those shoes.  Hey!  First of all, baby, I got enough meat on me that it's all right.  I'm sorry.  That was great about that.  He's got that smoking laugh.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:50:00]  The smokers laugh, man.  That's great.  And he was ready to say something like, yeah, we want to apologize.  And the guy goes, wait, wait, hold it.  Watch.  Because it was coming again.  Yeah, yeah.  They kept playing it over and over.  How many times did she fall?  Like twice.  She fell twice, but they kept playing the clip over and over again.  Her legs give out on her and start shaking.  And these guys just lose their minds laughing.  Where's the other one?  I only show her falling once.  Oh, they keep going back to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watch.  She falls.  Look at her legs.  That is great.  Oh, she didn't wobble. 
[02:50:30]  She almost made it.  She wobbled like three times.  They just keep playing it, too.  And the guy.  Oh, she took quite a ton.  Oh, just dummy.  Have a sandwich, you stupid ass.  That is damn funny.  Guys, it's losing it.  That's the most respect I've had for the news.  Oh, absolutely.  Wouldn't that be funny if it was a drunk driving story?  It ended in tragedy.  You know, that probably would be really good to take that clip of them laughing that hard  and put some horribly tragic news behind it. 
[02:51:00]  Can we get on that?  Yeah, can we try that?  We'll let our guys get to it.  We have some very talented people that use various video editing equipment.  That's a great idea.  Trying to see what we got in front of us.  Take them laughing and then just put some horrific.  Man charged with pimping disabled women.  He said he didn't pimp them.  The victims told police.  Sorry.  You have hair like Moe Howard from the Three Stooges. 
[02:51:30]  Your tongue is fat.  Big hands.  We'll go out to big hands in a while.  Can you put up some missing feedback?  I don't want to forget about big hands.  You have a fat tongue.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  Talk.  Now we got to play the story.  God hates you.  Now we got to play the story.  Now I wish I had the smokers laugh. 
[02:52:00]  Rocks aren't candy.  Your family crops you out of photographs.  Your mother drank during pregnancy.  Is that too rough?  By the way, can I interrupt everybody, please?  A hanger would have solved a lot of problems. 
[02:52:30]  You'll have to be cared for until you're 50.  Then you'll just die.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  I just want people to acknowledge I'm convinced that terrorists are burning America. 
[02:53:00]  When are you guys going to go with my theory?  It's going to take a little while.  MSNBC is now reporting that there are 49 large fires.  Okay.  49 large fires.  You're right.  You're right.  But look at the temperatures.  It's 115 west of the Mississippi.  If the terrorists have a weather machine that's doing that, we are truly fucked.  I think terrorists are burning America. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  49 large fires.  They just start fires and they're trying to burn.  That's a lot more than usual, man.  It's dry this time of year.  What will that do?  Huh?  What will that do?  I don't know.  You don't know what their grand scheme is?  I haven't fully thought it out.  You haven't thought it out?  You just think they're lighting matches and throwing them out windows?  This will put the World Trade Center to shame.  I'm just a bit suspicious.  That's all.  Ooh.  Millions of muggles learn what happens to their hero.  Oh. 
[02:54:00]  Right after the 49 large fires, they went with a Harry Potter mania story.  Fans of muggle.  Said so on his book.  Oh.  Compliment box.  Oh, boy.  You have the comprehension skills of a bag of oats.  One that could do magic is a muggle-loid.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it. 
[02:54:30]  Back.  One back.  Damn it.  A muggle-loid.  People don't want to eat food you've touched.  Ever.  You make noises when you should be quiet.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  You embarrass your family by going, 
[02:55:00]  in the movie theater.  You get caught jerking off a lot and don't seem to care.  You've killed all your pets before they were a week old. 
[02:55:30]  God damn it.  The cat is not food.  You tried to pet a kitten with a hammer. 
[02:56:00]  You couldn't care for a rock.  That's a compliment box.  Your real name is Eric.  Sorry, muggle.  Your body is 70% skull.  We're running out of steam.  I'm still missing the one. 
[02:56:30]  Do you know even our own crew?  Yeah.  Harry Potter fever.  I know they do.  Harry Potter fever.  Catch it.  All right.  Big hands from Stratford, Connecticut.  It has wizard names for everybody on the show.  That's exactly what I've been working on.  Yes.  Seriously?  Of course. 
[02:57:00]  Let's see what he has.  All right.  For me, Opie, he has my wizard name being  Javalog Von Mousekiller.  I like Javalog.  I called you Scab Hand Pickius.  I've been picking the same scab for a six months in 68.  I thought you were going to go with a nose picking one.  Thank you, Jimmy, for saving me. 
[02:57:30]  And then for Anthony, Anthony's wizard name, Dreamweaver Disappointous.  Well, I mean, that's not what I had for Anthony.  That's what I disappointed you got for Anthony.  I had addiction spiralous.  Yes.  Spiraling in.  Look who it is.  It's Fortune Vamoose.  Rick from the Bronx.  Gentlemen, your compliment box jokes are great. 
[02:58:00]  Ding, Frankus.  All right.  And for Jimmy, Big Hands has Dump Chest Yellow Rain.  No.  How about this?  Tinkle Mouth Underpaid.  What?  Underpaid?  I just know it was the Tinkle Mouth.  Are you crazy?  Tinkle Mouth is the important part.  You got others for other people on staff, Jimmy?  Name a person on staff. 
[02:58:30]  I'll see.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Fucks Up Dumpy Douche.  Dumpy Douche.  It was nicer than the other one I had.  Does he have wizardry?  Yes.  He's a boy who practices wizardry.  That's his good boy name.  When he's being bad, his name is Flu Breath Dumpster Gums.  And he'll practice wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  Than. 
[02:59:00]  I don't have one for Than.  Oh.  I didn't get that.  Faggot.  What else you got?  Steve, probably?  You probably got Steve.  Do I?  Yes.  Yeah.  Love's a cock fooling no one.  Oh my God.  It's love's a cock fooling no one.  Here he comes.  He wants everybody to go quercing.  That's when three potential interns are shish kebabed on his cock.  Would you like to go quercing?  It's going to help you get hired for this position. 
[02:59:30]  I'm love's a cock fooling no one.  Love's a cock fooling no one.  That's right.  Anyone else on stamp?  That's my good name.  My bad name is Ithias Foundry Stamp.  It's Ithias Foundry Stamp.  Here he is.  Love's a cock fooling no one.  God damn, Steve.  I only had a couple of more. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  Who else you got?  For Danny.  Ooh, Danny.  It's Brick Liver Sot.  He's Brick Liver Sot.  And oh my God.  Look, here comes Tom.  It's Bracius Fun Killer.  Bracius Fun Killer.  And where's our own Jared, also known as Fat Neck Blubbagut.  Where's Fat Neck Blubbagut to practice some wizardry? 
[03:00:30]  Here we go.  Some wizardry.  Can you say his name as he enters the studio?  Here you come.  Oh my God.  It's Fat Neck Blubbagut here to practice some wizardry.  What is it?  He makes a wonderful potion out of shit.  That's all he uses is shit.  Oh my God.  He's putting on his duty hat.  He's going to practice some wizardry.  Perhaps he'll use his wizardry to make his arms even out. 
[03:01:00]  Because one hangs lower than the other.  Like he's carrying a pail of spells.  But he's not.  He's carrying nothing.  But an almost down syndrome hairdo.  That he lugs around.  And a stupid Caesar beard.  Steve from A.J.R.  Steve C. is Swishy Fondlecock.  Oh my God.  Swishy Fondlecock is here.  To practice some more. 
[03:01:30]  Oh my God.  Look who it is.  It's Waif Mixerace.  Waif Mixerace has entered.  That's it.  He eats Gerbers and practices wizardry.  He makes rosacea appear on the faces of black people.  How does he do it?  Hey, they're requesting your dick is all shitty, man.  Really?  But isn't it, we built this city Monday, we kind of got rid of it?  Yeah, but you know. 
[03:02:00]  As we, as Jimmy makes up more wizardry lames.  Is this the better one?  Oh no, this is better right here.  Jimmy, I'll let you breathe for a second here.  Oh wait, we had the story of the man accused of pimping mentally disabled girls.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  We'll take a little musical break.  How about we go to break with this and then we come back?  Jimmy gave the people...  We're entitled.  Jimmy gave the people some fine radio right there.  Very good.  We're entitled. 
[03:02:30]  Once again, it's John from Fearless, right?  Ah, my dick's all shitty.  They were singing this fucking thing in the parking lot in Mansfield like crazy.  Chocolate Rain, this, all the hits.  You know, on stage we wanted to do the whole Chocolate Rain thing, but we didn't think it  like, we didn't think enough people knew about it yet.  Yeah.  Because usually it takes a little time for these bids to get up to speed.  And stupid, Preston and Steve went right at, did the same exact bit on Friday.  Ah, just, I don't get it.  Losers.  You want to fucking listen to that? 
[03:03:00]  I can't even, I can't even think of what to say that could make people change their  mind.  If you're listening to that show in the morning, I don't know what's wrong with you.  What?  And it's not, it has nothing to do with, it really doesn't have anything to do with,  okay, we're competing this.  I don't, I just don't get it.  I don't get how an entire like city of people can find any entertainment value in that.  Oh, well.  Preston and Steve.  The problem is we're competing in Philly, especially with the Opie and Anthony show  that's heard on XM.  Yeah, I know, I know. 
[03:03:30]  So you kind of got to help us out and support the local stations a little bit.  Yeah.  Please.  Especially in Philly.  We don't want them to get some dumb victory.  I'm not supporting the local station.  I'm going to just say that I, shut up already.  Fucking idiot.  Stupid message board guy.  They all talk like this.  Don't tell me what to support.  We're not telling you anything. 
[03:04:00]  Oh my God.  It's the message board guy.  Oh no.  It's shitty job hiding cunt.  Oh no.  Shitty job hiding cunt is here.  Oh my God.  Look who it is.  It's wannabe something else funny name.  Oh no.  Wannabe something else's funny name is here.  Yes.  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your ass hole. 
[03:04:30]  Dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your ass hole.  Say you won't know me.  I get in your face. 
[03:05:00]  Say you only take the cock.  In your dirty face.  Dick's so shitty from your ass hole.  Now I'm all filthy.  There's duty on my dick.  It looks just like a black man's.  But not quite as thick.  Your cooling needs a diaper.  And my dick's so shitty from your ass hole.  Because I'm in your cold and blue.  Now I'm a dirty handker.  And my dick's so shitty. 
[03:05:30]  My dick's so shitty from your ass hole.  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your ass hole.  Dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your ass hole.  The art of the homo. 
[03:06:00]  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chess Rockwell.  Smooth Lebanese arms.  He's tantalizingly tattooed.  A big books and bear.  Scurrying in every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chess shaved as smooth as a baby's bottom.  Tantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini steam. 
[03:06:30]  We're in Anthony.  All right.  How's everybody doing today? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Why are we coming back with this?  Especially on a Monday when we're fucking beat.  And now there'll be a complaint thread on a message board somewhere.  Now it's not even words anymore.  Now it's just various letters and punctuations.  As just like a little side thing, I came back and said we're a little beat because we had a long weekend.  So don't make it into a whole thing.  I'm on no sleep.  Sunday nights.  I was in bed at 7, slept all the way to my alarm, which is so rare, and still tired. 
[03:07:30]  I went Friday after the show.  I worked out.  And I had a meeting with my manager.  I had a nice dinner down here at Nobu, right below us.  And the guy that bought his company.  So a very big meeting.  Nobu.  I had two shows at the Comedy Cellar.  And I took a nap at 3.  And I slept until 10 o'clock at night.  But you were so rare.  I slept through.  I'm one of those guys, yeah.  I slept through everything. 
[03:08:00]  And I called my manager four hours late.  And he picked up the phone.  I'm like, David.  And he's like, should I order for you?  He's been used to performance his whole life.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's used to finding him practically dead in a hotel somewhere.  He's probably just happy that he wasn't going with somebody who was gone for a week.  You know, he had Robin Williams back in the days.  He had Robin back in the days when Robin was...  He's had him for 20 years, I think.  Or more than that, 25 years.  He's had Robin for years.  Did he have Robin Williams when Robin was hanging with Belouche? 
[03:08:30]  Oh, I'll ask him.  I'm sure he did.  Oh, man.  Those would be some good stories.  Yeah, he had Sammy.  So much for Robin Williams being on our show, by the way.  Remember, that was a whole top secret thing that was going on behind the scenes, and it  never happened.  Yeah, but he'll come back.  He will come back.  He'll be here every time, though.  Oh, great.  Yes.  Well, to be honest with you, I think that his schedule...  Like, there are times where somebody just can't do it.  And I think they tried to do it, but it's like, if someone's doing Good Morning America  or whatever, it's like, you're just not going to get them.  All right.  Make the choice.  I would say here on our show before there.  Hey, we got a couple things. 
[03:09:00]  Right?  USA...  USA's Today's...  USA Today's...  You ever see something, you're like, wow.  USA's...  USA Today's...  USA's Today's...  Whatever you want.  Thank you.  That's a bit of good news.  Whatever you want to throw in at you, go ahead.  Yeah, we're...  USA.  A little inside scoop for the people listening.  We just got massive, massive good ratings for New York City.  Did you just...  Yeah.  Didn't you hear our mood change?  So much for John Minnelli and his opinion about the ratings.  Screw him. 
[03:09:30]  You and...  Like my father said to me when I was a boy, opinions are like assholes, so let me finger  your opinion, boy.  I said, God, for free, didn't I?  People got to update their stuff.  Shat-tastic from Whackbag.  Opie, your Harry Potter name should be Opius Whiny Cunt.  Whiny Cunt?  Don't whine as much.  You got to update.  My God.  You got to update.  My goodness, man.  How about this?  His name should be Blue-Eyed Model Body. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  He would be...  That would be a bad guy.  Yes.  You'd be around and then the other people would try to get you.  That's right.  That's right.  I don't like that.  Or how about 40-inch or Loggius type of fucking horrible shits.  They're those healthy shits.  They smell the worst, man.  Fucking awful.  I had one today.  Oh, wow.  It's like a brown grain silo curled up on the ball ready to strike.  Fucking Indian charmer by it going,  Indian charmer.  Remember those fucking savages play? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Foot-a-little-loo.  Foot-a-little-loo.  Playing a flute or whatever it is.  A yak cock.  Foot-a-little-loo.  Charming a snake.  The only thing that keeps a snake away is the awful smell  from his unwashed, filthy, fucking village-dwelling armpits.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  And the snake's like,  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  The snake's like,  What do you want?  Douchebag and tired.  Don't give me more stuff to laugh about today. 
[03:11:00]  I'm going to laugh all day because of worms.  I'm just going to walk around the house and go,  I got some worms.  It's one of those things you have to say  because you can't say it like he does.  Right.  It's subtle hysterical.  So we got USA Today's top ads of all time.  We can go down that road a little bit.  We can do Manacuse of Pimping Mentally Disabled Girls.  I say that one.  It's a good one.  We got Big A giving his big post-surgery interview  on Ron and Fez instead of us.  I wonder what that's about.  Bastard.  We give him everything. 
[03:11:30]  Or we could go home early.  We treat him good.  I say we do to you.  Wait.  What?  What happened?  What?  Is there a...  There's no one in charge.  We can leave right now, man.  I say we do to retards.  We should prove to everybody.  Yes.  We should prove to everybody  that's listening to us right now  that we actually care about this side of the show.  I am telling you right now  that we could leave.  We could leave right now.  We could if we wanted to.  And no one is going to say shit to us.  Nobody.  Especially because we had the long weekend  with the comedy show up there in Mansfield.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:12:00]  So start writing positive things.  We don't have to be here right now.  We could go home.  That's right.  And we could do it the sneaky way  where we come back from break  and just go into some bit  and then it takes you 15 minutes to realize,  wait a minute.  I think that's a best of.  And then, too late.  We're gone.  I just played one of our cards.  How many times have we done that?  All the people know that.  All right, guys.  Look, you're tired, right?  Yeah.  All right, I'm tired, too.  This is what we're going to do.  Get a bit  and just play it right out of break.  And we're not even going to say  we're leaving early.  Exactly.  It's brilliant.  Half the people won't even realize 
[03:12:30]  that it's a tape bit.  Yep.  Beautiful.  Where's, uh...  It's the retard thing, though.  Yeah, man.  Do they have any other girls?  I want to hear that.  Every night, women walk Valley Streets  to turn tricks for money.  Nice.  But this man is charged  with something hard to stomach,  pimping out two disabled women.  That is disgusting.  One at least 18 years old,  the other 27,  but with the mental capacity  of a 15-year-old girl.  Police say both walked away  from a Valley Care facility  and met Dwayne Conchola  in the middle of May. 
[03:13:00]  Police say Conchola forced them  to turn tricks,  and police say they did.  Both of them.  We reached Conchola in jail by phone.  I never pimp both girls on the street.  My cousin introduced me to the girls.  My sister did their hair.  We watched a couple movies,  and that was it.  What?  What?  Was that the retard talking?  Wow.  Or the pimp?  All kidding aside,  what the fuck?  I don't know who that was talking.  That was the pimp.  The pimp?  What did he say?  Seriously.  ...from a Valley Care facility 
[03:13:30]  and met Dwayne Conchola  in the middle of May.  Police say Conchola  forced them to turn tricks.  Let's be close.  Police say they did,  both of them.  We reached Conchola in jail by phone.  I never pimped those girls on the street.  My cousin introduced me to the girls.  I never pimped those girls on the street.  My cousin introduced me to those girls.  Get out of here.  You heard that?  Yeah, I never pimped those girls on the street.  My cousin introduced me to those girls.  Yeah, yeah, I heard that.  I never pimped those girls on the street.  My cousin introduced me to the girls.  My sister did their hair.  We watched a couple movies,  and that was it. 
[03:14:00]  My sister did their hair.  We watched a couple of movies,  and that was it.  Wow.  You guys are...  I heard it too the second time.  No way.  Easy.  Easy stuff.  That's right.  Your sister did their hair.  See, when you live...  Why don't you put a bowl over it and just go snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip?  See, Jimmy and I live among the homies here in New York City.  That's true.  I'm in wonderful suburbia.  You pick up a little of the language, just walk in the mean street.  That's right.  The mean street to the Upper West Side.  You get me a Jew that you can't understand, I'll decipher it. 
[03:14:30]  UWS, baby!  UWS!  That's right.  Out of my way, bitches with poodles.  That's right.  Out of my way, old white lady.  That's right.  With the stretched out skin from the facelifts.  That's right.  They love them up there.  From the front, they look really young.  And on the back, it looks like she has a fucking flesh tourniquet tied around her head.  You better watch out, you Botox bitches.  That's right.  Jimmy and I are walking the street.  Move it, Asian eyes.  That's right.  Even though you're white.  They, like, shave off their eyebrows and everything and just pencil everything in.  They have no lips left anymore. 
[03:15:00]  They pencil those in or collagen them so they got the duck bill.  The duck bill, old woman puss.  Yuck.  You want more on this?  How could you not?  You pull up.  I'd like a blow job.  No!  All right, maybe I wouldn't.  You know you're going to get plenty of spit.  Make it feel good.  It's funny.  A half and half.  That's when you get a blow job and confused questions about cookies.  According to documents obtained by ABC 15, one or both of the victims told police control a force. 
[03:15:30]  Man, when you work for a station called ABC 15, you better work hard.  Shouldn't those ABC stations be in the single digits?  Yeah.  I don't know, maybe a little too inside, but ABC 15 is a little.  You're going to work hard to move yourself up in the cities.  According to documents obtained by ABC 15, one or both of the victims told police control  a force them to prostitute themselves.  He denies it. 
[03:16:00]  That is my force.  Nobody.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, I'm still here understanding why they're going to do that.  Like, why would they say that?  So does control a say the girls are lying?  Who knows?  But he says the only thing he can think of is that he insulted one of the girls physically.  This is what he said to his cousin.  I told him, like, oh, you know my type.  She's like, why?  And I told her, because I'm going to be real.  I'm like, you know my type.  She's that ugly.  You know my type.  And I made him leave.  And it's worth mentioning that both girls are fine tonight in area care facilities.  As for control, he faces two counts of pandering, and that he's expected to be in court. 
[03:16:30]  Well, she wasn't a very good prostitute.  She misunderstood the instructions, but she had to go out and have sex and then give the  pimp all the candy.  What the fuck?  He hands her up.  She hands her a bunch of pocket lint.  You know, I love our assholes.  Man, I love them.  Brian from St. Louis.  Opie, you have a great personality, and people like you put your great smile.  Here's something positive. 
[03:17:00]  The results of a test Jimmy took recently.  Brian from St. Louis.  Opie, you're somebody.  Jimmy, your weak chin makes people feel safe.  Are these positive enough, Opie?  LOL.  LOL.  So what do you think of that story?  Is he lying?  No, of course he is.  You hear him?  Yeah.  I don't know.  That probably happens all the time.  Probably easy to prostitute out.  RoboCop has something more on this story.  RoboCop?  The RoboCop?  Looking for me. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Click.  We get nothing out of them.  Old clickeroonie.  All right.  Now we got USA Today's top ads of all time or Big A post-surgery interview.  I want to hear Big A because I heard he was doing some things.  I heard he was doing some things.  Yeah.  Like he's going to replace me or something.  Yeah?  That's what I heard.  That's what I heard.  He's a fast healer, isn't he?  Dude, we should...  Did you see the scar on his neck from his tumor? 
[03:18:00]  It wasn't all pussy or anything.  And like I said on the stage Saturday night, it's amazing.  He told me during breakfast yesterday that the tumor was...  And you always have to say the tumor...  During breakfast?  Yeah.  If you have a tumor, you always have to tell people the tumor was the size of a plant.  And they're always the same types of things depending on the size.  There is a golf ball.  Grapefruit?  A grapefruit.  What's in between?  Baseball.  Baseball?  Like that.  Yeah.  It was the size of a golf ball. 
[03:18:30]  Baseball.  Grapefruit.  I think he said...  What the fuck did he say?  Handball.  Or something like that.  A handball?  Okay, what did you say?  Ping pong ball?  No, it was big.  A lot bigger than they thought it was.  Yeah.  And the weird thing is, they take this massive thing out of his neck, and he still has this  huge...  He has a big fucking pelican neck.  That's what they took out.  A fucking fish.  Yeah.  A rotted salmon.  All right.  Billy from Jersey.  This cannot be true.  He's got to be doing this for... 
[03:19:00]  Yes, it is.  Billy, go ahead.  Hey.  Hey.  I called for a prostitute once, and they brought me this retarded girl.  All she could say was, you can tip me, but don't insult me.  So I'd say, well, you want to do it doggy style?  And she'd say, you can tip me, but don't insult me.  It's a three-part joke.  Come on.  No, it was weird.  Go ahead.  Hello?  Yeah, yeah.  You got sex with her?  What did you do?  Finish. 
[03:19:30]  Finish?  Well, I couldn't finish.  She was so fucking retarded, I couldn't come.  And then the last time she said, you could tip me, but don't insult me.  And then you said, go-dunk.  That was it.  Sorry.  It was being set up like a three-part joke.  But apparently, it was a non-story with no humor to it.  We wanted to go to 11 today, but Billy just took the energy right out.  Didn't he?  Just come on.  You guys are the...  All right, Billy.  Thank you.  Let's do some Big A.  Big A post-surgery interview on Ron and Fez. 
[03:20:00]  We got some quick highlights.  They want us to do a Big A Appreciation Day.  Really?  All right.  Let's hear this clip.  You know what?  When's the Big A Appreciation Party that they're doing?  I don't know yet.  Is it a surprise or...  I guess I...  Do you think it's long overdue, though, right?  Yes.  This party?  Sure.  All right.  So, Fezzy, that'll be interesting when this thing finally comes to a head between O and  A and the guy who, let's face it, has got them where they've gone over the last couple 
[03:20:30]  years, and that's Big A.  Well, it does seem like they're on a collision course here.  Mm-hmm.  We should do a Big A Appreciation Day.  Why not?  We should.  Hire a bunch of wolverines to attack them.  I would appreciate that, watching it.  Why can't we just hire one of our wizards to do some...  Maybe Harry Potter could make that spittle in the corner of your mouth disappear with  a little bit of...  I want that as my ringtone. 
[03:21:00]  Okay, here's a...  Could you say, even though my real name isn't Gregory, could you just do something like,  Gregory, answer your phone, there's some wizardry to be had.  Gregory, answer the phone, wizardry's calling.  Pick up the phone, wizardry here.  Wizardry, wizardry, wizardry.  Wizardry, wizardry, wizardry.  That's the ring.  Wizardry, wizardry, wizardry, wizardry. 
[03:21:30]  Wizardry, wizardry, ring, ring.  Wizardry, wizardry.  All right, cool.  I'm going to make something out of that.  Thank you.  I've listened to Keith's over the weekend, the whole weekend, whenever his phone rings.  Ring, ring-a-ling, ling, ling.  Like he's just Jimmy doing some awful...  Ring, ring-a-ling, ring, ring.  Kara, my friend, yeah, Kara from Boston, she actually has the one where I did, we did  a whole bunch of, one of them was, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, pick up the phone, cunt.  I did that one as a goof, and she actually has it. 
[03:22:00]  You are an insanely popular ringtone.  Really?  Yes.  People love Jimmy ringtones.  They're ridiculous.  We missed a boat on ringtones.  Oh, give it away for free.  Why not?  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Part of the show.  Oh, my God.  Give it all away.  Give it away to house.  How's this one?  Someone's calling.  I hope they have a cunt.  Someone's calling.  I hope they have a cunt.  Or how about...  Cock and balls, pick up. 
[03:22:30]  Cock and balls, pick up.  Cock and balls, pick up.  All right.  I'm trying to...  Oh, is that a...  Awful one.  That's gonna be a favorite.  All right.  Here's one.  This is if it's quieter, and you have a little bit above vibrate. 
[03:23:00]  That's so silly.  We have officially entered silly mode once again.  Ringtones.  This is gross.  We're giving away free ringtones here.  Hey, no one's complaining.  People enjoy the silliness.  Free ringtones. 
[03:23:30]  People are big into the silly.  Why don't we do more Big A on Ron and Fez?  Time for...  Time to get hired by me.  Time for Big A to be taken care of by ONA.  As you know, if you listen to him all, he has been the go-to man.  If you'd like to see Big A full-time with ONA, doing news, whatever it takes,  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ, it is time.  Is it not, Big A? 
[03:24:00]  It is.  Time to get the devil is due?  Yep.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't mind doing a little bit for free, but he gets carried away, right?  And really, when people think of the show, they do think of you.  I love Ronnie.  He's just pumping him up.  Yeah.  You're right.  Pumping him up for disappointment.  For disappointment and never being on the show again.  Yeah, because Big A is somewhere in his head.  He's thinking, yeah, Ronnie, you're onto something.  Yeah, I'm right.  Ronnie's right.  I want to fucking suction out that mumps neck of his and fucking store like raw steak in 
[03:24:30]  there until I'm ready to eat it.  Like it's a giant fridge.  Just the fucking old mumps neck.  It's lucky we don't fucking lipo out that neck and store diapers in there.  Hold these diapers in case a kid shows up.  I want to tie a big cloth around his head and tie the knot on top of his head like the  old-time cartoon mumps.  Remember when the cartoons had mumps?  They would just tie this thing around their head. 
[03:25:00]  I got the mumps.  You know what I want to do?  I did.  We got to dress him up like that.  Yes.  Dress him up like he's got the mumps.  From 1940.  Remember a casino when they fucking Pesci puts that guy's head in the vice?  Oh, yeah.  I want to put Big A's fucking neck blubber in that vice and tighten it up.  Not that he's choking, just so his neck blubber's in a vice.  And then I want to just fucking, I want to like speed back, punch his face.  No disrespect, Andrew.  You know I love you.  I'm sure none would be taken.  But just to be silly.  Yeah.  Give him a good speed punch. 
[03:25:30]  Speed back fucking belting in the chops.  Fucking punch him until he doesn't stutter.  This stone typing guy said I had to pick up the phone cunt on my phone for a week, but  it got too embarrassing in public places.  See, people think it's very funny to have it.  And then they get around their friends or at home.  And then when that thing rings in fucking public, you will lunge for your phone to shut it off.  What was the one I had to finally bail on?  I forget now.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  Oh, man. 
[03:26:00]  That was a lot of fun until it rang in a bank.  How's this for?  This is perfect for when you're in public.  Mind your business, you dicks.  It's for me.  Mind your business, you dicks.  It's for me.  How about this?  It's my phone.  Your mother's a cunt.  It's my phone.  Your mother's a cunt.  Can you loop that into a ring?  Someone please use that.  Oh, of course they will.  Mother's a cunt. 
[03:26:30]  That's right.  Is there any way to get the dude?  Here's what you got to do.  Here's the goof.  You fucking get one of these ringtones and you put it on your wife or your girlfriend's phone.  Oh, yeah.  Most of them don't.  You got to fucking grab her phone.  How about this?  All right.  Put this on your wife's phone or your girlfriend's phone once you're sleeping.  It's for me.  I'm a dumb hole.  It's for me.  I'm a dumb hole.  Please put that. 
[03:27:00]  Or I have a yeast infection.  I have a yeast infection.  My boyfriend hits me, but I deserve it.  My boyfriend hits me, but I deserve it.  These all go on your wife's or girlfriend's phones while she's sleeping.  Just get her phone and put these tones on it.  How's this one?  Ringy ding ding, my cunt stinks. 
[03:27:30]  Ringy ding ding, my cunt stinks.  Oh, my God.  Please put that on your fucking wife or your girlfriend's phone.  Why do you feel like you have to bang?  They can't wait to get the...  Oh, how great will that be?  All right.  I've murdered my children.  I've murdered my children.  How about this? 
[03:28:00]  If you know someone who's pregnant...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  How about this?  If it's boring, retarded, I'll drown it.  If it's boring, retarded...  Don't tell them you're doing it.  Put that on her phone.  Put that on her phone.  Put that on her phone.  Put that on her phone.  Put that on her phone.  First one to grab my tits wins a prize. 
[03:28:30]  First one to grab my tits wins a prize.  I'm drowning.  Free ringtones here.  Free ringtones.  Free ringtones on the O&A show.  That's what we do.  Everyone else charges.  You go to a website, they charge you money.  Here's one for free if you know someone going to the airport. 
[03:29:00]  There's a bomb in my suitcase.  There's a bomb in my suitcase.  There's a bomb in my suitcase.  Oh, shit.  Put it on the fucking phone.  Put it on the fucking phone.  I have drugs in my asshole.  I have drugs in my asshole. 
[03:29:30]  Free ringtone Monday.  Free ringtone Monday.  Oh, I like the ring of that.  Free ringtone Monday.  That's it.  We're giving them away.  We could do alerts.  Hmm?  We could do alerts where the phone rings with alerts if you don't like a text.  No, it's, you know, alerts.  Screaming that there might be a certain individual in the area.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Today is put ringtones on your friend's phone Monday.  Yeah.  How about this one? 
[03:30:00]  The Jews are inferior.  The Jews are inferior.  They like the ringtones.  They certainly do.  Let's say hi to big A.  Big to the A.  What's up?  These are my choices of ringtones.  They really stink. 
[03:30:30]  The iPhone needs new ringtones.  That's the boner one.  The boner one's funny because it sounds like a boner.  That's only funny if you have a program to ring whenever someone calls you to babysit.  Big A.  Hi, guys.  Opie, Anthony.  Hello, Jimmy.  Thanks so much for taking time away from the Ron and Fez show to call us.  We greatly appreciate your phone call today. 
[03:31:00]  What are you, on a fucking washing machine?  A washing machine.  A washing machine.  It's a privilege to have a member of the Ron and Fez show call us.  Yes.  What's going on, big A?  Nothing much.  I'm just working right now.  Oh, big A, were you doing impressions? 
[03:31:30]  Unfortunately, yes.  Oh, you were?  And were you being told maybe you could take my place?  Ronnie was pushing me in that direction, but I could never take anybody's place.  Ronnie was?  Yeah.  I could never do that, ever.  Oh.  So you're going to admit on our show that Ronnie's an instigator.  Yes, he is.  Wow.  Bold statement.  I wouldn't say that about Mr. Bennington. 
[03:32:00]  But if you want to burn bridges...  That's all up to you.  Yeah, burn those bridges.  All right, we're going to play cut three here, replacing Anthony.  This is big A.  I want to hear something, I know.  On the Ron and Fez show.  Hold on one second.  Here you go.  If, God forbid, anything ever happens to Anthony, you feel like you could hop right in there  like you've been around the show enough?  Yeah, definitely.  But I would hope nothing against Anthony at all.  No, we know that. 
[03:32:30]  Obviously, you're insurance to that.  No one wants anything to happen to Anthony.  But if something did, and you hopped in, I'm not sure most of us would even notice it would  run so smoothly, don't you think?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  There's something about you and Opie have that chemistry.  Yep.  And I'm not saying it's better than the chemistry Opie and Anthony have.  Right.  But it's different.  Yes.  Sometimes it's even a little more positive.  Because Anthony can get into a negative spiral sometimes. 
[03:33:00]  Am I right?  Well, you bring a positive thing every day.  Yeah, I always bring a positive.  Even in here, I bring a positive.  Even though he has a negative, I bring a positive.  That is true.  What happened to the part where he's doing his impressions?  Yeah, where are they?  Is it the next one?  Oh, okay.  It continues with this.  Hit that one.  If Opie came to you and said, I want you to be a permanent member of the show. 
[03:33:30]  And I guess there's been talk, right?  I mean, obviously there's been talk.  Of course.  Yeah.  And it's gone back and forth between you and those guys.  Where do you see yourself on that show?  Fourth Mike?  Definitely fourth Mike.  You can't take Jimmy.  You know, Jimmy does an excellent job.  Right, he does.  He does a good job, too.  So would you say at that point, the third Mike and fourth Mike, equal?  No.  I mean, some days when, like, Opie's having an off day, you do some of his stuff. 
[03:34:00]  Some days when Anthony's not on, and you were bringing this up before, not every day  can be gold with him, right?  I mean, he's going to have his problems, right?  And that's where you come in.  Yeah, I guess.  But they do a great job.  Yeah, for what they do.  For what they do, they do well.  They do.  But where would they be without you?  I curse Ron and Fez today.  They fucked us.  We got these clips from Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  They are, I heard this part of their show. 
[03:34:30]  It was hilarious.  Yeah.  Where are the impressions?  Big A doing impressions.  Who cut this up?  Was it Earl?  Does Earl still work for them?  Do we know?  Who was it?  What?  It was Pitsy.  He cut these up.  Pitsy?  Pitsy.  Did the worst job.  How about Ron and Fez hire Big A to do Pitsy's job?  New name, Shitzy.  That's right.  That's what we call him.  Because he did a shitzy job.  Or Klitsy, because he's a cunt.  Cutting those up.  What the fuck?  Who are you talking to?  You rock?  We were able to get the point of what happened across by just telling it. 
[03:35:00]  We didn't have to play the clips.  Yeah, we didn't need to play those.  We said Big A was on Ron and Fez, and they want to replace us.  And then we get right to that.  Tell Pitsy.  What a waste of time that was.  Tell fucking Pitsy.  We want impressions.  Or Pitsy's going to get his fucking teeth kicked in.  How big is he?  He's huge.  Pitsy.  Hold on.  Who's on this other line?  Pitsy.  They should call him Mitzy, because he has a thumb and then one big fat finger. 
[03:35:30]  That's why he can't work properly.  Pitsy.  Yeah, what's up?  Congratulations for giving us the most boring clips from a really interesting conversation Ron had with Big A.  Well, I was just letting Eric know that there are more clips that we cut up, but he didn't give me a chance to answer the phone.  We don't need a lot of clips.  We just needed the ones like, we can set it all up with us just talking about how Ron was talking to Big A about coming on the show and replacing me. 
[03:36:00]  But then we wanted the examples of him replacing me, not like the whole fucking break.  Jesus Christ, Pitsy.  Your new name?  Shitsy.  That's right.  And Pitsy, you've heard the rumors, right?  What's the rumors, though?  They're thinking of, you know, cleaning house over there.  And when Ron and Fez clean house, holy fucking shit.  And if you don't believe me, just look at their history.  Every once in a while, they cleanse.  They're getting ready for another cleansing.  That's fucking Ron Stalin over there. 
[03:36:30]  Right.  What?  They're taking any impressions in the thing.  I just told Iraq.  I sent him an email now.  He should have it.  Well, that means we have to work past 11, and that ain't happening.  That never happens.  That's not happening today.  I said, did Eric screen them at all, or did he just put them on?  I mean, who did it?  Oh, so now try to get on Eric.  Look, I'm the first one in the fuck with Eric cheerleader club, but that ain't gonna work.  Eric?  Last week when he gave me these, he says, there's four cuts in there ready to go if you guys  want to air them.  Okay.  And I gave the list. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, they're all set to go.  We wanted the impressions.  They weren't in this.  Now he just sent me an email where these impressions are, and I have them right now.  The panicked email.  Oh, boy.  You know, Ron's gonna have to know about this.  Yep.  I'm sure somebody will call.  They're definitely ready to clean house over there, man.  Yeah.  You can hear it.  We don't put stuff on air without screening it, so I don't know.  Oh!  Oh!  So now we're assholes for putting shit on the air without screening it instead of maybe 
[03:37:30]  having professionals that work on another radio show send stuff over that we don't have  to worry about, especially on XM, so your curses and stuff.  So you're saying it's this show's fault for not screening it and not your fault for not  knowing what the entertaining part of the fucking break was.  Well, every time I'm sent stuff, I always listen to it before I bring it to the table.  Look, here's the deal.  I know Ron doesn't need advice from little old me, but I just want to suggest to Ron,  if he's listening today, that he just fires somebody. 
[03:38:00]  Just one guy.  You gotta lop a head off.  Just one guy out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere.  Yeah.  And maybe not even going with the obvious guy.  Strike out.  I think today's the day that Ronnie's gotta just look at somebody and fire them.  Just not Lily.  It might have to be Lily.  It can't be Lily.  It might have to be Lily just to shake things up.  Cute.  Exactly.  Can't fire her.  Does she ask about me, Pitsy?  And with all due respect, I know Ron doesn't need the advice, but I'm thinking that today's  the day he just fires someone out of the blue.  That's right.  And anyone's fair game. 
[03:38:30]  Anyone.  Except Lily.  I thought our guys here were good, or at least had the talent, the ability to pass the buck.  But Pitsy, man, you are one of the best.  Thank you, sir.  Not that it's working.  I see right through your bullshit.  And so does Ron.  And everybody else that's in any position to see it.  But you're really trying.  And the fault lies with you.  You should have known what we wanted.  Why would we not want Big A doing an impression of me? 
[03:39:00]  Oh, I don't know that.  It's in there.  It's in there.  Those are the cuts that were cut first, and then there was a second batch that were cut,  and it was in there.  So maybe I should have told E-Rock about the second batch.  He just got the thing.  But I don't see any fault on my part in this whole thing.  I see all the fault on your part.  I don't know.  Were they there for E-Rock to check?  They're in our folder.  So, I mean, I don't know where else.  Folders.  If you want the other stuff, you could have moved it.  Yeah, you had me for a minute, but you lost me. 
[03:39:30]  Why is some of that worse for Ron and Fez wrecking two shows now?  Two shows.  Thank you, Pitts.  Your name should be Earl.  Good luck, T.  Today, the hammer comes down on one of you.  All right.  I'm hearing from reliable sources.  Hope you make the cut there, shitsy.  Big A.  Big A.  Yes, I'm here.  All right, get your resume in.  They're going to be hiring soon.  It's very obvious.  Something's going down today.  I know it.  I think you've got a position over there on the Ron and Fez show.  Maybe not so much on mic, but behind the scenes, I think you're a whiz. 
[03:40:00]  I think, you know, because obviously there's a speaking problem,  which could do something on the air, but behind the scenes, producing,  getting, delegating responsibility, that's something they haven't been able to get,  and I think you're a guy that can do that.  I got it.  Yep.  I got a job for you.  Official food pocket cleaner.  Food pocket cleaner. 
[03:40:30]  Put his mouth over yours and suck it out.  Suck it out.  Yeah, the dentist told me I have a food pocket.  I've got to keep it clean at all times.  And then he doesn't spit it out.  He just squeezes it out his tumor scar.  All right, here's, I guess here's Big A doing impressions.  Anthony's impressions.  Oh, okay.  On the Ron and Fez show a few days ago.  So Big A is in studio with us.  He's one week removed from surgery.  Who do you really think does better impressions, you or Anthony, Big A?  He doesn't do the sound effects that you do.  Watch this, door opening.  Good one. 
[03:41:00]  All right, someone trying to start their car in a wintery morning.  It's very cold.  Seagull.  Good.  Helicopter.  That sounded like the other one.  That's also the car starting.  No, it's not.  Stop it, Fez.  Jet plane.  Here comes the jet.  I almost ducked my head.  That's also the seagull.  What is with you?  Seriously, what's with you?  I can't tell the difference between these things. 
[03:41:30]  That's right, that's right.  Is that a tugboat going by?  Is that a tugboat?  Good one.  You know what you ought to do?  Put together a tape for Opie.  One of them will be a real tugboat.  The other will be your impressions.  And say, figure out the difference.  And that's by looking.  What's with the difference?  What?  Uh-oh.  Is somebody shooting off a cannon?  Good.  Good.  Uh-oh.  A bus is coming by.  Hold on.  Is that a train? 
[03:42:00]  Woo-woo-woo.  These are all Big A's impressions.  That's not really a train coming by.  I understand there's not really a train in here.  Fez, I hope you don't get wet.  I'm about to start the sprinkler.  Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.  That's just you going choo-choo-choo-choo-choo.  That should be your train impression.  Fezzy, please.  I'd like Big A to do an impression of Fez.  Oh, nice.  Let's hear it.  Oh, hi, Fez.  How are you today?  Oh, hi, Big A. 
[03:42:30]  Oh!  Yeah!  A little gay, too, Big A.  No!  That sounds nothing like me.  Hey, Fez, are you going out with a guy?  Uh, no way.  Ah!  Fez can't even get a date, Big A.  Ah!  All right.  Fez, it's lonely, Big A.  I know that's enough.  That sounds nothing like me.  Oh, Fez, did you just shit yourself again?  Oh, yes, I did.  Ah!  No, no, you didn't!  Fez isn't hygienic, Big A. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, it's big.  This makes no sense.  This is the best.  See what happened, motherfuckers?  Yeah.  They were holding out on us.  Yep.  That was the get, not those other clips.  That's the fucking money right there is the money.  He gives a shit about the other clips.  At one minute to fucking 11, we get the money shot.  Uh, Big A.  Um, yes?  It sounded like you were auditioning to me.  It sounds like you might want to be a member of the Ron and Fez show.  Um, I'd rather be a member of O&A. 
[03:43:30]  Well, let me tell you, Big A, you didn't pass on one of the impressions.  You didn't say, I can't do it, or no, I don't think so.  You just bam, bam, bam, all of them right out there.  Amazing.  Yeah, here's the deal.  Uh, uh, a little punishment for you, Big A.  I'm moving you down the list a little bit.  Pat Rumunaki moves up one slot.  Pat's back up?  Pat's up one slot.  I saw that coming.  And Big A is down one slot.  Wow.  That's bad. 
[03:44:00]  If you drop as far as, uh, I don't know, who's at the bottom of our list, would you say?  Louis Twitchell Santani?  No, there's people loving him, yeah.  I would say...  There are people we don't name anymore.  How about my list?  Louis Twitchell Santani.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, is he annoying?  But he gives us good stuff.  Oh, does he?  He's a security guard.  Fucking tap me on my shoulder when he does.  Square badge.  All right.  Big A, uh, always a pleasure.  Feeling good?  You had a good time up there in Mansfield?  Yeah, I had a great time. 
[03:44:30]  I want to thank everybody.  Um, thank you.  You know what you do?  Talk, talk to, talk to Don Wicklin about a job.  Ask him if he knows anybody at XM.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, Big A, uh, the tumor is the size of a what?  A racket ball.  Oh, it was a racket ball.  A racket ball.  I said handball.  The racket?  Yeah, it's just in two quarters of a centimeter.  Well, that's why, see, the centimeter thing doesn't work with most people.  That's why you have to say the tumor was the size of a blank. 
[03:45:00]  And you did it perfectly.  And was it round?  Uh, yeah.  I think it was kind of round this year.  All right.  Ugh.  All right, Big A, you know, we don't feel like doing overtime today, so we're going to let you go.  His fucking chin's like a clam making a pearl.  A claw, a claw, a claw, a claw.  Would you swallow some sand?  Built a little pearl around it?  Big A, thank you.  Thanks, Ron.  I hope you have me.  Thanks.  Good luck over there, Ron and Fez.  I think you got a job in production or something over there. 
[03:45:30]  That was very fun.  Good luck.  Hey, uh, Flea Man, what's up?  Hey, guys, just when you guys were doing those ringtones, holy shit, I was crying.  Free ringtone Monday rules.  Yeah, we got some good ones that came in on the instant feedback.  Flea Man likes the ringtones, but he's still a douchebag.  Hey.  I'm still in bits.  I'm still in bits.  Hold on, a ringtone in honor of Flea.  I'm sure some of the message boards will like this.  Uh.  Flea is a faggot. 
[03:46:00]  Flea is a faggot.  Flea is a faggot.  Die, Flea.  Die, Flea.  Die, Flea.  Oh, God.  Oh, I think that might have been a compliment, too.  Oh, fuck.  Flea is a bespectacled cunt.  Flea is a bespectacled cunt.  I think he was going to give me a compliment.  Was he?  He doesn't know what.  He was.  Oh, my.  Oh, boy.  Poor little Flea.  Hey, I'd like to remove his glasses with a fucking fender. 
[03:46:30]  I threw that over to you, Jimmy, because some of the listeners were coming up with some  great ringtones for Ringtone Monday.  I can't do it in your voice, but one was make my rape fantasy come true.  Here's one for your wife or your girlfriend.  This will make her laugh.  Right.  I had an abortion.  I had an abortion.  Oh, my God.  I had an abortion.  Is it official? 
[03:47:00]  Ringtone Monday?  It is.  Free Ringtone Monday.  Travis.  You get them for free.  Going to make a little adjustment on the scorecard, yes.  And any time a promo wants to be made for this, feel free.  Feel free.  We need a promo for it.  We need a promo, definitely.  All right.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  It's, uh...  Ooh, we're in overtime.  I have a funny joke.  Shit.  How did we do that?  You got a joke, Jimmy?  Look.  I put my iPhone on my head.  It's an iPhone hat. 
[03:47:30]  You are so goddamn funny.  I'm very silly.  Free Ringtone Monday.  Yes.  Make it official, okay?  And tell Tim to make a promo with some of the ones we did already.  That's what we want to see.  Ooh, my compliment!  What is it?  Is this a compliment for me?  Yes, because you came over to the RV at Rascals Extreme Weekend, and you signed it for us,  and you were great to all the fans.  You were a totally awesome social guy. 
[03:48:00]  Thanks, buddy.  You often don't...  You really don't get enough praise, Ope.  You're the best.  For some reason, I can't hang up the phone.  I don't know what's happening.  I'm sorry.  I'm watching Fleeman on a pal talk.  Look at him.  He actually has a poster of your ass, and his mouth is against it as he's saying this.  You know what's funny?  I was over...  I was hanging out, and somebody gave me a football, and the fucking guy was like...  He was way out there, and everyone's got their... 
[03:48:30]  You can't do anything nowadays without someone filming it.  Yeah.  And I couldn't just drop the football.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  The pressure's on.  I lucked out.  I got it to him.  Did you get it to him?  I was like, man...  That would have really been pussy.  I throw a dud, man.  Oh.  Well, thank you, roughly.  You're the best, Ope.  Good evening.  Guitar Hero at PNC for Happy Typing Girl.  I didn't hear you.  What happened?  Guitar Hero at PNC for Happy Typing Girl.  For PNC, what do you mean?  What do you mean, Guitar Hero?  Who wants Guitar Hero at PNC? 
[03:49:00]  How is she?  How is Happy Typing Girl?  Wait.  They're doing Guitar Hero at PNC or something?  What do you mean?  That would be kind of cool, actually.  Let's watch the decomposition of a phone call right in front of our face.  Come on.  Go, Lee.  Let's watch it fall apart.  Here it goes.  No, she hasn't.  Here it goes.  He has fallen into the we don't give a shit zone, and he doesn't know it yet, and now  the call has fallen apart completely, and he just sounds like a complete ass.  No, I give a shit about Guitar Hero, and if they're having some kind of fucking competition 
[03:49:30]  at PNC, that'd be awesome.  But he can't really convey that, because he's too fucked up right now.  He's so nervous.  Your call is falling apart, Lee.  Go ahead.  Bad Flee.  Try to pull it together.  Happy Typing Girl.  She wants to get a Guitar Hero tournament at the PNC.  No.  I'm sorry.  I'm really nervous.  I just...  All right.  You suck.  We'll get the info out another day.  Please.  Right up to the exact bag.com.  There he goes.  He just hung up his phone.  Please pick up a pistol.  All right. 
[03:50:00]  Why don't we do a runner-up line of the day?  Colostomy Steven Cunt.  Oh, no.  It's Colostomy Steven Cunt.  What does he want?  He squeezes bags of shit on everybody, and they run away.  I'll just feed him with some wizardry.  Wizardry.  I don't know how he does it.  It's easy.  You just have to think.  I have a wand.  I'm going to perform some magic and wizardry. 
[03:50:30]  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  It's fun to say.  It is very fun.  Wizardry.  It just feels right.  Another runner-up line of the day?  I think it's time.  So what happens?  You're fooling around in the car.  Do you get to the ranch?  What do you do?  We met Dennis, and we met a bunch of the girls, and the show, they gave us a tour.  Did they have to call up the wolf to clean out the car after you guys were done?  I went to Anthony.  I had my pen out and everything. 
[03:51:00]  Why?  Because I write down gold stars if I get in on this competition.  Oh, gold stars.  But your pen's not gold.  Why don't we just get you a little thing of stickers with gold stars?  I have them at home.  Because no one really cares enough to do that for me, so I make my own gold stars if I make it into the runner-up line of the day.  Or line of the day, I get a few gold stars and a smiley face.  My girlfriend gives me a gold star whenever I make her cum.  If I make her cum, I get a gold star in the fridge.  Oh, by the way, Mike in Jersey, I didn't even know this. 
[03:51:30]  Ope, you really did luck out because your football clip is already up on YouTube.  Oh, it is.  So it would have been like me looking completely like an ass.  It's time for your line of the day.  Yes.  Here comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of the day.  Steve, probably.  You probably got Steve.  Do I? 
[03:52:00]  Yes.  Loves the cock fooling no one.  Oh, my God.  It's Loves the cock fooling no one.  Here he comes.  He wants everybody to go querching.  That's when three potential interns are shish kebabed on his cock.  Would you like to go querching?  It's going to help you get hired for this position.  Yes.  That was definitely the line of the day.  Wow.  Very funny.  A fun-filled day.  I'll say it was. 
[03:52:30]  Certainly.  What are we promoting?  We're promoting Jimmy's book signing Carl Place Thursday night, right?  Yeah, Barnes & Noble.  I wanted to do one in Long Island because I did not have the book available, Happy Endings,  when we did the Jones Beach Show.  So I got emails from Long Island.

Don't you hate people that use big words at wrong times?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I'll be signing there, but if you get there, there's going to be some traffic, but  I'll have pens.  Allegedly, we were going to go there.  What?  Allegedly, I had a joke planned, and it fell apart.  For the scorecard people, we got rid of...  We built this city Monday.  Yep.
