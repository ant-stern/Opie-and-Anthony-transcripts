<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a humorous recounting of a disastrous GoToMeeting presentation with SiriusXM representatives.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, detailed the incompetence of a SiriusXM employee who failed to realize a webcam was necessary for the video conference, much to the chagrin of the GoToMeeting team.  They contrasted their professional demeanor in such meetings with their on-air personalities, using the incident as a recurring joke highlighting the disparity. The show then shifted to a serious discussion of the Boston Marathon bombing.  They analyzed released images of the pressure cooker bombs, criticizing the blurring of post-explosion photos as obscuring crucial evidence while still displaying graphic victim injuries. The hosts discussed the initial focus on a Saudi suspect, his subsequent exoneration, and the shift in the investigation toward a white man in his thirties.  They speculated on the bomber's motivations and the suboptimal placement of the bombs. They also mocked the media's over-the-top reaction to the Yankees playing "Sweet Caroline." A clip of an interview with the roommate of a Saudi suspect, repeatedly pleading to go to school, was played.

The show continued with further discussion of the Boston bombing, including Obama's initial statement, the discovery of ricin in the Congressional Post Office, and criticism of Mayor Menino's unclear press conference.  They also commented on a Family Guy clip controversy involving Seth MacFarlane.  A lengthy discussion ensued about pressure cookers and their function in the bombing, with a caller correcting the hosts' initial misunderstandings.  The conversation then turned to Pat Summerall's death, leading to the playing of a John Madden and Pat Summerall commentary clip and anecdotes about Madden.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to showcasing and discussing the incredibly accurate Sopranos character impressions by the YouTube user "Bowler Hat."  Grape Cheeks, an in-studio comedian, made a brief appearance.

The next segment heavily focused on the Boston Marathon bombing aftermath, with an unidentified in-studio guest joining the discussion.  The hosts and guest speculated on the perpetrator's identity, ranging from a lone individual to a larger conspiracy. The conversation frequently veered into discussions of other tragedies, like the Sandy Hook shooting, and related conspiracy theories, including suggestions of hoaxes or government cover-ups. They also discussed the media and public reactions to these events and the perceived desensitization to tragedy.  International relations and the US's alliances with countries with questionable human rights records were touched upon.

A significant part of this section involved a phone call with Alex Jones, who presented his "false flag" theory regarding the bombing, linking it to increased security measures and the erosion of civil liberties.  Jones discussed broader conspiracy theories, government control, the military-industrial complex, media manipulation, and his personal experiences. A heated exchange occurred between Jones and a caller, Lindsey, who vehemently disagreed with his misinformation about a friend injured in the bombing.  The discussion continued, focusing on government power, civil liberties, and the TSA, with highly offensive language used throughout.

The Alex Jones interview continued into the next segment, where he further elaborated on his conspiracy theories, citing examples like the Gulf of Tonkin incident, opium cultivation in Afghanistan, the anthrax attacks, and the use of propaganda in media, including Geico commercials.  The hosts and a caller debated the validity of Jones' claims.  Operation Northwood was discussed.  Following Jones, Rich Voss joined the show to discuss his stand-up comedy and a film screening.  Jim Norton then hosted his advice segment, answering various caller questions about dating issues, sex, weight, and relationships, including a caller's concerns about premature ejaculation due to excessive masturbation while watching porn, and another's question about the appropriateness of simultaneous anal and oral sex.  A list summarizing Jones’ key points was presented.  The economic climate and low interest rates were also discussed. The show concluded with Jim Norton’s advice segment, where various callers sought help with their relationship and personal issues.  He discussed topics like dealing with neighbors, impact of weight on a career, an eye twitch, and the challenges of maintaining a sponsor/sponsee relationship in a 12-step program while experiencing mutual attraction. The expected guest, Bailey J, couldn’t make it due to her husband's jury duty. A discussion on the difference between covering other comedians' acts and cover bands ended the show.  A commercial for Stephen Singer's gold-dipped roses and a discussion on weight loss methods were also included.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  How's Q?  How can I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If someone finds this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  If they're being on any show, they swear and they're vulgar  and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies. 
[00:01:00]  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Enough of this palaver! 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi!  Hi, people out there.  Radio land.  I like radio land.  Radio land, huh?  It's where everyone lives that isn't in here right now. 
[00:02:00]  We're out in radio land.  Radio land.  Hi.  Hi.  Last we left you.  Yes.  We're on our way to a meeting.  Yep.  It was a terrific meeting.  It was great.  I want to thank the fine people at GoToMeeting.  Yes.  For putting up with the incompetence that is SiriusXM.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  We should talk about it.  Oh, no.  Me and Anthony have been laughing about it. 
[00:02:30]  We were laughing in the garage for about 10 minutes waiting for cars and shit.  And then as soon as we got in here, we were laughing about it.  It's, uh...  See, we come across like we don't give a fuck and we don't work hard and all that crap and  make your jokes.  But the fact is that we give too...  We care too much.  And we're around people that don't give a fuck about their jobs or they're incompetent  and not qualified to do their jobs.  You don't mean me, do you?  Yes.  Jimmy.  To make it simple, you know, we had this meeting. 
[00:03:00]  We hate doing meetings with clients.  But if we're going to do a meeting with a client, we're all in.  Oh, we look like fucking superstars.  Well, you gotta, you know, keep them happy.  We look like company fucking guys when we're in these meetings.  They're the, you know, the bread and butter, as they say.  You gotta keep them happy, you know.  You gotta give them what they want is what it is.  Right.  We'll bitch and complain and all that.  But you get us in a room with a client, they're not going to know any of this.  Until today, because we have to now beat up a couple people that work for SiriusXM. 
[00:03:30]  So we're meeting with the big guys from GoToMeeting.com.  What is it?  It's like online meetings.  It's amazing.  It's webcams.  It's, look, I'm going to take over your fucking computer for a little while.  Everyone's got a desktop on their computer.  There's a video screen where you're seeing video, HD video of people.  But also you could go, hey, Bob, why don't you take the old mouse-a-rooney? 
[00:04:00]  Right.  And now you show what you got on your computer.  Right.  And then all of a sudden you could click and now show your documents to everyone on there  as you're video conferencing with someone.  So it's not just video, like looking at everyone waving and jacking off or whatever the fuck  they do on everything else, like Peltog here in front of me.  You know, you could show your documents, show everything on your computer.  And then the next guy that's in another fucking in Tokyo can grab his mouse and manipulate  the exact same screen you're seeing.  So it was pretty cool. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  And they wanted to actually show it and demonstrate it in this meeting.  That was the whole purpose of the meeting.  Yeah.  Was not to do the conference call that we do with everyone else.  Right.  It's like, look, we're going to do this conference call meeting with you, but we're going to do  it through go to meetings.  So, so, so you under, so me and aunt understand what they're all about.  So when we do the live read, we sound like we're, we were, you know, knowledgeable, you  know, the product.  Right.  So we walk into our office right off the bat. 
[00:05:00]  We walk into our office and the go to meeting guys, this is their entire world.  This is all they care about.  Like we care about the opiate Anthony show in their little world.  This is all they give a fuck about.  And they're so excited to kind of show us what their, their company can do.  So we see the guy on the computer.  I think his name was Michael.  Yeah.  His name's Michael.  And there he is in wherever.  I think he might've been, um, on the West coast somewhere, you know, widescreen HD and  he's in his apartment or his house.  Like, see, I'm having a meeting with you guys right here in my apartment. 
[00:05:30]  And then he asks, so, um, turn on your webcam on your webcam.  And that's when the fucking dummy from Sirius XM goes, Oh, I didn't know we needed a webcam.  We don't have a webcam.  Look at Jimmy.  This is why we have to talk about it.  It's like, that was the whole purpose of this meeting.  She goes, Oh, I didn't realize we needed a webcam.  But then why would we be talking to this guy?  But how would they not, how would, how would Sirius not know that? 
[00:06:00]  The whole gist of go to meeting is that you can see each other and exchange it ideas and  stuff and, and, and, and to have the camera and the meeting that we had was to show that  you don't have to meet on the phone with a conference call.  You could do it over the computer with go to meeting.  So this dummy goes, I didn't realize we needed a webcam.  I'm like, you're representing Austin Sirius XM right now.  And like I said, we're, we're over the top professionals in the end. 
[00:06:30]  Believe me, we are, but that doesn't make fun radio.  We like to fucking break shit down and bitch and complain and all that.  But in the end, you know, we get how all this shit works, all the moving parts.  We understand.  So she goes, Oh, I didn't realize.  And you could see the disappointment on the guy's face.  Cause that's great.  It's HD video where you could literally see the disappointment in the man's face.  You could literally see him stop talking and look into the camera.  Like what?  He didn't have to say a word. 
[00:07:00]  His expression alone.  The crinkle in his brow.  He was so, he was bummed, but being cool.  Cause he's, cause you know, he's excited to be working with our radio show and the, I guess  the company, I, you know, that's up to him.  But I, you know, he's excited to be working with us.  I felt bad.  But you could see it.  And he's like, well, uh, embarrassed.  Yeah.  I don't blame you.  And then he was basically like, well, I really wanted to, you know, I wanted to show you  how they're trying to be cool.  And then the, you know, the, the, the sale, what, who was she? 
[00:07:30]  Some sales girls like clueless that the fucking client is really disappointed.  So then we pump it up and like, yeah, no, it's cool.  We'll, we'll still try to figure this out.  What were the, what were the other two points?  The other one was that's only the first point.  So he was able to actually pop up the copy on the computer.  Oh, right.  So he pops the copy up and we're, we're reading along with him and he's the one that, that  popped it up on his computer, but we can see it.  It's actually very cool.  Is it like, hold on, let me ask.  Is it like, like you, you're, you can, you can view documents on somebody else's. 
[00:08:00]  Exactly.  But let's say like, like the copy was up there.  Now I could take my mouse, click on the copy and change some of the lines.  Right.  From my computer, even though it's his.  On his desktop.  Like shit.  It's everything is manipulated through each other's computer.  So you don't have to send it and download it.  Right.  It's right there.  And you're all looking at the same thing.  And then you take turns.  It's very fucking cool.  You take turns taking control, basically.  Yeah.  All right.  So, uh, it's like a Skype feature almost. 
[00:08:30]  That's really smart.  Where, where you can actually manipulate each other's, uh, fucking laptops.  Laptops.  So you better make sure you have a really clean laptop before you go into these meetings.  I don't think you can pop in on it.  I think it's within the go to meeting window.  I sure hope so.  Kid's default.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not important right now.  No, you sure?  I want to click on this.  So as the guy's talking about the copy and stuff.  Hold on.  And then he goes, look, now you guys got the copy so you can write something.  So I, I, I just wrote something dumb.  Who cares?  And then we brought it back.  And then he took it, took control again. 
[00:09:00]  So we're showing how you could basically write copy for the commercial with each other, even  though you have a, one lives in New York and the other lives somewhere on the West Coast.  And this would be good for, you know, anything fucking, uh, writing a, a script or a song  or something like you.  Doing a Sudoku puzzle with someone in Ireland or something, you know, if I'm having a tough  time, I can fucking say, Hey, help me out with this for a little while.  Yeah.  So, uh, there, there, there's the copy and, uh, he's talking about it, but when I'm me  and Opie know what, what this guy's getting at, he's saying like, you know, we want you 
[00:09:30]  guys to know about the product and stuff.  So it's not just reading the copy verbatim every time.  And he says that he goes, you know, we, we really love bullet points.  We'd rather just give the guys bullet points and then they kind of go with it.  Yeah.  So we understood that.  We're like, yeah, yeah, that's a, she, so the girl goes, uh, well, they, they, they got  the copy and he goes, yeah, we like bullet points.  We like, you know, if it, and she goes, uh, he goes, so, so what do you have there? 
[00:10:00]  She goes, we have the copy.  They'll read the copy.  She goes, they just, they just work off a script.  That's exactly.  They just work off a script.  And then Opie finally chimes in.  What do you mean?  Finally?  No, no.  I mean, you chime in.  Oh yeah.  Like finally.  No, cause I'm trying her up because I'm trying to save the client at this point.  In the end, it doesn't matter how many fucking sponsors we have in the old days.  It did.  It doesn't matter anymore, but we're, but we're, we really are in the end team players.  But the guy was obviously making the point, like he doesn't want just, you know, to pay 
[00:10:30]  a shitload of money to throw a copy at us.  And we read it word for word, which we do a lot of days.  Yes.  And she goes, no, they just work off, uh, uh, the copy.  And, and I'm like, ah, no, not really.  I mean, when we get familiar with it, we'll certainly, you know, you know, some days we  just rip up the copy some days, you know, it's a five minute fucking live read for you  guys.  Other days when we get really comfortable, we will work off bullet points.  But she was like, no, they just work off, off the, off the copy.  Not getting what the client was getting at all. 
[00:11:00]  No, no, not picking up on it.  Exactly.  Even if, even if the rule is that we're going to read, you know, the copy word for word,  it's your job to make sure the client doesn't know that.  And let me tell you something in stunning HD on a go to meeting, um, in stunning HD, you  could see the look of utter disgust on his face.  It's amazing, uh, that you can see in widescreen format, uh, in his apartment, wherever he  was very far away, I think California or something, I don't know, but, uh, you could literally  see the look of absolute disgust on his face. 
[00:11:30]  It was so obvious that the guy was like, look, I want a little more for my money.  Yeah.  And she goes, no, they just work off the copy or they just read the copy.  What a dummy to not, what an imperceptive person to not pick up on his vibe.  Even if you guys didn't read bullet points, even if she went, oh, that sounds, why wouldn't  you go?  That sounds great.  Yeah.  That sounds great.  The guys will work with it, you know, with the copy and they'll make it their own and  all that, all that horseshit, corporate horseshit. 
[00:12:00]  But how do you not get that?  Like she didn't get that he was getting it.  No, not in the least.  That's what's offensive.  Exactly.  To not understand that this guy is saying, I want these guys to enjoy the product.  I wasn't there and this is what I'm getting at it.  Yes.  I want them to know what they're talking about.  I want them to understand the product a little bit and discuss it without reading it sounding  like they're carbon copy reading.  I got that.  That's why me and Anthony were laughing our asses off.  Like how stupid can you be and how not aware of the situation at hand can you be? 
[00:12:30]  That's terrible.  And then the last thing was the fact that.  Well, just to preface it.  Yeah, yeah.  We got things to do and we know these meetings could be an hour of nonsense.  So we try to make them short, but we're going to give you everything you need in a short  amount of time.  And we're going to pick our out.  We know when the meeting is pretty much done.  Petering out.  And we're not going to run out of a meeting in the middle of it.  You know, we'll say that.  Well, sorry.  We'll say that on the air.  But the fact is, we know we have to do business when we're not on the radio. 
[00:13:00]  Obviously, no one wants to sit in a meeting for an hour, but we're there for as long as  it takes.  We don't want to be there any longer than it takes.  But we're not going to fuck the client up.  So we made it clear.  We, you know, let's get this done within 20 minutes.  I think that's more than fair.  If it's a legit meeting and not the time wasting time, you got to say, yeah.  In the middle of watching Mike on lovely HT.  He's summarizing.  He's summarizing.  He's actually wrapping up.  And we know he's summarizing. 
[00:13:30]  So even though we want to get the fuck out of there, I know in my head, and I don't even  have to ask Anthony, we know in less than five minutes we'll be out of this building.  We're totally cool.  He's in the middle of summarizing.  It's not like he's starting a whole new topic that, you know, oh, fuck, that's another 15  minutes.  He literally is saying, in summary, here's what I would like to present to the consumer.  Here's the bottom line, pretty much.  And he's telling us in the middle, in mid-sentence of him speaking, she's like, we're going to 
[00:14:00]  these guys got to go.  We're going to have to wrap it up.  Mike, we really got to get these guys out of here.  We don't be looking at each other like, no, we really did.  There are times where we would, if this person is competent, we look at him like, thank you.  Because it's obvious that we did everything we needed to do, and it's time to fucking stop  this meeting.  Oh, my God.  Not yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Right in the middle of him summarizing.  We really need to get these guys out of here.  It was in mid-sentence.  Wow.  And I jumped on.  I'm like, no, no, no. 
[00:14:30]  Mike, I just want to explain.  I really do have to pick up my kid, but we do have a couple more minutes so you can fucking  summarize.  And what I saw on his face there was, oh, my God, this is my livelihood.  I'm going to be paying you people to do this.  What do you mean you got to go in the middle of me talking?  That is so fucking unprofessional and horrible and embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  That's embarrassing.  I'm not a whistleblower, but I guess we're blowing the whistle right now. 
[00:15:00]  It was terrible.  I think I have to go and tell Scott.  I think I have to.  And I'm not.  I just am not that guy.  But it was so bad.  I'm like, this is unbelievable.  It won't do any good to tell him.  I mean, he'll listen to you, but nothing changes.  Who knows?  Nothing changes.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  You could tell him we're saying it on the radio.  You're saying it on the radio.  Nothing will change.  I've given up 100% other than just doing the job, and that's what they want. 
[00:15:30]  Well, the Louis C.K. rant about the company made it to Scott's desk.  Nothing will change.  I haven't heard a peep from him about it.  No one gives a shit.  Not a peep, even a peep that says, look, Louis C.K. is dead wrong on this, which I don't  think he is at all, but not even a peep that we even brought it to his attention that  a big-time celebrity fucking hates how this company is run.  But for common sense, not the product is terrible.  Not saying the product is bad.  Not saying the music channels are bad. 
[00:16:00]  Not saying the talk channels are terrible.  It's not the product.  It's not the content that was the issue.  It's the nonsense that the people on this show complain about three days a week.  What I've found in my four years here, there's a lot of people that don't belong here.  A lot of incompetence.  A lot of people that, you know, when satellite radio started, they had to kind of get a whole  bunch of people that were out of work in radio, and they're still here.  You know, and we're one of those people. 
[00:16:30]  We were damaged goods.  That's the only reason we went to satellite in the first place.  In the first place.  We were talking to nobody back then.  So, the client, I could see, is like, if this continues, I gotta go fucking spend my  money somewhere else.  It felt so bad.  You could see.  He went from incredibly excited to when he clicked off his whole go-to-meeting shit on  his computer.  Yeah.  You gotta think, he's like, second-guessing a few things.  It's like, fuck that, really?  Are they gonna be dedicated? 
[00:17:00]  I mean, I apologize to the go-to-meeting people.  I think they're, I was amazed by the ingenuity there.  It's great.  You know, there's a product that I'm gonna be doing something with, which I'm actually  very psyched about.  Ooh, Fleshlight.  I love the Fleshlight.  But the drinking glass version.  The yogurt container.  Are you gonna be a spokesperson?  A partial one.  Are you gonna be in a commercial?  No, no, no, no.  It's not a product.  It's a newer product.  But it's actually one that I genuinely like and have been aware of. 
[00:17:30]  AZT?  No, I said, like, that need.  I said, genuinely, like, that definitely need.  As liquid-ass reworking their recipe?  Yeah.  But I was, I was uncomfortable.  I'm gonna bring them as advertisers, but I was uncomfortable.  Bring them here?  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  It really, honestly.  I got people that ask me, I don't even bother.  It's uncomfortable.  I don't even bother.  Knowing that it's gonna get somehow tripped up or fucked up in the sludge. 
[00:18:00]  The mud.  The mud.  The mud.  How do you have a meeting with GoToMeeting, which is all about webcams, and you don't  even have a webcam set up, and you have to sit there like, oh, I, we, I didn't realize  you needed a webcam.  It's the whole thing.  He wanted to see us so he could go, look, I could see you, you guys are in New York,  I'm in fucking wherever the hell he is.  And I'll tell you one thing, it's harder, it's harder in this day and age to sit in  front of a computer that doesn't have a camera than it is to sit in front of one that does 
[00:18:30]  have a camera.  I mean, it could have been anything.  A laptop that could have grabbed anything.  It's amazing to me because the technology behind satellites that make this stuff possible  is genius.  Yeah.  And yet, the people they put on the day-to-day stuff are blithering morons and just don't  have any drive.  It's almost like because this is an insulated company in that it's satellite radio.  It's the only one.  There's no drive to continue forward.  It's almost like a bunch of bees are in the hive and there's no need to go out and do  anything else because we're all in the hive and there's no other competition, there's 
[00:19:00]  no other nothing, so it's stagnant.  It's a fucking stale air.  No one is fighting.  You know on radio when you're fighting station to station, you have to continue to do stuff  otherwise the next guy's, there is no next guy here.  They don't see the next guy, which is podcast.  You know, our listeners have brought up over the past year or two that you guys bitched  too much and all that, and I don't necessarily disagree with them anymore.  And I'll say it again.  The reason bitching came to radio shows or high-profile radio shows like ours was it 
[00:19:30]  really did get things done in the end, and you were able to show that to the listeners.  And in a weird way, they were along for the ride.  Like, oh my God, they bitched and complained about such and such.  Next thing you know, they're doing such and such.  Like, something came of it.  And I think the reason more listeners are sick of the bitching is because they don't  see the payoff anymore.  There used to be a payoff which made it worthwhile to the listener.  You were in.  You were like, fuck yeah, I'm behind these guys. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, get them this or that.  Get them their bigger studio.  And then there'd be a huge celebration as you hear the wall being knocked down or whatever.  But when you bitch day in and day out and week after week and there's no payoff, I think  that's what is driving a bunch of the fans fucking nuts.  And, you know, I agree with them.  That's why I now laugh when this stuff comes up.  Because you're right, Jimmy.  Nothing will ever change.  The only reason we're bringing this to the show was because me and Anthony had such a  great laugh over it. 
[00:20:30]  We were like, I can't believe what I just said in.  We were just laughing.  That's the incompetence.  I've never dealt with it in my, and literally, in all the companies I've dealt with in my  professional life, in entertainment, a lot of them, I've never had an experience like  this.  Meaning, with the corporate, it's the Nightmare on Elm Street moment where you're running  up the steps and your feet are getting stuck.  Yeah, you can't run.  I've never seen it to this level. 
[00:21:00]  Fuck, man.  Well, because, you know, they hired the big guy.  They hired Howard Stern for a shitload of money and they're just riding their side.  That was their business model.  I'm telling you, I know for a fact that was the business model.  The people in place now, do they believe in that business model anymore?  I have no idea.  But that's how this was set up initially.  So you don't give a fuck.  But if he leaves, then what the fuck are you guys going to do?  But they'll do the same thing when he's gone. 
[00:21:30]  Because the day-to-day salespeople are not doing him.  They don't know what they're doing.  Well, then they're going to be extinct.  Yep.  Is my point.  You know?  Logically, that made sense back in the day, I guess.  But, you know, they don't give a fuck about it like anyone else around here, really.  They give a fuck about us a little bit and then they give a fuck about him a lot.  They don't even give a fuck about him.  They really don't.  No, they...  They care from business point.  They don't give a fuck about him.  Oh, no, I'm not talking about personal shit.  I don't know these people personally. 
[00:22:00]  I'm talking about, you know, the importance in a company.  They give a shit about our show, I should say, not us as individuals, a little bit.  They really give a shit about him.  And not really anyone else in between.  Not really.  Maybe a couple of the celebrity shows and that's it.  But, you know, if he leaves, they're going to have some major fucking problems unless they start figuring out shit now.  Because that meeting was just ridiculous.  That's embarrassing.  How do you not have a webcam set up? 
[00:22:30]  The basics.  Well, if it's a visual element, why would they?  You hand her a webcam, she wouldn't have known what it was for her to eat it.  What kind of snack is this?  And then in the middle of summarizing, we really got to get these guys out of here.  I'm like, oh my God, no, that's not right.  You don't say that.  Yikes.  Everyone knows when they go into, you know, in summary, you know you have maybe five minutes.  Yeah, just suck it up.  Yeah, at that point, it gives them a fuck.  Well, I mean, and honestly, it does look like it's a very useful thing if you're doing meetings and stuff. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, we got through it.  I'm not going to lie.  We got through it because we're that damn good in the end.  Oh my God.  Saved another client.  We've fucked clients in the past, too, but we've also saved a lot over the years.  Like, how do we not even have a beer sponsor?  Unless the beer companies have moved on from this type of asset.  Well, they're probably going to clicks on, oh, for anyone listening down the hall, the  web is this weird thing that comes through your computer screen and, like, people will 
[00:23:30]  watch it a lot.  I forget it.  They probably have, they're counting clicks on the fucking websites on their ads.  Why would they come here?  Right.  When they can't get numbers.  Right.  Ah, we don't know.  Ah.  Yeah, they won't even tell us how many people we talk to.  Why would, why?  People ask me all the time and they think I'm hiding the numbers.  I have no idea.  I have no fucking idea.  That's why, you know, you could just say we're talking to 10 million. 
[00:24:00]  We're talking to 10 million.  Yeah, that's what I say.  Fuck it.  We're talking to 10 million people a week.  There it is.  Prove me wrong.  Prove me wrong.  There's no way you can.  No.  Because they hide the fucking data for whatever reason.  That's weird, too.  Anyway, enough.  It was fun, though, man.  It was fun.  I kind of enjoy Incompetence now.  It's just fun to watch.  It is funny.  It's just fun.  It is funny to watch. 
[00:24:30]  That was something.  We really got to get these guys out of here.  I'd jump on.  No, no.  I have to pick up my kid.  That's why this meeting's a little short.  But I'm cool for, you know, a little bit.  Summarize, please.  Yeah.  Trust me, we want it out of there.  But we knew it wasn't time to leave yet.  Whatever.  This cough is fucking ponderous.  It sounds a little better.  It's still just like fucking... 
[00:25:00]  Like almost just starting to dry Elmer's glue in our lungs.  It's wonderful.  So we got this Yankees-Red Sox thing.  We're all lovey-dovey here, aren't we?  No, they're showing it right now on Fox.  We're just...  They're sharing a logo right now.  New York stands with Boston.  We're in love, the Yankees and the Red Sox.  And the Sweet Caroline was played yesterday at Yankee Stadium.  Oh, wait a sec. 
[00:25:30]  The Yankee fans began to realize the significance of the song and what it meant.  I thought that was fantastic.  They didn't really go with the Sweet Caroline at Yankee Stadium.  I watched it.  I mean, everyone, you know, I think it was a really nice gesture, of course.  Yeah.  But I saw the video like everyone else.  Lackluster response.  It just sat there flat.  Everyone was just sitting in their seats like...  And everyone was hoping it was going to be this big emotional moment.  It wasn't.  And it wasn't in the end.  Because they don't know that's a Boston thing.  No one associates that song with Boston. 
[00:26:00]  I don't.  New York, New York.  Well, they played it at every Red Sox home game.  But a lot of the Yankee fans, I wouldn't know that.  There had been a lot of Red Sox home games.  Yeah.  No.  But they were hoping for this incredible, unbelievable moment.  The video of it being played at Yankee Stadium went viral.  I clicked on it.  Everyone clicked on it.  And there was a montage of people just kind of just sitting there.  Slouched in their seats.  Slouched.  Kind of like nodding their head to it.  Even the big punch, you know, punchline of the song just kind of...  It sat there.  It wasn't a sing-along. 
[00:26:30]  Did you see the one guy...  Look, she's asleep on his shoulder.  Did you see the one guy that was eating the ice cream pop?  And he's just like...  Yeah.  And he looks at the camera like, oh, there I am.  Yeah, yeah.  But it is something funny with me.  Yeah, there is.  Wait, can we go...  Wow.  Wow, how exciting.  Let's play it on the show.  We could talk through this.  How exciting.  And this is the video.  But they were really hoping this was going to be the fucking moment.  A big moment.  Like, wow, look, they transcended their rivalry to show support. 
[00:27:00]  Don't get me wrong.  Great gesture.  But then the media is really pushing it.  And guess what?  It's not...  You didn't get your moment that you were hoping for.  It's a great gesture, but it does show you the arrogance of baseball.  Like, there's a Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.  Yeah.  Wow, it's a moment that New Yorkers stand...  Of course we stand with people in Boston who were murdered in a terrorist attack.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Fuck, there are fellow citizens.  Right.  Is there anybody out there that goes, I can't believe the baseball fans put down the rivalry 
[00:27:30]  to fight terrorism?  Right.  Well, of course we did.  Give a fuck about the Red Sox and the Yankees when there's people being killed at this event.  Give a shit.  And the Red Sox and the Yankees, their Twitter accounts were tweeting each other.  So I just...  Oh, wow.  I just retweeted and I wrote, you two need to get a room?  Oh, my God.  People fucking hate me for that.  I'm like, really?  I go, you two need to get a room.  Oh, boy.  Because they're, you know, thanking each other and complimenting each other. 
[00:28:00]  Just going for a little levity.  How'd that work out for you?  Not good.  Very little.  Not good.  But the idea that...  But it wasn't that bad.  I said, you two need to get a room.  No?  Was that a bad one?  Eh.  Was it bad?  I'm not feeling it.  No, I'm not saying it was the greatest tweet ever.  I'm just saying, was it that bad where the hate comes at me?  What were you tweeting?  You were tweeting the Red Sox and the Yankees what?  I re...  I ain't doing it. 
[00:28:30]  I ain't doing it.  You fuck.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  I saw it in your eyes, you fuck.  You know what the problem was?  I sat up in the chair.  Yes, you did.  You got so excited to pounce.  But it's amazing that baseball...  Like, I understand the rivalry.  No one gives a fuck about a dumb...  The men who hit the fucking ball with the sticks.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, of course we're with people in Boston.  Like, there's not a rivalry between us as fucking...  As terrorist victims. 
[00:29:00]  I think it's a cool gesture in general.  But I think it just kind of fell flat.  Because the media gets really...  Eh, we're part of the media, yes.  Mainstream media.  They get really excited about this stuff.  And they're really just hoping it's going to be the big fucking moment.  They want it enough.  And they play on all their shows.  Like, oh my god, look at this!  Full stadium, on their feet.  Right.  Chanting.  And they didn't get it.  Everyone, like, that was there holding up...  They brought their own, like, Boston Red Sox flags and banners.  And it just wasn't.  No, it just...  It fell flat. 
[00:29:30]  But they're still trying to push it.  Like, look at this amazing moment.  Yeah.  Great gesture.  That's terrible.  Great gesture.  Not an amazing moment.  Sorry.  Can we play the video?  Fuck.  Caroline, and we will stay right here to listen to it with you.  And we'll go to the public address announcer here at the stadium, Mr. Paul.  Not Bob Shepard.  Where it began.  La, la.  It really is a great song.  I can't begin to know.  I don't associate this with Boston. 
[00:30:00]  But then I know...  No, not many people would, unless you've been to a...  That's a huge Red Sox song, though.  Really huge.  Was in the spring, and spring became the sunblock.  The cameraman should be executed.  Yeah.  Well, pause.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yes, because I'm thinking, you know, this is a big deal, and the cameraman really can't  find the excited people.  Sorry.  That's fine.  This is literally cement drying in my fucking lungs. 
[00:30:30]  You need a little something of worsen?  Oh, it's fucking cement.  Yeah.  The cameraman blew it, too, because he really isn't finding the people that are all gung-ho  for this moment.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm fine.  It's just annoying.  It just sits here going, la, la, la, la.  In my windpipe.  Yeah, that was nothing like they wanted it to be.  Do we need to play the whole thing?  Yeah, go back to it.  Let me see a little more.  Let's see. 
[00:31:00]  They're like, hey, look, that's me.  One guy's clapping.  This guy's just eating his ice cream.  Hey, look, I'm on camera.  And this is the big build-up.  They're just rocking back and forth.  It's too small to see.  Yeah.  All right.  Yay!  She's rubbing her eyes because she's tired.  Empty seats.  So you got a little bit, but you have five people.  Yes.  Because they know the song.  Empty seats. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  No one's there.  Empty seats.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't care.  They're checking their phones.  This guy's just holding his kid.  They're singing a little bit over there.  Three people.  But the rest of them around them aren't singing or into it.  They just like the song.  They don't know what it means.  Look, she's texting.  She's fucking...  Exactly.  She's sending a cut picture.  Right.  Right.  That lady's drinking beer out of it with a straw so it doesn't fuck up her teeth. 
[00:32:00]  Guys are holding the flab.  They don't know how to hold it up.  You see what I'm saying, though?  Yeah.  It's a giant empty climax with empty seats around it.  And then watch this.  And then they just stop the song in the middle.  Maybe they realize.  Why was the guy talking?  Because of this.  That's it. 
[00:32:30]  Ah, they just cut it off.  That's it.  That's what the...  It wasn't a nice moment.  It was a nice gesture.  Why the fuck would they do that?  If you're going to play the fucking song and there's this big fucking deal happening between  the two cities, you know, baseball could wait for another minute and a half.  I think that song had maybe fucking 90 seconds left.  I think the song was going nowhere.  But at that point, it went, sweet!  Okay, number four.  Okay.  Right.  Good one.  Well done.  I don't know.  Well done, Yanks.  You can't fucking beat him up for trying something nice, but let's not make believe it was an 
[00:33:00]  amazing holy shit moment.  It wasn't.  Indeed, it wasn't.  Obama finally saying terror.  That's good.  Finally saying terror.  About his fucking administration.  About his tenure.  I don't like what he's done.  I didn't quite understand that.  You were wondering when you were going to let the world know.  It's about time you finally tell people you don't like them. 
[00:33:30]  I love how everyone's perking up to the fact that everything, this health care that he  said wasn't going to cost a dime is costing a lot of people money and jobs.  I think one of the movie theater chains, don't know which one it is, god damn it, just pulled  back their hours for all their employees.  Sent out a memo that said, look, the cost of this fucking health care, we have to cut back  our hours.  People are losing fucking jobs and money because of it. 
[00:34:00]  My premiums just went up and I put it on Twitter.  I said, hey, thanks.  There go my fucking insurance premiums going up.  And someone's like, they always raise the premiums.  Really?  These people.  Could you just for once go like fucking maybe, maybe there's some policy that's affecting  everyone financially negatively?  Of course.  Oh, Christ.  I agree with you on that point.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  And the taxes that were in the last budget that Obama just submitted, it's the Democrats. 
[00:34:30]  There are taxes.  How he said that no one's going to get taxes raised if you don't make over $250,000 a year.  And then all these taxes are put in.  It might not be income tax, but it's everything had taxes thrown on it.  More gas taxes.  Cigarette taxes.  Just fucking everything.  If you want to buy a car, there's more taxes on that. 
[00:35:00]  It's just they're taxing the fuck out of everybody.  I love how the administration didn't realize that employers would obviously have to make  some tough decisions because they didn't want to pay the extra money.  Of course that was going to happen.  They're going to have to start insuring people that they normally didn't have to insure because  they weren't full-time employees.  Right.  And now that the criteria has been changed, they have to start insuring people and they  can't afford it.  So they cut back.  What did these idiots think they were going to do? 
[00:35:30]  Just suck it up and fucking lose money?  No, they fire.  When the government affects a business to the point where they start losing some money,  they fire people.  They're going to have to.  They have no choice.  What dummies.  They didn't consider that part of this equation?  No, because the Democrats never think that.  And the Republicans.  Well, not on that.  No, the Republicans have their own other problems.  But this is a very Democratic issue that they do.  They love the tax spend and think that's going to fucking put us into prosperity. 
[00:36:00]  Get out of our assholes.  Could you please just crawl back out of our assholes?  You know, can't both sides just be nice to each other?  You don't see what's coming out of your check, regular Joe, when you're working every day?  You know what?  They take what they take.  I take what I take.  What the hell am I going to do?  Get crazy about it?  I would hate to be stuck on an island with regular Joe.  Yeah.  I'm trying to have an intelligent conversation with regular Joe. 
[00:36:30]  You know what?  They do what they do.  I'm going to have a buttered roll one way or the other.  If I drop it, hopefully it's buttered side up.  What the hell do I know?  I take the time.  You let the muckety-mucks do what they do.  Joe's willing to put everyone else in charge.  He doesn't either put a house to the job site.  I don't tell them I'm going to do medical coverage.  They don't tell me how to build a foundation.  That's true.  What an asshole.  Anyway.  Reaching out.  Yeah, I don't think that went over like they thought it would. 
[00:37:00]  You sang that song, right?  Oh, I've sang that song a million times.  It's amazing.  Donnie Wicklund.  Hold on.  He texted me here.  Tell Ant the citizens of MD are being taxed on rainfall.  Have Sam look it up.  Really?  That's a good one.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  You don't have to look it up.  I think Don's drunk.  So what do we know about, what's the latest on the Boston Marathon bombing? 
[00:37:30]  Well, they still don't have any kind of leads on a suspect.  At least this is what they're telling us.  No leads.  I think they got a lead.  They're not ready to fucking push forward anymore at this point.  You know what the thing is, though?  A lot of times they can't really hide things anymore.  I mean, anonymous people from certain agencies always talk to the media.  It's like someone told us under the condition of anonymity that, you know, they got somebody  or this or that. 
[00:38:00]  But they do have the bombs that were exploded, and they figured out they were pressure cookers.  Right.  Packed with metal nails and ball bearings and such.  Nails, ball bearings, and some kind of low-tech explosive, probably black powder.  Packed in black nylon bags, really big.  Not big, but really fucking heavy backpacks.  I don't understand how you get an explosion out of that.  And they were equipped with timers.  Oh, okay.  Well, the starters say they were equipped with timers.  Yeah, probably a timer.  They found a circuit board, batteries, things like that. 
[00:38:30]  So, yeah, it was probably more of a timer thing than a cell phone.  You know there's footage of someone bringing those in.  Well, they got the picture, and this is frustrating.  It's on the front page of our papers today.  They show the, are we calling it a backpack officially?  No, look.  Is it a backpack?  Oh, yeah, maybe it's a backpack.  And they show it next to a garbage can, and it was placed there.  And then after the bomb exploded, that is gone.  So they're basically saying the bomb was in this thing. 
[00:39:00]  It's next to a mailbox.  A mailbox.  Oh, mailbox, excuse me.  That's the second bomb.  The second bomb.  All I'm looking at is those legs right there, and those feet, like how close they are to  that fucking thing, man.  But then they smeared out the post-aftermath picture, because there's a, I guess there's  a body there.  There's victims there, yeah.  I know.  But it's like you're showing, like, just horrific fucking images from this thing.  And the point is to show that that package isn't there anymore.  But you can't see it, because they decided to smear it out, because there's a victim there. 
[00:39:30]  Then at that point, then don't even attempt to do this, because you can't see anything.  And they've shown fucking horrid things in the paper already.  We've only seen that guy with his right leg.  Both his legs.  Was it both his legs?  It was both his legs.  I saw a front view of that.  It was terrible.  I only saw the one.  No, when you look from that, from your point of view, you can see, if you look carefully,  that the leg is not there.  And when you see a head-on view, both legs are gone.  The other one, he's got a little more of his shin on the other leg, but yeah, it's gone.  That was horrific.  That was terrible. 
[00:40:00]  Is that a video?  Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah, play the video.  Pressure cookers used the whole bomb.  Pictures have emerged, which show before and after the second bomb went off near the finish  line of the Boston Marathon.  The first image appears to show a large shopping bag placed on the other side of the barrier,  which may have contained the explosive device.  That's the second explosive.  The next photo was taken just moments after the bomb was detonated.  Why blur it?  Most of the images have been blurred, but in the untouched photo, the bag is gone. 
[00:40:30]  Well, then show us the untouched photo.  Stupid pause.  Pictures recounts her view of the event and realize...  But couldn't they, like, blur everything else and have a circle exactly where the bag was  supposed to be?  Right.  What the fuck are they doing?  Morons.  They can't even do that right.  No, they can't.  They blurred the entire scenes.  Like, no, all we need to know is that little circle, that little spot.  We understand there was carnage.  Of course.  We don't want to see that.  But fucking, you know, show us that the bag is gone.  The sensation of what her camera may have captured. 
[00:41:00]  May have captured.  And, like, slammed on the ground and legs cut off and, like, covered with blood.  And I was like, oh, my God, this is a bomb.  Like, in pictures, like, what happened?  Like, where is the bomb?  And, like, you know, my husband and I were looking at the pictures and we're like,  this must be the bomb.  And, like, if you look at the pictures, like, the tables and chairs behind, you know,  the mailbox.  It didn't blow away. 
[00:41:30]  And, you know, the glass doors are not shattered.  So, you know, and the person who was right behind the bag got hurt the most.  The images have been passed on to FBI investigators.  And Atlanta's Fox 5 News claims to have gotten its hands on photos from the crime scene.  On photos from the crime scene.  The images allegedly show remnants of the first bomb, which was made using a pressure cooker.  Pause.  The leaked photos also appear to...  These cunts. 
[00:42:00]  I hate using that word.  You see how they had to have their fucking logo on the...  Oh, yeah.  On the actual, uh...  Using a pressure cooker.  Look how they made the logo, like, almost like it's stamped on the, uh, the bomb itself.  Oh, wow.  They made it out of pressure cookers.  Why do we talk like this?  I hate...  Nah, it's like an English fucking...  The way they deliver the news in England.  There's always a man talking like this.  I hate that.  It's not the normal speech pattern. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  Even for your fucking stupid country.  Right.  They stole our language.  Exactly.  Here, finish this off.  It's quick.  Photos also appear to document fragments of a black nylon bag, which many news organizations  are reporting housed the first bomb.  But the FBI refused to comment on these photos.  All right.  Hmm.  There you go.  So...  A pressure cooker.  Yeah.  The pressure cooker is, uh...  So they're saying six liters?  That's tight. 
[00:43:00]  So that's like three bottles of soda, basically?  Yeah, yeah.  Two liter bottles of soda.  You put three of those together.  That's about what you're looking at here.  And what you want is a container that doesn't leak.  It doesn't have anything that's going to blow out any sooner than any other part of it  to relieve the pressure before the entire thing blows up.  Then you get that big blast of energy all at once.  If you have something that's a little soft or something where the bottom or top could blow  out first, the weakest link in there, you're not going to get as strong an explosion. 
[00:43:30]  So that's why even with probably the use of black powder, low-tech explosives, they  were still able to get such a big blast out of it that just ripped people's legs off  right from under them.  And whoever did this really should just have their throats cut.  Because, like, you're at...  I understand terrorism is to terrorize, but look who you killed.  An eight-year-old, a woman, and a Chinese national.  Like, whatever your objections with the United States are, whether it's military or... 
[00:44:00]  It's not with an eight-year-old, a woman, and a Chinese national.  Yeah, look what you did.  Look what you did.  Right.  Look at who you fucked.  You hurt a lot of people, but look at who you really killed.  Look at the three people that died.  But they should just cut the throat of whoever did this.  Yeah.  They won't, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll put them on trial.  They'll be well-protected.  They'll be well-protected.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's also, if you look at where the bag was placed in that circumstance, it really isn't  placed for maximum damage. 
[00:44:30]  Half of the bomb itself is going to go outward into the street where there really isn't anybody  there.  Maybe a couple of runners might coincidentally be running by, but the crowd itself is behind  the fence on the other side of the bomb, so you're wasting half the bomb, pretty much.  And then you put it next to that mailbox, you're pretty much shielding people to that  side of the...  Makes me feel like you didn't know exactly what he was doing.  Didn't think it out.  It wasn't right. 
[00:45:00]  It wasn't well...  It wasn't a professional group, because they would have probably put something like that  right in the middle of the fucking crowd.  Yeah, that's what you would...  Because you're right, like, 50% of this thing isn't hurting anybody.  It's blasting out into nothingness.  It knocked the old guy down, obviously, but besides that, it wasn't going to really hurt  anyone that way.  Yep.  Unless they're trying to kill runners, too.  But even that, it didn't...  You know, you might get a couple.  It's not going to be...  What was the blast radius, you think?  20, 25 feet?  Maybe 20...  It looked to me like when it went off, some people that were literally 15 feet away on 
[00:45:30]  the front side of it were fine.  Yeah, they got knocked down a little bit, but it doesn't seem like they got hit with  a lot of stuff.  It was the people right in that general area that really got fucked up.  Maybe, yeah, they were going for runners, but didn't even realize that this thing wasn't  going to have a huge blast radius.  I think that was the most convenient place to put it down, where you would not be suspect. 
[00:46:00]  Like, if you just put it in the middle of a crowd and walk away, you could put it there.  People put shit, you know, oh, it's on the side of the road, it's by a mailbox.  On a day like the Boston Marathon, you could pretty much put a bag down anywhere.  We've been in those situations, yes.  Under a table, under a chair.  Yeah.  You really could.  And both were on the side of the curb, basically.  Yeah.  Well, the other one was a little more in the...  Was it in a little further?  Yeah, it was definitely in further.  It was more against the building than it was toward the street, the first place. 
[00:46:30]  Then I'm absolutely wrong.  It's probably two people.  Might have been.  Because one guy lugging two giant bags would look weird.  Yeah.  One was in the backpack.  Not on a day like that, though, man.  You know, it looks like you just fucking had some shopping bags.  But if you're doing this, you're going to be very paranoid of everything.  You know, you might...  People around you might not give it a second thought if you place a backpack in the middle  of a crowd. 
[00:47:00]  But you yourself, knowing you're placing a fucking bomb, are going to think everyone's  looking at you.  Right.  And you're going to try to be as...  You know...  Even though it was later in the race, it's still tough to maneuver around the sidewalk.  So they obviously came from the side street.  Yeah.  I could hit the marathon from whatever side street is right near there.  I'd have to look at a map.  Then find an area.  Boom, boom.  And then come back out.  Side street.  And go up a little further.  Back down another side street.  Who knows how long it was there, too?  It might have been there for an hour. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know how long these things take.  I don't know how long the timer was set for.  Who knows, you know?  True, true.  So that's another thing.  But I'm sure there will be other photographs and video from there.  The biggest thing the cops want right now is video from everybody.  From all the store owners.  They said, don't erase your video.  No matter how unimportant you think it looks, save it and give us a call.  Let us look at it.  All the photographs.  And they will absolutely have at least a frame of somebody placing that fucking package 
[00:48:00]  there.  I bet you it comes out today.  That close to the finish line?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  They will absolutely be effective.  It comes out today.  It comes out today.  Well, they probably have it already.  That grainy image of...  Yeah.  I mean, because if they got that photograph, then most likely they got video in that spot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because everyone wants to fucking film shit and put it on their Facebook.  Everybody at this point.  Yeah.  So if you're there and you got runners, you're filming shit.  Yeah.  Remember they said they had two unexploded bombs? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, that turned out.  That's wrong, too.  Erroneous.  The Saudi man completely cleared.  Oh, good.  All right.  Turns out that was wrong.  Mm-hmm.  Do we have the interview of his roommate?  It was like, I don't know, dude.  I just want to go to school or whatever the fuck he said.  Yeah, fuck.  If you can find it, it's a quickie.  Because the media, the reporters were talking to the Saudi's roommate.  And he's like, look, I got to go to school.  I got a test or something.  Is this it?  Is it long? 
[00:49:00]  No.  It's less than a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  Question's the roommate.  Jonathan Wachtell, one of our Fox producers, talked to one of his roommates a short time  ago.  This is part of the conversation they had now.  Listen carefully here.  What's your friend like?  Yeah, I haven't heard about that.  I haven't heard about that.  What can you tell us about your friend?  What is he?  He's shitting his pants.  Let me go to school, dude. 
[00:49:30]  Let me go to school, dude.  Let me go to school, dude.  Good.  Good for him.  They were pushing the Saudi guy.  I humble you.  They were pushing the Saudi guy being involved.  Pushing, pushing, pushing.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's been completely cleared.  He's one of the victims, right?  Yeah, I think so.  He's just been cleared.  Investigators are trying to identify a white man in his 30s seen on video surveillance at  both bombing locations before the blast. 
[00:50:00]  That's a reach.  I didn't know that today.  We'll never know.  Yeah.  I'll bet it's a white guy.  Here's why.  Everyone knows Boston, and you're going to stand out a lot.  Boston doesn't play games.  If you're a white guy in that neighborhood, you're okay.  But anybody else, they're not afraid of looking at you.  Hey, what are you doing, brown knuckles?  They're not scared to fucking...  What are you carrying there?  Terrible Boston accent.  I bet it's a white guy.  We were up there recently, and we were commenting about how segregated, excuse me, it still is. 
[00:50:30]  It's amazing.  There's a white guy in the footage of both bomb locations?  And they're also...  I didn't know this.  They're leaning toward domestic terror.  Is that true?  Who's reporting that?  I don't know.  Some might fact.  Some people are saying.  Sources.  People are saying.  Sources are saying.  Close to.  And then we got Obama.  This is...  I wish the guy would get on TV a little more, but whatever. 
[00:51:00]  He's getting on, what, once a day so far?  Yeah.  There's not much he can offer.  Honestly, he's not a part of the investigation.  Clinton had that vibe where he would just say, fuck it, turn on the cameras.  What are you going to say?  I don't know.  Let's wing it.  Right.  I feel like he was more of a wing it guy.  Not so calculated.  They're all calculated, but I don't know.  It seems Obama's a lot more calculated than...  Clinton was sticking his peck on everybody.  He certainly was. 
[00:51:30]  Here's a chip.  Here's some quick shit from Obama from yesterday.  We continue to mobilize and deploy all appropriate law enforcement resources to protect our citizens  and investigate and to respond to this attack.  Obviously, our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston.  We know that two explosions gravely wounded dozens of Americans and took the lives of others, including an eight-year-old boy. 
[00:52:00]  This was a heinous and cowardly act.  And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism.  Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.  What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack or why,  whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, 
[00:52:30]  or was the act of a malevolent individual.  That's what we don't yet know.  And clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation.  We'll take time to follow every lead and determine what happened.  But we will find out.  We will find whoever harmed our citizens, and we will bring them to justice.  That old gag.  Didn't really hear anything in there. 
[00:53:00]  Nothing really new there.  Nope.  As they say.  And some ricin found in the, what, the Congressional Post Office place there?  To a senator.  How did they find that shit?  Maybe they just do random tests.  Random.  No, the guy didn't touch it?  Oh, I don't know.  No, he didn't.  When he was making sushi, he needed ricin?  I couldn't think of nothing.  Fucking good enough right there.  You thought of something that was fantastically funny.  You touch that shit, you're in a world of hurt, right?  It's the craziest poison ever. 
[00:53:30]  It really does damage to you.  Wow.  Yeah, this, I guess there's a Congressional Post Office.  Like, all their shit goes to one place.  Right.  And they must really paw over that stuff with all kinds of shit.  Censors, scanners, whatever.  That's got to be a scary job.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  That's me and that guy.  Indeed.  Christ.  So they found it. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And then apparently the, it didn't have a return address or anything, but they cross-referenced  it with other letters that this guy has gotten and found other letters that match the handwriting  and context of, you know, syntax of the writing and figured out, they figured who they, they  know who it is.  So I gather that guy's in Dutch.  He's some garbage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  So they know who said it?  Yeah.  They're saying they kind of know who this guy is.  And I guess they're going to go get him.  Yeah.  And then Mayor Menino.  I saw this live yesterday.  Not, not as, um, not as strong as he was the day before.  He looked, I mean, everyone else is standing there in their suits and official uniforms 
[00:55:00]  and whatnot by the podium.  He's next to the podium with that leg sticking straight out with the cast on it.  And he's leaning over to try to get to a microphone.  And he was a mumbling motherfucker yesterday.  We just go with this.  Might as well.  Is it the whole one?  Whole speech?  Pretty much.  How long was it?  Two minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Let's, I want to see what he looked like.  This is Mayor Menino talking about, uh, you know, what's going on.  Crank that volume up.  It's like halfway. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  All right.  The city of Boston.  Tragedy was brought to one of our neighbors also.  This is a close-knit place, the city of Boston.  Here we know our neighbors.  This is a close-knit-knit place.  All right.  We're in a tough spot, obviously.  Hey, fuck on.  I just want to acknowledge we're in a tough spot.  Close-knit-knit place?  We're still going to make fun of what he said.  I'm sorry.  The people...  Because it's unbelievable.  You need a leader who you can understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really, literally, is the worst human to be speaking in times where people need comfort. 
[00:56:00]  He ain't.  He ain't it.  He needs to start wearing a bow tie.  I think he's at that point in his life.  Say, say, live a man for me.  That's not what's cussed up for you to do if you care of the country.  Bless the face of France.  Big benign ballena.  Big benign balloon.  You can start from the beginning.  We'll try to shut up for a little bit.  Tragedy was brought to one of our neighbors.  Tragedy was brought to one of our neighbors also.  Neighborhoods. 
[00:56:30]  This is a close place, the city of Boston.  Here we know our neighbors.  We grieve for them.  We grieve for the little boy who we knew from Dorchester.  But also today I want to say we know our heroes also.  They are the men and women who wear helmets, who wear the badges, the runners, who helped  us yesterday during this time of need.  And as we go together on this issue with all the law enforcement officials, we're going  to make sure the city pulls together.  We've got it under control. 
[00:57:00]  Let's continue to work together.  Let's keep offering a helping hand to individuals who may need it during this very difficult time  in our city's history.  I just say to all of you, I'm a mayor for 20 years now.  I've never seen law enforcement pulled together, working together.  To solve our crime in our city as they have.  But I also help people pull together.  The business community, the neighbors, everyone.  This is a tragedy, but Boston's a strong city.  We're a city that will get through this.  And like the governor said, we set up a resource center over at the castle near the park plot 
[00:57:30]  that's a hotel, where staff will be there available to give information to individuals  who have been involved in the marathon.  And it's open from 9 to 5.  And the phone number is, let me think of our phone number, 635-504, I believe.  And our hotline at city, no, the number is, wrong number, 617-534-5050.  And also, the 24-hour hotline that you need information also. 
[00:58:00]  So, that number is 617-635-4500.  And over the last several hours, we've received calls from all over the world  asking us information about the tragedy and how they can help us.  So, this is a bad day for Boston, but I think that if we pull together, we'll get through it.  We're a strong city.  A lot of people are willing to work together to make this a better place for all our people.  And so, as we gather here today with all our officials, let's say Boston will overcome. 
[00:58:30]  That's not bad.  No, no, no.  I heard a different speech yesterday.  Really?  That wasn't it?  One where he talks about BostonFund.org.  Right.  Boston Fund or Boston Fund, you couldn't understand what he's saying.  .org, .org.  It was, that wasn't it.  And it was, he did a horrible job.  That wasn't that bad.  But that wasn't the one I saw.  Huh.  WTF, I say.  WTF. 
[00:59:00]  Is there another one up there?  No.  No.  Ah, that's, uh, I don't get it.  What happened?  Ah, ah, ah, bobson.  Shit.  Oh.  Yeah, we'll have to look for it.  Yeah, we'll look for it during the break.  Because, uh, he was really mumble-mouthed in the one I saw.  Oh, we got Alex Jones today.  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  All right.  And another conspiracy theorist, Richard Voss.  Richard Voss likes to do this, doesn't he? 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  Richard Voss from the Dunderhead Institute.  Uh, by the way, an update on the Family Guy clip we played yesterday.  That V was, uh, put together.  Yeah.  Seth MacFarlane came out and said just that.  He did it or someone else did it?  Someone just did it.  Oh, he didn't do it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, no.  He was definitely chastising people that did it.  Yeah, he was not happy.  They were using his, uh, his show to push that forward. 
[01:00:00]  Whoever did it, uh, did a pretty good job, though.  Mm-hmm.  Who, um, are we going to get to a pressure cooker, um, control?  How many pressure cookers can you buy at one time?  I say seven.  Only seven.  How do they do, aren't they plugged in?  How does that work without being plugged in?  I've never.  Oh, no, it's not, you don't have to, like, cook it.  You take a couple of wires and run it inside the pressure cooker with an igniter, and then 
[01:00:30]  it comes, the wires come out, you have a battery with a timer and stuff, circuit completes,  igniter burns, boom, thing explodes.  I'm dumb.  He's there with a hot plate that's on the stove.  Trying to figure out where to plug it in.  He's cooking it.  That is a hilarious question.  Don't you have to plug it in?  Who uses a pressure cooker? 
[01:01:00]  I didn't even know.  I didn't even know about that, too.  I'm fucking stupid.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I don't even know about pressure cookers.  What are you cooking a pressure cooker?  I think like a pot roast or something.  Like something that you would want, like a piece of meat that you've got to make tender.  Like a shoulder roast.  It's very different than a crack pot, right?  Yeah, it's different than a crock pot.  A crack pot.  A pressure cooker, it uses pressure? 
[01:01:30]  I just don't understand why you need a pressure cooker.  When you cook, when you make heat in there, it builds up pressure in there.  So it's got like a lock top and fucking screw on and stuff.  So it's really sturdy.  And you raise the pressure so that the juices and everything that's in there push into the meat.  It like squishes everything into the meat.  So it cooks it that way.  It makes it more tender?  Yeah.  They don't explode in the house ever, do they?  They used to. 
[01:02:00]  They got like safety devices on them.  You got the pressure gauge and then you got the vent that if it reaches a certain pressure,  it'll go and vent out.  I'm certain the terrorist people unscrew that and just put a bolt in there.  That seems fucking scary to have in your house.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck that.  I don't need my meat that tender.  If that little venting valve plugs up on you, yikes.  So they could kind of look around and see who bought pressure cookers lately. 
[01:02:30]  That's sort of what the FBI does, don't they?  They've got a massive fucking list of people.  They're going to put it together.  They're going to find the serial number, find the lot that it came from.  You think they'll be able to find all that?  They'll trace it back to where the store came from, when it was sold, shit like that.  And perhaps if somebody slipped up, which in some cases they do, you might actually have  some kind of receipt for where this guy or people bought this and get a little more of  a lead.  Maybe there's a camera there in the store of the guy buying it. 
[01:03:00]  It's a lot of options here.  This is where all the cameras help.  Something...  Oh, my leg.  Somebody's going to show up on video, yeah.  I remember the coyote once went up to Bugs Bunny's hole, right?  It's a fucking knot.  It's a cartoon.  Yeah.  And he had carrots and celery and all kinds of stuff.  And he sat in front of the hole and went, and he chopped it up in there.  And then he took a big pressure cooker lid and he stuck it on the hole and screwed the 
[01:03:30]  thing on and started cooking Bugs in the hole with a pressure cooker.  But Bugs came out another hole.  He always figured it out, didn't he?  And then he came up behind him.  He's like, what's cooking, Doc?  Right.  And he fucked with him.  Yeah.  Did he say he made a rabbit stew?  Yes.  Yeah.  He said something like that.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  And then he...  Bugs said there's no rabbit in there or something.  And then the coyote unscrewed it to look.  And he lifted it up and put his head in. 
[01:04:00]  And Bugs stomped down on him and started screwing the thing.  And his legs were sticking out of the top of the pressure cooker.  It was hilarious.  I fucking love Bugs, buddy.  I fucking love it.  People are saying you're wrong about the pressure cooker thing.  What?  I don't know.  Let me see what...  Of course.  Let me see what Vinny in Atlanta has to say about this.  Vinny?  What happened?  Anthony, you're a little bit off on how the pressure cooker works.  What happened?  Water under pressure boils at a higher temperature.  So the meat will cook faster because the water is boiling at like 230 degrees instead of 212. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  So you're saying that it doesn't force the juices in the way Ant was saying it was basically like giant hands making juice go in?  I would assume that if there's pressure around the roast that it's going to, you know, infuse it into the roast.  No?  Sir?  Back to you.  Uh, yeah, that's all I get.  I don't know.  Maybe he's also right about, you know, pressure and temperature, but I don't know. 
[01:05:00]  I thought, doesn't water boil more at lower pressure?  No, that's when you go, like in Colorado, isn't it hard to boil water?  How does that work?  Which way is it?  Which way is it?  Boil water in Colorado?  What is there, no tea?  Everyone who owns a tea shop is fucking starving.  No tea.  No, I think lower pressure water boils faster. 
[01:05:30]  So does water boil faster in the mile-high city than it would at sea level?  Well, I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah, lower pressure is easier.  Okay.  It is.  Yeah, okay, good.  All right.  All right.  White golfer has meltdown and goes on racist tirade on course at two black golfers?  Hey, Anthony, was that you?  I didn't know.  Oh.  If I see one of those.  I didn't know you were at. 
[01:06:00]  I didn't know you were in.  Do you get those?  Hey, look.  Yeah, I get them all the time.  I see yours, too.  The ones that people send you.  Hey, Opie.  I didn't know you were in.  And then it's some picture of some guy that has red hair.  I know.  Yeah.  We all look alike.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not red, by the way.  Do we have any?  It's a little red.  Not all red.  What?  Do we have any Pat Sumrall audio?  We better.  Pat Sumrall.  He's a legend.  He's dead.  What was his most famous call? 
[01:06:30]  That's my question today.  Pat Sumrall's dead.  Pretty sad.  82.  Heart attack, I believe.  He was recovering from surgery for a broken hip.  How long did him and that hip thing work together?  Um, I would guess about three years.  Oh, I thought it was longer.  Yeah.  Actually, 21 years together.  Wow.  I did enjoy those guys.  They were great, weren't they?  Fuck yeah, man.  Sumrall worked 16 Super Bowls. 
[01:07:00]  I mixed him up with the guy from Wide World of Sports.  Oh, Sumrall's.  Which guy from Wide World of Sports?  Oh, the other guy with the light bulb head.  Bill Tetley?  Who was the guy from Wide World of Sports?  Jim McKay.  Oh, Jim McKay.  I mixed him up with Jim McKay.  Okay.  No, Sumrall was.  Yeah.  He was the best.  Okay.  Now I know who he is.  He absolutely was the best.  Sumrall played some ball also, didn't he?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  What?  He was a kicker.  Was?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  We don't have any audio Pat Sumrall's called?  Yeah, we should play one.  Let's play it right now.  Mm-hmm.  Where's the disc?  That's pretty good.  Nobody is leaving the stadium.  Everybody is standing in, and they've been wanting one like this, and now they've got  it this afternoon, a fine Super Bowl game.  And the Cowboys, looking nothing like a corpse, they are very much alive. 
[01:08:00]  And they're teeing up the ball at the 35, and the Steelers are going to have to protect  against the short kickoff.  On the other hand.  Oh, this is Super Bowl.  I bet you that's Super Bowl 13.  Yeah, but it's a...  Dallas lost 35-31.  You're a machine.  If that's right.  But that's not how we all remember Sumrall.  No, it's not that much.  That's young, healthy...  Err.  Err, Sumrall.  Err.  Was that...  But it was a good try, Err.  Yeah.  Was Err.  Was Err playing that?  That's from his early years.  Err.  That was Err. 
[01:08:30]  That's from the early years.  Where was that from, Err?  It says Pat Sumrall talking about Landry.  Oh, okay.  Landry.  I think if you're going to play a Pat Sumrall clip, you've got to do one with Madden.  Of course.  Oh, Err.  Those two made each other's careers.  Yeah.  Err.  You rock's playing fucking Pat Sumrall sings in the shower.  No, we won't.  There's some, right?  There fucking...  Sam's got some.  He was on the phone.  Oh.  All right.  Well, let's...  I'm going to eat my sandwich. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  Why don't you do that?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  God bless you.  God bless you, people.  Where it began.  I can begin to know when 
[01:09:30]  But then I know it's growing strong  Everybody  Was in the spring  Everybody  Then spring became the summer  Who'd have believed you'd come along  Everybody  With hands  Touching hands 
[01:10:00]  Nice tits, lady  Reaching out  Touching me  Touching you  Sweet Caroline  The times never seem so good  I've been inclined  To believe in 
[01:10:30]  The worst-bressed billionaire  I've ever seen  Now I  Look in the night  And it don't seem so lonely  We fill it up with only two  Lovely  And when I hurt  When hurting runs off my shoulders  How can I hurt when holding you 
[01:11:00]  Everybody, how do you want to feel?  Warm  Touching warm  Touch my warm cock  Reaching out  Touching those tits  Touching tits  Touching tits  Touching tits  Touching tits  Sweet Caroline  Oh, oh, oh  The times have never been so good 
[01:11:30]  I've been inclined  Oh, oh, oh  To believe they never were  Oh, no, no, no  A little musical interlude  Ladies and gentlemen  For me to tell you  How much I've loved being here  Talking with everybody  Singing to you people  It's a wonderful crowd  Caroline 
[01:12:00]  The times never seem so good  So good, so good, so good  I've been inclined  To believe they never were  Oh, oh, oh, sweet Caroline  But I've never seemed so good  So good, so good, so good 
[01:12:30]  I've been inclined  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen  Let's hear it for Anthony  You made the song yours  Patrice  Oh, fucking Patrice  Very good  That was fun  That was a good time  How many years ago was that?  18  18 years ago, man  Imagine that  Maybe not  What's happening?  What the fuck? 
[01:13:00]  I don't know what this is  We're asking for Pat Summerall audio  I don't know what this is  What's going on?  What happened?  I'm scared  I'm scared  Sam's got some Madden and Summerall audio  Okay  But, I mean, aside from that  It's tough to pull something specific  Because he didn't have any specifically, you know, famous stuff to go on  No, I know  We just want to  We need audio  Sam's got some  Okay  But, I mean, if you want, like, a CD of just general Pat Summerall audio 
[01:13:30]  I can make that for you  But we need something with him  Because a lot of times on YouTube stuff is pulled because the NFL has intellectual property  Sam's got something  I listen to this in the back office  Some Pat Winterall, too, or something  Yeah, I'll fucking spring  The point being, Pat Summerall died  Yes, he did  And a lot of us loved how he called a football game  I thought he stunk  What do you got there, Sam? 
[01:14:00]  Set up the clip, please  I can't  What?  This is John Madden and Pat Summerall in pre-blowout mode  During a 1996 game between the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins  I like what he said, Brett Favre's name  Someone said it on Twitter  He would say, Favre  Really?  Yeah, Pat Summerall had a great way of saying Favre's name  When you end up right back there  You've got to have another word for it  Three wide receiver set up  Jairus McPhail, the ball carrier 
[01:14:30]  Gets up close to a first down  What great amounts of was  And he gets it  Who's this guy right here?  Oh, Burt Reynolds  Yeah  Who's the lady next to him?  Right here  Yes  Ann-Margaret?  Yes  Huh?  How's that?  Didn't you coach Burt Reynolds?  Yes, I did  At Florida State?  Yes  Was he any good?  He was a defensive back  I know  Was he any good, I said  He probably wasn't  He had a good personality  Ah, those guys can't play  He was a good personality  That's McPhail 
[01:15:00]  Have you ever seen a defensive back  Have you ever seen a defensive back with a good personality  Was any good?  Well, that's too many qualifications  Defensive backs usually don't have nice personalities  And linebackers don't either  I mean, linebackers, you know, they're all half goofy  You know, they've got their eyes, you know, staring and looking and crossed  Now, the nice guys are like this guy here  Jason Garrett  He could be a nice guy  Yeah, I mean, you know, third quarterback  Where's the cap?  Went to Princeton  Should be in politics  Has all those things going for him 
[01:15:30]  These guys like this guy here, Charles Haley  Nope  No  There are any other teams  There's no mystery about that  I love the circle thing  This guy  Somebody jumped second down at about seven  This clip sucks  It's awful  Terrible  I mean, I know  It's Pat Summerall doing play by the way  It truly is Pat Summerall  They just knew how to call a game, though  That's a blowout  And they made you stay tuned  Because you knew they were going to do some schtick  Little Burt Reynolds material in there 
[01:16:00]  John Madden's on his little etch-a-sketch  Going crazy  Well, you forgot how great Madden was as well  Well, he had that pen in his hand  He got a bit old in the end there  Yeah, he loved that fucking telestrator  That was what, 96?  Yeah  Once that telestrator was not new technology anymore  Madden was lost  Oh, he loved it  He made that thing huge  Yeah  Madden  Boom  Look, circle him  Yeah, I know you're talking about Burt Reynolds  Yeah  Just circle him  Obviously  Who's this guy over here?  Burt Reynolds  He's axing out 
[01:16:30]  There's one player on the screen  There's no reason to mark him  Put an X on him  I'll say it again, man  Madden, when he was doing his announcing  Used to live in the hood  My hood  The Upper West Side  Oh, that's not quite the hood  Oh, it is the hood  And he was a miserable fuck  When he used to walk around Columbus Avenue  Really?  And I've been in many a restaurant with the same guy  Not even a restaurant  There's a little place I like to go for what I like to call a chicken plate  You get the chicken, Middle Eastern style 
[01:17:00]  With the rice and the salad  It's nice, right?  Ooh  And I've been in that joint with him a bunch of times  And it's tiny  It's smaller than this room  It's just one of those little tiny little fucking joints  And he  Miserable guy  Not a pleasant gentleman  Not in the least  Made it very clear to everyone  You don't approach him even  But he doesn't look like a nice guy  I was too scared to even approach him  To maybe get a photograph or something  I would have loved a photograph of John Madden  That's why his name is not John Niceman  That is 
[01:17:30]  John Madden instead of John Niceman  Well  Or John Haffeyton  Yeah, those are words you're saying  How about John Joy Haffeyton?  You want to watch Madden and Summerall open the 31st Super Bowl?  Yeah, why don't we do that?  What the fuck?  What year was that?  I don't know  1962?  No, it was much later than that  Oh, I do know  I do know that Summerall did golf as well  And the Masters in general  But, you know  We know him from football 
[01:18:00]  It's 96, I bet  But Summerall was great at whatever fucking he announced  But people were like  What about golf?  Alright, but we know him more for football, don't we?  Football  Yeah, he wasn't a great golfer  97 is  He was the announcer for golf  I made it up  That doesn't mean he had to be a great golfer  Yeah, I made that up  No, he didn't  Was he a drunk?  Was Summerall a drunk?  I think so  I said I did  Everyone in broadcasting drinks  What happened?  Did something good?  No, he said Super Bowl 30 
[01:18:30]  And I just pulled out 96  But then he says 31  I'm like, oh, it's 97  Oh, that's very good  Oh, it is  I have a knowledge that is beyond all knowledge  Who played in the 97 Super Bowl?  A couple teams  Do you know offhand?  Not offhand  Why don't we let Pat and John tell us  If I look him up, I'll know him  I'm going to go with the Pats  No, not 97  Yeah, I think 97 was the Pats  No, Pat's Giants  Pat's Giants?  No  No, Pat's and Cardinals?  No, Pat's and Green Bay 
[01:19:00]  Yes, I know  I swear to God I know this  Go, Pat, Go  Go, Pat, Go  Our famous Super Bowl prank calls  That were good back in the day  I don't know if they hold up  And we were in Boston  I do know this one  That call definitely holds up  Which one?  Go, Pat, Go  Yeah  The Green Bay  The pizza joint?  The tickets  Right?  Well, which one holds up?  We did a few  The one where you made  Whoever run outside  Oh, you think that holds up?  Yeah, I do  I do  That's funny  It's pretty wacky 
[01:19:30]  Do we have that, E-Rock?  I want to see if it holds up  I haven't heard it in years  Oh, boy  As wacky as it is  You still got the person to do that  And that's what's funny about it  It was amazing how stupid that person was  Yeah  I just don't  I just can't hear that voice anymore  Meaning my voice from 97  I can't hear it anymore  That over-the-top excitement  And we got to be over-the-top, extreme  A bit hacked  Yeah, we guys were young  A bit hacked  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[01:20:00]  Guys were young wild men  You want to replay that?  Oh, boy  I hate any of this stuff  I think it's in the back  I gotta go get it  You're a little Pat Summerall  While we're waiting?  Yeah, a little Pat Summerall  That's some impressions, maybe  Yeah, of course it was the Pats and the Packers  97  We were up in Boston  At the only station that really rocks  Pat Summerall here with John Madden  And all that build-up  And all of this hoopla, John  Is it as big as it seems?  I think it's bigger than it seems  And if you're one of these players  Or one of these coaches 
[01:20:30]  It's the biggest thing in your life  And it's something that  There are 30 teams in the league  And there are 30 teams of players and coaches  And every one of them want to be here today  And then you say, well, how big is that?  It's even bigger than that  Because it's not just getting here today  This is Babel  It's winning today  And I think that  The biggest difference in sports  Yeah  And so you gotta give it a little time  What, how long?  15 minutes long?  No, we're not listening to 15 minutes  Let Pat Summerall jump in  You know how Pat does 
[01:21:00]  Oh, I'm a big fan of eating up time  There are two survivors  The Patriots and the Packers  They're gonna play finally  After all this build-up  And all this being caged up  The players and the coaches  Nope  It's not a VCR glitch  It's a VCR tape  It's alright  It's a tracking problem  Oh  It's a good start  We talked to Bill  Wow  Drew Bledsoe  Drew Bledsoe  Oh my god  Is he still playing?  That's the way  Drew Bledsoe  We're gonna give him plays  That he likes  Plays that he has confidence  Bledsoe 
[01:21:30]  Holy shit  Can we hear the impression please  That Anthony stumbled on?  That's all I'm thinking about  Oh really?  Oh my god  Yeah, let's go to this  That guy's great  So much for your Pat Summerall clip  Yeah  The  Sorry Jimmy  He's dead  There's this guy named Max Cook  It's spelled like  Cock  You know, like Jim Cook  Spells it  K-O-C-H  But it's Max Cook  He does a Tony Soprano impression  That is fucking  Spot on 
[01:22:00]  It's crazy good  And he also does a Christopher impression  And Syl  And fucking Paulie Walnuts  Oh he does all of them?  Yeah  Oh I only heard Christopher and Tony  Yeah, he does like all of them  And he puts together these little fucking scenarios  With all of them  But his Tony Soprano is like fucking dead on  And his Christopher's really good too  His body language with the Christopher's good  Because the head's going back  Who is this guy?  I don't know 
[01:22:30]  These clips are five years old  God, this guy should be on a stage doing this shit  They have a lot of views though, right?  Yeah, it's like 250,000 views on these  250 in five years, you know?  But yeah, since I've been watching The Sopranos  I've been going through the whole thing  Last night  I got the pleasure of watching  I love you, Johnny Cakes  Oh, you're up to that point  Dude, it was so  It was just as disturbing watching it again  Didn't everyone kill themselves?  Johnny Cakes killed himself  I gotta play Johnny Cakes  There's one scene where 
[01:23:00]  Where they get into bed together  And you know  They're laying in bed  And Vito rolls over  And Johnny Cakes fucking rolls against him  And you know that  You know what's coming  And then they cut to  Bobby Bacala's train set  And it's the train going into the tunnel  Dude, it's fucking hilarious  So on purpose  So fucking on purpose  I hate when Johnny Cakes wants to fuck 
[01:23:30]  And Vito goes  Oh, you have to wait for that  Because he's cooking him dinner  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  It was so disturbing  To watch these men kissing  And shit  It was fucking horrible to watch  Bunch of peckers  Horrible  And another scene that was  Fuck it  It had me cracking up  Like, it's just shit I missed  When Carm went to Paris  And she's like just mesmerized  I hated that  I know, I did too  Stunk it  But she's mesmerized by the artwork 
[01:24:00]  And the statues  And she's just looking  Like lovingly  At this beautiful statue  And they left the shot there  For quite a while  And they directly cut  Right to  Syl and Tony  And a guy on a ladder  Against the Bada Bing sign  And it goes right from that  To Syl going  Make sure you scrape that shit  Off her tit  From the artwork to that  It was fucking hilarious  What her reality really is  That she lives with 
[01:24:30]  Make sure you scrape that shit  Off her tit  Very funny  Fucking great  So this guy  Must have been searching  Something online  And you found him  And I found this guy  You just stumbled upon this guy  Yeah  Holy fuck  Put it up on our Facebook page  E-Rock  Opie and Anthony on Facebook  Put his whole  His entire  Catalog  Yeah, his YouTube channel  I don't think  That might not even be  His YouTube channel  Oh, Bowler Hat  Yeah, it is  His whole YouTube channel  What's his YouTube channel  For the people out there  Bowler Hat  Oh, Bowler Hat

I love some tomatoes  Some crisp lettuce  A pickle or two  Placed discreetly  Yeah, but they never give you  They never give you  The nice lettuce  In New York City  When you order  A fucking burger  It's the wilted  See-through shit  They give you 
[01:48:30]  Don't throw a fucking pickle  On top of the burger  And wrap it in that paper either  But you unwrap it  And you got a  Top of the  Your bun is green water  Mushy green  Pickle water  On your fucking bun  It's a touchy situation  I was going to say  You almost sound like  Hey, Tom  Did you hear my joke  Or something?  Pickle juice  Fucking pickle juice  On my burger  You got it down too  No, no  Let's make some videos  I wish  Let's make some videos  That guy does such a good  Tony Soprano impression  It's crazy

No  And then get in a time machine  And do it  Okay  Ha ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  You just spoiled your closer  Hey  Tell the MC  What have you done  When I screwed the pickle thing  Just get ready to come back up  Shut up  Help me out of my purse  You can go after me  But going after me on stage  Is just  You're just hurting yourself  No I never know  You're hurting yourself  I never do  Sure I'm hurting myself  Cause I'm bumping in all those  Empty chairs on the way 
[01:50:00]  Holy shit  No, Rich is fucking great on stage.  His delivery is completely different than it is here on the show, by the way, too.  You have a very relaxed delivery on stage.  It's fucking great.  And you're, it's not just, you're known for being brutal to the crowd.  You can fucking rip apart the crowd.  But your fucking, just your act is very, very funny.  Thank you.  I've seen Rich quite a few times, and he's fucking great, man.  Thank you.  I'll never goof on your fucking act. 
[01:50:30]  But here's the thing.  Hey, I'm very relaxed in here now.  You're shaking.  See, you are.  You're on medication.  You're shaking or something.  I'm on medication.  So, Rich sprinkles Xanax on your fucking oatmeal.  And you also said you're numb to the whole Boston Marathon bar.  No, I'm not numb to that.  I'm numb to just so much tragedy in this fucking world.  Aren't we getting desensitized?  Like, something like this.  Not too bad.  Years ago, something like this, and the way they're presenting it now and everything,  would have been literally shocking. 
[01:51:00]  They call it shocking.  They say, oh, this is a shocking terrorist event.  But in reality, and it's a sad state of affairs here, we're not shocked.  We're not shocked.  We look at it.  We've seen so much shit on the internet and on the news that we don't look at it and put  our hands over our mouths and go, oh, my God.  It's just, oh, that happened.  This is the world we live in.  That happened.  All the newsmen were talking about how they were so, what they were shocked about up there  in Boston was people were going about their lives and jogging and walking their dogs and 
[01:51:30]  playing with their kids.  They were amazed.  They couldn't believe that was going on.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just, we're really getting desensitized to tragedy.  Like, I'll, after Connecticut, I mean, that brought, on mic, please, that brought to you.  On mic.  That brought to you, Connecticut, you know.  It's the newest voice.  He ignores the microphone.  So far, he's done everything he's done during every other appearance.  The audience ignores what's going into it.  Wow, you heard me when I said I want coffee? 
[01:52:00]  You fucking rule.  Like, you read stuff on the internet, and then you go, is this really, can this really  happen?  Like, a 15-year-old rape victim in some horrible Middle Eastern country who's the victim gets  a hundred lashes.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and you sit there going, who thinks, you know, what kind of insane fucking laws.  Where did that happen?  Like Saudi.  They did that in Saudi Arabia.  I don't fucking, in one of those Arab countries, she was raped. 
[01:52:30]  They do blame the rape victim over there.  And we're friends with all these dog shit countries.  Yeah, the second you start bitching about, you know, human rights violations and stuff,  just stop and look at what, look at what pals we have around the globe.  Saudi Arabia, really?  Fucking, they're horrid.  China, horrid to their people.  But, you know, we do business with them.  Man.  Man.  So, Rich, who do you think did this up there in Boston? 
[01:53:00]  Who knows?  You know, everybody, and this is the truth.  Let's go around the room.  Maybe I'm wrong, but people want it to be terrorism.  Because they don't, just like.  It is terrorism.  Well, I mean, they want it to be.  International terrorism?  Just like when, uh, happened up in Connecticut, the school.  Yeah.  All the stuff online about the theories that it was, uh, you know, bullshit, a hoax, or not,  you know, like, what do you, what's the word is, you know, uh. 
[01:53:30]  Huh?  A cover.  Conspiracy.  Conspiracy you're going with?  Okay.  When they said that about, uh, in Connecticut, people really wanted to believe it was.  No.  A small percentage of people.  No, because everyone else is smart enough to understand how, what really is going on.  You wanted to believe it was a conspiracy, because then you're thinking, well, all these  kids didn't die.  So, you know what I mean?  Oh, Jesus.  Holy fuck.  What are you talking about?  That would be a hell of a conspiracy. 
[01:54:00]  Of course everyone.  Who thought it was that?  Everyone knew they were dead.  Everyone knew they were dead.  Did you read all that conspiracy bullshit?  Yeah, there's like a small percent of one percent of people that buy into that.  But they don't care about those kids.  They are conspiracy theorists for different reasons, not because they care about the kids  being alive.  Listen, I'm not saying I thought it was.  I'm saying you want it to be, because then you think maybe.  But we all know it wasn't even close to being true.  Did you look at that stuff that was online?  Yeah.  How they were connected?  Oh, my God.  You're going to love our next guest.  Alex Jones will be on our show in five minutes. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let's enjoy.  Alex Jones.  What are you talking about?  You really believed half that shit?  No, I don't believe it.  I say you want to believe it.  Are you fucking idiots?  I'm not saying I believe it.  You can't believe that stuff.  We had a, well, I should shut up.  We had an inside track, and trust me, it was real.  We heard details that the fucking thing.  I don't think anybody thinks it didn't happen.  I never heard that.  No. 
[01:55:00]  Not that.  So who do you think did it?  I think it's a local guy.  Yeah, I think it's a local guy that's, I don't know why yet, obviously, but it has  to be a local guy.  You can find a crowd anywhere in America.  Someone's disgruntled.  Some kind of militia.  So is a local guy disgruntled saying, oh, here we go, big, it's marathon day.  This is perfect for me.  No, it's one of these.  Because they would have found a crowd a long time ago in a fucking mall or some kind of  fucking street festival anywhere.  Somebody raised the point, though, maybe, I mean, it could have been because of Patriot's 
[01:55:30]  Day, but somebody raised the point that it was a, could have been a New York City marathon  intended.  I saw that.  But because they canceled the marathon.  They said, fuck it, let's go to that one.  Yeah, it's obviously, look, I think it's a lone person or two.  Do you think it's a local guy?  Do you think?  I don't know if they're Arabic or not or Middle Eastern or not.  I mean, local to the Boston area.  If it's an Arab, it's not an Arab that came over and was sent with Saudi money and stuff.  It's some guy that thinks he's going to, you know, hey, look at me.  I'm of Arab descent and I'm going to do this. 
[01:56:00]  I don't, that maybe, and even that wouldn't be international.  I think it's probably a domestic incident.  It's probably, yeah, it's somebody disgruntled with the government.  Yeah, on tax day?  Yeah.  But tax day fell on, you know, marathon day.  So it's not easy just to say tax day.  Well, doesn't it?  Well, if it was a protest about taxes or a hatred of the government, April 15th. 
[01:56:30]  And then it all just lines up, right?  Yeah.  It just happens to work out well, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you could have said, hey, April 15th.  Is the Boston Marathon on tax day every year?  I don't think so.  Because it's always on a Monday, so the day changes year to year.  Yeah, yeah.  It changes.  But, you know, obviously you know that in advance.  If you go, yeah, we want to protest taxes, what can we do?  Well, let's bomb something on the 15th.  Holy fuck, the Boston Marathon.  Oh, what's going on on the 15th?  Oh, the Boston Marathon.  Gotcha.  You know, you've got a pretty good advance knowledge of that. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, I think it's going to lean towards one of those.  Yeah, I think it probably will be an anti-government person in one way or another.  Somebody who doesn't like what's going on.  Well, Mickey or Mikey looks...  Mickey?  Mickey, probably.  Joe.  You're going to be in Philly this weekend, Rich Voss?  Yes, at Helium.  Helium Comedy Club.  Wednesday through Saturday.  Very good.  This guy wants to explain what you were trying to say a moment ago.  Go ahead, sir.  All right, let me try to sort through...  I speak douche. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, right, have some fucking banana.  Oh, shit.  All right, so the reality that one guy was so fucked up in the head that he went and wiped  out a whole school full of little kids is awful.  And we would rather believe that it's a government conspiracy or some, you know, group of guys  in black trench coats in the, you know, the room playing it is more palatable, and we want  to believe that rather than the actual truth that society is fucked beyond belief.  Oh, that's a good one.  We'd rather believe that the government is capable of doing horrific things like that 
[01:58:00]  and hide the sleep at night.  It makes you feel more in control when you think it's a planned and carefully thought  out thing.  The randomness of one guy that's with Kennedy or with anything, being able to change things  or it makes it so unpredictable and it makes you feel helpless.  That's why conspiracy theorists, it's part of the motivation.  Does things like that, doesn't make you feel helpless?  No, not as much so, because you still have control, you still have faith in the power  of the government.  Let me explain to this moron that's trying to explain to me. 
[01:58:30]  If you read these...  Moron, he explained it pretty well there.  No, he said, no, but he's getting it wrong.  Right.  If you read these conspiracy theories, they were saying none of it happened, it was all  actors and the timing.  Actors.  They were saying, yes.  Childish idiots.  That's crazy.  That's like the people that said one of the 9-11 plays landed in Cleveland.  When did you stop believing it, though?  I never believed it.  It's horse shit.  I knew that stuff.  What, all the parents are just great actors and actresses?  Yeah, how do you fucking mind this? 
[01:59:00]  Listen to me.  I didn't believe it.  I said, you want to believe it.  I don't know, I think part of you were thinking, all right, that's possible.  Boss.  What?  Are you talking the same thing that nobody wants to believe that the Holocaust happened,  that they want to think it's all fake and the moon landing and everything else?  It didn't happen.  I know relatives that were there.  It was, there were more resorts than you think.  Yeah, but it's the same people who want to believe that bullshit because they don't want  to accept reality, right?  I'm a Jew.  Obviously, it happened. 
[01:59:30]  It wasn't.  The problem wasn't that you're a Jew.  The problem is he's a comedian.  No, of course, yes.  Not why Jimmy was shaking his head in disgust.  Oh, no.  Yes, but there's no, people that deny the Holocaust don't have these big theories and they don't  put, you know, these scenarios together.  They just say, it didn't happen.  It's bullshit.  Okay?  But after what happened in Connecticut, you go online and they had these, I mean, they 
[02:00:00]  do great work at piecing all this bullshit together.  Well, you could take it after the fact and make whatever kind of story you want out of  it.  You're not willing to admit that a part of you believed that some of this shit is possible.  No, no.  Jimmy, he's changing his tune.  No, I'm not.  You don't get it.  I never believed it.  You want to believe it.  I'm pretty good at putting the pieces together.  You want to believe it so you don't, so you're going, this didn't happen.  Do you understand?  You want to believe it was a fucking play or a movie set. 
[02:00:30]  Well, conspiracy guys do that, you know, the news always gets things wrong when an event  first happens and the conspiracy guys take all the info because they think everything  the news says and shows you is real.  And then they go with that shit.  Like look at what the Boston Marathon bombing, they said there were four bombs.  Now, officially there is absolutely only two, but the conspiracy theory, the guys are  already going to run with the, uh, that there were four bombs, but they're hiding the other  two from us for whatever reason.  But that's just the news not doing their job. 
[02:01:00]  That's right.  Did you ever see some of those videos after you made them?  See?  No, I'm just saying, did you see them?  What videos?  After what?  I don't know the title.  Sandy Hook?  After Sandy Hook.  Just call it after Sandy Hook.  After Sandy Hook.  Which videos?  What?  I don't know.  These conspirators, like we were watching, Bonnie and I watched one of them and like I  said, you, you can't, like you can't cover up something.  You can't be that good.  So what was, what was the push?  Was it the gun in the trunk? 
[02:01:30]  That one?  Dad, uh, uh, kids, uh, families meeting with Obama with different, I don't remember because  it happened so long ago.  Yeah.  Wait, but different what?  Just look at it.  No, you brought it to our show.  So what do you know about it?  Tell us.  I don't remember.  I'm just saying.  I don't have time to go look at this.  What do you mean I don't have time?  What'd you say about?  Just forget one sunset.  It's all fake shit.  It's, it's fake.  No, I know it's fake.  What are you talking about?  The, the, the parents and the families meeting with Obama?  What's the point there?  Part of that that, that it looked like the, uh, the picture was, uh, altered and I don't 
[02:02:00]  remember.  I don't remember.  All I know is you sat there, you're watching and go, it would be great if this didn't happen.  That's all.  As a person and a parent.  Here's one prime example from Connecticut that, that, uh, these conspiracy assholes were,  were running with.  They had a helicopter view of the, uh, cops taking, uh, weapon out of the trunk of the  asshole's car.  Uh, the reports were that he went in and used, uh, an AR-15 assault rifle in the school. 
[02:02:30]  And then they said, well, here they are taking it out of the trunk.  Obviously he didn't use, uh, the assault rifle.  They didn't look into the fact that the model shotgun that he used or didn't use and left  in the trunk wasn't your normal standard granddad's shotgun.  It looked exactly like a larger version of an AR-15.  It had a removable magazine for shotgun shells.  It had all the, uh, plastic, uh, rails and, and whatnot. 
[02:03:00]  So people, instead of saying, wow, that's a shotgun that looks like an AR-15 went, oh,  how did the AR-15 get inside if it was in the trunk?  When meanwhile, it's, there's completely logical and reasonable explanation that that was the  shotgun, uh, but they never, they never want to, they never deal with logic.  No.  Because with the, let's just go with the one at hand here, the Boston Marathon bombing,  the Saudi guy.  Yeah.  Watch the conspiracy of people going around with that.  Oh, really? 
[02:03:30]  That he was cleared.  The government actually took him away to live somewhere else.  And his family dealt with George Bush.  Right.  He wasn't supposed to be caught and they caught him.  So obviously now the government says, you know, he has nothing to do with this and  they've already, uh, relocated him somewhere else.  And yeah, you know, yeah, it's all, but you don't think, you don't think, I think the  government, I think the government does shit.  Okay.  Okay.  But to the, to the level of like, uh, the Sandy Hook incident and, or this, uh, Boston 
[02:04:00]  marathon bombing.  No, I don't think so.  There's a clip.  No, I don't think the, you know, the government, the whole nine 11 thing was a conspiracy.  No, there's a conspiracy clip online that shows, uh, from the marathon, it has some  guy standing and, uh, there's, he's by the crowd right after the blast.  And you see this, uh, human tissue, some type of meaty looking bloody thing next to him  to his right.  And then as he moves to his right, uh, and crosses in front of it, the second he crosses, 
[02:04:30]  it's gone.  And there's like some piece of metal there.  I don't know what that means, what it's supposed to mean, what the fuck.  Are they going with that already?  Yeah.  Maybe that it's, I don't need, I don't even know what they're going with.  Could I see the video?  No, but they're saying that it like the blood disappeared.  I, I saw someone tweeting about that this piece of like the blood or the human or the  guts or the, whatever, some kind of a goopy piece of already starting to take real little 
[02:05:00]  things and go with that.  Some video is altered and things like that.  I just hate them.  Both sides are already trying to, uh, political, make this political.  Like, you know, the right, the right, you know, they're ridiculous.  The right is going that Obama said.  Oh, sorry.  Okay, yeah, let's, let's take a look at this.  So what is, uh, the title of this video?  Turn it up.  I can't see it, Sam.  Let's see what this is.  Make it bigger.  The hell.  Okay.  This is.  Okay.  The video I have up on my MSM implying we need to give up our freedoms. 
[02:05:30]  Yes.  Oh, God.  All right, can we pause because this is going to take a while and we got Alex Jones on  line.  Oh, okay.  Alex.  Alex Jones.  Thank you for your service.  I love that.  What's up, Alex?  Nothing.  I was on Coast to Coast AM.  I had like three hours sleep.  The alarm went off.  Yeah.  We always get this.  We always get the sleepy version of you.  You always get the. 
[02:06:00]  That's a good dingy one, though.  Have you been, uh, have you been, uh, trying to catch some Z's in your, uh, in your war  room over there?  I've seen your videos.  Yeah, I'm telling you, man, I look, listen, when every movie and every TV show, along with  the real government training manual says the libertarian donors are imminently about to  do IEDs and they are going to attack you and we're going to have to wage war.  The enemy is not Al Qaeda anymore. 
[02:06:30]  It is the American people.  Now you wait.  They're going to bomb in a minute, in a minute, in a minute.  Get ready.  What do you do when they attack boys and girls?  We give our rights up.  That's right.  And then, and then it happens and it's perfectly photo finished.  90% is completely staged.  10% chance that it could be some long person.  It'll probably be provocateur.  And the media was like, oh my God, how dare Alex Jones come out and say that this could  be staged. 
[02:07:00]  He's so crazy.  Look, he says in his tweet that most of it's at the Apple Vodka Turd.  That's the New York Times.  They go find a million people and they sit there.  I mean, in 1993, the New York Times report that the first World Trade Center bombing, they  found two literally mentally retarded people.  You know, who are like...  And they gave them a show and they went to Boston.  Exactly.  Exactly what happened.  Alex, I just, I got to ask you, I got to ask you something now here. 
[02:07:30]  I got some questions for you.  What do you think this is, if it isn't indeed just a random bombing of the parade?  What is your idea of what this is?  Spell it out for us.  It is a false flag, self-inflicted wound for the giant, grandstanding, huge police state.  Even if you think the military-industrial complex has, like, eaten America, you know, like somebody 
[02:08:00]  eating a hot dog at a Yankees game.  Get ready, because they're really going to gobble our ass up now.  Now, and even if it is real, even if this is that, you know, rare, real event that will  do happen, this is grandstanding, big time.  And even if you believe in the war on terror, they, Obama, all week long, since they're  signing death orders, where sometimes they've killed 200-plus people at a wedding, where  there's one bad guy that I think they're getting, and they'll drop a 1,000-pound bomb right 
[02:08:30]  in the middle of the wedding.  I mean, I've seen the firing photos and videos, never on our news.  It looks like a soup of sloppy joes, and you're not going to hear a little, little, little  such-and-such, she was three years old, her old future, until she was blown in half by  shrapnel.  You know, Obama's like, there's bombs and innocents being targeted.  I've got to agree with you on that one.  I'm also going to agree with you on the fact that I'm not sure, and I doubt the fact that  the government is so involved in random bombings around this country. 
[02:09:00]  But I will admit to the believing that I think they use anything that happens to gain more  power for themselves and to take liberties away from the American people.  That I absolutely do agree with.  So that's all, and there's this incredible spin machine, you know, going on immediately  going, you don't care about the three people that died and the 1,000 unless you completely 
[02:09:30]  bend over and ask Homeland Security to drive a bus up your ass.  I mean, this is what's going on, and I personally can just see it coming from a mile away.  But listen, I turn on any show, Hawaii Five-0, you know, the new generation of minions or whatever  it's called, and you turn it on, and it's like, this episode, this gruntled veteran shooting  cops.  Can McGarrett stop them?  I've heard of the next show. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, this is the following.  Top psychopaths.  Who do they love hiring?  Who are the worst people of this class of killers?  Yeah.  We're not just psychopathic killers.  We're constitutionalists, extremists, and all the psychos.  Oh, my God.  Well, that is true.  I think the mainstream media, TV shows, news are painting patriots and people that want  the Constitution adhered to as some type of crazy, rebellious murderers. 
[02:10:30]  But, you know, Alex, you talk a lot about the civil liberties being taken away.  And in some cases, I'm right, I mean, you're right, but like with the TSA, I understand  they can be irritating, but I find this hatred of the TSA almost irrational, because I deal  with them a lot, because I travel so frequently, and they're annoying, but do you really, do  you not want anybody first when they go on a plane?  Like, what is the alternative?  They're going to have a job. 
[02:11:00]  I think we should all drag our children off into a private room.  No, I'm not saying that there's not, I agree.  I think potbelly guys, little, tiny, creepy mustaches with twinkly eyes.  I mean, I think my wife is there for them, too.  Well, you know, this is what they, no, no, no, no, listen.  I've had so many TSA people go, hey, can I have an autograph?  I'm going to bash the hell out of them.  Sure.  Or, hey, man, hey, man, we're not all bad.  And then, like, oh, I mean, I've actually seen things to the airport where they're like, 
[02:11:30]  heck, go ahead and go on through.  You know, just all sorts of stories like that.  So, I'm aware of things.  I mean, I had Shooter Jennings, you know, Waylon Jennings,  shot in the studio like a week ago.  And off air, he talked about it.  Plus, we taped something we're going to air next week.  And he talked about how he'd been out on a cruise ship.  Somebody gave him a joint.  He didn't even think about it.  And then he came to touch him, flying back home.  And he pulls out stuff out of his pocket.  And there's a joint.  And he drops it on the ground. 
[02:12:00]  You know, like, thinking, oh, my God.  And the TSA guy goes, you can go on through now.  And, like, picks up the joint and basically hands it back to him.  So, I get that some of them aren't bad.  But I'll bet there were, like, nice guards.  Like, some guards were, like, at Dockow and Auschwitz.  No, no, but...  Listen, I'm sorry.  I'm going to have to shoot you in the head.  That's my job.  No, Alex, but I'm asking you, I understand that.  And I know that there's pricks who work for the TSA.  There's, like, some of them, like, mall security cops.  They go way too far in their race.  I understand that. 
[02:12:30]  But I'm talking about the general attitude where people are like,  you're fucking TSA.  They're taking our rights.  They're taking our...  You would like a transvestite to do your...  Transsexual.  Transvestite's a guy in a dress.  I don't go for that.  A transsexual is a much better egg.  Okay, okay.  But I'm saying, how does that remove our civil liberties?  You know what?  I don't know why they're saying right-wingers probably did this.  I mean, why aren't they saying, hey, it could be the government  or elements they stand to gain  or defense contractors that want to sell $15 million of robots  to every city, which is now happening,  or, you know, some foreign corporation that was, like, doing something. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, it could be a loan mental patient.  But you know...  Listen, here's an example.  Take...  Thank you for your service.  I can't see...  I actually can't do the voice right now because I'm so, so tired.  It still sounds like I'm...  I still want to know how the TSA rhymes with our civil liberties, though.  A fighter.  I'm curious.  Here, do it for me.  I love you.  He's such a good guy.  Hold on.  Can you do it?  What?  A fighter.  There you go.  Oh, governor. 
[02:13:30]  I've seen things that will blow your mind.  That's it.  There it is.  Listen, all I can say is, if you think you've had your freedom of gang rape so far, get ready.  But take the Holmes guy from the Aurora attack, who was getting, like, $30,000 a year in a DARPA program.  By the way, the Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, look it up.  He was in MKUltra.  That got declassified.  But it's like, never mind that the Unabomber was in an admitted CIA mind control program from the 1960s. 
[02:14:00]  Just forget that.  It's not even a part of it.  James Holmes was not a Navy SEAL, was not a fighter.  But what he was, before the DARPA program, with an Air Force top psychiatrist over him, everybody knew what he was planning.  And they've now ignored all that.  And now they're saying, oh, we're drugging him for the trial to make him tell the truth.  Listen, my dad's a dentist. 
[02:14:30]  I can come to your house and give you a halcyon, the right milligram strength.  Let's make a time.  And pull your teeth out with pliers, buddy.  And you wouldn't even remember any of it.  And if I told you, if I strangled a kid and then woke any of you guys up and said, you did it, you would go on the stand and believe you did it.  Okay?  So they're now putting him on truth serum.  It's not really truth serum. 
[02:15:00]  It makes you say whatever the hell they want.  Alex, now you're talking mind control.  Hold on.  So hold on.  My huggy bear.  So Alex, you think that James Holm, what was the last, let me ask you honestly, what's the last event that happened?  Because you believe in a conspiracy for 9-11.  And what's the last event that happened that you just take at face value and think did just happen as the act of a random nut or whatever? 
[02:15:30]  Like without any government nonsense or direct, what's the last one you think was that happened?  I know an event that had all the evidence of being random and all the evidence of a motive.  And it was Joe Stack who flew his plane into the IRS building here in Austin, Texas.  Right.  I remember that one.  And they took his house and he didn't really owe the money.  They were harassing him.  And they burned his house down and flew his private plane.  He said, here, you want all my possessions?  Take it with interest.  So that was a real event. 
[02:16:00]  But listen, all I'm saying is everyone has to get ready because they're planning to implode the economy.  They're already taking people's back jumps in Europe.  And, I mean, my God, the training manuals that are coming out are like, veterans will attack your police station.  Everyone will be hit by IEDs.  IEDs, every city needs, you know, these $5 million apiece robots.  You will be attacked for something that, you know, is like so rare. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  It's incredible.  I mean, people die by the thousands every year from falling in vast time.  And now it's like they're going to take each child or each person that was killed and build.  And, again, I feel sorry for it, but it's like they're going to build statues and they're going to, like, dangle them in front of me.  And I knew the minute it happened and it's now all over the news, they're like, Al-Qaeda, right wing.  Yeah, yeah.  Libertarian.  But, Alex, what's the end game, though?  What's the end game here? 
[02:17:00]  What's the goal of this government entity?  Well, I mean, the United States is the world empire.  The United States has all the money, still has all the power, has one of the ideas.  We're a great country.  And these corporate interests that aren't free market, they already conquered the world using our muscles, or most of it.  And the goal is the establishment wants us all living under a 10-21, on record, is totally porn bankrupt, while they are Kim Jong-un up in the seven-story pleasure palace with all the transsexuals. 
[02:17:30]  So, the plan is, they're off, you know, doing all their weird decadent crap, ruling over us, and we can't go in a McDonald's without a proctology cam, you know, with a giant government make-work project.  I mean, FDR built dams, our government's going to tear dams down, turn off power plants, and to make work, they're going to be training you to line up and get on the cattle cars.  This is all slave training.  All right, but I have a question, I honestly want to know, and I mean, it's a simple question, but it's been a very big point for guys who are very anti-government. 
[02:18:00]  And I, again, I'll say it again, I know the TSA is unpleasant at times, but how, no, no, but I really mean this, how have they taken our civil liberties in that situation?  Thank you for your service.  No, no.  No, but I'm honestly curious, because people hate, people really hate them, and in some ways I get it. 
[02:18:30]  You're right, you're right, you're right.  Listen, it's good that the borders are basically wide open every time.  No, no, absolutely right.  The borders should be closed.  Every time the senators go down there and go, look, we've secured the borders like illegals, just pouring over it.  And my whole issue is...  Great point.  It'd be great to have the illegal aliens here.  If they weren't given welfare and all this other crap, a lot of them are really hard-working people, by the way.  I think he answered it perfectly for you, Jimmy.  By the way, you are right.  I agree, the borders should be closed. 
[02:19:00]  And I think it's...  I'm only curious, because the borders are open, does not mean that the TSA has violated our civil liberties.  I'm only curious as to how the TSA is a violation of our civil liberties, or what they're doing...  I don't think there's any way to have our civil liberties violated.  I think they should all drop us in the boiling batch of peanut oil at the airport.  You know, just to make sure there's not, like...  Well, let me tell you why.  This is going to make sense.  To make sure there's not explosives in our testicles. 
[02:19:30]  All right, listen.  And then the boiling peanut oil will neutralize the explosives.  All right, listen.  Listen, someone in Boston wants in badly.  It's Lindsey.  You're on with Alex Jones.  Lindsey.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I just want to tell you that this whole thing is fucking bullshit.  My friend Jeff Bowman is lying in the hospital with his legs missing, and all you conspiracy serious douchebags are going around trying to say that he's a wounded soldier that washed his legs in Afghanistan. 
[02:20:00]  It's fucking bullshit, and you're a fucking shit.  All right, let me stop you, ma'am.  Ma'am, ma'am, this stuff is not all just black and white.  So, did you ever think that the White House regulations, our Cass Sunstein, wrote not one, but two papers at Harvard and Chicago business the year before he was made?  I don't give a shit what happened.  You don't give a shit about that.  Yeah, because you want to know why?  Because I know that...  Because you're into the emotion of it right now.  Ma'am, I'm telling you, blood-drinking Easter bodies are coming for you. 
[02:20:30]  Okay, no, no.  Seriously, ma'am.  I understand this about feeling good and feeling bad at it and validated.  You were in hope for the shit you're saying.  I know, I know, I'm bad.  I know, I'm bad.  I'm bad, you're right, you're right.  Yeah, you are.  You are.  I am.  You're good, though.  You're good, though.  Hey, ma'am, do you think I'm...  Yeah, I am.  I'm a human being, and I come back to the people.  Take all your back, Shane.  Take all your back, Shane.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, can I just say something to her, please?  Yes, yes.  Okay, good.  Thank you.  Listen, they're going to have schizophrenics, and I get this. 
[02:21:00]  The real question is, what's conspiracy, what isn't, what has red flags, what doesn't?  There are crazy people that think I am Bill Hicks, okay?  I mean, let's get something straight.  He's a very funny guy, a great guy, anti-gun.  I'm not Bill Hicks, okay?  There are people that think everything is actors and everything is fake.  I think Sandy Hook happened.  I think Aurora happened.  There were some people on the news that acted very coached.  So why don't you comment on the people that are saying that my friend Jeff Bowman, who's 
[02:21:30]  lying in the hospital with his legs fucking missing, is Nick, is an injured Afghanistan vet.  Why don't you comment on that?  Why don't you put that one?  Well, ma'am, number one, number one, number one.  Ma'am, why don't you put it to a rat?  Ma'am, your lordship?  Yeah.  Have you been to Infowars.com?  No, I don't need to go to Infowars.com.  I know the person personally.  Why don't you comment on what I'm talking about?  Maybe I'll think you're a good human being if you have a kind of decency to dispel the rumor. 
[02:22:00]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.  But what I'm telling you is, I'm saying the New York Times reported that the FBI has a  history of fighting mentally ill and unstable people, whether they be left-wing, right-wing,  or Muslim, or whatever the case is, and they call it winding them up, giving them everything,  being their commander, giving them money, saying the getaway car will be waiting for you  and we'll fly you out, you know, to the virgins with mustaches or whatever. 
[02:22:30]  So what I'm saying is, they have a motive to get power and control out of it, so I'm  saying we should give up our liberties, and we should look at all groups doing it, but  also criminal elements in government or foreign corporations, because they have a history  of doing this sometimes.  But she's asking you to address one subject, though.  She's asking you to address one question, though.  That's all.  She's asking you to address just that particular part.  Apparently, if I could get here, this girl has a friend that was injured and lost legs 
[02:23:00]  in the bombing, and I guess some conspiracy theorists are saying that that was a vet that  lost his legs in combat and is being used as a prop?  Is that what's going on?  Miss, you mean that famous picture of the guy missing both legs in the wheelchair?  Exactly.  That's your friend?  Yeah.  All right, I'm sorry.  I went to Chumsford High School with that person.  His name is Jeff Bowman. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Both my sister and I attended high school with him.  We know him.  And he's lying in a hospital bed, and all these people are reposting that picture, saying  what a piece of shit he is, and this and that, and seeing that he's a wounded veteran, and  he's not.  Yeah.  And just let me preface this.  My ex-husband is a veteran.  So I have much respect for veterans, and I have a lot of respect for the people that have  either lost their lives in service and also have been victims of terroristic activities.  And it really makes me mad and upset, especially having this hit so close to home that people 
[02:24:00]  are using my friend as a fucking prop.  And they are.  I've seen the picture.  Please, for God's sake.  Alex coming.  What I'm trying to get at, ma'am, is this is the internet.  There are seven and a half billion people.  Three or four billion of them are online.  People are going to say that the photo of your friend is real.  All of them follow you, and all you have to do is say that it's not true.  That's all you have to do. 
[02:24:30]  You have plenty of information.  No, you don't need to stop me because you're wrong.  Well, you're not listening.  You're saying that you're wrong.  I understand.  I understand.  Listen, I have a tendency on a woman's kind of whining at me and not listening to kind  of leave the room.  Look, ma'am, just let me, let me just calmly tell you something.  The internet is billions of people.  I cannot keep track of every cockamamie conspiracy theory going on on the internet and sit there  and debunk them.  I just told you.  All right, Alex, Alex, but do you believe what she's saying to be the truth? 
[02:25:00]  She sounds like she'd be very truthful.  Do you believe what she's saying to be the truth?  That that's her friend and she knows him?  Absolutely.  I'm not aware of what she's talking about, but I'm sure it's true because they lied to  us about WMDs.  They lied to us about so many other things.  Now, a large portion of people don't believe anything is real.  They take a crap in the toilet, they look in there and think it's a space alien.  I get that, and I'm sorry, and I'm sure your friend did get his legs blown off. 
[02:25:30]  And I personally am sick of people attributing to me all of the wild conspiracy theories that  are out there.  So, yes, ma'am.  Well, you can go on Instagram and look up the hashtag AlexJonesThePresident.  I don't have a damn Instagram channel, ladies.  Well, then, you know what?  You should figure it out because there's a lot of people that are voting you for president.  It's my fault because I have government documents.  No, but you have a personal responsibility as a public figure that has lots of followers. 
[02:26:00]  I disagree, sweetheart.  I don't agree with that.  I mean, he addressed it.  Alex addressed it.  I mean, he can't be held responsible for every lunatic that's online posting things that  aren't true.  It's not his job to police the Internet for lunatics.  I mean, obviously, I believe you 100% that your friend lost his legs in a bombing in front  of the marathon.  But, I mean, look, Alex Jones sounds a little kooky, but I'm not going to make him the police 
[02:26:30]  for all lunatics online.  And you asked him to address it.  I do recant that.  I'm sorry.  I do agree with that.  You're right.  He can't be responsible for everything.  But it is really heartbreaking, and it's really upsetting.  Well, yeah.  Well, more importantly, Lindsey, Lindsey, more importantly, how is your friend doing?  Is it life-threatening?  Is he going to be all right?  What's going on?  He is going to be okay.  He's expected to recover.  There's a lot of, there's going to be a candlelight vigil in Chelmsford tonight to commemorate, 
[02:27:00]  you know, all of the victims that were injured.  You know, I do have other friends.  Let me bring this up, ma'am.  I'm sorry for your friend.  And I want stuff like this to stop, but, you know, when the Gardasil test were going  on in 2006, a bunch of people died at the trials.  And I had medical doctors on and tried to warn people.  And I had the mothers on whose daughters took the shot and died.  And then they went ahead and approved it, and now they're having to do settlements.  It may have killed a bunch of people. 
[02:27:30]  But no one wants to have vigils.  No one cares.  No one cares about the U.N. polio program vaccine that just paralyzed 67,000 kids.  No one wants to have a vigil when a 1,000-pound bomb kills 200 innocent people, and they call  it collateral damage.  Do you get that people only get emotional when the mainstream media says, now it's time  to get emotional?  I agree with that.  You're not right about that.  I do agree with that point, Alex.  Yeah, fair enough.  That's a good point. 
[02:28:00]  You're absolutely right.  But you still, the thing here is, I would love to know in what way, shape, or form the  annoying yes, but how has the TSA, how is that an infringement upon our civil liberties,  which has, and I'm not saying you personally, Alex.  Norton, I think you enjoy it.  No, but I'm asking for real.  Because the problem I have with conspiracy guys is a lot of you guys are really smart,  and you raise some great points and some great arguments.  I'm agreeing with some of what you're saying right now, but there are certain very basic 
[02:28:30]  simple questions that instead of just saying, like, yeah, the TSA has become the popular  hate rally point, but they really aren't that, they're annoying as individuals, but as an  organization, it's not this big civil liberties violation, and I would like to know if you think  they are how they are.  All right, well, here's an example.  I was flying a few months ago, and my buddy was talking to me, because they were doing  a little, you know, making me wait before they came over to make sure Ben Lawton wasn't in  my underwear. 
[02:29:00]  Okay.  And I had my boot, like, maybe an inch over the line, because I'd been sitting there about  three minutes waiting.  I was like, oh, yeah, okay, I'll see you over there.  Okay, get coffee.  All right.  Get over the line!  Hey, I'm like, hey, buddy, how about you say please?  I didn't sign up, you know, for drill sergeant in the Marine Corps, and again, where I live  in Austin, Texas, they now have TSA on the frickin' highway.  Just type TSA in downtown Austin.  They now have, I went to the Kite Festival with my kids.  That's really racist.  And I went out there, and they had National Guard searching people. 
[02:29:30]  But again, real bombers are going to bomb you.  They had 400 National Guard, thousands of police, jet planes everywhere, and this happened.  Here's the newsflash.  But the TSA at the airports, I mean.  Get emotional.  Get into, oh, my God, we got hit.  Oh, my God, three people are dead.  Oh, my God.  I mean, all the empire, you know, is killing millions everywhere.  What do you mean, oh, my God?  What do you mean, oh, my God, three people are dead? 
[02:30:00]  That's three people.  I'm not even talking about you.  Listen.  You just, okay.  Listen, honey, I work all day hard, and then I come home to this crap.  Why don't you get in the kitchen and make me a damn steak?  Holy shit.  Jerry?  Shut up.  Don't take your Prozac.  Don't shut up.  You're a fucking piece of shit.  You're a fucking piece of shit.  I have more fucking authority in my finger than you have in your entire fucking body.  Why don't you call into this show to emotionally offload on me and blame me for what a retard 
[02:30:30]  you're doing on Instagram?  Listen, woman.  Listen.  I'm a baby.  I'm a fucking fan of my buster.  How about this?  I really mean.  Shut up, pinhead.  Shut up, pinhead.  You can't deny he's not entertaining.  I have had enough of you offloading your crap on me, woman.  Really?  Then take some fucking responsibility for the shit that comes out of your mouth.  No.  I'm not going to be a real Alex Jones.  You're an idiot. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I'm an idiot.  You're going to take everything you got.  Hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, Alex Jones, the president.  Hey, T-Brain, I bet you take a lot of vaccines, don't you?  9-11 being happened.  You're going to die of cancer.  Go roll your sleeve up, bitch.  Go take some shots for me, baby.  You know the government loves you.  They're going to take real good care of you because they care about the kids.  It's so obvious because they're all real sad about the kids.  Even though our own government has thousands of bad medical tests,  killing foster children, radiating little kids to death, 
[02:31:30]  and injecting black men with syphilis,  and injecting little kids overseas with live polio.  Oh, yeah, they did that.  They killed, but our government would never do it wrong.  That's right.  Take all your shots.  See, that's where he's right.  That's what confused me about Alex Jones.  They never did secret medical experiments.  Everything's fine.  Give your rights up.  You know it's a homegrown person.  You know it's a gun owner.  Why haven't they shut you up yet?  Don't worry.  Homeland Security will be able to have them.  Don't worry.  You can associate your personal power with a big... 
[02:32:00]  Why haven't they shut you up yet?  Don't worry.  I'm dying to know why they haven't shut you up yet.  Alex, that's a fair question she asked.  Alex, she asked you a fair question.  You're a guy who's very, very vocal, and you talk about a lot of these things, and if  they can orchestrate something like 9-11, or they can orchestrate any of the other things  that they may or may not have, why haven't they silenced you?  That's the oldest question, isn't it?  It's a fair question, but it is a fair question.  I've said it in the past.  It's a fair question. 
[02:32:30]  Maybe you still don't know.  Now listen, let's get serious about this.  Number one, I've grown slowly over the years, and people can also say, oh, you know, that's  bull.  They try to assassinate my character.  They try to assassinate my name.  They try to say that I've done things that aren't true.  If they physically kill me, it will highlight everything I've said.  It will underscore it, put 100 exclamation points behind it.  They'd rather do what the White House regulations said they would do, put out fake conspiracy theories 
[02:33:00]  so outlandish, it outrages pea brains.  Or they could just put you at the Boston Marathon and have a bomb blow up and kill you, just like  they tried to kill Marathon, right?  Sorry, ma'am.  I'm not really into marathons.  Exactly.  What I'm saying is, if the government wanted you gone, you'd be gone.  But they think you're so fucking crazy and such a lunatic that they don't give a shit  about you.  Ma'am, let me tell you something.  I'm going to be honest with you. 
[02:33:30]  When I go to a family reunion...  You're not being honest this entire time.  You like to dance around shit and fucking not answer questions.  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, I grew up in Dallas, Texas.  I grew up in Dallas, Texas.  Good for you.  Do you want a medal?  No, no.  Let me tell you a story.  I grew up in Dallas, Texas.  I'm going to deal with the mosquito.  Let me just say something.  I grew up in Dallas, Texas with my family doing things like helping take in East German  defectors, okay?  Whenever I go to a family reunion, half of people in the room are former retired CIA. 
[02:34:00]  And do you know what they tell me?  What?  They tell me I'm dead on 100% absolutely right about what I'm covering.  Retired, senile people are telling you this government conspiracy.  Wow, way to get good fucking information, bro.  That's cool.  No, no, no.  There's a lot of good people who've been in and out of the government who aren't 90s.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  And they're all related to anybody.  That the majority of drugs are brought in by the government.  Did you know that, Walnut, Bernie?  Majority of the drugs are brought in by the government. 
[02:34:30]  Alex, I got a question for you, for real.  I've been looking at my Twitter a little bit, and someone says you've got to explain the...  Have Alex Jones explain the Family Guy conspiracy about Boston.  And the guy writes, it's good.  Okay, I really want to do that, but I rolled out of bed.  Can I...  Can I...  Can I...  I'm going to be honest.  Can I take a crap?  Can I take a crap?  There you go.  Sure.  And I also want to...  That's what you've been doing.  And I also want to ask you about Bill Hicks, too, because I was a huge Bill Hicks fan, 
[02:35:00]  and it was a bit strange that he died so young with all the shit he was saying.  You got anything on that one?  Well, he also parked pretty damn hard, that's all I'm going to say.  I've been told stories about him and Sam Kimson.  Yeah.  That's the government messing with his phone.  All right, listen.  Yeah, they're messing with your phone just as you were about to talk about Bill Hicks.  I'd like to tell you the thing about the Family Guy.  You hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And I apologize that I'm on the cell phone.  My parents are right by my office. 
[02:35:30]  I live out in the country, like a 45-minute drive.  So I didn't get home until 5 a.m., slept two hours.  And that's why I'm not wrapped up.  Wah, wah, wah.  I'm actually wrapped up in a blanket on this.  Standing outside to my cell phone works.  Let me tell you the Family Guy conspiracy.  Okay, okay.  Here's the Family Guy conspiracy.  Go ahead.  Yes.  Okay.  My writer, Paul Watson, saw hundreds of blogs.  Your writer?  You have a writer? 
[02:36:00]  Your writer helped you with all your conspiracy.  I have a new idea.  Is this why you're talking about the babysitter?  Do you have any ideas?  Yes, I have.  Hold on.  What's the teleprompter, Bob?  Sorry, sorry.  I was just kidding when you explained your fucking fucked up Boston Marathon family guy conspiracy.  Oh, my God, man.  You just blew my whole cover.  How the hell did you do that?  I don't know.  How the hell did you just do that?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You just blew my whole cover.  Oh, my God.  Now they know.  No, you blew your own cover.  Oh, is that a cover going to scare me? 
[02:36:30]  Guys, write for me.  Oh, boy.  Hey, my God, the teleprompter is like I'm Obama.  All right.  I don't know what to say.  I'm not a real actor.  All right, listen.  Lindsay, you're killing.  We love you.  Yeah, let him just...  Let him just...  I want to hear the family guy conspiracy.  I want to go out with Lindsay.  Okay.  Hi, Jimmy.  I love you.  Thank you, Lindsay.  Oh, send a picture for Jim Norton.  What a nightmare girlfriend.  They're arguing with her.  Wow, right?  This is a fucking preview of what you'd have to deal with.  Yeah.  You'd lose every time, but it's okay. 
[02:37:00]  I'd still do things to you.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Good trade-off for Jim Norton.  Hey.  All right.  Go ahead, Alex.  I like the raging bull when I said get in there and cook me a steak, lady.  By the way, Tom Papa checking in.  He thinks we're talking to Ron White.  All right.  Go ahead, Alex.  I want to hear this.  Go ahead, Alex.  Okay.  Well, I have the news sites.  You know, one of the biggest ones out there in alternative media, ma'am, InfoWars.com,  another gratuitous, crass plug there for the InfoWars.  And, yes, I have about, I don't know, 15 writers or so, about eight of them on salary. 
[02:37:30]  But the point is, Paul Joseph Watson, my writer, saw all these blogs and blurbs with a 15-second clip of the family guy that aired on March 17th titled,  I think it was Turbined Cowboy, where the Tea Party starts working with al-Qaeda.  Gee, that never really happened in the real world, but that's part of every show demonizing it.  And I mean every frickin' show that's fiction. 
[02:38:00]  So he writes the article, and he went to the Fox website, saw the original episode.  It definitely was a real episode.  So he took the, well, he didn't take it, the people that had the video online, took the two clips of one where it shows him running over,  or driving away from piles of bloody people at the Boston Marathon.  And then they say, how did you do it?  And he holds up his cell phone and detonates it not once but twice with a bomb.  And so that's two bombs is how he won the Boston Marathon, and it shows blood all over the ground. 
[02:38:30]  And so we said, man, people are pointing this out, that it predicted it, that somebody basically copycat off of this show.  And then the maker of it came out and said, this is outrageous that we did this.  And the L.A. Times, everybody said that we made up a hoax about this, and they're erasing it off TiVo,  and in some areas now saying it never existed.  First it was that we edited it together, which we just showed the two scenes back to back. 
[02:39:00]  Now it's that it doesn't even exist, and it's a hoax.  And that we're hurting the families.  When I thought he made the episode about people being bombed in a comedy at the marathon.  So that is the incredible mind control level of all of this.  When all we do is report on some Internet meme, confirm it was a real episode, confirm it was a real show,  and then they're sitting there freaking out about it, it's just simply amazing. 
[02:39:30]  But I heard it was two episodes or so that were cobbled together to make it look that way?  No, it's from the same episode.  That was one episode where he's talking about the Boston Marathon and sets off two explosions.  Yeah, we played the short clip yesterday.  I mean, Bob Costas said to him, how did you win the Boston Marathon?  Uh-oh, it's the government.  The government's cutting out his cell phone.  No, no, no, ma'am.  You know what, you're right. 
[02:40:00]  The government loves you.  Like I said, ma'am.  I never said the government loves me, but I never thought about the government as much as you do.  Drinking fluoride is lowering our cues, and you're an example.  So drink deep.  Drink well.  Drink good.  Bye, little sweet.  Drink up.  Drink up, my friend.  Yeah, I just want to know, but there's one thing that she mentioned, and that was, like, again,  but I do want to know, because I'm a direct question guy, and this is why conspiracy theorists  don't like me.  And I'm asking, what is, like, again, you raise some good points about individuals in the TSA 
[02:40:30]  and the airports who are unpleasant guys, and I don't disagree with you.  But I'm talking about, as a whole, there are so many people that scream about the TSA  and fuck the TSA and illegal search and seizure.  So what I'm saying is, what is, if the TSA is wrong, what is the alternative to the TSA?  The government's not letting him answer, Jimmy. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, man.  Can you hear me now?  No, I can.  She's got you back.  No, I was running the house.  Hold on.  Listen, let me just tell you the alternative.  The alternative is to get back to the Fourth Amendment, because you see how, oh, we've  got to grope you and take you in a private room and put you in an X-ray machine and, you  know, backscatter machine and do all this, because terrorists hit the airports.  Now they hit the Boston Marathon.  Now we're going to have to improve some of the streets and grope you there.  And still, a bomber would just go and use the line.  That's right.  We're going to have to keep people from running.  Everybody needs to stop running. 
[02:41:30]  A bomber would just go, a bomber would just go, shut up.  Jesus Christ.  I can't not have a woman sitting there nagging me.  Jesus, I bet you don't have a boyfriend, do you?  I actually have a husband.  I'm married, actually.  I'm married and happily married.  Oh, my God.  I still love you to me, though, seriously.  You did say you were divorced, though.  No, that was me, a cousin.  I'm married again.  But I still love you.  Yeah.  A new person to torture.  Okay.  That's right.  That's right, motherfucker.  He wasn't in enough to handle me, so I left that. 
[02:42:00]  That's right.  That's right.  You're bragging how you dominate and ruin men.  More vaccines.  You've driven Northeens to transactional.  Holy shit.  Should we let Lindsay go?  Yeah.  Lindsay, you're terrific.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks so much.  And all the best to your friend, okay?  Yeah.  Wish your friend luck.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Lindsay from Massachusetts.  Hey, we should have got her information off the...  I'll make sure she went to school with you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well, we got her on hold.  Thanks, Lindsay. 
[02:42:30]  Sorry about that.  That was...  You know how radio goes.  That was way too entertaining to blow off.  No, I certainly...  I mean, I didn't enjoy talking to her.  I'm awake now, though.  Yeah.  You're all these guys, like, laying in the bed.  I don't wake you up.  Now, again, you're talking about things outside the airport, and I don't disagree that, hey,  they may want to use this to make that.  I'm only talking about...  And I'm asking you specifically for a reason.  I'm not trying to break your balls.  I'm asking for real.  The airport has been the point of contention for a lot of anti-government or conspiracy guys.  It has been a rallying point. 
[02:43:00]  Is this fucking airport security?  And I think it's a phony rebellion and a phony form of being a maverick.  So I'm asking, how does that violate us?  Would you prefer that there was no security in the airports?  No, you're right.  You've caught us.  It's all a phony rebellion.  No, no.  When I say phony, I mean not phony as in you're liars.  I mean phony as in when I mumble a curse under my breath that I know my mom won't hear.  I don't mean phony like it's a conspiracy.  I mean, it's just...  It's a silly rebellion. 
[02:43:30]  It doesn't do anything.  So would you prefer...  What's the alternative to the TSA for airports?  Well, they're taking a lot of the body scanners out.  They're backing off when they're groping.  The TSA is prisoner compliance training to train you that you're a perpetrator and you have no rights  and you're guilty until the government has enslaved you.  That's an answer.  But it's not.  It's a prelude to...  It's training people to walk through things, to step on this line, to not cross that line. 
[02:44:00]  And then the next step will be...  Yeah, it's the same training you get when you show up in prison.  But airport security...  Hold on.  Airport security...  So, okay.  So if that's the answer, what is the alternative?  What option would you have to protect people on planes or do you rather not want security?  And as Jesse Ventura said, I'd rather face the danger.  Okay.  That's the answer.  You would prefer to have no security on planes and Jesse Ventura...  Okay.  Fair enough.  I'd love to put good-looking stewardesses back in. 
[02:44:30]  I accept that.  I'd love to be really awesome again.  Well, look at all the security measures they put in place after 9-11.  Like, we can't even go in and out of buildings anymore without, you know, showing ID and having badges  and going through this thing and that thing.  And attacks have been minimal.  It kind of helped.  But this is a...  Our government...  You know what?  Listen.  It's now all over the news that our government's putting al-Qaeda, real al-Qaeda, in Libya and  Syria, just murdering and taking over.  People go, yeah, we have them kill each other. 
[02:45:00]  No bull.  Our government has given them 10,000 heat-seeking missiles out of Libya so they can now tell the  it's so dumb.  Oh, you've got to give your rights up.  Al-Qaeda's got missiles now.  But to know America's still in control in the world.  Exactly.  I mean, listen.  Type in military growing opium in Afghanistan.  About five years ago, it was coming out.  The troops were mad about growing opium.  Opium production went from 9% worldwide to 93% out of Afghanistan.  And so what did the Pentagon do? 
[02:45:30]  They had Fox, CNN, BBC, ABC, go all these up.  All come on the same way.  You go, yes.  The troops don't grow the opium.  We load it on C-130.  If we catch you using it in America, we're going to put your ass in jail.  So they just hit it in plain view.  They go, okay, kids.  Yes.  You're so dumb, you can't even get the contradiction in America, they said.  We're going to admit we grow the opium over here so Al-Qaeda doesn't get it.  We have to control the drug trade, or it's complicated, because if we don't grow it and ship it in, Al-Qaeda will get it. 
[02:46:00]  How about you decriminalize the crap?  Oh, you don't want that, government, because that's how you brought down China and broke it up colonially, was they were done enough to make opium illegal.  And so you were able, in 50 years, to take over, through corruption, take over the police, and then bring down China.  The drug war is meant to bring down Europe, bring down America, make everybody a suspect.  Now they're moving on to everybody's a terrorist.  Now they're saying, the people that talk about liberty and want guns, and think we shouldn't be able to take money out of your bank account for no reason, they're going to blow through. 
[02:46:30]  I agree with them on that one.  Boy, the villainization of Americans that want to adhere to the Constitution, want to bear arms, their right to bear arms, and keep their civil liberties, are now the bad guys in this country that are portrayed in everything from commercials to movies to the mainstream media news as the bad guys. 
[02:47:00]  I agree with you on that.  And the Pillsbury Doughboy is now being groped and, like, enjoying it with a little pervert noise.  But do you believe that we caused the event so we can push our agenda through?  I believe shit happens and then the government goes, oh, this is great, we can now push some of our agenda through.  I believe they...  Well, regardless of what we...  Are we actually...  Is the government actually causing the event that allows them to push the agenda through?  That's the question. 
[02:47:30]  Well, they've been caught, like, doing Gulf of Tonkin to get into Vietnam and so many other issues.  So, I mean, look, listen, here's all I'm begging people to understand.  They don't need to build things and compete anymore.  Special interests can stage stuff, provoke it through a few events, grandstand and script it, and then get us to collectively have a guilt like we're all terrorists.  And this country's being converted into a giant prison from the beautiful, wonderful nation it is.  We're getting away from the Bill of Rights and Constitution.  And, again, they've got Geico commercials with the Pillsbury Doughboy, begs to be groped by the TSA, and some subconscious pedophile thing. 
[02:48:00]  You know, I mean, this is all out of control, folks.  This isn't what freedom looks like.  All right, Alex, because we've got to wrap up.  Walk us through what's going to happen now with the Boston Marathon bombing.  Are we going to catch a suspect, and what does that mean?  Regardless if it was lone wolf, which does happen sometimes, it's very rare. 
[02:48:30]  Or it could be like the Olympic Park bombing.  They'll try to frame two or three Patsies like Richard Jewell before they find the next Patsy, you know, Eric Rudolph.  I mean, who knows what's true.  The government ran the anthrax attack that later came out.  They killed the third Patsy.  I don't remember that.  So all this is going on.  They're already now saying it's the culture of the right-winger.  And they're all over the news going, you know who's worse than Al-Qaeda?  Yeah, Janet was right. 
[02:49:00]  Napolitano said it'd be the libertarians, those bastards.  They hit us again.  And so they're building up the whole thing scripting.  You can just see the scripting.  They're building it up and drawing it out like an Agatha Christie of like, oh, everybody's a suspect,  especially the white males, but never the government that historically...  Okay, all right, Alex, we understand that because you've made that point so many times.  But how is this going to now play out?  What is going to be presented to us in the next coming days?  That's all I want to know.  I'm sure I apologize.  I'm digging here. 
[02:49:30]  No worries.  Let me tell you, it's going to play out.  Let me tell you, it's going to play out.  All right.  They're going to announce that, well, we're going to have to have TSA certified.  This has already begun.  Your locals, they wave a magic wand where they can now violate your Fourth Amendment and grope you.  They're going to have the military.  They've already announced that event.  It's not just Kentucky Derby and big events like that.  They've already done that at the beta test of the Super Bowl.  So the military is going to be absolutely everywhere.  More searches. 
[02:50:00]  And you're going to learn to just have your bags searched.  It won't matter if you pull into a parking lot and you're going into an electronic store  and there's two army guys there or there's two goons there.  And you're like, anybody could drive in this parking lot.  I could walk up and do something.  And if you say that, they're going to throw you down, put you in handcuffs.  Okay.  I understand what he's saying, too.  If they just out of nowhere, let's say it's 19-fucking-55, leave-it-to-beaver kind of atmosphere  in the country, and a police or a military personnel walked up to you and said, I'm going to check 
[02:50:30]  your bag.  People would go like, get the fuck out of here.  I have the right to...  But we're being lulled into this sense that we are all potential perpetrators so that we're  giving up.  We're giving up our rights under this guise that it is for our own good and our own safety.  And the only way to do that is to slowly and progressively train us through using tragedy  to victimize and make us guilty so that we will open our bags voluntarily. 
[02:51:00]  We'll give up our videotapes.  We'll give up pictures and our cameras and everything.  I disagree, though.  I think in 1955, people are much more cynical now.  I think in 1955, it might have been odd to hear, but if a cop goes, hey, I need to check  you, I think a guy would go, well, go right ahead.  I haven't done anything wrong.  I think back then...  I think, hold on.  I think back then...  Back then, there was an omnipotent view of the government.  I think now, after Kennedy's assassination, people are much more cynical now than they've  ever been. 
[02:51:30]  And less trusting.  What administration did this start in, and is every administration involved in this?  Well, Kennedy said no to a plan of Operation Northwood to shut out...  And this is declassified.  This is ABC.  You can read the thing at the National Security Archive online.  That's it, Operation Northwood.  They called for a plan.  The Joint Chiefs green-lighted this.  This isn't just like a plan.  This was a green-lighted operation.  He said no to L.L.  And that was the Joint Chiefs and Staff Chairman.  They were going to bomb D.C., bomb Miami with plastic explosives at public places. 
[02:52:00]  We've seen that before.  They even described how to frame the patches, but first build up for a week or so, you know,  all the tension of who did it, and how to commit mass shootings to then blame Cuba  and the Soviets to have World War III.  And that's when Kennedy, this is all on record, sent an internal cable to Khrushchev and said,  you listen to me and you listen good, and this is on record.  He said, they're going to kill...  There's going to be a coup, and they're going to nuke your ass, and General LeMay of the 
[02:52:30]  Air Force has got the frickin' nukes loaded right now.  We got 10-to-1 superiority on you.  You better back down right now.  These people are not fuckin' playing games, okay?  That's all what happened on record.  Operation Northwood, and Kennedy said no.  So then he tried to abolish the Federal Reserve.  He signed the executive order to do it.  He signed the executive order to pull the troops out of Vietnam.  They were already there as advisors, over 50,000 of them, and they blew his head off  in front of everybody and said, oh, a lone nut did it. 
[02:53:00]  You know, a lone guy.  It's the same story over and over again.  But you're absolutely right with whether it's staged or not.  This is the acclimation for prison training.  And yes, in the 50s, people would have said yes for a little bit or in a specific area.  But if they tried this all at once, they would have said no.  Right.  The police do what authoritarianism.  I've seen the training films for our military in the 50s, and it was like, in authoritarian  countries, everyone's a suspect.  You can watch these films online. 
[02:53:30]  In authoritarian countries, people spy on you.  In authoritarian countries, when you go to a public place, your bags are searched.  Not in America.  I mean, a cop, if they said, go search people randomly at the park, would say, well, who's  the suspect?  What's the reason?  What's the probable cause?  Yeah, that was my point, too.  Right.  They wouldn't say, oh, yeah, let's just randomly walk into a shopping mall and just walk up  to some old lady indiscriminately and stick our hands down our pants to see a bin Laden  hiding.  I mean, just come on.  Just wouldn't be done.  Yeah, yeah.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  I agree with you, Alex, on that take.  A few of the other things you lose me on, but I definitely agree there's some shenanigans  going on.  Great talking to you.  I'm going to keep watching Infowars.com.  Yeah, I was going to say get the plugs out.  I don't know what he wants to plug today.  Alex, my boneyard show.  I apologize.  I apologize for being on cell phone.  Like I said, I only got two hours of sleep.  I'd love to come back.  Alex, you're all right.  Believe me, you're fucking hilarious.  You're a very enjoyable person.  Love it.  What's the Twitter? 
[02:54:30]  Real Alex Jones?  Yeah, I was late to the Twitter game, so it's pretty pathetic.  Only like 180,000 followers.  But I put out some pretty good stuff at Real Alex Jones and Infowars.com, and we have  the nightly news, PrisonBlendant.tv.  Okay.  And it's all right there, folks.  And look, I'm for real.  All I want is the truth.  Our liberties in closing are the most valuable thing we've got.  Money can be taken.  Our lives can be taken.  Property can be taken.  Our kids can be taken.  If you don't have due process, criminal elements, even if good elements are in government now, 
[02:55:00]  which they're not, bad ones will fill that vacuum as soon as they're going to check it  out.  It's like a dam.  Yeah, I agree.  And when the dam's gone, the flood will happen.  So, gentlemen, all you guys, God bless you.  Thanks for having me on.  All right, Alex.  Take care, Alex Jones.  Um, wow.  A lot to digest, Greg.  God damn.  The one thing I want to say about Alex Jones, he's like a piece of steak with a lot of fat.  Like, you know there's good shit in there? 
[02:55:30]  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there's so much fat around it that is frustrating to me.  He's, he's, he's, he's a character.  It's, it's, it's, it's hilarious.  But he wouldn't say he's a character.  No, no, no.  He's, maybe, maybe.  He needs his credibility with his people.  I understand what he's doing.  Right.  Um, and, and there are certain aspects I agree with.  Uh, I don't think, I don't think there's as much sinister stuff going on right now as  overtly as he's putting it out to be. 
[02:56:00]  I do think there's sinister stuff going on and I, I do think the government does enjoy  a population that gets in step like cows, uh, going to the slaughterhouse and, and this  is this setup, this, this way that the American people are being told that for their safety  they have to do this and this and this.  If we're willing to just rip our shoes off at the airport and that is a very dangerous  area, you make a good point.  You obviously don't want to get on a plane if no one's been checked. 
[02:56:30]  But that's the perfect place to not test, but, but kind of acclimate people to the fact  that an authority figure for your safety can tell you, Hey, take your fucking shoes off  motherfucker.  Why?  Because I told you to.  Now it makes sense at the airport and I understand that.  And, and that's the way we want it.  But then maybe down the line, a place that doesn't quite make sense, you have an authority  figure and you're so acclimated to obeying at this point in our lives that we will fucking 
[02:57:00]  go for anything.  I, I, I do understand that, but I also think that as time has gone on and people have become  so much less trusting of the, because I'm not a, I don't, I'm not an idiot.  I don't, I tremendously, no, I mean, I tremendously value my privacy.  I tremendously value my civil liberties.  I just, I look at these things and if I was getting pulled over and stopped and asked  questions, it would annoy me a lot. 
[02:57:30]  It would annoy me a lot.  But you know, whenever we hear people talk about like, well, I was stopped because of  my race.  Sometimes they're bullshitting and sometimes they're telling the truth and we look at  them and go, ah, shut the fuck up.  Like we, we already have that and we don't mind it.  Like when you hear a couple of black guys pulled over and they go, oh, we were just stopped  because of our race driving to a white neighborhood, which does happen.  Yeah.  And they're outraged and they're justifiable to be outraged.  We look at that and we go, ah, what's the fucking price you pay for other blacks?  Fuck it up.  Right.  Well, maybe this is the price we, you know what I mean? 
[02:58:00]  It's, I'm not saying it's right or even what my point is.  I don't know.  I just think we already have that a lot more than we think.  And I don't think that we are as compliant as conspiracy theorists think that we are.  Really?  No.  I see a very compliant population.  In the airport though, it makes sense.  Yes.  And I'm comfortable with it there because I want other passengers checked.  Where are we not compliant?  I see us compliant whenever we're told by an authority figure and, and a government entity  to do something.  We fucking do it as a population. 
[02:58:30]  Where is searching, hold on.  Where is searching and stuff?  Look what's, look what happened in, uh, these stop and frisks and certain subways and stuff,  which I actually at times agreed with.  Uh-huh.  Uh, it was stopped because people were outraged about it.  When people are loud enough and people scream, believe me, with Twitter and everybody telling  you, you have everybody telling you something at once, then back the fuck off.  But now you're hearing stories of private citizens in their own homes being, um, singled out because 
[02:59:00]  of, uh, their, their writings, what they've written online, freedom of speech issues come  into play, and then you get an authority figure or entity that comes over to the house to question  people, that, that is an intrusion.  Right there is an intrusion.  Yet, the public doesn't look at that and say, motherfucker, why the hell is the government  getting in this guy's business?  They look and say shit like, well, he must be up to something.  We've all been trained to look at everyone as a suspect.  Because, I apologize, Rich, I know you're going to say it, but I, but one of the reasons 
[02:59:30]  for that, and I'm not saying it's right.  Yeah.  But again, where, what's the, what, how do we handle it?  What has happened is, people who are committing certain crimes and doing certain things are  a lot of times writing what they're going to do.  And they're, it's almost like if you threaten the president, the secret service will always  talk to you, it's a rule.  So when people are printing manifestos and they're doing all this stuff, and, and then  all of a sudden somebody writes something, when they do nothing, that person go out and  commits a murder, then people are like, why the fuck didn't you do anything?  It's almost like they're damned if they do, they're damned if they don't. 
[03:00:00]  And I know that you're saying that there's...  You can't give up your liberties for this veil of safety.  I agree.  Yeah.  But then, when we do get hit, we better not fucking cry about it.  No, you're right.  We better not fucking blame the government and go, why aren't they protecting me?  It's, it's, and again, I know that they probably do things, a lot of things they shouldn't  do.  And they are invasive cunts.  But every time that they go to check somebody out, I don't think it's this giant civil liberties 
[03:00:30]  violation.  Because when things happen, we go, why the fuck didn't you protect us?  The first thing we do is look to them.  The thing we want the government to protect us from random events is re-fucking-diculous.  Yeah.  It can't be done.  There are certain things in place.  We have a military, we have police force, we have things that are in place to protect  us to a point.  But as a free society, things are going to happen.  When you start limiting those freedoms to try to keep bad things from happening, it's 
[03:01:00]  the opposite of what the fuck this country is supposed to be.  Yeah, but you're saying with all these inconveniences, the checkpoints, this and that, this would  never happen back in the day.  On the opposite spectrum, look at all the positive things that the public can do with the internet,  with Twitter, with flying helicopters that you have that can spy on people.  Yeah, well, that's going away.  Well, on the opposite end, we're doing...  Rich, on the outside, things are always presented to us under this guise of convenience and safety 
[03:01:30]  and things like that.  It's never...  We're never told by the government that we are going to do this to infringe on your  rights.  We're always told that we are doing this for your safety.  We're doing this for your convenience.  Look how easy it is now.  You could do this online.  Go to our government website and fill this out.  Now, meanwhile, you don't know where the fuck those records go, and then later you find  out that they are being used by the IRS or by some other government agency to fuck  you in the ass.  And just the opposite.  You have ways to fuck them in the ass. 
[03:02:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Love to see those.  This point is not a stupid point.  The way information is given out and the way we can communicate...  Remember how years ago Scientology could fuck with you because they could just wreck your  life?  Uh-huh.  And now you can go on...  The playing field is a lot more equal than people think it is.  It's more equal than it's ever been.  I think we have a perception of that, but as far as the government is concerned, we have  no recourse for anything they do to us.  But look at how many of them are vulnerable, too.  It's almost like this blind...  Again, Petraeus was the example. 
[03:02:30]  You cannot get more fucking top secret than that guy.  You cannot get more in the loop than that motherfucker.  And he got brought down by fucking somebody on the side.  Well, I'm sure a conspiracy theorist would say that they fucking wanted him out.  But who has more juice than that guy?  You know what I'm saying?  Like, oh, bro, look at the people of power who are injured by the fact now that these  little nobodies, these average little people that we are, have a big voice.  How many of these fucking people are brought down by little regular blabbermouths now? 
[03:03:00]  Well, that is true.  That never happened before.  So Rich is right in that, where the public has a lot more power than we know they do.  But we also rat each other out.  Again, again, under the guise of convenience, we've become our own big brother as far as  ratting each other out, posting pictures.  No, it was never like that, Rich.  Not even close.  If you went to a neighbor and ratted him out to a government entity or his employer and  stuff, it reeked of Nazi Germany.  This is an era of information, convenience, photographs, video that we use against each 
[03:03:30]  other.  Not even, vindictively a lot of times.  A lot of times it's, wow, that's funny.  Look at what this guy did.  Let me put it online.  And his boss goes, fuck, what an asshole.  I don't want him working for me.  And now he's fired.  It's this weird thing where this convenient thing we have to communicate with each other,  to get information, is also turned on us to fuck us over if we need to be fucked over.  But we did it. 
[03:04:00]  I know.  Exactly.  We post the videos.  We are the government.  We the people.  We do it.  Dude, I understand that part of it.  But there's a power base, too, that can manipulate things.  And I don't think people are as clever and as forward-thinking to see that this would  have come about.  But the fact that it did come about, it's being used.  Just like these tragedies.  I don't think the government is blowing people up on a fucking marathon route.  But they will use the tragedy to their own ends.  To push agendas forward. 
[03:04:30]  To push agendas.  Exactly.  With that robot thing, if that's a real thing.  That's a lot of money for a company.  And now you can push that agenda through, like, look, obviously, you know, every city  needs these robot people or whatever the fuck Alex Jones is talking about.  Hey, two other things really fast.  I can't believe I have to read this tweet, but I understand Twitter's full of assholes  and idiots.  But this guy writes, Opie, no way you should have let Alex Jones shit on that woman like  that.  What?  She fucking handled herself beautifully. 
[03:05:00]  She fucking destroyed it.  So what are you talking about?  She was great.  And then it looks awkward if we jump in to protect a woman.  She was great.  She protected herself.  When he was saying, like, yeah, I didn't get much sleep and I was doing that, she just  goes, wah, wah, wah.  I don't even know.  I'm amazed by what people hear out there sometimes.  She more than took care of herself.  Why jump in the way of her?  She was fucking swinging.  She more than took care of herself.  I love the part where she said she was happily married, but she would do anything to this  fucking... 
[03:05:30]  Ah, yeah.  She loves Jimmy.  I made Jimmy happy.  She loves Jimmy.  Imagine that, though.  Imagine that, Jimmy.  Just fucking yelling at you.  I don't...  Where the fuck...  Why the fuck...  That would make Jimmy very turgid.  Stop it.  And the other thing, before we move on, I asked Sam to make a list.  Were you able to make a list?  He was talking pretty fast there.  Oh, yeah.  You want to go through the...  We enjoy a good list on this program, Rich Voss.  I made a list of lessons from Alex Jones.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, just things that I learned that I didn't know.  Did you get the, what's he going to call it, industrial complex in there? 
[03:06:00]  No, I didn't get that one.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  Fucking cocksucker.  This is what I do.  Do your job.  This is what Sam took away from the Alex Jones hour.  It was about an hour with Alex Jones.  He took notes.  There's a 10% chance that the bombing is not staged.  10%?  10% chance that the bombing at the Boston Marathon.  Right.  This is a false...  Not staged by what?  The government?  Right.  He said it's a 90% chance that the government staged this.  Gotcha.  Yep.  This is a false flag self-inflicted wound by the grandstanding police state. 
[03:06:30]  All right.  Self-inflicted wound.  Obama killed 200 plus people at a wedding.  Alex watches the new Hawaii Five-0.  Well, we did learn that.  We did learn that.  The TSA let shooter Jennings walk through security with weed.  And they gave him his Chiba back.  Cities are buying $15 million worth of robots.  The Unabomber was in a CIA mind control program. 
[03:07:00]  Mind control.  He was.  An Air Force psychiatrist knew what James Holmes from Aurora was doing, and now they're drugging  him to tell the truth.  All right.  Yeah.  The government is planning to implode the economy.  Training manuals are coming out warning of veterans attacking.  Kim Jong-un hangs out with transsexuals.  We did learn that.  People died in Gardasil tests.  They passed it anyway, and it's still killing people. 
[03:07:30]  Fuck, yeah.  The polio vaccine has paralyzed many kids.  The government is putting out fake conspiracy theories to make Alex's theories seem less credible.  Alex has ex-CIA members at his family reunion saying that he's right on the money.  And the family guy clip, even though Seth MacFarlane said it was not real, was real.  Was real.  Fuck, yeah.  That's a little suspicious, though.  What?  Seth's lying.  Where did he get that episode from before it aired? 
[03:08:00]  What was that?  It didn't air.  Yeah, it's a bunch of bullshit.  It's not real.  Fuck, yeah.  You think it is real, Chip?  Fuck, yeah.  And the economy will take another shit sooner than later, too.  Yeah, the government's...  I completely believe that.  Why?  I don't know.  I've been saying that.  I don't know if it's the government's purposely doing it.  I don't know.  But it absolutely will take a shit again.  It's the ebb and flow of the market.  It's been riding high for too long.  It's setting records.  The only thing that's been keeping it this high this long is that the economy is so shitty, 
[03:08:30]  there's nowhere else to put your money.  Remember in the early 2000s when we were over at NEW, and we were really keeping tabs on the stock market?  We'd be like, oh, fuck, they're fucking raising interest rates.  It's going to bring the fucking market down, you know, because people can then take their money and put them in interest-bearing accounts and whatnot.  And they used to like, all right, oh, what are they going, a quarter?  Are they going a quarter or a half today?  You haven't talked about interest rates in years because there aren't any. 
[03:09:00]  It's down to nothing.  And there's no real safe, profitable place to put money anymore except the fucking market.  And that's not even safe.  That's scary.  At least you have a chance to make some money.  Yeah, but we're all going that direction, which is scary.  But, well, this is my fucking thing I have with people that go, oh, if everything's so bad,  how come the Wall Street is setting records in the stock market?  Exactly, because the economy sucks, you dumb motherfucker.  There's nowhere else to put your goddamn money.  Invest in lemon hats. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, right.  There's these clear hats that you can put lemons in.  Yeah.  And it just makes everybody's day sunny.  Take us out.  The lady at my fucking bank is like, why don't you put your money in this and it'll get you  to maybe two.  I go, the money I have.  Two percent.  Or three percent.  No.  I don't even think you get anywhere near two or three percent.  I go, it's not worth taking a risk of losing what little I have.  I'll stick with your point forty-five percent interest. 
[03:10:00]  Isn't that amazing?  How do they get away with that?  I look at my bank statement, I'm like, why do I even have money in this bank?  I know.  For what reason?  I bought a car the other day, point nine percent interest.  Yeah.  Like, there's no interest.  It's free money you're getting because, you know, they can't charge you interest.  Amortgage rates low, too?  Yeah.  You can get them.  You can almost get them to two and three quarters.  It's crazy.  Two and three quarters.  Almost, yeah.  But, yeah, the market is doing well because nothing else is. 
[03:10:30]  Right.  There's nowhere else to put you in.  And that's why it's scary as shit.  And that's scary because that's the last bastion of fucking, like, making money with your money.  The market crash is big.  Where are you putting your fucking money?  I don't know.  It's going away.  You build a vein and put it in gold?  Gold took a giant shit the other day.  So let's get in on the gold thing.  Well, I think it went back up, but even gold is showing weakness right now.  I got a bunch of gold.  Your best bet is the casino.  Hi, I'm Bill Devane.  My father told me to invest in gold, and I did.  And I've done pretty well for myself. 
[03:11:00]  Look, I got a plane and horses and a lot of property.  Go fuck yourself.  I got a bag of gold.  Do you?  I got a bag of urine.  I'm going to buy myself.  I'm going to buy myself.  You want to take a piss and come back and...  Oh, yeah.  Take a piss, you piece of garbage.  I got a good investment.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The guys are back for the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:11:30]  Well, today flew by Rich Vossen's studio playing Helium Comedy Club down there in Philly.  Ball filler.  I got to go see Steven Singer.  Oh, yeah.  Pick up some things.  You know.  What happened?  I just had a...  Oh, fuck that.  My cup of coffee fell over, and I was... 
[03:12:00]  My dexterity, I got out of the way, but it was fucking empty.  Yeah.  This is how this show has grown.  Like, you used to come...  I mean, like when Bobby and we're all in here, it's just a big fight, and it's fun.  We're sick of you guys, too.  But go ahead.  Yes.  But this is how it's going.  Now, like, I used to come in here, I go, I'm going to try to be funny.  Usually, I wasn't.  But now I come in going, I just want to make a good couple points.  You've got to make your points.  I've got to make some points.  I just want to make my points.  Why?  What do you got there, Rich?  No, nothing.  I'm saying, like, now it's like, it's just how things evolve. 
[03:12:30]  So much going on in the world.  You want to point check under your hat?  Here's your hat for something besides a hat rack.  Regular Joe.  You see what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's a strange new world we live in there, Rich.  You're telling me.  So much going on.  So much influx of information is just...  What was he trying to say?  It's crazy.  That in the old days, it was just about getting a good fucking dick or pussy joke out there.  Now you've got to, you know...  Get a good point out there.  Trying to know what the fuck is going on in the world.  And, you know, yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Want to hear one of my new bits?  Please.  I would love to.  You said you had a good line.  No, Desert Storm.  What was your line?  You said you had a good line.  During the commercial, you said, don't worry, I got a good line.  Was that your line?  It was the point you were going to make?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, all right.  I mean, and another thing, too, in my new car, how would I get serious, you guys, in my car?  How do you do that?  Oh, shit.  You should have listened to Louis C.K. last week.  Why?  You have to buy another car.  But this is, you know, this is the same shit we hear over and over again. 
[03:13:30]  You want to listen to us, right?  Yeah, I just want to.  Did you used to have an XM unit?  I had it at home, you know, the XM thing.  All right, but the problem is now that you got serious in your car, now it's a whole thing.  I don't even know if I have it in my car.  I should have it.  It's a nice BMW.  It hasn't navigated.  What year is it?  2010.  All right.  How much?  Are you getting there?  What do you mean?  I'm getting there.  We just all want to see you just buy a brand new fucking car. 
[03:14:00]  Nobody buys a brand new car.  It's the worst thing they do on the planet.  Nobody, huh?  Except maybe Anthony and you.  I lease.  You lease?  That's even dumber.  Well, you don't drive at all.  I lease 100% right off.  I drive.  I drive a car for three years, then I give it to somebody, and then I get another one.  If I was going to buy a car, I would buy one every three years, right?  So I would have to sell it and buy another one anyway.  So leasing is the same thing.  I'm making payments just like I would if I bought it.  But why would I want to go through the bullshit of trading it in or fucking selling it and 
[03:14:30]  then buying a new car?  So I just lease it.  Last year, I had my other car for one year.  I got one.  I drove 25,000 miles.  25,000 miles.  25,000 miles.  That's a lot of peckers.  You drove 25 fags around.  Okay.  Fags.  I go in.  I say, this is what I want for this car.  They gave me 15 grand.  I go, I'll take that car.  Do you want to test drive it?  No.  Why should I test drive it?  It's a BMW.  I know it's going to drive well.  Okay.  That's how I am.  Do the pay work.  Boom.  What if it was a lemon?  What if it was like... 
[03:15:00]  It's not a lemon.  It's putting a T.  What if the car was in an accident and you don't know that because they just rebuilt the  fucking body all night.  It was inside the engine.  They didn't put back together.  Quite right.  First of all, there's a car.  In fact, second of all, they do that, you know, they're certified.  I don't...  I'm not buying it from Frank's car lot.  I'm buying it...  Certified pre-owned.  Pre-owned.  Okay.  You know, it's a whole nother level nowadays.  Yes.  Just like, you know what I'm saying?  So...  Yes, I do.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm getting pre-owned.  Yeah.  And you know, I say, hey, that's the one I want.  No, I don't.  Test drive.  It's not a Chevy Cavalier. 
[03:15:30]  I don't need to test drive it.  Sure.  You know.  And it's good?  I should have test drive.  You're quick, Rich.  You're quick.  Oh, shit.  Yo.  Yo.  Let's go home.  Yeah, let's wrap up this midday.  Oh, Jimmy's show is coming up.  Jimmy's advice show.  I like getting to the truck and starting my drive home and listening to Jimmy right off  the bat because he usually starts with...  Are you starting with an email today?  No, I hadn't been.  I've just been chatting.  Oh, I liked when you started with an email and you gave some guy like some advice. 
[03:16:00]  Sets up the whole hour.  Nice.  Yeah, gets the callers going and then...  Yeah, no, I haven't been doing that, but I can start again next time.  All right.  I do like that.  A lot of people ask how to initiate sex with a hooker or a massage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've heard that.  How do I get my wife to want to do a threesome?  That I've heard a lot, too.  How do I get my wife to put...  I heard that guy.  How do I get my wife to put a strap-on on and fuck me in the ass? 
[03:16:30]  Is that guy real?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Oh, yeah.  They're all...  Like when...  Wow.  Yeah.  How do you have that conversation at dinner?  Steve Blatter.  Yeah.  Oh, weird.  What was your answer to that one?  Not that I want to know, by the way.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't even imagine the conversation.  You're asking for a friend.  Right.  Like, where do you even begin that conversation?  Something like...  Even begin that conversation.  You've got to tell her what you want to.  You've got to get the strap-on and tell her.  Like, you want her to fucking...  And then Jimmy asks things like, you know, well, have you, you know, still with any, 
[03:17:00]  you know, ass play?  Fingers in the ass or any fingers in the ass or anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're billed to the strap-on.  You don't just jump to the strap-on.  Nah, you don't go right to the destroyer.  I saw this guy in China had an eel, went up his ass and caught in his stomach.  Oh, Jesus.  And he had to go to the hospital.  And I said, I go, he had to break his arm first and go to the hospital and go, look,  why I'm here, can you do me a favor and just check to see...  Check to see if I've got an eel in my ass.  Do I have an eel in my...  That's one of my new bits. 
[03:17:30]  I threw it in.  That's good.  That's not bad, Rich.  Listen.  Helium is a lucky place.  I'm here.  This weekend, right?  Oh, my wife hates me.  This week's podcast, uh, uh...  Let me guess.  You guys are fighting?  Frifty.  No, it's a good...  It's a funny fucking...  This week, Frifty.  You guys are always funny.  Thank you.  Uh, but sometimes we step it up.  Sometimes it's like, but this one, this week was great.  Is it tough to do an hour of radio a week?  It's probably not even nearly as tough as doing 20 hours of radio.  It's...  It's an hour. 
[03:18:00]  It's, you know...  Well, no, because you have commercials.  Uh...  Yeah, it's tough because you're doing it with the person that you hate.  You know, my wife.  Uh, we fight.  We laid in bed last night.  Uh, whatever.  It's just fucking marriage.  But she's cool.  Fuck that shit.  She's cool.  You hate her.  She's cool.  She's funny.  You're funny.  Marriage shit.  You're at Helium.  How'd you like the, uh, screening?  Loved it.  I'm at Magoobie's.  We look...  We all look good on the big screen. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  The Magoobie's when?  Friday, Saturday.  Yes, Jimmy's in, uh...  It's a great club, man.  Yes, it is.  And they have great new food.  They have a new menu.  Oh, good.  Yeah, we looked, uh...  We looked great on the big screen.  Yeah, that was...  It was pretty fucking exciting, huh?  I guess.  Damn.  By the time the movie comes out.  We won an award from that.  Did you really?  People's Choice Award.  Congratulations.  You know, the movie looks great.  We went to a screening in a real theater.  All our faces are really big on the fucking screen.  Ooh. 
[03:19:00]  I mean, by the time this movie comes out, though, you know...  We're gonna look like shit, because we're aging.  My kid's gonna accept the award.  My parents couldn't be here.  We couldn't get them out of the home.  I was trying to think of a worse dad award thing.  Fuck.  But I mean, we started...  Well, we...  Whatever.  Five...  Yeah, but listen...  Four or five years ago, right?  A lot of these things take time.  Once the Weinstein brothers get their hands on it...  I used to look good, man.  That was before two kids.  I'm looking at myself on the big screen going,  God damn, you were good looking.  So, can you get the movie out before I officially look like an old man? 
[03:19:30]  Holy fuck.  Oh, man, you look like the big screen.  I don't get that.  Wow.  That was just terrible.  I know.  That was terrible.  I wanted to end on a high note.  I thought Lady Di walked into Marion.  That was a Marion.  You're a big screen.  Holy fuck.  I just realized it's who gives a fuck, but I had a dream that I ran into those two knuckleheads.  Really?  And I forgot about that until this very second.  Isn't that weird?  And it was uneventful in my dream, obviously. 
[03:20:00]  Well, just like their appearance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but...  Wow, it's so weird you brought that up.  Just like your appearance.  She was like Chip.  She had the lisp thing and the fucking...  The bad jokes, yeah.  You always gotta end on a high note.  All I'm saying is...  That's why I like to get fucking zoated!  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  Left the building.  But Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at home, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next. 
[03:20:30]  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived.  Call 866-969-1969.  Your phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Yes, it does. 
[03:21:00]  The Jim Norton Show is here.  I love that song.  I really do just want to listen to it.  Um, a lot of times Anthony pointed out that I used to start out with an email, but I don't  do that now because for some reason the calls have been coming in a little bit faster.  And, um, you know, I'm very tired today.  I talk a lot about being tired on this program and people are very good.  Um, I still haven't addressed it because now my special is shot and I'm editing.  So now I have to address that very soon.  So you guys don't have to hear this every week. 
[03:21:30]  Wednesdays are tough for me because I do this and then I fucking go to therapy and then I  try to get to the gym.  So my gym days are much later.  I like to go at like 10, 15, 1030 to the gym and then just work out while I'm still going  on show energy.  And, um, I got a trainer.  I've taken three, uh, three sessions with my trainer.  I saw her last Thursday, last Friday and then a Monday and it was really good.  Like I didn't want to train her and she, we did like these little warmup things and she 
[03:22:00]  does like circuit training where your fucking cardio goes way up and then you come down  and then your cardio goes up and then you come down and I am literally, I can't talk  during the workout.  Like we'll stop.  She'll be okay.  Take a break.  It's good.  It's good to get your heart rate up like that.  I went to your, uh, Caroline show last week on Friday night.  Thank you.  And, um, my wife and I heard a lot of people saying how small you look, like how, how much  thinner than you used to be.  Yeah.  I mean, it's all, uh, it's all just going to the gym and eating better. 
[03:22:30]  People keep asking me, what is it?  But then there's this layer of fat that you can't get rid of.  I mean, it will eventually go, but it's like this layer that wraps around.  It's like, how do you get rid of this?  They always say the last 10 pounds, but whatever it is, the last 15 pounds or 12 pounds, whatever  I have to get rid of is fucking tough, man.  So I've, I've debated liposuction, but I'm not going to do that for a while.  You don't need that.  No, but it's soft and mushy.  And if it doesn't go away, I want to get rid of it.  Yeah, but it's, it's barely noticeable at this point.  I know, but you don't see me.  You're not looking at me naked.  I'm looking at me naked.  And so is everyone else who's under the age of 18. 
[03:23:00]  I'm kidding.  So what, what, um, do we get descriptions up on these people?  No, the first two lines didn't catch up with the software over here, but I have them here.  Uh, the first line is, uh, Steve wants to talk about standup.  And line two is Travis in Maryland, um, wants to talk to you about signing his book.  I don't know.  All right.  What do you want to know about standup, Steve?  I mean, uh, Steve, you're on.  Hey, first caller.  Nice.  How are you doing, Jim?  Um, I have my own, uh, mental issues.  I'm sure, uh, we all do, but, um, I've always, uh, wanted to do standup, some, something like 
[03:23:30]  that, writing, uh, I did open mic, uh, a couple of years ago once and I've wanted to do it  again, but I keep, you know, feeding myself these reasons that I'm not doing it.  Sure.  And, uh, two of them are, uh, one, I don't want, I don't know how to, you know, do jokes  and, and not copy someone else.  You know, how do, how do you know that you're not stealing someone else's jokes if you're  not seeing everybody that's out there? 
[03:24:00]  Well, I don't watch everybody who's out there for that reason.  Um, and you have to just trust yourself.  And if you question a joke, really question it.  Um, and if it's something you're not sure of, don't do it.  But eventually you'll find your voice and you'll find, um, what it is that makes you  funny.  You know, uh, you have to be very aware of that though.  Just be very aware of it and try very, very hard not to do it.  Um, and the other thing I keep telling myself is that I, I think when I did the, the open  micro, it was like, I think three minutes.  And for some reason I keep having this idea that I'd have to have like an hour of stuff 
[03:24:30]  built up.  No, you know how long it took me to get an hour of stuff, dude?  For years, for a few years, I had five, 10 minutes, then 15 minutes.  And then eventually you build up to 30 to middle.  It's like, wow.  I could never picture doing a fucking hour.  And now, like, uh, when I'm performing, Kenny lights me at 30 to let me know where I'm  at.  And a lot of times I still do an hour and 10.  Like a normal headline says 45 or 50.  It took me a long, long time to build up to that, to be that comfortable that I'm that 
[03:25:00]  confident that I can stay on stage that long.  But again, you'll get that.  Don't see what you're doing is you're worrying about things which are preventing you from  doing it.  Exactly.  How about this?  You put together five minutes to three to five minutes and you work on that and you  go up on stage and you make sure it's original.  It's your own thoughts.  But try it.  Don't fucking sit on it and wait and wait and wait.  Because the day that all of a sudden you're comfortable and you know it's right and you  know the material's good, that day never comes.  Yeah, I know.  And I, and the other thing is like how often, like if you do that, say, you know, I don't 
[03:25:30]  know how often you open mics or say you go on a Tuesday and then you go back to next  week.  Do you do the same five minutes?  Yes.  Yeah, do the same five minutes for a while, buddy.  All right.  I would suggest that.  And then as you go on, new material will come to you and you'll try that.  All right, man.  Good luck, brother.  Bye, thanks.  Let's go to Aaron in New Hampshire.  The girl you're dating gave you a head on the first date.  That sounds like a winner.  Oh, sounds good.  So we're co-workers and we went out one night in a small group and what happened was  we ended up getting pretty drunk because we went back to my house and we ended up having 
[03:26:00]  sex and she gave me a really good head.  But now we're starting a date and all of a sudden she won't give me a head anymore.  I don't know why.  Did you ask her why?  She said, at first she said, she said, ew.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  We'll do it the first night.  It's not a big deal.  You know, it's part of sex.  It's all that.  And she just said, no, no, no, no, no.  Was that the only time you've gotten drunk before sex?  No.  No, it wasn't.  So even the other few times we did, too. 
[03:26:30]  And she still won't suck your dick?  No.  Well, you know, that sounds to me like you have to put your foot down and say, it depends  on how important head is to you.  For some guys, they just like to fuck.  It's not a big deal to them.  For me, it's a big deal.  If you don't suck dick, I'm not dating you.  You like her, but do you like head more?  I don't know.  It's quite a borderline, I guess, right now.  Well, again, that's up to you.  You have to make that decision.  She obviously doesn't like sucking dick, which means in Jim Norton's world, she's not a contender. 
[03:27:00]  Not even for friendship.  But if your head's not that important to you, or you can wait until she's ready.  Any girl that said, ew, if I was with a girl and she said, ew, about sucking dick, I would  not, not only would I not date her, I wouldn't even finish the meal.  I'd be like, I have to go to the bathroom.  And I would just get into my car and fucking go home.  Yeah, yeah.  She did a good job the first night, though.  That's why I'm like, man, that sucks.  Yeah.  I have a real quick question.  So the last couple of times we got together, maybe the second time we got together, she 
[03:27:30]  got a UTI.  And then I'm like, the last time, over the weekend, she's like, no, she's like, I'm worried  I'm going to get it again.  I'm like, oh, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  You'll be good.  It's just, you know, rare that it happens, whatever.  She kind of thinks that she has one again.  I don't know what's going on here.  Some women just get them, man.  Maybe she has a high yeast count in her box.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Women's pussies are fucking weird.  There's always something happening with them.  It's like, oh, no, I can't eat that.  If I have a search, my pussy foams. 
[03:28:00]  You know, there's all this weird chemical stuff that goes on with women.  So that's something I have zero experience in.  But I would talk about the blowjobs, my friend.  And, you know, I would absolutely have a real discussion with her about that, because  if she's not sucking dick, I don't know how you're going to deal with her.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Sounds good, buddy.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Good luck.  How about Nick in New Hampshire, dating a girl, still talking to her ex, huh?  Hey, Jim.  I fucking love you, man.  Thank you, buddy.  The only reason XM gets their 50 bucks a quarter at me, I swear to God. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, thank you.  All right.  So, yeah.  I went out with this girl nine months ago, about one day.  We had a fucking awesome time.  She calls me the next day, says she's going back to her ex-boyfriend and a kid together.  I'm like, all right.  So nine months goes by.  She sends me a message out of the blue.  I'm finally over him.  I haven't stopped you.  Can we go out?  I'm like, well, sure.  So I take her out.  Great girl.  And I'm 45.  She's 35.  Okay.  It's not like there's an abundance of good-looking single women in New Hampshire.  How old is the kid? 
[03:29:00]  How old is the kid?  Two.  Okay.  Two and a half.  And she's hot as hell.  You know, no job.  Three kids by two different guys.  Okay.  I know what you're going to tell me, and that's why I'm calling.  I want you to tell me I'm a dumbass and get over her.  Well, you said she's still talking to her ex?  Well, no.  We went out for a month.  Fucking awesome time.  Waited a month before I even slept with her.  Had a great time.  A couple of days later, she calls me up.  I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.  And they're together now.  But she texts me all the time. 
[03:29:30]  And she has her friend call me all the time.  Oh, no.  I can't get over him.  I don't stop thinking about him.  So, I mean, this bitch just stringing me along.  What the fuck?  She obviously is a mess because she is with three kids with two different guys.  Three kids.  But she was married for 15 years.  Okay.  So she has two kids with her husband.  But she still has no guy now.  So, first of all, she wants security.  So the ex is always...  First of all, he's the father of one of her kids.  So he's always going to take priority.  She's always going to talk to him.  For the next 20 years, she's tied to this guy. 
[03:30:00]  So no matter how secure you are in your relationship, two times since you've known her, she's gone back to him.  It will probably happen again.  Maybe because the kid there is such a bond.  But it's also what forces them to communicate.  They will always have to see each other at his events, at the kids' events, at the kids' school, at the kids' this, the kids' that.  They'll make decisions together.  I would stay away if I were you.  Because if she just ran back to him, the first time is understandable because you had one date.  But now she had nine more months with the guy. 
[03:30:30]  And she goes, I want you.  And then she dates you for a month and she goes back with him.  Maybe she's just using you to kind of have a little soft pillow to fall on when her and the ex have trouble.  Maybe she has no intention on dating with you.  So fuck her.  Go find somebody else.  I'm sure she's terrific and fun.  But I would say fucking nerds to this girl.  The next time she fucking texts, she just send a picture of your cock and say, hit the bricks, toots.  You got it.  You're the best, buddy.  Thank you, my friend.  Good luck.  Okay.  How about this one? 
[03:31:00]  I let my friend money.  David in Tennessee.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you, buddy?  Good, good.  How are you, David?  You let your friend money to fix his car a year ago, but he still hasn't fixed it.  What should I do?  No, that's similar to what it is.  I have the same three group of guys come up every year that I grew up with in Florida.  And they come up to Tennessee and they stay at my house and everything.  And it's great.  We've been doing it for 10, 12 years.  Well, they brought a new guy up this year.  And that's fine.  I'm perfectly fine.  They were here a week.  Everything went great. 
[03:31:30]  This was last year.  On the last day, my dumb neighbor was mowing his yard and a rock flew out of the mower and  hit his windshield and put a little crack in it.  So I gave the guy a check for 500 bucks.  If it's more, let me know.  I'll pay.  If not, send me the difference.  That check couldn't get, couldn't have got cash quick enough.  Okay.  Why did you give him the check, by the way?  Well, I just felt bad.  You know, the neighbor's kid was mowing my yard.  You know, I did feel bad.  Oh, it was your yard.  Okay.  Yeah, it was my yard.  So I did feel bad. 
[03:32:00]  But it was a tiny crack.  I'm telling you, you'd really have to look for it.  So anyway, I gave him the money to pay for it.  I never hear from him again until the next year.  They come back up here.  And I just so happened, I looked and that fucking crack's still there.  And it just, I can't help it, man.  My three buddies know nothing about this.  Or they wouldn't even be his friend, I don't think.  But I don't want to, you know, blow up as far away.  Hold on.  Did he demand the money from you?  No.  No, I offered it to him. 
[03:32:30]  I said, here's 500 bucks.  Here's a check for $500.  I don't know what the rule is in Florida.  If it's more to get it fixed, let me know.  If it's less, just send me the difference.  Well.  That check was cashed the next day.  I understand it.  Look, I understand why you'd be irritated.  You have to eat this one.  I'll tell you why.  You fulfilled, first of all, he didn't demand the money from you.  So I would say fuck him.  But he didn't ask you for it.  And maybe, yeah, an honorable man would have given you the money back because he didn't fix the window.  But if you give him money for his pain and suffering, or for his tangible replacement part, 
[03:33:00]  and he chooses to spend it on somebody else,  technically I think it's none of your business.  And I'm not saying that to be a dick.  Like, I'm saying you fulfilled your part of an obligation that you needed to fulfill,  and he's not asking you for more.  He didn't ask you for that.  And it's not like he's coming to you and going like,  hey, man, I still need something for the window.  So it doesn't matter.  I would say fuck it, let it go.  But it didn't bother him one bit to come back up the following year, use my house, 
[03:33:30]  use the tickets I gave him to go to the race, taking advantage of my friends.  I mean, it's just little things bother me.  I don't care about the money.  I really don't.  He might not be – I apologize for interrupting you.  He might not be thinking of it like that.  It's like if somebody – say somebody fucks up my rug,  and they pay me for a new rug,  and I go, hey, man, I really appreciate that,  but I'm going to buy a painting instead.  Well, they've paid me for the part that's damaged.  If I'm still willing to deal with the part that's damaged, 
[03:34:00]  both parties have, I think, fulfilled their obligation.  Like, he's not asking you for more money.  He was okay with what you gave him.  He didn't ask for it.  So I would say that had he demanded it, you would be right to be annoyed,  or if he asked you for more, you'd be right to be annoyed.  But I would just let it go, unless the guy's a dick,  or you could ask him about it.  Why don't you sit him down and go, hey, look, I'm just curious.  I gave you money for that, and I know the money I gave to you.  It's up to you.  He may go, dude, I had a fucking – I totally forgot about it.  I had a real issue with this. 
[03:34:30]  So maybe that money went to something better,  and he's willing to live with the cracked window.  All very good points.  I didn't want to bring it up.  I don't want to wreck any relationship.  I have friends I've had for years and years.  Sure, sure.  I really don't.  And you make some valid points.  Yeah, he didn't demand it from you.  So, again, the guy may be a bit of a, you know, kind of shitty,  but I would say let it go, man, unless he asks you for more, okay?  Well, I appreciate it, buddy. 
[03:35:00]  I really do, because I'm telling you, I get on these kicks.  I cannot quit thinking about it.  It drives me insane, but thank you.  But you've made some –  Yeah, like, you know, let it go.  It's not that big a deal.  And don't forget, you did the right thing, and that's all that matters.  You made the right move.  You're an honorable guy, and that's what's important.  If he's less than honorable,  or maybe he needed the money for something really important,  and he just forgot about it.  Sometimes people just forget.  Maybe he literally just didn't – you know,  he thought that was the end of the transaction, 
[03:35:30]  and whatever he did didn't matter.  So I wouldn't let it bother me, okay?  I appreciate it, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  I love you, man.  Thank you, brother.  I appreciate it.  Joe in Boston, what do you mean I'm featured in a tech song by Nicky Romero?  Who's Nicky Romero?  Hello?  Hi, Joe.  How are you?  I'm good, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good, thank you.  Yeah, I was listening a little cross-promotion.  I was listening to Electric Area on SiriusXM,  and the pad data came up when I was to work.  It said Nicky Romero plus Jim Norton, 
[03:36:00]  and the song is called WTF Language.  And it's, you know, like typical techno song.  It builds and builds and builds.  The beat drops.  Some random person screams, what the fuck,  and then your voice pops in, and you say, language.  And I don't know if you knew that.  I don't know if I was late or if you knew that.  No, I didn't know it, but I will look it up.  Yeah, because I looked on it.  Maybe one of your guys can find it.  I literally couldn't find it on YouTube,  and I only looked for about, like, two minutes.  But I thought it was fucking hilarious. 
[03:36:30]  You were featured in a very bouncy techno song.  Thanks very much.  I appreciate it.  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right, let's see.  What was my workout?  Let's talk to Joe in Boston.  I have a brief answer.  This is Joe in Boston.  Hey, Jimmy.  How's it going?  Good, thank you.  You were asking about the workout routine before I had the trainer.  The trainer's brand new.  My workout routine...  I'm sorry?  Sorry, I just wanted to preface it by saying I've always had a problem.  I'm like, I'm not an overweight guy.  It'd be nice to have a little bit of definition going on. 
[03:37:00]  Sure.  So, like, the thing is, I can never take a workout because I get bored as shit,  and I think most people do.  But I'm always looking online and saying, well, what's this routine?  What's that routine?  This guy says this, but this person says that doesn't work.  So, like, I started recently for the last two weeks, and it's been working, just going  at my own pace, doing what I think is a good workout, and I've talked to it so far.  So I'm just wondering if that's what you did or if you were doing what I did and, like,  incessantly going on and saying, well, I should do this and not that and blah, blah, blah.  A little bit of both.  A little bit of both.  What finally got me into, like, starting to down this good road I'm on was I joined the 
[03:37:30]  gym Opie goes to, which was a big gym, so there's a lot to keep me busy.  And I switch it up.  Like, one day, I would do boxing.  I would do 10 – I would usually do 10 three-minute rounds on the heavy bag.  Now, I don't have excellent boxing technique or whatever, but it puts a little strength  in the arms, and it also – you know, it's good to work the chest, and it's good for  cardio, and you're moving.  Anything that would help.  The next day, I would do, say, 45 minutes on the elliptical machine. 
[03:38:00]  I would do that.  And then I would do – the next day after that, I would do pull-ups.  I do pull-ups almost every time I do upper body.  I would do, like, sets of 10 pull-ups, and then I would do, say, eight or nine different,  like, chest or bicep exercises and push-ups in between that.  Like, I would do – I start my routine.  I'll do 10 pull-ups or 12 pull-ups, depending on how I'm feeling that day, or 15, but usually  10.  And then after my 10 pull-ups, I'll go – say, I do the machine.  I'll do bench pressing. 
[03:38:30]  I'll do two sets of benching.  Then I'll get down and do 25 push-ups.  Then I finish up my final two sets of benching.  And then – so that's one segment.  It's the pull-ups.  It's four sets of benching of the same exercise with pull-ups – push-ups in between.  And then I'll go do 10 more pull-ups.  And then, say, I'll go and do a shoulder press.  Two sets shoulder press.  Get down to 25 push-ups.  Then the final two shoulder press sets.  So that was what I was doing, four sets of everything with push-ups in between.  And it really helps work the upper body. 
[03:39:00]  And I think push-ups and pull-ups are very good for you.  So I would mix it up like that a lot.  You know, then the next day I would do back.  Or the next day – there's a great ab routine.  I think this guy called Matt Staub or something.  I forget what it's called.  But it's called 8-pack abs.  And I do that almost every other day.  And it's 1,000 reps.  It's like 20 – it's 10 different exercises.  You do 25 of each one, which is 250, and you run through that four times.  And you're supposed to do it every other day.  I do it like every other day, every third day. 
[03:39:30]  Matt Staub, I think his name is.  I don't know.  So the trainers had me doing different shit.  But, dude, I mixed it up so much.  And I wound up hurting myself in my right elbow, which kind of fucked me up, which is why I started doing this ad thing.  Because I overdid it, and I didn't stretch properly.  And now kettlebells.  I was doing kettlebells, but I don't think I was doing them right.  So now my trainer has me doing them a little bit.  But I would suggest learning how to do the kettlebells.  Just mix it up and confuse your body.  And there might be somebody out there telling me, 
[03:40:00]  Jimmy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  I can only tell you what I did.  And I would mix it up with a little bit of swimming too.  All right?  Okay.  Yeah, just one more quick thing.  See, like, that workout sounds like it does, like, a lot.  But the thing is, like, I'm not even close to being capable of doing, like,  like, my body gets tired really fast.  Yeah.  When I'm doing, like, I'll do 25 push-ups.  And then I'll go try to do some other upper body thing.  I can do, like, maybe two when, like, I have complete muscle exhaustion.  And it's always been that way for me.  And it doesn't seem to ever go away. 
[03:40:30]  I don't know if that's, like, a hill you have to get over or what.  Yeah, I think you get better with that.  You push yourself a little bit.  And also find out about diet.  And maybe you should be eating something right before that would give you some energy,  some protein.  Again, I don't know enough about that.  But, you know, find out about diet, what you should be eating.  There might be something you're doing which is causing you to crash during your workouts, too.  So, you know, again, I'm a novice at this, dude.  I've been doing it for a while.  But I went on my own for a long time.  And I kind of hit a plateau because your body does get used to things. 
[03:41:00]  And then I hurt my arm, which really limited me.  So I couldn't do everything and mix it up as much as I was.  So the trainer is really helping me now.  But that was what I was doing.  Just keep going online.  You can find so many great exercises online.  Find great ab routine.  That ab routine I do is really good.  Now it's all diet.  I just got to get rid of this fucking blah bar.  Yes, E-Rod.  The one you're talking about, his last name is S-T-R-U-V-E.  Oh, Matt Strave?  Yeah.  Yeah, he does it.  He's like a...  It's for eight-pack abs, I think.  He's like a shirtless guy.  Does the exercise. 
[03:41:30]  He's got a ton of YouTube videos.  Oh, okay.  I've only seen that one.  And you feel kind of gay watching it.  But it's like this guy really knows what he's doing.  And he's in great shape.  And it's helped me a lot, dude.  My abs feel much stronger.  It's just the eating, which keeps a little bit of fat on him.  All right.  Good luck, my friend.  Thanks.  You are very welcome.  So let's see...  Oh, Joe thinks he's coming too quickly because he masturbates a lot.  Jimmy.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you doing? 
[03:42:00]  Good, good.  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  My wife started working night shifts.  So I got born.  So I'm watching X-Habster all the time.  At first I was figuring I'm just desensitizing myself to sex.  And then I realized, well, I never used to come from being jerked off by her.  Now it's all the time.  So it's ruining my fucking sex life.  So, wait.  Being come by being jerked off by her is ruining your sex life?  Well, because I'm never...  Now I'm coming too quickly from it.  So I'm not getting to the point where I can fuck my wife.  Or if I am fucking my wife, I'm coming too quickly from that. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, I've heard...  I've always heard the opposite, the jerking off...  See, for me, it desensitized me a little bit.  Well, just stop doing that then.  Oh, it is.  It's not that easy, though.  Simple and easy are different things.  It is that simple.  Don't do it.  If something is hurting you, don't do it.  Replace it with something else if you can.  Or watch the porn with her.  Or is there something you're watching you don't want her to know about?  Oh, no.  I don't give a shit about that.  Okay, then maybe bridge it and watch with her. 
[03:43:00]  But if your sex life was better before the porn, and the porn's making you come too quickly,  then stop watching the porn.  Whenever you want to watch the porn, can't you bring her in and fuck her instead?  Or do you just not want to?  Are you just enjoying the porn?  Oh, no.  I mean, I enjoy the porn plenty, but she's not there at night now.  Oh, so you're doing it when she's not there because it's the only thing you can do.  Pretty much, yeah.  My only suggestion is to cut down on the porn because that seems to be what your trouble is.  So if you cut down on the porn and you start coming regularly again, you'll know that was the right move. 
[03:43:30]  Is she complaining about you coming too quickly?  No, not at all.  But it's just annoying the shit out of me because I'd really like to fuck my wife longer.  Well, can't you do a little bit more in foreplay?  Or are you doing more in foreplay and it's still not helping?  We're doing more in foreplay just to compensate for it, but it's not helping that build.  I mean, it's helping heart build, but...  Sure.  But you're still blowing loads too fast.  You got it.  Pretty much.  Well, you know, my friend, I would say that's your solution. 
[03:44:00]  I think that's the only way.  Not as easy as it sounds, but it is that simple.  If you're jerking off too much and it's making you come fast, stop jerking off and you'll probably go back to where you were.  Let's hope you're right.  You're a gentleman and a scholar, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I'm neither.  Be good.  Brian in the Bronx.  I'll just ask you.  You don't have to get on.  Why don't I bring my trainer on the show?  Honestly, because I just started working with her.  I would.  I don't know if she wants to be known.  But she's really nice.  And Brian, if I continue to work with her, and if she has a desire to come on the advice show, I certainly would. 
[03:44:30]  Because she's a really nice trainer.  You know, I like her a lot.  So I would.  I'll see how she feels about that.  All right.  Let's go to Mark in Illinois.  Is being in the entertainment industry a big influence to losing weight?  Is that what you want to know?  Hey, Jim.  Hello, Mark.  Hey, buddy.  Good to talk to you, man.  Thank you.  I really enjoy your shit.  I appreciate that.  Jim, I've always wondered, you know, you hear, you know, rocks, old rock stars say, you know, 
[03:45:00]  I've heard one in particular say that in Hollywood it's almost, you know, it's almost better to be a junkie than to be overweight.  Did it influence your decision at all?  Or does that help you in the entertainment industry to be thin?  Well, you know, it's funny.  It doesn't hurt.  Will it help?  I don't know.  Like, when you look at comedians, comedians are lucky in that we can kind of get away with looking like shit.  I mean, look at what happens is once you start to get more notoriety, you know, and, you know, you're like, wow, maybe I could date some more cool people. 
[03:45:30]  Then you want to start looking better because it's embarrassing.  But look at Chris Farley.  Look at John Belushi.  Look at John Candy.  There's so many.  Or Jackie Gleason.  I mean, there's a million funny fat men.  Caliendo was fat, and he looks better now, but he was heavy for a while.  I don't think it hurts you as a stand-up.  It might hurt you with certain roles because it's always more pleasant to look at somebody who's not overweight. 
[03:46:00]  And it has motivated me more because I'm exposed to a lot of people.  So when I see myself, most people don't get to see themselves on film, but when I see myself on a Leno clip and I'm a fat-necked cock, or I see myself on a stand-up clip and my head is like, blah, blah, blah, blah, like a fucking testicle in jelly.  That was kind of part of my question.  Obviously, you probably would want to do more film roles, right?  So, you know, do you think that that, or does it make any difference? 
[03:46:30]  It does make a difference.  I tell you, it hasn't hurt Philip Seymour Hoffman, though.  So I think if you're talented enough, it doesn't, you know, you can get through it.  But I think that the desire to get in shape, the more you're photographed and the more you're on film, the more you see yourself accurately, and you want to lose the weight.  So that's how it's helped me.  And I'm in a business where you are judged by your looks and you are judged by your age.  So I want to look younger, and losing weight helps you do that.  So there is a certain thing where I'm 44 now. 
[03:47:00]  I have to start thinking of that shit.  So, yes, it has been an influence on it, but it was more my own discomfort with how I looked.  Because, you know, being in the entertainment industry means nothing.  While I'm over a girl fucking her, my gut's hanging down on my fucking tits, and I'm embarrassed to be naked in front of her.  That's just Jim Norton.  So it's possible to succeed.  But, you know, thank you very much.  Okay, bud.  Hey, TC in Virginia, how does Jimmy deal with his nervous facial tits?  I need advice.  Good question. 
[03:47:30]  Yes, sir.  Hey, Jim, love what you do.  Hi.  Thank you.  All the characters, really.  Yeah, I just, you know, I just get nervous, and then I start, like, thinking about it.  And that's when it happens more, and I just try to separate myself from it, but it's just become really tough.  See, I don't think about it.  Like, for me, it's not even a nervous thing.  It's like when I have a certain energy output, then that's more like I blink, like a little blinky zilcher.  I'm a twitchy weirdo.  Like, I've been that way my whole life, and it doesn't feel nervous. 
[03:48:00]  And a lot of times I don't realize it until I see myself on video.  My left eye is not as good as my right eye for some reason.  There's always a weird strain in my left eye.  I don't know if that contributes to it or not, but I don't deal with it or not deal with it.  It's probably hurt me acting-wise.  You know, it's probably because people see you on film, and they're like, what the fuck is this maniac?  Nobody wants to hire someone to play a doctor who's blinking like that.  So maybe it has hurt me like that, but it's just a part of who I am, and it is what it is. 
[03:48:30]  You know, I have no real solution for it or answer for it.  I've gotten as far as I've gotten with it.  It's probably hurt a little bit.  But, you know, I don't really think about it that much.  All right.  Okay?  Thanks.  You're very welcome.  Tyler in Texas.  My wife is getting heavy.  How do I approach her about that?  I would suggest with an African safari hat and fucking safari jacket.  Do that with an elephant gun, and then she'll get the hint. 
[03:49:00]  Or whatever, like, just hide behind bushes and pretend you're stalking her.  And she'll go, what are you doing?  And you'll say, I'm hunting an elephant.  Oh, no, it's you, honey.  Same joke twice.  Sorry, buddy.  What is it?  What is it?  I don't know.  She's not that big.  Oh, okay.  When we met eight years ago, she was a...  A-T-E.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  She was a real good-looking, fit woman.  I mean, we're both 27 years old, and now that we're married and living together, and we've 
[03:49:30]  lived together for seven years, it's just she's kind of letting herself go, and her family's  kind of not really fat and overweight, but, I mean, she's got an obese family, and I've  given her some subtle hints, like, hey, maybe we can both start going and hitting the gym  together, and she's like, well, we don't have time, and I don't know, I've tried it  in several different ways of going, hey, I really don't like that you're getting fat. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, I would suggest going to the gym for a little while by myself and getting into  better shape, and hopefully that will motivate her, but you may have to sometimes have a  loving but unpleasant conversation.  If you're not having sex with her as much, or you're not touching her as much...  I've noticed that the sex has gone down a lot.  Sure it has, because you're not as turned on, and you're resentful.  You're resentful of the fact that she's letting her...  Sometimes it's like, yeah, I can still get turned on and fuck you, but, like, hey, you  don't care enough about me as a man being turned on. 
[03:50:30]  Like, that is something that people do.  It's like, she expects you to fucking pay the bills, probably, or to do your duties.  Do your duty.  And she expects you to fulfill your...  She does a lot.  What's that?  She does a lot.  I mean, she's a really awesome chick.  She's just...  Sure.  I mean, she's a good housewife.  I mean, she's an awesome chick.  She's just...  Getting fat.  Yeah.  Okay, let me say it like this, then.  That's...  Part of a woman's job in a relationship, whether you like to hear this or not, is looking somewhat 
[03:51:00]  decent and fuckable.  And that's part of a guy's job, too.  But men are more providers.  And let's be honest, you know, very rarely do really hot women marry really...  I forget what I was going to say.  The man's job is to be the provider.  Okay?  That's the point.  Really hot men don't usually marry really ugly women, is what I was trying to say.  It's hot women that marry an uglier guy or a less-than guy, because, hey, what he gets 
[03:51:30]  is her hotness, and what she gets is the provider and the guy that takes care of her.  That's how I meant to phrase that.  So if she's not kind of owning up to that and realizing, hey, the woman is supposed to  kind of look good, then you should definitely have a nice discussion with her.  Get yourself in better shape first, so you have a fucking place to stand when you're  talking.  You know, you don't want to be a three and then complain about her.  Yeah.  I really fucking butchered that.  It's not real bad now, but I can see it potentially getting to where it is.  Right, yeah, yeah. 
[03:52:00]  I would start going to the gym more and really encourage her to come with you as time goes  on.  Give yourself a little time to get into a routine, though, so she'll see you going a lot.  Okay.  All right, good luck.  And the guy said, why doesn't Norton bring a tranny on air?  Not my trainer.  Um, the guy misheard.  The tranny on air, transsexual, is, uh, Bailey J was going to come last week, but I think  her husband had jury duty or something, and I didn't hear from her this week.  Bailey J better fucking step it up.  I want her on the show.  It's like, uh, you know, I'm trying to work on something for Bailey J and myself, because 
[03:52:30]  I really like her.  But, um, she will, uh, I'm sure come back.  Someone says, uh, Jim in Jersey.  That's me.  Is it gay to get your ass fingered while getting a BJ?  Let's get, let's get, uh, my alter ego on the phone.  Hey, Chipper.  What's happening?  So, I've been getting ripped apart by my friends for this, for, by the last couple  years.  I don't, I don't think it's gay to get, you know, just a tip.  What do you think?  No, I don't.  I think it's perfectly fine.  All right. 
[03:53:00]  Good luck.  All right.  Now, let's see what, uh, uh, Andrew in New Jersey.  How is it considered hack to do other comedian shows, but cover bands get a pass?  All right, yeah, let me explain.  Say, uh, like, even your partner does a killer Dice Clay impression, right?  Yeah.  Now, he could, you know, if he wasn't Anthony on the radio, he can go out and do, like,  a, the Dice Clay experience and just do his whole act. 
[03:53:30]  And people will probably pay it, but if that's considered hack, but cover bands are okay.  I don't understand that.  Well, I think a couple of things could be going to play here.  First of all, cover, comedy is supposed to be original thoughts, whereas you're claiming  your thoughts as your own, whereas a lot of times cover bands are not claiming the songs  as their own.  Like, when somebody does, it's almost like when Frank Caliendo goes up and does an impression,  he's, even though he's writing the material, he's still doing somebody else's voice. 
[03:54:00]  But people know that Frank is, is giving credit to the voice where he should get.  Like, Frank is not a hack at all.  He's a great impressionist.  Doing somebody else's act and claiming it as your own, because Frank's act is his.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, the material is his.  The thoughts are his.  He's just doing the voice.  But guys that go up and do other people's thoughts as their own are considered dishonest.  I think hack is easy, and it's also dishonest, kind of goes into hack.  Say Rodney.  Now, Rodney's been dead, you know, what, 10 years, whatever. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  And I saw Rodney a couple times.  If you saw him in 1960 or 1990, it was the same act.  Nothing was topical.  But how about if you did, like, Rodney's act?  You know, he's dead.  He's not hurting anybody.  You're not taking money out of his pocket.  I think, because I think also with comedians that we've come to love,  a lot more of who they are and their personality goes into helping us enjoy what they're doing.  Like, when you hear a comedian's point of view, there's something about that person that ropes you in as well. 
[03:55:00]  So to see somebody else doing a point of view or what is supposed to be an original thought as their own,  it just feels wrong.  Like, when you watch that, it doesn't feel right.  Whereas I think with bands, a lot of times we are less invested in why they're thinking what they're thinking.  And, again, that's just my opinion on it.  I could be totally wrong.  But that's why it doesn't bother me.  But you raise a good question.  Why is a cover band okay but a cover comic not?  Another part of it, too, dude, is that comedy, for comedy to work, 
[03:55:30]  and we talked about this with Zombie yesterday,  the joke is kind of contingent on catching you off guard.  Like, you may enjoy hearing a joke twice,  but very rarely do you want to go see the same comedy act over and over and over.  People kind of get critical of that.  Whereas a band can do two or three new songs and you're like,  oh, God, thank God they did all the hits.  Comedians don't necessarily have hits that get played on the radio.  Like, you know, comedy, comedian stuff isn't played in the clubs. 
[03:56:00]  You know, it's just a different form of the arts.  I feel bad for you guys because, you know, like you said,  you only want to hear a joke a couple of times  and you constantly have to come out with new material.  You know, I could write a couple of good songs and make a living for the rest of my life.  Yeah, I mean, that is a difference.  But you raise, look, you raise an interesting question.  That's why I think it is because comedy is supposed to be based on original thoughts  and original points of view where you're kind of telling people something internal.  And for some reason, it feels weird to hear somebody doing shit in that vein 
[03:56:30]  that you know is not theirs, where it doesn't feel weird.  Certain songs might be weird.  Like if you hear somebody covering, say, when P. Diddy did that song about Biggie,  you know, and he covered the police song.  That wasn't weird because he was covering a police song.  But to hear somebody covering Diddy's version because it was about a specific thing  and it was about Biggie would be weird.  Like if you heard somebody doing Diddy's song, you'd be like,  that's kind of fucking weird.  He didn't know Biggie. 
[03:57:00]  What's he doing?  So certain songs might sound weird if they were covered, okay?  I don't mean to babble.  I apologize.  I'm tired.  Thanks a lot, kid.  Good luck, my friend.  It's life.  I know, I'll get to that, E-Rock.  Someone says cover bands are considered a scam.  I mean, you raise a good question.  I mean, you know, here's the question about cover bands.  I mean, what's the most important holiday when you listen to a cover band?  Is it Christmas?  Is it Valentine's Day?  I mean, look, maybe they're both close, but it's obviously Mother's Day. 
[03:57:30]  That's the difference.  There's only one mother.  Like, you know what I mean?  So if you want to take your mother, I'm really trying to tie this in, but it's hard.  You want to take your mother out?  If she was a good mother, you take her out to see a band.  If she was kind of shit, take her to see a cover band.  Or if she's a good mother, you could always, well, make sure she knows it.  How could you do that?  Wow, are the wheels coming off.  Make sure all the moms in your life know how great they were.  What's the perfect gift?  Thank God it's our old friend Stephen Singer, who will tolerate me butchering his read. 
[03:58:00]  They have famous gold dip roses, of course.  It's the perfect gift for your mom, your mother-in-law, or the mother of your children.  Any mom you know will love a gold dip rose.  You know that.  It's a real long stem rose dipped in 24 karat pure gold.  This gift lasts forever.  It lasts forever.  Or until your house burns down in a tragic smoking fire.  Like, if your mom smokes and falls asleep with a cigarette in her mouth, she's probably going to be burned alive and your gold dip rose ruined. 
[03:58:30]  Or if your mom drunk drives a lot with her rose on the dashboard, it will probably be melted in the car fire.  However, if those things don't happen, fire notwithstanding, it will last forever.  And it's only 69 bucks.  That is 69 dollars.  Stephen Singer's real long stem roses.  So they come shipped in a beautiful gift box with your own personalized Mother's Day card.  And honestly, we fuck with Stephen Singer, but I have given these as gifts.  They're terrific.  Your own card, your own gift box, of course. 
[03:59:00]  It's a wonderful gift.  Stephen Singer has special colors available only for Mother's Day, and they sell out every year.  We always say that, and then people always complain.  Don't miss out on his new color for 2013.  It's called Timeless Turquoise.  Check it out online right now at IHateStevenSinger.com.  You can order now, or you're going to miss out on the beautiful new color because it's limited and it will go.  Timeless Turquoise.  IHateStevenSinger.com.

And I'm going to apologize for tripping over that clumsily.  I am really tired today.  And I know I've been babbling like a fucking asshole, mixing up my points.  So for those of you that have stayed through this fucking abomination of a show, I really appreciate it.  Doug in Jersey has some advice for me.  Hopefully it's to never talk into a microphone again.  Yes, Doug. 
[04:00:00]  Listen, there was a buddy of mine.  I didn't see him over the summer, and when I could see him in the fall, I said,  How did you lose so much weight?  Are you sick?  He said no.  He started this thing called the Dukan Diet.  D-U-K-A-N.  He dropped 20 pounds.  What is it?  It's like Atkins, but it's basically protein for the first 7 to 10 days.  You cut out the carbs.  You do lean protein.  I started doing it.  I'm down 21 pounds since February.  Okay.  Well, you know, no carb thing is a big thing. 
[04:00:30]  I like eating some carbs.  I think you need some carbs.  But thank you very much.  Huh?  You can have some after you do the, like, initial phase.  Oh, okay.  I told a couple of my buddies, and they're all dropping about a pound a day just doing this  thing.  Look it up.  Thank you.  See the work.  Thank you.  Good luck, brother.  I appreciate your call.  John in Oklahoma.  You're a sponsor.  Hello.  Hi, buddy.  Just do me a favor.  It's up to you if you want to, but I would try not to mention the name.  If you're in a 12-step program, I would just keep it at 12-step program, if that's 
[04:01:00]  cool.  Yeah.  I'd like to break the identity on radio.  Okay.  Well, I've been in recovery for a long time, and my wife passed away, and a girl that I  had been sponsoring who had told me about everything, you know.  Do you mean, told you everything like this?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Do you mean, she sat down with you and told you everything like we do with our sponsors?  Right.  Okay.  And, anyway, it's been like five years since my wife's been gone, and she wants to start 
[04:01:30]  dating, and I'm kind of like, ugh, this may not be a good idea.  Well, let me ask you, if you don't mind me asking you now, you're obviously attracted  to her.  Now, in honesty, how long have you been attracted to her?  Oh, since day one.  So, your motives for, you probably should not be sponsoring.  Why are you sponsoring a woman anyway?  It's usually men with the men, women with the women. 
[04:02:00]  Right.  And, it was kind of an odd situation because of our occupations.  What field are you in?  What kind of job would require a man to sponsor a woman?  I'm an over-the-road driver.  She is, too.  Okay.  You don't drive together.  Not right.  We talk on the phone an awful lot.  You know, truck drivers are chatty son of bitches.  You know that.  But, let me ask you, because the thing is this.  If you have a female friend who is also recovering from whatever, but a sponsor role is very, very 
[04:02:30]  personal, and it's very close, and it seems to me that there's another dynamic working here  which would affect you being a good sponsor.  I can't tell you whether to date or not.  I've never had that situation.  I've never sponsored anybody but men.  But, there's something about that that I definitely think is off.  I think that because it's, if she's being sponsored by somebody and there's a mutual attraction, 
[04:03:00]  that's not what the sponsor-sponsor relationship is supposed to be.  So, I would suggest either telling her she has to get another sponsor and then maybe you  date.  But, I absolutely don't think you can do both.  And, personally, I don't think that men should be sponsoring women they're attracted to for  any reason.  If you're talking to somebody or taking them to a few meetings for whatever program it  may be, that's one thing.  But, motives are everything.  And, I would suggest giving her to a woman who will kick her in the ass and call her on 
[04:03:30]  stuff that a man wouldn't.  Because, a female-female or male-male relationship, we can't pull the same shit we can with the  opposite sex.  So, I would suggest changing something about that relationship because I think that's really  dangerous for her.  Well, I would have already done, went there, done that, and got the damn t-shirt and she  just won't wear it.  She just keeps smugging me. 
[04:04:00]  Well, are you still sponsoring her?  Not really.  You know, I have told her over the years, no, you need to get a female to do this and  to go through this with.  But, you know, in chatting back and forth and talking, everything's kind of come out.  And, now it's wanting to go to a higher level with it, which we never have.  I've been attracted to her since day one.  And, apparently, she's been attracted to me, but we've never been together. 
[04:04:30]  So, that's not a real sponsor-sponsor-sponsor relationship.  And, that's not what a real sponsor-sponsor relationship should be based on.  So, I would suggest, you can't make her do anything, but you should, in my opinion, not  be sponsoring a woman when there's a mutual attraction at all.  That's a relationship she should have with another woman.  And, I know you know that, but knowing it doesn't mean anything if the action isn't happening.  I would personally not be comfortable doing that at all. 
[04:05:00]  So, if you're asking for my advice, I would suggest telling her, and absolutely meaning it,  that she has to get a woman for that role.  And, then maybe, if you guys decide to date, give it a little waiting period and then date.  That's what my suggestion would be.  I can't say don't date.  You're both adults.  And, these things happen.  But, I would certainly make sure she has a good relationship with a new sponsor first.  Well, I just go back to that old two sickies, don't make one welly.  Absolutely not. 
[04:05:30]  You know, that's kind of where I'm at.  But, god damn, I want to try that stuff, too.  You already...  I've only been a woman in 42 years, Jimmy.  I have to wrap up because I'm telling you to go, I appreciate your honesty.  But, let's be honest, you already know the answer.  You know the answer.  You know what the right thing to do is.  And, I know it's hard because a new sponsor may tell her to not be involved with you.  So, right now, you have a certain element of control as the sponsor and a certain level of intimacy  that you're probably afraid you'll lose if she finds a woman. 
[04:06:00]  So, you know what you've got to do, brother.  Alright.  Good luck, Ben.  Thank you for calling.  I appreciate it.  Thank you to everyone who called.  The guy separated from his wife got a blowjob from a randagirl.  Don't know what to do.  I would suggest finding her again and getting blown again.  That's what I would suggest.  Always get the number.  I got sober two years ago.  Lost 75 pounds.  I want to tell Jimmy how I did it.  Call back next week.  I want to pitch an idea for a reality show.  How do I go about that?  If I knew, I'd have a fucking reality show, Jay.
