<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with an unintelligible song fragment before launching into a chaotic mix of topics.  Opie and Anthony, along with frequent in-studio guest Jimmy Norton, begin by complaining extensively about their lack of sleep, a theme echoed by a trucker caller.  Their workplace grievances follow, focusing on issues with "WOW" stickers, office supplies, and their strained relationship with superiors.  Norton's pranks are recounted in detail, including a particularly pungent elevator incident involving Opie, Anthony, and a businessman.  The death of Dimebag Darrell is discussed, followed by a critique of the Billboard Music Awards, specifically targeting Mick Mars and Vince Neil's performances.  Listener calls interrupt the flow, with one caller offering inert ammunition and another proposing a subscription model.  The hosts brainstorm ways to improve their listener base on premium satellite radio.  Highly offensive language, including misogynistic, homophobic, and racist remarks, is pervasive throughout this segment.  Extensive discussion of flatulence and bodily functions is also present.

The show continues with a listener's anecdote about flatulence, transitioning into a triumphant discussion of the O&A Army's successful hacking of the Tony Danza show's message board.  The hosts celebrate the army's use of inside jokes and pseudonyms like "Lil' Connor Peterson" and "Old Gravy Leg" as retaliation for the Danza show's treatment of their colleague, Eric.  The conversation shifts to XM radio advertising, including a humorous audio clip of a fictional "second annual male group orgy competition."  The NBA brawl, subsequent arrests, and media coverage are discussed, leading to anecdotes from a former Sirius Satellite Radio employee (Ben) about the company's lavish spending, including Pamela Anderson's private jet usage.  Ben also details the stressful work environment and a bizarre phone answering guide.  The hosts then mock comedian Rich Voss's angry message board posts, including insults directed at a user called "Kid Nigg." A caller's mistaken belief in winning $100,000 (instead of a candy bar) provides further comedic fodder.  The segment concludes with more XM Radio advertisements and jokes about the cluttered studio.

The next segment begins with a discussion of a limbless wrestler, followed by a countdown of the top 10 highest-earning deceased celebrities (Marilyn Monroe, Bob Marley, Tupac Shakur, Dale Earnhardt, Dr. Seuss, George Harrison, John Lennon, J.R.R. Tolkien, Charles Schulz, and Elvis Presley).  A story about obese cruise ship passengers breaking chairs leads to an argument between the hosts and staff member Steve about the studio's cleanliness and personal belongings.  Norton mentions his medications.  The conversation turns to risqué baby t-shirts with provocative slogans, becoming increasingly vulgar as they read examples.  A listener calls, upset about the hosts' discussion of Santa Claus in the presence of his three-year-old son, leading to further chaos.  Norton's coffee complaints trigger another digression, culminating in a song parody.  An attempt to discuss the New York Post's worst Christmas songs is repeatedly derailed by arguments and off-topic discussions.  The segment includes several overtly racist and offensive Christmas songs, frequently interrupted.  The segment concludes with a phone call to a Nevada establishment advertising sexual services, featuring a caller with Tourette's Syndrome making explicit requests.

A subsequent segment is punctuated by XM radio commercials promoting a Delphi XM MiFi contest.  The hosts discuss listener speculation about a past “12 Days of Guido Christmas” segment and field listener calls, including one about high cell phone bills and health risks.  A rambling and incoherent phone interview with Mike Tyson ensues, touching upon his arrest, cocaine use, past struggles, and spelling difficulties.  The discussion returns to offensive baby t-shirts and a graphic Canadian PSA on domestic violence.  A listener describes a midget attempting to pump gas with crutches, followed by a prank call tape.  The segment ends with a countdown of the "Boneheads of the Year," mentioning various celebrities and newsmakers.  Frequent profanity and sexually suggestive comments are prevalent throughout.

The final segment features a failed game identifying individuals in the news, using vulgar descriptions of their controversies (Charles Kushner, James McGreevy, Patrick Graeber/Gaber, and Roy Moore).  A caller suggests an unfunny shirt idea ("I'm with my mother's dead, rotting corpse").  The number one "bonehead" of the year is announced (name undisclosed), followed by more XM Satellite Radio advertisements.  The "What Did We Learn?" segment features callers' humorous observations.  The show concludes with a rambling, sexually explicit discussion about morning erections and closing remarks.  No in-studio guests are explicitly mentioned in this final segment.

[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  See, history is slapped against Opie and Anthony.  You've got a couple of great guides over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money.  Yay, man!  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, we've learned our lesson, we're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to need a passport.  Get your cock out.  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice. 
[00:08:00]  This is too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, violent women.  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  V-O-B-A-N-E show.  Shit, please fuck, come cuck, fuck a motherfucker in tits.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medication is that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Okay, go with me.  I hate this place. 
[00:08:30]  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I'm going to have you lie down over here.  I hate the place.  And then we'll get you for medication, okay?  The medications don't work.  I don't know, I don't even, I don't think everybody's loud. 
[00:09:00]  You, you, me while I whip this out.  AHHHHH!  AHHHHH!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  Well, the last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook. 
[00:09:30]  AHHHHH!  HAHAHAHAHA!  HAHAHAHAHA!  HAHAHAHAHA!  HAHAHAHAHA!  HAHAHAHAHA!  Oh, Lordy Lord, keep jumping!  Do what he says!  Do what he says!  Do what he says!  Do what he says!  I'm Bill O'Reilly, hope to see you again next time.  And remember, the spin stops here because we are looking out for you.  HAHAHA!  You dick!  Yes he is!  You dick!  No douche-a-bag!  Hey, good morning!  It's the only virus spreading across America. 
[00:10:00]  Hello.  A little tired this morning.  A little tired.  Are you?  You didn't sleep well?  Nah, my body clock decided to wake up at 2 in the morning, which is pretty much the middle  of the night.  You're low again?  Always, dude.  Always.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  Just doesn't seem to...  There we go.  That's just one of those things our listeners are gonna have to get used to.  Every day?  Now I have to crank my head.  How's that?  That's better.  I think right about there is good.  That's a good one.  This?  Or this?  No, not that. 
[00:10:30]  This?  Gotta be up there, yeah.  Or this?  No.  This?  No.  Yeah.  Right here?  Alright.  That's it.  Hey, Jimmy, what's up, buddy?  Hi, guys.  How's Jimmy Norton?  I'm so tired.  Jimmy Norton.  I might have gotten...  I tried to...  I made an hour and a half of sleep in the afternoon yesterday and then two hours last night  again.  Why the problem sleeping?  I don't know.  Maybe I'm doing my sets at 9.30 and my body clock...  I'm not eating bad at night.  I'm eating like a little chicken or something, but it's just...  I'm laying there, wide awake, miserable. 
[00:11:00]  This is the portion of the show where we all say how tired we are, but don't worry.  We'll give you a radio show.  You just bitch about our sleep habits.  Oh, my God.  I woke up at two o'clock and I couldn't get back to sleep.  So I've already been up for four hours.  What time did you start going to sleep?  Last night, 8.30.  8.30?  Yeah.  That's pretty much the time I was in bed.  Are you sure I'm fine with hours?  No, not really, because then it takes about an hour to get to sleep and then, you know,  whatever.  What a...  Ugh.  You know, whatever.  The old days are so much easier.  We have a trucker that also couldn't sleep last night. 
[00:11:30]  Hey, Jason, what's up?  Yeah, I'd like to say a big fuck you to you guys.  All last night I kept rolling around going, the internet is for porn.  It's working.  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  Fuck me up all night, hugging me.  Porn to porn, porn, porn.  Hey, I'd like to say you guys are great.  Yeah.  I've been listening to you since NEW.  Right on.  Hey, I called up a couple weeks ago about those WOW stickers. 
[00:12:00]  I still haven't gotten them yet.  I know.  They think I'm crazy down in Washington because I continue to bitch that our fans have not  gotten their WOW stickers.  Oh, not yet?  Okay.  No, so I got yelled at for, you know, sending emails and stuff.  But there's a lot of people that still haven't got their WOW stickers.  You can get a WOW sticker through opanthony.com.  But for some reason, they're taking forever to be sent out.  Wait, weren't they saying they want you to communicate with them through emails on everything?  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  And then you send the emails and they get mad at the emails.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they said with the WOW stickers, they said they had a bug in the system.  What happened is, the guy was putting the sticker in the envelope and folding it out  so he would lick it and then fold it out so it wouldn't stick.  So they would fall out in the mail.  Big bug in the system.  Put it in the fucking envelope and mail it.  Hey, how about this one, guys?  Yeah.  What about, uh, nobody works here.  I've been here for seven years and nobody works here.  All right, thank you. 
[00:13:00]  I've been fucking tired to remember the whole goddamn thing.  He's all bummed out.  He's all bummed out.  He's all bummed out.  There's Jason.  He's obviously a trucker.  Didn't work out well, his little gag that he wanted to do.  No, I told Washington, though, we have unbelievable interns.  These guys are unbelievable.  Yeah.  Let them do the whole WOW sticker thing.  I don't want to wait for them in Washington because they don't have enough people down  there to take care of our needs.  So let us send out the WOW stickers.  We know the job will be done.  It won't be one of these things where someone has ten things to do and eventually they'll 
[00:13:30]  get to the WOW stickers.  Right.  We have to be priority number one.  We got interns and they could spend an hour every day just stuffing the envelopes with  the WOW stickers and getting them out there.  I'm getting them out there.  It's still a problem.  Look how thrilled they look at that prospect, Opie.  They don't care.  They're happy to be here, man.  Happy to be here.  But, you know, whatever, man.  Whatever.  You're going to throw something, Opie?  No, because I solved the problem for them.  I'm like, look, obviously you guys have too much going on down in Washington. 
[00:14:00]  We need to be a priority because we will be on top of the radio world again.  And we can't wait for you guys, you know?  Maybe it could be discussed.  We'll hire our own people here in New York or let the interns do it.  Maybe it could be discussed in our meeting today.  Ooh.  We have a live meeting today, don't we?  Yeah, we have a live meeting today after the show.  But, I mean, whatever.  The meeting should be good, though.  Oh, yeah.  You going to sit in on it, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  And don't we have dinner?  Yes, then dinner with Elo.  Dinner with Elo.  Oh, boy, I can't wait.  It's going to be a corporate day for the boys.  Live meetings, live dinners.  I had to get a room.  Face-to-face crap.  I had to get a room in town now.  I had to stay in town.  You know, we almost didn't go to XM Satellite Radio.  Both companies want us really bad.  It's, you know, and we picked a better company.  Simple as that.  I mean, we bitch here and there, but this is nothing compared to the nightmare that  would be if we went to the little doggy company.  But one thing I remember when we were like weighing all the options, you kind of weigh 
[00:15:00]  the positives and the negatives.  Sure.  We weren't too happy that we would be away from the mothership up here.  The mothership is in Washington.  Their facility is insane.  Yeah.  It's insane.  And then we got this really nice studio here in New York, some office space.  But we're pretty much flying solo.  We're alone.  We have communique with the cell phones.  That's about it.  But occasionally some of the big wigs come up, but it's very rare.  And the little doggy company, they have their big facility here in New York. 
[00:15:30]  And we thought, you know, it might be cool to go to work at the big facility every day.  But now I'm thinking we made the right decision.  Absolutely.  As far as that goes as well, because I don't want to see these people face to face.  Could you imagine every day there would be a meeting?  There would be meetings every single day with these people in their offices, in conference  rooms, all those horrible places that are just awful and boring to sit in.  Oof.  Thank God we're here in New York. 
[00:16:00]  Alright, so...  Guy would come in and go, alright guys, we're going to have a meeting today.  We're going to change the name of the channel.  It's no longer High Voltage.  We're going to call it Premium Content.  We're going to call it Premium Content.  You know what?  I've got to start calling the guys out in Washington.  Every day we should have a list of things we asked for that still hasn't been done.  How are you going to make a list?  There's no office computer to type it up on.  I think they're setting up the computers, aren't they?  Yeah, computers came in.  Not really?  Computers came in yesterday.  Oh, cool.  Alright. 
[00:16:30]  I'm very excited.  I've got an Alienware computer.  That is perfect for gaming.  I don't know.  I thought it would be nice to have an office before we started at XM Satellite Radio.  That would have been nice.  That was two and a half months ago I think we're up to, or close to it.  They're getting it done.  It just takes a while.  Everything takes a while.  You have corporate stuff.  I want to take a lot of that stuff out of their hands.  I will send out the WOW stickers myself.  I just want them out there.  Really?  Yes.  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Opie's house.  The maid can get the mail.  Do we have WOW stickers here? 
[00:17:00]  Alright.  You know what?  I'm not even fucking waiting for a meeting.  What's the address?  If you want a WOW sticker and you're sick of Washington...  Your address?  No.  The address here.  East 39th Street.  Opie's address?  No.  111 West 57th.  Alright.  If you want a WOW sticker, I can't wait for Washington anymore.  If you want a WOW sticker, self-addressed stamped envelope to the Opie and Anthony Show.  111 West 57th Street.  Sweet 500.  New York, New York.  10019.  Say that again.  The whole address again.  111 West 57th. 
[00:17:30]  Sweet 500.  New York, New York.  10019.  Steve will put it up too.  Alright.  And attention WOW stickers.  We're going to start sending them out ourselves.  But just send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  It makes it just easy for us to do it, okay?  And we'll send you more than one.  For some reason, they only give one per request.  We'll send you one out.  We used to like put, yeah, a few in an envelope and...  Well, we...  Earl.  When Earl...  Why don't we get Earl?  We can hire Earl.  He's out of work, isn't he?  Watch how many envelopes we get in the first week. 
[00:18:00]  And watch how fast they go out in the mail.  The guy's going to be griping downstairs.  The drunk at the desk.  Tough.  Mail bags coming in.  We can't have big bags of mail coming in.  Wow.  Yeah, that's what happened at the old place, remember?  Yeah.  It was like fan mail, but it was all WOW sticker requests.  They just wanted WOW stickers.  I felt like the monkeys.  All of a sudden, they're spilling their fan mail out on the table and taking a look.  Now it was all for WOW stickers.  Oh, wonderful.  Alright, well, after the show yesterday, Anthony and I...  Oh. 
[00:18:30]  Got caught up in one of Jim Norton's gags.  His little gags that he pulls.  Jim Norton has gags all day long, you know.  He plays a game when someone new comes into the studio.  He always goes, oh, dude, dude, dude, as they're leaving.  As they're leaving, they turn around and look and see what Jimmy wanted.  And Jimmy's just reading the paper.  Yeah, no one's looking.  Talking to us.  No one's looking at the person.  They completely get the mail.  The guy looks all uncomfortable.  It's really funny to do to friends and stuff.  So if you're at home, you could pull that gag yourself.  Just turn to a loved one and say their name and then turn your head back around real quick. 
[00:19:00]  And they look around and wonder who was calling them and why.  You never acknowledge them.  They feel very embarrassed.  The other thing is you drop something down the sidewalk, which is one of my personal favorites.  When we're all walking down the sidewalk, especially in New York, just a lot of people, somebody maybe coming toward you walking the other way.  Right when they get kind of next to you, you go, you drop something and then turn your head.  And you just watch these people stop, turn around, start looking at the ground, looking for the person that said it so they can maybe get more information on what they dropped and where. 
[00:19:30]  And they just keep looking around.  And it's the funniest goddamn thing.  I got to interrupt you real quick with that.  The master at that is Florentine.  I'm still second to that.  Really?  Because Club Soda Kenny's good at it?  He is.  Kenny's just loud and he stares at you.  He doesn't care if you know it's him.  You drop something!  And then he's just a big goon staring at you.  One of the funniest ones ever was my friend Tom Nemec said years ago he was home sitting on his porch and his friend was on the side of the porch.  And this big fat lady walked by and the guy goes to the side of the house and yells, 
[00:20:00]  Hey, fat back!  And then hides.  And then Tom is just sitting on the porch alone.  Hey, fat back!  Very embarrassing.  Oh, that's classic.  That's classic.  What is another one?  You drop something, then there's a...  Is this yours?  Excuse me, miss.  Excuse me, miss.  Or excuse me, sir.  That's a good one.  Excuse me, sir.  And then you turn your head around.  You keep walking.  And they're just looking around like, who wants my assistance? 
[00:20:30]  Well, the key is you don't make eye contact.  No, you never make eye contact.  When you do these gags.  Well, he does the elevator thing and that's the one I was getting to today.  Oh, awful.  See, every day around 10.30, quarter 11, when we leave the joint, we all have to get in the elevator to go back downstairs.  And it's gotten to the point where Anthony and I try to leave without Norton.  We can't leave.  We try to get the hell out of here without Norton because every elevator ride is an experience.  And a horror show, actually.  It's only a couple of floors, but it seems to take forever when Jimmy's on the elevator with you. 
[00:21:00]  It gets to the point where Anthony and I will get in the elevator.  There's always three or four business people in there.  Yep.  And Anthony and I will just go into a corner, turn all the way around, just be staring in the corner.  I put my head in the corner and just imagine I'm somewhere else until I hear the ding of the lobby.  And that doesn't bother Norton.  He starts rubbing your back going, it's okay, baby.  It'll be all right, baby.  Yeah.  There's this.  We'll work this out, baby.  There's businessmen on the elevator.  Don't worry.  It's good.  It's okay.  It's okay. 
[00:21:30]  I know you're upset.  Rubbing Opie's back and Opie's wearing a jacket.  So you can hear like the .  Like if you're rubbing kind of a water resistant type of jacket or something, you just hear  Norton's hand going .  It's okay, baby.  It's okay, baby.  We'll work this out.  We'll work this out.  It's okay, baby.  And the people, it's so embarrassing.  Oh, it's awful.  People just looking and wondering and you're just embarrassed. 
[00:22:00]  I'm sorry I cheated on you.  Got the sound?  Yeah.  There it is.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I cheated on you.  It's like, oh.  We'll work things out, baby.  It's okay.  And the whole ride down, he doesn't stop.  It's the longest elevator ride known to man.  And then other times, he gets in the elevator.  The door's shut.  There's somebody else in there.  And he'll start going, yeah, the test came back.  You know, I'm positive, but I feel good about it.  You know, AIDS isn't really a death sentence anymore.  And he's just talking loud right to you. 
[00:22:30]  And I'm not telling her.  I love doing that one.  Like, yeah, I tested positive, but I'm not telling her.  I'm not telling her.  Screw her, man, you know.  And it's so, and I turn around like he's, no, he's not talking to me.  I don't know who he's talking to.  But then he'll tap you on the shoulder and go, oh, and then besides, you can't get away from it.  So yesterday, I haven't laughed that hard.  I don't know.  Oh.  Maybe ever.  Another embarrassing moment.  So when the elevators open, the elevators open up, Anthony and I always pray for an empty elevator. 
[00:23:00]  Like, please, please, please, please be empty.  Please be empty.  Please be empty.  And it was empty.  You're like, ah.  And he wasn't, you weren't leaving with us, right?  You had something to do.  I had to come back in.  Yeah, I did.  But Norton's near the elevators.  I'm like, all right, what is he going to do?  Because I know he's not leaving.  So Anthony and I get into the empty elevator and at the last second, he steps in and lets  loose the most horrendous fart I've ever smelled in my life.  It was horrific.  Rotten eggs.  You know the deal.  That felt bad.  It was a precision-guided fart because right when the doors are shutting. 
[00:23:30]  Ammonia, rotting eggs.  Right when the doors are shutting, his pudgy ass gets stuck in right as the door is shutting  and you just hear, and then he pulls his ass out right in time for the doors to slam  shut.  So now we're stuck.  And now we're stuck in a stinky elevator.  And to my utter and complete horror, I feel the deceleration of the elevator.  I see the fourth floor ding and see the light stop and forth. 
[00:24:00]  You guys got to understand that it's the worst smell.  I have no exaggeration.  The whole elevator stinks to holy hell.  And now the door opens.  Opens on the fourth floor.  And here's a businessman standing there.  Now, I have my scarf pulled in front of my mouth and I'm laughing hysterical.  And Opie is also just laughing.  We're disgusted, but you can't write it off.  We're laughing like two idiots.  It's too goddamn funny.  So the guy steps on and Opie instantly starts making excuses. 
[00:24:30]  Dude, dude, it wasn't us.  It wasn't us.  The guy who's totally straight-faced looks at me, looks at Opie, catches the whiff.  He actually stepped into the elevator.  Yeah, he stepped in.  Catches the whiff.  The smell, realized how horrendous it was, turned 180 degrees and walked out of the elevator.  Walked out of the elevator.  We are dying laughing.  Dude, I fell on the floor after the doors closed again.  I'm now on the floor laughing so hard, even though it's such an awful, awful smell. 
[00:25:00]  The worst thing was Opie just making excuses the second that door opened.  We're laughing.  He's like, dude, dude, it wasn't us.  It wasn't us.  The guy didn't ask?  Yeah.  He probably hadn't even smelt it yet.  Yeah.  Then right when he walked in, he was just, oh.  Then when we got off at the lobby floor, we start walking out and two really hot girls  start walking toward the elevator.  So what do we do?  We run away.  We started running so they wouldn't get the smell and then look back and see it was us getting off.  When I got her hat on, I threw it over my eyes. 
[00:25:30]  I didn't even know where I was running.  I was just running by feel because I'm like, I don't want them to see my face when they  smell what they're about to smell.  You really stunk?  It was a fantastically placed fart.  It was one of your top fives, yes.  And it just really was bad.  It was definitely one of your top fives.  Some type of rancid, fishy meat.  It was really bad, Jimmy.  Rotten eggs and ammonia.  Obe called me as soon as you guys got off the elevator and it just made my week.  It was executed perfectly.  I hated being a victim of it, but I was really laughing. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Really fast.  Congrats.  Awful smell, though, last night.  I got to say these cabbies just have to and it'll never happen.  They're just animals.  New York City cab drivers are animals.  They are not even human fucking beings.  Awful.  Awful.  I got in a cab yesterday and...  Was that after our Bravo taping?  After our Bravo taping.  Ooh.  Yeah.  We sat in front of the Bravo TV cameras for like two hours, I think. 
[00:26:30]  It was a long time.  Two hours.  What'd you do?  Talking about superheroes and supervillains and supervillains.  Supervixens.  Supervixens.  Right, right.  We'll talk about that a little.  But I get into the cab and I notice it wasn't cold yesterday, but it was by no means one  of those roll the windows down, have the taxi rushing through traffic as the wind hits,  you know, you get a little cold.  And I'm wondering, hmm, why are the windows down in this cab? 
[00:27:00]  Who the hell was in here before me that loves the cold?  So I put the windows back up.  Within three seconds, this animal that's sitting in the front that I can't imagine the last  time he bathed, the smell of cabbie ass.  Was he wearing a towel as a hat?  No, no towel as a hat.  Oh, okay.  It was a standard issue black guy.  Wasn't an Egyptian or anything. 
[00:27:30]  But all of them.  I don't care.  The black cabbies usually don't smell though.  Unless they're African or West African.  Stop.  This guy, yeah, I think he was from maybe the West Indies, he was from Haiti, wherever,  somewhere where they don't bathe.  This guy, the smell.  It's usually the guys that have the names without any vowels.  Those are the ones that smell the worst.  Well, no, I'm putting them all under the same blanket of just animals.  Stinky zoo animals because, do you want to sit there and pay? 
[00:28:00]  I was paying to smell a man's ass.  It was just that unwashed ass.  You know, he's just sitting, sweating in that front seat on those beads that they sit on.  And just stinking the cab up.  So now you sit there and I, again, roll the window back down because now I'll be cold.  And had to put my hand over my mouth and nose to like, you'd rather smell your own digits anything than ass. 
[00:28:30]  And the traffic because it's the holidays and people decide this is a great place to go.  Not, ah, ah, ah, never mind.  Millions of people are trying to work on a daily basis.  We'll come here and just screw up traffic because I want to go to Tiffany's.  And so now you're sitting in traffic just smelling an animal's ass and paying good money for it.  Disgusting.  Take a bath, you slobs.  Soak that thing in Epsom salt. 
[00:29:00]  That rancid hole.  Get some baby wipes.  Get baby wipes.  That disgusting...  A new campaign.  Bung.  Baby wipes for the cab drivers.  Ah, do it.  I'll donate.  Well, let's go to the phone and say hi to Russ in Cleveland.  Big story in Ohio today.  Yes, Russ?  I just wanted to give an on air fuck you to the guy that killed Dimebag Darryl from Pantera.  Yeah, that's a fucked up story.  Is Dimebag dead?  Yeah, he's dead.  I love that the news has to say Dimebag.  I was listening to 1010 wins. 
[00:29:30]  And Dimebag was killed.  Dimebag.  But Bobzilla survived the shooting.  They have to say things like Dimebag and Bobzilla.  Bobzilla.  Hey, did they shoot anybody else in the band or was it just Dimebag?  I think it was Dimebag.  I think it was Dimebag.  It looks like it was a hit, huh?  Yeah, they said there might be one other band member, but they're not releasing it.  Really?  Yeah, that was crazy.  I guess some...  What was the name of the band?  Because it wasn't Pantera.  Damage Plan.  Damage Plan, right.  Damage Plan was playing in Columbus, Ohio. 
[00:30:00]  And they just started and all of a sudden a kid, seems like a kid, maybe in his early  20s, mid 20s, had a sweatshirt on and a hood.  Yeah.  And went right on stage and emptied, what, five bullets into Dimebag?  Yeah.  Shot him five times in the chest.  And then turned the gun on the crowd and shot a few more people.  He got tackled by...  Martini Steve in the studio looking extra flamey today.  Blue flames, I kind of like that. 
[00:30:30]  Thank you.  Red, white, and blue flag.  It's a new flame shirt.  With the hot chick.  Yeah.  Well, the trucker, the trucker mud flap.  Yep.  Naked.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a 22-year-old kid.  He jumped on stage, emptied five rounds into Dimebag's chest.  And then he got tackled by security.  The cop showed up and shot the kid.  Good.  All right.  I wonder if he was an obsessed fan like Chapman or if he hated him.  They haven't released that yet, but Daryl was the only guy in the band that got shot. 
[00:31:00]  There's going to be a story that comes out, obviously.  I bet you was just some crazy obsessed fan.  Nah, I think...  Nah.  He probably had some...  Why else would you shoot the crowd?  Got a clip of somebody who was recording the band playing and got a clip of that song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  Try me hit me up all night, hugging me, horn to porn.  Yeah.  And then...  Well, Liquid Metal is in mourning today, so I'm sure they have the latest facts on this 
[00:31:30]  breaking story, Liquid Metal.  What channel is that on XM?  42.  42.  The singer, Patrick Latchman, is a singer.  He was at Florentine's birthday party.  Really?  Yeah, he's a cool dude.  He went up with Sabra Cadabra.  He was singing Sabbath songs.  He's the greatest.  Wow.  We've talked to Pantera many times.  We've talked to Dimebag many times in our careers.  Dimebag.  All right, Russ.  That's it.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Jeez.  Liquid Metal did a...  They broke into programming? 
[00:32:00]  Is that what I hear?  Yeah, they've been on the air.  Ward Cleaver and one other guy at Liquid Metal.  Ward Cleaver.  Yeah, that's his name.  I know his business cards say Ward Cleaver.  I don't care.  Ward Cleaver.  I love it.  They got on the air at 4 o'clock the second they heard and started broadcasting, and they'll  be sticking with it all day until they actually find out what happened.  Like Cronkite when Kennedy was shot.  Dude, this is when they just have to get there.  And, you know, it's their news story.  It's their responsibility to that community. 
[00:32:30]  This is when metal guys shine.  This is, you know, when anyone in the inkling of intelligence in the metal community gets  up and just starts talking.  Because, you know, when the great white thing happened, they all went nuts.  They just could have used video clips, by the way, from the great white fire in Rhode Island.  Because it was, from what I saw on the news, the club looked the same.  The people being interviewed looked exactly the same.  And I care just as much.  Dimebag was cool, man.  Dimebag was one of the cool things.  It was really cool. 
[00:33:00]  I'll give that Dimebag was cool.  We interviewed him a bunch of times.  We interviewed him at the Worcester Centrum when Anal C was performing and opening up for  Pantara.  And now, everyone, Anal C.  The Anal C.  The Anal C.  The Anal C.  Very hurt.  But they don't say C.  Nickelbag got shot last night.  What?  Dime?  What's his name?  Dimebag.  Nick?  Nick Oldbag?  No, Dimebag, Larry.  Dimebag. 
[00:33:30]  You try to be hip with the kids, you've got to know the names of these guys.  Dimebag, were you upset that Bobzilla got more famous than you?  No.  Now, everyone, back for a little soiree.  It's Dimebag and Bobzilla and Pantara Pantyhose.  Damage plan.  Damn.  What?  It's a little sideband he was doing.  I don't know anything about these guys.  Where's Nick Mars? 
[00:34:00]  I saw him on the Billboard Awards last night.  He looked like a walking question mark.  Poor guy, man.  That poor son of a bitch.  I was watching the Billboard Awards last night.  Award shows stink on ice.  I just can't take them, but I can't tune away because there's nothing else on television.  TV really blows.  I'm watching the Billboard Awards.  Put it this way.  The most entertaining thing of the Billboard Awards is some jack-off set designer decided to bring all the personalities through a tunnel that was elevated off the stage about six inches or so. 
[00:34:30]  At the end of the tunnel is a step-off.  The whole thing's black, and the stage is black, so it kind of blended in to the stage.  So almost everyone walking through the tunnel tripped as they came off of this thing.  I'm sure the set designer caught hell for it.  But all night long, I'm just watching going, come on, fall, fall, fall.  And people would walk, and whoop. 
[00:35:00]  They'd do that thing where you don't know there's a step as you're walking.  And it hits you, and you almost pull your leg out of the socket.  That's what everyone was doing last night.  The most entertaining part of the show.  Until Motley Crue came out, and Mick Mars, you know, Steve was saying how bad it is.  He's got this degenerative bone disease, and he had hip replacement surgery.  His back also must be screwed up.  He looks like, you know, the cliche thing to say is the Crypt Keeper, but he does. 
[00:35:30]  Looks like that.  And he can't stand up straight.  How is he going to tour with these guys?  That's what I was thinking.  I have no idea.  He was hunched over where it looked like he was looking to see if the rest of the band  was dropping any of their money so he could maybe pick it up.  He was walking, staring at the floor.  It was horrible.  And then Vince comes out and starts trying to read the teleprompter with Tara Reid,  and he couldn't see it.  He's there complaining that he didn't have his glasses with him to read. 
[00:36:00]  Motley Crue.  It's Motley Crue.  Motley Crue now needs reading glasses?  Yeah.  Needs reading glasses.  One of them's hunched over like a Quasimodo.  It was embarrassing.  Tommy Lee trying to, like, sound hip.  You know, it's one thing.  You could be, you know, playing the part.  Yeah, Tommy Lee, man.  You know, yeah, we're going to rock with Motley Crue.  It's great when you're alone in your place, you know, and you have your room with a stripper pole, 
[00:36:30]  and you're partying with, you know, Snoop or something.  But when you're hanging out with these guys that are falling apart, it's a little much.  You can't really pull off the rocker thing when you look next to you, and there's some old guy.  You know, it was one step away from him pulling up on a little rascal scooter.  Yeah, Motley Crue's a little rascal on our little rascals.  Well, we have the audio.  Oh, good.  And the reason it takes so long after the introduction is because they're waiting for, what's his name there, to get on stage. 
[00:37:00]  They're waiting for Mick Mars to walk out on stage.  This is what took so long.  I'm sorry, he has cancer in the neck.  He's had it for years.  No, I know.  Oh.  Wow.  I hear Neil Peart's got that, too, man.  He's dying.  And you've got to listen to Tara Reid's voice in this.  Oh, Tara Reid, you know, stop with the booze and the cigarettes all the time, Tara.  It used to sound sexy.  Now it's kind of sounding, starting to sound manly.  You know that young girl raspy voice thing? 
[00:37:30]  It's very hot.  I remember a couple of girls in high school had that kind of raspy voice, and it's really sexy.  When you start getting a little older, it's not sexy anymore.  It's Lucille Ball.  You know, when me and Viv, when me and Viv would go out.  She'd be on The Tonight Show.  Ah, Johnny.  When, you know, me and Desi would hang out at the Copa. 
[00:38:00]  That's when they would go on Johnny with their cigarettes and their scotch.  Yeah.  The good old days.  Not sexy.  All right, here's the clip.  Oh, Mr. Mooney.  Please welcome back Molly Crane.  Now they're walking.  Yep.  They're walking.  They're walking.  They're almost there.  They're walking.  Old graham cracker spine. 
[00:38:30]  Walking.  Working his way up to the stage.  Walking.  They're almost there.  Here they are.  Finally.  At the podium.  No?  Nope.  They're still walking.  That's nice.  Mick Mars looking like he's trying to give himself a BJ.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh.  That's awesome.  Old chalk femur.  Oh, geez.  Tara.  Do you know how much you have in common with us?  With Motley Crue? 
[00:39:00]  How much?  Just way too much.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love when these stars try to improvise.  It just shows that they just don't have any talent whatsoever.  They have nothing.  I think these award shows should just throw these celebrities out there now with no cue cards,  no teleprompts, and just let them just make fools of themselves.  The old age home.  Bounce.  Tonight.  Tonight.  I love it.  Let me guess.  I have blonde hair and blue eyes.  Oh, geez. 
[00:39:30]  Well, you know what?  Oh, geez.  It's way over there.  Hey, you know what?  You're not number one.  Tell you you're number one on billboard.  Billboard.  I swear to God, I cannot read this because I don't have my glasses on.  Oh, Jesus.  How screwed up is that?  Tara, help me, please, baby.  All right.  Regardless of whatever format.  Just keep going, honey.  She's just drunk with her big kids.  Just keep reading.  He's right, guys.  I just want to keep holding you.  Come on.  Just keep on it. 
[00:40:00]  Regardless of whatever format it is today, they have more to tell you.  Oh, I can't read it.  So you can't either.  Tommy, you read it.  Okay.  Yeah.  He can read it.  Okay.  Follow the big clock and read along with Tommy.  They found a reader, everyone.  Yeah.  Had a reader in the group.  Thank God they found a reader.  Is Tommy back to white guy lingo now?  Yeah, I think he's back to being a white gentleman.  Oh, for a while, man.  He was like that.  Yo, dog.  He was hanging out with the rappers. 
[00:40:30]  He put out his rap album.  That didn't wash.  So he's back to being a white guy, Tommy.  He put out a rap album?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because it was the thing to do.  All right.  Rap metal kind of, right?  Yeah.  He was playing drums.  Oh, yeah.  I'm Tommy Lee, and I'm a fool.  I'm fishing little children out of my pool.  You know, just singing about what he knows.  Tommy Lee, I don't mean to get crazy, but that boy drowned because I wasn't watching him 
[00:41:00]  because I'm lazy.  Oh, man.  You had too many words to get around.  I know.  I almost said because I'm lazy, but I forgot the boy drowned, so I had to toss a little  floating tot in there last minute.  As I was saying that, I realized it was way too wordy.  Yeah, a little wordy.  You got the point.  That's all right.  Sure.  Yeah.  Whatever.  You murderer by proxy.  You guys want to say hi to Oklahoma City today? 
[00:41:30]  You bet we do.  What's up?  What do you got for the show today?  What's going on, guys?  My son's over in Iraq right now in Fallujah.  He's a crew chief on a Black Hawk chopper.  Nice.  He was curious to see if Anthony wanted some inert .50 caliber bullets.  Oh.  Since Anthony's into that machine gun stuff and all that.  Gack, gack, gack.  And he's got their inert.  You know, it's just more or less metal. 
[00:42:00]  There's no gunpowder in them or anything.  Right.  And he was curious if he wanted those.  And he said he could probably get you an inert law rocket.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  Like anti-tank weapon.  I don't know if Anthony could drive around Manhattan with that.  Well, I don't know.  All it is is just the tube.  It folds open.  Yeah, that could be a little dangerous to have, but I would love to have it.  But, I mean, you know, there's no shell in it or anything like that.  When you get it, give us a call.  We'll have you come down.  Okay, can I say something real quick to Jimmy? 
[00:42:30]  I don't think so, sir.  I don't think it'll work.  Hey, Jimmy, thanks for going to Iraq, man.  You rock, dude.  Oh, please.  I'm very happy to do it, man.  And my son wanted to know he was going to give you a helmet because he saw you when you  were there.  But he wasn't sure if he had to pull the helmet liner out or not.  Why?  My little fat head?  I suck.  All right.  I'll give you the pink helmet.  There he goes.  But thank you, sir.  Chaz.  What's up, Chaz?  Yeah, hey. 
[00:43:00]  Hey.  Listen, guys.  You're going to meet with the big wigs today?  Well, no.  Not really.  Okay.  Well, anyway, I am a real-life stockholder, okay?  Well, actually, we are going to meet with...  Yeah, we're going to meet with Elo.  He's one of the big wigs there.  When did you get in?  What price was XM at when you got in, sir?  $16.  $16.  So you're doing very well.  Yes, I am.  However, that's not why I called to brag about that.  But the thing is, I don't understand this whole approach, and I don't think they do,  because actually...  Stockholders meeting we're having right now, Alby. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, that's okay.  I want to hear what this guy has to say.  Let's hear from the stockholders.  Go ahead, Chaz.  Okay, here's a suggestion.  There's no reason why you guys have to try to pull the whole load of XM.  You should be allowed to...  where people could subscribe just to your program,  and therefore, you'd have a fair shot.  And then you should go promote around the whole country, and...  Wait, sir, can I ask you a question?  What does that mean, promote?  What's that word mean?  Yeah, we don't know what that means.  I've heard of it, but I'm not sure what it is.  Well, to promote now is a very difficult thing to do, 
[00:44:00]  because in order for people to get your show,  they have to subscribe to the whole XM itinerary.  Oh, you're saying that they should be able to have a radio, subscribe,  and just get our show?  Exactly.  That's a little odd.  No, it's not.  After all, I'm a stockholder, and I would support such a plan.  I think the worst move they've made with us is throwing us on a premium channel.  I think it's completely ridiculous.  Yeah, I think we should just be on free across the board.  But I see what this guy's saying, but you know what it is? 
[00:44:30]  It's not very cost-effective, sir.  I think if you just pay $2 to get us, the cost to have somebody activated,  it just winds up costing more than $2, so it wouldn't work out financially.  We like being on XM.  We don't want to be away from the platform.  We like being on XM.  See, you know, we like to be cocky and think that everyone knows who we are.  The fact is, especially the West Coast, they don't know who Opie and Anthony are at all.  On the East Coast, we do pretty well.  And so to throw us on a premium channel and just assume that people are going to take a chance 
[00:45:00]  to listen to this program, thank God we're doing the free play this week, obviously,  because it is turning a lot of people on to our radio show.  But, I mean, the odds of someone just going,  oh, Opie and Anthony, all right, I'll try it.  It just logically doesn't make sense.  If we were much bigger in the radio world, of course it would make sense, you know?  We're just not known enough to be on a premium channel.  But it's just an idea.  If you think about it, it does make sense,  because it just makes sense to allow people to subscribe just to your premium channel. 
[00:45:30]  This is what the stockholder meetings are like.  Guys like this.  You have a base out there.  Yeah, they're babbling like an idiot.  They all feel like they have a stupid idea.  They would immediately be able to tune you in for just $2 a month.  And they babble with this.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Chaz.  With the thing, though, but what about them being on their own channel, though?  Is that a problem?  I'm saying I don't think it would be. 
[00:46:00]  It should be addressed.  I mean, give it some thought.  All right.  Thank you, Chaz.  I want to know if they were on their own channel, how would they do it?  Shut up, Jim.  I want to know.  Because with satellite, you can select whatever.  They can control whatever channels they want you to hear or not hear.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  But would they still be a part of the channel?  Shut up!  Hey!  Would they still be a part of the platform?  Where are my poker chips?  They would.  You'd still be part of the platform.  How could they be a part of the platform?  Chaz, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Because I'm saying this. 
[00:46:30]  If someone subscribes only to you, how are you still a part of the platform?  That's what I don't understand.  If they have your own...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Not only would you be part of the platform...  Quiet.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  They could use you to promote the rest of your programming.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Chaz.  Yeah.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Anyway...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  If you're thinking about it...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[00:47:00]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Anyway, you know, you guys are great, and I think you deserve a better chance of getting to  your face that I have to drag the whole...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Yeah, okay.  Stop whining.  Thank you, J.  You might call.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Quiet.  By the way, that was not Chaz.  That was Hugh Pinero, everyone.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions, and I want to have them answered immediately.  Yeah, exactly.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  My God!  I just had a couple questions for him. 
[00:47:30]  Yes, you did.  Yeah, thanks.  Idiot.  Thanks, Norton.  Oh, the guy's talking like, you know, why not call up the cable company and go, I just  want HBO.  I don't want anything else.  That's been a battle for years, is the pick and choose.  People want to pick and choose their own programs, and companies, even the cable companies,  have packages that they give you.  That's just the way it is.  You get the whole package.  But anyway, we're dealing with the free play thing, and it's working for us, so...  Yeah.  I read so many instant feedbacks today, this morning, when I popped on, that were from 
[00:48:00]  people that had never heard us, and now love the show, and they're subscribing.  It's amazing what this free play is done.  I don't know why we didn't do it sooner.  But we just should be available.  We should be.  Because this is one of those shows, you just kind of stumble across it, and you get interested  in it.  Yeah.  Our names are not big enough to be hidden on a premium channel.  It's one of those things where you can't just say, oh, Opie and Anthony, I don't know  who they are, but I'm going to subscribe to it. 
[00:48:30]  It doesn't work that way.  But we're confident enough to know that if people hear us, they're going to listen.  And they're going to like the show, and they know what happens, and they tell their friends  who don't have XM Satellite Radio, guess what?  They're getting XM Satellite Radio now because of us.  That's how it works.  You can't just advertise on the platform to people who already have XM.  Yeah.  Right.  Anyway.  Sometimes you stumble onto a show that you don't like, and you listen to it anyway, that  you can't do that when you've got to just pick it up.  Because there was one show, I'm not going to mention the name, that I was driving home  one night listening to it, and it was god-awful. 
[00:49:00]  It was a talk show.  And I could not listen to it.  Every time I drove home, I would listen to it, even though I hated it because it was  awful.  People get hooked on a show that way, too, where they hate it.  Come on!  Yeah.  All right.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Free Play all week long on XM 202.  To continue to receive Channel 202 on your XM radio, you'll need to add Opie and Anthony  to your XM account.  Call 1-800-XM radio or subscribe online.  That's funny.  We have to chill ourselves for listeners.  Vince Neil sounded like Saul Rosenberg. 
[00:49:30]  That is very funny.  Henchman from Brooklyn.  I wanted to read the teleprompter, but I don't have my glasses, goddammit.  I can't see, Tara Reid.  Help me.  Look at Mick.  He's very injured from years of drug abuse and neglect.  Very injured.  He was hurt.  His back is bowed over.  It's disgusting.  He looks like he's trying to suck his own wiener.  And I can't see, goddammit, Tommy Lee's penis. 
[00:50:00]  I can't even see it, and it's giant.  Very, very jealous of him.  Oh, that's very funny.  We're getting bit requests, Anthony.  You know what?  Maybe we should do an hour of listeners requesting some of the things we play in this show to  maybe convince the people that are listening for free this week that they should subscribe  to the channel.  It's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Jeff from Wisconsin.  He wants to hear Duck Job so he can record it onto his MiFi. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, there you go.  All right.  You're not going to let the inmates run the asylum, are you?  Here's Duck Job.  Everyone has to be quiet so Jeff can get a clean copy of this.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Play with my boys.  Play with my boys.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around.  They're so good.  Oh, my God.  I love it with you.  Uh-oh.  Slow down.  Yeah, I got to get some more coffee.  Yeah.  What?  Move.  I'll go get you a towel.  You guys just wrecked it.  What?  I want to get coffee.  You guys right here.  You just wrecked it.  The guy was trying to tape that.  Did you get it? 
[00:51:30]  Did you get it?  See?  We aimed to please.  Did you get it?  What a douchebag.  We're such asses.  Now I'm playing it again.  Now everyone just shut up.  All right, please.  Jeff wants a clean copy of this for his MiFi.  All right, cool.  It's not going to be that old gag.  This time we're going to let it play, okay?  All right, here's the duck job.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Play with my balls.  Play with my balls.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around.  They're so good.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  We do.  Uh-oh.  Slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel.  There you go.  One of our favorites, the duck job, Anthony. 
[00:52:30]  We don't need a break, do we?  Let's just keep going here.  Let's say hi to Young Buck in Florida.  What's up, Young Buck?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to let y'all know, man, y'all were talking about trying to get listeners  to sign up with that preview thing.  Yeah.  Y'all don't need to do anything special, man.  Y'all are fucking hilarious regardless.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  We kind of feel like we have to sell ourselves this week, but thank you.  I appreciate it.  Well, I don't got to do nothing, man.  I just signed up, and I was actually wondering how I'd be able to get my hand on a bunch 
[00:53:00]  of stickers and do a sticker stop in West Memphis, Arkansas.  West Memphis.  West Memphis, Arkansas.  This is how we're going to get the name out from the show.  A sticker stop in...  I didn't even know that town existed.  Sure.  West Memphis, Arkansas?  Yeah, it's actually kind of like an extension of Memphis, Tennessee.  It's kind of easy.  But it's West, and it's in Arkansas.  Yeah.  It's right across the Mississippi River. 
[00:53:30]  Memphis.  All right.  Well, how does this guy get wow stickers so he can do his own wow sticker stop?  He'll email us here, or send in a thing here.  All right.  We'll put you on hold, and someone will take care of you, all right?  Let's say hi to Jim in Boston.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I called on Tuesday morning, and I was trying to debate whether or not to spend the two  bucks, wanting to know if the show was still the same, and your kind, kind words were enough  to get me to say, all right, you guys are still there.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Welcome back to my morning radio.  Hey, I'm not a stockholder, but if you just want to hear Anthony, maybe you could pay a dollar. 
[00:54:00]  And if you just want to hear Opie, you can go to, like, 201 and just pay a dollar.  Is that your suggestion?  No, just fuck it off in the morning.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  You're still a tool.  I was giving suggestions.  Like, have them on two different channels, and if you pay two, you get them both together.  Right.  And if you just pay a dollar, you'll just hear what I'm saying.  Yeah, but, sir, that wouldn't work, because the show wouldn't be as funny without both  voices.  You'd hear Opie. 
[00:54:30]  You wouldn't understand what the response was.  And how much extra would we have to pay for little Jimmy Norton?  Nothing.  I just kind of bleed through on each channel.  On each channel?  Yeah, it's like an added bonus.  Oh, I like that.  On the Anthony channel, you can hear Jim bleed through, and on Opie, it would be the same  thing.  That's a good idea.  Are you guys ready to hear the best fart story ever, according to this guy in Jersey?  All right.  What's your name, Jersey guy?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Best fart story ever, huh?  Yeah, I would think so.  We went through six other subjects.  You go back to it.  What?  We went through six other subjects before we go back to this. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, no, that's okay.  Let's go.  All right.  In Antelope Bay.  Uh, the elevators skip like the first 16 or the first 30 floors.  Oh, boy.  It's a level.  How are we going to try to deal with this phone?  Your phone is really bad.  It's cutting out.  Where are you, fella?  Right now?  I'm going to do the city.  Hey, it's hard to hear you.  Hey, it's hard to hear you.  I got some apple cut in my throat.  Little apple.  Sorry about that.  It's all right.  All right.  So, it skips the first 30 levels. 
[00:55:30]  And as soon as the elevator doors closed, coming up from the pool, I almost had to like shit myself.  Worst fart sound.  Worst smell ever.  Remember, the elevator was packed.  Everybody turned around and looked at me, moved away to the corner of the elevator, and just stared at me for the first five minutes of the elevator ride.  A little embarrassing.  Oh, no.  Is Jimmy adding a little scent to this story?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, he is.  That's the best fart story ever, huh?  I would think so.  I look like an asshole.  Let me tell you a better fart story.  Not that yours isn't an obvious classic that was made for a film. 
[00:56:00]  My friend had a wife who was kind of, let's just say, an invalid.  And this is true.  And he would go home after eating White Castle, and as her mouth was half open, he would fart into her mouth.  Oof.  That's true.  Why would he do that?  I guess he just resented her.  Laying there.  True love.  Yeah.  I guess he resented her.  Let's go to Chuck in Kansas.  Hey, Chuck, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I was calling to see if you guys are going to be doing an update today on the Tony Danza chat board. 
[00:56:30]  Well, we do have an update on the Tony Danza message board.  I want to congratulate the O&A Army.  They shut the thing down.  What a bunch of freaks.  I'm a truck driver out here on I-70, and you guys had tears streaming down my face from laughing so hard yesterday.  We attacked that message board so badly that they had to shut it down.  Yeah, and it's under construction.  What happened, Anthony?  Someone got the codes of the moderators or something?  It seems that one of the members of the O&A Army was able to crack the password for the moderator for the Tony Danza message board. 
[00:57:00]  And they put up a big thing that said, thoughts and prayers out to Tony Danza's message board on the actual message board.  They were able to hack it.  And they had to shut it down.  So now the message on the message board reads, what is it?  You got it right there?  Here it is.  The Tony Danza show message boards are temporarily down for maintenance. 
[00:57:30]  We thank you for your patience during this process.  Signed, the Tony Danza show staff.  They completely infiltrated the message board and shut it down, but not before completely pissing everybody off on the board.  All the people that love the show, the Hayseeds, the staff of the Tony Danza show, really pissed them off with some hysterically funny posts and screen names.  It's not like they were just going on going, Tony sucks. 
[00:58:00]  It was that there was a screen name, Lil' Connor Peterson.  Lil' Connor Peterson.  Big Duties Ben.  Old Gravy Leg.  That's my favorite.  Old Gravy Leg was posting.  And like you said, they wouldn't just post Tony sucks.  It was whole conversations that would go on using little inside jokes from the show.  Well, we want to thank the O&A Army, especially the troops at whackbag.com, a great message board.  And also the fine folks at opianthony.net, another great Opie and Anthony message board. 
[00:58:30]  They just took it upon themselves to get back at Tony because his people roughed up our own Eric here the other morning.  They felt he was inappropriately treated and that the response of these maniacs is to just shut your message board down.  Yeah, if anybody...  Oh, it's not over!  Gee, get right there.  That's my new bit.  The devil bit.  Yeah, the devil bit.  It comes out.  Devilish.  If anyone screws with this program, you better think long and hard if you're the owner of a message board because we do attack the message boards. 
[00:59:00]  Our people are animals.  Oh, they love it.  And they're just funny freaks.  They really are funny.  It's not just mindless banter.  There's some really funny shit there.  Oh, really?  No, our listeners make us a lot funnier at times, definitely.  Although I say it's not mindless banter, but I'm sure some housewife in the Midwest doesn't find the humor in a Conor Peterson name posting,  Oh, no.  My dad showed my mom who's the boss.  He took her fishing.  I'm sure that's not seen as funny as it really is by a lot of them.  That was a great line.  Oh, my God.  And you know she's just like, these people are reading it going, where do I know that name? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Conor Peterson.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Who thinks this is funny?  Oh, all our hands go up.  All right, why don't we take our first break?  I don't even know if we did anything this first hour, but we're definitely having fun.  Yeah, the requests are coming in, Anthony.  We're going to play stuff that hopefully will convince the free players out there to subscribe to 202 High Voltage. 
[01:00:00]  Give them a little taste of what the show is about through our banter and some of our material.  The premium content channel.  Another thing we can't wait for Washington to change.  Could you guys, you know, the hardcore fans of the show that only listen to 202 or mostly 202,  just take white out and where it says high voltage on your unit, just white that out and get a nice sharpie and write the ONA virus.  Right.  That's what the station should be called.  Very good.  The virus.  Opie and Anthony's virus.  Opie and Anthony.  ONA virus. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be Opie and Anthony.  That's the name we want for our channel.  I mean, it is our channel, so we should have a say in that.  High voltage means nothing.  It's high voltage.  Stupid.  Shocking.  Well, we're getting requests for something I don't even think we've played on the new show.  The gay purview?  Oh, the football thing.  The football gay purview.  Yes.  Take a listen to this and we'll continue, obviously, because that's what we have to do until 10 o'clock.  It's coming to the Gay Channel.  What is it?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition. 
[01:01:00]  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up.  With your host John Madden and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning and, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and flagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairys, just the hunkiest gay studs in wild group action competition.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there. 
[01:01:30]  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz.  That was a late one.  That one didn't come and didn't come and didn't come and finally they threw it out of there.  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old beaten lob.  Oh, what a meal those guys are having.  They look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts.  You push, you push, you push.  Get gay purview today.  You just rode him backwards.  You just put him right on his back. 
[01:02:00]  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle.  The second annual male group orgy competition on Gay Purview.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Boy, yeah.  He's going to fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.

This whole album just rocks.  So what's the official message from the O&A Army as far as the Tony Danza message board goes? 
[01:07:30]  This is the message that was up on the message board when they hacked it.  It says, the Tony Danza show message boards are now controlled by the O&A Army.  All the rubes, feel free to come down to the studio and meet my mule.  Thoughts and prayers, Tony Danza.  Got a picture of Tony sitting in a chair.  What a bunch of creeps.  There are creeps, though.  And we love them.  We absolutely love the O&A Army. 
[01:08:00]  Do you know how annoyed he must have been to tune on and see his mug there next to that rotten little message?  Oh.  Annoyed.  You know, we're not even the generals of the Army anymore.  They just take it upon themselves.  They don't even wait for orders anymore.  No.  They know us and this program so well, they just know what to do.  Their own discretion.  Right.  You just take care of it, guys.  What else is going on in the news?  Our indictments are in for the NBA fight there.  Oh, yeah.  A bunch of people got arrested. 
[01:08:30]  All misdemeanors except for the one fan that threw a chair in the video.  Yeah.  They had video clips that I had never seen.  You know, we all saw the one on the news, the one everyone saw.  With Artest running out into the crowd and decking that guy.  But, you know, they had clips of everybody from all kinds of different camera angles.  And then they were freeze-framing them a couple of weeks back and showing them on the news, like, turning people in.  We want to talk to this man. 
[01:09:00]  And they'd show the guy that threw the chair.  Then he starts walking out.  Yeah.  They freeze-framing him with this look of rage on their faces.  Have you seen this man?  I guess they caught everybody because a bunch of people got arrested.  And, yeah, most of them just misdemeanors.  And the bald guy, they showed him on the screen?  Yeah.  Did you see the lawyers?  Uh-uh.  And the press conference, they show the bald guy on the screen.  They're like, and this is the guy that started it all.  Yeah, man.  Dude, that was me. 
[01:09:30]  Old guy.  He looked like young guy until he started brawling.  And one of the guys knocked his hat off.  And you realize, oh, my God.  The guy's got, like, white hair in that horseshoe pattern around his head.  It's like, what the hell is he doing throwing cups at people?  The day it happened, you called him Murray Slaughter.  Murray Slaughter.  He looked like Murray Slaughter from Mary Tyler Moore.  Murray.  Mur.  Don't throw cups at the colored. 
[01:10:00]  Did you hear the one about the guy that threw the cup at the colored boy?  Colored boy?  Why are you a son of a bitch?  Okay.  Lou.  Lou, Murray got in big trouble at the basketball game last night.  Think you ought to reprimand him.  Murray.  Mur was very rambunctious last night.  Yeah, John Green.  Thank you, Ben.  John Green was the guy that started off. 
[01:10:30]  White guy, right?  Yeah.  Now they're coming out and saying that this is going to help the NBA.  How?  They say jersey sales are going to go through the roof.  Really?  Tennis is going to go up.  Yeah, controversy sales.  We all know that.  That's true.  That's what America's all about.  Now, when do they play again?  I don't know.  Christmas Day, those two teams.  Oh, that's right.  Christmas Day.  Christmas Day.  You watch.  It's going to be one of the highest rated basketball games.  I think they should just, like, not allow fans in.  It would be hilarious just to watch the two NBA teams play into an empty arena.  That was it.  I was saying steel cage. 
[01:11:00]  Steel cage, yeah.  I like that.  Drop down the steel cage in an empty arena.  Well, good.  Nothing will happen.  No justice.  No.  No, there will be a big buildup and then nothing.  Yeah, it'll just be a regular game.  JJ, what's up?  Hey, man.  How's it going, guys?  Pretty good.  You're a trucker?  Yeah, kind of.  I drive a truck.  You guys are fucking funny, man.  Oh.  Oh, thanks.  I've had my radio for a week.  I have the other satellite service, too.  The little doggy company? 
[01:11:30]  Did anyone else see their stock drop to almost nothing yesterday?  Those idiots that thought we're buying the hype?  Raise your hand if you bought in at $9 a share.  Raise your hand.  You stupid, stupid people.  Now, with that hand, make a fist and now punch yourself in the face.  How much did it fall?  Like, down to $6?  Two bucks.  It fell 24% in one day.  Yeah, but aren't there variables?  Huh?  Shut up.  I always wanted to sound like I just wanted to stop.  Shut up.  Aren't there variables? 
[01:12:00]  They got downgraded.  Yeah, everybody's downgrading the little doggies.  Stock there.  They're overvalued at $9 a share or $8 and change, of course.  Nothing's changed.  They're still in the crapper as far as money goes.  They're hemorrhaging cash until Mel gets in there and tries to seal up some of the leaks.  Some of those redundant employees that are over there just milking it.  They don't pay people.  Right, Ben?  You're probably getting paid.  Ben worked over there a while. 
[01:12:30]  There's a lot of people that don't get paid.  I didn't get paid for a long time.  Lots of money.  Ben had to be deprogrammed.  We drove by in a van and threw him in.  Drove here and deprogrammed him.  You know, that was another reason we didn't pick the little doggie company because Ben was  working over there and he was telling us, look, dude, I haven't been paid in how long?  It was months and it wasn't even just me.  I remember one day we were out, the three of us went for lunch and we ran into a bunch  of people we knew that worked at Sirius and they all said the same thing.  Anthony's like, oh, how are you doing?  They're like, yeah, I haven't been paid in three months.  It's great.  I haven't been paid.  Me neither, man.  I haven't.  I'm like, oh, great. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, we're going to go there.  All right.  Another negative for that company.  Stop.  Yeah.  All the stories Ben would tell about Pamela Lee Anderson.  Pam Anderson's doing a show over there and she would spend money on private jets.  Well, the first expense was she had to have her makeup done every week for the radio show.  So that was like for the right grand.  Makeup for the radio people.  For a grand.  For a grand.  It was an hour show a week.  Who was she?  One hour a week.  I get my hair done. 
[01:13:30]  Wait.  One show a week?  Okay.  No, it was one hour a week.  One hour a week.  One hour a week.  There was the hairstyles and makeup that had to be done.  So that was four grand.  And then there was the chef that had to be brought in.  No, you're not.  A chef?  I'm dead serious.  I'm a saussier.  The expenditure was crazy.  That's all gone.  Now the mail's there.  That won't happen.  Oh, you won't see that happening once he takes that.  What about the private jet?  That's the best part.  The private jet.  That was the funniest.  She came into New York to do a show on a private jet. 
[01:14:00]  That was the funniest part.  And I'm sitting in there with the boss in the office and we're talking to Pamela's assistant.  And he goes, yeah, she just decided to take the private jet.  And they're like, all right, serious.  We'll pay for that.  No problem.  They expensed the jet.  Even better was, okay, well, like, how much is it?  They're like, oh, 46.  Well, I got 4,600.  Nobody don't know.  It was 46 grand.  But $46,000 they spent to fly in so she could do that one-hour awful radio show.  Fly her in to do the show. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  I bet it was a good show, though.  I bet there was a lot of laughs, a lot of tears.  Oh, I'm sure.  No.  No, no.  My guys, man.  Ben, you were involved in that program.  It was the most miserable.  It was a very stressful situation.  Was she nice to you?  Oh, yeah.  She's great.  No, she's a sweetheart.  Was she constantly looking at your mule and saying, oh, Tommy?  Anything like that?  No?  She's great.  I like her.  She's a good person.  She's all good.  But it was stressful, you know?  I guess.  It was stressful.  I got the guide from one of the guys over there. 
[01:15:00]  I was telling Ope one day, because I left there one day.  I was so pissed off after the show, and I called him.  I got a guide how to work on how to produce a radio show by one of the bosses over there.  I actually still have that.  I should bring that in.  And obviously, you haven't read it yet.  Oh, come on.  You gave yourself the hoo-hoo-hoo?  Yeah.  I've never seen that before.  Because I knew it was bad.  I gave myself the obnoxious laugh, and then the hoo-hoo.  It was pretty funny.  All right.  Paragraph one.  Professional herking and jerking. 
[01:15:30]  No, it was how to answer the phone.  The first paragraph was how to answer the phones.  That was the whole thing.  Really?  They instructed you on what you were to say?  Yeah, how you answer the phones properly.  Hello?  No?  Not hello?  This is brutal.  I'm going to find that.  I'm going to bring that in.  Please do.  All right.  Very good.  It's going to be on the other team's playbook.  I don't want to get fired.  I need money so I can purchase other men's cocks.  Wow, man.  You're still holding a grudge, aren't you? 
[01:16:00]  Holy jeez.  You're still holding a grudge, my friend.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure there will be some phone calls from people over there once Mel takes the reins  and chops what they call the fat.  They must chop the fat out of the company because they are just hemorrhaging cash.  Hemorrhaging.  Well, the other thing there, I mean, they spend money like there was always spreads of food  like you could never imagine.  Every day is a party.  Every day is a party.  Why not? 
[01:16:30]  They spend money.  There's one show that airs one day a week for like two hours that they would deck the  whole lobby out and they'd have a bar set up and all kinds of Italian food.  Well, that's what the stockholders are paying for when you buy stock.  That's what they love.  That's what a stockholder wants to pay for.  Buffets for redundant employees and Learjets for a horse.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Stockholders would be very happy.  Keep pushing that up.  Good job. 
[01:17:00]  You could listen to Imus talk about that every morning.  Yeah, I bought my stock.  You hear him?  No.  I was talking about how he owns a serious stock.  Oh, really?  Got in at a good price.  Hope he bought more yesterday.  Anyone pump?  Oh, what a pump and dump that is.  Good luck to you.  Paying for buffets and Ben.  Or payday that is.  Especially if you get some sushi at the buffet. 
[01:17:30]  He went months without being paid.  What kind of way is that to treat an employee?  I'm definitely not the only one.  It still goes on.  I haven't got paid.  Your contract's not signed yet.  Have you been paid yet, Jim?  He has not been paid yet.  But that's actually kind of not...  It's contractual issues.  Yeah, it's not a contractual.  Yeah.  And you're looking at all these high-end apartments?  Well, high-end.  I mean, they're better than what I got.  Jimmy's apartment shopping in New York City, which is ridiculous.  It is very expensive. 
[01:18:00]  You're paying huge amounts of money for a place.  First of all, it's guaranteed that you will see a roach.  Every place in New York has roaches.  Have you seen...  I saw one the other night.  Yeah.  Every place...  You can be the richest son of a bitch.  I think the stupid Polish maid that I hired displaced all the roaches, and now they don't  know where to hide.  They used to have little places to hide, and she's picked them all up.  She probably brought them in on her stockings.  I'm watching TV.  I'm sorry, my little friend.  I will have to take your home. 
[01:18:30]  They're huge, too, man.  Every once in a while, a huge roach will just run across my living room.  New York City roach, man.  Yeah, I'm watching TV in my nice, clean apartment, and there it goes...  What is it about those goddamn things?  You know, you see a daddy long legs, or a beetle, or something like that.  It doesn't affect you.  Like, when you see that roach scurrying around, it gives me the heebie-jeebies.  Because, first of all, when you see a daddy long legs, I think you don't...  Normally, it's not indicative that there's 500 of them lurking behind the couch. 
[01:19:00]  That's kind of a horrific thought, sure.  Yeah, roaches.  There's one.  There's many.  Yeah.  Roaches are just associated with being dirty.  Filth, and dirt, and slums.  Yeah, and slums.  Absolutely.  We lived in that apartment in Brooklyn for a while before I moved out of that hellhole.  You had roaches?  And every place in New York City, either Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, you go to any apartment building,  and you are going to see roaches, because someone in the building will be a slob.  We used to have to take garbage to the garbage room where there was a chute on every floor. 
[01:19:30]  There's a garbage chute.  And I would take the garbage out when it was like the size of a little Dwayne Reed shopping bag  and throw it down the chute.  I'd walk in there, open the door.  These animals would leave full bags of garbage in the room.  The chute's right there.  And they wouldn't want to, like, touch it or put it down the chute,  so they'd wait for the super or somebody to come up once a week to do it.  And the garbage would sit there, and it's a roach party.  It's like the serious buffet set out for roaches in the garbage room. 
[01:20:00]  Except the roaches got their money.  Yes, they did.  A funny story, though, about Jim, and to go back to the farting.  Oh, you prefaced it with funny.  Oh, boy, here we go.  All right, everyone, gear up.  Sit down, folks, and put on your laughing hats.  Here it comes.  Ben's got a funny story.  No, no, we went and looked at it.  I went and looked at an apartment with Jim, and we get on.  It was on the 14th floor.  We get on the elevator.  There's this nice old lady on the elevator, and she's talking to Jim.  She goes, oh, are you moving in or whatever?  He proceeds to blast the worst fart ever. 
[01:20:30]  And we were on the 14th floor, and it stopped twice.  The tall guy that got on was completely mortified.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  I stink.  I stink.  That was good.  Hello.  Hello.  Never, ever preface anything on this show with, I got a funny story.  Funny story.  Something for the listeners.  Unless it goes like this. 
[01:21:00]  So I'm at Tommy Lee's house.  We walk away from the pool for two minutes.  See, that's funny.  Yeah.  I thought I heard a tiny little splash.  A kerplunk.  Like someone had dropped a milk dud in a cup of water.  All right.  Let's, I don't know.  Let's move on to other things.  What else is happening in the news?  Dick Clark had a stroke, Anthony.  Oh, poor Dick Clark.  The news has got to calm the F down.  He's going to be fine, and he's going to be in Times Square this coming New Year's Eve. 
[01:21:30]  The world's oldest teenager.  75 years old.  Oh, they do.  75.  75 years young, Opie.  Turns out it was a slight stroke, and he's going to be just fine.  But they're going to be doing news reports on this all day long, because there's nothing  better to do.  Yeah, they're saying he's going to be all right, and he's going to be in Times Square once again  this year.  Yeah.  75?  75 years old.  I hate to say it.  He really looks good.  If you're Hollywood's sickening, I'm saying that, but he looks great.  It's the awful thing about getting old and kind of looking good, the fact that, you know, 
[01:22:00]  people don't realize you're old, and, you know, you have things like strokes.  All right.  We could cross the Dick Clark thing off.  Very good.  All right.  Ringing in the New Year at the minor stroke of midnight now.  That's what they're going to be saying.  Oh, wow.  That was funny, man.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  All right.  That was funny.  I thought I was being hung out there.  No.  It took a second to register, like, what you were saying.  Well, that's a funny comment about that, Nick Clark.  Because a lot of Anthony's humor is intelligent.  Oh, thank you, Opie.  You've got to let the brain decipher it a little bit, and then you go, oh, wow. 
[01:22:30]  Okay.  I try.  I like hitting the toilet, though, every so often.  And laptops bad for your sperm count.  Everything's bad for something.  Now, the laptop, they're saying, might keep you from getting your wife or girlfriend pregnant.  Perfect.  That's a good thing, I guess.  I always use the old-fashioned way.  After you've done having sex, they just crack her in the face with a laptop.  No surprise why you don't have a lady living with you there, Jimmy.  I don't want a lady.  Do you?  Yes, you do. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, you kind of do.  No, I don't.  Maybe a little.  Yeah, a lot.  Don't sound desperate.  Helen.  It'll happen.  Relax.  Helen.  I don't want a girl.  Laptops, though, how many people really put them in their laps when they use them?  It's called a laptop.  It's called a laptop.  Not if you're Rich Voss.  It's a laptop.  I've got to get a laptop.  You know what?  When I eat tortilla chips.  You know what?  I hate to do this to Voss, but we've got to teach him a lesson.  You guys talk.  I've got to find something.  He was really bothered that he didn't have a good appearance on our show yesterday or two 
[01:23:30]  days ago.  Really bothered.  But his bad appearances are good.  I think people like when he kind of falls on his face.  There are people that hate myself, Anthony, Norton, but we don't care.  We don't take it personally.  Yeah.  You know?  We know enough people like what we do on the show that it works.  Simple as that.  Voss is one of these guys.  One person says he stinks and he can't handle it.  Yeah.  And we've been trying to tell him, you can't listen to the fans. 
[01:24:00]  Even though it's a lot more people than that.  He's one of the funniest guys in the business.  I know.  He's got one or two dumbbells who don't like him.  Who cares, dude?  So he posted on our message board, whackbag.com.  He did?  What's Voss' name on the message board?  Voss.  Oh, there you go.  It's all about him.  Also, opianthony.net, another great message board.  They're not getting plugs.  Enough plugs.  Opie Anthony or just Opie Anthony?  Opie Anthony.  Here's Voss.  Voss is on the phone.  This is what Voss wrote overnight. 
[01:24:30]  Last night at 11 o'clock.  Here's the deal.  When I go into...  You've got to do it in the Voss voice.  Well, then you've got to do it because I don't...  No.  Just do this.  No, I'm...  Do an impression so people have to drink.  No, I don't do it, Voss.  All right, then just read.  I do some fine impressions on the show, but Voss is not one of them.  But you've just got to do this with your teeth.  Just put spit in your teeth.  No, no, I can't.  No?  You want to do it yourself?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Go ahead.  Just picture Voss' voice.  All right.  I can't.  Picture if you will.  Here's the deal.  When I go...  Funny post. 
[01:25:00]  No, you've got to do it as Voss.  No, go ahead.  Jimmy, read a line.  I don't do Voss.  Ant does Voss.  It's easy.  Just spit in your teeth.  Why don't you read the line and then, you know, Ant will do it.  No, go ahead.  I think you read the line.  Just read.  All right.  Here's the deal.  When I go into O&A, it's to hang out.  If I come up with something funny, good.  And if I don't, oh, well.  I am not...  I am not B interviewed.  There's Voss for you.  I am not B interviewed?  I am not B interviewed.  I am not B interviewed. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, it's not like it has an edit feature that you can read it over and edit your post if  there's any problem.  I'm certainly not helping him out today.  I am not B interviewed, so...  He probably meant B Arthur.  So I like most other...  Holy crap.  Listen to this sentence.  I am not B interviewed, comma, so I, like most other comics, will throw shit out when  I can.  I don't step on other people when they are talking, so I get stuff in when I can.  When there are other guests on and I think they should be trash, that's where I try to 
[01:26:00]  shine.  Now for Kid Nigg.  I guess that's another member of the board.  He's addressing individuals now.  Oh, yeah.  He's obsessed.  Dude, this guy was on a network TV show for two seasons and one lousy poster on whackbed.com  got to him.  Although, let me jump in.  I don't mind addressing a guy.  If a guy posts bad about you or whatever, you address it.  That's cool.  But it's like to really let it bother you.  I always answer real hate mail.  Well, this is the funny part about this.  You read this post and he's trying to act like it doesn't really bother him, but you 
[01:26:30]  can tell he's just so bothered.  It says, oh, well.  Yeah.  Whenever you say, oh, well, you're bothered.  So now for Kid Nigg.  I am not sure if you are the same spook that use to post.  Use S-E?  That use to post.  Use to post?  Yeah.  Wait, how is that spelled?  U-S-E.  U-S-E.  Now for Kid Nigg.  T-O?  Yeah, use to.  Use to.  Not use to.  Yeah.  Use to. 
[01:27:00]  Use to.  Now for Kid Nigg.  I'm not sure if you are the same spook that use to post on the other board because I can't  smell through my computer.  Oh, my God.  He's really pissed off.  He's funny on the message board.  If you don't think I'm funny, that's fine.  You won't come to any of my shows and that will be one less primate that the club won't  have to worry about.  Holy Jesus, Voss.  And we tried to calm him down at the show like, dude, not every appearance is going  to be great.  And actually, he gave some great radio that day with the ear thing and stuff. 
[01:27:30]  And he had some great lines.  I see that you called me a hack.  I will give you the benefit of the doubt and not get too mad.  Maybe when you were typing, your bottom lip was hitting the wrong keys and you didn't  mean to spell hack.  Holy.  Oh, man.  Perfect.  Cause, would a hack be writing for the Oscars?  He is writing for the Oscars this year.  He has to throw that in there.  Yes, he is.  Or would a hack...  That's for Chris Rock, who he's writing for, will be happy to hear these things he's  written on the message board.  Stupid-ass thoughts. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, we'll make sure that Chris Rock gets a copy of this because that's what friends  are for.  Send it to Chris Rock.  Cause, would a hack be writing for the Oscars or would a hack make 12 grand last week  or be on network TV two years in a row?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe he's writing this.  That would have called me a hack.  So, maybe you just made a mistake.  Kind of like your mom when the load that created you trickled out of her ass and slid into her  Brillo hair smelly catcher's mitt.  She calls her drink ticket.  Sounds like the best part of you dribble out of your mom's ass into her Brillo catcher's 
[01:28:30]  mitt and she calls her drink ticket.  It's going to be Sergeant Voss.  Wow.  Wow.  He is an angry Jew.  And then he finishes up by saying, just a mistake she should have wiped.  It happens to the best of us.  Voss.  Kidding!  How tall are you?  He is so bothered.  Oh, could you just picture those stubby little fingers just flailing away on the keyboard 
[01:29:00]  all angry?  No, it's this.  It's Peck.  Oh, he's a Peck.  Where's the A?  Where's the A?  Uh, A.  Let's go with the T.  T, okay.  What did Kid Nigg write?  I don't know.  I don't know what Kid Nigg.  Probably just said that he had an awful appearance and doesn't like him.  There are people that don't like all of us.  Somebody will go to the message.  We have our haters out there.  Yeah, you get them.  So what? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Norton ruins the show.  You guys are good.  Why do you have my...  I just address them and you don't want to bother you.  Numerically, it's going to happen.  So what?  Well, you do ruin the show.  No, no.  I'm not saying I don't know.  But, you know, I'm just trying to say.  Oh, we just don't know how to tell you.  No, but I don't really...  We just don't know how to tell you off air.  So we might as well just kind of make...  No, I'll bite.  We might as well just make believe it's a bid and we'll just make believe that.  No, but I'll bite.  For the air, we'll just...  But I'll bite.  Oh, my God.  Why would you even say something like that?  What?  Because that'll get them like thinking that maybe it really is.  Well, maybe it's time you, you know, reach between the lines. 
[01:30:00]  You don't understand.  I'm here to pick up a check.  Very good.  Join the club.  And you know what, dude?  You want to throw me off the show?  As long as I have the downtown on December 23rd.  That's all you need.  516-293-7700.  As I leave the Opie and Anthony show, you can hear my speech at the downtown December 23rd in Long Island.  And, of course, you can go to eatabullet.com, right?  Absolutely.  Pick up old Jimmy Norton CD.  I think, Eric, I saw him run over to the computer. 
[01:30:30]  I think he's looking for Kid Nigg's email or post that got Voss so angered.  Hot under the collar.  He's got him so Steve under the collar that he is writing racist remarks.  Writing all kinds of racist remarks.  Really busting apart the Jewish stereotype that Jews really are intolerant of the African-American people.  Just instantly goes to Voss playing the race card.  Don't be mad at me just because we made movies that made fools out of you in the 70s and you allowed it. 
[01:31:00]  Jesus, Voss.  And I'm getting a communique.  Voss sent in a song that he wrote.  He did?  Yeah.  I didn't know Voss was a songwriter also.  He likes music?  Yeah, he, uh, oh, God.  Wow.  Where's Voss' song, Opie?  He is multi-talented, Rich Voss.  I had a great idea, but I can't find Voss' song.  Aw.  Movie Man writes in, Opie, give Voss a break.  He had to answer his phone while he was typing. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, that's true.  Poopsie might have been there.  Cage says there's even a picture on Wackbag of Voss typing on his laptop with his tiny little hand.  Did he really call it a laptop?  He is a dolt.  A lab cop.  Well.  Voss doesn't know the difference between a mini-disc and an iPod player.  I'm getting, oh, wow.  Without timing, you know, it can't be comedy, so forget it.  Someone is writing in that Jim Florentine was at the Damage Plan show and was an eyewitness to Dimebag's murder. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know if that's true or not.  I know he knows, Jim knows those guys.  Really?  Yeah.  And I don't know if that's true, but I know he used to call him.  Can we get Florentine on the air?  I'll try to call him.  I'll try to call him.  There's someone who wrote it.  Forget it.  I called him last night when I heard that.  I'm like, I wonder if he's aware of it.  It doesn't matter anymore, guys.  Forget it.  The moment's gone.  Comedy's all about timing.  The moment is gone.  I don't know why that wouldn't be right in front of me today, but...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[01:32:30]  Now you've angered him.  Now you've angered him.  Yeah.  Just imagine how funny it would have been.  All right.  Anyway.  Oh, what?  So what were we talking about?  How come there's not like a little organization system that would be a little bit easier if  you used to flip through?  Because our executive producer is a slob, so we all have to be slobs.  Ben Sparks?  Look at this place.  Ben, this really is... 
[01:33:00]  I can't find anything.  This place, it looks like...  It's been messy since you got here, actually.  No.  Yes, it was clean when you got here.  How come there's no filing system for the CD so Greg, a.k.a. Opie, can just look through  and find what he needs?  You instigator.  All right.  We've got to take a break and regroup.  I think Ben Sparks is doing a fine job.  I love Ben Sparks.  Listen, it was clean, though.  The studio in general, Opie, was clean today when he came in.  Whatever.  I mean, this is...  Why don't you check under that big stack of CDs with the jeans on it?  This is way too inside, but this is just a mess up here still. 
[01:33:30]  Opie's area over the CD player?  There's just so much...  There's literally...  40 CDs, 50 CDs?  At least 100.  Are you kidding?  And I remember you did ask for that to be cleaned up.  There's 100 CDs, and you can't find anything because there's just too much.  Too much clutter.  We've got to play something going into break.  Any suggestions?  Well, we put the word out to the listeners.  What do they want to hear?  Because a lot of new people are on board, especially from the free play week.  I had a list, and if I could find it under all this paperwork... 
[01:34:00]  One guy suggests...  Oh, my God!  One guy suggests we play some George Carlin from early on in our tenure here at XM.  Remember when I used to just play and play and play the House of Blues bit?  These are our listener suggestions.  We're looking for listener suggestions to turn the free play people into subscribers.  Okay?  It is the free play week.  You're getting us for free this week on 202 to continue to receive channel 202 on your XM radio.  You'll need to add Opie and Anthony to your XM account.  You can do that by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or subscribe online. 
[01:34:30]  What's going on?  You're trying to get Florentine?  Yeah, I'm seeing a message.  Oh!  All right.  Anthony, some suggestions.  We could play Green Poopies.  The Arnold Prank Calls.  I don't even know if we have a copy of that anymore.  Dick Insider.  Yeah, I like that one.  100 Grand.  There's No Santa.  100 Grand.  100 Grand?  People like the 100 Grand. 
[01:35:00]  100 Grand it is.  Okay, we're going to take a break here.  Mm-hmm.  Regroup.  Try to clean up the area so we can do a radio show.  I need to find the stuff that we want to talk about today.  Oh, boy.  This is really just a mess.  All right.  What's this?  That's the Voss thing.  That's it?  That was it.  That's short?  And Voss had that long explanation?  Kid Africa, his name is.  I guess Voss was calling him Kid Nig. 
[01:35:30]  Loyalty doesn't make Voss funny.  The thing that's funny about Voss is just how unfunny he is.  The good thing about him is that he's a hack and he knows it.  Now that, I completely disagree with that.  Yeah, I got to defend Voss.  I mean, yeah, we joke about how unfunny he is,  but when it comes down to it, when he's on a stage, he's really funny.  His act is really, really funny.  Voss isn't a hack.  No.  A hack goes up there.  No, I'm looking for a copy of that.  Dude, you can't find anything here.  Someone has to take a picture of this place. 
[01:36:00]  I have a camera with shit, dick.  I have a camera just in case someone comes in.  Oh, that's about it.  What was it?  I didn't hear it.  All right, we're going to clean up the area.  Listen to 100 grand, and don't worry.  We're professionals.  We'll get this back on the tracks, okay?  Oh.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  And 7th caller.  Oh, no way!  I did it!  Tell me, I won!  I won!  I don't know what.  You're kidding, right? 
[01:36:30]  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing, I have this old, oh, I cannot, jeez, I've got to calm down.  Calm down, calm yourself.  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this, oh, man, I got this box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one, a new truck.  Oh, that, oh.  Wait, wait, dude, how are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What? 
[01:37:00]  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you've been saying?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of douchebags.  Hey, hey, hey.  Congratulations, man. 
[01:37:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Back, way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW.  Not sure of the call letters.  1590 day timer.  Signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Oh!  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The, uh, Opie and Anthony show.

I always wonder if cult leaders treat their job the way other people treat theirs.  You know, it's hot.  It's 5.30.  You're off work.  You're in a bar.  There's a hot one out there today, wasn't there?  It sure was, boy.  What kind of business are you in?  Plumbing?  How about you? 
[01:40:00]  Cult leader.  Well, what's that business like?  Hell, it's about like anything else.  You can't get good help.  As soon as you get some dedicated folks, government comes in and tries to kill you.  If you can learn your Bible verses and get a good flair for stockpiling, you can muck a pretty good living in it.  I've been doing it so long, I don't guess I could do anything else.  It's a headache, but I enjoy it.

[01:42:00]  This is all stuff we were thinking about, talking about, but never got to it.  And now it's just a huge, messy pile.  I see that.  Top Earning Dead Celebrities of 2003.  We're just going to run through all this stuff really fast, and then we'll have a nice,  clean work area.  We can start anew.  Yeah, dead celebrities continue to make money.  We all know that.

[01:42:30]  Top Earning Dead Celebrities of 2003.  He threw his headphones on.  It's like, what?  What?  I got him mad.  Ben running around like a nut.  Yeah.  What?  That little mess, by the way, is yours.  It's all stuff from your little green book bag.  No, Ben, you are.  Whose is this?  That's not mine.  What about the rest of this mess?  Well, whose magazines are those, Ben Sparks?  These are all magazines that we use.  These are all the coverings.  Why are they stacked nice and neatly?  Shut up, Jim.  I'd like to know.  There's no shut up.  First of all, asshole, that comes in at 10 to 6. 
[01:43:00]  That's right.  That's why you know it's not my mess, because I walk in too late to mess things up.  By the time I walk in, the show's on the air.  This is all Jim's medicine.  Look at all Jim's medicine.  That's nice and neat, though.  All right, listen.  It's nice and neat.  Take your fucking medicine.  No.  Roll it.  My medicine.  Why do you need halls?  I don't know, in case I get a sore throat.  What's wrong with a little medicine over there?  People bring in medicine when they're sick.  You're not sick.  My medicine's sitting right there.  Those little things.  You're a hypochondriac?  What's a hypochondriac?  I don't know.  You know something?  You would be...  You know something, though? 
[01:43:30]  I got a defense.  I'm not sick anymore.  But if you do get sick, you'll be the first one to go, is there any...  Tylenol extra strains.  Why is this a headache?  Is there something laying around, and then you're...  Actually, I need this one.  Yeah.  I need that.  Rolaids.  What?  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Exactly.  Why is there sunscreen in here?  Who else is this?  Is that mine?  Look, I tried.  I cannot possibly defend sunscreen.  Not mine.  Not my sunscreen.  I'm taking the extra strain Tylenol home.  Why don't we just leave it here for everyone?  Why do you got to take it home?  I need it.  Why is there sunscreen? 
[01:44:00]  Because this place is a mess.  I didn't know.  Who the hell brought sunscreen?  Why do we have candles?  Well, when Jim farts, I usually light a candle now.  Yeah, but why is...  Like a religious observance or something?  The hell is this?  What is that?  Whiteboard cleaner.  That's that guy from yesterday.  He brought that...  Oh.  That's for a whiteboard.  Thank you.  You need to do your Rolaids?  Yeah, man.  I got bad stuff.  Well, come up there.  Why?  They're not in the way there.  No, I won't.  They're right here.  They're stacked very nice and neat in front of me. 
[01:44:30]  I'm not a slob.  Why do we need Windex?  Because Jim sprays down his area when he comes in.  We do need Windex because we have disgusting people in here, and that keeps the germs away.  You can't take...  Windex doesn't keep germs away?  It does.  It's got alcohol.  It cleans up like crap.  You can't...  What's Gojo?  Luxury foam hair and body wash?  It's the guy who brought that weird...  People clean up with...  I put that up there.  See, this is stuff, though, that if it disappears...  We don't need body wash.  He's taking showers during the show. 
[01:45:00]  No, people wash their hands with it, I think.  Dude, you can't take stuff that's legitimate and throw it out.  Yeah.  But that's not, like, disinfectant.  You can't throw stuff out just because there's other mess.  That just makes it smell pretty.  What?  You can't throw out stuff that isn't messy just because it's here in the midst of...  This stuff screen's not mine.  Are we still using the anti-static spray?  Can I have my Rolaids?  Yeah, you can have your Rolaids.  They're not going to be all crunchy.  They're not going to be good for me.  Do we need this?  Yeah, we need it.  All right.  There you go.  I agree.  It's messy, but you can't go overboard.  I'm not going overboard.  You go overboard. 
[01:45:30]  You've got to allow a little stuff laying around just for your own sanity.  You have to.  Because if you start getting crazy like that...  All right, Ant.  You take care of the sunscreen.  Why?  No, I don't agree with the sunscreen.  Maybe Earl brought it in because he just feels so guilty.  He's hoping that that was the problem.  That was awful.  Was it?  Yeah, it wasn't funny.  It wasn't that bad.  It was not really funny.  It was all right.  It was like a thing about self-hatred and shit.  We need this.  We need the Lysol because of the gym.  Yes, Lysol.  That I agree with.  You need Halls? 
[01:46:00]  Napkins.  Yes.  Why?  They're right here.  Put it right there.  It's my area.  It's not messy, my area.  That's good.  Halls, you know, the road.  What's the poster you got there, Jim?  It's a signed poster of Belladonna someone sent me yesterday.  So it's right there.  It's rolled up.  You just got that.  That's been there for a week.  No, it hasn't.  It has.  Well, obviously no one reads the New York Times in here.  All right.  Are we all arranged?  Oh, my God.  We missed the obvious joke.  Eric on line one here from New York. 
[01:46:30]  He wants to explain what the sunscreen is for.  Go ahead, Eric.  Hey, guys.  The reason for the sunscreen in the studio is because Steve is there.  When Steve walks in, we have to put on our sunscreen.  Yes, I didn't even think about that.  You're right, sir.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Thank you.  SPF 35 for when Steve walks in.  What the hell are they showing on TV?  Wrestling.  No, look at the kid.  He has no arms.  He has no hands and no feet, and he's a wrestler. 
[01:47:00]  How is that possible?  How do you lose to that guy?  How embarrassing if you lose to him.  All right.  Well, let's get rid of more stuff here.  Top 10.  There's nothing to grab, though, with him.  You can't grab his arm.  You're disgusted.  You can't.  What are you going to grab?  You can't lock on his arm.  You do it, and he slips the stump right through.  That is disgusting looking.  He's got his nubs sticking out, and he's trying to grab you with him.  All right.  Here we go, guys.  Top 10 earning dead celebrities of the past year. 
[01:47:30]  Marilyn Monroe in 10th place, still making money.  Still making money.  What could she make money on?  I don't know.  Her image, I guess.  $8 million she made last year.  Pictures.  $8 million.  $8 million.  She's been dead for years.  Yeah.  9th place, Bob Marley, $9 million.  Still making a lot of cash.  Buying those reggae records.  Tupac made $12 million last year.  I thought he said dead celebrities.  Oh.  You're believing that he might be alive somewhere?  Tupac's not dead.  He's waiting. 
[01:48:00]  Tupac, $12 million.  $12 million he made last year.  He's dead.  Who gets that?  His mama.  Is it his mama?  Probably his mama.  Dale Earnhardt made $15 million last year.  $15 million, the intimidator.  Dr. Seuss is on the list.  He made $16 million last year.  From his polio vaccine, right?  George Harrison, in the first year of his death, made $16 million dead.  John Lennon, the anniversary passed yesterday, right? 
[01:48:30]  Right.  John Lennon, $19 million last year he made.  J.R.R. Tolkien, $22 million last year.  The Hobbit.  The runner-up for top-earning dead celebrity.  What?  Let me just guess it.  Charles Schultz.  $32 million he made last year.  From Charlie Brown.  Can I guess Elvis?  Of course it's Elvis.  Elvis continues to make a boatload of money even though he's dead.  Last year, the Elvis Presley estate made $40 million. 
[01:49:00]  What?  On what?  His songs?  Velvet paintings?  On all that stuff, yeah.  Tours of Graceland?  Tours of Graceland.  I'm just pulling stuff out of this pile.  Congrats.  Just, I don't even know what I'm pulling out.  A story we were going to do on Americans weighing down the cruise ship, Anthony.  Yeah.  Dozens of seats on the world's most luxurious cruise liner have collapsed under the weight 
[01:49:30]  of obese American passengers.  The Queen Mary, too?  Why are you in here?  Oh.  Ben just told me to walk in here.  Uh-oh.  Do you do everything that Ben tells you to do?  Yeah.  Why did you tell him to walk in here?  Ben messes with Steve all morning long.  Don't mess with Steve at all.  I said, why is he in here?  Why is he in here?  If Ben told you to wear a shirt with ice on it, would you do it?  No.  No, I wouldn't. 
[01:50:00]  I wouldn't.  Generally, if Ben comes and gets me, it's because I think that somebody else told him to  tell me.  We can't hear you.  We can't hear you.  The best is when he plays the theme song.  Steve doesn't have his headphones on.  I know, and he just talks over it.  So why is he in here?  No, Ben comes.  I just told him to come in here because you were throwing stuff away, and I don't know.  I just thought he was right out there.  He was right outside the door.  Do you want to get his shirt into it?  Yeah, Ben wanted some company for his misery.  Ope's kind of getting on you, Ben.  Yeah, usually when Ope starts coming down on Ben, Ben comes in and gets me. 
[01:50:30]  He goes, because if he's got two targets, it usually relieves the pressure.  Steve's also larger and bigger, so he can stand in between.  But Steve isn't responsible for any garbage.  This studio, first of all, at 4.20 this morning when I got in here, was relatively clean.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  Shut up, Jim.  Shut up.  Go fart in the elevator.  It was.  And Anthony comes in first out of the three of you guys.  Yeah, it was completely clean.  With the newspapers.  Yeah.  I will say there was nothing on this console. 
[01:51:00]  Well, then Steve's sunscreen and Jim's out.  What do you got there?  Tylenol and rollies.  Yeah, a little area I have.  A little Jimmy Norton's medical area.  Medical area.  A couple little things for the old sniffles.  I want to give a good performance on the show.  The chairs are on the Queen Mary, too.  Oh, yes.  And they're being replaced or repaired because fatties are breaking the seats.  The Limeys are all mad that we're breaking their chairs.  Right.  On their ship.  Exactly.  With our fat American asses.  Did Jim just give up on the radio show? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Or does he have a chess move to make?  Why is he playing chess during the radio show?  Jim has been playing chess during the show lately.  He runs out, makes a move, and comes back in.  Oh, that's okay.  He could stay out there.  What are you doing?  No, no.  I was just asking Steve to do.  I had a question for Steve.  I didn't want to say it in the studio.  What's wrong with everyone today?  I don't know.  I was trying to ask him to check something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't want to do it while you were talking.  Okay.  Because then you ought to get yelled at for talking while you were talking. 
[01:52:00]  I agree with the English, Opie.  I think Americans have big fat asses, and they shouldn't be breaking their deck chairs wholeheartedly.  Rob from Jersey.  Bring their own chairs like Leon Klinghofer.  You see how that works?  See?  I come back in after the story.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thanks for saving that one.  All right.  We can throw that story away.  Rob from Jersey wants us to play chestnuts roasting on a Steve shoe.  Did someone write that in yesterday? 
[01:52:30]  I think so.  Eric from Edison.  Stop this psycho-babbling bullshit and get on with the show.  If you want to clean, get your effing Polish maid to do it.  Wow.  That is true.  Yeah, you kind of come off a little obsessive.  Well, we can't find anything.  Doesn't it look a little neater now?  No, not in Ben's area.  No, Ben is...  Oh, boy.  Jim just hangs him out to dry.  I love Ben, but from the right over, it's very messy.  You know what it is? 
[01:53:00]  What is it that doesn't have anything to do with you over here?  I've got a bunch of things going on over here.  No, if I don't have any peripheral vision, it doesn't.  But I have to look that way when I'm looking at you, and sometimes I glance to you for a moment.  Do we have that story about the...  Which one now?  The baby's t-shirts?  Oh, I think so.  Somewhere in this pile.  Because I was laughing at the fact that they were outraged by the one that they used as an example.  Shocking awe for baby t-shirts?  Baby t-shirts.  Now, these kind of risque, kind of shocking t-shirts are available for little infants, for babies now. 
[01:53:30]  And they're kind of funny sayings.  With titles like Hot Babe, Mommy's Little Monster, D.Va, Cereal Killer.  Cereal spelt like cereal, like, you know, what you eat cereal.  10% soft spot, 90% bitch.  There you go.  Is that a shirt?  Yes, it is.  Well, according to me, now it is.  That's very funny.  I just chimed in with that and made it up.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  But, you know, I was reading their examples, and there's an outrage because of these shirts. 
[01:54:00]  But the examples they give are nothing compared to some of them I've seen.  Well, here's one that they're really pissed off at.  A t-shirt that says, bitch, better have my bottle.  Oh, that must get them angry.  And Sir Crapsalot.  Sir Crapsalot?  They're among the hottest sellers.  You don't like Sir Crapsalot?  No, I don't.  Just say Ben on it.  There's another baby t-shirt, Anthony. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  That says, my mom puts out.  Wow.  I like that.  Now, I've never seen these.  And then the mom is saying, but I'll bet my husband wishes it was true.  And the one that was tasteless, that one from California, there was only the one kid that wore it,  and it just said, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub, glub.  You're so obsessed. 
[01:55:00]  I don't really understand why, but you're so obsessed with that trial.  Thank God that trial is just about over.  What trial?  Thank God it's just about over.  It's a little.  And we can finally move on.  Is that the little shirt?  It's a little shirt, and you can wash it as many times as you want, and it won't shrink,  because it's used to being in the water.  Right.  And it's got a little arrow pointing one way and says, I'm with mommy who wouldn't shut up. 
[01:55:30]  No?  Oh.  And another t-shirt, Anthony, that says, where's all the bitches at?  Where's all the bitches at?  Now, you're saying these shirts are tame compared to the other ones that you've seen out there?  One of my favorite sites is t-shirthell.com.  Okay.  You ever go there?  No.  Very funny t-shirts.  And they have a whole baby section.  And these are much better than the ones they give examples for.  Imagine you're a little toddler wearing a shirt that says, now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice. 
[01:56:00]  Now, that's kind of funny.  I tore mommy a new one.  Another one reads, Chinese delicacy.  Do they cook, child?  Did you get this one, Anthony?  Now that I'm safe, I'm pro-choice.  Yes, that's the one I just read.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, because someone was distracting me.  Oh, my God, that's hysterical.  I have no idea.  No wonder you can't remember who made the mess.  What? 
[01:56:30]  Well, you guys don't understand.  During the radio show, I'm taking my headphones off, turning microphones off, giving instructions,  receiving communiques.  This one's cool.  I tore mommy a new one.  All right, I heard that one, you ass.  You're coming off as an insane person.  Yeah, today.  I know, but who's rolling?  Rolaids are these?  Rolaids in my studio!  You know, get the suntan lotion! 
[01:57:00]  You know there are times during the show I'm taking my headphones off, turning microphones  off, and trying to find other stuff to enhance some of these bits that we do.  Right.  So I got caught.  I got caught napping on that one.  I'm sorry.  How about this one?  Fuck the milk, where's the whiskey tits?  There you go.  You're a little toddler being...  Yeah, that's a real one.  You could buy it.  Did you say the one...  I pray you didn't.  They shake me?  No, I didn't say that.  Well, how funny is that as a shirt for you little kid?  That's a little crazy.  Kid walking around with a they shake me t-shirt. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  How about daddy drinks because I cry?  Did you do that one?  No, no, I didn't do that one.  I enjoy a good spanking.  Playground pimp.  Daddy's milk is saltier than mommy's?  Oh, that's not a t-shirt.  That is not a t-shirt.  This one has a big pot leaf on the front, and it's a little t-shirt for your baby, and  it says potty head.  You know, a little play on pot head.  Potty head. 
[01:58:00]  Did you read the one hung like a five-year-old?  That's very funny.  Daddy's lil squirt, and it says L-I-L.  It's spelled lil.  What about this one that just says broken condom?  Those are some funny shirts.  Oh, my IQ is higher than the president's.  The old I can kick your baby's ass.  Yeah, those are a little more offensive than the examples they gave. 
[01:58:30]  And I hide my crack in my diaper.  Oh, there's one from, this is a weird one.  If you're in Florida in 1981, don't lose your head.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Then there's ones, t-shirt hell is great.  They have t-shirts for everybody, not just for kids.  There are some really, really offensive ones. 
[01:59:00]  Arrest black babies before they become criminals.  I mean, that's what it says.  I thought it was a boss post.  Who the hell would get that?  This one, really offensive.  You know the I Love New York shirts?  Of course.  I Heart New York.  Yeah.  They have I, and then in place of the heart,  they have an airplane, a jet aircraft.  I Plane New York.  Yeah, people, I mean, this is a t-shirt hell,  and this is in the extreme section. 
[01:59:30]  But I would defy anyone to walk around wearing one of these.  Jesus did it for the chicks.  Abortions tickle.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  Great white kill, it's a headline on a shirt.  Great white kills every single one of its hundred fans.  Wow.  I swear, I didn't know she was three.  That's my favorite one. 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  I didn't know she was three.  If Asians were so smart, how'd they wind up with such tiny dicks?  Help stop rape consent.  Nice.  T-shirt hell.  There you go.  Oh, God.  I can't even read that one.  Why?  I found one I can't even read.  Really?  Norton, read it.  Where is it?  It's right here. 
[02:00:30]  Norton will take pleasure in reading it, I guarantee.  It's this one.  No.  He's laughing.  You're not going to read it?  Where's I going to read it?  I just did one.  Is it a ton?  Yeah.  Love him or hate him, Hitler killed a ton of Jews.  Holy yes.  Are you insane?  Who's walking around with that?  Yeah.  Byron.  Picture of Hitler.  Right.  Byron from yesterday. 
[02:01:00]  Sure.  Okay.  When is that going to be ready?  A couple minutes.  Okay.  What's going on here?  Well, now I'm going to talk on the air so then people know I'm not paying attention just  in case I get caught again instead of turning the mic off and doing what I do when things  happen.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I don't like all the secrets of this.  Nothing.  There's a reason it's a secret.  But I...  You know what?  If it's going to be a couple minutes, why don't we take a quick break?  All right.  Anthony, the listeners are requesting stuff to turn the free play people into subscribers. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know if this show is doing it, but...  My balls smell like Tara Reade.  That's funny on it.  Well, a lot of people are requesting because it's the holiday season.  Uh-huh.  There's no Santa.  Yes.  This is a cute little phone call that...  Should I be children listening, Opie?  That was done a few years back, Anthony.  Someone pissed me off, so I decided to do something in return.  Right.  Uh, yeah.  I was just listening to your station a little while ago. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  And I had my three-year-old son with me, and you guys were putting down the Santa Claus thing,  and all of this, your parents and all that.  Yeah.  And, you know, I was...  I like...  I love Opie and Anthony, you know, and I'm a faithful listener, but I had to change the  station.  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing parenting, that's called, when you change the station.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  I detect that you're a little pissed at us because we just said that there's no Santa Claus  on the air.  Well, it'd be one thing if it was, you know, a little later at night, and there wouldn't 
[02:02:30]  happen to have been someone's kid listening, you know?  Dude, I'd just save you the hassle.  Now you can get the credit for all those presents you bought for him.  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  He...  I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it because he was busy doing something  else.  Hey, what's your son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I talk to him real fast?  Uh, why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  You don't really talk much on the phone, but...  What's your wife saying in the background?  Oh, she wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but...  Oh, that...  Wait, wait.  Chill out.  Oh, I hope...  Okay, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone, those guys we were listening  to on the radio?  I'm on the floor first.  He's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for doing that?  I better talk to him and then smooth it over. 
[02:03:30]  Okay, well, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it.  Come here.  Come here.  Wait, let me get him on my lap.  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  It's your dad.  No.  Oh, no. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, no.  Heartless.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis. 
[02:04:30]  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What?  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to get you.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Sunday is my favorite day of the week, boys and girls. 
[02:05:00]  Sunday is the day you get out of bed.  Boom.  You go straight to the couch.  It's like brush my teeth.  Fuck it.  I'll eat something.  Cold my hair?  I don't think.  Cold.  Think I'm going to lay here all day and just scratch.  Eat a pickle for breakfast. 
[02:05:30]  Wash it down with cold beer.  Find something to scratch.  Walk around in your underwear like your dad.  Where's the TV guy?  Who's got the toenail clip?  You find them, you'll find the TV guy. 
[02:06:00]  Scariest part about watching your dad scratch his ass.  What do you get that look in his eye?  Like he found something new.  Found a remote control.  I'm going in for the clipper.  You ever wake up Sunday morning, them Saturday night cocktail ninja hangovers? 
[02:06:30]  You know the kind you wake up, like no two hairs in your head point the same direction?  Your hair's got that I've been fucking against the headboard look.  And you're alone.  Your dog has that look.  And backs out of the room crying. 
[02:07:00]  Take me to the pound!  Pet me my ass.  You all right?  A fart would kill you right now.  I fell in love with a girl on TV. 
[02:07:30]  I can't sleep and I can't eat.  I think she's really kind of groovy.  I just want to see her brand new movie.  I fell in love with a girl on TV.  Let's have a sleepover like Michael did.  I'll be Mr. Jackson.  You can't be the kid. 
[02:08:00]  Just like Ashlyn Kutcher is to Demi Moore.  I want you to be my little teenage whore.  I fell in love with a girl on TV.  And I can't get enough of Hillary Duff.  I want to be the first guy to stick it in her word.  They're friends with Duff.  I want to be just like R. Kelly.  I spray DNA all over her belly. 
[02:08:30]  I fell in love with Hillary Duff.  Never knew I could have this much affection.  Never knew the Disney Channel  could give me an erection.  Come in with nature. 
[02:09:00]  And Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Feel the love.  We have lost complete control of the O&A show. 
[02:09:30]  How's the chess game going outside?  Good.  You're at a major disadvantage playing Master Poe, by the way.  Why?  Because you're doing a radio show, and he studies the board while we're in here for a half hour.  Well, he's got security details.  No, he's studying the board, and then you have to go in between break and make quick moves.  There's no way.  He's got security details.  I don't know.  What are you even talking about?  I don't know.  Security details?  There is nothing that happens here on a daily basis. 
[02:10:00]  You're right.  We really have lost control of the show.  What's the problem?  Now we can't find something, because the person that knows where it is is somewhere else.  I think you have to eat something.  Yes.  I ordered food, yeah.  I forgot my food today.  Yeah, my blood sugar dropped.  I'm in another world right now.  You find it?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Are you feeling a little woozy, Opie?  I kind of am, actually.  I'm feeling a bit woozy.  It all started by getting up at two in the morning. 
[02:10:30]  My whole day is messed up now.  I need to get up at four.  I need to eat some food.  Then I need to eat more food when I get in here.  You graze all day.  I have to.  You're a grazer.  Yeah, you can eat like a little stupid Ritz cracker, and you're fine for the day.  I don't get that.  I have a stupid bagel and banana in the morning, and I'm fine until about three o'clock in  the afternoon.  I'm starting to think that we only do this from time to time.  I think the listeners need to just completely take over the show.  Really? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, I think they need to steer their ship now.  That could be dangerous.  Because we're in deep trouble.  We're two hours in, and we haven't done anything.  I think we did some stuff.  We talked about the...  And then there was that.  No, we talked about the shooting.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  We talked about Motley Crue and Tara Reid on the Billboard Awards.  Well, this should bring in the new subscribers.  Is that it?  No, Ben's looking for it. 
[02:11:30]  Ben said he found it.  Did he lie to the boss?  Oh, he said he found it?  Yeah.  Oh, well, he said Eric told him where it was, and now he can't find it where Eric said  it was.  All right, so we can't do that yet.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  That would have saved us, too.  That would have saved us.  It would have been kind of cute and wacky.  Did laptops ban for sperm?  That was good.  When Eric leaves the building, nothing can be found.  Where's Eric?  Oh. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Eric is nowhere.  Will you guys shut up?  No, no, no.  You're going to ruin it.  Hey, you forgot that Dick Clark did have a stroke.  I think we talked about that.  Yes, we did.  Yep.  Crossed that off the list.  A little bit.  How about the, uh...  Laptops or Bed for Sperm?  We did that.  Yeah, I'm wondering, was there any kind of list of worst Christmas songs?  I've been thinking lately, like, I would love to just talk about that for a little while.  If there's a list, there's probably not, though, is there?  We don't have number four.  We're trying to find number four.  Number four in a what amount of song list?  The top five worst Christmas songs of all time. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, is that what you're looking for?  I actually did not know that.  Can we go five, three, two, one, and get to four when we get it?  I guess.  I think that Dick Clark's going to do it this year with an old stroke lip.  Do you have it now?  Did you take it away from me?  Five, three, two, one, four.  He can't hurt me.  I'm sorry.  I stepped below that part of this.  That's okay.  That was awful.  I stepped up here.  I know that's the one we were looking for.  Where was it?  Was it over here in this pile? 
[02:13:00]  It's right here.  What a goddamn mess.  Oh, my God.  It's right there.  That's right by...  Why didn't someone hand that to the boss?  And Ben said he found it.  And you said he didn't find it.  It was sitting right there.  And he was the one looking over there.  I'm not...  He said that Eric knew where it was.  Now, Eric is downstairs dealing with a management issue.  And he said that that was right there on the table.  So how come Eric didn't tell Ben and point it right there?  Someone lied to Opie, and I don't like it.  I'm wondering what took Opie so long to find it right next to Opie. 
[02:13:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Thank you.  Get Ben in here.  I'm not taking the blame for this.  I don't like...  I think you need to eat.  I said...  I admitted that openly.  I'm sure there's some Opie under here somewhere.  I'm praying.  I think you're feeling a little woozy today.  I'm very woozy.  Did I tell you it all started when I woke up at 2 in the morning?  You found this, right?  Ben Sparks.  It wasn't sitting here the whole time, right?  Yeah, it was sitting there right...  I said that to you.  I said, there it is.  And you said, no, that's the wrong one.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You did. 
[02:14:00]  You did.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  You all right?  I'm fine.  What?  Where are we?  Let's make sure.  Top five worst Christmas songs of all time.  What, Ben?  Nothing.  All right.  Okay.  I don't like when people point out your mistakes, though.  I don't think that's proper on the air.  It wasn't there the whole time.  I know that's perfect.  I don't think it was either.  But it was found, and then it was placed here. 
[02:14:30]  Yep.  What was it found?  Huh?  What was it found?  We have to start with number six, actually.  Do they have number six in the other room?  He's got it.  Mm-hmm.  It's really uncomfortable around here.  What?  I don't know.  All right.  The top six worst Christmas songs of all time.  Now, who's judging these to be the worst?  This was according to the New York Post.  These are songs that people hate hearing around the holidays.  They Hate the Most, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  In Sixth Place, it's a song that we talked about a couple days ago.  Elmo and Patsy.  Ugh.  And this fine number, Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.  This is awful.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Ugh.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  Was this even funny for five minutes?  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  Now, the plot thickens.  She's been drinking too much eggnog. 
[02:15:30]  And we begged her not to go.  Uh-oh.  What's going to happen?  But she forgot her medication.  Yeah.  And she staggered out the door into the snow.  Oh.  Not that one.  When we found her Christmas morning.  The other one now.  Someone threw a turkey at her face.  No?  She had hoof cramps on her forehead.  Oh.  And incriminating dog marks on her back. 
[02:16:00]  Oh.  She'd been raped in the bushes.  Grandson got drowned by a reindeer.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  CP in the house.  As for me and Connor, we believe.  Now we're all so proud of Grandson.  All right.  Well, that's number six, Anthony.  Going fishing early this morn. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's number six.  And he's got a guppy nibbling at his toes.  Incriminating flounder marks on his feet.  Dum, dum, dum.  Connor got rowed by a rowboat.  Silly goose left the blonde hair in the rowboat.  Rowing home from fishing Christmas Eve. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  We're looking at the six worst Christmas songs of all time, Anthony.  And fifth place is this fine number.  Mm-hmm.  The house next door to me's been sold to niggers.  They claim to be wild Indians from the plains. 
[02:17:30]  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Oh, but they ain't a-shucking me there, colored people.  Wow.  We'll make cowboys and niggers our new game.  I don't believe that's the Christmas song.  Last night when I come home, I don't believe that's a Christmas song, Opie.  No, I don't think so either.  I think you have number five, don't you, over there?  I'm sorry.  Do I have it?  Number five.  That was obviously a mistake.  All right.  Here it is. 
[02:18:00]  The fifth worst Christmas song of all time.  All right.  The internet is more porn.  The internet is more porn.  Trap.  Hit me up all night, hugging me.  Porn to porn.  Porn.  Porn.  All right.  Stop, Anthony.  Yeah.  I got it over here.  All righty.  The fifth worst Christmas song of all time.  Is this the Singing Dogs, I think? 
[02:18:30]  Billy Squire?  I don't know.  Shoot it!  Oh!  We hate all shit dicks!  Andy Warhol?  Shoot it!  Mick Jagger?  Shoot it!  Michael Jackson?  Shoot it!  Yeah!  Jeffrey Dahmer?  Cannibal?  Shit dick!  Yeah! 
[02:19:00]  We ain't shit dicks!  Yeah!  I don't think that's a Christmas song, are we?  No, I don't think so. 
[02:19:30]  I enjoy listening to a good rendition of shit.  I'm sorry, my blood sugar is dropping, I thought that made the list, but I guess not.  What's the number five song, Opie?  Well, the number five song...  Grandma got run over by a shit dick.  We found corn and peanuts in her hair.  Oh, God, I almost lost it through my nose.  All right, let's get control back in the show here, Anthony.  We got it.  It's the top six worst songs during the holiday season. 
[02:20:00]  And coming in at number five, it's some friends of ours, actually.  This is real.  It's Joey Balls and Carmen Uch.  They used to do the Yankees' How You Doing song.  Well, they made the list.  How you doing?  Worst Christmas songs of all time.  Number five, it's Guido Christmas.  12 days of Guido Christmas.  Hey, Joe Balls, Merry Christmas.  Oh, Carmen Uch.  I heard you sold your noots.  Yeah, my Paisan.  Let me tell you what he got me this year.  On the first day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me a ride in his Iroxie. 
[02:20:30]  I love that car.  On the second day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Iroxie.  On the third day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me all three godfathers, two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Iroxie.  On the fourth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me four fresh cannolis, all three godfathers, 
[02:21:00]  two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Iroxie.  I can't take it anymore.  On the fifth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis, all three godfathers, two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Iroxie.  Shut up!  Shut up!  On the sixth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me six Sergio Dikinis, five pinky rings. 
[02:21:30]  Four fresh cannolis, all three godfathers, two guinea teas.  And a ride in his Iroxie.  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  On the sixth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me seven Piazza Dikinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis, all three godfathers, two guinea teas. 
[02:22:00]  And a ride in his Iroxie.  All right, coming in fifth place, one of the worst Christmas songs of all time, Joey  Balls and Carmen Uch, 12 Days of Guido, Christmas.  Quiet.  Can I tell you, that turn it off clip will make me laugh whenever it's played.  Oh, I love it.  You've got to see the movie, though, when he's just sitting in that movie theater chair watching  his daughter get pounded in a porno movie.  Turn it off.  Like, at first, turn it off.  Listen to it without anything over it. 
[02:22:30]  Because it's just, the first one is, he's just disgusted, but he's trying to hold it  together.  Turn it off.  But he just loses it.  She's with two guys in the movie, by the way.  One's tagging her in the ass, and then she's blowing the other one.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off! 
[02:23:00]  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  His little girl.  Why is he laughing through that, though?  Turn it off!  Look at the way she's taking it on the chair.  All right, Anthony.  The fourth worst Christmas song of all time.  Yes.  According to New York Post readers, I guess.  It's good old Barbra Streisand.  Babs.  Singing Shingle Bells. 
[02:23:30]  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, yeah.  She messed up the song.  With that vast motion.  Crap singing she does.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What fun it is to sing a slaying song tonight.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride.  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up! 
[02:24:00]  You shut up!  Shut up!  I thought I'd take a ride  And soon Miss Fanny Bright  Was seated by my side  All right, enough of that, enough of that.  Barbra Streisand, Jingle Bells, Anthony.  Yeah.  Fourth worst Christmas song of all time.  Chicka, chicka, chicka.  This is horrible.  Brian in Jersey, what's up?  Yo, guys, that Greedo song was the funniest goddamn thing I've ever heard.  Funny?  Really?  That song rolled.  No, no, you didn't mean it was funny. 
[02:24:30]  Like you laughed.  You mean it's funny that somebody would actually think it's funny?  No, I laughed my balls off when I heard that song.  No, you didn't.  Oh, where are you from?  Jersey.  Oh, that explains it.  All tree godfathers.  What, did you grab your ribs?  All right, thank you, Brian.  Hey.  Moving on with the list, worst songs of all time.  Speaking of godfathers, my favorite scene was when they brought in Connor Peters' vest with a fish in it.  What the hell is this? 
[02:25:00]  I just want to know why.  I just want to know why the obsession over this trial.  And, whoa, Connor Petersen, I just don't understand.  The little vest.  A little diaper with a fish in it.  Please make me understand.  With one of those cheddar cheese goldfish crackers in it.  I just want to understand.  Little tiny goldfish. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay, godfathers.  In third place, Anthony, worst Christmas songs of all time.  Yes.  Another version of Jingle Bells sung by the singing dogs.  Oh, I love when you go to a family's house and it's playing in the background. 
[02:26:00]  What a jolly and festive.  Here, boy.  Here, boy.  Here, boy.  Where'd the dogs go?  Musical interlude.  How do you have a musical interlude in the doggy song on the little Casio?  Is this Barbara Streisand again? 
[02:26:30]  Come here, boy.  Come here.  There you go, you little son of a bitch.  Dude.  Brian from the Bronx, what's up?  Brian from Brooklyn, actually.  Oh, Brooklyn, I'm sorry.  No problem, no problem.  Brooklyn in the hizzy.  I'm calling about the remarks Brian from Jersey made about the Guido 12 Days of Christmas.  Yeah.  That song was hysterical.  Since I heard I was riding the IROC Z, I couldn't take it. 
[02:27:00]  I almost crashed my car.  And you should have if you laughed at that.  Oh, I get it, because the IROC is Italian.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet you they're all Italian things they say in the song.  Yeah, yeah.  Four cannolis.  Hey, I'm going to hear that, right, Jimmy?  I'm sorry, buddy?  Oh, my God.  My food is here.  Thank you, Brian.  One question.  Yeah.  What are you doing the eggnog for the Mindfly?  Oh, next Friday, right?  How are we going to get contestants for the eggnog contest?  Email Ben and Steve. 
[02:27:30]  Email Ben and Steve.  Where are those email addresses?  By the way, if you have anything...  OpenAnthony.com.  Foundry.  All right.  Yeah, OpenAnthony.com.  And if you have anything that you want to add to the program, like music files or sound  clips and all that, all that should be sent to Steve at FoundryMusic.com, okay?  Four cannolis, all tree godfathers.  Hey, huh?  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Pool glasses of Anazette.  Yuck.  All right.  We're counting down the worst songs of all time this holiday season, Anthony?  Does Steve...  Whoa, hey. 
[02:28:00]  Steve's email, is that a Hotmail account?  Or does he use...  What does he use?  I think his computer is Firewire.  Firewire?  Does he have a firewall up?  Is it hard to get him files?  Oh, now we got a problem.  What's the matter?  What happened to the potatoes?  You always liked potatoes.  That's not new.  I need the potatoes.  Potatoes.  I need the carbohydrates.  Five potatoes.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Danny, you forget the potatoes? 
[02:28:30]  Boss is not happy, Danny.  Did you forget?  I'm sorry, sir.  It's all right.  I can go and get more if you'd like.  Do you need more money?  It'll take two seconds.  What'd you give me anyway?  I don't even remember.  Oh, here.  Don't ask Opie that.  I think I gave you someone else's change.  I gave you a sausage.  All right, relax, Steve.  It's not that funny.  Heat miser.  Shut up.  Heat miser.  All right.  Well, I'm going to have to wait for the potatoes.  The blood sugar continues to drop.  Wow.  I'm in a bad state right now.  You better get that up there.  Okay. 
[02:29:00]  Do you have some more napkins with that, too?  Jesus.  Are your eggs on there, period?  There's no reason for stacking napkins that high.  Yeah, you're going to pay for this shit for all those free players out there.  All right.  So the runner-up for the worst Christmas song of all time, Anthony.  Do you remember the band Seymour Swine and the Squealers?  Um, when they were shooting at their gig last night.  No?  I don't know.  I don't know that band.  Funny story.  Oof. 
[02:29:30]  Love when I swing and miss.  It's so funny.  The silence.  Wow.  It's like, oof.  See, I didn't know the band's name last night, and I have no clue who they are, and  it might as well be, but let me explain it.  Oh.  Wow.  Well, bye.  I'm sure you'll recognize the song, Anthony.  Hey, here comes that joke.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  You'll remember this.  Here comes the show.  Oh, I'm telling that joke.  Get out of the way.  Stop.  No, please.  Dunk.  All right.  Seymour what?  Swine and the Squealers.  Never.  You'll recognize this song.  Here it is.  The runner-up.  For worst song.  Wait, wasn't there a fire at their show in Rhode Island?  Here it is.  Blue Christmas. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Blue Christmas.  Stay long.  Stay long.  All right.  I think we all know who's going to have a blue Christmas this year.  It'll be decorations of red on a green Christmas tree. 
[02:31:00]  Have a blue fish Christmas.  It won't be the same, dear.  If you're not here with me and when those blue.  Yeah, this could really get on your nerves.  Yeah.  It's no flames.  It's dark falling.  It'll be the answer. 
[02:31:30]  This song is almost as annoying as a dirty console.  All right, all right.  The runner-up for worst Christmas song of all time.  There you have it.  Blue Christmas.  That was just the runner-up?  Yeah, that was the runner-up.  Six pairs of cement shoes.  Pete from PA, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, how you doing here, sweet bit?  Hi, fella.  Hey, I just wanted to know if the dogs were barking that tune when they were looking for  sound at Preeti's in the lake.  First of all, you know, that lake called, what, the Pacific Ocean? 
[02:32:00]  You idiots.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  That little body of water?  Yeah.  You know.  I'm surprised they found him in that little hidden alcove.  I love looking at the cops with their little dogs in wetsuits searching the ocean floor  for bodies.  Yeah.  Yeah, they sniff on the ocean floor.  I realized that would just be repeating your jokes, which got a laugh, so I might as well  just repeat it.  All right.  Well, Mark has a question. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, Mark?  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Mark?  Hey, it's Mark.  I guess that song was...  The 12 Days of Guido Christmas, yeah.  Yeah, the Christmas song, the Guido Christmas.  I just want to know what the other six were.  Yeah, people seem to...  I don't know.  I'm getting a lot of calls and emails that people actually liked it and want to know what  the rest of it is.  Well, I thought the Camaro one was hysterical, the IROC beat.  I love the IROC gun.  Yeah, that was a good one, because they drive IROCs. 
[02:33:00]  I bet the other six things are kind of tied into a tie-in where you go, oh, yeah, I like  that.  All right.  You know what?  I guess we might have to play the whole damn song going into break in a little while.  I don't think I can stand the whole song, but I just want you to read what they say.  Why?  Eight pieces of ziti.  Well, if we have to listen to the song to find out the other six, then, you know, you  guys got to suffer along with us.  Yeah, that's true.  We'll all suffer along together to find out what the other six goddamn days are.  Nine bowls of pasta vizool.  Yes. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  Well, we might have to play the whole thing.  Where's that CD?  All right, Anthony.  Okay, thanks, Ben.  Wow, that was quick.  No, no, no, but we have to do that first.  We still have to do the number one song.  I know, Ben.  Why don't you stop?  All right, Anthony.  The worst Christmas song of all time.  So excited.  We're down to number one.  To the New York Post.  Ben seems excited, too.  Look at those jeans.  Oh, sorry.  You're just normal.  Can't tell if Ben's hard or soft. 
[02:34:00]  You know what you can tell is if he lays on his back and it kind of stands half up.  Sorry, Ben.  I know you're uncomfortable when we talk about that meaty anomaly.  John from Jersey.  What's up?  Christmas tree.  Hey, since the weather's going to be so shitty here at Christmas, I'm going to take my wife  on the Connor Peterson cruise.  Why is this obsession spreading?  Oh, my potatoes are here.  They were saying that fat American babies on the cruise ships were breaking their little  cribs.  Do you want to tie into another one? 
[02:34:30]  Thank you, Danny.  That's a big thing of potatoes, Danny.  Ooh.  Where's the hot sauce I asked for?  Hot sauce?  We have the hot sauce here.  Ben pours it on.  Maybe that would explain why your stomach is a soupy disaster.  You're having eggs with hot sauce at 6 a.m.  You put hot sauce on stuff this early in the morning?  No, I do it.  I put it on the potatoes when I get them.  You do?  We have a very nice selection of hot sauces here.  Condiments?  Do we have nice condiments?  You got one that's not too hot, kind of like flavorful?  You don't have, like, Tabasco's too hot. 
[02:35:00]  Red hot is perfect.  Danny?  Oh, what's that?  Danny?  That's what I asked.  Danny?  What the hell is this?  How about some hot sauce?  Spray it on.  There you go.  You'll get nothing and like it.  Very nice.  And I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.  You'll get nothing and like it, Spalding.  Eat your potatoes, Spooky.  All right.  Number one?  Yes.  Number one worst song of all time, according to the New York Post. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  You're going to recognize this fine ditty.  Okay.  You are no good.  You are a fucking asshole.  You are a real jerk.  You are a miserable creep.  You are a good finessly scally wave. 
[02:36:00]  Scally wave.  You bring me damaging disharmony in my life by cussing at me for no reason at all.  I don't think that's the number one annoying Christmas song, worst Christmas song. 
[02:36:30]  No.  No, that is not it.  I believe I have it over here.  You have the worst Christmas song of all time.  Yeah.  Number one.  The numero uno worst Christmas song.  Numero uno worst Christmas song.  Well, play it already.  Number one.  I'm trying.  Go ahead.  Play it.  You said you have it.  Here it is.  All right.  Start the song.  I'm trying.  You want me to start the song?  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Start the song.  You said you have it.  Is that it?  No.  Go ahead, wiseass.  Play the...  No, that's not it.  Why don't you play the worst Christmas song of all time?  Go ahead.  Right?  No.  That's not the bitches that'll get you.  The bitches that'll get you?  No.  No?  No?  Anthony, I'll save you.  I actually...  No, that couldn't be it.  I actually have it over here.  Of course you do.  The worst Christmas song.  All the final comments. 
[02:37:30]  That's not it either.  That's a Hanukkah song.  The worst Christmas song of all time.  Voted by the New York Post readers.  Freddy was a boy made a big noise rolling in the sheets.  I'm not going to die one day.  God, come on his face.  Big disgrace.  Shaking his ass all over the place.  AIDS will, AIDS will kill you. 
[02:38:00]  It was festive.  Yeah.  Eggs will, AIDS will kill you.  Eggs will kill you.  This is right here.  Lots of cholesterol in them.  Huh?  Huh?  He got blood on his face.  Big disgrace.  This dirty little faggot's been put into his place.  AIDS will, AIDS will kill you.  AIDS will, AIDS will kill you. 
[02:38:30]  Everybody.  AIDS will, AIDS will kill you.  Faggot's!  All right.  That's not the worst song of all time, Anthony.  Of course not.  I'm all excited now to hear what it is.  All right.  This gag is getting old.  The worst Christmas song of all time.  Ever, Opie.  What?  Ever.  Of all time?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's Eric Cartman and South Park.  I love this song. 
[02:39:00]  This is the worst.  This is the best.  Oh, Holy Night.  It's a good one.  It's haunting. 
[02:39:30]  It's haunting.  It's haunting.  Jesus was born.  Jesus was born and So I give presents.  Thank you Jesus for being born.  A bond in your land 
[02:40:00]  A bond in your land  Yet to be  A bond in your land  A bond in your land  Be my land  With a gift of love  There you have it, the worst Christmas song of all time, Eric Cartman, South Park, Oh Holy Night. 
[02:40:30]  What? What's wrong?  I don't know if that was the worst.  Well, these lists are always stupid.  That's why we try to make them a little fun when we don't. 
[02:41:00]  A classic.  All right, let's suffer through the entire 12 days of Guido Christmas so I can get my blood sugar level up.  Yee.  Well, they want to know what the other six days are.  Ah.  If we have to suffer through it, they have to suffer through it.  That's the rules with this show.  All right, eh?  All tree godfathers.  Squiz.  Don't you turn to Squiz.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  Just pull it. 
[02:41:30]  What?  No, sorry.  Who?  I was just going to tell people to pull their cars over.  People always say they laugh so hard they almost crashed.  Oh, that's right.  Almost crashed my rug Z.  It's actually speed up.  And if you're tempted to laugh at this, please, I hope you do hit something.  You know, someone is requesting play Come Sail Away from Cartman.  That thing is hilarious.  Do you have a little taste of that, or is it, you could, what?  He, what?  He's talking in the booth.  He, uh, he's in the fishbowl.  All right, he's going to look for it.  In the meantime, here it is.  The 12 days of Guido Christmas from Kamenuch.  And the other guy, uh, what? 
[02:42:00]  No, the other guy.  Remember, it's an Italian thing.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe Bulls, Merry Christmas.  Kamenuch.  I heard you saw G-news.  Yeah, my Paisan.

Ten new hand gestures, nine balls a-grabbing.  Eight, how you doing?  Seven Piazza jerseys.  Six Sergio zucchinis.  Five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis, all three godfathers, two guinea teas. 
[02:45:30]  And I'll ride in his eye, Roxy.  On the twelfth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me.  You'll never know.  Forget it.  You'll never know!  Oh, he just smashed the CD.  Yeah.  Yeah, you didn't need to know that.  You didn't need to know?  Who cares, right?  Who cares, exactly. 
[02:46:00]  Just wonder what the twelfth day was as we go to break.  Good afternoon.  Hi, I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your, uh, pleasure menu.  Pin it, pin it.  Ugh.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome. 
[02:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Which, uh, makes it hard to, uh, communicate.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  You need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay, well, house minimum starts at $100, so that's for a basic one-activity party.  A hundred?  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start, and then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the  ladies are independent con directors.  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon. 
[02:47:00]  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good, good.  So I could come down and, uh, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone. 
[02:47:30]  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I  could get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh.  Do you take...  Mastercard?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start... 
[02:48:00]  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  Work your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have jungle fever.  Do you have any black girls?  We have black ladies. 
[02:48:30]  We have Asian ladies.  We have oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't.

We're about to begin the O&A show for today. 
[02:53:00]  You ate?  Yeah, I ate.  Welcome back to the show.  What do you mean?  Good morning, Opie.  I've been here the whole time, no?  Um, all right.  Feeling much better, Anthony?  Yes, thank you.  Got your energy level back up?  Yeah, I just messed up this whole day.  I messed it up.  I'm sorry.  A little more organized now?  You feel a little better?  Feel pretty good, yeah.  Blood sugar levels rising, yes?  Good, good. 
[02:53:30]  How was that 12 days of Guido Christmas?  Well, the listeners, they're speculating a little bit.  Why would they speculate?  Mike from Orlando, uh, well, why are they speculating?  Yeah, what happened?  Perhaps you shut it off right at the 12th day, so no one knows what the 12th day was.  No, I was, I listened to the whole song, and then I left the studio, I took a leak, and  here we are back.  In your world.  What are you talking about?  Well, people never heard the 12th day.  Really?  So they have no clue. 
[02:54:00]  So Mike from Orlando wants to know if the 12th day is the lost Spuds Buckley tapes.  They don't exist.  No?  No, no, of course not.  That was a long time ago.  Oh, Mike again, saying, wait, I know what the 12th day is.  It's, uh, Tony Danza's Thoughts and Prayers.  That's Italian, huh?  Hey, Thoughts and Prayers.  Hmm.  Let's see, uh, Nick, Nick the Shwoogie is saying, uh, now take that CD out and set it on Steve. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  I only wish Joey Balls and Carmen Uch were opening up for damage plan last night.  Oh.  Uh, then we got James in Hicksville.  Opie was saying how he calmed down yesterday.  Sounds like when his blood sugar is low, he turns into the Hulk and starts smashing CDs  like the old days.  But I guess otherwise, he's just Bill Bixby.  What is that buzz? 
[02:55:00]  There's cell phones in here.  We gotta stop with the cell phones.  Every time someone gets a call, it buzzes and you can hear it.  Yeah, they don't cause tumors.  You just hear that.  Not the tumor.  You guys are all worried about, uh, the cell phones and the tumors because you're on them  24 hours a day, you guys.  I'm on my cell phone.  No, Jimmy, you're not?  No, no, no, no.  I'm on my cell phone four hours a day, easily.  Easily.  What was your bill last month?  My bill is whatever my plan is.  I never go over my minutes. 
[02:55:30]  I never do either.  And I'll wear the headphone when I have to or I'll keep it like a one minute call to check  my message and I hold it away from my head until I'm actually, like I'll dial it away  from my head until I actually have to.  Just hear the message quick, turn it off.  What happened?  He didn't get arrested, did he?  No.  Okay.  Ben, how much is your phone bill?  The last one?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was about 900 bucks.  $900 for his cell phone, Ben.  Well, no, no, no, here's the problem.  Who has a tumor?  Wait, wait, wait.  He's got a tumor in his lap.  Ben, who are you talking to besides not a barber?  Well, the problem is, is that I didn't have a phone line here and then the XM cell phone, 
[02:56:00]  the reception sucks because no one could ever hear me.  So I had to use my own phone all the time.  You could be, no, no, no.  There's no excuse for a $900 phone, but you could be dead.  It doesn't matter how many phones you don't have.  All of them added together shouldn't equal $900.  Does the Center for Genital Elephantitis really take that long to talk to?  You know, I heard Ben even gave the repayment $100 to take the clicking out of the line.  And when are we going to get $900 worth of guests on this radio show, by the way? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  That's a good point.  You're making those calls?  Maybe when I have a phone line.  Now that I have a phone line.  All right.  Hopi, how much was your phone bill?  Your cell bill?  No, I'm not stupid.  I pay one rate, and it's unlimited.  Oh, you got the one rate.  And you don't go over it?  No.  You can.  It's unlimited.  Oh, unlimited.  I could talk to L.A. for 10 hours, and it's not going to affect my plan.  Whatever.  Wow.  What do you pay for that?  I don't know.  A lot?  I don't know.  It's probably got to be a lot.  I think it's like $200. 
[02:57:00]  For unlimited.  A year?  No, a month.  A year.  A month.  But I only have one phone now.  I got rid of all the other phones.  It doesn't matter what your phone bill is, though, man.  The money you're saving on this last couple of weeks of free O&A play on XN?  That's true.  For the last couple of days.  Put it toward your phone bill.  All right.  Let's say hi to George in Jersey.  George, what's up?  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning.  Hey, was that song, 12 Pieces of Lil' Connor Peterson?  All right.  Listen.  Wow.  Why?  I just want to know why.  Because it's just a name. 
[02:57:30]  I just want to know why the obsession that is now spreading to the listeners, Anthony.  Just explain it to me.  That's all I asked.  Today.  Listen to my nose.  Yeah, what happened to you?  I took Afrin the other night for the first time in, like, weeks.  Listen to him.  This is me talking.  You were fine one minute ago.  That's the way it works.  It just wears off, and then your sinuses are re-stuffed.  I was a little congested.  I couldn't sleep. 
[02:58:00]  Now this is me.  I'm trying to weed myself off it.  How does this sound?  I'm not doing this on purpose.  Please take it.  No, I just want to talk to you.  No, it's awful.  Why?  It's fine.  What do you take that stops that?  More Afrin.  Oh, what do you spray it in your nose?  Yeah, and what happens is...  Do you have some on you?  Yes, I do.  Could you please use it?  No, I don't think it's good for me.  I think this is the new Jim Norton.  You have sex with hookers without condoms.  Don't worry about things being safe for you.  You're right.  Good point.  I'm trying to take some... 
[02:58:30]  I'm trying to take some...  Can we start the radio show now, please?  You're all blocked up.  Yeah, I know.  Can we start the show?  Oh, the show's been going for almost three hours.  Some people think.  Yeah, sure.  That's right.  Twelve sniffs of Afrin.  Oh, shit.  You better take some.  Wow.  It'll wear off.  It takes a day.  It takes a day, and then you'll be fine again.  All right, we're going to have to listen to that.  I'm weaning myself off it.  Yeah?  How about some support from my friends?  You know, Tyson's in trouble.  I support you.  Tyson Walter?  What happened? 
[02:59:00]  No, no, no, no.  What happened to Mike?  Mike Tyson is in trouble again.  He's having a lot of problems.  What happened to I and Mike Tyson?  Well, we have to go back.  Another story we could clean up.  Um, Tyson is now living in what?  In Arizona?  Are you living in Arizona, Mike?  I live in Arizona.  That's a state that's in the, I believe it's in the upper Midwest.  I know my geometry. 
[02:59:30]  No, it's really, no.  It's in the upper Midwest.  No, it's not even close, Mike.  Arizona.  It's not even close to the upper Midwest.  I'm a homer in Arizona.  I and Mike is making a joke.  You better laugh, motherfucker.  It's a very funny joke, as a matter of fact.  Yes.  These tattoos on my face were supposed to be a joke, too.  I must have been drunk.  You must have been.  Well, your career is in shambles, Mike.  Shambles?  After that last...  Is that near Arizona?  No, no.  My career's in shambles, and I'm in Arizona. 
[03:00:00]  Shouldn't I be in shambles, too?  With my career?  It's in shambles ever since you lost that fourth-round knockout to the British guy, that journeyman, Danny Williams.  You remember fighting him?  Did you see the fight?  Yes, I did.  I don't remember going into the ring.  You did not look good, and you got knocked out.  I got knocked the fuck out!  You got knocked out, Mike.  And now they're saying you're very depressed.  Very depressed.  They're saying you're abusing cocaine.  Yeah.  And you're running up...  Well, abuse is such a strong word. 
[03:00:30]  You know, it's hard for me to abuse anything.  I'm a casual user of cocaine.  But because my nose is so big, I have to do so much.  So people say I'm abusing it.  Spell abuse.  Abuse.  E...  No, it's not E.  L, the number 8, Q.  No, it's...  Abuse.  It starts with an A, but...  All right, well...  It starts with an A, like, where I live. 
[03:01:00]  Scottsdale.  Well, okay, sure.  So you're abusing the cocaine, and you're running up debts with shady associates while living in Phoenix, Arizona, with your girlfriend, Shelly.  The mother of your two-year-old son.  That bitch could take a punch.  I love it.  She mouths off.  Mouth.  M.  Oh, that's right.  M-O-F.  Mouth.  No, it's not. 
[03:01:30]  See, Iron Mike is getting more edumacated as the years go on.  So your life is in shambles, and now they're saying in the paper today...  What are they saying in the paper today?  Well, I don't know what they're saying, because that's not in front of me either.  Hold on, Mikey.  What are they saying in the paper about Iron Mike?  I got it.  ...that I punched my tiger in the testicle?  I had to sell my tigers.  You had to sell your tigers, too?  Yeah, I got to sell everything.  I'm broke.  Well, they're saying...  I've been hanging with the wrong niggas.  You were arrested last night on suspicion of misdemeanor criminal damage for allegedly jumping on the hood of a car outside of a city nightclub? 
[03:02:00]  Allegedly.  What's the story there, Mike?  Well, it's allegedly, which means I might not have done it, but I did.  You did do it, right?  Yeah.  He frightened me.  Aren't there signs in this amusement park that says,  Do not roll windows down while driving through Lion Country safari?  Yeah.  Well, you know, they rolled the window down.  They taunted Mike with a little treat. 
[03:02:30]  So I jumped up on his hood and ripped off his windshield wiper.  They snapped some pictures and laughed.  Luckily, there wasn't in a convertible.  Well...  Convertible.  Yeah.  R.  No!  Nine.  And the symbol for Mercury.  Even close.  And they're saying you dented the hood of this car.  Well, look at me.  Of course I dented it.  Yeah, but you didn't see what happened after. 
[03:03:00]  Were you jumping up and down like it was luggage?  Yeah, I was jumping up and down like he was driving a piece of Samsonite luggage.  But that's nothing compared to what I did after.  Afterwards, you know what I did?  Hmm.  I jumped through subway tracks and picked up a big subway train and cracked it open and ate some of the people inside.  No.  Then I grabbed a hot blonde and I climbed up the Empire State Building and swatted at some biplanes.  That wasn't you. 
[03:03:30]  That was King Kong.  I went,  And then rat-a-tat-tat started shooting me.  And then I fell all the way down to the sidewalk.  And then some guy came over and said,  It was beauty killed the beast.  Beauty.  How do you spell beauty?  Beauty.  F.  C.  And the logo for XM Satellite Radio.  Beauty. 
[03:04:00]  Well, there's more details here.  You were leaving a nightclub at 1 a.m.  I was?  Yes.  Okay.  And this car stopped to let you cross the street.  Arrgh.  And all of a sudden, you decided to start screaming and yelling at the guy.  And then you jumped on the hood of this guy's car, on your hands and knees, and began to pound on it.  You see how I pounce?  Yeah.  I was trying to impress a female of my species across the street.  So I pounce up and down and grab bushes and throw them. 
[03:04:30]  You got one of those nice, big, red asses to show off.  My teeth and my big, red, mandrel ass as I jumped around.  Yeah, that gets the ladies.  They didn't say, you know, no newspapers reported what he was doing that annoyed Mike so much.  You know, he sounded like he was just driving, but his buddies was pissing me off.  Why?  They were following behind me, taking plaster casts of my footprints and selling them. 
[03:05:00]  What is Sasquatch?  I've never heard such terms.  Sasquatch.  B-R-U-L-C-T.  You don't even have to attempt to spell that one.  Print page.  Print page?  I'll spell it on the typewriter.  Isn't that how it's done?  Well, okay.  L-O-Y shift.  All right.  More info here, Mike.  Oh, I don't know how much more info Mike's brain could take. 
[03:05:30]  Well, the valet who witnessed this said that you were intoxicated and you were falling  over and slurring as you were crossing the street.  But that wasn't Mike's fault.  Why?  Everybody thinks Mike's fault that I was slurring my speech and falling down.  But minutes earlier, a Land Rover pulled up and fired a dart into Mike's neck.  And that's why I was weaving.  And I would look.  I'm still walking around with a tag on my ear and a radio collar on. 
[03:06:00]  That's how they keep tears in me.  But that's why I was drowsy.  You would too if you had a dart full of tranquilizer in your neck.  That's why I was not intoxicated.  I was drugged for a medical experiment.  Experiment.  Oh, no.  F-P-R.  Control, escape, delete.  All right.  Whatever you say.  Sure.  Experiment.  And finally, they're saying you're beginning to train for a fight. 
[03:06:30]  Do you know about this?  No.  I've got to fight again.  You're going to be fighting in March.  Mike don't want to get his ass kicked no more.  I have to train for a fight?  You're training for a fight, yeah.  The training starts early.  First, they paper trained me so I could go into the kitchen on the papers.  And then it starts from there.  And then perhaps soon I could live inside in the house.  And I have to live in the Mike house out back where all my feces litter the yard.  That's, you know, we've got to train early. 
[03:07:00]  You know, it's kind of a, that's the first step in training.  Then I could come inside and maybe they will pet Mike and let him sleep at the foot of the bed.  I am not an animal.  I am Mike Tyson.  Well, Mike, we have some instant feedback coming in here.  And Gravy Eggos from the Pacific Ocean writes.  Gravy Eggos? 
[03:07:30]  Uh-oh.  He's checking in from the Pacific Ocean.  Yes, I wonder what he'd want to talk about.  Yeah, I wonder.  I effing wonder.  Just please make me understand.  I'm going to be that little guy.  He wants to know if Tyson punched Lacey Peterson in the stomach and then wonder where her uterus went.  Now, that would have solved the problem, wouldn't it?  That boy wouldn't have had to go fishing. 
[03:08:00]  If I punched, there would be nothing left.  That's what I used to do to my ex-wife, the one from Head of the Class.  What was that bitch's name?  Robin Givens?  Robin Quivers?  Robin Givens?  I would like to punch her in her big fat fucking face.  Robin Givens?  Givens.  Oh, that's a different one.  Yeah.  I'd like to punch her too.  I was married to her.  And remember, I punched her in the face during the argument.  And in an interview, I said it was the best punch I ever gave. 
[03:08:30]  And she took it.  I miss her.  You miss Robin.  I like a bitch who could take a punch to the uterus.  I miss that.  Yeah, any more details on my rampage?  I'm looking.  I think that's about it.  The guy, he just wants his hood fixed.  He doesn't even really want to press charges.  He just wants his hood fixed that you did when you were jumping up and down on all fours. 
[03:09:00]  I don't have that kind of scratch.  What are you doing, Mike?  Fourteen nine.  What?  What were you just doing?  Oh, I was...  Sometimes I make that noise.  I think I got Tourette's.  Yeah?  Yes, right in the middle of the...  Right in the middle of the... 
[03:09:30]  Sometimes I'm talking.  Sometimes I bust out like that.  And I get on all fours and start pouncing on car hoods.  Oh, look, I'm on the TV.  Yeah, well...  What is that mysterious box with a picture in it?  That's the TV.  Yeah, I shouldn't have said TV first.  I know.  The joke would have...  It would have worked.  Sometimes I don't think so straight.  I got brain damage.  Brain.  Oh?  Well, it's in there. 
[03:10:00]  That's a hard one.  All right, Mike.  Well, thank you.  Well, thank you.  No, thank you.  I'll see you down in the parking garage.  Any blonde woman in this city, on maybe the 60th floor, I could shove my big fish through  the window, grab and climb buildings?  No?  I like that.  They go, ah! 
[03:10:30]  They start screaming.  I climb up the building with them.  I tickle them a little peek under their dress.  They charge me with rape and then the bar plane shoot me.  That's a night out for Mike.  All right, well...  No phone calls coming in.  Anthony, you just missed Mike Tyson.  He was...  Oh, I did.  Giving us an exclusive on his arrest.  Dang it.  Justin, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, you're killing me with that, man.  I just spilled half my coffee on my front windshield.  I'm going to piss myself. 
[03:11:00]  He spilled his coffee.  He spilled his coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Okay.  His coffee, as Steve would say.  He spilled his coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Oh, Steve, see?  Yeah, yeah.  Coffee.  People commenting on the way he says,  Coffee.  Have we played that, by the way, in the free play?  What?  That PSA?  What?  Ooh.  What?  The PSA from...  Well, you try to find it.  Uh-oh.  You know the PSA from Canada?  Wait, I might be able to find it.  I hope so, because I don't think the free play people have heard this. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  And they should.  It's an important issue that's not to be made fun of.  Why don't you explain it?  It's such an important part of this program, because we refer to it every ten minutes.  Well, there was PSAs being made up in Canada about domestic violence.  I know where it is, Ben.  Domestic violence.  Right here.  Track five.  And they got banned.  They were a little too graphic, so they never aired them.  But we have them.  One of them was this guy is sitting in a restaurant with his two children. 
[03:12:00]  The waitress comes over, pours some coffee for him, and, uh, kind of spills the coffee  a little bit.  And he, uh...  Shit.  He should...  Oh!  What?  I jumped the gun!  He shows her who's boss.  Okay.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  Don't bring a little coffee.  How do you like that?  Don't bring a little coffee.  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home. 
[03:12:30]  That's a great gimmick.  You know, they're out in a restaurant.  You wouldn't be able to beat on her there.  See, I took it differently.  I took this as a warning.  Like, you wouldn't be able to spill coffee at home.  Oh, is that what you were thinking?  Don't do it here.  You wouldn't get away with it at...  Oh, see, I see.  You think it's her problem.  Absolutely.  It's about...  It's an anti-clumsiness ad.  Well, there's a gentleman there,  and he's paying for a meal. 
[03:13:00]  Carefully pour that gentleman's coffee.  An anti-clumsy woman PSA.  Absolutely.  Like, if you're clumsy,  watch out, because this could happen.  Here come your just desserts.  And for those that haven't seen it,  there's videos up on foundrymusic.com.  Oh, that's great.  And when she's screaming,  he's pouring the hot coffee on her tits.  Yeah, not only is he punching her about the face,  but he pours the scalding hot coffee all over her chest.  Or as we say,  he's really teaching her what happens to clumsy people. 
[03:13:30]  And like you've said in the past, Jimmy,  I doubt she spills another cup of coffee.  Not another drop.  Probably very attentive.  We interrupt this program to bring you  the ozone midget sighting of the day.  We have a midget sighting?  I think so.  Tom in Ohio, what's up?  Tom.  Tom.  Hold on, Tom.  Let's try that.  Tom in Ohio, what's up?  Not much.  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, get this.  I was just driving past the gas station, 
[03:14:00]  and I saw a little old lady,  a midget,  get out of a two-door Cavalier with crutches  and go attempt to pump gas.  Midget crutches?  Oh, yeah.  Where do you get midget crutches?  What?  Where do you get the midget crutches?  Yeah.  Do you get the regular-sized crutches  and then saw off a couple feet?  That's a custom job.  That could be the case.  I don't know.  They were funny looking.  They probably went up to my kneecap.  I had a little midget with crutches. 
[03:14:30]  Did she get the job done with the gas pumping?  I don't know.  I was just driving past,  but I saw her while hobbling over to the pump.  Must be so frustrating.  I have to hold that gas thing over your head  and put it in the...  I'm pumping the gas.  Those little fingers trying to hold down  the gas pump nozzle handle.  And they've got to reach up.  You know how when you take the nozzle out of the gas pump,  you've got to flip that thing up 
[03:15:00]  that the nozzle's sitting in?  They've got to look up and push above their heads.  Oh, it's got to suck being a midget.  And God forbid some gas spills on them  and they catch on fire  because people won't even know.  They'll go,  look, someone must be burning some ants  with a magnifying glass.  I never thought Steve was so little.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's a cruel world.  Take care, guys.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  Anyway...  Coffee Diva.  Oh, we were talking about Coffee Diva?  I didn't realize he said it like that 
[03:15:30]  until you pointed it out.  Coffee.  Okay.  Coffee.  It says K-A-F-A.  There's an H in there.  Coffee.  Anthony, I'm spelling like Mike Tyson.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  As we go to break,  we're going to play some of the two-bar tape.  Oh, love these.  Old Red.  Old Red.  Old curmudgeon.  I guess it was a barkeep in Jersey.  And these obnoxious kids  would prank call him  over and over and over again.  Yes. 
[03:16:00]  And this is part of the tape  where it just gets really ugly  because Red has just...  He's just had it.  Ran out of patience.  He's just had it with the...  What does he call him?  The yellow belly...  Yeah, yellow belly.  Yeah, why don't you have some moxie  and come down here?  He just wants to fight him now.  Oh, he wants to beat him up.  He just wants to fight him.  Just a little message  from Florentine on my cell phone.  I was not there,  still waiting to find out  if Singer Pat is okay.  Oh.  I know I mentioned that before,  so I figured I would...  Oh, the...  At the shooting.  The damage plant shooting  in Columbus, Ohio. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, someone rogbed him  that he was okay,  that he was there, so...  We lost Dimebag overnight.  Liquid metal is in mourning.  Yes.  Go to Channel 42  for all the details, right?  It's so hard to be named Dimebag  when you get shot on stage  because the news  just cannot take you seriously.  They don't...  You know, it's not like,  and the president was shot.  It's, you know...  The shooting claimed  the life of Dimebag.  They say it in a way  that just...  But Bobzilla's gonna be okay. 
[03:17:00]  Yes, word is Bobzilla is okay.  Never take it seriously.  All right.  Well, here's the two-bar tape.  Mm-hmm.  Hello?  Yeah.  I'm gonna break your fucking face  open for you,  you son of a bitch.  You know what?  You talk to me.  Yeah, your mother sucked my brick  the other day, you know that?  Yeah.  Well...  Now you can come down  and suck mine, too.  Yeah, when I come down,  I'll chop it off of you.  I wish you would come down,  you motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Hello?  Yeah, listen.  Who do you think you are  fighting like that on the phone?  What the hell?  I ask you for a fucking name  and you start screaming and yelling.  Why don't you come over here  and say that to him face-to-face,  you motherfucker.  All I ask you for was a name.  What are you yelling at me for?  Why don't you come over  face-to-face  and I'll tell you right away.  You just tell me  you're the guy that calls.  Why don't you tell me  where you are  and I'll come over to see you.  All I do is call you up.  What are you talking about?  Why don't you tell me  I'll come over to see you  where you are.  Get over there.  I'll stab you,  you motherfucker. 
[03:18:00]  Why don't you tell me  where you are,  I'll come over.  You see,  you ain't got the guts  to fucking fight me.  I ain't got the guts?  To fight me.  Why don't you tell me  where I am  and I'll come right over.  I'll come over to your joint.  I'll come over to your joint.  You fucking bastard.  What the hell are you doing with you?  Why are you a lousy  motherfucker bum?  Why don't you go out  and fuck your motherfucker?  Listen, I fuck your mother.  I fuck your mother.  You can do anything you want,  you yellow red-batches.  You want me to go over  and come over  and I'll meet you  wherever you want me to meet you. 
[03:18:30]  You want me to come over there  because all your friends are there  because that's what you need.  I'll come over to you  without my friends  to your place.  I'll meet you  wherever you want.  You yellow son of a bitch.  And you know something?  I happen to know  who you are.  And wait until I catch up with you.  I'll put the ZZ  on both cheeks of your life.  You'll remember me  for the rest of your life.  That's who you are.  The ZZ.  Your friends told me  who you are  so I know who you are. 
[03:19:00]  I'll get you  you cock sucker  and when I do boy  God bless you.  Tumar.  Yes, hello?  Tumar.  Yeah.  Yeah, can I speak to Mike please?  Mike who?  Unstinks.  Who?  Unstinks.  Mike Unstinks?  Yes.  Anybody's name  Mike Unstinks?  Mike?  Unstinks.  Clint Taurus.  Yeah, Clint Taurus.  Clint Taurus.  Yeah.  October? 
[03:19:30]  Tumar.  Yes, can I speak to Clint please?  Who?  Clint.  Clint?  Yeah.  Anybody's name Clint?  Clint!  Anybody's name Clint?  Clint here!  Nobody better than me.  Alright, last name is Taurus.  T-O-R-I-S.  Taurus?  Yeah, Clint Taurus.  Clint Taurus?  Yeah.  Clint Taurus!  Clint Taurus! 
[03:20:00]  Clint Taurus!  No.  Oh, he's not in yet? Okay, thanks.  Hello?  Yes, is he coming, please?  Who?  Is he coming?  What's his name?  Is he. Is he coming?  Coming. C-U-M-M-I-N-G.  Anybody named is he coming?  Is he coming?  Is he coming?  Is he coming?  No, nobody would ask me. 
[03:20:30]  Uh, not is he. Is he?  Is he coming? I said is he coming.  No, is he I, I-Z-Z-Y.  Is he coming?  Not here.  Not here. Okay, thanks.  Hello?  Hello, it's Willie there.  Hello, he was here, he left.  Willie?  Yeah.  You sure?  Yeah.  He's gotta be there.  He's not here, Al. Otherwise I'd put him on.  What?  Otherwise I'd put him on the telephone. 
[03:21:00]  He was here, he went.  You don't even know what Willie?  How much are you talking?  Oh, Willie.  Who?  My friend Willie. He's supposed to be there.  What's his name?  Willie.  Willie who?  Faggot.  Willie, Willie Franco?  Faggot.  What's the second name? I'll call out the name.  Faggot.  How do you spell that?  F-A-G-G, uh.  Willie Faggot.  Willie Faggot.  Willie Faggot. 
[03:21:30]  Willie Faggot.  Not here.  What?  Not here.  If you say it wrong, it's not coming down for you.  Well, you fucking bum, come on over here and tell her to be in my face.  I'll blind you, you son of a...  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?

They tell you pot smoking makes you unmotivated a lie.  When you're high you can do everything you normally do just as well.  You just realize it's not worth the fucking effort.  Sure, I could get up at dawn, get in traffic, go to a job I hate that does not inspire me creatively whatsoever for the rest of my life. 
[03:24:30]  I could do that. Sure.  Or...  I can sleep till noon.  Get up and learn how to play the sitar.  What is it, one string? How fucking hard is this instrument? 
[03:25:00]  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  It would be a better world.  The world of sitar players calling the fucking aliens in the fifth dimension this morning.  here are some more men who ought to be strapped to a gurney and castrated with fishing knives  white guys who shave their heads completely bald you know 
[03:25:30]  they're so ashamed they lost 11 hairs they're going to try to turn it into some kind of a  masculine statement i say hey you goofy looking baldy-headed fuck looks good on black guys on  you it's ugly repulsive and disgusting you want to be bald do what i did wait a while  meantime there's no excuse for running around looking like a freshly circumcised dick

[03:27:00]  Wow, what happened there? 
[03:27:30]  I don't know.  Oh, Mike is not.  God damn it.  All right.  Are you okay?  I'm all right.  I will come over.  This has been the biggest Cluster F radio show we've done since joining XM Satellite Radio.  I did not sleep last night and I didn't eat breakfast.  The music's playing for us to come back on.  I was waiting for...  Never mind.  How long do you want the bed to play?  Very good, Jimmy. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  It's the all-day virus spreading across America.  Out there in Radioland, they had no idea what was going on.  They were hearing music and they were enjoying it.  They were tapping their feet and waiting for us to come back.  That's all.  I'll rub you back.  Ben starts waving his hands.  Excuse me, guys.  I think you're on the air.  Why?  You could hear that in the headphones?  No, I was looking at you because you were reading.  I was trying to get your attention because the hook had ended.  Honestly, I was trying to think if we should do Bonehead Class of 04, if it was worth doing  on the show or not today.  And Jim just mortified some guy from the neighboring office in the bathroom, according to Steve. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah?  What'd you do?  Nothing.  Now you're staring at the TV?  Yeah.  Stop.  We've got to do a show.  Alex from Boston.  What's up, Alex?  Hey, I got an idea for a t-shirt from before.  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about these outrageous t-shirts, baby t-shirts that some of the parents are buying  and putting on their kids.  Yeah, very offensive.  Yes, go ahead.  It could say, Dad's little chum.  It was for, you know, Connor Peterson.  Chum being the fishing term for throwing meat and blood over the side to attract the fish. 
[03:29:00]  Daddy's little chum.  I just don't understand.  Wow, that is a good one.  I give up on this one.  That is hilarious.  I really don't understand this.  Do you want to do the boneheads of the year?  Oh, we've already come to the end of the year list.  Yeah, they're starting to come out.  And, I don't know, this was in Maxim.  And they list the top, you know, boneheads of the year. 
[03:29:30]  Boneheads of the year, I guess.  People that made fools of themselves, obviously, in the past year.  Weren't we in there for 2002?  Probably.  We made a lot of the year-end lists in 2002 for the same past thing.  We're being really stupid.  Boneheads of 2002.  Idiots of 2002.  Bill from North Carolina.  Says it all today.  Let's say hi to Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, man.  You guys rock.  I love the show.  But, man, there is no virus being spread today.  You guys got a big, fat condom on it, man. 
[03:30:00]  That nobody wants to show today, man.  I hate Rich Voss, man.  I almost want you to bring his ass back.  Because otherwise, I'm going to play.  Oh, no.  I was under the impression we were having a little bit of fun today.  You know, I guess he's just joshing.  We had some fun radio today.  Well, we had some lofts.  I think the Tyson was a nice loft.  The t-shirt thing was a loft.  Nobody cut a gas, so why are you lighting a candle, romantic Ben?  Romantic.  Why are you lighting candles now? 
[03:30:30]  Well, you want to put a ring on someone's finger?  I kind of like the candle.  Yeah, but I think these are automatic sprinklers that will go off if they detect heat and smoke.  We've had Steve in here, and they haven't gone off.  See, no problem.  Light a little candle.  That's nothing.  See, I get the Steve thing.  I just don't get the little Carl Peterson thing.  Boneheads of the Year, Anthony.  In 12th place, it's Brock Lesnar, the WWE superstar. 
[03:31:00]  I'm so out of the loop.  You know Brock Lesnar?  I know him, but I'm out of the loop.  He's that monster.  He turned down a $45 million contract to continue with the WWE because he wanted to play in the NFL.  Oh, boy.  And he was going to make $230,000 as a rookie.  He was training really hard.  And what happened, it says after the laughter, what happened, Lesnar was injured in a motorcycle crash right before training camp.  Yee.  So he blew off the $45 million contract to play football, and just before training camp started, he's in a motorcycle accident. 
[03:31:30]  Yes.  I just made an exasperated noise.  Why?  Oh, that's almost as bad as having a successful radio show and having people have sex in a church, getting thrown off the air,  and then, you know, watching people sign half-billion-dollar deals and watching someone today sign $25 million deals.  Yeah.  $25 million?  Yeah, Sean Hannity signed for like $25 million today.  Yeah. 
[03:32:00]  For five years.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  I wish him the best.  Steve in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I got another T-shirt slogan for you guys.  Oh, good.  We like the T-shirt slogans, you know?  Uh-huh.  These outrageous.  I hope you like this one.  All right, let's hear it.  My daddy killed me and my mommy, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.  Silence.  I think.  That's all right.  Yeah.  That's awful.  Okay.  This bigger laugh's coming out of that empty crib. 
[03:32:30]  Man.  Okay.  In 11th place, Anthony, Boneheads of the Year.  Yes.  Good old Howard Dean.  We all know what happened to Howard Dean, the candidate for president.  Yeah!  Yeah, they spell it in this.  He was doing fine until he cried, Y-E-A-G-H.  Yeah!  And that killed his $50 million campaign.  He was the fun runner.  We're going to go on to Ohio. 
[03:33:00]  We're going to go on to Florida.  We're going to...  Yeah!  I disagree that it killed his campaign, though.  He was already getting his ass kicked.  I think Sharpton embarrassing him is what started his downfall.  Sharpton's like, how come you don't have any black people in your cabinet?  Yeah, there's four black people in Vermont.  In Vermont, yeah.  Dressing it honestly, groveling, groveling Howard Dean.  And then people realized that Sharpton made an ass out of him.  And if that happens, you're not qualified to run the country.  That was the beginning of his downfall, I believe.  All right.  Tenth place. 
[03:33:30]  You could play along at home.  Does anyone know why Michael Silvestri...  Silvestri?  Silvestri.  Oh, you know him, right?  No, I'm just guessing because of the awful pronunciation you gave it.  Well, I do this every morning, so...  Oh, pie.  Do you know why he's a bonehead?  No.  In 2004.  Yes, but I don't want to spoil it.  You really do?  No, he doesn't.  He's such a liar.  He was the firefighter that caved in the face of his fellow firefighter.  Oh, they were arguing about Elvis' birthday. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Here in New York City.  Got in a little fight.  Everyone knows the firemen love to drink.  Well, it was...  Just the way it is.  It was on New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  So they were all tanked up.  Tanked up and he pretty much crushed in the skull of a fellow firefighter.  With a chair.  And now he's claiming 9-11 post-traumatic stress.  Why not?  Whatever.  Get you off the hook.  All right.  Those firemen love to drink, and Bloomberg is really up in arms.  He's going to try to get all the booze out of the firehouses and stuff.  It's been the way of life for them, guys, for years. 
[03:34:30]  They have bars in the firehouses.  They have bars.  How about that chick that banged like four of the firefighters in the one firehouse?  It's another one.  Firefighters are known to be partying guys.  It's a high-stress job.  You don't know if you're going to live or die.  You're on work a few days nonstop, and then you're off for a few days,  so the lifestyle is really crazy.  You've got to allow them certain liberties, you know?  Absolutely.  If some broads want to come in and bang some New York City firefighters, let them.  And no one's looking? 
[03:35:00]  Why not?  That's it.  If they want to have a drink or something, it's not interfering with their work.  When they go to put out these fires, you know, they're doing a great job.  Let them have some drinks.  Who cares?  You're talking about firefighters and not the staff of the Opie and Anthony program, right?  No, actually.  There were some descriptions in there that I was getting a little confused.  Want a drink?  Bang broads?  Because we're putting out fires every day.  Well, do you think that people are relieving stress in other areas of the facility at times?  Kind of right.  You think the rookie would bang the chick while she tried to charge one of the Chiefs $500? 
[03:35:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Still bitter about that, huh?  Good.  Bloomberg's a typical...  He's not a bad man.  He's not awful.  But just what a typical, simpy businessman.  You know, the guys, blue-collar guys, they're running into burning buildings,  and this asshole wants to yank alcohol out.  Do you think that rookie that was with the woman,  do you think she would have to worry that maybe the Chiefs hose has hepatitis coming out of it?  Maybe that's why. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, that is true.  We all thought the rookie liked the other rookies, but apparently not.  In ninth place, Boneheads of the Year, Anthony.  Does anyone know who Jason Stosselmeyer is?  Yes.  No, you don't.  I do so.  I'm not even going to look at you.  Okay.  Jason Stosselmeyer?  Stosselmeyer.  It's S-T-O-L-L-S-T-E-I-N.  Stosselmeyer?  Yes.  Like I said it.  I think I got that one right.  You did.  Do you really know? 
[03:36:30]  Ben should know this one, no?  Stop you wanting Ben.  We know he sucked today, but that's not helping the situation.  Someone from Boston?  It's the Von Bondi's lead singer.  Yes.  Got smacked down by white-striped Jack White, his former mentor.  That's right.  And it says, it sucks when a fan of yours kicks your ass.  Wow.  He really roughed him up, too.  I remember seeing the pictures of that.  Beat the crap out of him.  It was a bowling alley in Detroit.  The guy from the White Stripes beat him up?  Jack Black beat the...  I mean, Jack White beat the crap out of him.  Jack White's a little wimpy guy.  Beat the crap out of him, and the photos were unbelievable. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  That is bad.  Dude, eighth place, bonehead of the year, Anthony.  Billy Joel?  Ah, yes, of course.  We know he...  His third accident in two years?  This one, hitting a house.  Hit a house.  You can't even blame it on what you hit.  Yeah.  You know, if you hit a tree or a house, you're an idiot.  It's not like another car.  Oh, it kind of swerved in my way.  I had a jam on the brakes, something.  It's a house. 
[03:37:30]  A house.  That puts him in eighth place.  Seventh place, Rick Salomon.  Got it, Benny Paris, right?  The poor man's Tommy Lee, uh...  The poor man's Tommy Lee.  What's a bonehead move about that?  The poor man's Tommy Lee videotaped himself drilling Paris Hilton, then sued the Hiltons  for claiming he took advantage of her.  He pulled out his bone and got head.  Maybe that's where they confused the bonehead part of the...  I disagree.  That's not a bonehead move at all.  That's a great move. 
[03:38:00]  That is a great move.  After the laughter.  Fuck the daughter, then sue the parents.  Good boy, Rick.  Yeah, that is a good one.  The gall.  Let's stay at the Sheraton.  Salomon sold the video rights to one night in Paris, achieving his goal to, quote, make  a ton of money and go surfing.  Yeah, then we're going to wing on over to London and jam with the stones.  Yeah, that isn't really a bonehead move.  That's kind of...  A brilliant move.  Sixth place is name I can't pronounce from The Apprentice.  The black chick.  The bitchiest former apprentice. 
[03:38:30]  She accused a competitor of racism.  Omarosa, yeah.  Omarosa.  Yeah, well, all right.  Well, say the last name.  It's Omarosa M. Stallworth.  Yeah.  Not M.  There's a name there.  Omarosa M. Stallworth.  Stallworth, yes.  Her middle initial is M.  Her father played for the Steelers.  No, read this M.  Oh.  Mung.  I was reading by the picture. 
[03:39:00]  Manigault?  Omarosa Manigault Stallworth?  Is that her name?  Uh, let's go to Manigault.  Manigault.  12 pieces of Manigault.  Manigault.  Yeah, that was kind of funny.  Three Godfathers.  All tree Godfathers.  Oh, shut up.  I'm feeling better about the show, because that was a funny little segment, too.  It was.  Oh, it was hilarious.  But what's 12?  I won't sleep.  Mike in Philly.  Yeah, I got a t-shirt idea.  Oh, great.  We love these t-shirts, these offensive t-shirts that the babies are wearing because the parents  are buying them.  Okay, go ahead. 
[03:39:30]  All right, I got one.  It's for the wife, though.  It's, um...  My husband took me fishing, and all I got was this dead, bloated baby.  All right, listen.  All right.  Now you've gone too, too far.  All right, so, uh, yeah, this black chick from The Apprentice, she accused the competitor  of racism.  We all remember that.  After her firing.  And then she ended up launching a 900 number where you could hear her talk about herself 
[03:40:00]  for $3.95 a minute.  Yes.  There was a...  Are you raising your hand?  No.  No, there's...  You're just herkying and jerking?  Yeah.  God, that is so confusing sometimes.  He must get called on in school all the time, but he didn't mean anything.  Who knows the answer?  What?  No, I don't...  Lil' Benny Sparks?  Yeah, Ben's off to my left, and I see movement, so I'm thinking he's got something, so I'm  turning, but he's just herkying and jerking.  He's herkying.  I'm not even making a gag.  Did you see a herky or a jerky out of your eye?  That was more of a herky.  Was it a herky part of it?  Yeah, because the herky is the up and down motion, and the jerky is the side and side. 
[03:40:30]  The jerky is the return in, yeah.  Herky and jerky.  The herkying and jerking.  There was, by the way, another t-shirt, but I don't want to say, because it's got nothing  to do with the Peterson case.  Nothing to do with it.  All right.  Thank God.  No.  What was it?  It was from Texas, and it was Rub-A-Dub-Dub.  He shut his mic off.  Why, Opie?  All right.  I'm sorry, Jim.  Go ahead.  Rub-A-Dub-Dub. 
[03:41:00]  Grandparents, tears in a tub.  All right.  Boneheads of the year, Anthony.  Anyone remember Jessica Cutler?  Yes.  What she did this year?  You do not.  I do so.  All right.  What'd she do?  Jessica Cutler.  Jessica Cutler.  Is there a Jessica Cutler here?  It's cut.  Oh.  You ass. 
[03:41:30]  That's different.  Well, she was the Senate mail clerk that had an ongoing sexual relationship with six  men.  Nice.  One, a married Bush official, and then she was stupid enough to document all-  He's a Bush official.  Wow.  What?  Nothing.  A guy knows a lot about the women's private area.  No.  No, he worked for-  Oh, I thought he had been educated in everything Bush.  And then she documented it in a blog that went public.  She was fired, of course, and bounced back by posing nude and got a six-figure book deal. 
[03:42:00]  Was there a blog called I Stink?  That's a good blog.  Is that Jimmy Norton's little blog?  Sure is a little blog.  Where he spills out everything that really should not be spilled out sometimes.  If I wonder why I'm not meeting women.  Oh, yeah.  Blog spot.  Yuck.  Larry from New Orleans.  Larry!  Hi, Larry.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  What's up, Larry?  I got an idea for a T-shirt.  Okay.  I'm glad my daddy didn't take me fishing. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  All right.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I just want to understand this whole obsession with this case.  That's all.  That's all I'm asking for.  Brian, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I have an idea for a-  It's actually a T-shirt.  But that inspired me, but it's actually an invention for a company.  It's the Connor and Lacey Peterson disposable anchors.  And you can knock her up if you want, just for added weight, depending on the size of your boat. 
[03:43:00]  And you know, cut the fucking line, Luke.  You tell her what.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You should have edited that a little bit, Spielberg.  Jesus was that long.  Why do I have to explain why I think it should be edited by saying, Jesus was that long?  It's good.  Yeah.  A little tag on.  A fool.  Didn't feel confident in it, so you got to tag it.  I'm just nervous because Straley's out there.  Well, that was a friendly hello.  Oh, you didn't get a-  No, not at all.  Hi.  Hi, Jim.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Very-  I wonder why.  Tense. 
[03:43:30]  Hey, guy that ruins our meetings, Norton.  I'm nervous, you're asking questions.  Okay, in fourth place, Bonehead, class of 04, Anthony.  Yeah.  Charles Kushner.  Anyone know who Charles Kushner is?  Oh, I know the name.  Charles Kushner.  K-U-S-H-N-E-R?  K-U-S-H-N-E-R.  Yes.  No.  Wait.  I want to think.  Norton will just sit there and not say anything.  I do know who he was.  He was the guy in charge of putting foam on the Endeavor. 
[03:44:00]  No, this James McGreevy supporter hired a prostitute to seduce his own brother-in-law  and sent the tapes to his sis to punish them for giving evidence against him.  Shit dick!  How about Patrick Graeber?  Bonehead, class of 04, in third place.  Pat Graeber?  Patrick Graeber.  Patrick Gaber! 
[03:44:30]  No.  Patrick Gaber!  No?  Graeber.  Graeber.  Yes.  Or Grabber.  Grabber, pussy!  No, it's not.  Grabber, pussy!  No, not here.  Why you?  Yellow belly.  You yellow belly sapsucker.  I'll put Z's on your cheeks.  You'll remember me for the rest of your life.  I'm not going to squealer.  This Swiss national nearly brought the Kobe Bryant case to an early close 
[03:45:00]  when he allegedly offered to murder the accuser for $3 million.  Oh, I didn't even know that was part of the case.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  How about Roy Moore?  Roy Moore?  Mm-hmm.  He inadvertently announced the winner of the third season of Last Comic Standing  and is being sued.  Craven Moorhead!  No, it's...  Craven Moorhead!  It's Roy.  Roy Moore?  Roy Moore, yes.  Oh.  No.  Nothing?  I have no idea who that is. 
[03:45:30]  All right.  He's Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice.  Who wouldn't want those things taken out of us.  Lost his job over a 5,000-pound Ten Commandments monument he displayed in the judicial building.  Yes.  He lost his job for that?  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  And he has emerged as a hero to the extreme right.  Of course he is.  And he's going to likely run for governor in 2006.  That's good.  Lucky you, Alabama.  Sweet home, Alabama.  And the governor's true, by the way.  Commandment number 11.  Thou shalt not push it that far, stupid.  Make your point and then take down the dumb tampon. 
[03:46:00]  The dumb tampon.  Ah!  The dumb tampon?  What the hell are you saying?  I was going to say tablets of commandments and put it into dumb tampon.  Oh, tab-man-mans.  Yeah, I turned into an Asian name, dumb tampon.  Good one.  Let's say hi to Charles in Tampa.  Hey, I love you guys.  I have a shirt for you.  All right.  You know those I'm with stupid shirts?  Yeah.  This one is I'm with my mother's dead, rotting corpse.  All right, listen.  Sorry.  You have to be a little more clever than that.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  It's not funny really ever.  Yeah.  But it's really not funny if it's put in a, put like that.  Hmm.  All right.  Time for the number one bonehead of the year.  Ooh!  Do we have a drum roll?  I'm all excited like a little midget that just got proposed to.  Little hands.  Ooh!  Don't make any Peterson jokes.  Bob Kelly might start crying. 
[03:47:00]  Fucking sissy.  Dude, this doesn't move you?  No!  Anthony?  Moves me to rage.  Drum roll, please!  The number one bonehead.  Ooh, a drum roll.  Of the year 04 is...  Yes.  Who cares?  You're right.  I don't care.  Me neither.  Who gives a shit?  All right.  Ben, fish that out of the garbage for the rest of the show.  Because you're going to think about it all day?  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  All right.

Do you realize who you hired?  Opie.  He's a disruptive influence.  Anthony.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What a horrible table.  Our new bosses said, uh, you guys can get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity. 
[03:51:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  It's psychotic.  So, are you breathing?  So, we've made it to the end of another Opie and Anthony program.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Time to play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today, I didn't learn what the 12th day was.  No.  I don't even know what the 12th day was.  Mike from Blackjack Table.  From the Blackjack Table.  I learned today that someone in the office is suntanning after hours in the studio. 
[03:52:00]  Al Mack again.  I learned Tupac isn't dead.  He's just waiting.  Detective Dave from Jersey.  I learned a new way to say the word coffee.  What's wrong?  Coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Let's see.  Let's go to the phones.  Why is he taking cell calls during the show there?  Steve from whackbag.com.  What's up, Steve?  I learned today that the moderators at Danza Board are working overtime tonight.  Mmm.  Very good.  Yeah, you guys did a great job with that. 
[03:52:30]  You guys and the gang at opanthony.net shutting down the Tony Danza message board.  Let's go to No Random Show.  What's up, No Random Show?  No Random Show reference, but that's not all that important.  Okay.  I learned today that M. Night Shyamalan's next blockbuster stars Mike Tyson.  Wow, I killed with that one.  What did he say?  I think we all were off today, including the listeners.  The listeners were a little off as well today. 
[03:53:00]  Let's go to Justin on Long Island.  Hey, Justin.  What's up, shit dicks?  Easy with that.  I learned on the first day of Christmas, Vosk gives rides in a Z100.  A Z100?  I don't get it.  It's an IROC Z.  You don't remember that callback from when he was telling a story about the crack?  Okay, all right.  You know something?  He defended his joke.  He is absolutely right.  Vosk called it a Z100.  Listen, guys, I'll come in tomorrow for you.  You guys take a day off.  All right, thank you.  We really are dumb today. 
[03:53:30]  Wow.  How did you know something?  He said it, and it sounded like he was making the mistake.  Very good.  Hey, Paul, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that the SDS on sunscreen stands for Steve Protection Factor.  Very, very good.  I like that.  A little humor, a little show reference, delivered nicely.  It was perfect.  Mike from Philly, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, boss doesn't like people who type with their bottom lip, and his new CD is going  to be released on Panzerfaust Records. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, hey, that's not bad either.  Very good.  Not bad.  Cannon, Jersey.  Hey, I learned that Shambles is in Arizona.  Shambles is in Arizona, according to Mike Tyson.  Nice.  Thank you.  From Will O'Connor.  And then he slips it in.  There you go.  Good boy.  Tomorrow on the program, Brian Regan, one of our favorite comedians.  Right.  Unbelievable.  Real funny and real clean.  You've got to respect that.  Yes?  I love that scene in the Terminator where Arnold just knocks on the door and he goes,  Are you little Connor? 
[03:54:30]  That's my all-depression.  That was very good.  You know what?  I think we're going to go play a song and get out of here.  We are.  Throw a bit.  No, no, no, no.  I'm going to go see Brian tomorrow.  Keith from Cincinnati.  Yeah, I think we're all going there tomorrow.  I can't.  Keith?  How are you doing today?  I learned you are.  Snort a dime bag, not shoot it.  Snort a dime bag, not shoot it.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Is that the joke?  Yes.  Too soon? 
[03:55:00]  Is it too soon?  Way too soon.  A lot of people bummed at that.  Yeah.  Is Liquid Metal doing a special?  Probably.  Anthony, we were talking about this song earlier.  Let's just get the hell out of here and regroup.  Our song tomorrow will be more gooder.  It's Cartman singing, Come Sail Away.  I'm sailing away. 
[03:55:30]  Set an open course for the emergency.  Free to face the life that's ahead of me.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care. 
[03:56:00]  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  Take care.  I look to the sea 
[03:56:30]  Reflections in the waves  Sparked my memory  Some vibration says  I think of childhood friends  And the dreams we had 
[03:57:00]  We lived happily forever  Tell the story good  But somehow we missed out  On the part of good  And we tried  Best that we can  To carry on  I gave the ring of angels 
[03:57:30]  Appears with my hands  Sing to me the song of hope  And this is what they did  Come stay away  Come stay away  Come stay away  Come stay away with me  Yes  Come stay away  Come stay away  Come stay away  Come stay away with me 
[03:58:00]  Come stay away  Come stay away  Come stay away  Come stay away with me  Yeah, come stay away, come stay away, come stay away with me. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought that they were angels, but you made us a play.  They claimed to force their starship and headed for the starship.  Come stay away, come stay away, come stay away with me. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, come stay away, come stay away, come stay away with me.  Yes, I thought that, come stay away, come stay away, come stay away with me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come stay away, come stay away, come stay away with me.  Make it fucking hell.  Ay!  Screwin' at myself!  Ay!

Void where prohibited.  You know, honey, I knew it was hot and sunny before I even got out of bed today.  Ask me, Ma.  Say it.  Say why.  Repeat after me.  Why?  Because my balls were hanging low.  Let's say that real tight.  We're talking rainstorm. 
[04:02:00]  Half mass, cloudy with a chance of showers.  That's right, honey.  The penis sinks for itself.  It's got its own brain.  Why do you think the head's bigger than the rest?  I could prove it's got a mind of its own.  You ever get up in the morning and he's already awake?  He's dressed.  He's ready to go, right?  He's in the kitchen making fucking flapjacks.  You're in bed going, come on, Joey.  Five more minutes.  Your penis is going, take me shopping. 
[04:02:30]  I need a new hat.  But you remember when they first came out with the hard-on, huh?  Third, fourth grade, you're leaning over like the hunchback of Notre Dame.  Teacher calls you up to the board and you're like,  I don't think so, honey.  You're the teacher, you figure it out, all right?  I got some kind of ligament over here.  I don't know what's going on.  This thing is like alien.  It's drilling into the desk next to me.  Call a cop.  Maybe he'll throw a donut around. 
[04:03:00]  But you grow up, you learn to accept the hard-on, to deal with it.  Except the pee hard-on, you know?  That's God's joke.  You get up, you're late for work, you gotta take a squirt,  and Joey's admiring the chandelier.  You gotta stand there like a moron and talk him down.  Come on, Joey, I dig you.  We'll dot I's and cross T's later.  Work with me!  Yeah, the morning hard-on.  I'll put that up against that Ginsu knife any day. 
[04:03:30]  It'll slice, it'll dice, it'll pump your car up if you got a flat tire.  See what I'm saying, Cal?  I can't count.  Ugh.  Heather.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony show.

[04:05:00]  Thank you. 
[04:05:30]  Thank you. </pre>
