<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in their usual raunchy banter. A caller describes her dog biting her vagina.  The conversation pivots to a heated debate about an anti-American art exhibit near Ground Zero, with Norton offering a serious counterpoint to the hosts' comedic approach.  A Canadian caller criticizes Norton's seriousness, sparking a heated exchange.  Several callers offer their opinions on the art exhibit, with a Portuguese-American caller strongly supporting Norton. The discussion then briefly shifts to the Detroit Pistons' NBA loss, followed by a call from a Scottish listener participating in a dare, showcasing a thick Scottish accent.

Next, a mother-daughter team from MySexyStore.com arrives, delivering a box of sex toys and engaging in a lengthy, graphically explicit discussion about their sex lives, sexual preferences, body modifications (tattoos), and the sex toys themselves.  The segment includes detailed descriptions of sexual acts and body parts.

The show continues with a discussion on the differences between men and women's shaving experiences, particularly concerning pubic hair.  This transitions into further commentary on the mother-daughter team, focusing on their attractiveness. The hosts then recount their experiences negotiating with adult film companies, particularly Steve's unconventional and explicit negotiation tactics involving the insertion of various objects into performers' bodies. They contrast the willingness of strippers and adult film performers to engage in specific acts.  The show then delves into instances of radio bit plagiarism, focusing on a "100-grand" bit and playing a clip of their own version.  They discuss the "Spidey Rapist" and a purported incident where Oprah Winfrey was allegedly denied entry to a Parisian store due to her race.  Opie discusses his own security measures (window bars) and gun ownership in New York versus Texas.  The Oprah story sparks humorous hypotheticals about her potential revenge, and a caller shares an anecdote about a negative experience with Oprah on a flight.

The next segment opens with a discussion about Opie's Polish maid's request for rock and roll music while cleaning.  A caller from South Carolina claims French racism due to perceived preferential treatment of white people in restaurants post-EU.  Another caller shares the Oprah jewelry store story again. Opie gives a birthday message to Paul Field, calling him various offensive names. The show discusses tribute bands, specifically an Easy Star All-Stars reggae version of Pink Floyd's *Dark Side of the Moon*.  A Texas caller defends France, leading to uncomfortable questions about his sexuality. Another caller recounts attracting women with a "Wow" sticker on his truck.  Lisa from New York describes experiencing racism in a French classroom.  Wendy from Washington discusses a radio show, "The Breakfast Boys," which she claims is a rip-off of Opie and Anthony.

Friday from danni.com then arrives and engages in explicit sexual acts with Jim Norton on air, including spitting in his mouth and allowing him to touch her breasts.  Mackenzie Mack is also present.  Friday promotes her perfume, "Scent of a Whore."

A later segment features a prolonged and explicit bit involving a woman named Patty and a vibrator.  The hosts, along with Friday and Ann, engage in suggestive and provocative actions with Patty, who appears uncomfortable and afraid.  Keith the Copp then appears, announcing a motorcycle ride to a Philadelphia strip club.  Patty is invited.  Mackenzie Mack and Friday engage in further explicit sexual acts using various sex toys and the "Liberator," a piece of furniture in the studio.  The segment is filled with crude humor and explicit descriptions of sexual acts.

The final segment features Mackenzie and Friday engaging in various explicit sexual acts on-air with the hosts, including spanking, use of vibrators, whipped cream, and other sensual creams.  Listeners call in to describe their own sexual experiences.  The physical attributes of the guests are frequently discussed, alongside the use and breakage of sex toys.  The segment includes advertisements and culminates in a detailed description of the use of a dildo and lube.  The show ends with plugs for the guests' websites and further sexually explicit remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  We're a bunch of scumbags. 
[00:03:30]  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perfect and for proper.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  We will be in the end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  For many days I didn't bring him here because I suffer when he bites me. 
[00:04:30]  He bite me in my vagina.  When I'm walking and he sees other dog, he's lying away.  He jumps on my vagina because he gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am.  He forgets everything.  He bites the labrador and his penis.  I don't want him to bite my labrador and his penis.  My labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Lucas, my vagina, two times he bites me.  But his penis are very small and they don't damage very much. 
[00:05:00]  They just, they pinch.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  Yeah.  Why?  Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.  Arrgh.  Torture.  It's torture. 
[00:05:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're a wrecked kid, Torture.  Well.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, I can't help.  What?  What?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Come on, everybody.  Wake up. 
[00:06:30]  Rise and shine.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program,  the O.N.A. virus spreading across America,  thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning.  Good morning, old Jimmy Norton.  Oh, I hate artists.  There he goes.  I knew that article was going to get him.  I know, that was pissing me off, too.  That's on the front page of one of the papers today, right?  Yeah.  Draw the line now.  9-11 outrage. 
[00:07:00]  Governor Pataki is allowing a museum  that exhibits anti-American art  to display its works at Ground Zero.  This is a disgrace,  and the news demands action.  What's with Pataki these days?  He really is a boob.  Why is it?  It's anti-American art at Ground Zero?  Just there's an art museum opening  with the Freedom Tower or something.  Something like this,  and they're just showing a couple of things  that have the Abu Ghraib scandal.  And it's like,  look, artists have the right to paint what you want.  It's just,  they're just,  do you have to? 
[00:07:30]  At Ground Zero?  Does it have to invade,  yeah,  that area?  Of all places.  Why don't you try something  in the Holocaust Museum,  some caricature of a Jewish banker  or something really offensive like that,  people would spit on you for it.  It's the same thing.  Show some Nazi propaganda.  Yeah.  Yeah, put that in the Holocaust Museum.  The Jews are greedy,  so the Nazis are just reacting to their greed.  I mean, you know,  it's piggish.  You can do it,  but do you have to do it there?  Someone brought up a pretty good point  in one of the letters sections  of one of the newspapers. 
[00:08:00]  And it was,  when you go to the Hiroshima Memorial,  you don't see a memorial there  or artwork there  about Pearl Harbor  or the Bataan Death March.  It's about Hiroshima.  Of course.  That's it.  Of course,  they did bad things,  and, you know,  that's taken care of elsewhere.  But you don't put that kind of stuff  at the Trade Center site.  You don't.  You just don't.  It's degrading. 
[00:08:30]  It's gross.  It undermines what happened there,  and these people ought to be smacked in the head.  It's like this spoiled child mentality,  this I'm going to do something to upset everyone,  and it's just like a purposeful pseudo-rebellion.  It's not even real rebellion.  It's just being a little brat.  Look where I'm going to put my art.  Yeah.  And I don't even know  if it's the artist or the museum itself.  I don't know if the artist drew it  specifically to be put there.  It might just be there.  I don't know.  And what is Governor Pataki's reasoning for this? 
[00:09:00]  Honestly, I don't know.  I read part of the article.  Brain tumor?  Maybe?  Got to be something.  And again,  I don't want anybody calling.  Yeah, artists have the right to paint anything.  I'm not saying they should be censored,  but there's just an arrogance with the arts.  It's a one-sided arrogance.  And, you know, the NEA,  I'm glad you're not getting funding anymore.  Good.  Stink.  Do it.  Do it.  But do it in your own money.  Why should I pay for it?  Yeah, they have pictures of,  it's called Homeland Security, 
[00:09:30]  and it's got an image of an aircraft,  a jet plane,  nose-diving in  to a woman that's on her back,  naked,  with her legs spread.  Right.  The fuck does that mean?  I'll bet,  wait a minute, man,  I bet that represents America or something.  Right, man.  Or security.  She's security.  Yeah, man.  And they want to put that at the site.  Yeah, that's one of the wonderful pieces of art  that are going to be there.  Well, you know,  when you're that brilliant and creative, man, 
[00:10:00]  you know,  people just don't get it.  You're just flowing on a different level  than everyone else.  Of course.  You know,  we just don't get them.  No.  You just don't get it, man.  You're not cool enough.  Stop it.  Yeah, we're black.  Can we just,  why not,  the majority of the people out there,  the majority,  the people,  want to put two towers back  that look like the old ones,  and have some kind of memorial  to the people that died there.  Nothing more.  Doesn't have to be  an all-encompassing memorial 
[00:10:30]  to everyone that suffered  on the face of the globe,  and who caused them suffering.  Put some towers there.  Put a memorial to the people that died.  We're not looking for a fancy name.  Thank you.  Good night.  We're not looking for a fancy name.  The Freedom Tower.  Freedom Tower.  Stop with freedom.  Because we're free.  World Trade Center.  There you go.  Put it back.  That's all we need.  And if you take a vote,  you'll see that the majority of Americans  would like that to happen.  That's it.  Who volleys this stuff back and forth 
[00:11:00]  and comes up with these lame ideas  for memorials, museums,  buildings that are ridiculous?  Well, just the people.  Let the people speak.  That's what we want.  But no.  We'll get it.  We'll get a friggin' 50-story building  with another 50-story ladder on the roof  and a memorial to everybody  and everything that's ever happened  ever, ever, ever. 
[00:11:30]  We're guilt-ridden idiots as a nation.  There you go.  We're guilt-ridden idiots  and we can't even allow ourselves  to grieve for something  that happened to us as a nation.  We're such dummies.  We have to throw in our guilty bad behavior.  Because we're so guilty  that someone that suffered  is going to be left out.  Yeah, it's just revolving.  That we're going to step on someone else's toes.  And how about this?  How about, you said put the towers back.  Now, the argument against that  is people go, well,  you'd never be able to rent this space  to corporations.  That might be a valid argument.  I mean, it took, I think,  30 years to rent the towers. 
[00:12:00]  It'd be very hard to get a company  to put their whole workforce.  How about this?  If people don't want to do that,  I don't blame companies.  It's scary.  Leave the top empty.  We can afford it.  We waste enough money  in this stupid country  doing nothing.  Build them,  and if people don't want to rent it,  then fuck it.  We take the hit financially.  It beats one big thing,  like you said,  with a ladder on the top of it.  Yeah.  We can afford it.  I'm not saying  companies want to rent it.  Leave it empty.  As long as it looks the same  from the outside.  It's a skyline.  It's a part of what New York is.  Someone will rent it.  Eventually, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  But even if they don't,  it's fucking real estate space.  We can afford it.  We waste enough money  on dog shit  and forgiving debts  in the Middle East.  How about from the 50th floor  to the 100th floor,  we only rent to Arabs?  How about that?  Lovely.  At a discounted price.  There's something  that they haven't discussed  in the news.  There you go.  I like the idea.  Rent it to Arabs.  Wow.  Bittersweet for the next people  that want to blow it up.  Yeah.  How about you?  For the Saudi Arabian embassy,  there's floors 51 through 102. 
[00:13:00]  There you go.  And make sure you put  Islamic extremists  in the memorial.  They were murdered  by Islamic extremists.  Stop it.  You won't see that.  I don't know.  They might do that.  They were fighting for that.  Of course,  they had to fight for it  because God forbid  anybody on a certain side  would allow that.  Why does their religion  have to be brought into it,  Jimmy?  That's what they'll say.  That's what'll keep it  from ever,  ever being on a memorial.  It will never,  ever be written  on a memorial that way.  And the response  to that dumb question 
[00:13:30]  which they will ask  is because  they mentioned the religion.  The hijackers did it  for the religion  and bin Laden links himself  to the religion.  That's why it's your responsibility  to pull yourselves away  from it and go,  this is not all of Islam  because he's linking it.  He's the one saying,  this is for Islam.  This is jihad.  We're not saying it.  He is saying it.  So, you know what?  Yeah.  When people are murdering  abortion people,  abortion doctors  in the name of the Catholic Church,  the Church speaks out about it.  They have to.  They say this is not a part  of what we are.  We distance ourselves from this.  They don't subtly agree  or subtly agree  with at least the motives 
[00:14:00]  if not the actions  by saying nothing.  Where's all the protest  for Al-Zarqawi  killing people?  Where?  You rip up a Koran  and they're fucking  running through the streets  of Pakistan?  Yeah.  It's revolting.  This guy doesn't like Jimmy.  Who cares?  And you're not even  saying anything outrageous  today.  Oh, by the way,  he's Canadian.  Yeah, Norman Canada.  Why?  Jimmy, shut up.  About what, Norm?  Be funny.  Be funny.  Oh, okay.  We're not getting the joke.  Sorry, Canadian.  You weren't attacked.  Sorry, fuck.  I'm sick of listening 
[00:14:30]  to you try  and be goddamn serious.  I'm giving my opinion.  That's what we do  on this show.  We give opinions.  You dumb fuck.  How about this?  You don't agree  with my opinion.  Why don't you just admit that?  I don't agree  with the way  you always try  and analyze everything.  Goddamn it.  Be funny.  So we should  just open this...  I'm so goddamn serious.  Hold on a second.  Wait a minute, Norm.  Front page  of the New York paper  is about a 9-11 outrage,  so we're supposed  to not address it?  No.  Be funny. 
[00:15:00]  So I should address it  like in a silly fashion?  Is that what you're saying?  No, don't even address it,  you dumb fuck.  You try and analyze  everything like you're serious.  I forget what you went  on a rant on the other day.  Jesus Christ,  you throw me nuts.  Who cares?  Norm.  Who cares, Norm?  It still amazes me  that people don't really  get what this show's all about.  Holy shit.  No, they don't.  It's not just a comedy show.  It's not just a shocking show  because we're shock, shock, shock.  You know,  we also try to be  a little bit thought-provoking  and discuss some of these  serious news topics for you. 
[00:15:30]  Norm, I do give my opinions.  That's what I do.  Are they always right?  No.  And then sometimes  they're emotional reactions.  Yeah.  But you know what?  That's what I do.  Yeah, we do acknowledge that, Norm.  You know, this is our beliefs,  our opinions.  You don't have to believe it.  We're not trying to convince you  to think our way.  Ugh.  Norm.  Shut up.  Go watch Second City,  you fucking Canuck.  Who cares?  Run a Michael J. Fox video  or fucking listen to Brian Adams.  No one cares if you laugh.  Is there an N-word for Canadians?  I want to use it. 
[00:16:00]  You're a newfie.  Your mother's a newfie.  Your mother fucks newfies.  How's that?  Canadian.  Tony, you're on with Sam.  Yes.  Morning, guys.  I'm Portuguese.  I'm in this country since 1987.  I was a volunteer firefighter.  I was in the World Trade Center.  And tell that motherfucker Canadian  to shut the fuck up.  They should appear the bigger and better.  I agree with Jim.  Jamie, tell him what it is, Jamie.  Thanks, man. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it's only an opinion.  Again, if you don't agree,  they can write to disagree with it.  But just...  Shut the fuck up.  I agree.  He should.  All right.  I mean, I don't think we're a Canadian.  To Canada.  Fuck him.  Wow, I like this guy's accent.  Yeah, I do too.  It's almost like Frenchie.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rick in Detroit.  Rick.  Yeah, I think Jim is right, man.  You know?  I mean, they're the ones who brought  the religion of Thatcher and the situation.  And it should be on the memorials.  I mean, we shouldn't forget.  We should remember exactly what the fuck they did 
[00:17:00]  and know where they come from.  You know?  They're dirty, fucking filthy animals,  and that's how they live.  And they come over here,  and all of a sudden they're fucking blonde,  and they forget what their agenda is.  Right on.  Rick, more importantly,  congratulations to your city.  The Pistons lost last night,  so congratulations to...  Thank God.  I'm just a truck driver delivering here, bro.  I'm not even kidding, man,  because if the Pistons won,  you know you lose half the city 
[00:17:30]  every fucking time.  I come from Oklahoma, Texas,  and the Spurs won.  Yeah, the Spurs won.  You don't see them burning down their city.  You don't see them flipping over cars  and dancing on top of them.  They're not in San Antonio, are they?  They're not misbehaving.  No.  No.  I told you the other thing  to flip over there is tortillas.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  Later.  Bye, fella.  Yeah, when Detroit wins a championship,  it gets scary up there.  Yeah.  It gets really scary.  But the Spurs pulled it out last night 
[00:18:00]  and beat the Pistons  to win the NBA championship.  I love how quickly it can change from  I express my opinions,  that's what I do,  to go watch SCTV,  you fucking canuck.  Ah, belt of scotch.  Yeah, right on.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  Bunch of points.  We are assholes.  Oh, just boobs.  Pigninated shitheads.  I was two seconds away 
[00:18:30]  from calling them a fuck face.  But his remark was just sociopathic.  I didn't know how to...  All right, Tracy in Scotland.  Tracy in Scotland.  Yes.  Hi, Tracy.  Hi, Jesus.  Hello.  Hi, Tracy.  Hello.  Are you really calling from Scotland?  Yes, uh-huh.  How are you listening to us?  I find a little poll on the internet.  On the internet.  Wow, nice.  That is the coolest accent ever.  Thank you very much.  What do you do for a living there in Scotland? 
[00:19:00]  Um, I work for a bank,  but I'm on holiday this week.  My kitchen's getting fitted,  so I took the week off.  So...  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  I love this.  Are you speaking English?  Yeah, she's...  You work at the bank.  I heard that.  Your kitchen?  But then she got all revved up,  and I don't know what she started talking.  That's...  We speak the same language.  Yeah, I know.  Wait, what's...  I totally knew when I called,  I'd get ripped a new arsehole, so...  No, no, no, you're not a new arsehole.  We're not repping you. 
[00:19:30]  No, no, we're not repping you.  We just want to know,  what did you say about your kitchen?  Oh, I just got a new kitchen fitted,  so I was just taking the week off,  and this is part of a dare.  Basically, I've been told to phone in.  This is...  And I said I wouldn't,  but now I did.  Yeah.  I'm really...  But you did.  Yeah.  All these great movies that come out from this area,  that's why we have to read subtitles.  It pisses me off.  This is the coolest accent.  It's so great.  You start talking,  and I can't understand a goddamn word you're saying.  Tracy, how were you...  Who turned you on to this radio show? 
[00:20:00]  Someone that calls in now and again to your show  pointed me in the direction of yourself.  Yeah?  I heard some of your stuff when you were off here.  I downloaded a lot of it,  and then I found it would be a look post  so I could hear you on repeat.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  I have no idea.  I got it.  I heard that she was downloading some of our stuff  when we were fired.  Listening to us on repeat.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you from Glasgow?  Glasgow, yeah.  Oh, cool.  Glasgow.  Scottish people are fucking hilarious. 
[00:20:30]  Do you golf?  Sorry?  Do you golf?  Do I help?  No.  Oh, I thought everybody there golfed.  No, no, no.  No, they started the game.  He's calling golf without the L.  Blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  All right, so you work at a bank.  You listen to us on the Internet.  What time is it in Scotland?  It's 20 past 12.  At noon, right?  Yes.  Oh, you guys are the same time as England, right?  Six hours?  Oh, no, you're an hour in difference.  No, they're the same time.  Fuck the Queen. 
[00:21:00]  Someone's suggesting we do a Scottish Bill's Dead prank.  You're kidding.  You're kidding?  Hey, you're a Billy Connolly fan?  Yes, yes.  I've seen him a couple of times.  He's a comedian from Scotland.  He's very funny.  Oh, okay.  He's a funny bastard.  I wonder...  Who else is famous and Scottish?  I don't know.  Just Billy Connolly.  That's it?  No one else?  Isn't Sean Connery? 
[00:21:30]  Sean Connery?  Sean Connery.  I don't really like him much.  Yeah, but he's Scottish.  Yeah, true.  Who were you going to say, Trace?  No, just kissing ass.  Good show.  Really like it.  It's very funny.  Thank you.  But when you do me a wee favour...  What?  ...when you not refer to, like, the whole of Britain as England.  I hate that.  I hate that.  Right.  They really do.  When you call Britain England, why is it they hate when you call Britain England?  It's more of an arrogant thing.  Let England think they're the be-all and end-all. 
[00:22:00]  But there is other parts, like Ireland, where it's Scotland, and I can't stand it.  Okay, so it's almost like when you...  It's the English being arrogant when they say they're from England and not Britain.  Yeah, uh-huh.  All right, well, how about if we just call them America Light?  How about if we call England...  This show is...  We're pretty much...  Hey, we sure kicked their ass, though, didn't we, Tracy?  Can we get a guy from Alabama to call immediately so we can make the contrast of the listeners  that listen to this program?  A couple of little states got together and kicked England's ass is what happened. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, Tracy, are you a wild girl?  Um, I'm going to go now because I know you're going to start your shit.  Ian?  Damn it.  I just thought it'd be cool if we got someone from Scotland to, you know, talk dirty and  have some fun on the phone.  And Ian McGregor.  Ian McGregor.  Right, okay.  Yeah, he's Scottish, right?  Yeah, uh-huh.  Right, okay, I'm going to go before you start.  No, no, no, no.  If you don't want to do that, we won't go down that road.  That's fine.  You're our first Scottish caller ever.  Yeah, and we love the accent, Tracy. 
[00:23:00]  Thank you very much.  No, but I really like the show.  Thank you.  Call back every so often.  Are there other people listening to us all over the world?  I would love to hear from other people today.  Yeah, let us, let us, and spread the word to your friends.  This is great.  I'm trying my best, but there's only ever heard of that.  Did you have to dial eight?  Did you have to dial, like, a hundred numbers to get through?  Um, it took a while to figure out the whole letter thing, because we don't do that nonsense.  It's, like, just numbers.  Right.  Yeah.  And I'm sure it was, like, an international number you had on the website, but I didn't  think that worked, so I just tried to figure it out, go with it. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  Because you don't have the letters.  No, we don't do that.  Well, we, we, uh, it's funny, because their page says that OAP doesn't give the number  out enough, and yet someone in Scotland has it.  Yeah.  It's not said, they figured it out.  The number's on just about every display.  Of course.  Wow, Tracy, that's so cool.  You're a hardcore fan of the show, and you're in Scotland listening on the internet.  You made our day.  Thank you.  Yeah, right on.  We'll see you, Dave.  Thanks very much.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Tracy.  Thanks.  She's a bunny lass.  Well, she'll hear this on the replay.  Tracy, keep in touch.  We'd like to hear from you from time to time.  That is amazing that she was speaking English, and it was like, she'd, you'd get the beginning 
[00:24:00]  of what she says, and then when she'd really start rolling, I'd say, I have no clue what  she's saying.  Yeah, we don't know.  I have no clue.  You'd catch, like, little words.  Kitchen?  Yeah.  What?  Kitchen?  I heard bank.  Kitchen.  And, uh, download.  Let's, uh, say hi to John in Texas.  John?  Yes?  Hey, John.  What's up?  We are trashing it because the Spurs won.  My truck course all fucked up.  Yeah!  And there's the opposite end of the spectrum. 
[00:24:30]  That's relatively normal, though.  It's the Alabama accent that gets me.  All right.  Tracy sounds hot.  Yeah, she sounded really hot.  No, no.  She ain't a dollar in a minute, is she?  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right.  Love you guys.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye.  You know, I was going to go to this one phone call, but he gave up on us.  Talking about the 100 grand call?  Ah, yes.  Another DJ.  Tell him, Fred.  Another DJ getting in trouble for a bit.  We did ten years ago. 
[00:25:00]  God, that's a long time ago.  Dude, I don't think, you know what, I don't want to play the Howard game here.  I don't think anyone ever did the 100 grand bit before we did.  Really?  It's on a CD that we put out about eight years ago.  We did the bit probably two years prior to that.  Our version's probably ten years old now.  We actually would tie bandanas around the candy bar and hand them out.  Do we have that story really fast?  Yeah, DJ, this is like the second or third.  What happened?  What happened?  Some girl is out there with a very low-cut shirt. 
[00:25:30]  Oh.  Is it good or bad?  Oh, jeez.  No, not her.  The other one.  Right there.  I'm not commenting on anything.  Yeah, we put it on a comment.  She might be a sponsor of this show.  Hey, do we have audio of that guy or no, the 100 grand guy?  I am depressed.  Why?  No, that's not the girl that's going to be doing the liberator.  No.  That's not the girl.  Oh, please, God, let it be the girl.  We, we, I swear, if that, we're just turning into a complete male gay show. 
[00:26:00]  Atta boy, Andrew.  Way to go.  No, it just isn't working out.  Who are those girls?  Who are those girls?  Thanks, fella.  Yeah, open the door.  I'll ask for you.  They brought a huge box of sex toys.  It's sitting on the camera.  Oh, nice.  Well, who are they?  Bring them in real fast.  Who are the broads?  Well, I wouldn't call them broads.  Broad?  Is that what I heard?  Yeah.  Jimmy said broads, and then Opie said I wouldn't call them broads. 
[00:26:30]  Wowie.  Hello, ladies.  Hi.  Hi.  You got a very low-cut top on.  I do.  I do have a low-cut top on.  Wow.  For everybody's pleasure.  Right.  Where are you guys from?  I'm from MySexyStore.com.  I brought you guys a box of goodies for your girls that are coming in.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, so you're not the girls that are performing?  No.  Do you want to give the old Liberator a shot?  No, that's okay.  I have one of my own, y'all.  I get them before you guys do.  So you have sex toys and stuff?  Absolutely.  Are you like one of those women we see on HBO, real sex sometimes? 
[00:27:00]  Do you have the parties over your house?  No, I actually don't.  No?  No, I have a party.  I can just have my own, you know.  So you girls don't want to be on the Liberator?  No, I'm good.  Actually, that's my mom.  I was going to ask if you were related, but I don't want to get punched.  That's your mom?  Obviously, you guys got, like, similar boobs.  We do.  I know.  And she's doing the low-cut thing, too.  How old is mom?  She always does.  This is very unusual for me.  Same face.  Mom's going to be 56.  All right.  Way to go, mom.  Mom's got a tat on her tit, too.  Mom has several tats.  Whoa, what are they? 
[00:27:30]  This is my rose, my butterfly, my bass fish with its bubbles, and my father just passed away.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  Thank you.  And this was for my mom, and this is for my dad, and their circle of love is complete.  Right on your tit.  Right on my tit.  That's a tribute if I ever saw one.  Oh, my heart.  Oh, okay.  But I just have big tits to go with the heart.  Your tits getting in the way of your heart there, so that's why.  And is that done recently, that whole thing?  No, this was done 12 years ago.  12 years ago.  Okay.  And this was done a couple of, four days ago. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, that one stretched out a little bit.  You don't want the butterfly looking like a pterodactyl after a while.  You know, that's why I assumed it wasn't, like, from, you know, the 60s or so.  Does mom have bigger boobs than the daughter or what?  No.  I don't know.  Daughter's bigger.  You think?  What are you, a 38 double D?  36 double D.  36 double D.  And mom?  All natural.  Not big.  Are they real?  I don't believe you.  Yeah, they are.  I do.  You guys want to make you out or something?  No.  Jesus.  Opie.  He has to ask. 
[00:28:30]  No.  I know why they call you Opie.  Why?  Look at the hair.  Wait.  Hold on.  That's not, that means I'm losing my hair, like Ron Howard.  No.  All right.  When he was younger.  Yeah, no.  I mean, I'm stuck with this.  He was in Mayberry.  So she has bigger boobs, and you guys don't want to do the Liberator.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry, guys.  I brought you guys lots of toys for the girls that are going to do the Liberator.  You do.  All right.  And what's the name of the store?  MySexyStore.com.  MySexyStore.com. 
[00:29:00]  That's an odd business for a mother and daughter to be in together.  She's actually, she's here visiting because my grandfather passed away, and she just drove  up here.  We drove four hours to bring you guys some stuff.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Thank you.  That's a depressing reason to be up here and to bring sex toys.  I'm very proud of the fact that my daughter works in a store like that.  I love your daughter.  I love my daughter, too.  Yeah.  Do you guys want to get topless or something because you're sad?  Jeez.  That does help the grieving process.  No, it does.  You know, I'm good.  Thanks.  You know, and you guys would appreciate it.  I'm sure.  I know.  Can we see some of the toys, then? 
[00:29:30]  You want some of the toys?  Yeah, if you could.  Yeah, let's get the toys.  Bring one of the interns if you've got to strap something on.  Some of your popular product line here.  Mom and daughter are kind of sexy, actually.  Definitely.  Thank you.  Is your daughter married?  No, the daughter's not.  She's divorced.  Where do you live, daughter?  Upstate New York in Elmira.  Oh, okay.  You live in Elmira?  Yeah, I need to get up there.  I used to film local commercials in Elmira, New York.  Where?  Which station?  I forget. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I was doing cable stuff.  Cable?  And I worked in Geneva, New York, which is higher up, I know.  Wow.  That is a giant butt plug.  Okay.  Well, I was told to bring all different sizes, so you guys have everything.  Butt plugs.  That butt plug is giant.  Oh, and this is really for the Liberator.  Strap on.  Ah, the strap on.  The big time strap on, right?  That's what we're looking for.  Mm-hmm.  And there's movies.  I brought you all movies.  Oh, you got some movies?  Yeah.  Ooh.  There's dildos. 
[00:30:30]  Mighty Kong.  Mighty Kong.  Yeah.  But it's pink.  It's like the size of your arm.  Let me see.  Mom, what?  She already raided the box.  Did she?  In the car.  She's like, wait, wait, wait.  You can't take that to them until I see what I want.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you pick out what you like there, Mom?  She did.  Hey, Mom, what's your favorite sex toy?  You got to come in.  My favorite.  Oh, just, um, I can't tell you on the air.  No?  I guess I can on this show, can I?  Sure.  No, I, you know, just a variety of things.  I have some that are.  Some that vibrate, maybe? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, I have lots that vibrate.  You like the vibrator?  Yeah, I like the, I like the.  What's the name of your favorite one?  Come on.  I don't even know what the name of it is.  Probably the Cleopatra.  Yeah, me.  Oh, Mom likes the Cleopatra, huh?  I like.  The Osaki twisters are awesome.  What does that do?  It's a, it's a dildo, it's a vibrator, it's a big dong with lots of different levels of  remote control.  Really?  Nice.  And the remote control butterfly.  It's the Cadillac of vibrators, Anthony.  There's a really awesome one, it's a, it's called a butterfly and it doesn't have any wires, 
[00:31:30]  so like the guy can have the remote.  Oh, really?  It's like a wireless thing?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  She uses it and then he can sit there and work the remote.  Control the remote.  Yeah.  Great.  It's very sweet.  I have one myself.  Oh, you do?  I do.  Right now?  Yeah.  Right now?  No, not on.  I know, right?  I should put it on and like, get off the remote.  You make her go talk to people and you press it?  I sent you all one.  Yeah, you want one?  You all have one here.  You have one here in the studio.  Ooh.  Ooh.  You have one. 
[00:32:00]  I sent you one for the call.  You know, you just broke our rule.  Someone is reminding us on the phones here.  Well, let me have Mark say it on the air.  Mark from Oklahoma City.  Mark, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  I got to call you out on something, Oak.  What's that?  The other day you said to have the interns put a sign on your door that said all women  that come in the studio have to be naked.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did have that whole thing.  What's up, man?  They're in there now and I bet they...  Well, I think we have to make an exception for a mother-daughter team.  And they brought a sex toy because they brought a sex toys and they weren't here to be naked. 
[00:32:30]  They were actually just bringing us things to be nice.  So there's a difference between someone coming in to promote a website that they're not doing  what they're supposed to be doing.  Okay.  All right.  Guess you'll let you off the hook.  Have a good one, boys.  Thanks, fella.  Yeah, mom, daughter, what happens?  And we're just backpedaling asses, too.  Of course we are.  What happens is we have a...  Say one thing, do another.  We have a lot of strippers that come in and then they do nothing at all.  So we wanted like a note on the door that you have to be naked before you even come in here.  Oh.  But you guys came not to get naked to bring all this great stuff for other people to get naked. 
[00:33:00]  So I think we have to make an exception.  And last time I brought a girl who did get naked, though.  I brought Sunset with me last time.  Sunset Thomas?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And she got naked for y'all.  Yeah, she was very fun.  Yeah.  A lot of fun.  She's very cool.  And look what I brought for you guys.  This is for the guys.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that.  It's a candy thong.  You remember those candy necklaces?  When you were a kid?  Oh, yeah.  That's actually pretty thong.  We hate the candy.  We have a little problem with candy underwear. 
[00:33:30]  Why?  But that one is kind of cool.  I got to admit.  It's cool.  Because that's not going to melt right away.  We hate the stuff that is like, what is it called?  It's like...  Oh, edible panties.  Yeah, like fruit roll-ups.  Fruit roll-ups.  They melt.  Yeah, they melt immediately.  It's just a mess for everybody.  See, those are those little beads.  You're not supposed to have them on that long.  Those are like those things you wear around your neck.  Yeah.  And remember you used to like chew on them.  They're like little beads, but they're candy.  And they get all sticky on the string.  Yeah, I would...  Oh, what are you going to...  Ooh, that one's spitting out pubes. 
[00:34:00]  No.  No?  Why?  Not if she's young enough.  Or, I don't know.  I guess most girls I know shave.  Shave?  Yeah.  Yeah, the shaving's a big time in.  Shaving is huge.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yuck.  I like it all gone.  All gone?  All gone.  All gone.  All gone.  You shave everything, right?  Almost everything.  Almost.  Almost everything.  What do you leave?  A little Hitler mustache?  Just a little strip, yeah.  A little mohawk?  Yeah, yeah.  Friction protection.  Oh, it's very good. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Keeps the panties from...  Sometimes that looks really silly, though.  I got to tell you.  No, you don't wear panties?  No.  No underpants?  Ever?  No, ever.  Can we see?  No.  And you're wearing a dress?  Yeah.  Isn't that hot?  The wind just kind of blows right up there and...  Why not?  Keeps you cool and nice.  Absolutely.  I'm in the sex business.  I can do pretty much anything I want.  You're just on time for our headstand contest.  Ooh, I was doing that years ago.  Tell them, Fred.  Fred ain't saying shit.  I know.  I wish I hadn't worn a dress. 
[00:35:00]  I would have showed you guys my tattoo, but I can't.  What's the tattoo of?  It's of an angel.  And where is it?  On my back.  It's a big angel.  All right, let's...  We can figure this out.  Yeah, do it.  You can hold your boobs in place.  All right, lower the curtains.  Yeah, just to see your tattoo.  That's not normal.  You can't tease us with that and then, like, not do it.  You see how these guys are trained?  Oh, we're going to lower the curtains.  All right.  We have to over human resources.  All right.  Mom will hold your boobs or something.  Look at these guys.  Mom.  Mom's here.  Nothing's going to happen to you.  Nothing's going to happen to her daughter.  She just got this.  She just got this?  Oh, you did?  It's not even.  All right.  Here she's getting naked. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, she did.  She's...  Now, what exactly?  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Why do you have an angel?  In honor of my grandfather.  Wow.  You guys are just all about tattooing your bodies when someone dies in the family, huh?  He's a pretty special guy.  I understand that.  That's a nice tat.  Wow.  Very nice.  Wait, what is...  I'm sorry.  Can you turn around now?  No.  Damn it!  Damn it!  I'm actually looking...  You got to move your right arm.  I do?  I mean, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay, no, I'm...  That's it.  That's very nice.  That's better.  Now you can see the whole thing.  I didn't see the tattoo.  I was just looking at her from the side.  I was trying to see her hands.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of looking underneath there.  Look, see?  Yeah.  Look at y'all.  You see that?  Oh, damn it.  Look at 14.  Look, you got a very nice set of natural boobs.  I know, right?  My God.  Thank you.  She's very...  She's shy.  I saw a little...  I saw a little something from the side opening.  I know.  I did, too.  Yeah.  That was the whole object of showing the tat.  Of course.  Try to get a little...  Do you have...  Do you have a fella?  Huh? 
[00:36:30]  Do you have a fella?  Sort of.  Yeah.  That means no, but I don't like you.  Yeah.  No.  It means it's only like five weeks, and we're having sex.  That means she has a fella, but she's still looking.  Yeah.  If something better comes along, she'll kick his ass right out the door.  Oh, is that what that means?  Yeah.  No, it means it's five weeks, so...  How long were you married for?  I was married for 13 years.  Wow.  13 years?  Then what happened?  I don't know.  I got smart.  Really?  Yeah.  He's an asshole.  Was he an asshole?  Yeah.  Oh.  Was he an asshole the whole time, and you just woke up one day and said, yeah, this guy 
[00:37:00]  really is...  High school sweetheart.  Look at Mom.  Mom, when did you realize the guy was an asshole?  When he was 16.  Day one, right?  They met at 16?  They met.  And you were 13?  She was 13.  I like this guy.  That's hot.  I know.  I mean, that's sick.  Terrible.  Or something.  Yeah.  I begged her not to marry him.  Begged her.  And you got married...  How old were you?  17.  17.  You got married at 17?  Like right when you were old enough.  Not pregnant either.  No.  Do you have kids?  I do now.  How many kids?  Just one. 
[00:37:30]  How old?  My son just turned 16.  Wow.  Hi, boo.  You have a 16-year-old son?  I do.  Wait.  How old are you?  35.  Wow, you look great.  You really do.  Thank you very much.  16.  I guess that's kind of cool if you're 16 and your mother's, you know, 35.  I mean, all his friends, believe me, leer at you.  But they have to.  Oh, yeah.  Big time.  And they know what you do for a living, all of his friends?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, hey, your mom's dildos.  Your mom's so cool.  No, we have a box of condoms.  He sells them to his friends. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Do you bring them home girls?  If you know Sunset, you should bring them some girls.  Well, it's not that way.  It's not that way.  I mean, for him, it's just one of mom's friends coming home.  He doesn't think of it as, you know, oh, she's a porn star.  She comes over for dinner.  You know, she calls on the phone.  It's a little different.  When did you lose the big virginity?  Me?  I was 15.  I don't remember.  You held out for two years with the guy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I was 15, almost 16.  Just heavy petting before that? 
[00:38:30]  A lot of petting, yeah.  A little heavy petting?  Did you give up the mouth?  The mouth?  Did you give up the mouth?  See, you know what?  I don't understand.  Wait a phrase it.  Girls do not like blowjobs.  I don't understand it.  I love blowjobs.  They're great.  So do I.  I know.  See, that's called having something in common.  That's common ground.  So you were given those before you gave up the, yeah.  See, that'll tide the guy over for two years.  It's not like you just waited two years and then, you know, decided to give it up to the 
[00:39:00]  guy.  You've got to give him a little something, right?  You've got to think that you gave up the TF, too.  When did you start developing those lovely cans?  I was 15 when I got them.  15 when you got them?  And did it happen like over summer vacation or something?  It was like over summer.  You came back to school and you were huge?  I got these boobs and these friggin' hips.  And what the hell do you do with those?  Yeah.  And were the guys or your boyfriend or whatever it was at the time interested in the TF? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  No.  No?  No, he was really shy.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He still is to this day.  Yeah.  He's very, very sexually introverted.  Your ex-husband, I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So when you hooked up, it wasn't...  Because you would look at those and just go, that's a great place for a penis.  But I...  Right between there.  I was 13, you know.  All right.  That's a really great place.  The pedophilia over here.  That's such a negative name for it. 
[00:40:00]  I know.  I just call him friend of the younger generation.  Speaking of which, one of our young go-getters that is barely a boy, he's walking around with  a Michael Jackson t-shirt today.  Who is wearing a Michael Jackson t-shirt?  Bring him in.  The guy is barely a boy.  Is he?  Here, I'll lend him my sweater.  He can use it.  Look at this kid.  And here he goes.  Look at this kid.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Poor form.  Look, he's even got the same hair.  Very similar.  Hey, young go-getter, what's your name? 
[00:40:30]  I'm Sam.  Oh, he's Sam.  That's right.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, everybody.  And Sam has a Michael Jackson shirt on.  It's the old Michael Jackson with the afro and the black skin.  And it says Michael underneath it.  It's in a circle right on the front of your black t-shirt.  Yes, it is.  You've owned that for how long?  Probably two years.  Two years.  And you saw it somewhere and bought it?  Well, a friend of mine bought it for me because they thought I would appreciate the ironic 
[00:41:00]  humor in it.  Why?  They, uh, I don't know.  What nationality are you?  I guess you didn't appreciate it.  I'm just white.  No, white.  I know you're white, but I mean...  Just European, French, Dutch, English.  Cool.  So what's the humor in it?  Yeah, what's the ironic humor?  He looks much different now than he did at this point.  And, uh, I guess that's where the humor for some would be found.  Cool.  They must really know how to search. 
[00:41:30]  Who are your friends, Lewis and Clark?  Exactly.  All right, well, that's great.  And you wear it proudly, I guess.  Yes, I think so, yeah.  You're not hoping to get molested or anything, are you?  Um, I'm hoping not, not to get molested.  Yeah, it's a little, it looks like advertising.  Yeah, no, I'd rather not, not get molested.  Get looks walking down the sidewalk?  People kind of look like, why is that?  I get more compliments than looks, actually.  Oh, compliments.  Surprisingly.  What do they call it?  They say, hey, nice shirt. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, where'd you get that shirt?  You know, in a good way.  Hey, why are you wearing that shirt in this bathhouse?  You like those boobs over there?  Sure.  Yes.  Sure, yeah.  I wouldn't.  All right.  Where are you from, Sam?  Hmm?  Where are you from?  I'm from, uh, Westchester, near Seattle.  Cool.  Westchester.  Yes.  All right.  One of our young go-getters.  Young intern.  Thank you.  Svelte swimmer's build.  Good boy.  Michael Jackson.  There you go, Sam.  What is Michael Jackson t-shirt today? 
[00:42:30]  All right, ladies.  Oh, I see you, uh, you guys mutilated the doll I sent you.  Oh, that's, uh, that was you?  You sent that?  I did.  I sent the blow-up doll.  Well, Steve, Steve C.  Anytime you guys get stuff, it's for me.  Steve C.  Steve C.  Steve C.  He's a little crazy, and, uh, he decided...  Oh, Steve did it.  She needed to have her head chopped off.  Yeah, we decided to chop the head off the blow-up doll.  Yeah.  You guys have a butterfly here, too, by the way, so we got to get that before the girls  come out.  We do.  We sent it to Steve.  Uh-oh.  Who knows where it might be now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to smell like Lebanese hiney.  Hey, do you sell, um, do you sell century sex in your store? 
[00:43:00]  That's our favorite video of all time.  You know, I don't know.  We proudly display it up there.  I don't know.  I brought you guys, like, anal pounding.  No, you don't understand.  Bring down the box.  This is century sex.  They're claiming this woman was 100 years old when she got banged.  Look at the pictures on the back.  Oh, my God.  She's got a body like E.T.  She's got a body, all right.  Isn't that sexy?  Supposedly, she's, like, 80, 85, but they're trying to claim that she was 100 when she made  this film.  Ron Jeremy banged in one of those films. 
[00:43:30]  He was able to in one of those films.  Really?  Yeah.  Really.  Ron's a professional.  He's constantly professional.  Got a rod and everything?  Because the guy in this movie, he can't even keep a rod.  He's just, oh, he's disgusting.  Ron might have, he might have had a soggy six or something like that.  Well, can you blame him?  No, no, no.  I'm saying it doesn't stop.  Oh, look.  Oh, Steve brings a merchandise.  I didn't even take it out of the box.  Here you go.  A butterfly.  What is your butterfly?  This is the one I was telling you guys about.  It's a remote control butterfly.  Yeah.  Like, you know, there's no wires.  Let's, uh, let me see.  You guys put it on the girl, and then you can control it.  Can we, like, hook it up to you? 
[00:44:00]  No.  Damn it.  She said no to everything.  Let's check that out.  Come on.  I showed you the tattoo.  I took off my shirt, sort of.  Eh, sort of.  All right.  We'll, uh, hook this up to somebody today.  Well, it leaves more to the, it leaves more to the imagination.  Oh, I got it.  It's like a, uh, almost like a G-string that she puts on, and the butterfly thing goes right  over her, uh, her area.  Ooh.  And I guess it's vibrate.  It's called a clitoris?  There's nothing, uh, yes, it's called a clitoris.  There's nothing that goes inside, right? 
[00:44:30]  No.  Yeah, this is all external.  Yep.  And then, uh, it's got a little remote.  Yeah, it's got a bullet right in the butterfly.  Does it vibrate on the clitoris?  Yeah.  It's like good words.  Oh, I know.  You should shout it.  You know what I like doing after you're done with this?  You, uh, you, uh, strangle her and then shove it down her throat for a detective to find  later.  Ah, it signifies change.  Nice.  Very nice.  You guys are bad.  The chrysalis or double-headed dildo. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Let's get the mother-daughter team out of here for now.  Yeah, the same.  We got it.  Thank you, Mary.  What are your names again?  I'm, I'm Robin.  Robin?  Robin and Pam.

There's also a part on there that's Robin's Recommends, so you guys get to, like, check it out.  I put different stuff on there.  And I use all of the stuff.  Did it creep you out?  Like, because, you know, I mean, you guys seem like you have a good relationship, but  did it ever creep you out that mom would ask for something?  Like, and you're like, ugh.  No.  Like, did you ever give her a dildo?  And she's like, well, do you have it in black? 
[00:45:30]  No.  I call her up and I'll be like, Mom, oh my God, I had the most amazing sex last night.  You're not going to fucking...  Really?  What are you saying?  You can curse on here.  I'm sorry.  No, it sounds like you can curse.  We don't care.  You can curse on this show.  What was so good about the last time?  The last time I had sex?  Yeah.  No, the, the, you know, you're talking about it now, like, you had to call your mom.  What was the situation?  Oh.  That it was so great that you had to call mom and tell her.  Yeah.  Oh.  I was having, I was, I was giving a blowjob, a roadhead, if you will.  Oh.  And we stopped at a rest area and had sex in my car.  You're a good egg.  Very nice.  I know.  I love her. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  Wow.  I thought her well.  You did?  Oh.  Yeah.  In the backseat of the Packard bump.  I'm not that old.  What a creep.  No, but I got pregnant for her in a car.  You did?  Oh, absolutely.  What car?  We were in a Plymouth Valiant.  Ah.  Well, you must have been young when you had her, too, because she's 35.  I mean, you had to be, obviously.  About 21.  20, 21.  My husband was gone for the reserves, and he came home, and we were staying at his parents' house, 
[00:46:30]  and, of course, we couldn't do anything at his parents' house, because our bedroom was right next door.  I said, get in the car.  We're going.  We put the baby in the front seat.  Wait, you have an older sibling?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  My brother.  How old is your brother?  I'm 35.  Bro's 37.  Wow.  He's way cool.  Wow.  So you were pregnant at 18 then, right, if I'm doing the math right?  Yes.  Nice.  Okay.  Mom's a goer.  We conceived in the backseat of a car. 
[00:47:00]  Nice.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  You're a little fanny fertile there, aren't you?  Yeah, and all that.  Yeah.  Where were you guys parked?  We were parked in Corning, New York.  Sure.  They make a lot of glass up there.  Side road.  A little side road?  Just a little side road.  Yeah.  We found a little privacy, you know?  Who knows?  You could have been making a nice little family, ending up in a shallow grave.  Either way, you know, it's those old dirt roads there. 
[00:47:30]  Speaking of the old dirt roads.  In other states, it wasn't scary to do that stuff.  No?  No.  It's frightening now, the woods.  You've got to stay away from the woods.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mom, you still pounding away?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Very good.  Do you shave?  Yes.  Do you keep it shaved down there?  Yeah.  Mom's a trooper.  I like mom.  Absolutely.  That's nice.  Very good.  I thought it was only my mom I could talk like this, but it's not.  I like my men's shave, too.  Do you really?  Oh, you do?  Absolutely.  I don't shave.  All the way?  Oh, yeah.  I shave them if they're willing. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Absolutely.  Oh, mom's a pervert.  Wow.  She's a pervert.  Do you want to shave Jimmy down today?  Now, wait a minute.  If women can do it, why can't men?  You're absolutely right.  Jimmy, you need a shaving?  No, I can't.  No.  I did it when I was 15, and it just tickled.  I had to whack myself in a cloth.  It hurt for a month.  You know what?  When a woman shaves, nothing else is really coming in contact with the patch that's been shaved.  Maybe a little on the thighs during walking or something.  With a guy, it's like your sack becomes a pin cushion. 
[00:48:30]  You just shove down your pants.  And it's very needle-like on your dick when you try to...  I don't know.  The last guy that I dated for a couple of years, I shaved him all the time, and he loved it.  Really?  I tried to talk him into it for about six months, and finally he did it one day when  he got intoxicated.  That's always what does it.  Yeah.  And he...  You get drunk, and it's a great idea.  He swore he'd never, ever grow his hair back again.  How long do you have to shave it before...  How often do you have to do it as a guy before it starts to get uncomfortable and come back? 
[00:49:00]  Because if I could just keep it shaved and have nothing come back, I'd be fine.  No, it always winds up looking like Homer Simpson's beard or Fred Flintstone's mouth.  It gets a little grub on there.  Just a perpetual shadow that just hurts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It does.  You have to do it about every week, maybe two weeks.  They clean up every week.  What about waxing?  Can you wax your...  Oh, no.  I wouldn't recommend that.  Just dip your nuts in some bubbling wax.  Just put a candle on your bag. 
[00:49:30]  Rip it off.  All right, Mom.  Do we have to go?  No, I told her not to lift the box.  Oh.  That somebody else could do it for you.  Oh, yeah.  You don't do any heavy lifting.  We have slaves, interns here.  Yeah, that box has got to weigh 30 pounds.  30 pounds of sex toys in that box.  Yeah, there's a lot of toys in there.  You guys did better think through them.  Well, we'll get them back on the air a little later.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  We're going to have a little party today, it looks like.  All right.  Thank you, ladies.  Thanks for having us.  Thank you.  All right.  They're nice.  Very nice.  Drop something.  What a great mother-daughter team there. 
[00:50:00]  I like them.  She's sexy, that Robin, man.  She's a sexy girl.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Yes.  She is definitely sexy.  I like the mom.  See ya?  No, I'm just kidding.  I want to double date me and you.  You look in the back seat, I just wink at me.  Then we'll get the girls in.  We can play Back to the Future.  Oh, very good. 
[00:50:30]  Nice.  Yeah, sure.  Well, now we have the toys.  We have the strap-on.  We have the Liberator.  All we are looking for now are girls that are going to get completely naked.  Completely naked, Steve.  Where's Ben?  They will.  Ben was hilarious.  He was calling everyone today because I guess after the show yesterday, Steve was negotiating  with these women and these companies.  And Ben says it's hilarious what Steve has to go through. 
[00:51:00]  And I do remember, and I think we talked about it on the show once, coming back from Washington,  Steve was making some of his calls and doing his business calls, which is talking to porn  chicks and negotiating with them.  And I'm so glad someone else finally got to hear this firsthand because I couldn't believe  it on a crowded train, the stuff Steve would say out loud.  Oh, you used to hear in regular business guys talking about, you know, the paperwork.  Yeah, yeah.  We got to get those reports in on the Wilson account or else we're not going to make deadline. 
[00:51:30]  And there's Steve.  Okay, you've got to shove it up your ass.  Like, what?  What do you do for a listen?  Steve really is a piece of shit.  Steve's talking about sticking carrots up chicks' asses yesterday.  He's like, why are you sticking a carrot and a piece of asparagus up a chick's ass?  Really?  Derek and I are just sitting there laughing our asses off.  Steve's like, wow, this is typical negotiations, you know?  It's typical.  How many different food groups will she take in her ass? 
[00:52:00]  We're up to grains and cereals.  Can we pound that up your ass with a plunger?  All right, well, forget the soy, but you have to settle for tofu.  What happened, Derek?  It really was bad.  Like, I thought it was just a joke.  It's just food groups and inanimate objects, and he's just talking about shoving stuff up girls.  He's so paranoid now, Steve.  We have made him so paranoid that these girls have got to perform that he doesn't want anything left to the imagination anymore. 
[00:52:30]  He wants to know everything these girls are willing to do.  There is zero subtlety when it comes to talking to these people.  Because you're the guy that catches shit.  Because I'm the guy that has to catch shit, and I'm the guy who has to endure the shitstorm when these girls don't perform.  Absolutely.  And so every possible scenario has to be spelled out to see where their line is.  Because everybody talks very vague when it comes to this stuff.  You know, the people...  Ben's losing his mind.  He's like, well, if you take a carrot and you shove it up your ass, will that work? 
[00:53:00]  No, no, no, no.  I mean, like, on the other end, you have...  Now, Anthony can't talk.  I love Ben.  The people on the other end go, yeah, no, it's great.  We're going to send girls over.  They're going to have a good time.  Oh, they'll do anything.  And then they come in and do nothing.  And then I stop the mid-sentence and go, okay, look, let's clearly define anything.  And then you have to...  Yeah.  And then you absolutely have to say, here's what I want.  I'm going to have two Liberator couches.  I'm going to have a box full of dildos.  Yeah.  And I want these girls fully naked performing with all of the above. 
[00:53:30]  Not sitting on the Liberator and giving a faux blowjob to one of the dildos fully clothed.  Or the awful ass smack.  Yeah.  That awful ass smack while they hold the dildo and maybe tap that on their butt.  No.  It's got to disappear.  Right.  Exactly.  And that's...  But you realize, after you have that conversation, that's what they're talking about.  They're talking about fake blowjobs and ass slapping.  Yeah.  We're, you know...  We're talking full penetration.  And you realize that there is a distinct line between strippers and adult performers.  Yes.  And they are not the same thing.  Strippers don't do it. 
[00:54:00]  Strippers don't do it.  And adult performers, we have to pull teeth with them, too.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So there's no dental records when they find their body laying in the woods.  Precisely.  So it's just...  Dental records.  That's right.  I just think.  That's right.  You're eating pound cake.  Oh, I love it.  Can we pound it up a girl's ass?  You ask.  And all of the adult companies are on the West Coast primarily.  So you've got to book these things four weeks out and have the girls flown in, which  is exactly what we did with these.  Great.  Good call.  You can't go with Joe Galanto, man. 
[00:54:30]  He knows a lot of...  Joe's getting the girls from the West Coast, too.  Oh, yeah.  I'm pretty confident in today's...  I'm thinking of my work today.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I'm thinking so, too.  But the negotiations that go on, it's really, really funny.  Because I heard it firsthand, and now these guys finally heard it.  Oh, Jesus.  And he's not shy.  He doesn't care who's around.  Steve's just got no scruples.  Obviously, yesterday at the show, whatever, it's just us.  Awful person.  But just imagine him negotiating the same shit you guys heard on a crowded train coming  back from Washington with business guys.  You can't be vague anymore.  You know, you try to be cutesy, and you wind up...  Vague.  There's a line between vague and just... 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And you...  You're a horrible man.  I'm going to put you up in a tree in Jersey and let the cops shoot you down.  There's absolutely no reason to be subtle, because subtlety, you know, you leave room  for error.  Right.  So let's clearly define exactly what I want to see.  No room for error.  We want room for carrots and asparagus and anything else.  Actually, the context of that conversation was somebody talking about what was happening  three years ago when we had some of the girls... 
[00:55:30]  Right.  I remember.  You said the girl initiated that conversation.  Oh, she did.  Remember Madison?  She did.  There was a...  She was the one that put the asparagus up her ass.  The person I was talking to yesterday was someone in the city who had heard that show,  and she was referencing that, and that's where that was from.  Ooh.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a good icebreaker.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  What?  Jimmy farted.  What?  I didn't...  He just chased everyone out of here.  I didn't fart.  Everyone left.  Dude, we were having a fun conversation.  You just cleared the room.  Well, where'd they go? 
[00:56:00]  You just cleared the whole fucking room.  Ah, they have to toughen up and be men who are on the radio.  Dude, we had another good five or ten minutes to get out of them.  Oh, but get them.  Get back in there.  I didn't smell it yet or anything because I'm really covering up.  But it must have been so fucking bad because everyone just fled the room.  I'm telling you, it's not.  It's not.  Get them back in there.  No.  Now you've got to go to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, Ben, I was wondering if your hog was involved in the negotiation.  No girl could possibly take that.  Very good.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Steve, get back in here, though.  There's a new E-Rock promo.  E-Rock.  This is the latest thing the boys are doing behind the scenes.  This is, E-Rock is one of Ben's favorite catchphrases.  I'm hearing from everybody that Ben just walks around the complex here only saying,  E-Rock or tell him, Fred.  He'll just walk around and blurt it out.  It doesn't matter what he's doing.  He'll just walk around going, E-Rock, E-Rock, tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Like a fucking lunatic.  That is a two-phrase ass. 
[00:57:00]  No matter what's going on, the phrase he'll adopt and just say it over and over.  Yeah, and it's infectious.  You just can't stop because Ben just constantly, constantly repeats it,  and it just infects everybody else until you have no choice but to start making production.  He says, E-Rock.  His hog jumps out, says, tell him, Fred.  He's doing ventriloquism with it.  But he doesn't put any punchline there.  Like, after the Randy Johnson, he'll just call and go, hey, it's Randy Johnson.  Oh, no.  I know, and he just walks around.  E-Rock, right?  E-Rock.  Tell him, Fred. 
[00:57:30]  I was in Boston.  What?  Punchline-ness buffoon.  He definitely needs a writer for his character.  He just tries to improv, and he just kind of fades quickly.  Mark Prentil.  Oh, I have nothing.  Hey, hey, hey.  And he claps a lot.  E-Rock.  Yeah, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  That is a redundant boob.  So, Eric, who sits to my left for the entire show.  He started out as Sex Bagel.  Then we tried Hawk.  Hawk, because of his appearance of the big hawks that were nesting in the building. 
[00:58:00]  He did one of the better assaults on the media, where he acted like a hawk.  And now it's down to E-Rock.  E-Rock.  How did it get to E-Rock?  I know, okay, Eric is the E part.  And then is it a takeoff on the E-Lo thing a little bit?  Where does The Rock come from?  It's the instant messenger name that I use.  Who?  Oh, is that it?  So, you made up your own nickname.  There's a family thing.  A family thing?  My cousins have been calling me that for years. 
[00:58:30]  It's stupid.  Your cousin C-Rock?  Yeah.  What kind of family thing?  What are you, one of the Flintstones?  That's awful.  But I am E-Rock.  I am E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-R-O-C-K?  Yeah.  With a dash in it?  No.  Just all one.  Just one?  That's confusing.  It's kind of like E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  All right, well.  I'm calling you E-Rock.  So now these guys, they don't really care if the promos make sense anymore.  They don't care if the listeners don't get it.  How about Key Rock? 
[00:59:00]  I am Key Rock.  I am Key Rock!  So when Kirk couldn't get his name right, he went into the temple and the door shut.  He got shocked.  And he found his little Indian girl named Miramani.  And he thought his name was...  They go, what's your name?  And he's trying to remember, and he goes...  He's trying to say Kirk, and he goes...  Key Rock.  And they still call him Key Rock.  E-Rock.  That's ridiculous.  So they're making...  You're a beautiful woman.  They're making E-Rock promos now. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  That make no sense to anybody, but it just makes...  Except them?  It just makes Steve and Ben laugh.  It really does.  Like little girls.  And we get everybody in on it.  We send the interns down on the street with recorders and have them gather audio.  Oh, is this what this one is?  E-Rock, don't.  E-Rock.  All right.  Don't.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Here's the latest promo.  The latest E-Rock promo.  This is replacing the whole Ramon thing, I guess.  This is Steve's latest creation.  Go ahead, Derek.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio. 
[01:00:00]  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself, and he's just ugly, and his nose is falling off.  I don't love it.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual, incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him.  He's not really that smart.  I'm sure I can go fuck himself.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock made an appearance, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  E-Rock.  There you go.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  E-Rock, dude.  Fuck, Breno.  He's always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  That's another thing he does.  Punchlines get a zero at this idiot, but you need some coffee.  It's hilarious.  Fucking displaced emotions, boob.  He loves when we're miserable, asking legitimate questions. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, that's funny.  And his answer is always that he'll just laugh at you.  Ben, because they own it.  Cricket, cricket, cricket.  Ben, it's really cold in here.  E-Rock.  Oh, God.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  That is great.  It's a smart haircut you have.  Thank you, Jim.  Great.  All right, well, we're going to take our first break.  I don't even know if we accomplished anything this first hour, but a lot of fun.  We've got to talk about the Spidey Rapist, because it's just so much fun. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Jesus, we'll get into that next.  Anthony had a very good observation on the Spidey Rapist.  That's Spidey Rapist.  That's Spidey Rapist.  And Oprah Winfrey.  Oprah.  We'll get into those two stories next, and the 100 grand thing, I guess.  Dave, if you could hold through the break, stay there.  From Cape Cod.  Ah, tell him, Fred.  Give us something cool, Derek.  Give some.  Give me the ring, give me the witch's man.  Bring it an old Le-Roy, Le-Roy.  Need of the head, need of the drawing.  Him-a-gur-himm-a-gur-himm-a-gur-himm-a-gur-well-and-with-it. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Which?  What?  Why?  Where?  Sure.  What?  What?  Who?  Oh, why?  We have problems.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Just how do you believe?  Will you fight the hand at me?  Will you chew until it bleeds?  Can you get up off your knees?  Are you brave enough to see? 
[01:02:30]  Do you want to change it?  He's back.  That's all right, Hawk.  He's having a little secret rendezvous in the bathroom with little Jimmy.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ah.  Taking a leak.  Dr. Leakey.  Leakey.  Let's go back to the phones.  Dave and Cape Cod.  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Good morning.  Do you guys see the radio stations around are rehashing your old bits again? 
[01:03:00]  We do have to talk about this because we did get a lot of email overnight.  A real lot of email.  It's this 100-gram bit that...  This is always a tough discussion because you don't want to sound like Howard Stern.  You don't want to sound like Howard with the ripping me off thing.  But the reality is, and Howard doesn't explain this when he goes off on this whole ripping  me off thing, but radio is filled with a bunch of scumbags, a bunch of uncreative scumbags 
[01:03:30]  that hide behind the fact that no one's going to hear them in their little markets.  And what happens is, there's a lot of guys that will just flat out rip off all the radio  guys.  It has been happening forever in radio.  Forever.  You know?  And now with the internet and websites and stuff, you know, these guys, that's how they  show prep for their little tiny little morning shows all over the country.  They find really good bits that other guys did, and they just do it.  And then no one happens. 
[01:04:00]  You know, years go by, and everyone gets confused, and no one knows where the bit even came from  anymore.  And that's what's really frustrating.  Tell them, Fred.  This whole 100-gram thing, all I'll tell you is, Anthony and I, you know, put out the  bit on a CD about eight years ago.  We did the bit probably nine or ten years ago.  Yeah.  This 100-gram bit.  And I swear to you, I'd never heard anyone do it before.  No.  There's not a tape that exists of anyone doing it before we did.  And recently, a lot of DJs are doing this bit for some reason. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  And I don't know if it's because our CD is, you know, making its way all over the internet.  I have no idea.  You know, I'm not going to claim that this guy, you know, grabbed it from us, but this  is happening now.  A lot of people are getting in trouble for doing this 100-gram bit that we did eight to ten  years ago.  And the latest is, well, Eric had the story up, but I don't know where he is now, so pop a  couple of those browsers.  You'll probably find it.  All right.  Give me that story.  Here it comes.  E-Rock.  Where's the story? 
[01:05:00]  But there are so many uncreative fucks in radio that do this on a daily basis.  A daily basis.  And that's where Howard is completely correct.  Completely.  A Kentucky woman is suing WLTO Hot 102 Lexington after a prize she won from the station turned  out to be a Nestle's 100-grand candy bar and not $100,000, as she had believed.  Court documents posted on the SmokingGun.com show that, oh, show that in the lawsuit, sorry, 
[01:05:30]  Norisha Gill claims she was listening to WLTO on the evening of May 25th when DJ Slick announced  that he would award $100,000 to the 10th caller.  Gill was the 10th caller, and she was told she could pick up her prize the following day.  Imagine her surprise and utter disappointment when she went to the studio and found that  the contest was a joke and she had simply won a chocolate bar and not the cash. 
[01:06:00]  Gill is suing the station's parent company, Cumulus Media, for breach of contract.  The suit states that representations were made with intent to cheat, defraud, and play a  malicious joke upon the plaintiff before the entire listening audience due to her reasonable  reliance upon the on-air representations of DJ Slick.  Basically, lawyer talk right there.  Her lawsuit seeks the $100,000 prize plus interest and punitive damages. 
[01:06:30]  What scumbag lawyers are.  Punitive damages.  Ugh.  What punitive damages are there?  Fucking lawyers.  Punitive damages you're giving me.  What punitive damages?  Gill.  Gill.  Norisha Gill said, before the family went to bed, Gill promised her children, age 1, 5,  and 11, that they'd have a minivan and a shopping spree, a savings account, and a home with a 
[01:07:00]  backyard for $100,000?  Kentucky.  They would have had $85,000 left over.  28, she's got an 11-year-old slut.  I wonder if she also promised her children that she'd stop fucking eventually.  Wow, they offered her $5,000, huh?  Offered her $5,000?  She said, I wanted $95,000 more.  Nobody would watch and listen for two hours for a candy bar. 
[01:07:30]  How about one of these radio stations just tell somebody, shut up, it was a joke.  I know.  You're a faggot.  Shut your mouth.  That's what it is these days.  When you have a joke played on you, it's a money-making opportunity, and now you can  turn around and sue, and there's lawyers that'll take the case.  What hurts me is that they were going to get me in front of my children, all dressed up,  and hand me a candy bar.  After all those promises I made to them, you just don't do that to people.  DJ Slick.  DJ Slick, I guarantee, didn't even do the bit right, and that's why he's in trouble 
[01:08:00]  and the radio station's in trouble.  Right, because he said something that would indicate it was money.  Exactly.  When Ant and I did it back in the day, you make perfectly clear, you say 100 grand, 100  grand, 100 grand.  He probably said, there's 100 grand, you can buy whatever you want.  Oh, yeah, all that stuff.  We never said that.  We just said, we're giving away 100 grand.  That's all we ever said.  I was going to go get my herded.  That's what she's saying?  Of course.  We're going to get all dutied up.  She promised him a minivan.  Yeah.  And a boat ramp. 
[01:08:30]  Some car seats.  All right, Dave, thank you.  That DJ got fired, too.  Of course.  Cumulus, what do you expect?  Now they're facing stuff from the FCC, it was saying.  Yeah.  The DJ got fired because he just did the bit wrong.  The dope.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  All right.  Have a good day.  All right.  Peace.  FCC regulations say contest depictions can't be false, misleading, or deceptive, and that  stations must conduct contests as advertised.  Stations in two other states have been fined for contests that told listeners they'd won 
[01:09:00]  cash prizes without specifying they were in Italian or Turkish lira, not U.S. dollars.  Oops.  And they faced fines for that.  I literally hate all radio guys.  That's why you don't see us at the conventions or any of that shit.  They're always looking for us to go on these things and talk in front of everybody.  They're just a bunch of uncreative asses.  They really are.  And the guy got fired because he didn't know how to do the bit right. 
[01:09:30]  The 100-gram bit.  And this woman turned around and bit him in the ass.  That'll happen.  Some of them will go, ah, you bastard.  Or what?  I was going to get a new truck.  All right.  Well, here's the original that we did back in the day from our Demented World CD, Anthony.  Yes.  Check this out.  The day we gave away 100 grand.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  107th caller.  No, don't worry.  Tell me, I won.  I won.  I don't know why.  You're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow.  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with the 100 grand?  Oh, man.  The first thing.  I have this old.  Oh, I cannot.  I got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner. 
[01:10:30]  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this.  Oh, man.  I got this box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the fuck?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man. 
[01:11:00]  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  All you guys are a bunch of toast.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Congratulations, man.  I love that.  Uh-oh.  I love that guy.  I love that guy.  Not once in there do we say that it's about money.  No.  Not once.  That's how you do the bidding.  And the whole show, we were presenting it like it wasn't money.  Right.  You know, you've got to watch what you say. 
[01:11:30]  You can't say $100,000, things like that.  You've got to say 100 grand.  Let's say hi to Pete in Rhode Island.  Pete, what's up?  Hello?  Pete?  Done.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, this is Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Hey.  Yeah, there was a bid that a radio station did on giving away a toy Yoda.  And one of the people went to give you a toy Yoda.  Oh, my God.  This is another one of these hack old bits that has been done a million fucking times. 
[01:12:00]  The toy Yoda.  Yeah, and they went to claim their prize, and they gave him a Star Wars figure.  A little Star Wars figure.  A toy Yoda.  Oh, ho, ho.  Get it?  And it's a toy Yoda.  And then somebody sued.  Yeah, some, I guess some manager at Hooters did this and told his girls there that he would  give the girl that sold the most a toy Yoda. 
[01:12:30]  And he wound up giving her a toy Yoda, a little Yoda action figure, and she sued.  Did she win?  Yeah, she won.  Yeah.  Yeah, she won.  Got some cash settlement.  By the way, our 100-gram bid is now Flash Animation.  We should make that available on openanthony.com and foundrymusic.com for everybody, because  it's very, very funny.  Yeah.  Very funny.  All right, thank you, bro.  All right, love you.  All right, let's go to Scott in Florida.  Scott, what's up?  I just wanted to let you guys know that Todd Schitt's come back in Tampa, Florida, is playing 
[01:13:00]  a bit and not even giving you credit for it.  Oh, really?  He's playing a word-for-word tape from the AAF, the exact same bit you just played.  See, that's the other problem.  You know, Anthony and I were proud of putting out a CD, and then we'd get reports from all  over the country that DJs were just playing these bits and not even saying where they came  from.  Yeah, they just played them.  It's like, boy, this is pretty funny.  And it was the same scumbag that was calling you out.  Yeah.  For many, many years, I mean, when we found something that was funny that was somebody  else's, we would just, who cares?  We'd say, yeah, we found this little thing, and blah, blah, did this, enjoy. 
[01:13:30]  But there's guys out there that'll play the tracks off this CD and may believe, I don't  know, the listeners will just assume.  They came up with it because it's on their show.  Don't give them my recognition.  Oh, whatever.  All right, there you have it.  Well, I want to give you guys credit for it.  I don't know.  Because I'm telling you, the business is filled with a bunch of douches.  I agree.  We got a deep throw copy, huh?  Ooh.  Got to pull some sound clips off of this.  Harry Reams.  Yeah, we should work on that immediately, because I want to hear the dialogue. 
[01:14:00]  It's so bad.  Yeah.  The music is awful.  All right, Anthony, the other big story in the paper today is the Spidey Rapist.  Spidey Rapist.  Sounds like fun, doesn't it, kids?  The Spidey Rapist.  The fucking New York Post.  The headline today, right on the front page, Spidey Rapist, Upper East Side Fiend Crawls  into windows.  Into windows.  A Spider-Man rapist who climbs through windows is probably in the Upper East Side.  He's committed at least two chilling attacks in as many weeks on East 89th Street near 
[01:14:30]  Gracie Mansion.  He's also suspected of rape on the Upper West Side.  Watch.  Where do you live, Opie?  Upper West Side.  Upper West Side?  Yeah.  Watch out for Spidey Rapist, right?  Spidey Rapist.  So he goes around wearing the costume.  It's Tobey Maguire, right?  He comes and knocks on your window, says, hi, ladies.  I thought I'd have sex with you.  And they go, oh, Tobey Maguire.  Come on in.  Well, it was going to be a rape, but it's Tobey, so okay. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  This should be fun.  He's wearing his costume.  You know what he likes to do, too?  He hangs off the edge of the bed so his head's upside down and then pulls his mask down  so just his lips show.  And the girl gives him a kiss upside down.  Yeah.  Yeah, he fucks him right in the ass.  Yeah, Spidey Rapist.  It's great.  It's fun.  Spidey Rapist.  We should do a fake commercial on this whole thing.  Spidey Rapist.  You know what?  It doesn't sound scary or threatening at all, does it?  It sounds exciting and fun because it's Spider-Man.  Yeah, but the web this rapist is shooting is going to reduce your life sentence. 
[01:15:30]  Your life expectancy.  It is not the same web that good old Spidey is going to shoot in your face.  Spider-Man sicko.  Why do they even try?  This isn't Tobey Maguire.  This isn't a cartoon.  This isn't a movie action hero.  The suspect is described as a 5'8", 20-year-old black man.  So what's happening is you're getting a criminal coming in your window and fucking you. 
[01:16:00]  And taking your money after you're done.  Yeah, robbing you.  After you're done.  And showering and brushing his teeth in one of the instances.  Yeah.  What?  He showered and brushed his teeth after one of the rapes.  Oh, look at that.  Spidey says hygiene is good.  That must have been some nasty snatch.  I got to clean up after this one.  When the rapist wants to shower afterwards.  Why is the New York Post making this kind of romantic?  I agree.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  The victims have had a hard time identifying the suspect because he covers their face with 
[01:16:30]  a pillow or a t-shirt lying around the bedroom.  In all cases, he entered through the window.  It is believed he enters through a rear window.  Oh, near a fire escape.  We urge anyone in the area to keep the windows closed at night.  So he's not shooting webs and climbing up the buildings this way?  I mean, he's not saving people and fighting crime and then romantically crawling through  some woman's window. 
[01:17:00]  And then, like, he's on...  Like Spidey.  Then he's on the ledge and says goodbye and does a cute little double backflip down to  the ground.  Yeah.  See you next time.  I'm the Spidey Rapist.  I'm the Spidey Rapist.  Bye.  Blows her a little kiss.  No.  Maybe you could combat the Spidey Rapist by getting a green goblin mask.  And fighting the Spidey Rapist to the death.  Don't make it sound fun and romantic and like it's out of the movies. 
[01:17:30]  The guy climbs up fire escapes and goes through people's windows and rapes them.  He's not swinging from spider webs in a costume.  Spidey Rapist.  You're not climbing up the side of a building.  He's doing what any crook does, a criminal does.  Using fire escapes and open windows.  Spidey Rapist indeed.  I don't remember Spider-Man having a big black cock. 
[01:18:00]  I missed that one.  I mean, was that in the comic book or the movie?  Where he barges in.  Let's be honest.  If you had a big black cock, you wouldn't dress in a silly costume to get girls to notice you.  Costume.  Make it very obvious, wouldn't it?  Yeah, you would...  Tight little red suit.  You wouldn't be hiding that shameful face with a mask.  You'd be proud of your manhood.  Spidey Rapist.  Spidey Rapist.  Stupid post.  Always try to romanticize it. 
[01:18:30]  That's because it's fun for everybody.  I'm glad they gave a description, though.  They rarely do that these days.  I don't understand the people that are living in New York that don't have bars on their windows at this point.  I just don't get it.  Please.  Do you have bars on your windows?  Oh, my God.  Do I have bars on your windows?  You do?  Everywhere.  Do you have bars on your windows?  Everywhere, yes.  That says a little something about the area you live in.  Dude.  Doesn't that speak volumes?  Dude, walk around anywhere in New York.  Anywhere.  Yeah.  Wherever you walk, the first three floors minimum. 
[01:19:00]  I mean, even a lot higher than that.  I know.  We all have bars on their windows.  Big metal bars.  We all have to live in our own private prison.  What happens if there's a fire?  You're fucked.  And you have to get out a window because you're...  Oh, you're fucked.  Yeah.  When it sucks even more than that, you know, nice day, you open up your windows, and you're looking out.  Bars.  Bars.  Yeah.  That's how you have to live.  See, I don't get it.  I will never live in this friggin' city.  I'm not going to downplay this.  Yes, I do live in a nice neighborhood.  Yeah.  Really nice neighborhood.  But, you know, that's how you have to be in Manhattan. 
[01:19:30]  That's where they go.  That's how you have to be.  And these guys that want to do you wrong, that's all they do is walk around looking for that one dumb idiot that doesn't have the bars on their windows.  Yep.  Or a fire escape that goes up ten stories to a window that doesn't have bars on their windows.  Slightly open.  It's a nice summer evening.  You want to open up your windows?  Forget about it.  I live in a great little suburban neighborhood, Opie.  I can't wait to move back to the suburbs.  And I can't sleep with the windows open. 
[01:20:00]  I can't sleep with the windows open.  When there are windows or the sliding glass door or something I want to open, get a nice cool breeze at night.  Nope.  Seal it up.  Lockdown.  I lock all the windows, shut them, shut the shades.  Because people have ruined it.  They've ruined things.  Even in my nice little area.  I was talking about that last week.  There was like 17 break-ins around the area I live in. 
[01:20:30]  Just people looking for open windows and stuff to barge in, tie people up, and steal their goods.  Everyone should just be armed with guns.  Anyone comes popping in, boom, you blast them right through the window.  And you watch how quickly the crime rate drops.  You watch how people all of a sudden don't feel like poking their head through an open window.  If the last five people that did it didn't have a head left.  How about that? 
[01:21:00]  Yep.  Right, Keith the Cop?  That's what I love about Texas.  Texas, they walk around with guns.  Dude, man.  I mean, when I was on the old hiatus, and I started following some of my comedian friends around a little bit,  and went on tour with Jimmy a little bit here and there, went down to Dallas,  could not believe the difference.  People just carrying all over the place.  We did a bar gig with Pugs and Kelly.  We showed up at this thing.  And the women had guns.  The guys had guns.  They all had them in their glove compartments. 
[01:21:30]  They were carrying.  I mean, it was amazing how many people had guns down in the Dallas area.  It was like a party in the Bronx.  It was just amazing.  Guns rock.  It was a little scary, because you're in the same atmosphere.  You know, you're getting drunk in a bar like you do whatever in your town.  But in Dallas, you're getting drunk.  Fight could break out at any moment, and everyone has guns.  They're armed.  It was a little different.  A little different feeling you got.  You know how many carjackings they got down there, as opposed to a place where you know  that the guy that you're carjacking isn't going to have anything, not going to be able 
[01:22:00]  to do anything to you except get his head beat in or shot.  Yeah, in Texas, then they catch you, and then they kill you anyway.  Yeah, and then if you do commit the crime, and they convict you, and it's murder.  Yeah, because Texas...  Electric chair.  Texas, just like New York, has the death penalty.  But guess what?  The difference?  They use the fucking thing.  They use it.  We haven't killed one person in New York since we got the death penalty.  Not one.  You ask one of these Spidey Rapist women if they wouldn't have liked to have had a piece  right there next to the bed and blow Spidey Rapist's cock right off his body. 
[01:22:30]  Huh?  Right in his animal mouth.  Nice Mossberg.  You just...  Boom!  Right there in a ball bag.  As Spidey Rapist is shooting his web up...  Shooting his web.  Ugh.  Wonderful.  And I'm so bummed I blew my line that I killed in the fucking office.  When did you blow your line?  It wasn't as good as it was in the office.  Oh my God.  You took that, took the meat cleaver, butchered it up, wrapped it in wax paper, and delivered  it to everybody. 
[01:23:00]  Did he?  I had a great...  It was a great line in the office.  It was Spidey Rapist.  Then I'm sitting here waiting for my moment to give the nice line for the whole country,  and I fucked it up.  Spidey Rapist, the web that he shoots will shorten your life expectancy.  But I said...  What?  Your life sentence.  Yeah.  You didn't say that, did you?  Oh, yeah.  Listen to the replay later.  I didn't even catch it.  Dude, it was my...  This was going to be my...  I will shorten your life sentence, and it's like, how is this web going to...  If you're in jail, you get out sooner because of the... 
[01:23:30]  Dude, I started heating up inside because I'm like, this was...  I only deliver one good line a day, probably.  That was my line of the day.  It killed in the office, got a big laugh, and I'm like, walking to the studio all proud,  going, wow, my one line today is really going to kill.  I'm like...  It's a good one.  It was a good one in the office.  I had a nice spring to my step.  Something happened from way over there, the office, to in here.  Right.  And then we seg into the Spidey Rapist story, and I'm starting to feel real good. 
[01:24:00]  Here it comes, boys and girls.  And I fucked it up.  Listen to the replay.  You'll hear...  You know, it'll cut down on your life sentence.  Life expectancy.  Oh, you know what?  It didn't work.  I didn't hear the flub because I just heard life expectancy.  I was reading the paper, and I heard cut down on life expectancy.  Well, then maybe all the listeners were reading something at that exact moment.  Hopefully.  Hopefully.  You never know.  I did not even notice that you flubbed it because I got a chuckle out of it.  I wish I would have noticed you flubbed it, but I was in the middle of the thing,  and I heard lower it, and I heard life expectancy.  I'm like, oh, all right. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, that makes me happy to know.  I didn't even catch it.  God damn it.  You guys have no idea.  How much I kill in the office before the show.  What happened?  Were you, like, thinking about it coming?  Did you get nervous?  I think I have to worry about too much sometimes in the show,  and it just gets all frazzled in my brain.  I don't know.  Fucking blows.  Anyway, so there's the Spidey Rapist,  and then the other big story is this Oprah Winfrey,  which I don't have a line for, but...  A little Oprah story going on.  But it's really making me puke this morning.  She went to some exclusive jewelry store, I guess it is. 
[01:25:00]  Hermes.  They make all kinds of, like, perfumes, too, don't they?  Yeah, it's one of those just exclusive rich people store.  Real she-she.  In Paris.  Yeah.  She-she.  In Paris.  She went over to Paris.  She's doing a little shopping.  Hold on.  Can I correct this guy?  Uh-huh.  Unless I'm a dope today.  Correct him, Ope.  Jed in New York, go ahead.  Yeah, I have to correct you, Ope.  They have killed people with a death penalty in New York State.  When?  How about the Rosenbergs in the 50s?  Yeah, in the 50s, my friend.  No, I'm talking...  All right, all right.  Since they brought it back when Pataki took office, you dumb shit. 
[01:25:30]  All right, I thought that was...  I thought everyone understood that.  Yeah, of course.  Everyone did.  All right.  Everyone did, but Jed.  Look, I...  Stupid Jed.  Jed stinks.  I know my state.  There was a death penalty in New York, and they did use it, and then it went away for  a very long time.  What?  20, 30 years?  30 years?  I don't even know.  Yeah, longer than that.  Well, sir, you didn't really correct...  All right, Jed.  Well, I'll give you a slight credit here.  I'm talking about since Pataki brought it back, I don't even know the year.  At least 10 years, right? 
[01:26:00]  I think so.  Yeah, 10 years.  At least 10 years, we haven't killed one person with the death penalty.  Well, Robert Johnson, who is the...  Because that's how you keep everyone happy.  The people that are against the death penalty, what you do is, well, you bring the death penalty  back, but you don't kill anyone.  So then everyone's happy.  Because the prosecutors in this state are all a bunch of these liberal yucks.  Robert Johnson refused to go...  He refused to seek it, I believe.  Yeah, absolutely.  Says it.  And he's very bold about saying, I will never seek the death penalty, no matter what the  crime.  Oh, great. 
[01:26:30]  Good job.  Thanks.  But it's amazing that...  I mean, I almost...  It's very rare to see a lawyer allow what he feels to come into play, but when you're  representing the state, shithead, you've got to do it.  That's what the state laws tell you to do.  Yeah.  So if you enjoy murdering people and really don't want to pay for it with your life, come  to New York.  It's great.  Great place to kill people.  Wonderful.  All right.  Let's go to Rich in New York.  Rich?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you, when you're delivering these lines, not to worry. 
[01:27:00]  It's a nationally syndicated show.  There are millions of people listening.  Just using your own gag on you.  Good advice, sir.  I'm going to go listen to myself on the radio now.  All right.  Thank you.  Go listen.  Let's go to Tom in Ohio.  It's time for my beating today.  Go ahead, Tom.  Go ahead.  Hey, listen.  It'll be one good joke a day.  I think you're rounding up.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You know, I got to say, I listened to yesterday's replay, and the line of the day was the cock 
[01:27:30]  on the face line.  Yeah, I like that one.  That was a good one.  Well, I didn't care for that, being the victim of it.  I thought it was very funny.  I thought it was hurtful and in a mean spirit.  I thought it was very funny, very quick.  And I delivered that on the spot.  On the spot?  I didn't even pre-think that one.  That's the problem.  Very quick.  When I have a line coming into the studio, it always gets botched.  Oh.  I get all excited.  Ralph fucking Cramden.  Right.  Mr. Faber-sham.  All right, you delivered the line.  Could you come in and do that again, Mr. Cramden?  Yeah.  Mr. Faber-sham. 
[01:28:00]  Out of the question.  Out of the question.  All right.  This is your life sentence.  I didn't even hear it.  God damn it.  This is your life sentence if you're in jail.  What?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Getting raped and a guy comes on you, you'll get out sooner.  Yeah.  I'll explain that at some point.  Oh, great.  There's an armless kid.  That kid could be dangerous, but to me, she looks armless.  Get over here.  Get over here.  Some of the prime ABC stations we have.  And Amy right there. 
[01:28:30]  Very nice.  Good to see you guys.  Let's check your way.  No, it's not good to see you guys.  You're horrified.  There is a little girl with no arms.  And what's even worse is she has buck teeth.  That annoys me more than her no arms.  I guess dental hygiene is hard when you can't hold a toothbrush.  Oh, jeez.  A little armless bad girl.  Well, parents are hoping people don't notice that she has no arms because they're looking  at the buck teeth.  Now they position the camera where she's not showing anymore because it just creeped everybody  out.  You just creeped out a nation.  Her stupid arms were hanging over like Ziggy's nose in the cartoon, hanging over that little 
[01:29:00]  fence thing.  Hey, can Derek get my flub line now that we're talking about it?  Is that tough to do?  Oh.  Derek, go grab it, please.  Pull that up, Derek.  Might as well, right?  So Oprah went into this place or tried to get into this place and they would not admit  her?  Yeah.  They wouldn't let her in.  It's an exclusive jewelry store, right?  In Paris?  Yeah.  They sell all kinds of rich people stuff.  She was in Paris, yeah.  She was with one of her friends, an associate, and then tries to go into the store. 
[01:29:30]  So they stop her at the door and say, no, you can't come in.  The news picked up on this and their explanation was that the store was holding some kind of  private party and that's why they didn't let her in.  So her people were lying as to why they didn't let her in.  The woman that was with Oprah finally comes forward and says, the truth of what happened  was, and I guess her and Oprah talked and Oprah was like, you know, I should kind of go  public with this.  She got to the door and the person at the door said, we've been having problems here 
[01:30:00]  with Africans.  North Africans.  With North Africans.  And did not let her in and told her to go away.  And she said it was the most humiliating thing she's ever felt.  And she's going to dedicate an entire show to it.  And she's really pissed off.  Now, my take on this whole thing is, instead of now making this huge to-do, you can make  a huge to-do, if I may say to-do, about the whole thing.  But I hope she comes back and after saying what happened and how degraded and awful she 
[01:30:30]  felt, then turns around and says, no matter how bad people try to make it sound here in  the United States, that the stuff that's commonplace, I'm sure that is commonplace in  anti-Semitic, racist France, that when you come here to America, things like this aren't  tolerated when they do happen, changes are made, and that she can go wherever the hell  she damn well pleases in this country.  And then she can point out that this stuff happens in France as well as here because everywhere 
[01:31:00]  in the world we just behave badly.  Very good.  But you know what's weird?  It's like they had no idea that they were, because they're scumbags, some upper echelon  store, doesn't want to admit her, and they fucked with the most powerful celebrity in  the United States.  Right.  And that's Oprah.  I mean, I like the fact that she's doing a show on it because she is going to fucking  wreck them.  I love that it's France.  Ugh.  I love that it's the French who are just despicable people, always trying to stand in our way 
[01:31:30]  no matter what we do.  And I'm not just talking about the war.  I'm talking about everything we try to do as a country in this world.  They have stood in the way.  And of course, you know, needless to say, bailing them out in the big one again, the world had  to come to their aid and give their life and blood for a people that just stood aside and  did nothing while another country just took over your country.  And they today are just a rash, a global rash, just annoying the piss out of people, standing 
[01:32:00]  in the way of progress, and being very racist and anti-Semitic.  They hate Jews there.  Oh, they're the worst.  And it's so open.  It's so out in the open and public.  What group is it that has a radio station in France?  Somebody, it was, I want to say it's Hezbollah.  XM.  Yes, XM.  Elo and his anti-Semitic rants.  The damn Jews hate my retard haircut.  Sorry, Eric, I didn't mean that.  It's a lovely haircut. 
[01:32:30]  I meant Iraq.  Like, oh, they're just, they are awful.  And imagine, you imagine as a store, having her blast you for an hour on that show, that's  just awful.  Oh, yeah, great advertising.  Yeah.  But you know the angle she's going to take.  She wants the average black woman in America to believe that, you know, she can relate to  you.  Yeah.  She can relate to the average black woman in America and what she faces on a daily basis.  Sorry, Oprah.  Because Oprah wasn't allowed in this exclusive jewelry store in Paris.  Like, every black woman takes their private jet to Paris. 
[01:33:00]  When I take my Learjet over to Paris, I can't get in no store.  When I try to get my herded.  Yeah.  Boy, they really screwed with the wrong person, though.  As she goes back to her five-star hotel and drinks the most expensive tea to get through  what happened to her.  Pries a little.  I was kept out of a store because of the color of my skin.  I'm Oprah Winfrey, and I'm still being kept out of places because of the color of my skin. 
[01:33:30]  She's got to, look, dude, she's royalty of this country.  And just whatever employee, how do you not know who she, I know she's not famous everywhere,  but how do you, she's the biggest celebrity we have, or the most powerful one, at least.  How do you fuck with her?  What a bad move.  Don't you picture that stuffy French guy with the little pencil mustache that used to be  on, like, I love Lucy?  You cannot come in here.  No.  We do not allow the Africans.  Not knowing it's Oprah.  They'll issue an apology. 
[01:34:00]  They'll offer her a shopping spree.  Yeah, go ahead.  She'll turn them down.  She doesn't need that money.  And it's funny.  She probably had more money than everybody in that store shopping combined.  Combined.  She should really get it.  Absolutely did.  Combined.  Absolutely did.  You dummies.  She should really get the store back and take those animals that are in that audience  and fly them to Paris for a shopping spree.  Everyone's going on a shopping spree.  To Air Me's, whatever it's called.  Just like a homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  That's Ziggy.  All right, I'll accept your apology if you allow me to bring my studio audience to Paris 
[01:34:30]  for a shopping spree.  Where the perfume section?  I want the perfume section.  And Oprah said we can shop here today.  I want some Armani soup.  Where that...  Who are you?  Why are you looking at me, boy?  Where's the ice?  Yeah.  I want some bling bling.  And Oprah's paying for it.  It's all on the Oprah's tab. 
[01:35:00]  Let me tell you, you're not keeping me out of here because I'm a black man.  I buy whatever I want to buy, Frenchy, you frog-ass frog.  I want some...  I'm interested in a cent.  I want to purchase a cent.  What kind of cent?  Anything but urine and shit because I'm wearing that already.  And send a bill to my buddy Oprah.  They have to allow them to...  What's that dance thing called? 
[01:35:30]  Crunk?  Allow them to crunk in the middle of the store.  I want some crunk on your floor.  Is it crunk?  What's that called?  Oh, my goodness.  They are crunking.  They are crunking.  Oh, that would be fantastic.  Just bring the whole audience there.  Fill it up with homeless guys.  Learjet waiting outside the studio.  Yeah.  You're coming with me.  I'm in first class with the Oprah.  Give me some more of that champagne.  Get them all hammered before they go there. 
[01:36:00]  Open the door, Francie.  Here we come.  That's funny.  That's really funny.  Goddamn.  That would be nice.  That ain't going to happen.  Are there any Hermes stores in this country?  There are, right?  Are there?  I've seen Hermes products in hotels and stuff.  Backlash.  The big backlash then.  That's how I knew what it was.  I think I got some from one of the hotels in Vegas.  It said green Hermes lotion, which I thought was very good, actually.  Really?  Yeah, years ago.  Good for your skin?  I might even have...  I think so. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, probably.  Better than the Lush products?  Oh, no.  I used cupcake last night, as a matter of fact.  You used cupcake.  Without shame.  You know, I don't know.  There's a little shame.  Maybe.  I don't know if this is true, but I've heard stories like this before.  Let's go to Matt.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, Matt.  Or, I'm Matt.  Hi, Matt.  Hey, guys.  That was my flub.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but people are going to forget about my flub.  You forgot your own goddamn name.  You're so nervous.  I'm intimidated, because Jimmy's on the show, and I fucking love the guy. 
[01:37:00]  Jimmy, you rule.  Oh, thank you, sir.  No problem.  Back in 96, 97, I was on a flight going from San Francisco to Chicago.  And I was sitting in first class row.  I was sitting in seat 1A.  And Oprah Winfrey comes on with her help, and Oprah's in 1D, so she's in the same row  as me, opposite corner.  And she pulls her coat up and pulls a blanket up and just, like, buries her face in the corner  of the plane.  And about halfway through the flight, one of the stewardesses comes up and goes, hey,  can I get a picture from Oprah, or an autograph from Oprah? 
[01:37:30]  And her assistant, who's this white chick sitting in 1C, turns around and real condescendingly  goes, Oprah doesn't speak to the help, thank you.  So I'm not buying this bullshit.  She got exactly what she deserved, and what she's done probably to thousands of people in  the past.  So, you know, screw you, Oprah.  I love these urban legends of celebrities that do things like that.  You can't take anyone's word for that.  That's ridiculous.  I mean, I don't know.  I've heard things about Oprah being snotty, but I've also heard she's really nice.  I know I've met people that have met her, and they say, oh, maybe she's phonier, 
[01:38:00]  and maybe she's not, but I can't picture her allowing that to be said in her...  Yeah, she doesn't seem like the type of person that would be that nasty.  I mean, that obvious about it.  Yeah.  All right.  Because I don't talk to the help either, but I would at least have somebody say it nicely.  Opie, you talk to your Polish maid?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I like her.  She's cool.  You talk to her?  She's speaky?  Yeah, I want to make sure she doesn't steal anything.  She's speaky English?  Like the $100,000 diamond earrings?  No, we got this thing going on.  She speaks broken English, and all she can say is rock and roll. 
[01:38:30]  She wants me to play rock and roll off the TV for her while she cleans.  My ex-brother-in-law, Johnny Race, is your maid for rock and roll.  Nathan in South Carolina.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey.  Good.  Good start.  I'm in a band, and we toured France last September.  Yeah.  And I want to tell you, those people are the most racist people in the world, because,  you know, they opened up that European Union over there, so now, like, all these different 
[01:39:00]  nationalities are flooding into France, like, all the Arabic people and the North Africans,  and so now, I mean, we felt bad we would be in a restaurant, and they would wait on us  before they would wait on any other people, you know?  Yeah, this is all new to them.  Exactly.  They've still got to go through all the stuff that we went through years and years ago.  Right, and they would wait on us, because we're white.  We didn't know the language, and people are looking at us like, you know, who the fuck 
[01:39:30]  are these giggling Americans, you know?  They have a weird relationship with us, the French.  There's, like, a really weird national jealousy, and they'll deny it.  I mean, they have a nice culture.  They have a lot of good things in France.  I can't be dishonest if they don't.  But just this resentment at the power the United States has, man, and it really, that's  how the whole European Union is.  Absolutely.  They were sitting there for years and years and years, and, you know, we come over here,  built a country.  And they helped us.  It's so powerful.  Of course they did.  They helped us.  Absolutely. 
[01:40:00]  And we helped them.  Oh, we paid them back in spades.  Yeah, stop.  Well, that's what they're all annoyed about.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, boys?  I heard the reason they won't let her in is because they didn't remove the fire extinguishers  from the store yet.  Oh, my God.  The French are just afraid it'll create some kind of a mulatto mongrel class of shopper.  We're going to have a conglomerated ballada mongrel class. 
[01:40:30]  And ask them if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the  building part of integration, throughout of which will come a conglomerated ballada mongrel  class of people.  All graces will be destroyed in such a booth.  I, for one, unto God, will die before I yield one aid. 
[01:41:00]  And that time is a moment.  Wow.  That was one of the cashiers over at the store.  Boy, that word mongrel, he really...  Mongrel!  Because he's an older gentleman in this little clan outfit, and boy, he's getting heated.  He's so upset.  Conglomerated.  Keep moving.  Mongrel!  Mongrel!  Let's say hi to Kevin.  He won't yield an inch!  No! 
[01:41:30]  He'd die first.  He says it under God.  Yeah.  Won't die.  Well, he'll die before he yields an inch.  Right.  That man has conviction.  All right.  Hey, Kevin.  Go ahead.  Fast.  Yeah.  I was watching 2020 a couple weeks ago.  They did a similar story about it happening in New York.  Yeah.  And they sent two guys there, and...  Oh, right.  Cameraman.  Yeah.  And the guy got right in, and they were making up excuses like they were busy and everything  when the first guy came and didn't let him in.  Yeah, we saw that.  Well, you know something?  When that jewelry store... 
[01:42:00]  Because it was a jewelry store guy.  When he's been robbed a few times, and the same type of person has been robbing him,  he's going to be a little more cautious about letting them in, I think.  It's human nature.  The guy's scared shitless for his life.  But someone like Oprah, I mean, she's a woman.  I mean, they knew she wasn't coming, and they probably thought she was just going to cause  a problem or not spend money.  They knew she wasn't there to rob the place.  You can look at her.  What is she going to do?  A little shoplifting.  That's probably what they're worried about.  But not a violent crime.  Some dumb Frenchman following her around in the aisles looking. 
[01:42:30]  Can I help you?  Wait, meanwhile, she could buy the store.  Dude, buy and sell it.  And they're looking at her, waiting to see if she's going to shoplift a scarf.  She's a billionaire, you French assholes.  A billionaire.  Yeah.  You kicked a billionaire.  Wouldn't let a billionaire in your store.  With a huge television show that is seen around the world.  Arguably...  To pummel your company.  The biggest in our country.  That is a faux pas.  And she is going to smash you for an hour in prime time. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  That's going to get ugly.  Those fuckers are going to backpedal and they really are going to do it.  They're going to donate money to black causes.  She is going to strangle them.  Yeah.  And I'm sure it's not a company policy.  So eventually, they'll make up.  Oh, she's going to choke them.  Yeah, I bet that guy loses his job, whoever that was at the door.  Dude.  Yeah.  You got to side with her on this.  That's just an awful thing.  Fucking not letting her in like that.  Come on.  Stupid.  All right.  Let's go to Travis.  Travis in Oklahoma.  Travis.  Hey, Ben's hog is so big that France surrendered to it. 
[01:43:30]  There you go.  Ah.  Ben's hog.  Big swastik on the head.  They're still coming in.  Blitzkrieg in his way.  Before we move on, I have to do this.  I've got a special request and I've never done this on the show and I probably won't  ever again.  But the guy who does my merchandise, Paul Field, it's his birthday.  I think he's 34, so I want to congratulate Paul and wish him a happy birthday.  You're a fucking kook and a sociopath who talks too loud, but you're a good guy. 
[01:44:00]  So happy birthday, buddy.  He's a big fan of the show.  Oh, you know him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's a nut.  Then a hardcore racist.  Oh, he's the worst.  Then he's loud.  He's a loud racist.  Black people!  Jesus Christ.  He's a loud racist.  Nothing more uncomfortable to be around than a loud racist.  Oh, with a big gut.  He's a mess.  Paul's a fucking mess.  But it's his birthday and happy birthday, man.  Oh, it was my mother's birthday yesterday and I didn't call.  That's all right.  I had a bad thing to do. 
[01:44:30]  That's his son.  Happy birthday, mommy.  I'm awful.  I care more about my racist merchandise psychopath than you care about your mom.  That's probably going to be a good one.  I know.  Guys, before we take a break, we've got two more tribute bands to get to today.  Really?  Now that we're going down this road.  Yeah, eventually we're going to have some kind of, I don't know, maybe a concert, maybe  a competition.  We're going to do something with this.  Are they any good?  Maybe we'll get the three best tribute bands together and just throw ourselves a little  party.  Because we've got to get out there again.  We've got to start doing stuff. 
[01:45:00]  Not a broadcasting party.  No, no, no.  Of course not.  We just show up at some place, hang out, have a good time.  No broadcasting.  So we've been going through the tribute band tapes and either saying yes or no.  So far we've got a few in the yes box and a lot of no's in the other box there.  Earl suggested a tribute band, Anthony.  They're called the Easy Star All-Stars.  What do they do?  They're a white reggae band that does Pink Floyd. 
[01:45:30]  Oh boy.  It's a gimmick.  And they did the dub Side of the Moon.  They did the entire Dark Side of the Moon album as a white reggae band.  All right.  Earl recommends this.  What song do you want to hear from Dark Side of the Moon done by this band?  Got the great gig in the sky with the nice moaning.  You got time.  One of the biggies.  Well, money, obviously, or us and them, I guess, huh?  Comfortably numb?  That's not off that album, you silly goose. 
[01:46:00]  I don't know.  I get scared.  I heard Earl was going to be here, but the doorman was keeping him out.  I guess I made a mistake.  I'm comfortably dumb.  Oh, Liddy.  I fucking hate you.  All right.  He sucks so bad.  Never funny.  All right.  Why don't we play money, I guess?  Money's a good one.  All right.  I hope they get the tashin right.  What's that?  Oh, fun. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, I get it.  It's a lot of fun.  Because it's reggae.  Rock off.  I don't consider this a tribute band, by the way.  Good point.  Oh, we like the gimmicky ones, though, too. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I mean, they're fun.  The Iron Maidens.  That was some funny talk the other day.  These guys are...  What's that?  Money.  Money.  Money.  Get it away.  Get a good job.  But more pain in your own game.  Money.  It's a guest.  Grab that cash with both hands and make you stand. 
[01:47:30]  Wow, I can't imagine sitting through an entire set.  I like it.  It's not bad.  It's just not a tribute, but you're right.  Coverbend.  It's a gimmick.  It's a gimmick, like smashing a watermelon with a big hammer. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Good example.  Thanks to Earl for that one.  You go there for the gimmick, and then once you realize you're there and stuff, you realize how much it sucks.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Texas.  Andrew?  Hey, I wanted to defend the French a little bit.  All right, Andy.  You know, their jealousy of America is justified because their great philosophers came up with the concepts for our state, 
[01:48:30]  freedom and personal rights and everything else.  And we succeeded with it where, you know, they became a giant parking lot for Berlin, essentially.  Yeah.  So that's you sticking up for France.  Yeah, man.  Their jealousy is justified.  I just don't – I resent the fact that after the Soviet Union fell, they tried to form the European Union because now the United States was evil when we had kind of been pseudo-protecting them all those years.  No, the European Union started off actually as a treaty between the coal and steel-producing states. 
[01:49:00]  It just had an economic purpose from the very beginning.  No, I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that eventually it became to counterbalance the power of the United States.  Yeah, but the constituents of the European Union can't actually form a consensus on anything.  No, I know.  Germany and Spain backed us in, you know, the very unpopular war against Iraq.  Germany didn't back us?  They – I'm pretty sure they sent – 
[01:49:30]  Germany?  No.  Germany and France were completely against us, man.  Spain backed us.  They were asshole buddies.  Yeah.  Spain and the Czech Republic then.  Okay, yeah, that's a big difference, dude.  You're right, you're right.  Hey –  Hey, Andrew.  Yes?  When did you know you were gay?  How old?  Well, I'm not gay.  Stop it.  Come on.  How old?  Was it like puberty or one of those guys where you knew it like four or five? 
[01:50:00]  Well, you know, I think I'm just more confused.  Like a Jimmy about the Pink Floyd albums.  Andrew?  Yeah?  Come on.  How old are you, Andrew?  I'm 27.  27, and you haven't accepted it yet?  Well –  You got a girlfriend?  I do.  What's his name?  That's a good one, Anthony.  More importantly, what do you picture while you're having sex with her?  Oh, combing that a long hair back so it's not in the way. 
[01:50:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Wrapping her boobs up with some bandages.  Yeah, making her look more masculine.  Very funny, Andrew.  All right, Andrew.  All right, man.  Bye, Steve.  Well, one last thing.  The French state and the French myth of identity actually begins with a racial war between the native Celts and the native Gauls and the invading Romans. 
[01:51:00]  Where do you learn this stuff?  In school?  Yes.  You must be a funny guy at parties.  Really?  Hey.  I like you guys.  All right.  We like you.  That's a lot about world history.  Nothing wrong with that.  I fell asleep and...  I learned all of it from my Age of Empires game.  That's good.  When are you guys going to announce the winners for, like, the jingle contest?  Well, it was...  Was that a contest or just send it in?  Well, it...  We have contests with no prizes, sir. 
[01:51:30]  That's what we do.  We have people send things in.  We really don't understand why people even listen to us.  We do nothing that other radio shows do.  We're giving away 75 grand.  Relax, guys.  I got a gag here.  You guys are great.  Jimmy is amazing because he...  Thank you.  He's on a radio show and he doesn't even know Pink Floyd.  No, no.  I do know them, sir.  But I'm just...  I'm not like a manic fan where I know every album.  Well, I...  You know, I...  Man, I don't know, though.  Comfortably numb.  Everyone knows he wasn't off Dark Side of the Moon, though.  Why didn't he say Dark Side of the Moon? 
[01:52:00]  Oh, okay.  I honestly didn't hear him say that.  Right.  It's Dark Side of the Moon.  I mean, you got to give it to him.  I would honestly...  One of the greatest albums of all time.  I wouldn't...  I wouldn't know...  A Bark at the Moon was better.  I wouldn't actually know that...  No, we're...  I'm not even...  I wouldn't know that...  You're not even going to get a...  To be honest, I'm not a hardcore enough Pink Floyd fan to know what album.  I just have their greatest...  That's part of, like, the FCC license for, like, a shock jock, man.  You know?  Shock jock.  Shock jock.  Shock jock.  No, we don't play music, though.  I like Pink Floyd.  I just...  I'm not as familiar with them.  All right, Andrew.  We're going to let you be. 
[01:52:30]  Goodbye.  They're telling us you got to get out of here.  All right.  Thank you, Andrew.  They're telling us.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I would always wonder, how does he know this?  Sneaky Pete.  Shut up.  I might have to do that today.  He sounded a little effeminate.  Cliff, what's up?  Boy, it's a little effeminate.  Cliff?  Hello, boys.  Make it fast, Cliff.  We're on a roll today.  Okay, I'll make it fast.  Wow is alive and well in St. Louis, Missouri.  Ooh.  Wow alive and well.  We love hearing that. 
[01:53:00]  Wow is alive and well.  Whip them out Wednesday or whip them out whenever.  You get that wow sticker on your truck or your car.  There are girls out there that will see that and flash you.  I have been a faithful listener since day one from XM, and I've written it on the back  of my truck every day, and last night it happened, and oh my God, it happened in a big way.  Four of the most hot chicks I've ever seen in my life in a Jeep.  Really?  Yeah.  Four.  If they're listening, the guy in the Kenworth pulling the, well, I ain't going to say the 
[01:53:30]  company name, but thank you for showing me those beautiful things.  I doubt four chicks in a Jeep, like there's a lot of four chicks in a Jeep group showing  tits to truckers, so they'll know who you mean when you say that.  Good eggs.  Well, the young girls love doing this for us.  That's great.  By the way, hi, Daddy.  Hi, Big Dick Daddy.  All right.  It's so fucking disturbing.  Oh, Daddy.  All right, we have another tribute band to get to here. 
[01:54:00]  Cool.  Steve, where are the girls?  They're here.  All right, good.  This guy says Empire Earth 2 is better than Age of Empires.  Age of Empires is a little dated, but Age of Empires 2 is coming out very soon, people.  And I enjoy Age of Empires more than Empire Earth.  Thank you.  Okay.  Give my little video game rebuttal there to Rob from Cleveland.  We're encouraging the cover bands to send in their stuff.  The info is up on opianthed.com.  And the 100 Grand animation, Flash animation is now up online again, too.  All right.  This band is called Never Never. 
[01:54:30]  Is that true?  Oh, yeah.  The Led Zeppelin tribute?  Yes.  Never Never.  And they do how many more times?  Any good?  I don't know.  Yeah, pretty good from what I heard before.  Really?  Yeah.  We might have another yes.  Is it yes or Zeppelin?  Zeppelin.  Who?  See, I was doing a little, you know.  Get it?  Yeah, I bet.  But then I added who and...  Oh, who?  I got it.  Yeah, it keeps the dead going a little longer.  I got you.  Is it yes or Zeppelin?  Vanilla fudge.  Vanilla fudge. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, Rosie!  I almost sound like Ozzy.  Oh, girl!  Oh, Rosie!  Oh, girl!  That's pretty good. 
[01:55:30]  That's pretty good.  There's a better of a man than he wants to come and play.  Why would you stay with me, baby?  Steal away.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Got a more popular song? 
[01:56:00]  Or just a...  That's it?  Well, it was just one mp3.  I asked him for a CD, though.  They're good.  We're going to want to hear more from this band.  Okay.  He does a very impressive Robert Plant.  They ain't no use to die.  They ain't no use to run.  Because I've got you in the size of my car. 
[01:56:30]  The band is good, too, man.  The drums are phenomenal.  That's pretty good stuff.  But I want to hear a more popular Zeppelin tune.  That's right.  Yeah, let's get some more from these guys.  Okay.  Maybe the Immigrant Song.  There you go.  Hint, hint.  Bob Kelly version. 
[01:57:00]  Fucking creepy.  It is creepy.  Now you look at him differently.  It backfired on the kid.  It certainly did.  Backfired.  Let's say hi to Lisa in New York.  Lisa, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hi.  We love our female listeners.  Listener.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, Lisa?  You stink, and I like you.  Thank you, Lisa.  Oh.  I'm a good one.  I just wanted to tell you guys, I was an exchange student in France for a year,  and I saw these two black people in class, and they seemed like nobody was talking to them 
[01:57:30]  and nobody liked them, so I went over and started talking to them, and I was basically  taken aside by all the other people in class and told that if I spoke with these people  again, that I was going to be basically ostracized from all activities involved in the class.  Welcome to France.  I'm telling you.  Isn't that something?  Wonderful country over there.  I know.  They're such nice people.  It's a lovely fucking war. 
[01:58:00]  You guys are great, and I've been listening to you.  My husband actually...  Wendy in Washington.  Opie!  Opie!  Thank you very much for that phone call.  That was Opie.  Lisa, thank you so much.  Something must have fallen on the hang-up thing.  I think I can speak for Anthony and myself when I say we were enjoying your boring testimony  a lot.  Wendy, go ahead.  I like an occasional ass-lapping.  Come on.  Go ahead, Wendy.  Hi, guys.  Hi, little cupcake. 
[01:58:30]  Wendy.  Another girl.  I know.  Two in a row.  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you that I have heard the most blatant rip-off of you guys up in  my hometown.  And when did you hear this blatant rip-off of us?  Last week, they have an F.U. line, and they rip off your movie quotes.  Really?  Well, the movie quotes, you know, whatever.  But the F.U. line is another one of our things that has...  That's something that has exploded all over the country, too. 
[01:59:00]  What's the name of the show that's doing it?  The Breakfast Boys.  Another breakfast morning show.  The Breakfast Boys?  Yes.  I'll bet what they have for breakfast comes out of a helmet-shaped object.  Faggots.  What an awful name for a radio show.  Oh, the Breakfast Boys?  Isn't that just awful?  Hi, we're the Breakfast Boys.  Put that in my shitter.  It's a more masculine name for a radio show.  That's terrible.  That's taken.  Wow.  What are their names, Wendy? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Omelette Boy and something else.  Omelette Boy?  If you tell me the other one has a breakfast name, I'll throw up on the console.  Sausage.  I can't remember what it is.  What station is it?  It's breakfast related.  96.9.  96.9?  Okay.  In Washington State?  And I bet they got a chick on every morning to just wreck the festivities.  Oh, she called in.  It's the fucking eBay lady.  She's so annoying.  Up here's syrup, girl. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, now, guys.  Let's keep it all under control, because things are starting to get funny.  Let me wreck this like the comedy cancer that I am.  And now, waffle with the news.  What?  Let me see that.  Oh, he's got the website up.  Oh, boy.  Home of the Breakfast Boys.  E-Rock?  The Breakfast Boys.  One guy has his finger up to his mouth like, shh.  Yeah.  It's very nasty.  Because don't tell anyone.  I like when he fucks me.  I have to tell you, though.  You like where I live.  There's only like 100 black people in the whole town. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  Yeah, you don't sound very diverse.  All right.  Well, so how long have you been in Utopia?  Three wonderful years.  So, wait.  Now, what are their names, Eric?  Because Eric's got the website up.  Hawk?  Dave and Ken.  All right.  Well, what about...  But everybody calls him Omelette Boy, and I don't know why.  Because I always listen to you guys.  Dave and Ken, 6 to 10.  I get it.  Oh.  Dave and Ken, 6 to 10.  That's awful.  If you're doing a morning radio show and your publicity shot shows you in slacks, nothing 
[02:01:00]  good.  Slacks.  Nothing good is happening there.  Smart slacks.  And the same shirt.  Yeah.  Wrinkle-free pants.  Yuck.  The breakfast boys.  Yeah, that sounds really bad.  Yeah.  Check out Dave and Ken's balloon adventure.  Wow, that's got to be a lot of fun.  They broadcast from a hot air balloon.  Oh, here's a bit they do called Seven Secret Questions for 2005. 
[02:01:30]  Weird baby names, everyone.  That sounds good.  What?  Yeah.  The pets definitely need to call them, because they're so damn annoying.  Oh, that's two different bits.  Sorry.  Seven Secret Questions for 2005, and then weird baby names.  Don't you have a Klan meeting to be to, Wendy?  Do they have an FU line there?  Is it up there?  Do they have a link for that?  I don't know.  This site is so gay with stars and...  There's all kinds of stars, and a lot of lavender and periwinkle, I think that is.  Is that periwinkle?  Guys, look. 
[02:02:00]  The breakfast morning show, I think, is probably...  Guys, here we go.  Well, the top 20 weird baby names.  All right.  I hope Smothered is one of them.  The 20 is Romeo.  I guess celebrities with their weird baby names.  Romeo.  Of course, that's the Spice Girl and that soccer player.  Oh, the soccer player.  David Beckman with their great body.  Courtney Cox and David Arquette in 19th place.  They named their kid Coco.  Aw.  Then you got Phoenix Chai by Mel C and Jimmy Gulzer. 
[02:02:30]  Roland.  Zoe.  Eugenie.  Yuck.  Roland.  Dweezil.  Tiger Lily.  JonBenet.  No, that's not in there.  And it goes on and on, and it's stupid.  Wow.  That's up on their website.  That's so good.  They did it on the air, and it was so good that they had to put it on the website also.  Yeah, and then the seven secret questions for 2005.  Secret.  I have a penis.  Where on my partner did I hide it? 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Here are the seven questions that could change your life.  All right.  This year, instead of making resolutions, take a moment to reflect on your life.  Here's the seven questions you should be asking.  Asking yourself, as per the breakfast boys.  I think I know one, but go ahead.  The first question is, is there anything unfinished in my life that I'm willing to walk away from?  Hmm.  Holy crap.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Nice. 
[02:03:30]  Starbucks.  It reminds me I want coffee.  She even sits down sexy.  Very nice.  All right.  Another question, Anthony.  Am I inhibited by fear or failing?  Inhibited by fear or failing?  If I were able to take my 10-year-old self out to lunch, what would he, she think of me?  My 10-year-old self?  Like you take yourself at 10.  Oh.  I grow up into quite a pervert.  Why is he touching me on my clam-like handbag? 
[02:04:00]  Why are we eating lunch in the back of a van parked on a side street?  I should kill myself now so I can't blow me later.  Question number eight.  If a man is wearing a robe, should you allow him to put his penis in you unprotected?  No.  Well, there you go.  Seven questions that could change your life.  Oh, this radio show has got to be a hoot.  According to the breakfast boys.  Who's the hole?  Is there a hole on this show?  There's got to be one.  Who's the hole?  She already said, the eBay girl. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, the eBay girl.  Here's another question.  What's keeping me from saying this is my real life right now?  What?  If that's somebody who isn't very happy with their life, I guess, they would look and go,  what's keeping me?  I'll tell you what's keeping one of them from saying it.  The fact that there's a cock in their mouth.  It's kind of hard to talk.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Breakfast-eating fags.  What?  More questions.  Oh, all right.  These are great.  Activated.  If I could take a six-month sabbatical from my current job, what would I do? 
[02:05:00]  Ugh.  What do I like most about my appearance and what are my secret vanities?  Yeah.  Oh.  What kind of gay?  These are two guys.  These are awful.  Uh-huh.  Awful.  Wow.  Awful.  Are they on right now?  Can you tune them in?  No, hon.  I'm in Texas.  No.  It's in, where is it?  It's in Spokane.  In Spokane.  Spokane.  Yeah.  Don't we say Spokane in New York, or do we say Spokane?  We don't acknowledge it. 
[02:05:30]  It's too small.  All right.  Here we go.  What can I do about the people I've disappointed and been disappointed by in my life?  Hmm.  And do I see success as a lavish banquet or a scarce commodity?  This website belongs.  Wow.  When a good friend triumphs, do I feel depleted, as if there's a limited amount of goodness  to go around?  I hope these guys are killed in a Cessna crash.  Oh, me too. 
[02:06:00]  Oh.  Where's the FU line?  It doesn't make sense to do the FU line.  It doesn't seem like the type of show.  I know.  It doesn't seem like that type of show.  And then they have this, check out the 99-year-old at Hooters.  Great.  I'll have to get the math.  Oh, we got Michael Jackson's morning routine.  This has got to be really good.  All right.  Let's give him a little...  All right.  Michael Jackson's daily morning routine.  Oh, it's...  It's a little Photoshop thing of him trying on different noses.  It's like Mr. Potato Head.  Oh, that's funny.  That's cute.  What a hoot.  We got stuff like that on Foundry. 
[02:06:30]  They should have never...  Except it shows big snatches.  Oh, and then they have a...  Foundry.  And then they have a section of...  Fucking Foundry.  What a pervert sight that is.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Oh, my God.  The filth.  The filth that man is pawning off as entertainment.  This fucking...  This boy's life hairdo.  What a scumbag.  I hear you do quite the impression of me.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Oh, guys. 
[02:07:00]  Here we go.  What is that?  Break out your calculators.  It's time for the magic calculator.  Oh.  I did this when I was seven.  And you do the little...  Use this formula to shock, stun, and amaze your friends.  And you turn it upside down and it spells...  My on-air partner has his dick in my ass.  No, it does T-cell subtraction.  Do we have a calculator so we can see what this shit is?  Use this formula.  Shock, stun, and amaze your friends.  And secretly get their phone number. 
[02:07:30]  Just grab a calculator and follow the steps below.  Are we all ready?  Okay.  Yeah.  Are we ready?  Do we have a calculator?  No.  God damn it.  I have one on my computer, don't I?  Good boy, Ant.  Let me look.  Accessories.  Hold on.  Start menu.  Programs.  All programs.  Someone has the eighth question, by the way.  Accessory.  All right.  You get there.  Let me go to Paul in Florida.  I got it.  Paul, go ahead.  Fast.  Hey, guys.  I've got the eighth question that'll change your life.  All right.  Okay.  Do you want me to wear the bag or not? 
[02:08:00]  Wendy's a little too excited by everything.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Calm down.  You don't have to laugh at everything.  There we go.  All right, Anthony, input the first three digits of your phone number.  Do I have to?  Oh, forget this shit.  We've got a girl that's showing her boobs.  She's pulling her huge tits out.  All right.  End of bit.  They are massive.  Fuck the magic calculator.  Fuck the breakfast boys.  Home of the breakfast boys.  Wow.  She's licking the glass.  Very nice.  Wow.  This girl's a go-getter.  Who is this, Steve?  Um. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, thank you.  That's Friday.  Wow.  That's Friday?  What a coincidence.  It's Friday today.  Wow.  Look at that tit against that glass.  Uh, girls, courtesy of danni.com.  D-A-N-N-I dot com.  That looks great.  They will use a strap-on, I'm being told.  Looks like Uncle Fester with a melanoma.  Oh, she's spitting.  God, that's hot.  Dude, I'm getting a...  That's really sexy.  You like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's spitting on her glass and...  She's spitting on her glass and she...  And now she's...  God, that's fucking disgusting.  I love it.  I'd like her to spit in my mouth. 
[02:09:00]  She is a fantastic girl.  You want her to spit in your mouth right now?  She spit all over the glass and she's rubbing it around.  Eric, see if Friday will come in really fast before the break and just spit in Jimmy's mouth.  Holy shit.  You're kidding me, right?  Oh, yeah.  I want to see this.  Stop it.  Come on.  Bring her in.  I want her to spit in Jimmy's mouth.  She'll do this.  This is Friday, everybody.  You're kidding, right, Jimmy?  Friday, come here and say hi, first of all.  I was here.  He goes, yeah.  Good morning.  Friday, you're beautiful.  How big are those?  Big.  No, I know, but we're on the radio.  Oh, 38 double Ds.  38 double Ds. 
[02:09:30]  She's built.  She's very nice.  41 when the nipples are hard.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, interesting.  See, it makes the tape measure go out.  You're a good girl.  We like the whole spinning thing you were just doing.  And Jimmy's getting a rod.  A little bit.  Very sexy.  And he gets aroused with that.  And Ben is just laughing.  Of course.  Uncontrolled.  E-Rog, E-Rog.  I adore.  E-Rog, E-Rog.  E-Rog, E-Rog, E-Rog.  Tell him, Brad. 
[02:10:00]  Jimmy wants you to spit in his mouth.  Simple as that.  He didn't offer me the last slice of orange.  I'm sorry.  You want it?  All right.  Let's see what goes on here.  Wow.  Would you spit in his mouth?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  I won't try to kiss you.  All right, hold on.  We want to get...  Orange, yeah.  Why, you wanted some of the orange out of his mouth?  Oh, I wouldn't give you a chewed orange.  You're a beautiful girl.  I'd feel like a silly goose doing that.  It's saliva.  And then when I spit it back into your mouth.  Oh, you can just...  You don't...  I just want to do this... 
[02:10:30]  You've never done this before, have you?  I've had my mouth spit in, yeah, but no one's ever...  All right, lean back.  Lean back.  Wait, wait, wait.  We've got to get on mic.  Someone get this mic for the fine listen.  So, Jimmy Norton is leaning way back and...  What's your name again?  Friday.  Friday.  That's right.  I should remember that name.  Now, should I drool it off the tip of my tongue or should I just...  Jimmy?  Whatever Jimmy likes.  Not a whole lot.  Just a little bit.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, not a whole lot.  Oh, you can, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Can you grab his package while you do it?  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  He's pulling his shirt up.  Look at his little baby chest.  Oh, my God.  Meaty. 
[02:11:00]  Okay, she's dripping the spit.  Wow, she sucked it back.  That was just ready to come and break apart.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you sick little fuck.  You're fucking sick.  Thank you, baby.  It was kind of hanging from her tongue and swinging, and it broke off, and it was ready  to go on his chin, but he kind of went down and got it.  You are a twisted fuck.  You got, like, a little bird in the nest. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Mommy's got the worm for Jimmy.  Are you just packing a huge rod now, Jimmy?  What does the turn on with that?  If a girl is sexy, why not?  It's like kissing.  What's the difference?  Yeah.  I thought I would be more into that.  Kissing without all those pesky lips and tongue.  Who needs eye contact and intimacy?  It's drivel.  I like just all the saliva thing with sexy.  That's why I just like walking around with my own semen and throwing it at girls' pussies.  Just like fucking.  I found something.  I'm packing like four.  Oh.  Friday is rubbing.  Well.  I'm getting to me crotch right now. 
[02:12:00]  Well now.  It's rocking?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  It worked.  I like Friday.  He likes it.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Tickle, tickle, tickle.  Is it moving?  Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.  It's a little, yeah.  I whacked three out last night.  Yeah?  Three loads yesterday.  Yeah, it's myself, and she's really turning me on.  It still works, yes.  She's lovely.  Would you like her to sit on you, Jimmy?  I'm shy.  Okay.  You're shy, all right. 
[02:12:30]  Friday, can you do me a favor?  You notice Jimmy's arms, there's...  It's embarrassing.  I don't have any arm hair.  They always laugh at me.  Well, it's kind of wispy.  Take a look.  That's the same.  I really love body hair, especially back hair.  You like back hair?  Oh, look at our cameraman.  Why not?  She left the shirt on my fat, awful stomach.  How about yours?  Look at his back.  Just the back.  Well, yeah.  You had it waxed?  Sweating, lemony-sandled.  Look how hairy Steve is.  Oh, I love it.  Not hairy enough.  Really?  Well, it's got to grow in. 
[02:13:00]  Let me feel it.  Do you shave?  Do you shave?  He shaves, he plucks, he waxes.  You like hairy, sweaty guys like that?  He goes to a hair removal place full-time.  Wow, she's smelling his back.  Wow, smells good.  This Friday is a go-getter.  Yeah.  From danni.com.  D-A-N-N-I dot com.  You guys know what you're doing here today?  Mm-hmm.  She knows.  She goes, just puts her arms up.  Spitting in people's mouths and smelling a Lebanese guy's back.  He's just sweating because he had a bomb belt on an hour ago. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, Wendy.  Yeah?  We've got a really hot girl in the studio, so we've got to let you go.  I know.  Who's Wendy?  I don't even remember why you called, sorry.  I don't either.  I don't either.  There she goes, Wendy.  Let us know she lives in a nice racist neighborhood.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  All right, so we're going to brief the girls, and we'll see what we can get done.  She's terrific.  Yeah, we like you Friday.  Are you on the site with Danny Esch?  Oh, yeah.  And what else do you do?  Lots and lots. 
[02:14:00]  What don't I do?  Well, what do you want to promote?  That's all I'm getting at.  Okay, well, I just started my own perfume line.  You did?  I noticed it smelled very good when you walked in.  You like that?  Yeah.  It's called Scent of a Whore.  Scent of a Whore, huh?  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Subtle?  Yeah, a little subtle.  Yeah.  Let me smell the Scent of a Whore.  Okay.  And then I've got the men's line.  It's called Smell of Money.  Smell of Money.  Scent of a Whore.  Yeah.  That's funny.  You spray it.  It makes you smell Jewish.  Hey, everybody. 
[02:14:30]  Let's bring the...  Saving up the smell.  Jewish?  Let's all bring these home to our girlfriends.  Give her Scent of a Whore.  It says it right on the thing.  Let me see.  That's right.  It does smell good.  Have no guilt.  Very nice.  Feel no shame.  Be strong.  Be independent.  Yet nurturing.  Please yourself.  And share yourself with your lover.  Or share yourself and please your lover.  Scent of a Whore.  Those are very nice implants, by the way.  You like?  They're amazing.  Yeah.  You really like it.  Yeah, we better...  Too much to undress me.  Well, we better just take a...  Too much to undress me.  We better just take a look just to make sure. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, Jimmy will do the honor.  Jesus, they can't get the damn...  Jesus, don't wreck the whole...  They're actually ripping down the curtains.  Holy fucking Ernest Eager.  That's when you know when you have a hot girl in the studio, you hear the shades go down  like that.  Usually it's like you hear the shades slowly going down like, oh, Jesus, do we have to  do this?  I don't know.  You're trying to think of a reason why we don't have to do it by the time the shades  go down, but...  Oh, never mind.  I wasn't going anywhere.  All right.  She's like... 
[02:15:30]  There you go.  Look at those nipples.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Those are really nice.  That is magnificent.  Have you seen breasts before?  A couple of times growing up.  Usually the implants stink, but...  And Playboy.  Those are very nice implants.  I looked out, didn't I?  I really did.  Yeah, because they're not misshaped or anything.  Well, because you were big to begin with, probably.  I mean, big up, you know.  You didn't have big boobs?  No, big up.  Oh, wow.  Yeah?  Because that's usually the problem.  Girls try to go way too big, and they didn't have much to work with to begin with.  Do you have lotion?  They're feeling dry. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, Jimmy, would you love to rub some lotion on that?  Rub the lotion on the breasts.  Yeah, of course.  Does this whatever it's toad.  That's butter.  No, no, no.  Do we have a...  That's butter.  Why does that say boy butter on it?  It's churn-style boy butter.  Why do we have boy butter in the studio?  What is boy butter?  It's the personal lubricant.  Let me see that.  What?  Who brought the boy butter in?  Oh, she's fantastic.  Is it from those girls from mysexstore.com?  Yeah.  All right, get the girls in here really fast.  I want to know what this boy butter is all about. 
[02:16:30]  That's right, Hawk.  It's for jacking off, by the way.  For jacking off.  What do you use this for?  Jacking off?  I love that movie.  I'm also in a movie.  A regular movie.  You are?  What movie?  It's called The Ding Dong Show.  Oh, that sounds like a regular movie.  The Ding Dong Show.  Yeah, it's about comedy.  That's Lucas or Spielberg.  Which one did that one?  The Ding Dong movie.  Don Barris.  He's the co-creator of Windy City Heat.  Don Barris from...  Oh, no, it's Chuck Barris.  I'm thinking of...  Chuck Barris.  Don Barris from L.A.?  Oh, that's Dyson's friend.  Is he bald? 
[02:17:00]  He has a huge cock?  Okay, I know Don.  Oh, we know that guy.  Yeah, I know Don.  He's a good guy.  He's a giant cock legendary.  I've never seen him.  I've heard it's fucking massive.  Yeah.  Have you seen it?  I hear he's really packing.  Yeah.  Good boy.  Wow.  She's really into Don's cock.  It's nice to me and this really hot chick related on another man's cock size.  God.  And you see the girl behind you?  She has nice boobs, too.  Natural.  Natural.  And she does a sex store thing.  Mysexstore.com.  Has it been used?  No, it hasn't.  No, it hasn't.  All right, what is this boy butter thing about?  Boy butter is actually more for... 
[02:17:30]  It's a gay lube, is really what it is.  Yeah.  No shit.  But a name like boy butter.  You should see the guy who makes it.  No.  And then she said that and you couldn't get the lid back on fast enough.  I was putting the lid on it.  Yeah, I couldn't get it on fast enough.  Boy butter.  The logo is a big, muscular, manly arm churning a butter churn.  Exactly.  You should see the guy who actually owns the company.  He's this huge, massive, gorgeous hunk and, you know, he's gay. 
[02:18:00]  And he's a fantastic marketing guy.  Is that for that fisting?  Could be.  I don't really.  I don't know.  Not gay.  Slick, long-lasting and fun.  A downright pleasure to spread.  Washes off with water.  Ingredients, partially hydronated vegetable oil, glycerin, polysorbate 60.  I just want you to know, I mean, do you see what's going on behind me?  It's way better than the boy butter dude.  Yay!  Friday is officially breaking into the liberator by herself.  Who? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, you might as well just jump on the couch with Friday.  I know, I know.  I think your mom would get involved.  My mom?  Yeah.  No doubt.  I love Friday.  Friday, would you want to hang out with a mom for a little while?  Wow, she's too busy doing...  Wow, she's like spinning around.  She's doing handstands and headstands in the other room.  On the liberator.  Whoa, now she's on all fours with her ass right in the engineer window.  That's right.  Gotta love the liberator.  The liberator, the liberator, the liberator, the liberator, the liberator.  It's funny, what a day the sales guy picks to show up. 
[02:19:00]  Of course.  He set this whole thing up.  I know, I'm just saying.  That's the type of sales people we got.  That's Will from WYNC.  Will gave up a great gig because he believes in our show that much.  Will's filthy.  Will literally gave up a lot of money to join the organization.  Because Will knows at YSP he's not seeing this.  All right, well...  Oh, she's lovely.  That's terrific.  What a hiney.  Can we play cherry darts today?  Whoa, don't hurt yourself.  Yeah, please.  Don't fall.  That would break my fucking heart. 
[02:19:30]  I gotta pee.  I'm a professional.  You're lovely.  Can you pee on Jimmy today?  No, I can't get peed on.  I gotta travel.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, it makes traveling a little difficult.  I gotta drive.  I gotta go to Philly.  Yeah, all right.  All right, well, I guess we should take a break.  Yeah, I can see.  All right.  I know the girl's gonna enjoy the festivities in a little while.  Yeah, that's how it works.  She's out there.  See, what a trooper.  And what's partyonfriday.net?  Perfume.  Oh, that's where you get the perfume. 
[02:20:00]  The scent of a whore, right?  The scent of a whore.  Mm-hmm.  Hoo-ah!  D1, put me out of a job.  You want anything else from her before we go to break, Jimmy?  Maybe when we come back.  I have to tinkle badly.  So then I'll put some...  She says she needs some lotion on her bosoms.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that.  Yeah.  If she doesn't object.  All right.  If she doesn't object.  Lovely.  No, I think she's gonna be a trooper.  She's my favorite.  I think we can officially lift the girl ban.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this breaks the ban, that's for sure.  No more embargo.  That's wonderful. 
[02:20:30]  We'll say hi to Kevin real fast.  Kevin.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What up?  Oh, I just want to tell Jimmy, man, he's my fucking hero, dude.  Thank you.  He got this beautiful woman in there playing with his junk, man, spitting in his mouth,  and now he's playing with her big old titties.  Oh, my God.  He's my fucking hero, man.  Dude, I am living proof that mediocrity can work out.  Oh, dude, if it works for you, it can work for me, man.  Thanks, bro.  Watch out.  All right.  Very good.  Okay, we'll continue with Friday and the other girl.

[02:23:30]  Hello.  There we go.  All right.  What happened?  Whose mistake was that?  Whose error was that?  Who's that?  E-Rock's?  Wow, E-Rock is getting...  How is that me?  I'm standing over here.  He's running the board, not me.  Uh-oh.  Eric came in and started pushing all these buttons during the break.  I thought, what are you doing, Eric?  I was like, why are you in here?  Oh.  And then he leaves, and I don't know what's going on. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, that's why I was in here the entire break, taking photos, right?  Thank you.  Fucking liar.  Thank you.  Dude, why are you pushing buttons in there?  Eric should know better.  Yeah, Derek's in there trying to do something.  Yeah, what happened, Eric?  Not much, but like turning the mics on, right?  Ooh.  Oh, hey.  Walk raises a good point.  E-Rock fighting back.  That's right.  He doesn't take any shit.  Ah, E-Rock.  Ah, dude, buttons on.  Ah, dude, buttons on the board.  Ah, dude.  Tell him, Fred.  Ah, ah, ah.  All right, here we go.  Hey, all right. 
[02:24:30]  Here's the deal.  We got Friday in the studio.  She's already working herself over on the Liberator.  Hey, Steve, could you position her that way so the boys can maybe see a little?  We want to thank the fine folks from the Liberator Company for sending in these Liberators,  and Friday is breaking in one right now as we speak, yes.  That's the butterfly.  Maybe she could turn and face so maybe the boys could see a little baseball.  Maybe.  Can they turn the Liberator?  Because she's really beautiful.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Hi.  LOL. 
[02:25:00]  Keith keeps hitting the remote on her.  So out of nowhere, it just starts vibrating on her.  Yeah, we got the butterfly on her, which is one of the toys that the girls from MySexyStore.com brought in,  and Keith is working the remote right now.  Does it feel good?  Mm-hmm.  Sure is Mike or Malfoy.  He's Mike in your vagina, Eric.  Jesus, are you inexperienced in sex?  Get off.  Say you want more.  I want more.  More?  There you go.  Mm-hmm.  Thank you. 
[02:25:30]  More.  Say you want more.  I want more.  It kicks in.  Beg for more.  More.  No.  Beg.  Please.  Jesus.  You think you're on a traffic stop, Keith?  Yeah.  You don't want this ticket, do you?  He's like that one cop threatening to taser that woman.  You don't lay back on the Liberator.  I'm going to taser you.  Keith's the cop from that new movie Crash.  Where are your girls been? 
[02:26:00]  The kick-ack club.  Kick-ack club.  Smoke some grass.  Spit in someone's mouth.  You want more?  As opposed to good?  Fucking Jay, I can't stop thinking about that.  That is a good one.  We've got to get that on Patty.  We've got to get that on Patty.  Let's get Stalker Patty in here.  This is too hot.  This is sexy.  Yeah, this is much too sexy and hot.  We've got to really fuck it up now.  Let's wreck things as we always do.  We've got much better things planned for Friday.  Trust me.  I know.  Ugh.  All right, Friday.  Once again, proving that God has a sense of humor, here's Stalker Patty. 
[02:26:30]  Sorry, you're going to have to give that up if you could.  The old DNA.  Patty, hi.  Hi.  Wait, let me do my gag.  The old DNA.  You mix it up one way and it comes out like this fine specimen Friday.  And then you mix it up another way and you get this mess.  I'm not a mess.  I'm not a mess.  No.  I don't like your toes.  They're all fucked up.  What happened, Patty?  And we've got them fixed for her.  It's like tsunami trees.  Look at them.  Hey, I had two foot surgeries. 
[02:27:00]  The first time I'm able to wear sandals in two years, so I'm happy.  You know who you should do your foot surgery?  The same guy that did Kunta Kinte.  Who's that?  Exactly.  I've never heard of him.  All right, Patty, get naked.  Well, he's down to your underpants.  We've got a treat for you today.  Just get naked.  What are you going to put on me?  I heard that.  Don't worry about it.  It's nothing bad.  Just take down to your underpants.  It's about time we start violating you.  Yeah.  Getting you all loose for a man.  Now get naked.  Jesus.  Get naked. 
[02:27:30]  What?  Just take off those hot pants.  Just take off your shorts.  Your camp shorts.  My shorts.  God.  Yeah.  I've never seen hot pants that are pulled up to the nipples.  My God.  No, they're not.  Take off your Al Dukes.  Yeah.  She's got Al Dukes.  Why?  David Dukes.  God, that was better.  Because everyone knows David Dukes.  That's better than a clown mask on the floor.  And it sounded like Daisy. 
[02:28:00]  Good one.  Shit.  That'd suck.  You're inspired, Jimmy.  Turn around.  Let's see your hot panties from all different angles.  Yeah.  Give us a spin patty.  What is that red elf on them?  Those are Santa panties.  Santa panties.  There's a little red elf on them.  What are those?  Are those Christmas panties?  I don't know.  I just bought them on sale.  On sale.  There's an elf lady on there.  Yeah.  Dressed like Santa Claus.  Why are you wearing Christmas panties?  How old are you?  Four?  No.  I just...  Shut up. 
[02:28:30]  Underwear is underwear is underwear.  I don't even look at it.  I just put it on.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Words to live by.  Underwear is underwear is underwear.  All right.  Well...  All right.  Let's get the butterfly.  Well, what's a butterfly?  Get a hold of yourself.  It's not going to hurt you.  Get the butterfly off.  It's underwear.  Yeah.  It doesn't go in, Patty.  Don't worry about it.  Underwear is underwear is underwear.  This goes on the outside of you.  Oh, this is going to be horrific.  Wait a minute.  Just put it on.  What's this thing in there?  Hold on. 
[02:29:00]  First of all...  Get the lady from MySexyStore.com to get this on.  Yeah.  Get that brought in here.  Because, Patty, don't do anything with it yet, because you'll just screw up with how it's  supposed to go on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We're going to get the lady from MySexyStore.com.  Yeah.  She's got to adjust the size for a concentration camp victim anyway.  Okay.  What do you guys need me to do?  All right.  We need to put that on Patty.  Oh.  I know.  It's going to be a challenge.  Trust me.  Yeah.  Please help us out.  Okay.  They're like thongs.  It's like a thong, Patty.  You know what a thong is, right?  Oh, wait. 
[02:29:30]  It's got something in it.  Don't worry about it.  Relax.  Don't worry about it.  It's an M.A.E.  Don't worry so much, Patty.  I know.  You're 50.  You're officially 50.  It's time to live a little.  Seriously.  I'm falling out of my dressing.  I know you are.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  Your cheeks look good, Patty.  You like her cheeks?  Yeah.  They're not bad.  See, Patty?  That's not bad.  You make sure it's positioned properly, because it looks like it's up too high. 
[02:30:00]  I was going to say, why are we trying to stimulate the belly button?  I know.  It looks like it's up too high.  Move it down a little bit.  Put it where it belongs.  You would know.  You're the expert.  Yeah.  So put it where it's so unsexy.  Real nice.  This is the worst.  It is.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  It's actually sexier watching them strap a murderer into an electric chair.  That's the best thing they're able to do.  All right.  Why don't we get...  I can't believe I'm saying this.  Stark and Patty, why don't you lie down on the liberator? 
[02:30:30]  Is it all set?  Yeah.  We're all done.  That's the liberator.  The only thing that you could lie down on in this room.  That's all positioned all nice, right?  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Just lay down.  Just lay on it.  Lay down.  All right.  Make sure your mic is locked.  What's going to happen?  Nothing's going to happen.  All right.  Get the gas and the mattress.  Did I hit it?  You're going to do it?  Yeah.  What's going to happen?  I just got the control.  What's going to happen?  Nothing.  Stop panicking.  Relax.  You're all relaxed, though? 
[02:31:00]  You're 50 with a mullet.  It's all right.  What the heck is it doing?  What the hell?  It's a vibrator.  What's the matter, Patty?  I'm ready to go, Captain Obvious.  Put it back.  All right.  Put it back.  Put it back.  It's not.  It's not.  Just leave it there.  You're absolutely crazy.  Hold on.  You ready?  Tie her hands.  I'm sorry.  She pulled the battery.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pin her down.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  We're going to make this a little better. 
[02:31:30]  Hold on.  We're going to make this a little better, Patty.  Just relax for a second.  Okay.  There it goes.  What a fun.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because we don't want you to take the thing off.  Yeah.  It's about time you have a little fun.  I've had enough of that panic face.  Are we holding her?  Keith?  You don't know how scared I am.  Why?  No one's going to hurt you?  Not yet?  Oh, my God.  Watch the reaction.  Watch the reaction.  What are you doing?  No.  No. 
[02:32:00]  Come on, Patty.  There's no sense in resisting.  Don't resist.  Don't resist.  He's going to have to taste.  We're going to tase you.  We're going to tase you.  Don't worry about it.  Don't scare me now.  This is really sick.  You're scaring me now.  Please, Mace.  You're scaring me.  Please, Mace.  I'm scared of you, officer.  Don't flip this.  All right.  Why are you putting here?  No.  Look at her.  She's all scared.  Here.  We'll make it feel better, Patty.  All right.  Is that thing working? 
[02:32:30]  Yep.  Yep.  Patty, can we put the handcuffs on you?  I guess we should ask.  No.  Why?  I do not like that.  No.  I do not like that.  I'm a lady.  No.  I'm a nice lady.  I know.  I knew that was coming.  All right.  All right.  Pin our hands back.  Take our hands.  Come on, Robin.  All right.  I mean.  It's off.  I just turned it off for a second.  Why are you doing that?  Don't worry.  Because we don't want you touching the area.  We want you to enjoy it for once.  All right.  Now, here we go, Patty.  You ready?  No.  It might hurt a little bit. 
[02:33:00]  What are you doing?  Is it working?  Oh, my God.  This is something you do in privacy, not something you do in front of people.  That's okay.  There's only 30 people looking at you.  Shut your eyes, Patty.  Relax and enjoy it.  Yes.  Do you have, like, a blindfold or something?  I don't think we're...  Oh, God.  Just close your eyes, Patty.  How about a sock?  Look at her face.  Oh, my God.  Patty's looking at it.  Turn it on and off.  Anthony's giving Stark and Patty an orgasm.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:30]  Awful armpit stains.  You're all crazy.  You're crazy.  We're crazy.  Ann's turning the vibrator on and off.  The butterfly panty thing.  Oh, God.  What do you think, Patty?  Do you have it on?  What do you think, Patty?  No, it's weird.  What's weird about it?  It happens automatically.  You don't turn it on yourself.  No.  Look at her face.  She's, like, she's freaking out. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah?  Does it feel good at all, Patty?  It just feels strange.  Look at Patty.  Jesus.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, tell them, friend.  You're right.  Oh, you're nuts.  Is it off?  Is it off?  Now it is.  Now it is?  Keep it on for a while, because I think she might, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's on.  Yeah, just relax. 
[02:34:30]  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  Just enjoy it.  Just think of something nice, a pleasant thought.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of how crazy people...  Just think of a nice thought.  Crazy.  Crazy.  It's Woody Allen.  Crazy.  Look at the edge.  It's embarrassing.  Why?  No one cares.  It's embarrassing.  No one cares.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's all good.  Yeah.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  Okay. 
[02:35:00]  I've had enough.  No.  No.  That means you need more.  Yeah.  No.  Why?  Are you afraid to let go?  What's the matter with you?  No one's bothering you.  Let go with your feelings.  Use the force.  Someone go get the big black vibrator.  Yeah.  And the hammer.  No.  Yeah.  Get that thing called the anal intruder.  Yeah.  No.  Bring in the anal intruder.  No.  The anal intruder.  That's right.  No.  Get the chloroform in the beads.  Quickly.  No.  Bring in the black power vibrator.  Opie, you're terrible. 
[02:35:30]  Terrible.  That wasn't a very convincing terrible, though.  No.  Yeah, let's push down there.  Oh, what are you doing?  Friday's helping her out.  She's just putting it in.  Yeah, she's going to help you out a little bit.  No one's going to hurt you on the show?  No one's going to hurt you.  Oh, that's the spot?  She's going to.  All right.  Go ahead, Ed.  I want it back.  What do you think, Patty?  She's had it long enough.  Her eyes open up like the guy in Caddyshack, where his boat's ready to get hit by... 
[02:36:00]  No, no, no, no, I'm not...  No.  You're not what, Patty?  What's going on?  Shelly Duvall had a sexier look on her face when his head posted a bathroom door.  I'm not either, but I like the butterfly.  She tried to get...  Friday tried to, like, maybe straddle her a little and used a butterfly with her.  It might be something somebody does in private without letting anyone know.  Really?  You would enjoy something like this in private, you think?  Yeah, but stuff like this in privacy of your home. 
[02:36:30]  I just turned on home.  Oh, yeah, you've got to get her in mid-sentence.  Yeah.  That's so weird.  What's weird about it?  What's weird about it?  It's supposed to feel good.  I am a good sport.  Let your guilt go.  I think you're too guilty, Patty, about your past and upbringing and everything.  Just because your parents are looking at you from heaven disappointed, it's not a problem.  I don't know if they're in heaven.  Oh, hey.  Look, she can't talk right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:37:00]  You're going to be one lousy lay.  Oh, my God, are you going to be the worst?  No, I only want to share that with someone I care about.  Oh, stop.  Who, St. Peter?  Yeah.  You've got to get out there, Patty.  Yeah.  Enjoy yourself.  Yeah.  Patty, what's going on down there?  You're feeling a little tingling sensation?  Is it tingling?  Yeah.  I guess that's what you would call it.  I'm not going to work through the underwear anyway.  No?  All right.  I feel it.  All right.  Why don't we get it underneath the underwear then? 
[02:37:30]  Patty, one last thing and then we'll finish the bit.  That's my job.  Yeah.  Put it on underneath your underwear, Patty.  Just for a second.  Is that going to hurt you?  You can see it's just a little...  It's clean.  It just came out of the box.  It's brand new.  It's brand new.  It will be clean when it's done.  Whose box?  Friday's.  Thanks, Ann, for the help.  Could you peel your Christmas panties aside and shove that in?  It's there.  Make sure it is.  Is it?  No.  No.  We want them under the panties.  It is.  Put the panties over.  It's not on the lips.  You got to really get it there. 
[02:38:00]  Could you cover that unused change purse?  Make sure she's doing it right.  Someone get in there.  It's Friday's job.  No, you're the expert.  Let's go.  No, I'm the expert.  Friday, you want to help her out, maybe?  Just fix the panties.  Friday's going to help you.  All right.  Friday's going to help her.  Don't worry, you won't turn into a lesbian.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold it in place.  All right.  Ready?  All right.  Here we go.  The grand finale.  Stalker Patty using the butterfly vibrator thing that has a remote control that Anthony's  holding. 
[02:38:30]  I don't know.  I just feel it vibrating.  This is awful.  She's too guilty to enjoy it.  She's awful.  No.  She's too guilty to enjoy it, aren't you?  Whoever dropped you off at Childhood had the right.  I didn't know what they were doing.  I think it's more like I'm in front of people and doing this.  Is that what it is?  I think so.  Yeah?  I think you'd like that a little bit if you weren't in front of people. 
[02:39:00]  What do you think?  I don't know.  Probably.  Yeah.  Well, who wouldn't?  Do you think that you're not controlling it, though?  That someone else is controlling it?  And just surprise.  Surprise.  There it is.  It's going off.  You can't do nothing.  She's making me sick that I'm doing it.  Here.  Take this.  I'm not touching that thing.  Jimmy.  Do it angry.  Click, click, click, click, click.  Like I'm looking for something on TV.  Click, click, click, click, click.  I was going to say, like you're looking for something I'm watching on a Friday night.  The same awful translucent thing on every channel.  That's enough.  Where's the button that makes it explode? 
[02:39:30]  I think I've had enough.  Oh, because you're feeling like you're going to come.  I've had enough.  I think so.  You feel like you're going to orgasm, right?  I don't know.  Just keep it there.  Don't move it.  Keep it there.  Why?  Is that going to hurt you?  Just let it roll, Patty.  Oh, my.  It's fine.  It's not going to hurt you.  You leave it there.  Leave it there.  We're giving you, like.  Put it right where you want it.  What do you think?  Let it roll.  Ride.  See, she gets all nervous because she feels something welling up inside her. 
[02:40:00]  Stop being guilty.  Yeah.  It's just blood flowing right now.  Don't sweat it.  Don't sweat it.  Great.  It's off.  Oh, no, it's not.  Oh.  I can hear it making noises.  How many volts is that?  600,000 volts.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Thank God, no. 
[02:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  You're nuts.  No.  You're pussy.  Very funny.  All right.  All right.  Just shut your eyes, Pat.  Yeah, close your eyes.  There you go.  I'm not going to do anything.  Ugh.  You going to have an orgasm?  I'm embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  Just close your eyes.  We'll attack you with soap in our pillowcases. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  Well, Jesus.  I don't think she's relaxed enough.  I don't think she's relaxed enough.  You think?  Yeah.  Hit her on the head with a shovel.  What shovel?  I don't know.  All right.  What are you shoveling?  By the way, Keith the Cobb's in the studio.  Keep that thing on.  We'll check back in a minute.  You mean if you can...  Keith is doing something for the show in the near future.  Keith?  Well, back in the day, we did a little ride down to Philadelphia. 
[02:41:30]  Took all the motorcycles down there.  I remember that one.  Bunch of motorcycles when we were first syndicated down there.  It was called the Wow Summit.  It was called the Wow Summit.  Right.  It was bringing together the two cities in the spirit of tits.  Isn't that wonderful?  And, um...  Also known as, uh...  An excuse to get away from the Y's for the day.  And, well, we're going to do it again.  And, oddly enough, Philadelphia wins because it's the only city close enough to do it in the, uh... 
[02:42:00]  Allotted four-hour time period that we have during the show.  Right.  So, on July 13th, which is a Wednesday,  for everybody out there who says that Wow doesn't work,  you're going to put a Wow on your vehicle.  And, uh, from about 7.30 in the morning, we're going to leave the studio here  with a bunch of motorcycles and women on the back of it.  And we're going to, uh, head down to Philadelphia to a strip club, oddly enough, in Philadelphia  that, uh, Will set up for us.  It's called Club Risque. 
[02:42:30]  And I know that because he wrote it in the email and he phonetically spelled it for me.  He said, it's pronounced R-I-S-K-K-A-Y.  Like I'm Rich Voss and I was going to pronounce it like R-I-S-K-U or something like that.  Club R-I-S-K-U or R-I-S-K-E.  So, uh, I guess he didn't think I was going to be able to get that right.  And, uh...  Patty just jumped.  What happened, Patty?  They keep turning it on and off and then when they turn it on, it's like this... 
[02:43:00]  It shocked me.  Yeah, it shocked me, all right.  All right, well, just enjoy it.  All right, back to Keith.  And, uh, Club Risque is located at 1700 South Columbus Boulevard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  And, um, we're going to meet here at the studio on 57th Street.  We're going to form up about 6.30.  When we go on live, uh, 7 o'clock, we're going to get out of here about 7.30.  We're going to head down to Philly. 
[02:43:30]  And, uh, we're going to...  I'll post the route up on the internet.  Yep, I'll work with Steve.  We'll get it up there.  And, uh, if you've got a bike, or if you're a chick that wants to wow on the way down there,  um, get in touch with me.  You can get in touch with me at KeithTheCopp at AOL.com.  And, uh, we do have, actually, one person that's coming with us on this trip, and, well, that's, uh, Patty.  Patty.  I remember last time she enjoyed it, she was like, I like the motorcycle. 
[02:44:00]  I liked how it vibrated.  Remember that, Patty?  Yeah.  You said that.  Now you've got a vibrator, and now it's freaking you out.  Well, you know, I'm not used to these things.  I never experienced one before, you know?  Before!  Does it feel good now that you're relaxed a little more?  They keep turning it on and off intermittently.  That's such a sexy word. 
[02:44:30]  Intermittently!  That's very similar to the motorcycle, right, Patty?  He's making my pussy intermittently.  Intermittently!  Ugh!  All right, so that's it, right, Keith?  All that info will be up on opiananthony.com.  Exactly.  But it's July 13th or Wednesday.  July 13th or Wednesday.  Uh, any girls that want to get in touch, like I said, you can email me at KeithTheCopp at AOL.  It's a big bike ride to, uh, Philly.  I just see Ben Levin's ass all the time.  Come on, come on, come on.  He wanted Earl to be on the back of a motorcycle going down there for some reason. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  Well, he has to be on the back.  Oh.  All right, well, are we going to take a break and we'll sex this scene up?  Yeah, let's get it really rocking on the, uh, on the Liberator.  Patty?  Yeah?  You want to take that home with you, Patty?  It'd be kind of cute to have around in the bathroom.  Kind of cute to have around in the bathroom?  In the bathroom to do what?  That's where I do all my naughty business.  That's where all the dirty stuff happens, in the bathroom. 
[02:45:30]  She comes in all at once.  Oh, just shit, piss.  Picks her nose while a log is coming out and she masturbates.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  All right.  Plop, plop, plop.  Plop, plop.  Friday?  Friday, can you straddle Stalker Patty as we go to break?  What?  We're just going to have Friday straddle you as we go to break. 
[02:46:00]  Go ahead, Friday.  No, I'm not like that.  Go ahead, Friday.  It's not being like anything.  Go that way.  It's not being like anything.  Yeah, relax.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, Friday.  Go ahead, Friday.  Don't be a faggot.  Patty, it's not being like anything.  We know you're not a lesbian.  It's just two people having a little, you know, get-together.  We're not gay, but we straddle each other all the time.  Just a bunch of men getting together laughing.  Jimmy's taking a dump.  I've got to pee.  There's only one toilet.  Open up your legs, Jimmy.  That's right.  You know. 
[02:46:30]  Friday, straddle, stalker, Patty.  No.  Oh, Patty.  I'm not like that.  I know.  It's okay.  You know, like what?  Entertainment.  Sure.  I'm not a lesbian.  It's not about being a lesbian.  No one is saying you're a lesbian.  People say I am.  No one will say that.  People say if you hold a dick in your mouth, you're a gay guy.  Not necessarily.  You're just holding it.  What are you doing?  There you go.  What are you doing?  That's right.  Yeah, hot, isn't it, Patty? 
[02:47:00]  See, Patty?  Friday and stalker dyke.  Patty.  See?  Doesn't that feel better?  Friday, rub those goodnesses in her face.  I don't like it.  Is the vibrator going?  No, I don't like it.  What's there not to like?  She's getting smothered in these 38 double D's.  You're not like that.  We know.  Patty, would you let her tinkle on you?  No.  Patty, let her spit in your mouth.  No.  Come on.  Go ahead, Patty.  No.  What do you think, Patty? 
[02:47:30]  That's hot, right?  Right?  Not really.  A guy?  Maybe a boyfriend or something.  All right.  Better if it was a black gentleman.  I like the colored boys.  All right.  Thank you, Patty.  That was fun.  Good job, Patty.  Wonderful.  Give her the remote control.  Patty, you can take that home with you.  I can.  A lovely parting gift.  We'll put that next to your Superman panties.  Yeah, because no one else is going to want to use that now.  What is the control?  Why do you got old lady sandals on, Patty? 
[02:48:00]  She's 50 old.  I don't.  Because she's an old lady.  These are nice sandals.  50 is nowhere near old.  You got old lady slipper sandals on.  Look at the big pink rose.  We used to have to put our naughty bits against the Maytag in the old days.  Look, I don't have the income to go into a high-priced shoe place and get really good sandals.  Oh, my God.  I'll give you money.  They sell them right outside the station for like $10.  I think these are sexy enough. 
[02:48:30]  Sexy.  If you're taking your grandson to Avalon.  Flowers are in.  Let me see.  Well, flowers are in.  Let me see the sandals.  And the size.  I haven't seen them.  All right.  Let's look at those toes.  Look at this.  Walk over here, Patty.  But stay there.  She's like right there.  Look at her arthritis feet.  Oh, my God.  I think they're nice.  One big toes.  We're going one way.  One's going the other.  There's a woman in the middle going, I've never been fucked.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:49:00]  That's your remote control for your vibrator.  That's the remote.  Where does it hook up?  It doesn't.  You just work it remotely.  It's a battery.  See?  And you click the switch.  Oh, I see the little beam.  You flip the switch.  Yeah.  And then it makes the vibrator start and stop.  All right, Patty.  All right.  I like your fashion statement with your sandals.  It is kind of cool.  You look just like Annie Hall.  That's right.  Jesus.  Old James Con feet.  Like one of the Ramones in sandals, she looks like.  All right, let's get her out of here. 
[02:49:30]  Jesus.  Oh, there you go, Patty.  You have fun with that tonight.  Never going to get her out of the house.  She's going to lose her job and everything.  She really...  Get her every time.  All right, we're going to get Mackenzie Mack in here in a few minutes.  And Friday's in the studio.  And some real action.  Real action on the Liberator.  Real girl-on-girl action on the Liberator.  Beautiful girls.  When the Opie and Anthony show continues.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? 
[02:50:00]  Ansel all the boy-nots.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And be it.  Yeah!  Fix it, fix it.  Guess who's back.  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice head, dick.  Back. 
[02:50:30]  Back it.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Back again.  Guess who's back.  Celebrate.  Get it off.  Guess who's back.  Hey!  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Turn it off!  Back.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Ah, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now. 
[02:51:00]  What the fuck is I doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  Now, this is a psycho job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so easy without me.  I'm saying, this is a psycho job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little hope.  Hey, Anthony.  Because it feels so easy without me.  Okay, Carton.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  We're setting up the Liberators for the girls.  We've got Friday in studio, and Mackenzie Mack coming in in a few minutes. 
[02:52:00]  In the meantime, because they're, like, draping some cloth over the Liberators, so the girls could use lube and stuff.  In the meantime, Anthony, really fast.  This is a quickie, I guess.  Andrea Yates Audio from Conversations with Killers.  I guess it's something they're doing on A&E or something like that?  Nice A&E, your murderer network.  Love it.  Watch all those crime shows. 
[02:52:30]  Interviews with the murderers.  How they did it.  Cold case files.  Fun shows.  So they're talking to killers, basically.  Yeah.  Now they're interviewing them.  And this is the Yates one?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's your words of wisdom from her.  Well, we've got the 9-11 audio, first of all.  A little piece of that.  So we'll start there.  9-1-1?  Yeah, I said 9-11.  Jesus.  9-1-1.  Audio.  My God.  9-1-1.  9-1-1.  There's no 11 on the phone.  How am I supposed to?  Well, what do I do? 
[02:53:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Cold phone.  What's your name?  Andrea Yates.  What's the problem?  I just need him to come.  Is your head in there?  No.  Are you having a disturbance?  Are you ill or what?  Yes, I'm ill.  You need an ambulance?  No, I need a police officer.  Yeah, I've been an ambulance.  What's the problem?  Hello?  I just need a police officer.  I just what?  I just need a police officer. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, okay.  She wasn't saying what happened?  Right.  Huh.  It's around her kids.  I thought maybe we were going to get a...  Jimmy, what?  What happened?  I didn't say a word.  No, I saw you just go, wow.  She's very nice.  I know, but you were looking at a picture on your digital camera.  What happened?  It was a picture of Friday's vag.  There's a whole photo shoot, video shoot going on in the studio while we're talking about Andrea Yates.  Attempting to do just something a little different before we get back to the girls. 
[02:54:00]  No, I know, but I saw your face and you can't just make believe you didn't make...  Oh, I couldn't help it.  You know, Jimmy, we're talking about something a little more sexy than what's going on in the studio.  Ooh.  Jimmy's getting a peek at the...  Wow.  It's really nice.  You like that one, Jimmy?  Jimmy is inspecting Friday.  Yeah.  Wow, Friday's great.  Wow.  It's good size, nice.  It's like Jimmy's buying a car. 
[02:54:30]  It's like good size, I like it, it fits the whole family.  Oh, I like that.  I like the color.  Oh, that's really nice.  Oh, that's perfect, look at that.  Wow.  Where's your other hand?  What are you doing down there?  I'm holding Liddy, actually.  Yeah, he's got Liddy in his hand.  Liddy, what do you think of that vag?  Yeah, you know.  That'd be really nice.  Oh, yeah, you've got to lube up her... 
[02:55:00]  Oh, boy.  All right, now we've got problems.  Wow.  She is squirting a whole bunch of lube right on target.  Screw Andrea Yates, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let her have her fun.  Oh.  What kind of lube is that?  Wow.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy?  Jimmy's...  Wow.  It stays wet longer.  Jimmy's got to use a little...  He's sweating.  No, I'm not.  I just forgot to use the other one today.  I don't smell.  All right, what's going on over there, E-Rock? 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my God.  She's lubing up pretty good.  Hold on.  She's what?  She's lubing up pretty good.  Thank you, E-Lo.  Yeah, we know that.  Well, she's...  Well, when a girl puts lubricant on her vagina, it will tend to get slippery.  Eric Logan.  Where's Mackenzie?  Yeah, let's get Mackenzie in here.  Let's get Mackenzie in here.  Mackenzie in here.  Wow.  We have Friday, uh, topless and bottomless, and...  He's on the console with, uh...  With the sexy little thing in between the boobs and the badge just kind of hanging out there. 
[02:56:00]  We got the Liberator.  All set and ready to go.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Mackenzie's working her way in here.  Steve is getting her.  Steve keeps the video camera rolling, of course, at all times.  Oh, there's a little rotation going on.  Look at that.  Ooh, hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Holy, Toledo.  Hi.  Hey, Mackenzie.  How are you?  Huh?  What'd you say?  I said, I want to see her ass.  Oh, spin her around again.  All right, spin her back around.  That's great.  Back toward, uh, Mackenzie... 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, there you go.  MackenzieMack.com?  Yes.  I have a Cyberskin strap-on right here.  A Cyberskin strap-on?  Feel this.  Okay.  Feel that.  What do you think, Jimmy?  It feels like a real dick.  Could you hold my head and yell, suck it, and I'll tell you.  I'm kidding.  Well, let's...  Yeah, that's cool.  Well, she's, uh...  She's ready for that.  Ready for action.  We're going to put this on.  Yes.  All right, sure.  Yeah, can I?  Clothes come off. 
[02:57:00]  Strap-on goes on.  All right.  We got a nice, uh, little scene going on on the Liberator.  Isn't that cool?  Wow, that goes up your ass, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it goes in stages.  Yeah, I see.  It's like a little...  I'm just starting...  I lost my anal virginity, like, last week.  You did?  Thank you.  Wow.  It's very cool.  Friday, like, they gave me this one.  It's a dildo snowman, Anthony.  Grandpa give you money for that one?  Nice. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, I like this.  Does the tooth fairy come in and give you a quarter?  It's the ass fairy.  They leave a log under the pillow.  So this is easy.  You pop one in and you go, one, one anal bead.  Ah, ah, ah.  And then I wait.  You get it up here and then you pull them out.  Hey, Friday, you want to see how many you can take right now?  Okay.  I am not prepared.  Oh, you might have a...  So what?  Who's looking?  Put an anal plug inside for a few minutes.  What's up?  She needs to put an anal plug inside for a few minutes.  Yeah?  Sit there.  There's one outside.  And let it sit there? 
[02:58:00]  All right.  You might as well bring in a box of toys.  It looks like we're going to use a lot of them.  Mackenzie, why don't you start plugging away?  Because so far you've been the coolest...  Well, both of you girls have been the coolest girls we've had on the XM show.  Like, these girls know what we're looking for.  Exactly.  Now she's getting under us.  Yeah, that's the Liberator.  I like it.  Yeah, the Liberator rocks.  We love the Liberator.  Liberator, Liberator, Liberator.  Dog, dog.  The Liberator has taken the places where he's been laughing.  Yeah, Ben's like...  Yeah, there's plenty of lube here. 
[02:58:30]  Kiwi, strawberry, cherry.  All right, someone's going to have to take control here.  Flavored lube?  I think Steve, right?  Yes, take control, Steve.  I will direct.  Oh, my God.  I'm taking off my shoes.  What?  You're out of video?  No, he got me one that had stuff on it.  Oh, we need a fresh clean tape.  Don't take over the Aussie stuff, Scooby.  What the hell is that?  That looks like it would do some major damage.  The blackjack.  Keith, what is that?  Keith uses that up in the Bronx.  I'm pretty sure I've hit some people with this. 
[02:59:00]  Like a cattle prod.  What is that?  That's another type of pure power.  That's for hitting the G-spot.  Lex O-pleaser.  I think that's for hitting the kidney.  Is that...  Jesus.  I never knew yet.  Pancreas was a G-spot.  You're rubbing the kidney from the inside.  Oh, need batteries.  All right.  Cyber skin.  There you go.  Help me.  All right, let's see.  Let me try to figure out what's going on here.  McKenzie Mack from McKenzieMack.com.  I already see a problem.  A lesbian. 
[02:59:30]  I already see a problem.  Wait, you have to take the bottoms off.  McKenzie, you have to take the bottoms off so we can see.  Is putting on the cyber what?  Oh.  The cyber...  Basically the strap on.  We like total nudity.  Totally new.  I've been touched too many times for me to put it on my pussy.  Sorry.  Oh, she's worried about the thing going against her pussy.  That's dirty.  Well, because everyone in the room has been touching me.  Hygiene first, everybody.  Will you still show us when you're done?  Of course.  When it comes to hardcore porn, hygiene first always.  That's fair.  Yeah.  Strap on.  Just to be topless.  Yeah, the shirts. 
[03:00:00]  Who's into the scene?  It just always looks ridiculous.  I like it, though.  The big dildo.  Like the big strap on.  Great.  Oh, my gosh.  You like that ass, Jimmy?  Yeah, the ass is...  She has to show the whole thing after.  Because you're going crazy.  It's so not straight.  It's so not straight.  It's big.  It's great.  It's like she's got mountain climbing gear.  All right.  Look at that.  She has the strap on on.  Twitching it around.  Friday's on the Liberator.  Do we really need the top?  No. 
[03:00:30]  Danny.com.  Wow.  Girls courtesy of Danny.com.  D-A-N-N-I.com.  And let's not forget MackenzieMack.com.  Let's not.  As she gets topless.  Over 2,000 models on Danny.com.  Any major porn star that you're looking for, that's the one.  There are no men on Danny.com.  Danny.com.  Okay.  Danny.  How about a strap on?  All right.  All right.  Wait.  Do we have the little postcards?  Just throw this bra at him. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  You better just throw that bra at him.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Look at that.  On the console.  She's lovely.  Wow.  Wow.  Friday's.  How are we going to do this Deliberator?  Let's see.  Oh, you'll have fun.  Well, here.  We'll explain how you do it.  Yeah.  We've got all kinds of scenarios.  Hold on, guys.  Do you want to see Rock the Boat?  Cupid's Arrow?  Any?  I think we start with the old fucking.  What is that?  What is that thing?  What is that thing called? 
[03:01:30]  I think that's a kid's toy that's got into the studio somehow.  She's one of Jimmy's dates.  What is that?  It's just dope.  You can use it in the fucking shower.  Wait.  We've got to get the girl from MySexyStore.com.  Is that a glow worm or something?  She's coming in.  She's coming in.  Put it on your panties.  What the hell is that?  Oh, she's in the producer's studio.  It's Moby Worm coming to get you.  Moby Worm is in her hand coming to get her.  What is that?  This is a waterproof worm, and you can take it, like, showers, bathtub, whatever. 
[03:02:00]  Really?  Two settings.  It also took you up the ass.  Can you drown five children while you pleasure yourself with that?  Exactly.  All right.  Well, we got, wow.  Explain that, Anthony.  It looks like a glow worm toy.  No, I don't care about that.  I mean, explain what is going on here with Friday bent completely over the liberator.  She's bent over the liberator, yeah, on her elbows, ass perched in the air.  And she's getting worked over with this jackhammer. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, can we get another mic on Friday?  It's a worm.  Wait, we want two mics, guys.  We need a mic on the area, and we need a mic on Friday.  That's how we do radio.  Let's go.  Oops.  It's all right.  Thanks.  Oh, look at the big plastic dick is falling over.  Why are we bringing a lighter into this situation?  Oh, it's batteries.  Okay.  Batteries, right.  It looks like a lighter.  Will you hold my worm?  Oh.  Oh, Ben, she wants you to hold her worm. 
[03:03:00]  I don't hold worms.  Hey, Steve, look this way.  Yeah.  Smile.  I think those panties need to come off.  And I think, yeah, they ought to get going to town.  Who's the other girl taking pictures of this whole thing?  Who are you?  The Liberator.  Oh.  The girl from the Liberator.  Hey.  Taking pictures to bring back to the office.  Oh, and Friday's panties have come down.  Oh, yes, they have.  There they are.  That bottom is completely naked and ready to accept whatever might come across it. 
[03:03:30]  Or come out of it.  All right, Mackenzie.  Mackenzie's got the strap on.  M-A-C-K dot com.  You got some lube?  M-A-C-K-E-N-Z-I-E.  You got the lube?  There's the lube.  Wait, we're going to spray some lube on the area there.  A little more lube.  There you go.  Mackenzie checking out the lube, making sure it's pouring it on her strap-on.  Lube it up.  Yeah, jerk that thing.  Are we getting another, like, we need to mic her still, no? 
[03:04:00]  Can Mars do that, or is that a...  No?  All right.  There you go.  Want to move the Liberator over?  How about we do that?  Guys, really fast.  Just move the whole sex scene over.  Yeah, move it closer so no one can see.  That's good.  Well, I'm trying to mic her, though, for the radio.  All right, well, here's Mars.  Yeah, her, yeah.  Huh?  Turn it off?  All right.  Oops.  Turned off the wrong one, I think.  Ah.  I don't know what...  Oh, whatever.  Heard a snap.  Am I on?  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy, which one you are? 
[03:04:30]  I have to see her uphand at the end.  Don't worry, Jimmy.  Don't worry, Jimmy.  You'll get to see...  It's big.  That's for cleaning up the paper towels.  Did I say MackenzieMack.com?  Yes.  All right, very good.  We can say it again, though.  MackenzieMack.com.  Yes, Jimmy?  She's sexy.  I can do it like this.  These girls are very, very sexy.  You could do it like that, and she could kind of back into it.  All right, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Wow.  Hold on, wait.  We've got to get the mic first.  Oh, you fucking tease.  There's going to be a...  He was just ready to squat on it. 
[03:05:00]  I know, but there's going to be a really nice reaction when that happens.  Hold on.  Just keep teasing there, Friday.  Just keep backing up and then moving forward, backing up, moving forward.  There you go.  Get a little teasing going.  Wow.  That's close.  Hold on.  Rubbing the dildo on it.  We're almost ready, Ant.  Oh, my God.  They're...  All right, we're on.  Okay, let's mic Friday.  We're going here.  And Mackenzie's mic.  I got lube.  There's lube all over the place.  She's wiping off her legs.  Oh, she's on it.  Can I sit on it now?  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  Whatever you want to do.  Go ahead.  It's going.  I'm going to hold it.  There we go.  Stick.  There we go.  Stick.  Stick.  Stick.  Stick.  Stick.  Stick.  Slowly but surely.  Does that feel good, like Cyberskin?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It feels like a real cup.  I'm so good.  Like a really good chair. 
[03:06:00]  I like it.  Oh, my God.  You fuck good.  How come it got all quiet, guys?  What?  What?  Whatever.  What the fuck?  Keep fucking me, Mackenzie.  Keep going.  La, la, la.  This is like the best view ever.  I wish I was a dude.  Oh, my God.  Is this what you guys do?  Yeah.  I want to watch it.  Yeah.  Exciting.  Wow. 
[03:06:30]  Where's my anal beads?  Does it feel like a real dick?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I love this Danny.com.  D-A-N-N-I.com.  Dildo.  Oh, speaking of .coms, you can go to Ticketmaster.com and get tickets for my Cleveland show.  They went on sale a little while ago.  You are the worst.  That proves that you are the worst.  We got plugging going on over here.  Jesus, we don't need your plug.  This thing looks so neat.  Oh, dude, it's July 23rd, but no one cares.  You're taking this home, right?  About them.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're coming over to my house later, right? 
[03:07:00]  We can use this in Hollywood.  Let's do it.  You know what?  That's very sexy, very hot, but you're being very chick-like.  You know what you got to do?  Yeah.  You got to stand up, get her on the edge, and just fuck her like you're a guy.  Just.  We were just playing it.  Oh, I understand.  All of our foreplay.  But, you know, we're about moving along, using the Liberator in different ways.  So now just doggy style it.  Yeah, you know.  Just doggy style.  Mackenzie Mack.  Yeah.  Here you go.  I got an illustration. 
[03:07:30]  Let's try that one out.  This is called the Bandit, the Bum Bandit.  That's right.  Let's try the Bum Bandit on the Liberator.  They like that.  Yes, they like that.  There's the picture.  That's the picture we want you girls in.  Put your ass this way, though.  You guys want to see maybe the toe curler?  Which ones do you want to see here?  I want to see the Bum Bandit first.  Yeah, let's do the Bum Bandit.  Oh, she's smacking her ass with the rubber dick.  It's a cyber dick.  I'll say.  What do you think, Mackenzie?  Getting behind her. 
[03:08:00]  Getting in position.  Have you ever affected a chick before, like this, Mackenzie?  I have.  On Monday, I did it all good.  See?  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Now she's coming to some fucking.  Oh, I feel that one, Jamie.  Yes, huh?  That's good, right?  Your penis fell out.  It did fall out.  It fell out.  No, that's my butt.  I'm sorry. 
[03:08:30]  Ah, haven't we all heard that?  Don't worry.  I would have figured that one out there.  I'm fucking Jimmy.  I tried to get one in.  Sorry.  You've got to try, you know.  We understand.  How many times have you guys heard that one?  Wait, that's my butt.  There, thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:09:00]  I'm too short.  What?  Oh, yes.  She's really giving it to her.  Nice movement.  Excellent hip movement by McKenzie.  Yeah.  Giving her a great fucking.  Yeah.  I like it.  See if it comes, batteries are dead in this camera.  They just aren't dead.  Good time for your batteries to die, Keith.  If you want. 
[03:09:30]  Ooh.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yes.  That was my clip.  Yeah, yeah.  Is there some sort of vibrator in that box or what?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  Mm.  Ah.  Isn't this what a satellite radio is all about?  That was good when you pulled out.  What about that?  Oh, she liked that.  Okay.  All right, yeah, let's get a little combo thing going here now.  Combo?  Yeah, you got that going and then the vibrator on the old.  Holy crap.  Oh, good idea.  Old.  Good idea.  She's spinning around.  Thank you.  There you go. 
[03:10:00]  Wow, there's a view.  Aim that camera, Steve.  I'll punch you.  Here, get that thing working.  Yeah, let's get that thing.  The green worm, right?  You invented the green worm.  You working yourself, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's good, isn't it?  Yes.  You're really making a short work of these sex toys.  Oh, that's the low setting.  That's what?  That's the low setting.  Oh.  It gets even hotter.  Oh, oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, nice.  That's funny.  Is it too hot?  Oh, shoot. 
[03:11:00]  It slipped out.  Oh.  Wow.  I thought it was ready to...  What was that Yates audio you had?  I did a new position.  It really sucks it up.  New position, please.  My goodness.  Don't fall, lovey.  What are you doing?  What?  I have to fall.  I'm going to go this way, and you can sit on it.  How about that?  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Now Mackenzie is switching.  She's sitting down.  Oh.  I've been wiping this off.  Yeah.  You want to try back that ass up? 
[03:11:30]  We could try that one.  Well, now she's laying down, so you've got to go with something that's similar to that  position.  Well, I know.  Like surfs up.  Oh, yeah.  Surf's up might work.  Here.  Why don't you give the girls the postcard, see which one they want to try.  Which one you girls want to try?  There's all your choices.  What is it?  Name.  Oh, pictures?  Yeah.  Which one you want to try?  Oh, okay.  Which one looks good?  She can do this one right now.  Which one is it?  Exhibit A?  No, what's it called?  Surf's up.  Oh, there's names. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, surf's up.  Surf's up.  The guy, played by Mackenzie Mack, from mckenziemack.com, lays on her back.  We can also do this one.  And Friday kind of goes, just backs her ass up.  And we can also do ride the swell.  Ride the swell you like, too?  Uh-huh.  All right.  All right.  Okay, I'm just going to hold it up here.  All right, yeah, you hold that up.  Well, you guys tell me, so when you guys get hard, is it like that, or is it like that?  Because, yeah, I'm a lesbian porn star.  I wouldn't know.  Hello. 
[03:12:30]  Hi.  I'm Mackenzie.  Oh, you don't like guys at all?  Oh, I like guys just fine.  But your thing is to do lesbian porn?  Yeah.  I got you.  I do guys in the bedroom at my house.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Or someone else's bedroom.  All right, Friday has prepared the area, Anthony.  Yes.  And she's now backing up into this as Mackenzie's on her back.  Wait, what does the picture look like?  What am I doing?  This is just like calling a golf match, Anthony.  Oh, it's a golf match.  Yeah.  Well, Mackenzie is laying on the rounded part of the Liberator, arching her back. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Puts her in position.  The Liberator, officially our favorite sponsor.  Yeah.  The camera should seriously be over here.  Yeah.  What are you doing, Steve?  Yeah, Steve, Jesus.  Stupid Steve.  The hell was he trying to film?  This is a Danny.  Isn't it feel great?  Yes.  It's soft.  It's not like that hard.  It's called Cyber Skin, supposedly.  All right.  Why don't we get another toy involved for Friday's pleasure there, too? 
[03:13:30]  This one doesn't look like Friday's too comfortable.  She can have a stimulator, too.  Here, Friday, we'll give you your own toy to do what you please.  Oh, what's that one?  That's so hard to reach places.  It's like on the end of a stick.  Oh, yeah.  Hello.  Let's keep going.  I knew exactly where it was.  It's going to be fun for both of us.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Friday's straddling Mackenzie.  How cute is this?  This is hot.  The goal is to get an orgasm out of this, ladies.  Just to let you know.  Looks like Steve and Ben working out their problems.  Let's turn you around.  Do you want me around?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Steve is filming her ear.  Good one, Steve.  What are you doing, fucking David Lynch?  He's filming it, not Lynch. 
[03:14:30]  What is this?  Isn't that good?  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  Like that?  Steve's the Pablo Picasso of porn.  Jesus.  This is her knee while she's coming up.  Right, right.  Anyone could get the pussy.  Jesus.  Sounds like a landscaper.  Yeah.  Sounds like a Mexican outside your house as you're enjoying the A.C.  She's going to come in soon and ask for iced tea and rob us.  Whoa, hey. 
[03:15:00]  Turn around and ride me, baby.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the old strap-on dildo blowjob.  That's nice, though.  Shows technique.  Yeah.  And hers is good.  It's where she's holding the build-up slash pinch.  She's tasting herself.  I don't know.  All I see is the back of a hat.  I can't... 
[03:15:30]  Oh, there we go.  I'm wondering why Carmine Raguso is sitting here.  Wow.  She has very good technique.  She gets deep, too.  I like it.  She's really hot.  She's really good at this.  I'll say.  I would tend to think she's done that a couple of times.  Yeah.  That was deep throat right there.  That was good.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:16:00]  What is that, nine inches?  Wow.  Friday, could you just say, do you like this, Daddy?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Show her up.  Wow.  This is beautiful.  Should we go for the grand finale or what?  What the hell is that?  We all rip our clothes off.  I'm ready. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, I know what to do with, what?  Seven men at one time?  One, two, three, four.  I'm just teasing, I don't.  They don't know what to do with us, though.  I say we go for an old orgasm there for the listeners all over the country.  All right.  You first.  Give it a try.  Yeah, right?  Start jacking off.  What do you think?  Who wants to have an orgasm live on the radio today?  Mackenzie?  I thought we both did.  Or Friday?  They're working on it.  Yeah, I know.  I got the strap-on on.  It's not going to be too hard with this thing. 
[03:17:00]  I don't know when it is, but can I take it home?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Can I get some applause or some sort of like?  Oh, yeah, you can.  Yes.  Oh. 
[03:17:30]  The pen is awesome.  The pen is awesome.  The pen has already moved to the side.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't you straddle her now?  Yeah.  Do that move.  Let me see that.  She wanted you to face her.  Yeah.  Face me.  Yeah.  Face me.  And hop aboard.  Climb aboard.  She's like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to work good.  Okay.  Ooh.  Still lubed up enough or you need a little more squirt on there?  Oh. 
[03:18:00]  We got Frotty on top now.  Very nice.  Mackenzie on her back.  They're working it in.  A little jiggle jiggle.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
[03:18:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, please.  Wait, no, you're doing a little spot here.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  She just fell right off the liberator. 
[03:19:30]  Just like real life.  Wonderful.  As soon as you're done, off.  Wow.  She definitely enjoyed herself.  The band has been lifting from the Opie and Anthony program.  You want to keep that?  You can keep whatever you want there, Mackenzie.  I broke it.  Oh, no.  Got too wet.  We broke it.  You broke that vibrator? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Can you fix it?  I don't know what I did, but that was awesome.  Yeah?  Wow, man.  That is something.  That was a good work.  Thank you.  Good job.  Who's next?  Thank you.  Wow.  I don't even know what to say.  Can you hear Opie?  All right.  So it's MackenzieMack.com, right?  Yes, it is.  And there you can see a bunch of lesbian shit.  And Steve did a lot of video that he'll be selling for $19.95 on the corner 57th and 
[03:20:30]  7th after the show.  Also, Friday.  PartyOnFriday.net, right?  It's like Friday.  Yes.  Buy my scent of a whore.  Yes.  Scent of a whore.  Yeah.  It smells good.  Did you guys smell that?  Yeah, it's not.  Of course.  It smells like a whore.  Yeah.  It smells good.  It's very whore-like.  Yeah.  It's a ceremony.  And the beautiful girls are courtesy of Danny.com.  D-A-N-N-I.com.  I love Danny-ish, man.  She's so fucking sexy.  Now the girls are just kind of tongue-in' each other. 
[03:21:00]  Very nice.  Kissing.  Yay.  Gentle.  Gentle kissing.  McKenzie, you might have a video in here or something?  I sure do.  It's going to be right there in my purse.  Yeah, what's your video?  It's from Danny's special Latina version, and I'm on the bonus feature with Alexis Amor.  And it's good old lesbian stuff.  I don't think we're using too much toys, but I think it's really oral.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of licking.  A lot of licking.  Finger licking good. 
[03:21:30]  Sucking.  Nice.  Jimmy's taking that.  Or you can go to dhdrdanny.com.  Let's go to David in Ohio.  David.  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  What's up, David?  Hi, little Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, a couple things.  First of all, little Jimmy should have been thanking one of these naughty little girls at  some point.  And the other thing, I'd like to hear Liddy talk dirty to one of them. 
[03:22:00]  I don't know.  Not Liddy.  I don't think you're going to hear that.  Yeah.  Not Liddy.  Jimmy, you want to spank one of the girls, or?  I don't know.  You shy?  I'm really shy.  Oh, please.  All right.  There's no shyness around here.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  So we got Mackenzie.  Who wants to get the spanking?  Mackenzie or Friday?  Is it going to be hard?  No.  You don't like it?  Whatever you want.  No, it's good.  You have to remove the penis, though.  It's going to be too tempting. 
[03:22:30]  You want to remove it for me?  Yeah.  There's a clasp there.  Well, that came right off.  That was a beginner's look.  No, it's a clasp there.  I know he wants to remove the tick.  And it just kind of...  Because now she can take the panties off.  Can you hold that?  No, we'll just leave it there in my seat.  Stand it up.  So I can sit down, quote, unquote.  Yeah, we'd better take the panties off.  I'll be nice.  Oh, my gosh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes, I am.  Oh, totally shaved.  No, I won't go. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, well, I laser it off, actually.  You laser it off.  So I have to let it grow a little bit, and then we'll laser off.  Laser?  Yeah.  Does that hurt?  Hell, yeah.  But no pain, no gain, right?  And then what?  It just doesn't grow back?  Not for two years.  For two years?  Isn't there permanent laser they can do?  Yeah, they can.  But maybe one day I'll want to race things, whatever you call it.  Yeah.  You know, one day a landing strip?  Sure, a little variety.  One day a triangle?  A big M for Mackenzie?  Cool. 
[03:23:30]  A big O for orgasm?  Hey, want a lap dance?  Okay.  Oh.  Wow.  Thanks.  Rinding away on Jimmy.  She's really a very, very pretty girl.  Well, I like her a lot.  No, are you spanking, or what?  Oh, no, I'm sitting here enjoying.  I can't spank from this position, because your hiding is too close.  You don't ever say you can't spank from this position.  You can spank from any position.  That's right.  That's a can-do attitude.  Now, look at her.  That's the attitude this country was built on.  Wonderful.  Oh, oh. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, you got a kiss in that one.  But I was nice.  I didn't do it dirty.  That was a pleasant little...  Yeah, if you would have slobbered, I might have hit you with this.  I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't slobber.  I'm a nice guy.  Like a vibrator between his legs.  All right, are we going to get a little spank going?  She's doing something, so I'm not going to interrupt her.  All right.  There you go.  Spank her while she uses the vibrator.  Ow!  How about we mic her?  Ow!  Fellas.  There we go.  You have to mic the hiney, too.  You got the hiney mic there.  You kind of hear that.  Ow!  Friday. 
[03:24:30]  You're next.  Is that too rough?  I think I have a print on my ass.  Yeah, you do.  I didn't need a heart, either.  Sorry.  I apologize.  Wow, that's red.  Turn around.  Look at little Jimmy's handprint on her butt.  I really didn't mean to do it hard.  Oh, my God.  I didn't do it that hard.  I just can't help it.  I'm a little fella.  Totally got his handprint on your ass.  Wow, she's just so much naughty.  Well, people are calling in, and they just want to tell everyone where they're dropping their  loads today.  John on Long Island.  Yes, John.  Where, John? 
[03:25:00]  Go ahead, John.  Hey, what's up, man?  I just dropped my load on the cross-bronks.  That is a sick shit.  He lost his load on the cross-bronks, Anthony.  That's our new radio bit.  Leave it on the side of the road.  Some Puerto Ricans will steal it, you.  Call in and tell us where you lost your load on the O.B. to Anthony program.  Pat from Omaha.  What's up, Pat?  Hey, man.  It's awfully hard to drive an 18-wheeler while you're beating your meat and cleaning the fucking  mess up afterwards.  Well, good luck to you.  Hey, I got a new-  I need to mess up out there.  Hey, I got a new-  Hey, I got a new-  I need to mess up out there. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, I got a new-  I need to mess up out there.  Hey, I got a new-  Hey, I got a new-  Jim in Tennessee.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, guys.  I drive a tour bus, and I bought one of these XM radios three months ago.  Yeah.  And I'm a hollering group of people, and they can't see the earbuds in my ear.  I'm driving along, and I'm just laughing for no reason at all.  It scared the shit out of these people.  You look like a mental patient.  Yeah, this is some of the best money I've ever spent.  Oh, right on.  And it's really hard to holler group of people when you're dead. 
[03:26:00]  It's hard to listen to these girls eat each other.  Dude, they're so hot, both of them.  They really are sexy.  We'll have pictures up on opiananthony.com later this weekend or later tonight.  I really enjoy the hell out of your show.  I'll punch it out.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, Tom from Ohio.  Yes, Tom?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering if you guys could turn me on to any of the tech guys around here and tell me  how to get a load out of a Sky-Fi.  Get the load off the Sky-Fi?  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  This is the greatest, these two. 
[03:26:30]  The best.  Unbelievable, actually.  They're both fantastic.  Friday looks all bored because no one's paying attention to her in the corner.  No, I'm done.  She just nutted.  She's rested.  Yeah.  She busted one, so she's resting.  She's just like trying to come back to reality, right?  All right.  Very good.  Should we take a break, I guess?  No.  I'm in love with Mackenzie's beauty.  She's absolutely great.  She's fantastic.  You guys think you could work up one last thing before we get out of here for the weekend?  We only have like 10 minutes left on the show.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:27:00]  What do you want?  Maybe you guys go huddle and try to figure something out?  You huddle, you huddle, huddle, huddle.  Where's that whipped cream?  Oh, there you go.  There's a taste for you.  Dirk, get us out of here.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[03:27:30]  Turn his mic on.  Turn Jimmy's mic on.  It's on now, right?  I don't know.  It was just my first time ever bringing the show back in completely.  I know, and nothing. 
[03:28:00]  Had to be fucked up.  All excited.  Welcome everybody back to Norton and Friends.  He was right, and he couldn't because his mic wasn't on.  Because E-Rock, once again, fucked it all up.  I told you.  See, I wasn't lying earlier.  I'll tell you, Lauren.  I'm a little raring to go.  I know.  Eager.  Yeah, you can bring that home with you.  They're claiming their toys.  So what do we got going on?  They have some kind of special whipped cream type stuff?  Yeah, it's called Cloud Nine, and it's aphrodisiac whipped four-plate cream. 
[03:28:30]  Because you should have heard the conversation that was going on in here before you came back in, L.P.  It was Steve trying to negotiate another deal with all the girls, and it's hysterical.  What was he saying?  He's like, um, could you, um, would it be okay if, you know, all the stories I've heard of Steve's negotiation,  I thought he was, like, hard at negotiating, but he's, like, he's all embarrassed.  He's like, if we, like, if you bend over this and we, like, spread you apart and put, you know,  a little whipped cream on your ass crack and then throw cherries at it, would that be okay? 
[03:29:00]  And then she wasn't into the whipped cream thing because, for some reason, I guess the sugar causes some kind of bladder infection.  So, uh, they have some special cream that's just made for this.  All right.  And Jimmy's brewing it up in his pants right now.  That's right.  It's called the weight loss cream.  Those, um, never put real whipped cream on your, on your vaginal region.  No?  No.  Wow.  It's, it's bad.  Wow.  Who knew?  What happened?  It gives you a bladder infection? 
[03:29:30]  Bladder infections and urinary tract infections.  Why is that?  Because it's got the sugar in it.  What does sugar do?  Oh, here you go.  Bad stuff?  What is that?  That's awful.  You don't like it?  You're going to be honest.  It tastes like shit.  It comes in, like, a moose can or something.  It doesn't actually taste bad.  Right?  No, it tastes like apples.  Tastes like apples?  You don't like apples?  Rotten apples.  Tastes like chicken.  Creamy applesauce.  Okay.  Where am I putting this?  Upper butt?  Upper butt. 
[03:30:00]  I like that.  Way to be matter-of-fact.  Yeah.  All right.  Where is it going?  All right.  What are we doing here, ladies?  How do you want to sit them up?  Nanny, nanny, nanny.  I don't think they're going to...  Oh, well, we're completely naked again.  They're on the liberator.  Yeah, Mackenzie, the panties are off again.  Mackenzie's inspecting her area, making sure she's okay with this.  Now, Friday is putting on the apple stuff.  Wow.  I don't even know what it's called.  What is it?  Apple...  Apple Tart Sensual Cream.  Apple Tart Sensual... 
[03:30:30]  Her privates look just like Steve's head.  Are you sure this can go on your back?  In the way?  Oh, there you go.  Oh, all right.  I was like...  I didn't see that Steve's head was in there.  It's not coming out, huh?  Uh-oh.  You got to shake it?  Oh, she makes it work.  Can you make it work again?  Okay, here you go.  Go, Robin.  That's the girl from MySexyStore.com getting into the action.  It's green, guys.  Is it coming out?  Mackenzie broke it.  Uh-oh. 
[03:31:00]  Much like I broke every toy in the box today.  I know you did.  Oh, it's loud.  Try jerking on the can a little.  I tried to get the gnaws out of it.  Oh, she broke it.  Yeah.  Steve, what's going on?  She broke it.  It's busted.  Candy, that's your second thing you've broken in here.  It's busted.  I like to explore.  That's it.  Then just put cherries on it.  I hear if you put a lighter under that can, it might come out.  She busted my crack.  Oh, those are...  Oh.  Well, now we don't have any whipped cream or anything. 
[03:31:30]  She broke the vibrator.  Hmm.  No, we fixed the vibrator.  The batteries just come out.  That's it.  Yeah, I think we got one more orgasm in us here.  We do?  He really wants it to come out.  Like, Steve's muscling it out of the can.  It's just drooling out of the can.  It's nothing.  There's nothing going on there.  It looks like the fifth money shot of the day.  I hope you guys' loads don't look like that.  No.  Give me a new toy.  Yeah, that shit's green. 
[03:32:00]  Looks like a load from a kidney patient.  Not right now.  No one's into the anal intrusion yet.  I'm not getting paid that much.  Not at this hour.  I don't think that's on.  What's that?  What happened?  One porn star had really long fake nails, and she shoved it in my ass, and then she gave  it a little twist and a little angle, and then yanked it out and cut my butt.  Isn't that a bitch?  Oh, that's so cute.  You get workman's confidence?  That's the biggest butt plug I've ever seen in my life.  Isn't that huge? 
[03:32:30]  It's the size of a beer can.  That's crazy.  All right, they're going through the box, Anthony.  Who would put that in their ass?  They're trying to find something they could use.  This is a nine-inch dong.  Yeah.  That's a real big dildo.  It doesn't do shit.  No.  I want it to dance or something.  It's just gazinia.  Yeah, you get...  It's just like Christmas morning.  You see that?  She's opening up her present.  Opening up.  Smiling it.  Oh, she's putting it near Jim.  Making it look like a Jimmy's dick.  Oh.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, that's so cute. 
[03:33:00]  She's, uh...  Nice.  Now, that picture's funny.  Yeah.  That'll be a funny picture later tonight on opnet3.com.  Yeah, pop that one up.  Sure.  The fake penis on Jimmy, and she's on her knees, and she did her thing.  Uh-uh, I'm going to break it.  That one's hard plastic.  All right.  Guys, we're running out of show here, so...  Mackenzie spit on him now.  We always like to end with a nice big grand finale.  I don't know.  I just spit on him.  You guys have been unbelievable so far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're looking for one last thing.  Oh, she's going to work herself with the, uh... 
[03:33:30]  You need a little lube.  Grab that girl some lube.  Yeah, let me give her the lube.  Mackenzie's going to try now a little.  Let me give her the lube.  No, come in.  No.  Oh, you have to help me.  Yeah, she wants help.  She wants help.  All right.  We've got Mackenzie.  We've got Mackenzie.  Friday's now going to help Mackenzie.  Mackenzie's, uh, straddling her.  She's actually laying back on the Liberator.  And, uh, Friday is right in front of her.  She's putting the dildo in her mouth.  It's the drippy dildo.  She's screwing her with the dildo that's in her mouth.  Wow.  And again, I just see the Foundry Music logo on the back of Steve's shirt. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Steve's, uh, videotaping the whole thing for later today.  I don't know what he's going to be able to show.  I like this dong, you guys.  It's soft.  And it doesn't hurt.  And it doesn't smell like plastic.  Yeah.  Definitely doesn't smell like plastic now.  Oh, it's big.  Mm-hmm.  I have a tight pussy because I don't do men very often.  Oh, really?  So that, like, makes it, uh, stay small, huh?  Yeah, well, that's what I hear. 
[03:34:30]  It's just swallowing it.  It's swallowing it.  Give me more.  It's probably swallowing it.  Ah!  Mm.  That's good.  Ah!  Oh, babe.  Ah, it's talking about.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's good.  She's good at this.  Not even using her hands, huh, guys?  Mm-mm.  She's got the dildo in her mouth.  Who gave me this?  Oh, we thought you might need a little help.  That's all.  There you go. 
[03:35:00]  Mm-mm.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Is that so good?  Love it.  Is that so good?  It's perfect.  Mm-mm.  Isn't it perfect?  July 23rd.  Can I keep this one, too?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tickets on sale at 10 a.m. this morning.  That's good.  That's good.  Is it that's good?  Yeah.  I don't have all your attention, stupid asses.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I don't even need this thing. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, I got blocked.  I want a picture of this, guys.  Me, too.  It's so good.  Trust me.  I'm going to hold my hair back.  Someone hold her hair back.  For Pete's sake, someone help her.  Hold her hair back.  There you go.  Come on.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:36:00]  There you are, nameless cameraman.  Oh, God.  They told me to do it.  I had to, honey.  I didn't.  Oh, God.  I have a pair of pair of pair of pair of pair of pair.  I'm going to be asking this question.  Did you ever hold a girl's hair back when she ate a vagina?  Weren't you once holding a girl's hair back?  I'm going to settle.  While she had a dildo in her mouth. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well.  Jimmy's getting an up-close view now.  That's really nice.  What kind of gadgetry going on?  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Wonderful.  You're so good at that, Friday.  With your mouth, I can't believe it.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Oh, what happened?  Is this it?  No.  Not at all.  I think it can go deeper.  Do you want? 
[03:37:00]  No, I don't want to.  A dragnet moment.  It's like flawless.  Deeper.  You guys, it's all the way right here and me.  Seriously.  I don't know.  It's pointing at her belly button.  Yeah.  These are pretty girls.  Oh, that's so good.  I don't think I've ever seen Derek stand up before.  Maybe everybody pays attention in there.  Yeah.  We want coffee. 
[03:37:30]  No one knows nothing.  Yeah.  Now they're all standing up looking very attentive.  Oh, that's pretty deep.  Oh, that's so good.  Wasn't she deep?  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  I saw she did it.  Oh, I like that.  Oh, there's people here.  I like how she sounds with a dildo in her mouth. 
[03:38:00]  It's like watching someone with Down syndrome.  Oh, she got laughing at me.  She's all that good.  I love it.  She's like gagging a little bit.  Oh, you almost gagged.  That was great.  I was.  She was in the back a little bit on my tongue.  Did you see that gag thing she did a little bit?  That was pretty good.  I've just never seen a girl do that with mine, so it's fun to watch.  Shit.  Now you're cooking.  It's like nasty. 
[03:38:30]  I'm sorry.  I don't recommend eating this premium body glide, but it stays wet longer, of course.  It's not meant for eating.  It's just meant for fucking.  Oh, I do like to eat lube, though.  It's good for you.  Yeah?  Well, we should have used the flavored one.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda, right?  Wow, wow, wow.  Actually, it still tastes like plastic.  These were the two most phenomenal guests so far.  Absolutely.  Thanks for having us, guys.  Thank you for coming.  Oh, and cut it out.  And I'm sagging. 
[03:39:00]  Thanks for drinking my spit.  Oh, thank you for providing some.  That was really nice.  Yeah, you dirty bitch.  All right, let's, wow, let's make sure we get the plugs out, because everyone did a great  job today.  Oh, I thought you meant make sure they don't go home with anything in them.  Sorry.  I get confused.  The girls, courtesy of Danny.com, D-A-N-N-I.com, Mackenzie Mack.com.  How do you spell Mackenzie?  M-A-C-K-E-N-Z-I-E-M-A-C-K.com.

[03:43:00]  I'll make sure that they're up there by this evening.  Right.  And good stuff?  Yeah, I mean, there's certain stuff you've got to be careful with, especially now.  But I will make sure enough of it.  I was careful to...  Explosives?  What?  Yes.  What do you got to be careful with?  Certain shots are harder to put up in 2005 than they were, say, in 2002.  What is that?  Everyone's consenting adults, right?  Yeah.  Tell the government that.  So what's the problem with having...  I don't understand the problem.  Yeah.  Um, when you put stuff up and you allow everyone access to it, you have to be a little bit more...  A little bit more... 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, there's some very, very nasty, nasty restrictions that the government just instituted, like, the other day.  Motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Let us have our porn.  Do the child labor and stuff, like, apply because you dress like a baby?  Yes, it might.  Child labor laws.  Awful shorts.  He's not allowed to hold a camera for that long.  Gonna have another kid come in.  All right, Patty.  Thanks.  Yeah, great job, Patty.  Enjoy the butterfly.  Loosen up with it.  Have fun.

Yeah, that's what he's thinking, too.  You're just right for him.  He doesn't know why he exists.  I only met him once.  I got his blood to grab.  That was a joke, Patty.  Thank you.
