<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a singalong to "Sweet Caroline," immediately transitioning into a discussion of recent air show crashes, punctuated by news reports and listener accounts of near-misses and in-flight malfunctions.  This included a particularly dramatic 1986 helicopter news report where the reporter seemingly predicted an imminent crash before the audio cut out.  The conversation then pivoted to leaked audio of Pat O'Brien making sexually explicit and highly vulgar phone calls while intoxicated. Multiple unedited clips were played, prompting speculation about O'Brien's career, the legality of airing the recordings, and the identity and potential reaction of the woman on the receiving end. The hosts, along with their producer(s), debated the source of the audio clips.

This segment flowed into a heavier focus on the explicit Pat O'Brien voicemails, detailing graphic sexual descriptions, frequent use of vulgar language, and references to a woman named Betsy.  The hosts analyzed the calls, speculating about O'Brien’s drug and alcohol use, and his subsequent rehab admittance.  Rumors surrounding O’Brien, including allegations of racist and homophobic slurs and an attempted flirtation with Oprah Winfrey, were also discussed.  Listener calls and intern-created remixes of the voicemails further fueled the segment.  One caller unexpectedly sang a song about a banana phone.  The discussion concluded with commentary on O’Brien's appearances on *The Dr. Phil Show* and *The Insider*, specifically criticizing Lara Spencer's interview.

Following this, the show featured a comedic rendition of "Monster Mash," followed by XM Satellite Radio advertisements.  A significant prank call segment ensued, with Opie and Anthony impersonating Tony Danza to call a devoted fan, Joan.  The conversation escalated from discussing Danza's cooking to sexually explicit propositions involving oral sex backstage, further complicated by the involvement of a show employee nicknamed "Sex Bagel" (Eric), who attempted to convince Joan to participate, offering a large cash prize as incentive.  This prank call resulted in a confrontation with Tony Danza's security, leading to a humorous chase scene and speculation on Eric's fate.

This was followed by a "Wild Bill Production," a comedic critique of the "Than and Sam Show" on XM radio, focusing on Sam's accent, and featuring a mocking audio sketch of a fictional Steve and Bill spin-off.  The hosts discussed the production process, including creative differences and censorship issues. More XM Radio advertisements followed.

A segment featuring a poorly acted audio sketch by interns Steve C. and Bill followed, depicting a confrontation between Steve and his legal guardian (Bill), who is implied to be involved in the suspicious death of Steve's parents.  The hosts and other on-air personalities heavily criticized the acting, particularly Steve's performance, employing extremely vulgar language.  This transitioned into playing WWII-era anti-Japanese propaganda songs, sparking a discussion on racism and political correctness in media.  This jarringly shifted to audio of a man (Jimmy) using the restroom, prompting laughter and disgusted reactions from the hosts. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the restroom audio.

The broadcast continued with two intertwined segments. The first involved a malfunctioning earpiece, possibly contaminated with feces, leading to a humorous discussion about its sanitation.  This transitioned into the playing and discussion of songs by the fictional rapper "Gangsta Fag," whose music contained explicit lyrics detailing graphic sexual encounters, often involving violence and interracial themes.  Callers reacted with a mix of shock, disgust, amusement, and fear; the hosts and callers used numerous homophobic and racist slurs throughout this segment.  The hosts speculated about the rapper’s identity and potential reactions to his music.

The final segment centered on the fictional "Gangsta Fag" character, focusing on outrageous and violent prison anecdotes filled with graphic descriptions of sexual acts and violence.  Listeners called in with similar jokes and commentary.  The hosts made numerous homophobic and racist remarks and speculated on Gangsta Fag's origins, comparing him to Andrew Dice Clay in a homophobic parody.  Joe Rogan was mentioned as the source of the Gangsta Fag material. The show concluded with further sexually explicit jokes and commentary before the hosts expressed exhaustion and signed off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome y'all here tonight to the Halloween party.  Everybody knows this one, sing along.  Where it began, I can't begin to know it, but then I know it's going strong.  It was the spring, then spring became the summer, who'd have believed you'd come along. 
[00:00:30]  Everybody, hands, touching hands, reaching out, touching me, touching you. 
[00:01:00]  Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good.  I've been inclined to believe they never would.  But now I look at the night, look at the night, and it don't seem so lonely. 
[00:01:30]  We fill it up with only two.  And when I hurt, oh when I hurt, hurting runs off my shoulder.  How can I hurt when holding you?  Thank you ladies.  Warm.  Touching warm. 
[00:02:00]  Reaching out.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Everybody.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never seemed so good.  I've been inclined to believe they never would. 
[00:02:30]  Oh no, no.  An eight bar instrumental break.  How's everybody doing this evening?  Having a good time?  Are we drinking?  Are we having fun?  I say screw work.  Screw work.  Screw work.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never seemed so good.  Such a good.  Such a good.  Such a good.  Sweet Caroline. 
[00:03:00]  I believe they never would.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never seemed so good.  Such a good.  Such a good.  Such a good.  Yeah, I've been inclined.  Thank you.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it for Anthony.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You are listening to the worst.  Not the best. 
[00:03:30]  All of it is so bad it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  All right.  Anyway, a couple of the top stories today.  Yes.  We'll get into the Dennis the Menace thing in a minute.  But first, another air show disaster.  These happen all the time.  I saw it on the news.  Pretty brutal.  I guess they were having some reenactment of a dog fight. 
[00:04:00]  I think they were World War I planes.  Not sure.  Was it?  Yes.  I'm getting a thumbs up from Than.  And World War I planes.  It's really going back.  And then a couple of them crashed.  One of them landed.  But every year.  Every summer.  I know.  Every summer.  This is going on.  Yeah.  More than once, too.  You always see a pop-up on the news.  But people are fascinated by airplanes.  They love going to the air shows.  Do we get the AP cuts?  If we could.  No, we don't.  That one's kind of visual.  We. 
[00:04:30]  Okay.  That's what happened.  There's confusion in the studio.  You ever see the footage of the skydiver who hits the other skydiver?  And you can see the guy's legs get sawed off?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Brutal.  It's really unpleasant.  Yeah.  Then you had to land with no legs.  Oof.  The whole way down, just looking like, oh, shit.  Oh, I'm going to have to take care of this.  I've got no legs.  No legs.  And I'm still way up here.  Yeah.  Do you got them, Eric?  I'm going to have to run on my stumps as I hit the dirty ground.  That'll be good for a fact.  Oh, really? 
[00:05:00]  What do you do?  Lift your stumps up and land on your ass?  Try to keep the dirt out of your stumps?  I don't know.  Hopefully you don't land on asphalt.  Oh, can you imagine?  Stumps just scraping on hot asphalt.  Oh, Jesus.  I think any situation besides landing on a gurney with a doctor there is bad.  I don't think it matters what you hit with your stumps.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, we got some AP audio.  Let's listen to this first clip.  Go ahead.  I guess I'm shocked.  I'm saddened.  We had a wonderful afternoon here in Moose Jaw. 
[00:05:30]  We had a tremendous air show crowd out.  Okay.  Oat.  I guess that was the air show.  Tremendous air show crowd out.  That was the air show director speaking out on this latest crash, Anthony.  Tragedy hits Moose Jaw, huh?  Yeah.  Moose Jaw.  It was a civilian performance that has been practiced many, many times, done in a very  safe manner many, many times.  Basically, he's covering his ass so he doesn't understand why these planes collided.  Many, many times, eh? 
[00:06:00]  By the way, we had two different ones.  Yeah.  We had the one in Canada and then another one in Delaware.  Delaware.  Yeah, there were two air show disasters.  What happened there?  Well, let's go to the clip here.  And I thought, oh, wow, they've got some pretty dramatic pyrotechnics here, but no planes  flew out of the fireball.  It was just debris, and it was just, no way.  I looked around at the crowd, and everyone's just totally quiet, and we're just awestruck.  It was horrible.  Pyrotechnics.  And one guy starts to laugh, and we all just couldn't help ourselves. 
[00:06:30]  We laughed.  See, that would have been great.  Oh, one lousy guy in the stands just stands up and gives that crazy...  Oh, that's horrible.  Just one guy.  Why not?  You just stand up when that happens and just horrify everybody.  Wow.  Of course they were shocked.  Yeah.  What kind of planes? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, they were shocked, but they were still rolling.  Yeah.  With their video cameras.  What kind of planes in that one?  I don't know.  I watched that goddamn air disaster show also on Discovery or whatever the hell channel  it's on.  Oh, they're frightening.  This one was one of those Airbus 300s, and the pilot and co-pilot noticed a drop-off in  fuel in one of the tanks.  And they noticed this because the sensor said that there was more fuel in one tank than the  other, and it was imbalanced. 
[00:07:30]  So they're like, hmm, maybe there's a fuel leak.  And the pilot keeps going, no, I think it's a computer error.  I think it's a computer error.  Turns out they put this pump...  This is always how it happens.  They took the engine off, replaced it with another engine that didn't have this pump device in  it.  They put this pump device in that was almost identical to the one that was supposed to be  in there.  The only difference was some of the hydraulic lines rubbed on the fuel line in the engine  and wore a hole through it, and the fuel line just burst open. 
[00:08:00]  And now this thing is 35,000 feet up, leaking fuel out of the right engine.  So they decide to go over their checklist, and if the fuel is imbalanced, they open up  a switch that transfers fuel from the left tank now into the right tank, which is leaking  right out of the engine.  So instead of seeing if they had a leak, the pilot assumed it was computer error and just  started pumping the rest of their fuel supply right out the engine.  Oh, my God.  All the way until the co-pilot realized, through doing math on a pad, that they were out of 
[00:08:30]  fuel.  They were just out of fuel.  Declared a fuel emergency, and we're 35,000 feet up and about 90 miles away from an airport  when they completely ran out of fuel.  All of a sudden, lights go off in the aircraft.  And this is, you know, you're talking 300 people on this plane.  It's a huge plane.  How long ago was this?  92, 93?  93, around there somewhere?  So lights go off because now there's no power to anything. 
[00:09:00]  And you just, all of a sudden, you get through a flight, you kind of become oblivious to the  sounds of the engines.  If they're off, you just hear, people say you just hear the wind howling over the outside  of the fuselage in pitch blackness because it was nighttime also.  So it's just pitch black, wind, you're out of gas, 35,000 feet, 100 miles away from any  airport.  They had to land at some, or try to land at some airport in the Azores.  So I didn't know this either. 
[00:09:30]  When that happens, a little windmill device, this is what happens, pops out from underneath  the plane and powers a generator to give instruments and hydraulic power to the pilots.  So all that technology, and it all amounts to a little pinwheel, what amounts to a kid's  pinwheel pops out at the bottom of the plane to give them enough power just for instruments.  This guy set a record for the longest glide in a passenger airplane.  They actually landed on the runway at over 200 miles an hour, blowing eight tires, but put 
[00:10:00]  the thing down and not an injury to be found.  Oh, wow.  100 miles out.  Longest glide ever in a friggin' Airbus 300.  Oh, you know why they probably couldn't go out and check?  Maybe because it was night, they would have had that.  They had one of the, they had two of the flight assistants there look out the window  with flashlights, but couldn't see.  They said if it was daytime, you'd see a stream of fuel coming out of the plane.  I've seen that on a plane.  At night, you can't.  I was on a flight to Chicago one time. 
[00:10:30]  No, no, to Denver when I was doing a comedy festival in Vail.  I was afraid to fly.  Terrified to fly.  We were on United.  And they, I guess I'm like 20 minutes, I mean an hour into the flight, and he's like,  ladies and gentlemen, we're having a little problem with the fuel transfer.  We're unable to get it from the wing tanks into the main engine, however that works.  He's like, we're not going to make it to Colorado, but we do have enough to make it to Chicago.  But in order to get down to landing weight, we're going to have to dump the fuel in the 
[00:11:00]  wings that we can't get to the other tank, or vice versa.  All I know is, he said, if you look out the window, you will see fuel leaving the wings.  Oh, wow.  And I did, and you see fuel from the far wing tips firing out like a water gun.  Yeah.  I can't tell, it was white terror.  There's no description when you're afraid to fly, and you're in the air, and you see  fuel coming out of the wing.  And anything happens that's out of the ordinary.  On a flight, I want a takeoff, I want my meal, I want my drinks, I want a landing. 
[00:11:30]  That's it.  I want the most boring, uneventful flight.  That's what I yearn for.  I heard in, I don't know if this is true, somebody else might know, the air agent flight, which  everybody says was a suicide, and of course, you know, Muslims, they know it wasn't, because  Muslims don't kill themselves.  I heard that the guy in the air agent flight, they're going along, and he starts to slam  the plane down towards the ground at 30,000 feet.  The other pilot gets into the cockpit, they struggle, and because the plane is going so  fast, the pilot trying to save the plane cuts the engines, because they're going to be 
[00:12:00]  ripped off because of the, I guess, the G-force of going down.  And I heard that the plane wound up going all the way down, and as the air got thicker,  the wind took the plane back up with no engines.  Yeah.  And then it just went as far as it could and fell backwards.  Ooh.  Plummeted backwards.  Backwards.  Backwards.  Until everybody died from like 10,000 or 12,000 feet.  That's horrible.  Yeah, that's got to be hard to convince yourself here.  I don't know why I watch these things either.  I watch, you ever hear about something that happened on a UPS or FedEx flight, where one of the 
[00:12:30]  guys, you're allowed to find them.  FedEx.  It was FedEx.  It was FedEx?  And the guy got stranded on the island and had a ball.  And he had a ball.  And he had a ball.  A guy wanted to kill himself, got on board, had a ball-peen hammer with him, was flying  in the jump seat in the cockpit.  He was an employee.  He stands up when they reach the altitude and just pounds these guys over the head with  a ball-peen hammer.  And they were able to get out of their seats and wrestle this guy down, but then had to 
[00:13:00]  land the plane so fucked up with, I mean, skull fractures that were going into the guy's  brain where he was seeing four times what he was supposed to see.  It's all dizzy, sick, throwing up, and he landed the goddamn plane.  He had a concussion, right?  Oh, worse, yeah.  Just bleeding on the brain.  What a maniac.  Did they dock the other guy's pay?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think he'll be getting any more free flight stuff.  Why are you watching this stuff?  I hate watching it, but I can't.  As I'm switching by, you see the cockpit? 
[00:13:30]  You know, the guys are in there, and it's like, it's a little time code on the bottom,  9.15 p.m.  I'm like, what's going to happen?  I got to watch.  This last one, though, surprised me because everyone lived.  Usually those things are horrific, and everyone winds up dying, and it's over.  But this one, kind of a surprise ending.  Everyone made it.  Well, we got some action on the phones because of this.  Let's say hi to Dave.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Where are you calling from, Dave?  Charlotte.  Oh, right on, man.  The cockpit of A.  Yeah, really.  Let's go, Dave.  Yeah.  What's up?  Go ahead, Dave.  One for you.  I'm in San Francisco, and I'm supposed to be flying out to Hawaii. 
[00:14:00]  We take off.  Everything's fine.  We're about an hour into the flight over the Pacific Ocean, and all of a sudden, the plane just  decides to dip for about 10 seconds, kind of like it's going down.  Levels off.  And the pilot comes on and says, oh, sorry, folks.  We've got to turn around and head back to San Francisco.  Meanwhile, we're about, what, 500, 600 miles out over the Pacific Ocean?  They turn the plane around.  Pilot gets back on again.  Oh, look out the window.  Jesus.  I hate when they get halfway through a story. 
[00:14:30]  I hate when we get, you know, hooked into a story, and then something happens with the cell phone.  We invested time, Opie.  We invested time in that story.  And now we had a sell-off at a loss.  Maybe he can call back.  My interest level slowly goes up and up and up.  I'm like, all right, you got me.  I'm in.  Okay, you got me.  I want to know what's going to happen.  They turn the plane around.  And then, Gary in Houston, what's up?  Yeah, that's Gary.  Hey, I was-  Hi, Gary.  Hi, good morning, everybody.  Yeah, what's up?  I was on a Japanese airline flight leaving Taipei, going back to Los Angeles. 
[00:15:00]  And coming on the loudspeaker was, you know, in a foreign language, they were talking for 30 minutes about something that was going on.  I look out the window, and at the end of the wing, the gas was just gushing out.  They were just dumping the fuel.  And then in, you know, one small sentence, they said, oh, we got to make an emergency landing.  And they flew to Tokyo and landed.  But that was freaking me out because I knew something was wrong, but they were talking in a foreign language for, it must have been 20 minutes, explaining what was going on. 
[00:15:30]  And you couldn't, well, I was going to do Jimmy's joke, and you couldn't figure out what was wrong with the expressions on the people around you.  No.  It was either sheer terror or sleep.  Yeah.  Because at least if they're given the instructions, you know, in another language, you can look around the plane and see people's reaction.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were, everybody was definitely concerned.  They could understand it.  I had a weird flight all the time.  So, come to find out, after we landed, there was a fire up at the front of the plane. 
[00:16:00]  He never went there.  So, it was hairy.  I had a brutal flight.  All right, thanks.  One time this July 23rd, I'm on my way to Cleveland to do the Odeon.  Because the second show had tickets available.  Yeah.  Ticketmaster, and I'm like in the plane, I'm like, what's going to happen?  Right.  And the pilot got concerned, it just got bumpy.  Yeah.  All right, do we want to do 20 minutes of people that's scared?  I want that guy to call back.  Did you ever see the special on the flight that crash landed in, I think it was Iowa? 
[00:16:30]  United flight was a DC-10.  Yeah.  Because they had the design flaw.  Yeah.  And they actually had the cockpit audio of the three pilots, and then there was a pilot  in first class.  Yeah, a guy that was very familiar with the plane.  Denny Fitch, his name was.  Oh, really?  I still remember his name, yeah.  Very, uh...  He lived, right?  They all...  Half the flight lived.  They all should have died.  They had no...  Oh, my God.  Just cartwheel.  They had no hydraulics.  No elevator control, as they called it.  Yeah.  All three blew.  All they used was engine control on the wings, because the rear engine blew all their hydraulics 
[00:17:00]  out.  They had two engines on the wings left, and they could just power up one or the other  to kind of turn the plane a little bit, and actually got pretty close to landing the thing.  Dude, he said they were coming in, and they were just about to land, and they had to cut  power because they were coming in too fast.  There's no way to land at that speed.  And when they cut power, the plane drifted to the left or the right a little bit, and  then they hit the runway and flipped.  That's what happened with this thing I was watching last night.  They're coming in, but they couldn't put the flaps down, so you can't slow the plane down. 
[00:17:30]  And they were coming in at over 200 miles an hour, and there was no way to slow it down.  The guy was doing these zigzag S-turns, trying to just slow the plane down a little bit.  You wouldn't think you have no gas, no engines, that speed is going to be a problem for  you, but they had that problem.  All right, this guy, he's got our interest.  Chris in Tennessee, go ahead.  A flight from Chicago into Cleveland, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and they put me in seat 1A just 
[00:18:00]  beside the door, and it's one of these little passenger jets where it's two on one side,  one on the other, so I can almost stick my feet out the door.  And they close the door, and we get up to about 25,000 feet, and the little buzzer goes off  where the stewardess picks up, and she's talking to the pilot, and she's standing.  I can almost reach her, and she sits down immediately with this really terrified look  in her face and buckles herself in, and looks at me and immediately gets on the PA and says,  we're going to ask if everybody can move to the back of the plane. 
[00:18:30]  There's a chance that the door could open during flight.  And, of course, everybody jumps up, runs to the rear of the plane and buckles in,  and there's this loud rushing of the wind and all this, and they end up dropping down  to like 6,000 feet and landing the plane, but it was months before I could get back  on a plane without thinking about that.  Did the door come off?  No, but it sounded like you had your window cracked, only you were going, you know,  600, 700 miles an hour on the interstate. 
[00:19:00]  So it was pretty intense while it happened, but that look on her face when he's telling  her, you know, what's going on, it was insane.  That happens once in a while.  I think it was an Aloha air flight because the sea salt had like, I guess, over the ocean  in a Hawaiian airline had kind of like, you know, fucked up the fuselage a little bit,  and the roof ripped off.  The roof ripped off like the first 10 rows just came right off, and people now are sitting  there, strapped in their seat, looking, just flying on a piece of plywood. 
[00:19:30]  You might as well just be there with no roof, no walls, nothing.  You're just sitting there.  I think only the stewardess got ripped out, though.  If I remember correctly, only the flight attendant, who was probably standing, got actually ripped  out of the plane at 30,000 feet.  Someone took a dive.  And I'd love to know what you think.  Hopefully you smash your head on the way out, but if you don't, is there a moment where  you're floating and you go, I was just on that plane, and it's going away.  And there it is, and I doubt there's any real chance of getting back on it at this 
[00:20:00]  point.  Well, at that altitude, you're pretty much just going to have the air ripped right out  of you.  I don't think you can breathe up there.  If it's 35,000 feet, I doubt you're going to be conscious.  But there has to be a moment where you're awake.  Probably a quick, voof, bam, but, you know, what are you going to do?  Then you're just out of it.  Well, we have some audio of the famous plane crash that happened in D.C. there, Anthony.  Yeah, we do.  The one that hit the bridge that you got in front of you.  Oh, that's horrible.  This was the whole, what, de-icing thing that happened? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  They didn't de-ice the plane, and they couldn't get the plane up in the air, and it ended  up hitting, what, the 14th Street Bridge in D.C.?  It happened with Ebersole's plane, too.  I think that's what it was.  It was a de-icing issue.  Yeah.  People don't know that.  It doesn't have to be like, you know, in the movies where they show those big chunks of  ice.  You get a quarter inch of ice, even an eighth of an inch of ice on the leading edge of your  wing.  It's going to cut down on your lift.  Well, I don't know.  What, we got the real audio?  Yeah, I think so.  Usually this audio is really hard to understand, though. 
[00:21:00]  Let's take a listen.  Well, you can hear the end of that.  We're going down.  Because we're going down.  I know it.  Boom.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye. 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  I saw a great special on the Concorde, the one that crashed, and they just knew there  was a problem, but there was not enough runway space to stop.  As they're taking off, they know something is very wrong, but they would have just crashed  if they would have tried to stop, so they had to take off.  Yeah, there's that point you reach, the point of no return where you have to take off.  You ever see the footage?  There's footage of that last Concorde.  It's like a few seconds of footage.  It's 100 feet off of the air, and it's on fucking fire.  Oh, right, yeah.  Over the French countryside.  It's really unpleasant. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  It's like the only Concorde that went down.  Yeah.  And that was caused by a Continental plane that took off before it, my friend.  Allegedly.  A piece of the engine falls off, gets kicked up by the tire of the Concorde, right into  the fuel tank.  Yeah.  It was a bogus part, I think, or a part that wasn't installed properly, or whatever.  But, you know, at least, Continental's a safe airline.  Fuck the people behind us.  Continental's motto, fuck the people behind us.  It's horrible.  And the story about the FedEx guy, apparently he wanted to single-handedly ruin FedEx by 
[00:22:30]  crashing the plane into their Memphis headquarters.  That was his plan, was to take over the cockpit with his ball-peen hammer.  That's wonderful.  Get behind the controls and crash into the hub.  We got more audio of plane crash-ins.  Plane crash-ins.  Plane crash-ins.  Jesus.  Plane crash-ins.  Plane's crashing.  Yeah.  An accident southbound on the Major Deegan at the Mashaloo Parkway.  An accident, a serious accident involving a tractor-trailer and a car.  It has been pushed off to the shoulder, but now watch out there now, because another flat 
[00:23:00]  bed truck is going to have to come to clear it, so yield right-of-way.  Northbound on the BQE, we spotted that disabled vehicle in the right-hand lane before the Cox  Kioskow, not causing much of a backup.  It's further northbound there on the BQE traffic.  Oh, is this the helicopter crash?  I would assume.  There was no explanation.  This is back in 1986.  It would be very exciting if she was just giving a traffic report.  I swear to God, I'm like, why is Eric so calm?  I thought this was audio from a plane crash, but it's actually the helicopter news lady  going down.  Oh.  There was no description of this clip, so I didn't know where we were going.  Next time, write that down, Hawk.  All right, so she's doing a traffic report, and unfortunately, she bites it here. 
[00:23:30]  It's very heavy.  Pass the Cox Kioskow, go all the way over to the LIE.  The outbound Holland Tunnel, extra heavy for you.  Right now, earlier there was a car fire at Hudson and Canal Street.  It has been cleared about heading to New Jersey.  The outbound Lincoln Tunnel looks a lot better for you.  In New Jersey.  Back on Saturday.  Get the wire, get the wire, get the wire.  Eek.  Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter. 
[00:24:00]  There's something that happened there.  It's quarter of five.  We're going to play some music.  We're going to play some music.  Play some music.  What, a little John Denver shithead?  I think that was WNBC.  Was it?  The NBC little helicopter.  Did she die?  Yes, she did.  Wow.  Eek.  That's a DJ that knows how to improvise.  Yeah.  Let's play some music.  Hey, let's get back into the tunes now.  Why don't we play Stairway to Heaven?  Jesus.  And the worst part of that whole thing is she didn't get to the Lincoln Tunnel,  so a lot of those drivers probably didn't know this way to go. 
[00:24:30]  All upset.  Where do I go?  Do I take an alternate route?  That's right.  This was live on NBC.  20 years ago?  About 1986.  I think.  That'll look a lot better for you in New Jersey.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Okay, we're going to play some music here.  Hit the water.  Hit the water.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  I think you can find out.  If she's saying hit the water after that spooling of an engine, 
[00:25:00]  after something like a clutch going or your tail rotor going.  She's either having a baby immediately or the fucking helicopter's going down.  You think the DJ, like, tried to hit the post?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Freaking loser DJs.  Oh, what a douchebag.  Probably still wanted to do his job right, so he's trying to hit the post.  Instead of talking through that and going, we obviously have a major problem here.  Yeah.  Now traffic's really going to be snarled as everybody slows down to watch this bitch. 
[00:25:30]  Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think.  Find out what's going on with the helicopter.  There's something that happened there.  It's quarter of five, 16 till five on WNBC on the Joey Reynolds Show.  We're taking an end copter report from Jane Dornacker.  Let's check in, see how they're doing there.  And we'll come right back at you.  That's all he had?  God, Huey Lewis.  Had to be square?  Is that what he's playing?  Oh.  Nothing happened with Jane.  We had a helicopter report from the end copter. 
[00:26:00]  Of course, you know, once before we had this happen a few months ago, she went down in the drink.  Not she, I mean, she has a pilot.  Jane is, well, until we find out what's going on, Jane was up there just now giving us a report.  And sometimes it gets cut off, too, you know, it's just an electronic thing.  Yeah.  But this time she said hit the water or something like that.  So we're going to find out what's going on there.  So stay tuned.  We hope nothing, say a little prayer.  Hope nothing's wrong.  That's really a, that's a hard job.  That's a stupid job. 
[00:26:30]  Helicopter news with trafficker.  But do you really need a helicopter doing traffic anymore?  Do you really need that?  I submit to you, no.  So what, was there any more on, like, what did he say when they finally came back?  Oh, that was it?  I think that was it for that, right?  Was that Joey Reynolds on NBC?  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  86.  W-I-N-B-C.  Just about 20 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Great improv skills, though.  Yeah.  Let's go back to the music.  To be square. 
[00:27:00]  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  That awful song.  All you hear as she's going down is some shall we dance.  Bum, ba, ba, bum.  Crunk.  Think, bitch.  That was horrible.  All right, we got one more clip of plane crash audio.  We can't get the stuff from that was in the United flight, because for some reason it's  illegal to release cockpit audio.  That's why you never hear it or you very rarely hear it.  And that one where that guy is describing, the one we were talking about, the way they, 
[00:27:30]  well, we lost all elevator control.  They're the fucking calmest people on earth.  Yeah, it's ridiculous, these guys.  It actually instilled confidence in me, even though the plane crashed, but it made me  more confident flying, because the pilots are that fucking amazing under pressure, where  everyone should be dead, and they still managed to get it close.  Yeah, close.  Well, I mean, to where they should have plummeted.  My fear isn't crashing on a land.  I'll take that.  Yeah?  Yeah, whatever.  What is it?  Fucking plummeting. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, plummeting.  It's falling.  Yeah, the plummeting part really does stink.  If someone said you're going to fly, and eventually, I mean, if I knew that, I probably would never  fly again, so let me shut up before I give a bad time.  Yeah, you know what?  Let's not even talk about it.  The plane crash audio, we got a third track here.  From, all I know, it's August 31st, 1988.  That's all I know.  That might be it.  Yeah?  That might be it from the 80s.  It's here.  Let's take a listen to this.  Power's fast.  It's an estimate so good.  Airspeed coming up both sides. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  You got an engine for you.  I'm going to make it.  That's where you want to.  Go power.  Gee.  All right.  Yee.  Creepy ass stuff.  I don't want to play anymore. 
[00:29:00]  That's horrid.  I don't want to play that anymore.  Ugh.  And I got an Eastern Airlines flight coming up.  I'm a little nervous.  Eastern?  The wings of man.  Yeah.  All right.  Creepy.

Here's food and wine critic Eric Asimov.  The holiday week seems like the perfect time for my annual plea for Madeira. 
[00:37:30]  This fortified wine, a favorite in the time of the Founding Fathers, is largely forgotten today.  It's a pity, because on a cold night, lounging at home, but really any time at all, Madeira is a treat.  The rainbow palette of flavors that makes vintage port such a kaleidoscope in the mouth is present in Madeira, too,  but supplemented with an acidity that is lively and refreshing.  The range of styles is huge, including almost dry Madeiras made from the Sertial grape  and sweet versions made from the Malmsy grape.  A good five-year-old Sertial, like one from Leacox, combines the almost salty quality of a Manzanilla sherry 
[00:38:00]  with the complexity of an Amontillado.  With five more years of age, a Sertial mellows its sweet edge broadening.  Fifteen-year-old Malmsy from Blandy's is luminous with brilliant fruit and spice flavors.  This is Eric Asimov of the New York Times.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.

Oh yeah, I was doing it with like an 11-year-old.  Then one day, they came together.  Break yourself!  Life story, go!  We're pretty much broadcasting conversation from the locker room, okay?  There you go.  I started filling up the minute I got through the door.  I don't wear bags?  Indeed. 
[00:39:00]  It is a cock fest.  Indeed.  You're talking about the Opie and Anthony program.  They're the worst.  Now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, do we have the Entertainment Tonight music, or could they play it in New York?  Because you've got to do the Entertainment Tonight voice for the Pat O'Brien story.  Do we have the hack-puker voice?  Do we have it, or?  It's beyond puker, isn't it?  What?  That voice that that woman does for one of the entertainment shows.  It's just that she, it's not human.  We're waiting. 
[00:39:30]  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  Pat O'Brien.  News today on Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien faces his demons of alcohol and checks into a rehab facility.  For years, Pat O'Brien has reported on problems facing Hollywood stars, formerly on Yaxias Kialiwad,  more recently on his new show, The Insya Wadier.  Now the former Chicago Spjortscaster is facing his own demons. 
[00:40:00]  I've had problems with Yaxias Kialiwad.  How many syllables can they cram in a word?  This is a great thing Pat is doing, said longtime old Brian friend and associate one day.  He's finally facing up to something many of us had known was the Puker-yagabro alum for a long time. 
[00:40:30]  He's facing up to it.  Pat O'Brien.  So he's an alcoholic.  He's an alky.  But, Opie, that isn't the whole story.  Apparently he checked into this rehab facility because he knew.  Are you saying we're going to go inside the story?  Inside the inside skill warren.  Oh, that's not all.  That's not all.  But this story has an even darker skill wide.  It seems Pat's a fjuckin' pervyard. 
[00:41:00]  This guy gets all tanked up and makes phone calls.  And, uh, oops, one of them gets taped.  Now Pat O'Brien's married, right?  I guess so.  Pat O'Brien married and, uh, he, he, he was getting drunk, calling, uh, this woman and  trying to work out a threesome with him, his wife, and, uh, and this woman.  Is this 1998?  No, it's not 1998. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, okay.  I just got a little confused.  It's Pat O'Brien.  It's now.  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  I'm sorry.  It's now.  Yes, I'm really sorry.  I seem to remember something very similar, but maybe, maybe I'm having just that deja vu  weird thing that happens to you.  Never checked into rehab.  Jesus.  1998, huh?  I mean, uh, 2005.  2005.  All right, I'm a little confused.  I mean, 2005.  Oh yeah, it says right on USA Today.  March 22nd, 2005.  Right, okay.  Ha ha.  We'll read the court documents of Anthony. 
[00:42:00]  Ha ha ha.  Who settled the case right when this testimony made its scene in court.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, got a post and daily news reporter sitting in the courtroom.  Oh, Anthony, is it true that you tried to invite other women into your, settle?  Ha ha ha.  I'll settle.  Give her whatever she wants.  The reporters, you can leave now.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha. 
[00:42:30]  Trying to live like a rock star.  Look what happens.  Ha ha ha.  You're such a hero to a lot of people out there.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  You're a hero.  Were there whips involved?  No, no whips.  All right.  I don't need to know, Anthony.  That's your private life.  It was a long time ago, Opie.  It was many, many moons ago.  Ha ha ha.  That's right.  I got the DD snort today.  Hey, look at this.  I'm better than Pat.  Pat couldn't close the deal.  All right.  He faces his demons of alcohol, checks into rehab, and once you check into rehab, everything's 
[00:43:00]  fine.  Yeah, that's the thing you do in Hollywood.  You could do the most outrageous crap, but you just blame it on the alcohol and the drugs.  You go into rehab, and everyone's like, ah!  Yeah.  That's it.  That is weird when that door slams.  I know.  It sucks to make a lot of a thing out.  Anyway, so we have the audio of Pat O'Brien.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  I haven't heard this yet.  This is the beauty of...  Did you take somebody or no?  I don't know.  Hey, you know something?  It would probably be illegal for us to tape somebody on the phone because of some FCC 
[00:43:30]  rules.  But for some reason, when these tapes get out, you play them anywhere.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Ah, what's the rule?  Ah, who cares?  This is the beauty of satellite radio.  No one else is going to give you the unedited version, right?  Unedited.  I hear some racy talk from Pat O'Brien.  I like to call it saucy.  Saucy?  Wow.  It's saucy stuff.  I like racy, but saucy's...  Racy is dirty.  Saucy is sexy.  Racy involves a black woman.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Saucy.  Let's try that.  No, nothing. 
[00:44:00]  Nothing?  Nothing.  This is risque.  Risque is good, too.  Risque is boring.  Saucy.  I like saucy talk.  You take your wine, a little sugar.  Yeah.  You put in your meat.  Oh, no.  You may have to talk dirty to 100 guys one day.  Oh, no.  Oh, the showstopper's going to talk again.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, no.  I actually heard the audio this morning.  Uh-huh.  On the way down here, I didn't have a room, so I shared a room with...  You're going to describe the whole scene of going into the room, turning on the recorder?  I happened to share a room with Steve, and this morning I was laying in bed, and Steve 
[00:44:30]  was playing the audio on his laptop, and certain things you just don't want to hear when  you're alone in a room with Steve when you're half asleep, and...  Oh, did you go...  I absolutely did, because when you hear the beginning of this phone call,  on some of the things he's saying, I thought it was Steve, and it was a little scary.  That's highly unlikely, but all right.  Where's your other hand?  Between two pillows.  Those aren't instant replay machines.  All right, Pat O'Brien.  All right, Steve, are we ready for the big exclusive? 
[00:45:00]  We're the only show that can play the unedited version of this.  Now, what if we want to stop this...  Just cue me.  ...and talk?  We'll point to Steve.  Yeah.  In the old days, I would just stop the tape, Anthony, but, you know.  Point at that cuddly face.  This means stop.  Okay, Jim, thank you.  I'll get you back, Steve.  I don't want to fuck me.  Go crazy.  All right.  What are you doing, Steve?  Oh.  Oh, you dicks.  You're just going to screw with them.  You didn't fall for that, did you? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  You just both did the big stupid stops.  But there's obviously...  Why is the audio five feet behind you?  I don't want it stopped like that.  Wow.  Yeah, rewind that, Steve.  God, that was too easy.  And get the Pat O'Brien clip, not the Joaquin Phoenix clip from the village.  You guys suck.  All right.  All right.  Well, why don't we go to the tape?  So this is Pat O'Brien...  All right.  Let's see.  ...making a drunken phone call to a girl that he's trying to get in bed with his...  either girlfriend or his wife.  I don't know if he's really married or whatever.  So...  Let's hear.  To copy this message to another person, press 6. 
[00:46:00]  To delete this message and go to the next, press 7.  To keep the...  Save the message Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  You are so fucking hot.  And I want to eat you. 
[00:46:30]  I don't want you to suck my cock.  I want to fuck you.  I don't want my girlfriend to eat you.  You're so fucking hot.  You are fucking hot.  Let's do it.  You are so fucking hot.  Please leave me a voicemail.  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voicemail.  Bye.  All right.  Hold on a minute, Steve.  I just got to soak that in.  What an ass. 
[00:47:00]  He left these on a machine.  Hey, could someone get me the address for the insider?  There's a job opening over there.  Oh, my God.  There is no way he's coming back from that.  How can he come back?  And can I say he's awful at talking dirty?  You're so fucking hot.  I'm fucking hot.  Niggs was better at it.  He stinks.  I can smell your liquor breath.  What an ass. 
[00:47:30]  He left that on a machine like this woman isn't on a cell phone.  Did he say, suck my cock?  Oh, yeah.  He said he wanted to eat her and wanted her to suck his cock.  And then he said, go do the traffic.  Oh, my God.  Is there more?  That's hard to come back from.  Yeah, there's another four minutes of this.  Oh, my God.  I'm hanging.  Let's go.  This guy's great.  Someone says it sounds like Florentine.  Yeah.  Special.  Saved message Sunday, 7, 48 p.m. 
[00:48:00]  I'm so fucking into you.  But Betsy's so jealous.  But I fucking have sex.  And I want to lick your pussy and suck your tits.  But you have to be into Betsy.  I told Betsy that you were into her.  And if you get this message, just look at me and say yes.  But I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you cum so much. 
[00:48:30]  And get crazy.  I don't know why I'm like this.  But I want you badly.  I know you want me.  But you have to be into Betsy, too.  So I'm going to get this message.  If she agrees with me, say yes.  Oh, wow.  First, the worst part is that he's fucking a girl named Betsy.  You've got to be with old Betsy.  Dude, your mic is messing up. 
[00:49:00]  I know it is.  That is unbelievable.  That guy is so completely in a froth.  That guy is in a fucking tizzy over this chick.  He's probably like popping Viagra like they're Tic Tacs.  And now he just has a raging heart on him.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's thinking about this.  He can't even keep it in his head.  He's got to call this woman and tell her.  He's imagining licking her and doing it to him.  And he cannot even deal. 
[00:49:30]  How did these tapes get out?  This woman, whoever he left the messages on, saved them all.  Obviously thought it was newsworthy.  Why?  What happened?  Apparently she was flipping through the television one night at 7.30.  Hey, wait a minute.  I've talked to him before.  I know this guy.  I think I have some tapes.  Oh, my God.  How old are these tapes?  I don't know.  Any date on them?  Do we have any info on these tapes at all, Steve?  No.  I got sent a link, and that was it.  No background info.  Now, what's the reason that she released these tapes? 
[00:50:00]  Do you know the back story?  We don't really know much about this, huh?  This showed up in the email.  It's just, Pat O'Brien talks dirty, drunk, and coked up.  That was the link I got.  And he said, if you hear this message, and you see me just nod and smile.  Yeah.  Is that Mike fading in and out, or no?  It's okay.  No, you're all right.  Okay.  You got to stay on, Mike, a little more.  Are we the only ones playing these tapes today?  I think so.  Maybe she personally sent it to us.  She's a fan of the show.  Wow.  I'm sure it's us and Betsy.  We're the ones who are...  Betsy.  You got to be with Betsy, though. 
[00:50:30]  I told Betsy.  Betsy's so jealous.  Betsy.  I want to lick your pussy.  You heard it here first, folks.  Pat O'Brien facing his demons.  He wants to leahyuk her puyussi.  You heard a horny Pat O'Brien right here exclusively on the Opium Yatam Yatam Yatam Show.  Pat O'Brien, that horny fucker.  He just wants to leahyuk her pussy.  He can't even take it.  And then we also heard him say, he wants her to shuck his kuyak.  He wants to make her cum over and over again 
[00:51:00]  As he licks her Björkjössé  He wants to lick her tits  Pat O'Brien, horny old bastard  Can he get Björkjössé in on the whole situation?  We'll find out later in the Björkjössé  On Inside Edition  He wants to stick his tongue inside her puss  We got more, Steve? 
[00:51:30]  Will Betsy say yes?  Yeah, well, let's see what happens  Maybe it's a whole...  Maybe there's a conclusion to this  Here we go  So copy  Saved message Sunday, 7, 51 p.m.  This is so fucking hot  Just look at your victory with Ernie outside  Just say yes to me  Or wink  I don't want to fucking go crazy with you  So I have you done

What a risk  She's just going to walk down the hall  And just give him a nod?  I have a pertinent question in this whole situation  Yes, Anthony?  How are we sure this is Pat O'Brien?  It sounds like him  It does sound like him  Listen to the voice, man 
[00:52:30]  I understand  Oh, no, I will not say it doesn't sound like him  But how are we sure enough to play this as Pat O'Brien?  Not having any confirmation  There's no news  I thought this was attached to a news story  That Pat O'Brien's sex tapes have leaked out  Are we going to be part of his story later today, Steve?  Jesus  Steve, I thought this was part of a story that was out in the news  That these tapes have surfaced  That's why he's in rehab, blah, blah, blah  Hey, we got a huge audience in there all over the country 
[00:53:00]  Hey, guys  Is anyone else playing the Pat O'Brien day today?

[00:57:00]  On insider host  Pat O'Brien's decision  To enter rehab Sunday?  Hollywood sources  Suggest the timing  Was to defuse  The release of several  Sexually explicit  Voicemail messages  Available on the internet  Yesterday  Soliciting sex  From an unidentified woman  And then in quotes  Let's just bleeping  Have sex and fun  And drugs  And go crazy  Oh we didn't get to that part  No  Says the male voice  Yesterday's reps  For the insider  Would not comment  On widespread  Attribution of the voice  To O'Brien  The tape

[01:03:00]  Ben O'Brien stinks  He's the worst  Clark from whackbag.com  He writes on the instant feedback  She's going to call back  Back after he blows his wad  What a douche  I want to fuck your ankle  I want to suck your fifth vertebrae  That's great  I want to put Valium up your ass  And have Betsy suck him out  And then blow me  And stick him in the tip of my dick  If you agree with this  When I ask you what time is it  Look at your watch  He really is awful  He's a redundant ass 
[01:03:30]  God almighty  You know this is a little obscure  But I'm going to go with it anyway  Sandra Bernhardt in King of Comedy  Oh I know  When Lankford  Jerry  Jerry  Was tied up  And she's like  Let's just get crazy  Let's get crazy  Yeah  You drive me crazy  Jerry  Yeah that's what it's like  Let's just get crazy  Let's get nuts  Let's get insane  It has that same  Let's herky jerk  I want to herky jerk with you  And musk my hair up  Do you want to kiss Betsy on the mouth  God why didn't we play this at 7 
[01:04:00]  Instead of bitch about the equipment  Oh  This is fantastic  This is 3 hours of radio  Not 10 minutes  I heard he got all pissed off  And called her back  After these tapes got out  And a man in my position  Can't afford to be made  To look ridiculous  God damn  That is great  How embarrassing  How completely embarrassing  Oh my god  How do you get around this  Even rehab  You know we were saying 
[01:04:30]  You check into rehab  It smooths everything over  But this is a toughie  This is just a horny  Drugged out ass  This isn't one phone call  This is 50 with the same things  Over and over again  Stalking  And he's like  Betsy isn't really into it  And then he goes on  Like a second later  He's like  You and Betsy  You'd eat each other  I want to know  What did she do  That gave him a signal  That this was what she wanted  Right  She probably flirted with him once  And said  Oh my god  Betsy  Oh my god  What I would do with you two  And then giggled  And walked away  Good point  What did she say  That warranted this guy 
[01:05:00]  Calling her like a stalker  With filth like this  He misinterpreted something  And just ruined his career  With the signals  He's telling her to give back  It was probably  You know  I saw you go to the copy machine  I saw that  I know what that means  I want to get Betsy  And then just pick up  Jane Mansfield's head  And eat it  Jesus Christ dude  Get a hold of yourself  Go out to the desert  And beat you with a shovel  And bury you  We'll have a hooker come over  And she'll want us to eat her pussy  But we won't want to  So she'll give back 50  And then leave the room  Horrible 
[01:05:30]  Should we go back to the tape  Oh you betcha  You know how it's gonna start  Let's hear the next message  Oh you're so fucking hot  I don't want to fuck you  There's only like 14 seconds left  Lick you  Oh we're down to the last 14  Yeah I think that  I think we're almost done with it  But here's the last bit  Alright  That's it huh  That's it huh  Did he say kids can watch 
[01:06:00]  Eden said  Yeah bring the kids in on it too  I don't care  I want Adam Walsh's head in my lap  While you suck my cock  Wow  That's gold  It's the best of the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  We cannot get enough  Of the Pat O'Brien sex tapes  He totally loses it  At the end of that  Yeah  Like he loses  He can't  He was kind of doing a good job  With I want to do this  To you and that  And then at the end  It's just like  Yeah you come up 
[01:06:30]  Hookers  And then he's just  Throwing words out  Hookers  Fuck  You  Drugs  Coke  Coke  Fuck  You know what happens  Ass eat  Fuck  You know what happened  I've been studying these tapes  Since we started playing them  Studying  Yeah I'm studying this whole thing  Studying  It just amazes me  He just ran out of things  He wanted to do with her  I know  That's what the problem was  Well you know  There is only so much you can do  Right  Unless you're Jimmy  That'd be interesting  I'm putting shit on my chest  Piss in my mouth  New things can be added in 
[01:07:00]  This guy  What a rookie  Oh my god  That's alright  Fuck  Suck  That's pretty much it  You know  What are you gonna do  I wanna tickle your  Behind your kneecap  Yeah that's good  Well then her and Betsy make out  So he does kind of like  Go back the other way  Yeah  Yeah he kind of  He tried but  Yeah  I don't think he pulled it off  He tried to bring the romance back  Just a little bit  The romance  After saying how  After saying how  He wanted to jerk off in her face  Then he brings it back a little bit  I want you to have a miscarriage  And then spoon with Betsy 
[01:07:30]  Betsy  Poor Betsy  You know  We've been doing a lot of interviews  And they're  Well what's the difference  Between regular radio  And satellite radio  Yeah  Answer the Pat O'Brien sex tapes  That pretty much sums it up  Because no one is having fun  Like we are  With these things  No one  And now the listeners  And our interns  They're all starting to  Make their own versions  Of the sex tapes  Remember we encouraged that  Yesterday Anthony  Only on this show

[01:11:30]  Well Anthony  The story gets better  Oh no it can't possibly  The story gets better  Give the recap  Well Pat O'Brien was leaving these messages on this girl's machine  Sexually explicit  You heard him here  And then it got a little worse  We reported that there's a photograph  Yeah the girl  I guess Betsy  Has this ex-husband  Who has possession of a photo  Of Pat O'Brien jacking 
[01:12:00]  Just a picture of a glistening sweaty Pat O'Brien  With dick in hand  Getting down to bidness  And that picture's probably gonna be making the rounds soon  And the tabloids  Yeah  Somewhere on the internet  Yeah  But you're saying now it gets a little worse?  Well yes  According to the Daily News  The gossip column called  Gatecrasher  This guy Ben  The guy who writes 
[01:12:30]  Gatecrasher  Ben does the gossip column  Yeah Ben Whittakam  Access Hollywood battle on  We should probably leave poor old Pat O'Brien alone  But the stories keep coming  A source tells us  He used to refer to a gay African American senior producer  At Access Hollywood as  The fruit monkey  Oh Jesus  And  Wow  He would say this  To her face 
[01:13:00]  Are you kidding me?  Or to his face  Excuse me  To his face  He would say this to his face  A source tells us  He used to refer to a gay African American senior producer  At Access Hollywood  As  The fruit monkey  Oh  This guy just lost his mind  He was probably just doing coke and drinking during  Yeah  You  Betsy  Me  And the fucking fruit monkey  Get him in here  I want to fuck the fruit monkey in the ass  You eat Betsy

[01:14:00]  He was hitting on Oprah Winfrey as well  Ugh  He does deserve to be in rehab  I guess he was at  How drunk do you have to be to try to hit on that?  I guess he was at the Four Seasons  In LA  Saw Oprah Winfrey at the bar  Uh  Oprah Winfrey walks into a bar  I fucked her  Me and Betsy and the fruit monkey  I guess he went up to Oprah Winfrey  She's the fat monkey I call her  Went up to Oprah Winfrey in the bar  And was starting to flirt with her 
[01:14:30]  And try to pick her up  Right  And she didn't go for it  Yeah  Obviously  So I hope all the stories get out  Before we go on vacation  Oh please  We're going to be reading about that on vacation  Going  Damn it  Really?

He's still on their website  The insider website  They have him on there  With his bio 
[01:19:00]  And his bio lists  All of his credits  And how long he's been in the business  His long career  Which ends now  Right  Well it's controversy  Controversy sells  Of course they're going to keep it up there for a while  And then  Because everyone's searching on any info they can  On Pat O'Brien now  They have his statement  That he made  Oh  Thanking his fans  Oh really?  And saying that he's entering rehab  And that he wants to get back to work as quickly as possible  I'm sure he does  Good luck with that one  Yeah that ain't happening anytime soon huh? 
[01:19:30]  Oof  This isn't something you could just walk out of rehab  And go back to work  How do you put that suit on  And sit there  And talk about  You know Britney Spears  Gaining a little weight  Or you know  Any of the other  Inane celebrity stories  When you're the biggest story  You know  I didn't see anything on the insider website  About his story  You know  You know they all are sitting there going  Oh my god  I want to dig into this  We want to do this story  You know they're doing it on  Entertainment Tonight  And all the other ones  With that wacky voice lady

You want to drink at the top. Dude, as long as you don't associate yourself with any 
[01:44:00]  particular 12-step program. You can admit your own personal thing. I'm an alcoholic. I'm Jim  Norton. I'm an alcoholic. That's not an anonymity break, stupid. Hold on. I've read the tradition.  That's why I don't say where I go. That's why I wear a mask. I wear a superhero mask wherever I am.  I got to jump in again. And Mr. Sinister is giving us an instant feedback here saying,  from Whackbag. Who is Popebag? It was in his email. What? It was in his email. You guys did a joke 
[01:44:30]  about Whackbag being Popebag when the Pope was coming around. He put it as a joke in his email,  so that's what I wrote on there. Put it as a joke, and that's what's going to be written on there,  you asshead. Why is everyone uptight? We don't know. Mr. Sinister indeed. Let's all get naked  and hug in the woods. Let's start in the studio at 1101. He's just saying he used to it. Throw  some leaves down. Let's go to Gary. Gary, what's up? Hey, boys.  Hey, Jimmy, you luscious ball of yum-yums. Thank you. Hey, I agree. This guy's going 
[01:45:00]  to relapse. Even Michael J. Fox has said that his chances of recovery are shaky. Punching  out. All right, a little shaky. That's not entirely bad. You want to cricket him, but it  was just, it was mean, and that kind of gives it a little relief. I actually pushed the cricket  button down halfway, but I couldn't commit. I'm like, ooh, it's right on the line there.  That's not too bad. All right, let's try this thing out here.  Hey, it's me. What's up, guys? You are so fucking hot. Who, me? 
[01:45:30]  I know. I heard the conversation. I don't want you to suck my god. I don't want you to suck my god.  I don't want you to suck my god. I don't want you to suck my god. I don't want you to suck my god.  I don't want my girlfriend. You are so fucking hot. You are fucking hot.  Why are we even talking about the P word? I want to suck my god. Go crazy with you.  I got to go, guys. Yeah. I want to suck my god. Guys, I don't do that. That's not my style, 
[01:46:00]  okay? I don't do that crap. That's right. I just hung up the phone. I was like, you know  what? I got to go. It's not my style, guys. It's maybe your style, but it ain't mine.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up. You're pussy.  That was funny. Hey, that had potential.  Tommy Lee called. That had potential.  It was picked up at the end. It was a little slow. 
[01:46:30]  That had potential, no? You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm really annoyed at that last call. I know, I know.  There's nothing that annoys me more than somebody pontificating when you're wrong.  I don't do it all the time. Anthony, let's calm on Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Hey, man, as long as you can...  Look, he just smiled.  He's smiling now.  That guy's heart's in the right place. That's all that matters.  There you go.  Oh, Jimmy's back.  All right, Jimmy?  I have Liddy. That's all I need.  Look, he's back. He's back with the program.  He's not mad anymore.  I don't know. How can you be when George O'Dowd is dumping out of tune? 
[01:47:00]  Dee, dee, dee.  La, la, la.  Ba, ba, ba.  There we are.  Feeling better?  Who couldn't?  How do you not feel good with this?  You got to let the, what do you call it?  The hook?  Yeah, yeah.  The post, whatever.  The hook, yeah.  The hook.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, my face. 
[01:47:30]  You come and go.  You come and go.  You come and go.  All right, he's back.  Pretending I was a UN interpreter.  Oh, good Lord.  There he is.  And Kelsey Drower falling down makes everybody smile.  See, Jimmy's laughing again.  How can you not be?  A little.  Oh, Pat O'Brien's a good sort.  Ah, God bless him.  Anonymity.  Shmamanimity.  All right, that Tommy Lee thing was from DJ Newstown.  It was pretty good.  Scout from Tennessee.  Hey, I was wondering, that song you were playing, what was the name of that? 
[01:48:00]  Is that Comma Comedian?  Wait.  It's coming.  Pretending I was a UN interpreter.  Oh, good Lord.  Right?  Comma Comedian.  Maybe we just get the clip.  Comma, comma, comedian.  That could be the new sound clip when someone bombs, just the good Lord part in the fall.  The fall.  Good Lord.  Good Lord.  All right.  Do you want to try this Trainables, Petal Brian thing?  I haven't heard this one.  It could be very wrong or something.  Could be good.  Could be bad. 
[01:48:30]  I like it.  Daddy?  You're so fucking hot.  Okay.  I don't want you to suck like that.  It's sticky, all right?  I want to fuck it.  All right.  Jesus.  We made this one.  How old is that Trainable?  We had this one.  I like 12.  I got to get a bail on that one.  Holy shit.  I can't even go with that one.  But it's from the 50s.  She's old now.  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  There's no real connection. 
[01:49:00]  It's very funny.  Way to look at it.  It's sticky.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  That's the Bitstopper right there.  Oof.  It's the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Turn around.  Here's Kenny.  Here comes Kenny.  Where is he performing, by the way?  Right behind you.  Right.  Kenny, do a test, test, test.  You look good, Ken.  Check.  One, two.  One more time.  Check.  Test.  All right.  Very good.  Very good. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  We're setting up the pal talk camera for the pal talkers out there.  Yeah.  There we go.  Who's breathing heavy?  Probably me.  Yeah, he really is.  Why, Derek?  The dodo?  Because I'm Derek the dodo.  The dodo.  Can't you just do it with the mask down?  You've got to get the full effect.  We're taping this for you two.  Yeah, come on, Ken.  Look at that. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, put the mask down so he screws up the lyrics because he can't read them.  Do you know how the song goes?  Can't raise the camera anymore, or is that it?  That's not my camera.  Oh.  Which one?  This one?  Yeah, the other way.  More head room.  That would be E-Rock's camera.  Too much now.  Down.  Wow, with the lighting, it really looks good.  We're just setting up a two-camera shoot here for YouTube.  That's very important when you do a radio show.  Everything else, of course, the camera.  We're just... 
[01:50:30]  The cameras are very important for radio.  We're the only radio show more obsessed with video than radio.  Now, do we have a karaoke version, or is he just going to sing over the version?  It's karaoke.  It's karaoke?  Do you know when to kick in, or do you need Ant's help again?  Yeah, you've got to kill me.  All right, Ant, you'll know, right?  I hope so.  Like the leader of the band.  All right, here we go.  I don't know.  Without further ado, it's Club Soda Kenny and his Monster Mash song for Halloween.  I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight, for my monster 
[01:51:00]  from his slab began to rise, and suddenly, to my surprise, he did the mash.  He did the monster mash, the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  He did the mash. 
[01:51:30]  It caught on in a flash.  He did the mash.  He did the monster mash.  From my laboratory in the castle east to the master bedroom where the vampires feast,  the ghouls all came from humble abodes to get a jolt from my electrodes.  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash, the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They did the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  They did the mash. 
[01:52:00]  They did the monster mash.  The zombies were having fun.  The party had just begun.  The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son.  The scene was rocking, and all were digging the sounds.  Igor on chains, backed by the banging hounds.  The coffin bangers were about to arrive with the vocal group, the Crypt Kicker 5.  They did the monster mash. 
[01:52:30]  They played the monster mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  They played the monster mash.  It caught on in a flash.  They played the mash.  Then they played the monster mash.  This got a lot of lyrics.  Out from his coffin, Drax's voice did ring.  Seems he was troubled by just one thing.  He opened the lid and shook his fist and said,  Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist? 
[01:53:00]  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And it's a graveyard smash.  It's now the mash.  It caught on in a flash.  It's now the mash.  It's now the monster mash.  Now everything's cool.  Drax's a part of the band.  And my monster mash is a hit of the land.  For you the living this mash was meant to. 
[01:53:30]  When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you.  What did they do?  They did the mash.  They did the monster mash.  The monster mash.  And through my graveyard smash, they can do the mash.  It'll caught on in a flash.  They can do the mash.  Then you do the monster mash.  Oh! 
[01:54:00]  Well, I'm Soda Kenny, everyone.  Wow.  Wow.  Fantastic.  It will caught on in a flash.  It will caught on in a flash.  Gotta add my own little flavor to it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You certainly did.  It's the flavor of Down syndrome.  That is delicious.  All right.  Save that for tonight's Halloween party.  We might have to do that again.  Oh, that is fantastic.  Are you all sweating?  It's hot in here with this thing.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Razzle Dazzle.  We'll be back with the reruns after this.  Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh.  Crunch, laugh, crunch, laugh, crunch, laugh.

They're just waiting to speak to Tony.  All right.  And where is she from?  I'm sorry.  Where are you from?  We are from New Jersey.  Surgeonsville.  They're from Surgeonsville, New Jersey. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  And what's her name?  Her name is Joan.  I'm going to give her the phone right now.  And just get Tony ready.  Hey, let me get into my Tony character.  All right.  Let's get Joan on the phone here.  Okay.  Here's Joan.  Is he here?  Yeah.  He's right on the phone.  Oh, my.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, Joan.  How are you doing?  I'm doing fine.  We can't wait to come inside and see you in person.  Well, I can't wait to have you on the show.  Thank you.  I mean, we watch it every day.  We love it.  I especially like the food, particularly. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, you like the cooking segments.  I do.  I like the food segments.  Well, you know, I love to cook.  Being Italian, you know, I cook a lot at home.  Uh-huh.  And my kids, they get involved.  And I think it's something a lot of people like, you know?  Oh, you know what?  I have a great recipe for spaghetti and clams, the white sauce.  Spaghetti and clams.  That's my favorite.  Well, you know, I'll send you the recipe.  You got a fantastic recipe for that. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, I'll send it to you.  You know something?  Hey, one day I would love to have you maybe come on the show as, you know,  a listener cooking segment or a viewer cooking segment.  Oops.  Oh, I would love to.  And we could have you cook your special.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Actually, you know, if you ever come over to New Jersey,  you can come out to Surgenceville.  We live way out in the country.  And it's a beautiful area, close to the Delaware River. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, you have a nice place out there?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, we'll cook your spaghetti and clams first.  You might as well taste it before it's aired.  Yeah, I should taste it first.  I like taking a little taste before I dip in.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how long have you been a fan?  You remember me from taxi?  I'm sorry, Candy.  I couldn't understand that.  Hey, you remember me from my old days in taxi?  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  We've been following your career. 
[02:02:00]  You know, I know that you do shows in Atlantic City.  We're about two hours away from Atlantic City.  Oh, two hours.  So, you go there a lot?  Say that again?  So, you go to Atlantic City a lot?  Oh, yes.  Oh, I love going there.  The gambling.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  You all get on the big loser bus and take that down there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  It's great.  Are you going to be in Atlantic City soon? 
[02:02:30]  Well, yeah.  You know, I got my album, so I like to sing.  And I go down there to Tropicana, and I get up there, and, you know, I whine, and the  rubes give me money.  It's fantastic.  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.  Well, I have a cousin who happens to own a condo right on Boardwalk at the end of the  casinos, and it is just fabulous to go and visit him.  That sounds fantastic.  Yes.  You know something? 
[02:03:00]  What?  You sound like a big Tony Danza fan.  I am the biggest Tony Danza fan.  So, I want to do something a little special for you.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Here it comes, kids.  Hold on to your hats.  Okay.  I need a little relaxation before the show.  You know, it's a stressful situation being out there.  I'm kind of new to the talk show thing.  You understand?  Yes.  So, I'm thinking I could use a little company in the dressing room.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:03:30]  How would you like to come backstage and hang out with me when I get ready for the show?  I would love it.  I would love it.  Do I bring my family?  Me.  Excuse me?  Just me?  Or do I bring the three people I came with?  Well, who do you have with you?  My husband is here, and my two friends, Karen and Phyllis.  Your husband's there?  Yes.  Well, that's fantastic.  Yes.  Can you see where this is going? 
[02:04:00]  I can.  Now, I'd like you, you know something?  Bring the whole family with you.  Oh, Tony.  Backstage to hang out with me before the show because I need to relax a little bit.  Okay.  Great.  That's great.  Well, you are just so special to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I love being special.  And you know what relaxes me?  What's that?  I love to relax with you.  Strap in, kids.  You know what relaxes me backstage?  Excuse me? 
[02:04:30]  You know what relaxes me backstage in my dressing room?  Sure.  A nice fucking blowjob.  Oh, my.  I'm sorry.  I missed that on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Should I?  Tony likes having his hogs sucked.  Before I got to placate to the rubes out there.  I would never use a word like placate.  What am I, insane?  Before I entertain all the rubes out there in my audience. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, okay.  I like blowing a load on someone's face.  And you seem like that person.  Okay.  Should I give this phone to Eric so he knows what's going on?  You better give it to him so he can run as fast as he can away from your husband.  When you tell him the news that you'll be backstage sucking Tony Danza's cock.  Okay.  Fantastic.  I heard what you said.  I'm going backstage, Eric. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  Okay, here.  I'm going to give you to Eric so you can tell him what's going on.  Fantastic.  Okay.  See you soon, Tony, and thank you so much.  You certainly will.  All right.  I will come back right out.  Hey, run, Eric.  Run.  All right.  You got it?  Yeah, you can come home.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe.  Is she telling her husband right now?  Is that what?  I'm sorry?  Is she telling her husband right now?  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  They're jumping up and down.  I think she was so starstruck she had no clue what I was saying.  All right.  Ask her if she understands what's going on.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me move back.  They're moving the line in.  Hold on.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, he's going to kill him.  I just wanted to ask you, do you guys understand what's going on and everything, right, about  what he said?  About the backstage and all that?  Just be there.  Just be there?  Yes.  Yeah, she understands.  Okay.  Does she understand what she has to do to Tony, though?  You understand what you have to do for Tony, right? 
[02:06:30]  She doesn't, she's having trouble hearing you.  She's having trouble hearing.  She just said to tell her if, again, what, you want me to tell you?  Yes.  All right.  What does Tony want her to do?  I think that Tony should tell her.  Maybe Tony should tell her.  Yeah, Tony should tell her.  Tony wants to tell her?  Okay.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Tony loves you.  He can't get enough of you.  Okay.  I'm going to try to hear out here.  All right, Joan.  You listening?  Yeah, I'm listening.  Look, I need you to come backstage before the show and give Tony Danza, myself, some oral 
[02:07:00]  favors.  Some oral favors?  Is that what you said?  What did you say?  You heard me right, honey.  Party favors?  No, not party favors.  I need oral treats before the show to get me loosened up, and I pick a broad online every  day, Eric finds a broad that could give me oral favors. 
[02:07:30]  Eric is telling me I have to blow out those party favor things.  No, he's saying a blow job.  Yeah.  I know what you're saying.  I understand what you're saying.  Do you get it now?  I get it now.  Joan Jones, suck on my bone.  And you're not going to do this on television saying that.  No, no, no.  The Tony Danza on TV has got to be all nice. 
[02:08:00]  The one backstage makes you choke.  She can't hear me right now.  She can't hear me right now.  Get her to run up on stage during the show.  All righty.  All right.  There's two Tony Danzas.  Also, I'm going to introduce you during the show.  Okay, that's good.  So, actually, I can't say your name, but right after I say extravadanza, I want you  to run up on stage and join me. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Absolutely.  I need a big hug from you.  Okay.  Right after I say extravadanza in the audience, everyone yells it out for the big prize money.  Yes.  And I'm going to present you with $10,000 for helping me out.  Oh, you're kidding me.  So, all you've got to do right after extravadanza.  I run up just as though, I mean, no one introduces me, so I just look like I'm a fan.  No, you're going to look like a crazed fan, but I'm going to put my arms around you.  I'm going to introduce you to the crowd. 
[02:09:00]  Okay.  And, you know, it's for, you know, Disney, Visa, and extravadanza.  Oh, I can do that.  And don't, you know, you can tell your family and stuff, but we want to keep it secret from  the audience.  Okay.  Okay, that's it.  All right, Joan.  I will not be shy.  And I'll see you right after the show.  Okay.  Thank you, Tony.  Take care.  Thank you, Joan.  It's my pleasure.  No, my pleasure.  Okay. 
[02:09:30]  I'm going to give it to Eric.  Give the phone to Eric.  Okay.  All right, Eric.  Here's the deal.  You've got to, like, convince her.  So, tell her, you know what you have to do.  When Tony says extravaganza.  Extravaganza.  Sorry.  Extravadanza.  Extravadanza.  Extravadanza.  She has to run from the crowd and run on stage and hug Tony.  And if she does that, she gets $10,000, but she can't tell anyone it's happening.  She's got to wait five seconds for the graphics to show.  She's got to wait five seconds.  Well, no.  By the time she gets up there.  Oh, they'll go right back.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah, it'll be crazy.  Okay. 
[02:10:00]  Eric, try to sell that, all right?  And then get out of there.  All right.  Be as serious as possible.  And no one is supposed to know.  Tell her.  Okay.  It's a new bit there.  But don't make it, like, too much of a secret where she's going to be on to it.  Just reinforce what I said.  All right.  All right.  And Tony approved this, right?  Of course Tony did.  Yeah.  Of course.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  They're just reiterating to me, you know what to do during the extravaganza when the graphic  comes up?  Because he loves giving it out of the way other people's money.  You know that, right?  So, when he does extravaganza, the graphics go up, and she's up there doing the Plinko thing. 
[02:10:30]  You know what to do, right?  You go up there and give them, and Tony's cool with it.  And she's all excited.  All right.  Great.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  You go inside.  You warm up, and you have a good time with the show, and we're going to get you backstage.  All right?  Okay.  We're good.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  We'll see you in a little while.  Bye.  Holy ass.  Oh, if I'm watching that later, and this broad does this, I'm going to crap myself.  That's just too easy.  I will crap myself.  They just are so thrilled to death that they are talking with Tony Danza that he can say 
[02:11:00]  anything to these people.  Anything.  All right.  Oh, that was so funny.  Oh, please, God.  Let that work.  Greg from Bloomfield.  Oh, man.  You jerk-offs are going to force me to watch that fucking Tony Danza show now.  Well, I hope it works.  It's an experiment.  We'll see.  It will eventually.  Eventually, it will work.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  If we have to send the intern out with a Tony Danza shirt, we have to have a Tony Danza  shirt made.  Who doesn't want one? 
[02:11:30]  Well, you know, I'd like one, too.  One with him in a Spider-Man suit with that luscious hog.  That was funny.  All right.  Well.  Wrap in.  That was great, dude.  Here it comes.  That was really good.  Another successful Tony Danza phone call.  Can't lose.  They love Tony.  It's the best of the worst.  A little surprise for everybody.  We haven't done this in a while.  Right?  No, we haven't.  And we can't tell you what it is because we want to get it done before anyone gets in 
[02:12:00]  trouble, right?  We've done it in the past.  Hey, guys.  I'm out here in the cold, pouring rain with a bunch of Tony Danza fans here.  We have Tina from Philadelphia, who is a massive Tony Danza fan.  She would love nothing more to speak to Tony.  Oh, that's wonderful.  All right.  I think Tony Danza's ready here.  I think we're ready for Tina. 
[02:12:30]  Okay.  Hang on one second.  Okay.  Here you go.  Hello?  Tina.  Hi, Tony.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing, Tina?  Good.  We love you so much.  There's eight of us.  We came all the way from Philadelphia to see you.  Hey, you know, I'm doing very well in Philadelphia.  That's great.  The show, taking off.  Getting married. 
[02:13:00]  I am so very excited.  I wanted to hear your CD.  I wanted to purchase one.  Oh, you like that?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, I've loved singing for so many years.  And, you know, God bless.  I've been able to pursue that now and put out a CD.  Oh, that's great.  I was a big fan of Who's the Boss?  Oh, Who's the Boss?  And, of course, that other show I was on.  But I still love you.  You're so hot.  Oh, does that mean Tony might get lucky? 
[02:13:30]  Nice to meet you.  Oh, you can't wait to come into the show and see.  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  Huh?  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  Oh, you're doing good.  You're doing great.  Yeah, I don't look like a complete buffoon up there.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know, because I'm pretty stupid.  No, you're not.  But you're funny.  You're funny.  It's a great show.  Hey, you watch the reruns of Taxi?  Huh?  You watch the reruns of Taxi? 
[02:14:00]  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  When I was a young guy, you know, my mule was all hard.  Definitely.  And that little guy, the little guy, the little guy on Taxi.  Danny DeVito. 
[02:14:30]  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Good friend of mine, Danny DeVito.  Yeah, he used to make us laugh so much.  He'd come in, and after a night out banging whores, he'd go, smell my finger.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're a little too risque, I understand.  But, and then the, you know, the guy that would fix the cars?  The guy that would fix the cars. 
[02:15:00]  The guy that would fix the cars.  The guy that would fix the cars.  Latke.  Latke.  Yeah.  You know, I kind of forget.  I'm getting old in my old age.  Latke, yes.  Latke.  You know, he would come in after banging whores and say, smell my mule.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right, though.  I'm so excited to see you.  You know, it's like Dr. Phil says.  You know, when you give something up, you got to replace it with something else. 
[02:15:30]  Right, right.  You know, you understand that, right?  Oh, I completely understand it.  Yeah, huh?  So, how long before they let you in?  I don't know.  We're still waiting.  Hey, do you know who's on the show today?  No.  Uh-oh.  I was hoping you'd tell me.  Because they don't tell me until the last minute.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we don't know who's on the show today.  Hey, how big of a Tony Danza fan are you?  I'm a big fan.  A big, big fan? 
[02:16:00]  I'm a huge fan.  We're all huge fans.  We have eight people.  Yeah.  That's not your CD.  Excuse me?  Could you give me a CD?  I will personally give you a CD after the show.  As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, if you let my person on the scene there, Eric,  know where you're sitting, how would you like to come backstage after the show and hang out with Tony? 
[02:16:30]  I would love it.  I have eight people with me.  Can they come, too?  They could all come backstage.  That would be awesome.  But, you know, there's a little trade-off here.  Okay.  A little trade-off.  I do for you.  You do for Tony Danza.  All right.  Do you understand?  I completely understand.  We love him.  Hello?  Here we go again.  Hello?  Do you know the kind of favor Tony needs? 
[02:17:00]  You know, it's pretty, a lot of high pressure doing a show every day like this.  You understand?  Oh, I completely understand.  And I need to relax a little bit.  You know, I need to relax.  I used to have to relax on a set of taxi and who's the boss.  And there were people that would help me relax.  Maybe you could help me relax a little bit is what I'm saying.  I'll help you relax.  You know, maybe a little back rub.  Definitely.  Would you like to give me a back rub?  I sure will. 
[02:17:30]  Maybe a little front rub.  Oh, my God.  Are you married?  Yeah, I'm getting married in March.  Yeah, well, I'll try to put a stop to that, huh?  Hey, you keep your husband happy, huh?  Yes.  Definitely.  Hey, you want to do me a favor?  Sure.  When I'm doing my monologue at the beginning of the show, would you come up on stage and 
[02:18:00]  give me a kiss?  Oh, I sure will.  I would love it.  You know, I'm starting a new segment on the program, and I like having a lovely young lady  come out on stage and give me a little peck on the cheek.  I would be honored to.  I would definitely be honored to.  Now, we need a good time for you to come out.  Okay.  And give me that little kiss on the cheek.  Okay, definitely.  Now, as soon as I walk out. 
[02:18:30]  Okay.  I'll walk out on the stage.  Okay.  And I want you to, you know, the audience is applauding because I'm Tony Danza.  Uh-huh.  And you come out, and I'll be like, oh, here's someone from the crowd, and just say, I love  you, Tony, and give me a kiss on the cheek.  Oh, that'd be awesome.  And then you go back to your seat, and I'll give you a CD, and you come back and give me  a massage.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  I'm so excited. 
[02:19:00]  And so am I.  Thank you.  I won't ruin it by saying anything else.  All right.  I look forward to seeing you on stage at the beginning of the show.  I sure will.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  God bless.  Thank you very much.  God bless you, too.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys.  Eric.  Hey, we have the head of security here.  He's right next to me.  He wants to confirm that this isn't the Opie and Anthony show, that it's really Z100. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  All right.  We have somebody from the company who wants to, if you want to confirm it.  Oh.  Happened there.  Uh-oh.  Well.  Is there a problem?  Sounds like somebody's onto this.  Oops.  Man again.  I knew it.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Someone from the show knows the deal now.  That stinks.  Oh.  Well, I'm still going to have to watch today, and hopefully they won't talk to that woman. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, they'll talk right to her.  Do you think?  Yeah.  This is how we'll get it done.  I don't know.  Maybe Eric kept her away from the girl I was talking to.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Boy, they always think it's Tony.  They're so happy to talk to that big, dumb bastard.  Your impression is phenomenal, though.  I think it's Tony, and I'm looking at you.  Big, dumb ass.  Eric's all nervous.  He's down there in his fake Tony Danza t-shirt.  Is he wearing a fake Tony Danza t-shirt?  Yeah, he went down there with it. 
[02:20:30]  We actually had t-shirts made up.  Let's say Tony Danza show staff.  We got a Tony Danza staff t-shirt, a jacket, a hat.  He's just, yo, yeah.  We go all out for our bits.  We do it enough.  One of these days, it's going to happen.  They probably make an announcement before the show.  If Tony spoke with you on the phone, don't come running out on the stage, okay?  You fucking roost. 
[02:21:00]  Come out and give me a kiss on my car.  Duh.  Oh, wow.  She was very happy to have spoken with Tony.  You may have to just be vicious from now on, then.  If it's never going to get on stage, you may just have to keep smashing them with filth.  I know.  You know what's really funny?  She doesn't, I'm talking to her, and I bring up that Dr. Phil said, you know, if you give  something up, you've got to replace it with something.  You understand?  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Like, she's just so thrilled to talk with this idiot that she doesn't care what he's  saying.  She's just agreeing with it.  She's agreeing with anything.  We're trying to get Eric back on the line, but where'd he go?  Ben's laughing.  Ben, you can come back in.  The boss thing's over.  Jesus.  Why is Ben cackling?  I don't know, but he's got something to say.  He's in an outbreak suit, Ben.  He's just afraid.  He's being, uh, they're threatening to arrest him.  What?  Disorderly conduct.  How is that disorderly conduct?  He's the most orderly guy ever.  Then they grabbed his phone or something.  They grabbed his phone. 
[02:22:00]  Grabbed his phone.  What?  Is this going to be the first person arrested on the new Ol' B. Anthony show?  Eric.  Why can't I fucking do it?  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  Yeah, they're not letting me leave.  They're threatening to arrest me here for disordinary contact and ruining their show.  Eric, run away.  They're not cops.  Just leave right now.  Run.  Hello?  Just run away.  He's got to just run.  They don't understand. 
[02:22:30]  People don't understand.  If they're not cops, you can flee.  Run away.  Oh, Eric's going to get arrested now.  Eric's going to get arrested because he's not running away.  Like stupid Mercurio.  Run away.  Run.  Run.  They're not cops.  You can run from Danza security.  They're not going to put an APB.  Hey, call it all cars.  Call it all cars.  Look for a cute little chubby boy with frosted hair.  Car 54, where are you? 
[02:23:00]  It's the Danza police.  The Danza police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Are you kidding me?  I thought we were pretty sneaky today.  They've been just waiting for us, huh?  Pull over.  Who's the boss?  I'm the boss.  Don't make a move.  Drop the cell phone.  Well, someone has to get down there.  Oh, he's got to run.  I'll give Ben all the numbers for the record label guy, so I'll go down there.  Well, uh, disorderly conduct? 
[02:23:30]  That was the most orderly call ever.  Danny's good.  Danny, go run down there with a cell phone.  Don't get caught and tell us what the hell's going on because they took us.  Oh, wait.  Is he back?  Who's this?  Hey, it's Eric.  All right.  Eric.  What's going on?  The guy keeps smacking the phone out of my hand and closing.  He's like, I don't give a fuck who you're talking to.  He's like, if you get any...  And he's sitting here trying to take a picture and everything.  Just walk away, stupid.  I've been trying to, but the guy won't let me fucking get me, girl.  What, is he holding on to you?  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  He's not allowed to hold you.  That's assault.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the friggin' nuts.  I said, no, I just took a cab here.  And he said, well, how much you want to bet if I go through you, you got a lot.  I said, you can't go through me.  I don't know who the fuck you are.  You're not a cop.  He's not a cop.  Run away.  I'm trying to.  Break loose and run.  Break loose.  Break loose.  Use one of those...  Unbelievable.  Use a master...  Data security can't tell him not to be on the phone. 
[02:24:30]  Of course they can.  And you can talk to anybody online.  Is our guy going to get arrested with a fake Tony Danza t-shirt on?  You can talk to anybody online with a phone.  You don't want to be at the tombs with a Tony Danza show t-shirt on.  All right, well...  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with Eric.  You know, Danny can handle this, because we need you for the next segment.  Can Danny handle this, though, or should Steve go?  No, Danny can handle this.  He's good.  Just tell Danny to run there with the phone.  All right.  All right?  I got Steve's strategy.  Steve will go there.  They'll be upset.  Pull the fire alarms, because they'll see a blaze. 
[02:25:00]  And he'll be able to make good his escape.  Yeah, you weren't in Chicago overnight, were you?  No.  No, sorry.  Saw some of your clothes flying out a window.  Doing a little office work at night, were you?  How can this head of security smack his phone?  Who the fuck is this guy?  Tony Danza security.  He's a bully.  That's all he is.  He's intimidating.  I bet he's a huge black guy that just thinks he can intimidate the shit out of Eric.  And Eric's scared.  Wow.  Send me after Poe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  We really should.  We should send Poe down there.  Send Poe down there.  Oh, go in and just kick ass on the Danza set. 
[02:25:30]  No, but you know what?  If Eric is going to be hassled physically, you can't have that.  It can't happen to him.  No.  The guy could be arrested for assault right there, just holding him.  Yeah, he's grabbing him.  Just grabbing him.  He's going to be knocking the cell phone out of his head.  Absolutely not.  You'd rather go online and interview or talk to anybody you want.  There's no security guy on a sidewalk.  Well, can better somebody get Billy Mac or one of those guys on the phone?  Billy Mac.  Billy Mac.  Like, Master Poe, what's wrong?  Eric's in trouble?  Yeah, one of our guys is in trouble. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, no bullshit.  He's online in the Tony Ganda thing.  He's getting arrested.  The head of security won't.  He was just on the phone.  He wasn't doing anything.  And the head of security is like, every time he tries to call the show, the head of security  won't let him go.  And he keeps smacking his phone.  What exactly did he do?  On the phone, just with the phone, interviewing somebody on the line.  Okay.  This just in?  He got away?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Of course.  Is he running?  Yeah, he's running.  I just told him, I'm running in the middle of traffic, you know.  Just running.  You could lose him.  What did they do to him? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing.  Now you're right away.  They knocked the cell phone out of his hand.  Right?  We'll get the full report.  Okay.  Or when Eric gets back in contact with Keith.  That's bodily holding him.  No, you can't do that.  That's against the law.  You can't smack anything out of anyone.  When Sex Bagel gets back, we'll find out exactly what happened.  Dude, I really think that if he smacked the phone out of his hand, Eric should file a report.  Exactly.  There's nothing illegal about interviewing somebody on a line.  Of course not.  Why do we have to deal with cops again?  Twice already?  It's not against the law.  No. 
[02:27:00]  Eric's not a disorderly guy.  It's not against the law.  Maybe he can get free tickets for Tony.  And he's a nice guy.  He did nothing.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe's trying to lose his mind.  Look at him.  Breathe.  He's taking the legal road.  Breathe.  Don't want some praise, Poe.  Breathe.  We've got to get some boards in here that you can break when you just get pissed off.  We should contact Keith because, honestly...  Well, we'll find out as soon as Eric gets here.  That's wrong.  Yeah, that's wrong.  I hope he's ditching the Tony Danza t-shirt where Master Poe ditched the bloody gi.  The bloody gi in a dumpster.  That'd work.  Ditch the evidence. 
[02:27:30]  Eric, if you're listening to us, ditch the evidence.  How is he listening to you?  He doesn't have a...  Maybe he has a mindfire.  I don't know.  All right.  Jeez, man.  Well, we'll find out what happens when he gets here, okay?  Okay.  All right, Poe.  Breathe.  Breathe for us, okay?  Poe's very pissed off right now.  Eric running down the street.  Your mom's fine!  All right.  He got the word in.  Great.  Man, they've been waiting for us.  We've been wondering.  We were being set up.  We were being lulled into a false sense of security.  You heard how sneaky we were.  We didn't tell anyone.  We just went to it real fast.  He's there with the dopey shirt on. 
[02:28:00]  You know that pissed them off.  Too bad.  It's not illegal.  You can wear whatever the hell you want.  This is the Tony Danza show.  But why they ask if you were the other radio station.  I guess it's okay if Z100 does it, but not us.  Because Z100 isn't going to say things like Tony needs his cock sucked.  I think it might have been what I was gathering there.  They think Eric was saying he was with the Opie and Anthony show, but he was really with Z100.  Z100, so they wanted to know who was really at the bottom of this so they could get them in trouble.  So they were trying to get Z100 in trouble, thinking it was Z100. 
[02:28:30]  That's what I think.  There you go.  You don't?  You know?  Maybe.  No, you might.  I don't think they have a relationship with the Z100.  They may have gotten wind.  I think they thought Eric was lying and saying it was Opie and Anthony.  I think Eric panicked and said, I'm with Z100.  Oh, you think Eric did that?  Of course he did.  Or a misrepresentation of himself.  Would you say you were with Opie and Anthony on the line?  They probably went, who are you here with?  You know, some douchebag security guy.  Yeah, he does do that to get out of trouble.  Oh, yeah, and he figures out what's the faggiest radio station, so maybe they'll have some sympathy for me.

[02:33:30]  Oh, wild, Bill.  Well, can't top what we just heard.  Oh, yeah, you can.  No, this can.  Bill is certifiably insane.  Yeah.  I heard this yesterday.  I don't understand it.  I don't get it.  I like this one.  No, you don't.  You didn't hear it.  I meant Bill's body.  Fucking, you really have a gay hustler body.  Jesus.  The cast of Cruisin'. 
[02:34:00]  You should be muscling John Voight off your turf.  That fucking full head of hair you have.  My God, son.  My God, man.  Hey, everyone.  So what's the deal?  I guess your new name is Wild Bill?  Yeah, that's the thing that Steve made for me in the opening, so I guess that's my name now.  All right, Wild Bill, everybody.  Wild Bill's coffee shop.  All right, and you made a little bit of production.  Yeah, after a long string of production.  By the way, did we get the audio of the valedictorian getting censored? 
[02:34:30]  What happened?  That was a huge story today.  I hope so.  The valedictorian started talking about religion or whatever, wanted to talk about religion,  something like that, and she was censored.  Who censored her?  I don't know.  Do we have the audio of that story?  Maybe for tomorrow?  Good.  It doesn't belong in the schools.  Well, I want to hear what it's all about.  Get out.  Maybe, you know.  Jesus.  Yeah, we should have had that one today.  Is that her?  We can't get them all, but we should have had that one today.  She can say anything she wants. 
[02:35:00]  All right, Wild Bill production.  She said something about Christ and how the Jews spoil everything.  Yeah, maybe that was the speech.  When the Jews killed our Lord.  I wonder if they would edit something, censor something that was praising Islam.  I don't think they would.  I wonder if it was a black student praising Islam or I converted to Islam and it helped me.  Oh, boy, you wouldn't say that.  I wonder if that would have been censored.  It would still be going on.  By the way, where's our make good?  It doesn't exist. 
[02:35:30]  Elo was supposed to call the show today with the make good.  All right, Wild Bill, what's this all about I'm about to play?  Okay, so after a long while of writing promos that were kind of simple and nothing crazy and a bunch of promos, they got censored.  They weren't really exercising your creativity.  Bill, did you want to rethink that statement?  Censored by us, guys?  I don't mean crazy.  I mean original.  Wait, wait, wait.  Censored by us?  Oh, remember there were two that got in paper form to you guys and you turned them out.  Oh, we didn't run with them.  Yeah, Anthony's censoring Wild Bill and Wild Bill doesn't like it. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, so don't shoot me first.  Yeah, just like the TV.  Bill's the valid dickheadian.  Are you talking about the script of me and Opie meeting when we were kids?  No.  That was a good one.  What script are you talking about?  I'm talking about the how to make your own wow sticker promo.  Oh, yeah, the one that told people.  I'm like, I can't even repeat it because it basically gave detailed instructions on how to make poisonous gas.  No, it gave detailed instructions on how to make a cleaner that cleans extra good. 
[02:36:30]  If inhaled would kill whoever used it.  He's mixing certain cleansers that kill people yearly when they mix them together.  Are you insane?  Do you know anything about broadcasting?  No.  And like what you can be held liable for in certain situations?  Well, I thought as long as I play ignorant, I can always say I never knew.  And then, therefore, I would go through at least once.  Well, you're playing very well.  And then there was the promo where Steve had a ghost in his house, which didn't work. 
[02:37:00]  I don't remember.  I encourage Bill to be as creative as humanly possible, but he does come back with some crazy stuff most of the time.  So I tend to shoot them down.  Understandably.  I don't get angry or whatever.  No, you shouldn't.  You shouldn't.  Let's get to the Wild Bill Productions for today.  So what is the thing we're about to play?  It started out as an inside joke in the back where I made a joke about Steve and I doing a show.  And no one thought it was a good idea and told me how bad an idea was.  So then I wrote this about it. 
[02:37:30]  And it takes a shot at something that Nathaniel and Sam are doing.  The Sam and Than show or the Fan and Sam show.  Ew.  So you might have to explain this?  I don't know.  I don't know what first or second name means or anything.  Your first?  Yes.  The Fan and Sam show?  That figures.  That's not real.  I feel you, Sam.  Nothing can be that off.  I'm Than.  I'm Than.  Yeah.  Are you?  Sam's accent.  I listened to the Fan and Sam show.  I'm sorry.  Sam's accent, which is I don't know where it's from. 
[02:38:00]  It's not only the voice.  It's kind of like this and stuff.  But he's got an accent on some words that are – it's distracting.  It's horrifically distracting.  Does he mean to have it?  I don't – no.  He doesn't.  Ask her.  Yeah.  Miss, could you step up to that mic?  Hi, Sam.  Samantha.  Sam, where are you from?  I was born in New York.  What part?  Westchester.  Upstate?  No, not at all.  The first time I've ever been upstate is when I went to school up there. 
[02:38:30]  Because you said something.  God, I wish I could remember what the word or the line was that was like, this guy's  like from Maine or something.  It sounded like you were from Maine.  No, I don't know exactly where my accent comes from.  Exactly where my accent – that was it.  It's like, I don't know exactly where my accent is from.  That's the upstate New York twang.  That's the –  Turning tragedy to comedy.  He sounds like what would happen if Louis Anderson raped the black guy from Revenge of the Nerds. 
[02:39:00]  Lamar.  And it could happen.  Sure it has.  I pop lock, do you?  Yeah, so it's just something with that voice.  Wow.  I don't know what it is.  The contrast, the fans, you know, very low-key delivery.  And your accent is just –  I think that's a strength.  Wow.  Equals radio call.  Yeah.  I guess so.  Well, now we're going to have to play.  Because I was listening.  I couldn't tune away.  We're going to have to play some clips from the Than and Sam show. 
[02:39:30]  That's why we had a –  The Sam and Than show.  That's why we had a problem with Bill coming to the table with some promo that he just decided  to make up that nobody –  I didn't bring it up.  Steve just brought up you guys' show.  And let me tell you –  No, no.  Mine was a no-one.  Now Than and Sam have a problem with his bit that we're going to hear now because it  takes an under – it's an underhanded little jab at their show.  Right?  Yeah.  It wasn't necessarily a jab, but the idea was –  It was a jab.  Who's the button pusher as far as this show goes?  I am.  Than is.  Than is? 
[02:40:00]  All right.  So it should be Than and Sam.  Than is.  Right.  Whoever pushes the buttons.  Because they are the ones that get top billing.  Hmm.  All right.  Are we ready to play this?  Have we set this bit up enough?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  More than.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production.

Hello.  Anyone home?  Hello.  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, condo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner. 
[02:41:00]  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again.  What?  I kind of like that.  I kind of like it.  That would imply that you understood it. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I did.  I did.  In their sleep?  Yeah.  Gilligan.  What, like, how did it turn into a Gilligan's Island?  Steve's acting is abominable.  Thank you.  The best part of it was how bad Steve's acting was.  But he's not being, like, over-the-top awful.  He's like, my God, what happened to your parents?  Yeah.  Oh.  He's like, what's my motivation?  Oh, yeah, don't get fired.  What are you doing in my house?  Can we please hear fucking this abominable?  Can we hear Ed Wood fucking? 
[02:42:00]  You know what?  New bit, though.  We're going to have to hear another one now.  Yeah, I think we are.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill production.  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Fan and Sam Show, XM202 is proud  to present a new Opie and Anthony spinoff, a program that will surely take the radio world  by storm, announcing Steve C. and his best friend Bill.  Starring Opie and Anthony's own Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the Intern, 
[02:42:30]  who is sensible, articulate, and certainly not crazy.  I didn't write that down.  Hello?  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Hold on.  Can you pause that for a second?  You're in my fucking house.  First of all, how did you get pissed off from that fucking mundane, what are you in my house?  Yeah.  He didn't sound pissed off.  He sounded like he was wondering why you were in his house like any normal, but it's 
[02:43:00]  not like, what the fuck are you doing in my house?  And you, you know, get upset.  It's, why are you in my house?  And Bill's acting beyond stinks.  The knocks are all off.  40 minutes later, hello, hello, hello.  It's horrid.  I love Steve's broadcasting voice.  He has a broadcasting voice.  When he's home in his condo.  You're in my fucking house.  You sing-song boob. 
[02:43:30]  Crazy.  You're sort of building awful locks.  Hello, anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  Talking over the locks.  Well, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  Pause that right there.  Yeah, yeah.  That stupid, exasperated pause. 
[02:44:00]  I guarantee you, your eyes closed like this.  And your head shook to the left when you did that.  Like you were really talking to her.  No, no, honey.  Just go inside.  It might have.  Nothing's going on.  I was trying to get into the mood.  Just stay in the living room.  He's in my fucking house.  What am I pissed off at?  You're in my fucking house.  And now, a studio full of prizes.  They can all be yours.  No, no, no.  Just go inside.  I'll take it.  Grr. 
[02:44:30]  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was very believable.  It stinks, and I don't like it.  Wait, can we hear Steve's living room comment with his wife again, please?  Jim, you've saved this, by the way.  We were going to just throw it away.  No, no, no, no, just go inside.  Just the pause.  Dramatic pause.  No problem.  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out now.  I can't. 
[02:45:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Bill, get the fuck out now.  Get the fuck out.  No.  Clinch teeth.  I don't want my father bothered anymore.  Steve, clenching his teeth, says,  That was improv.  Well, that was really emotions rolling.  You're in my fucking house.  I'll handle it.  My fucking roots.  It's broad range.  Yes.  From awful to horrible to terrible.  That's really what I was going for.  Fucking Bill's all, how do you fuck up a knock?  He's like,  Hello.  Ah, hello, hello, hello. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, before the knock.  Hello.  Well, believe it or not, it was actually, I didn't knock.  Not.  It's a sound thing, but I wanted.  I don't believe it.  I want to.  It couldn't be so.  I wanted to be walking in knocking, you know, like a sitcom.  Of like the wacky neighbor just walks in.  Yeah, exactly.  Like Kramer.  Then have a door creak that you walked in.  Yeah.  Don't just like, you know, knock all willy nilly.  I'm sorry.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Living room, I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out now.  I can't leave. 
[02:46:00]  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again.  Wait, go back a little bit.  Go back a little bit to Steve's line, please.  Steve just threw his headphones.  Okay.  Where he gets all serious.  Hold on, no.  Just let me, is Steve's line queued up?  I don't know.  Wait, make sure it's cute.  Parents just died, and you're my legal guardian. 
[02:46:30]  Okay.  Steve, what do you think about that promo you just did?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, please isolate that.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible, but I'm sorry.  You're my legal guardian.  That's terrible. 
[02:47:00]  I'm sorry.  Perfect description of reacting in this.  In their sleep?  Bill again.  All right, Phil, what's with the delivery on in their sleep?  Like, what was the?  Well, it was supposed to just kind of end, like, for some reason I was at his house, and  then he goes, Bill again, and hits me.  But then Steve's like, oh, why don't you have it, uh, you murdered them.  I'm like, I don't know, that's over the top.  Yeah, you can stab them in them. 
[02:47:30]  Like, I'm like, and then I kind of set off the cuff, I'm like, oh, in their sleep?  He's like, yeah, that's good.  So we kind of went with that for a reason.  But why with the delivery?  Like, in their sleep?  Yes.  Why that?  And I don't like the fact that you have hair like Bill Macy in fucking Boogie Nights.  You sound like Cousin Brucie.  My wife has an ass in her cock.  Bill again?  Cousin Brucie there.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  In their sleep, cousins.  Like, I'm trying to hold back, like, the truth, you know, like.  Oh, there's a.  Oh, wait, I didn't, you know, now that we know the motivation. 
[02:48:00]  There's a different, that's, you're lying.  So you went, in their sleep?  Sleep?  Like, as opposed to I murdered them.  You sound like a cartoon dog.  Oh, see.  Scooby-Dooby douche.  Yeah, you know something?  Your delivery.  Brr.  Your delivery didn't really put that across.  Like, that you were lying about a murder or something and covering it up within their sleep because it sounded too goofy.  No one lies like that.  I wanted a whole spectrum of emotion throughout that. 
[02:48:30]  It should have been something, you know, more, you know, like.  O.J. didn't say I was in the shower.  Yeah.  Next one.  But, yeah, thanks.  That was pretty good.  Good first effort.  Yeah.  We look forward to the next one.  And Steve's acting in that.  Oh.  Just.  Oh, get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out.  All right, we got to go.  We got to go home.  It's the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Do you want to hear Steve's awful acting, Jimmy? 
[02:49:00]  Yes, I do.  Oh, who doesn't?  Will this wake you up a little bit?  Oh, yeah.  Are they watching him sleep on Pal Talk?  I'm tired.  Yeah.  Yeah, he should be on that.  All right.  This is from Wild Bill Productions.  Bill the intern.  We weren't even going to play this, but then we noticed.  Bill's a boob.  Then we noticed that Steve's acting is horrific, and now it's just become part of Opie and Anthony folklore.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production. 
[02:49:30]  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Fan and Sam Show,  XM202 is proud to present a new Opie and Anthony spinoff,  a program that will surely take the radio world by storm,  announcing Steve C. and his best friend, Bill,  starring Opie and Anthony's own Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the intern,  who is sensible, articulate, and certainly not crazy.

[02:50:00]  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  All right, listen.  This is so good.  Oh, sing song, jizz bag.  It gets better every time you hear it.  What's my problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  By the way, Bill's acting is very believable as the psycho.  Bill's kind of good as the psychopath.  Yeah, definitely.  He's stealing the scene.  He can't quite get the words.  He's spinning.  He's a fucking fuck.  He's like a drunk lunatic, which is what he is. 
[02:50:30]  Let's go back there.  Not really a stretch.  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?

[02:51:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again.  Bill, Bill is fucking crazy.  Yeah.  The concept for that is just like the ramblings of a mad person.  What is it?  In their sleep? 
[02:51:30]  And then the Gilligan's Island music?  What was Steve's other line?  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How did they die?  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  My favorite parts is the sing song, you're in my fucking house.  Who knows?  That and the...  Stay inside.  I'll handle this.  He's just got...  He's a flatlining idiot.

How calm is that?  Bill, let the fuck out now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again!  That is so good. 
[02:53:00]  I could listen to that all day.  Steve is awful.  Keep that close.  Everybody goes, I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  There's a criminal in his house.  I'll handle it.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  What's my motivation?  To put everyone to sleep.  Okay.  You're in my fucking house.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[02:53:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It just stinks.  Steve sucks.  That acting was just DOA.  I just want to yell, I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  And you know, Steve talks with his hands upside down, pointed upwards, almost like he's, picture  someone carrying a Yule log with no log in their hands.  That's how his hands are always, and he kind of shuffles them back and forth, dumbly. 
[02:54:00]  And you know that's how he was actually doing it?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Luke, like he's fondling breasts.  Yeah, like he's got two big balls, one in each hand.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You're in my fucking house.  I'll handle it.  They couldn't have gotten through that in one take.  Are there outtakes?  Oh, please tell me.  Come on.  Please tell me there's outtakes. 
[02:54:30]  There's got to be outtakes.  Go through that folder.  All right.  Derek's going to look later.  Make sure he doesn't delete them.  All right.  Bastard.  We'll take another break.  We'll get it.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  Let's do it again.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  Okay, one more time.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  That was the best version they had.  That was the best takes.  I like this one because there's a little stuttering.  That's terrible.  Sounds so natural. 
[02:55:00]  This is how he reacts to the parents died in the garden.  My parents died.  This is his reaction.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Way to show some feeling.  I love how bad that is.  He should be doing Shakespeare in the rest area.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you shut up?  Ah, they're back.  Back with a vengeance.  What an ass on her.  How's he going to eat?  How's he going to have almonds? 
[02:55:30]  You want to fuck a chicken?  There's a chicken.  Sticking it.  That would be wonderful.  Holy shit.  Whoa, whoa, hey, calm down.  He is all about the ass.

[03:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Like that in your promo.  There's nothing wrong with the way I talk if you're not offended.  And now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  How did your parents die?  Anthony, we got some propaganda audio.  Yes.  This was the stuff to rally the troops, rally the nation.  Back in the olden days.  It was heard on regular radio.  Back when they smoked luckies.  That was a really funny bit yesterday. 
[03:00:30]  So the first song we're going to hear is Remember Pearl Harbor,  better known as Wipe the Jap from the Mat.  Can you imagine if we did this today?  The outrage that would be out there?  Why can't we put out an Iraqi song where we sing about how we got to, you know,  kill the towel heads?  Because these were popular songs.  These weren't just niche things that were recorded that people were like,  oh, that's awful.  This rallied the nation.  There's one from the Andrews sisters.  See?  Very popular. 
[03:01:00]  Didn't get much bigger than that back in the day.  And they have a song called You're a Sap, Mr. Jap.  So many things rhymed with Jap back then.  So easy to write a song.  You're a sap, Mr. Jap.  All right.  Let's listen to just a piece of Remember Pearl Harbor.  Wipe the Jap from the Mat.  Remember Pearl Harbor, 
[03:01:30]  when you sight down the bell of your gun.  Remember Pearl Harbor,  never stop till you drop everyone.  Give them bomb for bomb,  give them shell for shell,  kill a hundred rats for every boy that fell.  Remember Pearl Harbor,  wipe the Jap from the Mat. 
[03:02:00]  Give them hell.  Brush, brush, brush your teeth.  Brush.  Oh, sorry.  It sounded like that.  Lifted up.  Awaitpies.  Lay so peacefully.  Wipe the Jap are so terribly.  Down on the wide blue sea.  A warrior isle of sunshine.  Lay so peacefully.  Then from the sky without warning yet,  the vultures swarmed to attack. 
[03:02:30]  Hiding behind their peace talk,  they stabbed our boys in the back.  Remember Pearl Harbor Every hour, every day that we live  Remember Pearl Harbor And the crime we can never forgive  Through the sweat and toil Through the blood and tears  Keep this battle crying ringing in our ears 
[03:03:00]  Remember Pearl Harbor Let the song keep us strong through the years  All right, enough of that. Remember Hiroshima?  Yeah, I think we won in the end. I think I know how that turns out.  I think we persevere and remember Pearl Harbor and barbecue a couple of hundred thousand of them.  A little more than that. A little more than that.  It's just amazing. I mean, if you had these type of songs today, the outrage. 
[03:03:30]  I know. You should do that.  All right, the next one.  Stupid insurgents. What rhymes with insurgent?  Maybe that's why there's no songs.  Give the enemy stupid names now. How the hell are you going to do that?  The next one, just a piece. We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap?  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  Of course he is.  Written by Bob Miller. Performed by Carson Robinson. 
[03:04:00]  By Carson Rob...  Typo, hopefully?  Who wrote Slap the Little Jap?  Ed Norton?  They were good. I remember they opened...  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  Yeah!  We'll skin that streak of yellow from the sneaky little fella.  And he'll think the cyclone struck him when we're through it.  We'll take that double crosser to the old woodshed. 
[03:04:30]  We'll start right on his bottom and we'll go to his head.  When we get done with him, he'll wish that he was dead.  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Uncle Sam's a man who's given a helping hand to many a foreign land.  Don't forget it.  But when somebody goes to tromping on his toes,  they'd better guard their nose or they'll regret it.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap. 
[03:05:00]  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  The Japs and all their hooey will be changed into chop suey.  And the rising sun will set when we get through it.  Their alibi for fighting is to save their face.  For ancestors waiting in celestial space.  We'll kick their precious face down to the other place.  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Goddamn Japs.  You want to go out and get them now? 
[03:05:30]  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  Yes, sir.  I wouldn't fool you, mister.  He can raise an awful blister and somebody's pants will burn before we're through it.  We'll reach across the ocean and grab that yellow Jap.  And turn him upside down right on democracy's lap.  We'll blister his axis and do it with a snap.  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Uncle Sam is mild, as peaceful as a child. 
[03:06:00]  But never get him wild or you will rue it.  So now they want to fight.  Well, they bit off quite a bite.  And Uncle Sam is going to make them chew it.  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap.  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it.  All right.  You get the idea there.  It goes on forever.  Of course it does.  I smell bit, Anthony.  I smell bit.  Yeah?  I think the listeners are talented enough to come up with some current propaganda songs. 
[03:06:30]  Ah, a little few titles for Iraq?  Yeah.  We're going to have to cracky the dirty little Iraqi?  But you have to have it sung in this fun-loving way like they did back in the day.  Back then they could dance to that.  Lovely.  I just, I don't know.  I just loved it when we were all just openly racist.  Yeah.  It was like the days.  Because we weren't even trying to hide it back then.  Who are you kidding?  We're all racist.  That yellow Jap.  Every single person that listens to this program has racism in their blood. 
[03:07:00]  I don't care if you're a black guy listening, a white guy, a trucker, a mom.  A dirty little Jap.  Or even a dirty little Jap.  We are all racist.  The problem is that we just make believe we're not nowadays.  Back then it was open.  People didn't care.  Man, I used to hang out at the Legion with my dad when he was alive.  And man, these guys would just trash each other.  Of course.  There was a Jewish guy there, a black guy there, a Polish guy, an Irish guy, an Italian.  And these guys would just go at each other's throats. 
[03:07:30]  They all walked into a bar.  Yeah, they had the best racist jokes that they just would pound each other with.  Yep.  Pound each other.  And my dad explained, this is just how it was when he was growing up.  Yeah.  The good old days when the clans just hated colors.  Remember that?  They expanded.  I remember, uh, what?  See, that's, but that's the problem.  Oh, yeah.  The bell is the problem?  But back then, no one hid behind political correctness.  Everyone was just openly racist.  Even in war now, you can't be racist, which is hysterical. 
[03:08:00]  You're over there.  You're killing people, which is good.  But you should at least, you know, be allowed to write little ditties like this.  Yeah.  They did it back then.  You know, the Japs came over and bombed Pearl Harbor, and they wrote some songs about it.  And, uh, you know, it wasn't like that nice little Asian gentleman needs a talking to.  Right.  No, it was, you know, got to slap the dirty little Jap.  Well, we have to be careful with the coverage.  We were talking about this, uh, a while ago, but it was brought up on TV the other day. 
[03:08:30]  Another suicide bomber.  Yes.  They had a big story about another suicide bomber.  And, no, it's called a, yeah, homicide bomber is what Fox News calls them.  No, are you serious?  Because they don't want to, they don't want to put the focus on the bomber.  They want to put the focus on the people that were killed.  So instead of calling it a suicide bomber, they call it a homicide bomber.  But meanwhile, any bombing that kills someone is a homicide bombing, whether the guy plants the bomb and runs away or straps it to his body and dies. 
[03:09:00]  The thing that separates it is the fact that the suicide bomber is blowing himself up.  So a homicide bombing means nothing.  A roadside bombing is a homicide bombing if it kills somebody.  Fox News, trying to be politically correct, trying to alter your viewpoint a little bit.  They don't call, they don't call, uh, Marine snipers snipers on Fox News.  They're called sharpshooters.  Yeah.  Because sniper, uh, has bad, uh, uh, stigma to it.  And they don't call them terrorists, they call them freedom fighters or something. 
[03:09:30]  Well, some of them do, uh, but maybe Al Jazeera.  Who calls them freedom fighters?  I don't know.  They call, they don't call them terrorists, they call them, uh, something.  I, uh, I'll get back to you on that.  Get back to me on that one.  Uh, ugh.  Well, you know, you go in the airport, you get checked by, by Arabs are checking me.  Really?  You know, you've never seen at the airport.  Oh, I've seen that, yeah.  You know, they're checking me to see if they have it, you know, what they're going to do.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's, ugh.  We were in L.A. in the airport, they had a sign in American, and then they had a sign 
[03:10:00]  under it in Arabic.  Why?  I'm not lying.  A big, you know, whatever, don't do this, do that.  In Arabic, an American.  That was good.  Anyone that reads it, you can see who's looking at it and sweep them right up.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Take them in the back and work them over with a phone book.  Yeah, whose eyes are going from left to right?  Yeah.  See whose eyes are going from right to left.  Or how, how do they read?  Reading that drivel.  Ugh.  How do you read that?  It's backwards, right?  Oh, they're all backwards.  It's right to left, starting from the bottom, working their way up. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know.  And then we'll get back to more of these songs.  We've got a few others.  We've got Your Sap, Mr. Jap.  I like that sap thing.  And, uh, and Goodbye Mama, I'm Off to Yokohama.  You could use that one.  Goodbye Mama, I'm Hunting Osama.  There you go.  Something like that.  I'm feeling a bit, though.  I'm smelling it.  I'm smelling the bit.  What is Patty doing?  Brand new propaganda song.  It's the best of the worst.  Some will be an Anthony.  You were laughing at something. 
[03:11:00]  I didn't mean to laugh out loud.  It was probably something so funny that you just couldn't contain yourself.  The funny papers.  I don't know how people don't read the comics.  This one's, this is Marmaduke.  And, uh, the dog's in a police car, and the caption reads,  No, you can't blow the siren.  Ha, ha, ha.  And Marmaduke must have been asking.  Does anyone read those things?  That's it?  That's, uh.  That was it, huh? 
[03:11:30]  No, you can't blow the siren.  Ha, ha, beetle belly.  It's just, it's great.  How do you drive?  There's two captions in the beetle.  Because Theorella, Theorella, LaGuardia, right?  Or Theorella, whatever it was.  Theorella, LaGuardia.  Whatever, LaGuardia.  Yeah.  Who would he read the funny papers to when there was a problem, right?  Yeah, yeah, he would get on the news, on the radio,  and read the funny papers when there was a,  I believe there was a strike or something.  Yes.  And, yeah.  This is, uh, this Beetle Bailey one.  This is two, two little caps here.  And this one, this Beetle, he's opening a Vox. 
[03:12:00]  And he, ha, ha, ha, ha, new racket.  Sarge won't be able to hit one past this baby.  And in the next caption, it's a big tennis racket.  And he goes, help me lift it, will ya?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Sarge is never going to get one past that one, but he can't lift it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, because it's a big racket.  Ah, Beetle. 
[03:12:30]  I get it.  Ah, read Herman.  I don't even get Herman.  Where's Herman?  Hermans are always funny.  Herman right to the right of, uh, Beetle Bailey.  Okay, it's one caption.  It's two older people in the romance section of a bookstore.  Uh-oh, racy.  And she's reading something, and the older gentleman says,  Want to go see a movie, baby?  That's Herman.  I don't get that at all.  I don't get it.  But I don't get it. 
[03:13:00]  I didn't get the Herman.  Read Flight Deck.  This is Jimmy's new bit, and I love it.  Well, Flight Deck is pretty funny.  It's got a woman with weird hair and two guys sitting on the side of her,  and the one guy goes,  Don't you find it a little strange,  a Chinese restaurant named Unlucky House. 
[03:13:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, come on.  The people have to understand what you're saying.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Don't you find it a little strange,  a Chinese restaurant named Unlucky House,  and the other guy goes,  No, this place is great.  I see what your misfortune cookie says.  It doesn't say that.  It does.  No, this place is great.  See what your misfortune cookie says.  I just said that. 
[03:14:00]  You said, I see.  Oh, okay, but it's still the misfortune cookie.  Of course.  Of course.  Misfortune instead of fortune.  My favorite, though, of all time has always been the Lockhorns.  All right.  Oh, they are so funny.  Let's go to the Lockhorns.  That old couple that's been together for years.  Okay.  Jimmy?  Are you going to make me try to get through this one?  Yeah.  All right.  In the, uh...  In this one,  she walks in, 
[03:14:30]  and there's a crib,  and there's a little lump laying in it,  and it looks like red stuff on the side,  and she says,  Honey,  what happened to the baby?  and he says,  I fucked you to death.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I love those Lockhorns. 
[03:15:00]  I don't...  Did you get a different version of the paper?  I...  I...  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony  must pause for a break.  Diddle until your privates turn raw.

[03:18:30]  Paul from Toronto, Canada writes,  I have a 97 Mercury Sable wagon.  I have a minimal heat coming through the heater vents.  I replace the thermostat and the radiator is hot.  The heater hoses are hot one side, cold the other.  What's wrong?  Paul, the late 90s Taurus and Sable vehicles  have a problem with the coolant rusting and plugging up the heater core.  When the core rusts up, coolant flow is inhibited  and little or no hot water flows through the core to produce heat.  You can attempt to backflush the heater core to see if this helps break the rust loose. 
[03:19:00]  I would first try to flush it one way, then the other.  If this doesn't work, the heater core will have to be replaced  and this requires disassembly of the instrument panel  to gain access to the HVAC box where the heater core is housed.  Got a question?

I've been betting a Negro!  Hey, let's hope you don't see it right now.  This shit's pretty good.  And now, the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy!  Hello?  Jimmy!  Hi, Jim.  Am I on the radio?  Yes.  I'm walking to the restroom. 
[03:24:00]  Hey, is Frank the frowner with you?  Yeah, why?  I had to go to the bathroom, and I couldn't wait.  Oh, there's the door.  I need...  Excuse me, son.  Could you get me the key?  There's a young boy in Poe's office.  He should have...  Do you know it takes more muscles to frown than it's a smile somebody once whispered to me?  He's telling everybody that little factoid.  Oh, no.  He's running out of air as he does it.  He's such a creep. 
[03:24:30]  He really...  Thank you, sir.  Isn't he terrible?  He's an uncomfortable creep.  Man, hold the bathroom door for me.  Now let's listen to Jimmy.  This is so disgusting.  I'm not ready yet.  It's going to make me puke.  Oh, he's got to do his little ritual.  Clean the seat off.  You don't clean your chest off, but you'll clean the seat off.  Yeah, no kidding.  There's hairs on it, too.  It's not about...  This isn't inconsistencies.  There's hairs all over the seat.  Hairs on the seat. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, little curly ones, too.  I'm not kidding.  You can hear his little belt buckle jingle.  No, that's...  I'm just carrying toilet paper off.  Hey.  Can you take a dump as Frank the Frowner?  But don't do it during the dump.  I know.  Believe me.  I promise.  I won't spoil it.  What does that mean?  Hold on.  Now you'll hear some urine.  Wait a minute.  I'm still getting dressed up.  If you drop your phone, I'll be so happy.  Hold on.  Fuck.  Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. 
[03:25:30]  A new Kiss coffee house is opening up.  Coffee with Attitude.  Wonderful.  Hold on.  Hold on one second.  Another way to milk this audience.  Hold on.  Oof.  He looks like my aunt.  He really does.  He really does.  Oh.  Fucking mod.  They actually don't use coffee filters.  They just pack his chest hair into the bottom of the coffee pot.  Filtered through his chest hair. 
[03:26:00]  Jimmy?  Oh.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Is that what that was?  Yeah.  Keep listening.  There's more?  There might be.  I don't know.  Where's the guy next to me?  Hold on.  Oh.  It's next to him.  Oh!  Oh!  Just listen and enjoy. 
[03:26:30]  Oh!  It's crackly good.  It's like Rice Krispies.  The guy next to him keeps flushing.  We leave you this Sunday morning with the sounds of a men's room. 
[03:27:00]  Here we go.  Oh!  Bob's, Bob's, Bob's leaving and he's gagging.  Bob's puking.  Oh, that's the glory.  Bob's puking.  Bob's left the studio.  Bob had to leave.  Holy shit.  Actually sounds like his act.  He puked into the garbage pail and now he's, he's over another garbage pail outside the studio.  It's that, that crispy sound that gets a, that gets him. 
[03:27:30]  A little more.  A little more.  Wow.  He's, uh, taking a leak.  It's something coming out of somebody's asshole.  That's usually the way it works.  I don't know why I find it so funny. 
[03:28:00]  How can you listen?  When things disgust me so much, but this, for some reason, I find funny.  Jesus, what are you doing?  You're pissing like a bitch.  Oh.  Oh, you, you hear?  Is he done shitting?  No.  Phew.  Oh boy, that was a good one.  Are you done?  Tell him I'm done. 
[03:28:30]  You're done?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's done.  That's the grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Alright.  He put the headphones back on right when you did that.  Tell him to put them on again.  Alright.  It's done, Bob.  He's done.  He's, he's already, just say yes open when it's done.  He's already wiped.  So, he's done. 
[03:29:00]  Yes.  He's puking.  He's puking.  If you're going to puke, puke in here.  You know the rules.  This is that funny.  You know the rules.  Puke in here.  It is so goddamn immature, but I can't stop laughing at that.  He ran out of the studio.  He's like, he's puking.  You are just full of everything. 
[03:29:30]  Bob, what's wrong?  Yeah.  Jimmy, you're just about done?  I am actually.  You're done?  I'm going to say yes.  Bob, come here.  He's done.  I'm not sure if I'm done yet, but I'm going to try.  He's really done.  He's just the last tinkle.  He did.  Don't fuck me on this, dude.  He did the last tinkle.  How are we going to fuck you on this?  How long can the guy possibly shit for us? 
[03:30:00]  When you were out of the studio, we said, are you done?  Right.  And he said, I'm done.  All right.  So you weren't even in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking nasty.  Yes.  Yes.  What?  What the fuck is that?  That was the dog just barked.  What the fuck was that?  What was that?  What is he doing?  Is he strangling himself?  Jimmy, what are you doing?  He's pushing. 
[03:30:30]  Auto-erotic asphyxiation.  I'm making what they call a Macmillan sandwich.  Don't strain.  Don't strain.  Oh, those fucking dirty sinuses.  I know.  Dave C. from New York City, McReevey and wife.  Anything, Jim?  I'm not sure. 
[03:31:00]  Okay, I think so.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Mm-hmm.  I'll let you know.  Okay.  I don't want to interrupt.  What's that?  Fuck.  I think I'm done.  Good.  All right?  Yeah, I'm done, I think.  You're done?  I think so.  Are you sure?  There's something still in there I'm trying to manipulate.  All right.  Are you sure you're done?  I'm using digital manipulation. 
[03:31:30]  They call that the Macmillan technique.  That's right.  Where you put hands on another man's hips and help manipulate his constipation.  Where's Frank the Frowner?  There's people in the stall next to me.  I have to talk quietly.  Is there really someone in the stall next to me?  Yes, there is.  Frank, you're going to have to whisper, okay?  If the whispers, I won't be overheard.  Frank the Frowner, everyone, in the stall.  Do you know, it's very hard to whisper for me, because I tend to talk loud. 
[03:32:00]  Because of your frowning face?  I can't help, but the sounds come out differently than they're supposed to.  It makes whispering very difficult when you have a permanent frown.  Do you know, it actually takes more muscles to frown than those to smile I once received in a communique?  Monster Cloud is saying, Jim's like a fucking bird.  His piss and his shit all come out at once. 
[03:32:30]  Can we go home now?  Does he have headphones on?  Yeah, he can hear us.  Hi, Bob.  Anything you want to say to Bob?  Hey, what's up, Jim?  How are you feeling?  Are you trying to use Tai Chi to get that shit out of your ass?  Dude, dude, dude, this is the problem.  What?  Oh!  Bob's up again. 
[03:33:00]  You know the rules.  Puke in here.  Puke in here.  No, I'm not puke.  You sure you're not going to puke?  You just heard a liquid dump come out of Jimmy's ass.  Are the headphones on?  No.  Jimmy, yes, but they are.  Bob.  He's done.  He's just flushed.  He just flushed.  He's actually coming in.  God, what a fucking...  Yes.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Bob, where are you going?  You've got to promote Caroline's this weekend.  Bob.  We're out of here.  Give the big plug.  Yeah, Bob.  Bob, the big plug of Caroline's.  I got one second, dude.  I don't want to puke.  Puke.  Ugh.  You know it was just liquidy.  There you go.  See, we all heard the flush now.  There it is.  There it is.  Flush.  A lot of people want to know why Anthony's not answering Jim's ass.  Yes, I do understand it. 
[03:34:00]  Uh...  Yeah.  All right, why don't you give the big plug?  Yeah.  Caroline's.  No, no, no.  Who is...  Ugh.  Ugh.  I'm plugging while he's shitting?  It's the same thing.  Same value for your buck.  How do you fucking...  How do you plug while somebody's shitting?  Believe me.  How do you...  That's the same thing my asshole is saying about your plugs. 
[03:34:30]  What the hell is stuck in you?  You really had to go.  What is stuck in you, Jimmy?  Ugh.  Oh, here you go.  Oh, you're pissing like my grandmother.  Ugh.  A little...  A little clit.  Sounds like a little...  Ugh.  All right, he's done.  You done, Jimmy?  Jim.  I think so, yeah.  Fuck.  I'm strained. 
[03:35:00]  I'm gonna pop a blood vessel.  I'm gonna bushel...  ...op him out of his ass right now.  One at a time.  Bloop, bloop, bloop.  You ever have a bloop, bloop?  You ever have a bloop, bloop shit?  Like rabbit?  Oh, I hate that.  Drop a box of milk duds from about three feet up.  Bloop, bloop, bloop.  You know, clang.  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  I get that roid to push it out the back of my asshole.  It looks like your hand after steam hits it the next day.  Nice little steam blisters. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, Jimmy, you gotta be dumb, because we gotta go home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you killing something?  Creaky door.  He's leaving the bathroom.  Oh, is that what that is?  Oh, no.  What?  What?  What happened?  The police shit your pants.  Where are you?  In the bathroom.  Oh.  Did someone just leave?  They came in.  They came in.  Get them washing their hands.  They're washing.  Dude, ask them for toilet paper. 
[03:36:00]  Tell them you have no toilet paper.  All right.  Excuse me.  Can I trouble you for some toilet paper?  Hello?  May I trouble you for some toilet paper?  I've run out of paper.  Or paper towels, anything.  Anything.  Oh, boy. 
[03:36:30]  Oh.  Is he getting them?  I don't know.  Is he there?  Yeah.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  Oh, he's using the bathroom.  Hold on.  Oh, he's urinating.  I think so.  If he hands you a card and he's naked with his phone number on it, right when he hands you.  You've got to work up. 
[03:37:00]  He's giving me some.  I'm getting ready.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm trying.  Okay.  Okay.  You guys are getting me.  I'm here.  Yes, sir.  Oh, thank you.  He just put it there real quick and left.  He just put the roll in there.  I was trying to time it out so I could talk to him and shit while he was handing it to  me.  But he just, I just saw like a blank hand come up. 
[03:37:30]  It was like fucking, he handed me that before Nicholson buried the axe in his chest.  Holy shit.  I just heard a here.  Yeah, here.  No one wants to be spoken to by a guy in a stall.  That was a big brother, man.  That was a big brother?  Oh, wait.  What's that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Ask them for toilet paper and do the same thing.  I don't know if it's the same guy.  Who cares? 
[03:38:00]  Tell him you didn't get enough.  Someone just walked in and walked out.  Uh-oh.  My shit smell.  What happened, Mark?  What did Mark say?  I don't know.  It was a big, uh, a big brother.  Yeah, he was a big guy.  Big guy.  Oh, whatever.  I didn't ask the fuck him.  I just asked him for toilet paper.  What's that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I asked Mars.  Mars, who is that?  It's me. 
[03:38:30]  Mars, it's me.  It's me.  Who's me?  Who's me?  I don't know if I'm going to open the line.  Jimmy, you're alone.  Huh?  You're alone in the bathroom.  Who's that?  Mars.  Oh, hi, Mars.  Oh, no one in there?  No.  Damn it.  Oh, God damn, was that funny.  All right.  All right, so I thought it was kind of gross, but I had to get the, uh, the paper.  Bobby.  Yeah.  So, it's a sick pit, right? 
[03:39:00]  Dude, that's...  Please don't do it again, dude.  No, I'm actually finished.  No, dude.  Yeah, it's disgusting, dude.  It shot out of your ass.  Ah!  What the hell?  Oh!  Oh!  Come on, man.  Bob, where you going?  There's no puking in radio.  Bob, puking here.  You know the rules?  Bob!  You're puking. 
[03:39:30]  Bob!  And then, like, some bile comes up.  He gets, like, a little bit of bile that comes out.  Ah, fuck me.  Bob!  He really gets grossed out by that.  He's leaving.  Bob!  Ah, I fucking hate this.  Bob.  Fucking disgusting, man.  Get away from me.  Get away from me, both of you.  Bob!  What, what?  What's wrong?  This fucking ass just exploded in my ear. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, that's disgusting.  This sounds like a pack of firecrackers.  In the mud.  I'm wet like a dad.  In the mud.  Bob!  Bob!  Bob's working on...  Wow!  He really is puking!  He's puking in there, yeah.  I think the pal...  The pal talkers almost saw him puking.  Look out, because soon the guy with the camera is going to start puking, and then he's going  to fall on the tape, and we're going to lose all of this gold. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, and then he's not going to have a New York Times bestseller.  Right.  Bob, what happened?  Knowing it was just really just wet?  Wet and shitty and liquidy.  It's the crackling sound of the shit actually coming out of his asshole.  Yeah, I guess apparently I have a weak stomach for listening to someone's shit.  This is the longest session.  Jimmy?  Is that shit coming out of his ass?  Yes. 
[03:41:00]  All right, they're running down the hall.  He's pissing out of his ass.  Is it coming out of his dick or his ass?  They're following him down the hall with a camera and a microphone.  Bob!  What?  Come on!  Give your plug.  Give your plug.  In studio.  I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  Look at him over there.  I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend at...  Oh, you can't see him.  Thursdays and Fridays.  All right.  Jimmy?  Yeah? 
[03:41:30]  Is he done?  Yeah, he's got to be done by now.  You've got to be.  His little body can't hold this much waste.  You know what it was?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Caroline's New York City.  Headline it all weekend.  Come down to the shows.  Put Bob on the...  Bob?  I'm right here.  Bobby.  What?  It was just because, honestly, I have a smoothie and bananas.  And when I do that, it empties out everything that's been in there.  And I had a lot of meat yesterday.  Yeah.  And that's why it just sounds like a pack of firecrackers going off in mud. 
[03:42:00]  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard, dude.  Why would you shit like that?  Why can't you just shit like a regular human being?  I do.  Listen.  Don't shit again.  You know, he's...  Is he done shit?  He's got to be done.  Yeah, he's just messing with you, Bobby.  Relax.  I'm at, uh...  Should I plug it again?  Is that his ass or his dick?  What is that?  Is that coming out of his asshole?  My ass.  Is that coming out of your ass?  Yeah, he said it.  My ass.  My ass.  All sexy.  Oh, what is that? 
[03:42:30]  What is that?  What is that?  Is he a fucking...  Is he a fucking...  What is he?  Oh, you should see.  Oh, my God.  It looks like I'm...  I think I shit on my shirt.  This is fine.  You know what?  I don't even give a fuck if they come.  I'm not plugging.  This is nasty.  This is the grossest thing I've ever friggin' heard in my life.  You guys stick around for the wipe.  What wipe?  What's the wipe?  What is the wipe?  It's not a pop.  Listen. 
[03:43:00]  Shh.  Shh.  Paul, calm down.  What is that?  It's wiping.  Is that metal?  Is that metal?  That was me wiping.  Do you have metal in your ass?  No, that's the toilet paper.  The toilet paper roll.  Here it goes.  Ew.  Is that a chicken? 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  Ooh.  You all right, Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Did someone just walk in?  Mm-hmm.  Somebody's...  Someone turned the lights out on me.  The lights are off, Jimmy?  Certainly are.  What does Frank the Frowner think of that?  He doesn't light in the dark.  He has a sour stomach.  He has a sour stomach. 
[03:44:00]  My favorite food is Smarties.  All right.  Are you done?  Oh.  Ah.  I can't hear a word you're saying.  I can't hear you because...  Why?  Whoever turned off the light, I just kicked my headphones off.  Hi.  And they went into the toilet.  Whoever turned off the lights.  Ah, that makes me happy.  We have to get new headphones.  I just ran in and turned the light off in the bathroom. 
[03:44:30]  You just dropped the headphones.  You know that liquid douche who just came out of your ass?  It sounded like a baby's head just popped out of his ass.  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere.  Okay.  We're waiting.  I can't hear you.  There's a bathroom door.  Fucking inner sanctum.  I can't hear a word you're saying.  I don't know if you can hear me.  We hear you.  You dropped that. 
[03:45:00]  You dropped it.  I put my pants on.  Wait.  Your mic, I swear, just went out.  I put my pants on, and I was pulling them up, and this, the bottom, the piece was on the floor, and this fell off my fucking ear and went into the toilet.  Oh, so the ear piece went into the toilet.  There's no shit on it, but that looks like a piece of toilet paper.  Oh, God, what is that on it?  There's something on it.  Is that shit?  No, no, no shit.  What is that?  What is that? 
[03:45:30]  Yes, it's a piece of, like, bean skin.  What is that?  What are you, nuts?  Dude, don't fuck around, man.  Put it down, dude.  It's toilet paper.  Put it down.  Back away.  It's only a piece of toilet paper.  Dude, it's out of the fucking toilet bowl.  Yeah, I know.  That you just shit in.  It's in the earpiece, too.  Oh, God.  Well, this is now the guest headset.  Yeah, you.  No, I'm not using this one again.  You have to.  It's your shit.  Yeah, is it?  Have you heard of shit ear?  I haven't. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, just step on it.  Don't step on it.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Don't step on it.  He just steps on it.  Make sure they're never used again.  All right, we're going to go home now.  That's unsanitary.  You know, I once read an article.  What happens if the feces get into the human ear?  It causes death.  There's 30 different countries.  All right.  All right.  Oh, shit.  I'd say we had a fun, fun day.  It's the best of the worst. 
[03:46:30]  That will be an Anthony.  These guys are in the paper today.  Let me see if I can find it real fast.  How old are they?  I don't know.  They've been partners.  They've got to be fucking 61.  They've been partners for 60-some-odd years.  I got it.  I got it.  61-year couple says, new law, inevitable.  Thanks.  It's a whirlwind romance that has lasted more than 60 years, but with no chance at the moment  for a New York wedding.  Gus Archilla has been sucking Elmer Lockton's cock for 61 years. 
[03:47:00]  Gus, and he's bummed that they are the city's longest-standing gay couple, and they're kind of bummed out they can't get married.  Do you realize that when they're fucking, one guy is yelling, oh, Elmer, and the other guy is going, oh, Gus.  Elmer and Gus.  Suck it, Gus.  Put it in my ass, Elmer.  Put some of that glue on my back.  You know that they're fucking, they've tried every verbal thing. 
[03:47:30]  Use my mouth like a bus, Gus.  They'd love to cap their relationship with a legal wedding in New York, the two said yesterday, as they shared stories of their courtship and life together.  I just caught his eye and smiled, Archilla said, describing their first meeting.  On a parkway rest area?  Parkway?  There weren't even parkways.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Are you ready for the biggest douche chill of the day?  Archilla, 90, said he spotted Lockins, better known as Elmer, a newly arrived Army soldier from the Heartland, 
[03:48:00]  marveling over the soapbox preachers in Columbus Circle on a September evening in 1945.  Wonderful.  1945.  Newly arrived soldier from the Heartland?  Let's see.  Read what Lockins, 87, said.  I never saw anyone as pretty as he was.  There's something to be said for that deviant lifestyle, these two bastards.  They are old. 
[03:48:30]  Certainly are.  They're probably still fucking.  Every time he pulls his cock out, he like pink sleeves from the asshole and the guy's prostate is on it.  90 and 87.  They just shit while they're fucking.  No idea.  Suck it, Elmer.  Give me that cock, Gus.  Oh, Gus.  Come on, Elm.  Come on, Elm.  Elm.  Yeah, short. 
[03:49:00]  Gives him the old Roman war helmet.  Smell my asshole, Gus.  Because he knows what one really looked like.  Yeah.  That's right.  Bomb me like a Jap, Elmer.  Let's play World War II.  You lay down.  I'm not even going to try it.  I already said low down.  Let's play World War II.  Backing off.  Your asshole is England, and I'm going to blitzkrieg it.  I'm going to come in your mouth, Elmer. 
[03:49:30]  Good for Gus and Elmer.  60 what?  60 years?  61 years together.  61 years.  Gus and Elmer.  Gus is 90.  Elmer is 87.  You know that they probably can't get erections anymore, so they have to just finger each other's assholes?  And they're probably so old, they just eat bread right after.  They don't even notice anything.  Arthritic, knobby knuckles.  Yeah.  They doze off.  They have your asshole fingered.  He fuck.  His fingers are ribbed for Elmer's pleasure. 
[03:50:00]  What are they going to do when one of them dies?  The other guy's not going to go out and find any new dick.  Go to a bathhouse.  They're going to fuck your old bag hanging down.  Like something like a Monty Python film.  Trying to meet some hot young cock.  I met Garthrit, did ya?  I get sliced by some fucking tranny with a box cutter dipped in fucking garlic.  Alright, let's not...  Irrelevant old cocksuckers.  They just want to be happy, Jim. 
[03:50:30]  Do they?  They've been happy for 61 years.  Since that fine meeting in 1945.  In Columbus Circle.  I never saw anyone as pretty as he was.  That's not going to disgust 95% of the country.  Gus.  Elmer.  Oh, Elmer.  You like that cock, Elmer?  You like that cock, Elmer?  Fuck me, Gus.  Fuck my mouth, Gus. 
[03:51:00]  Hey, Gus.  Why don't you come over here and put your cock in my ass?  Yeah, we should get some of that old-time music.  Oldie time.  Oldie time music.  Maybe we could get a bit out of this today.  Hey, Elmer.  Why don't you come over here?  We'll light up a couple of luckies.  Maybe sit at the bar and have a...  Well, we'll invent the Cosmopolitan.  Ha, ha, ha.  And then you'll come back to my pad.  And we'll fuck each other in our asses. 
[03:51:30]  Come on, Gus.  Oh, fuck Elmer.  Come here.  Fuck me in the ass.  Mmm.  Look at that.  Look at this.  It's a brand new product just introduced.  It's called the Jabalog.  Easy.  It smells like coffee.  Easy.  Sort of takes the edge off Elmer's asshole.  Easy.  Light up a lucky.  Blow smoke rings into my ass.  Oh, Elmer.  Elmer. 
[03:52:00]  Feels so good.  Elmer.  Look what I've concocted.  A bikini-tini.  Easy.  Randu.  We sure are ahead of our time, aren't we, Elmer?  Easy.  We certainly are, Gus.  Couple of fucking faggots.  Oh, Gus.  Gus, come on.  Fuck me like a Negro.  See, it's a joke.  The Negroes got fucked back then. 
[03:52:30]  Get it?  Okay.  The best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  God almighty, I challenge you to not vomit.  Radio for dummies.  Opie and Anthony.  Time for the Power Shift Minute.  The latest from the world of motorsports.  Here's Joe Costello.  Nextel Cup veteran Ricky Rudd is back in the saddle as Robert Yates Racing brings the rooster 
[03:53:00]  out of retirement to help his team in 2007.  Master Foods USA will sponsor the car with its Snickers brand as the primary paint scheme.  The car number for Rudd has not yet been determined.  Rudd spent three successful years with Yates Racing driving the 28 Ford.  That team combined for three victories and a fourth-place finish in the 2001 standings.  Since that point, Robert Yates Racing has hit tough times, losing Dale Jarrett to Michael  Waltrip Racing, along with sponsor UPS. 
[03:53:30]  Elliott Sadler left the team to go to Everham Motorsports, and now it's up to Ricky Rudd to  bring the team back.

[03:57:00]  Ah, Kenny, Jersey.  Yo.  What's up, Kenny?  Gangsta fag, yo.  Oh, yeah.  People want to get gangsta fag.  I got it.  All right, we got it.  The name of the band is Gangsta Fag, or the name of the rapper.  He's a black, hardcore rapper.  But he's gay.  Yeah, but he's gay, and he's proud of it, and he raps about it.  Shit.  You ever get him on the phone?  We're trying to find this guy, right?  Joe Rogan turned us on to this guy.  Yeah, Joe Rogan gave us a CD at the Poker Thing in L.A. 
[03:57:30]  when we were broadcasting from that last year.  And it's one of the favorite things we like doing on this show,  is playing some gangsta fag.  Well, favorite?  I don't know.  It's up there.  It's disturbing.  It's very disturbing, but people enjoy it out there.  Are you playing the one about the...  He wants it.  He wants it.  This is so bad.  It's so disgusting.  You want to set up the song for Patrice?  Well, it's a gangsta fag.  Well, the song's story is there's this gangsta, and he's a fag. 
[03:58:00]  Okay.  And he hooks up with this white...  I don't know.  He comes off like a businessman kind of guy.  Rich businessman.  Who's married, has kids, but he's bi-curious, I guess, and checks it out.  And once he's had a taste of the gangsta fag, he doesn't want to...  Like, he latches on to this guy and just wants him all the time.  And gangsta fag just, you know, used him as a lay.  And he intricately put this together. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  In a rap song.  In a rap song.  And it's just disturbing.  Listen.  That's it.  By the way, this will just outrage the middle of America.  The truckers will just...  They'll pull out shotguns.  It's a little bit funny.  See, I was getting high with my boys one day.  Just kicking back, hanging out in L.A.  When this dude drove by in his really funky bands. 
[03:59:00]  I could tell right away this motherfucker had his.  Was a white dude, about 30-something.  Kept staring at me, yelling like he wanted something.  He called me, yo, and he asked full directions.  I saw his dick was hard.  So I peeped this car.  I said, you lying.  You know you ain't Norse.  You want to suck my dick while I'm jacking you off.  And he said, oh no.  There must be a mistake.  I got a wife and a kid.  And I'm very, very straight.  So I said, take my never and my name.  You can call me up when you're sick of playing games.  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call.  Because if you see one fag, then you'll see them all. 
[03:59:30]  He wants him.  What the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants him.  Because if you see one fag, now you'll see them all.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you need?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants him.  Because if you see one fag, then you'll see them all.  So I knew that he'd be climbing the wall.  One week later and he finally called.  He said his family's gone for a week or two.  And he was really bored and needed something to do.  So I drove to his crib up in Beverly Hills.  A barman's house worth a couple of meals. 
[04:00:00]  He said he wasn't gay.  He just wanted to chat.  And a half hour later, he's massaging my back.  In his white room, he gave me some head.  Went in the next room and fucked on his kid's bed.  Fucked and we fucked like bitches in heat.  I came on his face and all over the sheets.  I knew that I was done when I started getting sore.  I grabbed the kid's toe and I wiped my dick off.  He's lying on the bed still trying to recover.  I'm dressed and I'm up as my conference robber.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants him.  Cause if you see one fact, then you've seen him all. 
[04:00:30]  He wants him.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants him.  Cause if you see one fact, then you've seen him all.  The thing was so good that he just couldn't pass up.  So all that week, yeah, I'm tearing that ass up.  Cause he loves to ride him and he loves to suck him.  And after I was done, I let my homeboy suck him.  Now his punk ass calls me every day.  I told him we were through, then he said he would peak.  So now twice a week, I'm getting paid to tackle.  He laced me with the cash and the visa platinum.  One month later and the cash out the bag.  Cause this motherfucker started dressing in drag. 
[04:01:00]  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  It was time to cut him off because I'm done with him.  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg.  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg.  Screaming, don't leave, please twist it, G.  But this is what you get when you fuck with me.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants him.  Cause if you see one fact, then you've seen him all.  He wants him.  So what the fuck you mean?  So what the fuck do you think?  Cause if you see one fact, then you've seen him all. 
[04:01:30]  Hello, I'm Twisted.  This is Tom's life.  Tom is not gay, okay?  I want you to stay away from Tom.  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son.  And we have a life together.  You stay away from me, son of a bitch.  Don't you know.  Oh.  Oh.  Of course.  This is Tom.  I'm calling теперь.  Twisted.  Twisted, please call me.  Please.  I miss you.  I miss you fucking dark.  I miss you fucking days. 
[04:02:00]  I'm so fucking bad.  I love you, Twisted.  Please.  Please.  I don't think that part was necessary, where the kid had to call up Gangsta Bag and ask why his toys were sticky. 
[04:02:30]  Patrice is speechless, man.  Isn't that awful?  It's just shocking, man.  It is shocking.  It's shocking on a lot of levels.  First of all, he got studio time.  Somebody gave this motherfucker studio time.  And the pride.  He's doing it with the pride of a heterosexual.  Yeah.  Like, that's exactly the same song you say.  Like, he's a tough guy.  Yeah, I'm fucking this guy.  So the niggas came.  Yeah.  So the motherfucker came.  With the attitude and the pride. 
[04:03:00]  Like, that's how it really went down at the thing.  He walked up to the rich white guy's car.  Yeah.  He goes, I see your dick is hard.  What's up, nigga?  You'll call me.  That nigga called me.  That motherfucker would have been screeching down the road with 911 on his cell phone.  I think I was being carjacked.  Not fucking getting his phone number and shit.  What's up, motherfucker?  Yo, what's up?  What's your name?  Anthony.  What's up, nigga? 
[04:03:30]  I heard you was worried about home invasions.  If I'm there, don't worry about that shit.  I got you.  I got you.  Opie.  Damn.  We got a trucker on the line.  That's a dope-ass name.  Mark the trucker.  What's up?  Motherfucker.  Mark.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up, Mark?  What's up, Mark?  I just can't tell you, man.  That's about the most fucked up song I've ever heard.  Why is it so fucked up, Mark?  Why is it fucked up?  I'm talking about grabbing the kid's toy and wiping his dick off with it, man.  Come on.  Well, what's up with that? 
[04:04:00]  What's wrong with that, nigga?  You ain't got no kid's toys?  Where you at?  That's just too much, man.  You got room in the back of your truck, nigga?  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Gangsta fag.  Gangsta fag.  What's up?  He's a tough one.  He's a tough one.  He's like, he's a tough guy there.  Holy shit.  Josh in D.C., what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, the song isn't half bad, but like you guys said, he's acting like he's some gangsta  guy.  Instead of talking about bitches and hoes, he's just talking about another fag. 
[04:04:30]  Well, I'm trying to tell my story.  People don't hear my story, so if you could, I got to tell my shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Why does it just got to be bitches and hoes?  Why does it got to be bitches and hoes?  Why can't it be tearing some man's ass up?  You know what I'm saying?  Fuck that.  You can back this one up.  The black community wouldn't accept this.  I mean, I work with a lot of rap artists, and I know they wouldn't accept this, especially  Washington, which is a heavy black area.  They wouldn't accept this.  I think it would be a little rough if you're, like, touring around town with your windows  down, cranking up gangsta.  Exactly.  Gangsta fag. 
[04:05:00]  Fuck you out, guys.  Yo, fuck that.  Niggas respect me and my pink rims.  Yeah, pink rims.  Hey, Stuart from Alabama says, nothing like having your stepdad walk in as you're listening  to the little gangsta fag on your PC in Alabama.  Yeah, that's something you don't want blasting too loud.  And the music had just a touch of gay in it.  Bing, bing, bing.  Bing, bing, bing.  You want to hear another track?  We've never played another track on the show.  Ah, play it.  Play it.  Just play it next to me.  Yo.  Go ahead.  I think this is called Closet.  Yo, your balls look good, son. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm sucking on some balls.  I think about the past and it hurts.  I'm just a little kid growing up in the church.  Fearing Jesus, believing in God.  Eight years old, and I knew I was on.  Staring at the other little boys in the class.  My mouth is dry, my heart's beating fast.  I'm in the rest room.  I'm taking the leak.  And every chance I get, you know I'm taking a peek. 
[04:06:00]  They looking at me, so I turn away quick.  I can't get caught.  Staring down at the decks.  I want to hold it in my hand, but I'm scared to try.  I want to put it in my mouth, and I don't know why.  Oh, shit.  He just didn't explain it.  He's a gay M&M, man, with his storytelling.  Because he could be just a guy that went to jail.  Yeah.  And he's not a sissy, but he's a fag.  I don't know.  They said when he was eight years old in church,  he's looking at guys, little boys in there with him.  Oh, damn.  You really didn't listen to the story. 
[04:06:30]  You know what I'm listening to?  The brother's telling a story, Patrice.  I'm trying to share this shit with you.  Putting it out there, and you're blowing that shit off.  I'm trying to share this shit with you, and you make it light of the shit.  You know what I'm saying?  I told you I was having difficulties not looking at men's balls.  Ain't you feeling the brother?  You know what I'm saying?  What's the matter with you?  And don't come in this motherfucker with your name being Opie no more,  because I can't concentrate up in this bitch.  Go by Greg.  You go.  And you.  Stop opening your eyes, motherfucker. 
[04:07:00]  Come in there with sunglasses, nigga.  Can we get back to his story?  Yeah, all right.  He's eight years old so far.  He's in the bathroom, and he's looking at some dick and wants to touch it.  He can't keep his eye off the tip.  He wants to touch it.  I don't know why these are the things that I'm hoping to get  Every single night when I'm stroking my dick  I'm real confused, but there's no one to tell  I know my life is doomed, and I'm going to hell  Cause I'm living in the closet  See, I'm trapped in the closet  See, I'm living in the closet 
[04:07:30]  Help me, I'm in the closet  See, I'm living in the closet  See, I'm trapped in the closet  Cause I'm living in the closet  Help me, I'm in the closet  I'm 13, and it's all getting worse  I'm going through puberty, and this shit is a curse  24-7, now I'm thinking about dick  But I'm still a virgin, and it's making me sick  I tried to get with this girl, just to try to get off  But I started getting sick, and my dick stayed soft 
[04:08:00]  I knew that me and girls wasn't meant to be  I knew that fucking with that pussy wasn't meant for me  I met this guy named Tim, who lived down the street  I used to sneak in his house, when his mom was asleep  We used to suck dick and make love all night  I didn't know if it was wrong, but it felt so right  It was a secret that we vowed to keep  The sex is really good, but the guilt ran deep  The truth was, I was in love with a man  And it was something that this world could never understand  Cause I'm living in the closet  Preach 
[04:08:30]  See I'm trapped in the closet  I'm living in the closet  They got their dicks in the air like they just don't care  Well what do you think so far  What happens when he gets a little older?  You wanna hear it?  You gotta, he was only up to 13  And the pain of him  See this is the thing that even if he was singing it with a feminine voice  Like, you know, and then I couldn't take it 
[04:09:00]  But this motherfucker's like, you know  Yeah  I was blowing this nigga in the blood  And it's like, just, you know what?  To even tell a story about how I got stuck up in the park with a pistol  Is painful, but he's just going through the life of a dude that sounds like this  And man knows what he looks like  And he's like, and he got enough balls to go in a studio  And put this out  And in the rap world  And now there's gonna be R&B songs  Like where he's trying to get like the rap part of the R&B song 
[04:09:30]  Right, right, right  You know, like Mariah Carey  Like, oh we love each other  And he's like, you know what?  I don't love you, bitch  I love this motherfucker  I need some dick  I need some dick  Where's Usher up in this motherfucker?  Alright, let's see what happens to him here  What happens to him?  Cause every day that I'll wake  I pray the Lord my soul to take  Cause I'm a victim of my fate  Because this world ain't right with me 
[04:10:00]  And some days I just stay high  I watch the days just pass me by  But I still refuse to cry  Because this world ain't right with me  One day me and Tim got caught  And the consequences was worse than I thought  My parents threw me out  And I got disowned  Now it's me against the world  And I'm all alone  They cursed me out  And they called me a fag  I left with all my clothes in their plastic bag  I learned that streets can be cold and wild  And believe me, if you're gay  Then it's twice as wild 
[04:10:30]  I fought a lot  I've been stabbed and shot  Motherfuckers trying to kill me  Cause I don't like twat  In no time I learned to ride for mine  And not to give a fuck if you like my kind  I'd rather be dead than be living a lie  And I'm gon' be a fag till the day that I die  So now they got me not giving a fuck  And I'm saying fuck the world  And I'm living it up  Cause I'm living in the closet  Yeah  See I'm trapped in the closet  Cause I'm living in the closet  So help me

[04:16:00]  People want to hear about you  Yo, managers  Yo, Opie  Anthony  What should be my first motherfucking track?  When you think I should...  You know, I'm thinking the one where you fuck the white guy is a little much for the first track  I like the one where you tell your story about, you know, how you wanted to suck that dick as a kid  So you think my life story perspective is better than my fucking white man  Right  But then, you know, by the third track in, I think everyone will be familiar with you enough  And have this relationship with you, as it were 
[04:16:30]  To where they would be comfortable with you fucking the white businessman  So you think, alright, so you think it's better for me to talk about how I was fucking motherfuckers growing up as opposed to fucking white collar motherfuckers  Well, you know, their collars be white when I finish with them all  That's right, see, now that's the fun and humor  You know, you gotta work them up to the point where then you're rubbing, you're wiping your come off on their toys  On their kid toys  Like, get them built up and ready for this

[04:18:30]  That's when I heard a scream and a car burning rubber  I grabbed my gat and I ran outside  I saw my baby on the ground and they beating him down  They had him out numbered one to eight  They calling him a fag and they kicking his face with me  I put my gat and I'm letting it spit  And I don't really care, give a fuck who I hit  They jump in the car, now they run like bitches  The dead motherfuckers just dug their ditches  Run from the faggots, run from the faggots  You know it's where the G came to bring the front  Yes, run from the faggots, run from the faggots  I guess you picked the wrong fucking bag the fuck 
[04:19:00]  Run from the faggots, run from the faggots  You know it's where the G came to bring the front  Yes, run from the faggots, run from the faggots  I guess you picked the wrong fucking fag the fuck way.  You got to admit, it's catchy.  Yeah.  You feeling that?  You feeling that shit?  You feeling it?  I like that run from the fag.  Who's going to be humming that later today?  That was fucking my boo up, yo.  That was hitting my boo in his mouth.  And I had to come out and take care of that business.  This is real shit happening, too, yo.  I came out in my drawers, yo.  Look at this guy, Bill Kirkland from Ohio.  He can't take it. 
[04:19:30]  He's like, get that fag shit off my fucking XM radio.  This morning's show sucks.  Like, he's one of these guys who's really uncomfortable with it.  Word, word, word, Mr. Ohio.  First letters are O, you know what I'm saying?  For asshole, you know what I'm saying?  We up in there, we up in there.  We in Ohio, too.  Dude, you got to relax.  Don't worry so much.  Don't worry.  You listen to it.  It's not going to turn you into a fag.  Wait a minute.  You can't tell a motherfucker from Ohio not to. 
[04:20:00]  He's scared of heterosexual black men.  So now there's some fag black dudes that are still the same black guys that he's scared of.  These ain't sissies.  This nigga's like, what's up, white man?  Get against the tree.  That's what the weirdest part of this fucking national audience is.  The weirdest part of having a national audience.  How can you tell him not to be scared?  If I came in and said, yo, how you doing?  I don't suck dick.  He'd lose his mind.  He would get scared just if I go, I don't suck dick.  I'm chilling.  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:20:30]  Yo, is your daughter around or anything like that?  He'll be like, mother.  But if I come around and go, yo, is your son around?  If he's not around, you.  He's, yeah, freaking out.  I just want to say.  You mean they can rob you and fuck you?  This is fear.  You know this is the last state that voted for Bush.  These motherfuckers put Bush in office.  You think, gangster fag, this nigga's not driving.  He's stopped right now.  Somebody's picking it.  If they can carjack me and fuck me up, that's a new fear.  The guy is so worried. 
[04:21:00]  You have to decide what you're going to tell the cop.  You was robbed or fucked.  Both, sir.  Shit, I lost my diamond watch, but I was raped.  Yeah, how do you explain your story to the cop?  You see, there was this gangster.  You took my BMW and all my money.  You can't blame a guy in Ohio for this is such.  I should give him a pass.  You should give him a pass because this is so, only people in LA and New York could ever 
[04:21:30]  find this to be funny because we understand this whole thug, this down low, gangster fag,  this thug, what do they call it, homo thug shit.  That shit's inner cities.  That's poor motherfucker.  Bill Kirkland is sitting there.  I'm Bill Kirkland and I'm upset.  I don't need to hear this kind of stuff.  This morning's show sucks.  Right.  It's all angry.  Because he has no point of view.  He's just, this is complete fear.  But he doesn't want to go, I'm so scared of this. 
[04:22:00]  He's hearing it.  You guys stink.  He's picturing like.  He's going to give him mama jokes.  Battle of the sexes.  He's picturing like that he's the guy in the car and the gangster fag came up and it's  freaking him out.  It's scary.  It's the middle of the country, dude.  You travel around this goddamn country.  I got thrown out of Ohio.  I was in Cleveland.  They tossed me the fuck out of.  I started talking about the war.  The bitch goes, we can't have you here.  Yeah.  She paid me and got me the fuck out of her goddamn town. 
[04:22:30]  And this guy, you can't blame him.  All right, Bill.  You get a pass.  Let's go.  Let's get back to the faggots.  Honey and the rest of the faggots.  Now my bull's in the hospital.  Do you think they get away?  That's impossible.  Because I'm a terrorizer.  Like a gang of A-Raps.  Because they picked the wrong fucking fag.  They gave back.  I know who they are.  Because I've seen them before.  And now you know it's time for me to settle.  So I called my dogs and we hit the streets.  Three craziest fags that you hate to meet.  So we headed out to this country bar.  We drove around the back and we spotted the car. 
[04:23:00]  So we laid low and then four came out.  And when they turned around, we stuck the gats in their mouth.  Put them on their knees.  Now they're sucking our dicks.  But now they're on their face.  And we're watching it drip.  Now get the fuck up and give you three to run.  One, two, motherfuckers are done.  Rock from the back.  Oh, they shot him too?  Hey, shot him.  Motherfuckers made him suck that dick.  Rock from the back.  This is scary how that coming, man.  That's hardcore.  This is scary to a motherfucker in the Bronx.  Let alone Ohio.  Rock from the back. 
[04:23:30]  Rock from the back.  I guess you picked the wrong fucking fag.  The fuck with?  Yo.  You know what I'm saying?  What?  Yo, they was in time back in the days.  Motherfuckers used to run up on fags.  I figured, you know, you could do whatever the fuck you want to them.  You know what I'm saying?  But this is like a new time.  A new motherfucking age.  So you're the next motherfucker you run up on.  Try to call.  Call yourself what?  Game fashion motherfucker?  You're going to end up being a motherfucking fag yourself.  Believe that shit, yeah.  Now we're hunting from the head to Rose.  Four down and four motherfuckers to go.  So we lay low and stay blazed on weed.  That's when we get the call and that's all we need. 
[04:24:00]  We get the address of the place they rest.  Grab the artillery and bags of sex.  Kick in the door and we see our victims.  Four rednecks and the girls are with them.  Step in the room and you can smell the fear.  Don't nobody move because the fags are here.  Bought up parties, only watch y'all make it.  Make all the guys strip and get butt naked.  Put them on the knees, now we're fucking them all.  Let the shit on my top, now you're rubbing my balls.  The girl's in tears and she watch y'all suck you.  I guess you picked the wrong fucking fact to fuck with.  Run from the faggot, run from the faggot, run from the faggot. 
[04:24:30]  All right, this is scary now.  It's scary.  Run from the faggot, run from the faggot.  I guess you made the wrong fucking fact to fuck with.  I'll murder your ass.  And get out, murder your ass.  And your girl's going to watch.  Check yourself, motherfuckers.  Next time you try to run a boy, motherfucker.  Check yourself.  I have something for your ass.  Wow, that was scary.  He doesn't seem like he's walking down the street for anybody to know he's a fag. 
[04:25:00]  Well, it all depends.  He could be all tough and shit and dress like the goddamn village people leather guy.  Then you'd know.  Well, and the tough thing, too, is that no matter how tough a gay guy is, he fucks you up, you still got to explain it.  So if I get my ass beat by a gangster fag, I still got to go.  Everybody's laughing at me, and I still got to go, he'll fuck you up, too.  He's a big guy, man.  He'll whoop you up.  That motherfucker can fight.  Don't you think just because he's a fag that, you know, can't kick your ass.  He's got fists like a man, and, you know, fags are sneaky. 
[04:25:30]  You know, what he did, come on, man.  Let me tell you what he did.  That nigga, I got a picture of that nigga, man.  He on my space.  Look how big he is, man.  He knocked you out.  He knocked you out.  I bet he would.  The guy is frightening.  Let's go to Cindy in New York City.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  Have you guys ever heard of the Stonewall in New York City?  No.  No.  All right.  Well, it's a big gay bar, and they have Thug Night. 
[04:26:00]  Good answer, Opie.  Thank you.  Huh?  And they have Thug Night there.  Thug Night.  And what's that about?  It's all gangster, guys.  Get out of here.  It's funny as hell.  Yeah.  I thought there was maybe one or two.  It's a lot.  It's not a joke.  And see, white women think it's funny right now, this whole DL thing.  Yeah.  But you don't, you do not play around with the DL shit with black women.  They do not fuck around with this gay thing.  Yeah.  What happens?  It's just, it's just like you can't even play around. 
[04:26:30]  You can't even play.  Like, we playing right now.  You can't play around in front of a black woman about this whole, because this guy wrote  a book on the DL, I think, and black women are just deathly, my mother, she hates that  whole gay guys that fuck women and shit.  She does not play around with that shit.  Because they're gay, but they fuck women, and on the down low, they go out and hook up.  Yep.  Emily.  Yeah.  What's up, Emily?  Hey, nothing. 
[04:27:00]  How are you guys?  We're having fun today.  Excellent.  How's your, how's your dad looking forward to the big move in January?  And where?  Oh, I thought Emily, I, sorry.  Oh, oh.  I thought it was another Emily calling it.  Wow.  No, this would be Emily from Ohio.  Oh, okay.  She feels safe now.  They're all gay, thank God.  I was worried, I was worried about the ones that'll rape me.  I fucked her in the pussy and made a friend watch.  Oh, God.  Oh. 
[04:27:30]  What do you got, Emily?  There were four guys getting fucked in the ass as their girls watched that day.  Yeah.  Oh, that gangster fag is ruthless.  It's fucking ruthless.  And then the other guys behind the bar, they're going to suck their dick nuts all over their  face, and then tells them to run, like the degradation wouldn't be bad enough for  the rest of their lives, it would have eaten away, they wouldn't have been able to look  at each other.  And the guy wouldn't even heard run.  After he got raped, he came in the face.  Yeah.  Run, motherfucker!  He'd go like this for about five seconds, and then he'd go, huh?  What?  What happened?  What's your... 
[04:28:00]  Oh, run, run.  You know they couldn't see their friends anymore, they'd be fucked up for life, but gangster  fag, no, it's not good enough.  I'm just going to shoot them all anyway.  I think gangster fag messed it up there.  He should have let them live.  It was a good opportunity.  Yeah.  He was fighting straight gangsters, so you got to go get your boys, right?  Yo.  Yo.  Nigga.  Yo, we got to go kill this motherfucker.  What happened?  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Mother...  Motherfucker rape me, yo.

How'd these fuckers know you, and what did they do?  Why?  You're not listening, yo.  I told you.  Listen, man.  I told you.  They walked up.  I'm going to tell you.  I'm going to tell you.  And they sucked your dick?  No, no.  We sucked their dick.  Get your shit, man. 
[04:29:30]  Get your shit, yo.  Yo, we got a ride, son.  We got a ride.  And he looks at his watch.  No.  Ooh, look at this.  I got shit to do around here, but I would love to help you out.  You should call the police.  Yeah.  Nigga, we gangsters.  We don't call the cops.  I don't.  You know, we deal with drugs, murder.  I don't know.  Not rape.  You can't.  This is, I've never heard this before. 
[04:30:00]  Sit down.  Yo, yo, yo.  I got it, mom.  I'm all fucked up.  Yo, yo, yo.  Go with the O-E-9.  We're going to have some tea.  This is tea.  This is homo boys.  Yeah, this is tea time.  That is rough.  That is rough.  This is green tea time.  Just sit down.  Let's explain.  A little chamomile.  Let's go to.  You need to relax.  Let's go to Emily.  I think.  Emily, we'll try you again.  What's up?  Hey, nothing.  I was just calling to say this is the funniest shit.  I've ever heard.  You like the gangsta fact?  Oh, my God. 
[04:30:30]  You've got to find this guy.  Yeah, we don't know where he is.  Someone's asking where can we buy this for Christmas.  Joe Rogan just handed this to us at a poker tournament in L.A.  That's all we know.  This is Rogan.  Did Joe Rogan purchase that?  I know.  Did Joe Rogan purchase that?  I have no idea.  Maybe we could get him on the phone.  I don't think Joe Rogan has anything to do with gangsta facts.  I would be very surprised.  You okay?  Rogan handed us and said, man, this is some of the funniest shit you'll ever hear.  That's what it is.  Nah, man.  Then you can email Joe and find out.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay. 
[04:31:00]  Like, even Marcellus Wallace wasn't fucking right after that shit.  Like, he took care of that fag.  And don't tell nobody about this shit.  Yeah, that's the first thing is, like, first, no one needs to know what happened here tonight.  Yeah, I know.  I know, Marcellus.  Second, I'm going to call some hardcore pipe-hitting niggas.  Some hardcore-hitting niggas.  Oh, they're going to work up Mr. Rapist here with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch. 
[04:31:30]  They made it, edited it out.  His friend's coming after he told that.  Yo, this is Marcellus.  I just got my soul back, right?  Soon as I got my soul back, niggas rake me.  Now get over here, hard pipe-hitting niggas.  You can only imagine how he choreographed what happened to fucking Zed in that basement.  So slow.  Yo, this cop rake me.  Oh, Marcellus. 
[04:32:00]  You know, Marcellus had to then kill everyone that killed that fucking Zed.  He couldn't leave him out there.  He called Sam Jackson first.  You know how that show was going?  I mean, the movie was all going and difficult.  Yeah, back and forth.  They cut out the part where he told Sam, come on down, we've got to kill this nigga.  Sam, man, something bad happened.  Those motherfuckers were talking about Tony Rocky Hart being thrown out the window.  Like, they're not going to talk about Marcellus getting fucked in the ass?  They're talking about Rocky Hart being thrown out the window. 
[04:32:30]  Marcellus threw him out.  I hear it was over his fucking foot massage on his wife.  You what, nigga?  You what?  Vincent, shut the fuck up.  What'd you say, Marcellus?  You got fucked in the ass.  You got raped?  Nigga, I'm having a corn muffin.  And I'm going to walk away from you.  I quit?  I ain't killing nobody else?  You called a wolf to clean that shit up.  Nigga, you better call him Harvey Coytel.  Nigga, call Harvey Coytel behind this shit. 
[04:33:00]  That was fucking your ass.  That nigga was awesome.  Mushroom clown laying shit on your ass.  God, you need the Bible, nigga.  Oh, crap.  That was it.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  There you go.  When those little scamps get together, they're like a sewing circle.  He be giggling as he's trying to be tough and motherfuckers going, you giggling? 
[04:33:30]  No.  No.  Yo, man.  You my nigga.  You want him to take that Band-Aid off your neck and put it on your ass?  Boom.  Any other jokes?  Yeah, my soles.  I'd rather die than not joke about you getting fucked in your ass.  You are not the boss no more, nigga.  I'll take a pack of red assholes.  Red apple.  Shit.  I knew I'd say that in front of him.  Oh, my God.  Gangsta fat.  What a find. 
[04:34:00]  Let's go to Devil Dan.  Devil Dan, what's up?  No, we lost Devil Dan.  He was wondering if that's a soundtrack to Oz.  Let's say hi to Rob in Montana.  Rob.  Yeah, hi.  Even a redneck motherfucker like me thinks this is funny shit.  Oh, right on, man.  Because rednecks ain't scared.  That Ohio guy.  Rednecks ain't giving a fuck about something.  Rednecks don't care.  They want a gangsta fag to come running around.  You know what I mean?  You go up to the northern states like that in the middle of the country.  Now they're starting to go like, hey, hey, hey, enough of this. 
[04:34:30]  I've got to drive my car.  And people are listening in the carpool.  Yeah, this guy, matter of fact, he take this.  He's going to play that against them when they practice them with their Jewish dummies that they.  What do they call them?  The Jewish dummies down at the firing range.  The Jewish dummies.  And they release the dogs on the black dummies.  And they're not worried about it.  They're going to play gangsta fag just to keep it. 
[04:35:00]  All right, fellas, we've been.  Yeah, listen to this.  Our momentum has been a little down lately.  We haven't been doing what we're supposed to do.  So I'm going to motivate you by letting you know what's out there.  Hit it.  I'm going to fuck you in the butt.  Oh, shit.  Lock and load, boys.  And we're going to play this music real loud.  Oh, yeah.  They just be unloading.  What the fuck?  I'm going to shoot the speakers.  Everyone's trying to get in right now.  Wheel in Denver.  Wheel, what's up? 
[04:35:30]  Hey, what's up with these chicks calling in talking about how funny this is?  This is the most frightening shit I've ever heard.  You know why it's fucking funny?  Because it's you getting right now.  It's the fear of men.  It's like women are like, see how it feels?  And they're just like, yay.  When it's hoes and shit, that's fine.  We'll listen and laugh and shit.  But when it's like a guy, you're like, all of a sudden, hey, I've, you know, I've said  some bad things about gay people in a bar.  And I've left out the door with my friends and all of a gun is in my mouth. 
[04:36:00]  And all of a sudden, we have become the hoes.  Gangster fag makes me suck his dick.  And then, you know, guys do and we want to relax ourselves with this type of shit.  We go, all right, would you rather get shot in the head or suck a dick?  I don't know.  I say, shoot me, motherfucker.  I love, I know, I love the stories that come up.  It's like, dude, I would bite that motherfucker's cock off in the last fucking time he ever, 
[04:36:30]  so you would have a cock in your mouth, faggot.  Just saying, no, for survival.  Right.  I'm in prison.  You know, the first guy tries to rape me, getting his fucking dick bit off, and then  they leave me alone.  Motherfucker.  He said, I'll put on my Freddy Krueger gloves and trick him.  Dude, I'll make a ring.  And I act like I'm hair jobbing him. 
[04:37:00]  Slice his dick off.  I'll get a job in a fucking license plate factory, and I'll make a metal ring with fucking  jagged edges.  I'll shove that up my ass 24-7.  That fuck, first person tries to fuck me, they're pulling shredded meat out of the fuck.  That's what I do.  Yeah, sure.  That's what you do.  That's why he's going to jiggle around in there with a plunger handle first, make sure  it's safe.  Gangsta fag has it all figured out.  Oh, yeah.  As long as you pull the gun out, you can put your ass in the air, and you're like, I'm 
[04:37:30]  going to get him.  I got something to shred.  If you got something that'll shred my dick in your ass, I'm going to shoot you in the  back of your motherfucking head.  Motherfucker trying to put some shit up his ass.  He tried to shred my dick, but that was very quick.  Let's go to Craig the truck here.  Next thing you know, I shanked a bitch.  I'm a shankin' fag.  I'm a shankin' fag out in the yard, looking at the boys, getting hard. 
[04:38:00]  I'll stab you everywhere except your dick.  Oh, shit.  Craig the trucker.  What's up, Craig?  Oh, I'm amazed.  I have never in my life heard radio like this.  This is, dare I say, a shocking radio.  Well, of course, shock jocks.  Yeah, shock jocks.  Wow.  Keep up the good work, boys.  All right, Craig.  Gangsta fag is just hilarious.  Gangsta fag.  Because you could, the fear. 
[04:38:30]  This is scary.  Because if he was on there going, you know, I flew in my plane and I landed on his balls,  people would be like, this is sissy, but this dude's like, yo, I took this, I smashed his  face up again, and then I mushed his head up in the toilet.  It's just like, this is fear.  This is prison coming out in the open.  This is it.  This is the, thank you, gangsta fag.  I'm bringing the yard to you.  I'm bringing the tea.  He's bringing the fucking, the little nook and cranny in the laundry room right to your 
[04:39:00]  back door.  That's it.  This is visceral shit.  What happened?  I thought you had to be locked up for this shit.  Not with gangsta fag.  Rick, the trucker.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I'll tell you what, I turned my XM on this morning, I heard that shit, I thought my damn  fucking XM broke on me.  Gangsta fag.  I'm fucking your ass.  I'm gangsta fag.  Make ass bleed.  I won't even use a bag.  Oh, he's not using a bag.  I can't wait until he makes it about raping rednecks. 
[04:39:30]  I took him by his goatee, and I fucking rode his booty.  I fucked him in the back of his NASCAR car.  John in Jersey.  John.  Ah, John, go.  He had a good one, too.  Tissue time with gangsta fag.  That would have been a great line.  I snuck into his trailer.  In the trailer park. 
[04:40:00]  Well, we want to thank Joe Rogan for turning us on to Gangsta Fag.  Good God, mother of Jesus.  He gave that to us at the World Poker Tour.  Only Rogan could find something like that.  Did he go, hey, Joe, what's up, man?  I know you host UFC.  And there's a lot of karate going on up in this bitch.  But I was wondering, my name is Gangsta Faggot, right?  No offense, man.  I know you know your shit, your karate and shit.  I mean, I got a gun in case you want to do that karate shit up in here. 
[04:40:30]  I needed to make rednecks suck my dick.  I need the gun.  You know, I just was raping niggas and shit.  But I wouldn't rape you, Joe.  But I know you know niggas, right?  You think this guy's for real or you think it's some rapper that's just fucking around?  You know, his voice is hard.  It sounds a little bit like Insane Clown Posse.  It sounds, usually you can't fake hard.  I don't think you could fake.  Like, you know, I'll try.  Yeah, I can fuck around.  But I can't fake more than hard. 
[04:41:00]  You can't fake hard.  He sounds like he.  I think this guy grew up, right?  Got his ass kicked a lot growing up.  He can definitely fight.  But then, like, decided, he reached a point where he's like, that's it.  I'm hitting the fucking gym.  Yeah.  He hit the fucking way.  He had those goddamn Tukey arms on him.  Those fucking Tukey Williams arms on him.  That's what I'm saying.  And now he's just choking shit out.  Choking.  I'm going to choke you to your almost unconscious. 
[04:41:30]  Just, you just have enough consciousness to know I'm fucking you.  Oh, my God.  That's what it is.  He can fight.  It sounds, you know, maybe the stories were a little bit exaggerated.  But he sounds his voice.  I don't think he fucked that white guy.  I don't think he wiped his cum on the kids' toys.  After all that shit, he's like, you know what?  I ain't buying that shit.  That's a little too far.  Nah.  I didn't fuck that white guy.  Some DJ didn't tell him the truth.  I fucked his ass and come on his tooth. 
[04:42:00]  I think that motherfucker might be, I don't know.  You never know, man.  A lot of talk.  But if he's got enough balls to try to be famous with this gig, he's not a pussy.  And, you know, I use the term.  Well, that's your bold statement there.  Jim's got a comment.  Jim in New York.  Yeah, this is how Andrew Dice Gay would sound like.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Hey, huh? 
[04:42:30]  So I'm hanging out with these figs.  Hickory dickory dock.  Hey, hey, write your own joke.  Dice was good.  There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.  I hate chicks, so I found the guy to swallow my goo.  Oh.  There was an old man that lived in a boot.  I fucked him so hard. 
[04:43:00]  He had to poot.  Oh.  Andrew Dice Gay.  I'm the Dice Man lover.  See my sparkled bedazzled jacket?  My leather?  Yeah, yeah.  Used to say dice.  Now look.  Faggot.  I just wrote in rubies and rhinestones.  Big faggot.  That's what I do now.  I'm over here now.  I used to be over there. 
[04:43:30]  Now I'm over here by the man ass.  You ever just shove your nose in a man's asshole and take a whiff?  Isn't it beautiful?  It's beautiful.  And then he, after he do it, he goes,  Buckin' up.  Buckin' up.  So this guy walks up to me and goes,  Dice, will you suck my cock?  I said, sure, I'm a faggot.  Oh.  You hear me? 
[04:44:00]  I blow you.  You hear?  Oh, shit.  All day long.  Suck my cock, Dice.  All right already.  Pull it out.  I don't want to sleep in the wet spot.  The whole bed's a wet spot.  I've been fucking you for hours.  Oh.  Andrew Dice game.  Instead of Dice, it's faggot. 
[04:44:30]  Instead of Dice.  Jack and Jill went up the hill.  Jill came down.  I went up and blew Jack.  It don't rhyme.  It just happened that way.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  The fear running around in Midwest right now.  It's just these truckers.  It's scary.  Yeah.  There's nothing gay about that.  Just relaxing.  That's where this Brokeback Mountain shit is going to just.  That's my favorite movie. 
[04:45:00]  Two cowboys.  They're in love.  And they can't even show and share their love with each other.  How sad.  Isn't that sad?  How do I quit you?  Oh.  How do I quit you?  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  That ass.  I can't quit.  How do I go?  Go, go, go, go. 
[04:45:30]  I shoot a load of goo.  I used to joke about that.  Now it's a sweet, precious gift.  It's a sweet, precious gift between two men.  Again.  Again.  Two faggots walk into a bar.  It's me and a friend.  There's not even a joke here.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Oh. 
[04:46:00]  I like that gangster fag.  Yeah.  Gangster fag?  I fucked them.  Wow.  And imagine if gangster fag looked like Tukey.  Tukey.  Tukey Williams.  Oh, I know.  That's even more frightening.  They've shown pictures. 
[04:46:30]  How old is Tukey now?  He's probably 50-something.  He's 50-something.  I've seen recent pictures of him, but they don't like showing those recent ones on the news.  They showed shit from when he was first arrested.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And his arm looked just bigger than my thighs, man.  It's fucking Holiday Hams.  He's got these huge...  I've really never seen arms like that.  The biggest arms I've ever seen, really.  Yeah.  The biggest arms I've ever seen, man.  So imagine if gangster fag is like, went to prison and did some more crazy shit.  Not a chance.  And he's just a big motherfucker like that. 
[04:47:00]  But he's probably a sweet man.  You know, deep down, all men just want to be loved and hugged.  I didn't realize this when I was being angry towards women sexually.  I didn't realize it was because I was just a man looking for the love of a man.  Little boy blue.  It was me.  Oh!  Jack, be nimble. 
[04:47:30]  Jack, be quick.  Whip it out.  I'll suck that dick.  Oh!  Look at Pat from Manaki.  He's got to go on.  I need some feedback.  They're coming in like crazy now.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Holy cow.  I haven't left this hard in a long time.  Oh, God.  Oh.  So I'm online at the bank, and I got my tongue up this guy's ass. 
[04:48:00]  And he's like, why do you got your tongue up my ass?  I said, because I'm a faggot.  Oh!  Goose right in my face.  Goose.  What can I say?  I love to come.  It's like, to me, it used to be nasty. 
[04:48:30]  I would give it to broads and go, take my nasty goo.  Ugh, gah.  Now it's like sweet strudel icing.  Just drizzled on dice.  Andrew dice gay.  The faggotito.  Ugh.  Which way?  Which way?  Which way?  You bet.  Up the ass! 
[04:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Well, Gunny from PA wants to know, hey, Ed, is Brokeback Mountain a documentary about you and Richard in California?  Yeah, that was it.  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  Wow.  Bravo, Anthony.  It's like old school Anthony right there.  When does this end? 
[04:49:30]  Wow.  You just can't get any worse than that.  You like that?  You take that.  Nigga, I'm down.  Ha, ha.  Fuck, fuck, yeah.  That concludes the best of the worst of Opie and Anthony.
