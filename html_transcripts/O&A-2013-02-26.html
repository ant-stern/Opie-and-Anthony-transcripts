<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with Anthony's humiliating experience at a Tom Papa cocktail party where he arrived giftless, contrasting his "white trash" behavior with other guests' thoughtful presents.  This led to a discussion of his generally poor party etiquette and a subsequent recounting of a hostile encounter with several New York comedians, including Colin Quinn, Keith Robinson, Bobby Kelly, Rich Vos, and Nick DiPaolo, at a party the previous night.  Opie and Anthony's surprise appearance at this party and the ensuing verbal sparring match were also detailed, with insults exchanged about Anthony's attire and eating habits.

The show then jumped to various unrelated topics:  Natterman's unique comedic style, a "meat gazing" gym member ("the scroller"), a lawyer's pompous demeanor, Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, Iran's Photoshopping of Michelle Obama's Oscar appearance, heavy US snowfalls, and a debate on whether exceptionally talented young athletes, like an eighth-grader offered a football scholarship by Alabama, should skip college and go straight to the pros. Listener calls contributed to this discussion, focusing on the challenges faced by college athletes.  Joe Theismann's post-football financial situation and a past porn star guest were briefly mentioned.

The next segment tackled a cannibalistic NYPD officer's online fantasies, contrasting different newspapers' portrayals of the story, and *The Onion*'s controversial, yet humorous to the hosts, tweet calling a nine-year-old actress a "cunt."  This transitioned into promotion for a fictional show, "American Fuckers," an audio companion featuring awkward sexual interludes narrated by Daniel Bobo Curlin, and a comedic segment featuring "Uncle Paul" and young Macaulay Culkin.  "Surprise Jocktober," a belated jocktoberfest celebration, followed, along with discussions about the Eagles (Don Henley's solo career), Ace Frehley's financial problems, and the hosts' experiences with bodily fluids, culminating in the retelling of a previous show where someone consumed a vasectomy remnant.

A significant portion focused on the fallout between Opie and Jim Norton stemming from Norton unfollowing Opie on Twitter. Norton explained his actions resulted from Opie's criticism of his website and a broader disillusionment with the comedy community's lack of support for his projects. Opie expressed hurt feelings, leading to a tense airing of grievances.

A subsequent segment featured Colin Quinn as a guest, further exploring the Twitter unfollowing drama. Quinn clarified his actions were not passive-aggressive but a reaction to numerous comedians ignoring his requests for collaboration.  This sparked a debate with Norton, with expletives flying and references to Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neal. A phone call with Nick DiPaolo added perspective.  The segment included a Dollar Shave Club sponsorship, discussions about Norton's drunk driving history, the hosts' "good boy" and "naughty boy" phones, and a humorous call to Radio Shack.  Quinn and Norton appeared to reach a mutual understanding by the end.

Another segment began with a mention of Nick DiPaolo's upcoming appearances and his drunk driving history, followed by Norton's recounting of spending 27 hours in jail and subsequently performing at Dangerfield's. The main focus shifted to a furry convention, sparking disgust and bewilderment from the hosts and callers, with speculation about the psychological motivations behind furry fandom.  A "Jocktober" segment critiqued Miami's Power 96 radio show, mocking their bits ("War of the Roses" style "Busted" and Instagram bio readings) and promotional campaign, where the "6" was removed from their logo ("Power 90 Thief"), revealing it was a poorly executed rebranding of their "Fugitive" bit.

A later segment heavily focused on the continued mockery of Power 90's "missing 6" promotional stunt, deemed "stupid" and "horrible" by the hosts, with several seemingly staged phone calls and criticism of their radio consultants.  Anthony Jeselnik's new show was promoted, alongside "line of the day" segments.  The hosts' personal lives, food, health issues (E-Rock's digestive problems), and another contentious call from Colin Quinn regarding Jim Norton were also discussed.

Finally, the show ended with a Dollar Shave Club commercial, a listener's story of a hair removal product mishap, and a discussion about depilatory creams and the hosts' experiences with nipple piercings and resulting scar tissue, culminating in a promotion for Troy's DJ gig.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're all socializing last night.  We were hobbing.  And knobbing.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We went to a big boy party.  Winter cocktail party. 
[00:05:30]  Winter cocktail party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had quite the spread.  You had quite the spread over there.  You had quite the spread over there.  I apparently have no clue.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a great job.  It's a big guy. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No.  I don't know.  I get there, and I see other people arriving, and they bring things to parties.  They bring things.  Do they?  Yes.  People have bottles of wine and a basket with things and stuff.  And then I realize, I'm like, oh, my God.  I just show up like it's a fucking, like I should grab one of those red cups and start pumping the cake.  What a piece of shit I am. 
[00:06:30]  See?  We're pieces of shit.  But you dress the part like you should have brought a little something-something.  It's visual.  I make a visual impact.  You don't actually feel comfortable in that jacket, do you?  You're not a jacket guy, are you?  It was hiding my gun.  I had to wear it.  Gotcha.  That's why the jacket.  Yes.  Gotcha.  It's an accessory.  I wanted to wear a dress shirt, right?  Because it was a kind of a, you didn't want to wear a t-shirt.  But I wanted to tuck the dress shirt in, so then I couldn't have something on my hip with a tucked in shirt, so I had to wear a jacket over it. 
[00:07:00]  You tuck in shirts.  Well, if I'm going to wear a dress shirt like that, because it's a very long dress shirt.  Dress shirt with jeans, no tuck.  No tuck!  No, with a jacket, you got to tuck.  No, I know, but why would you wear the jacket?  Because I wanted to tuck.  I know, but why are you tucking?  Sounds like a discussion.  Girls will like that.  Why are you tucking?  Why are you tucking? 
[00:07:30]  Because it just looks better with a belt and to tuck and have, like, yeah.  You were trying to look like a gentleman.  I was making an attempt at looking sort of like a gentleman, no hat, you know, kind of a big boy grown-up party it was.  But again, I fucking fail because I'm watching people arrive, and they bring in Tom Wine, and one girl brought a basket with, like, a pie in it.  It was great.  And I'm just looking, and then I realized, like, it hit me.  I'm like, oh, my God, you're supposed to bring shit. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sending him something today, you want to be honest?  Oh, yeah.  Oops.  Dude, I see.  He never brings shit.  But on my way down, I jumped in my car, and I drove down there.  I was like, fuck, you forgot to fucking buy him a little something.  A little something.  And then he lives in the part of, then I'm thinking, all right, it's Manhattan.  I'll just park my car, and there'll be a million wine stores or something.  He lives in an area.  There's nothing there.  No, dude.  On the other side. 
[00:08:30]  You saw a place.  Was it 6th or 5th?  But I'm just saying, like, there was something there because I was able to find, like, a deli.  And I think I saw a liquor store.  But even then, I didn't think.  I didn't see any of that, to be completely honest with you.  I'm a piece of shit.  I just parked my car and said, all right, where's the wine store?  There was no wine store.  Damn.  And then I didn't eat beforehand, and he didn't have dinner out.  He had, like, shrimp cocktail and some brisciut and cheese wheels and stuff like that. 
[00:09:00]  And I'm just loading up plate after plate because I'm hungry.  You don't go to those things because you're hungry.  You're supposed to just pick.  And I'm just loading up on brisciut and bread and fucking cheese making sandwiches out of it.  I'm a piece of shit.  You're white trash.  I am white fucking trash.  You're right.  But he was the best dressed.  He got the best dressed award.  Oh.  Although you probably got abused, right?  Yeah, a little bit.  I was told that I had Voss's hair from 10 years ago and his wardrobe. 
[00:09:30]  And his fucking wardrobe.  I'm fucking mad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They started getting on me.  Well, when you hang out with the comics, you can't just enter a room.  You just can't enter a room like a human being.  No.  No.  You just hear him start, like Jimmy said, you hear him in the corner and you hear just a  burst of laughter.  Right.  And you turn and look and they're all looking at you.  And you know that you have to go over and address it because you're just going to get  killed if you don't.  Yes.  What?  You look over and just take.  And there's nothing worse than walking into that energy.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  Like it was Colin and Keith and Bobby and Voss and Nick DiPaolo.  Yeah.  Just a terrible mix of people.  And just like as you're walking over, you hear like.  The explosions of laughter at your expenses, you're closer.  It's awful.  That was a who's who of New York comedy, though.  Holy shit.  I walked in and they started in on me and it goes, oh, it's your turn.  I'm like, my turn for what? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And they're just beating the shit out of me for the shirt I'm wearing.  So I just I just go ugly.  And then Bob Kelly's like, keep it nice.  Keep it.  I'm like, keep it nice.  We're going to play.  We're going to play.  Right.  Next thing you know, the corner they all gathered in.  Five minutes later, I'm by myself in the corner.  I took over the corner because I just got vicious.  I'm like, I ain't putting up with this shit.  You didn't keep it fun.  No.  I don't know what keeping it fun is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they're attacking you, you just got to fight your way out.  Yeah, because the stuff they were saying to me, that didn't sound like fun. 
[00:11:00]  So I'm like, all right.  Oh, with your shirt.  Yeah, it was hilarious.  It's like, did you get a pillow with that shirt?  Would you get that shirt at the airport?  At least you got that.  I got it when I walked in because they were saying I look skinny.  So they couldn't attack that.  But I was eating some nuts.  And Bob Kelly goes, hey, dude, why do you put the food into your mouth?  Why don't you just dip your mouth into the food?  Like call me a bird and tell me I should pick at it like it's birds.  Bird, see? 
[00:11:30]  And he goes, just throw it on the ground and peck at it.  They're just pricks.  Yeah.  And I'm not in funny energy yet.  I mean, just got their vibe.  Yeah.  So I'm eating a fucking piece of like, you know, I'll be the same thing.  Cheese with two crackers.  I'm crunching and just being brutalized.  You can't do anything.  You got to stay on your fucking guard constantly.  Yeah, I don't feel like being on guard for a winter cocktail party.  I just want to have some fun.  I want to go in, maybe have a couple cocktails, say hi to a few people and get the hell out of there.  Yeah.  Right away, you have to be incredibly aggressive back to protect your space. 
[00:12:00]  What is that about?  I don't know.  I fought my way to that corner.  I took over that corner.  You stood your ground.  Had to.  I was very shocked to see you guys.  Really?  Yes.  I walked in, I hear Ant's voice, and then I walk in, I see Opie's beard.  I'm like, what the fuck?  They came?  Yeah.  Because Tom was like, I think the guys are going to come.  I'm like, that's cute.  Nah, that seemed like something really cool to go to. 
[00:12:30]  And Tom's fucking great, man.  Just keeping these hours.  It's just tough to do that stuff.  For me, I don't know.  Yeah, I slept from, I think the time the show ended yesterday, I went to the apartment here  in the city and just fucking passed out until probably 4 p.m.  And that was like, okay, now I can do something tonight.  You've got to plan like hours ahead what you're going to do.  And I saw a lot of guys there that we haven't had on the show in a while, so don't be surprised  if about 10 comics show up today.  Yeah, just pop by, man. 
[00:13:00]  But I do mean it.  It's not one of those empty promises, but you see some guys like, holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Why haven't you been on the show in a while?  So I gave an invite to every single person there.  Natterman is fucking funny, man.  Yeah, yeah.  You feel like you're in a time machine talking to that guy.  How do you explain his voice?  It's like a vaudeville voice, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very vaudeville-y.  And what comes out of his mouth is kind of vaudeville-y.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  I did a movie 10 years ago or so at Lewis Black called The Birkin Dick Story.  That's how he talks.  And that's where I got my voice from.  Really?  But I did the voice of that.  Oh, boy.  Let's see what you did for the war effort.  It was like that old-time comic.  I was doing Natterman.  Wow, yeah.  That was what I did.  It was 1999, actually.  I was doing Natterman's voice.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And that's not his act.  That's just how he is.  And Dan, he's a funny fuck, man.  He is hilarious on Twitter.  I don't know if people are following Natterman on Twitter.  He's a good one.  Is he funny? 
[00:14:00]  Yes, he's a very good one to follow.  He didn't recognize me at first.  He said, he goes, are you in show business?  Show business.  In front of Tom Popp and everything.  He says that.  And I didn't answer.  I was just kind of looking.  I go, hold on.  I'm pondering that.  And then Tom goes, it's Anthony from Opie and Anthony.  He goes, oh, I've been on the show.  I go, yeah, I know.  I was trying to answer your question.  He's a little Asperger-y.  Yes.  Dan, but he's on the Comedy Cellar podcast. 
[00:14:30]  And he's fucking really funny on Twitter.  Yeah.  And his Twitter's just weird.  Did you meet Nome last night?  I know Opie knows him.  I don't know him.  No rules.  Yeah.  That fucking, it was good to see DiPaolo, too.  I haven't seen Nick in a while.  Yeah.  His abs look good.  It bothered me.  Yeah, we found a corner and discussed some horrible things.  We kind of, me and Nick get along.  With a lot of aspects.  You guys want to do a podcast and call it 1940s. 
[00:15:00]  That's funny.  Yeah, it was a good time, though.  Tom Papa, thank you.  Yeah, he's a good host.  Not that he's up listening right now, but thank you to Tom Papa.  He's a great host.  I eat.  I got to send him a little something, something, too.  He's got a nice little family there.  He has a little cat.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I feel terrible.  I was going to answer.  I don't bring food.  I never bring food.  I'm the worst guest.  Dude, the worst.  Like, my party-going thought process has not changed since, you know, someone was throwing 
[00:15:30]  a party in the woods with a fire and a bottle of whiskey.  I'm terrible.  What a fucking lump of shit.  You just brought something.  Just think.  What was that stuff that people bring you don't use anyway?  But you know what?  You got to just...  It's like, oh, right.  Anthony came and didn't fucking bring anything.  No, I just pointed at something on the table and said, I brought that.  That's a great idea.  And then Tom Papa goes, did you bring those as well?  I go, yep. 
[00:16:00]  He goes, no, you didn't.  My kid made those.  I'm like, huh?  Picked the wrong thing.  Damn it.  None of us brought anything.  I never think of it.  I fucking forget.  I'd rather just hand money.  If he said, can I have 50 bucks?  I'd be like, sure.  50 bucks.  I'd be happy.  Here you go.  Thanks, buddy.  That's great.  I'd be happy to hand him 50 bucks.  You know, that would be nice.  A little pocket money.  Yeah.  There you go.  Screw that wine and shit.  Last minute wine purchases.  Buy yourself something pretty.  That'd be nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you come to any of my parties, just give me cash.  A few bucks at the door?  Yeah.  A few bucks at the door. 
[00:16:30]  Anybody that knows anything about parties or any advice column or anything would say,  yeah, you bring something to a party.  You never come empty handed.  But you know that.  That's so...  You have to know that.  Yeah, but I didn't even think of it.  I do.  I literally...  He called it a winter.  Never think of it.  But the name of his party should have gave you the clue.  I know.  I know.  I mean, I didn't bring anything either, so I'm guilty as fuck.  I have a fuckload of parties at my house, and people always bring things.  I never do.  I feel terrible every time.  I watch people bring things.  I don't think about it, though.  Like, I don't think, like, oh, Jimmy didn't bring something. 
[00:17:00]  It doesn't bother me.  It doesn't...  I don't think about it.  Just don't...  But I should think of it.  You should.  It's the adult thing to do.  It's the adult thing to do.  We're children.  I never think of it.  We're children.  It's better this way.  But it's not about being selfish.  I don't mind paying money for something.  Like, here...  I mean, how many help with the cost?  Immature assholes who have not developed any sense of fucking adulthood.  Whoa!  Jesus!  Sorry.  I just wanted to yell that out.  Felt right.  To yourself.  That was fun, though. 
[00:17:30]  It was.  It was terrific.  Very cool.  I just go and eat everybody else's cheese and shit.  I'm terrible.  Just show up and don't fucking bring anything.  Dude, I...  Did you eat...  I tried not to eat.  I ate like a pig.  We're going to sound like girls now, but...  I was fucking floating up.  There was too much night.  I couldn't do it.  I worked at the cellar and purposely ate like what I always eat there, which is like the  one skewer of chicken and the tabbouleh salad, because I knew I was going to Papa's and  I did not want to be loaded up.  I wanted to be fucking fairly full.  Right.  So I didn't just eat like a hunk of shit. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  And I did eat like a hunk of shit anyway, but I didn't eat the cupcakes and fucking donuts.  Can I read your text that you sent me yesterday?  Sure.  It's a different topic.  Yes.  It was from the gym.  It made me laugh so fucking hard.  Me and Jimmy work out at the same gym.  We've talked to...  We've talked to...  We've talked about, I should say, the meat gazer.  There's a couple meat gazers over there.  Who termed it meat gazing?  You did.  I mean, I heard it from you.  I don't know who termed it that.  No.  Somebody else came up with it.  Oh, I don't even know.  I wish I could take credit for that. 
[00:18:30]  That's hilarious.  Maybe you heard it, because I got it from you.  I thought I got it from you.  Nope.  I heard it from you.  Somebody was in here saying meat gazing.  Eh, whatever.  So we went to the gym yesterday together.  I had to get out of there early to do some shit.  And then Jimmy texts me.  He goes, that faggoty scroller is wearing a towel sitting in the meat gaze chair.  Ugh.  He was wearing...  Now we have a meat gazing chair.  That's what's...  Nothing but a towel this time.  He didn't have his fucking clothes on. 
[00:19:00]  What a fucking cockpeaker.  That is really fucking wrong.  Did I get angry when I see him?  I laugh.  We point at him now.  I go, hey, Jimmy, look.  And then Jimmy will turn and just go, ugh.  The scroller's my...  He's my favorite.  Because everyone knows he's not scrolling for anything at this point.  I think he's trying to take pictures.  That's what freaks me out.  If he fucking even attempts to take a picture, I will fucking knock his teeth out.  You wouldn't even know it, though, because he would just do it.  No, I will.  There would be a problem.  But, like, he's holding... 
[00:19:30]  Like, I'm holding my phone right now and, like, just scrolling.  But just, you know, snap a quick picture and nobody would know what he's doing.  Wow.  So I'm a little...  Really?  Yeah.  That's why I get so mad.  But now there's a meat gazing chair.  Yeah.  He can see down two locker banks.  Oh.  He's got perfect angles.  Yeah.  It's right near the bathroom, too.  What's wrong with that, gang?  So you can sit.  You can watch a little TV.  Uh-huh.  Do a little meat gazing.  Catch up on your stocks. 
[00:20:00]  People are suggesting we might be going into a gay talk year.  With meat gazing?  Maybe.  Well, we're not saying...  You're not...  You're not...  It's too funny.  But it's getting into the gray area.  Remember, we started something years ago.  Gay or funny.  That's true.  I think this is in the funny category still.  I really do.  You got a creep that bothers Jimmy to the point he has to write me text messages about it.  And I don't give a fuck what people do. 
[00:20:30]  My problem with him is there's something...  He's extremely obvious, but he doesn't think anyone's on to him.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  But that's cool.  He's in that locker room.  I could go three or four different times during the week, meaning not have a scheduled time.  And he's always in there.  So you have to start thinking, how many hours does this guy spend in a locker room, at a gym?  Yeah.  Did I see him if I...  Right after the show, and then sometimes I go late afternoon, he's there.  He's always there. 
[00:21:00]  He's cruising.  Fucking jerk off.  Cruising?  Oh, it bugs me so much.  There's something...  He makes me feel like I make women feel.  Really?  Jimmy.  But I mean, that's what it is.  That's what it's like to be looked at.  It sucks.  Unsatisfied sexually?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I wish they had a cock.  Just give him a peek.  All he wants is a peek.  Dude, I'm fucking...  I'm Teddy Towel.  I fucking...  I open my underpants, I put my towel on. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  I'm like a shy 13-year-old, and I pull my pants...  I'm not giving him even a fucking ass look.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  He probably undresses you with his eyes, though.  Oh, I know he does.  And I...  Sometimes I just want to stand there naked with my hands on my hips and go...  Superman pose, yeah.  Yeah.  Mom's a kimbo.  Nice.  One of my new things I like doing on Twitter, which has something to do with the locker room,  I overhear these conversations, and I'm finally tweeting them.  Yeah.  It's just...  It's so embarrassing.  Guy at gym on phone... 
[00:22:00]  This was my tweet yesterday.  He actually said this word for word.  I typed right away.  I didn't want to miss a fucking word.  He goes...  He was talking to some kind of client, and he goes, I'm a pit bull.  My specialty is that I go to the edge of the cliff, but I never jump.  What does that even mean?  How is the other guy on the line, like, accepting that?  What could he be?  Hey, it...  I heard...  I heard...  It sounds like he's some kind of lawyer, because I was eavesdropping a little more, 
[00:22:30]  and it seemed like he's some kind of lawyer.  But why would...  If someone said that to you in a business conversation, wouldn't you be like, ugh, Jesus?  Yeah, you could say, ugh.  You would, right?  Yeah.  I'm a pit bull.  I take it right to the edge of the cliff, but I never jump over?  You're never supposed to say things about yourself like that.  You know?  Like, that's the...  You don't say...  If someone said, hey, he's a pit bull, he takes it right to you, it'd be like, well,  okay, that guy must be...  Sure.  But if you say it about yourself, you just seem like a douche. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, God, yeah.  Pompous dick.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, if someone says you're a pit bull, you go right to the edge, then you should go,  yeah, but I never jump.  Like, that's how that discussion should be.  That's how it should go.  You should all come out of the same person.  You don't do this set up and pay off.  I'm a pit bull.  I go to the edge, but I never...  You just made the whole pitch.  Right.  But that means you're not a pit bull.  I mean, you should leave the other part.  You're right.  Like, I go to the edge of the cliff, and then you wonder in your head, well, fuck, is this  guy going to fucking, you know, go over the edge, or what am I getting myself into? 
[00:23:30]  Douche.  And if people know you never fucking go over the edge, then, yeah, you're a softie.  Yeah.  You don't want them to know that.  I don't know.  Assholes.  Assholes.  I wanted to call you for that.  See you ever at Coopstead?  Yeah, in 96, man.  I told you.  I told you that smoking would get to you eventually.  The ex-surgeon general.  He never smoked.  He hated smoking, right?  He wanted to eradicate it by 2000, but he's... 
[00:24:00]  He was big against that.  He did pretty good.  Yeah.  What year was he...  Wasn't he the one that started the whole, you know, smoking thing?  I think, right?  Getting it to a point where now people, what, have about a five-by-five-foot area outside  their fucking office?  Put a worse warning label on the cigarettes and shit like that?  He started that shit, right?  What year did he really aggressively go after smoking?  With the quack of your beard.  He went after really hard.  Yeah, but it's very obvious now, because, I mean, you know, we're old enough to know or  remember, you know, being able to smoke everywhere, including on planes. 
[00:24:30]  Was he the guy under, what, Reagan?  Yes.  Wow.  Really?  He goes back that far.  Hello.  Huh.  Yeah.  He wasn't a fan of the AIDS either, right?  What was his stance on the whole AIDS thing?  Oh, wow.  Oh.  He was like the...  Well, this article calls him the government's spokesperson on AIDS when it was still considered  a gay disease by most of the public.  Did he make any statements about it being the gay disease?  I don't think so.  The gay. 
[00:25:00]  Remember that?  They were calling it the gay cancer at one point.  I watched the documentary on it when it first started, and they had no idea what it was.  But smart people thought it was a gay disease, because that gays were the only one getting  it, so they just didn't know.  Yeah, I think he's kind of credited with putting it out in the public as something that anyone  can get.  Oh, okay.  He had that weird goatee, right?  He was that guy.  He had the weird beard, yeah.  He looked like he was from another time.  Right.  He definitely had an 1800s look to him. 
[00:25:30]  See, Everett Coop.  Oh, it was a beard.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah.  He just went without the mustache.  Yeah, and the beard was very big, kind of bushy, and then he had the sideburns that  connected to it.  Yeah, he looks like a Civil War hero.  He probably was.  Yeah.  Old motherfucker.  96, wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Last we saw him was on the Life Call commercials.  He did one of those?  He was doing those.  I endorse Life Call, Life Alert, whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:26:00]  I've fallen.  That woman.  How great was that?  She would take such a tumble.  And I can't get up.  Creep.  Well, I just makes these guys work, fucking Tony Powell and Rob, but they're always doing  characters and bits and writing.  Man, he really gets a fucking lot of mileage.  Godfather this morning.  The more they do that, the less he can talk and get himself in fucking trouble.  That is true.  Yeah.  Quick, do a bit or something.  I have the urge to talk about Negro. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Damn it.  The hell?  Yeah, they had a big fucking blizzard or some shit, too.  In the Midwest.  We getting any of that?  What happened?  That's Argentina we're looking at.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not the West.  That's really the Midwest, then.  That's Israel.  Oh, no.  We did have a big blizzard in the Midwest, though.  Could be one of...  Yeah.  That shot looks like it could be one of the Great Lakes, though.  Yeah.  It certainly looks like...  Lake Effect snow? 
[00:27:00]  Huh?  Did it look like Lake Effect snow?  I don't miss Lake Effect snow.  No.  To my western New Yorkers up there.  Holy fuck.  How do you deal with that shit?  Our listeners in Kansas City getting pounded with some snow.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Chicago.  Chicago?  That ought to tame the crime rate down for a couple of minutes.  Detroit.  No.  It was Texas had, like, a record snowfall.  The Panhandle was getting a lot of snow.  Most snow in, I don't know, something like well over 100 years. 
[00:27:30]  Mm.  Yeah.  Boy, I was listening to that goddamn Chicago police scanner.  Holy shit.  Saturday night for a little bit.  Hilarious.  Every fucking call.  Every single call was the exact same description.  Blackmail and a hoodie?  It was.  For shootings, domestics, robberies, general shenanigans.  It was apparently a big fight at a roller rink.  And the description for six people was exactly the same. 
[00:28:00]  It's a lot of fun.  You have fun with that.  I do have fun with that.  I know it's happening.  I'm not stupid, but you have fun with that.  I just love, you know, I love hatred.  Yeah.  Wow.  And, um...  What's going on with the Pope?  He's really old.  Is he really old?  Oh, he's old. 
[00:28:30]  This is his last week, right?  Yeah, it was on Wednesday, and then, of course, the resignation, the historic, almost unprecedented  resignation of a Pope.  On Thursday, we'll see Pope Benedict XVI leaving his helicopter from Vatican City in St. Peter's  Square.  We won't have Pope Benedict to kick around anymore.  It's been a very difficult time for not just the Roman Catholic Church, but those who are  of the faith around the world to really deal with what's come about over the last 48 hours.  Really?  To the story, the allegations about the Italian clerics here at the Vatican and the sex scandal 
[00:29:00]  associated with them, or the allegations, this is what the Vatican has said.  We didn't touch those boys.  No kidding.  There was already a conviction before all of this happened, among many cardinals, that  the next Pope had to be more of a governor, that is, had to take the reins of power more  into his own hands, and in particular, lead a serious reform of the Vatican bureaucracy.  And the next Pope has to have clean hands with regard to the abuse crisis. 
[00:29:30]  Good luck.  Yeah, how are they going to find one of those guys?  They got to dig deep, no pun intended, and find a Pope that, uh...  They need a 30-year-old Pope.  You think?  Yes.  They need a young Pope?  Because an old Pope...  I think an old cardinal...  Has to be dirty.  Has to be dirty in some way.  I'm not saying he actually touched the kids, but he...  Cover up.  He has to know the environment.  He had to know some things.  Had some knowledge. 
[00:30:00]  One of the cardinals had to step down, right?  Yeah.  He resigned?  Yeah.  Which cardinal...  It doesn't matter which cardinal.  One of the cardinals had to resign.  Keith O'Brien.  Keith O'Brien.  For steroids?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's different.  Thought we were doing sports break.  Human non-growth hormones?  Yeah.  What happened?  Keep them young.  Yes, yes.  Keep them young.  Does anyone think anything changes when they're fucking new Pope?  That is such a figure-head-y thing, isn't it? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  Who gives a shit?  What does the Pope do?  Nothing.  They really got to fucking clean house.  They got to figure some stuff out.  Yeah.  But he's done in two days.  That's it.  First guy to resign in 600 years.  600 years?  You get to that age, what else are you going to do?  Why wouldn't you live the rest of your days as the Pope?  That sounds kind of cool.  He's probably got dementia or something.  Nah, I don't think so.  He doesn't seem like he does.  But when you look at Pope John Paul at the end of his fucking reign, he was gone. 
[00:31:00]  That's what I'm saying.  This guy's not close to that.  Yeah.  It's kind of selfish if you ask me.  You're supposed to fucking, you know, you're committed to there for the rest of your life.  Right.  You see what Iran did with Obama?  Yes.  Michelle Obama?  Michelle Obama.  I didn't even know they ran the Oscars in Iran.  How do you see the Oscars in Iran?  I don't know.  If you're a free-thinking soul and you want to watch the Oscars.  But Iran decided to cover up Michelle Obama's dress.  They photoshopped it. 
[00:31:30]  The dress was too revealing for Iranian media.  So they photoshopped in part of her dress.  They covered up her arms and her bare chest.  That was showing.  That's just an annoying, shitty culture.  It's so savage.  How we even have to make believe we are tolerant of their dumb, fucking misogynistic, savage ideology?  How would you...  Why, as a man, would you want a woman covered up?  It's beyond me.  Because they can't control themselves. 
[00:32:00]  Because they can't control themselves.  Because their rules and laws and religions have them out of their fucking minds sexually with sexual frustration.  Out of their minds.  It just amazes me.  Why would you want to do that?  Wouldn't you want women walking around just completely naked?  You'd think.  No, actually, I'd like a little clothes.  A little clothes?  A little bit.  A little bit.  They fucking...  Boy, they used the clone tool on her, huh?  Hoo-hoo.  The clone tool.  Did it look good, at least?  It looks a little blurry. 
[00:32:30]  I think they blurred it up a little.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So as to cover up where they were covering up.  But, yeah, they made her...  She has a sleeveless thing.  But they allowed a lot of skin on her arms.  I'm surprised by that.  Yeah.  Yeah, they covered up her entire chest.  And I gave her kind of...  Covered up her shoulders a little bit.  How we do big men's...  Is the shoulders a hot spot?  That's why they had to cover them up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That gets some feelings going.  Oh, yeah.  Gets some fucking...  Gets their juices flowing. 
[00:33:00]  Gets a tingle in their fucking pubis.  Those fucking savages.  It's amazing.  Why do we even tolerate it?  Or make believe that we have to tolerate a culture that...  That stones women because they were raped?  It's ridiculous.  When a billion people follow something, you've got to kind of tolerate it a little bit.  Do you?  Yeah.  A little bit, yeah.  If it's some kind of fringe group or...  Don't fake it, though.  Don't make it sound like we're tolerant. 
[00:33:30]  Say, well, we're forced to tolerate this.  But we really think your people are idiots.  I think most people know that.  Yeah?  I think most people know it's forced tolerance.  I don't know.  Like when government officials start yapping about, you know, and our Muslim brothers and  our...  It's like, really?  Mm-hmm.  When you look at Egypt now and...  No one's even going over there anymore.  See those pyramids and that stupid sphinx?  Really?  Yeah.  I always wanted to go see those things.  Good luck now.  No kidding. 
[00:34:00]  Good luck now.  You can't even go to Italy.  Really?  What's going on over there?  The whole market got fucked up yesterday because they're having some...  All I know is they're having some kind of election and, yeah, it fucked up the...  Mamma mia.  ...the financial world.  Gee.  I don't know why.  Someone who knows more certainly could tell us, but I don't understand why that stuff always  has to affect us.  Yeah.  Some little dumb thing over there.  It's more than a little dumb thing, but you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Everything's tied together now.  I know.  It wasn't in the good old days or this whole world fucking thing. 
[00:34:30]  It's a post-vote stalemate.  Spooking investors is the headline.  So there you go.  Everyone's a little scared.  Mm-hmm.  Might as well keep doing headlines.  Tao sucked at the NFL Combine.  He might not find a team, Travis.  Yeah, he'll be fine.  He'll be fine in the end?  Yeah.  They're all talking about how much he sucked in the 40.  Really?  He ran slower than they thought.  4.82, I think.  They were expecting him to be much faster than that. 
[00:35:00]  Underwhelms at the Combine.  He ran a 4.82 in the 40-yard depth.  If you're as big an idiot as he is, you better fucking be physically...  Yeah, you better have the fucking wherewithal to run quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't be a slowpoke and a fucking dummy.  Because if it ain't football, he's doomed.  You think?  He is a dolt.  Imagine if he was your accountant.  Aren't you the guy?  Yeah, it's me.  Yeah, thanks.  And speaking of football, you hear about this eighth grader? 
[00:35:30]  He don't look like an eighth grader, though.  How old is this kid?  We're getting into some fucking shady ground here.  Really?  What's going on?  He's an eighth grader.  He's so goddamn good at football.  Alabama.  There he is up there.  Oh, boy.  They offered him a scholarship.  Look at his arms.  He's in middle school.  Stop.  And they got video of the kid playing football.  He's twice the size of everyone else on the field.  Was he left back?  That's what I'm trying to find out. 
[00:36:00]  Because, you know, you hear about these kids every once in a while, and then it turns out  they're 22, 23.  Eighth grader with fucking kids and a car.  Who was the guy?  The pitcher?  That was a big story for a while.  Danny.  Oh, the Little Leaguer or something?  And then it turns out he was a lot older than first expected.  And then he was a bust.  He was a phenom.  Phenom?  Yeah, we were all talking about him for a while there.  Danny Almonte.  Yeah, Almonte.  Remember that kid?  I am sure. 
[00:36:30]  There's a name from the past.  Yeah.  And then it turns out he was older than...  He was two years older.  Two years older, which is a big fucking difference.  Who did he play for?  He ended up playing for nobody.  You know, he was a bust.  But they thought this guy was going to go right to the majors and all that.  Yeah, he was like a great Little League pitcher.  And then they were like, oh, this guy's going to be the next big thing.  And then they figured out he was two years older.  And that's why he was so good.  Yeah.  And he just never went anywhere?  No, because he never really developed from there.  I remember that story.  Yeah.  How many years ago was that?  Like five years ago? 
[00:37:00]  No, he's...  Oh.  That was 12 years Jesus.  That was 12 years ago.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Now that kid's pushing 30.  He's an assistant baseball coach at a high school.  Right.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Was he just not that...  He was just good compared to being...  He was two years older, so that just makes it...  You know, he's not a phenom.  That's a big difference at that age.  At that age.  You're fucking whipping a ball past these little fuckers' faces.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I'm wondering about the eighth grader.  Is he a true eighth grader? 
[00:37:30]  Because he certainly doesn't look like a true eighth grader.  He looks way bigger than all the other kids.  But Alabama offered him a fucking scholarship.  Alabama?  Already?  Yeah, he's in eighth grade.  That means he's 14.  Jesus, come on.  No, look at him.  Huh?  His arm's got some muscle definition to it that eighth graders shouldn't have.  Let me see, Trav.  Let me see this kid.  Yeah, people are...  This is a big story today.  Yeah?  It sure is.  What did Travis find? 
[00:38:00]  A 34-inch vertical, nine-foot broad jump, and he ran a 4-4.  Oh, boy.  Can I say something?  Wow.  That's athletic power.  Why is there music?  He's eighth grade?  That's an eighth grader.  Yeah, sure.  They're showing some footage of his football games.  Yeah, look at him.  He's parking his car.  He's just owning.  Yeah.  Yeah, he looks like he's an NFL player already.  He might just be one of those fucking gifted...  Yeah, I mean, they come around like LeBron James went right out of high school, and he's... 
[00:38:30]  And I don't blame him.  Fuck the colleges.  I mean, I understand, like, you want to make the money.  He'll make more money in his first year than fucking most people will make in a lifetime.  That college argument they always have, that's nonsense.  What?  To get an education?  I mean, that's not a bad thing.  Are you kidding me?  If you use it, but I mean...  Yeah, but you can't risk, like, getting hurt in your college sport to get an education and then to finally go into the pros to make all that money.  Yeah.  Don't...  Most people go to college hoping to get out and have a really nice paying job, so if you're an athlete, why wouldn't you go right to the fucking pros? 
[00:39:00]  It's just that system...  And start banking money.  Trying to make more money off the...  And they say, well, they...  I mean, it's a weird thing, because they want the athletes to have education, so they're not...  But you don't need...  If you're going to make fucking $3 million a year, $5 million a year, you don't need it.  Right.  Of course you don't need it.  And then, you know, eventually you go back to college if that's something you want.  Yeah.  Holy fuck, if my kid turns out having skills, no!  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  You don't need to go to college!  Are you kidding me?  Charles Jefferson for Earth, Wind, and Fire and Little Brother.  He's one of those guys, like, fucking...  Right.  He's a monster, Forrest Whitaker.  Oh, yeah.  Fast times.  Very good, yeah.  Nice car.  You're keeping it up nicely.  That college education argument is the dumbest argument in all the sports shows talk about.  Yeah.  It is so stupid. 
[00:40:00]  It really is.  If you have a chance to make a lot of money, you have to go for that.  Do some guys get hurt and ruin their NFL careers in college?  So many.  It does happen, right?  Yes.  You don't even know their names, because they never made it because of that.  They were big college stars, and they decided to do the right thing and try to get an education.  Played one more year of football or basketball or whatever.  Those sports especially.  And they blew out their knees.  Will the NFL or NBA take you right out of high school now?  I'm glad they took LeBron, though, because it was the right move. 
[00:40:30]  He's the best player in the league.  What's the...  I think all you have to do is just declare yourself eligible for the draft.  But the thing about college football is that it's not like baseball where there's minor leagues.  It's like you go to the NFL, and you're in the NFL.  There's no...  Right?  College football is kind of like, you know, you're minor league training.  Yeah, same thing with basketball.  But, yeah, the point being, though, if you get two good years in and then you can go to the pros from there, why wouldn't you?  Why would you do four years in?  Because I think that there's a gigantic jump between high school football and the NFL, you know, where it's kind of to your advantage to play at least two years in college football. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, no, I understand that.  It is very hard to go from high school football to the NFL.  I don't even know of anyone that has actually done that.  Do you?  Roger Staubach went from high school.  He's got to go to college.  Oh, boy.  There goes Jimmy.  No, I'm a cowboy fan.  I'm not believing it.  Jimmy, you asked.  Here we go.  Paul in South Carolina. 
[00:41:30]  Go ahead, Paul.  Hi.  Fucking give us some knowledge.  There's a running back that went to the University of South Carolina who was supposed to be a big-time pro prospect named Marcus Lattimore.  The pictures are online.  He got injured playing against Tennessee this past year, and it's a gruesome, gruesome injury.  What happened?  Yeah.  He dislocated his knee.  His knee?  Yeah.  It went completely the wrong direction. 
[00:42:00]  I do know about this.  Is that a career-ender?  It's not good.  Career-ender.  They think he might come back and play, but if you see the pictures of it, it's horrendous, horrendous knee injury.  See, and the colleges don't pay the athletes.  They make millions off these guys.  Yeah, they do.  And they don't give them a fucking dollar.  Yeah.  They give them an education, but come on.  I mean, obviously, the number one sport where kids are jumping right to the pros is basketball more than any of the sports.  And why?  Of course that's what you do. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, he took his knee right out.  Yeah, it's brutal.  It's a brutal injury.  And that guy was...  I can't see...  Oh, yeah.  Like, he hit him right...  And that guy was the shit, too.  Oh, wow.  His helmet.  Yeah.  He fucking went in.  Yeah.  You see that fucking whole leg flopping away.  It's not supposed to flop.  Did he fumble?  That hurt.  He fumbled.  Nope.  Held the ball.  Well, he held the ball, huh?  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  No problem.  Great job, guys.  All right.  Leah, the college is...  If you're going to...  It's a hard thing.  If you're going to risk a career-ending injury, they should pay you something. 
[00:43:00]  And, you know, there is rules now.  I'm behind on this.  Chris in South Carolina.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was just going to say that in basketball, you have to play a year of college before you can declare yourself eligible for the draft.  And in football, you have to play three years.  Baseball.  Really?  Baseball, you can go straight out of high school.  So you can't get kids going from high school to the pros in basketball anymore?  No.  I did not know this.  That's so fucking...  They call them one and done. 
[00:43:30]  They have time with the college just to get that one year, and then they get pros.  But that's just...  That's stupid.  Kentucky's famous for it.  It's just stupid, though.  If these kids are good enough to be in the pros, why force them to play college ball?  He's not completely right.  Oh, he's not completely right.  Hold on, hold on, Chris.  You have to be out of high school for at least three years.  The rules don't state that you have to go to college, but you have to be out of high school for three years.  Ah.  For the NFL draft.  What if you excel in school and you graduate early? 
[00:44:00]  With honors?  Yeah.  Then, can you then...  But why are these kids being penalized?  Because they excel in their sport.  And what is the reason for...  Like, is it because they don't want them to be predatory and start grabbing kids out of high school  and then, like, getting them injured and they get hurt and, like, fucking...  They have no education.  Right.  I mean, there's also that angle, too.  It's about the money these colleges make.  With football, I think it's a developmental thing.  Because if you look at the size of the players compared to... 
[00:44:30]  Sure.  That's true.  I mean, they're just not as big.  I'm more focused on...  That Marcus Flattimore guy they were talking about, he plays for our university, he never  had a complete season here.  And he has the most touchdowns out of anybody in our history, our university.  So that's how good he is.  I guess I'm more focused on the basketball guys because they certainly, you know, the  record has shown a lot of guys going right from high school and having good pro careers.  That's a good point about the physical size.  I didn't say that.  But if you're a phenom and you're big enough and, you know, physically you can handle it, 
[00:45:00]  why wouldn't you allow that to happen?  Exactly.  That's this midget.  Jeez.  Look at the alien clown and watch the alien clown.  Come on.  Oh, stop it.  That's a gag.  Oh, he missed.  Hold on a second, sir.  Shot a three-pointer.  And after the game, the crowd stormed the court and lifted him on their shoulder.  One person could have.  Yeah, really.  It means a lot.  Like, I've kind of, like, since I've managed high school, I've always kind of had the thought  that what if I could play a little bit and now it's here and it's unreal. 
[00:45:30]  He's a dwarf.  No, it was all too real.  Oh, God.  He's a dwarf and he's playing high school basketball, I guess.  Oh, he gets a little fella break.  I don't, I don't.  Give him a little noogie.  Hilarious.  I think they just gave him a spot for a little while.  Did they?  Yeah.  A Rudy moment?  Yeah, I think they're going for the Rudy thing.  Yeah?  Yeah, and they all go, hoody-doody-doody-do.  Oh, hoody-doody-do.  That would be hilarious.  They don't, so everyone pulls out a little fife and starts playing, starts playing it. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, degrading.  He's running down the court.  A hoody-doody-do.  Shoo-do-do-do-do.  Shoo-do-do-do.  Just play dwarf music.  Dwarf music.  How embarrassing.  They hate when the opposing team pulls out fifes.  They pull out their fifes.  They can only play home games because opposing schools are too mean.  They're just too mean.  I wanted to say thanks to Chris.  Then we got John, who thinks it's stupid for these guys to go right to the pros. 
[00:46:30]  John, go ahead.  Yeah, I mean, what you're running into is you have such a small window of athletes that  make it to the professional ranks, whether they go one year, stay all four years.  You take that scholarship, and you are guaranteed that education.  They can't take away that scholarship once you sign.  Now, most of these colleges are giving people one-year scholarships with the condition of  if you make it through that first year without injury or anything, then they'll give you 
[00:47:00]  a second year of a scholarship.  So any chance you get to get that money and take it and, of course, better yourself, you  always have that back to fall.  You have that to fall back on rather than just make it to the pros, right?  And that money is definitely not guaranteed in any sport.  Wouldn't you agree?  But it's just interesting that they take...  Look, I think it's all bullshit.  I think most athletes that play for these big universities don't really give a fuck  about their education when they know they got a really good shot at the pros, especially. 
[00:47:30]  But they should because then there's guys like Jason Williams who played for the Bulls,  and he was one of the top players, one of the top prospects, and then he goes and gets  injured, and now what has he got?  What happened to Jason Williams?  How many millions did he make?  I don't think he made a lot.  Out of those millions, you go back to college.  You can pick whatever fucking school you want.  I mean, it is smart to have something to fall back on, though.  But these guys aren't looking at it as a real education.  We all know.  We've heard the stories over the years. 
[00:48:00]  They don't even really have to go to class.  They don't treat them the same as other students.  Raise their head and say, war.  Right.  Right.  I mean, look at Allen Iverson.  Makes me sad.  I'm an old school Philly fan, born and raised.  And I'll tell you what, how many millions did that guy make?  He had a Georgetown education if he had an education, like you guys said.  But at the end of the day, we're talking about, you know, what, 5% of all these Division  I athletes that get scholarships that end up going to the pros and getting hurt or being 
[00:48:30]  successful.  It's a small window.  Yeah, that's true.  But, yeah, I get your point.  But, I mean, yeah, he did not get a Georgetown education.  We all know that.  Right.  He got a thug life education.  Yeah.  There's guys that, you know, they have no interest in the university whatsoever as far  as getting an education.  They're there.  And they know already they have a really good shot at being in the pros.  So, fuck, let them go and do their thing.  My major is business.  There's a lot of college athletes that realize they were good enough for the college sport but 
[00:49:00]  not good enough for the pros.  Those guys, sure, it would be to their advantage to take advantage of the fact they got a free  education.  Yeah, I mean, I understand the value of that, too.  Plus, if you make the money, you want to be able to manage it and not get ripped off.  But it's the idea, it's the way they set it up where the colleges make millions.  And, again, they give away educations, too.  But they make so much fucking money and they don't pay these athletes if they get hurt playing  college ball.  They're making believe they're taking care of the college athlete.  Like, oh, no, you really need an education. 
[00:49:30]  But the fact is, they want all that talent in the college system because the college system  makes so much money.  So, you don't want to water down the talent, right?  Yeah.  That would hurt business.  It's a big business for these guys.  I think you shouldn't be able to play professional football until you get A's and B's on all your  homework.  That'll never happen.  It'd be like, it'd be a JV football league.  Right.  Hey, good call, John.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  All right, thanks.  Poor Joe Theismann just talking about his fucking prostate.  Yeah.  That's all a brilliant career and we just have to look at him with fucking his prostate and 
[00:50:00]  having to run to the bathroom everywhere he is.  It makes you think that the guy didn't manage his money well.  Really?  Well, if you're an older athlete, do you really want to be on TV talking about the fact that  you used to have to fucking take a leak every 10 minutes before you found the magic pill?  My prostate was driving me batty.  Right.  Yeah, but these guys also didn't make anything back then.  Yeah, that's kind of true.  They didn't make the salaries that these guys are making.  What's Theismann's worth there? 
[00:50:30]  Net or gross?  Net worth, right?  Yeah.  Do you think he made a couple million a year?  No.  He had to be in the millions.  Right?  He had to.  Maybe?  He had to be making millions.  Yes.  I disagree with Travis.  I think he made...  He had to.  In the 70s and the 80s, he wasn't making millions.  When did he retire?  85.  Oh, so he didn't really get...  He got maybe a little taste near the end.  A little forced retirement.  Oh, so someone like Theismann just isn't really rich?  That's so...  That is weird.  Come on.  It's weird to think. 
[00:51:00]  Who did we have in here that had to...  Dr. J.  Yeah, I mean...  Oh, gosh.  Dr. J.  I mean, that's my thing for myself.  I asked him.  I told him my ankle was hurting.  He couldn't fix anything.  Fucking liar.  This is the doctor.  No, I understand that.  I was just wondering if he could do any work on the funny bone.  We totally got it.  That's my funny bone.  We got it.  Remember Dr. J and his old shirt?  Oh, I know.  I'm like, you're Dr. J.  NBA players should just be writing him checks. 
[00:51:30]  He should go to his mailbox every morning and just get checks from everybody.  Yeah?  Yes.  Theismann has a great restaurant that nets a few million a year.  Doesn't he?  What?  I'm sure he's got some good investments.  Some of these guys do that.  It just seems like he should have had more money.  Elway opened up car dealerships.  Aikman has dealerships.  I think Starbuck's a big fucking investment guy.  A lot of these guys have huge businesses because they're big names in their home cities.  You should go into making video games.  That seems to be very lucrative for sports.  Hold on, I don't know if you heard. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, that dumb motherfucker.  They just sold that sock.  92,000.  92 G's.  Is that what they thought or no?  No, they were hoping to get more.  Over 100.  Good.  Sports memorabilia is tough these days.  Fucking dumb bloody sock.  Who gives a shit?  It's going to sit around the shop for a while.  There's really no market for it.  I'll give you 300 bucks.  One of those guys came to our show in Vegas.  The Pornstar guys.  Really?  Which one?  I don't know.  He saw a towel.  I don't know the show.  Was he?  I didn't see him.  Oh. 
[00:52:30]  I saw a towel?  Well, he came to the show.  No, no.  I think Dave had him on Insomniac years ago.  Oh, okay.  Then it was probably a long time ago.  Yeah.  You know what show I stole upon yesterday?  American Pickers.  I finally saw.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know this is old news.  I'm not stupid.  I watch that show.  But I didn't realize when they find this shit, that they have videos of that particular  thing being used or old photographs and stuff.  That's what makes that show cool.  Yeah.  And they're in an attic and they pull out some rusty who gives a fuck thing, but then 
[00:53:00]  they show how it was used.  Yeah.  You need an angle.  And that's what brings that whole show together.  You need an angle with those shows to show a little history or give a little information.  You can't just have like, you know, oh, here's this item.  I'm going to buy it.  Wow.  Right.  But to actually show the item in use, a lot of times in video, black and white video and  stuff, I really dug it.  Yeah.  I'm like, damn, I would have liked this show four years ago.  This metal ball used to be beat up against clothing to make them fluff. 
[00:53:30]  Gives a shit.  Great.  Who cares?  Kind of like the show.  Yeah.  I don't mind that one.  Yeah.  When we come back at one, can we please at one point discuss this horrendous cop?  It's creepy, right?  Fuck.  Oh, yeah.  You think he was going to do any of that shit or is he just batshit crazy?  I don't know.  Both.  I think he was nuts.  But he was willing to go there.  There were certain things that made it look like he may have actually killed and eaten  his wife or could have all been fantasy.  Keith's a nice guy.  We shouldn't talk about him like this. 
[00:54:00]  This cop was a cannibal and was having online fantasy.  Oh, my fucking...  Wow.  That's creepy, man.  And can we discuss The Onion?  Yes.  I have mixed feelings on that one.  So do I.  So do I.  Mixed feelings.  Interesting.  Interesting.  I want to find out why you have mixed feelings.  I mean, the word they used was pretty harsh, but...  But it's The Onion and it's pure satire.  All right.  Yep, yep, yep.  But that little actress was a bit twatty. 
[00:54:30]  She really was.  What are you looking to make the news?  Well, I noticed she was a bit twatty through the whole, what is it called?  Oscar season.  Didn't she seem cute?  She was smiling and stuff like that?  No, man.  She kind of had an attitude and that's what their...  The Onion went, you know, pretty damn far with the whole thing.  But everyone noticed that she kind of had an attitude.  Yeah.  I know she's only nine, but it wasn't that she was shy.  She had this attitude.  They called her a cunt and I think...  I don't know what her name is, but they're like, hey, we're the only noticing so-and-so 
[00:55:00]  is a cunt.  I thought it was a really funny tweet because it's such a preposterous thing to say.  Right.  About a nine-year-old.  To me, it's such a non-reality-based thing to say.  Like, it's so ludicrous.  When you have The Onion posing as news parody, it's so out of the realm of possibility that  the news would call a nine-year-old girl a cunt that it's funny and it's shocking.  That's what they're supposed to do. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  It's their job.  But they got too much flack for it and the fact that she is nine and then the CEO came  out and just said, look, we fucked up.  And I don't care if they apologize or not, to be honest, but I don't think it's a big  deal that they did.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was...  I love The Onion.  Hilarious.  They are funny.  Fucking hilarious.  All right.  We discussed it then.  There you go.  We're done.  What's her name?  Hanna Wallace?  It's rough to call a nine-year-old at the Oscars a cunt.  I know.  It's a rough one. 
[00:56:00]  But there's...  Like, I took down my...  When I originally...  I didn't even call Joan Collins a cunt and I think she is.  I made sure I attacked her without saying that and I hate her, but she's an old lady  and I'm like, fuck it.  I don't want to call her a cunt.  Yeah.  And that's a rough one about a nine-year-old.  But again, it's total...  It is funny, dude.  It's hilarious.  Again, it's total parody.  I wasn't offended at all.  It was great.  They weren't actually saying she was a cunt.  It's a parody of a news organization calling her a cunt.  Yeah.  It's different than you getting mad at that fucking old bat and calling her a cunt because 
[00:56:30]  you meant it.  But then again, there's a feed attached to the Oscars 2013 where your organization is  calling a nine-year-old nominee a cunt.  Right.  Exactly.  And as a CEO, you're like, eh, I get it, not apologizing, but this one's a little  Will the apology be enough?  I'm sure it will be.  What can they do to them?  Yeah, what else are you going to do?  They say they're sorry and that's it.  And they are completely fucking protected.  That's great.  I say great.  Bravo. 
[00:57:00]  Good for them.  Yeah, it cares.  What are you going to do?  Sometimes you say something and you're like, eh.  I've been handed a disc.  For most sound.  I've been handed a disc.  Oh, what is that?  I see Sam Roberts is smiling like the cat who ate the canary.  It was something I requested a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  A transfer?  A kiss?  Today is surprise jocktober day. 
[00:57:30]  Oh!  I said out of nowhere.  I watched it.  It just surprised me with a jocktober because so many people love jocktober and it kind  of sucks to just wait until October.  It's like the car companies that do the Christmas in July sales.  Right?  All of a sudden you're like, what?  Jocktober.  Believe it or not, jocktober was almost five months ago for us.  Jesus.  Four months.  Four months ago already.  Wow.  So today is surprise jocktober day.  Nice.  We've got a show that we're going to be taking a look at.  Oh, no. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  So we're going to do that and some other things.  We've got to get through all the other stuff first.  Dude, this guy, I can't believe what I was reading.  Yeah, we'll talk about the cannibal cop or whatever they're calling him.  Do they have a cute little fucking name?  Cannibal cop.  Cannibal cop.  Cannibal cop.  It says on the cover of the day, there's meet the wife if they spell it M-E-A-T, which  is pretty funny.  Holy shit.  What the fuck are they thinking?  The guy was going to cut her throat and bleed her out and they're mocking it.  But meanwhile, the onion, it's funny.  The onion calls the girl a cunt and that's too much.  But where is the paper, where is the people demanding the press apologize for making it 
[00:58:30]  cute?  He was going to cut his wife's throat and bleed her out.  He was going to get off on seeing her bleed out.  And tortured.  Right.  Meet the wife.  Both papers.  Meet the wife.  Wait, they both have the same headline?  Meet the wife.  Are they owned by the same people at this point?  They did.  They went with the same headline.  Two people had the same brilliant idea.  Wow.  I bet they're fucking, hey, that was mine.  Plenty douchebags.  Hey, how about meet the wife?  Meet the wife.  Wow.  That's fucked up that the Daily News and the Post, same headline. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  Let's talk about that next, huh?  Mm-hmm.  On the next episode of American Fuckers, Mike and Frank travel the back roads of America  looking for rusty gold.  We are, man.  We're in the mantiques.  We're making rust hot.  Me and Frankie are the rock stars of rust.  They're looking for amazing antiques to fuck buried in people's garages and barns.  What happens is you get in these barns and stuff, and I'll fuck anything that's transportation  related.  I'll fuck a 1913 Indian in a barn.  I'll fuck a 1913 Harley in a barn. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, it's hard to really get the boner on.  Yeah, that's hard to fuck, you know what I mean?  What most people see as junk, they try and stick their dicks into.  Oil cans, gas pumps.  Everything.  Different heights, sizes, shapes, everything.  Four wheels, two wheels, you know, memorabilia.  Beer cans.  That was smoking, man.  I did high five them.  I was like, dude, that was awesome.  We can't just be a one-trick pony.  I mean, we've got a lot of different things.  You know, all of a sudden, Brass Blade fans are hot.  I love Brass Blade fans.  I want to dry hump a Brass Blade fan.  They're fucking the history of America one piece at a time.  You know, nothing surprises us anymore, I don't think. 
[01:00:00]  We're fucking cool stuff.  The cool thing about us is, you know, we get excited about just about anything.  You know, we're just looking for stuff we have never fucked before.  Find out which forgotten relics will get fucked.  Yeah, woo!  All on the next episode of American Fuckers.

[01:03:30]  We're not doing Eagles Day.  I'm sorry.  No.  Not going to do it.  Not a big Eagles fan myself.  This is one of the songs they were playing at the dance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Yeah.  Before Wooly Bully.  Bully got up, played a little drums.  There you go.  On the stage.  You like the Eagles?  Yeah.  I'm kind of an Eagles fan, a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I do enjoy...  I don't mind the hits.  Uh-huh.  I do like a good, uh, Hotel California. 
[01:04:00]  Well, that's why we're doing this today.  36 years ago.  What?  They released Hotel California.  That was 36 years.  Yeah.  What year is that?  Uh, 36 years ago is you got the...  We're up to the 13th, so then you gotta add the 23th, so you're talking 1977.  37th.  Wow.  I kind of remember that because there was, uh, there was like Peter Frampton, Frampton 
[01:04:30]  Comes Alive.  Right.  There was the big Boston album.  Right.  That came out.  And then the Eagles came out with Hotel California.  Yeah.  It's like huge for albums.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never got into the Eagles, though.  No.  Peaceful, easy feeling, and, uh...  Yeah, they did have mellow ones.  Uh, I don't mind mellow rock.  My brother-in-law is a massive Eagles fan down there in Florida.  Yeah.  Fucking massive.  That's his number one is the Eagles and all their side projects.  He still goes and sees those weird side projects by the members of the Eagles, still doing 
[01:05:00]  it on their own.  Well, that's pretty, you know...  Then they get back together for this tour, and...  They all, um...  Well, almost all of them had pretty good solo careers at some point.  I like kind of...  Joe Walsh.  Yeah, I like some of the solo stuff the guys did on their own.  Yeah, absolutely.  What's his name there with the Smuggler's Blues?  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...  Yeah, Don Henley.  That guy.  I like Don Henley's solo stuff.  Glenn Frey.  Glenn Frey, right.  Okay.  Glenn Frey.  And then there was Don Henley's... 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, I liked Don Henley's solo stuff.  Did you like the Felder?  Give me a song by the Felder.  Don Felder?  I think there was one that...  Uh, this is...  Eh, I'm gonna have to do this on my own instead of trying to figure it out in front of you.  There's a song that I actually really did like by one of the, uh, Eagles when they went solo.  And it's not a song that, uh, was that popular.  Yeah, whatever.  I'll figure it out on my own if it's worth bringing to the show.  I'll fucking bring it.  No Don Felder, E-Rock?  What was, uh, Felder's big hit there, uh, E-Rock? 
[01:06:00]  If I'm spelling his name right here, All of You...  Nope.  No, then that's not this dude.  Oh, boy.  Why? Don Felder.  F-E-L-D-E-R, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's just three, uh, two songs here.  What's the other one?  All of You and Heavy Metal, Taking a Ride.  Hmm, maybe I'm, maybe it's another guy I'm thinking of, uh...  Did you like, uh, Don Henley?  Hmm.  That Stupid Boys of Summer song I always liked.  I liked the Sunset Grill.  Beep, beep, beep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Picking up the prisoners and putting them in a pen. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  And all she wants to do is dance.  Dance, dance.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a big one.  Yeah, absolutely.  He was, uh, very big during the, um, very popular video years of MTV.  Right.  So he had all those fucking cool videos.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  This was a pretty big hit for, uh, him.  Yeah.  All she wants to do is dance. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  And she was on the end of the video, just dancing around like a maniac.  Who redid Boys of Summer?  And really, uh...  The Atarys.  Yeah, you heard that.  The Atarys.  You've heard that before, right?  Oh, yeah.  They fucking really pumped that song up.  Yeah.  There it is.  I thought we weren't going to do Eagles Day.  What happened?  Oh, it was Don Henley Day.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  The bubble-headed bleach blonde comes on at five.  Yeah.  Come on.  I still am amazed by a drummer with a really good voice that can play.  How do you do that?  It's fucking insane watching Don Henley sing Hotel California while he's playing the drums and shit.  It's pretty amazing.  And I know it's not like some fucking insane drumming going on, but just to be able to do it at all without singing like this.  But he just looks out of place.  Like, where is he singing from?  Oh, way over there behind the drums. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, hi.  Where the hell is that coming from?  When Peter Criss would sing Black Diamond by Kiss.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You can do that.  Actually, he's going to have to go back to Kiss.  We understand.  Ace Frehley's losing his house, though.  I know.  What's that about?  Oh, poor Ace.  I don't know.  I guess he didn't make payments.  Some people just foreclose for the hell of it, though.  Do you think fucking Gene comes by with a snidely whiplash mustache?  You can't pay the rent.  Nah, you got to think Ace Frehley can pay the rent.  What's that really about?  He hasn't paid in two years.  He hasn't paid in fucking two years. 
[01:08:30]  He's fucking strumming a guitar.  He's busy.  Is it a big spread?  I don't know.  Does he got a giant fucking house?  I'm guessing.  Who knows?  I mean, you never know.  You should look into it.  You can freaking buy Ace Frehley's house.  That would be a nice little dream for Jim Northam.  It was like $750,000.  Whoa.  Maybe not, then.  That's a big nut.  That is.  That's a big nut.  Don't mind me.  I'm blowing my nose.  It's pretty disgusting, right?  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  I hate snot.  Man, do I hate it.  I think it's second on my bodily fluid.  What's number one?  Hate list.  Shit.  You know, shit.  But you don't really deal with shit.  No, but the reason you don't deal with shit is because you don't fucking want to deal with shit.  You know, you make very, you're very careful when you're wiping as to not get any on your hand because that shit lingers.  Snot, though, you got to deal with it.  You got to fucking, you know, it's right there in your hand with the fucking tissues. 
[01:09:30]  And then you got to kind of do the Roto-Rooter thing.  It's not like you're taking a tissue, you're like rolling it up and shoving it in your ass and turning it around.  Jimmy does that.  Unless you're Jimmy.  Jimmy wipes his ass like we blow our nose.  Like you blow your nose.  You got to Roto-Rooter out the nostril.  You got to Roto-Rooter the nostril.  Yep.  So what's going on with this cop?  I'm a cop, you idiot.  What a creepy story.  The headline again on the paper for the people just tuning in.  Meet the wife.  So he's an NYPD guy. 
[01:10:00]  Six-year veteran, yeah.  He's into cannibalism.  Has he actually eaten any?  No.  Well, this show has.  So we're one up on the NYPD cop.  We are one up on him in the cannibalism category.  We did have cannibalism at NEW.  What was it, a little tube?  One of those little spermy tubes.  Oh, right, right.  Somebody had a, Stockbroker Dave had a vasectomy.  Right.  And they took home the little piece of the Vasa tube. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  And somebody ate it on a cracker for tickets.  It's Aerosmith.  Oh, Aerosmith.  Yeah, I remember.  Like it was yesterday.  It was a cracker.  So we did have cannibalism.  Do you understand how fucking weird radio is?  Somebody ate a guy's cock vein to go see Aerosmith.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did that.  Vast difference.  Yeah, we, somebody went down to the, to where this whole procedure was going on.  We grabbed it.  Dave didn't bring it to the studio.  Yeah.  They handed it over to one of our, one of our guys and they brought it back to New York. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Are those two brothers?  I don't know.  The sound editing guys with the long hair?  Hey, Opie, I didn't know you.  Jesus.  I, of course I got that.  Oh, of course I got it for the producer of fucking, uh, Argo.  Of course I got that.  The guy from fucking True Lies.  Hey, Anthony, I didn't know.  Shut up.  I told that before, uh, we came back.  I didn't even want to deal with Twitter yesterday because of just one idiot. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  It's not even about, I mean, the haters are going to hate no matter what the fuck you  do, but I just can't, I can't deal with just stupid people.  This guy writes, Opie, did Opie really ask if it used to be windy when Lincoln was alive?  And he meant it.  So I wrote, yes, it was a dumb joke, you stupid fuck.  And then I just turned off my Twitter for the day.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  You made me turn off my Twitter for the day.  I was going for a dumb joke.  Whether it worked or not is up to the audience. 
[01:12:00]  But he thought, I was wondering if it actually was windy during Lincoln's time.  It's a dumb joke based on the stupid big hats they used to wear.  Meaning it would be a pain in the ass to wear those things if it was windy.  They just don't seem to understand.  Holy fuck.  Fuck.  I began blocking people that say, why are you not in bed?  Why are you not asleep?  Don't you have a show to do tomorrow? 
[01:12:30]  Those people, I've gotten so annoyed with that.  And it's no big deal, obviously.  But I've just, it's one of those things I've gotten so annoyed with.  You know, it's one in the morning and stuff and I'm tweeting stuff, laying in bed, watching TV, waiting to go to sleep.  And, you know, I might just think of something and tweet it.  Shouldn't you be asleep?  Don't you ever shoot it?  All right, mommy.  Shut it.  Yeah, I don't know.  I wonder where all that's going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where is this going? 
[01:13:00]  I wonder where it's all going.  They got to figure that shit out.  Well, they can do.  It's just the public forum.  Yeah.  It'll never change.  It will never change.  It is simply the public forum.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  Some people, I think it's up to the, what they call celebrities, to leave.  Well, they are, too.  They're thinking the general public.  Yeah, they absolutely are.  And, you know, the celebrities have been, you know, pushing Twitter forward.  Yeah.  The celebrities made Twitter pretty fucking, you see it all the time.  I mean, guys like Chris Brown, because they're damaging themselves, because they can't shut up. 
[01:13:30]  Fucking.  Donald Trump recently tweeted, he's like, if they don't, you know, take care of, can you find his tweet?  Maybe I don't want to, like.  What's his name?  Misrepresent it.  But he basically said, if they don't figure this shit out, you know.  What's he going to figure out?  He fucking, he's basically done the same thing to the other, like, he wants to attack everybody he wants to attack.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And again, I have no problem with Trump attacking people, but he doesn't like hearing it on Twitter.  Then don't be in a public forum like that.  It's what it is.  Yeah, it is what it is.  Or just don't read your app mentions. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I'm trying to.  He doesn't have to read his app mentions.  Uh, what's his name from fucking Punk'd?  You know, he used to be a.  Ashton.  Ashton Kutcher used to be on Twitter all the time.  Used to be a big one.  But then he fucked up.  Right.  And he was a baby boy who couldn't handle and just tell people, I'm sorry, I fucked up.  I said something I didn't mean.  Like, you know what I mean?  The paternal thing.  Yeah.  Little fucking celebrity pussy that ran to his fucking publicist.  Can you do it for me?  I made a mistake. 
[01:14:30]  You fucking jizzbag.  Just fucking write for yourself.  Oh, yuck.  Yeah.  Uh, Opie has nothing to say on this topic, considering he took a check from, uh, Ashton  Kutcher's people recently.  Oh, wow.  I just fucking write.  He, uh.  Might have not did a little something for their production company.  Oh, right, right, right.  But you know what I'm saying.  Dude, I'm just, it's, I'm totally joking.  But these guys, like, uh, they get into a little controversy.  Yeah.  And again.  He still has a Twitter, but it's not as popular anymore because his people took it over. 
[01:15:00]  Who would follow that?  Like, anybody that follows Ashton Kutcher, like, and you remembered that you follow him.  Right.  Everyone should unfollow the guy if he's not, unless you're really interested in what his  people have to say.  Right.  Who the fuck wants to live to a, listen to a cunty publicist or a fucking, like, a web  management team.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what these celebrities are getting.  Like the Iron Chief.  They're actually called social networking teams.  That's it.  That's it, yes.  They're actually getting teams together.  So then there's a group of people, they decide if the tweet's gonna, you know, offend anyone, 
[01:15:30]  and if it does, is that okay for what we're trying to do here?  Dude, do you know how many people-  They're overthinking tweets now.  You know how many people, like, a celebrity's statement used to have to go through before  they released it?  And now you get firsthand, here's what this guy's thinking at this second and gets him  in trouble?  But as the weeks go by, not as much.  I mean, that shit is being shut down by most of the-  That's what I mean, yeah.  Most of the publicists and the handlers, yeah.  Yep.  So. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Celebrities aren't gonna leave it, though.  There's just two-  We all wanna be heard.  Well, they're gonna leave it.  It's gonna be, you know, it's gonna go the way of Ashton Kutcher for a lot of these guys.  That's what I mean by leaving.  Yeah.  You're not gonna get those pure thoughts anymore.  I had to stop following a lot of people, peers.  I stopped-  I actually-  You were following peers.  Yeah.  I stopped following him.  Fucking George Costanza.  I had to stop following him.  Why?  Ah, yeah.  I just wanna remember George Costanza and not fucking, you know-  He's not good. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  He's just a terrible liberal piece of shit.  Oh.  I thought it was because he wasn't funny on Twitter.  Well, that too.  You know.  Oh.  He's not funny.  But, um-  Of course all those guys are liberal.  Yeah.  Every Seinfeld guy's liberal.  I know, but he just really-  Maybe not Kramer so much.  Well, no.  But the rest of them are certainly-  Michael Richards, yeah.  One of your favorite shows of all time.  All those guys were uber-liberals.  Jason Alexander puts these fucking tweet-longer manifestos up there- 
[01:17:00]  Oh, man.  About everything, you know.  Yeah.  I haven't read a tweet-longer in years.  Yeah.  That is an-  You just don't click on those.  Nope.  Nope.  I don't click.  I have mixed feelings when I read something like that.  Like, sometimes it annoys me, but I never respond to them publicly because I'm like,  I'm not following them.  Yeah.  I really do hold that.  Like, I'm not-  I mean, if you're following them, that's one thing.  But I'm like, I'm not following them, they're not talking to me.  Yeah.  It's not my business what they say.  And then people are like, what?  It's the public-  Thank you.  It's like, no.  You follow somebody, you should be interested in what they say. 
[01:17:30]  If you're not following somebody and somebody retweets them-  Uh-huh.  Yell at the person who retweeted it, you fucking cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah, you weren't supposed to see it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I agree.  But it's appealing, it's the public forum.  That's like saying you're walking into a room.  We're holding a conversation in this room.  Um, and you realize-  And then you stand there and overhear stuff and make remarks.  Yeah.  Well, it's like, you didn't really mean to be in this room. 
[01:18:00]  So just get the fuck out of it.  Just leave.  Just leave.  Block the guy who retweeted it.  Hey, I don't want to follow any guy that retweets this type of garbage.  Mm-hmm.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know where it's headed.  It's kind of-  I think it's at the crossroads.  I think it's trying to figure itself out.  Yeah.  Right?  The same post up ahead.  Twitter's gonna be a tough one, man.  Something will come along.  But man, it's an immediate interaction with all these people.  That's a tough one to talk.  It's had longevity, too, man. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, think about it.  Been around for quite some time.  Yeah, three or four years.  Yeah, you scroll down on some people and you see four years.  Yeah.  They tweeted something four years ago.  I think I'm in four-  Am I four years ago?  Four years.  I remember talking about Twitter and you guys were like,  what's this fucking Twitter crap?  First thing I ever heard about Twitter was some guy that fucking was in a plane crash.  Plane crash?  And they said he had tweeted, like, his Twitter said that, holy shit, I was just in a plane crash. 
[01:19:00]  And I was like, what the fuck is Twitter?  And that was only three, four years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like four years.  It was around before that, but it started really hitting the masses about three years.  I'm trying to remember, four years ago?  Probably four years ago.  It really started hitting the masses.  Yeah.  But it was around a good year before that.  It wasn't the Sully plane crash asshole.  Damn.  I should block you.  Let's talk about the NYPD cop.  So what's this all about?  Cannibal cop?  Cannibal cop.  His wife, like, she sensed like he was not, the sex had kind of dried up after she had the baby. 
[01:19:30]  And he was spending a lot of time online.  And she went one night and looked on his laptop and this dumb motherfucker left his laptop.  Thank God he was a dope.  She's lucky she wasn't married to me.  But even I have left my laptop open when I shouldn't have, you know.  Yeah, that'll do it.  And she saw this really weird website, like, even going to, like, this, uh, uh, torture website and hardcore fetish thing. 
[01:20:00]  But, so she confronted him about it.  And I guess he, I don't know how he got defensive, but she said after that the sex got, like, wet, like he couldn't come with her.  So I'm guessing while he was fucking her, he might have been fantasizing about this stuff.  That was Sal, right.  Stupid Sal.  Oh, poor Sal.  But, uh, the sex got worse.  Right.  And then she said he started asking weird questions about her routine and encouraging her to jog at night and asking her, is that a dimly lit street or, like, the people there or just asking weird questions. 
[01:20:30]  So she installed a spyware on his computer, like a key logger.  Oh, shit.  And then she got the mother load.  And, uh, she said he encouraged me to run at night and he became very interested in my running routine.  And, uh, she installed a key logger.  The next morning she checked the spyware and saw a lot of websites I'd never seen before that had pictures of feet that weren't attached to bodies.  Whoa.  She went to a website that she didn't know about.  There was a woman on the front page. 
[01:21:00]  She was dangling.  She was naked.  There was blood all over her.  And she said she read all these chats he was having, I guess, with other people about her.  The wife.  Whoa.  He wanted, he was, she said I was going to be tied up by my feet and my throat was going to be slit.  And they were going to have fun watching the blood gush out of me because I was young.  Um, and she said that, uh, one of her, like her friends, he was naming by name, like that he wanted to kill.  And she said he talked about devising an apparatus so the girls could be on the spit for 30 minute shifts and would be taken down so they would live longer. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  Like brutal torture shit.  Um, again, I don't know how real any of this was though.  Right.  But they said in the daily news that, uh, they, searching through his computer, they learned, uh, that he had attempted to contact potential victims, including one of his wife's former coworkers to find out more about their routines and their jobs, which is, uh, like he had been Googling all this stuff at the best rope to tie someone up with. 
[01:22:00]  And again, it could have just been this weird role play thing.  Right, right, right.  But like he was attempting to contact people.  What a sick fuck.  Like, and I'm a dirty, and again, it shouldn't be illegal to fantasize.  Ooh, but you don't know if he was gonna, you know, make that next step.  But he was, she said he was.  Future crime.  It's a future crime.  She said he was asking questions about her routine, but that could have just been for the fantasy.  I mean, who knows?  But that's.  Yeah.  Imagine being married to a fucking creep like this.  That's, that's crazy.  And, and someone pointed out that he looks like Adam Ferrara. 
[01:22:30]  And he really does.  Yeah.  Let me see that picture.  Hey there, pal.  I'm gonna eat my wife.  Yeah.  I just want to cook her tits, pal.  I'm gonna drive a fast car over a tits and then cook them.  What's the guy's crime, by the way?  I don't know.  Besides being incredibly creepy.  I honestly don't know.  I don't know what he's being charged with.  Obviously out of his mind.  Yeah, he might not have really committed a crime.  Yeah.  Is he being charged with, um.  I'm sure they can find something.  Yeah, like conspiring to. 
[01:23:00]  Conspiring to commit a murder or.  Yeah.  I'm sure they'll find something out of all that, but.  Mmm.  That's the guy I hope loses his job.  You don't want that guy carrying a gun.  No.  He, is he still a cop?  I don't know.  I mean, maybe, he must be on, he must be on leave.  But cannibal cop.  Hopefully he'll kill himself.  Cannibal cop.  I know I say that a lot, but like the guys like this.  It's like, if you're really online talking about cutting your wife's throat.  Yeah.  And like, you're asking her.  You're just a psychopath.  I'm sorry. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, there's gonna be problems.  You're fucking nuts.  There's gonna be problems.  I know, I've talked about some dirty things.  Ooh.  But how do you get turned on?  Like, thinking about your wife bleeding.  Like, I don't, I can see why that would make a person laugh.  Yeah.  You know, it would make you applaud.  But I can't see.  Jimmy does, uh, think about dirty things.  Yeah.  Can you, uh, I don't know.  I don't know if you can.  Tell me.  The one you were talking about yesterday on the way home.  Oh, yeah.  You made me laugh so hard yesterday.  I'll just say, nah, I don't want to say. 
[01:24:00]  Uh, I'll just say I've fantasized.  His fantasies get a little crazy.  A little dark sometimes.  Oh, boy.  A little dark.  Yeah.  But I guess I can see how that could spiral out of control.  I guess I could understand that.  Right.  But, uh, where you, you know, you start to, like, if a woman, like, well, and again, this  is actually years ago.  I don't know what to say, but it was just a dark fantasy.  Okay, I wasn't sure.  Oh, it's a little dark.  Yeah, I'll tell you all.  I didn't think, I didn't think anything crazy.  But yeah, yeah.  I didn't think any differently about you. 
[01:24:30]  You know, it's obvious you were in a fantasy fucking situation.  She's being dirty, but the idea of doing it never occurred to me.  But I understand how a dark fantasy like that.  Can you, Jimmy, uh, the best, the punchline is the best part, where she.  Just stop talking to me.  Yeah, it got too weird.  But I can.  She never talked to Jimmy again.  That's how weird he got in this.  I can see.  Not in a bad way, like we're talking about here, certainly.  But I see how dark stuff, like, I can be very dark. 
[01:25:00]  Like, like, really fucking in fantasy with a girl, if we get into that fucking weird zone.  Right.  Where we just keep going.  Yeah.  Yes, man, like, fucking really weird.  But I know the idea of doing those things is incomprehensible.  Does it need a safe word?  No, no, no, no.  No, okay.  We're texting.  Oh, texting.  We're talking, not in person.  Oh, okay.  But he went a little too far, and she never talked to me again.  Oh.  Yeah.  She creeped out.  The great Colin Quinn.  First of all, did he just actually stand there with a serious, sincere look and go, 
[01:25:30]  the idea of doing those things would never occur to me.  I'm a liar.  No, I really wouldn't have done them.  Like, but I understand how you could be really fucking dark.  What things?  Well, I didn't say it.  I didn't want to get into it.  It's very rare that I won't.  Exactly, because you would have done them, and we all would have.  No.  Yes.  The reason I'm calling is speaking of dark places, and I'm not even joking right now,  guys. 
[01:26:00]  First of all, what a party, Les.  I mean, that was fun.  That was great.  Yeah.  Great to see everybody.  That party really let us know we are finished suburban squares.  That was...  Squares.  Speaking of dark places.  That is right.  By the way, you're right.  That party should have been empty.  It should have been Tom and his wife and two of their fucking PTA friends, and the rest  of us should have said, go fuck yourself.  We're not going to that.  But we did.  You're right.  That's how it started a couple of years ago.  Now, last night, they couldn't drag us out of there. 
[01:26:30]  Speaking of dark places, Jim Norton unfollowed me on Twitter about a month and a half ago.  Oh!  Here's what I'm saying.  First of all, whatever explanation he comes up with is going to be so distorted.  Second of all, here's my theory.  I'll just give you my theory.  Yeah.  It's creep.  First of all, who unfollows?  What are we, high school kids?  Second of all, my theory is it was two things. 
[01:27:00]  One's creepier than the next.  One is he unfollowed me because I dare, if he asked his fans, who I was one of, and I'm  still following him, if what we thought of Jim Norton.com, and I gave an honest appraisal.  No!  Second of all, which is even worse, is that he's making a clean break.  And just that he follows you guys, Patrice, who, as we know, is no longer with us.  Some obscure writer and some girl.  And it's the creepiest thing ever. 
[01:27:30]  And if he actually unfollowed me and the rest of his friends, because he's making a clean  break, and he's like, you know, I'm just going to unfollow a few people who really work  pure and clean.  It's nauseating.  I'll tell you what happened.  No.  Since you asked.  No.  When at Jim Norton.com, I actually wanted people to trash that.  I was so mad at that web guy.  All of that was, of course, please bash it, because it was awful.  It was awful, that website, and I wanted people to attack it.  So I was attacking it.  I mean, I would never look at that piece of shit website and think it was good. 
[01:28:00]  I'm having it redone by another guy.  So I was retweeting comments about how horrible it was.  And I was actually going, I was so disgusted with other people, I was going to unfollow  everybody.  Everybody.  And the only reason I didn't, I couldn't, the only reason I didn't unfollow everybody  is obviously I work with Open Ant, I want to follow, but I would have unfollowed them  too.  But I couldn't unfollow Patrice.  And I couldn't just have me following my dead friend.  It's too weird.  So I'm like, the only people I'll follow are the two guys that I work with, Patrice and 
[01:28:30]  Ozzy.  That was it.  I wasn't going to follow anybody, and I'm slowly starting to again.  I just got disgusted with everybody.  But it wasn't a clean break.  But yeah, I unfollowed every fucking person.  But don't you think it's very weird that you unfollowed me, maybe a few other of your  friends?  No.  It's weird.  It's not weird.  It's sick. 
[01:29:00]  It's not sick.  It's not sick.  I don't think that's a very good argument.  All right, I'll tell you what.  All right, well, you're asking, so I'll tell you.  But what it was, I was doing a show, I was trying to get a show together, where I was  getting comics to do, you know, I had four episodes, and I asked comics, and a couple  of comics said, yeah, they would do it.  And some guys said they couldn't do it or wouldn't do it.  But then, like, you know, honestly, Kyle, your manager really never gave a fucking answer. 
[01:29:30]  Like, he wouldn't, he never gave us an answer.  So I wasn't going to say, go fuck.  Like, I, maybe in your position, I wouldn't have done it either.  Like, it may have just been a reason why you weren't able to do it.  But the guy never got back to, like, my manager.  He never gave us an answer.  So I kind of felt like, ugh, all right.  It just felt weird to not get an answer.  What the hell?  First of all, I saw you, and you go, hey, if you can't do it, I understand.  Three weeks before, so this is all this happening against me, because my manager didn't call 
[01:30:00]  back your manager.  No, I'm just telling you.  I wasn't, it was, it wasn't just you.  It was, don't, dude, it wasn't just you.  What?  You didn't stop unfollowing my manager.  You stopped unfollowing me.  I stopped unfollowing every comic.  You're a sicko.  Let me tell you something.  No, no, dude, that's.  That's why you're sick.  Why am I sick?  There's a number of times when we had all a little falling out, and then you berated  at me legitimately on OB and Anthony, where you go, yeah, don't just not talk to me.  Tell me the problem. 
[01:30:30]  And you were right.  But I.  And I had to sit there and take it.  Well, guess what?  The shoe's on the other foot now, isn't it?  But I did.  But you know what?  I didn't even know, to be honest with you, how right I was.  Because it's like.  You were 100% wrong.  No, no, no.  You told me that that wasn't even resolved.  They were still working on the dates.  Okay, but I'm just saying your manager didn't get.  It was like, almost like Jonathan had asked him again, and he didn't get back to us.  So it was like, whatever.  Whatever the reason was.  You didn't tell me that.  Okay, but I'm just telling you what happened behind the scenes.  So that's.  I know, but you have to admit, all of that, even if all of that was 100% true. 
[01:31:00]  It is.  Which is.  No, it's not.  Of course it is.  I didn't know you didn't get back to.  Oh, maybe you didn't.  All right.  100% true.  The fact that you responded by unfollowing me on Twitter.  We really are in junior high school.  No, but it's one of those things where when you're on Twitter.  Just sit here and take the humiliations.  I'm not.  I'm going to give a legit answer.  When things.  If something's bothering me that people do, and I just keep seeing them pop up, I just  keep thinking about them.  And I'm starting to follow people again. 
[01:31:30]  But yeah, it bothered me.  Not the fact that people wouldn't do it, but it's like, I guess we are in a competitive  business.  I'll tell you a fucking.  I was just like, fuck.  I'm just telling you.  That's why I was.  I've been on a.  You know, I wasn't going to say anything.  About it because I know that maybe I'm just being a fucking baby and my feelings were  hurting.  Fuck me.  Okay.  Fair enough.  So I wasn't going to make a big public issue out of it, but it's hard to look at everybody's  Twitter feed when you're feeling a certain way.  But it wasn't a fuck you.  Hey, look. 
[01:32:00]  Yes, it was.  No, it wasn't.  It's fine.  But no.  Who cares if I follow?  Twitter feed when you're feeling a certain way.  You're sitting there fuming.  And my little cutesy pie tweet.  No.  Cutesy pie.  No, I wasn't fuming.  I wasn't fuming.  You unfollowed me.  I unfollowed everybody.  Except for.  No.  You really are a resentful creep.  Oh, shit.  But that's not being a resentful creep.  It's like.  Yes, it is. 
[01:32:30]  Dude, there were comments that didn't get back to me.  That didn't even answer.  And I was like, you know what?  Fuck everybody.  That was just kind of how I felt.  I was like, fuck everybody.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  So now I'm not doing the show.  It's like.  It happened.  Huh?  It bugs me.  It bugs me the most.  The day it happened.  One of your followers goes.  Jim Norton unfollowed you.  So I was like.  Ah, there's no way that happened.  I just kind of laughed it off.  I was like.  Jim did not follow me.  It's absurd.  But then. 
[01:33:00]  Just yesterday.  Look.  I'm going to see who Jim follows.  I saw six people.  Opie, Anthony, Patrice.  And by the way.  And then some guy, Jim.  Some obscure writer.  Ozzy.  Which is annoying, of course, to everybody.  I know.  Ozzy, the icon that I asked to do something with me.  And he says yes.  Yeah.  Well.  Anyway.  Oh.  That's what.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  I never would have mentioned this.  And I'm starting to go back to it again.  But it was more like. 
[01:33:30]  We don't want you back.  I don't.  I speak for me and all the other people.  That have been shunned by you.  Hey.  Look.  I just didn't want.  I was actually only following four.  And I just started following people again.  You know.  Michelle Beadle and one other person.  But that was why I didn't.  And I didn't want to have a discussion about it.  That was why I just unfollowed everybody.  It wasn't some selective thing.  Well.  A, B, and C.  I'm just like.  You know what?  All the comedians.  And this is a very general rule.  All the comics that have been coming on this show for years.  And again.  I know that it's different than doing stand up on a TV show. 
[01:34:00]  I believe me.  I know that.  But it's like.  I feel like I'm really.  I'm pretty good at the comics.  And I try to be protective of comics.  And so many fucking comics.  And obviously not you.  Or Bobby.  Or Voss.  But so many comics don't see.  The motherfuckering they almost get in here.  They really don't see it.  And stupid codependent.  I told my girl last week from Opie and Phil Byron.  Mark Cuban's fucking butt.  But I'm not.  Yeah.  But I'm not.  I'm fucking going there with a baseball bat.  I'm talking about.  I'm talking about people that never see it. 
[01:34:30]  Never know it.  I'm talking about people that a lot of times don't even wind up on the show.  Or are going to get bashed.  And just like a little codependent fucking cocksucker.  I step in and stop it and try to protect them because they're fellow comics.  And it's like this fucking weird.  And you've done more for me than most people ever have.  That's why it was more like hey man I was bothered by it.  But I'm telling you.  I paid you back by unfollowing me.  It wasn't paying you back.  It wasn't a payback.  Who gives a fuck?  I don't have as many followers as you.  You know.  I can't afford to lose one. 
[01:35:00]  But that's what you know.  And there was other things that happened with other comics that had unrelated.  Where I'm just like you know like where certain comedians were asked certain things.  And they don't respond.  And I'm like you know I'm such a naive dumb motherfucker.  But I'm thinking like yeah we just do each other's stuff.  It's what we do.  Like I couldn't picture if a comic that people respected.  This is what it really came down to.  If a comic that people really respected had a show and asked them to do a set on it. 
[01:35:30]  They would absolutely do it.  And I know they like me.  And believe me I know they respect.  But if I pick Chris or fucking Gervais or one of those guys or Seinfeld.  Whatever fucking comic you want to name.  Had a show.  And he was doing it and asking people to do 10 minute sets.  I understand those are much bigger acts.  And I get why they would do it.  But it was just like a reality check for me.  Like who the fuck are you to think you have this bond with these guys.  It's a business.  And it's competitive.  So fucking.  I've been such a dummy.  You know.  And again. 
[01:36:00]  I don't want to do it.  I don't want to do it.  This is spinning.  That's what it is.  But that's the truth.  The bottom line is.  This is spinning to you as the victim.  I'm the victim.  I'm not a victim.  I've been unfollowed on Twitter.  I'm not a victim.  I just.  You know.  It was like.  I've been unfollowed on Twitter.  And I don't like it.  Well.  I don't like your secret resentment this whole time.  It wasn't a secret resentment.  I hadn't seen you.  No it wasn't.  I actually.  I checked your.  I checked your feed quite a bit.  Believe me.  Right now.  If I had a secret resentment.  I would tell you.  Second of all. 
[01:36:30]  I don't like the fact that it was.  The irony of ironies.  You called me on my secret resentment about three years ago.  Get the tape.  And.  And now here it is.  Biting your back.  Yeah.  But I also am aware.  That I am like.  You're only aware because I call up this morning.  No.  I'm aware.  I've discussed this with.  You know.  Opie and Anthony.  I think kind of knew.  Because I talk to them about it.  And I also know that my fucking.  Hurt feelings.  Like a dumb baby.  Is a part of the problem.  Like I understand that. 
[01:37:00]  I'm not a victim.  Like.  Everybody fucked me.  I get.  That half of it is my perception.  There were.  Look.  I feel that certain people should have got back to me.  In a more timely fashion.  I think as a friend that would have been.  And I'm not even talking about you at this moment.  I'm legitimately not.  But.  I understand that I play a part of it.  That's why I didn't make a big deal of it.  And unfollow people selectively.  That would have been a cunty baby move.  And if it wasn't for Patrice.  I just couldn't bring myself to unfollow Patrice.  I would have followed zero people.  I didn't want to fucking look at anybody's Twitter feed. 
[01:37:30]  But I checked yours quite a few times.  I checked quite a few other people's quite a few times.  But that's what it came down to.  By the way.  Let me just say one last thing.  Yes.  Since we're on the subject.  Since we're being semi real.  Which is.  I would be in chamber.  We would have this little thing.  We'd have a couple of zingers back and forth.  You know.  At Jim Norton.  At Kyle.  We'd have to include each other.  And I should have noticed.  I knew something was up.  But I really.  I couldn't imagine.  This ludicrousness.  Of this man shunning me like this.  After all this shit. 
[01:38:00]  And.  I threw a couple of zingers his way.  And nothing.  And I retweeted one.  A wall of silence.  I retweeted them.  No.  Imagine to you.  The shame.  A grown man.  The shame.  First of all.  I only saw.  Two.  I only saw two zingers.  And the one I retweeted.  You checked it on my Twitter all the time.  I only see two zingers.  I don't check it all the time.  I don't check it obsessively.  But I've checked it quite a few times.  No further questions.  No.  I think that. 
[01:38:30]  Come on man.  Your guy could have.  He didn't get back to my guy.  He was like.  Yeah.  I'm still trying to get an answer.  It was like.  Alright.  Like.  I just figured.  I would have gotten an answer.  And then.  And then I figured.  People just didn't want to do it.  Alright.  They didn't want to do it.  But I guess.  But then it makes me feel like.  Alright.  I guess if I'm doing something.  No.  But you.  First of all.  You yourself said.  I even called in.  That the.  You yourself said.  The money was garbage.  And you told me.  Sitting at the table.  That night.  Hey man.  If you don't want to do it.  And if it had been that important.  Of course.  I would have done it.  But I mean.  I didn't even get an answer out of the guy. 
[01:39:00]  I understand that.  First of all.  We had the money.  We got the money doubled.  To try to entice people.  We got the money doubled.  Can I.  You got it doubled?  Up to.  No.  800 bucks.  It's great.  We got it.  We got it doubled.  Can I ask one dumb question please?  Sure.  Why don't you guys.  If you guys are having an issue.  Whether it's.  Why don't you pick up the phone.  And talk to each other.  That's what I did.  I pick up the phone.  And call this morning.  No.  I know.  But this is.  This goes back a while.  At this point.  I'll tell you why.  When it first started.  And again.  I'm not.  What?  Because I didn't even know what was happening really. 
[01:39:30]  Well when we.  Dude.  If this first started.  Right.  Asked you to do it.  You were the first guy I asked to do it.  And you called up.  And you were joking.  But then you were like.  You know.  Ask my manager.  Like I'm joking.  But talk to my fucking manager.  Like.  You were kidding.  Hold on.  But you were kidding.  And being.  You know.  Being Colin.  But then it happened.  And I wasn't hearing back.  And I'm like.  Oh God.  He kind of meant that.  Like.  Don't come to me.  Go to him.  So it's like.  Come on man.  How would you feel if you would be.  You would feel like a little weird about it.  But.  I'm not delusional enough to think.  That everybody should want to do my shit. 
[01:40:00]  And it is a business.  And people are competitive.  And people.  Or people are doing their own shit.  They just got their own thing.  They're concentrating on.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  I realize that too.  That's why.  Why do you think I didn't go on a motherfuck everybody thing?  I realize that my.  I'm saying that you did.  Okay.  When you.  I'm twirl.  I'm followers.  You're saying motherfuck everybody.  Nah.  It's not motherfucking.  No it's not.  If I motherfuck people.  Dude.  I motherfuck people more obviously than that.  What's that? 
[01:40:30]  I can't believe I.  Nah.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I'm just saying this is an outrage.  Well you know I just.  Again if it was.  If it was just this situation.  But it wasn't just this situation.  It was a few other things.  And then there were people that responded yes immediately.  People that I expected to.  But then I didn't hear.  And I'm like.  What it more made me realize was that this feeling like.  There.  If people are independently coming to this conclusion.  If they're.  You guys didn't talk it over. 
[01:41:00]  You and A.B.  It wasn't like a conspiracy against Norton.  People.  You know.  Well you know what I mean.  I would almost feel honored if it was.  But if it was.  If people came to this conclusion independently.  Well then obviously that's the fucking.  That's.  That's the way it is.  You know what I mean.  I'm not delusional enough to think.  That everybody talked it over.  This is obviously.  When left.  You know.  When people just had to think of this.  Nobody wanted to do it.  So.  Fair enough.  What am I going to do.  Tell everybody they're wrong. 
[01:41:30]  They must not be wrong.  If they're all saying no.  Okay.  They're all saying no.  So I accept the no.  You know.  Without.  You know.  Hey.  You're a kind of.  But it just made.  And I literally.  It just kind of made me reevaluate.  Not.  The friends I have.  I've seen you since then.  I haven't been like.  Fuck you.  You know.  It's like.  Yeah.  Whatever.  It is what it is.  But behind the scenes.  The comics I try to get on.  I'm like.  Fuck that.  Fuck them.  Like.  Why would I help people.  When I look back.  Like you.  Guys that have done most shit for me. 
[01:42:00]  Are you.  Louis C.  K.  There's a few guys that have really.  Done shit for me.  Like as friends.  And as comedians.  So it's like.  What can I say.  Like.  I didn't ask Louis to do this.  But I know he wouldn't have done it.  What am I going to say.  Fuck Louis.  He put me on his show.  He took care of me.  You've taken care of me.  I can't say fuck guys.  That have taken care of me.  And have genuinely involved me in their careers.  Like I can't.  But you have.  No I have.  You have followed me on Twitter.  That's not a fuck you though.  Fuck you.  No it's not.  Silly.  I don't exist anywhere else.  What's that?  I don't exist anywhere else. 
[01:42:30]  It's the only way to.  To fuck me.  And you didn't.  You shouldn't even exist there.  I don't.  I don't.  That's not a fuck you.  I'm telling you.  If it was a fuck you.  I think you'd sense it.  It's not a fuck you.  I just don't want to see what people are talking about.  I don't want to hear what's going on with people's this and people's that.  I wasn't interested.  I'm like.  Because then I get something.  And I'm excited about it.  And I'm not saying it's the fucking greatest thing ever.  But when I can't get anybody to do it.  I'm like.  Fuck.  What am I doing?  Like it was a wake up call to me.  Like what am I fucking doing? 
[01:43:00]  Fucking involving myself with all the other comics.  You want to do this?  You want to do that?  You want to come in?  Fuck everybody.  Like what?  Let everybody worry about themselves.  Which is what everybody does.  But Jimmy.  I just got to say one thing.  Like to a lot of people.  Being unfollowed is kind of like.  It hurts the ego a little bit.  So you might want to explain that more.  Is all I'm saying.  I didn't.  I wasn't hearing back from people.  Like what am I doing?  I wasn't.  And I unfollowed comics.  It had nothing to do with this.  Right.  People that had nothing to do with this.  But it was like.  Maybe that's it.  But that's not a fuck you to people publicly. 
[01:43:30]  Because I honestly don't think anybody notices who I follow.  Who gives a shit?  And I think people might now realize.  You know.  Colin realized what someone told him.  But how would you feel if you had a show.  And people.  And I understand the conversation you and I had.  But like.  If I asked my manager.  I'm like.  Did so.  Like did this.  And it wasn't just you.  Didn't get back to us.  He's like.  No.  They never got back.  Well they took a month to answer.  It's like.  Jesus Christ.  I am a lot lower down on the fucking scale than I thought.  And that's my fault.  That's nobody else's fault. 
[01:44:00]  So unfollowing people.  I just don't want to hear their conversations.  That's not.  Maybe it seems like a fuck you in this day and day.  But it's really not.  I just don't want to hear the conversations.  I'm tired of involving myself with other fucking comics.  I've been doing that for so long.  Like.  Let's do that.  Let's do that.  I'm like.  What am I?  A fucking.  Robert Townsend.  I did no disrespect to him.  But fuck him.  Just want to bring comics on stage.  No disrespect to him.  But fuck him.  That's great.  But you know what I mean?  It was like a wake up call.  And there was a couple of people that I asked.  That literally never responded. 
[01:44:30]  I told my manager.  Fuck that cocksucker.  Pull the offer back.  Fuck him.  And then I wound up not doing the show.  Because we couldn't get certain.  You know.  So it's like.  Whatever.  So I was just like.  Ah.  Fuck everybody man.  What am I doing?  Involving myself.  Even in this.  And hey.  Let's do gigs together.  Like.  What a faggot I am.  And I really mean.  I was this annoyed at myself.  I didn't.  I didn't have vitriolic conversations.  Fuck Carl.  I really didn't feel that way.  I was like.  If everyone comes to this conclusion.  Then the conclusion is telling me something. 
[01:45:00]  It's not like everybody said yes.  And one guy said no.  So I'm like.  Fuck that guy.  You can't.  The difference between me and a paranoid person.  Is I recognized.  That a bunch of people coming to a conclusion separately.  I'm the common denominator.  So I have to recognize that.  Have to recognize it.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Thanks a lot Carl.  Will you be following Colin?  It's.  It's the idea.  If I was going to follow. 
[01:45:30]  Once I start following comics.  Of course I'll follow Colin.  But it's.  Because he makes me.  You know.  Colin makes me laugh.  But it's literally.  I'm not following any comedians.  It was like.  That's what it is.  Except for Patrice.  And even the people that I've started to follow.  Because I'm like.  I don't want to just see fucking.  You know.  Aussie fucking twitters once a month.  And open ant.  I'll see sometimes.  It's not.  Eight hours.  Before they don't tweet.  I miss seeing certain things.  But.  I'm not following any comics.  And I'm not saying I never will again.  I don't care if comics follow me.  Don't follow.  You know.  I didn't look at it like it was a fuck you. 
[01:46:00]  I believe me.  I don't think anybody.  What.  No I don't.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I'm not that good at being passive aggressive.  We go back a long way.  Yes.  I mean that's not the most passive aggressive move ever.  No it's not.  I don't know what to say.  Because a passive aggressive.  It was just a random thing.  Oh jeez.  I just decided to make a clean break.  When you were in.  I admit it was a passive aggressive angry act.  It didn't feel angry.  I was just like.  I unfollowed.  I'm telling you.  I unfollowed everybody. 
[01:46:30]  But I'm.  Why are you not hearing what I'm telling you.  When I'm telling you.  It sounds like bullshit.  That's bullshit.  Recognizing that everybody comes to the same conclusion.  That I'm the fucking comment.  How is that bullshit.  You can't be more honest than to say that.  It would be bullshit if I was blaming everybody else.  But I'm not.  I'm not blaming everybody else.  Here we are having a pseudo discussion slash argument.  Which is not really that much of an argument.  And I'm not blaming you.  I'm not. 
[01:47:00]  If it was just Colin.  Or just.  I would blame.  But it wasn't.  Who else was it?  I'm not even going to say.  And I didn't want to have that discussion.  That's why I unfollowed everybody.  Because I didn't.  How many people was it?  At least give me that.  Four or five.  And a couple had reasons.  At least give me that.  Were you at the dinner?  Was I there with you at the dinner?  At least give me that Senator.  Well I don't know why.  You know.  Colin is refusing to come on this show and debate me.  We've asked him.  But no.  You're wrong.  About it being a passive aggressive act. 
[01:47:30]  It wasn't.  It would have been passive aggressive.  If I unfollowed people selectively.  Now I'll make a statement.  But I didn't think.  It's like if you're unfollowing everybody.  I'm obviously not going to kill myself.  So people are just like.  Oh he's unfollowing him.  I didn't think that was a statement.  Because I'm not following any comics.  Jim you're nothing to me now.  You're not a brother.  You're not a friend.  Oh Jesus.  I don't want to see you at the comedy cellar.  I don't want to see you in my house.  You know how happy I am that you tripped on comedy cellar?  Oh man. 
[01:48:00]  I want to know a day in advance.  How big an issue is this Colin on a scale of 1 to 10 as far as a friendship?  Probably like.  I mean it's 10 the highest.  Yeah.  4.  Oh okay.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even say.  I wouldn't even say it's that because.  At least from my place.  Because I've seen you.  We did the benefit together.  I saw you last.  And I'm telling you.  I don't feel.  But he didn't have this info though.  And now I realize what you were doing. 
[01:48:30]  But you're wrong.  You only got this info what?  Yesterday Colin?  I realize now what he did at the benefit.  What did I get the benefit?  Beautiful new build.  And he said you know what?  I'll say hello to these cocksuckers.  No.  In the name of Patrice.  I'll fucking smile and say hello.  That's.  That's your paranoia.  That's wrong.  I'm telling you that's wrong.  I'm going to.  Believe me.  I would be.  If you're a bigger man.  It's in honor of him.  I'll say hello.  No.  That's not true.  But the day I see them on Twitter.  It's the day I'll fucking. 
[01:49:00]  Put bamboo into my nails.  It'll never happen.  No.  That's not true.  I'm not a good enough actor.  As we've all seen.  To pull that off.  I'm not a good enough actor to hide.  When you're in studio.  And when I see you at the benefit.  And when I see you last.  I'm.  I'm really not good enough.  To pretend.  You probably think Oprah and Bill Barr on me.  No.  I'm not.  No.  I'm not good enough to.  To fucking.  To hide that.  At all.  At all.  I'm not.  I told you.  I just was like. 
[01:49:30]  I had to come to the conclusion that these guys didn't talk it over man.  So you know.  Sometimes you.  I didn't.  How could you tell me I'm full of shit.  When I'm saying that I kind of.  It was a heartbreaking.  But I'm like.  If I.  I'm the fucking.  It was my delusional.  It's not everybody else.  Like.  I'm admitting that.  Like.  I'm not saying it's you.  I'm not motherfucking.  I'm not saying you're saying it.  But I'm saying your actions.  Stop saying saying.  Your actions are just the opposite.  Your actions are like.  Fuck you.  No they're not.  If I was.  If I was.  If I was.  If you're all. 
[01:50:00]  If you're all.  If you're all philosophical.  You're trying to act like.  Yes.  I realize.  But I did.  But no.  What do you.  What do you think.  That I'm fucking.  That good at being passive aggressive.  That me just not following someone on Twitter.  Is the best I can do to be a cunt.  Like come on dude.  I'm not that good at hiding it.  You would have known.  You would have felt it in person.  Or you would have fucking sensed it.  By something I tweeted.  Or something I said.  I just.  Come on.  No you gave me the silent treatment.  I didn't give you the silent treatment.  I said you're a bunch of the usual singers.  That we used to go back and forth laughing. 
[01:50:30]  First of all.  Dead silent.  First of all.  No silence.  I've read two zingers from you.  And I read.  I thought you were sending me some.  But then I realized to me.  That he was a guy named.  I am column quim.  Who's a.  Oh that asshole.  Yeah.  But okay.  But then I realized.  Okay.  I thought it was you.  And it wasn't even you.  So I've read two zingers from you.  And I retweeted one of them.  That's ludicrous.  I've said you were at least 10 in the past month.  I haven't read them. 
[01:51:00]  I'm telling you.  Believe me.  Of course you haven't read them.  You're not following me.  How would you read them?  But I would still read my own at mentions.  I just didn't see them.  I read my own at mentions.  So as far as I'm concerned.  I've retweeted 50% of your zingers.  The fuck do you want?  When do you think you'll be back with the following some comics?  I don't know.  Ever?  Yeah.  I mean come on man.  I'm not.  I'm not.  You won't take time.  Well it's just you know.  I mean I know everybody thinks I'm probably being a bitch about it. 
[01:51:30]  But it's like what am I going to.  I didn't make it a big issue.  I didn't go out and motherfuck people.  I didn't blame other people.  But it really is.  A fucking.  It really is like Jesus Christ.  Like certain people didn't even get back to me.  I'm like is that what is that where I am on the fucking scale.  Like when certain people won't even respond.  And I don't mean you.  Because you and I at least talked about it first.  Other guys that I'm not named.  Like I guess I wasn't that close to that guy.  But like fuck am I that.  Like I don't.  I don't merit just.  Hey man this is why I can or I won't do it. 
[01:52:00]  And you know who was fucking helpful with this.  Joe DeRosa.  No DeRosa.  You know DeRosa just puts it all into perspective.  I'm like you know I could always just direct.  Smoke in my apartment.  Fucking zilch.  It was the one saving grace.  I didn't have to follow Bob anymore.  Oh shit.  But yeah.  I mean there was.  You know whatever man.  It just.  That was what it.  What it was.  But there was a lot of people that had nothing to do with it.  That I just didn't want to see comics. 
[01:52:30]  Because I just.  And behind the scenes.  And I'm not going to mention any names.  People were trying to get on the show.  And I'm not.  I'm not mad at them.  But I'm just like why would I go out of my way.  And again.  It just doesn't mean guys like fucking you.  And Voss and Bobby.  Who have carte blanche.  You can do it.  I'm not talking about that.  Or guys like Bill.  It's just guys that aren't a member of the fucking.  The quote unquote core crew.  Like why would I go to bat for any of these guys.  They would never do a fucking thing for me.  Why would I.  Not that I would hurt them.  Or not that I would motherfuck them.  Or bad mouth them.  But why would I.  Like how many. 
[01:53:00]  And again.  So many times.  That people don't see in the show meetings.  Like when this guy's on.  Or when they're pitching someone.  And you guys might not know him.  I'm like what no.  He's funny.  Or he's this.  Or he's that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a lot of times it's a no.  But even when it's a yes.  Or they come on.  And they're not doing that great.  Instead of just sitting there.  And fucking watching him stew.  Which is what I should do.  Not fucking step on him.  Not sabotage him.  But let him fucking stew.  But I don't.  Fucking.  A dumb cunt I am.  Because I've been on enough radio shows.  I'm like. 
[01:53:30]  Elbow.  Elbow.  You bail him out.  It just annoys me about myself.  It's like a codependent little fucking faggot quality.  That annoys me about myself.  You just don't want to see somebody getting fucked.  Nah.  But it's just annoying too.  It's like what the fuck.  Yeah.  Shut my mouth.  Call.  Comment.  Yeah.  All I have to say is.  What is Ron and Fez's number?  Oh.  Shit.  It's the same as this one.  Stupid.  Listen to this show once.  You'd know that.  All right.  Oh wow.  I think we got a lot accomplished here. 
[01:54:00]  We had a lot of butt chests anyway.  Yeah.  I think we might have.  I still follow you, Carl.  Thanks, Carl.  The side boob tweet was very funny.  Call me a side boob.  Oh, jeez.  If I didn't know what was going on, I never would have tweeted that one.  Oh, it was hilarious.  Yeah.  But I didn't know who I was dealing with.  The guy sitting here plotting my fucking death.  Holy shit.  I wasn't plotting it.  I was just kind of wishing for it.  I was hoping to be some sort of an accident.  Hmm. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  All right, guys.  Have a good morning, I guess.  All right, Carl.  You certainly made it fun.  It was very nice seeing you last night.  It sure was.  You were very funny.  You're a good hugger.  Oh, what a party.  That was a grown-up big boy party right there.  I wanted to kill myself at the end of it.  We're really finished.  All right, buddy.  All right, dear Carl.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Carl.  All right, Carl.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, Colin.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Colin Quinn. 
[01:55:00]  Wow.  He's very upset, it seems, with the unfollowing.  I don't know.  I don't think that's a motherfucker.  I'm telling you, honestly.  I'm not good in...  I can be passive-aggressive, but if I'm going to motherfuck people, it bleeds out.  Yeah.  People do take that personally.  I believe you, though.  Oh, it's 100% true.  But people certainly take that personally.  I've seen people that aren't following me that I follow, and I'm like, what the fuck is  that about?  You do think that.  You're like, what the fuck is that about?  Especially people in your social circles, you know?  I literally would have...  I only realized last night on the way home from his terrific party that I don't follow 
[01:55:30]  Tom Papa.  So I immediately...  You follow him.  I immediately followed him on the way home, because I'm like, what the fuck?  Why am I not following him?  Yeah.  So there are times where it just kind of slips through the cracks.  But that's why, because I didn't want it to be like that if it was not...  I just couldn't unfollow Big Mama Prods.  I mean, that's stupid, but I just couldn't do it.  Fishman.  And I want to explain to you guys.  Shut up.  What?  Fishman.  It's fucking Twitter.  Seriously.  Don't make it sound like you're above it.  Just stop. 
[01:56:00]  You tweet, and you'll look at the same shit everyone else does, and go like, oh, fuck,  why isn't that guy following me?  So stop.  You're not above it.  Just because it's...  No one's above this shit.  No, exactly.  That's what I mean.  Some people like to think they are.  If you're on it at all, you're not above it.  Of course.  So shut up.  Yeah.  That's obvious.  Yeah.  Yeah, Carl was a...  All right, whatever.  He said he was annoyed that I didn't follow.  I don't even think he's that annoyed, but...  And I told the truth as to why.  Like, what am I going to do?  Yeah.  Well, Colin takes things very to heart.  But how would you feel if you had... 
[01:56:30]  And believe me, if it was just one person, I would go, all right, whatever.  They're busy or fucking...  Yeah.  But when fucking...  When X amount of people, when you have that response...  Again, it is not a conspiracy.  And I'm not being philosophical.  This is really the fucking conclusion I came to.  Well, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself about it.  I'm not even being hard on myself.  Yeah, you kind of are.  You're kind of saying, like, obviously, it's something in you that made these people not  kind of get back to you.  But that's the truth.  No, it's not really.  Of course it is.  It could just be their own fucking either laziness or self-centeredness, or it doesn't always 
[01:57:00]  have to be.  Eh, maybe, but it's like this.  When guys don't come on this show, you know that they do other...  It's like, if, again, a guy of a certain status, and I don't blame them for doing that show,  was doing a show, they would absolutely do it.  So that does have something to do with it.  And they just didn't want to...  You know, whatever.  There's no...  What am I going to say?  It is what it is.  I don't think it's so much you. 
[01:57:30]  I don't take it like they hate me.  I know they respect me.  I know they like me.  I'm not fucking Mr. Nobody Loves Me.  Like, I know they do.  I know they...  I don't think that I'm a fucking piece of garbage, but I'm just like, that's where  I'm at, and that's where it is, so fuck them.  You know, I mean, I'm not articulating that well.  But what, you know...  No, you're putting it all.  I get what you mean.  It was like, not following comics on Twitter, it's like, I'm just sick of being involved with  them.  Like, you know what I mean?  In any way, even knowing what they're doing.  I don't want to, like, just tweet my own shit and fucking worry about what I'm doing 
[01:58:00]  and not fucking, like, you know, cocksucker that I am, you know, when I'm tweeting about  a special and certain friends retweet you and other friends don't, you're like, ugh.  As many times I've helped these motherfuckers promote, as many times I've helped these guys  promote their fucking shit, and you ask for a retweet on a special and you can't get  it, fuck you.  I'm going to retweet everything you tweet.  Holy fuck, right?  Just to make sure I cover all bases.  Right when he said that, all I'm thinking is, oh my god, what didn't I retweet?  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
[01:58:30]  But I was busy that day.  I wasn't on Twitter that day.  I'm retweeting every...  I was drunk.  Jim Norton tweet.  But you know what I'm saying.  Like, when I asked for a retweet.  Like, when I asked for it, like, please retweet.  There were certain people I did that I was extremely shocked at.  Right.  I was like, wow, fuck, man.  Is it going to be awkward to see Colin Quinn now?  Not at all.  We've had these weird...  This is not...  But this is the first time it was brought up, I guess.  This wasn't even uncomfortable.  I mean, we've had a couple of, like, argument arguments that were fucking...  But this wasn't some...  Yeah.  I know what he's saying, but he's wrong if he thinks there's some deep down, like, fucking 
[01:59:00]  fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  If it was just him, there might be.  But once I got that feeling from one, two, three, I'm like, holy fuck.  Then it became just about my fuck.  Oh, yeah, all right.  I wished his manager would have got...  But then again, this other guy didn't...  You know, they're not all handled by the same person.  All right.  I gotta go potty.  Yeah, so do I.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my goodness.  Good boy phone and your naughty boy phone. 
[01:59:30]  You're naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  The good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  Your good boy phone is when you're home with the old crow.  And your naughty boy phone is when nobody's home and that little fucking whore from Canada blows up your phone. 
[02:00:00]  It's your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  It's your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Naughty boy phone, naughty boy phone, and you're good for a phone.  I like the naughty boy phone. 
[02:00:30]  All right, your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle, a back scratcher, and 10 blades.  Seriously, have you noticed the price you pay for the new razor blade?  It's how much.  It's how much.  Is that in pesos?  What?  You go like this.  Do you know how much you pay for razor blades?  Yeah, okay.  It's how much?  Is that in pesos?  But who am I talking to?  The audience. 
[02:01:00]  But I don't hear them.  You can talk to me.  Seriously, have you noticed the price you pay for the new razor blades?  Yeah, it's a lot.  It's how much?  Like $20.  Is that in pesos?  No, I said dollars.  Why can't we just talk about how cool this fucking company is?  I don't know.  Why does it have to be like a script and a little play acting?  You've used it before.  I have used Dollar Shave Club.  This is what this is, right?  Dollar Shave Club.com?  I don't need a fucking script. 
[02:01:30]  No.  They said, hey man, you want to try out Dollar Shave Club?  I said, sure.  And I did try it out.  And it is really, really good.  The razor they give you is solid.  It's heavy.  It feels good in your hand.  It doesn't feel like a cheap razor.  You know what the cheap razors are.  They're really light and flimsy.  This thing has weight to it.  And then they mail you fucking blades in the mail.  How easy could this be?  And it doesn't have all the bullshit that you don't need.  Just the core essentials.  Exactly.  It gives me a good shave when I'm shaving. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  Although I am still shaving.  I've got to shave my neck and crap.  Yeah.  It'll take care of that neck beard in a hurry.  And I've got to shave these beautiful cheekbones of mine, too.  They are really nice.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  When they're shaved down.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  They pop.  And then awkwardly, I've got to shave the tip of my nose because some shit is growing  there.  I don't know why.  They'll take care of you.  Literally.  All parts.  Anyone else have that shit growing in the tip of their nose like it's like beard hair almost?  No.  So what the fuck did I do?  I shaved once a long time ago and now it comes back like coarser? 
[02:02:30]  It would be worse if you were a chick.  That would be terrible.  I know.  And then I've got to shave between my eyebrows sometimes.  So I'm still doing a lot of shaving.  And of course, you know what?  I don't know if they want to promote dollarshaveclub.com in this way, but I have shaved my balls with  the razors.  That's got to be a nice razor, then.  It's a very nice razor.  To trust that.  No rashy shit going on.  You don't want that, yeah.  You know, when you go over the area over and over again, then it's a fucking...  Looks like you've got the chicken pox down there. 
[02:03:00]  What is that about?  Man, if you shave down there, you've got to go over the area once, maybe twice.  Yeah.  After that, you do some damage after you're done.  It's Dollar Shave Club.  I don't know.  Blah, blah, blah.  I think I got all the basics out, right?  And then they go back to this.  No more zombying your face with old blades because you can't afford or forget to buy  new ones.

[02:05:00]  My name is Danny, how can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, uh, you know, like,  through, you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing, but I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router 
[02:05:30]  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here.  Yeah, exactly, right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean, like a Cat5?  You're talking about a... 
[02:06:00]  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them...  I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just...  Let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy? 
[02:06:30]  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that...  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine!  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000.  I'm not helping you.  I think somebody sent up a fan page.  I'm hanging up!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests. 
[02:07:00]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve. 
[02:07:30]  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  I hope we were off.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we were.  Bow down before.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  I'm just trying to swallow eggs.  How's that working out for you? 
[02:08:00]  Not good.  Ha, ha.  I was fucking enjoying the hell out of the bathroom.  Fucking sitting there, little Huey Lewis playing.  You're fucking trolling through your phone.  You can just sit there all day.  God.  Yeah.  Dun.  Dun, dun.  Just like, oh, let me check this.  What song was it?  I think it was If This Is It.  If This Is It.  I kind of like that one.  Please let me know.  Yeah, you know.  It's just like being at home. 
[02:08:30]  Fucking 80s music playing.  I'm on the shitter.  That was it.  Big 80s.  Montage.  And then some Adam Ant came on.  After that.  Yeah.  What do you have?  Two hits?  Adam Ant?  Yeah.  Goody two, goody two, goody, goody two shoes.  And then the other one.  I don't remember the other one.  I don't either.  You know how nice it is to Wade Fulp.  What?  I hope you get prostate cancer.  Oh, wow. 
[02:09:00]  What happened?  He writes, one of your few likable qualities is your loyalty to your friends.  You lost that quality today.  Ugh.  Who would write that?  I don't know.  But I'll never read anything he writes again.  Because he's a blocked cunt.  You and your dumb goatee.  Jizz drinker.  Well, Colin's having, he's keeping up his good nature.  Because he just tweeted.  Oh, did he?  He had to listen to the last 45 minutes.  Colin Quinn writes,  At Jim Norton.  At Opie Radio. 
[02:09:30]  At Anthony Cumia.  Thank you.  Get some cheap plugs in there for everybody.  Yes.  The real tragedy of this story,  At Rich Voss became collateral damage.  He would have said yes to a show for $200.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Carl.  Carl, no.  Now look at the wind, of course.  What happened?  Little Jimmy.  They're going,  Comic Diva.  Jeez.  How does anybody not get that?  Like, I don't, 
[02:10:00]  People on Twitter,  If they get it, they get it.  But,  What am I going to do?  I'm not going to change one fucking,  You were honest.  Yeah, I don't think I was wrong either.  Yeah, you were honest about your feelings.  It's like, if I blame everybody,  Then I'm wrong.  If I really don't blame people,  Then I'm a dick.  Like, what the fuck do people want?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, yeah,  There's some confusion there.  People.  You're not holding a grudge against me,  Or anything I've done,  Are you?  No, not at all.  Not even a little.  Because now I'm a little worried.  No. 
[02:10:30]  Um.  You'll tell me, right?  Yeah, you'd know it.  I mean, fucking,  And Kyle would have known it too,  Honestly, it's like,  I'm just fucking,  I know, I know,  But I'm saying,  Like, he would know.  I'm not a good enough,  He's perceptive enough,  If we're in person,  To have sensed something,  And I didn't feel anything shitty with him.  That's pretty funny.  Trim Reaper,  Just puts my name in,  And puts,  My stomach hurts.  Because I used to,  Yell that I had a tummy ache,  When mommy and daddy were arguing.  I'd try to get them to stop fighting,  By feigning illness, 
[02:11:00]  With my tummy hurting,  In my tears.  I love passive-aggressive,  Self-loathing Jimmy.  But I'm not being passive-aggressive.  That's what Colin,  Apparently thought,  You were being passive-aggressive.  No.  No.  Because I didn't just unfollow,  If I just unfollowed Colin,  That's passive-aggressive.  Mm.  But unfollowing everybody,  Doesn't put it on anybody.  Nobody,  Yeah,  And I just,  Like I said,  If it wasn't for Patrice,  I would have went down to zero,  Just for that reason.  I didn't want to have the discussion.  Right. 
[02:11:30]  Hopkins Bass says it all with his tweet.  He writes,  It was nice of Colin and Jimmy  To participate in Eagle's Day  By airing their dirty laundry.  Oh,  Dirty laundry.  Yeah.  Naughty,  Naughty.  Oh,  That was John Parr.  Naughty,  Naughty.  Oh,  I'm fine having those conversations publicly.  There was nothing secret about it.  It wasn't,  You know.  Makes for great radio.  It gets it all out there in the open.  Ugliness makes for great radio.  Uncomfortable lover's quarrel.  I literally don't, 
[02:12:00]  Didn't even feel uncomfortable about that.  God,  Then you wouldn't live in a weird world.  That's uncomfortable.  Nah.  Because I've had,  That wasn't,  On an argument scale,  Again,  And like you said,  Maybe a four.  Not even a four.  Wow.  Because I don't feel angry.  I was more angry,  Thinking about other people.  You should be angry that Ozzy doesn't follow you.  He does follow me.  I see on their thing,  He doesn't follow you.  Yes,  He does.  Go to Jim Norton's Twitter.  Uh oh.  Oh boy.  If he doesn't follow you.  Ozzy follows me. 
[02:12:30]  You sure?  Yep.  So if you go,  Wait a minute.  So,  That's who I'm following.  I mean,  Jim would have to be longer.  Oh,  That's why.  I thought I had something.  Because we're looking at everyone Jimmy's following,  And they're all following you back,  Except for Ozzy.  But it's Sam's Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah,  Because I'm following him.  Oh,  Never mind.  I thought I had something.  Because we're looking right there,  It says Ozzy not following,  But that's not following Sam.  Never mind. 
[02:13:00]  We played Nine Inch Nails,  Because the boys are getting back together after four years.  Really?  Yeah,  They're going to do a little something something.  That's weird,  Because Trent is very into the movie soundtrack shit now.  A lot of money to be made there, too, right?  Yeah,  He's very respected.  That's going to go boingo.  I think he's an Oscar winner,  Isn't he?  As far as,  Social network.  Yeah.  So,  Maybe that world is drying up for him a little bit.  I don't know.  Or maybe it was just time to bring back Nin. 
[02:13:30]  Nin.  Here's Nin on the only station that really rocks.  Nin.  Oh, boy.  Nin.  We probably said that.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Our old boss is trying to buy the Boston Globe, by the way.  Brucie?  I want to reach out to him and go,  Why?  What the fuck are you thinking?  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  Our old GM is trying to buy the Boston Globe with Ernie Bach.  In this digital age, he wants to buy a newspaper? 
[02:14:00]  Well, Ernie Bach was quoted,  Because they're all saying that to Ernie.  Of course.  Big investor.  Newspapers are dead.  Big money guy up there in Boston.  And he's basically saying,  It's not dead.  Could you find his exact quote?  Because it was like,  Oh, boy.  Every day,  People that read newspapers are, like,  Leaving the planet.  Why the fuck would...  I don't know.  I don't know why you would try to get...  Yeah.  Revive that business.  But Ernie Bach.  Ernie Bach.  And Bruce Mittman's trying to help him out a little bit. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, Brucie.  They're attempting to buy the Boston Globe.  Brucie's too old to fucking take his fortune.  I'm starting to think,  Brucie might be, you know,  Early stages.  Oh, what?  Maybe a little delirium?  Of the owl disease.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going to buy a newspaper.  Because Bruce, you know,  He's a smart guy.  He's a smart businessman.  Yeah.  He can't convey to the guy  That all he wanted to do  Is buy that day's newspaper.  Right.  I want to buy a newspaper. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  Oh, okay.  No, wait a minute.  You're taking advantage of him.  If you've got the Ernie Bach quote, please.  I don't know.  That, um...  You would know.  He's basically trying to say  That the paper business is not dead.  He says, uh...  I grew up not only reading the Boston Globe,  But doing business with the Boston Globe.  Exactly.  I feel it has lost its way  Over the last few years.  But I feel I have the right recipe  To put it back on track.  What is that?  If he has the right recipe  To get these newspapers selling again, 
[02:15:30]  He will be a multi-billionaire.  What, is he going to snip people's computer cords?  Right.  He's going to fuck up the internet?  Oh, that chick that was  Mouthing off to the judge  Looks a lot better these days.  Really?  They fixed her up.  Yeah, they...  They gave her black hair,  A little softer girl look  Makeup and everything.  And the judge is a clapping phone?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that the judge?  She learned her lesson.  Same judge?  Uh, I'm not sure.  It looked like it.  What a load of shit, though.  She didn't learn a lesson.  She learned, probably through a lawyer, 
[02:16:00]  What to do in front of a fucking judge.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  You're that young, and you...  I tell you, that one night I spent in jail  Yeah.  For fucking the voyeur bus.  Fun, right?  Did that teach you?  Fun?  It's so bad, I never want to go back.  I never want to go back.  Who keeps fucking up after a jail?  I don't know.  Like, and going back.  Repeat offender?  Like, how dumb are you?  Yeah, that is pretty stupid.  I want to talk about that.  I'm going to write a note,  Because I want to go back to that.  But we got Nick DiPaolo on the hotline.  Oh!  Our old pal, Nick.  I got right through.  Holy moly.  Hi, Nick. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that'll happen.  Well, you just missed an uncomfortable 45 minutes  between Colin Quinn and Jim Norton.  What?  Why?  What happened?  Just a mild argument.  But I didn't think it was...  I really didn't.  Like, we've all had arguments.  I didn't think it was that uncomfortable.  Jimmy...  Are you talking about diet plans?  Well, Jimmy unfollowed everybody,  because he was...  Well, that's...  It's a long story.  Yeah, I can't just summarize this.  He's just had it.  So he unfollowed a lot of people.  Everybody's...  All comedians.  All comedians.  And Colin...  Noticed that he was one.  Called up this morning and called him out on it. 
[02:17:00]  And it got very uncomfortable.  The Twitter unfollow is a thing now.  Yes.  It's a snub.  That's like a breakup.  That's a breakup.  Yeah, it's a breakup.  It's a snub.  It's, you know...  Yeah.  It's taken on a life of its own.  It's fucking Twitter.  It really is.  I just...  You know...  When I start seeing, like, you know,  Henry Kissinger tweeting and shit,  I go, there must be something to this.  And then you realize there's not.  It's just babble.  Exactly.  140 characters of nothingness.  When I see Florentine has 80,000 followers, 
[02:17:30]  I say, what the fuck?  Anybody can do this.  It was good seeing you at the big Tom Papa party last night, Nick.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  Yeah, it was great, man.  I drove home with, like, seven glasses of wine.  I mean, that was...  Yeah.  But I know where all the cops are now, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm driving home from the comedy cellar all the time.  I know exactly where they are in, like,  Tarrytown and fucking...  You know?  Yeah, me and Nick were talking about that last night,  about, you know, how you just really got to mature. 
[02:18:00]  And by that, I don't mean not drinking and driving anymore,  but realize how you have to drink and drive.  You can't go passing people and speeding up  and making any moves.  You got to drive normal.  You got to keep it in your head,  even though your senses are a little dulled by alcohol.  You have to remember that, you know,  you're doing something illegal.  Yeah.  I was at...  It's funny.  This happened to be the gig I'm plugging  while I call you guys,  but a couple years ago,  I'm at Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant down there. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Not to fucking brag.  But I'm on stage,  and there's a couple,  a young couple in the front,  and they're doing shots.  And I go,  what are you fucking...  What is that?  And they go,  it's coffee-flavored Patron.  And I'm like,  I love coffee.  I love tequila.  The guy keeps handing me shots.  Oh, shit.  And about an hour a set,  I did like seven,  I think six or seven shots.  Wow.  Coffee-flavored my ass.  You're doing shots of tequila.  You know?  It just boils down to that.  It just makes it go down easier. 
[02:19:00]  I know.  It was delicious.  And I get off fucking stage,  and I did just what you said, Anthony.  Yeah.  I get up around,  you know,  because I live way the fuck up here on the sticks.  I get up around Rutherford,  you know,  giant stadium there.  They're part of the term.  And I'm doing like 95.  See?  What am I getting home to?  My fucking wife?  Well, I'm not going to fuck.  And I'm flying.  And then, sure enough,  I get pulled over by a car.  Oh, shit.  And I'm like,  here we go, man. 
[02:19:30]  I'm going straight to fucking jail.  Luckily,  I pulled over  on the side of the road  where he couldn't stand on my side.  Uh-huh.  There was no room for him  to stand on my side.  Oh.  So he had to stand on the,  you know,  I put down the passenger side window.  Yeah.  And otherwise,  he would have smelt me.  Smelt coffee on your breath.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A young black cop,  he had a big char at the back.  I felt like I was down in Alabama.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know,  he fucking,  and somehow, dude,  I just got,  if he was on my side, 
[02:20:00]  look at, you know,  in my window,  he would have smelt,  maybe he'd have smelt coffee.  I don't know.  But Jesus Christ,  did I hit my knees  when I got home?  Yeah, sometimes.  I was going straight to jail.  It was fucking,  wait,  but you're missing a step.  How'd you get out of it?  Because you're still going 95.  Did you get the speeding ticket?  I wasn't doing 95,  but, you know,  it was 80-something.  Right.  I got the ticket.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So you got the ticket.  So you were relieved  you just got the ticket.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I got you.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's fine.  Sure.  Jesus Christ,  I was like,  oh, my God. 
[02:20:30]  You know what you should have said  as you drove off?  Hey, man,  thanks for letting me  off the hook on the DUI.  Yeah,  lean on the horn,  give him the fingers.  Yeah.  You know you're really  fucking up when you're happy  to get the speeding ticket.  No, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Then I go down there again,  right?  Yeah.  And I drink again  only just a couple drinks  and then I had a slice of pizza  and some shit.  I pull out of there.  I go a couple miles.  Again,  this is Uncle Vinny's. 
[02:21:00]  You can see where my career is.  I've told two stories.  They're both revolved on the cake.  I'm doing it again this weekend.  But I pull out of there  and go a couple miles  and there's a fucking  one of those DUI roadblocks.  Oh, fuck.  They force us off  right into a bank parking lot.  Oh, shit.  And I hate that.  You know,  the cops just go,  so where are you coming from?  Well,  what the fuck?  It's none of your business.  Yeah.  Yeah, that works.  You should have parked the car  real quick in one of the bank spots  and just claimed  they can't give you a DUI  because you're parked.  Yeah,  you're going to do some banking 
[02:21:30]  at fucking two in the morning.  Yeah,  you should have just  fucking pulled off  and parked in the bank.  Yeah,  I'm opening a CD.  But Jesus Christ,  you're going to be,  you know,  like fucking Nazis down there.  Yeah,  it's,  you just really,  it's hard to,  to think rationally  when you've been  putting a few down.  Because if you were smart,  you would drive  as best as you possibly can.  But for some reason,  you speed and change the lanes  without the blinker,  you fucking, 
[02:22:00]  you know.  Yeah,  and then come over  in the comedy show  a couple summers ago.  Again,  I got about seven drinks  and haven't eaten a thing.  And I was telling you,  Anthony,  last time,  and I'm in the left lane,  literally,  doing like 75.  Jesus.  In front of me,  I get right up on his ass  like a jerk  and I flash my lights  just in time  to see the two blue lights  in the back window  and they're on my car.  Oh,  oh.  And he goes,  it's on the PA system  and he goes,  this is where you're  going to love New York cops.  He goes,  that tried asshole, 
[02:22:30]  pull over.  Oh,  I pull over  and I,  somehow I got out  of a ticket.  That was enough  when I thought  I was going to jail.  Wow.  What did you say  when he walked up?  What do you call it?  The,  yeah,  the head of his dick.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Breathalyzer?  Yeah,  yeah,  no.  Am I actually doing bits  on Owen?  Yeah.  What the fuck  is going on?  It's so funny,  I'm sitting here  watching Imus,  you know,  on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah,  and they're all  doing their nice,  clean,  proper radio. 
[02:23:00]  And then you guys  will be on hold  like you and Jimmy  going,  yeah,  that's fucking  piece of shit,  fuck,  shit,  fuck.  Yeah,  it's kind of a  different head.  Just before he called,  Jimmy was talking about  spending one night  in jail  and that made him  realize he never  wants to go back.  Was that because  of the bus thing?  Yeah,  that goes back,  God,  I don't know.  Ten years more?  At least ten years  at this point.  Is it already ten years?  At least.  Yeah, 
[02:23:30]  that was because  we were fired  ten years ago.  Wow.  Probably eleven.  Having a little  good clean fun?  What's the matter?  These kids.  Yeah,  right?  No kidding.  That was a big day.  I only spent a few hours  in jail in high school  after we trashed  some cop's lawn  that we didn't like.  Jesus.  And they came to the party  and made us get in our cars  and drove,  made us like,  there was a cop car  behind us  and a cop car  in front of us,  you know,  like fucking five.  It made us drive our cars 
[02:24:00]  to police station.  It was like real  small town shit.  That is.  And then they have us  in the cell  and they say,  call you,  we want you to call  your parents or something.  So I get on the phone  all cocky,  you know,  and I just dial any number  and some old lady answers.  And I'm like,  then I just hang up the phone  and I go,  there was nobody home.  They go,  we're listening,  asshole. 
[02:24:30]  So where,  okay,  where are you going to be  this weekend?  I'm going to be  Uncle Vinny's.  Uncle Vinny's.  Friday night,  10.30 show  Saturday night.  Point Pleasant.  8.30.  Point Pleasant.  New Jersey,  right.  I've seen Nick.  He's great.  And that comedy club  survived, huh?  Because, I mean,  Point Pleasant got  fucking wrecked.  I know,  exactly.  I haven't been there  in a couple years,  but they actually  turned it into  a decent room,  you know?  I mean,  it's literally  like a restaurant 
[02:25:00]  before you.  It's not a good sign  career-wise.  You keep burning  your arm  in a pizza oven  on the way  out of the gig.  But, yeah,  so Friday and  Saturday and  Thursday,  I'm hosting  Gotham Live,  that show on.  Oh, yeah.  That's Access.  That's Mark Cuban's  gig.  I'm doing that in April.  Yeah, it goes out live.  Yeah, very cool.  So, you know,  but I'm in between.  I'm starting a new hour,  so I'm just starting new,  but I don't want to burn  that shit on this show, 
[02:25:30]  so I'm just going to  show up and kind of  wing it.  Oh, yeah,  you host the show,  you bring on comics.  The money is pretty good  to host it.  Yeah, it is.  That's why I'm doing it,  you know?  I've got to get back  on the saddle here.  Yeah, apparently.  Love to hear that story.  Yeah, well,  one of these days.  Someday we'll hear  that story.  No, you will.  Someday we'll ask  the questions.  Yeah, all the right  questions. 
[02:26:00]  All the right questions,  sure.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, you guys know.  But we respect Nick,  and when he's ready to talk,  yeah, we're here whenever.  I get nervous around you guys.  You've been on radio  so long,  you can see right  through all this shit.  Oh, please.  I can't wait to hear.  I guarantee we're going  to be relating  to a bunch of stuff.  Oh, that.  Yeah.  Oh, that.  Oh, they pulled that.  Yeah, I remember that move.  No, it's nothing exactly.  It's nothing you guys haven't,  but it's a little  more complicated, so.  Don't doubt it.  Yeah, but sex with a five-year-old,  I mean, 
[02:26:30]  just blow up his spot.  That would be,  holy shit.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  Hello, fellas.  Thank you for letting me, uh...  Oh, run on, Nick.  Nick DiPaolo  at Uncle Vinny's Point Pleasant  starting this weekend.  You got the Thursday tour  or is it Friday, Saturday?  What days?  No, it's just Friday  and Saturday.  Okay.  All right, so people,  yeah, make sure you see Nick, man.  See you, man.  Absolutely.  Take care, Nick.  Come on out.  I hear the club is still wet  and there's seaweed on stage.  Nice.  It'll be all right.  Great comic. 
[02:27:00]  Take it easy, Nick.  See you guys.  All right, Nick DiPaolo, everyone.  Yeah, he's, uh...  I like Nick.  I've seen him a few times  when he's come out to Long Island.  Oh, he's great.  And, uh, yeah,  he's a really funny man.  Really, really...  He's fun to just hang out with, too.  Like, he's one of those  fun guys to talk to.  I guess he likes to...  I guess he likes to drink and drive, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Trading a couple of stories  about that last night.  Wow.  I know.  Someday they're gonna pull this audio  after Nick is fucking, you know,  he's fucking thrown in jail  with a fucking...  An eight-year-old's belt...  Belt loop in his fucking car bumper. 
[02:27:30]  Little patent leather shoe.  Yeah, just a shoe  and a school book.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You gotta watch that shit.  DWI is a fucking mother...  If you hit somebody, you'd...  It's not like the old days.  No.  So back to you, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  What was it about jail?  This is a pretty obvious question,  but, I mean, your experience...  It's scary  because of the physical violence threat, but...  Did you feel like  at any moment you could be in...  You could have,  but we knew we weren't  in that violent an area.  Like, we knew we were in holdings  for people that were just 
[02:28:00]  going to see a judge.  So I kind of figured  I would have to fuck up  to get my ass kicked  because people just want to go  to see the judge.  No one wants to have a fight  right before they see the judge  and you go right back through it.  Giuliani was pissed.  He was fucking pissed.  Yeah.  Because they...  How long were you in there?  27 hours.  Yeah, it should have been  a couple hours.  Four or five tops.  Thank God it was not...  Thank God it wasn't a Friday.  But that was him going,  look, man, make it hurt a little bit.  Thank God it wasn't a Friday.  Yeah.  We've been the whole weekend.  He was basically saying,  look, obviously we don't have  much on these guys, 
[02:28:30]  but make it hurt  before you let them out.  27 hours.  That's ridiculous.  It was just dirty, right?  It was dirty  and I had to shit desperately.  But I wouldn't shit in the toilet.  I would have eventually shit  if I had to.  Yeah, yeah.  I would have had to shit.  You had your bologna sandwich?  Yeah.  You brought bologna.  I didn't shit for 27 hours  and I was the dude  doing Danger Feels that night.  So I finally get there  and then my balls stunk  because I had the  I have to shit sweats.  And I got there 
[02:29:00]  and I fucking stiff-legged  right down into the bathroom  and they had that awful single  that fucking  With the pull chain  with the toilet  No, that  The gun behind it  That square toilet paper  that high school toilet paper  Oh, right.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah.  I took  a fucking horrible  bologna sandwich  Jail dump.  Nice.  And then we're on stage, yeah.  Must have been such a relief though, huh?  Yeah.  Dump that out.  Excuse me.  Nice.  To not have to go to jail for a while.  But you're a true professional.  You went right to the gig. 
[02:29:30]  Right to the gig from jail.  I remember telling you  Look, Jimmy  No one's going to be pissed.  Go home.  I remember that.  He got out  and he goes  I got to go right to Dangerfields.  I got a spot.  Man.  Crazy.  I had to.  Yes, it is crazy.  Fuck.  I don't know  Are we going to get to  the Jacktober today?  I hope so.  I don't know.  Why don't we?  What time is it?  I'd love to hear some  a Jacktober here in fucking  February.  What about the footage  of the furry convention? 
[02:30:00]  We love furry talk.  That's only good.  That's going to be  Oh, furry.  I think it's furry.  Oh.  F-U-R-R-Y  Furry.  The furry thing  will be a quick one.  That's fine.  This is the people  that dress up as  stuffed animals  and have sex and stuff?  Yeah.  They did a furry convention  in Texas.  But they took themselves  very seriously  because we were trying  to get Sam  to go undercover  and they wouldn't have it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's bullshit.  It couldn't happen,  but what a bunch  of weirdos. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, but they take it  very seriously, man.  I don't understand  this one at all.  No.  Some lady complained  because she brought  her kids to a hotel  and this furry convention  was happening  while she was there  with their kids.  Kids don't understand  that they're perverts.  They probably think  it's fun.  Look at the big animals.  Why do they have  the holes cut  in the back  of their costumes?  Mommy, why is  the bunny's hiney showing?  I see his coolie.  Yeah, why is the bunny's  carrot sticking out, mommy?  Their hineys  and their genitals  are uncovered 
[02:31:00]  for all to see.  What's the big thing  about this furry thing?  What is it?  They're douchebags.  This one's extremely weird.  Yeah, it's not as bad  as a cannibal.  After the cannibal cop,  it's like, oh,  just a nice furry thing.  He said, I want to cut  their wife's throat  and jerk off to it.  Yeah.  But why would you get  turned on by dressing  up like this?  I don't know.  Does this go back  to something that happened  when you were really young?  Yeah, I think it's  a childhood thing.  It probably has something  to do with stuffed animals  in your bed  or something like that.  Oh, boy, I bet.  Not just stuffed animals  in your bed.  Stuffed animals  in your bed  and an uncle 
[02:31:30]  like rubbing your teddy bear  on your dick  or something.  So what's this?  This is just like  I just found this video  that people at  a furry convention did  and I thought you guys  would want to see  how the shit goes down.  Yeah, let's see this.  So it's in the lobby  of a hotel?  It's all over the place, yeah.  Convention of Unacceptable  Adults, Scars One Hotel,  Guests,  Cheerleading Children for Life.  Oh, one of those  cheerleading conventions  was in the same hotel  as the furry convention?  Yeah, I guess. 
[02:32:00]  And then she wrote  this letter,  but more importantly  I just wanted  to show you the video.  Okay.  It's working!  Hey, Kiana.  What?  Dad.  Alright, that's just  scary.  I just love that nice.  This is gonna be so okay.  We get heavy breathing  in my ear.  Furry Fiesta 2012.  Furry Fiesta.  What's the bunch of dickheads?  What's wrong with these  fucking weirdos?  They're just dancing  in costumes. 
[02:32:30]  Weirdos, yeah.  Fucking stinky costumes.  Oh, I bet they reek.  They're probably all ugly  and that's why  they want to be in costumes.  Ooh, I wish I looked  like a giant possum.  How do you, an idiot?  Ugh.  How great would a fucking  good fire be right there?  Like a great white fire  at the door.  All their costumes  are so flammable.  Are they just melting on them?  Oh, yeah.  Horribly.  I got that one  dressed like an ape.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:00]  Can someone call up  and explain this shit  to us, please?  I know we have  a few furries out there.  What's the attraction  to this whole thing?  Is it like living online?  Maybe.  Uh, yeah.  No, this is at least  more personal, though.  At least you're interacting  and getting in the car.  But you don't really like  what you look like,  so this is a way  to get around that?  I don't know.  This is some fetish, definitely.  It's more than costumes  because they gotta be furry. 
[02:33:30]  Like, they gotta be like animals  or fluffy.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  Yeah, certainly.  It's like stuffed animals.  It has to be  that type of genre  of dressing up.  I know we have some people  that listen to the show  that are into that.  You gotta call the show.  I wanna know  what the attraction is.  It's so weird when it,  like, it just feels  sexuality combined with that.  A dozen fucking.  Weird.  Now it's just weird.  There was some fucking,  like, a rave.  What the hell's going on?  It's a furry rave.  And they were, like,  sweating in their dumb suits. 
[02:34:00]  But they won't take them off.  No.  How do you get your ass  eaten if you get your suit on?  Yeah.  Oh, imagine how nasty  it would be.  Oh, terrible.  Imagine.  We don't have to imagine.  The Philly Fanatic.  We always go back to that.  Oh, yeah.  We broadcast live  at YSB in Philly  and they, you know,  to go local,  they brought in  the Philly Fanatic  and his fucking suit,  costume,  whatever the fuck,  smelled horrendous.  Remember how bad  that smelled?  Terrible.  You get your ass  eaten,  you get people  spit out the little furs.  You get your dumb fucking,  whatever,  your bunny costume. 
[02:34:30]  Grownups.  We got Dustin on the line.  Dustin.  Oh, great.  So what?  He's working at home.  Dustin.  It's Justin.  How are you guys doing?  Justin, what's up?  Oh, Justin.  Oh, that's different.  Where were you last night?  When I was in college,  I had a roommate  who was a furry.  This guy was fucking  creepy as shit.  I asked him to explain it  to me one time  because I, you know,  like you guys,  I was like,  what the fuck  is this all about?  So he tells me  that he,  honest to God,  believes in his mind  that he is  an animal spirit 
[02:35:00]  trapped in a human body.  that by being a furry  and, you know,  dressing up  and, I don't know,  having fucking kinky sex  in a suit,  you know,  that he's actually  expressing his  inner animal self  that he can't  otherwise do.  Weirdos.  Fucking weirdos.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  All right.  We got a furry fan,  but we don't have  an actual furry  calling in yet. 
[02:35:30]  Nick in North Dakota.  Nick.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Welcome aboard, Nick.  We just talked to you.  Well, the furry thing  is like anonymous sex.  What?  The thing with the furry,  it's like anonymous sex  is what it is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So you...  It's like essentially  like a glory hole.  Ugh.  It doesn't look like  their suits have  much sex access 
[02:36:00]  to them, you know?  Oh, they got hit.  They look pretty elaborate.  They got hidden  trap doors and stuff.  Can you think?  You lift the tail up?  Yeah, they don't want  to make it look too obvious,  but I bet you...  Well, you know,  they have zippers  in the back and the front.  I don't know.  Some of these  look like they'd be  very uncomfortable  or inconvenient  to have sex in.  It's like fucking  through the mouth  of an alligator.  I don't think  this guy's true.  No?  Yeah.  I think it's  lying sack of shite.  All right, we're  going to try one more  and then we're  going to move on. 
[02:36:30]  Brendan in Connecticut.  Brendan.  Hey, guys.  I knew one of these  furries in college  and met a bunch  of his friends  and the vast majority  of them,  if you just talk  to them on the street,  will insist that  there's nothing  sexual about it  and that they just  see themselves  as animals.  So that other dude  was kind of on point.  But from every one  of them that I've  ever known,  I'm convinced  that it is  because they're gay  and they're  just in the closet.  So they get to  have sex with somebody  in a dog suit  and pretend they're  not gay because  it's just some 
[02:37:00]  other decent thing  that they can do.  Hearing all kinds  of different answers  here.  How about they're  just assholes?  Yeah.  Exactly.  But I mean,  the kid that I knew  would fucking,  there was a game,  an online game  that was for Tadia  that was made  to like cater  to these people  where you create  your little character  would be an animal  and shit and it was  pretty much just  the second life  type of thing  but it was back  before games  actually had graphics,  you know what I mean?  But you'd be  targeted and  just like meow  and shit. 
[02:37:30]  It was the weirdest  thing to be around  that I have ever seen.  You know,  I had a game  I created for them  too.  It's where you show  up in your furry  costume and then  as you're walking  in we have someone  fucking smash your  face with a shovel  and bash your brains  in with your fucking  dumb hat on.  I'm a wolf!  Fuck!  That's how your  family has to  fucking bury you.  Fuck your dumb  little costume.  You're a big skunk  pal.  That's very embarrassing. 
[02:38:00]  Oh it is.  You're a big dog.  Are you?  That's our dumb  looking costume.  I'm an animal  but I'm really a person.  Alright, we're getting  deeper into this world.  Paul's got more info.  Paul in Philly.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, how you doing?  I just heard some  girlies to know  you should go to those  and some of the people  wanted to be at hotels  to put out litter boxes  for them to relieve  themselves.  Litter boxes?  Why don't you bring  your own?  Bring your own  fucking litter box.  There was like a big  almost like kiddie bowl 
[02:38:30]  in the waiting area  for them to  fill up with  kitty litter.  But did people  actually use it?  I don't know.  I didn't go to the thing.  Or was it there  just for a prop?  Imagine you're trying  to find a place  where you could put  your duties in a big  pool full of  fucking litter?  Why not?  You shit in the ocean.  Well, I do, sir.  That was hurtful.  I'm a bunch of,  I'm saying.  All right.  Yeah.  That was very hurtful.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  Well, I'm sure  they have a lot of fun.  We're not going  to let this one go.  We've got to  find out more  down the road.  It's very bizarre.  It's really strange.  I know you're out there.  Fucking call our show  tomorrow or something  so we can discuss this  further.  I'm starting to think  it's not a very  sexual thing.  I'm starting to think  it's like these people  like, yeah, like go out  and party with this.  I mean, I'm sure  there's some people  that are fucking,  you know, perverts  just like everything.  If it's not sexual,  what's the difference  between this and Halloween?  Halloween, everyone loves  to fucking fantasize 
[02:39:30]  and get dressed up  and they really,  really get into it.  So this is what?  Just a reason to do it  a bunch of times a year?  They would never dance  around like this  and act like this  if they were not  in this stupid costume.  So they dress up  and a part of their  personality comes out,  the asshole part,  and they, yeah,  and they're, you know,  big man on campus  until they take  that fucking stupid head off  and they're just 
[02:40:00]  the asshole nerds  that they are.  That's what I think.  It's like when you fucking  make one of those  epic characters on,  you know.  What the fuck is calling me?  I do a radio show.  That's a fool.  It's a 212 number.  Who's this?  Oh, hi.  I'm doing a radio show  at the present moment.  Who the fuck is that?  Oh, that's Jimmy Norton  yelling at the background.  Oh, goddammit. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, it's a great time  to call me would be  at 2 p.m.  Yeah, after he sucks a dick.  Yeah.  He's gotta suck a dick.  Bye.  Who was that?  People from The Blaze.  Oh.  The woman from The Blaze  wants me to do  one of the show things  that they have to go on.  How come Stump Reigns  never asked me to do The Blaze?  I don't know.  He doesn't believe in you.  What the fuck, man?  You don't follow him.  That's right.  You just gotta follow him first.  You have to follow him  or you're gonna give you a shit. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  By the way,  I'm on a block fest.  Are ya?  Loving it.  Right now,  you're just blocking people?  Are you blocking a lot of people?  Yep.  Good boy.  I love a good block.  Some fat pig last night  gave me some shit.  Some guy.  Big, round, fat head  with a dumb fucking goatee  in the middle of his fat face.  And he was giving me shit  about something.  So I called him  a piggy fat,  fatty piggy boy.  And made some kind of, 
[02:41:30]  I insinuated that he probably  had trouble getting girls,  which he probably does,  so that was probably  very hurtful to him.  And then I blocked him.  There.  Bye-bye.  That's how I do it.  There's a lot of hate  in this world.  Oh.  Twitter is really just a,  it's a place to hate.  It really is.  Let's say,  out of Jeremy in Indiana,  he is a furry.  What?  Jeremy, what's up?  The main thing behind it is, 
[02:42:00]  you guys are right  with the kind of  the loser aspect.  At least you're admitting it.  Well, I mean,  my biggest deal is  I have a very small dick.  I've had very,  very bad experiences  through high school.  Wait, wait, wait.  How small is your dick?  How small is your pecker?  Yeah, this isn't gay,  by the way, Ed.  We just need to get  some details out.  All right,  because I am the gay police here.  How small is your dick?  I mean,  probably four inches. 
[02:42:30]  At least it's not  like a baby penis,  like a micro penis.  Hey, hey, hey.  We're not allowed  to look at micro penises  on the internet.  Why?  But for me,  we don't actually have sex.  A lot of people,  we take like the,  it's called Molly  or MD&A,  and it's just a lot  of petting  and rubbing  against each other.  Just getting cum  all over each other.  It's fucking,  those fursuits  are all fucked up.  Not even,  just a bunch of, 
[02:43:00]  Madden would cum.  They're not even cumming.  They're just a bunch  of friendless dildos  needing affection.  Yeah.  All right,  that's pre-cumming.  Shoulder rubbing.  Just a lot of pre-cumming.  Fucking madden.  Fucking sticking  those hairs all together.  Doing animal rubs  and no one's going,  you look like an idiot  doing that.  These are all doing it.  Yes.  Douchebags.  They make animal noises.  The thing with mine is,  mine's not really  a big,  big animal suit.  I actually had  this one made. 
[02:43:30]  The head actually  has nice air holes in it.  So,  it's really cool.  It's a great place  for a bullet.  Jesus.  His head.  Air holes.  I'm sorry,  sir.  What is your animal?  What kind of animal  do you have?  What furry are you?  Yes.  Mine's actually,  it's kind of like  a sheepdog looking thing.  It's real shaggy  on the back  and then the stomach  is velvet lined.  So,  you know,  when we're doing 
[02:44:00]  like the dry mumping  or rubbing,  they're getting the pleasure  on the outside  plus I'm getting it  on the inside.  Oh my God.  What a weird world.  How many conventions  conventions do you go  to a year  or functions  or whatever?  I've only been  to two of those  big ones  but we have them  local here.  Like,  I'm about three hours  south of Indianapolis.  So,  we'll go up there  and,  you know,  get three or four  like suites  and you just kind of  go room to room  and there'll be  maybe 15,  20 people in a room 
[02:44:30]  and you just kind  of go in there  and...  Do what?  Do you eat animal food?  Do you eat fucking lettuce?  No,  we go out.  You know,  some people don't want  to be known  outside of their  furry costumes  but...  No shit.  A lot of us  will take the costumes  off.  I'm not dead.  I don't work.  You know,  I drive a truck  and everything.  I'm not driving  a truck  in a fucking dog costume  or anything.  I wish you would  right into an abutment.  Exactly.  Or I wish you'd  chase a car  in your dog costume.  I like to dress  like the dog catcher 
[02:45:00]  and gas all of you.  Fucking euthanize you.  I would too  but not the kind  of gas you're saying.  I would love to drop  a putrid gasser  in a furry costume  which would stink  up your back  your fur would smell like  it would linger  quite a while  caught in the fabric.  They'd be hugging you  and it would be  going all like  out the back  of your dumb  furf  It would be coming  out your air holes  Yeah.  Yeah, your neck.  Poor guy's just  trying to bring  some excitement  into his life.  Blowing up his spot.  The funny story  behind it is 
[02:45:30]  a bunch of us  actually came  and seen Jimmy  in Nashville.  Oh, really?  Thank you very much.  Without your costumes.  Right.  Because Jimmy  would have noticed that.  Yeah, he would have  definitely noticed that.  I tried to talk  a few people  into doing it  but we didn't think  we'd actually be  let into the club.  Right.  Okay.  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you.  We got one more  on the line.  You know what you  want to do  if you're a furry?  You want to put  on a bunny nose  and hang yourself  in it.  Hang yourself  in the basement 
[02:46:00]  with a bunny nose.  A bunny nose.  Kurt in Cleveland  is also a furry.  Kurt, what could you  add to what  the last guy was saying?  Well, honestly,  I mean,  when we go  to these conventions  I generally just go  to hang out  with kind of  like-minded people.  I have a bunch  of friends  in the community.  so, I mean,  when I'm there  not necessarily  going there  to get in soup  but just hang out  with people  who I've, you know, 
[02:46:30]  kind of bonded with.  So.  Ugh.  You sound creepy.  People I've bonded with.  Do you have sex  with them?  No.  No, they're just friends.  So.  Yeah.  Who's like the stud  at the furry convention?  Is it the guy  with the furriest costume  or the most original  or is it the big tail?  Like, ooh,  that guy looks like  he's fun to hang out with.  Yes.  Well, there are some  very good-looking people  in these convention circuits. 
[02:47:00]  No, they're not.  Compared to what?  Convention circuits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you guys do?  Like, you'll write the week  after the burn victims  are there just  to the hotel people  like, oh, you handsome devils.  Are there like celebrity ones?  Not like real celebrities  but in that circle  or they're like,  oh, the wolf guy's here.  Yeah, oh, look,  it's Scooby-Doo.  Yeah, there's definitely  there's suits people,  you know,  I'll talk about  and there's bigger names.  Plus, they're all dancing  in front of each other.  They're probably embarrassed 
[02:47:30]  to dance.  They can just be themselves.  Let your freak flag fly.  Really?  Oh, I hate this.  I'm watching them dance.  I know.  Oh, they're awful.  That's it?  There's nothing else  you could add?  I like when a pretty woman  looks like she's wearing  a dog costume backwards.  See?  It means she has a penis  and the tail has a penis.  Yes, of course.  He's just cracking us up.  I'm tired, dude.  All right, thank you, Kurt.  We're going to move on.  Let's see one of these guys 
[02:48:00]  drag their ass across the rug  like they have worms.  Oh, look, he's scooting.  Look, he's scooting  because of the worms.  Yeah.  You have to deworm him.  That's what you say  if you're caught fisting  another furry.  You're deworming?  I'm just deworming Harry.  Harry.  Yeah.  Guy's wife has no idea  where he is.  He tells her he's away  from business.  Yeah, he's got a fist  up his head.  She doesn't see that he's  fucking, that he's loading  a giant rabbit costume  into the fucking trunk. 
[02:48:30]  Asshole.  He's got a wolf costume  in a fucking box  in the garage.  Oh, God.  All right, we're going to break.  Maybe we'll talk about  meatballs next.  And don't we have to do a...  And we could do Jocktober.  We've got a surprise Jocktober.  Something I asked for  a couple weeks ago  and Sam surprised us  with it today.  Do we have enough time  to get through it,  do you think?  Yeah, if we do it right  when we get back.  All right, maybe we do that then. 
[02:49:00]  Maybe we do just that.  The Opinion 3 Channel.  Oh, yeah!  On Sirius XM.  This year,  to honor Black History Month,  the Opinion Anthony Show  recognizes some of the great  African-American inventors.  Today, we honor J Standard,  inventor of the refrigerator.  Hey, thanks for coming over.  Sit down, enjoy the food.  Woo, I'm about to get  my grub on, kid.  What the fuck? 
[02:49:30]  This shit is rotten, nigga.  Who you think  you fucking with, yo?  Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry.  It's just,  the meat's been sitting out  for days.  I mean, what else  do you expect?  I expect you not to be  a fucking idiot  and eat at my crib next time.  I invented the refrigerator, kid.  Keep that shit chill  while you chilling.  That sounds much better.  We'll eat at your house  next time.  Good, your wife  is already here.  What?  Why?  The Refrigerator.  Another African-American  contribution  to enrich our lives. 
[02:50:00]  For Black History Month,  this is the  Opinion Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opinion Anthony Show.  All right, if we start now,  we could do a little Jocktober.  I want to do a little Jocktober.  People are saying Jocktober.  Yeah, I know.  It's February.  A lot of people  have been talking about Jocktober  or saying it's one of their  favorite bits.  Yes, it is.  Joe Rogan loves Jocktober. 
[02:50:30]  Ooh.  And so I said to Sam  a couple weeks ago,  I said, look,  one day just surprise us  with a Jocktober,  just a little taste.  Yeah.  And today he surprised us  with a little taste.  Mmm.  Yummy.  So we're going to take a look  at this fine radio show  out of Miami.  Miami.  Miami.  Miami.  Have we heard the name?  Power 96.  Oh.  Usually dummies in here  on the intertubes 
[02:51:00]  showing us the website.  Yeah, what the hell?  Put the face  with the names  and the sounds.  What's going on with you?  Sam Roberts.  What's up?  You're supposed to put  the radio station.  You told us to hurry with this.  Yeah.  You told us we had to start  right away,  so I started right away,  but you weren't in your seat.  I had a PV.  What happened?  Everything's fine now, though.  Oh, good.  All right, so I said  we're doing Power 96  out of Miami.  Fucker.  I chipped like that  for some reason.  Fuckin' A.  Peepee.  Because I said peepee.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I was just  trying to be funny.  Yeah, Power 96  in Miami.  Hit music?  Yeah, but it's got a...  Hip-hop?  It's very urban influence,  Hispanic influence,  because it's Miami, obviously.  Is it some reggaeton?  They'd probably sneak  in some reggaeton.  Reggaeton.  Reggaeton.  I think it's reggaeton.  Reggaeton.  There you go.  No, you don't say that.  Reggaeton.  Reggaeton.  Riggaetoni.  Riggaetonit.  But, you know,  they got a lot going on  on the show. 
[02:52:00]  You're talking  guy-girl combo?  Yeah, a guy  and two girls.  Guy and two girls.  That's a little different.  Or maybe, you know what?  No.  It's a guy,  because I was listening  to a couple different shows.  This one's a...  I think it's a guy  and a gay guy  and a girl.  Hey!  Like that.  Fezz's from around the world.  That don't make no sense.  Still waiting for that, Pat.  Fezz's from around the world.  So, they got a couple of staple bits,  you know, 
[02:52:30]  that I thought we would look at.  Benchmarks.  And then, yeah,  and then there's another...  There's a part of the playlist  that was...  Why are we seeing their faces?  Because it's probably  The Fugitive again.  I don't want to...  I don't want to give any spoilers.  We don't want to do  The Fugitive.  Oh, no.  Not The Fugitive.  Is it The Fugitive?  It's not The Fugitive.  Oh.  Is it The Fugitive?  It is not The Fugitive.  Fair enough.  So, we're doing  a surprise jocktober today.  Right.  This is not going to be  a regular feature.  Just every once in a while,  Sam's going to throw  one of these at us. 
[02:53:00]  Sure.  Okay?  Because if we do it too much,  then it'll take the specialness  away of it.  Obviously, there's something  on their website  that Sam doesn't want us to see.  That's correct.  Yeah, because he's...  Oh, really?  Because he hasn't punched up  the website.  Don't look at feedbacks  and stuff.  You're smart!  Because listeners  are figuring it out, you know.  Okay, The Morning Show  does a dramatic reading  of an Instagram bio.  That's one of their  like, benchmarks.  Like, they do this  like, not only every day,  multiple times a day.  That sounds good.  This is like something new  and hip and in 
[02:53:30]  with the kids.  What, is it the Instagram  of one of their listeners?  Yeah.  But their idea  of a dramatic reading  is just to read it  and there's a piano bed.  I like it.  You do.  And now,  Instagram bio profiles  narrated by Lucy Lopez.  Panda underscore cookie  from Miami writes,  hashtag Miami,  hashtag Asian,  but not Asian. 
[02:54:00]  Confused?  It's okay.  Me too.  Smile and have a sense  of humor.  Hashtag smiling.  Hashtag pitbull lover,  pero not the rapper.  And that was  Instagram bio profiling  by Lucy Lopez.  Wow.  They do that a lot?  Wasn't that,  wasn't that a tweet though?  It's the Instagram profile.  Instagram,  so when you post a picture  on Instagram,  you know,  hashtag the shit out of it.  We all know that.  There was no context 
[02:54:30]  removed from that.  No.  That was just,  what was the creative part?  Yeah.  There wasn't any.  The music,  I think.  I'm sorry,  you're right.  The music,  the piano.  I do have an answer.  The music makes it creative.  Yeah,  I don't quite get it.  I mean,  I kind of like that  they're mocking  their shitty listeners,  but I don't get the...  I don't even think  they're mocking them.  They're just reading them.  They're mocking...  That's bad.  Wow,  we don't even know  for sure what they're mocking.  I don't even know  what that was.  Yes.  If I had to throw a guess in,  they're mocking  the use of hashtags.  I guess,  but they, 
[02:55:00]  I mean...  But that's how you get  your shit out there.  No.  And what was the...  I'm sure they use hashtags.  Mr. Bruno told me that.  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  He goes,  oh,  you got some good  Instagram pictures,  but you gotta hashtag  the shit out of it.  Oh.  I said,  thank you,  Mr. Bruno.  They do.  I never really hashtag...  I only hashtag ridiculous things.  I don't know which hashtags  to use.  I don't know.  I never hashtag shit.  Photo.  I know cloud porn's  a good one.  Yeah.  That'll get you  some fucking views.  Photo New York.  Hashtag puppies. 
[02:55:30]  All right,  that was terrific.  Yeah,  terrific stuff.  Good start  for the surprise  Jocktober bit.  They all,  but they do interact  with their listeners.  You're talking about,  you know,  hashtags and stuff.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  This is what the track  is labeled,  so.  Uh-huh.  Uh-oh,  time for someone  to get busted.  What does that mean?  No,  that's all caps.  BUSTED!  Oh.  But listen,  we have to help out  Annie real quick,  okay?  We have to help out Annie.  Of course,  ghosted her...  Wait a minute.  No!  No! 
[02:56:00]  No!  No!  Jimmy got it first!  And because of Jimmy's no,  it made me think.  No!  No!  Makes me so excited.  No,  they're not doing this!  Oh my god!  Come on!  This is the go-to bit right now.  Is it Roses  or is it something else?  It's the same.  Is it War of the Roses?  It's War of the Roses.  Oh my god!  It's executed.  This isn't really  happening out there.  This fucking bit's hilarious.  Oh,  you like it, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  They get the girl  or the guy.  Why would they do this? 
[02:56:30]  It's busted, though.  But if you're trying  to make your name  in radio,  why would you follow  everyone else  with this dumb bit?  Unbelievable.  This is a dumb bit.  They're so desperately  afraid of getting fired  in these shows.  Yeah.  Well,  if you listen to it,  you can tell  that this one  is for real.  Oh,  this one's real.  And how many views  does the Ryan Seacrest  have on his  YouTube channel?  Because he did one  and it's so obviously  fake and horrible,  but everyone just  ate it up.  Oh,  God.  Why?  But listen,  we have to help out  Annie real quick, 
[02:57:00]  okay?  La Boe to Annie,  of course,  goes through her man's  phone and finds a  number that he's been  texting back and forth  with AH.  And apparently he was  texting you all up  and down at the  Heat game.  The Lakers.  AH,  you missed one.  Asshole.  Arnie Hammer.  Yeah?  Adolf.  Oh,  God,  Jesus.  You missed one,  Ed.  Oh,  Adolf Hitler.  Jesus.  He's texting AH.  Uh-oh.  Oh,  boy.  AH.  And apparently he was  texting you all up  and down at the  Heat game. 
[02:57:30]  The Laker game.  Let's call Alan.  Are you ready?  Ah,  yes,  I am absolutely  stupendously ready.  New busted.  New busted.  They play the phone  dial thing.  Oh,  yeah,  that's a staple.  And they play the  fucking beep,  boop,  boop,  in the ring.  And they know  he's going to  answer and they  don't tell him  you're on the  radio.  Right.  Right.  Poor shit.  Is that Desperate  Housewives theme?  What?  That they're playing?  Is that the  Desperate Housewives theme?  I don't know.  I don't watch  the movie.  I'm glad I don't  know the answer.  I only watch  Beverly Hills,  Atlanta,  and Jersey. 
[02:58:00]  Not Real Housewives.  Oh,  what?  The show,  Desperate Housewives.  Oh,  Desperate Housewives.  I thought you meant  Real Housewives.  Because they all  play that theme song  on their bit.  Every station.  I like how they  sneak in some  Spanish words  here and there,  too.  Yes.  Very clever.  Si.  Si.  Hello?  Good morning.  Is this Louis?  Yeah,  this is him.  Hey,  Louis,  how are you?  This is him.  Oh,  yeah,  this is him.  Yeah,  this is him.  Not this is me,  that's me.  Who's this?  Oh,  yeah,  this is him.  Because everyone  answers their cell 
[02:58:30]  phone like that.  Right.  All the spam  calls.  I'm right next to you.  Right.  I'm in production.  This is him?  No one says that.  Yeah,  by the way,  we also love pointing out  how bad the acting  is on these  because they're not  real people.  They're people  that know the bit  and have to,  you know,  go through their lines.  We got a guy in the line.  I'm a paid actor  in these  Hackey War of the Roses  calls.  Oh,  okay.  Yes.  All right.  Let's talk to him  for a sec.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  Matt in Michigan,  what's up?  Hey,  how are you guys?  Are you really,  are you really get paid  to do these things?  Absolutely.  It's the hackiest  fucking thing  you could ever be  involved with,  but I get 50 bucks  for a five minute  phone call.  Oh my God.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hello,  Matt.  Yeah,  this is Matt.  That's exactly it.  You've got to sit there  every single time  and pretend like, 
[02:59:30]  oh my God,  I had no idea  that you're calling me.  I literally,  one time,  one time they made me  call Hawaii  and they cut me off  while they were recording it  because they said  that I was speaking  too proper.  I need to be more laid back  like a Hawaiian guy  that just got caught cheating.  Oh my God.  Okay,  what are you doing?  Ah,  drinking a pineapple juice.  Did you say Hawaii things?  But how did you get  involved with that?  You're,  you're an actor  or something  and no,  I'm actually a comic 
[03:00:00]  and somebody told me  that like another comic  at an open mic  or something  said that he was doing it.  Okay.  So I was like,  well,  I'll gladly take 50 bucks  to do phone calls  between like 9 a.m.  and 11 a.m.  Wow.  See,  here you go.  Busted!  We just busted busted.  We just busted busted.  Jesus.  Anything else you could  tell us, Matt,  or is that about it?  I mean,  they try to keep  some sort of like  anonymity about it,  but when you get,  every one of them, 
[03:00:30]  though,  it's just like a mad gab  where you just plug in  like,  they'll be like,  okay, Matt,  this one,  it was a girl  from The Office,  so we'll do that swing  for this one  because you haven't  done The Office.  See.  Oh,  okay.  This is the business  I used to love.  Yes,  that's right,  Sam.  I said used to.  Welcome to it,  Sam.  I used to love this business  and this is what  it's come down to.  But I'd like to think  Busted is not doing that.  Like,  Busted is forever.  Oh,  this is real.  Yeah,  War of the Roses is fake.  Busted is real. 
[03:01:00]  Busted's real.  Yeah,  let's get back  into this phone call.  Thank you, Matt.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  Phony crock of shit.  Yeah,  see you later,  alligator.  There you go.  Good one,  Chipper.  A guy making 50 bucks a call.  What are you going to do?  It's nice money.  Righteous bucks.  Hello?  Good morning.  Is this Louis?  Yeah,  this is him.  Hey,  Louis,  how are you?  This is Alan.  I'm calling from the Miami  Heat Marketing Department.  How are you today?  Not bad.  Yourself?  I'm doing pretty good.  We're just letting you know  because you are a loyal 
[03:01:30]  season ticket holder,  you were randomly selected  to receive an all-expense  paid trip to New York  for the next game  when the Heat play the Knicks.  All right,  you were one of 50  loyal Heat fans selected.  Are you serious?  Yes,  sir.  Oh,  that's awesome,  man.  Can I bring a guest?  Did you hear his last one?  No,  no.  Can I bring a guest?  He's hot.  Oh,  my God.  This stinks.  That's awesome.  Can I bring a guest?  The guy would say  you and a guest are flying, 
[03:02:00]  but not in this one.  Of course you can bring a guest.  Now,  everyone knows that  if you win something.  Cecil Fielder writes  it's the Six Feet Under  theme song.  Oh,  maybe,  okay,  yeah,  they all use  the Six Feet Under  theme song.  That's the one  they like to use?  You said Desperate Housewives.  Right,  obviously you don't watch the show.  Oh.  So there's your setup  and the caller  helping out by saying  can I bring a guest,  which now sets up  the busted angle.  Uh-oh.  Yes,  you can.  You can bring a guest. 
[03:02:30]  The only thing  I would need is  I need your guest  complete name  so I can confirm  these reservations  and then we will  get back to you  within 24 hours.  Oh,  hell yeah.  All right.  Oh,  hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Sounds like a real fan  to me.  It certainly does.  Hell yeah.  Oh boy.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Her name's Amanda.  Uh-huh.  You mean to spill that?  Um,  no,  I don't need it.  Oh,  by the way,  when is this game?  I don't have a schedule handy. 
[03:03:00]  Oh,  it's tonight,  mother.  Climmy ass.  Oh,  Christ.  I just needed a fucking breeze  before we get it to this point.  Oh,  it's tonight,  mother.  Oh,  no.  How did they put the beeps in  a live call?  I don't know.  It's very interesting,  but they seem to know  when she's going to curse.  Yeah,  yeah,  it's fucking amazing.  So obviously,  his girlfriend's on the other line.  That's the setup.  Busted.  Busted.  Yep.  Oh,  it's tonight,  mother.  Climmy ass.  Creasy mother.  Who the fuck is AH?  There's not no call with Annie.  So you're fucking us both? 
[03:03:30]  What the fuck is talking about?  Whoa.  Whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  Annie?  What the fuck?  What is this?  I'm going to tell you what this is,  bro.  It's JP,  Big Lip,  and Lucy Lowe,  the Power 90 Morning Show,  bro.  You're live on the radio  and you've just been  busted.  He was busted.  You know what?  You don't even have to come get your  shit.  This is going to be on my  doorstep burning,  mother.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh,  she just burned her phone.  What a dream come true  if somebody shut her up. 
[03:04:00]  Good one.  Busted.  Busted.  Sounder.  Morning show.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  they said every hour?  Yeah.  Wait,  wait,  wait.  Do they just replay it  or do they do a new one  every hour?  They do new ones.  Oh my God,  stop it.  That's all they do  with their show?  Everyone gets caught?  Between music?  Can I tell you?  Oh,  Christ,  what is radio doing?  They also do prank calls,  but they have a character  that does them.  You know what the character is? 
[03:04:30]  What's that?  Carmen.  Yes.  What?  They do Carmen calls.  Yes.  Yeah.  No,  they don't.  Yes,  they do.  Wow,  they really just decided  to take every hacky fucking  used up bit.  There's nothing to it.  They get the show out of it.  It's Miami too,  man.  This is like a big market  in radio.  What's this Power 96 promo?  I forgot to mention  the promo they're running.  What does that mean?  Well,  because the thing is,  just now,  they said we're the  Power 90 morning show.  Right.  But the station's Power 96. 
[03:05:00]  Uh-oh.  And I guess I forgot  to tell you guys  what the station's been doing.  What happened?  Before we started,  so I guess we'll just  run the promo,  so that way we're...  I'm not doing the fugitive.  I told you it's not the fugitive.  Because I think you're lying.  I wouldn't lie.  I'm not doing it.  I can't do that anymore.  What's he on?  You know he's lying to us.  Wait,  the Power 90?  Okay,  listen.  No,  I'm not doing this,  Sam.  Why would they say Power 90  if it's Power 96? 
[03:05:30]  These shows that we're  listening to were taped  on Friday and yesterday.  There's no way  there's a fugitive.  I'm walking out.  You're lying to me.  I'm not stupid.  I told you it's not  the fugitive.  I love Jocktober,  but I'm done  with the fugitive crap.  But the problem is...  Fuck,  it's the fugitive.  How much you want to bet?  I told you it's not  the fugitive.  But the problem is...  Yes.  The station's Power 96,  and why would they say  Power 90 is the question?  I don't know. 
[03:06:00]  It's weird, right?  Do you want me  to hazard a guess?  I don't know.  I mean,  if you have,  I'm totally like...  Yes.  I'm guessing  someone stole the six.  Oh my God.  But that's ridiculous,  Hans.  Of course it's ridiculous.  How could somebody steal  the six?  Maybe the six  represents $6,000.  Dude,  I can't do this.  Do you understand?  Wait,  what do you mean?  I have to hear it.  We're moving into  a fugitive bit. 
[03:06:30]  It's so obvious.  He's a liar.  No,  I told you  it's not the fugitive.  I have to hear it.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  This motherfucker's lying.  Who are you kidding?  I told you  it's not the fugitive.  They stole the six.  Why are you crying?  You got tears in your eyes.  Sam's crying.  You suck.  Why would somebody  steal the six?  You're ruining  the surprise October bit  for me.  In Power 96.  Like,  I can handle  a few more busted calls.  Apparently,  their Facebook page  is getting a lot  of attention right now. 
[03:07:00]  Can we see that?  I was curious.  No,  we're not allowed to see  anything yet.  I won't show you  until OB plays the promo.  Oh,  fuck.  Here's the promo.  Let's hear it.  Our six  has been stolen.  We pray  it's found  as soon as possible.  We need  your help.  The reward  is $10,000.  $10,000.  The Power 90 Thief  will be calling  this afternoon  at 2.  Wait.  If you believe  you know  who the Power 90 Thief  is,  do you have 
[03:07:30]  Power 90 Thief  six  and be rewarded  with $10,000?  Do we get to hear  the voice?  You technically  didn't lie,  but it's the same bit.  They just changed  the name of it.  It's a thief,  not a fugitive.  Fuck!  Hey, Sam,  do we get to hear  his voice?  Here,  I forgot.  He has his secret disc  the whole time.  No,  you have the disc.  I just forgot  that half the playlist  got ripped off.  I found it.  You son of a bitch!  There he comes. 
[03:08:00]  I have the playlist.  Busted.  No!  No!  I just want to hear  the voice of the thief.  Because I want to hear.  So what,  they're calling themselves  Power 90  because someone  stole the six?  Yeah,  that's a lie.  What fucking  retarded PD  came up with that?  But they need people  to write down  Power 96  for the ratings.  If you listen carefully,  the last,  at the end  of the Busted promo,  it said every hour  on Power 90  FM. 
[03:08:30]  Why can't they say six?  Because it got stolen.  Look at the website.  But no one owns six.  Yeah,  what are you talking about?  It doesn't even make sense.  But who gives a shit  that six is gone?  Right,  no one owns  the number six.  What are they talking about?  There's a picture  of a black guy  with Power 9  written next to him.  It looks like an escort ad.  But you see in the logo  that the six got ripped off?  But you can't...  So why don't they just say  it's still Power 96?  The thief took the six. 
[03:09:00]  How do you take  someone saying six?  Why do you steal it  all for everyone's...  I wish it was...  How does it happen?  I can't be funny with this.  Why don't the web guy  just put the six back on?  Yeah.  Somebody took it.  You can't take a six  off a website.  You guys don't understand.  And why don't they  just say Power 96  instead of Power 90?  Because the thief  took the six.  Oh, this is fucking retarded.  I want to hear the voice.  I got to hear  the fucking thief's voice.  Please, please, no.  I just got to hear it.  I told you it was...  Please, I swear. 
[03:09:30]  And don't...  I don't want you guys  to call me a liar anymore  because that...  You're technically  not a liar.  Right.  But you're extremely misleading.  Technically.  Oh, okay.  You're extremely misleading.  Maybe misleading.  Morning Show talks about  the Power 90 thief.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Power 90 thief, you.  Oh, you're back.  Oh, how annoying  that we cannot find this search.  8-0-9.  Still missing our six.  Oh, my God.  It's so embarrassing.  Oh, how annoying  we cannot find the six. 
[03:10:00]  Fuck.  Oh.  Still missing our six.  Help us find it.  And you could be $10,000 richer.  Think about it.  What would you do?  Just sit back and think.  You know what they should say?  Can you pause it?  They should say it was stolen.  Someone stole our dignity.  We'd like some help  finding our dignity  and the creativity  that motivated us  to get in this business  and our integrity  as performers.  Yes.  That was stolen.  They got a Facebook page  that just says,  do you have our six?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:10:30]  That's terrible.  Some consultant  came up with this horrendous idea  and I guess it must work  in some weird way  because they're all doing it.  Think about it.  What would you do?  Just sit back and think.  What would I do  with $10,000?  Like Kanye said,  I'd be ignorant.  Ignant?  Ignant.  I-G-N-A-N-T.  I'm by a chain.  I'm by some room.  Well, they're fantasizing  over what they would do  with $10,000.  And how would they  get that $10,000? 
[03:11:00]  They got to find the six.  That's right.  Where do you find a six?  A six.  Sam.  I got one in my pants.  Yeah?  That is just a penis joke.  Sam rubs it in.  Yeah.  The Power 90 thief calls in.  He has a familiar voice.  Oh, does he?  You piece of shit.  Let's hear the Power 90,  not 96 because they're  missing the six.  Let's hear the, uh,  I'm glad you're all in  with this bit, Ant.  It's Power 90 foot. 
[03:11:30]  Foot.  I'm glad you're all in  with the bit.  Oh, I'm all in.  You're also not saying 96  because the six was stolen.  Exactly.  Geez.  Are people being nice  about the, uh...  Oh, the Facebook page.  Are they supportive of the fans?  No.  There are links to  Lemon Party.  Of course.  Oh, boy.  That's not nice.  It looks like their, uh,  their public wall  has been shut down.  Uh-oh.  But their recommendations  are still open.  All right.  So you could just  write a recommendation.  One guy says,  buy a nine and flip it over.  Fuck the thief. 
[03:12:00]  You're crazy.  There's a problem solver.  Uh, okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  You want to hear his voice?  Yeah.  Okay.  708 Power 90 Morning Show  and, uh,  guess who's on the phone, Lucy?  Oh, gosh.  The Power 90 Thief.  Dude, I don't even  want to talk to you.  Just give me a call, please.  Good morning.  God damn it. 
[03:12:30]  God damn it.  Fucking radio stinks.  That dumb voice.  This isn't happening  in late February.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Come on, Sam.  Who's got the six?  I don't know.  I hate it.  Just give me the clue, please.  Good morning, losers.  Ooh.  Don't bother with Hulu  or TiVo.  It won't help you with this. 
[03:13:00]  But I was once on VH1.  Please, look quick  or you'll miss.  Bye.  What?  Huh?  He was on VH1?  Or she?  It.  This person was on VH1.  I'm so confused right now.  Raging?  So confused.  Raging.  Help us find our six, por favor.  Por favor.  They're not explaining.  At least the fugitive  has taken money.  You're right. 
[03:13:30]  How do you steal a six?  You can't.  It's dumb.  It's a worthless bit.  Like, at least the fugitive,  you can go,  ah, I broke in for the money.  Right.  How do you justify  saying these words?  Please.  It doesn't make sense.  It was fine.  There's six, por favor.  Why would it matter  if they don't have a six?  It doesn't.  Of course.  It doesn't make any sense.  Why would you change  your production to 90 foot?  90 foot.  Hey, it's 90 foot.  90 foot.  90 foot. 
[03:14:00]  What?  Well, somebody stole the six.  Carol City, and I wonder  who's more annoying,  Lil Wayne or the Power 90 Thief?  What do you think?  Excellent question.  I'm going to go with the thief.  Yeah, he's on the line.  I don't even want to talk to you, dude.  Just do me a favor.  Give us back our six.  Give me a clue right now.  Give us back our six.  How stupid.  I hope he gives it back to them,  but it's wrapped around a bullet.  Somebody just commented  on one of their posts.  Ha ha, Jim Norton unfriended you. 
[03:14:30]  There's a lot of racial comments.  Oh, man, just give us back our six.  Por favor.  Por favor.  Give me a clue right now.  Anyone want to talk to this guy?  You all have your pages  and places to socialize.  Oh.  You can search on Flickr.  And with this clue,  you can monetize.  Flickr?  Haven't used Flickr in ages.  What? 
[03:15:00]  It just gets weirder and weirder.  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  You don't think so?  No.  Weirder.  No one has time to figure out dumb clues.  You get, like...  Worst.  If you talk to, in their case,  a couple hundred thousand people,  maybe 20 people would do this.  Oh, I know.  No one gives a fuck.  You have to go up to people and say,  do you have power 96?  No one's gonna do that.  Do you have power 96?  Yeah.  Do you have power 96?  Is that like having your back? 
[03:15:30]  Do you have our six?  Do you know what stinks so bad  is that there's some fucking  cocksucker consultant  who told these people  that this would help them.  Like, this is what you should be doing.  Yeah.  The consultants in radio  are just fucking garbage.  I'm a fugitive.  Oh, wait a minute.  There's a dog  greatest clip ever.  I mean, there's a dog.  A fugitive.  Can I ask you,  what borough of New York  do you live in now? 
[03:16:00]  I live in Queens.  What's happening, fugitive?  What happened, fugitive?  No, no, no, nothing.  I actually,  the dog had just walked  a little bit too cute.  The dog walked a little bit too cute.  We're back live.  That's just one of the dumbest things ever.  It's so funny.  Makes me laugh every time.  It was totally true. 
[03:16:30]  Well.  He's on the phone.  That was uncalled for.  Good morning.  Good morning, losers.  How are you doing?  At least he's addressing them right.  What's up?  Where can you find me  in the six that you seek?  I go to the post office  at least once a week.  What?  Call me back.  Return our six  immediately.  The worst Riddler.  The worst Riddler.  It doesn't even rhyme.  He's a Whittler.  Who is he? 
[03:17:00]  The Power 90 morning show.  Power 90.  It's horrible for branding.  The Power 90.  It is so fucking god awful bad.  I wish I was on that show  just so I could say,  how do you steal a six?  Yeah.  How do you do it?  How do you do that?  The acting is horrendous.  The bit's horrendous.  The concept.  You can't even follow.  Give our spec R6. 
[03:17:30]  Who changed the production?  You know the production guy's annoyed.  Really?  We're doing that bit  and that means I have to change  all the production  to the Power 90.  Power 90.  I always just think of the meeting  when they first bring this up.  The PD going,  guys, we're going to do  we're going to do the fugitive bit.  It's a takeoff.  But we're going to  yeah, we're going to do it different.  We got a spin on it.  Yeah, we got a spin. 
[03:18:00]  How about this?  Our six is missing.  What?  The six from Power 96?  He steals our six.  Huh?  And not one person goes,  well that sounds stupid.  You're a fucking retard.  Right, right.  What do you mean?  Not one person speaks up.  Yes.  Or they might ask,  what do you mean?  And they look, man,  the ratings are suffering.  Do you guys want jobs?  I mean, uh.  Okay, six.  Right, I get it.  Power 102 is creeping up.  But now if we're Power 94.  Power 94.  Everyone will be talking about it. 
[03:18:30]  The malls,  all the kids will be going,  yo, man,  where's the motherfucking six?  Yo, you seen the six, son?  Son.  Why don't they just get  a graphic artist  to fill in the six there?  Or just not delete it  in the first place.  Yeah.  But I'm sure that's on billboards  and banners and stuff  and that's the dumbest thing ever  because you're trying to get people  to listen to Power 96.  They know it's Power 9 something.  No, but it's not.  But they're like,  wait a minute.  Someone has taken a number.  This is Power 94.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[03:19:00]  I wanted to listen to Power 96.  Fuck.  This picture of their logo  with the six obviously chopped off.  Yeah.  Somebody just commented  five minutes ago,  OMG, where's your six?  Question mark, question mark,  question mark,  question mark,  question mark.  They have to get it.  Someone stole it.  Wow, that's bad.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's, well,  the midday guy gets a call too  because you got involved  the whole stage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All day parts.  All day parts.  There's another theme with these.  Well?  The midday guy has to sell it 
[03:19:30]  even harder than the morning show  because the midday guy  gets fired for nothing.  So like the midday guy  doesn't have a morning show  to get to.  Right, right.  And he has to oversell it too  because midday guys  are usually background noise  on music channels.  Or this is his chance to shine.  Or they're the PDs themselves.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, usually.  So they oversell it.  Hey, thief person.  It's been a minute  since we've talked.  How you been?  How was your weekend?  I had a fantastic weekend.  Thank you for asking.  You know,  just trying to be nice.  You can look high 
[03:20:00]  and you can look low  but way up in the air  can get you some dough.  I never get these.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not letting you get it.  I've been nice to you.  Oh, it's been up, Steve.  No.  Here it goes, Jimmy.  W-P-O-W,  H-C-1,  Miami,  Fort Lauderdale  on the Palm Beaches.  There it is.  Your power 90 thief.  Loser.  Hit the post on that motherfucker, though.  Power 90 thief.  You're fucking it up.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be... 
[03:20:30]  It's power 90.  Fuck.  Finally.  Power 90.  Wow.  Finally,  the midday guy  talks to a real life,  not set up,  legit call  from someone  who's really looking  for the thief.  All right, cool.  They realize  no one's calling  and they got to try  to push the bit forward  so they're like,  hey, man.  It's always a dumb sales guy  that is cold calling  and, you know,  has nothing to do  with that moment.  They're like,  hey, man,  can you fucking make believe  you're a listener?  Yeah, I got it. 
[03:21:00]  You don't think  it's a real listener?  I think it's going to be  pretty obvious  that it is a real listener.  Oh, thank you.  Oh.  How dare you?  Hey, we'll call her here  on Power 90.  Yes, do you have Power 96?  No, do you have Power 96?  Who has it?  I don't know.  Do you know?  No, tell me.  Give me something more.  Well, the clue we got  at 11 o'clock was  you can look high  and you can...  Why would she call in?  Yeah, why would she call?  Because they don't have the six.  It was stolen from them.  Yeah, if one of the employees  of the station had the six, 
[03:21:30]  he'd probably be like,  look, I found our six.  Right.  Right.  You don't call the radio station.  They're trying to find it out  out in the city of Miami.  This is so fucking stupid.  There's no continuity  to their dumb bit.  But you can hear  the way that Jocko's,  no, do you have  Power 90s 6?  Power 90s 6.  It's just instructions  on how to say it.  Why can't he just say  Power 96?  Because the six is missing  and you don't want to let people  think the six is back.  But that's fucking terrible. 
[03:22:00]  Six was stolen.  That's literally  the worst thing I've ever heard.  That's terrible.  It really is.  It's terrible.  I told you it wasn't a fugitive.  I don't know.  Do you know?  No, tell me.  Give me something more.  Well, the clue we got  at 11 o'clock was  you can look high  and you can look low.  But way up in the air  can get you some dough.  But does that mean  that it's a person in the air?  Like a pilot?  I know the answer.  Hey, what's up there,  Sherlock Holmes?  That makes sense.  But I don't know.  Is it Superman?  Now you're getting crazy. 
[03:22:30]  The music's...  I'm looking around  the room here  just in shock.  It's pizza.  Oh.  If you look up in the air,  you can see some dough.  That's how you make pizza.  You throw the dough  up in the air.  Now, Jimmy's good  at figuring out clues.  I never knew that.  It's a pizza guy.  In high school,  I was voted  boy most likely  to figure out a clue.  Boy most likely  to solve a mystery.  They were right.  Yes, they were.  Now you're getting crazy.  Well, that's it. 
[03:23:00]  I'm glad.  That's it.  The mystery is still out there.  They didn't find the six yet?  Not yet.  Oh, no.  Golly gee.  Don't worry, I'm monitoring.  No, no.  See, it's a surprise,  it's October  and our surprise is over.  That's it.  It's over.  Until next time.  And who gives a shit  where their six was?  Oh, no.  That's horrible.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What?  I'm not going to say it.  No.  It's too brutal a reference.  Oh.  All right.  We're going to go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We lost our six. 
[03:23:30]  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Mimi Beardsley on their Facebook page  says,  I took your six back and to the left.  Ah.  Oh, nice.  Six my ass.  Yeah.  Get your six back.  Stupid.  We good?  Oh, fuck this.  You want to do line of the day?  Yes, we was.  Oh, no.  Not really.  No.  Hey, by the way,  you know Anthony Joselnik  from his Comedy Central stand-up  and his blistering appearances  on Comedy Central roast  to Charlie Sheen and Donald Trump. 
[03:24:00]  Now he's bringing his signature  dark and twisted point of view  to the all-new Comedy Central series  The Joselnik Offensive  airing Tuesday at 10.30 p.m.,  9.30 central  on Comedy Central every Tuesday.

The Joselnik Offensive  Tuesday at 10.30 p.m., 
[03:24:30]  9.30 central  after an all-new Tosh.0  on Comedy Central.  Central.  How many lines of the day  do we have?  We have three runners up.  Do you want to do it  or do you want to do it on Sam's?  Well, we pushed it on him yesterday.  Just know we're sitting here.  All right, let's do it.  What are you doing in there,  you rock?  Futs it around.  Let's do a runner-up  line of the day.  Somebody stole the E-Rock  from the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, someone stole the K.  It's just E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah, that's... 
[03:25:00]  Someone stole the E-Rock.  We should have a fugitive  steal E-Rock from the show.  Oh, Jesus.  And whoever can find E-Rock  would you do that, E-Rock?  It's a BLT.  Why don't we do  the runner-up line of the day?  So I finally get there  and then my balls stunk.  I have to shit sweats.  Another line of the day.  Runner-up.  I would love to drop  a putrid gas  on a furry costume. 
[03:25:30]  It would stink up your back.  Your fur would smell like it.  Oh, my God.  It would linger.  Why do you guys have to  walk down the hall  every day when we're here?  Oh, enough of these two.  Oh, my God.  I bet I know which two  you're talking about.  Exactly.  But why do they have to walk down...  What can they possibly say to us?  It's a fucking fricking  frack of something, right?  They have to be present  when we leave.  Like, what is that about?  Stay down the hall.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Me and Nick get along  with a lot of aspects. 
[03:26:00]  You guys ought to do a podcast  and call it 1940s.  Mask.  Sexual Flavors  is the new way to foreplay.  Available in four tantalizing flavors.  These oral gel strips  will be the spark  to light your bedroom flame.  Visit sexualflavors.com  to purchase  or find a retailer near you.  With that,  here is your line of the day.  Here  comes  the line of the day. 
[03:26:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  The head actually has  nice air holes in it.  So, I mean,  it's really cool.  It's a great place  for a bullet.  Yeah, I was going to say  it's Jesus.  Hey, what's the  hullabaloo?  Do you want to know  one last thing  about Power 90...  No.  ...before we leave? 
[03:27:00]  Their Twitter  used to be Power...  This can't be true.  It is.  It is true?  It is absolutely true.  Their Twitter  used to be Power 965.  96.5, I guess.  Yeah.  It's now Power 9  underscore 5.  Do you know  what their website is?  What?  It's not Power96.com.  No.  It's  whereisthesix.com.  Oh, my God.  They're committing to this, huh?  Full force.  They're all in.  Well, I mean, 
[03:27:30]  they got to get  their six back.  Enough.  Who gives a fuck  about their dumb six?  They do.  It's part of their station.  Jesus.  At least they're  trying to do  bits.  Exactly.  Oh, fuck.  At least they're  trying still  to phone it in.  Fucking people.  Not all of them. 
[03:28:00]  I know.  I hope people know that.  Not all.  Yeah.  I really believe  a small percentage.  I really do.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Try to get out of here  with them in the hallway.  Watch.  You just walk by them.  That's all you have to do.  Exactly.  There's a few people  that if they were  outside that studio,  you know damn well  you can't just walk by them.  You have to stand  and take their shit.  But those guys,  you just walk by them.  Those two?  Put them on the  pay no mind list?  There's nothing  they can do to me.  There's absolutely  nothing they can do to me.  There's two planters.  There's two planters 
[03:28:30]  outside that I'm going  to walk past.  Yeah, you watch us.  All right.  Sammy will continue next.  Samuel.  And I completed  a Sudoku today.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I refuse to give out  ones that I did not complete.  Ooh.  Big prize.  There's been some questions  about that on Twitter.  Only the ones I complete.  All right.  We'll be giving that away.  All right.  Who stole Opie's  Sudoku puzzle?  I wanted to, um... 
[03:29:00]  Are we on?  Yeah.  No, we're not on.  Yeah.  You just got to trust me.  We're not on.  Okay?  All right.  If he were DeRosa,  he'd go,  oh, okay.  I know.  Stupid DeRosa.  Falls for it every time.  Every time.  We're just telling  we weren't on.  I'm going to go look  for that six. 
[03:29:30]  And now,  the Opie and Anthony  show continues.  This is  After ONA Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts.  What a day for a jocktober.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  866-WOW1-WOW  and tell me,  what did you learn?  On today's show.  You know what I learned?  Always wait for that spin. 
[03:30:00]  Always wait for the spin.  They had this audio  in front of them.  They're playing Busted.  They're playing  Hackey Morning Bits.  Boom!  All of a sudden,  you've got a fugitive bit  on your hands.  Who knew?  Who knew?  You just had someone  looking in at you, Sam.  Who?  I think that's Tyler,  the creator.  Tell him to come in here.  He's talking with a bunch  of people in the hallway.  I want to find out  what he learned.  Maybe he was listening  to the show.  What did you learn today,  Eric? 
[03:30:30]  Well,  I learned Jimmy's been  having some issues  with other comics.  all other comics.  I think it sounded like  his issues were  with comics as a whole.  That was his point of,  his argument,  that he didn't have  any specific animosity  toward Colin Quinn,  he said,  but it was comics  as a whole  not having his back  the way he has  had other comics back 
[03:31:00]  was driving him crazy.  But,  I will say,  because he said,  you know,  he just unfollowed  everybody on Twitter  and that it wasn't,  it wasn't a dig,  it wasn't passive-aggressive,  it wasn't anything.  I hate it  when I find out people,  first of all,  when people  who I know  or people  who I think  could be  or should be  following me  aren't,  I get annoyed.  And I get even more  annoyed when I get  unfollowed.  Even when I know  what it is,  like for instance,  Jay Moore,  he used to follow me. 
[03:31:30]  Now he does a thing  where he only follows  one person,  right?  So it's not a personal  slight at me,  but still,  why don't you follow  Sam Roberts?  But that's the Louis C.K.  Yeah,  but Louis started that.  Louis was always  just following  like one person.  Yeah.  Then he's still with it.  I don't know  if he's got,  it's much worse  when like  you used to follow people  and then you stop  following people  it's like,  come on dude.  I'm going to  unfollow you right now.  Well,  I don't care if you  unfollow me, 
[03:32:00]  you're rolling.  It doesn't make a difference.  And then I'll call you out.  Like for instance,  E-Rock,  I've had to call out before  because E-Rock,  I don't know if he  unfollows people.  Facebook?  But he's constantly,  if you annoy him,  he's just hitting  that de-friend button.  And that is such  a girly move.  I like that.  I had to yell at him  and he finally  re-friended me  and he hasn't  de-friended me since.  But you de-friend  all the time.  It depends  what you do.  What do you have to do  to be de-friended  by Eric Nagel? 
[03:32:30]  If you're taking  shit off my Facebook  and whatever,  that's not meant  to be public.  Like what?  What are you saying?  Family stuff or whatever.  Who does that?  There were people here.  Who?  Sal printed pictures.  You're talking about Sal?  Yeah,  he printed pictures  from his Facebook  and put it on our wall.  See,  that's funny though.  He wasn't printing  pictures of your Facebook  of your family.  He was printing  pictures of you  looking stupid.  Because Iraq  has a private Facebook.  He doesn't open it up  to listeners.  I think we all do.  You know,  because we try to interact 
[03:33:00]  with human beings  that we actually know  in our lives.  But Iraq's Facebook  is filled with selfies.  All Iraq does all day  is take selfies.  That's not true.  Because he thinks  that he's good looking.  Like,  Iraq thinks he's cute,  right?  I'm adorable.  See?  And he's not being,  and he's not like joking.  And then when Sal,  when Iraq steps out,  Sal goes on his Facebook  and starts printing  the pictures.  So when Iraq leaves  the office,  Sal goes on Iraq's Facebook  and just starts  printing pictures of him.  The second the man 
[03:33:30]  steps out.  And then he'll hang him up.  And then I'll go  to the other guy,  Dennis,  and go,  look what I got.  So that's why,  so you unfriended Sal.  I don't think I ever,  no,  yeah,  I did.  Well,  he must have had you  as a friend at one point  because he was printing out  all your selfies.  At one point.  But now,  now you defriended him  because,  specifically because  you didn't want him  to have that resource.  Yeah.  But you've also  defriended people  because you've just  been mad at them.  That's what you used to.  That really bothers you. 
[03:34:00]  It's so annoying.  That's why,  on that level,  and I got Jim's explanation,  but on that level,  I understood what  Colin Quinn was saying  because when you  defriended me,  it was so annoying  to me.  And it wasn't,  and yours was much worse  because you didn't  defriend everybody.  You weren't like,  you know what,  I'm going to,  you just defriended me.  Yes.  And I was like,  what is he,  a girl?  What did we break up?  Yes.  But then you haven't  defriended me since then 
[03:34:30]  and you had to  refriend me.  He's like mean girls.  Yeah.  Mike in Jersey.  Hey,  I learned that the guy  playing the fugitive  is an angry actor  who occasionally  is on an Howard Stern show.  Who's that?  Eric the Midget,  they call him,  or Eric the Actor.  And he plays the fugitive?  He's the guy that's,  yeah,  with those stupid fugitive calls  you guys are just playing.  His voice was a little bit muffled,  you know,  they were doing their thing  with that,  but it's Eric the Actor.  I'm telling you,  I swear,  it's probably him.  I guarantee it. 
[03:35:00]  You don't think so,  Eric?  Well,  he just said it was him,  then he said it's probably him.  So you're saying no.  Not him at all.  Not a chance.  The character he's talking about  on Howard Stern  barely can speak English.  Oh.  He's got like a whole slew  of medical issues.  Well,  the fugitive has a strong grasp  on the English language.  And that fugitive  is probably not a midget  because they're obviously  running around  with that six,  escaping everyone.  And you couldn't do that  if you were a midget  because it's such little legs.  Yeah.  You couldn't run as fast.  It's one guy calling  every station that 
[03:35:30]  buys into the fugitive  because it's always  the same disguised voice.  I don't know.  Do you think Scream  was the first place  to really publicize  that voice?  Like the fact  that you could call  with a voice changer?  Or was there  voice changer stuff  before that?  No,  but you would find it  in like spy movies  or like,  remember like Hackers  and things like that?  Like Charles in Charge  where Buddy  tried to disguise him.  I think Charles in Charge  is what you said,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah,  I don't know. 
[03:36:00]  I don't know.  But I would love to know  when the fugitive  first began  his crime spree.  And this,  by the way,  is not the fugitive.  It's the Power 90 thief  that we were talking  about today.  Chris in Philly.  Hey,  Amy.  How you doing,  buddy?  What'd you learn?  These online sex perverts  are sending faxes  to the radio station.  I don't know  who they are.  Of Bobo's penis.  And I don't know  where they got the picture,  but they're going at it.  You know?  So the fugitive  is maybe sending pictures 
[03:36:30]  of Bobo's penis  to the radio station.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  And it's not a sixer.  It's very small.  Yeah,  no,  it is.  It's very small.  If they were looking  for a two,  then maybe  that would have sufficed.  But no,  a six is what  they're looking for.  And it's certainly,  I've seen it in person,  not a six.  Did you learn anything  today, Roland?  Yeah,  I learned I'm never  going to go in that  food truck again  yesterday.  Okay,  well,  that has nothing  to do with today's show.  Well,  I overslept,  so that's all I learned.  Okay,  so you went,  and I wanted to ask, 
[03:37:00]  weren't you invited  to the party last night?  I was.  Oh,  yeah,  Tom Pop is a big soiree.  I was hugging  my porcelain bowl.  Oh,  right,  right.  What happened?  So you went to a food truck?  Yeah,  I was eating,  and Eric walked in  and said,  it smelled like garbage.  It smelled like a diaper.  And then,  within a couple minutes,  Travis had to come out  of his office  to smell our office,  and he said,  this smells like shit.  In New York,  food trucks are a thing.  I mean,  you guys know,  they make TV shows  out of it now.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  What'd you order?  What'd you get?  It's like a pickled cabbage  and other hot stuff.  It's good.  If it's done right.  Was it done right?  I thought it was,  I didn't eat it all,  but as I,  after I left the subway  walking home,  I was like,  why am I sweating so much?  Uh-huh.  And then it felt like  I was drunk.  I'm like,  oh boy.  So you felt drunk  and sweaty?  Yeah,  it just felt like  the things were moving  the faster place, 
[03:38:00]  the slower,  and then I was feeling  like shit.  And then what happened?  Then you shit.  No,  I couldn't stop vomiting.  You threw up  because of the food?  I threw up  like it was no tomorrow.  Then at the end of the night  I was throwing up nothing  because there was  nothing left in my stomach.  When you throw up,  do you look at that  like,  oh,  poor wasted food?  Like we look at  like a child dying  or something  and it's just a wasted life?  Do you look at that  vomit in the toilet bowl  like,  oh,  you had such a wonderful  home in my stomach.  Why would this happen?  That's an asshole comment.  But yes,  I do. 
[03:38:30]  I do.  I was like,  there goes Tim Box.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  So are you going to eat  from that food truck again?  You had food poisoning.  It stopped you  from going to Tom Papa's party.  Yeah,  literally,  I just sat in the bathroom  all night long.  Tom Papa was counting on you  to help him  with some of the cheese platters  and hors d'oeuvres.  I know,  I felt like I let him down.  I felt really bad.  Yeah,  especially because you were  walking around here bragging.  Roland was,  I swear to God,  Roland was in his office  yelling across the hall 
[03:39:00]  to the people who work  on the comedy channel.  Hey!  Hey,  guys!  And they'd like,  like,  look over their desk.  Like,  hey,  what's up,  Roland?  Hey!  Did you guys get invited  to Tom Papa's party?  They go,  what?  What are you talking about?  Oh,  Tom Papa's party.  He's having a party.  Did you guys get invited?  Oh,  I didn't know he was having a party.  I guess not.  I guess I won't see you there.  I got invited.  Just like, 
[03:39:30]  you asshole.  And that's karma.  You deserve.  Karma kicked me in the balls  and smacked me in the ass.  Yeah.  You deserve the dick in the ass  that the food truck gave you.  Yeah,  it was pretty bad.  You deserve everything.  Wow.  So a horrible person.  Don in Texas.  Hey,  Sam.  Hey,  was it,  uh,  I'm not sure which came out first,  Screamer,  uh,  Super Troopers.  Didn't they use one of those things  in Super Troopers?  Yeah,  but I think Scream  probably came out first,  right?  Super Troopers was probably  around like 2000, 
[03:40:00]  wasn't it?  Yeah,  I thought Scream was like 90s.  Yeah,  yeah.  Okay,  my bad.  That's all right.  Chucky,  Chucky in Manhattan,  what did you learn?  Yo,  Sammy.  What up?  I learned that even with that  broken half English,  half Spanish,  they should be equally suicidal  for that bit down there.  Amazing.  It's amazing that people  are still doing it,  is it not?  And I found,  and I found their six.  You did,  you found six.  I found it.  Chucky,  do you have,  do you have Power 90s six?  I have Power 90s six. 
[03:40:30]  It is my fist,  the five digits of my fist  across the face  of the guy on the air,  and it should be  a different part of my body  being the one thing  across the face  of the female.  Maybe your dick.  And that,  and that is the six  they're looking for.  It is found.  All right,  thank you,  Chucky.  You definitely,  maybe,  maybe deliver it.  All right,  I will.  I'll try to get down there.  Thank you,  I'll talk to you later.  It's amazing.  E-Rock,  when you were a kid  going through your,  your radio tape trading days,  were people doing  the fugitive bit back then? 
[03:41:00]  No.  That's something that happened,  I think,  in the last four years.  It started,  a couple years ago  during Jocktober,  we noticed that our old station,  it used to be K-Rock  and became 92.3 now.  We were like,  what?  They're doing some stupid bit  where a fugitive says  that they stole $10,000.  And when they did this bit,  everybody on this show  was going like,  this is the stupidest thing  I've ever heard of.  I can't believe they're doing this.  We were all dumbfounded.  None of us had heard  of anything like this before. 
[03:41:30]  And then a little research,  and we find out  it's going on  across the country.  Every radio show  is doing this fugitive bit.  They buy into the,  to the fugitive package.  I like my idea  that somebody comes in here  one day with a mask on,  and they duct tape,  they hogtie Eric.  No pun intended.  They hogtie E-Rock.  Fuck you.  By his,  by his,  by,  that's not going to get me  defriended, is it?  You're close.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm going to report you.  You know that,  you know that bothers me. 
[03:42:00]  What did you say, Roland?  Slobo.  Roland's still doing  the Slobo thing.  Roland's getting blocked.  But what they do is,  they come in,  they hogtie you,  right?  And then they run off with you.  And then we do this whole thing.  Somebody has kidnapped  our E-Rock.  And then they'll go,  well, the Pope's leaving tomorrow.  Yeah.  Move on to the next thing.  Yeah.  Lose interest in our hurry.  And then actually,  somebody actually does  kidnap Eric.  We're like, uh.  Then we're like,  well, whatever.  We weren't going to really. 
[03:42:30]  He has a mask on.  Yeah.  We hadn't figured out  the end of this bit anyway,  so let him have him.  Like most of our stuff,  we just kind of let it fizzle out.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good beginning.  It's like a Vince Russo bit.  Josh in Massachusetts.  Hey, Sammy.  I know where the six is.  Where is it?  It's on Opie's Sudoku puzzle.  Very good.  Josh in Massachusetts,  you just won Opie's Sudoku puzzle.  Today,  he completed it.  I believe that  Colin Quinn's phone call  probably helped Opie  complete his Sudoku today. 
[03:43:00]  Nice.  All right,  so I'm going to put you  on hold, Josh.  You just won  the Sudoku puzzle.  That wasn't,  I loved Colin Quinn's call today,  his, I guess,  argument with Jim Norton.  I guess I love conflict,  so that helps.  I didn't find it  to be uncomfortable.  It didn't get uncomfortable for me.  It was just very real.  It wasn't,  it definitely wasn't  at home.  You know,  like you don't really hear  that often.  But I love that  Colin Quinn realized 
[03:43:30]  that there was a problem.  He was like,  fuck!  And he called up the radio.  Well, he called me,  then he called you.  He called you first?  For the number.  Give me the hotline, Roland.  Yeah,  because I was,  where are you?  I'm in the bathroom.  What?  Just give me the number.  And he called in,  I don't know if you heard it,  obviously you were in the bathroom.  No, I was in the bathroom.  But he called in,  and he was like,  and he called out Jim  for unfollowing him on Twitter,  and Jim had to explain  the whole story to him.  But it was great.  And then,  and then Nick DiPaolo  called in.  He called me  when I was in line  for Dunkin' Donuts. 
[03:44:00]  Because I guess  everybody was making  these connections  at Tom Papa's  networking party last night.  Yeah.  Roland came in,  and he just peeped in  and goes,  what's going on?  Why does everyone  want the hotline?  I thought there was  a big fight going on.  Yeah, I was like,  I don't know.  And you,  because you'd just been shitting.  I was shitting and vomiting.  You were even vomiting  this morning?  Yeah, the last part of it  just came out.  I would imagine  that your vomiting  and shitting  is so much worse  than most people's.  Of course.  Like, the things  that happen inside  your body 
[03:44:30]  have to be much more  disgusting than any  of us are used to.  It's a pagan temple.  It's a pagan temple.  You know what's  interesting about  the way Roland eats?  He eats stuff  that I know he likes,  but he knows full well  the effects of some  of the foods  that he gets.  Yeah, but you do too.  You used to,  your wife calls it  the pizza problem.  Okay?  You still love pizza.  No, but that's been  long corrected.  How has it been corrected?  Because I found out  what was going on  with my stomach.  What was it?  There was some issues 
[03:45:00]  with my intestines  and I had to take care of.  It was full  and you kept eating.  That was,  what do you mean,  did you have surgery?  What do you mean  there was issues?  No, I got some stuff,  there was something  with bacteria and everything.  Was it diverticulitis  like Brock Lesnar?  No.  There's bacteria  in your intestines?  There wasn't enough  of the good bacteria  in there,  so I take some pills  every day  and it's been fixed.  Does it help clear the shit?  Was that the problem?  There was just so much shit  all packed in there?  No, the shit wasn't the problem.  It was just me digesting  was a problem. 
[03:45:30]  What stopped you  from digesting?  What was it too much of?  Was it too much sandwiches?  Too much bread?  Well, the main problem  was that we couldn't  recreate it every time.  Even though there was  things I would eat  and I know that would  cause problems with me.  Pizza problems.  Pizza being one of them,  but then at certain times  you try to recreate it  just so you could,  you know,  document it  and give it to the doctor.  Look, if I eat this,  this is what happens.  Sorry, babe.  I gotta have another slice.  We're trying to recreate  the problem.  Sorry.  Yeah, no,  I need a second helping. 
[03:46:00]  The first time I had a problem,  I had seconds.  Yes, I need dessert.  We're recreating it.  You loved recreating.  I don't know.  It didn't happen.  We gotta do it again.  We gotta recreate this again.  Baby, look,  I want what's good  for my health  as much as you do.  We're gonna have to go back  to Johnny Rockets.  So we gotta go back.  Is that how it went down?  No, Johnny Rockets sucks.  Yeah.  I hate Johnny Rockets.  Why?  It's just disgusting.  The food's not good.  We'd never step in the food.  That's gonna be insulting. 
[03:46:30]  I think E-Rock would step in.  I don't think so.  Would step into  just about any place  that served food.  No.  If you were hungry enough,  let's say you had skipped breakfast  and you were that hungry.  I wouldn't, no.  E-Rock would eat a child  if you skipped a meal.  Well, it depends on what sauce.  Yeah, of course.  It depends on how they're marinated, right?  Yes.  So you had bacteria  in your intestines.  Yeah, I was having  a bacteria problem  in my intestines.  Was it from all the  fucking powders  that you drink every morning?  No. 
[03:47:00]  What was it from?  They weren't 100% sure.  They ruled a lot of stuff out.  But they were like,  this list of what you consume  is so grotesquely long  and we can't go through it.  There are volumes.  It's not grotesquely long.  We asked you  to make a list  of the foods that you ate  and you gave us  an Encyclopedia Britannica.  It's ridiculous.  We don't have time  to go through this entire list, Eric.  And you were like...  Sam, you're over-exaggerated.  Am I?  Yeah, just a little.  It wasn't that kid  from the Encyclopedia Britannica commercials 
[03:47:30]  with the blonde hair  and those little glasses?  I had a report due on space.  So I looked up  E-Rock's food list.  Show me the number.  Did you ever eat  the space ice cream?  The freeze-dried ice cream?  Yeah, of course.  I tried it at Kennedy Center, yeah.  It's delicious, right?  You still have it  at the National History Museum.  It's probably the same stuff.  Probably.  You had one shipment of it  in 1982.  So good.  So now you take pills  to correct your intestines?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And everything washes through.  Now you can enjoy 
[03:48:00]  all the pizza you want?  I've really cut that down.  as far as cheese goes.  Why?  Just because I thought  I had maybe a lactose issue,  but they said  it's not really  showing signs  of being lactose intolerant,  but I just cut it down anyway.  The problem is  you're eating literally  10 pounds of this  in a single sitting.  It's not a lactose.  10 pounds of anything  in one sitting  is far too much.  That's a bit much.  It is, right?  I'm exaggerating again.  You are.  I'm sorry.  Maybe eight. 
[03:48:30]  Let's go to Lady Trucker.  What's up, Lady Trucker?  Hey, E-Rock's got  the intestines of a chick.  Whoa.  Do you eat that egg tibia now  like Jamie Lee Curtis?  Did you hear that?  E-Rock, Lady Trucker  says you have  the intestines of a woman.  And she's got  the body of a hippo.  Look there.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Lady Trucker.  Picture her intestines.  She just sits there  and digests  and shit all day.  Oh, oh.  Do you eat shit?  12, 16-hour trips.  Oh.  Do you eat your own shit,  Lady Trucker?  She's lugging corn feed. 
[03:49:00]  Corn feed.  Do you have to say  a tibia key lime  is delicious?  Okay.  Troy, you have any  experience with  a tibia key lime?  No.  All that fake sugar shit  makes me have diarrhea.  Well, a tibia is  the yogurt  that makes you shit.  Yeah, whatever that stuff is,  it just falls out.  Well, yeah,  you're not supposed to eat it  unless you're actually  having problems shitting.  But I like the flavor.  I like the way it tastes.  Because the way you buy it,  you go, 
[03:49:30]  a tibia.  So, Lady Trucker,  is that your feelings hurt?  I don't get my feelings hurt.  E-Rock makes me look thin, so.  No!  E-Rock,  you know what that means,  E-Rock.  You are much fatter than her.  I could hear her chair crying.  Oh, man.  Lady Trucker,  you're getting picked on  by the two fat guys.  That's rough.  She has to get out of the truck  so her truck passed  the weight limit inspection  on the highway.  Oh, my God!  Look at that.  Is that true,  Lady Trucker? 
[03:50:00]  No,  E-Rock's so fat  that Roland orbits  around him.  Roland orbits  around E-Rock.  I like the one  that you get  to get out of your truck  better,  Lady.  She's your oil dipstick  for a dildo.  Okay,  well,  that's just,  like,  disgusting.  Do you do that,  though,  Lady Trucker?  Do you use the oil dipstick  instead of a dildo?  Are you that,  like,  into the trucking scene?  Well,  you know,  if it was girthy,  I have a size queen.  That would be interesting,  but it's not girthy enough.  Not girthy enough, 
[03:50:30]  Roland.  I saw Ice Road Truckers.  They have big ones.  All right,  thank you,  Lady Trucker.  She loves it.  She loves every minute of it.  Rick in Brooklyn.  Hey,  first of all,  I gotta say something  about Lady Trucker.  Say something.  Have you ever seen  a Michelin man cry before?  No.  Yeah,  just go look at her truck.  All those 18 wheels  are just fucking crying.  Okay,  go.  And those 18 wheels  are used to supporting,  literally,  the weight of a truck. 
[03:51:00]  Hey,  hey,  Sam,  not that kind of weight,  though.  No.  Not that kind of weight.  Hey, Eric,  I have the same problem  as you,  bud.  My body uses...  You love food.  Very fat.  No, no, no.  It doesn't exercise.  I don't know about food  or anything like that.  Spends all his money  on Legos.  My good bacteria  in my body,  it gets depleted,  I guess you could say,  and the bad bacteria  takes over.  And it's a motherfucker  because your fucking intestines  just go through  fucking shit and hell. 
[03:51:30]  Literally shit.  Literally.  Sam,  there was a time  that I fucking shit  like 20 times in a day  with just fucking shit blood  because I had  no good bacteria.  Because it didn't...  So the problem is  it didn't have enough bacteria?  Not enough.  Eric,  I don't know if your doctor  told you this,  but you gotta eat a lot of...  Like,  I hate bacteria  because it fucks with my stomach,  but it's good for you.  Can I...  Probiotics.  My doctor said mylanta.  No, 
[03:52:00]  your doctor's an idiot.  It's just a catchphrase.  I don't have intestinal problems.  I guarantee all these problems  are if they had a decent diet  and did a little bit of exercise,  they wouldn't have any problems.  A lot of the problems go away,  huh?  Yeah.  You think so?  It's just like one of those things.  It's like you don't want to do  the main thing,  which would be exercise.  Oh, yeah.  You get a little healthy.  So you do,  you know,  you develop this,  you develop diabetes,  and you have to start taking this  and taking that  instead of just,  you know,  watching what you eat  and exercising.  You exercised  and had a good diet  for three days.  Do you think that's the case?  Well, 
[03:52:30]  I know, Sam.  During a Cuban sandwich,  we were very,  very happy.  Oh,  I heard about this.  Eric and Troy went out  on Friday,  and it was another  one of Troy's,  I'm going to be...  You said Eric.  Oh,  I'm sorry,  Roland.  Roland and Troy went out  on Friday,  and they had some fun,  and then they went to  go eat.  And it was another  one of Troy's,  all verging on  eating disorder,  I'm going to binge,  and then  extreme exercise tomorrow. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  That's what you do,  right?  Yeah.  Okay,  and that does verge  on like high school  girl eating disorder  territory.  No.  You don't think so?  Yeah,  how far away is that  from shoving your finger  down your throat?  We only had one meal  that day.  That was the meal.  Okay.  First of all,  it's meal,  not mill.  And second of all...  One meal.  Second of all,  I heard about this  meal of yours,  Roland,  because Roland will  always come to you,  and I think he's just  trying to make himself  better,  and he...  Feel better.  And he says,  well,  this was my one meal 
[03:53:30]  of the day.  That's it.  Troy told me,  I went to Troy's  get-together on Saturday,  he had a little party,  a shindig at his house.  Yeah.  In his apartment.  And he told me  what your meal was.  Yeah.  Your one meal of the day  is literally a week's  worth of food.  It's a sample.  Sample one plus three,  sample this,  sample that.  You love this sample.  He ate all of it.  Tell me what,  Troy...  I need all the quesadilla.  Now that...  He had one little  quesadilla left.  Tell him...  And he said that  the guacamole was a little too... 
[03:54:00]  What did you say?  It was like a little too...  Oh, no, it was good.  It's just I didn't want it.  I had to save room  for the other stuff.  You tell me, Troy.  Yeah.  Explain Roland's meal to me.  This was just his one meal.  Well, in his defense,  we do go to different places  that the food is so goddamn good.  Look, I'm not saying  food doesn't taste good.  And I order for the table, too.  He's like, you can have one.  And you eat for the table as well.  Roland's very generous.  He'll say, look,  I'll get enough.  Have some of mine.  And we went to...  We love this Cuban spot  now on the Lower East Side  called Cafe Habana. 
[03:54:30]  And it's just  the fucking best Cuban food.  Tell me what Roland ordered.  What did Roland eat?  We started with  grilled corn on the cob.  Okay, how many?  Well, we both had one.  Okay, that's fair.  Vegetable.  Then you had quesadillas.  Yeah, I did one.  Two slices.  An order.  You had an order.  No, there was like five  and I had one.  I had two.  Look, we're going to say quesadillas  and leave it at that.  Okay.  So we got corn and quesadillas.  That's a meal.  Yeah, then he had a Cuban sandwich.  Yeah.  A big, a giant Cuban sandwich.  With French fries.  No French fries. 
[03:55:00]  I didn't eat them.  But they were on your plate.  Yeah, I didn't.  Okay.  Do you think that's true?  Yeah, I did.  I've had a couple.  Yeah, I did.  He helped himself to feel.  Well, I mean, they're there.  That's a side.  You got to have a side dish.  Sure.  And then what was the other one you had?  We had, we, I had one of the steak enchilada.  Steak enchilada with beans and rice.  And a margarita.  You had a steak enchilada with beans and rice.  Margarita.  They're all little small.  Cuban sandwich with fries.  Quesadillas.  And what was the first thing?  Corn on the cob.  And corn on the cob.  Corn on the cob. 
[03:55:30]  Did you have some dessert?  No.  Yes, we did.  Yes, okay.  All right.  Thank you for being honest with me, Troy.  I forgot.  And the small.  He did.  Yeah, we went to, I found a really good ice cream sandwich place in the Lower East Side.  And he did have a small one.  Yeah.  Oh, you only ordered a small?  Yeah.  Small ice cream.  No wonder you look so slim.  I know.  Steve in California.  Delights.  This is like deja vu.  Didn't we just have this discussion last week?  Dude, it's happening.  It's like the exact same discussion.  Yes.  It's happening all the time.  What's Troy doing next? 
[03:56:00]  Go get apple pie?  Is that what they did when we shared a dessert?  No.  That was last week.  Banana.  What was it?  Banana.  Banana Fosters.  I'm just telling you.  It's such a weird relationship that's forming because Troy binge eats and then does way over  the top exercising.  And Roland does half of that.  And it happens every, how many days?  I'd probably say every, once a week.  Once a week.  We do brunch.  And then the girl from this place, Sons of Essex, was asking, I saw her the other night. 
[03:56:30]  She's like, when are you and Roland coming back?  Oh, because they love you.  They do.  You order half the menu.  I go, boom.  Here's what I want.  I go, flinch.  I toss my card.  I go, boom.  There it is.  You know it's not good for you, right?  Whatever.  Whatever.  It tastes good.  Hey, I go, here's what I want.  And then they go, are you sure?  Just tell the waitress.  You'll be taken care of.  Just write this down.  Let's talk to a fine lady.  Let's talk to Courtney.  What's up, Courtney?  What's happening?  Hi, how are you guys?  Oh, good now that you're here.  Oh, well, thank you very much.  I actually want to tell you guys that if you're buying Activia, you're just wasting your money. 
[03:57:00]  Why do you say that?  You have problems shitting, Courtney?  Tell me.  Talk to me.  None at all.  Good.  But I'm actually, I'm a biomedical scientist.  I'm getting my master's.  And what are you doing listening to this show?  It's like you're a girl and you're smart?  Yeah.  Wow.  You guys roped me in, I guess.  Fantastic.  But it's like a nomenclature thing, but they actually made up the name of the bacteria and put it on their label. 
[03:57:30]  It's not actually have any more bacteria than regular yogurt.  And they actually got sued, but damage is already done.  And people already think that it's a huge company and it's a great product.  And it's the same exact thing as yogurt.  Fucking Jamie Lee Curtis.  Yep.  That's fun to say, though.  Activia.  It's a great jingle.  Thank you, Courtney.  You're welcome.  Brian in Texas.  Hey, what's going on, Mr. Sam?  How are you doing, Brian?  Hey, I'm going to ask E-Rod.  Does he drink a lot of those single-flavored drinks that you just pour in the water? 
[03:58:00]  Does he?  Yeah.  He's keeping them in business.  Eric needs a treat.  We've gotten over this, but he needs a little taste.  He can't just have a bottle of water.  He needs a little something to excite the taste buds.  Oh, my God.  He's showing me in the monitor.  He's got a spice drawer.  He's got a whole drawer full of stuff.  He's got a spice drawer full of powders to pour into his water.  These aren't powders.  These are liquid.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's probably much better then. 
[03:58:30]  Well, the powdered ones have ingredients in them which cause massive diarrhea and everything else like that.  He drinks a whole bunch of them.  So if he's got it flying out the old shittery, then that's probably where it's coming from.  Is it flying out the shittery now, Eric?  Not since I got on those pills, no.  Oh, good.  So you can still enjoy your synthetic powdered drinks as long as you can take your pills for it, too.  Yeah.  All right, great.  Why not?  Just shove it all in.  When there's complications down the road, you can't say you weren't completely warned.  No shit.  You know, you're warning Roland of all the complications and then taking him out to eat. 
[03:59:00]  Wait, on Wednesday, I showed Sam a great chicken place to eat at.  And then he goes, oh, let's go.  Roland's an adult.  He knows what he's doing.  All right.  Do I not also encourage you to get a bike, to exercise?  And didn't I show you pictures of you last summer?  I was like, dude, look how good you look.  You should get back to this point.  Those suggestions, though, Roland, are not as good as let's go out for Cuban sandwiches, are they?  Why don't we all talk about this when we go to that fried chicken place tomorrow?  We're going tomorrow?  And it's not my responsibility to monitor his food intake. 
[03:59:30]  He's an adult.  He knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  You love it.  If there's good food out there.  You'd like to consume it.  I will fucking find you.  And I love eating, so fuck it.  I'll exercise.  I'm going on a cruise.  I'm going to fucking pig the fuck out.  Are you worried about the cruise?  No.  Not at all?  No.  There's a possibility that shit could be in your room.  Or you'll get stuck.  Believe me, I'm going on a carnival.  They're not going to let anything fuck up again.  You're convinced.  That's why I talked to your girlfriend.  Before, we were going to talk about this yesterday, but Wendy from Reno 911 and Bridesmaids came in. 
[04:00:00]  She was good, too.  She gave me a vibe that she was a little fed up with the industry, but I liked her.  She seemed honest to me.  She's a good lady.  Um, you're convinced, you and your girlfriend, that you're going to go on this carnival cruise.  They fucked up before.  Yeah.  It's not going to happen again.  And so they're going to be on their game to the upteenth level.  Should we have them call in tomorrow so Troy can talk to them?  Maybe.  Who?  Carnival cruise?  Yes.  What are they going to be like?  I mean, no.  Because they're going to just be like, oh, we're great. 
[04:00:30]  You know, why would they call into a radio show and be like, yeah, there's a good chance that we're going to fuck this whole thing up.  Or do you get free upgrades?  Yeah, it's not going to happen.  Yeah, no.  And then you're not going to use my show just as a stomping around to get free upgrades.  You already, I'm sure, got free Cuban sandwiches out of the deal that you just did.  That's not true.  He did pick up the bill.  He did.  He did, right?  Yeah.  Good for him, Roland.  You're a good guy.  Well, you've got to save money somewhere, though, Roland.  I mean, what do you spend a lot of money on?  Food. 
[04:01:00]  But the food's got to be good.  Yeah.  So it's worth it.  If you're spending money on good food, you get your money's worth, right?  Yeah, of course.  You know what a lot of people spend a lot of money on and they're not getting their money's worth?  Porn?  No, no, no.  Shaving.  That's right, Troy.  Yeah.  Razor blades.  Yeah, it's fucking hell.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  You like to keep up a nice appearance.  You like to groom yourself.  Absolutely.  You can't use that Vite lotion on your face.  Nope.  It would just fuck it all up.  Yep.  So what do you do?  Pay a whole bunch of money for razors, right? 
[04:01:30]  No.  You don't?  No.  You used to?  Yeah.  Times are tough.  I turned a corner, though.  Have you noticed the price that people pay from your razor blades?  How much is it?  $20?  $30?  $40.  $40.  Is that in pesos?  Dollar div.  No.  You're doing it every month for the rest of your life.  Like Troy said, he had his Dollar Shave Club moment.  Now it's time for yours.  Join all the After Opie and Anthony Live listeners who've discovered DollarShaveClub.com.  Listen.  Here's what all the buzz is about. 
[04:02:00]  It's like found money.  Troy, is there anything better than putting on an old pair of pants and finding a nice,  crisp $10 bill in the back pocket?  There are, but that's nice.  That's really nice.  Yeah.  I mean, finding old pants that fit, that's even better.  You're a long way away from that, Rowan.  I know.  You know what's even better?  Finding $20.  Finding $30.  Who knows how much money you'll find in the pocket?  Well, Dollar Shave Club is genius in that way.  This is free money.  Everybody wants a great shave without shelling out $20.

It's very exciting.  Let's go to Josh in Indiana.  Do what?  Josh, you're on the air.  Hey.  I was listening to you guys, and you were talking about the shaving and using the beat.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, man, that shit works. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  My wife was shaving her legs, and I walked in the bathroom, and I was trying to tell  her that that shit ain't going to work.  It's just going to burn the hell out of you.  Yeah.  She says, here, try it.  So I put it on my neck, and it burnt the piss out of me.  And the patch of hair where I put it, it still has not grown back.  And that was about six years ago.  I got a little bald spot.  That seems scary to me.  That shouldn't be happening.  I swear, it is smooth, and the hair will not grow there. 
[04:04:00]  I got a little patch of baldness.  That doesn't sound right.  Thank you, Josh.  That doesn't sound right.  Is that what you...  Because you use lotion to shave your arm hair and stuff, right?  I don't shave.  It's just...  I mean, to get rid of it.  Yeah, you just literally put it on, and then you go in the shower.  It's like Nair.  It's the same deal.  Yeah, but it doesn't burn you.  V does.  This guy said it burned his neck, and he has had no...  He may have had Nair.  I don't know.  Maybe they've improved the formula.  That doesn't sound like an improvement.  He literally burned the follicles out of his neck.  No hair is growing there anymore.  I wish I had that problem. 
[04:04:30]  That you just burn, like, the top layer...  Like, the hair is gone.  Like, it doesn't, unfortunately, work like that for me.  No.  Well, I don't think it's supposed to work like that.  There is...  I mean, when you put it on a couple...  Like, if I put it on, and then I put it on again the next day over my nipples...  Yeah.  My nipples get burned.  Well, you don't...  Do your nipples get hairy?  I get hairy on the nipples, but I don't want to...  I'm not, like...  I just slather it on.  I don't really try to, like, paint it on...  And so you put hair remover lotion on your nipples.  Yeah, but I know that there's no hair actually on the nipples.  It just...  And then it burns the nipple? 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Because the nipple's, like, exposed.  Yeah.  Eric, you ever burn your nipples?  No.  You have big ones?  No.  Okay.  What about you?  You have big nipples?  Well, my nipples are all fucked up.  Why?  Because I got...  I had nipple rings that got ripped out.  Oh, how'd they get ripped out?  The one time I jumped in the crowd when I was in a band.  Mm-hmm.  I ripped out.  And then the other time...  I think I told the...  I may have told the story in there, but...  Maybe it was a while back.  Was it you were in a bar, and Chris Farley was looking for a missing girl, and you didn't  take him seriously, so you took his badge off his shirt and bent it, and you said, what 
[04:05:30]  are you going to do now?  And Chris Farley said, improvise, and pulled the ring right off your nipple?  No.  That wasn't you?  No.  Okay.  But I was having sex with my girlfriend at the time.  This was a couple years ago.  Not your current girlfriend.  No, no.  And she had a horseshoe barbell in her nipple, and I had a ring in my nipple, and they linked  up, and when I pulled up...  Your nipples became stuck together.  Yeah.  That's romantic.  But I didn't know.  And I picked up real quick, and it ripped it right out.  So...  What about her nipples?  Her nipples are fine. 
[04:06:00]  Oh.  Her nipple had a little piece of nipple attached to it.  No.  My ring...  It bent the ring, and there was blood everywhere.  Nipples bleed a lot?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  It looked like a fucking crime scene.  So, the romance, the minute of romance, where you two, like, your souls met, your penis  was in her vagina, and your nipples were linked up.  Yeah.  But I didn't know.  It was completely changed to just blood everywhere, and horror, and pain.  That's a boner killer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did it hurt a lot?  It hurt like a motherfucker.  Are the nipples where it hurts the most? 
[04:06:30]  To get them pierced, or get ripped out?  Ripped out.  I have...  Those are the only ones I had ripped out.  Both of them, though.  I see the balls.  But they hurt to get pierced.  Your nipples do?  Yeah.  Your both nipple rings got ripped out.  Oh, it's awful.  Why would you be in that scenario?  Has anybody ever had both of their nipple rings?  I have no idea.  And now my nipples are all fucked up, and I'm self-conscious about them.  You are?  Yeah.  Is that why you always wear shirts at work?  Well, I don't...  You're supposed to wear shirts at work.  You're not supposed to expose your nipples.  But, like, I'll wear, like, a tighter shirt, and sometimes, like, I'll look at them,  and I feel like people are staring at my nipples. 
[04:07:00]  They are.  So then I have to go in the bathroom and put Band-Aids over my nipples.  You put...  At work?  Yeah.  You put Band-Aids over your nipples?  Well, I want you to know something.  What?  The other day, I was walking around here, and I was talking to DJ Who Kid.  Uh.  And he said this to me.  He said, yo, Sam.  And I was like, oh, hey, DJ Who Kid.  And he said, what's up with that nigga Troy's nipples?  And I was like, oh, jeez, he's self-conscious about them.  And then I was talking to Eric, E-Rock.  And we're leaving the studio.  And he goes, did you notice Troy's nipples today? 
[04:07:30]  And I was like, Who Kid just mentioned him?  Nicole was down there.  And she goes, hey, what's up with your nipply friend?  And I was like, are you talking about Troy?  So everybody's noticed.  No, I know.  And I feel like everybody stares at him.  I mean, it's the same deal as Kenny escorting Opie and Anthony to the bathroom.  Yeah.  How everybody was talking about them, but they didn't know.  Yeah.  Everybody here.  No, I feel it.  Like, when you leave, Roland makes Troy nipple jokes constantly.  All the time.  Everybody's noticed.  I feel like a girl, though.  I know why girls get self-conscious about guys always looking down their tits. 
[04:08:00]  Because I feel like that's what everybody does to me.  Yeah, but it's a different deal.  Guys don't make fun of their tits.  They're like, I'd like to suck those.  Yeah, but mine stick out and they're like, why are his nipples so erect?  All the time.  Yeah.  He's just really excited to be here.  He loves his job.  I can't do anything because there's scar tissue all over him.  And that's where they pop out.  Yes.  Yeah, I understand.  If I could have them removed, I would.  You would have your nipples removed.  I would have them shaved down.  Why didn't you get that done when you got your nose job?  Because they don't work on nipples. 
[04:08:30]  They don't?  No.  You could probably get a nipple job.  No, not the nose doctor.  That's all the same shit.  No, it's not.  You don't think so?  Nose, nipples, no.  It's two different things.  All right.  Well, listen.  I could talk about nipples all day long.  You know I could, Troy.  Maybe we'll extend this conversation after the after show.  Because I love nipples and talking about them.  But we do have to go.  Can I mention some real quick?  Yes, you can.  March 23rd, I'll be in Redding, Pennsylvania, Building 24, playing with White Noise.  It's guys from the Bloodhound Gang.  It's their new project.  Oh, that's very exciting.  So I'll be DJing in Redding, Pennsylvania. 
[04:09:00]  Troyquan.com for all the info.  E-Rock loves the Bloodhound Gang.  I know.  He only stopped wearing his Bloodhound Gang t-shirt like two weeks ago.  And he's got a real rare Bloodhound Gang shirt, I think.  Yeah.  He loves it.  He loves it.  Listen.  We'll be back, I guess, on Thursday.  So stay tuned for that.  Ron and Fez are up next.  So that's a lot less time to wait.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
