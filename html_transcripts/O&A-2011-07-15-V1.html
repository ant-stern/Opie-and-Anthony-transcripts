<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with lighthearted banter about a Mets game and the British Open, including commentary on golfers like Tom Watson and an amateur player.  The conversation then shifted to a discussion of men wearing pink in corporate settings.  The bulk of the show focused on a prank involving comedian Bob Kelly, where Opie and Anthony, aided by Joe DeRosa and a phone call from Jim Norton (calling from L.A.), used Kelly's wife to gain access to his apartment and attempt to film him in a compromising situation.  The hosts provided a detailed, sexually explicit recounting of the prank's execution, highlighting DeRosa's perceived incompetence and Kelly's quick thinking in minimizing incriminating evidence.  They repeatedly made crude jokes about the resulting video, which was mentioned as being available online.  Norton then detailed his experiences at the ESPY Awards, mentioning interactions with Don Rickles and Bristol Palin, along with celebrity encounters on a flight (including Al Sharpton and Sally Field).  The conversation returned to the Bob Kelly prank, with further speculation on Kelly's personality and habits.

The show continued with a discussion about the treatment of child rapists and murderers in prison, followed by a discussion of Louis C.K.'s Emmy nominations, featuring a guest, Jimmy.  The hosts then discussed a convicted murderer's online karaoke performances, mentioning songs like "If I Never See Your Face Again" and "Bring Me to Life."  The anticipated arrival of Bobo was mentioned, but he was late.  A newspaper photo of Helen Mirren in a bikini sparked a lengthy and sexually explicit discussion about her attractiveness, aging, and body, leading to comparisons with Megan Fox and critiques of "sexiest woman alive" lists.  Their personal bowling experiences, work-related disagreements with their company, and an off-air email exchange with Bobo were also discussed. Bobo eventually called in, his late arrival being a topic of conversation.  Further discussions included their unsuccessful attempt to get KFC, donuts, cupcakes, and a U2 concert, featuring a humorous anecdote about hoping a friend at the concert would be attacked.  The hosts detailed U2's stage production, financial success, tax strategies, comparing them to The Beatles, and reminisced about their Madison Square Garden concert after 9/11, repeatedly discussing U2’s financial success and tax avoidance strategies, eventually mentioning Johnny Cash’s U2 covers and a listener's comment, ending with a humorous moment referencing a song with altered lyrics.

A significant portion of the show involved a comedic, vulgar roasting of a man named Kenny, focusing on his obsession with numbers, neatness, limited social skills, diet, sleep apnea, and invoicing practices, often punctuated by "la la la" interjections.  An unexpected visit from former show contributor Patty led to a bizarre and sexually charged interaction, involving repeated requests from the hosts for her to touch or kiss Jimmy’s penis through his sweatpants, which she repeatedly refused.  The exchange included insults, accusations of drug use, and uncomfortable sexual innuendo. Bobo’s willingness to perform the requested act was contrasted with Patty's refusal.  The conversation shifted to Patty's personal life, family dynamics, and outspoken views on news stories, earning her the moniker "Stalker Patty."  David from Israel, described as having a distinctive "Jew voice" and working as a software engineer, made a brief appearance. The segment concluded with further discussion of Patty's unusual behavior, including a physical altercation with Jimmy's penis.

The show continued with a series of female guests, including Patty, who was repeatedly pressured into suggestive acts, such as performing a lap dance for Bobo.  Her discomfort was contrasted with the hosts' persistent encouragement. Bree, wearing a revealing top, was subjected to questions about her physical attributes, prompting detailed descriptions from the hosts and guests, while Patty's discomfort remained apparent.  Adrian was also a guest. A sommelier and other male guests were also present, participating in sexually charged conversations.  Bobo’s entrance, wearing unusual underwear, further escalated the explicit content.  The hosts focused on Bobo’s underwear and encouraged him to graphically describe sexual acts with Bree. The segment ended with continued ribbing of Patty and jokes about the day’s events.  The overall tone was characterized by crude humor, sexual innuendo, and an uncomfortable dynamic between the hosts and Patty.

The show's final segment featured the "Chair of Honor" competition, with Bobo as a central figure. His attempts to win involved air humping in "Euro fucking underpants," resulting in visible pre-cum, leading to ribbing from the hosts and participants. Patty's repeated refusal to touch Bobo's penis, despite previously touching another man's penis on the show, was discussed at length, using sexually explicit language.  Other participants were subjected to crude evaluations by Jimmy.  Bobo lost the competition.  An extended discussion followed concerning a lost Mets ticket, involving accusations, a wrong number phone call, and the eventual destruction of the ticket.  The show concluded with Bobo still without a ticket and post-show discussion of the day’s events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, by the way, for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  So I guess I'm going to this Mets game with Bobo tomorrow.  Are you really?  He just saw the look.  I was like, are you really?  And the face said it all.  By the way.  By the way.  I got an upgrade of the ticket.  It's one seat down and one over. 
[00:00:30]  By the way.  By the way, for the show.  I don't know.  I really think I got something to do in Philly tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Family stuff.  Yeah, I do too.  I do too.  You got family stuff?  In Philly.  In Philly?  Why, is he trying to get you to go now?  No, but of course he would want anybody but for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  I'm going to be a little distracted today because the British Open is on live.  I see that.  A little known fact, I really like watching golf, especially the majors.  It's so early. 
[00:01:00]  And good old Tom Watson just had a hole in one.  That was a good one.  Took a little bounce, went in.  One bounce.  One little bounce.  Nice.  Went in.  And then there's some kid.  He's an amateur.  Fucking amateur.  And he shot a 65 yesterday.  Yeah?  The lowest score for an amateur at the British Open since something happened over there.  I once shot an elephant in my pajamas.  How it got in my pajamas, I'll never know.  Oh, God.  That was Groucho? 
[00:01:30]  That was Groucho?  Yes.  He told me that right before he signed my paper and dropped dead.  What a hack.  Groucho was a hack.  Groucho was, but it was the time of hackdom.  Well, that's the funny part about it.  He wasn't a hack at the time.  No, the time.  That was great comedy.  That time would fuck you up and make you a hack.  Look at some stuff that's long gone now, and now it's hacky.  It's all hack.  But at the time, it wasn't hack.  No.  Now Tom Watson just did another thing.  A thing close to the thing?  Yeah, he's got another close thing that just happened. 
[00:02:00]  He put his little round thing next to the thing.  And then the thing happened.  I don't get guys that wear pink, man.  I got to say it right off the bat.  It's a power color.  Well, that's what they try to tell everybody else.  Yeah, it shows that you're confident with your masculinity.  Yeah, I think it shows that you're open to some possibilities.  Like something.  Maybe a golf ball or two.  A club handle.  I think it might be some kind of secret code that, look, I'm just saying I'm open to some  possibilities.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  If you're wearing pink and I'm wearing pink and no one's around.  Danny, I'll see you over by the tables.  Yeah.  I don't understand why the corporate douches decided pink is the power color.  It was probably just one douche guy.  One corporate douche guy came in one day.  Everyone started making fun of him.  And he's like, hey, dude.  Yeah.  I'm confident, man.  Yeah.  I'm confident.  Went into the meeting with the big boss.  Yeah.  Put his presentation out there.  Did a good job. 
[00:03:00]  Here's the Johnson file.  Yeah.  Well, the Penske file.  The Penske.  And then everybody was like, oh, wow, I got to start wearing pink.  Yeah.  The boss really took a liking to him.  If I wear pink, maybe the boss will think I'm him.  Well, let's find out who started the whole pink thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was some corporate douche.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Know what I hate about the British Open and then we can move on?  Yeah.  It's early.  If you know anything about golf, yeah, it's way too fucking early.  Their greens are as big as basically football fields. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, so it's easy to hit the green?  Yeah, so you could be on the green and be 50 yards away from the hole.  Wow.  What do you do there?  Do you got to...  I think I've seen guys every once in a while, they'll chip even though they're on the green.  What's that?  Oh, no.  No.  Not on the green.  You mean not use their putter?  They will use a little wedge or something?  Sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes.  Yeah?  Yeah, because the greens are really fucked up and really fucking big. 
[00:04:00]  It's really big.  Actually, I'm amazed that the weather is so nice there, but it's always windy.  Yeah.  You're always playing in the wind.  Yeah, I don't know why you would deal with that when you could live in America.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Fuck that wind shit.  It's always raining and windy.  Yeah.  And I don't know why it's so prestigious because it looks like a shithole.  It does.  A lot of weeds.  A lot of weeds.  A long, tall grass.  It looks like the beginning of a cornfield is starting to grow in.  It hasn't been kempt.  No, not at all. 
[00:04:30]  Jimmy!  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  It's Jimmy Norton.  Red-Eyed Jimmy.  Back from his L.A. adventure.  We were discussing golf.  The British Open.  The British Open is on.  Is on live right now.  Of course, golf without the L.  With no Tiger Woods.  No.  And my boy Rory McIlroy is kind of in the middle of the pack.  I was hoping he would have a better start.  Do you think maybe he'd have some momentum from the last one?  Well, I kind of like the kid.  Yeah?  Yeah, I like him.  Yeah, well.  It looks like Danny Newman. 
[00:05:00]  Noonan.  Noonan.  Noonan.  Noonan.  Noonan.  I corrected myself.  Noonan.  Noonan.  He does look like Noonan.  He looks like a cross between Danny Noonan and an angry bird.  Or the pig.  The pig and the angry bird?  Yeah.  He looks like a cross between that.  So.  Bird noises.  Hey, is there a...  Makes me want to take a dump, because I always play on the bowl.  Oh, really?  So whenever I hear it, it's like Pavlov's asshole.  I just sit here and...  I nap with my kid a lot of days after the show, and he fucking sleeps way more than 
[00:05:30]  I do, and I'm laying in bed like bored, so I'll do my angry birds in bed.  Yeah.  As the little fucker's sleeping next to me.  That's a fun little game still.  Yeah.  Is there another one?  I think there is.  What's the new one?  What's the latest one that came out?  I didn't update.  The newest one that came out.  I got all the stars and the eggs.  I need a new one.  I need a new board.  I need a new season.  They're, believe me, they're pumping them out. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  They are pumping them out.  Are they making them harder?  I think it's the same game.  I think they're adding some things in.  But I think they can make them more puzzly.  You know what I mean?  Like how?  There's a lot of just...  Some of them are pretty hard.  Nah, not really.  Nah, you know.  Some of them...  The first time you throw your birds at them, you're like, fuck, I need more birds.  Yeah.  And then, like...  There's a little strategy, but I'm talking about where you need to...  That first bird has to hit that one fucking speck on the board. 
[00:06:30]  Sometimes that's it.  Not really, man.  I don't know.  I'm waiting for that.  And I don't think they want to fuck with success, you know?  True.  If they start fucking around with it a little too much...  You know, you like figuring out puzzles, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  I think that would be cool if they threw a little more of that in there.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  And then the fact that...  Instead of having that big, black, asshole bird that knocks over everything.  Yeah.  Just everything.  That is great.  The atomic bomb bird where it goes in.  I like placing the exploding bird somewhere. 
[00:07:00]  Like, you place it.  You wait for it to fall through something.  And then you explode it.  Uh-huh.  Like, everything just fucking flies apart.  I never hit the bomb.  Oh, that's a good one.  Because I need to be challenged.  Yeah?  I never hit the bomb.  I let it blow up by itself.  Oh, no, no.  I always bang it.  Like, there it is.  It's in perfect position.  Bam!  Well, yeah, with the boomerang birds.  Fucking hate those things.  I use them as the boomerang birds probably 50% of the time. 
[00:07:30]  Nah.  The other 50, I just throw them into this shit.  Yeah, I just throw them forward.  Sometimes you have to, though.  Sometimes you gotta whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Because you gotta hit the thing from the back.  But then when you hit it to turn around and you hit it too early and then it flies over  everything, you're like, what the fuck?  That's annoying as piss, man.  It really is.  That really is.  I don't think...  You know what technology has gotten us?  Huh?  The fact that you're in the bathroom, the door is closed, and if somebody's living with  you, they hear, like, motherfucker from the bathroom.  This is shit you wouldn't hear unless you had, like, explosive diarrhea. 
[00:08:00]  You're like, ow!  Fuck!  Yeah, in the old days, that would mean blood in your schools.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it means you couldn't get your boomerang bird to hit properly.  Yeah, now you're just like, come on, fucker!  Spin!  I know what's weird, too.  Video games were developing, developing, developing, and now we all care about just basic fucking...  Little things.  Little dumb video games again.  Yeah, little games.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah, it went to the point where it was like, wow, major league graphics, fucking giant games,  very expansive environments, and to, yeah, just fucking show me a little building with 
[00:08:30]  some pigs in it, and I'll throw some birds at it.  True.  Do you play Cut the Rope?  I have played Cut the Rope.  Is it good?  That's pretty cool.  People are starting to talk about that one in my circles.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that one's been around for a little while.  No, I know, but it's fun.  Do you like it?  Yeah, you gotta, like, let the thing swing, Cut the Rope at the right time.  My brother swears by it.  He loves it.  Yeah.  And he was an Angry Birds fan, so I don't know.  I'm so distracted by the lovely Mrs. Imus with the hat. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, she's gotta...  Like, she's gotta lose the fucking cowboy hat.  Of course she has to.  Why is she wearing the cowboy hat all the time?  I understand when Imus puts it on.  Probably.  Lately, he hasn't.  He's been showing his amazing head of fucking hair that he's got there.  She probably has a lot of lumps from Imus hitting her or something.  Do you think Imus is beating her?  So she's hiding all the lumps with the cowboy hat.  Oh, damn fucking shit.  Either that or she insulted his cowboy stuff.  Like, she got sick of it one time.  She lives in a fucking penthouse in Manhattan. 
[00:09:30]  She's like, enough with the cowboy shit.  You look like an asshole.  And it really hurt his feelings.  So now she's just to show she's on board by wearing the cowboy hat.  Like, oh no, I love it.  I was kidding.  You know, I enjoy the hats and the boots and everything.  I don't know why I gotta say that.  Why you hurt me like that.  And then he...  She puts it on.  You have to overcompensate for humiliating him.  But he used to wear the cowboy hats.  Yeah.  He has no hat on.  No.  Who gives a fuck about her and him when you have that hot news broad that we're all obsessed with?  The one that's...  And Mars told me that she's Portuguese. 
[00:10:00]  Portuguese?  Mars did some research for us.  That's even better.  Good.  Portuguese.  We learned she's Portuguese.  She was on American Idol.  She could sing, obviously.  She sang yesterday on I Missed's show.  And she drank with Joe DeRosa until 4 a.m.  So that means she's open to possibilities.  Unfortunately, she's not a good job.  Not for Joe, though.  She wants a guy with shoulders.  Joe asked her out.  Who?  This girl.  Oh, you'll see.  Yeah, we'll point her out.  She's on Fox Business. 
[00:10:30]  What did you do, Red Eye with her?  Yeah.  So I guess they went out afterwards, as usual.  I was saying Fox is the biggest load of drunks.  They're all Aussies.  Fox is the drunkest network I've ever been on.  That's how Murdoch missed the fucking scandal overseas.  Yeah.  Phone tapping is loaded.  He was hammered.  That whole network is drunk.  And he was out with her until like, you know, 4 in the morning.  Yeah.  And asked her out.  And she went, no, I don't date.  It's like, oh, God.  I don't date.  I go, Joe, she doesn't date you.  Exactly. 
[00:11:00]  She didn't want you because if you make it to 4 a.m. with a girl, you're getting laid.  Yeah.  Something's happening.  Of course you are.  Something's happening.  But she's, yeah, she's very hot.  I bet you what happened was she bet her friends that she could meet a guy who looks like Carmine  Ragusa and get him to ask her out and humiliate him.  Once she won the bet, it was over.  She was probably waiting the whole time for a text message to come in and never came in.  Right.  And she was killing time with stupid.  Stupid.  I was going to say stupid.  Oh, God.  Do you think that's what he was?  Just a temporary fucking. 
[00:11:30]  Just a shill sitting there waiting.  Speaking of stupid.  And his Twitter is Joe DeRosa comedy.  Oh.  He fucked up my payback on Bob Kelly yesterday.  Stupid fucked it up.  I watched the video and, boy, it was like watching a movie that you're like, oh, this  is going to be good.  Yeah.  And then the ending doesn't pan out.  Well, we look like blundering fools.  But basically, really fast, I guess it was late last week, Bob Kelly did the show. 
[00:12:00]  Or was it this week?  I don't know.  I'm losing track of it.  It was earlier in the week.  Earlier this week.  And Jimmy was sort of involved with the big scare video, right?  I was right by.  I was there when Bob conceptualized it.  Yeah.  So Jimmy and Bob Kelly.  It was Bob's idea.  Were following me out of the building.  I did not know this.  Yeah.  Anthony knew because he didn't take off like he usually does, leaving a cartoon trail.  Oh, man.  I can't fucking leave the front of this building fast enough.  So I should have known something was up because you were kind of like mingling.  Yes.  I was sitting in my vehicle.  And then I'm walking down the sidewalk and Bob Kelly came up from behind me and scared the 
[00:12:30]  shit out of me.  Video is doing well.  And it was pretty funny, whatever.  So I said, fuck that.  Payback's going to be a bitch.  So Joe DeRosa did the show yesterday, filling in for Jimmy.  And after the show, I was walking the same way as Joe.  And we just happened.  I swear to God, because people think it's a setup.  I fucking hate people.  I really do.  I fucking hate the idiots.  Oh, they thought it was a setup.  A few people do.  And it's just like, you just shut up and go away.  You're idiots.  So I'm walking with Joe DeRosa in Bob Kelly's neighborhood. 
[00:13:00]  Jimmy knows.  And all of a sudden, we turn the corner and there's Bob Kelly's wife.  That's handy.  So we talked to her for a couple of minutes.  There she is, by the way.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Oh, shit.  Diane something.  Yeah.  They gave it to us yesterday.  Diane McCure or something like that?  I never did it with her.  I haven't either.  I haven't seen her on Red Eye.  She smoked.  I would remember that.  So I talked to Bob Kelly's wife for a couple of minutes.  And then I'm like, is Bobby home? 
[00:13:30]  Because I know we're just a few blocks away.  She goes, yeah.  I'm running errands.  I'm like, can we have the keys?  She goes, yeah.  No problem.  So we get her on video saying she allowed this.  And then I asked her a million times, do you guys own any guns?  Do you own any knives?  What's your plan if someone breaks in?  Because now we're going to open the door and scare the shit out of Bobby.  I'm going to get him back for the video that Jimmy was part of.  It's a home invasion.  Yeah.  It's a home invasion.  So she's like, nah, he's going to be sitting right in.  As soon as you open the door, he'll be right there.  It's perfect. 
[00:14:00]  Here's the keys.  Like I get hit with some cum in the face.  Right.  Have fun.  Blah, blah, blah.  So me and Joe grab the keys and we walk over there.  I set up the video and all.  And we walk in.  And now, well, whatever.  I guess I could give away.  Who gives a fuck?  Then you can see the video.  So then we're in the hallway.  And I'm thinking like any good movie, we're going to discuss our plan outside the door.  Right.  I'm thinking a good fucking, you know, buddy comedy.  We're going to discuss something.  Dude, I'll give you the scene.  Pulp Fiction.  Right before they go in to get the case.  Okay. 
[00:14:30]  Fucking, yeah.  John Travolta and fucking Jules out there talking by the door.  Yeah.  Before they go in.  Yeah.  Put your game face on.  Yeah.  Well, stupid, who has the keys.  We go in the building.  I don't know where his apartment is.  Next thing I know, we're outside his door.  And I'm thinking, okay.  I see him put something down.  So I'm thinking, okay, now we're going to discuss our plan.  Bob Kelly's right inside the door.  All of a sudden, he just does the keys loudly and bursts in with this weak, ah! 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He was too loud with the key, first of all.  Right.  So Bobby knew someone was coming in the door, so you weren't going to catch him doing anything.  And then his attention was at the door, so he instantly sees someone he knows.  Yeah.  So that didn't, like, fuck him up.  Well, I'm thinking, all right, outside the door.  He sees DeRosa.  He knows.  Maybe we could start a little commotion outside the door.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe a couple knocks or something.  You know, get his suspicion up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Work it.  Instead of loud keys, which would sound like his wife.  His wife.  Because who else has keys to his apartment?  And that's what he said.  He thought his wife was coming in.  And then Joe bursts in, and yeah, Bob's sitting there, but he has the weakest, and Bob Kelly  was sort of scared.  And the only reason he was scared, by the way, I have deciphered this, he swears he wasn't  looking at porn.  That motherfucker was already looking at porn.  He was ready to jerk off.  And if you look at the video, you could see this guy closing boxes like I've never seen  anyone closing boxes.  Click, click, click.  Look at the video again. 
[00:16:00]  He was a little scared because he goes, holy shit, they almost saw what I was looking at.  That's what I'm thinking now.  Oh, and God only knows what awful porn it is.  Oh, fat guy tranny porn.  Our whole goal was to catch him jerking off.  Yeah.  Because you know, as soon as his wife left, he was going to at some point, right?  Yeah, you might have been able to.  But that stupid Joe DeRosa fucked up my payback video.  Yeah.  So you can check it out.  I tweeted it.  It's one of my, I don't know, one of the last tweets I did. 
[00:16:30]  I was hoping to see something transpire there.  OP radio.  Well, I'm going to have to do it again now.  Wow.  So.  You were going to open the door.  I'd.  Start from.  Start from the setup a little bit.  Oh, Joe.  We'll see if this plays on the radio.  Oh, we almost got to put that shot.  And it would have been rightfully so with the evil thing that we're about to fucking  do here.  We got the keys from his wife.  We randomly ran into the door.  She gave us the keys.  Yeah.  So we could sneak in and scare the piss out. 
[00:17:00]  Joe.  I'm a little nervous.  So here's Joe.  We're going in the front of the building.  We're outside the door now.  I'm like, okay, let's, let's discuss this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then I realized I don't think we're going to discuss anything.  Hey, motherfucker.  He goes, hey, motherfucker.  Dude, you can't.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  He's going crazy.  He's going crazy. 
[00:17:30]  Your wife gave me the key.  Wait, you're a little scared.  Dude, he's going crazy shutting windows.  She did.  He is.  Why wouldn't he just sit back and leave whatever was on his computer on it?  Because there's a lot of tranny stuff over there.  Right, right, right.  What you see is.  Dude, he, if that happened to anybody else and there was nothing bad on your computer.  Yeah.  You would just go like, you'd lean back in your chair and go, you fucking assholes.  Or something.  His, his finger is going whoosh, whoosh, click, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, click, whoosh. 
[00:18:00]  Looks like his fingers are ice skating across the fucking head.  Yes.  He couldn't shut those with, and a lot of them.  He's holding his, he's holding his chest with his left hand, so that means he got scared a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, not enough to, to, for the big payback.  And then, the right hand is working like he's done this a million fucking times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had, he's had to close windows very quickly.  And then when he closed all the windows that he didn't want us to see, then he sits back.  Yeah, yeah.  And addresses the situation. 
[00:18:30]  He's not even looking at the camera, he's looking at the windows.  Look, look, look, look.  Where he can shut things.  Danny's trying to, trying to zoom in and see what the fuck it is.  Ha, ha.  Yeah.  Oh, I hope we don't out Bob Kelly by mistake.  Bob's gay.  Just some hardcore gay pornography.  He's got a big rod.  Steam ass.  Yeah, we could have maybe got some props, something.  Yeah.  We don't have to play the rest of the video.  You can check it out for yourself.  That's fucking great, Bobby.  I think it came out pretty well. 
[00:19:00]  You can, you can see it for yourself.  I'll retweet it again this morning.  Big rod.  But, uh, and then people fucking trying to make fun of Bobby's apartment.  What?  And it's like.  Bobby's got a great apartment.  A great place.  Exactly.  And I, I purposely only showed a tiny bit of his apartment because, you know, it's, it's  where he lives.  And I don't know if he wants that all over the place.  Yeah.  The place is really big and nice.  People are like, oh, you live in a shoe bar.  Without even knowing how, how big the apartment is or getting a tour of the place.  Not knowing New York City also. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  God.  That would have been great if he had one of those moments.  Doesn't anyone fucking knock anymore?  Then he explains he was really close to.  To jacking.  To jacking it.  And then he does weird shit with his dog.  And it's all in the video.  And then he's got weird art.  He starts singing with his dog.  Art on the walls.  And the dog is going.  That was funny.  I like seeing a little Bobby at home like that.  That was a, that was a funny day.  Oh, yeah.  Left click.  Left click.  Left click.  Right click. 
[00:20:00]  Up, down.  Double click.  So I can save that page.  Danny, play it from, play it from, uh, uh, the part where he's listening to his wife.  A little further in the beginning.  I'm sorry.  Oh, where you give the, um.  Yeah, try, uh, not, well, all right, yeah.  You give the camcorder to him.  Well, we taped his wife giving us the okay.  Yeah, permission.  Yeah.  You saw the video of Bobby.  Ah, that's all right.  Come on, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  A little further back from here.  There it is. 
[00:20:30]  Yes, it just started from there.  I'm going to fucking knock her out when she comes home.  She gave Joe DeRosa a set of keys to my house?  Yeah.  Hope he too.  We were really hoping that you were in the middle of jerking off because she went for a quick, uh,  errand run.  Right now, by the way, pause that.  What he's doing, he has his left hand on the back of the fucking laptop.  And he's trying to move it forward.  He's trying to move it forward.  And he's ready to slam it closed if he has to.  Right.  If he has to, Bob will just slam it closed.  You're absolutely right.  Why is your hand on the fucking computer, dude?  He minimized windows. 
[00:21:00]  He didn't close windows.  Yeah.  He wanted to get back to where he was eventually.  Yeah.  So he minimized.  Because it took a while to get where he was.  Yeah.  So he's ready to slam the laptop closed.  If he has to.  If he has to.  Because if he couldn't get them all, just go back and see him and watch his hands.  Right now, there's a nice, pristine white screen, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  There's nothing on that screen.  It's like, what, are you looking up snow on the internet?  Yeah.  He's got his desktop.  That's what you're saying.  He googled the perfect neighborhood, and that came up.  He's protecting that laptop because he might be paranoid we're going to grab it and run. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  There's a lot going on with that laptop.  Oh, my God.  You just watch his left hand go to the screen.  Yeah.  This is great.  House.  Yeah.  Hope it to.  We're really hoping that you're in the middle of jerking off because you went through it.  He's leaning forward.  He told it.  What a fucking traitor. 
[00:22:00]  That's where we're at?  So.  I guess so.  It's a shame, you know.  Just hit you over the fucking knees.  But then he panicked on me.  Honestly, God, this is where I'd be.  You would make a horrible cat burglar.  This is where I'd be.  I would be terrible at it.  No, I'd be a great cat.  No, you.  Fuck, man.  I didn't even know what you were doing.  You were probably three to eight minutes away. 
[00:22:30]  For me, honestly.  Yeah.  Fucking.  I'd have my cock out here and some type of awful.  It would have been awful.  Can we pause this?  If he was jerking off, he would have.  Jimmy, in your honest opinion, he was already looking at shit, right?  Yeah, of course he was.  And he even admitted.  He goes, you almost caught me jerking off to awful.  He goes awful.  Right.  So he did have some shit up there.  But then he explains his routine, and he said he was watching MMA videos.  And he knows we're not going to buy that. 
[00:23:00]  If he's jerking off to that.  But he says he starts with MMA videos, and then he moves on to something else.  He gives the whole scenario.  Man on man asshole.  But he was way past MMA videos when we broke in or whatever.  Panic either way with his wife coming through the door.  Well, that's what I thought if we hit him early that he would jerk off right away if she just left.  Yeah.  And the sad part is, my dog would probably be right here.  The dogs didn't even bark when we came in. 
[00:23:30]  Nothing.  Nobody flinched.  Because you blew it.  I didn't even know what we were doing.  You really blew it.  Outside the door, you should have said, he's going to be right inside there.  What do you want to do?  I thought you knew.  I thought you were going to open the door.  I'd run in with the camera.  Can I show this on film?  It's an Israeli chick.  No, see, it's a guy.  Those are hips.  Guys don't have those.  Joe doesn't have hips.  He doesn't have fucking shoulders.  And he has no concept of what we were trying to do.  This is cock sucker.  Why are you calling?  What?  No, but what did you say when you came in? 
[00:24:00]  Immediately under the bus.  It was a little dog.  Immediately.  It doesn't work.  I'm supposed to get him back for scaring the shit out of me.  And you blew my one up.  How much cum has that dog had to clean up?  That dog has lacked a lot of cum off the top of Bob's shoes.  He's out of his sneakers.  What was the plan, really?  What was the plan?  There was no plan, Bobby, is the answer.  All of a sudden, he's like.  Not me a little.  But I wouldn't know because I don't have it on camera.  That was bugger.  What's it look like?  I wouldn't know. 
[00:24:30]  He's singing with his dog.  Stop.  It's not.  Shut up.  It's crying.  It's singing, Joe.  It's singing.  It's crying.  Give me my dog, you fucking girl.  Oh, God.  It sounds horrible.  Then she'll start singing.  You got to let her.  You keep her walking, right?  Bob Lipson.  A weird existence.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Let's go get coffee.  Yes.  Because he knows when Bobby makes that noise, it's mealtime.  She knows cum snack is coming.  She knows to get, like when Bob makes, oh, she gets down by his fucking shoes and ankles.  Because she knows a big cum treat is going to be delivered.  And she knows the computer thing is going to be slammed shut.  And all male voices are going to stop immediately when he cums.  You notice he's ashamed.  You notice he finally got comfortable enough to get up off the table. 
[00:25:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  From the table, excuse me, and leave his laptop alone.  Yeah.  And then kind of have fun with us a little bit.  And then he's sitting back with his dog, making his dog sing, because he knows the threat  is over now.  Making his Bobby Cumsey sounds.  And his dog is like begging for it.  Yeah.  The dog sits up and begs us to turn out and sometimes, Bob will aim for the tongue just  to prevent, like, a big cleanup problem.  So no one slips on it when they walk in the door.  It goes right in the dog's mouth. 
[00:26:00]  The dog doesn't know how wrong it is.  No.  The dog notices that Bob's avoid eye contact after.  There's a little bit of bad vibes in the house.  Very embarrassing.  The threat is confused there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You see the shock in his face, like, oh, fuck, you scared me.  But no, the real threat was, we almost caught what he had on his laptop.  What he had.  It came out all right, but fuck.  I don't know.  Joe DeRosa fucked it up.  We had a perfect scenario. 
[00:26:30]  Perfect in that case.  Yeah.  And then a lot of people were like, why don't you try that at Anthony's house?  I saw that.  Yeah.  Why don't you go there and do the same thing?  That's why I see you through the window.  You're like, I would be stupid enough to go to Anthony's house and try that same trick.  Get the fuck out of here.  Great video of DeRosa's head exploding with a .45 hollow point would have been nice.  So you could slow motion.  Slow motion that one, please.  That would always be a good video under any circumstances.  See that nice red mist out of his exploding head. 
[00:27:00]  I would be sad for maybe an hour and then go, wow, how do I get this online?  Yeah, it's going to be huge.  This one's going to go viral.  Finally, I got a viral video.  Hey, shit.  Yeah, that's...  Jimmy, how was the ESPYs?  A bunch of tweets came in that you killed.  Thank you.  I didn't see it yet.  I was surprised.  I was very nervous about this piece.  I had no faith.  Because athletes suck, right?  No, they were fine. 
[00:27:30]  I just didn't...  I saw it in rehearsal.  And it did...  Oh.  In the rehearsal.  And usually that's a good indicator.  There were some big laughs.  And we made a couple of little switches and changes in the edit bay.  Just reversed a couple things.  Wow.  And it killed in the...  I was very happy with the way it played.  Isn't that amazing how you could do that?  Just switch a couple little things around.  It just...  It keeps the energy going.  And I was...  Because Rickles was the lead guest, so I mean, I was...  You meet him?  Oh, I've already met him.  Oh, yeah.  The pictures were great.  I've already met him, but I got him to sign the photo, and I went into the dressing room 
[00:28:00]  and I talked to him before, and he was...  When I came off stage, you know how when you leave the stage, because I don't stay out  there, because I'm between the monologue and first guest, so I came off, and Rickles  was sitting there just waiting to go out, so he had seen the whole piece, and he's like,  God, that was great, Jim.  That was great.  And he talked to me for a minute, and then...  Oh, that's bull.  He was fucking hilarious, because Jay introduced me as the bastard son of Donald Rickles,  and then at the end, I do promo shots, which you guys don't see, because they're showing, 
[00:28:30]  I think, in California.  Right.  You were hoping you were going to be on stage with Rickles, were you?  At the very, very end, but you'll never see it.  I was just...  It was just for promos for local news stations.  Yeah, I got you.  But I was, and he was so fucking sweet.  Oh, he was so great.  Yeah, he was hugging me, and oh, he was...  I was so happy.  His bitches look great.  Is he a nice guy?  Phenomenal.  When he's not being a sarcastic son of a bitch?  Dude, he was great.  He's such a great guy.  He just...  He was very loving.  He smelled good, too.  Like, Don Rickles smells rich. 
[00:29:00]  Like, he really did.  Really?  How old is he?  He's in his 80s.  I'd love to know when he was born.  I'm going to guess 1930.  Wow.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  But that was...  Bristol Palin was the other guest.  She was nice.  I fucking love Rickles.  I do, too.  And he was really genuinely nice to me.  What year was he born?  1926.  26.  He's 85 years old.  He's 85 years old.  And he was funny, man.  He was funny.  He's like...  Does he walk around like he's 85?  No, he doesn't.  I think he likes to sift, you know. 
[00:29:30]  And they actually debated bringing me out while he was on panel, which I look like him,  and sitting me next to him while he talked to Jay.  But they just...  Because he was on a roll, they just didn't want to...  Which was smart.  They shouldn't have.  You don't interrupt the guy when he's back and forth.  Wow, man.  But he was fucking funny.  He just kept...  Like, Jay said something.  He's like, I just said that.  What are you, dumb?  I just love how fucking nasty he is.  It's very nasty.  Oh, he's a funny guy, man.  That's cool.  So, yeah.  It went really well.  The athletes were all...  We got some good ones.  We got a lot of the guys from the... 
[00:30:00]  Did he get Michael Irvin?  Yeah.  He kissed me on the head.  Did he?  Kissed me.  Yeah, he was great.  What a mo.  Well.  Oh, his brother.  Really?  Isn't that the one that was just in the paper?  Yeah.  Talking about his brother a little bit.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, I think...  Oh, my God.  I hope it's Irvin's brother.  Somebody help me out.  Whoops.  And then said something like, sports in general are ready to accept gay athletes.  Wasn't that Irvin?  Oh, I don't know.  The other day? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, boy.  Ant, look down, please.  That's a big ye.  Anyone?  I got to get that one right.  I don't know.  Irvin?  All right.  Most of the athletes stopped and were very talkative.  Yeah.  A lot of them we couldn't use because of time, but I mean, they were all cool.  Some of the actors, like Justin Bieber came in.  He didn't stop for any.  He couldn't.  He just waved and whatever.  And then Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds wouldn't come over.  I was kind of annoyed at that.  They're going to be in that horseshit movie, what is it, Change?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Change Up? 
[00:31:00]  Whatever the fuck.  Oh, God.  We were just talking about that the other day.  Awful.  Yes.  They're going to switch roles.  Yes.  Are you?  It's the war.  The married guy is going to be the single guy.  The single guy is going to be the married guy.  How many times are they going to do that movie?  Once again, I'll say it.  There's a morality in Hollywood, so the married guy will absolutely not fuck as the single guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Even though this is make-believe world.  Right.  Because there's a wife involved, and it's morality. 
[00:31:30]  It's like, just do the movie if you're going to do it.  Have a married guy fuck all the sluts.  And he had the single guy with the other guy's wife, and he wasn't fucking her because  she had diarrhea or some shit.  But the single guy should now, you know, fuck the married guy's wife because now he's  the husband.  He's in the body of the husband.  So just do it.  Who cares?  I don't understand why they don't do that.  Who can we talk to about it?  It would be great if he was like, wow, she likes it in the ass.  It's like, she got really dirty, and she started exploring with the new one. 
[00:32:00]  Of course.  He starts telling the guy what kind of a whore his wife is.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, was Al Sharpton really on your flight?  Sat in front of me.  Reverend Al?  He sat literally right in the seat in front of me.  Did he tell us to him?  First class, huh?  Yeah.  Reverend Al flies first class?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course he does.  And that's an expensive first class.  Nice.  Taking all that money he's getting from his fucking church, whatever that is, and he's  flying first class.  Hypocrite.  What a motherfucker. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone is up.  Give me a break.  Yeah.  Did you have a little conversation with him?  No.  When he got on, he looked at me.  He didn't recognize me.  He just was putting his bag up.  I went, hey, Reverend Al.  And he went, hey.  I said, how are you?  He said, hello.  That was it.  Yeah.  And I did tweet about it, but I waited until I get off the flight, because I had a line  I wanted to do, but I'm like, you can't do that before the plane takes long.  I saw that tweet.  Before the plane take, you can't do it?  Yeah.  A long flight?  I saw your tweet.  Yeah, you don't need, anything like that with Twitter, with the fucking plane.  Can you read it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you just can't do it before the plane. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  What was Jimmy's tweet exactly?  I said, Al Sharpton sat on the plane in front of me.  It's the first time I ever prayed for my own flight to crash.  But you can't do that before the fucking plane.  Right, right, yes.  You just don't want any weird.  Security and shit, yeah.  That's hilarious.  Thank you.  That's a funny fucking tweet, man.  Sally Field was on my flight going out, too.  I really wanted the picture with her, but she's going to go right.  How'd she look?  She looked good, man.  She looked really fun. 
[00:33:30]  And you know, she was two C's to my right, and two C's to my left was Kira Sedgwick, who  was fucking, looked good, man.  Oh, she's hot, man.  Oh, she kept picking her, she kept bringing her bag down, and she would squat down to get her  bag, and she had, like, this little fucking...  She goes, stop doing that.  Yeah, come on.  Your ass is showing.  Oh, she has a fucking nice body, man.  Yeah.  Oof.  And we saw her once.  Oh, she was here a lot, actually.  That was one where I tweeted that one, where it was like, oh, it's the flying nun and the  flying N-O-N-E, nun, for you.  That's a good one. 
[00:34:00]  She said the flying nunnery or something.  I love word.  I love wordplay.  Wordplay.  Wordplay, nun.  The flying nun.  Bob Kelly is on the line.  Bobby.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Bob.  I like your morning voice.  Smokey, sexy voice.  I like that voice.  No, no.  Let me tell you something, dude.  Dude.  Let me tell you something, dude.  Dude.  We got some observations on that video, Bobby, now that it's been a while.  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy pointed out, and a few other people pointed out, you were not scared whatsoever 
[00:34:30]  when me and Joe burst through your front door.  What you were scared about was the fact that we might get a shot of what you were actually  looking at on your laptop.  You were closing or minimizing windows at a fucking panic speed.  You can see in the video, your finger is just swiping the fucking computer.  You're clicking.  Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.  Like a pit crew at a...  Yeah, yeah, it was like an indie pit crew.  Right.  Your fingers were lightly dancing across that fucking... 
[00:35:00]  Foot's close, foot's close, foot's close, foot's close.  And then at one point, you put your hand on the back of the computer, of the laptop,  like at any moment, you're just going to slam it shut.  That was the last move you had in your arsenal.  Yeah.  I was going to snap that screen in half, if you've done anything.  We can only imagine the filth that was on there.  What creep CSI private investigator did you hire to figure that out? 
[00:35:30]  Well, Jimmy noticed it, and a bunch of people that checked out the video noticed it.  Your fingers are dancing.  Yeah, you really were shutting windows.  And then you finally, when you minimized all the windows you needed to, then you sat back  and addressed us and what just happened.  After all the man-on-man shit was closed.  The dead giveaway was that two guys burst into your place like that, you look at them for  two seconds, then you don't make eye contact, you're just concentrating on your screen and 
[00:36:00]  shutting things.  What about the oily finger that was just in my ass?  Oily.  Did I shake your hand?  Oily finger.  And we're convinced that your dog makes that sound when you're going, oh, oh, oh, because  you make that sound when you cum, and the dog knows it's got to lick it up.  That's it.  Diva knows a snack is arriving soon.  That snack.  That's the same as opening up the cookie treat jar in a fucking song playing. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, oh, and the dog's like, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, you're just making that oh, oh, oh sound.  The dog is just thinking bleachy treats, bleachy treats.  You're going to train it somehow.  And we said how Diva will go to your ankles and feet because you probably cum right down  your leg.  Just glurk.  Yeah.  With blurka, blurka.  Blurka, blurka, and she'll lick the cum out of your laces. 
[00:37:00]  Fucking sitting there with your pants around your ankles and bowling shoes on.  Holy shit.  Licking gum out of your fucking bowling shoelaces.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I love that.  Whoever observed that, you may be right.  Yeah.  But that proves that you're a normal guy, Ope.  Why?  Because you didn't even pick up on that.  You're a nice human being.  You don't have a deviant phone in your body. 
[00:37:30]  No, I kind of knew something might be going on with that laptop.  Something could have been up.  I'm not stupid.  That little finger was in a fucking time warp.  You really were.  Yeah.  I'd hate to be your fingers.  Oh, God.  They go from such bad places to such good places, too.  It's like for most of the day, they're in ice cream and cake.  But when it's bad, it's really bad.  Fucking DeRosa blew my pay back there, Bobby. 
[00:38:00]  Jesus Christ.  DeRosa stinks at scaring people.  You said in the video how he doesn't have that scary...  No, he's just like, hey, motherfucker!  He's like the host of a kid's show.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  And then a lot of people want to beat you up for where you live.  And I'm like, hey, idiots, you didn't even see the apartment.  Bob is a really cool place.  Yeah, I purposely didn't film the apartment.  Two stories.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, by the way, I've been enjoying playing online chess with Bob.  Oh, yeah?  And you said your wife was doing an impression?  Oh, you're fucking...  She's doing chip now.  Oh, God, how annoying.  Oh, that's terrible.  We were driving home the other day.  I was lost in Jersey.  Off the turnpike, I went up at this awful truck stop that I didn't even know existed.  I'm sure you did.  Yeah.  She's like, why don't you turn into the service and get some service? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  Were you annoyed?  I almost fucking left it there with a truck driver.  Dude, my fingers are in the best and worst places.  They really are.  It's like his other fingers see them in peach cobbler and fucking cake all the time and get jealous.  And they're like, you don't understand.  When you guys leave and we're alone, it's going to be a dark, ugly fucking evening.  He buries us in his asshole. 
[00:39:30]  Really?  His age?  Yes.  Two or three at a time.  He digs for a piece of non-existent toilet paper.  He just scratches and itches.  And the nails are like, we can back that up.  That's awful.  Yeah.  He's a matchbook to get the crap out of my fingernails.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your fingers are fucking miserable compared to other people's fingers.  I bet you Bob wakes up and his fucking fingers have crab walked him to the bathroom and they're 
[00:40:00]  just soaking in soapy water.  He has no idea that his hands have just turned the sink on and put soap in there.  His hands have minds of their own.  They're tired of it.  His fucking fingers are tired of it.  They actually watch that scene in Escape from Alcatraz when the hatchet chops the fingers  off and they get jealous.  They're like, how do we talk him into doing that?  Well, you were very close.  You were very close to getting a really good video. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Well, then we would have had a discussion.  That video was good?  I'm sure we would have had a discussion, though, after the camera went off.  Dude, you can't help me.  I'm married.  Dude, come on, dude.  She suspects I like this stuff, but she doesn't know.  I was just doing some research, dude.  Yeah.  It would have been the scene in The Godfather at the wedding.  I would have grabbed your camera and smashed it.  Yeah.  They're on a couple of bucks on the floor.  I have to ask, because your wife set you up there.  It's in the video. 
[00:41:00]  What was said when she got home?  I haven't seen her since yesterday.  No, come on.  No.  I just called her a fucking traitor, bitch.  Yeah.  But she was laughing.  And she thought it was hilarious that you guys brought it.  It would have been hilarious if she actually found out what I was looking at.  We'll see if she was laughing then.  Yeah.  We tried looking at the screen, like freeze-framing some of the video.  We're doing some CSI shit this morning.  But you covered up pretty well. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was pretty bad.  That left hand was ready to slam that laptop shut.  It sure was.  I think you were going to run for it with the laptop.  I have it set up to where, like, one finger, I can usually swipe it up and swipe it to the left or swipe it to the right corner.  Everything goes away or shut everything down.  For some reason, everything just didn't work.  I don't like it.  I don't like it if you just dumped your coffee into your keyboard. 
[00:42:00]  Like, fuck it.  I'm going to just buy a new one.  Your fingers look like the fucking soldiers in war games trying to shut down a whopper.  But the beauty of the whole thing, too, is he's really quick with that right hand.  But he's also trying to make it look casual.  Yeah.  So he's talking.  I don't know how you do that.  Yeah, his eyes are saying one thing.  His eyes are going, hey, guys, you almost got me.  His fingers are going, panic, panic, panic, gay videos, panic, panic, panic, panic, panic, gay videos, panic, tranny, panic, panic, panic, nude children, panic, panic, panic. 
[00:42:30]  Those are just the voices in your head.  All right, guys, I'm doing the weather on PIX this morning, Channel 11.  Oh, you really are?  Yeah, turn it on the TV.  I'm doing the weather.  Put the TV down.  How did you get that?  I have the worst publicist in the world.  When are you doing the weather?  I'd love to do the weather.  What time are you doing the weather?  Uh, a nine o'clock. 
[00:43:00]  I would love to be able to do that.  That's a while away.  All right.  Say how to Jill.  Is that who it is?  No, she does the traffic.  She does traffic, but that's her channel, though.  Yeah, if she's there, you'll see her.  No wonder I can't get it.  Oh.  You guys are friends again, right?  Yeah, she's all right.  I got no problems.  There's no problems here.  There's no problems.  There's no problems here.  Yes.  Hey, go ahead.  Do it whether you have fun or not doing the weather.  Weather the weather. 
[00:43:30]  Get it?  We're going to go.  Chip, goodbye.  All right, Bobby.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  I'm so happy his wife is still in chip.  Oh, God.  How annoying.  How annoying.  This is a great question.  How many times has Bobby practiced shutting the computer down if his wife came home?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  His movement was like, I got this down.  I practice this every day.  He's right there by the front door.  I know.  Jerk off downstairs.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And set a trap upstairs. 
[00:44:00]  You know why he'll do it?  So when that door opens, something happens.  Put baby oil on the fucking floor so she slips and cracks her head.  She breaks her femur.  You have time to fucking close the computer.  You know what it is?  I know Bobby's layout.  He's on a ground floor.  And there's a window.  So if he sits in a certain place, the computer faces the window.  He can't do that.  Where he's sitting there.  If he sits on the sofa and jerks off, he's going to balance it on his fat knees.  And the fucking, the door, the door will open and she'll be able to look left and see what he's jerking off to. 
[00:44:30]  But when he's sitting there, it's the one place where the fucking computer's facing the kitchen behind him and not the front door.  So he's, and he's practiced that shut it down.  Sure he has.  And Dawn doesn't sneak in.  She probably doesn't jingle the key.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  She just walks in all happy, whistling.  Not knowing.  Yeah.  That he's.  Because she's not married to a creep.  Yeah, exactly.  She probably gets sick.  I think the whistling stops and she gets closer to the door and is thinking like, oh yeah.  Yeah, that's who's behind the other side.  The depression sticks in. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, like the whistle gets slowly sadder and turns into fucking like taps.  Or like a prison documentary whistle.  She realizes the lump that's probably smoking and jerking off with his slippers on.  He fucking smokes in his apartment.  Smokes in his apartment.  I guess that doesn't matter if you're a smoker.  Yeah, if you're a smoker.  Anyone coming into that place.  What the fuck?  I didn't think anyone did that anymore.  He does.  I think that's the first time I've been in someone's apartment where they smoke in it.  Yeah.  In a long time.  I would hate to smell his keyboard.  Ugh. 
[00:45:30]  Nicotine and crumbs and loads and asshole.  What about his fingertips with all the shit he's in?  Ugh.  Fucking awful.  Those poor keys.  Oh God, we were holding the keys.  Oh no.  No, I mean the fucking keys on the computer.  Well, that's true, yeah.  The computer keys.  Sure, sure.  That fucking, that return key, because that's the one you use to X or whatever, that return  key has probably got a, I'd love to fucking get a DNA swab on that.  Probably a lot of different substances on that one key.  Yeah, no doubt. 
[00:46:00]  Or on the C. I bet you on the C key there's a lot too.  And the K.  The O key has got a few fucking.  Oh yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  God damn.  All right.  Good old Bobby.  Jimmy back from L.A., and that's good.  All right, I guess we'll take a break, huh?  What do we got going on today?  Anything?  Oh, the couch of Zilchers today.  Oh, really?  Yes.  No.  What?  Yes.  Stalker Patty and David from Israel? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, not intern David.  No.  You know David from Israel who calls us?  Yes.  Yes, David.  What, is he going to be in New York, I guess?  Oh no.  Because he's stopping by today.  I hope he's not involved in that big case that's going on.  The fucking Hasidics.  Oh boy.  Oh, David.  It's deeply depressing, man.  Terrible.  That guy's fucking...  My question today is, did this guy just start killing, or are we going to fucking find  out some shit in the coming days?  I don't know.  I bet he's been up to shenanigans.  You don't see Ascidic Jews doing that kind of...  I mean, occasionally, it's really rare, man. 
[00:47:00]  That's not something a profiler would have picked up on.  I just stopped reading this one, because this guy's a fucking creep.  Yeah.  He's a monster, man.  I just remembered the kid.  You'd like to see this guy just shot in the fucking...  That's what he said yesterday.  Just shoot him.  That's...  And now he's on suicide watch.  You know what?  Let him go.  Not as good as, you know, putting a bullet to the back of his head, but let him fucking  kill himself then.  There's no easy way to kill yourself in prison, so he'll suffer a bit.  And get him off this fucking planet. 
[00:47:30]  How did that guy...  What use does he have?  The Craigslist killer, Philip Markham.  I forget how he killed himself, but he figured...  He's just a smart dude.  He figured out how to kill himself and kill him.  What, he'd choke himself?  Choke yourself.  Also, he'd cut himself, too.  But he knew that he was in fucking...  And he'd put a bag on his head or some shit.  Oh.  Nah, you can find stuff.  Yeah, this guy's probably gonna get the shit beat out of him.  In the joint.  I don't know, man.  I like to think prisoners do that, but...  Do convicts really beat up kid rapists and kid killers? 
[00:48:00]  I think they do.  I think they beat them up.  I hope they do.  They'll punch them in the face.  It goes unreported, like...  It's not gonna make the news unless you really get fucking the shit beat out of you.  Fuck yeah.  Like, dumber.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I think as you walk by, you know, someone might flick your food, punch you in the face.  You hope so.  Yeah, you do.  It doesn't happen, though.  Not enough.  Unfortunately, they gotta protect them now and all that crap.  That's what they do.  Because, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:48:30]  They shouldn't, though.  It should be a fucking, a horrible place for a child molester or whatever, and they should  be released in the general population.  A murder.  Yeah.  Before we go to break, Seth in Illinois.  The Emmy nominations happened yesterday, and our pal Louis CK was nominated for a whole  bunch of Emmys.  I heard two.  Was it two?  I heard it was...  Okay.  I heard two Emmys.  It was Best Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Writing.  Oh, wow.  Maybe there's more, but I thought Louis tweeted that there was two.  Okay.  He writes, oh, does Jimmy know the one scene he did for Louis, poker scene, is now Emmy 
[00:49:00]  nominated?  But I'm confused by that, because that was last season.  That was the first season.  Well, this one's tuned.  It couldn't be for this season.  Yeah.  I didn't know that that was nominated.  That's great.  So they're that far behind, I guess?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I guess.  Because don't forget, cable works differently than network traditional seasons.  Well, that's fucking cool, Jimmy.  I didn't know that was the scene that was nominated.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  The scene you were in is Emmy nominated.  Oh, good, good.  According to Seth in Illinois.  Oh, so maybe it is more than two.  I just don't know. 
[00:49:30]  That creep murderer guy has karaoke shit up online.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we got it.  Please.  Do we have it?  Can we see it?  We might have to hear some of his...  Is he good?  Yeah, we'll...  I haven't heard it.  Yeah, we'll play it after the break so we can eat and stuff.  What's he sing?  What kind of songs?  It's...  Yeah.  Hava.  Yeah, Hebrew.  I don't know any of these, but the three that they list here is If I Never See Your Face  Again.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  No air.  Oh, boy.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Why does it always work out this way?  And what else? 
[00:50:00]  Bring Me to Life.  Oh, wow.  Those are really the three songs.  Yeah.  I swear.  Wow.  Jesus.  Why does it always work out this way?  It really does.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll listen to that shit after the break.  Oh, here's the...  Jesus is just...  It keeps getting back.  There's another duet called Broken.  Ah.  A duet.  Seems to make a little sense.  Wow, that's horrible.  And Lucky, which I get finally breaks the mold here.  Yeah.  He sings it ironically.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll break and we'll play some of the creeps out there.  Yeah.  Good to see Bobo, too, at least on the couch in the chair of honor.  Is he coming in for the chair of honor today?  Oh, he's not?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Oh, wasn't he supposed to?  Oh, no.  Oh, he should have called.  Why didn't he call?  Oh.  All right.  Well, I guess he's not interested anymore.  So, by the way.  If he hasn't come in, he hasn't come in.  By the way.  By the way, for the show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:51:00]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  How's this?  Why is it being played?  I don't know this one.  We just got new rejoiners.  This is 311.  Oh.  New 311?  It's called Sunset in July.  Is it old?  I don't know.  I don't know much about 311.  Me neither. 
[00:51:30]  I know the basics, but.  Oh.  All right.  I thought maybe, you know, somebody's birthday or something.  No.  Ah.  Well, we got to announce the death.  Oh, what?  Of a character actor.  Ah, yes, yes, yes.  Remember old man Marley?  Yeah.  He's dead.  He was old forever.  He was in the Home Alone movies.  Yep.  87 years old.  The old guy.  The old guy from Home Alone is no longer with us.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Bye-bye, funny man.  He was always old.  You know, they had a Betty Ford thing on today.  You know, she did an interview in 2004 at the age of 80.  I guess she would have been 86.  And I couldn't believe she was 86 and how she was talking.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, it was easy.  Like, fucking sharp?  Sharp as a tack?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Seven years later, she dies at 93, but...  Yeah, well, hang on, though.  Helen Mirren is in the paper today.  What is she doing? 
[00:52:30]  I know this bothers you.  It really bothers me.  So I ripped it out of the paper just to bother you.  Oh.  I'm kind of on board with you.  When I read this, you're going to be so annoyed.  You got a big, fucking old tits.  Nah, man.  That's all right.  Danny, I know you'll play.  You'll play, right?  I don't know.  I mean...  You'll play, Danny.  I'd like to see it in person.  I mean, there could be a lot of damage there that you're just not seeing.  We're looking at Helen Mirren in a little...  A bikini.  A red bikini.  She's looking.  She knows she's being photographed. 
[00:53:00]  I'm sure she's sucking in a world of hurt.  I don't know, man.  Would you?  Probably.  I so would.  I mean, it would be easy to say,  like, no, no, fuck that.  But, you know, if she was there, like, jerking me off,  of course I'm going to stick my dick in her head.  Yeah, right.  Fuck that.  Well, that picture is the most flattering I've ever seen of her.  Tell you the truth.  She kept her shit together, I'm telling you.  And don't even ask Jimmy, would you?  Jimmy, would you?  Oh.  Hang on, let me get back.  Yeah, get back to that picture.  Helen Mirren, Jimmy, would you?  Um, no. 
[00:53:30]  Well, look at the picture, though, before you say no.  Oh, your eyes went out.  His eyebrows went up a little bit.  Helen has really great big tits.  She's sexy for an older woman.  She's really hot.  And they look like they don't sag too bad.  Look at her abs.  I mean, she has a body on her.  Yeah, and they've got nice hips.  But I'm not, uh, she's too old for me.  It's the old woman mouth that would bother me and the gray hair.  Yeah.  But everything else.  I took a photo with her, and she's fucking, uh,  pretty sexy in real life.  She's good in person, man.  Does she have those dried lips? 
[00:54:00]  Nah.  Those dried, cracked lips?  Go to the first one where she's bending over a little bit.  She was always sexy.  Uh, in the bathing suit.  Oh, right, where she's on the boat or wherever.  Yeah, right there.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at those tits.  They're hanging in there, man.  She was kind of, uh, I saw an interview with her from the 70s.  Wow.  Where she was being interviewed in Britain,  and it was an uncomfortable interview,  because the guy was talking about her sexuality.  But even back then, she was just known as this fucking, like,  really, like, she had that slutty, sexy image. 
[00:54:30]  She was like a dirty girl.  Well, she started that way, but now she's known as a dame.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  She had the sexy roles where she was showing off her body.  But she's still dirty.  Look at that.  Oh, what's going on?  Which one?  The one where they have those...  In her tits.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, that's back in the day, as they call it, the day.  The left one's always a little bigger than the right one.  You see, though, and this is forever ago,  and they're already trying to, like, look behind her.  Mm-hmm.  So I can't even imagine what that looks like now.  The left one is always bigger. 
[00:55:00]  Why?  We figured out the heart's kind of closer to the left side or something,  pumping more blood.  It may be.  What was our theory on this?  Is it always the left?  I don't know.  Girls will tell you.  The left boob is just slightly bigger.  I don't know why.  Mm.  Let's see another picture.  Let's see that bitch.  More recent picture, I guess.  Well, there's one in the paper.  Well, no.  That one's not doing anything.  This will drive you nuts.  Oh, see?  Okay.  Now she's wearing the old woman.  The grandma one piece.  Old woman baby suit.  Look at her big tits, though, man. 
[00:55:30]  She has good fucking heavy tits.  She's got that E.T.  old lady body going.  That one does have big tits.  That one's a little rough.  No denying that.  That one's a little worse.  Anyway.  Big, fat, fucking suckable tits.  She's on the cover of Esquire magazine.  It's in the paper today.  Esquire.  There is no taming the dame.  Ah, the dame.  Yes, yes.  In the August issue of Esquire, Helen Mirren poses in nothing but the Union Jack.  Yes.  She doesn't have old lady lips.  I'm looking at a picture close up. 
[00:56:00]  Her lips are nice.  Yeah.  By the looks of the ageless big screen siren.  Ageless.  Yeah.  And this is what's going to drive Anthony nuts.  And actually, I'm on board with this.  It's no wonder she beat 25-year-old Megan Fox by a landslide in the...  Anyone want to guess?  Sexy voting?  Or sexy category?  In the magazine's Sexiest Woman Alive competition.  Just stop it.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's the sexiest woman alive.  Look at that picture of her.  Yeah.  I'm looking at an old lady on the beach. 
[00:56:30]  And now can you give me a picture of Megan Fox?  I would...  Just go with any Megan Fox picture, by the way.  You don't even have to get the best one.  Megan Fox after a fire.  The one that launched her career.  Yeah.  All right.  How about that?  Fuck.  So...  Yeah, that's not as sexy.  Her under the hood of the Camaro there in Transformers.  That's not as sexy as the old woman on the beach?  Maybe they talk to people in the fucking thumb fetish club.  Oh, man.  Bill Maher actually had the best bit on fucking...  How he's sick and tired of... 
[00:57:00]  Who's the big sex symbol?  Not Raquel Welch.  Who's the other one?  Sophia Loren.  Yeah.  Being on these sexy lists and he just fucking attacks these old ladies that people think  are sexy.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  It used to be.  Oh, man.  But, I mean, they wrote this like it's a fact that people really think Helen Mirren is sexier  than Megan Fox.  That's just ridiculous.  Where is that vote?  In some fucking dumb rag magazine?  Helen Mirren beat Megan Fox by a landslide.  Landslide, right.  Get the fuck out of here.  Sure it is. 
[00:57:30]  Just dumb nonsense.  Magazines have a lot of just dumb nonsense in them.  Nonsense.  It's just nonsense reading.  The entertainment mags.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just icky.  I don't want any part of that.  That's icky, right, Ant?  Ew.  Ew, icky.  Ew, she's in a...  Her thumbs suck.  Jesus Christ.  Now I gotta cover my thumbs for the rest of the show.  If they were wrapped around your dick, you wouldn't care.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  I would actually.  Get your feet off my dick.  Oh, sorry, ladies.  Boy, they really do make an issue of her thumbs. 
[00:58:00]  They're hard.  They're toned thumbs.  Look, I got the same fucking thumbs.  Yeah, but you're not a sex symbol.  You're a dirty fucking radio DJ.  Your thumbs don't matter.  Look at it.  I got the same fucking thing.  She can't go bowling either.  I can't fucking find a bowling ball that fit this thumb.  That's how they always know when you're bowling when they hear, shit.  All right.  I'll just want to.  That's the sound.  It's a great line, but that's exactly what happens.  What is that? 
[00:58:30]  A normal thumb?  My ball lifts up a little too high because it gets stuck at first.  Well, you know, there are ways to have your...  They actually have balls that just have like a little crater.  You can just put that part in and grip it a certain way.  Well, my problem is I have to get the...  I just made the whole thing up.  I have to get the bowling ball for the big hand guys.  Oh, really?  Because they figure, all right, big hand guys have thicker thumbs.  A giant thumb.  But I got small hands and then this fucking bulbous weird thumb.  So you got the big reach.  Yeah, so I can't bowl properly.  That'd be a great little piece for a singles ad. 
[00:59:00]  I got these small hands and these great bulbous thumbs.  I just can't bowl properly.  Seeking friends.  I used to go to the Huntington Lanes.  I thought I was going to be a bowling star for, you know.  Did you really?  Oh, yeah.  I liked it.  I think I joined a bowling league.  Ball on Xbox Kinect.  Huh?  It's better.  Yeah, that's true.  I was a great bowler.  I just didn't like it.  I bowled at 240.  It just bores me.  You're so lying.  There's no way you fucking bowled at 240. 
[00:59:30]  I did when I was 14.  No.  Look at your face.  What was it?  Bumper bowling?  It was 10 24s.  Sorry.  10 games of 24.  I just added them up.  Bumper bowling?  Is there anything worse than bumper bowling?  Bumper bowling.  I never heard of it.  And it's very hard to find a bowling alley that's just a fucking bowling alley these days.  Yeah.  It's like, I don't need fucking blasting music, fluorescent lights, disco balls.  It's like, yeah, I'm trying to actually play the game here. 
[01:00:00]  I don't need the risk of an epileptic seizure.  Yeah, a fucking Pokemon seizure.  I just want to bowl with my pals and get a pitcher of beer.  We're doing some rock and bowling tonight, fluorescent headpin, get some fucking, just  put, could I have a 19 fucking 50s bowling alley with Schlitz signs up and, yeah, that's  what I want.  I kind of like it, actually.  I haven't done it in a while, but.  You know, it's good if that's what you want to go for, but if you're actually going to  bowl a game, it's crazy.  It was smart.  I don't like to fucking play golf and have fucking music blasting and disco balls 
[01:00:30]  and be like, I'm trying to play a game here.  I want to golf at night, though.  There's a few courses that light up the whole course, but you have to be good because they  can't have lights everywhere, so you've got to be close to the fairway to take advantage  of the lights.  Mitch Kumpstein.  That's right.  You're the Fudway.  Your ball goes in the woods and you're fucked.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I thought we were going to move on from bowling, but this is going to start a whole thing right  here.  Ed in Boston, go ahead.  Oh, you're a millionaire. 
[01:01:00]  You could buy your own ball and have the thumb hole drilled out.  Oh, well.  I always thought the guys that had their own bowling balls were faggots.  Really?  And not in the sexual way, but...  Really?  Oh, the guys that showed up to the bowling alley with their own bowling balls and then  they're polishing it before the game and stuff.  Got to polish your ball bag.  They don't want anybody else touching...  They don't want those dirty thumb holes.  That is true.  What the fuck is inside those...  You know what I used to do?  I used to take my tongue and lick out the fucking finger holes in the ball. 
[01:01:30]  Like that.  There you go.  I'll take a greasy bowling ball any day before I, you know, have my own bowling ball bag.  Ed, do you have your own bowling bag?  No, I don't.  I don't bowl.  You know bowling balls must run for the hills when they see Bob Kelly walking up in his  bowling shoes?  Those fucking finger holes, they all try to shrink themselves so his shitty cheese doodle  asshole fingers can't slide in.  Cheese doodle and assholes.  I bet you the bowling balls talk about them, what they smell like today.  Dog tongue and asshole. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, that'd be awful.  You're the next guy.  I had them last week.  It was cigarettes and cake, an ugly combination.  I think Ratspitt's got it.  He says, Opie, bowling is white trash beneath you, sir.  Bowling?  Do you bowl?  For fun.  Not for, you know.  I'd go.  I would go bowling.  If somebody's going like, hey, I'm going bowling.  You want to go?  I'm up.  Well, of course, for fun.  We never thought you'd do it to prevent a beheading.  What are the reasons?  Could you do it?  The pressure would be on, right? 
[01:02:30]  Got a strike.  Remember we were trying to get the homeless to go bowling?  Yes.  We should bring that back.  Homeless bowling.  Oh, yeah.  Because everything works with the homeless here at this fucking place.  Well, you must indemnify the company just in case a homeless guy fucking throws a bowling  ball at a child's head, right?  Yeah.  We're in some kind of quandary with the company right now, aren't we?  Yeah.  They want us to do like a couple gigs, but we're not taking any fucking responsibility.  So now they can see what we go through every day with the lawyers. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I don't need that.  No.  They want us to...  Oh, never mind.  Maybe two inside.  Fuck it.  Sorry.  We're good, though.  Huh?  Yeah, I think we're all right.  Why?  Why?  You got an update?  Did you see any email from Mr. Bob Eadman?  It's all good.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  We're all good.  Bob Eadman, he tongues the ball.  What movie is that?  Did he write me?  Lebowski.  When did he write it?  Last night, I believe.  I think you got one from Bob.  I do believe. 
[01:03:30]  If one of you guys have it, could you forward it to me?  Sure.  Now we're doing some inside shit on the air.  That's right.  Just email chatter.  People love email talk.  They do?  Email talk Fridays.  All right.  Good.  Business talk.  Yes.  Who's this guy?  Bobo.  Some Bobo is on the line.  Bobo.  Yeah, I'm here.  Oh, hi, Bobo.  So I guess we're going to see you in the studio today.  The chair of honor is yours today, sir?  Unfortunately, I didn't get that email. 
[01:04:00]  I didn't even know that they were doing this this week.  All right.  My computer is working.  Well, could you get here in 20 minutes?  I don't know 20 minutes, but I can get here in time.  I could leave right now, shower, and I'll be there.  Yeah?  20 minutes?  That's a great scene, too.  Polishing their balls.  I don't know if I can make it 20 minutes, but I can make it there in an hour.  An hour?  Jimmy, what do you think?  Jeez, the show's like over.  Oh. 
[01:04:30]  Wait, right here.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're saying.  If he can only make him.  Yeah, the chair of honor.  What?  I got it.  That's the chair of honor, right?  So you want Bobo to get here?  What do you think?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, Bobo, if you can get here.  All right.  I can get there.  If you're not here by 742, we've got to take back the offer.  All right.  I can try here. 
[01:05:00]  Bobo, you should bring Ope's Met ticket.  Oh, fuck.  Do you have it on you, buddy?  Yeah, I don't have the Met tickets for the closer seats.  I got the ones for the other day.  My friend has those tickets.  That's fine.  Just bring it so you can talk to him about the game.  Yeah, well, you should bring it anyway.  It's like a good faith thing.  Oh, my God.  Don't tempt me.  I put that part of me behind me for a while.  Don't tempt me.  Bobo, we'll see you in about an hour then, I guess.  All right.  I'll bring that and I'll bring the ticket.  Thank you.  Yeah, do that. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  Bobo is on his way.  Blood away.  Blood, blood, blood away.  God.  It's just nothing but idiocy.  You missed yesterday.  We talked about KFC chicken for an hour.  Oh, God.  Did we ever.  And then in the end, because people always wonder how this stuff plays out, we never got our chicken.  We never got it.  They didn't open until after we got out of here.  Yeah.  That shit happens. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  But I did listen to some of that on the replay.  It was fun.  It was funny.  Just denying people chicken.  And I really would have had a piece.  So let's go with something else.  Now, though, I'm just kind of like, no.  Want to go donuts today?  No.  No.  No.  You don't like donuts?  I'm not a big donut guy.  Not a big fan of the donut.  Where are you at with cupcakes?  Not a big fan of the cupcake.  Cupcakes have made a huge comeback in the last few years, though. 
[01:06:30]  Not a fan.  No.  No.  If I'm going to eat something that's not good for me to eat.  Roland Hurt is talking about food.  Holy shit, Roland.  Rare steak.  Donut plant's open right now.  What?  The best donuts.  Where is it?  2037th.  I know.  And what's it called?  Donut plant.  They're at the Threat Luscious Donuts.  So good.  Donut plant?  I have no idea what he said.  Donut plant?  I couldn't understand him either. 
[01:07:00]  I heard donuts.  Sam was talking yesterday about how there are certain interpreters in here that will help  you to interpret what Roland is saying at times.  Okay.  Say it slowly.  Donut plant.  Donut plant.  Donut plant.  What makes them the best donut place in the city?  They're so delicious.  They're airy, fluffy.  Yeah, but do they have special flavors that no one else is doing?  Threat Luscious.  What?  It's called Threat Slashers.  Throat Slashers?  No, Threats Leches. 
[01:07:30]  The Three Milks.  The Slutches?  Three Milks in Spanish.  Threats Leches.  That's in Spanish.  Tres Leches?  Yes.  You can't even speak your own language properly.  Wait.  Tres?  Tres?  Tres Leches.  Tres Leches.  Tres Leches.  Tres Leches.  Three Leches.  Three Leaches.  It's delicious.  Why is that one good?  It's so good.  Three milks?  Three different milks into the donut.  It's really good.  Isn't there just one milk?  Yes, we know. 
[01:08:00]  When did we realize we can't understand Roland?  Because I remember back at the other place, I never really had a problem.  I don't think.  But now it's very difficult to understand you sometimes, Roland.  I wonder what that is.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I was very impressed at your restaurant prowess yesterday.  Yeah.  Any type of food that came up, Roland knew exactly where to go to get it. 
[01:08:30]  He knew.  This city is his.  His for the eating.  He just walks around like Pac-Man around this city.  I see you got the U2 shirt on, and we were this close to having the exact same shirt on today.  Oh, shit.  I figured I wanted to be warm, so I went long sleeve, but I had my U2 shirt out today.  They played Philly last night, right?  Yeah.  Keith Robinson went and saw them.  He texted me. 
[01:09:00]  Keith likes U2?  Well, no.  But, I mean, not to my knowledge, but I got a text.  What the fuck is this?  Oh, shit.  White people, man.  White people music.  I'm fucking ball shot.  No, I got it.  We're in the streets of New York.  Mark.  Hold on a second.  I got this random text from him.  He's like, at U2 concert.  It's pretty amazing.  So I wrote back.  I've never seen them live.  And he writes, it's my first white concert.  And I write, I hope you get jumped. 
[01:09:30]  And he writes, would you be happy to hear a hate crime happened at the U2 concert?  And I wrote, a yes.  So he really enjoyed himself.  But I was hoping he'd be attacked.  Well, you know.  I heard a ridiculous number, how much U2 brings in a night.  If you could find that figure.  Well, I know the.  It is unbelievable.  I know the tour total, what they're going to.  What's the tour total?  You do know this?  Yeah, Jonathan got to go in their, in their fucking, in their, uh, because he knows Chris  Blackwell, and, uh, who discovered them. 
[01:10:00]  So they, they get to go in their fucking, the motorcade that takes them to and from the  show.  And what I hear is the tour, over three years, will bring in 900 million and will net, will  gross 900 million and they'll net 200 million.  So it's 150 trucks needed for their tour.  Yeah, it's crazy overhead, this tour.  It's insane.  It's amazing how Bono talks about poverty.  And there's literally seven, I mean, there's probably a lot of taxes and legit expenses. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hundreds of millions of dollars because their stage is so big.  But he is putting people to work.  A lot of guys are working.  A lot of people are fucking working.  No, no, that's true.  That's true.  But just the fucking amount of trucks.  You ever see when they do that, they showed a, uh, a fast motion, um, of setting up and  taking down the stage and like clockwork and the amount of trucks that are just  pulling in, leaving, pulling in, leaving, unloading shit.  This huge fucking stage being built.  They can't do it.  They have three different stages.  Yeah.  It's not the same one every time. 
[01:11:00]  Right, right.  It takes so long to set up.  Yeah.  And yeah, they got to be setting up at the next venue.  Yeah.  Uh, unbelievable.  You start as a band where you just get your equipment, go on stage and play, and then it  comes to this point.  That's got to be just an amazing feeling.  Yeah.  How do they figure that out?  That's that time lapse.  It's like they just make a puzzle every night.  Dude, there are cranes.  Wow.  There are cranes that are used for fucking buildings.  Yeah.  They're selling that stage when the tour's over too, I read.  To who?  Museum.  I don't know. 
[01:11:30]  They're doing a museum.  The screen's going to a museum in England, I think.  Really?  Jesus Christ.  Can you find out how much they're making tonight?  I thought, look at all these people.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Keep this going.  The amount of workers, and it's going overnight, you know.  I want to go to this show so bad.  I'm going Wednesday.  Do you know what, logistically, how this would...  Am I going Wednesday?  Like the first time they set it up, how long it must have taken?  You said you want the VIP treatment.  I'm not going to the VIP.  Oh, you're not VIP?  No, I got tickets. 
[01:12:00]  They're down by the stage.  I really do want VIP treatment this year.  I know.  It sounds horrible to say that, but look, I'm usually a regular guy at a concert, but I  want kind of a better experience.  This is days going by.  Yeah.  They're hoisting up the stage.  It's a massive fucking stage.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, just, what are you doing?  I know they're putting a lot of people to work, but that's a lot of hundreds of millions  of dollars, just so you can see a big screen.  Yeah.  It really is just fucking amazing. 
[01:12:30]  I think it's just a million a day, just to have it out.  Just hanging out.  Just to have it there.  Yeah.  God damn, it's a big ass.  So it could look like a big spider-y thing.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And then you think of the Beatles playing Shea with some fucking amps on the field.  And they're fucking...  They didn't even have like a stage.  They're just standing on grass.  Wow.  Because their LED is like eight stories.  You wonder who it is that's in charge.  There's somebody who's in charge of the stage testing.  I think Willie Williams, the guy who always does every tour. 
[01:13:00]  Their tour manager.  Holy shit.  65,000 people a night, I think they do.  Yeah.  Wow.  And Jersey's like, it's going to be 100,000.  That fucking...  Wow.  That LED thing that drops down from the middle of that is fucking amazing.  Yeah.  I had one like that at my house.  No, you didn't.  I went to...  God damn, it's a light show.  I went to the Jersey show a year and a half ago, and it...  I had to leave at the Encore because, you know, the word got out that it was a two-hour wait  just to get out of the parking lot.  It shoved so many fucking people in there. 
[01:13:30]  I am Mr. Leave.  Two hours just to get out of the parking lot.  They call me the leave before the Encore key.  Really?  I never do.  I might listen to one fucking Encore song, and then I got to get the fuck out of there.  Well, I wouldn't...  And as I'm leaving, I'm smiling like, I'm glad I got the fuck out of there.  Clear sailing, no one in front of you.  It is a good feeling, but...  I mean, I wouldn't do that for you two normally, but I had to work the next day.  I was like, I can't sit in a parking lot for two hours just to get out of the parking lot.  I'd be...  And then there'd be traffic all the way back into New York City. 
[01:14:00]  But it wouldn't be two hours because football games happen.  No, because they're using all the...  Field too, right, right.  The field space too, so the parking lots can't really handle that many people.  Even the subway got overloaded.  It took us, me and my brother, like, almost close to four hours to get home.  Four hours to get home.  Popular band.  And just so people know, I mean, four hours, the stadium's maybe, what, five miles away?  Yeah.  Wow.  I just don't...  I don't think they stink.  I just don't like U2.  Their music does nothing for me. 
[01:14:30]  I've always loved U2.  I wish I did.  That would be a fun place to...  How do you not like Elevation?  What's Elevation?  I mean, it's not...  It's a new one.  It's a newer song.  I like Vertigo.  It's a good time.  And that Vertigo...  Play Elevation.  ...that's a newer song.  Like, that's very poppy and very catchy.  Yeah.  Right?  To show the thing getting taken down, too.  Wow.  Like ants.  You know this song, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, this is...  I'll tell you a minute.  I like this.  So far, I don't know it.  They stink.  I'm with Jimmy on this one. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah, I've heard this.  It's fine.  I like this song.  I wouldn't wait in traffic to see it.  Um, what'd you want to know?  Uh, how much money they're making a night?  Well, the tickets are $500, $250, $100.  I think the number was something like they're bringing in $10 million a night.  I think I saw Foghat for $8.  Yeah.  $500 for tickets?  For the floor.  Way to stay in touch with the common people.  Ha ha!  And they pack the place out. 
[01:15:30]  That's outrageous, though, to be honest with you.  At that point, download every fucking YouTube song for free.  If I'm going to pay $500 for a show, I have no guilt if I get free music.  No guilt in my soul.  Fuck that.  I don't think this song is awful, but it just...  That is a great song.  It bounces off my ears, and it doesn't move me at all.  Some of the older songs, too.  Fucking off. 
[01:16:00]  Joshua Tree.  What's the song of Josh?  Sunday Blessing is a good tune.  Where the streets have no name.  I don't know how that...  I don't know that song.  Really?  I'm sure I've heard it.  Let's hear that.  With or Without You?  That's a good tune.  Bolt to Blue Sky?  With or Without You is a good tune.  Ritz Elmining Town.  Stuff I've Found.  No.  I don't know those.  Oh, you fail.  Epic fail.  Oh.  Stuff I've Found.  Ticket receipts for one night.  How much?  $10 million.  Per night.  They've taken $10 million a night.  That's just tickets.  That doesn't include the $70 t-shirts that they're selling. 
[01:16:30]  Merch.  Oh, that's just the ticket sales.  That's just tickets.  Wow.  So when I heard $10 million a night, it's way more than that.  Because they're selling merch.  They sell $70 t-shirts?  Oh, my God.  $120 t-shirts.  No, they're not.  Yeah, they have limited edition t-shirts.  $120 fucking t-shirts.  Limited edition every night for $10 million.  How are they limited edition?  Because they'll make them...  10,000 t-shirt revenue.  Yeah, yeah.  10,000 people every night.  Well, Bruce does that, too.  He charges between $120 and $150.  That's disgusting.  Wait, what?  Yeah, they have them.  And this is my opinion.  And I've always liked YouTube, but that's disgusting.  It's unnecessary. 
[01:17:00]  But if people can afford it, it's fine.  But, you know...  They really can't, though.  Just say you're doing it for fucking dentists.  That's what this music is for.  It's for dentists.  Them and Dave Matthews should tour together.  We like rich white people!  Which is fine, but just say that.  Don't act like you're a man of the people.  You're not Africa, stupid.  People eat their own shit and consider it delicious.  Bono does a lot for Africa.  He does do a lot for Africa.  He used to be the go-to guy for the charities and shit.  Now, not so much.  He does a lot for charity. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, he's given probably more in a week than I'll give in my entire life.  Probably made more in a fucking minute.  But that's the problem that I have, is that he does a lot for charity, or says that he does  a lot for charity, and then he charges $120 for a limited edition t-shirt, you know?  Like, you don't need to do that.  They're super soft.  Oh, man.  Yeah!  Ah, are they soft?  And comfy?  How long is the fucking opening to this song?  It's long.  He-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el,  he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, he-el, we got it!  I love seeing this stuff through Jimmy's eyes. 
[01:18:00]  I know, it's good.  This song's been around for 20, almost 25 years at this point.  He-el, he-el, he-el, he-el.  What year?  87, I guess, so 24 years?  I think this album came out in 87.  I was just a kid when I went and saw that.  You gotta give these guys longevity, that's for sure.  Fuck yeah.  Holy fuck, they've been around forever.  79?  When MTV first came out, they were some of the first videos.  Were they?  Yeah.  And they're still fucking, not only around, but gigantic. 
[01:18:30]  When you go to such an underrated U2 album is that Rattle and Hump.  That Rattle and Hump has some great songs that never made radio.  Okay.  I don't know this song.  You don't know this song.  Turn it up a little bit.  Jimmy, just walking through life, you've had to have heard this song. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just didn't read it.  I heard the chorus.  I've heard it.  Bond on the edge is doing Letterman on Monday.  One is fucking great.  So why don't we get him on the show?  They're Spider-Man.  That's one.  Spider-Man?  No, no, they're promoting Spider-Man.  That's why they promote it on this fucking radio show.  It's obviously a shitty fucking disaster.  Maybe because I just said that.  These guys don't do radio.  It's amazing.  Do you know how much someone told me, a promoter, a promoter told me how much they need to sell  out to even break even because of the disaster that they've had? 
[01:19:30]  They shouldn't just do Letterman.  How about you fucking switch it up and do radio?  I would shit my pants if Bond walked in that door.  That's one where I would lose my mind.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck it.  I would be starstruck.  There's not many.  I would be fine talking to him because I'm not a fan.  There's not many.  I would just fucking be an idiot.  Like you are with Ozzy.  That would be me.  I can interview Ozzy, though.  I don't think I can interview Bond.  I love interviewing guys like that.  Then again, I can't interview anyone.  Right, guys?  I love talking to him. 
[01:20:00]  I would lose my mind in front of Bono.  I'll be honest.  Is there a guy you would lose your mind in front of it?  He has to be even dead since the 40s.  Is there one?  In music, I guess.  In music?  For Jimmy, it's Ozzy.  For me, I would have to say Bono's number one.  No, anyone could walk in here.  I'd give a shit.  How about Mick Jagger?  That would be pretty big, yeah.  But I mean...  Paul McCartney. 
[01:20:30]  I was in the toilet with half the stones.  True.  Paul McCartney is big, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But I could talk to him.  I wouldn't be able to like...  I wouldn't freak out.  I'm bad with fucking, you know,  dumb little B-movie starlets.  They're the ones that I get all fucked up over.  I'm an idiot.  With or without you?  Is it with or without you?  Guys.  Oh, there's one.  No, there's one.  One is really good.  Jesus Christ.  I wasn't listening closely.  Yeah, this is good.  They played this one right after 9-11.  And when we went to go see him. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  I was booing.  Boo!  Boo!  And they had a giant scream with all the names going by.  Yeah.  All the people that died on 9-11.  Not a dry eye in the house.  Well, of course not.  The concert was on September 12th.  I know.  It was like the 12th.  And they decided...  It's like, thanks, guys.  Yeah, let's put this stage together.  That was fucked, man.  Is that the garden they did that?  Yeah.  Yeah, they just showed...  When you see the names going by on a scroll...  It was just like, oh, God.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That was a creative thing to do.  Wow.  No one's looking at each other. 
[01:21:30]  It was all uncomfortable.  Guys, Will in Banger, Maine, he says...  Does he?  He says, you two sucks.  Move on, guys.  We better move on.  We better move on, because Will doesn't like it.  Will doesn't like it.  Talking about one of the greatest bands of all time.  Or, you know, I'll say this.  One of the most successful bands of all time.  Yeah, they are.  But Will doesn't like them.  So we better move on.  Are they bigger than the Stones touring?  Because the Stones do fucking stadiums, too, and sell out.  No, at this point, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, but the Stones are probably a little older  and probably would have trouble doing three straight years of touring.  But, I mean, as far as sales...  But they just based this on years.  What's that?  Like, U2 was the highest grossing last year.  So if the Stones, you know, tour next year...  I mean, I think they were the...  Could the Stones sell the same amount of tickets worldwide?  Absolutely, yeah.  I kind of figured it.  They play the exact same venues as U2.  They do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw my giant stadium.  I mean, ACDC was number two behind U2.  Wow, yeah.  Out of any band in the world.  Yeah, ACDC's very underrated on the grand scale. 
[01:22:30]  Look at the names going by.  We got the video up.  You can check it out for yourself on YouTube.  Oh, that was so bad.  Oh, yeah, they list them.  NYPD, FD.  And it starts, and then it just...  It just didn't end.  It kept going and going, and it's like,  oh, my God, this is torture.  And then you look around,  and everyone was fucking tearing up or crying.  It's like, yeah, thanks, U2.  Trying to have a good fucking time.  We're trying to forget about this stuff.  Thanks.  Oh, that was Super Bowl Halftime Show 2002.  Did they do that there, too? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but they did it way before the Super Bowl.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that where this is?  Yeah.  Yeah, they did it when it was still fucking fresh.  Real fresh.  It's amazing how the Edge and Bono,  everybody knows, but nobody...  I don't know the other names of the guys.  Larry Mullen.  Larry what?  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Oh, that's good.  One T, one B, one I, two Ls, one T, one E, one T,  one L, one E, a bunch of wise Bill Tetley. 
[01:23:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  One Ford for good boys.  One Ford for naughty boys.  the youtube version yeah holy fuck hey is it true that you two doesn't file taxes  they found a tax loophole i got it i got you find a loophole making that much money steven jersey go  ahead steve yes hello i'm gay i was on vacation in dublin and the newspapers and the people 
[01:24:00]  over there talk about the fact that with bono talking about taking care of your fellow man  they incorporated they moved their incorporation to i believe it's the netherlands to avoid the  extra high taxes oh man why would that drive me crazy good good for them people being able to keep  their own money wow that drives me fucking batshit please to take take half their money and fucking 
[01:24:30]  give it to somebody ireland's probably higher i love when people are able to do that good for them  can we do that yeah really that's what i want to know hey bob how are they able to do that but we  can't work on it but isn't that great though they fucking their own country couldn't keep them there  it's like what a fucking embarrassing yeah they go to the netherlands the netherlands how does the  netherlands make money talk about how they you know he talks a big game bono great band but uh  doesn't practice what he preaches but is that true though i'm saying but the guy does do a lot of 
[01:25:00]  charity work and you know what he's a multi-millionaire but he kind of deserves to be a multi-millionaire  fucking you're saying doesn't practice what he preaches why given the government the money is is  a great way to take care of people all the fucking uh misappropriation of funds and graft and fucking  corruption fuck that i'd rather keep all my money uh and and dole it out as i please to who needs it  and i think he does practice what he preaches because if he's saving so much money on taxes he's 
[01:25:30]  probably giving a little extra in charity i would imagine it makes it easier to give up money  uh for charities i'm with you on that i live in jersey so i pay a shitload of taxes so  yeah no shit stupid new york and fucking new jersey yep city tax dick yeah take that fudge to the store  i remember that's what i say when i'm mad take that fudge home with you and chew on it language  i remember one of our guys he was on the youtube detail when i saw them at uh the garden a few years 
[01:26:00]  back yeah and someone's got to help me out with this loophole they have to they have to get off  u.s soil by a certain fucking time like they they're not if they're in the united states for uh too many  days or something like that yeah i'm trying to remember the story they consider residents something  like that so the it so happened the madison square garden show i went to and i was with this person  he's like they're not coming back for an encore because they have to be off the ground by midnight 
[01:26:30]  all right right or or there's some incredible penalty they have to pay oh wow and and it is a  race to the airport because they they were they were cutting it really really close and and not  only do they have to get to the airport they have to be off the fucking ground and if anyone knows  the story because i'm not they have to play mexico for like two days where what they go mexico for  two days yeah then they mexico there's no t and z in that word i can't help you out with that  loophole but i can't help you out with the kiss but roll is on to it because they can't hang out 
[01:27:00]  in the state so they have to leave for a whatever it is a couple days then they come back and then  they could start over again yeah yeah if anyone knows what that's about consecutive days makes  you a resident i think it's a three-month work visa yeah maybe it's that yeah that makes sense i was  gonna say you have to have a work visa but this master square garden show uh one of our pals was on  the detail to get them to the airport where you know they had they had the sirens and everything  giving them the the presidential treatment like their business is based in ireland so i would assume  that they have right work visa well jonathan said what they do is they when you leave because he said 
[01:27:30]  he had to leave before the encore because all the cars get ready because they go from the stage  giant towels are thrown on them right into the cars out and he goes then then when you're you're in  this police motorcade and then they peel off from you like the band and a couple other cars i guess  and they go right to a helicopter and he's saying they fly from anaheim to fucking like cedar sinai or  something or some hospital in fucking la and then they go right to the chateau marmont which is  where they stay and you know it took me forever to figure this out but you know when you go to a 
[01:28:00]  concert there's the encore but there's the long delay and then it's the encore and then they do  the encore and they keep the lights down yeah and making you think they're going to come out again  right that's so they could get the fuck out of the venue and not be stuck in the concert traffic  i finally figured that one out sitting there going i think they're gonna do one more coming  out for one more you know how they dramatically keep the lights down then they finally pop the  lights on me concert over everyone gets pissed that's so those fuckers uh don't get caught in  the traffic i like to stand there and try to get like a crowd like as everybody's filing out of the 
[01:28:30]  i'll stand there and go one more song one more song how's that work out not well not well no one  ever gets the rally cry going with me the one more yeah as everybody's filing out i'm like one more song  how douchey  okay here we go heather knows a little bit about what i'm talking about from long island heather  hey now my husband works for customs and he deals with paul mccartney a lot when he comes in he 
[01:29:00]  escorts him because he's a hooker  mccartney fucks him in the mouth  she's just playing with that voice  or they won't they'll be banned for five years so if they have a visa they have to leave a certain day  they have to be out or they're not allowed back in the country for five years  and i'm sure they're just here on traveling right you know not a work or something like that so  they have they have to be out how's fucking how's how's wrong concoma 
[01:29:30]  how's wrong concoma yeah where the what town are you from  lindenhurst oh all right whatever and then brian thank you and brian saying  30 days per quarter they could stay in the u.s  30 days per quarter if they're working i guess because i mean bono kind of lives here now  he's got a place in the upper west oh does he yeah he's been known to walk around a little bit 
[01:30:00]  then he can wing on over to london jam with the stones they hitchhike him and the edge  will hitchhike sometimes oh wouldn't that be great if they got ass raped and yeah  sean penn does that too but there's such an arrogance to that because  it's a celebrity looking to make the day of a commoner yes because they're so recognizable  they know that almost anybody who picks them up will know who they are yeah and there's such a  pomposity that would be great to just not even acknowledge it it's where you're going  yeah drive yeah and then they'd start like yeah you know we just got to get to rehearsal

This makes me feel like Christmas.  Yeah, this makes me want to eat a sugar cookie.  It really does.  Commit a sodomy outside of school.  With a Santa hat on. 
[01:36:00]  This makes me want to lure a youngster  into my vehicle in a Santa hat  and show him my Peter.  What do you think of them apples?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, if I smear eggnog on the helmet.  What were we singing about  when we did the cover of this?  I heard it not recently.  Was it, let's see.  It just made me laugh because I heard it.  It was just mean.  Anybody down there remember?  As I look at the...  We were using alternate lyrics. 
[01:36:30]  Of course we were.  That's half the gags we do here.  Can we break?  No one recollects, huh?  We'll figure it out.  We'll have the answer after the break.  Can you better get me some yogurt?  La la.  I'd like to have some blueberries.  La la la la.  Get me a little bit of...  What is that shit called  that you put inside?  La la la.  The crunchy stuff I like.  La la la.  No la. 
[01:37:00]  Granola la la.  My granola la la la.  Nice vomit colored jacket.  La la la la.  Look like you pulled that off the fucking...  Looks like the priest wore that on his neck  and the exorcist.  Fa la la la la.  You're dressed like an idiot.  Fa la la la la.  Loose fitting cadaver jacket.  La la la la.  Stupid stiff cop shoes.  Fa la la la la.  Dry haired idiot.  Fa la la la la.  The people skills of a hornet. 
[01:37:30]  Fa la la la la.  Sound like lurch.  Fa la la la la.  You're just unpleasant.  Fa la la la la.  Even people who like you  don't like you.  La la.  I'm fucking kidding.  Attention to details,  but no human interaction.  La la's.  You walk with an idiot's 
[01:38:00]  gate for la la la.  I can't even look down.  Holy fuck, man.  You know that you threw off  his whole day today?  You have no idea?  That's classic.  I was in the car  and I was checking my Twitter  and I read your Reverend Al Sharpton tweet  and I went,  oh, Jimmy has landed.  And it was 5.30.  Eighth probably in that area, right?  No. 
[01:38:30]  That's what's important.  5.32.  I go, oh, Jimmy landed.  Kenny goes,  he's not supposed to land  until 5.37.  Oh, boy.  And I looked down,  I'm like,  that's going to fucking ruin  your day now, isn't it?  Because he didn't land properly.  Obsessed with the numbers.  Fa la la la la.  Wouldn't know a hug  if he tripped over it.  La la la.  But he can give you numbers.  Fa la la la la.  Knocking all the jigs  with a nightstick.  La la la.  Knocking people up  with a phone book.  La la la.  Look, he misses those 
[01:39:00]  good old days.  Fa la la la.  So we all have to suffer.  Fa la la la la.  Because he can't beat up people.  La la la la.  Black shoes,  black laces.  Fa la la la la.  Head like a Doberman.  La la la la.  His jeep looks like  it just drove off  the showroom.  La la la.  Obsessed with neatness.  Fa la la la la.  Hasn't eaten a salad  since 1970. 
[01:39:30]  La la.  Shits are hard  like pebbles.  Fa la la la la.  Little asphalt duties.  Fa la la la la.  Have a glass of water.  Ya la la la la.  He doesn't even drink water.  Doesn't even have an iPod.  La la la la.  Could fall asleep  during a nuclear attack.  Fa la la.  Wakes everyone up  with his apnea la la la.  Oh fuck. 
[01:40:00]  Why do we beat up  the ones we love?  Why do we do it?  Oh my god.  He breathes like  Travis's dog la la la.  You did the suit color, right?  Of course.  Suit like vomit.  That really is awful.  He's a Doberman.  It's awful.  He's a Doberman  without the ears.  Danny just put a Doberman  picture next to Kenny.  He's a Doberman  without the ears.  It's uncanny.  Unless you go sideways  then he's the angelfish. 
[01:40:30]  He's a dog from the omen.  Fa la la la la.  Looking out for Damien.  Fa la la la la.  Here he comes.  Look at him.  Oh my god.  Jesus Christ.  Got a gate like  Sasquatch.  Fa la la la la.  Jacket.  Jacket color of boogers.  Fa la la la la.  He said I'll  I'll take a size 52  in flu.  Fa la la.  Fa la la.  Do you have any 
[01:41:00]  flu covered coats?  Colored boo.  Fa la la la la.  Hi Kenny.  Hey Kenny.  Thank you.  Bye.  Somebody pissed  on my blueberries.  La la la la.  Oh fuck.  Holy shit.  That was funny.  Are you done?  Is that what you want to say?  No.  You keep going  for another two hours. 
[01:41:30]  He could.  I'm hoping he does.  Oh just flow.  Less work for us.  That is a fine suit.  I think.  Flu.  That's up.  His flu colored jacket.  Oh Kenny.  Sorry.  It's hard to do  when you're in the room. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Can you leave the room?  Yeah just for a second.  Just for a second.  Okay there you go.  Listen with your earpiece  for la la la la la.  Like you're in the secret service  but you're not la la la.  You're guarding this  hacky radio show la la.  Yeah.  Threat level zero.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Big clumsy fingers  on a blackberry la la.  Always typing double letters  la la la la.  Exactly five meatballs  for la la la la. 
[01:42:30]  Exact number of scoops  for la la la la.  Holy shit.  Did he do the grilled chicken thing?  That's all he eats.  No does he?  Oh my god.  Nothing but just plain grilled chicken.  Never a vegetable.  And he'll treat himself  to maybe a potato  every once in a while.  Oh god.  It's the same.  We'll go to these  amazing restaurants  and he orders  the worst thing possible. 
[01:43:00]  Oh god damn.  Wow.  Well you know  it's when you point it out  in song like that Jimmy  that it really all comes together.  But he was bothered  that you landed  before 5.37  and I asked him  is this going to ruin your day?  I never got the answer  by the way.  I think he was a little  annoyed by me.  Because something changes  in him  when the number  isn't exact.  That was very good.  He gives Jimmy  a wake up call  at 5.30  and if it's 5.31  he is so bothered  that he missed the 5.30. 
[01:43:30]  First voice you hear  of the day  la la la  good luck  not being manically  depressed  la la la  it's like the Grim Reaper  chatting with you  la la la la  65 mini ketchups  la la la  he loves  those little  he's a hoarder  and doesn't know it  la la la  saves everything  but fun  la la la  he couldn't  find a hug  if he tripped 
[01:44:00]  over him  there's no affection  there whatsoever  he's like a  talking Venus  flytrap  for la la la la  did he do  the invoice one yet?  an invoice like  the New York Times  la la la  Sunday edition  for la la la la  we get these  invoices from Kenny  it's like we trust you  just fucking  they are exact  they're exact  to the penny 
[01:44:30]  to the penny  they're exact  Kenny's a great  record keeper  food  I got work  food  travel  hotel  I'll ask him  to maybe  do something  over the week  I can't  I got a lot  of paperwork  to catch up on  paperwork  these invoices  that we already  trust them  they got me  pushing a pencil  it's you  who's they  exactly  that's lots of  crayons  have you  push it in  your eye  exactly  fuck 
[01:45:00]  oh boy  I say we go  home early  because it's  not going to  get better  than what  Jimmy just  did  that's about  it  what are you  thinking  I'm game  is our boss  still in Africa  I guess  oh god  I bless malaria  in Africa  hey there's  horrible things  that could  happen in  Africa  I'm rooting  lion  lion attack  I'm rooting  for lion  this time  around  yeah  oh yeah 
[01:45:30]  I don't know  maybe some  of that  fucking  what do you  think  some of that  Ebola  that hits  pretty quick  oh yeah  that'd be  great  the doctor  could sit  there and  go yeah  you got  it  you got  it  you got  it  you got  it  blood's  coming out  of his  eyes  one minute  you're waving  at a rhino  the next minute  another pair  of white pants  spoiled  oh boy  this is not  good  yes  I knew I  shouldn't have  shared that  banana with a  monkey  they warned me  against that  but he offered 
[01:46:00]  it to me  and I took  one from the  little fella  what would be  the worst  trampling  banana fucking  monkey gums  what would be  the worst  trampling  you think  in Africa  Bob Kelly  on his way  to the buffet  would he go  rhino over elephant  I'd go rhino  over elephant  elephant just  six tons  but there's room  under an elephant  where you can  maybe you know  when elephants  put their head  down and  fucking like  start bashing you  with that giant  fucking  show me a  rocky dentist  skull  I think you  could survive  fucking elephants  and those big 
[01:46:30]  giant heads  I think if an  elephant's coming  at you you  could make some  moves and  survive possibly  a trampling  I hear hippos  though are worse  than anything  like hippos  kill more people  where there's hippos  than any other  animal  you know why  it's because  they look so  friendly and hungry  hungry hippo  the people think  they can walk up  and fuck him  at the watering hole  they try to feed  him marbles  do you know  how many hippos  turn around  and bite men  trying to fuck  him in the ass  at the watering hole  because people  see the little  fucking bird  on the tail  they're like  oh this is a  friendly animal  it's gotta be  friendly 
[01:47:00]  I like to be  bird's fucking  I might as well  join in  they got some  like that mouth  would you deal  with that  it looks like  fucking predator  it looks like  a horseshoe crab  looks like Shane  McGowan  oh my god  that's a great  callback  yeah from 10  years ago  he's had new  teeth since the  60s  that's not nice  yeah I see  some little racist  picture there  why is that racist  if the guy looks 
[01:47:30]  like he's got  a hippo mouth  how is that racist  it's a picture  of that black guy  with his mouth  open real wide  wearing a straw hat  yeah  because it's one  of them  boobily boobily  pictures  from the  oldie days  a hippo  with his mouth  open  yeah  oh god  wow  yeah that would  I think elephants  when you watch  some of those  when animals  attack things  and you see  an elephant  like fucking  some guy up  you can't get  away from him 
[01:48:00]  like the guy's  trying to stand  up and run  and the elephant  just hits him  with his big  giant head  picture your  escalade jumping  on you  on purpose  holy shit  yeah that would  do it  and it's not  lazy when it  when it doesn't  you know  when it  it's not  whatever  yeah  no it  it is  those things  are fucking  deadly  when they get  usually it's  just slow  and lazy  until it  has to take  care of something  then they got  some get up  and go  oh yeah  yes  oh wow 
[01:48:30]  that was funny  couch of zilchers  today in a half hour  great  Kenny treats  those people nice  right  when they come in  he reads them  the riot act  before they come in  they're so scared  they don't even  want to talk  the whole  the whole object  of the couch of zilchers  by the way  is to have people  come in off the street  and relax  because we can't have  a live audience  relax and enjoy  themselves for an hour  enjoy themselves  talk about themselves  shit like that  but Kenny tells them  just shut your mouths  and sit there  there are guests 
[01:49:00]  fa la la la la  you shove them  into boxcars  fa la la la la  send them off  to family camp  fa la la la la  supposed to be fun  fa la la la  they have a nice  experience don't they  yeah but they  it's like half the time  we're spent  trying to fucking  deprogram them  so they can talk  wow animals  look at these  fucking elephants  just swimming  in deep water  I love when elephants  I love when trainers  get trampled  I love when animal  trainers get trampled

[02:03:30]  Thank you. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why?  We watched the walk down the hall. 
[02:04:30]  But why did she stop by?  Just to say hi or something?  She's not part of our show anymore.  Just because I figured I'd say hello.  You want to bring her in first?  Yeah, my problem.  And then we got David from Israel.  Who calls the show a lot.  He's in New York, obviously, and he decided to stop by and say hi to us.  Yes.  You want to go with Patty first?  And then slowly get the couch of zilchers in here.  That sounds good.  And we also have Bobo outside holding an envelope.  What?  Oh, I know it's in there. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Patty.  Patty.  I really want to know why she stopped by.  Well, you can ask her.  She's right here.  Hey, Patty.  Why didn't you stop by?  Oh, my God.  What happened to your leg?  What's wrong with your knee?  Just to say hello.  What?  Just to say hello.  See?  I knew it.  Why are you saying hello to us?  We're not friends.  Oh, boy.  And you used to do our show many years ago.  Like, you just stopped by to say hello?  Yeah.  Remember when she used to do the show?  She'd do things. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, now she's like, you go back to Johnny Carson.  Yeah, yeah.  When the stand-up guys don't have to do their stand-up anymore.  They just sit down on the couch.  They just kind of sit down and tell a story.  It's like, hey, just stop by to say hi, Johnny.  I consider myself a friend of the show.  Coin city yourself.  What?  Coin city yourself.  I'm a friend of the show.  That was hilarious.  You're not our friend.  You're not our friend.  You're wearing fucking...  I'm your friend.  I'm not your friend.  I'm your friend.  I'm not your friend.  Let me name some friends of the show. 
[02:06:00]  Can I ask you a question?  What six-year-old child shoes are these?  Why are you asking me?  Are they mine?  No, that's what she's wearing right now.  Oh, really?  Purple laceless shoes.  You have purple laceless, like, big clown sneakers on?  Where did you get those from?  Let me see, Pat.  Where did you get them from?  Let me just take a look.  Oh, those are atrocious.  Can I see them?  See if you're going bowling at Prince's house. 
[02:06:30]  Is it purple?  Why no laces?  That's the style, man.  Yeah, it's the style.  It's the style.  Oh, you scuffed them?  Oh, we don't step on our scuffer shoe.  What's the matter, Patty?  You're looking annoyed today.  Are you happy to be here?  Happy to be here.  Yeah, I mean, I just came by to say hello.  Yeah, but it's weird just to stop by and say hello.  Why did you scuff your shoe, though?  Hello?  Is it me you're looking for?  Because they wonder where you were. 
[02:07:00]  When she says, is it me you're looking for?  The fist says yes.  I give 100% support to the show.  You know, the religion names I speak very highly of.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  You used to do things, though, for the show.  Yeah, why don't you do things?  Remember?  Yeah.  It's a matter of the bones getting a little brittle these days.  Can't crawl around naked anymore.  Yeah.  Hurts the hips.  Oh, my God.  How old are you now?  Your skin is like rolling paper now.  I'm 56.  It's gotten so thin.  I'm 56?  Yes, I am.  Patty looks good for 56, man. 
[02:07:30]  I just turned in a month ago.  Nice clavicle.  Holy shit.  Well, I'm 56.  I don't expect...  Still a virgin, too, right?  Like I was 30.  Yeah, I am.  Technically.  You're like the visible woman fucking model.  Remember the visible woman?  It was encased in plastic, and you could see all the organs inside?  Jimmy...  You're really pale.  If Patty had sex at 56 and the guy had AIDS, how long would it take?  It would be the greatest story of all time. 
[02:08:00]  But how long would it take to kill her at this point?  Hopefully 30 minutes.  Do you want to pat my penis?  I don't...  You can pat it if you want to.  That's one of the reasons why I don't date.  I'm just afraid to...  Do you want to pat my penis?  Too many things happen.  Too many things.  I really am.  I actually fear it.  It's not hard.  Do you want to pat my...  We're playing...  It's a new game.  It's called Pat a Penis.  You have to pat the penis.  Like Pat Patterson.  Dude, my name isn't Sandy Kane, you know.  Oh.  I know that.  She comes into our store. 
[02:08:30]  Go ahead.  Just give it a pat.  It's not hard.  It's soft.  Will you pat Jimmy's penis?  Just give it a little pat.  Why?  We have no interest in what you're saying right now.  Just pat Jimmy's penis.  Just pat it.  Like it's a small dog.  Just pat it.  Just pat it.  Just go like this.  I'm embarrassed.  Yeah, go ahead.  Pat the penis, Patty.  Pat the penis.  Come on, Patty.  Fuck the penis.  If he didn't want it, he wouldn't be, you know, it would be embarrassing.  Come on, Patty.  Pat the penis, Patty.  Come on.  Don't make his ass cold day.  Come on, Patty.  Just give it a pat.  Just do it.  Give it a friendly hello.  Come on. 
[02:09:00]  Pat the penis, you goose.  Patty, come on.  Pat the penis.  Patty.  Hi.  Little Pat.  Patty, just do it.  And not just one little thing.  Pat it like three or four times like a dog head.  Like that.  Like that.  Go.  Come on.  Pat the penis.  Go ahead.  It's not fun.  Patty, go.  Go ahead.  It's not hard.  Pat the penis.  Do it.  Go ahead.  Patty, stop fucking laughing and do it.  Yeah, Pat the penis.  Go ahead.  Enough.  I don't like this wasting time shit.  Just a little Pat.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just give the fuck you've been naked in our studio millions of times.  Go ahead. 
[02:09:30]  Go ahead.  You have touched it before.  Pat his penis.  Give it a little pat-a-roo.  Pat the penis.  Go ahead.  Don't slap it.  You're giving up like there's a fly on it.  Just give it a little pat like that.  Come on.  Jimmy's wearing his flying sweatpants.  Yeah.  When he flies.  He loves sweatpants.  Yeah, just put your hand in his little pat.  He's a bit filled up.  It's poking out a little bit.  A little bit.  Come on, Patty.  Come on.  Oh, she gave it two pats.  Nah, nah.  Yeah, it seemed like she had the answer on Family Feud.  Will you pat the penis properly? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Patty.  I'm going to pass out.  What?  Why?  From what?  From what?  Is your vagina becoming engorged?  Are you on the doped?  No.  She's high.  What's the matter?  Patty's fucking high.  Patty's doped up.  Yeah, you don't seem the same as you used to.  Are you doped up?  No, I'm not.  You're on some kind of medication?  What are you on, Patty?  No.  You're on NyQuil?  Are you a shit dick?  Are you a Peter Puffer?  No, suck dicks.  No, I think that's enough. 
[02:10:30]  I just don't do that.  Can you put your lips on Jimmy's penis?  Through the sweatpants.  Give Jimmy a blowjob.  It's all safe.  Give Jimmy a blowjob.  Can her lips touch the penis?  No.  Let me ask you, Patty.  Would you do this?  Fuck this.  Stop it by and saying hi shit.  Through the sweats.  Would you kiss the penis through the sweats?  Oh, through the sweats.  Because I'm not like that.  How much money do you need?  What do you like, then?  Yeah, what do you like?  I don't know.  I just don't want to be seen in that.  What if a guy does it before you do it?  As what, a good egg? 
[02:11:00]  Jesus.  Who would do it on staff, do you think?  It's nobody.  What?  And he gets to kiss Jimmy's penis through his sweats.  You think I would let these guys kiss my penis through my sweatpants?  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  You would let Bobo, right?  I wouldn't let that fucking blithering idiot.  Patty, we don't like this stopping by and saying hi shit anymore.  Yeah, you've got to do something.  You know what?  It's good to see you, I guess.  Boy, did a big fatso just walk by.  I just feel I'm a friend and supporter.  Well, what kind of friend doesn't kiss a friend's penis? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, really.  That's a friend.  Hey, buddy.  Get on your knees.  Just get comfortable.  Get on your knees.  That's all we're saying.  On your knees right in front of Jimmy.  Get on your knees.  Why?  Are you going to do something?  Oh, no.  No, of course not.  We want you to check under the console.  Get on your fucking knees.  Why?  I'm not going to assault you.  I won't touch you.  Think old Patty.  No, this is all Patty stuff.  Old school Patty.  Patty, you have the say, you know?  You do what you want.  You had fingers in your vagina and your asshole on our side. 
[02:12:00]  Me and Ron Jeremy on the old NW touched Patty's vagina.  And you've touched a lot of Ron Jeremy's penis.  I knew I was a virgin right away.  Well, you touched Ron Jeremy's dick.  Yeah.  Well, there was a good ticket there.  How do you get your neck to look like that?  You're Patty makes his weird face like the juicy.  And her neck goes like this.  Get on your knees.  You make the face like what people make when they first get tased?  My knees.  There.  Okay, I'm on my knees. 
[02:12:30]  All right, there you go.  All right, you're on your knees.  Now, Jimmy, walk over.  All you have to do is...  There you go.  I'm just going to stand at the mic.  Jimmy's got his sweats on.  All I have to do is kiss his penis.  Yeah.  You're not going to be in contact with skin or nothing.  Just a little peck.  Through my sweatpants.  Can I just kiss your tummy?  No.  No, right through the sweatpants.  You can't kiss my tummy.  Just a little peck.  Go ahead.  I can't do it.  Yeah, you can.  How could it...  I can.  I can.  I'll think of all the stuff that'll be on...  On what?  On what? 
[02:13:00]  On the internet, then, you know?  There's no cameras.  Phil, no one's taking pictures.  Yeah, I know about that one.  No, you don't, asshole.  There's no fucking pictures.  You said there was a camera up there.  What?  There's no...  Are you high?  She's nuts.  Patty's high.  She is high.  Patty, you're a drug addict.  You're high on something.  No, I'm not.  Your eyes are all...  You're all Chinese eyes.  I've never drank.  I think Patty's on meds.  Yeah, you got meds in you.  No, actually, uh...  You got some meds in you. 
[02:13:30]  You know.  Patty's a junkie.  You got some meds in you.  Patty, we gotta get...  What do you got?  Some psychotropic drugs?  What do you got?  Nothing.  Antidepressants?  What are you on?  No, I don't take it.  What are you on?  Uppers, doubters, yellows.  Is Annie the nanny?  Well, I take his heart medication.  That's it.  Oh, yeah?  What do you take for your heart?  Hopefully cocaine pills.  Hopefully butter.  Caffeine.  Okay.  You know, I just have a...  She takes the yellow jackets.  Yeah, you keep talking.  Shut up, dude. 
[02:14:00]  There's a million lines in there.  Will you kiss Jimmy's penis through the sweatpants?  Go ahead.  You can't get any diseases.  You don't get any diseases.  The sweatpants.  Yeah.  They were freshly laundered, those sweatpants.  I'll bet I'll see a picture of it right on page one.  You're not.  Page one of what?  Page one of what?  Yeah.  The New York blech.  There's no camera.  There's no fucking camera in here.  Get the camera.  I can't.  Jimmy, just kiss his penis.  Just kiss right through the sweats.  Through the fabric.  It's right there.  No, I can't. 
[02:14:30]  Kiss it through the fabric.  What do you mean you can't?  Get your lips on his turgy penis.  Kiss the underside of my crown through the fabric.  No, this is what might happen.  What's going to happen?  This is why I don't want you around anymore.  Believe me, my dick is not going to budge.  It's exhausting.  What do you want?  Should I jump?  Don't count on it.  I got Dramamine dick today.  It would be hysterical if it just shot a load all over our glasses bukkake style.  It just fell off into my sock.  Like I had to have my cock reattached and it looked for a garbage disposal. 
[02:15:00]  Jimmy, I'm not saying you would allow this, but can I at least ask Bobo if he would do this?  You can ask him.  Open the door.  Open the door.  Yes.  Bobo, would you kiss Jimmy's penis?  Come on, stupid.  No, no, not in.  Not in.  Right there.  Would you kiss Jimmy's penis?  I would for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  See?  See, that's a go-getter right there.  Yeah, Patty used to be that person.  Patty used to be that person.  Yeah, remember Patty?  Now we have a mo-getter.  Remember Patty?  All right.  I'm going to sit down. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I did a lot of crazy things.  Yeah.  What have you done for us lately?  I don't like the fact your shins have junky fucking heroin marks on them.  How did that happen?  Who shoots dope out of the front of their shins?  No, I did a lot on the pavement because the sidewalk was in two levels.  While were you running, was somebody holding a mirror up?  You could sue the city and be rich now.  No, nobody.  No, I wouldn't do that.  There were no witnesses.  Step on a crack.  Your mother leaves you at a diner.  There were no witnesses.  It doesn't rhyme, but it's accurate.  You know, I can't prove it. 
[02:16:00]  Well, I was there at the foundling center.  Patty, kiss Jimmy's penis or we're going to have to show you the door.  And I mean the door to the outside.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  I just got to kiss it right through the sweats.  I'm going to do it for the show.  Yeah.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  There you go.  Right through the sweats.  And he wants to know if you're hooked on goofballs.  No.  I never took drugs in my life.  Right.  Literal Patty. 
[02:16:30]  Because I want to live that long life.  I don't want to die.  We weren't looking for an answer.  It's the greatest thing that Patty does.  She answers everything.  All right.  Here you go.  But it's not what I am.  Just do it for the show.  Of course it's not.  Just do it for the show.  Kiss the crown.  Just kiss the crown.  That's all you got to do.  No.  No.  That wasn't.  She got it.  She got close to the base.  I didn't even feel it.  Just Patty.  And a little longer.  Yeah.  Just a little longer.  Just go ahead.  Right there. 
[02:17:00]  Go ahead.  And then rub your cheek on it.  Just do it a little longer.  Have her rub her cheek on it.  Yeah.  And then rub your cheek on it.  Yeah.  What?  You give it a kiss and then you rub your cheek on it.  Rub just fucking a little longer.  You got to kiss it.  For the show.  Through the sweats.  Go ahead.  For the show.  There's the kiss.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  That had the sex appeal of now I lay me down to sleep.  Ha ha ha.  I rub herpes across my cheek.  It's got a blurry picture. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, look at that whore.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, whore.  Look at a picture of a whore.  Let me see.  Picture of a whore.  Blurry.  Oh, wow.  That one's going on Twitter right now.  Hester Prynne.  That one's going on Twitter right now.  Yeah, Patty.  Hey.  Hey.  Jezebel.  If a slut's going to fucking kiss another man.  I'm not a slut.  What?  I'm not a slut.  You just kissed his dick.  Yeah, Patty.  She had age-tested.  Under pressure.  All whore pictures go up on Twitter.  Under pressure.  More pressure.  We didn't tell you.  I don't have to tell you to do anything.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  I don't care what you do.  Yeah, relax with that under-pressure shit.  Exactly.  Stop acting like a victim, you kneeling cock kisser.  I don't do things like that, pal.  Shut up.  I just feel that I'm not 30 years old.  What?  You know.  Well, if you were 30, what does that mean?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  I actually lived more years than I'm going to live.  I mean, that's how I'm seeing my age.  So it's kind of like...  That's stupid.  Yeah, you've always lived more years than you're going to live.  A lady died on the island. 
[02:18:30]  She was 110.  I wish I could be like that, but...  Oh, yeah.  Just stay a boring virgin that long.  She's pretty good in the picture, too.  Imagine if Patti started fucking in her late 60s and only liked uncut fucking dick over  nine.  Can we stick fingers in you today?  Fingers?  I think I went over the limit as this.  Is she sitting on the couch and zilchers today?  Yeah, I like Patti.  All right, Patti, take a seat on the couch.  I never had one bad thing to say about you guys ever, you know? 
[02:19:00]  I always supported you and spoke highly of you.  Well, thanks.  That means people are speaking badly about us.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just...  She's babbling.  There it is, Patti.  There's your whore picture right up there on Twitter.  I'm not a whore.  There it is.  That is...  I am not a whore.  It's right there.  Well...  It's like Anthony Cumia on Twitter.  Just my name.  You know, one funny thing.  Of course.  I never got 60 followers on Twitter in three days before. 
[02:19:30]  Usually it'd take me about two months to get that.  Holy shit.  What's your Twitter name?  Whore Cockkisser.  It's Brooksy.  What?  But nobody really...  It's Brooksy?  Not too many people know that.  Brooksy.  Hopefully it'll work out the same way.  Brooksy was here.  I mean, I was holding steady at 862.  She babbles like a Brooke.  She really does.  And that took three years.  Three years to get 800.  We got Stalker Voss checking in.  I've never had a drink, drug, or penis in my body for 50, 60 years. 
[02:20:00]  Everybody's got to clap.  By the way...  Thank you, Queen.  Do you know you can catch sexually communicable diseases through pants like that?  Did.  Not can.  Because fluid will go through.  I don't think so.  I know the facts regarding that.  Oh, do you?  Yeah, I do.  So you don't think fluid passing through the pants can get on your mouth and give you some  type of disease?  Do you know... 
[02:20:30]  What about herpes or something like that?  Very remote.  What?  Very remote.  So why aren't you fucking?  And sucking dick.  Yeah.  For real.  You're already kissing it through the pants.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't have a relationship and I feel like a little afraid.  I don't want to be beaten up by a guy or, you know, abused in any way.  And all I ever read is women going through that.  I'm afraid.  I'm scared.  Because you don't write about...  I'm a little bit naive, you know?  People don't write about when girls just have sex and fucking nothing happens. 
[02:21:00]  Poor Patty's in the hell.  She really is.  My problem is I'm very naive and I wouldn't know the difference.  You know?  Poor Patty.  What?  Being beaten over the head or being fucked?  Your family was awful.  They really were.  They fucked you up.  I'm very naive.  I don't know.  You're a wasted organism.  You really are.  No, I'm not.  Because you're mine.  I'm a very good person.  Nah, you could be a good person, but the truth of the matter is, you're not living your  life.  Well...  You're sitting here and you're alive, but you're not living your life. 
[02:21:30]  I work hard.  Oh, God.  That's the picture of Bob.  How are we not watching that?  We forgot.  We forgot about Bob doing the weather.  Someone just screen capped and sent me a picture.  I thought he said 9 o'clock.  He's hugging Linda Church.  Ugh.  He'll probably do it again, no?  Yeah, they keep him in there all day.  All right, Pat.  Everything else good with you?  Yeah, everything is fine.  How much vacation time you got worked up at the coffee place there?  Well, I had eight hours accrued, so I got five hours put on my time card for it, because  I don't take vacations.  Look, I just asked you. 
[02:22:00]  I just use the hours.  How much time do you have?  Three hours left.  You have three hours left, and how long have you been working there?  Five years.  Five years.  How much total hours of vacation have you gotten in five years?  Maybe about three days' worth.  Five years.  You know that Howard just gained three more vacation days by being on vacation?  I don't know.  Wow, Patty.  He seems to be on vacation more than he's in the studio.  Whoa!  But that's the truth, and I tell it like it is. 
[02:22:30]  What are you trying to get us in trouble?  Come on, Patty.  He tells it like it is.  Come on, Patty.  This should be a new bit.  Patty, throwing it like it is.  Patty, tell it like it is.  Yeah, tell something else like it is.  Uh, uh, that's all I had.  Come on.  This could be a new bit.  What do you think about that murder in Brooklyn?  Yeah, come on.  The guy's a monster.  Oh, Patty, tell it like it is.  Patty, tell it like it is.  Delivering the goods.  He was on suicide watch.  Let him commit suicide.  Oh, shit. 
[02:23:00]  Patty, tell it like it is.  She's telling it like it is right now.  He takes advantage of an eight-year-old that's lost.  Yes, and another thing is, didn't the parents teach this eight-year-old not to go with a stranger?  Oh, that's right.  He got what was coming to him.  Tell it like it is.  That's stalker, Patty.  Tell it like it is.  He had it coming, right, Patty?  Well, no.  No, you don't go up to a stranger.  You don't know what they are.  Oh, shit.  Are you telling it like it is?  Patty, what about Casey Anthony getting out on the 17th?  She's getting out of jail. 
[02:23:30]  High security.  A lot of people want to do her harm.  What do you think about Casey Anthony?  Tell it like it is.  My feeling is she had something to do with the death.  She's probably withheld information.  Oh.  And she's, you know, I just, there was not enough evidence to convict her, but I think  she's guilty.  Stalker, Patty.  Tell it like it is.  Patty's telling it like it is.  I believe she's guilty, but you can't prove it.  Whoa.  Who has been giving facts?  She's telling it like it is today.  I'm sure it is.  Wow. 
[02:24:00]  And that's unfortunate.  God gives people like that babies, and people that really want a child can't have them.  I don't get that.  Oh, thank you, Patty.  Tell it like it is, Patty.  Tell it like it is.  Who deserves it?  A child.  People that are like her, they should never have children.  She didn't want a child in the first place.  She could have had other alternatives.  She should have just left it on the counter at a diner, right?  No.  Give it to a hospital.  Put it up for adoption, but don't end up like this.  I feel sorry for the baby.  She's telling it like it is. 
[02:24:30]  She sure isn't.  She sure is.  But you didn't.  Almost.  You came close.  Why didn't you cry?  It put tears in your eyes.  It was a baby.  Oh, wow.  It almost puts tears in your eyes.  Patty, could you cry for all the victims out there today?  What?  I think it would be very therapeutic for you and a lot of people.  Cathartic for you.  How come you didn't cry?  There's a monster in Brooklyn.  There's Casey Anthony.  There's a lot of sadness out there.  Well, she's another monster.  I'm sorry.  She needs every ounce of fluid in her body.  If she cries, she'll just crumble like a pillar of salt. 
[02:25:00]  She went out and partied for 31 days.  Oh, shit.  I mean, she really cared.  She was, she was, she just lost.  You can't do anything if you care.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Tell me like it is.  How can you enjoy yourself if you care?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Patty, she just lost a child.  She needed some time to get over it.  She didn't lose the child.  She helped lose the child.  Oh, man.  Yeah, but you can't believe it.  Oh, well, you know, I guess a jury of 12 people that saw the whole entire trial don't 
[02:25:30]  know half of what you know just watching it on HLN or something.  You know, they just can't prove it.  Do you get headline news or your rabbit ears don't pick that shit up?  If they could only prove it, it would be nice if I just didn't probe into that.  Patty, tell her like it is.  Bringing it.  Telling it like it is.  You're really bringing it today, Patty.  Taking no prisoners.  Oh, yeah.  Look how she's standing now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Telling it like it is.  Her arms up on the, yeah.  She's all cocky on her lips.  I have no amount of cockiness in me on the most normal person on the planet.  Oh, there's no cockiness in you.  The situation womb.  Patty, you do know you're going to lose your virginity in like a retirement home, right? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Some black orderly is going to get you in the middle of the night.  Oh, my God.  That's so true.  Maybe it'll be the safest place.  No, it's not.  Someone that looks like CeeLo is going to climb on top of you.  Give you an angry chicken breath in your face.  CeeLo is going to be fucking Patty.  All pissed off because he's only making $8 an hour.  So he's going to get his.  I have a bit of a rod.  You want to see it jump?  Yeah.  Oh.  Watch his brother. 
[02:26:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Patty.  Why don't you give it one more kiss for old times sake?  Or at least pat it.  Or pat it the right way.  Yeah, yeah.  Pat it the right way.  What do you want, Jamie?  It's your penis.  You know what?  Give it a pat.  What do you want?  Pat or a kiss?  Quick before it realizes who you are.  Pat or a kiss.  Go ahead.  How many pats?  Come on.  It's going to go soft.  Come on.  Come on.  Ow.  Oh, shit.  Oh, what an asshole.  Oh, shit.  That is an asshole.  She fucking swung at it.  That's the way Sugar Ray Robinson patted Lamar. 
[02:27:00]  Holy shit.  What was that about, Patty?  She swung her arm back.  That's not a pat.  And fucking smacked Jimmy's dick and I think got his balls.  That's a right hook.  I did?  Yeah.  Patty, you don't treat a penis like that.  She's doing that neck thing again.  What's wrong with you?  Patty.  Patty.  What the fuck?  Why have all the anger?  Yeah.  I don't have a bit of anger in me.  Not even for Starbucks?  No.  I'll break out of character.  Starbucks can suck a dick. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  They fuck their employees over.  How many years you been there?  Five.  Five years.  And how many hours a week do you work about?  They give me like 25 to 30 hours.  And you only have how many hours of vacation?  Well, right now I got three left.  Out of what?  Eight total hours?  I've been accrued since the last time.  It's not possible.  By the way, if she says accrued one more time, please just push me out of the studio.  Unless you say, what do you wash your pussy out with?  She says accrued. 
[02:28:00]  Accrued.  And we got the couch of zilchers here.  Bring in David.  Bring in David.  This is our friend David from Israel.  Hi, vacru.  Ah!  David.  David.  Hi, David.  Hi, David.  There he is.  It's David.  Direct from Israel, I guess.  When did you get to New York?  Two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago?  What are you doing in New York?  You're talking like Don Corleone.  I've been working two time zones.  Oh, two time zones?  I work in Israeli hours and American hours, so. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, shit.  So what do you got to wake up and?  Wake up at two.  Work to about two, three, four years.  Are you slaving away at the dreidel factory?  What are you doing?  I'm a soft switch engineer.  Oh, right.  You got the greatest Jew voice ever.  You really do?  Yeah, it is.  You should be in movies with that voice.  But I don't complain the way Anthony makes it.  No, no, no.  I'd complain, but who would listen?  With a voice like that, I thought you'd be Hasidic.  Not at all.  No.  What airline did you fly?  Hello.  Hello. 
[02:29:00]  How long did it take you to go through security there?  Me?  It takes me about two minutes, because they originally profile.  Like they should do over here.  Yeah, I agree.  Ah, yeah, see?  I do agree.  They look at you and go, there's no way this motherfucker's doing anything to an Israeli  flight.  On the other hand, if you're not Jewish, they're going to stop you and look through everything  and ask you a bunch of questions.  And if you're good, they'll let you through.  If you're an Arab, they're going to pull you over and stop for at least a half hour.  Really?  That's fucking correct.  That's how it should be, right?  That is.  Patty, you want to have sex with David?  Through a sheet?  Fuck no.  That's okay.  You're good? 
[02:29:30]  You're good, Patty?  I'm good.  This is our friend David.  What's wrong with David that you don't want to have sex with him?  Yeah, what's the matter?  What's wrong with you?  Are you racist?  No, that's all right.  You don't like him because he's Jewish?  You anti-Semite?  Yeah.  It doesn't mean that.  No.  Would you let David rub his penis up against you?  No, no, no.  What?  I'd pass him out of the studio and then go next door.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy, you want...  Oh, no.  Maybe the...  No, not going to happen.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I stopped.  Would you let David hump your ass like a wild animal?  No.  Patty, your microphone.  You keep backing away.  Stop being Sheila Shai.  She's backing right into David. 
[02:30:00]  Out of respect, no.  Out of respect for what?  How about for the show?  For the show.  I would do it for the show.  Would you let Bobo hump you?  No.  Why?  It's like dry humping.  I don't want him near me.  It's like old school dry humping, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Would you let Bobo kids do it?  Dry hump you from behind?  No, I would not.  Why?  For the show.  He's not my type.  How about...  For the show.  How about this?  No.  Bobo sits down in the chair.  You sit on his lap and grind and give him a lap dance. 
[02:30:30]  A lap dance?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I said.  I don't think so.  For the show.  No, I can't do that.  Oh, come on.  I'll be a fag.  What about for $5?  Oh, man.  And an extra 15 minutes of vacation?  How much money do you need?  I'll put in 10 bucks.  Oh, wow.  Wow, David.  For busting apart a stereotype.  That's like 2 million in Catholic dollars.  Patty, no?  You want to let Bobo hump you? 
[02:31:00]  Give Bobo a lap dance.  You don't do anything for the show anymore.  That's fun.  I have to have contact.  That's what a lap dance is.  Look at the clothes on, you dork.  What's the matter?  You don't do anything anymore.  How are you looking at somebody like you're disgusted with them?  Come on.  I'm sure Bobo's going to feel the same way.  Do you want to do another tell it like it is?  That bit's working.  How come you don't like Bobo?  Yeah, tell it like it is.  And he's okay, but, you know, something's a little bit... 
[02:31:30]  Be honest.  You're not telling it like it is.  Tell it like it is.  Tell it like it is, Patty.  You know, when it's your birthday, you don't put your address on the internet and say,  give me presents.  Oh, Patty.  Tell it like it is, Patty.  It doesn't sound appropriate to me.  Tell it like it is.  You know?  Yeah.  I saw that, and it turns me off.  Oh.  Because I don't understand that.  You were turned on beforehand?  Yeah.  You really look like Geddy Lee today.  I know we've said it a million times, but today especially.  True.  Just grind on a lap and sing limelight.  Maybe it's cool to look like somebody famous, you know? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, well, not if it's Geddy Lee.  Right, exactly.  I never met the guy.  And you're a girl.  I'm sure he's not a bad person, you know?  Well, how do you know?  I don't know.  What if he beats his women like you're so scared of getting beaten?  Maybe.  Who would know?  I don't know.  You want to bring more people in?  Yeah, we might as well fill up the...  Who's next?  David, you could, I guess, stand there, right?  No problem.  Yeah, because we might continue talking to David.  Yes.  Who's next there?  How long of a flight is that, by the way? 
[02:32:30]  One person at a time.  Depends which way.  Depends which way.  Yeah, because the wind's blowing towards Israel, so the way there's about 10, the way back's  about 11.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's a long fucking flight.  Pop a pill and you sleep the whole time.  All right.  Like the way you think.  Zilches?  Yeah?  All right.  Bring him in there, Kenny.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Kenny's giving him the...  No matter what Kenny said, just ignore it.  Oh, wowie.  Oh, that's it.  Kind of a see-through-ish little number you got there. 
[02:33:00]  Tits.  Wow.  Look at those tits.  Without being disrespectful, you do have really great tits.  Thank you.  You have beautiful breasts.  Thank you.  I think you wanted to show them off a little bit today.  Yeah, she's a good egg.  Flip it.  36 double D?  How'd you know?  Wow.  Good.  Very good, Jimmy.  It is good.  Wow, that's a wonderful top.  Yeah, there's a beautiful...  Patty's staring at your tits.  Yeah, Patty's gay. 
[02:33:30]  Patty, what would it be like if you had tits like that?  Could you allow Patty to, like, motorboat your...  No.  She's like, no.  Where are you from, Brie?  Hillside, New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  I should have warmed her up a little bit before I went for that question.  What do you do for work?  Well, right now I'm a student and I work at GameStop.  Oh, Game...  Okay.  I'm going to do it.  Do you have a boyfriend? 
[02:34:00]  No.  Oh, wow.  Girlfriend?  No.  What color are your nipples?  Are they darker?  Just curious.  A little darker?  A little bit.  A little bit, yeah.  Big areolas?  Yes, yeah.  What's your nationality?  Brazilian and Portuguese.  Oh, boy.  She's a true...  We're into Portuguese lately.  Look out.  We're right in?  That'll do...  Yeah, yeah.  We got the Portuguese brought on Fox we like.  Fox Business.  Her breasts are lovely.  Yeah.  Do they grow them like that in Brazil?  No.  I'm American, but my parents are... 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to gently hold them like two orbs.  They are orbs.  They're big flesh orbs.  Beautiful.  Would you allow Jimmy to juggle them?  Yeah, no.  We're going to play circus music while I juggle them.  Yes.  Play the...  And make Charlie Callis noises.  The only reason we're...  Did you enjoy him?  He stunk.  He did Charlie Callis.  The only reason we're asking all these questions is because you obviously want us to notice  the breasts, so...  Well...  We're focusing.  We're noticing.  Oh, boy. 
[02:35:00]  David, what do you think of those breasts?  Nice, right?  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like them big Jew tits.  He just looks like...  Yeah, I guess so.  Kelly Callis.  The younger ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Patty, you like her boobs?  What about it, Patty?  You keep staring at them.  What do you think?  Oh, my gosh.  She might need heart medication.  What are you doing, Patty?  Are you all right?  What's the matter?  Patty, the microphone.  Patty, what's wrong?  Oh, no.  Nothing.  Why are you freaking out? 
[02:35:30]  Hi, guys.  You sound like Patty from Monaki.  Oh, no.  Nothing.  Why are you flustered?  And you know, your new bit is tell it like it is.  Yeah, you've got to tell it like it is.  What are you thinking?  Why are you flustered?  Come on, lesbian Patty.  We all noticed you were staring at them.  I'm not a lesbian.  You want to lick her breasts.  You like them, though, right?  They are nice.  Yeah.  She has a very nice shape.  You attracted to her a little bit.  No.  Patty.  A little bit.  No.  Tell it like it is, Patty.  Tell it like it is. 
[02:36:00]  But I'm not.  I'm not.  I don't like that.  Do that or you've got to kiss Jimmy's penis again?  You want to kiss her big bosoms?  Do you want to kiss her heavy breasts?  Okay.  That's enough.  Her arm.  Nice to see Val Kilmer out there from now.  We can get a girl for you so you can les out.  Yeah.  Because now we're starting to think you might want to les out.  You want to kiss her breasts.  I know it goes against God, but we could get you to les out.  What do you think, Patty?  And if it's for the show, you'll be all right.  You like the vagina, Patty?  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Holy shit.  But I'm not like that.  You know.  Stop it.  You're not like that.  I'm not like that.  Holy shit, it's the guy.  That's Val?  Well, he's outside, too.  Looks just like him.  That's kind of cute.  Oh, wow.  Patty, yeah, just walk away from the mic again.  Patty, you've been on the show for 10 years and you don't know how to talk in the mic.  What's the other girl's name?  What's your name?  Oh, Bree.  I'm Bree.  Hi, Bree.  Hi.  Can I tweet your titties? 
[02:37:00]  I said tweak.  No, I mean, you can wear what you're wearing.  I don't care.  Because it's see-through.  Sure.  Why not?  Everyone wants to see them, so.  Very nice top.  Very nice breasts.  Should I fly?  I got to get the flesh.  What kind of undergarment are you wearing on those breasts there underneath that thing?  A bra?  A bra.  Say brassiere.  It's sexier.  What's it?  Where's it from?  Victoria Seeker?  Oh, you got it from Vicky's?  Little Vicky's?  She has nice Roman shoes on, too.  Oh, yeah?  They're very Roman.  Yeah, they are. 
[02:37:30]  I don't know.  Is that kind of non-  It's great.  Let me see.  Oh, of course you want to use the wash seat there.  Yeah, that's fine.  All right, hold on.  Let me try that.  Hey, he's just trying to get the best picture possible.  That's right.  Yeah.  You have to do it from above, I just feel like.  Yes.  Great.  Patty, what do you think of those?  What do you think of her breasts?  It's just, I don't know.  It's just part of the body.  That's all. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, God.  Jesus.  You're the worst.  You are a zilch.  You are a zilch.  All right.  Yeah, do you want to hold her breasts?  Oh, I don't do things like that.  But you do want to squeeze them, though, right?  To see what they feel like?  You just kiss Jimmy's penis.  Of course you do things like that.  Sure, it's all you do, actually.  You do nothing but things like that.  Stop trying to tell yourself you don't do crazy stuff.  Yeah, you've always done stuff like this.  You've already patted Jimmy's penis, and you kissed it today.  That's crazy.  What?  That's crazy. 
[02:38:30]  All right, should we have Bree sit down, then?  Anything else, Bree?  No, that's it.  Okay.  Thanks for coming by.  You're welcome.  We were pleasantly surprised, because usually it's a bunch of fat guys.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the rest of them are a bunch of fat guys.  Bring on the rest, I guess.  Sit down, Bree.  Take a seat.  I'd love to kiss your bosoms.  Right there is fine.  Yeah.  I'd like to lick him and make this noise.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Patty's bothering me today.  I know.  Can we tell her to go home?  What's the matter, Patty?  I don't know.  Microphone.  You got all flustered when you saw the big boobs.  Yeah.  We all know it.  We saw you got flustered, so talk about it.  After all these years, let's be honest with each other.  What got you?  Tell us.  I don't know.  I'm just some, you know.  What?  Tell it like it is.  Say it.  Do you have lesbo feelings?  No, I don't.  I think you do.  Just stop pushing it down.  I know it goes against the Bible and all that, because you're kind of religious, your upbringing. 
[02:39:30]  Patty, I think you do.  Do you have some lesbo-tended?  No, I don't.  So what did you feel when you see those big breasts?  I guess I didn't feel anything.  Hold on.  For just a minute, Brie, could you sit up here for a second, please?  Okay.  I would like to ask Patty about it.  Sitting in the big boy chair right by the console.  How do you spell Brie?  B-R-E-E.  Oh, yeah.  I think you can see.  Yeah, Brie Olsen.  Now, Patty, just take a look.  You just look.  We're all looking.  Just look. 
[02:40:00]  Well.  Take a look, Patty.  Look at them through the shirt.  Patty, look.  You look?  Yeah, I see.  Why do you keep hiding your eyes?  Brie, can you pull this down a little bit?  Just show them the cleavage.  Not too crazy.  Just a little more cleavage for Patty.  I want to be respectable here.  Well, I don't have any cleavage.  Well, Patty, pull yours down a little bit.  I don't have any cleavage in your skull.  But I don't have any cleavage.  I have nothing.  Axe cleavage.  Yes.  I have nothing.  All right, Patty, but aren't they nice?  Yeah, she's a very nice looking lady.  Why can't you look?  She's probably nice to kiss, isn't she? 
[02:40:30]  And tweet.  But I don't do.  But no, I'm not.  All right, all right.  We got it.  You keep repeating.  But she's probably nice to kiss.  Why can't you look at her?  If you're a guy.  Why can't you look at her breasts?  Look at her.  Just look.  I see you.  Don't look and turn away.  Keep looking.  I see you.  Look at them.  Why do you look away?  Look at how big they are.  They're heavy.  Yeah, but I see them.  They're nice, aren't they?  Yeah.  I guess if you're a guy, yeah.  Really soak them in.  Yeah, soak them in.  Imagine laying back.  She's next to you on the couch.  Maybe you kiss on the lips a little bit. 
[02:41:00]  No, I wouldn't be doing that.  We heard you the 30th time you said it.  And she puts her big Brazilian nipple in your mouth.  And she says, suck, Patty.  I wouldn't be doing that.  There's a nice weight to them.  Yeah, they're heavy.  They cover your head.  I wouldn't be doing things like that.  Oh, God.  It wouldn't be me.  It wouldn't be me, no.  Bree, how old are you?  18.  18?  Oh, Jesus.  What are we doing?  You have a straight.  Okay, good.  No.  You're 18.  Patty.  That's disgusting, Patty. 
[02:41:30]  You're 56.  And you're looking at 18-year-olds' tits like that?  And you're looking at a young girl's tits like that?  God, Patty.  You're a Patty file.  What the fuck, Patty?  You're too much.  What the hell?  The FBI's got to know about this.  You're too much.  Oh, boy.  She told her like it is again.  She sure did it.  Wow.  She sure did it.  She's crazy.  Come on.  Say something about her breasts.  No.  Go ahead.  Say it nice.  Tell her they're nice.  No.  Why?  Why? 
[02:42:00]  Just compliment her.  Say, Bree, those are really sexy breasts.  She's of legal age.  This is all fine.  It's on the up and up.  Don't do things.  Just tell her.  Compliment another person.  Make her feel good.  Complimenting.  It's a compliment.  She obviously hates herself.  She's a fan of this show.  No.  You know.  Wait.  18.  I mean, hold on.  A lot of girls are very attractive.  You know.  That means she was 11 when we came back to radio.  Yeah.  How long have you been listening?  A couple months.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's it?  We're listening.  Oh, don't mind me. 
[02:42:30]  What did you used to listen to?  Patty.  It's got me so fucking bored.  I'm just yawning, stretching.  Can we mic her?  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's no mic.  No one's micing her.  Let's bring in the next person.  All right.  All right.  Dave, you like those, right?  Nice.  Do you want a boy or a girl?  Uh, well, I guess we're getting it.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi there.  There's a mic.  There's a microphone.  Thanks for coming by. 
[02:43:00]  What's your name?  Hi, Adrian.  Hi, Adrian.  Yes, of course.  Adrian.  What do we say?  Patty stares at girls.  What's wrong?  Patty likes Adrian, too.  Because someone walked into the room.  Patty, microphone.  And now she's doing that neck thing again.  Somebody walked into the room.  That's all.  Look at her neck.  What are you doing to her neck?  It's like a stretch Armstrong.  When you stretched it, it would just get all like...  Patty, if you had to choose...  Are you talking to this? 
[02:43:30]  It's a...  If you had to question.  We've all had these type of questions.  If you had to.  If you had to.  It doesn't mean you're going to.  Which girl would you...  Would you kiss Adrian's very feminine, sexy hips?  Or would you kiss Bree's breasts?  Which one?  Yes.  If you had to.  If you had to question.  Come on.  Tell it like it is.  Tell it like it is.  Tell it like it is.  What's your new bit?  I guess since I got older, I feel a little bit more held back. 
[02:44:00]  You know, subdued, I guess.  I don't know.  Again.  Because you were wild.  Which would you have to?  Exactly.  Because you were wild when you were a 50-year-old virgin.  Yeah.  Now that you're a 56-year-old virgin, you've got to slow down a little bit.  Now you're really not fucking...  Watch out.  I don't know.  Would you kiss Bree's...  Look at this breast.  Just look.  Yeah.  And look at Adrian's beautiful hips.  Now what would you do?  Would you caress Adrian's hips and kiss her thighs?  Or would you kiss Bree's juicy, heavy, tanned breasts?  Her dark, areoled breasts. 
[02:44:30]  Whoa.  What do you think?  She's got a nice rump.  Let me see.  Can I see your hair?  She does.  Yeah.  She's spankable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on, Patty.  This is a...  If you had to.  Patty.  Yeah.  Would you rest your face on her beautiful buttocks or on her breasts?  Yep.  There you go.  I don't know.  Easy question.  Go ahead.  Answer it.  Yeah.  And then if I answer in a hypothetical way, I'll...  We understand it's hypothetical.  We understand.  That's why we're asking.  Relax.  Yes.  We understand.  God.  Come on.  I don't know.  Why does everything take so fucking long with you?  I know.  It's really... 
[02:45:00]  Because I don't have an answer.  It's infuriating.  You are enraging time outside the studio.  You're time wasting.  Yes.  Just answer.  I did answer.  No, you didn't.  What would you do?  Would you suck her...  Let me phrase this.  Would you suck her big, beautiful breasts like I'd like to?  Or would you kiss her juicy, sexy ass like I'd like to?  I don't know.  Ugh.  Well, kiss the ass probably.  Because that's what I am.  Oh, wow.  You're a fucking whore.  She's a legend.  Exactly.  A slut whore.  Shit-eating virgin?  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Holy shit.  You look pussy.  Just tongue-out pussy and asshole, right?  Wow.  You like lesion out.  You are a slut.  What a slut.  It's all creative.  You know, it's not for real.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you want to get to know our latest...  I hate to say it, zilch, but that's just the name.  It's too good a title.  Where are you from?  I'm from Long Island, Deer Park.  Oh, Deer Park.  Actually, I worked right next to Riley's for many years.  Where? 
[02:46:00]  410.  I'm right at that white building.  It's a big Vantage title.  I like the sound of that place.  They're remodeling that damn thing, aren't they?  Yeah.  It's white.  I got out before.  I haven't.  We get a lot of lunches from that place.  Oh.  This means nothing to anyone.  Riley's Cog.  Those boys over at IBM.  That's right.  Very cool.  Patty?  Anything?  Patty.  Microphone.  Yeah, yeah.  How about you fucking stay by that microphone?  Are you going to pass out?  What is going on with her?  I'll clamp you to it. 
[02:46:30]  She's just annoying today.  Yeah, something's up.  You're really annoying today.  Why are you...  Extra annoying.  You look lightheaded or something or dizzy or something.  She makes a Charlie Callis face.  Patty's trying to control her lesbianism right now.  I know she is.  It's so obvious.  I'm not a lesbian.  This says it all.  You want to...  I'm not.  You're very attractive.  You want to worship Breeze Feet?  Actually, all I have are celebrity crushes.  Like who?  Who is it?  Well, Nancy Chabelle has them, but I like Paul McCartney. 
[02:47:00]  I think he's cute.  He's not.  At least you don't shoot out of your league.  Oh, man.  He's a beetle.  Well, I'm an old lady, so...  You know, who else do I like, you know?  Um, well, I also like Peter Tork from The Monkey.  Peter Tork.  Peter Tork from The Monkey.  She's got the worst face.  You're awful, man.  Peter, can you show me Peter Tork? 
[02:47:30]  Jimmy, look at Peter Tork.  Oh, shit.  Wow, that's Peter Tork now?  That's who you like?  He's over 70, you know.  Is he?  Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with him.  Would you let him stick his monkey's penis in you?  At least he'd be safer to go out with.  Safer than what?  You know how many groupies he must have been?  Yeah.  How is that safe?  Probably.  I don't know.  I also like Mickey Dolenz because he has a sense of humor.  Oh, that Mickey Dolenz is a hoot. 
[02:48:00]  Jimmy's just getting up to piss.  I think we'll make a great comedian.  There's two fucking lovely girls in here, and Jimmy's leaving the studio because of you, Patty.  Should we take a break?  Oh, God.  Oh, look at Mickey Dolenz.  Do you like Mickey Dolenz's fedora that he wears?  I don't see anything wrong with them.  Yeah?  He's cute.  He's adorable.  I love him.  I love it.  Yeah?  I love the look.  You love the look?  Yeah.  You know what's under that hat?  His hair. 
[02:48:30]  No, I don't think so.  No.  I don't think that monkey hair is there anymore.  No, that hair left him a long time ago, Patty.  Wow.  Can't find a picture with him without the hat.  No, no.  He's a leprechaun.  Oh, that's the closest you're going to get.  A leprechaun, right?  Yeah, he does.  A leprechaun face.  Listen, you know, he does look familiar.  Oh, he does because he's Mickey Dolenz.  I think I've seen him in the street in the village.  You probably have.  No, because I go down there to eat sometimes.  All right.  Who else is a celebrity crush? 
[02:49:00]  Well, Eric Clapton I like.  Ah, Eric Clapton.  Yeah, and I like his guitar.  Anyone that's not a musician?  What?  Any non-musicians?  What happened to The Edge?  Yeah, he's cute, too.  He used to be one of your guys.  Oh, I know.  Definitely.  He used to masturbate to YouTube music, remember?  Yeah.  He's still up there, huh?  Yeah.  I also like Ringo.  I think he's cute.  Oh, he's 71.  I'm 56.  It's not that, you know.  Oh, it's not that.  You know, the older you get, the more the gap closes, you know? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, your gap has been closed for fucking six years.  Six years, you fucking idiot.  Holy shit.  Oh, well, Patty, I don't know what to say anymore.  I just, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork.  It's mind-boggling.  McCartney.  We'll take a quick break, and then we'll finish up with the couch of zilchers.  Yeah, let's do that, then.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, I know you like to take control of the couch of zilchers. 
[02:50:00]  And Stalker Patty is sitting in the chair of honor, and I don't know if you wanted that  to happen.  I'm just bringing it to your attention.  Yeah, I don't want her in the chair of honor.  She goes, I'm just tired.  Yeah, sit right there.  Yeah, sit over there.  I don't know what Santa is doing.  I don't know what Santa is doing.  Let me know what Santa is doing.  Sit over there, then.  I'm staring at Bree's breasts.  I guess we should bring the rest of the zilchers in.  Really?  Yeah, it's time.  What do you think, Opa?  I mean, just because it's 9.35 already, I don't want to make them just stand out there.  Um, all right.  We'll leave them all but one.  We all know.  I promise Bree, if she gave me more cleavage, I would tweet another picture of her boobs 
[02:50:30]  and tweet her Twitter.  Okay.  That makes sense.  So I'm going to do that right now for her.  I'll photograph them, too.  And by the end of the show, well, you will have her topless.  So here's your, what?  No.  Oh, okay.  You didn't read the fine print, did you?  Oh, yeah.  And tell her about the fine print.  Kenny didn't fill you in?  No.  You have to show your tits.  All right, here's the second shot of Bree's bosoms going on the Twitter. 
[02:51:00]  Do you have big nipples?  The nipples themselves?  Didn't we?  No, no.  No, we talked to Areola.  See, she almost thought we would cover this already.  But we didn't.  I know the difference.  I got to help her out, too, because people are like, why aren't you showing the face?  She must be ugly.  She's absolutely not ugly, but she doesn't want her face on the internet with those big  tits.  Thank you, Jimmy.  So are your nipples big or small?  Small.  Well. 
[02:51:30]  Not too small, right?  All right.  I like Madonna.  How about you, Adrian?  How about me?  Two big, bigger nipples, small nipples.  I think they're kind of big.  Nice.  What color?  Pink.  Pink?  The Areola's look big?  Pink with a little brown or pink pink?  Pink with a little brown or pink pink?  I think they're actually pink pink.  The way I like to describe, do they look like pink with a speck of rabbit shit?  Are they pink like a blow-up doll?  Yeah.  That type of pink? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Are the Areola's big or the nipples big?  The Areola is big.  That's sexy.  How big is it?  Is there a slow fade going on?  We could say it, right?  Cover half the breast.  It doesn't look like a yarmulke.  Are you married?  Yeah.  All right.  Just with your fingers, how big is the Areola?  That's nice.  I was saying like vitamin water capsize.  Oh.  That's very specific.  Jesus.  How brand loyal of you.  Well, like a homogenized milk.  Looks like someone measured.  Yeah, exactly.  Had all the caps out. 
[02:52:30]  Like, look what I could cover my nipple with entirely.  Tried a whole bunch of caps until one worked.  1935 silver to all right.  Let's bring in the rest of the zilches.  Yes.  These are the ones we don't give a fuck about.  Here they go.  Then we waited this long to bring him in.  Look who else is.  Look who else is.  Bobo's sitting in his chair.  Holy shit.  Val Kilmer is a fan of our show.  He doesn't like Val.  He looks like Val Kilmer, sir.  Do you hear that? 
[02:53:00]  No.  No?  No.  You don't hear that?  It's because everybody remembers the Top Gun Val Kilmer.  Sure.  Sure.  Hey, guys.  Welcome to the show.  How's it going?  Bobo's still outside.  I noticed.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a dream.  Oh, you've been chatting with Bobo?  Has he been babbling?  Yes.  Yes.  A little bit.  About his cousin, Melissa.  With the big titties.  With the big titties.  My cousins has big titties.  How do you spell bazoongas, by the way?  B-A-Z-O-O-O-N-G-A-S. 
[02:53:30]  Bazoongas.  And B-A-Z-O-O-O-N-G-A-Z?  B-A-Z-O-O-N-G-A-S.  Oh, G-A-S, right.  Bazoongas.  That's going to be my tweet.  With a silent E at the end.  I thought it was bazongas.  Oh, maybe it is.  Well, how the fuck would you spell bazongas, then?  I don't know.  Close titties on the face.  Now.  Who are you guys?  Let's chat with the...  Jesus, what do you fucking do for a living?  Besides, what do you... 
[02:54:00]  I can't...  He has big calves, and I couldn't get out a calf joke.  That's funny.  They're a very big guy.  Jimmy, you also have large calves.  Yeah, but your calves are better than mine.  Your legs are too creepy and hairy.  Jimmy has the best calves in the business.  Let's compare.  I don't know.  No, his calves are bigger and bulkier.  Yeah.  But he must do something that requires big calves.  Purely genetic calves.  You a calf model?  Well, my legs shake a lot, so...  Do they really?  That kind of builds up.  Oh, that's what it is. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, you do that?  You just sit there and shake your leg?  You have legs like that fucking half-man, half-fucking...  Or he has legs like the Jersey Devil.  Like a minotaur?  Yeah, there you go.  You're all hairy.  Bazangas are hairy testicles that are wrinkly and saggy.  Oh, good.  That's great.  I'm getting my salad.  Gorgas all cheese and some fucking bazangas.  I didn't know that.  I just looked it up on the Urban Dictionary. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, what about gazangas?  Oh, is that the one we're looking for?  It might be gazangas.  Nah, man, I'm going with bazungas.  All right, continue.  Bazungas.  Continue.  I'm sorry.  You don't want to say that you have hairy balls on your...  No, you said bazangas.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Oh, they were tits.  I'm wrecking everything.  No, I'm more fascinated with that than minotaur legs.  What do you do for a living?  My family and I own a couple of math learning centers on the Upper East and West Sides.  Math learning centers? 
[02:55:30]  How horrendous.  For the dumb kids?  Is that like one of those commercials where it's like, you know, oh, this is great.  And the kids listen and like, oh, fuck.  And the parents are like, oh, this is great.  Jesus.  Do you point at your legs and say these are calves squared?  I've never done that, but it's for the dumb kids and then the kids who just love math  and can't get enough of them.  Oh, the mathletes.  Exactly.  The Asians.  That's what we call them sometimes.  Yeah, the Asians.  Mathletes, yeah.  Oh, Asians love math.  Do you play chess?  Yeah, I do play a little chess. 
[02:56:00]  We have chess programs.  But yeah, the kids come in.  It's in high demand for chess lessons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And what's your name?  Buddy.  Oh, all right.  Friendly.  Buddy.  And Bazonga's is also tits.  Bazonga's.  But I might go with chess puppies.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  I don't know about that.  Artie, how you doing?  Artie.  I figured I was more Eric Nagel than Artie.  Artie.  He looks like Artie.  What's your name, sir?  My name's Tom. 
[02:56:30]  Hi, Tom.  What kind of work do you do?  I'm in wine.  You're in wine?  Yes.  What?  That was a joke there, but it's so packy.  Oh, I want to know it.  No, no, no.  What do you mean you're in wine?  What do you do?  Do you make it or do you sell it?  No, I'm a sommelier.  What's that?  Oh, fuck.  A sommelier that's almost racist.  You could get married in New York now.  Oh, great.  I know.  I see that.  I could tell you what that is.  That's the guy that knows wine at a restaurant, right?  Yes.  Holy shit.  What restaurant?  Stink-a-roo. 
[02:57:00]  You don't want to say the restaurant?  No way.  Is it a fancy restaurant?  Yes, Jimmy.  What?  What is it?  Nothing.  I just bombed it.  It's a bomb that happened three minutes ago.  Terrifically.  It was funny.  Yuck.  What happened to your knee?  Did you hurt that?  Break your knee, man?  He was horribly out of shape.  Too much wine?  He went walking up the stairs.  By the way, how do you use his fucking little tiny ankles?  I'm an incredible shit.  Oh, my God.  He has atrophied ankles. 
[02:57:30]  You have cancer legs.  I'm about to catch some buddy over here.  No, you don't.  But the lower half of your left leg is...  Your calves are not even size.  What do you want me to do about it?  I was born this way.  Let me see.  Wow.  He really is telling you.  Danny, let me see.  Move over a little bit.  Oh, no.  But it looks like your left leg is skinnier than your right leg.  Is it not?  No.  No.  Maybe it was just Danny blocking it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, the knee brace might fuck things up perspective.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  What's the little hole for at the kneecap?  In just case your knee wants to drink.  My kneecap wants to say hi.  If his knee wants to blow another knee while watching a porno. 
[02:58:00]  So, wait.  You're a sommelier?  Yes.  Yeah.  Or see, some will be a something.  Some will boo.  Maybe I should have done it in that voice.  So, all right.  Sommelier is a wine expert.  Yeah.  How do you become that?  My friend's brother-in-law owned a wine shop, and I kind of just, you know.  A wine shop?  Is he sold Jewish women?  Working, working.  A wine shop.  Yes.  Ah, the old wine. 
[02:58:30]  That's all bullshit.  All right.  We just noticed the more expensive the wine, the better it is.  That's pretty much it.  And it's pretty true.  Yeah.  What is this whole thing that's happening now with these people saying these screw top wines  are good?  They are.  They're very good.  Why?  Because it's just a freaking, you're just closing it up.  It's not different than putting anything else in it.  I can't fucking appreciate that.  Well, get over yourself.  I need a cork.  I need a cork.  Well, the Sommelier.  I like looking at that. 
[02:59:00]  If I have a nice Shiraz, let's say.  I like taking the cork out and looking at it and making sure it looks like that deep  red fucking, like when you turn a cherry Italian ice over.  You know, the syrup on the bottom.  Doesn't it all taste the same wine?  No.  I hate the way they gotta fucking let the air hit it and swirl it.  Just drink the shit.  If it all tasted the same, you wouldn't need the fucking Sommelier or whatever the hell  it is.  I agree with Jimmy.  I think it all tastes the same.  Yeah.  Wow.  I would just stumble into this career. 
[02:59:30]  Ah.  It's bitter.  It fucking makes everyone's teeth dark.  Your breath stinks.  I drink Jack's wine.  Ah, swirl, swirl, swirl, swirl.  Breathe.  Ah.  Ah.  That's the most lovely.  Ah.  What about a swirl, swirl?  So you put it, what is it, a canter?  Decanter.  Decanter.  Decanter is a Jewish.  What's a decanter?  Look how they massacred my boy. 
[03:00:00]  And tweet.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So he's the wine guy.  Very good.  Yep.  What about our next zilch?  Uh, zilch.  Hey, how are you?  Sir?  Uh, I'm unemployed.  Ah.  An unemployed guy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now, nobody's ever told you you look like Val Kilmer.  No.  No, first time.  Because, uh, right when I saw you there, I was just thinking, kind of like we were, because 
[03:00:30]  we were commenting on Val and how Val's put a few pounds on of late.  And, uh, you kind of look like him a little.  Well, I'm just saying he's, he's a husky guy.  He's, uh, more of a husky gentleman.  Big boy.  Yeah.  You have trouble buying clothes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, see?  It's strictly internet.  Oh, really?  Well, it was.  I actually lost 60 pounds.  Holy shit.  So I was much heavier.  Oh, good.  How'd you do it?  I didn't.  Tell your story walking.  You see what that is?  How'd you lose it?  Mom.  Yeah, I'll try. 
[03:01:00]  What's that?  How'd you lose it?  Um, well, diet and exercise, but also, uh, I had gallbladder surgery, so.  Oh, good way to start.  Yeah, I had to get, I had to get all the fat and all that from food and everything.  Oh, but you didn't have, like, fat cut surgery?  No.  You didn't cut?  No, no, no, no, no.  Just the gallbladder, so.  What was all your gallbladder?  Uh, it was headstones.  Oh, the gall.  Oh, what song?  See, they should have called it an audacity bladder or something. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, it's the bladder.  A little bomb.  Uh, the, uh, you see what they're doing in the fishbowl?  They're, they're doing spinning classes.  Yeah, you might have joined the wrong program today.  It's like, yeah, ha, ha, ha.  I was just scared of people.  It's like, what the fuck?  Are they doing that on the radio?  I don't know.  I never understand that.  I'm sure they're saying the same shit about us.  You know what?  What am I to say?  You're absolutely right.  I'm having people patting Jimmy's dick.  Yeah.  Stupid Patty.  All right, we've got to move this along, because we're running out of show, and we've got to 
[03:02:00]  pick someone for the chair of honor.  The chair of honor.  Wow.  God.  Patty's still standing.  It's tough.  With her brittle bones.  Anyone have a humorous anecdote about your life?  That's just something that maybe recently happened, or something in the past that happened  that we might find entertaining.  It doesn't necessarily have to be funny.  God knows I haven't been.  You haven't?  You've seen a couple of dudaroos.  Yeah, yeah.  Dudaroos.  It's not the couch of wacky characters.  No, no, it is. 
[03:02:30]  That's why it's called the couch of zilchers.  Wait, should we ask, because we have a guest outside, should we ask him why he's outside?  Yeah, maybe we should.  All right, you guys think about that.  Yeah, you guys think.  Then I'll just see.  You think about what you've done.  What the hell is that?  All right.  This one.  I'm here.  Choo-choo.  All right.  Choo-choo.  I don't know what that is.  That's something you don't see every day.  It's a lady getting pushed in a chair.  Who the fuck was that?  I don't know.  Nah.  Stay right there.  Close the door. 
[03:03:00]  Close those doors.  Now get back in store.  Get back over there.  Okay, Bobo.  So how come you just...  What's going on?  I had the ticket here in this envelope, but supposedly did he took it.  There's no B in envelope.  It was a fake ticket.  What was it in?  The ticket was in this envelope.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, and what happened to it?  It was replaced with a fake.  No, that was...  A fake?  Yeah, yeah.  Who's going to get a fake ticket?  I don't know.  Danny must have fabricated this fake ticket or... 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Looks real enough to me.  Yeah, it looks real.  Is it handwritten?  Is it a strip of paper that is handwritten?  No, luckily that I only brought one of the two tickets.  The other one's at home.  This looks totally legit to me.  It's Mets-Phillies game.  Game City Field, Game 44, Promenade, Left Field, $25 ticket, and there's even a barcode.  What the fuck's the problem?  No, someone drew everything that was on the real ticket.  Drew it. 
[03:04:00]  I love how he feels like he has to convince everyone.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but it's obvious someone drew everything that was on the real ticket.  Well, it's not that obvious, because we're blue.  I see the Mets logo.  I see the City Field logo.  Yep.  You couldn't get in with this fake ticket unless you blew a security guard.  Wow.  Wow.  Is that how you've been catching the games?  Unless you blew that one security guard behind the garbage pail on the second level.  Yeah.  Look at her breast, Bobo.  Isn't she beautiful?  Yeah, she is.  Oh.  Look at how big and heavy they are. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, they're nice.  What would you do with that?  Yeah, what would you do with that?  I'd want to bury my face in them.  Yeah, they're probably nice to hold and touch.  Wait, wait, why are we doing this with his pants on?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  You've got to take your pants off.  You can keep your underwear on, though.  That's only fair.  Well, I don't know what the fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.  You guys are all over 18.  You're all okay with this?  What the fuck kind of underwear are you wearing?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Pull your shorts down. 
[03:05:00]  You're European.  Just drop the shorts.  He's European.  Drop the shorts.  He's European.  Holy fuck.  He's European.  Bobo is wearing a ball bag.  He's got a European bathing suit on.  Bobo.  Holy shit.  What the fuck are you wearing?  It's his underwear.  No, they're not.  Bobo, let the shorts drop to the floor.  Don't worry.  He is.  Quickly.  If anybody hates Bobo, you're insane.  I know.  You're just insane. 
[03:05:30]  He's the gift that keeps on giving him.  Bobo, I hate to even say this, but turn around.  He looks like a little boy.  Where'd you get those from?  I don't know.  One of my uncles gave me these for Christmas.  Oh, God.  And I joke with him.  I said, you've got to be kidding me.  What the heck is this?  Designer underwear.  And did he say, put them on and come sit on my lap? 
[03:06:00]  I don't know.  Try them on.  I said, I don't even wear these a lot.  I just go, when every other pair of underwear is in the laundry.  Those come out, huh?  Yeah.  Those make an appearance.  They're almost panties.  They're almost panties.  I don't even know what he's on.  I just noticed that they looked like they had this.  The girls are dying.  Talk to her really fast.  Why is she dying over there?  Danny, grab her for a second. 
[03:06:30]  She turned on.  And Bobo's all balls.  I can't believe this underwear exists.  I know.  You're dying.  Doesn't it look like every Euro trash walking down the beach?  Bobo, you're all balls.  Yeah, you really are.  Your dick looks huge in those pants, but we know better, don't we?  Yeah.  We really do.  At least that's a relief about these.  You can't stop looking at her titties, can you?  Yeah, let's talk about her titties now.  Now we can talk about her.  Can you look at them a little bit, Bree?  Just look at them that way. 
[03:07:00]  Can it look that way?  You can turn that way.  Show them a little cleavage.  Come on.  That freaking looks nice.  What, you like that?  Yeah, I look nice.  So could you imagine what those would feel like, Bobo?  Oh, those would feel nice.  How would they feel?  Yeah, talk about them a little bit.  Talk about them.  Would you hump them?  Talk about what you'd do with them.  Yeah, I would.  Would you like to take liberties with the cleavage there and maybe do a little something?  Yeah.  What would you do?  I want to bury my face in them.  You want to bury your face in them?  Yeah.  And do what once you're in there? 
[03:07:30]  Suffolk again?  Motorboat them.  Motorboat them?  Yeah, that's sexy.  Girls love that.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  I'd love to put my cock between them.  Whoa.  That's a little too much.  Whoa.  Bobo.  Do you have a boner?  Yeah.  So his underwear hasn't changed, by the way.  He's had a boner.  It's pushed out a little more in the front.  It's like a profile, and the nose has just gotten bigger. 
[03:08:00]  So you'd want to put it between there and what?  You know, it's like my cock between those.  Oh, my God.  And then what would happen?  I don't know.  I'd probably come between them.  Oh, my God.  You probably would.  Yeah, talk to him, break him ice.  He's being all smooth.  He lost his breath.  He lost his breath.  Did he?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:08:30]  Bobo?  Yeah.  So you'd probably come between them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then what?  Oh, my God.  He's just staring like a vulture.  No, he likes them.  Yeah, you like those, huh?  Yeah, I like them.  Isn't that creepy?  Oh, you like how he's holding his shirt up?  Yeah.  The girl on the couch is losing his stuff.  She's dying.  Yeah.  So you do like them a lot? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  What do you want to do to them?  Good.  One more time.  What do you want to do?  Give us details.  How would it go?  How would it go?  No, I think it's slowly unbuttoned or whatever.  What?  I slowly unbuttoned her.  All right, you'd unbutton her.  Yeah.  And then what?  Oh, I'd bury my face in them.  You'd bury your face in them.  Yeah.  Okay, and then what?  Go through the whole thing, beginning to end.  And then I'd probably spend my cock between them. 
[03:09:30]  What if you didn't?  What if you did something else?  Yeah.  Why is his voice so fucked up?  Oh, dear.  Maybe I'd, I don't know, I'd probably, I'd probably stick my cock in her slid.  I mean, I would go down on her.  Oh, you would?  Tell her.  That's what you're saying.  What a guy.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How would that go down?  Yeah.  She's got her, she's got her pants and her panties on.  What would you do?  Go ahead.  I'd slowly lift them down and go down.  Lift them down.  That's good.  Trying to pull them up.  Give her a wedgie.  What would you do?  Come on, tell her.  Come on.  Go ahead.  I would, I would go, I would go down on her.  Yeah.  Say it's sexy.  And then I'd slowly go up and then slowly slide my cock.  And then I'd just ram it there like that. 
[03:10:30]  What, you just leave it?  I'd just ram it there like that?  And then just leave it there?  No, no.  Like so much trash?  No, keep, keep going.  I don't know.  Pump.  Why don't you show her your hip motion?  Let's see your hip motion.  How would you pump her?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I'm almost pumping.  Yeah, between those big, giant, heavy tits.  Come on, pump.  Pump cum on them.  Come on, fill them with cum.  Give her what she wants.  Pump, pump cum all over those big, giant, young tits. 
[03:11:00]  Hump away.  Hump, boy.  Hump those giant, fat, heavy tits.  Yeah.  Show her who's boss.  Yeah.  Give it to her.  Give it to a real savage.  Yeah.  Faster.  Hump them faster.  Talk while you're humping.  Yeah, yeah.  I freaking caught her heart.  Talk while you're humping.  Jesus Christ.  You're humping.  It's like the newest dance sensation.  Yeah.  That's sweeping the nation.  Do the downs.  It's the bubble motion. 
[03:11:30]  Bubble motion.  I guess they'd put the air home.  Oh, boy.  You like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you show her?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah.  Show her what's up.  Hump away.  I'll say that.  Yeah, who wouldn't be, right?  Yeah.  So you're humping.  Yeah.  And then what would happen? 
[03:12:00]  Are you humping her tits or her slit, as you so eloquently put it?  I probably put it right in her ass.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Tell her you want to cover that shit with cum.  Yeah.  Believe me.  I want to cover that.  It's not a poor thing.  I want to find cum coming out of her ass.  Oh, my God.  Degenerate. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  Hump away.  Show her how you'd give it to her.  Go ahead, Bree.  Just take a look at him.  He's harmless.  It's hot, right?  Yeah, that's hot.  Go turned on.  Yeah, you're getting turned on now.  Tell him something dirty.  Come on and help him.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You can do it.  Come on.  Get out.  He's just humping the air.  Give him something.  Yeah, I know.  Stamina.  Yeah, right?  He does have some get up and go to him, doesn't he? 
[03:13:00]  Oh, my God.  His underwear is like a magic eye.  Just make up for the size.  Oh, boy.  It's like that David Hasselhoff animated GIF where you just can't stop staring at his crotch.  Go ahead.  Hump away to your cum.  I can't see.  Yeah.  Say something dirty to her.  Come on.  You dominant.  Yeah, that's right.  You want that.  You like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why not?  You like that, huh? 
[03:13:30]  You like that, bitch.  You like that.  Wow.  Dirty talk.  Take it all.  Dirty talk.  Yeah, tell her.  Give it to her.  That's right.  Take it all.  Take all three inches of it.  Take all three inches of it.  Oh, Lord.  Yeah, he's still fucking rocking back and forth.  He's moving his hips.  It's crazy.  All right.  I got it.  You want that.  You want that.  Usually you see rocking like that in your own feces in a mental institution. 
[03:14:00]  You want that.  Ew, are the front getting...  Ew.  Oh, is it time for the pre?  No, I was searching for pre-stains, but I...  There's a spot on them.  There might be thick material.  Yeah.  Oh, there's holes in it.  That's nice, Bob.  Nice, Bob.  I didn't know he had a nickname for his nickname.  Boob.  Are there holes in it?  Yeah, little tiny ones, but they're there.  Nice, nice hole for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The great thing is he's just humping the air with these fucking Euro trash swim suit thing 
[03:14:30]  on, with his shirt pulled up, his backpack, and his Met hat on.  This is just...  Don't be old Navy shorts.  Horridly disgusting.  Yeah.  His underwear is not used to handling boners.  His underwear is not used to handling boners.  Oh, it's not.  That's uncomfortable, right?  You want to free that cock.  You want to punch your own dick?  Can we have Patty pat Bubba's dick? 
[03:15:00]  Oh, Patty.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  Patty, what's wrong with you?  Patty, just pat it.  Come on, Patty.  You're just patting it.  Come on, your name's Patty.  Patty.  Patty it.  Come on, Patty.  You used to do stuff for us.  He'd drink patty water.  No.  Come on, Patty.  Come on.  What, do you got a bunch of cakes or something?  Do we have any volunteers?  Any volunteers?  Patty?  Anyone else?  No.  Anyone in the room?  Patty.  Oh, Patty.  Just go up and pat it.  With his underwear on.  He's got his underwear on. 
[03:15:30]  You're not allowed.  You're not allowed right here.  Restricted area.  Yeah, you're not allowed back here.  Yeah, come on.  I don't need that shit.  No, I don't want anything to do with that.  No.  She's insulting you, Bobo.  Why don't you take that?  Bobo, what do you have to say that Patty's disgusted and doesn't want to pat your penis?  Yeah.  It's not.  She tells it like it is.  Let's hear Bobo tell it like it is.  Bobo, tell it like it is.  Let's hear this.  It's like shocking.  Wow.  Bobo's telling it like it is.  I mean, it looks bigger.  Oh, you like the way it looks in those ridiculous undies? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  That's why he's got them.  His uncle didn't give them to him.  That's why he bought them.  Yeah.  Are you bummed that Patty won't pat your penis through the European bathing suit underwear?  Fucking Europe, Trish.  You look for the show.  Huh?  For the show.  For the show.  Excuse me, no.  Get a head.  Give him a pat.  I'm sorry.  The answer is no.  Definitely no.  I will never touch him.  Never.  Why?  Why?  You think you're better than him?  No.  What's wrong with why?  He's a bobson, too.  I'm sorry, but no, that is not good. 
[03:16:30]  Patty, why would you do, uh, why would you pat Jimmy's penis but not Bobo's?  No, no, no.  But what's the difference?  I'm asking you a question.  Well, no, with him, no, it's a little, no.  You're not giving a fucking reason.  No, with Jimmy, it was only a bit.  With him, no.  Why won't you pat it?  He's a little much, no.  Ooh, a little too much for you?  Yes.  A little much.  Look how he's staring at you.  Sorry.  Do you find that disarming?  No.  How about you just squeeze the cock and balls?  No.  Or alarming. 
[03:17:00]  No.  Would you rub it gently?  It's more than I can handle, no.  Disturbing.  No.  Why does Bobo still have his backpack on?  Because he's got cum tissues in there.  Yeah.  Fucking, yeah.  Look at how sexy they are.  Look at how big young.  Butt blugs.  Look at how young they are, Bobo.  Oh, he's taking that backpack off.  She has big 18-year-old breasts.  Yeah.  Christ, I got it.  Yeah.  Pull your gun up.  Show your gun off.  She likes a man with a gun a lot.  Yeah.  Did you tweet his Euro fucking underpants?  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, great.  You got it, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Great.  I tweeted it, of course. 
[03:17:30]  I got to see that.  I have to do this?  Part of the dream.  Get closer, man.  Yeah, I got totally close.  Get really close.  Let your finger brush his helmet.  Guys, move out.  Yes, sir.  Why don't you poke it?  I didn't know.  I'll give you a free salad at F.H. Riley's if you poke it.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, with his pants on.  With his underpants on.  Just give it a poke.  No, honestly, my husband would kill me.  Well, you're not married. 
[03:18:00]  Do we have any pokers in the room?  Ari Lang, you want in?  No, thank you.  Jesus.  Got a guy to do it.  Somebody poke this autistic penis, please.  Patty.  I have to do everything myself.  Oh, boy.  Well, Patty.  Hold on.  Danny's going to poke it.  I think he just came.  Hey, what are you doing?  Patty, will you grab it?  No.  Danny is Bobo.  He's got a big face of the wedgies that I don't know. 
[03:18:30]  Keep those, yeah.  Keep them like that.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Bobo has a sexy look on his face.  Bobo, I blocked you a long time ago.  What's your Twitter?  Because I want to, like, keep your hero.  Radio Bobo XM 105.  Radio Bobo XM 105.  And the radio and the Bobo part, the first letter of radio was in caps and the first letter of Bobo was in caps.  Does that matter?  It doesn't matter.  I don't think it matters anymore, right?  I think it might.  There's two Radio Bobo XM 105s.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Might be.  Exactly.  Might be.  Ew, I see some pre.  Oh.  Yeah, I love it.  What happened, Bobo?  Don't move.  Stay there.  Leave him down.  That was from me.  Is the pre coming?  Look at her boobs.  Here comes the pre.  Bobo, pull your underpants up a little bit.  If he pulls his pants out.  Pull them up as high as you can.  Please.  He looks like the alien mouth.  Pull them up.  Pull them up there.  There you go.  That's as high as they go.  That's as high as they go.  Turn around, Bobo.  Turn around. 
[03:19:30]  Can he just turn?  No, don't pull him back down.  Can he just gave him an ultimate wedgie?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Bobo has easy access in the back now.  Oh, no.  I think you got to throw that pair away.  Oh, Patty.  Buy yourself a new pair.  Oh, no.  Patty, you're not part of this show.  Stop.  I think they might have torn during the wedgie.  Yeah, they might have.  Yeah.  I think you need them sewn.  Will mommy sew them?  I don't need these anymore.  Why?  I got plenty of other underwear.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Does it look like that?  No.  Yeah, you got a little pre-drip in the front.  Yeah, look at how wet it's getting.  Yeah.  Imagine humping her between her big boobs.  Yeah.  He just stops and smiles.  Yeah.  What would you say while you were humping her?  Would you tell her to open her mouth?  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah?  Yeah, say open up.  Yeah, open up.  Open up.  Well, thank you.  Here comes the pre-open up.  Oh, boy.  For the show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is it?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Her mouth is like a wet velvet glove.  Oh, my God. 
[03:20:30]  A wet velvet glove.  Yeah, that's right.  It's a wet velvet glove stroking your cock.  That's with her experienced young tongue, swirling on the underside, licking the balls.  Ew.  Yeah, pump that mouth.  I like that.  Give that mouth a good...  Yeah, she wants cum.  Oh, he's starting to pump again.  She wants cum tonsils.  He's pumping the air again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Pump her throat.  Lord.  That velvet glove.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like a fist.  She has a fist mouth. 
[03:21:00]  You like that, Bobo?  Yeah, I like it.  Yeah.  His teeth aren't coming apart.  He's like...  I like that.  Yeah, she looks great.  I like that.  Yeah, you want to put a load on her?  Yeah.  Where would you dump a load?  I don't know.  I guess he'd dump it on her boobs.  Yeah?  He'd dump it on those nice, sweet boobs of hers.  Oh, boy.  Now he's doing a little sweet talk.  Yeah, of course. 
[03:21:30]  Is he watching from the other room?  Seriously?  That's hilarious.  Come and go away.  Go away.  The man's in his underwear.  It doesn't matter.  Got one of the bosses in the other room making sure everything is safe.  Go away.  Nothing drips.  Jesus Christ.  No dribble.  They don't want dribble.  Of any...  Various fluid.  A fluid will drip.  You slip in that.  It's like a river.  And I... 
[03:22:00]  It'll dip all over his leg and thighs and calves.  As of hers.  Like a floor of Jiffy Lube.  Yeah.  Will there be fluids when you do life in the compound?  No.  No.  You don't want to do fluids down there?  I will not have.  Oh, there'll be...  Just fluids in general?  All kinds of fluids, yes.  Fluid.  Genuinely.  Not any Bobo fluids, but...  And the nice...  She's got this nice...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, tell her, Bobo.  I cannot help it.  It just got that...  Gives me that look in my eyes. 
[03:22:30]  What's that look?  Oh, that nice look.  I just didn't want to do...  I just didn't want to see those nice boobs.  Boops?  They're so heavy.  Yeah, they're so heavy and nice.  Those nice boobs.  Damn it.  I want to see those freaking nice...  You probably want to lick them, too, don't you?  Yeah.  Like big lollies.  Do you got a nickname for boobs, Bobo?  We use fun bags and gazungas today.  Yeah.  Which one do you like?  Yeah, what do you call them?  Cool.  And the nice...  Nice boobies. 
[03:23:00]  The sweet set.  The twins.  Ah, the twins.  The twins.  The burning urties.  You think she has a sweet set?  Yeah.  Yeah, you like that shit, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  Free the twins.  Free the twins.  Yeah, we heard that the first five times.  You said it.  Why'd you stop humping the air?  Exactly.  What all the same integrity?  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  He's just...  This is just fucking useless.  We have a fucking retarded guy humping the air with pre-cum in his awful European underpants.  Ah, shit.  Time for the chair of honor, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Even though David from Israel doesn't...  But I think we would have to...  Yes, sir?  I would have to...  Jimmy...  Well, I got the song and everything, so...  Oh, yeah, let's hear the song.  Jimmy has been paying attention the entire time, and one of these fine... 
[03:24:00]  Uh, people get to sit in the chair of honor.  Chair of honor.  Congratulations!  Oh, it's afterwards?  It's after.  Oh, I thought it was the big song before.  Oh, no.  Spoiler alert.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  All right, Jimmy.  It's time to pick the winner of the chair.  A quick analysis.  They're all very good zilches.  I don't remember the guy on the end's name with the calves, but you were good.  You acknowledged that your calves were large, but the hair on your leg prevents me from 
[03:24:30]  putting you.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Your legs are a little tight.  Jimmy's tough.  Criteria is very...  Very tough.  Very tight.  And what do you call what you do?  A...  Sommelier.  A sommelier.  I don't like that word.  No.  So I'll probably disqualify you from the couch of zilches.  I mean, from the chair of honor.  You're welcome to stay on the couch of zilches.  Yes, of course.  The Val Kilmer guy, I do admire the fact that you lost a lot of weight, but the fact that  you did it only because you had fucking boulders in your gallbladder disqualifies you 
[03:25:00]  from the couch of the chair of honor.  Oh, wow.  Now, it's a tough call because we have Adrian, who's very sexy, but the fact that she's wearing  boots like a Star Wars figure makes me disqualify her.  Ah!  And she's married.  Oh, boy.  And would not poke the penis of a blithering idiot.  Right.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's okay.  That disqualifies her.  Oh, man.  You are tough.  And now we have Brie. 
[03:25:30]  Well, what about Bobo?  Well, I haven't gotten to Bobo yet.  And what about Dave from Israel?  Well, I haven't gotten to him.  And Patty.  I haven't gotten...  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  I'm going meticulously now.  Brie, there's a question.  You know what you're doing.  I'm sorry.  Can I...  Would I be able to suck on your breasts?  Wow.  Oh, no.  It's an automatic disqualification from the chair of honor.  That is tough.  To humiliate one of the hosts in such a vicious fashion.  It's terrible.  With such mean-spiritedness.  I'm sorry.  Tender young age.  Patty? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  No chair of honor for you.  Well, well, give her one more chance to poke the penis.  Will you poke Bobo's penis?  I don't want to touch them.  Well, you want the chair of honor, don't you?  Do you want the chair of honor?  Everyone wants the chair of honor for Pete's sake.  You got your picture on the wall like they do in restaurants.  It's huge.  I don't want to...  Patty.  Oh.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Chair of honor.  Patty.  Chair of honor.  Chair of honor.  Patty. 
[03:26:30]  Patty.  I don't deserve the chair of honor.  No, you really don't.  You don't deserve it.  Unless it's the passenger seat in Harry Chapin's car.  Unless there's 20,000 volts going through it.  Yes.  Or unless it's a fucking toilet with a plunger in it that you deserve to be fucking thrust  out of the chair of honor by Hulk Hogan.  So I would say, who do we have that belongs in the chair of honor?  What do you think? 
[03:27:00]  It's down to David from Israel and Bobo?  Blow, blow.  Blow, blow.  Didn't we...  Sitting on this chair and all that...  Oh, no, he's penciled back up.  Okay.  Bobo.  Yeah, that's true.  How bad do you want the chair of honor?  I want it badly.  Speak from your heart.  Speak from your heart.  Tell it like it is.  I've been trying to get that on her for the past two, three weeks.  Wow.  Really working a lifetime on that one, huh?  Jeez.  And I was really upset when the internet wasn't working in my house.  That's what you say it wasn't working.  But I was going to go on Facebook. 
[03:27:30]  You say it was.  According to Danny, it was working and you're lying.  It really isn't working.  That's not what Danny's been telling us.  Yeah, but he doesn't live in my house.  But he's been saying that your internet's working fine.  I've been on the internet someplace else.  Oh, according to Danny, it's been at home.  No, I wasn't at home.  So I guess Danny's a liar.  Yeah, yeah.  You call me a fucking liar?  Oh, shit.  Because I wasn't at home the times I was on the internet this week.  All right, well, David did travel a long way, though.  He sure did, Jimmy. 
[03:28:00]  From Israel.  From Israel.  And he is a regular contributor to this program.  Yes, unlike you, Bobo.  And he gives us a lot of our Jewish facts that we don't know.  Yes.  Unlike you, Bobo.  The guy's useful.  Yes.  We won't know something about Israel, and he will call up and give a very unbiased opinion  of the Golan Heights.  Jesus.  There he is.  He is essential to the O.B. and Anthony effort.  Yes, that's what we like.  It's all ours.  Wow.  Fuck.  That's funny.  So I don't know.  David's already sitting in the chair of honor.  Don't you think he looks good there, Bobo? 
[03:28:30]  He looks like he's been sitting there for a while.  Yeah, almost comfortable, right?  Yeah.  Very natural.  Yeah.  How much does that bother you, Bobo?  You're not speaking your mind.  That's your chair, and David's sitting in it.  Yeah, it does bother me.  I mean, he's sitting there, and I tried to get this for a while.  He's sitting there.  He's sitting there.  Why?  Just because you've tried for a while doesn't mean it's good.  What makes you worthy of it and him not?  I'm not sure.  I've been trying to get that honor for a while.  Trying to get what?  The chair of honor for a while. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But it doesn't matter that you've been in it for a while.  What makes you more qualified for the chair of honor than Dave from Israel?  I don't know.  I did.  I've done most of my stuff.  I was willing to drop my pants there.  And what did he do, right?  Ask that question today, Bobo.  He didn't do anything.  He wasn't willing to drop his pants.  He didn't do shit.  He's been in many heated discussions with some Palestinians.  That is true.  And he gave us some very good radio.  And Bobo, you don't understand. 
[03:29:30]  He never had to take his pants off.  This could be your last chance at the chair of honor for a while.  Right.  Because we only have five, six slots every week.  Right.  And we're not going to come back to you anytime soon because we've got a lot of people on  the waiting list.  It's going to be difficult.  I've probably been trying to get in front of it, right?  I mean, I was willing to probably embarrass myself on the show today.  What?  How?  Probably.  Oh, the air humping.  Everyone can do air guitar.  You're just air hump. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, David's just burying you.  Yeah.  Give David a mic.  This could get ugly.  Yeah.  Bobo, you've got to fight for the chair of honor.  Yeah, Bobo, come on.  You don't care about it.  Come on.  Speak your mind.  I really did that.  I really did that for myself because I really did that for the show.  That's why I did that.  For the show.  For the show.  Yeah, but you pretty much made all the ladies feel uncomfortable about what the show was  to a halt.  Nobody wanted to see that shit.  And then went to see your ass crack?  Oh, man.  I don't care.  I'm screwed for life now.  Oh, man.  I didn't really want to make any ladies uncomfortable there. 
[03:30:30]  I did that.  Then you shouldn't have even showed up in the first place.  Oh, man.  You better speak your mind, Bobo.  I did that for the show.  I went.  Man.  He's nailing you, Bobo.  I went and I rushed to get here.  Doesn't matter.  He came here from Israel.  He's saying he took the chair of honor and deserves it.  Yeah, he sat down in it without us even giving it to him, just knowing he'd probably get it. 
[03:31:00]  That's how confident he is.  You're busy humping the air and playing games and somebody's going after the chair of honor,  his quest.  Yeah, well then, I don't know.  It doesn't make sense.  They think you're supposed to be awarded it first before you sit in it.  Well, part of the award, I think, is the courage he had in sitting there, knowing he would probably get it.  But not you.  I'm the Bobo motherfucker.  All you do was show up.  I worked for this.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, but you didn't work much.  All you showed is maybe two and a half inches. 
[03:31:30]  He's getting mad.  Oh, and the comedy's flying.  Here, that's my fucking chair.  And I'm sitting in it, bitch.  That's not the worst.  That's not the worst.  Listen here.  No, that's...  What?  All right, listen, he...  That's my fucking chair.  He goes, listen here.  And I got good pen in it.  Jesus.  Listen, you jaw bastard. 
[03:32:00]  Listen, you carp.  What happened, Bobo?  How'd you lose?  I don't know.  I freaking lost a chair to a guy that looks like the freaking...  Looks like the freaking deli guy.  Oh, man.  Anti-Semitic.  Yeah, see, that won't get you the chair.  Right there.  The deli guy.  Like a Jewish deli, right?  No, not just any deli specifically.  He just happens to look like the same person I buy sandwiches from.  Oh, that's funny, then. 
[03:32:30]  When you say it looks like this guy.  It's not even a joke.  Literally, he looks like his deli guy.  I don't know much about the guy in the deli department.  I just know that he looks like his deli.  Well, why would you?  No, Bobo.  I don't know Bobo.  Huh?  I know.  Oh, it's just mind-boggling.  All right, well, Jimmy, you got to decide.  I mean, you know.  I think that...  This is really important to Bobo.  My vote is Bobo, but I think that Danny made a point of he's able to override me, and he 
[03:33:00]  said that it had to be David.  So I would have voted for Bobo, but Danny felt that it should be David.  Yep.  And he felt that Bobo is just not bringing it and doesn't really want the chair.  Yeah, you could tell it at the water.  Maybe next time, Bobo.  We gave you a chance to fight for it, and I do want it.  So, Danny, I will acquiesce to your wish.  You didn't fight.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bow just didn't have it in him today.  You want to try to take that chair, Bobo?  Yeah.  Go try to take that chair.  Not physically. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, shit.  Where are you going, maniac?  I'll kick your ass.  Yeah, David might have bombs strapped to him.  Yes, David will jump up and just litigate with you.  Been in the military since he was six.  Exactly.  He knows some moves.  They work over there.  Yeah.  He said he was in the massage.  All right.  Well, I guess, sorry, Bobo.  I mean, it's not my fault.  Sorry, Bobo.  I wanted to give it to you and so did the guys, but Danny says no, and it's no.  And as you can see, all the other chairs are taken, so you know what to do. 
[03:34:00]  I got this ticket here.  I don't know if it's...  Who the heck took the real ticket?  Language!  I don't know who took the real ticket.  We're not pornographers.  No, no, I got the fake ticket.  How could I go to the game if I don't have a real ticket?  Danny took the real ticket, and he grabbed the envelope.  Oh, he's blaming Danny?  Which had the real ticket, and he...  What ticket you got?  Does it look like a legit ticket?  It looks legit to me.  It's a fake ticket.  All I got is real tickets.  I mean, my friend could take care of the tickets.  I could call him right now. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, shit.  I could call my friend.  I fucking dare you.  I dare you.  Bobo's got connections.  I fucking dare you.  Then call him, bitch.  Say the word you're going to the game, and I'll...  Yeah, say it then.  Tell him.  And Rob will take care...  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Let's call Rob.  Let's call Rob.  Get Rob on the fucking phone right now.  Let's call Rob on the R.  He's tapping his phone to try to make it work.  Don't...  Don't...  This thing takes long to load, because it's just trying to...  Yeah, what are you doing?  He's tapping it.  Jesus.  He's tapping it.  Like Kirk's communicator when he can't get Scotty.  Scotty. 
[03:35:00]  Come on.  Scotty.  Come on.  Time's running out, Bobo.  You're almost out of time.  That's it.  You got him?  No, that's it.  That's it.  I got it.  Got it.  It's too late.  What's he saying?  It's too late.  Too late.  It's styling.  Too late.  Okay, it's styling.  Hello, Rob?  Tell him he's on the air.  Yeah, you're on the air.  Sort of.  Speaker phone?  You're sort of on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah, sort of.  He's not on the air.  You're on the air.  You got...  On the air.  Right, right.  Obese here on the phone, right?  Shut this blooming through his ears.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:35:30]  What did he say?  It's Kevin from Connecticut.  Sorry about that.  I got it mixed up when someone called when I turned on the phone.  What a jerk.  It's Kevin from Connecticut.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  I got it.  See, if you wanted the couch, you would have it.  That's not a person who wants the chair of honor.  Yeah, you hear Rob.  You're on the air.  Obi wants the tickets.  Oh, that's funny, man.  What'd you do with the fucking ticket you had?  You want it on? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'll pull you away from Mike.  Danny took the ticket.  The extra ticket.  What?  The two seats I had.  Wait, wait, wait.  Danny took Obi's ticket?  Yeah.  Give me your fucking ticket, you whore on.  My ticket's at home.  You're on the fucking game and you stay home.  My ticket's at home, but if that's the case, then I'd have to give you, I guess I'd have to give you my ticket.  Listen, I don't think you're going to the game anytime you want, as far as I'm concerned. 
[03:36:30]  I'll give him tickets for any day, any time.  But that doesn't mean you can fucking go out of me.  Ooh.  Oh.  Oh, well.  It's okay.  Well, no, but I mean, poor Bobo, right?  It's okay.  What's the matter, Bobo?  You're a little hurt by that, right?  Did you stay home and then Obi goes to you?  I was hoping to go to the game with you, Bobo.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, Obi wants to go to the game with me.  It sounds like a clusterfuck.  You don't even have a ticket for me. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  I had a ticket and then Danny took the ticket.  He wanted to go with me.  I think you had one ticket.  You wanted to make like you had two, so you drew up another ticket.  How am I supposed to go to the ticket at home?  Why'd you throw up a ticket, though, Bobo?  Why'd you leave it at home like a money transfer for a hostage?  Just get one ticket at home.  You'll get one now and one later.  Danny took the ticket and wrote this face.  I can't go to a game with a fake ticket, Bobo.  Danny, where's the real ticket? 
[03:37:30]  You're holding it.  No, you took the real ticket when you grabbed the envelope.  I'll make a deal with you.  If this ticket appears within the next minute, I'll go to the game with you.  He'll go.  All right.  One minute from right now.  Give me the real ticket, damn it.  One minute.  Where is the real ticket?  One minute.  Where is the real ticket?  Obi will go with you.  Where is the real ticket?  45 seconds.  Where is the real ticket?  I'm looking for 45 seconds.  It can appear in 40 seconds.  Dig for your pants, Bobo. 
[03:38:00]  Does anybody have the ticket?  Dig for the pants.  The show is ending.  There's a ticket.  The show is ending.  30 seconds.  No, no, no.  This isn't the ticket.  This is a well stick.  I cannot get in with a well stick.  Bobo.  We cannot get in with a well stick.  Bobo, 25 seconds.  Come on.  Somebody have the real ticket.  Bobo, 25.  Give me the ticket.  25 seconds.  This isn't $1.  I can't buy a ticket for $1.  Somebody, where is the real ticket?  You got 15 seconds.  Where is the real ticket?  You got 15 seconds.  The show is going to end.  Where is the real ticket?  Give me the ticket and I'll go. 
[03:38:30]  15 seconds.  I'll be able to go.  How much time?  Who has the real ticket?  10 seconds.  Who has the real ticket?  I don't have it.  Who has the real ticket?  Somebody took the real ticket.  Five seconds.  Somebody took the real ticket.  4, 3, 2, 1, 0.  Time's up.  The Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  The Fire is.  I'm Sam.  And I'm E-Rock.

[03:40:00]  What's the matter, Bubba?  No, Danny, give me the real ticket in time.  I don't see the real ticket.  Where's the real ticket?  Travis just had the real...  I just saw Travis...  Where's the real ticket?  Well, you had some time.  I just saw Travis with that real ticket right there.  So how come you...  What happened?  Danny gave you the ticket before, right?  Yeah, you had time.  I don't see the ticket.  We came back on the air because I thought you had the ticket.  Forget it.  I gotta go home.  I gotta go home.  Come on.  You give me the ticket.  You blew it.  Danny's holding that ticket right there.  The only reason we came back on the air is I thought you had the ticket. 
[03:40:30]  You blew it.  Could you hand open a ticket?  You blew it.  I don't see a ticket.  I don't see a ticket.  I don't see a ticket.  He has a ticket right there.  Where?  I don't see a ticket.  Now Opie can't go to the game.  He's running off with the ticket.  Hand the real ticket.  Oh, if I hear ticket one more time.  Bobo, what are you doing?  I'm sorry we came back on the air.  I thought he had the ticket for me.  Restricted area.  Now I really gotta go home.  Yeah, get out of here.  He's got the ticket.  I gotta go home.  But he's got the real ticket.  Opie gotta go home. 
[03:41:00]  That's it.  So what happened?  You're wasting my time.  I thought we had the ticket.  What did Danny do?  I don't know what he did.  He's hunting the real ticket again.  So he blew the game for you?  Yeah, he blew the game.  He caught me the game, all right?  He just popped Danny.  He caught me the game, all right?  Oh, he caught you the game with Opie.  Now what I'm gonna have to do,  when I said I'd force my sister to go through,  because Opie didn't go to the game.  What'd you force your sister to go through?  No, no.  No, not go to the game. 
[03:41:30]  Me calling her Opie the whole game.  Me addressing her as Opie the entire game.  That would have been so nice.  She was gonna go to the game with Opie.  He was gonna go with you.  I'll have to damn freaking address my sister  as Opie the whole game.  All right, well, you don't care.  No, I'm seriously gonna do that, all right?  All right, we heard the bomb three times.  And any fans that see me at the wall park will notice that.  I don't care.  I'm sorry you came back in the air.  Yeah, sorry.  I came back on to see if you had the ticket, bro.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Danny has the ticket there. 
[03:42:00]  He has the ticket now.  He has the ticket.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he just ripped it up.  And now he ripped...  No, no, he didn't rip up that ticket.  He ripped it up.  Oh, well, that's the ticket.  Oh, he just threw the ticket in the air all ripped up.  It's a paper that looks like the ticket,  but it isn't the ticket.  Are you sure?  He's got the ticket.  He's got the ticket.  Danny's got the ticket.  Ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket.  Danny's got the ticket.  Ticket, ticket.  Serrano's got the tickets.  Serrano's got the tickets. 
[03:42:30]  He's got the ticket.  I don't have it.  You got the ticket.  Ripped it up.  All right, well, Opie wanted to go.  Travis has to physically hold Bobo back  because he's charging at people.  I'll make you a deal.  You were going to go, right, Opie?  You were going to go.  I'll make you a deal.  That would have been fun.  Hold on.  I got some.  That would have been fun for you to go.  I got some.  Yeah?  This is official paperwork from SiriusXM.  Yeah?  That I was supposed to sign. 
[03:43:00]  If you rip this in half, I'll go to the game with you.  You know the paper from earlier.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Do me a favor.  Don't look at it, though, because it's secret shit.  Rip that in half, and I will go to the game with you.  Rip it right in half.  You're not strong enough, I don't think.  Whoops.  Oh, no.  I accidentally ripped the mess ticket.  The ticket was wrapped in the paper, 
[03:43:30]  and Bobo ripped the paper.  Luckily, I didn't rip up the barcode.  Luckily, I didn't rip up the barcode.  That's no good.  That's no good anymore.  They won't take that.  Why'd you rip Bobo's ticket off?  Why'd you rip the ticket?  You're a barcode of work.  The barcode will work.  Oh, Bobo.  You're making him rip his own ticket off.  I think the barcode will work.  Oh, Bobo, you ripped it in half.  Bobo, why'd you rip the ticket?  It was an accident.  I didn't really think it was in there.  The barcode was going to be sitting in the game with you.  No, no one will take it.  No one will take it. 
[03:44:00]  Did Danny put that in there?  We put the ticket in the middle of the paper.  He couldn't have ripped it in a better spot.  Did someone just rip his own ticket in half?  Anybody who works in the Mets who can answer the question,  would the ticket still work?  Would the barcode still work?  No, it won't.  They won't take a ripped-up ticket.  They won't.  Bobo, I'm not going all the way to the stadium  where the ticket ripped in half.  Why'd you do that?  There's a real good chance that they're not going to take it.  They ripped the tickets when you go in.  Did someone call in?  No, no one's calling in.  We're busy.  Why didn't Danny put it in there?  I think someone would know. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, no one's calling.  Bob, you know if the ticket would work  if it got accidentally ripped out the...  Oh, boy.  No, it didn't get to the part...  Bobo, why'd you rip the ticket in half?  Bobo, why'd you rip the ticket in half?  Why'd you do that?  You're the one that did it, Bobo.  You did it.  Hold on, let me...  This ticket didn't get ripped up, right?  It accidentally got ripped up.  I would have won it, Bobo.  No, Bobo.  Mark, someone's won the ticket.  I would have won it.  All right, Opie's gone. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, I think I'm going to get out of here.  If that's the case, no one's going to the game.  All right, no game.  You just hang in, fuck it.  Well, if that's the case, Shannon Gordon, my sister,  hope you're listening.  And if not, I'll make you listen to the replay.  You and your worthless tickets.  I am going to have to address you as Opie the entire game.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, later, later.  I've had it with you.  Yeah, this ticket got ripped.  I got tricked into ripping the ticket. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, now I'm going to have to call to ask  if they can replace this.  Oh, you want to do it here?  I got it.  Daniel.  I just called them.  If you tape it together, I'll be fine.  All right.  All right, well.  All right.  And here's 20 bucks for your ripped underwear.  All right.  I'll tape to get his ticket and see if it works.  I was just told the ticket will work fine. 
[03:46:00]  All you have to do is give this to Opie and it will work.  Just found out the ticket will work fine.  I'm shocked Opie doesn't believe me.  I said it'll work fine.  The barcode will work fine.  I said it'll work fine.  I think it'll work fine.  I'm going to see my Twitter. 
[03:46:30]  Stick it old.  Stick it will work fine.  Just to be taped together, it'll work fine.  It's the Bobo Show.  Yeah, this is After ONA Live.  Sam's not here, so I'm hosting.  I'm sure as you heard, you heard an eventful end of the show because of this whole issue over this one MET ticket. 
[03:47:00]  One of two MET tickets I had.  My friend would have took care of it.  Would have upgraded these seats, as you know, if Opie would have gone.  Forcedly didn't go.  Didn't believe that this ticket would work.  Supposedly, I heard from a source.  Kenny said that someone from the MET organization said that this ticket would work.  But I'm trying to get, I'm trying to see if anyone from the MET organization could call and confirm that this ticket would work.  The part with the barcode wasn't ripped up.  The phone number is 866-969-1969. 
[03:47:30]  I'm sure there's someone in the MET organization listening.  Absolutely.  Well, the phones are ringing.  Once we get those screened, buddy, we're going to figure this out for you.  Yeah, and somebody would know if this ticket works, all right?  You want to just take them dry?  We'll just take dry phones, I think.  All right.  Hey, Buster, you're on the air, man.  Hey, where's Sam?  Enough of them fucking horror commercials.  Get on the air.  Sam's not here today.  All right.  Next caller.  You're on the air.  Hi, this is Mr. Jackson from the IRS.  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  I would like to speak with Mr. Daniel Kerlin, please.  Okay, you got him.  Bobo, say hi.  I'm wondering what the value of those tickets were that were given to Mr. Kerlin as a gift.  Now, these two tickets I have here, these were just cheap tickets.  They were worth $25.  $45?  $25.  $25 a piece.  Yeah.  So the total cost would be $50, correct?  Yeah.  Okay.  According to the current IRS code, there is a 53% gift tax that is required to be paid on any gifts received in the United States. 
[03:48:30]  But what, you got the money for that?  I don't get the money for that damn tax.  Okay.  What you're going to have to do is you're going to have to get your money together.  And we're probably going to run an audit.  How long have you been receiving gifts?  No, I received these tickets. 
[03:49:00]  I received these tickets a month, two months ago.  Have you received other gifts?  Have you won anything on the air?  I don't know.  There's that XM subscription I got.  Okay, Mr. Kerlin.  What I'm going to have to do is get a hold of my colleagues.  And we'll be contacting you in the near future.  We're probably going to have to audit you back three years.  Thanks, IRS.  Have a good one.  Hey, next caller, you're on the air. 
[03:49:30]  You want to talk to Bobo?  Yeah.  You want to talk to yourself, Bobo?  You answered.  You answered.  All right, forget it.  Who's this?  This is Andrew from Philly.  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  How come you want to see the Mets?  They're not even good.  Yeah, boo.  Hang up on that guy.  You Phillies suck.  We're going to kick your ass.  All right, he's gone.  I'm going to kick your ass.  I hope the Fnatic gets hit with another ball. 
[03:50:00]  All right, whatever.  And this is a whole bunch of them.  What are you going to do about this Mets ticket, Bobo?  I'm trying to figure out if there's anyone from the Mets organization who knows if this ticket will work.  You can't use a ticket.  It's ripped in half.  Yeah, the thing is.  It's ripped in half.  I'm thinking it isn't because the barcode part wasn't seen.  Do you know what's going to happen when you go to hand that ticket?  Thanks.  You know what's going to happen when you hand that ticket?  Yeah.  The guy that scans the ticket, he's going to look at it and say, you can't use this ticket.  It's been ripped in half and taped back together.  And what are you going to say? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, Patty.  What are you going to say?  What can you say?  Oh, good.  Your mic's off.  The ticket wasn't even used yet.  The ticket wasn't even used yet.  Yeah, but it's obviously just two different tickets taped together.  Yeah, it's the same ticket taped together.  If you put it, see there, it's like that.  See, it is the actual ticket.  And if there is anybody from the Mets organization, anybody, anybody, there's got to be someone from the Mets organization that's listening. 
[03:51:00]  Let's see.  Hello, sir.  Are you on the Mets organization?  Yes, I am.  Oh, well, isn't that a treat?  Well, can you help us in this situation?  What happened is Bobo, our friend Bobo is a little slow.  And Bobo got tricked into ripping up his very own Mets ticket.  Oh, wait, hang on, sir.  We have the hotline ringing.  I'm going to have to come back to you, but don't go anywhere, okay?  Because I do want to get back to this.  Hang on. 
[03:51:30]  Caller, you're on the air.  Hello.  Yes.  Hi, yes.  This is Art Vandelay.  I work at Tint Field.  Mr. Vandelay.  This sounds like some trick, Art Vandelay.  That's something you obviously took out of a Seinfeld episode, all right?  Oh, shit.  Oh, now you just sound like a shitty regular caller.  With your shit phone.  Yeah, it's obviously this one was a fake.  You took that off of a Seinfeld episode. 
[03:52:00]  You took a fake paper.  I didn't think you watched Seinfeld.  Yeah, I do.  That's the thing.  You don't know that I do, all right?  Hey, Ann, how does it feel to be outsmarted by a retard?  What episode was it?  That was the one when George...  I think that was the same one during the whole Keith Hernandez episode, I think.  Ironically.  The same episode.  Ironically, right.  Because he was a Met.  Yeah, but what happened was he was trying to convince the unemployed lady at the unemployment office to a little bit. 
[03:52:30]  Right.  Yeah, and he was making up a fake business Vandelay Industries, and he was...  That's hilarious.  Wasn't it funny?  Yeah, yeah, that was...  That's hilarious.  Bobo, you're not going to the game.  That ticket is null and fucking void.  And you're a fucking retard.  Oh!  Just 10%.  Yeah, but someone legitimate...  Someone legitimate me from the Mets organization that would know this...  Call in a legitimate person from the Mets organization.  It's like Despicable Me.  It's legitimate me. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  All right, have fun.  A legitimate person.  Yeah, what do you think of Opie and Anthony and how they treated you today?  I ripped his ticket, all right?  Microphone.  It's a little bit...  I'm bummed out that Opie isn't able to...  Isn't going to go to the game.  Well, you ripped his ticket.  You ripped his ticket up.  Yeah, but I was trying to tell him it probably will still work.  I'm sure someone from the Mets organization could confirm that it would work.  All right, all right.  Well, hold on.  Why didn't you ask Anthony if he wanted to go?  If he wanted to go, he could have said he wants to go. 
[03:53:30]  But you didn't ask him.  You only asked Opie if he wanted to go.  You never, ever even asked Anthony.  So, but do you have a problem with Anthony?  No.  I wasn't sure Anthony would have wanted to go.  Why?  Maybe he wanted to go to the Mets game.  I know Anthony very well, and I'm going to fucking tell him that you didn't want him  to even fucking go to the Mets game.  Well, I did want him to go to the Mets game.  Now that I suspect you are Anthony.  Why would Anthony call this show? 
[03:54:00]  I don't know.  The voice is starting to sound familiar.  Familiar?  Yeah, very familiar.  I freaking know it's you, Anthony.  I could be yelling at cab drivers.  Why am I wasting my time with this fucking idiot?  I don't know why you try on this show.  I know, right?  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, let's go back to someone else.  I think we had a guy from the Mets organization.  Yeah, line one.  Now, this is legit, right? 
[03:54:30]  This isn't no fucking around because my friend here is very upset about his Mets ticket, and  I think he's been jerked around enough today.  No, my name is Mike Mett.  I'm the vice president of the ticket making for the Mets organization.  All right.  What can you do for Daniel Curlin?  In our tickets, we have a secret code.  If he ripped that code, that ticket is no good.  I didn't rip.  The barcode part wasn't ripped up.  Did the ticket rip in half?  Where's the secret code located?  It's from the bottom to the top.  I'll just take your money. 
[03:55:00]  Let's call it like the middle four inches of the ticket?  Yes.  Yeah, dude.  That's totally fucked.  That is ripping.  It's a fake ticket.  They will not accept.  We will not accept it.  Thanks, Mr. Mett.  That ticket there, was that someone there with the last name Mett?  He's gone.  That's it.  Bo, I don't know what to tell you, man.  I mean, look, you did it to yourself.  Listen, how come...  Hey, we're trying to do a radio show here.  Thanks.  So, uh...  It's amazing.  So, Bobo, what are you going to do? 
[03:55:30]  When's that ticket even for?  It's for next...  Was it for this weekend's game?  It was for tomorrow's game.  Well, I'll tell you what you do.  Kenny ripped your underpants, right?  But he gave you the money for it.  So, why don't you take the money, buy a new ticket?  Yeah, I might have to do that.  I'll go buy a new ticket.  See if it works.  Yeah, but what about Opie?  If Opie wants to go, I'll...  Then definitely go.  I'll buy the...  That's too late.  You're not going to see him tomorrow. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, but if they...  I don't know...  Bobo, I have a question.  Why the fuck is Patty here on a microphone?  I don't know.  Patty's here.  Yeah, I'm here.  I don't know.  I guess she's here because she's here.  I can't get a word in edgewise, though.  Well, let's focus.  Let's switch the focus here.  Maybe Patty's feeling left out because she has nothing to do with Bobo or the Mets.  No, I'm not a real sports person at all.  I'm more of a music person.  Well, it's the after show.  So, this is the show after the show, right?  Right, exactly.  So, why don't we talk about what happened on today's show? 
[03:56:30]  What was your favorite part of today's show?  My favorite part was letting the guy from Israel sit down in the chair of honor.  That was your favorite part of the show?  He came a long way.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well...  That was awesome.  Cool.  What was your least favorite part?  How come you wouldn't touch Bobo's dick?  That was my least favorite part.  Yeah, but what's the difference between...  Look, Jim has a cock.  Bobo has a cock.  But it's not like you're touching Bobo's dick because they both have clothes. 
[03:57:00]  So, you're just touching fabric.  So, what's the difference?  Nah, I don't know.  What's the problem?  You've touched it before.  Like, you've touched...  You just touched Jim's penis over his pants.  What's the difference?  Well, there's a limit that you go to and you don't go over the limit.  Bobo's over the limit.  You hear that, Bobo?  Yeah, he's over the limit.  Patty pretends like she don't do nothing and she's this angelic, innocent girl.  Meanwhile, I could remember back at the old studio over at XM. 
[03:57:30]  She's wearing vibrating panties and basically cumming in her pants in studio.  But then she won't touch...  She won't, like, just poke or even flick ever so slightly the Bobcock.  No.  Don't you think it's time?  Don't you think it's time?  And what better cock to touch than a fellow virgin?  Oh, that's okay.  You know it's never been anywhere.  You know he doesn't have anything.  Especially a cock.  Yeah, it's barely a penis.  Like, you're barely touching a penis.  You know he's clean as a whistle. 
[03:58:00]  What's the problem?  I don't feel comfortable.  But you're comfortable enough to sit in a room full of men and basically cum in your underwear.  Well, you know, I've done crazy, crazy things.  All right, so do one more and touch his cock.  Through the pants.  Through the pants.  Look, what I'm trying to tell you here is that you've done crazier things in the past.  Yes, I have.  So what's the problem?  No one's going to care.  I don't know why you think this is going to end up on, like, the cover of a tabloid somewhere.  No one gives a shit. 
[03:58:30]  No one gives a shit.  Oh, I know, but it's just that, you know...  All right, well, you're obviously a bore and you're not going to be doing anything else on this radio show, so...  Oh, stop.  Well, what?  You're going to do something?  What are you going to do?  We're running out of time.  You're not going to do nothing.  Well, I know this has been a jam-packed episode of the after show.  This is...  Oh, my God.  I mean, this is one for the books, folks.  This is really one for the books.  I think this one's going to go on the worst of real.  Bobo, you want to...  You have any final comments?  Well, I've got...  Anything to plug?  I don't think I'm going to be at the game tomorrow. 
[03:59:00]  I'm going to be sitting in section 526.  The Hobie and Anthony show is now over. </pre>
